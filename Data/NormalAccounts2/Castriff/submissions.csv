""It used to be a problem, for so many people. Knowing what was coming, but not when or how..."" 

Dr. June waved her pencil in the air as she spoke. She seemed very calm, completely unconcerned with the fact that Charles' life was in shambles as he faced his imminent death. Very unprofessional.

""But now it isn't! Because all those people get sent to me."" She smiled, a little too warmly, and Charles shivered. ""You came to the right place, Mr. Preston. The Pandora Research Institute is well equipped to help you.""

""Right.""

Charles shifted in his chair. He had never been in a psychologist's office before today. He felt as though it were some sort of... lie. A normal doctor's office was enough to make him nervous, but that was natural. A doctor's office was very honest about the type of discomfort you might encounter: needles, cold gloves, those dreadful waiting rooms with magazines no one ever bothers to read, that sort of thing. 

Dr. June's office was something else entirely, a doctor's office that pretended to be warm and inviting. The walls and carpet were beige, the most boring, non-threatening color which ever graced the earth. One one wall hung picture frames with Dr. June's many certifications and awards for exemplary work in her field, above a small table piled with books and a small coffeemaker. A bookcase filled the wall opposite. The classic *chaise lounge,* red, and warmed by the sunlight from the window, completed the ensemble. It was the epitome of a therapist's workplace, and yet it felt entirely *wrong.*

Of course, it didn't help that he'd gotten yet another notification once he'd stepped inside the building. God, it was nerve-wracking.

""So, how many 'Last Chance' notifications have you gotten today?""

""Five."" Charles' throat was dry.

""Five! Very high."" Another swirl of her pencil. ""Can you list them for me? Are they places you go often?""

Charles gritted his teeth. ""Considering the first notification was in my *home,* I would say so.""

Dr. June pouted. ""Now, Mr. Preston, I know you're upset, but I need you to work with me here! This is very important. Where else did you go?""

""My office... my daughter's school...""

""Oh, you have a daughter! How nice!""

""It's not nice!"" Charles yelled. ""What if I never see her again? Or my wife?""

""Mr. Preston-""

""At the very least, my Life Statistics program could tell me that, but it doesn't! It won't tell me about how I die! It just wants to tell me about *buildings!*""

""Well, that's for the best! Imagine the problems that would crop up if people knew how they would die. Everyone would be a total mess!""

""AND I'M NOT?""

""That's what you're here for. To get help. To get closure."" Another swirl. 

Charles groaned. ""Why did I ever decide to get this stupid implant? This is STUPID! This concept is STUPID! This world is STUPID!""

""Mr. Preston!"" Dr. June leaned forward and took his hand in hers. It was meant to be a comforting gesture, but the tip of the pencil dug into his wrist and he swatted her hand away. She stared at him, eyes wide in a way that suggested morbid curiosity more than sincere worry.

""You came here so we could help you.""

""I don't want to be here. I didn't have a choice. Your office was the only option for help with my implant, because the Pandora Research Institute made the implant in the first place!"" Charles shut his eyes to keep from tearing up. ""And you haven't been helpful! No one in your company has!""

""I'm sorry you feel that way."" *Swirl.*

""I'm sorry too."" Charles stood, and before Dr. June could object, he opened the door and exited the office.

""Sir?"" The secretary had jumped when Charles stormed into the waiting room. ""Sir, you need to sign out-""

""Don't bother."" He grabbed his coat from the hook near the door.

""But sir, you haven't paid-""

""If you want my money, you can pry it from my cold, dead hands. It should only take a few hours.""

""Sir!""

Charles slammed the door behind him and took the stairs down to the parking lot. He felt too worked up to take the elevator, and anyway, what if he died falling down the shaft? It took ten minutes to get to the bottom floor. To his surprise, Dr. June was waiting at the end of the stairwell.

""Leave me alone!""

""Mr. Preston, I understand how stressful this must be for you."" Why had she brought that infuriating pencil with her? Now she was twirling it between her fingers, even when she rested her free hand on his shoulder. ""But you can't give up now. You *can't*.""

Charles sobbed.

""I'm about to go on my lunch break,"" Dr. June announced. ""If you like, we could talk somewhere less formal. I would feel terrible leaving you to yourself."" 

Charles shook his head and muscled past her through the door. Then he froze.

According to Pandora Life Statistics, you are entering this building/landmark for the last time in your life. So sad to see you go! Enjoy this moment, and take a picture to preserve your memories.

An electronic chirp sounded in the distance. ""My car is right this way, Mr. Preston. Please?""

In a daze, he followed. Dr. June's car was an economical grey minivan that smelled of Fresh Pine Scent^TM and had coffee stains in the cupholders. She lifted a water bottle.

""Would you like some? I'm sorry, it's a bit warm, but...""

""That's okay."" He took long swigs as Dr. June started the car. It tasted awful. ""...Where are we going?""

""You'll see."" The pencil was tucked behind her ear, and she adjusted her hair around it. ""You know, you really don't have to be afraid of the Life Statistics notifications.""

He sighed. ""I don't want to die.""

""No one does. As a therapist, believe me, I know. But I've been doing this a long time."" She turned and smiled at Charles, whose eyes were beginning to flutter as his head fell forward. ""Let me help you.""
***
Charles woke up.

He didn't remember falling asleep, and it set off warning bells in his mind for a brief moment. But then he remembered that he was supposed to be dead, and all of a sudden the prospect of an unexpected nap seemed much less terrifying. Still, he didn't know where he was. The room was pitch black.

He raised a hand to his face, but then stopped as his implant began to reactivate itself. The sight of the loading screen brought back a flood of the day's memories, but did nothing to explain where he was, much less ease his worry. He sat up and reached forward, trying to find some clue as to his surroundings.

His hand came up against cold steel.

A door opened a few feet in front of him, and a hand reached out from the new source of light to flip a switch. Charles was seated in a cage, perfectly square and bolted to the floor of what looked like an unfinished basement. He felt a prickling at the back of his neck as Dr. June stepped inside.

""Oh, good, you're awake! How are you feeling?""

""...Where am I?""

""You're with me, of course! You'll be safe here.""

""Where? What... Why am I in a cage?""

""This is for your own protection, Mr. Preston."" Dr. June knelt down and met his gaze. ""I want to help you. I don't want you to die. If you stay here, no one will be able to hurt you.""

Charles noticed spots of red on the hardwood floor. He began to sweat.

""No one here wants to kill you,"" she continued. ""You can't get into a car crash, or fall off a ladder, or have an accident of any kind. As long as you stay with me, you'll live a good, long life.""

""No! NO!"" Charles grabbed the bars of his cage. ""Let me out! Let me out!""

Dr. June shook her head. ""I was afraid this would happen,"" she said, standing. ""We'll have to have another session. Let me get my pencil.""

*_[Track listing: Electric Counterpoint by Steve Reich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plL2VDAoThU)_*
&gt;Welcome, all, to Cloud City.  

&gt;In the year 2059, Max Caltraine, CEO of Pandora Research Incorporated, presented his concept for the world's first floating city. Amid concerns of overpopulation and excessive pollution, he sought to solve both problems with the help of a single, revolutionary new piece of technology: The Corobian Diamond. Under the right environmental circumstances, this artificial crystal had the ability to take in any ambient fuel such as heat or sunlight, and catalyze it, outputting pure electrical energy without any waste matter.

    Corobian Diamond:
    Main Element: Corobium (Cx); Atomic # 147
    Patent owned by Pandora Research International

&gt;At the time, many companies were fully invested in researching anti-gravitational devices (AGDs), but at the time, they were faced with the pitfall of being unable to power such devices for long periods of time. Although it is now common to find such devices ranging from transportation to children's toys, none of these innovations would have been possible without the birth of the Corobian Diamond.

    Fact: In 2091, the U.S. government decommissioned 
    the last fleet of planes not powered by Corobian Diamonds.
    Ten of these are on display in museums all over the world, 
    including a stealth fighter which can be found in the Cloud City Museum.

&gt;Although unthinkable today, the idea for Cloud City was met with opposition from many in both the public and private sectors. Safety was the primary concern, as AGDs had never been tested on such a large scale. However, Caltraine also faced pressure from the U.S. government, due to the logistical nightmare of creating an American city above American airspace.

&gt;It was eventually decided that Pandora Research Industries would create its own city. Construction began in 2063, in international waters, under the cryptonym Project Sky. The project was completed in 2071 and recognized by the United Nations a year later.

    Corporatocracy:
    Noun.
    1. a society or system that is governed or controlled by corporations.

The world will see this day in history as a turning point, the time when like minded people came together to create those perfect worlds seen only in fiction before. But let us keep striving toward the future. Let us find ourselves in a state where we continually dwarf our own achievements. This is the path to greatness.  
**-Brian R. M. Hamilton, Official U.N. Representative of the Nation of Pandora,   
August 16, 2072**

*_[Track listing: They All Laughed by Dakota Staton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBBY33stUkI)_*
&gt;Today, Cloud City is the crown jewel of one of six floating cities around the world. Together, these form the Nation of Pandora (and the most widely separated chain of islands on Earth). Each one is completely self-sustaining; everything from farming to waste disposal is handled entirely by Pandora Industries technology, without ever touching the ground. The massive cache of Corobian Diamond crystals in each region is enough not only to power the cities' AGDs, but also provide clean, sustainable energy for its citizens' needs. 

    Citizens and guests alike are encouraged to follow responsible,
    energy efficient practices. Visit www.keeppandoragreen.com for more information.

""Surrender your forces to me, King Xandrel, you vile scum of the earth!""

Slowly, the king opened a bleary, rusty eye to the proverbial wonders of a new day. Then he opened the other. He lay in a four-poster canopy bed, which took up nearly a quarter of the room, and the ornate gold and purple curtains obscured his vision of the outside world completely. For a brief moment, he wondered why he had woken up at all. Then the voice came again from outside.

""Come out and face me, Your Vile Majesty! Come and see the ruination of your tyranny!""

King Xandrel sat up, grunting.

""This dawn bears the coming of a new age! Your reign has ended! All hail Alyrie's new leader!""

*It is dawn?* The king shook his head at this. *It is far too early for me too be woken. Perhaps if I ignore this person, they will go away.*

""I will not be ignored!""

With a groan, King Xandrel lifted himself to the edge of the bed, pushing the curtains to one side. It was not dawn; indeed, the sun shown directly into the room through the balcony, blinding his sleep-clogged eyes even further. He raised a hand to his face as he scrounged around for his royal slippers. As he did, the voice continued to hurl insults at him from outside. It seemed particularly fond of the words *vile* and *Majesty*, as though it were a parrot that had learned little else in its time on Earth.

In his mind, the king attempted to compose a list of his subjects that he had recently angered, or inconvenienced in any way. Failing this, he stumbled toward the balcony, intent on discovering the source of the upset and laying it to rest as soon as possible.

Castle Alyrie lay to the north of the kingdom, surrounded on all sides by lush fields in which the king's subjects were free to let their livestock graze. A more cautious monarch would have had the castle built in the west, where an imposing mountain range might have shielded its back from all but the most vicious of attacks. But the old king who had commissioned its creation said, jokingly of course, that he wished to give his enemies a ""sporting chance"" at winning against the noble Alyrian army. The castle stood where it did as a show of trust, and anyway there had not been a war in the entire continent for over five hundred years. King Xandrel was on quite good terms with the kings of Parel and Onass on Alyrie's borders, and made it a point of habit to visit each of their kingdoms during the Fest of Harvest.

He expected that the voice would belong to some other man, then, perhaps accompanied by a score of riders, archers, and foot soldiers to wage war against his armies. Mentally, he cursed, wishing this tirade had come at a time when he was properly dressed and had eaten a proper breakfast. It greatly surprised him then, to find that he could not espy a single horse or suit of armor from his vantage point overlooking the north. Instead, all he found to challenge his gaze was a single black speck, standing atop the castle's back gate so that their entire body was in view.

""King Xandrel! Remove yourself from your castle and surrender at my feet, or I shall smite you where you stand, and blood will pour like a fountain from your neck!""

The king considered this. Briefly.

""No.""

His voiced was raised just loud enough, he felt, to reach the speck at the gate. He felt no need to strain himself further. A light crust was still stuck to his eyelids, but he was too lazy to wipe it away. The speck, on the other hand, was screaming at the top of its lungs.

""A pox upon you, Your Vile Majesty! Do I look as though I am one to be trifled with?""

""You look to me as though you are a speck. I cannot see well from here.""

""Dare you insult me to my face?!""

""I have not insulted. I am simply stating fact."" He wiped at his eyes at last, becoming acutely aware of a building headache between them. ""I would very much like to go back to sleep, sir. I was having the most delightful dream-""

""Your dreams are as your countenance, sir, full of tyranny and fat!""

""My dream involved rabbits.""

""I aspire to loftier goals! My dreams are of vengeance, and justice for the denizens of Alyrie!""

The king's brain began to itch. The speck was mad, that much was certain, but there was some odd quality to its madness that resisted classification.

""I say,"" said the king, ""be you male or female? You speak with the power of a man, yet your voice is quite high-""

""Dare you insult me to my face?!""

""I have already answered-""

""I am, and always have been, a member of the fairer sex! I will not be mistaken for the common brutish male!""

That was it, then. Madmen were common, a mad*woman* exceedingly rare. If not for the level of noise she would continue to make, King Xandrel would have been content to leave her at the gate and go about the rest of his day. But as such, she would have to be dealt with.

""Today shall be the first day of the *Queendom* of Alyrie! I demand the unconditional surrender of your army!""

""You wish to battle my army?"" The king shook his head at this. ""Would you not like to start with a smaller regiment? There is only one of you, after all.""

""There will be no battle! No man who has fought me has lived to tell the tale!""

The king had no answer to this bewildering claim, and thus elected to ignore it. ""Wait there, and I will send out three of my Royal Guard.""

""You mock me, Your Vile Majesty! I shall have no less than five battalions!""

""A dozen of my Royal Guard, then.""

""Six battalions!""

""Milady, be reasonable!"" The king gestured inside the castle. ""It would take hours to assemble such a fleet. My time is valuable, and I am sure yours is as well.""

The speck considered this. Briefly.

""Two dozen Royal Guard!""

""Very well. Be patient while they are gathered.""

The king stepped away from the balcony and crossed his bedchamber to reach the door. Outside stood two of his sentries, as well as the king's page.

""Your Majesty,"" asked the page, ""what commotion is that outside?""

""A madwoman has lodged herself by the gate and wishes to fight the entire army of Alyrie by herself. I have bartered her down to two dozen of the Royal Guard. See to it that she is arrested and placed in the stocks until evening."" He paused. ""Be gentle with her, of course.""

Dutifully, the sentries went out to round up the required forces. The king entered his room again, followed closely by the page. 

""I have prepared the day's events for your consideration, Your Majesty. Would you like them read?""

""I suppose. The madwoman has ruined my sleep after all."" The king peered down from the balcony. ""My eyesight is going in my old age. Can you describe her for me?""

""Of course, sir."" The page leaned over, supported by the railing of the balcony. ""She is very much a waif of a woman, sir. Quite thin.""

""Hmm.""

""Dressed quite like a rogue, or a thief. All leather and metal. And quite an excellent cape, I must say.""

King Xandrel's brain began to itch again. ""She is well dressed?""

""Exceedingly so.""

""Where does a madwoman obtain such finery?""

Before the page could hazard a guess, one of the Royal Guard spoke from below. ""You there! Come down from that wall.""

""You dare give me an order?""

""By order of the king, you are to be arrested and placed in the stocks-""

""HERE is what I think of your stocks!""

At once, flashes of sparkling gold light emanated from her hands. The Guard were first enthralled, then panicked, as tongues of fire and bolts of lightning struck each soldier in the chest.

""Witch!"" the king screamed. ""WITCH! Summon the Royal Mages at once!""

""She has already entered the castle!"" It was true. A blaze of purple flew directly into the castle's back door, and the bewitched members of the Royal Guard followed her with an otherworldly speed.

""Then time is of the essence! Go!"" King Xandrel shoved the page out the door. The page left his sight around one corner just as the witch (no longer a speck, but a woman of rather imposing height) came about the other. As he watched, she continued to fire her magic indiscriminately, striking several more soldiers as well as a handmaiden carrying the king's breakfast. Each fell in line behind the witch as she backed the king into a corner.

""I, Frieda Hellsworth, Witch of the Far North, Scourge of Men and Champion of Justice, hereby claim the Queendom of Alyrie as my own. Long may I live!""

The king sat on the floor and began to whimper.

""Your kingdom,"" she continued, ""shall be but the first of my conquests! All lands ruled by men are mine for the taking! Now begins the delightful rule of womankind on the throne!""

""I beg your pardon?""

""And you shall have it!"" With a wave of her hand, the forces of her magic held the king aloft as she turned to exit the hall. ""After announcing my claim to the Queendom, you shall have the honor of accompanying me on my next conquest! Come along, Your Former Vile Majesty!""

With that, she launched into a brisk march to the throne room. All the soldiers made way for her as she passed, their faces lit by an uncommon gold pallor. And the king was dragged behind, helpless to watch, and hoping that this was all a very bad dream.

""Your silence does you no good, sister."" Molten iron was brought to her face, flushing her cheeks and burning her hair. She resisted the overpowering urge to scream. ""This does not end pleasantly for you. Tell me where to find the Talisman.""

*The body is tempted yet spirit endures.* Her breath grew calm as the brand, held by strong hands and merciless men, pressed into skin like hooves in clay. No words were uttered to her brother, or to the Royal Guard standing by, defiling the throne room with her torture. The mantra warmed and cooled her thoroughly, and she began to focus her energy, not on resistance to the biting pain, but rather on drawing strength from within. 

*When body collapses, the spirit lives on.*

Teivels leveled his gaze upon the guards. The captain backed away with apparent trepidation as faint light emanated from the girl. ""You dare to stop your holy task?""

""Serafim is stronger than expected, Your Majesty."" The captain kneeled low before the king. ""Even now, her wounds heal faster than-""

""You are as incompetent as they come!"" He scoffed, standing from his ornate chair. ""Her ability to heal is nothing compared to the might of the Great Entrancer! Surely under the influence of my power, she will submit the Talisman to us!""

The captain winced as Teivels raised a hand, and deadly force began to flow. Where blood once ran in their veins, black hot fury coursed through the guards. They screamed viciously as their strength increased. Each was a husk of their former selves, driven mad with the King's power.

""Tell us where to find the Talisman."" The request was given again, more forcefully. It echoed through the mouths of soldiers, connected unwaveringly to Teivels' strange, dark magic. The brand was reheated in the forge, but already Serafim's soul felt slightly weak. The intonation slowed to a sickening crawl in her mind, retreating from his force. She begged herself to continue and endure, but a strike against fresh skin ended her resolve as a fire ends paper.

She screamed then, a loud, arduous cry. Her brother grinned wickedly at the sound. She no longer felt the iron chains holding her to the floor below him. In fact, not even the brand remained. All she felt was her oppressor's presence. It ate at her, inside and out, and as she screamed more of that presence poured into her body like acid.

""They called me a plague on humanity."" The king stepped forward, though his voice could clearly be heard through his servants. ""They vilified the Seventh Son of Soren, and praised heaven for the Seventh Daughter. But now, here we are, dear sister. The victory will be mine at last.""

She could barely speak through the haze. ""The victory will never be yours, brother.""

""You only speak when hope leaves you."" Another step brought more dark weight crashing down around her as her breathing strained. ""I know you, you small, pitiful girl. You are no challenge to my rule.""

*""She is an adversary worthy of battle.""* She recited the words from old memories. *""Her body is tempted, her spirit endures. When body collapses, her spirit fights on.""* She smiled grimly as her brother paused. ""You think that is not a challenge?""

""You believe the words of old fools."" He spat on the ground before his feet, and his soldiers did the same. ""They saw the extent of my glorious rule, and selfishly threw you against me. Their deaths were deserved, yours is not.""

He leaned in close, continuing his tirade through the mouths of the Royal Guard as the pressure drove her to tears. ""And when the Seven Seers of Soren relented, the truth was revealed to me. You will die here, in this room, unless the Talisman is revealed to me.""

Hot tears streamed down her charred skin. ""I will never relent to your darkness. You are nothing but an arrogant liar.""

He nodded, as if to say *indeed.* ""I could never fool you, could I? You will die regardless of your cooperation.""

All at once he unsheathed his sword. The Royal Guard failed to imitate his action, however, as he withdrew his power from their souls to power his attack. They fell, and he rose, the blade turning to indelible shadow in his hands. WIth one blow, Serafim's head was removed.
***
*Her body was tempted, yet she endured.*

Her spirit stood tall, surrounded by mystics. She was dead, that much was certain. But as sure as the Seven Seers of Soren's spirits gave her the strength, she was certain she would be victorious.

*When body collapses, her spirit is victorious.*

###Chapter Thirteen - Dicktophercolumbus
 
Eric jumped as Naomi – no, Morgan – popped out of the disconcerting black pit in the middle of the sidewalk. How was she doing that? One minute there and the next minute not, this weird black absence the only evidence in her wake. It was downright confusing and something about the empty spaces she left behind seemed so wrong.

Eric’s musings were interrupted by the disgruntled mutters of the filthy teenaged girl Morgan was towing behind her. The girl’s clothing was torn and covered in filth, she also smelled of rotten goulash and forsaken cabbages.

“Got her,” Morgan smiled. The girl frowned at Morgan’s back, clearly irritated at being dragged around by the elbow like a young child at a festival.

“Who are you and what the hell did you just do? That felt awful,” the girl struggled to yank her arm away from Morgan, but Morgan held on, her smile growing sharp.

“No need to struggle. We won’t hurt you, you’re very important to Syr Kupra after all.” Eric frowned at his former wife. The concern that had been pooling in the back of his mind intensified. This was not Naomi. Certainly Naomi had been strong-willed and passionate, but Morgan’s behavior was more calculating. Colder. Naomi had never been interested in religion; she was hardly even interested in the rule of the kingdom. Before the accident Eric and Roland had quietly agreed that he would run the minutiae while Naomi pursued her passions. Naomi’s passions had been simple: adventure and her people. She had never shown any interest in the rules, the religion, or the politics. She had definitely never shown any interest in power. Now Morgan flaunted her ability to leap into seething black pits and drag young women around and followed a man with a suspiciously Aeyshurian name. Syr Kupra, it sounded so familiar…

From behind Eric, John gasped, “I thought I recognized you. You’re that missing girl. Erica? No Ander?” he circled around Eric and began walking towards Enid and Morgan. The girl looked at him with cautious hope.

“It’s Enid. You mean I’m in the right world? I can go home? I’ve been blinking everywhere but the world has always been a little wrong. Your crazy black hole must have fixed it. Now I can go home and…”

“No.” Morgan interrupted Enid’s frantic babble. “You’re coming with us. You’re an important part of Syr Kupra’s plan, my plan. We must have the Prophet.”

Eric stared at the strange woman in front of him in shock. His Naomi would never keep a young girl from her mother. His Naomi would never follow a religious fanatic with the most idiotic Aeyshurian name blindly. This was not his Naomi, Naomi was dead and this Morgan thing was using her body. Eric had a strong feeling that Morgan’s plans did not factor in Enid’s interests in the slightest.

“No! You won’t let me go? Screw you.” The girl screwed her eyes closed, a piece of matted brown hair flopping over her face. She opened them and gasped. “You’re blocking me! You evil bitch; let me go!” Each word escalated in volume until the girl was screaming. Eric felt all of concerns, his frustrations coming to a boiling point. 

“Naomi what are you doing?” he spoke firmly, pushing his discomfort aside. “This girl is missing. We should take her home to her mother. The girl clearly wants to see her. I don’t think it’s right to keep her from her home”

“Eric, sweetheart,” Morgan responded patiently “I’ve been commanded by Syr Kupra to retrieve this girl. Are you suggesting that I ignore those orders?”

“Are you suggesting we take a missing girl and turn her into a kidnapped one?”

“It’s Enid, not ‘This Girl’” Enid interrupted irritably. She tried to slip her arm from Morgan’s grip. Based on Enid’s pained expression Morgan’s hold on her was growing to bruising tension.

Morgan raised an eyebrow, ignoring Enid’s efforts. “Eric,” she murmured soothingly “can’t you see that makes our work even easier? She’s already missing, we’ll just be making it more… permanent.”

Enid paused her struggle to stare at Morgan in horror. “What exactly does that mean?” she asked coldly.

Morgan looked benevolently down at her, “You’re part of the plan dear. Don’t worry about the little details.”

“Naomi, what is wrong with you? You’re saying you’re going to just take this girl and do Aeyshur knows what to her consequences be damned?”

Morgan’s eyes went cold; all vestiges of warmth drained away leaving only icy emerald shards in their place. “I told you to call me Morgan you useless fool! Oh Eric darling, the only reason I wanted you to follow me into this life was because you were so intelligent and yet so very pliable. You just love me so much. You think I have any use for you beyond your pathetic devotion? Now I see you ask too many questions. So sorry darling, I suppose I should have just let you die.” She raised a pointed finger to him and began murmuring under her breath.

Eric looked at her in horror. Whatever she was doing it did not look good. Enid still struggled futilely at her side. Eric realized this might be his only chance to get out of whatever nightmare this was. He ran towards Enid and tackled her away from Morgan.
“Go, GO NOW!” He screamed.

Enid screwed her eyes shut and Eric drowned in the scent of cinnamon.
***
Morgan glared angrily at the spot on the pavement where Enid and Eric had blinked away.

“John?” Her voice was deadly calm. “Why did you feel the need to tell our Prophet where she was?”

John shuffled nervously from foot to foot, “Well, I ah, you know. I recognized her, and ah, it caught me by surprise…”

Morgan turned and slapped him as hard as she could. John snapped his head back in her direction and stepped towards her menacingly. He had been chased, hypnotized by that black ball, manipulated by that useless two-bit swindler, and now he had had enough. He stepped towards Morgan menacingly.

“Listen lady, if it wasn’t for that damn package and Jack’s promise of a good payout I wouldn’t even be here. But things haven’t been going my way lately and…”

“Here we are!” Jack finished hurriedly. “Now we just have to find our young protégé…again.”

But Morgan wasn’t listening. She leveled an icy gaze at John.

“What package?” she asked, a sickeningly false sweetness imbuing her words.
***
Eric groaned, and sneezed, and groaned again. Everything reeked of cinnamon.

Enid sat next to him, looking at him with concerned brown eyes from beneath her matted hair.
“Are you ok? I didn’t even know I could do that.”

Eric rubbed the back of his head and nodded slowly. Everything had been so strange in the past eight hours. He was dead, but not dead. His wife had been possessed by some kind of manic fanaticism for an Aeyshurian official. He had tackled a teenage girl and been tumbled through a bag of cinnamon like a slice of well-seasoned peach and dropped… Somewhere else?

Eric took stock of his surroundings. They were in a grove at the bottom of a steep incline covered in foliage. There was a weird haze in the air and a palpable sense of tension. No birds flew through the air, no insects buzzed, and the whole landscape seemed to be holding its breath. From the corner of his eye, Eric thought he saw odd black spots blinking through the air. He shook his head to clear it and focused on where they were presently. It was clear they had landed in some kind of dry wash between hills, the crushed bush he found himself sitting in smack dab in the middle of the absent stream.

“Where are we?”

“I’m not sure. I fell, and then I was dead. I couldn’t find my way back to the world I was in before. The world the crazy redhead was in. I think we’re back in the world where I was dead,” Enid replied, long pauses accentuating her uncertainty.

“Oh,” Eric replied. He felt stupid with information. Normally a man of reasonable intelligence he felt every cognitive gear come to a grinding halt. Then, shockingly, he felt tears coming down his cheeks. Eric had not cried when Naomi died, he had not cried when he received his death sentence, he had not cried when he realized Naomi was dead in spirit if not in body. He cried now, huge choking sobs of a man bereaved of all he held dear.

Enid looked at him in frank horror, but Eric could not stop himself. Like most, he was not an attractive crier. Snot bubbled and drool collected. Enid pulled a grimy handkerchief from her pocket and silently passed it over. Accepting the atrocious piece of fabric silently, Eric blew his nose with a honk.

“Thanks,” he muttered.

“Sure,” Enid replied.

“Ok, we need a plan. What do we know? Where do we go from here?”

“What the hell is going on?” Enid supplied.

“Let’s start with what we know. First, you’re important. You’re a Prophet. I don’t know what that is but it must be important, Morgan really wanted to hang on to you. She prayed before she went to go get you, to a man named Syr Kupra. Kupra is a very familiar name to me. I think he may have been from my world,” Eric mused slowly.

“What world?” Enid inquired.

“I am from the country of Yorst, it is bordered by…”

“Yorst! I know that name,” Enid interrupted excitedly. “When I was a little girl my father went crazy. He said he was ruling a kingdom in another world. He disappeared when I was twelve, said he couldn’t handle the stress of caring for another baby. We always thought he just ran off,” 

Eric frowned, “Yorst is bordered by a group of countries ruled by a sect called the Disciples of Aeyshur. Kupra is a name that could very well have come from one of those countries.”

“I’ve heard of Aeyshur before too. My dad used to say ‘In the name of Aeyshur, Enid what on earth are you doing?’ whenever I was out too late exploring. My dad’s name was Roland. At least in this weird alternate universe where he had a freaking kingdom,” Enid interrupted again.

Eric looked at her, “Roland? King Roland? Your father is King Roland?”

“Yes, at least I think so. I always thought that my dad was just making excuses for crapping out on the whole parenting thing, but what if Yorst is real?” Enid replied, excitement beginning to seep into her voice.

“It is real! I’m from there, I was the prince regent. My wife Naomi, Morgan, died in that world and somehow showed up in your original world, correct? I was executed in my world and then followed her to yours as well. Now we’re… here. Where is here though? We’re neither in your world nor are we in mine, it doesn’t feel like home to me,” Eric felt the unused parts of his brain beginning to warm again, to move and shift.

“This is the weird world, I’m dead here and everything is just a little different. And they can make clones so they’re more advanced than us,” Enid replied.

“What is a clone?” Eric asked, derailed by the unfamiliar word.

“It’s like an exact copy of you as a human being, they take your DNA and replicated it and,” Enid stopped, trying to explain genetics to someone from a world that still had kingdoms and religious fanatics probably wouldn’t understand double helixes and mutations. “Never mind, it’s not important. We’re not in your world and we’re not in mine.”

“That means that this is a third world, a new world. And you can move between worlds yes?” Eric asked. He could feel a plan starting to form. It would be a long shot but it would at least be a starting point for future endeavors. At best, Morgan meant to use the girl and keep her from her mother. At worst… No use considering what his lost wife meant to do with Enid. He had an idea. “How do you move?”

Enid considered his question, “Well I close my eyes and think of this lullaby. It’s old, from when my grandparents first came to my home. I didn’t even realize it had anything to do with my blinking at first, but I noticed when we escaped Crazy Ginger that it was there the whole time.”

 Eric winced at the unflattering characterization of Morgan. Unflattering, but not unfair “Ok, what next?”

“I wake up in a new place, I can direct it a little by imagining certain things. I imagined a motel I’d been to before and ended up there.”

“If I describe a place to you, could you imagine it and take us there?” Eric asked urgently.

“I don’t know,” Enid replied uncertainly “Maybe?”

“Well maybe isn’t good enough Enid, we need to have a plan and we need to know your abilities,” Eric snapped.

“Yes I can do it. If you give me enough detail and maybe pray a little that we don’t end up in the middle of the ocean!” Enid replied irritably. She was surprised that he had used her name.

“Ok Enid, here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to Yorst; I need to speak with King Roland. If he really is your father he has the same abilities. He may know more about what is happening. I’m going to be honest he doesn’t particularly like me. He thinks I’m the one responsible for Naomi’s death, I was put to death because of his suspicions.”

“Did you kill her?” Enid asked with typical teenage frankness.

“No! But I did see her die we were alone on a mountain trying to commune with my deceased mother.”

“Why? That seems like twisting the knife a little,” she replied.

“I needed closure, this isn’t important stop straying from the task at hand.” Eric responded irritably.

“Describe where you want to go and I will take us there. Or I’ll take us to the middle of an alligator infested swamp and we’ll be mauled. But since we’ve had so many lovely surprises today I’m hoping we’ve exhausted our supply.”

“For the love of Aeyshur, some optimism would be ideal.” He snapped.

“Aeyshur? I thought you said that the other countries worshipped him.”

“No, I said they were religious fanatics. Stop stalling Enid we need to leave. Who knows how long it will take before Crazy Ginger finds us? Do you want to be here when she arrives?”

“You’re right. I do not want to see that woman again,” she closed her eyes. “Start talking Prince Regent. I need details here.”

###Chapter Fourteen - The_1ceman &amp; Aelintari

As he walked through the camp of Trimehk believers, he couldn’t help but feel disappointment. It had been months since he took over in the hunt of Kal Kupra and yet, nothing. Texts and writings, most of which had nothing to do with anything, were all they could find. Some texts did seem to give insight as to what the former Inquisitor had done and what he was currently doing, but Yhuvon was growing impatient.

“Inquisitor Prime,” one of the many under his command approached Yhuvon and dropped to his knees. “We’ve found some more writings and pamphlets, but none of these heretics seem to know of Kal Kupra or his whereabouts.” Yhuvon made no acknowledgement of the man or his words. His gaze scanned the camp and what was left. In the views of the Temple, the Trimehki and their God, Trimehk, were viewed as the Prime Evil. While Trimehk’s original teachings were viewed as a study in nature, both of the world and human, this camp used their beliefs as an excuse to do anything they wanted, with anything or anyone. The teachings of Trimehk, the God of Men, would have you believe that you should enjoy what little time you have in the mortal realm, to be of free and individual thought. Though the public opinion of Trimehk is dismissive, neither good nor bad, the Temple is quite strict on their views of the Trimehki.

“Gather all of the texts no matter how irrelevant they seem and bring them back to the camp and directly into my tent. No one else is to set eyes on them.” Yhuvon began walking away from the camp, planning his next move, his next attempt at recovering more of Kupra’s intentions.

“Inquisitor Prime, the Trimehki?” Yhuvon paused, his mind returning to the current situation. Although the Trimehki of this camp had done well to keep themselves at a distance from cities and villages, they had come under direct contact with the Temple. Granted, that was no fault of their own, but the circumstances of their discovery mattered little in the Temple’s eyes.

Yhuvon returned his gaze to the Inquisitor. “The followers of Trimehk are chaotic and under the assumption they have no need to follow rules and order. Offer them the chance at redemption, in this life or the next.” Yhuvon walked towards his horse, leaving his men to clean up the camp. He had a long evening ahead of him, sifting through the blasphemous writings and deciphering any meaning they might have. Before he had reached his tent, Yhuvon’s attention was distracted by a rather loud Trimehki.

“Kupra? He doesn’t call himself that anymore. I heard another whisper about a runaway going by Eldaref, about his hideaway.” Yhuvon walked as quickly as he could towards the Trimehki and the Inquisitor who was questioning him. As he approached, the Inquisitor dropped to his knees, but his attention was to the heretic. 

Yhuvon analyzed the heretic, he did not have the typical look of his kind. He was fine-boned, perhaps not as gluttonous as the others, though with times as they were even the king kept short rations. Given his lighter skin tone he must shy away from the sun too. “Details, now, and you will not be punished like the others.”

As the smell of cinnamon faded, Enid and Eric found themselves in the middle of a courtyard, next to a fountain that was all too familiar to Eric. Birds chirped in the distance and there was a jovial tune to the children that ran about.

“Wow, this place seems so peaceful.” Enid picked herself up and began to brush away at the trimmings that had latched on. As she looked around, she found herself wishing she could come here more often. For some reason, it felt like home to her. She looked over to Eric who seemed to still be shaking off the effects of their blink. “Eric, are you okay?”

“Eric?!” A voice jumped from the other side of the fountain. “There is no one here of that name anymore! Who dares bring that name up in my pre­” A face rose to accompany the rather angry voice. It was a face that Enid had seen before.
***
Yhuvon had finished pouring over all of the writings gathered from the Trimehki camp. There was very little that hadn’t already been confiscated and analyzed, but every little bit of information mattered. Yhuvon grew frustrated. Surprisingly, the frustration also was directed at the Temple. Even as Inquisitor Prime, he still reported to the Temple and his moves had to be approved. If he was given the same freedom that Kupra had been given in his endeavours, he may have made some actual progress by now.

However, he knew even having these thoughts were blasphemous and could lead him down the same path and into the same temptations as Kupra.

The decision for him to pursue Kupra was very contested by the Elders of the Temple. Some were of the thought that Kupra would find his own demise as Aeyshur would never allow someone to abandon the Temple without punishment. Others feared that in chasing after one infidel, especially one that was studying such heretical teachings, would open up other Inquisitors to follow in Kupra’s footsteps. Yhuvon was able to convince enough of the Temple Elders that sending him was the only way this pursuit would succeed.

Before becoming Inquisitor Prime, Yhuvon gained his respect in the Temple as an Ordinator for his dedication to Aeyshur and in hunting those who had lost their way. Yhuvon did not always agree with the actions or decisions of those in the Temple, but he always believed that Aeyshur would guide him no matter what path he chose or was told to take. It was because of his faith he had yet to be tempted with anything that had come across his path in his hunt for Kupra or any of his followers. The same could not be said for some of those who joined him in his hunt. He personally saw to the execution of five that had fallen in their faith. As he returned his thoughts to the matter at hand, noise from outside his tent caught his attention.

“Inquisitor Prime! Inquisitor Prime!” As Yhuvon opened his tent, one of his Inquisitors fell to his knees to address his superior. “Inquisitor Prime! Urgent word from the Temple. You are to leave for Yorst at once. It seems blasphemous for me to even say, but word is that two people appeared out of thin air into the courtyard. The Elders believe this may be in connection to Kupra and his sudden disappearance.” The Inquisitor waited for Yhuvon to give his permission for dismissal, but none came. Yhuvon was already gathering his belongings for his departure. “Inquisitor Prime?” The man asked out, trying not to come across as questioning of his superior’s actions.

“You may go. Thank you for your haste. Have my horse ready as soon as possible.” Yhuvon scrambled to pack anything he could remember as relevant. He had a feeling that this trip might finally be the break he had been searching for. “Finally Kupra. You have either slipped up or Aeyshur has finally decided your wrongdoings must come to an end!”

 Eldaref held his pale hand over the sphere, feeding it with himself. With his other hand, he scrawled the codes it fed him in turn. The creatures of the night began to howl, some in unison but most to their own timing. For all intents and purposes night was no longer ushered in by a sleeping sun but the noise from the throats of animals unknown in any texts, with false experts rushing to catalog them. He tried to distinguish if their calls were different. Where they beasts of many or many of one beast? Eldaref pinched the wick to kill the light, they could sense unnatural light, he had so little time left to finish with the scrolls. In a moment the walls, by day painted in rays of bright orange, yellow, and green with tapestries of like colors appeared bare.

“Is this anything like the darkness to come?” he wondered. “No, that is worse.” With great care Eldaref felt for the parchment, a pool of wet ink, and, placing his pen on the mark, he continued to write until he finished the scroll. Convinced the ink was dried he rolled it closed, affixed a number to the front, and hid it in the lining of his cloak. When he moved he could hear the soft rustle of the pages. They gave him ease for the few lonely hours of night left. The beasts began to quiet down, their noise reduced to snarls and snorts. Eldaref thought it strange the night had already so grown old.

It hadn’t.

At first it sounded like crinkling. Eldaref leaned on his stomach, worried his body was betraying the scrolls. But the sound continued and intensified, scraping now. Digging. He hoped it was the shufflers, come to move him to a new location. He had been here too long already and safety does not come to those who dally. But Eldaref knew ‘truth’ and ‘hope’ were often opposed and in his mind there was only the face of Yhuvon. There was nowhere to escape to, nowhere the moles wouldn’t sniff him out of. He chose to be buried alive in this cave for secrecy and protection but both sometimes cost more than their worth. He wouldn’t let himself be caught like a shamed harlot, not now when his name ­ old and new ­ meant questioning the order. And it could still be the shufflers.

Eldaref fingered the papers, his heartbeat slowing as he did, muttering the last riddle: “Three keys there are, but for one door, the sacrifice will turn it.”

They were just above him now. He could hear their strained breath. Eldaref counted the cracks in the peeling ceiling. Seven. He watched as the pickaxe cleared through. It was still dark out so there would be nothing to blind his sight. Eldaref counted his blessings. The sphere above all had to be kept out of their reach. Hide it in plain sight, he decided. He chucked the sphere at the first man who poked in his head. The man groaned and yelled at the others. Eldaref grabbed the sphere and threw it again. His blood had made the sphere strong. It hit another guard’s shins as he made his way in. And then all too quickly the guards were there, pickaxes being the dullest of their weapons. He saw one of the guards, a young blood whose face was still naked, throw the sphere away outside the cavern. “Hit me again,” he taunted. Guards were not supposed to speak.

Eldaref heard Yhuvon before he could see him but knew the Elder Inquisitor was smiling.

“Seize him, remove his cloak.”

He didn’t struggle now, not with their poisoned spears aimed at his throat.

“Anything to say for yourself?” Yhuvon was always one for following protocol. “Justice only comes to those who serve the Aeyshur true.” He waved the guards to exit with their captive.

Eldaref soaked in the fresh night summer air. He knew it would be long until he would be free to do so again, if ever.  He regretted only the temporary loss of the sphere, which would have benefitted greatly from the bloodletting that lay ahead. It was necessary, better the sphere to be no one’s again then fall under the wrong will.

Even though the land was flat the wagon jostled at every asymmetry in the terrain. The cage was not fitted for a man so Eldaref sat huddled in it, the iron boring into his flesh. At night both the cage and creatures clawed at him. The creatures especially enjoyed him; they preferred to munch on live prey. In the end what difference was there between the bite of metal, or bone and nail with ill will? By the next night, his stomach growled from hunger with the creatures.  Once he feared and hoped the beasts would knock the entire cage off the wagon but they had since been built to prevent that. Eldaref could not lift his face from the floor of the cage. He had his nose and his ears, though. The sounds in the villages were muted. Had so much changed in so little time? The air soured also. The typical scent of burned foliage and wood was masked by a vile odor. He knew the smell. It’s one he could never mistake for another. Charred human flesh and hair. Eldaref choked on it and buried his nose deeper into his chest to keep from losing consciousness. The sound of the running river crying out woke him. “Join us,” the waters said as they passed Founder Bridge. It was made of strong oak but was well past its prime. Eldaref and the guards clenched onto what they could until they were on the other side. 

By morning the wheels of the wagon rolled more smoothly, they were on the main road now. Besides the guards, there was still not another human soul he could sense. Eldaref remembered how the streets would line with merchants and people of all craft specialties as criminals were brought for justice. Eldaref was one of the onlookers once, many moons ago. But here there was no business being conducted, no loud indiscernible chatter.

They came to a halt at Aeyshur’s pillar. Eldaref was shoved into the Inquisition Tower, his body still rolled in on itself as though the cage were invisible, like the night animals, around him. Around the interior of the chamber were frescos, the best artists from the realm wished to put their work here. On the ceiling a giant eye of Aeyshur stared down at Eldaref. Even now he could not deny the craftsmanship that went into every stroke of the forest green iris, a work that could take one artist a lifetime to complete, though it meant little else to him.

Near him but just beyond reach, hung a sausage. For a moment he held back, but even he only had so much strength. Eldaref reached for it despite its distance. His fingers just grazed it before the string was pulled higher. He licked them clean, his mouth so dry it welcomed the taste of his skin even if the only meat flavor was his own. He would reach again when the string was lowered. It could not be helped.

Eldaref did not remember closing his eyes. When they opened Yhuvon stood smug before him. Was it day or night? Eldaref pondered.

“We’ve destroyed it all,” Yhuvon said, throwing him a bone with many trimmings. Eldaref sunk his teeth into it, sucking the juice. It was fresh. When he could finally lick his lips again Eldaref wanted to cry for the burned scrolls, the ink from his veins that he poured into them.

“Enjoy that, meat is scarce these days.” Yhuvon walked closer, fearing only the wrath of Aeyshur. “By the grace of Aeyshur I am Inquisitor Prime and I will do my duty against idolatry. Tell me, Syr Kal Kupra, did you plan to take the power for yourself?”

Mere days ago Eldaref would have laughed at the silly suggestion.

“You, not even an Elder.” Yhuvon circled around him,smiling with those thin red lines that passed for lips stretching across his face. “You will help me make it as though all this has never been. Help me to restore the lost.”

“I have not been called Syr Kal Kupra in a long time, someone saw to that.” Eldaref whispered, his throat sore with neglect of use. “I cannot change the past, nor do I wish to. The truth will come, even Aeyshur will fall before it.” He paused then to catch his breath. “What lost?” He thought again of the scrolls, of how even the tiniest flame could destroy those many hours of labor.

Yhuvon clenched his teeth. “Apostate Eldaref is it? You really do want the powers of an Elder don’t you? Your name has no power here. You are a thing, a means to an end.”

“All names have power. What lost?”

“Your heathen work unleashed these invisible monsters on my realm. Fools worship you. You! ‘Syr Kal Kupra’ they chant, ‘SYR’. But it is I who work to tame the beasts for my subjects. Me and me alone.” Yhuvon looked deep into Eldaref’s bloodshot eyes. “We’ve learned the beasts don’t always kill and devour their prey, sometimes they carry them off. We’ve had disappearances. Many.” Yhuvon talked with his eyes admiring the paintings on the ceiling. “And now we hear of two people come from nowhere, I suppose also not your doing?”

“I unleashed nothing. Maybe you think of another Kal Kupra?” He continued to suck on the bone longingly. “The one who leaves holy scripture on impure carcasses? Oh I’ve heard the rumors about me. It won’t deter the people from the truth, try as you might. The truth is patient.” He looked again at the string of meat dangling in front of him. It looked so close. “I think you give me too much credit, I cannot control who goes in or out. When worlds fall there are tears, some big enough for souls to pass through. You must have read about that in some of my writing before you fed it to the fire.” Would he have really been able to destroy it all without a glimpse? Eldaref smiled at Yhuvon with a glint in his eye. 

“You are mad then. They are taken by the beasts, we have witnesses. We don’t know where or why.” Yhuvon motioned for the gate to be opened. “I’ll let you two get acquainted, don’t worry, it won’t kill you and there’s nowhere for it to take you either.” Before he left Yhuvon turned back to Kal Kupra. “By the way, don’t you wonder how we found you? Or how we know of the other 2 you allegedly have nothing to do with?”

Eldaref saw nothing at first and then he heard the grunts, still raindrops making their way toward him. He looked up to catch Aeyshur glaring back at him and the sausage, which had now been lowered.

It was night afterall. Always night.

Yhuvon sauntered back to his chamber. He knelt before the eye of Aeyshur. “Please Aeyshur, the scrolls are ash, now guide me again in these troubled times.” Yhuvon closed his eyes and clasped his hands together, “I look always for your signs. Help me.” Yhuvon looked at the icon. Long he waited motionless, his legs growing numb, to see if his prayer was accepted. He stood memorizing its details. There were soft wrinkles all around, not old yet but already past their youth. The eyelashes were long and straight, pointed out away from the wall. Largely they were a rich pine green but around the pupil he could make out a bright orange corona. There was wisdom in those eyes. Wisdom and power and something else. It watched Yhuvon, burrowing into his dark pits. He could feel it scanning him. Would it know? Then the eye blinked.
***
Across the River Fords, past the Eddy Baur, and just north of Aeyshur’s Granary a lone cloaked figure knocked where no door belonged. He could hear faint wails coming from within. “Ignore them,” he thought.

Once inside the man kept his eyes downcast, if not altogether closed.

“Well?”

The man stumbled forward. “He’s been taken. Syr Kupra is in the tower being questioned, as you said.”

“Then you’ve served your purpose.”

The man did not hear or did not understand. “Thank you, the rewar-­”

Before he could finish the hounds -­ if they were hounds, for he could not see them ­- were on him.

His hood was thrown back and for a few moments, as the blood and meat of his life left him, he stared at the face of his leader for the first time. Matted raven hair above eyes the color of blessed wheat. The pupils dark, against such pale skin, dark like the void. Those eyes, set somewhat slanted on the oblong face to appear kind and keen, turned from him then. It was unmistakably the face of the man in the Inquisition Tower.

“Kalll lll Kupppp”

“Kalll lll Kupppp”

The man died with his gargling voice echoing in his ears.

“Kalll lll  Kupppp”

“Kalll lll  Kupppp”

“Leave the rest,” Kal Kupra seemingly shouted at no one and nothing. He knelt by the corpse and began to write.

###Chapter Eleven - HoneypuffCereal
 
His mind started cracking everywhere, as if someone was puncturing his eye with a blender and mixing his brains. He sunk to his knees and held his head together, trying to prevent it from cracking in two. Memories unrelated to each other started to melt together as all sorts of words flood into his mind. Jal’Kaideen Ro Kreth. Mannaroth Yal’Jaidoch. We shall come. Drux Ro’an Ur Kreth. Prepare your world for our arrival. Aezizal Aliik Belial. We are the entities in the dark. Anzaar Ashur Drago Roth Parthaal. You belong to us now. Jal’Kaideen Ro Kreth. Jal’Kaideen Ro Kreth. Jal’Kaideen Ro Kreth. We are coming. What did they mean? Were they names? Were they sentences? Were they even words or were they just static of his brain trying to cope with whatever trauma just happened? What even happened? Those last words. They kept booming in his ears. Jal’Kaideen Ro Kreth. He tried to think of something else, but he couldn’t. It was everywhere. It was consuming him. He could barely breathe. He forced his eyes open. Look at anything, distract yourself, he thought. But he saw nothing. Did he go blind? An ominous rumbling shook his body as part of the darkness slid open to reveal a tiny, bleached oval hole in the darkness. It was far away, but it was unique amongst the total blackness he was surrounded in. he felt himself moving forward, and the oval became bigger and bigger. Before long it was his size, but it kept growing exponentially. It grew to the size of a skyscraper, and now he saw things moving in the oval. Small currents flowed though it, somewhat randomly but apparently symmetrically. In a way, it was haunting and beautiful, like watching gas flow across the surface of a gas giant. The rumbling stopped. He stared at the oval. He couldn’t move. Sometimes he felt hands gripping him, voices calling his name, but that felt as if it was in an entirely different life. With all his strength he could muster, he look around. More ovals are growing around him. They were forming a bubble, surrounding him on all sides. He felt closed off, and remember that he hadn’t breathed in a while. He tried to inhale but still couldn’t. It didn’t panic him, for some reason. By the time he had given up on breathing, he looked back at the oval in front of him.

Jal’Kaideen Ro Kreth.  

The oval stretched wider and starts shimmering. He looked at his hands. They were melting. He panicked. He needed his hands. He couldn’t do anything without his hands. He looked back at the oval. Was that thing doing that to him? He tried to ask it to stop, but it wouldn’t answer. He forgot that he couldn’t breath. How could he forget that? Now his feet are melting. He could feel the flesh melt from his bones. Why didn’t it hurt? He gave up. He couldn’t deal with this. He closed his eyes and surrendered.
***
Dron watched as Kasabian pressed the button on the machine, stiffened up and fell backwards on the floor with a thud. Dron rushed to his side and shook him.

“Kasabian, are you there? Hey, what happened?”

The Klaaxi pushed one of his eyelids open and saw that the scientist’s eye was rapidly shaking and looking at every direction. A seizure perhaps? What could have caused it?

He checked the display, but there was nothing on it.

“Shit, what do I do…”

A medical box on the wall near the door. Maybe that had something about people having seizures. Dron ripped the box from the wall. Gauze, needles, wire, a small bottle of 97% alcohol, and a tiny excuse for a book. Flying through the pages looking for seizures, Dron found out that people that lose consciousness needed to be placed on their sides so that they don’t choke on their tongues or the food that might crawl out of their stomachs into their throats. He rushed back and leaned Kasabian on his side. The scientist was still unresponsive. Call someone, Dron thought to himself. He reached the comm on his wrist and called the captain. Only now did he realise how much he had been sweating. Nothing this exciting and terrifying has happened to him before.

“Delvare here. This better be good.”

“Kasabian just fainted.” Dron blurted out, “He put the black orb thing in the machine pressed a button and just knocked out. His eyes are twitching and he’s not responding.”

“Does he have a pulse?”

Shit.

“Eh, how do I check that?”

“Insides of his wrist. Press your fingers on it. If you feel a pulse, he’s alive. Check the front right side of his neck, next to the adam’s apple. If you can’t feel a pulse there, try to reanimate him.”

Dron did what he was told. He didn’t know much about reanimation, but he was not looking forward going mouth to mouth with this guy. 

He felt a pulse. A very strong, very fast one.

“Captain? He has a pulse, but it feels really fast. Like, too fast.”

No response. Did the comms cut out? That’d be the last thing he needs right now.

“Alright, we’re coming in. Turn that machine off and be ready to move him.”

Help was on the way. Alright, that’s good. That meant that soon enough, he’d be out of this damned place and out there, where he could stretch his legs. Any minute now, and everything would be fine. 

Dron was so busy calming himself down that he didn’t realise that Kasabian had woken up. His irises were bleached.
*** 
Delvare, Vance and two other crewmates were closing in on the door with a brancard, and they were all sufficiently annoyed. Their break was interrupted by the captain because the Klaaxi had called in some emergency and that the science nerd had fainted. Vance guessed that some unknown excitement must’ve risen to his head. Must’ve been the first bit of excitement in his life since the last time he got laid.

“What do we know, captain?”

“Kasabian has a rapid, strong pulse.” Delvare said as she guided the men through the facility,

 “Eyes making uncoordinated movement. No tremors.”

“Seizure?”

“Could be, but Andron isn’t a very skilled medical examiner, so who knows what he missed. Be ready for anything.”

As they were approaching, they smelled something burnt.

“That’s not normal, is it?” Vance asked as he sniffed.

“No.”

“I hope that doesn’t have to do with anything uncontrolled. Fire hazard in this place can compromise a lot of shady stuff the boss doesn’t want the rest of the planet to know about. We could get fired.”

“I don’t plan on going anywhere Vance. Stay focused.”

Vance straightened up and kept the brancard moving. The closer they got to the lab, the stronger the burnt smell became. Delvare got the creeping feeling that they might have to open all the windows here. That could lead to compromises of security and local environment, and a lot to make up for financially.

They turned the corner and saw the cause for the smell. The grey security door had been slagged into molten steel, as if someone fired a rail gun to open the door. The path was clear enough to walk through, so Delvare pulled her G118X laser pistol out, held it in front of her and headed through the door. The lab looked relatively untouched, but whatever caused this to happen might still have been in here.

“Sweep the lab.” Delvare whispered to her men as they unholstered the weapons and entered the lab behind her. As the rest moved to her sides, she made a straight line towards the machine. She knew that the orb was worth a lot. Without the orb, there will be no chance to find the girl. If she doesn’t find the girl, she’s screwed big time. No one was around the machine, but smelt something coppery and charged in the air. Area around the machine was clear, and she checked the compartment. No orb.

“All clear here.” Vance said as he’d checked compound storage.

“Any sign of them?” Delvare asked out loud at her men.

“Found one.” One of her men answered.

She rushed over to him. Whoever it was better have some answers to what the hell happened here. The copper smell got stronger, and then she saw the source. It was Andron. The kid was completely covered in blood, a gaping hole in the side of his neck showing the source of the bleeding. Both of his eyes were missing, the flesh around them having been cut and jagged by something sharp The clothes of his chest had been cut away, exposing a freshly made set of wounds that formed words. Jal’Kaideen Ro Kreth. Not for away on the ground, a bloodied scalpel rested.

“Where is Kasabian?” Delvare asked curtly, steeling herself as she watched the corpse.

“Not in the lab. Just Andron. Poor kid. What the hell happened here?”

Delvare didn’t have time to mourn the kid. Kasabian went AWOL, killed one of her crew and took the orb. The question of how and why would come later. Other lives were at stake, and they might end up worse than Andron if she did not contain the situation right now. She tapped the number of the head of security. She walked out of the lab, ordering her men to secure the site again and call the morgue. Her comms jumped up and a stern sounding man answered.

“Captain Delvare, this is-”

“I don’t care who this is. We have a level 5 containment breach, lock the station down. No one goes in or out. We have a casualty in the research facility and the guy who killed him melted his way through the secured door. I want all personnel accounted for and a search warrant placed on Dr. Kasabian. Shoot to kill, I repeat, shoot to kill. Authorization: D456JRKR, effective immediately.”

She hung up, and five seconds later alarms blared, the windows to the outside world were closed, red lights started flaring in the halls ands speakers all over the station called for all personnel to call in with their supervisor immediately. This was going to get far worse before it gets better, Delvare thought as she headed for the command centre. She dreaded the call she had to make. Her boss was going to be furious.
***
Someone had activated the alarm. The station was going to be shut down. If only Kasabian had woken up before the ingrate had phoned everything in. But it would not matter. The power of the void would see him through this trial. He had to leave as soon as possible. The ship with which he arrived could be used to get away, but there were many others. The girl had to be found, but she would not be found through conventional means. He understood that now. She could not be found because she was everywhere and nowhere at the same time. That was what the orb was for. It could rewind her to a time where she couldn’t walk through dimensions. Where she was still only a girl. She was the Prophet of the Void. She had to be found. She had to herald their arrival. She had to be summoned. She had to be drawn. But first Kasabian had to leave this place. He had to go to the Cradle. There, he could draw her into the world before her power consumed her. She had to be found before others could take hold of her and guide her on the wrong path. The chasm had to be opened. Kasabian had the eyes, but he did not know whether or not they would suffice. The teeth, the teeth would be there. She would bring them. Kasabian had the ball. He could not be stopped. Not with the power of the void backing him. He would find the prophet. Jal’Kaideen Ro Kreth.

###Chapter Twelve - Caroz855

Enid yawned, stretching her arms as she sat up. She pushed the heavy blankets off herself and blinked sleep out of her eyes. Sunshine that streamed through the window lit the room, and for a second Enid forgot the events of the past two days.
But then she remembered.

The first night, the night she had been thrown out, she had considered finding a comfortable patch of dirt and just falling asleep there, but then she had realized: although she had only rarely used it, she and her father had built a treehouse in sixth grade as a way to bond. She had had a sleepover once, and they had kept the sleeping bags in the treehouse “just in case.”

As best she could, she blinked to her backyard, and there it was in all its glory: the treehouse. It was just as she remembered, on the tallest tree in the yard. She climbed quietly but quickly, hoping that no one would notice. At the top, Enid’s second prediction had come true. This alternate Enid and her alternate father had also left the sleeping bags there. Enid climbed into the biggest one and closed her eyes, and before she knew it she was asleep.

The next day, she thought about what she needed to do to survive. She looked into her house from the treehouse to make sure no one was around before she blinked to the street. She quietly walked in and stole a banana from the kitchen. After that, she hurriedly walked up the stairs to her room and stole a drawstring bag with the breast cancer ribbon on it. She didn’t remember ever going to any events centered around cancer awareness, but then again, this wasn’t her life she was taking from. She packed as much clothing as she could into the bag and cracked open her piggy bank from when she, or rather this other Enid, was younger. The alternate Enid certainly wouldn’t be needing it.

The rest of the day, Enid had practiced teleportation. She needed to know the limits of her powers. She blinked all over town before blinking back to the ravine. She tried to see how specifically she needed to think. Up there didn’t work, but the top of the ravine did.

At the end of the day, she had blinked to a motel in town. She had asked for a room for the night, and the man at the counter was all too happy to oblige until she pulled out her money.

“I’m sorry, miss,” he had said, “but we only accept American currency here.”

“Oh, sorry,” Enid had said quietly after a pause. She took out her emergency credit card — the one she had in her own universe — and paid with that instead. It seemed like her money wouldn’t work here. Good thing she had two credit cards, and her original seemed to work.

Enid disrobed and slipped into her room’s tiny shower. As the water streamed down her body, stinging a bit where she had cut her leg, she thought back to what was now her old life. Back in seventh grade, when she had only begun to rebel, she would shower before school and her mother would have breakfast waiting for her when she got dressed. A bowl of cereal and a glass of apple juice, the way she liked it. On weekends, her family would all sit together and talk about their weeks over stacks of pancakes or fruit salads or eggs. She and her mother had liked theirs over easy, and her brother was too young at that point to eat eggs, considering he hadn’t yet been conceived, but her father had preferred his scrambled.

Before he disappeared, that is. Near the end of his time with them, it was as if he had gone crazy. He spoke of a world all his own, a world where magic replaced science. Enid’s mother had suggested he write it down, maybe publish it, but her father wouldn’t have it. It’s real, he would reply. I can’t publish it as fiction. That wouldn’t be fair to my people.

He said he was the king of a land called Yorst. He said that Enid was there too, but different — instead of her olive skin and dark hair, inherited from her mother’s Italian roots, her father said she had hair the color of the sunset and her skin was the color of paper. He said that people called her Naomi there, but that he would sometimes get an urge to call her by her real name. Despite his family’s urgings, he insisted it was real, that he was somehow able to visit to a magical world where he had another family. Another Enid. And when Enid’s mother was pregnant, he finally broke. He said he couldn’t handle another baby while he had to rule over Yorst. And then one day, he just disappeared.

Suddenly, Enid’s head hurt. She remembered her life crystal clear — her father disappeared and she rebelled — but she also remembered another set of events. She remembered living in a world with advanced technology. She had lived on Earth, but she remembered that her aunt had lived on a moon of Saturn. But that couldn’t be right — both of her parents were only children. And how could someone live off-planet, never mind on one of Saturn’s moons? That wasn’t possible! But just yesterday Enid thought it wasn’t possible to teleport, and that misconception had quickly been broken, so why not extraterrestrial expansion?

There was just one problem. Enid didn’t know where the strange memories came from. They certainly weren’t hers, so whose were they?

Enid snapped out of her reverie when she heard a knock at the door. She quickly turned off the shower and got dressed after she dried herself. She opened the door to reveal the man behind the motel’s desk.

“I’m sorry, miss,” he said, “but you only paid for one night and check out ends at eleven. Unless you want to buy another night, I’m going to have to ask you to check out.”

Enid nodded. She closed the door and retreated into her room. She looked up; the clock told her that it was 10:54. As she packed her ragged clothes into her pink drawstring bag, the sharp pain came back. These clothes were the kind she wore, and yet she was disgusted at the thought of wearing them. She remembered wearing classier clothing — long, pastel dresses made of thin material. There was a metallic design on it — something abstract yet elegant. The metal also served as her comms; she was connected to her friends and family and could talk to them instantly regardless of distance. But it was more than that. It was essential. Without it, she would be as lost as a toddler in the woods.

Yet here she was. She had no comms. She also recalled voyaging through the woods around her town with nothing but her flip phone and flask. Who was this strange girl who had metal like a phone on her dresses and was disgusted at the sight of dirty clothes? Why was she in Enid’s head?

Enid shuttered and pushed the thoughts out of her mind. She needed to focus on the real world; she couldn’t let this strange symptom of the new world affect her.

Having finished packing, she took a deep breath. She wasn’t sure just what had happened to her, but she knew she had to do something about it. She confidently marched out of the motel room into her strange new world.

An acrid smell drifted into Enid’s nose. She started to gag, but forced her mouth closed at the thought of tasting such putrid air.

The air found its way into her mouth and she tasted it anyway.

Enid coughed and stumbled out of the alley she had blinked to, getting caught in the flow of people on the sidewalk. She had decided to see if the rest of the world was as different as her home town, and had blinked to New York City, or whatever this world’s equivalent was.

Enid was just a little bit surprised that she had even made it. She had only specified New York, so she didn’t expect to actually go anywhere, but it looked like it worked. She would still have to test her newfound skill.

She looked at the store she had blinked next to. It had a large electronic sign with a white background; purple symbols that Enid couldn’t understand but looked vaguely like letters she knew sat above black words that read, Baba Yaga’s Soviet Cuisine. At least rotting food explained the smell she had encountered.

Enid looked at the sky as she walked, attempting to discern a recognizable landmark. In the distance, she saw two skyscrapers she didn’t remember. Apparently, the World Trade Center had never fallen. To be honest, she didn’t really care all that much. She had heard about the attacks, of course, but she was much too young when they happened to be affected. Enid knew she would have to learn this world’s history at some point to discern the scope of the differences, but for now she wanted to explore. She knew she could probably blink to her destination, but she wanted to experience New York the old-fashioned way: by foot.

Suddenly, it hit her: she was in New York! The land of the unknown, where her wildest dreams could be accomplished. Across the street, there was an entrance to the subway. Enid scampered between cars and flew down the staircase in a burst of excitement.

The subway station was immaculate-- another difference. A blindingly shiny tile floor reflected the bright lights that lit the station. A small number of people stood scattered, waiting for the next train. A woman in a bright orange outfit and what appeared to be a blonde buzzcut sat in Enid took to be this world’s equivalent of an MTA information booth, separated from the rest of the station by a partition. The upper half was glass and the lower half was white tile.

Enid walked up to the woman. “Excuse me?” she said. “I was wondering if you had a map of the city.”

“Absolutely!” the woman responded cheerily. She reached below the glass and pulled out a pamphlet. She handed the pamphlet, which read Your Guide to Manhattan at the top, to Enid and asked, “Where are you headed?”

“I’m gonna walk to Times Square,” Enid replied.

The woman gave Enid a quizzical look. “Times Square? Do you mean Longacre Square?”

Another difference. Will they ever end? Enid asked herself, but of course she couldn’t answer. “Is that the one with all the billboards?” When the woman nodded, Enid thanked her and quickly left.

Unfolding the pamphlet, Enid quickly located Longacre Square. Using the street signs around her, she realized that she was almost a mile away. She considered taking the train, but wasn’t sure if she would even be able to buy herself a ticket. Who knew what wacky regulations this world had?

Sighing, Enid thanked herself for building her endurance during her long nighttime walks in the woods. She began her trek, double checking each turn so as not to get lost. She made sure to pay attention; that was what had gotten her into this whole mess, after all.

“Stop,” Morgan said. John took his foot off the pedal and the car lurched to a stop. Morgan opened the door and climbed out of the car.

“Hey!” Jack shouted. “Get back here! Where’d’ya think you’re goin’?”

“Where are you going, Naomi?” Eric asked, worried. “Naomi?”

Morgan didn’t listen. She could feel the next disciple. But something was wrong… There was another presence in the same space. How could that be?

She heard John grumble something about parking, whatever that was, and suddenly Jack and Eric were next to her.

“John, hurry up!” Jack shouted. Morgan barely heard him.

“Naomi —,” Eric started, but Morgan cut him off.

“I know you think that my name is Naomi,” she said angrily, “but that is the name of a past life. My name is Morgan now. Syr Kupra rechristened me when I became his servant, and I wish nothing but to fulfill my new purpose. So please,” she finished, “stop calling me that. I am not Naomi anymore.”

Eric’s face fell, but Morgan didn’t seem to notice. The disciple was very close. She could tell. She looked around wildly. Where are you? she thought. You are necessary for Syr Kupra’s plan. Stop hiding.

Suddenly, the presence was closer than it had been before. It almost felt like the disciple was on top of Morgan.

Then suddenly, she realized what she should do. She retreated into her mind, into Syr Kupra’s plane.

“My Heavenly Lord, Syr Kupra,” she prayed, “I am searching for your next disciple, but she is inhabiting another plane than I. I ask that you show me where she is, and allow me to travel there long enough to take her back with me.”

Morgan sensed that Syr Kupra approved, and suddenly she was gazing at the multiverse. She moved toward the disciple’s essence until she realized where the disciple was. No, it can’t be! she thought. I must hurry, lest the disciple ceases to exist.

“Thank you, My Greatness. I am ready to travel. Jal’Kaideen Ro Kreth.”

Morgan felt her power grow. She knew that she would be able to open a portal to the disciple’s location, but it would only remain for an instant. She would have to use Syr Kupra’s gift wisely or risk death at the hands of her fellow Void Crawlers.

She turned to her ragtag group. “All of you, stay here. I will not be long.” Before any of them could get a word in, she opened the portal and stepped through.

According to Enid’s calculations, she was smack dab in the middle of Longacre Square, so she looked up.

Her calculations were correct.

Enid’s eyes darted around the square. A look of wonder lit her face. It was more or less like she knew it — electronic ads dominated every free space. One caught her eye, however.

Want to spend a few more minutes with a loved one who’s passed on? Want one final night of passion with the one that got away? Whatever your reason, rent a Succubus today!

The ad piqued Enid’s interest. This seemed like it could be the biggest difference of all between her home and this world. She didn’t know what the Succubi were, but she wanted to know. She looked around and spotted a kiosk on the street with the words SUCCUBUS RENTAL in big letters above it.

Enid struggled past the crowd to the kiosk. She snatched a pamphlet from the kiosk and hurried off. She started to read it, but barely had time to read about the new Incubus unit before someone grabbed her arm.

Enid looked up while hurriedly stuffing the’ pamphlets in her pocket. She made eye contact with a beautiful woman. Her hair was a deep orange that would shame the sunset and her eyes were the color of the leaves in a spring forest.

When the woman didn’t say anything, Enid angrily asked, “What’s your problem?”

The woman just smirked. “I like your spirit, but your essence confuses me,” she said finally. Then her smile faded and her face resumed its hard façade. “You must come with me,” she added. “My brothers and sisters have been instructed to destroy this plane, and I do not wish to see you meet the same fate as its natives.”

Enid looked around. The world seemed to be hazier than it had been before. Unless she suddenly needed glasses, the woman’s explanation made sense.

Suddenly, the woman grabbed her arm. Before Enid even had time to even react, she could tell that she had finally arrived at her original destination.

Times Square.

###Chapter Nine - Fuzzlewuzzlekins
 
It was a long climb. Combining that with his apparent reality as a ghost who no longer existed to the populace around him, he had a strange feeling like he had all the time in the world. As if the world were on pause, waiting for him.

It gave him a lot of time to wonder why the world was waiting for him. Sure, he was Eric, son of Duke Gregory of Venria, husband of Princess Naomi of Yorst and thus the crown prince of the realm—until King Reagan had put him on death row, at least—but being highborn was naught but a title. It didn't grant the bearer any cosmic significance. And yet the world waited for him. There was something the world expected him to do.

Jump.

He wasn't sure if it was because he was a ghost or simply because he was distracted by his musings, but when he realized he'd made it to the exact point on that cliff where he'd lost Naomi, he hardly felt winded at all. He hesitated. He peered over the edge. His stomach squirmed from the sight of that drop, so he stepped back, took a deep breath, let it out, stretched to distract himself, and then finally forced himself to look over the edge again. His vision swam. He saw her. Her green eyes, wide in fear. Her red hair, like her father Reagan's red hair but long and lush, caught in the wind as she fell. Green eyes and red hair together were said to be a rare combination, weren't they? Rare and beautiful. He could attest to the latter personally. Maybe it was Naomi who'd had cosmic significance, not him.

Jump.

No. He was going to be sick to his stomach. He couldn't. It was too high. He saw her, falling. He couldn't do it.

Jump.

Tears stung his eyes. He gritted his teeth, and he jumped.
***
""So let me get this straight,"" Jack muttered, waving one hand in front of him as he pinched the thumb and fingers of his other hand over the bridge of his nose. This whole mess was making his head hurt. ""You're telling me there are multiple worlds. Like a multiverse.""

""If that is the term you use for it, yes."" Morgan sipped at her drink again with all the elegance of ancient royalty, her eyes never leaving him. The strange clothes she wore certainly made her look the part.

""And this Void Crawler guy wants me to lead you to another of his…'servants,' or whatever.""

""Yes.""

""And it never occurred to you that I have no idea what's going on here and that a guide should probably know what he's doing?"" The pitch of his voice went up as he drew out the first syllable of ""probably."" He dropped the hand from his face and eyed her with a mix of suspicion and bafflement. Many things could be said of Morgan, and one of them was that she was the most cryptic person he'd ever met. Beautiful, but cryptic, and thus immensely frustrating.

The flash in her eyes told him that he should've regretted saying those words. She raised a hand towards him, and at once he felt his chest and throat constrict. His eyes snapped open. Stinging pain, up and down his entire windpipe. He wheezed and grappled at his throat, half hoping his fingers would find some sort of invisible shape choking him, but there was nothing. His mind spun. He felt himself growing dizzy, delirious. ""So now you're Darth Vader,"" he gasped, grinning even through the pain.

Oh, why had he done that? Him and his big mouth. The grip she had on his throat clenched tighter, drawing a more desperate gasp out of him. ""Say something like that again to me, to my face,"" Morgan murmured dangerously, ""and you'll spend this whole trip of ours walking on invisible hot coals. Am I clear?""

He was still smiling. What a foolish thing to do. ""You won't kill me,"" he whispered, ""you need me, right? I'm your Void Crawler-appointed guide person.""

""Oh, I don't have to kill you,"" Morgan crooned, smiling again. ""I just have to use your fear of pain."" She pulled her hand back, and at once the pressure was gone. Jack fell back into his seat, gasping for air. When had he been lifted out of his seat, anyway? ""You're going to help me,"" she continued. ""Every time you question me, I’ll hurt you, just as I did a moment ago. That was just a demonstration; it'll get worse."" She traced the rim of her glass with her finger, assessing him with hooded eyes. ""And you don't want that, right?""

He nodded emphatically. ""R-right. Ha ha. Don't worry, I'm yours, love.""

""Don't call me 'love,'"" she growled.

He swallowed. ""I'm yours, beautiful. Better?""

""Better."" She took the last sip of her drink and set the glass down. ""If you are truly so puzzled by the decision of He Who Sits Behind The Stars, I suppose I could explain his reasoning, as Syr Kupra passed on to me."" She wove her fingers together and set her chin on her connected hands. ""Your world is older than mine. It has accumulated more knowledge, progressed to a technologically superior point. You know more than I do, plain and simple. And we believe you have the past experience to form a more educated guess than I can about where to find my next charge.""

""Your next charge being… that other servant you were talking about?"" Jack asked to confirm his understanding. ""The guy whose lackeys are looking into the void without knowing what it is, or something.""

""Yes. In what kind of world might we find such a man?"" She snapped her fingers, and at once there appeared a...well, he wasn't entirely sure. Whatever it was, it was next to their table, looking for all the world like a hole in reality itself, black as nothingness. The air around it seemed distorted. 

""What's that?"" he asked.

""A gate to another world. I have not yet determined the world on the other side. That is your job.""

He scowled and pointed to himself. ""My job?""

""Tell me in what sort of world we might find this man."" There was an impatient edge in her voice again. ""Remember, you are doing this for me tonight.""

""Um."" He sank back in his seat and pinched the bridge of his nose again. ""Well, let's see. The void, right? That sounds...sci-fi-ish.""

""Sci-fi?"" she echoed. There was a confused note in her voice.

""Science fiction. Y'know, like in the future. Better tech, spaceships, other planets, wormholes and such.""

""You propose we seek our target in the future?"" Morgan asked.

""Uh,"" he started, a bit confused by her haste. ""Sure. That's the best idea I've—""

There was a disturbance. A ripple in the air, a pulse of sound so deep in pitch that he wasn't even sure if he'd heard it. And then there was a crash and a flurry of movement, and Jack yelped and pressed himself against his seat back, far away from whatever had just come flying out of the world-portal-thing to land right on their table and send their drinks tumbling over with a sharp clatter. The thing was a man, clad in brown clothing that looked several centuries out of date. He groaned loudly in pain, found the table under him, and pushed himself away, sliding backwards until his feet found the floor. Jack noticed that the portal seemed to have disappeared, though he could not have said when. The strange man finally propped up his upper body, more or less standing if not standing up straight. He looked quite dazed, and he eyed first Jack and then Morgan with utter confusion. Upon seeing the latter, he froze, his jaw coming unhinged as he blinked at her stupidly.

Jack relaxed back into his seat as the jolt of adrenaline in his system slowly fizzled away. He furrowed his brows, then arched one in puzzlement after a moment, assessing the newcomer more closely. This man's clothing looked more like Morgan's than anything futuristic. There was a chance that this man was their charge, but if he were, then this whole deal had seemed far too easy. Jack's gaze shifted back up to find Morgan's, but for the first time since he'd met her earlier that day, the woman's face looked truly shocked, at a loss for words. Her eyes were glued to the stranger's eyes.

""Naomi,"" the strange man breathed.

Morgan didn't answer at first. Then her eyes twinkled, and against all odds, she smiled, not in her usual guarded and dangerous way, but in a vulnerable, relieved way. She laughed. It was an odd laugh, the laugh of disbelief. ""Eric,"" she chortled, regaining her composure in time to bop him on the nose with her finger, ""you're late.""

###Chapter Ten - Tyflowshun

Eric embraced Naomi as if it were the end of the world. His faith in himself was restored, and a smile appeared that was very fresh as if anew. Neither Eric nor Jack could believe their eyes. For Eric it was a warm reunion, but for Jack he was still trying to take in everything that had just occurred. There was disillusionment in how Jack perceived this. Could it be that his dwellings about a different world were not only a tale but a reality that came to fruition? The void closed and shuttered the air around it. With a great vacuum-like whistle the void disappeared as quickly as it appeared.

Jack sat in bewilderment rubbing his face of astonishment and confusion as well. “What just happened?” he asked. The room was quiet and Jack recognised time had stopped again. “Morgan, who is this man?”

Morgan turned to introduce Eric. “Eric, my dear, please meet our guide. He Who Sits Behind The Stars has called upon this man to lead us on our way to finding disciples for our lord Syr Kupra. It’s a small task and so far he’s brought you here.” There was an air of relief as Eric found himself a seat and looked upon Jack, who sat in complete bewilderment.

“It’s nice to meet you,” Eric said, “but where is this place?” He smelled of sweat and exhaustion. He picked up Jack’s water and drank it in one sip. Eric turned to Morgan with the biggest grin and tears about to burst from his eyes, “I’m so happy to see you again, Naomi. I thought you had died. I thought I’d never see you again. They thought that I killed you. You have no idea what it was like to sit and wait in that prison. But now we can go back and correct things.”

“Eric, I’m afraid that can’t happen. You have a new life here. You have a new life as a servant to Syr Kupra.” Her eyes shifted from the regular hazel they had encompassed and turned to grey. Eric did very little other than accept this fact. “You see Eric, my dearest Eric, I’ve been called upon by Syr Kupra,” her tone grew with pride, “an all powerful being that has granted me many new abilities, like stopping time.” She snapped her fingers and time regained its original course. Jack could see as people returned to the routine they had before time stopped like unpausing a movie; everything all at once.

“Naomi, everyone including your father is awash with what had happened. I was almost killed because they thought you had died. We must travel back and right this misconception.” Eric grieved to Morgan.

“I’m sorry Eric, but we have many more important things to accomplish here in this dimension. Right now you are abolished of that world. Right now you are alive so please, if you feel like we must see my father and make clear his expectations then we can do so at a later time. Right now I wish that you would live for the moment and listen to me. It hasn’t failed you thus far to listen to me, now has it?” Eric thought for a moment rubbing his brow and contemplating.

“Naomi,” Eric became steadfast and responded to Naomi’s request of him, “at this moment Naomi I have no reason to not trust you. I will follow you to death again if that meant staying by your side.”

“This is not what I expected to come out of that void,” Jack whispered to himself. “So wait a moment, did you open up tha-that portal or did I? Come to think of it, then why do you need me here?” Jack asked in a heap of confusion. Did he bring Eric here or did Morgan? He felt uneasy. “Christ, now I’m having a migraine I need a drink.” Eric reached behind the bar and grabbed the tequila and threw it back.

“There there Jack, all will be explained in due time. All you need to do now is figure out where we can find the other disciple.” There was a smirk upon Morgan’s face as if she knew Jack would bring forth the right people for the job; the correct people to sit at the right hand of Syr Kupra.

“Well, I do know a guy. We’ve done some odd jobs from time to time. He’s my main squeeze. Let me get him down here, maybe he can help us. In the meantime you two can get reacquainted.” Jack pulled out his phone and dialed. Placing it to his temple, there was a ring on the other line. He pressed two fingers to the bridge of his nose. “C’mon, pick up dammit, you’re my only ace in the sleeve.” 
***
John stared at the monitors watching the black van sitting outside his house and contemplated his next move. The van had been very stagnant which gave John an opportunity to take the escape tunnel into his house and get the important things while still avoiding it. Back when Bush was in office John had thought that the crazy bastard would get everyone nuked someday. So, in his decision to keep himself safe, John decided to make a separate cellar and escape tunnel that way if anyone raided his house they would never find the secondary cellar or the tunnel. John had figured that anyone looking for him would have occupied his house by now. He crept through the escape tunnel until he reached the secondary cellar that was apart from the main cellar attached to the house. His secondary cellar was the place where he stored case sensitive information, weapons, ammo, supplies and surveillance monitors for the cameras There was a slight buzzing at his hip but he didn’t pay it much mind as he was deep in thought and worry. The buzzing wouldn’t cease as he finally removed the phone from his pocket and placed it to his ear.

He was aggravated that the call was from his old friend Jack. “What do you want, Jack?” John asked. “If it’s another one of your hairbrained schemes, I want nothing to do with it. Besides, I’ve got enough to worry about right now.”

“Look John, I don’t have enough to go by to explain what exactly is going on, but I need you to head over to the Pub on Easy Street. There’s a couple of people I want you to meet. There’s a big payout involved so I know you can’t turn this down.” 

There was a rustling on the other side of the cellar wall that connected the two cellars, “Jack, lemme call you back in just a few minutes.” John listened in on the sounds.

“He has a connection to the girl. Look at this flier.” One of the voices sounded big and burly.

“That’s great and all, but right now they don’t want her, they want this John fellow. He’s got some really classified stuff that they don’t want falling into the wrong hands.” this voice sounded less burly and more skinny and snooty. John looked down at one of the fliers he had placed on the small shelf next to him in the secondary cellar. One glance at it didn’t give him many answers. 
John glanced ahead. The black van remained sitting outside of his apartment. The van hadn’t moved and even after leaving the cellar he wasn’t about to try his luck with death. This seemed like the only viable option instead of getting shot or worse.

“Sure, fine. I’ll be there in about thirty.” John hung up the phone. He had to get as far away from here as possible he thought and to the place that Jack wanted him to meet, hopefully this would be the prime opportunity to do so. He could avoid the van and lay low.

John headed over to the tavern post haste and opened the door. Something seemed real off from the get-go. No one in the bar was moving but him. The place was eerily still and nearly quiet except for a few people in the back of the bar. He called out to see if Jack was there. 

“Hey Jack, you here?” The Pub seemed almost ghostly but, not a minute later, Jack stood up and walked over to John who stood in the doorway. 

Jack lead John along in an almost nervous way to a table in the back of the room. “Took you long enough, John. I was getting worried. Let me introduce you to a couple of new friends of mine. Don’t be alarmed by the one guys’ garments because he’s kind of a hippie.” There were two other people, a woman with sleek hazel eyes and a slender body, and a man with very layered garments. The garments were torn nearly everywhere - what, was this guy from Belize or something - he thought this was incomprehensible. “Please meet Morg- uhh, Naomi and Eric.” John went to shake Eric’s hand. It was a very firm and trusting grip. Almost as if John could see himself relying on this guy but one can only trust someone as far as they can throw them at first notice.

“Nice to meet you.” John went to shake the girl’s hand and all of a sudden she twisted his arm behind his back and slammed his face on the table.

“I sense something about you. You aren’t like this Jack fellow. Something about you seems very...untrustworthy.” 

When John was still in college before his fatal dropout, he was taking classes in Kempo and Krav Maga. He met Jack one night who helped him fend off enemies. Ever since they had been partners doing odd jobs. John even learned to use guns even though he had hoped he didn’t need the skill.

John realised what just happened and retaliated automatically. He unraveled his arm, turned to face her and grabbed her by the collar. He felt a breath of cognition, something deep down erupted. He could see a flash of light in the corner of his eye. Her arm flew back and he dropped her. There was a momentary pause, “Whoa, what happened? What the hell was that?”

“Ah, so that’s it then. Jack, you’ve outdone yourself this time.” Morgan complimented. She rubbed her wrist as if licking her wounds.

“Whoa now, no need to get rowdy you two. You can finish this...whatever it is after the job is done. Right now I can’t have you two tearing each other apart from the start. Now what exactly is going on?” Jack tried to calm the both of them down. Sweat could be seen dripping from Jack’s brow in his stressed state of mind. 

“Yes, this man is a chosen servant of our lord Syr Kupra. You’re doing a splendid job as a guide. If you could stop asking questions that would make you a master at your craft. Besides, don’t you like doing magic tricks?” Morgan reassured Jack in a very prideful tone.

“Whoa, what do you mean, 'servant'? JACK, explain, now!” John growled at Jack. 

“Look, John, I know what you’re thinking and I can’t let you leave so easily. I need you right now to help me if something goes wrong. But aside from that, whatever you did with your hand right back there was pretty cool. You’ll have to teach me later so I can defend myself if this Naomi woman tries to kill me.” Jack tried to hold John back from leaving the bar by getting standing in John’s path but John was persistent. You could see John teeming with rage at Jack’s decision to invite him here. All John wanted to do now was leave.

“What thing I did with my hand?” John looked at his hand and there was nothing wrong with it. All he knew was that he must have deflected a direct hit from this Morgan girl. “Nevermind that, you’re going to tell me what the fuck is going on otherwise I’m leaving. I’ve already got people chasing after me. I don’t need one thing to lead to another and get killed even quicker.”

“Okay, John, I know this may seem hard to put through your obnoxious head but look at them, they’re from another world. There’s multiverses, that guy Eric is a son of a Duke who just came through a void out of nowhere and Mo- Naomi was Morgan but now she’s Naomi but I am still unsure how that works unless you legally change your name. Anyway, something about a void crawler. Oh, no, she’s a Void Crawler. Eric’s from another world, it seems he is from the same one she crawled out of and I’m a guide for her who is guided by some guy who sits behind stars. There’s a guy named Syr Kupra who Naomi is loyal to and well I got caught in this mess. At least that’s what I’m getting from her. I don’t know if I’ve died or I’m really high so it’s really up to you to believe this. I’m just going along with it all at this point. I’m a good couple of shots drowned at this point so I wouldn’t care in the slightest. Other than that you are now helping us, or me rather. Please John,” Jack begged, “at the very least help me out here. I promise I can help you out too. Scratch my back, I scratch yours, right?”

“Hopefully you two have things sorted out by now,” Naomi interrupted, “right, Jack? Mhm,” she assumed the situation was settled, “so let us go onward and find ourselves one other disciple.” Her eyes became very green and there was this essence about her. “I expect you brought a device that allows us to transport elsewhere in this world at a reasonable pace, isn’t that right, John?”

“If you mean a car, then yes, I have one of those. Where did you say you were from?” John replied without missing a beat but she ignored him. She walked out of the frozen tavern and straight to the car John had parked out front across the street. John never even gave her the details of his car or where it was parked.

Naomi waved her hand and a trail of light shone before them that led up the road and disappeared into the distance. John looked around to the public passersby that paid little to no mind as they walked past. He wanted to question these strange powers but knew he had no part other than to tag along for now. They each loaded into the car and John drove off in an effort to follow the glowing trail. It was unlike anything else he’d ever seen but he would have no choice other than to be a part of this bandwagon that Jack would definitely pay him back, only with his life this time around after this was settled. Naomi was sitting in the passenger seat while Eric and Jack were in the back seat. Naomi leaned over and pulled out the package that was sitting on the floor. John snatched it from her.

“That’s a gift. For my mother.” He snapped trying to fend her away from the orb. He couldn’t let her know let alone anyone else know what he had done or what this was. Hopefully by now whoever had been chasing after him was nowhere to be found.

“Hm...interesting.” Her voice seemed very suspicious of but she simply turned her gaze out the window. John figured he was in the clear for now, but that was no reason to trust her. He just continued to follow the clairvoyant light in hopes that he would escape his own fate.",astorybypeople,A Story By People: Chapters Nine and Ten,https://www.reddit.com/r/astorybypeople/comments/4xrori/a_story_by_people_chapters_nine_and_ten/

###Chapter Seven - Aelintari

Enid stopped running to collect her bearings. The bruises on her legs stung and she felt a welt on her forehead where the snow globe had struck her. She thought of the last big fight she had with her mom. It was out on the front porch, arguing about curfew and independence. It was bad, but nothing like this. 

Enid looked around for anything familiar. Her eyes widened when she saw the green shutters, those green shutters her mother always threatened to paint over. She could feel the soreness in her legs from the long sprint but there were the green shutters, that unmistakable yellow door. Enid snuck toward a window to glance inside. *Did she just forget that all the houses looked the same or something?* It couldn’t be hers. 

There was her mother behind the glass, sweeping the shards of the broken snow globe. The window was cracked open and she heard her mother’s voice singing their family lullaby. Many immigrants forgot their clan’s lullaby within a generation or 2 but not hers. They proudly hummed the tune and words 3 generations later. Enid leaned closer to the pane. She closed her eyes and wrapped her arms fast around herself. The soreness subsided and the throbbing headache began to dull. She was home.

“Who’s that?” her mother said, putting down the broom. Enid only just realized she was humming aloud to the tune. 

“Better not be one of the clones again. I told them I do NOT want none of that service. It is ungodly.” She picked up the phone and headed toward the window.

“They can’t just make a clone and think it will replace the real thing. And the nerve too. Today again after I told them 3 days ago, when the 1st one showed up, to let us grieve.”

*I’m not a clone!* Enid thought. *Maybe if I talk to her.* Instead she squatted behind the bushes, crawling farther from the house. Enid held her breath, too afraid to look up or to stop creeping away. She thought again of explaining the situation, getting her life back as it was, but her body failed to get the message. By the edge of the house she exhaled deeply and had the courage to look out. Nobody. She escaped detection. She turned her face down, somehow disappointed.

*How am I back here after that run?* She wondered. Enid scanned around for answers. Everything looked more or less the same but it didn’t feel like home. Kind of like when she returned from spending a year abroad volunteering at a children’s orphanage in Chennai, much to her mother’s disapproval. Either this was a cruel joke or she fell and woke up in the twilight zone. At the moment she didn’t know which was worse. Enid closed her eyes. *Focus. Breathe in. Breathe out. Think of the fissure. The hill.* The scent of cinnamon jolted her eyes open. No more shutters, no white picket fence, no house. If she could imagine herself here then she could also imagine herself back home with a mom fussing over her. Her mind was still racing but she closed her eyes tight, furrowing her brow and scrunching her nose. She thought of her room. Of her paintings on the wall. 
The room was almost as she left it except all the mirrors were covered; there were flowers on her bed, and the closet was taped off. Was that where she supposedly did it? 

She knew it wasn’t the home she wanted. The air was different here. Who could impersonate her enough to convince her own mother? Couldn’t she imagine herself home alive still? She tried again. The sound of footsteps broke her concentration. She was still in the room where she died. The doorknob jiggled. 

“If I find it again I’ll kill it myself” she heard. 

Enid grabbed a long sweater from her drawer. *The forest. The cliff. The big fat trunks of trees. The lake.* She was again by the fissure. *Where else could I imagine myself?* Enid thought of Chennai and it’s unbearable heat. Of children’s laughter. She heard silence and opened to find herself by her old house again. She shot down, laying flat against the grass so as not to be seen through the window. Sweat pooled under her armpits.

She thought of the neighborhood park. There was a loud flapping of wings. *Am I doomed to only travel between a dead girl’s home and here?* She stood on a precipice, the moon casting a bright light below. The reflection in the pond made Enid drop to her knees. *I’m crazy* she thought. In place of the moon she saw an orb, perhaps measuring equal to the sun in size if not more. And brighter too. Most different of all, however, were the satellites around it, like Saturn’s rings. She looked up and saw a vast network of highways around that moon. It hurt her eyes to stare too long at it but she forced herself to keep looking. The orb didn’t have the same rocky pattern of the moon she was used to. It looked completely smooth, stainless steel maybe? Enid felt the night chill. She rubbed her arms. “I’m scared” she whispered out loud. She was surprised to hear her voice, it too sounded alien to her here. Enid stayed there shivering, too afraid to move but also afraid to stay. Every sound marked the end for her. What beasts were there here? She realized now how loudly she breathed. 

Perchance the lullaby wormed it’s way into her mind and she began to hum. She stopped jerking at the sound of every twig snap. Her teeth stopped chattering. 

&gt;“**J**ourney little one to sleep  
**K**in is here, you safe to keep  
**R**eturn again when sun is bright  
**K**now the creatures in night”  

Enid got up and began to walk. Away from the fissure. Away from her home. Away from the life she once knew. She let the light and the song guide her, afraid now only of the night’s sleep-- when it would come and the places it could take her.
***
John saw a sign on the front door about a missing child. Missing girl: Enid Grendan. 
In his pocket he felt the weight of the ball. It seemed heavy hanging there, heavier than it felt in his hands earlier. His fingers traced the smooth surface. He found himself constantly touching it now. Wanting to feel it, to look at it. He took the ball out. No it wasn’t black. And it wasn’t exactly glass either, he couldn’t see his reflection in it. 
***
To the public Kal Kupra was missing but to some he was missing only in name. Slowly change was coming. Even a Tarnipe eventually grew wings. 

Eldaref prostrated in prayer “Jal’Kaideen Ro Kreth.” Old habits died slowly. The wick of the candle was burning out. He hunched over his texts, eyes darting from scroll to scroll. 

There was shuffling outside his door. The man knelt to make his way inside, the ceilings too short for standing at full height.
“I brought you more light, Kal Ku--”

Eldaref interrupted. “Don’t call me that. Words travel! I am Eldaref, for now.”

“Yes,” the man nodded, replacing his candle. He glanced at the script and turned to leave, hesitating by the door. 

“Speak your will,” Eldaref gestured him closer.

“I-I wish I could go with you to the ruins,” he stammered. 

“I am not going back,” Eldaref rolled one scroll closed and unrolled another, “there is no need to return that way. What I look for happens by chance. Men cannot capture it in caverns with tomes dedicated to its devotion. Not even ancient men.”

The man handed Eldaref a dagger. It had served the man well in his life. Its hilt was made of ivory and the eye of Aeyshur was carved on it. Aeyshur, always watching, listening, punishing. Where was the inquisitor now? It didn’t matter. Aeyshur had no spies where he was going. 

“Take this with you when you go.”

Eldaref bowed his head, “I will.”

When the man left Eldaref looked again at the small sphere he found in the ruins. He pored over the texts in search about it, listening to the steady stream running above him. In this hideaway he would uncover the secrets to the void. He scribbled translations in case he was not around to pass the message to others when the time came. He wrote fast, the words nearly writing themselves on the page. Eldaref pricked his finger, letting the blood collect into a small glass and dipping his pen in after. The truth had to surface, for now it could only be through him. He touched the orb again, wetting it with his life’s ink. Blood. It was the color of blood. He traced his finger back to the riddle. 

“The chasm opens with a sacrifice. Eye for eye. Tooth for tooth. The mind decides, the ball rewinds.”

The chasm was the way into the void, but what was the sacrifice it asked for? What does the mind decide? Eldaref fingered the sphere in his palm. “The ball rewinds.”

Eldaref wrote until his mind wandered to empty dreams. The flame was still flickering. A shadow bigger than he leaned over him as he slept. In his dreams he heard the hum of a soft melody; 

“**J**al’**K**aideen **R**o **K**reth” he mouthed.

###Chapter Eight - TheVenerableSwede

*The K-269e culture is one of the most straightforward and well-known in the universe. Originally a reclusive race, when solar flare E259 rendered all energy generation on their planet redundant, they were unable to establish contact before the planet was plunged into chaos. Constant looting and violent clashes led to a brutal few decades of natural selection, after which only the strongest K-269e remained. When a passing goods vessel was able to re-establish contact with the K-269e, they found a society revolving on honour and loyalty. Following their return to the intergalactic stage, K-269e immediately sought jobs, and their sense of duty and cool-headedness quickly became known, launching them into their current status, where they are sought-after for administrative roles and such jobs where confidentiality is key.*  
-excerpt from Races of the Universe: A short introduction

The interior of the landing ship was unremarkable. Seats made of synthetic fabric were tilted backwards slightly to accommodate for the low ceiling, and viewport screens lined the walls at window height, displaying crisp video feed of the surrounding star from cameras mounted on the outside of the ship. The spaceport was far behind them now; Kasabian felt his hands tighten around the thin rectangular box at his waist. As the ship started to enter the Earth’s atmosphere, the on-board batteries began to hum, and a spiderweb of sparks flashed and flickered a metre from the ship’s hull before a cone of flame surrounded the ship’s energy shield. Energy shields were expensive apparatus; the portable version on his belt had cost him a near fortune, but the trader who'd sold it to him didn't realise he was flogging it for barely a tenth of its value.

As soon as they entered the Earth’s atmosphere, it was plain that the grey clouds they’d seen from space meant a heavy downpour at the landing zone. As the energy shield powered down, the sound of rain drumming on the small landing craft’s roof became apparent. It was late afternoon at the landing zone, meaning the only sources of light were the illuminating stripes on either side of the docking station. The ship began to decelerate as it approached the docking station. As it did, the hydraulic docking pistons extended to cushion the impact as the ship’s gyrostabiliser powered down. There was a low hum as the pistons lowered and clicked into place. As the pistons locked, the crew unfastened their seat belts and prepared to dash into the laboratory complex. Captain Delvare seemed to sense the hectic atmosphere, and Kasabian could tell what she was going to say before she spoke. He sighed inwardly and began surreptitiously covering the dull metal box at his waist with the adaptable fabric of his shirt.

“You will exit the craft in rows of two.” The instruction held no room for argument, and the few crew members who deigned to turn their heads to the captain were met with a steely glare. Delvare rose from her seat and, as if planned in advance, the ship’s doors slid smoothly open.

The downpour was every bit as bad as it had looked on their descent. Delvare didn’t waste a moment of her chance to establish exactly who was in command of the crew. When they were halfway to the complex entrance, the K-422b who had sat next to him at the spaceport (and had studiously avoided eye contact) piped up in a reedy voice; “Can’t we walk a bit faster?”
Every head in the procession turned incredulously towards the source of the plea as Delvare slowed to a halt. Delvare made a point of slowly turning to face the Klaaxi. He shivered, and Kasabian wasn’t sure if it was the weather or the unflinching stare Delvare was giving the man.

“What?” said Delvare, biting off the word. 

The Klaaxi’s eyes were downcast. “I was just, ah, um…” 

Delvare tilted her head to one side as if talking to a child. “Yes?” 

The Klaaxi noticed the stares of the group, and straightened his back. Shooting a glance at Kasabian, he turned to face a point an inch to the left of Delvare’s eyes. “Can we please walk a bit faster, ma’am?” He flicked his eyes to glance at her cool gaze before flicking them away again. The Klaaxi had puffed his chest out slightly and seemed to be holding his breath, fixed in a ridiculous upright posture. 

Delvare, on the other hand seemed to be enjoying the chance to make an example of a crew member in the heavy downpour. She stepped into the Klaaxi’s line of vision, and though she kept her face entirely composed, Kasabian could sense her satisfaction when the man flinched and exhaled slightly. 

“Can we walk a bit faster?” she sneered. She hardly seemed to notice the rain. “The life of a child rests in our hands,” she took time passing every word. “If you think your comfort comes first, go ahead.” She gestured towards the door with her hand. The Klaaxi turned to look at the angry faces of the people around him and seemed poised to sprint off into the rain. 
“My comfort comes second,” he whispered.    

The atmosphere in the laboratory’s cafeteria was tense to say the least. The Klaaxi had taken it upon himself to sit opposite Kasabian. 

“My name’s Andron,” he said, keeping his eyes on the synth food that was on his plate. 

“Kasabian,” said Kasabian. 

“You going to eat that smash?” Andron looked up with a grin on his face. 

Kasabian could see heads turning to glance at him. He deliberately raised his voice. “Forget about yesterday. If it wasn’t you, it would have been someone else.” He locked eyes with Vance, who was sitting at the far side of the cafeteria. Vance turned away and muttered something under his breath. 

“Hey,” said Andron, “Call me ‘Dron.” Kasabian saw Delvare get up from her table and start walking towards him. 

“I will,” Kasabian grinned. “Dron.” 

Delvare was standing by the side of their table now, looking down at him. Kasabian raised his head and greeted her with a studiously innocent smile. 

“You can eat in the lab,” said the captain. “We’re all waiting for your research to begin the operation. Every second we lose further endangers the child”. 

Kasabian stood up and gathered his plate and mug into his hands. 

Delvare glanced at the Klaaxi. “And take your friend here with you”.
***
It was a longer walk to his lab than Kasabian had anticipated, and his food was resolutely cold when he arrived at the grey security door. 

“Are you sure it’s this one?” Kasabian asked. Andron had insisted on being the one to carry the map, and Kasabian wasn’t sure the Klaaxi had read it correctly. 

“Yes, I’m sure,” Andron replied, looking hurt. 

Kasabian sighed and pressed his thumb into the glossy black biometric scanner. An electronic chime sounded, and the door slid smoothly open.

The front side of the laboratory was dominated by a massive viewing screen, giving a wide view of the outside of the L - shaped laboratory complex. Below the viewport was a computer bank and Kasabian’s collection of instruments. Kasabian took a sip from his mug, grimaced, and put it down on a desk by the entrance. “Is that a… cuprous crystal?”  

With the invention of room temperature superconductors, lossless electrical transmission became a reality. By utilising properties of the copper oxide superconductor’s architecture, K-62f scientists were able to send electrons around a closed spherical circuit, and store vast volumes of data. Unfortunately, the dark crystals were allegedly prone to shattering in spectacular fashion, releasing monumental amounts of electricity in an instant. The technology was quickly confiscated by the military, and all papers and documents regarding the crystals were destroyed, with information on their construction being known by only a select few.

At least, that was what Kasabian had been told. He had a feeling that his probing about the origin of the crystal had drawn very much unwanted attention to himself, and his spontaneous decision to take up the offer of this rescue mission had been his way of giving himself some breathing space.

Kasabian strode over to stand by the computer terminal, where the perfect sphere was sitting atop a narrow metal display podium. The sphere’s core was pitch black and opaque, and small jagged arcs of electricity were visible in the sphere. Kasabian glanced at the front face of the computer bank, and what he saw confirmed his suspicions. The computer terminal had a custom memory port, with a circular hole in the front panel.

Kasabian supposed the mission had been too good to be true. He’d angered the wrong people by investigating the crystal, and they’d put one here to test him. He supposed he had wanted a chance to research the crystal, and they’d given him one. He realised his chances of escaping the facility alive were minimal, and suddenly understood why Delvare had sent Andron into the lab with him - she knew that anyone who’d seen the crystal would be silenced before this ‘rescue mission’ was over. The only question was this: who, out of the other crew members, knew about the cover up, and who was going to be silenced?

Kasabian picked up the orb with shaking fingers, and pushed it into the hole in the front panel. The panel swung shut, and with a high-pitched whirring, the viewport darkened to an impossible black. Blinding light seared into his retinas, and even as the strange words faded from the panel, he could see the afterimages as plain as day;

It didn't disappoint - by which I mean the episode did not go how I thought it would and I applaud the Crewniverse for making the right decision from a storytelling standpoint.

[Here's what ](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResenter) [I expected.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoureJustJealous) (Warning: TVTropes links.) In the last episode, Steven and Amethyst came to an understanding, but Amethyst's self-esteem was still ever so slightly on the rocks. What better way to further that storyline than having her mistrust the new (old) member of the team? You see it all the time in kids' shows: when someone new shows up, one member gets marginalized and gets to sulk for a bit until they realize *surprise, surprise* the new guy actually isn't a good fit, [or even downright evil.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRangerTraitor) (Warning: more tropes).

You can see them starting down this path right up to the first commercial break. Amethyst never knew Bismuth, so upon meeting her, she stays aloof and reserved. And her explanation to Steven is pretty justified too. Why *wouldn't* Rose have mentioned Bismuth in all that time?

But then the script gets flipped on its head. Bismuth talks to Amethyst, shows verbal appreciation of her skillset and offers her a gift that's perfectly in line with her personality. And now Steven is the marginalized one, but not because Bismuth isn't trying to include him, but because he's unsettled by Bismuth's intensity. Even that doesn't last very long, because Bismuth shows she's perfectly capable of unwinding with the rest of the team.

I really like the way this episode wields its characterization. It would have been far too easy for them to go the normal route and have Amethyst play the fifth wheel. It might still have been good, but it would also definitely be a waste since it's been done so often. Instead, she is a clever bit of misdirection that adds to the audience's sense of unease, but allows her to return smoothly to the role of comic relief. After Bismuth shows she's not a threat to Amethyst's status, Amethyst goes right back to what she likes best: inordinate amounts of fighting and eating. Then Steven returns to his role of having to make hard moral decisions after being thrust into his mother's legacy. 

""Bismuth"" deserves its place as the 100th episode. It gets right to the heart of the issue of Rose's past vs. Steven's present. A lot of people remarked in the episode discussion how it seems Steven has been pigeonholed by Gems and fans alike into being his mother's replacement, and they're absolutely right. I'm glad they chose to make the episode about Steven's insecurity rather than Amethyst's. It's different, it's captivating, and it feels right.",stevenuniverse,A narrative choice which I really appreciated [Bismuth/Steven vs. Amethyst Spoilers],https://www.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/comments/4wbxap/a_narrative_choice_which_i_really_appreciated/

The smoke managed to follow us down to the coast. It suffocated me. I felt almost as though I were wading through the molten slag of the mountain hideout, even though we had long since left it behind. I wished we could fly away, out from the mountain range and into the clouds where the air would be far fresher. But then it would have been far too trivial for the Grand Magnate's soldiers to have us followed.

We kept to the trees, traveling as slowly and quietly as possible. Every once in a while we would hear the roars of the fire above us, and the trampling footsteps of the soldiers' armor as they patrolled. They grew less and less frequent as we approached the water. Finally we reached the port, after half an hour. One or two boats were moored at odd angles to the docks, but the harbor was deserted.

""Where is everyone?"" 

""Not here, that's for certain."" Ruscio tugged on the door of a fishmonger's booth. It opened. ""The soldiers must have finally begun enforcing Tsao's curfew in the city.""

Food and wares were scattered around Merchant's Lane. Not in abundance, but enough to tell that everyone had left in a rush. Dim lantern light bathed the road in flickering shadows. Here, a trampled piece of bread; there, a handmade shawl lying in the dust. The lane was empty, yet the atmosphere was tense, and a shiver ran down my spine as we ducked underneath the countertop.

""We need to get on a boat. Sail for Kryses. We won't make it to the Capitol by land, not if the soldiers are watching the roads."" He wasn't listening. ""Ruscio!""

""What?"" He had two slabs of fish meat in either hand. 

""We can't stop to eat! We need to *leave.*""

""Well, we can't leave. Not right now."" He started to cook the fish in his hands, the flames bruising the color of the scales. ""If there's a curfew, no more ships will come in. We're stuck here until morning, maybe even longer than that."" He threw the fish into my lap; I swatted it away before it could burn a hole in my pants. ""Besides which, we'll need supplies.""

""Master Tseng said we couldn't stop for anything. The message is too important. We'll take one of the sampans out to deeper water-""

He sighed. ""Lenn, think for a minute. What will happen to the scroll if we're caught trying to steal a fishing boat? What will happen to *us?* We'll be worse off than when we started.""

""But-""

""I know what Master Tseng said. I'm just trying to be careful."" He stared dispassionately at the fish I'd dropped. ""Find yourself something to eat.""

He sat with his back against a wooden crate and began eating. I'd long since lost my appetite. Slowly, I pulled the onyx box out from my pack and laid my hands on its cool surface. Every time I closed my eyes - every time I *blinked* - Tseng's body was on the ground, burning from the inside out, while Magnate Tsao held him down with a boot on his chest. How long would it be until he found us too, and turned our pyrokinetic powers against us? 

""Aren't you going to eat?""

""No."" I got to my knees and peeked over the counter. ""I guess you're right, though. We should look for supplies.""

""Let's split up."" He'd already finished eating. ""Keep it simple. Find something to wear that's not prison clothes, then stock up on as much food as you can carry. We'll meet back here.""

""Fine.""

""You're not going to carry that box around all night, are you?""

I gripped the onyx box defensively. ""Master Tseng said not to let it out of our sight.""

""Lenn, you need to relax. Give the scroll to me."" I took a step back when he reached for it. He paused, and shook his head. ""Just... don't be stupid. The Master is gone. We need to start making our own decisions.""

He vaulted over the counter and crept toward a merchant's cart that was lying on its side. I exited the stall and walked in the other direction, keeping the box tucked underneath my arm. 

I wasn't sure what to do next. I was in shock. The words ""*Do not trust Ruscio*"" circled around in my brain, over and over. Why did they have to be the Master's last words to me? What had he known? For the first time since I had begun my training, I found the Master had given me advice I truly did not want to follow.

But what choice did I have?

I walked out to the waterfront. Immediately I saw two guards on opposite ends of the docks, keeping watch on the water. Neither of them saw me, however, and they certainly wouldn't see Ruscio if he stayed on Merchant's Lane and away from the port. But how would I get a boat onto the water without his help?

""What are you doing?"" A hand clamped over my mouth, thankfully, before I could scream. ""I told you, we can't leave!""

I removed the hand and spun away. Ruscio had already found a bag and filled it with what looked to be a pound of bread, fish, and apples. He held it out to me with his free hand. ""Here,"" he said. ""Take this back to the booth and wait for me there.""

""...No.""

""Lenn-""

I held up my hand and focused my energy into a warning light in my palm. ""Stay back.""

""Lenn, what are you *doing?*"" Ruscio dropped the bag.

""I'm leaving for Kryses with or without you. The Master gave us a task, and we need to follow it.""

""You were going to leave without me?"" He looked... actually heartbroken, and for a moment I wavered. But I had to know the truth.

""Are you the Grand Magnate's spy?""

""What? *NO!*"" Ruscio took a step closer, but I brightened my hand and a wisp of flame gathered an inch from my palm. This was a mistake.

""Hey! You there!"" Both of the guards had noticed us, in the same moment. I could see one of them holding a small metal square, undoubtedly a pyrokinetic tracker like the ones from the prison. Did all the soldiers have them now? I froze.

""Lenn, stop it!"" Ruscio pleaded. ""Give me the box and let's go!""

""I can't trust you-""

""Why *not*?""

""-Not unless you come with me. Right now.""

The sound of a pistol shattered the air around us. The shot went high; I could feel it whipping a few feet above my head. I could barely hear Ruscio shouting my name again, over the crack of the gun, but I could clearly see his eyes focused intently on the box under my arm.

""Sorry, Ruscio,"" I said, and shot a beam of flame directly at his chest.

He put up his hands to block the attack, and the shockwave sent us both flying. I crashed through a pagoda and over the pier, skidding across the water like a stone until I stabilized myself over the waves. The fire projecting from my feet blasted at full tilt as I hurriedly stuffed the box back into my bag. Red embers began to glow, marking my path from the dock to the water. The guards on the dock took aim, and in the distance, I could hear an alarm bell sound, alerting more guards to my presence.

I turned and ran across the water.

###Chapter Five - Castriff

Jack, while standing by the side of the Times Square Pavilion, had stolen seventeen wallets in the four hours since his arrival. This was an unusually high number, but today he was feeling cocky. No one saw, and no one suspected. Why should they?

“Step forward, folks – get as close as you want, every single one of you needs to keep your eyes on me, you understand? Because if you don’t–” The magician clapped his hands, and the stack of quarters he had been holding seemed to disappear between them. “Poof! Gone before you know it, am I right, ladies and gentlemen?”

The crowd oohed and aahed and clapped appropriately. Jack eased his hands open to reveal a crisp five-dollar bill. Then he whisked off his top hat and placed the bill inside.

“Don’t forget to tip your magician, everyone.” Setting his hat on the ground, Jack pulled a pack of cards from the breast pocket of his suit, and handed them out to the crowd. Each one was stylized with the faces of different playing cards. “Magical Jack, at your service. I’m gonna be performing 9:30 tonight at Lacie J’s – address is on the card, right there – If you show up with one of these special cards, your first drink is free! I want you all to come out, have a great time, okay! Now, I’m gonna need a volunteer from the audience.”

A few walked away, content to have the card as a souvenir. But The Square was crowded, and more tourists replaced those who left. Together, the captive audience formed a semicircle around the pavilion.

As Jack picked up his hat, his eyes caught a woman standing near the back of the crowd. She’d been hanging around Jack’s turf for maybe half an hour; he might not have noticed her if not for her stare. It was intense, and intent upon something Jack didn’t know how to define. Maybe she was interested in him; it was hard to tell. He decided to take his chances.

“You in the back, the redhead!”


She shook herself, as if out of a trance, and pointed at her chest. “Are you speaking to me?”

“I’m speaking to you, beautiful! Come on down!”

The crowd parted and made room for her, some grumbling under their breath that they hadn’t been chosen. Looking her up and down, Jack was only slightly more confident that the woman would be open to a few drinks. Her eyes were flirtatious, glinting in the light of the dozens of screens peppered over the high-rises. But she held herself regally, and dressed the part as well. Her clothes seemed expensive, and strangely ancient as well. She was from money, and he’d really have to lay on the charm.

 “What’s your name?”

“Morgan.” Her accent was impossible to place, and her words drawled with boredom.

“You come here often, Morgan?”

“I’m new to the city,” she replied.”I am… taking in the sights, as they say.”

“See, that’s great – You’re a real patron of the arts, Morgan, I gotta respect that – You like magic, Morgan?”

“You might say I have a slight interest.”

“Of course you do.” Jack gestured to himself. “You like what you’ve seen so far?”

Her eyes, once bright, suddenly began to narrow, and she folded her arms. “Are you referring to those cheap parlor tricks you’ve been performing the last few hours?”

The crowd reacted, laughing as though she had sucker-punched Jack in the stomach. They all believed Morgan was either part of the show, or a particularly mouthy audience member. Jack decided she was playing hard to get. Her posture was relaxing, and her eyes glinted in the sunlight. Challenge me, they said.

Jack put a hand to his heart. “Hurtful!”

The crowd laughed again.

“You’ve been watching me for a while. You can’t say I haven’t impressed you.”

“I have seen better.” She glared. “Far better.”

The crowd oohed again. One man in the crowd called out, “Damn, dawg! You gon’ take that?” There was more laughter.

Jack held out a gloved hand, smugly shushing the crowd. He kept his eyes fixed on Morgan. *Stuck up, prissy little…* “Alright, Morgan,” he said, drawing another business card from his pocket. “Let’s make a deal. If I can’t win you over with my next trick, drinks are on me. But, if I do, then you buy me a drink.” He grinned. “How’s that sound?”


“It sounds,” said Morgan, “like a bet you are about to lose.”

Jack held out his hand, and Morgan shook it firmly. “Alright, we got ourselves a bet!” The crowd cheered as Jack took a new packet of playing cards from his pocket, unboxing them and fanning them out.

“Lemme ask you something, Morgan: have you ever had a loser boyfriend?”

“A what?”

Jack ignored her. ""Hey, well, who hasn't, am I right? Ugh, men."" Laughter from the crowd. ""Hey, I can't say I'm innocent. In fact, I can be a real…” He plucked the Jack of Spades from the deck and held it out to the audience. “…JACK-ass! Eh? Eh?""

It was corny, but the crowd ate it up. There was more laughter, with the exception of an uptight mother who clapped her hands over her son's ears. Jack smirked, then turned to Morgan and held out the cards face up. She rolled her eyes at the pun.

""Okay, Morgan. There's four Jacks in this deck of cards. That's four jack-asses. You and me, we're gonna make every one of them disappear. You got that?""

“Very well.""

""Hey, alright. Let's give it up for Miss Morgan!"" The crowd cheered again. ""Okay, now I want you to go through all these cards, and I want you to pick out all the jack-asses. Take your time.""

He handed the playing cards to Morgan, then went back to handing out his event cards to the crowd. Now, however, he took time to sidle up close to his audience, waving the cards lightly with one hand as he picked pockets with the other. Occasionally he shook hands to lift a watch or expensive looking fitness tracker. He didn't plan to stay long after his performance - the tourists at Rockefeller Center would make a good audience for the rest of the week, and it was closer to the good pawn shops anyway.

The mother who had covered her son's ears growled as he worked his way through the crowd. ""Y'all ought to watch your mouth around children.""

""Just trying to make a living, ma'am."" He pressed a card into her hand, slipping her watch around his own wrist and covering it with the cuff of his glove. ""Everyone loves a magic show.""

He sauntered back out of the crowd, two wallets richer than when he'd began. Morgan was waiting with the Jacks in one hand and the rest of the deck in another.

“Here they are, Jack.” Her tone still reeked of boredom. “What happens now?”

""Alright, alright! Hey, let's give her another hand!"" The crowd applauded again. Jack took the deck of remaining cards and passed them back into his inner breast pocket. ""Now, you gotta be sure you got all of them. Those jack-asses are slippery bastards.""

The mother made a sound of utter disgust and dragged her child away. Jack grinned to himself.
“Now, what you're gonna do, is you're gonna hold them real tight, alright? Don't let them get away. I want these cards to disappear when I say so."" Jack clapped his hands and waved his fingers around Morgan's outstretched arms.

""Step right up, folks - you're gonna wanna come close now, people, every single one of you needs to keep your eyes on me, you understand? Because if you don't-"" Jack slammed his hands together against Morgan's.

Then he paused. He hadn't felt the give of the cards. He slowly removed his hands to see that they were still sandwiched between Morgan's palms.

“Was something supposed to happen?” she asked with seductive sarcasm. Someone snickered.
""Okay, honey,"" he said in a low voice, ""I need you to hold those cards tighter, alright? Like your life depends on it. If you don’t, they’re going to escape.""

Morgan nodded.

""Okay, now. One! Two!"" Jack clapped his hands against Morgan's again. This time, the cards gave, and he whisked them into the sleeve of his suit. ""Poof! Hold out your hands! As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, there is nothing hidden up her sleeves!""

Morgan stared blankly at her bare forearms. The crowd laughed.

“You know what, though? I don’t think that did it.” Jack gestured to quiet the audience again. “I guess Miss Morgan didn’t hold those cards tight enough, because –“

All at once, the four jacks poured out of his sleeve and onto the pavement. Jack stared at them. The crowd tittered as he blushed and picked them up. Morgan looked bored again, almost embarrassed for him. Her dispassionate gaze told Jack, *Come now. You can do better than that. I thought you were a magician.*

“I thought you were a magician,” she said. The crowd jeered.

“Hey now.” Jack pointed accusingly at Morgan, recovering from his confusion and putting on a showman’s face. “This is a team effort. You just didn’t try hard enough.”

Morgan had a small purse slung over her shoulder. Jack snatched it up and held it out to the crowd.

“Morgan couldn’t help me lose those jack-ass cards. Now a purse, on the other hand, well – Everything gets lost in these things, am I right, ladies?”

As the spectators laughed, Jack opened the purse. He was surprised at how completely empty it was.

“No money, Morgan?” Jack whispered. “You gotta be ready to pony up for those drinks later.”

“Oh, I think you’re the one who’s going to ‘pony up,’ as you say,” Morgan replied.

Jack shook his head. He wasn’t about to lose this bet. He displayed the purse to the crowd.

“As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, this purse is completely empty. No secret pockets, no hidden compartments. Examine it for yourselves.” He thrust the purse into the front row and let them inspect it to their heart’s content. “Morgan is an audience member just like the rest of you. No tricks. Just pure magic.”

The purse was returned; Jack held it in one hand and the cards in the other. “I can’t stress this enough, folks: come closer. I want everyone to keep their eyes on me.”

The crowd stepped in closer; Jack maneuvered himself so that Morgan was at the forefront of the crowd. Slowly, he laid each card flat on the floor of the purse. Then he palmed them out of the bag using the zipper as a neat distraction. The bag was empty before anyone in the audience could suspect otherwise.

He handed the bag to Morgan. “Prepare to be amazed, Morgan.”

“We will see.”

“Ladies and gentlemen, we’re about to get rid of some jack-asses. On the count of three, Morgan’s going to open that bag and they! Will! Be! Gone!” The crowd cheered. “Everybody count with me!”

“One!”

Jack paused. Morgan seemed to be muttering something under her breath, which made him nervous. He hoped she didn’t plan to bail on him; she actually seemed like a cool girl, but her lack of money (in New York, of all places) was more than a little suspicious.

“Two!”

Morgan turned the bag upside down, and pressed her fingers into the leather. *What is she doing?* Jack thought.

“Three!”

The first things to fall out of the purse were the four jacks which had, up until that moment, been in Jack’s sleeve. They were quickly followed by nineteen wallets, seven fitness trackers, and six watches of various retail prices.

“Hey, wait a minute,” said a man in the second row. The crowd around the pavilion was otherwise silent, anxiously patting their wrists and pockets. Morgan took over. Calmly, but quickly, she bent down and shoveled the detritus back into her purse in one fluid motion, then zipped it and hung it over her shoulder.

“Take my hand, Jack.”

Jack did so. Looking around, he saw the world frozen around him. Everyone, from the angry crowd to the tourists passing by, to the beat cop looking in on the commotion with just a little too much interest, was locked in place on the sidewalk. He yelped, and started to pull back.

“Stop!” Her grip on his hand tightened. “My abilities are not as strong as it used to be. If you let go, your audience will tear you to pieces.”

Jack stopped, but didn’t speak. Words failed him. He began to hyperventilate, his eyes widening as he realized the magnitude of what he was seeing.

“Yes, that’s it, Jack. Take it all in. This is magic. Not tricks of the eye or sleight of hand, but bending *worlds* to one’s will.”

“I…”

“Oh, that the Walls Between Worlds would open further! This act of freezing time is still the merest of child’s play.  I have seen nothingness where worlds once were. My life is purposed with the darkness of destruction.” She leaned in close, and whispered in Jack’s ear, with him straining away from her lips as far as he could. “MANNAROTH YAL’JAIDOCH. I have spoken with He Who Sits Behind The Stars, and soon shall He come.”

“What do you want from me?” Jack wheezed. He wanted to scream.

“I am not familiar with this world. I have been sent on behalf of Syr Kal Kupra, and the Void Crawler itself. I must have one to act as my guide, and the Void Crawler has chosen you. Together we will herald his coming.”

“No. No way.”

She cocked her head, still smiling, but with eyes that said, *Challenge me, and I will kill you with power you could not dare to imagine..*

“Tonight, you will first provide me with the drink you have so graciously wagered. Then you will lead me to another of the Void Crawler’s servants. He is one whose workers have investigated the void, but they are not yet aware of its true power.”

Jack’s head was spinning. Never had he met someone who sounded so thoroughly unhinged. He didn’t understand even half of what was being said. But seeing The City That Never Sleeps dead, for the first time in his life, convinced him that he was better off doing whatever she asked.

For now.

Jack put on his brightest, most fake smile. “Your wish is my command, beautiful. What’s your poison?”

###Chapter Six- Mako-jaeger

Letters old and new sat littered on the side of his wooden bed, and Eric looked at them with disinterest. The older ones were beginning to yellow, the newer still crisp and white, the ink almost still looking wet. Then there was the last letter in his hand, still sealed in its envelope, his hands shaking and not wanting to open it. *What is the use?* He thought. *If I am to die today, then what is the use of reading this letter?*
            
It had been delivered to him only an hour ago, and even now looking on the name he still sat in disbelief. His wife, Naomi, had written it. But that was impossible, Naomi had died when falling off a cliff while they were hiking. They had been climbing up the Maldren Peaks, home to legendary objects like crystals said to speak in foreign tongues. Old books had said that in the ancient days of this world, the crystals had been used to speak with the dead, a sort of vocal portal to the beyond. Eric had wanted to speak with his mother, who had died a few years prior to the event, and Naomi knew the way. In a way, her falling off the cliff was his fault.
           
*I never should have pressured you into taking me, Naomi.* He mourned. *It was my selfishness that killed you.* From where they were on the cliff, it had not been safe for him to climb down, so he had to finish the trek up, and then find a new way down. It had been a horrific day, and part of him wanted to jump, but he had kept going. When he had finally reached the top, he had seen the crystals, a rainbow of different shapes and textures. Purple, blue, green, red, and even black were littered, glowing a dim light. He had had no interest then and ignored them. As he prepared for his descent though, he had heard something, whether it was a voice or the wind, he had heard it true.

It had been one word, and it haunted him from that day on. Perhaps it was the madness in his mind from what he had seen, it would not surprise him. *It was my fault.* He thought, the wooden bed feeling hard on his arse. He had to stand to relax his muscles, but it did not distract him from mourning. He still remembered how her hand slipped, and her green eyes looking at him, terrified.

A villager had found the body, and though Eric never saw it when he had come down from the mountain the king’s police immediately arrested him. He did not blame them, two experienced climbers go up a mountain and one slips out of the other’s hand, the story would seem suspicious to anyone. Even he sometimes wondered if she slipped or he let her go, but that was probably his guilt talking.

Naomi had been the king’s daughter, and as the king’s daughter her death was investigated frivolously, and despite what Eric said about the even, her father found him guilty of her death. Reagan was not a bad man, but a man mourning the death of his daughter was not someone known to be able to listen to reason, especially when Eric was the only one who was with her when she died.

He damned himself in the interrogation with Reagan. While he wanted to be honest, he should have had more careful in his description. When getting to the part where she fell, he had broken down, and had completely lost his composure. Her ropes and gears had become intertwined, dangerously close to a gear snapping one of the ropes. So she had grabbed his hand, and as she removed the rope her hand had slipped causing her to fall and make the gear snap the rope. He had been completely honest, but because of that he seemed more suspicious, understandably so. If he had been wiser, he would have said that she did not reach him in time to grab his hand and the rope snapped. Alas, he had spoken what he had, and now he was on the death row.

Perhaps it was the insanity, but he had been surprisingly calm when he was put in his cell. He was fed only twice a day, but he did not mind. It had been two months since he was sentenced to death, but only after the first day he had cried. The majority of the letters had come in the first month, from his family: his father, brother, two sisters, and uncle. From his friends: Angela, Constance, Adrian, Benjamin and Emily. Even one from the queen, Aubery. The letters, even Aubery’s, had been reassuring. They had said that they did not believe that he was guilty, and that they would do what they could to get him out of the prison. His father, Gregory, was Duke of Venria, a small duchy, but a coastal one, and the most important one when it came to trade for the Kingdom of Yorst. However, the days had gone by, and now the day had come for him to die.
            
The letter still lay in his hand, but as he heard footsteps coming towards his cell, he knew his time was up. Whatever sick joke it was, he would not be pulled into it for the few moments he had left in this word. Looking up, he saw King Reagan, with two of his Kingsguard in bronze armor behind him. Reagan was a tall and slender man, his red hair beginning to mix with grey, and his beard brown and silver. He looked at Eric with cold and unyielding golden eyes. “It is time, Eric,” Reagan said. “Have you made peace with the spirits?” By custom it was required for the executioner to ask the prisoner, and it was supported by the priests of the kingdoms religion, Roetrism.
            
“I have made my peace,” he croaked. He could not remember the last time he drank water. It was provided, but he has lost his thirst since entering.
            
“Open the door and bind him, then bring him to the courtyard.” The king left after that, escaping from the torchlight into the darkness. There were no windows in the death row, so Eric’s eyes had to get used to the extra torchlight while being brought out by the jailor. It made him tear up, but he tried to blink it away. Reagan would take it the wrong way if he saw Eric crying, and even now he would prefer a clean death to a beating beforehand.
            
The courtyard was green, and the open spring sky painted soft clouds on the horizon. In the distance he could hear the caws and coos of several different birds, and the barks of dogs, and perhaps even the laughter of children. It was a somber day for Eric, but when brought into the courtyard, he saw and heard just another ordinary day. In the center of the courtyard was a fountain, the water falling soothing him, and the sight a sweet reminder of Naomi. It was where he had proposed, and where when they were children she had pushed him in as a joke, and he pulled her in also.
            
Reagan stood next to the fountain, a sword in hand, exposed from its scabbard. It was a long and black blade, four and a half feet tall. In the courtyard as well were Eric’s friends and his family, the dukes of the other duchies, and several lords, counts, and nobles. Him being so highborn, Eric had no doubt that this would be a very popular execution.
            
Eric was brought to his knees in front of Reagan, and the sword was aimed at his heart. By law it was illegal to decapitate, as it was considered cutting one’s mind from one’s soul. None were exempt from punishment if it happened, not even Reagan. Looking at him, his eyes red with fury and despair, Reagan said, “In the name of Amehra, spirit of justice, I sentence you to death for the murder of my daughter, Naomi.” The sword backed away, and was thrown strong and true into his heart.
            
Blackness.
            
Eric blinked, despair filling him. Was this how the next life was? His soul and mind surviving only to be surrounded by nothingness. He wanted to scream, to cry, but something kept him calm. Blackness surrounded him, but he knew it was blackness. He knew the color black, and its opposite white.
            
Suddenly, the abyss was overwhelmed with light, bright and piercing, as if his eyes were opening from a long sleep. More colors appeared as his thoughts returned to him. The ache of losing his mother and Naomi. Tastes of lemons, muffins, venison, wine, water. Smells of baking bread, perfumes, and flowers. The sounds of birds chirping and children laughing. All and more were returning to him. He opened his eyes.
            
He was still in the courtyard.
            
The people who had come to see his death were filing out, and he stood up, but none seemed to notice him. There was no pain in his chest, as he had expected. He looked down to find his body, or a copy of his body. What would one call it? He looked at his hands, his feet, and his muscular figure. All the same, even the brown prison clothing and the hole where the sword entered, and he could even feel the scar, but there was no pain. The people had left, and now others came to retrieve the body and clean up the scene, but none noticed him. Was this death? Standing around in the same world, a ghost forever.
            
Then he remembered the note sent to him by Naomi.
            
He ran back to the entrance he had come from, and sped through the halls, unnoticed by his castles attendants. Could it be possible that the note had been from her, in some supernatural way? But where were the spirits? The priests told of a life after death, could this be something in between? Could Naomi have been trying to communicate with him? It may have been madness, but he had to find out for himself.
            
The letters still remained, the one from her still on his bed, he went through the prison door, left open for cleaning, and grabbed the letter. Sitting down, he opened it, and unfolded it to find the words in her handwriting. No that was wrong, it was just one word, from the mountain. Jump.

###Chapter Three - Jackratko

*“The Inquisitors are the Hands of Aeyshur, the Lord of Order, and even the lowest ranked Inquisitor is to be considered a most noble member of society, for they are truly heroes of the Temple. The Grand Inquisitor’s authority is second only to the Serer, who speaks with the infallible Voice of Aeyshur himself, and with good reason. It is they who hunt blasphemers and expunge heresy from the land. It is they who keep close watch on the common man, and it is their solemn duty and privilege to act as judge, jury, and executioner in their dealings. It is they who spread and maintain the order demanded by Aeyshur, and it is they who destroy His enemies and the enemies of His faithful. To abandon the Inquisition is to abandon the great respect and authority that coincide with it.”*  
-Grand Inquisitor Namran, circa Fourth Millennia

“I am told, Syr Kupra, that you have made a discovery of some significance,” Inquisitor Yhuvon said, the grimace on his face making clear his reluctant presence. “Let us get on with this. Our time is not to be wasted.”

“Bite your tongue, worm, lest it be torn from your mouth!” Elder Inquisitor Ahkryn spat at his underling. “You will show proper respect before a man who was once a High Inquisitor.”
	
The two Inquisitors contrasted significantly in their attire, a reflection of the Temple’s hierarchy. The Elder was adorned in shimmering, ornate armor of gilded steel with a golden-trimmed, velvet surcoat draped over, which bore the symbol of Aeyshur: a double-edged blade, which represents the belief in a single God, within a circle, which stands for the infinity of Aeyshur’s domain and power. His legs were protected by a long, mail tasset that extended to just above his ankles, and his head was shielded by a mail coif. Such imposing adornment was unheard of outside the Temple, even amongst most neighboring states, as the process of refining steel was one many secrets kept solely by the Temple. 
	
Inquisitor Yhuvon did not dress in such ostentatious attire. Though he was restricted to his uniform by his rank, he found the flamboyant garb of his superiors to be frivolous and decadent. He dressed more simply, though his uniform was not without elegance. Yhuvon bore a long, black robe with a cardinal trim beneath an iron tasset, dark vambraces, and smooth, simple pauldrons. His head was guarded by an armored high collar that left only the front of his gaunt, pale face exposed, but was low enough on the sides to grant him restricted peripheral vision.
On both of their waists rested swords with Purger inscribed upon their sheaths in the ancient tongue of the Temple. Kupra knew these blades well, for he had once used one himself. A “Purger” is the black-steel blade of an Inquisitor, inscribed with ancient runes of fire and cooled in the blood of heretics. The swords bursted into flame after the proper incantation was spoken, and they were seen as the cleansing fire to burn away sin. Only three men alive could forge them; two of them forged only for the Temple, and the third rotted in a dungeon of another land. Possession of these blades by any except an Inquisitor was highly illegal and considered treasonous in the eyes of the Temple. 

The Elder donned a greatsword, though Yhuvon preferred a kandar, a ceremonial sickle-sword employed almost exclusively by Temple Ordinators. Before his induction into the Inquisition, Yhuvon was himself an Ordinator, one of the greatly skilled, highly-esteemed warriors who guarded the Temple from within, and thus he had an affinity for the kandar.
	
“While I appreciate the esteem, Elder, it is paramount that an Inquisitor be prudent,” Syr Kal Kupra responded with a soft smile. He was a very pragmatic man, and, though the disrespect had caught him off guard, he remembered momentarily that he no longer held the illustrious title he had earned in his younger days. His reputation from that time, however, would not disappear so easily. “If you would follow me, Your Eminences,” he said, turning and gesturing for the Inquisitors to follow him into the dig site. “I have much to show you.”
	
The sounds of picks and chisels echoed about the cave as Kal paced excitedly past his fellow site workers, the Inquisitors not far behind. Kal had requested the audit not a day prior, and, while most requests from those who are not members of the Temple are often lost in bureaucracy for months or even years before being acknowledged, Kal’s reputation from his time as an Inquisitor afforded him a certain authority within the Temple despite having left its ranks in favor of intellectual pursuits.
	
“Syr Kupra,” Elder Ahkryn said. “Your report mentioned the unearthing of the entrance to strange ruins heavily inscribed with idolatry and other heretical imagery. Grand Inquisitor Tarquin has taken personal interest in your findings.”
	
“I am honored, Elder. This is a most exciting discovery,” Kal explained eagerly. 
	
Kal’s enthusiasm surprised the Inquisitors, for he had a reputation as a cold, even stoic man, and he was notorious for his separation of his emotions from his work. They were also caught off-guard by Kal’s age, as they had assumed that his achievements as an Inquisitor reflected a career older than they presumed Kal himself to be. The aged, hardened image they had formed in their heads hardly resembled the handsome, soft-faced man who stood before them.
	
As they walked, the tunnel suddenly opened to a seemingly infinite cavern chamber. If it had a ceiling, it was consumed from sight by the engrossing darkness, which was only just staved off by the braziers that lit the path. 

There was something disquieting about the cavern, and, though neither Inquisitor could conclude exactly what was disturbing them, they attributed the feeling to the unfathomable size of the chamber. Elder Ahkryn was perhaps more disturbed than his inferior; he had never felt quite so unnerved in his decades as an Inquisitor, and he could not comprehend the cause of the dread that began to creep over his mind with each stride into the abyss.

Shortly thereafter, the entrance to the ruins came into view, partially illuminated by braziers and torches placed about, though their light could not reach its top. The Inquisitors were suddenly struck with awe, for it was quite unlike anything they could have expected. The massive ruins were carved into the rock. The craftsmanship was remarkably intricate, extraordinarily advanced, and unlike anything previously recorded. Bizarre, twisting columns heaving up narrow, arched pediments. Warped finials and strange monoliths inscribed with imagery of inhuman idols and ancient runes of a long forgotten language. On either side, the entryway was guarded by a giant, stone sentinel. Though their forms resembled men to some extent, their design depicted entities of a heritage altogether removed from Man’s. Their bestial faces were narrow and elongated, and their bodies seemed terribly slender, perhaps even sickly. Their mouths, which divided their faces evenly in two, bared massive fangs, and each of their four tendril-like arms rested against four feathered wings.

“We have estimated the ruins to be at least ten-thousand years old,” Kal said as he approached the grand entryway. 

The Inquisitors looked at each other with expressions of confusion. The younger Inquisitor glared at Kal. “Your words are blasphemy, Syr. The world is not yet four-thousand years of age.”

“Be silent,” the Elder barked at his inferior, his temper shortened by the indescribable discomfort he felt in this place. He turned to Kal. “Have you explored within the ruins, Syr Kupra?”

“Of course not, Your Eminence,” Kal answered, bowing his head respectfully. “To do so without permission would be a direct transgression against the Temple. Thusly, I have requested your audit, Eminency, so that I might receive the Temple’s blessing in the matter.”

“You expect authorization to study a monument to paganism?” Yhuvon scoffed with a look of offense as though he had been directly slandered.

“With all due respect,” Kal said, his head still bowed, “the Temple would be hard-pressed to find a better candidate to study the ruins. I assure you, there are none more qualified, nor are there any more loyal to the Priesthood of Aeyshur than me.”

A sudden, subtle smile pulled at the sides of the Elder’s lips. Like his inferior, the Elder had little interest in the ruins, though his fervent respect for the retired High Inquisitor weighed heavily on his decision. As did his burning desire to leave this place. “While it pains me greatly to admit, Syr Kupra, Inquisitor Yhuvon and I have more pressing business to attend to. Hunting heretics, expelling blasphemy… Surely, you of all people understand.”

Kal’s heart began to slow its beat as the nervous realization overcame him that he might not receive the permission he had sought. “Of course, Your Eminence,” he replied submissively, though the words gave his mouth a bitter taste. He felt a fleeting rage pass through him, though his visage disguised it well.

But the Elder continued, “Which is precisely why I am granting full authority of the site to you, Syr Kupra, with no further audit required.”

Kal lifted his bowed head, and his indifferent expression, though he fought the inclination, shifted into an excited grin. 

Inquisitor Yhuvon’s eyes grew wide, his nostrils flared, and his brow crumpled, but he knew better to protest his superior’s decree. Such insubordination would be seen as an affront to Aeyshur, though he wondered why the Priesthood would have him summoned if he wasn't even going to inspect the site thoroughly before it was explored further, and, though he'd never vocalize these thoughts, he thought it reckless and irresponsible for the Elder to grant such a privilege, especially when the site was clearly riddled in idolatry and other heathen imagery. Yhuvon believed that the site should be condemned and destroyed, and he fully intended to report his opinion to a superior. 

An excavation, of any kind, without an audit was absolutely unheard of. Every major project, especially those regarding alien cultures, was required to have an Inquisitor on-site at all times. This typically proved a great hindrance to progress, as it often took years to secure a dedicated Inquisitor for a project, and even then the eternal eye of the Temple watching over culturally-sensitive projects often ended in many findings being confiscated or destroyed for being of heretical or sacrilegious nature.

“Thank you, Your Eminence,” Kal said calmly, bowing his head again with a smirk upon his face. “You are a wise and noble champion of Aeyshur.”

&amp;nbsp;

This verdict would prove to be a grave error by the Elder, though he hardly could have predicted this at the time given Kal’s devoted reputation. The Temple only ever received one official report from the site, and the excavation remained largely a mystery until a month later when Kal Kupra’s archaeological journal was discovered during a thorough investigation led by Inquisitor Prime Yhuvon, who had been promoted for his foresight in the matter. Elder Ahkryn was stripped of his rank, publically shamed, and crucified for his oversight.

Yhuvon’s investigation found the ruins to be quite the disturbing sight. By the time the Inquisitors had reached the site, there was naught but a few gruesome corpses left behind, though only roughly half of the members of the expedition were accounted for.

That which Kupra had discovered in the ruins drove him to the brink of madness, and he returned from the brink a changed man, a man whose piety would turn to disillusionment with the theological regime, which would cultivate into a fury that would shake the Temple’s very foundation, for he had found that which the Temple had labored tirelessly for millennia to keep hidden from the masses: the truth.

Kupra’s first and only official report mentioned a tome discovered within the ruins upon a pedestal, which was carved to look like two demonic idols holding the book above their heads. It was apparent to Kupra and his colleagues that the mysterious builders of the ancient temple greatly revered and perhaps even worshipped the tome, for it seemed as if the entire ruin was constructed for its keeping. One of his colleagues, Abyl, suggested that perhaps the temple was built not for the safe keeping of the text, but was instead meant to keep the book apart from the world. Abyl’s suggestion was briefly mentioned in the official report, but Kupra regarded the concept as absurd. Kupra suspected the book to contain heresy, and he added that he dared not open the book’s cover for fear of angering Aeyshur. His report did not describe the text further. His final journal entry, however, goes more in-depth on the subject:

*Twenty-Third of Newfrost (Kal Kupra’s Final Entry)*

“The book called unto me, and I, as a scholar, could not resist but to answer its cries. Gently, I pried open the black leather cover and found its pages so perfectly preserved, it seemed impossible that it should have been sitting in such an ancient place, a place left undisturbed for countless aeons. The ink upon the page was so black that it seemed to consume the light that touched it, and in this ink was inscribed an ancient language never before studied by a scholar of the Temple, and yet somehow I could read the text without so much as knowing the characters of the language in which it was written. THRAAL’OCH OKUUM JAL’KAIDEEN. If the Temple ever discovers that I read this book, they shall crucify me or worse, though I cannot stop. I must abandon the Temple and escape into hiding, for I have tasted forbidden knowledge, and I know that it is the most satisfying and useful of all. I have peeked into the Aether and seen that which sleeps in the Abyss. I have spoken with He Who Sits Behind The Stars, and soon shall He come. MANNAROTH YAL’JAIDOCH. I am to prepare the world for His arrival, and He hath bestowed upon me the knowledge to use forces long forgotten, the forces that drive the mortal fear of darkness. DRUX RO’AN UR KRETH. His name is the Night. He is All That The Light Does Not Reach. He is the cold dark that grips the hearts of Man and fills them with bloodlust and greed. He is the Outsider. He is the Void Crawler. He is the Nothing. AEZIZAL ALIIK BELIAL. His word is truth, though it be maddening. ANZAAR ASHUR DRAGO ROTH PARTHAAL. I am His messenger. Through me, His truth is revealed, and those who heed His truth will be rewarded with great power in this life, for there is no life everlasting as the Hounds of Ashur hath promised. Those dogs know nothing. There is no good nor evil, for they are fallacies pervaded to control the masses. There is no natural Order. There is no Aeyshur. There is only the Void.”

&amp;nbsp;

Since Kupra’s disappearance, many have gone missing whilst treading alone at night. Crops have begun to wither inexplicably, and a dark gray thatch of cloud cover looms over the land, which often brings lightning and terrible, blowing winds, but never any rain. Members of the Temple have been attacked and consumed by giant, invisible monsters in broad daylight, much to the horror of those who witness the sickening scenes.

Perhaps worst of all, in the eyes of the Temple, are the highly-illicit, heretical texts that have been permeating the land. The Inquisition has confiscated dozens of these texts and apprehended the criminals who hold them. The pages of these texts contain commentary on an ancient book referred to as the Kreth Manuscript, as well as a number of tutorials on ancient alchemical techniques, incantations and rituals which hold power rivaling that of the spells exclusively taught to high-ranking members of the Temple. Possession of these heretical exegeses is a direct offense against the Lord Aeyshur and is punishable by public execution and eternal damnation in the dungeons of Aeyshur’s Court.

The apostate, Kal Kupra, has been declared a heretic and an agent of Trimehk, the Prime Evil, by the Temple, and a bounty of fifty-thousand obols has been placed on his head by the Serer himself. Those brave or foolish enough to pursue the bounty disappear into the wilderness and usually resurface as battered corpses with the same mysterious words burned or carved into their carcasses:

**“Jal’Kaideen Ro Kreth”**

###Chapter Four - Ardathered

“You have a new batch of packages to distribute,” the manager said.

“But it’s almost five,” John groaned. 

“Too bad. Look, I don’t think any of them are urgent, distribute as many as you can in the next thirty minutes.” 

“Fine. Will you at least pay me overtime?”

“Ha, you think we have the budget for that?”

John grumbled. 

“Just do what you’re told,” his manager said as he walked away from the cubicle. 

John sighed as he took a sip from his coffee. Supposedly he would mostly be assigned desk work, but for some reason he had to carry stupid stuff from lab to lab. He glanced around at the white walls of his cubicle and smiled; it wasn’t that bad. He got up from his chair and straightened his back. He pulled his dark coat out from the hanger and exited the cubicle.

He walked through the now almost empty office. His footsteps echoed in the hallways, a sound that had been carved into his brain through the last year. After a five minute walk he arrived at the receival desk. Thankfully, the man in charge of the receivals was still there.

“You again,” he said, “How come you’re the only one who stays up late?” 
John shrugged. “I guess because I don’t leave early. I heard you had a few packages for me.” 

“Quite a few.” He leaned down and took out a cardboard box with a bunch of files in it. John sighed. It would take a long time to sort all these out. 

“Thank you,” he said, then took the box and left. 

He walked through the empty corridors once again. Maybe he could do some tomorrow as well. He was almost halfway to his office when he heard another pair of footsteps coming towards him. 

He met the man just as he was turning a corner and they almost bumped into each other. The man was  slender, wearing a bright red shirt under the normal, black jacket. The man was carrying a gun which was strapped on to his waist. John was sure he had never seen the man before.

“Excuse me,” the man said as he rushed next to him. 

John picked up pace, and quickly walked back to where his desk was.  
	
&amp;nbsp;

When he was seated back at his desk, he decided he might as well start with the easy ones. He looked through the files. A bunch of tubes for the biology lab, a receipt for his department head. Well, he wouldn’t be able to give that until tomorrow. He continued to cycle through -specimens for that, another receipt for this- until his eye caught something. It was a package, with a huge, red “TOP SECRET” stamp on it. 
	
John took a big gulp. He looked behind him and listened. Nothing. He took hold of the flap which held the thing shut, but he hesitated. It was better if it wasn’t open, right? They couldn’t blame him. He looked at the receiving address:The Board of Directors. Well it was definitely above his head. He looked at the package as a whole. The package was bulging towards the bottom. He tried to feel what it was, but he couldn’t make out many details.

Then he heard something. It was the echoey sound of footsteps coming from the hall. The whole office rang with the sound. They couldn’t have been far. He froze. The footsteps were getting closer. He grabbed the package and ran out of the cubicle, towards the other corridor, to his car.

The footsteps behind him stopped just for a second, then immediately picked up speed. 

John ran through the corridor. His pursuer’s flooded his ears. He grabbed the handle of the door to the car park and pushed the door open. The sterile light of the corridors was taken over by the dim light of the car park. He ran. He ran to where he remembered his car was. He feared that, amidst all this excitement, he would miss it. He didn’t, however. Standing in front of his car, he looked back over his shoulder. He saw the man with the red shirt running towards him, who was no more than twenty seconds away.

John dashed into his car. After struggling with the keys for a few seconds, he put them into the ignition. He turned the keys. The engine started, and he immediately pushed the gas pedal. The car lunged forward. He steered away from the building and that man. John looked at him through the rear mirror. He stood there staring behind him. He didn’t have an expression of worry on his face, however.
John drove out of the car park like a madman. He crashed into the wall once and a garbage can twice. Only when he was out on the street did he manage to calm down. He then stopped at a red light just a few hundred meters away from the exit of the car park. He took a deep breath, and wiped the sweat from his forehead with his sleeve. He then rested his head on the wheel. 

“Why,” he said to himself, “Why the fuck did I have to do that?”

The light turned green and he pushed on the gas. 
	
He drove in an eerie silence for the next few hours, watching the houses go by. He didn’t know where to go, so he wandered aimlessly. He could go back to his apartment, but he decided against it, at least for the time being. He wanted to at least look at these things for which he got into such trouble. He looked around for a decent place to sit. 

He drove out of town. He didn’t know whether to leave outright or not, but he felt safer the farther away from his normal life. The sun had set. He turned turned his headlights on, but only one lit up. He sighed. One more thing to worry about.
	
After three hours of driving or so he stopped in front of a restaurant in a small town. “Lucy &amp; Chris’ American style Restaurant” the neon sign read. He entered and took a seat. The restaurant was completely empty. 

“What would you like, sir?” asked the waiter.

“Coffee.”

“Anything to eat?”

“No, thanks.”

When the waiter left John opened the package he had taken. To his surprise, there wasn’t much in it. One sheet of paper, and a ball of some sort. He looked at the paper. It read,
	
&amp;nbsp;

Ladies and gentlemen of the board,  
	My team has found a great anomaly close to our facility. This anomaly, or rather a group of multiple anomalies, seems to be a portal of some kind to another world. There also has been a disappearance. The police are currently investigating it, but we suspect it is because of the anomaly. We have also sent you the artifact that we suspect came from the anomaly; however, we still don’t know anything about it. We don’t know what the anomaly is exactly either, and currently we have no hypotheses either. Sadly, we don’t have much information. That is why we are asking for your authorization and allocation of funds for more indepth research. 
Dr. Sam Greenfield

&amp;nbsp;

John raised an eyebrow. An anomaly? He glanced down at the ball. It didn’t look very special. 

“Here is your coffee sir.”

“Oh thanks.” 

The waiter glanced at the paper and the ball as he left.
	
John took the ball in his hand and looked at it. It seemed to be made of glass, but he couldn’t make out the color properly. Black was probably the closest answer, but it wasn’t quite close enough to describe it. It had an unnerving, otherworldly feel to it. He stared at it, as if to see what what lurked in the depths of the glass ball. He thought he saw glimpses of movement in there, almost like a storm was brewing in it, or waves. He tried to get a good look, but they were there for less than a second and then, disappeared without a trace. The memory of them faded really quickly too. 

“Sir,” the waiter said as he touched John’s shoulder.

“Yes?” John said, startled. 

“You have been looking at that … thing for almost an hour now.”

John nodded and paid his bill together with a generous tip. He put the ball into his pocket and took his things back to the car. 

He drove for a few hours the way he came. He stopped at the street where he lived. He looked at his apartment from his car. No lights. He then looked at the front door of the building. There was a black car parked right in front of it.

VANESSA: [To Buford] Really? Because it looks to me like you just beat up my dad.

PHINEAS: He's not a poor man. I'm doing what needs to be done.

VANESSA: Who do you think you are?

ISABELLA: What you *need* is to go to your family counseling sessions like your mom asks. She is *so worried* about you, Phineas.

BUFORD: I'm just a guy trying to help out a couple of friends. Is that so wrong?

PHINEAS: She'll be fine. *I'll* be fine. Just let me finish this.

BUFORD: You wanna put your money where your mouth is? I ain't afraid to hit a girl!

VANESSA: And *I'm* not afraid to drop you off this *balcony* if you don't get your hands off my dad!

PHINEAS: *That's all she ever wants to do!* ""Come on, Phineas, have a snack! Phineas, let's talk!"" I'm sick of it! Talking is not going to solve the problem!

ISABELLA: I don't understand why you're being so *stubborn!*

BUFORD: I don't think you understand who you're dealing with!

VANESSA: *LET. GO.*

BUFORD: [To Ferb] Buddy, you better talk some sense into this broad before I knock her brains out!

PHINEAS: I am NOT being stubborn! 

VANESSA: [To Ferb] And YOU! When did you get the idea that you needed giant metal boxing gloves to beat up my dad? Do you have *any* idea how *stupid* you're being right now?

ISABELLA: *YES YOU ARE!* I lost someone too, but you don't see me beating people within an inch of their lives!

PHINEAS: Well maybe you just didn't care about Gretchen the way I cared about Can-

BUFORD: Isabella...

VANESSA: *LET GO OF MY DAD!*

BUFORD: Alright already! [Buford acquiesces and walks over to Isabella and Phineas. Vanessa immediately begins tending to her father.] Isabella, I think you need to leave.

ISABELLA: Buford, if you let Phineas keep going like this, I swear to God-

BUFORD: We were just gonna rough him up a bit, that's all. Nothing you need to worry your pretty little head about. I'm making sure things don't get out of hand.

ISABELLA: It still isn't healthy.

PHINEAS: Forget it. I'm done anyway. [To Ferb] Come on, let's go.

VANESSA: Oh, no you don't. I'm not finished with any of you. You guys are all staying here until the authorities arrive.

PHINEAS: [Idly] You can't keep us here.

VANESSA: No, but Perry will. Perry?

[PERRY enters, nervous, with fedora in hand.]

DOOF: Perry the Platypus, where were you five minutes ago? [Coughs] Your owners could have killed me!

[Perry ignores Doof. and types a message into his audio translator.]

PERRY: OWCA wants me to bring you two in. Don't make this harder than it has to be.

&gt; Producer's Note: Still need to secure vocal talent for Perry's translator. Why hasn't Sean Connery returned our calls?

***

There was a special place in Norman's heart for the Fourth of July. Every year, the office rented space at the city park to hold a picnic. It was quite the celebratory affair. Everyone in the building came out in their best casual clothing, laid out red-white-and-blue blankets and towels out on the grass, ate hotdogs, and played rousing games of volleyball out on the sand courts.

Norman's part in the festivities was simple. He was to bring the potato salad. It was a simple job, but Norman took pride in his work, using an old family recipe which he'd first learned at the tender young age of thirteen. ""The secret,"" his mother had told him, ""is that each new generation adds an ingredient they think will go best with the current taste."" His mother's sister, being the older of the two, had added a dash of lemon juice. Norman had deliberated for some time before settling on classic Dijon mustard. Norman's mother had taken one bite and declared it was the best potato salad she had ever eaten.

That Monday, Norman arose at 9 AM and went about his morning routine. Instead of putting on his work slacks and a dress shirt, however, Norman opted to wear jeans and a simple Hawaiian shirt decorated with pictures of tiny palm trees. He briefly debated whether or not he wanted to wear sandals or tennis shoes, then decided to compromise. *Socks and sandals it is,* he mused.

Norman mewed happily as Norman entered the kitchen. ""Happy Fourth of July, Norman!"" Norman greeted his cat. He opened the fridge to check on the already-finished potato salad chilling in the crisper and retrieve some bread and jam for his breakfast. Then he went to the pantry to get a can of tuna to add to Norman's dish. He scooped the tuna out over Norman's regular kibble, and let Norman dig in.

Norman left the house at 10 with the potato salad tucked safely in a patriotic-looking cooler, surrounded with several bags worth of ice. The radio played a big-band rendition of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" halfway through the trip. Norman tapped his fingers on the steering wheel the whole way through the song.

Lisa was in charge of the picnic food, as she was nearly every year. Once Norman arrived at the park, she directed him to the pavilion and had him set down the cooler on a picnic table.

""There it is,"" she said, lifting the Tupperware containers out of the cooler. ""Norman's World Famous Potato Salad!""

Norman blushed. ""I'm glad you like it.""

""Norman, could you do me a huge favor? We don't have enough lemonade, and I need someone to buy some more. Could you do that?"" Norman accepted. It took him three tries, but he finally found a convenience store that wasn't closed and used his company card to buy five more gallons of lemonade. By the time he returned, it was time to eat.

Norman spent the afternoon watching his coworkers play volleyball and fielding comments about the ""superior quality"" of his potato salad. He thanked them for the kind words, but politely declined to give anyone the recipe. Around three, Norman received a text message from his son:

&gt; Hey dad, just wanted to say thanks for emailing me the potato salad recipe. My friends love it. I decided to add some bacon bits to the recipe though, I hope you don't mind. Maybe next year I'll come down and you can make it your way. Happy Fourth. TTYL

Below was a picture of Norman Jr. and his girlfriend on the beach. Norman chuckled to himself and sent a reply.

&gt;Bacon bits on potato salad sounds perfect. 

He watched the fireworks that evening with pride in both his country and his son.

""In what has been deemed a ""monumental achievement"" by scientists the world over, Planetoid US-51, or 'Nutroid,' will be anchored directly to Earth in twenty-four hours via the world's first space elevator. As you may recall, Nutroid was admitted by both the Senate and the House, by over 92% of the vote in each house, to become the USA's fifty-first state at approximately this time last year. Various government officials, including several from the United Nations, have already traveled via spacecraft for the world's first off-planet press conference, along with journalists from every major news outlet in America. We will now be turning to one of our many first-ever Interplanetary On-Scene Reporters, Aurora Marks. Mrs. Marks, are you there?""
***
The Pandora Research Industries' Superluminal Communications Establishment had been abuzz with activity for the last forty-eight hours. In a space the size of a college football stadium (and this was just the production-control room), all posts were manned with the best and brightest of audio-visual engineers, camera operators, and astrophysicists. They watched their monitors intently as interns zipped around the room with coffee orders and flash drives of sensitive data covering everything from orbital pattern adjustments to a severely detailed pre-broadcast report from no less than forty-seven hair and makeup teams.

Today was the most important day in space history since the Apollo 11 moon landing, and was projected to be the most-watched television broadcast in America since Super Bowl XLIX by more than 96%. This was no run-of-the-mill story, and would not be treated as such, which was why PRI was tasked by the American government to operate the planet's first faster-than-light communications array. Every byte of information, from the video being broadcast by each camera, to the tiny blue logos of Twitter and Facebook, was being routed through the SCE at such high speeds and definition, it would be as though each reporter and microblogger were conducting their interviews mere footsteps away from the viewers.

Liam Jankovich, Head Production Engineer for the SCE, flipped through the inter-establishment communication lines until he found the one for the official Pandora News Channel. He put on his Whitetooth^TM headset and queued up the live feed. This would be the first channel to output a live broadcast. So far, all that had been transmitted to the public consisted of text and static images. Private testing had gone well, however, and there was no doubt the transmission would go smoothly.

""Transmission stability at 100%,"" said the voice over the headset. ""FTL communication is a go. Sector One, switch to Camera Prime-Alpha.""

""Camera Prime-Alpha is a go. Transmission stable.""

""We're live in ten... nine...""
***
""I'm here, Ellis."" Over her own Whitetooth, Aurora could hear the Sector One Ground Team cheering over the successful broadcast. She smiled broadly in Nutroid's artificial atmosphere, knowing her face was being transmitted to televisions and computers in every country on Earth. The show had begun, and soon every other news station present on the planetoid would be linked to the SCE to begin their own broadcasts, but at the moment the spotlight was hers and hers alone.

""I'm standing on the surface of Planetoid US-51 right now. It's a balmy seventy-four degrees, thanks to Nutroidian life-support technology, and we are currently less than twenty-four hours away from our final landing in Earth space. We are traveling at over four percent the speed of light, and if you'll look closely, you can see the rings of Saturn as the Nutroidians conduct the first of several gravity-assisted deceleration manuevers.""
***
""Sector One, switch to Camera Prime-Epsilon.""

""Camera Prime-Epsilon is a go. Spectral filter engaged and ready.""
***
The fifth cameraman turned Camera Epsilon upwards, enabling the spectral filter as he did so. The filter acted as a compact telescope observatory, bypassing the Nutroidian atmosphere and providing the closest, clearest images of Saturn since the Voyager 2.

""As you can see, we're moving very quickly, and Saturn will only be viewable by the naked eye for a few more hours. By then, however, we will begin our flyby of Jupiter, and we may even be able to get a closer look inside Jupiter's atmosphere using a new prototype of PandoraTech Palladium Frequency Cameras.""
***
""Thank you, Aurora,"" said Ellis. He turned to the main camera in the SCE Home Base studio. ""Up next, we'll be conducting an interview with Amal Nejem, one of the pilots of the faster-than-light spacecraft responsible for bringing Aurora and every other Nutroidian visitor out to space. But first, a quick break and a word from our sponsor.""
***
Aurora took off her headset. It would be a few hours before she was called on for another report. Each major radio and TV news channel were scheduled to have the world's first live interviews with Nutroidian diplomats as soon as their uplinks to the SCE were established. She would rest, get something to eat, then travel across the planet to a mountain-esque peak where they would set up the PFC. She bounded over to meet the camera crew, enjoying the effect of the planetoid's weak gravity. Two of the cameramen stood over both of the PFCs, looking confused.

""What's wrong?""

""Minor malfunction,"" said Damien, who was in charge of Camera Prime-Delta, the backup PFC. ""Shouldn't be a problem, but it's best to get this sorted out before we go offsite.""

""Okay,"" she replied. ""Let me know when you're finished.""
 
""Actually, can you help us with this?"" asked Vega, the Alpha cameraman. ""We need an extra set of hands, and the others are packing the rover.""
 
""Oh. Sure thing."" Aurora bent down over the camera's protective case. ""Just tell me what you need.""

The PFC was an unwieldy device, even considering the reduced gravity, so it took both Damien and Vega to hold it upright as Aurora searched the various panels and components. She had been briefed on the inner workings of the camera, though not to the same degree as the operators, so they took turns pointing Aurora to what needed checking.

In essence, the Palladium Frequency Camera was a highly sophisticated X-ray. Unlike an X-ray camera, however, it could see deeper into any given surface, even across multiple atmospheres. It streamed at high resolutions, and was far less radioactive. Its primary components were a palladium-based film (hence the name) and an integrated lens, which together could perceive almost the entirety of the electromagnetic spectrum.

After five minutes, they had yet to find the problem. ""Well,"" Vega huffed, ""I give up. Pack it, and let's get some lunch.""

""You still haven't even told me what's wrong with it!"" By now, Aurora was invested in figuring out the problem, despite the fact that she had no idea what she was looking for. ""Everything looks like it's working!""

""Yes, but the video we're receiving is all wrong. Here, I'll show you."" Vega brought out a tablet and scrolled down to a grainy-looking video. ""We pointed the camera down at the surface to test it. All we should be getting is scans of solid rock. Instead, we got this.""

Aurora watched. The video showed figures moving in a fairly regulated manner. ""What am I looking at?""

""Best we can tell, the PFC is picking up movement on the other side of the planet. But we only set it for five miles, which means the calibration is off.""

""What did the other camera pick up?""

""Pretty much the same thing,"" said Damien. ""Why? What are you thinking?""

It was too organized. Aurora got a sense of unease just from looking at the video. The way those little dots on the screen moved with near perfect synchronicity, and in neat rectangular shapes. It reminded her of...

""Turn on the other camera and try again."" When the men stared at her, she stamped her foot, and nearly fell over after misjudging her strength on the planet's surface. ""Just try it. I have a hunch.""

It took them another three minutes to unload the other PFC. By now, the other cameramen were finished packing, and were able to help set up the camera the same way it had pointed for the first test. Aurora and Vega stood, holding the tablet, as the live video began to stream in.

""Well?"" asked Vega.

Aurora turned to him. ""There's nothing wrong with the camera. There really is something down there.""

""What?""

""It reminds me of...""
***
""An army?"" Liam twisted his Whitetooth deeper into his ear. ""Did I hear you right?""

""Yes! A giant army, below the surface of Nutroid,"" Aurora replied. It had taken over an hour, but she had finally gotten a direct link to the head of the SCE. ""Look at the video we sent you!""

""I see it."" Liam shook his head. ""But why would they need an army? There could be any number of reasons Nutroidians are below the surface.""

""Not if they're moving the way they are. My father was a sergeant in the Marines. Those are American military formations, like we sent the Nutroidians in the Constitution Broadcast."" Liam started to speak, but Aurora talked over him. ""You know the story of the Trojan Horse?""

""Yes...""

""This entire planet is their Trojan Horse. We think it's a gift, but it's full of aliens that will open Earth up to an attack. And they have the upper hand, because half of our planet's leaders are here with them!""

""Mr. Jankovich, sir?"" An intern on the floor caught Liam's attention. ""I just spoke with Broadcast Team Beta. They're saying they have a problem with their PFCs picking up strange movements...""

Liam paled. ""Mrs. Marks? I'm going to have to call you back.""

""Good morning, Kathy!"" Dan smiled broadly as he entered the waiting room, his hands tucked suggestively behind his back. Kathy sat at her desk, as she always did, and didn't smile in return as he approached. ""How are you doing today?""

""Coffeemaker's still broken,"" she spat.

""Hmm."" Dan revealed his hands. ""Well, I've got some coffee right here. You're probably not interested though-""

Kathy snatched one of the cups out of his hand and drained half the contents into her mouth before Dan could finish. 

""...That was mine.""

""Too bad."" She slammed the paper cup onto her desk.

""What, you're not going to say thank you?""

""I'll thank you when you get Maintenance to come in and install a new coffee machine.""

Dan shook his head. ""It's not my fault they're busy. Besides, last time they came in you threatened to run Manuel's hands through the garbage disposal.""

Kathy huffed and turned to her computer. ""It wasn't a threat, it was a promise.""

""Right."" Dan stared miserably at the cup of coffee in his own hand. Extra creamer, just the way Kathy liked it. To him, it was undrinkable. He set it down on an end table. ""What does my schedule look like today?""

""Same old, same old."" Without looking away from the old monitor, she slid a folder across the desk. ""Here's your first appointment. Some hotshot named Randy Kelmond.""

""Of MediaPass Incorporated? Huh."" Dan scratched his head. ""That's a real shame. He does good work.""

""My heart bleeds for him."" Kathy downed another sip of coffee.

Dan shook his head and made a mental note to pick up more coffee before his appointment. ""Alright, I'm heading out. Make sure you get to finishing that policy memo before lunch.""

""Whatever. Thanks for the coffee."" She began typing.

So she *had* thanked him after all. Dan smiled to himself as he summoned his scythe and disappeared in a flash of light and smoke.
***
At precisely 9:03 AM, Randy Kelmond was seated at his desk, wondering why on earth he was having such odd chest pains, when an anthropomorphic skeleton wearing a hood and cloak appeared directly in front of him.

""Mr. Kelmond? My name's Dan."" The skeleton put out his hand to shake. ""I'll be your Grim Reaper today. It's a pleasure to meet you.""

Randy was slow to respond, but he eventually accepted the handshake. ""...You too, I'm sure.""

""Oh, you're too kind, really."" Death's voice was warmer than Randy would have expected. ""I mean it, though. You have been such an inspiration to the people who live on Earth.""

""It's nothing...""

""It's everything! Starting your own software company at seventeen, making the Fortune 500, not to mention your charitable foundations! I could go on.""

He was nice, Randy decided. He scratched the back of his neck, slightly embarrassed as he stood from his desk. ""I never expected the Grim Reaper to be a fan, of all people.""

""Oh, you have lots of fans upstairs. You're going to good places after you die, let me tell you.""

Randy paused. ""What about my family?""

""They're in good hands, don't worry. If you want, you can even fill out an AngelMail form once we get to my office. You know, send them a comforting message and such.""

Randy nodded. Dan was pleased his appointment was going so well. People of Randy's stature normally left the mortal coil kicking and screaming, but he had always been rather humble in spite of his many accomplishments.

""Now, if you'll just place your hands on the scythe-""

There was a knock on the door. Dan whipped around.

""Mr. Kelmond?"" In walked a short Hispanic woman wearing a flower print dress and three-inch heels. She carried a clipboard, a pen, and an air of arrogant sophistication. ""I've finished-""

Her mouth dropped open, as did Randy's. Dan's mouth, for lack of skin and musculature, did not, although somehow his shock and confusion were still readily apparent.

""Um...""

She screamed. ""What are you doing? Why are there two Randys? And what is that *thing?*""

Randy realized, for the first time, that he was standing next to his own lifeless physical body. Instinct told him to be sick, but he no longer had control over his esophagus.

""Randy? Stay with me."" Dan turned Randy to face him. ""Just don't look at the body, okay? It'll only upset you.""

""What's going on?""

""It would seem,"" said Dan, eyeing the woman, ""your secretary is Death-Sensitive. She's the only human that can see the two of us right now. It's actually very rare.""

""*You killed him?*"" she screamed. ""How *dare you?*""

""Ma'am-""

""You put him back in his body right this instant! Do you have *any idea* who he is?""

""Well, this is a first,"" Dan muttered. ""Ma'am, what's your name?""

""You are *interrupting* a very important day for Mr. Kelmond!""

""It's, uh, Regina,"" Randy whispered.

""Right. Ms. Regina?"" She stopped. ""Now, I'm very sorry about this, but I can't exactly 'put him back.'""

""I want to speak with your supervisor. Right now.""

""With my- Is she serious?"" Dan pointed his scythe accusingly at Regina. ""Ma'am, I *am* the supervisor.""

""I'm sorry, may I?"" Randy stepped around Dan and approached the secretary. ""Regina, this is very important. I need you to call my family-""

""No!"" Regina shoved the clipboard in Randy's face. ""You have seven conference meetings this week alone! You can't afford to take time off! Tell him you're busy!""

""Do you even know how death works?"" Dan groaned.

""Regina, please!""

""That skeleton can call to my desk and book an appointment just like everyone else!""

""This is getting ridiculous."" Dan held out his scythe. ""Mr. Kelmond, we really need to be going. I can have someone come in and handle your secretary as soon as possible, but I have a very busy schedule to keep.""

""You can't possibly be busier than-""

""Regina!"" Randy shouted. ""That's enough. I need you to call my wife and my attorney, as well as 911. Then I need you to cancel my appointments for the rest of the week.""

""Mr. Kelmond-""

Randy took hold of the scythe before Regina could finish. He and Dan disappeared, and arrived instantly in the waiting room of Dan's office. Kathy was still typing on the computer.

""Kathy, I need you to make some phone calls."" She didn't respond, her bones clattering across the keys. ""Kathy!""

""MADAM!"" Randy's voice shocked her out of her routine. ""You will treat Mister Dan here with the proper respect! He is an excellent Grim Reaper, and I will be *damned* if his own secretary does not treat him with the proper respect!""

""I... Yes, sir."" Dan marveled at how quickly Kathy's demeanor changed. She reached into her cloak and pulled out a company-issued scroll. ""What do you need?""

""Randy's secretary was a Death-Sensitive."" She immediately began scribbling down notes. ""I need you to make calls to the Cleanup and Recruitment Departments and make sure she doesn't tell anyone about what happened. Then I need you to get some AngelMail forms for Mr. Kelmond.""

""I'll get right on it."" Kathy immediately picked up the phone and dialed the operator. ""Hello, this is Kathy from Department 29141...""

""How did you do that?"" Dan asked Randy.

""You just have to know how to handle them. I did a leadership seminar on it once."" Dan held the door open as Randy walked into Dan's office. ""I apologize about Regina though. She's going through a rough divorce, and I've been trying to give her a bit of space.""

""No problem."" Dan sat down at his desk. ""So, here's how the Death process works...""

She stood atop an odd outcropping of black rock that should never have been where she was standing. Water was there, as well, a strange sight to see in the place of the temple courtyard. *Where was she, really?* I thought to myself. *Surely this place would never be in such disarray-*

She turned, and I gasped in shock. The woman standing above the waves was *me.*

As I watched her step off the small hill, the details of the scene fell into my head like a waterfall. This *was* the temple, or at least it had been, but all that was left were a few stray pillars barely able to keep purchase on their foundation. One fell, agitating the already violent waves and sending swarms of sea creatures darting for cover elsewhere in the sea. 

I could feel them swimming and squirming around under my feet, as though they were swimming in my brain rather than the water. Underneath them was the polished stone of the temple walkways. They were beaten down, cracked and split open from the wear of constant tides and from the demolished pieces of the temple roof. The rock was the key, I realized. It had come from the sky and blasted the temple into oblivion. But how? And why? I searched the sky for answers, and was greeted with the most horrific sight of all.

The heavens were ablaze. The presence of the gods was there, shrouding the sun and making the sky brighter than I had ever seen it before. Around the entrance to the heavens, clouds spun in a maddening typhoon, dark and brooding. They threatened to scour the earth with rain further; I could see lightning arc between them as they swirled around and around the opening of the sky. Through all the spectacle of rage and destruction, one thing was clear, and one thing only. *Here, a god has taken his revenge.*

Now my own self stood before me, the one that had come from the enormous black stone on the water. She was older than me, it seemed. It was not by more than a few months, but the evidence was in her countenance. She was matured, worldly wise and world-weary. Her robe was torn, the sleeves and back showing enough skin so as to barely call the poor thing clothing. But there were no marks upon my older self's skin.

The dress had belonged to my mother.

My shock was clear. Yet my older self waited patiently only inches away. I noted, only dimly, that we both stood on the water's surface without sinking. My curiosity overcame me, and I knew from her expression that she expected me to ask a question.

""What happened here?""

In response, she lifted her right arm to the height of my heart, and pressed her palm into my chest, closing her eyes as she did so. I shut my eyes as well, but not willingly. They were forced closed from the pain of what she was doing to me. Flashes of heat exploded throughout my body as she concentrated. I gritted my teeth together and tried to remain still. After some time, an image began to form.

It was as though I were looking down into the center of a deep well, with the image sunk deep at its bottom. I forced the eye of my mind to look closer. More and more details were revealed as I pressed myself further into the well, until all at once, I was in the center of another world.

In this scene, I could see the temple whole and unblemished, albeit far in the distance. But that did not last for long. The swirling clouds began to form, the center of the typhoon centered upon the temple as the sky above split open. There, again, was the presence of the gods, ready to tear down the place of worship I had known since before I could walk. And it began with the stone.

It was thrown down upon the sanctuary with such speed and ferocity that it emitted thunder as it fell. The clouds broke in the same moment, and rain fell. From where I stood, in the forests on the outskirts of town, I saw people. They had no time to react, no time to muse upon their fate, before the boulder flew into the temple and flattened it completely.

The ground shook. The rain thundered down upon the city, and from below the crater, geysers of water shot out from under the rock, blasting the rubble away from where it had landed. Its intensity grew, and as all but the pillars around it washed away, the flood headed straight for me.

I jerked away, severing my connection with my older self. Her hand dropped, and we both panted in agony, she from exertion and I from fear. I collapsed, and rested on the surface of the water. It was as smooth as glass where we rested, but around us the waves were still threatening. She recovered quickly, however, and composed herself. Now it was her turn to speak.

""The God of Oracles favors you.""

I shook my head, my hand over my still beating heart. ""I don't understand.""

""He has given you the gift of prophecy,"" my older self replied. ""It is an honor and a blessing. You should not take it lightly.""

""How would this be a blessing to me?""

""It can be a blessing to the entire city. You have seen a vision, and with this knowledge, you will be able to save the lives of everyone you know.""

I stood again. Taking in the sight of the ruined temple was too much for me to bear. I focused on the face of my older self. There was a haggard look to her, and not the pride one would expect from having favor with the God of Oracles.

""He wishes to have me.""

Her frown grew deeper at this. ""It is a small price to pay - no price at all, in fact. He loves you more than any other in this world or the Pantheon. He will love you for all time.""

""I know when I am being lied to,"" I growled. ""I know when *I am lying.* What are you not telling me?""

""...It is of no importance.""

""I never wished for his affections. I am betrothed to a man that I love. You know this."" I turned away and folded my arms in protest. ""You may tell the God of Oracles-""

My older self yanked me by the shoulder, forcing me to face her. Beyond us, the clouds picked up speed, still circling the hole in the heavens.

""Regardless of your engagement,"" she said, ""it would not be wise to refuse his advances.""

I stared at her in indignation. ""You may tell the God of Oracles that I am not interested in his gift. Let him find someone else on which to lavish his affections.""

Lightning pealed, striking a column that stood in the water. I jumped, but my older self stayed rooted to the water's surface. Her eyes darkened.

""You foolish child! How hard is it to grasp the lives you lost by refusing him?"" she roared. ""Your family is dead! Your friends have drowned! Innocent lives were crushed underneath a rock because you wouldn't follow good sense!""

Thunder rolled across the surface of the water. The plane underneath our feet shifted and shook. It caught me off guard, and I stumbled. My older self grabbed me by my arms and hoisted me upwards.

""It's too late now."" There was fear in her eyes as she spoke. ""He won't give you another chance.""

The urgency in her voice stirred something in me. I didn't want to believe her. I shook my head vehemently. The water began to roil underneath my feet.

""Why are you wearing my mother's dress?"" It wasn't the question I wanted to ask, but it came out before I could stop myself.

""Mother and Father thought I was crazy,"" she replied. Her voice softened. ""The God of Oracles twisted his blessing into a curse, a fate worse than death. But they still wanted me to be happy. Mother gave me this dress the night before the wedding.""

Realization dawned on me. ""The temple...""

""Yes. The God of Oracles demolished the temple on the day we were to be wed."" Her voice wavered. ""I - you - were the only survivor.""

A small wash of seafoam passed over my feet. I saw with horror that a wave was building on the horizon. It showed no signs of slowing down.

""No. I can't believe it. I don't want to believe it."" I started to take a step forward, but slipped as the water gave way beneath me. ""Let me speak to him. I'll do whatever he asks!""

""It's too late.""

""It's not too late!"" I leaned against a column for support, but it cracked on my hand and plummeted into the water. It only served to anger the tides further. The wave in the distance came faster with each passing second, and dread filled my stomach.

""Apollo!"" I screamed. ""Apollo! Take me back! I will accept your gift! Just leave my mother alive!""

My future self approached me in the water, as the giant tidal wave rushed to drown me. She paid it no mind. Instead, she kissed me tenderly on the cheek. The gesture was more miserable than any tears she could have shed, yet she still cried as she turned to face me.

""Poor Cassandra,"" she said. ""Even you don't believe your own visions.""

""So, uh, what do you like to do for fun?""

She stirs her martini straw with one hand. ""Oh, you know. Sex, drugs, rock and roll. Normal stuff, really. God, who do I have to kill to get our food to come faster?""

I wince. I'm beginning to wonder if I should have chosen a enemy meeting instead of a soulmate one. A fight to the death would have been way more preferable to an awkward date. Of course, from what I know about Haley from her profile, she probably would have been just as bored then, too.

""Oh, finally!"" Her head snaps up when our waiter exits the kitchen. He doesn't come to our table. ""Fuck. This is taking forever. You wanna blow? I know this great dive bar-""

""NO!"" I almost shout. ""Let's just... Where do you work? Let's talk about that.""

""You know, you are way more boring than I thought you'd be.""

""What?""

""Favorite band."" She snaps her fingers. ""Go.""

""Uh...""

""Five seconds!""

""...Postmodern Jukebox?""

""You *listen* to that crap? *Willingly?*""

""You put me on the spot!"" I scratch the side of my neck. ""I'm not really a band person.""

""Oh my God.""

""Well, what's yours?""

""Led Zeppelin."" She takes a sip of her martini, eyeing me. ""Let me see your tattoo.""

Instinctively, I take my arms off the table. ""Why?""

She rolls her eyes. ""If your tattoo doesn't match mine, I'll punch you in the teeth. And if it does, well... you've got a lot of catching up to do.""

""What's that supposed to mean?""

""Put up or shut up, Charlie."" She puts both her elbows on the table. ""I'll show you mine if you show me yours.""

I'd been dreading this. It was bound to happen eventually but I'd never felt like I had a chance to prepare. Slowly, I begin to roll up the sleeve on my right arm. She does the same. The first things I notice are the long, jagged scars running all the way up her forearm. She's cut her skin, made herself bleed. My stomach sinks.

But our tattoos match. In the crook of my elbow is an open book, pages turned away, with the phrase ""Book of Secrets"" emblazoned in gold lettering on the front cover. The same as hers.

She runs her fingers across it. Her demeanor has changed, fiery stubbornness turned to quiet concentration. I pull my arm away.

""I guess we're stuck with each other."" I unroll the sleeve of my shirt. ""I could learn to like rock music-""

""Other arm,"" she barks.

""What? Why?""

""Just do it."" She sounds as defensive as I feel. ""I want to know.""

I feel like she already does know. She has to. But I obey. Her left arm has the same scars, and the same tattoo. All four of our elbows match. 

For a long time, neither of us speak. Long enough for the waiter to finally come to us with our meal. She has the steak, and I have a salad. We eat in silence.

""I got bullied in school a lot."" I break the silence. ""Because of my tattoos.""

She nods. ""Me too.""

""What do you think it means?""

""Hell if I know.""

""Do you, maybe, want to talk to someone about this?"" She cuts into the last bite of her steak and doesn't answer. ""I have a psychologist-slash-relationship-counselor that I visit once a week. She told me that, once I met you, she'd like to talk us through things.""

Haley pushes her plate away. ""No. I'm not doing that.""

""Here me out.""

""No, Charlie."" She pushes her chair away from the table. ""I... I'm not doing any of this.""

""You're leaving?""

""Do you have any idea how fucked up this is?"" She's started crying. ""For all I know, you could kill me in my sleep. Or I could kill you!""

""I would never-""

""I don't want to make a life with my worst enemy!"" We stand up at the same time. ""I have *never* wanted that! I don't even want to be here *now*!""

""I'm not your enemy!""

""*Yes you are,*"" she hisses. ""You have *always* been my enemy. And I am *always* going to hate you, no matter what my arms say."" She grabs her purse from the floor. ""Have a nice life, asshole.""

We've made a scene. All eyes are on her as she storms out of the room toward the lobby. Then all eyes turn to me. My face grows hot as I reluctantly sit back down.

After a few minutes, the waiter approaches me cautiously. ""Sir...""

""Just bring me the check."" I run my hands through my hair. ""I'm sorry for the commotion.""

""The check has been paid, I am pleased to say. In cash, and with quite the generous tip.""

**""ABRAHAM POOCHIEPIE FLUFF-FACE, YOUR TIME HAS COME!""**

Marcie started awake, and upon sitting up, discovered that she was staring straight into the face of a hooded skeleton. She screamed.

**""DEAR WOMAN, YOUR SILENCE WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.""**

She screamed again. ""Who are you?! What are you doing in my home?""

**""THE TIME HAS COME FOR YOUR LABRADOR POODLE TO BE REAPED-""**

""Stay back!"" By this time, Marcia's husband was awake and had dug out a small silver revolver from the bedside table. ""Get out or I'll shoot!""

**""FOOLISH MAN, YOUR BULLETS MEAN NOTHING TO ME.""** With his giant scythe, he stepped forward and chopped the gun out of the man's hands. He yelped.

**""I CANNOT BE KILLED BY ANY HUMAN MEANS,""** the skeleton continued. **""I AM DEATH ITSELF, A FORCE SO POWERFUL YOU COULD NOT BEGIN TO RECOGNIZE MY TRUE PHYSICAL FORM.""**

The man sunk to the floor in a state of catatonia. Marcie crossed the bed and fell down next to him. ""Gerald? Gerald, get up!""

The skeleton, oblivious to their suffering, turned his attention back to the dog, which had been lying patiently on the bed since the Grim Reaper's arrival. It sniffed the air and let out a small *woof*.

**""POOCHIEPIE ABRAHAM FLUFF-FACE, YOUR TIME HAS COME!""** the skeleton continued.

""What do you want with him?"" Marcie wailed. The Grim Reaper turned again, seeming almost impatient as he spoke in booming tones.

**""YOUR DOG IS SLATED TO DIE THIS NIGHT. WE STAND IN THE SPACE BETWEEN TIME, WHEREIN YOU ARE FREE TO SAY YOUR FINAL GOODBYES. ACT NOW, WHILST I STILL HAVE MERCY ON YOUR PET'S POOR AND FRAGILE SOUL.""**

Gerald, upon hearing this, slowly came to his knees. The skeleton didn't move. Feeling slightly bolder, Gerald clapped his hands and whistled.

""Here, Abe. C'mere, boy.""

Abe obediently hopped off the bed and nosed his way into Gerald's arms. The couple quietly embraced their dog, Marcie weeping as she did so.

""But he's so healthy,"" she sniffled. ""Why are you taking him?""

**""I KNOW NOT AND CARE NOT FOR THE WELL-BEING OF CREATURES ON THIS PLANE. I CARRY OUT THE WILL OF THE UNIVERSE ITSELF.""**

""We're not ready!""

**""CAN ANYONE TRULY BE PREPARED FOR DEATH? A LUDICROUS CONCEPT.""**

""Please..."" Gerald found himself unsure of how to address the cloaked figure. ""Please, sir, is there anything we can do to... to have a little more time?""

The Grim Reaper paused. **""YOU WISH TO SAVE THE LIFE OF THIS ANIMAL?""** They both nodded. **""WHAT YOU SPEAK OF IS NO LESS THAN AN EXCHANGE OF LIFE. IF YOUR DOG WILL BE SPARED, A HUMAN MUST DIE.""**

""Wh... a human? But that's not fair!"" Marcie cried.

**""DO YOU EXPECT ME TO SPARE YOUR ABRAHAM AND RECEIVE NOTHING IN RETURN? THIS IS THE PRICE YOU MUST PAY. MAKE YOUR DECISION.""**

Gerald's face was becoming pale. His arms dropped from Abe's sides, encouraging the dog to go seek a strange new smell that had appeared downstairs. The Grim Reaper shut the door behind as Marcie turned to her husband.

""What are we supposed to do? We can't let someone die!""

""Maybe it's not as bad as he says,"" Gerald mused. ""I mean, what if this person is already sick? Or they were going to die anyway?""

""Abe wasn't! You think he *cares?*"" Marcie's voice was incredulous. ""Besides, it's still wrong. I can't do that to some poor family. They deserve more time just as much as Abe does.""

By now Gerald was crying. All the while the cloaked skeleton stood stoic and unmoving. Without a face, it was difficult to judge his expression.

**""MAKE YOUR DECISION.""**

Gerald nodded, sadly, and they both stood. Marcie began to speak.

""You can have-""

There was a knock at the door. Gerald blinked. Marcie stared at the door for about three seconds before fainting onto the bed.

""Zeke? Is that you in there?"" said a voice.

**""AW CRIPES, HERE WE GO.""** The Grim Reaper crossed the room to the door, sounding oddly peeved as though he had been expecting to be interrupted. The door opened to reveal an almost identical cloaked skeleton figure. Abraham bounded back into the room, skirting between their legs and onto the bed, where it began to lick Marcie on the face.

**""DID MANAGEMENT SEND YOU?""**

""Okay, first of all, quit the booming voice crap. I could hear you from a block away. Second, yes Management sent me. You think I *want* to deal with this right now?""

Marcie stirred and sat up. ""What-""

""Mr. and Mrs. Noveno? My name's Dan,"" the second skeleton said as he stepped forward. ""Let me just say on behalf of the Management that we are *so sorry* for what you went through just now.""

""Dude,"" said the first skeleton, now quieter.

""Don't talk to me, Ezekiel."" Without looking back at the first skeleton, Dan reached back and pointed at Ezekiel with the blade of his own scythe. ""This is the sort of thing that gets you fired, and I am *not* covering your ass on this.""

""You know I wasn't actually gonna-""

""Really?"" Dan reached into his robe and pulled out a parchment scroll. ""Because according to Records, you've already reaped four unscheduled pets this evening.""

""...That was an accident.""

""Are you hearing yourself right now?""

""Look, it's been hard, okay? Ever since I broke up with Rita-""

""So join a boxing club. Go to Michael's and buy vases to smash with a baseball bat. Find something more constructive to do than killing pets and scaring their owners half to death!"" Dan yelled. ""It's like I'm dealing with a child! You can NOT use this job to have a temper tantrum!""

""Alright, I'm sorry!""

""Tell them that.""

Ezekiel turned to the couple. They both stared, Gerald wide-eyed and Marcie open-mouthed.

""I, uh, am sorry for threatening the life of your dog.""

""*And?*"" Dan prompted.

""...And for forcing you to take a sadistic Hobson's Choice between the life of your pet and the life of a random human being."" He turned back to Dan. ""Satisfied?""

""You're going to give that same apology to all the other 457 pet owners you woke up tonight.""

""Aw, come on.""

""You need therapy, Zeke. Wait for me outside. And don't even think about running off again like you did with Paul."" Dan waited as Ezekiel made his way out the door. Abe came up to him and sniffed.

""Cute dog,"" Dan said, kneeling to pet him. ""Abe, was it?""

""So you're not going to take him?"" Marcie asked nervously.

""No, no. Little guy's got a good long life ahead of him.""

""What a relief,"" Gerald sighed.

""Like I said, this never should have happened. You guys have my most sincere apologies."" Dan stood again. ""My colleague is working through some anger issues. Apparently his ex left him because he was allergic to her cat. Or something along those lines.""

The couple glanced at each other. ""But... he's a skeleton,"" said Marcie.

Dan ignored this. ""Management is going to make sure you don't remember any of this come morning. Not so much as a bad dream. And we may even consider tacking on an extra six months to Abe's life as compensation. It's probably not nearly enough, but...""

""It's plenty,"" said Gerald. Dan put out his hand, and Gerald shook it.

""You guys have a good night,"" said Dan as he walked out the door. In a moment, there was a flash of light, and both Grim Reapers were gone.

Marcie sat down on the bed, and Gerald followed. ""That was...""

""Yeah.""

""Do you think we should... um...""

""Let's just go back to sleep,"" Gerald suggested.

""Sleep. Yes.""

They both tucked themselves under the covers. Abraham hopped onto the bed and snuggled up to Marcie.

""Woof.""

""Good boy."" Marcie stroked Abe's fur once, then shut her eyes. ""Good boy.""

The only way to graduate is to break into the headmasters office, steal a certain object and escape from the school. Tonight you're going to attempt it.  
  
***
***
""Feast your eyes, boys!"" Martin held up the trophy for everyone in the room to see. ""We've officially done it. We're graduates!""

All eleven students whooped and hollered, filling the rec room with noise. In lieu of a proper toast, Martin raised a slice of pizza as he set the statuette on the pool table. The others raised their pizzas as well.

""To the only team this year that pulled off the perfect heist."" Martin bowed his head in mock reverence. ""And to all our fallen brethren, caught red-handed in Headmaster Williams' office, forced to leave in disgrace as nothing more than second-rate thieves.""

Just then, Headmaster Williams poked his head through the rec room door. ""What is all this?""

""Pizza party,"" Perry replied.

""Whatever for?""

""Ain't it obvious, boss?"" Hector asked, his mouth half full of pepperoni. ""We beat you! We got the trophy right here!""

""You will address me as Headmaster, Master Yates."" He turned to Martin. ""Master Danielson, is this true?""

""See for yourself."" Martin stepped aside, exposing the trophy to the headmaster's view. It was a stout, twelve inch depiction of Saint Nicholas, carved entirely of marble save for the base, which was oak with a golden inlay.

""I don't know what you think you're doing,"" the headmaster began, ""by offering up this obvious forgery...""

""It's not a forgery,"" said Martin.

""...But the real trophy is in the same place it has been since the first day of the fall term. I checked on it not two hours ago.""

""I'm sure you did. But you were fooled."" Martin set his pizza down on a plate and picked up the trophy. The headmaster noted, with some disdain, that pizza sauce was smudged over the side of Saint Nicholas' cloak. ""This is the real deal. The forgery is in your office.""

""Is that so?"" the headmaster mused. ""And I suppose you'll tell me you got past the wall safe with no trouble-""

""Oh, we didn't even glance at the wall safe. This is from the safe under your desk.""

The headmaster paused, the smug smile slowly sliding off his face. ""Master Danielson, you are the leader of this team?""

""Yes, sir.""

""You will accompany me to my office at once. Bring the trophy. If I find it to be a forgery, you and your team will be expelled.""

""Yes, sir.""

""The rest of you are to wait here in the dormitory,"" the headmaster ordered. ""No breaking curfew."" The boys nodded.

It took five minutes for Martin and the headmaster to leave the dorm, walking out to the headmaster's car under a starry mid-April sky. It took only one minute for Julian to arrive at the door of the Men's Dean with a box of Chicago-Style Deep Dish pizza.

""Me and the guys are breaking curfew now. Here's that pizza we promised.""
***
""Car won't start?""

""It will not, Master Danielson.""

The other ten students departed from the dorm a full minute before Martin and the headmaster. Marcus Hunt lay flat on his back underneath Headmaster William's car, his breath kept to an absolute minimum. 

""We could take my car.""

""I think not, Master Danielson. Walking would be faster. This is obviously a ruse by another graduating team, and I would very much like to catch at least one group in the act this evening.""

""Magpie to Ground Control. Gold Leader and Hawk Master are on approach,"" Marcus radioed in once the two were out of earshot. ""ETA ten minutes.""

""So tell me, who created the forgery?""

""That was Hector.""

""If that truly is the real trophy in your hand, then he did a remarkable job.""

""But you don't think it is?""

""Perhaps I would be better able to tell if it weren't covered in pizza grease.""

""Whoops. Didn't even realize. Let me just wipe it off-""

""Don't bother. Keep that filthy thing away until I can inspect it closer.""

They reached the Administration Building. Martin waited patiently as the headmaster passed his keycard over the scanner. Then they entered. From above, Perry carefully lowered a rope over the edge of the roof, with a brick tied to one end. It wasn't a high-end solution, but it kept the door wedged open long enough for Team Alpha to enter.

""Tell me what references you used for Master Yates to forge it.""

""That was Eric's idea. In fall, we sat in on the Freshmen Orientation Address. When you presented the trophy in the auditorium, we took pictures and stitched them together with a app Eric and Devin created.""

Devin, running comms from his post outside, signaled for Team Bravo to begin the next phase of the plan. From the roof, Perry helped Manuel lower Ken down to the Headmaster's window.

""And Master Yates was able to create a forgery with that level of detail? You can see why I might doubt his work.""

""Smartphones can do amazing things these days, Headmaster Williams.""

""Hmm. And the safe? How did you know that the one on the wall was a decoy?""

""You called Kirk Douglas into your office once, in October, and he noticed that you looked at the picture frames on your wall a little too often.""

""Of course. A little trick to misguide certain students. How did he see through it?""

""Well, you slipped up. You focused on two different frames. When Kirk told me about his meeting, I knew something was up.""

Julian and Kirk, together as Team Alpha, raced to the basement of the Administrative Building to reach the fuse box. Kirk picked the lock while Julian kept watch for the night guards. Meanwhile, Hector pulled his car up to the back of the building with Erik and Russell.

""So Perry set up a camera in your office-""

""And how did he do that?""

""We, uh, bribed a night guard."" This was a lie.

""Bad form, Master Danielson, bad form! A bribed guard is a witness. You should know better.""

""It got the job done.""

""Your team will receive demerits. The previous Headmaster would have had you expelled for that alone.""

Just then, the building's power shut off. Headmaster Williams removed a small flashlight from his keychain and turned it off, quickening his step.

""Just as I suspected. Another team is in the building. Come quickly, Master Danielson.""

""Yes, sir.""

""The backup generator gave you no trouble?""

""We didn't touch it. It's not connected to the safe beneath your desk.""

""Correct. Your story grows more plausible by the second. I am impressed, Mr. Danielson.""

Following Devin's cues, Erik and Russell cut the power to the backup generator just as Ken cut a hole in the window and lifted it open. He dropped silently to the floor, pulling a small bag with him. The walls were littered in picture frames holding the headmaster's various degrees, accolades and stolen paintings, but Ken chose the largest frame to take down from the wall.

""I will be most interested in reading your full final report. No one has successfully completed the final assignment in over fifteen years. Here we are.""

They entered to find the frame lying at an angle against the wall. With the exception of the open window, this was the only discrepancy within the room. 

""Maybe we scared them?""

""Perhaps. I will open the safe. Set that statue on my desk, if you please.""

Martin did so. He watched as the headmaster pulled out the false paneling underneath his desk and twisted the two different combination wheels to their desired settings.

""I assume you finished the assignment in December, then? I was intrigued to see that the backup generator hadn't been touched during that particular power outage.""

""Yes, sir. Julian and Marcus cut the power, leaving Manuel, Russell and Ken to crack the safe."" 

In reality, this had been when Martin's team placed the cameras in the Headmaster's office. A stipulation of the exam had been that other teams would have the opportunity to steal the statue from them if word got out about the theft before the deadline. The true statue was just being placed on his desk as Martin spoke.

""Well, I suppose that this inspection may be just a formality. But it is the protocol. I mean no disrespect to Master Yates' work.""

The headmaster was about to retrieve his authentication tools from his desk drawer when someone knocked on the door. Headmaster Williams beckoned Martin forward as he walked to open it.

A night guard was at the door. The headmaster, wary of being double-crossed, had Martin step out first, then shut the door behind them.

""Is this important, Terrance?""

""Yes, sir. We believe someone is joyriding around campus in your car.""

""What? Joyriding!""

""Yes, sir. Campus security is in pursuit. We tried to call you, but you wouldn't answer your phone.""

Within the headmaster's office, Ken climbed down from within the wall safe, closed it, and set to work. First, he removed the false statuette (the one covered in pizza grease, which held a small signal jammer that kept the headmaster from receiving calls. He then set the real statue in its place. Thirdly, he removed a second, clean false statue and put it where the real statue had been. Finally, Ken removed a small slice of pizza from the bag and carefully, deliberately smeared it over the real statue. The end result was that the real statue, fresh from the safe, looked almost exactly like the first forgery.

By the time Martin and Headmaster Williams reentered, Ken was gone.

""What nonsense,"" the headmaster grumbled. ""They wouldn't have stolen my car if they had known you had already passed. Martin said nothing, silently praying that Marcus wouldn't be caught before he ditched the vehicle.

It took ten minutes for the Headmaster to remove the pizza grease from the true statuette complete his inspection of both statues. When he was finished, he shook his head mournfully.

""My eyes are deceiving me in my old age. I had months to recognize this as a forgery.""

""Hector's good at what he does.""

""Indeed."" Headmaster Williams handed Martin both trophies. ""The prize is yours, and the deadline is in eleven minutes. I expect you and your team in graduation regalia bright and early tomorrow morning.""

The first thing Norman did when he returned to his house was retrieve his phone from the kitchen counter. A few hours after his conversation with Leslie, another coworker (who also had a Windows phone) had come to his cubicle to notify Norman about a function on his phone called ""Quiet Hours."" Norman had heard about this function when he had bought the phone, but it had never seemed prudent that he set it up.

""Yeah, it's great,"" Larry had said, holding his phone out for Norman to view its screen. ""It automatically turns itself on at night, and I have it set up so that the only people that can call are from work."" Norman had nodded and graciously thanked Larry for this information. Larry then offered to set up Norman's phone, but because it had been at home, Norman had been forced to decline.

It took Norman about ten minutes to rediscover the correct settings page and turn on the options he wanted. He added everyone in his work contacts to his ""Inner Circle,"" as well as his son Norman. Then he ate dinner, fed Norman (the cat), and watched CSI until bedtime.

At exactly 2:34 AM, Norman awoke to the sound of his phone buzzing on his bedside table. He sat up and picked up his phone.

&gt;marcie your a jerkface and i hppe you nvr find lov

Tired as he was, it took Norman some time to realize that the text was not meant for him. Presumably, Robert had gotten drunk and sent the same message to everyone in his address book. More texts streamed in, both from Robert and from irate coworkers who didn't know how to send texts to him individually.

Somewhat frustrated, Norman powered down his phone entirely, then rolled over and tried to return to sleep.

Norman stood in the hallway, briefcase in hand, with the distinct impression that he had forgotten something important. He racked his brain for a moment, trying to remember. Nothing came to him.

Lisa raced up behind him, spinning around with an unusually high amount of energy. ""Come on, Norman! Aren't you ready to go in?""

Norman looked around anxiously. ""Go in?"" 

Lisa leaned forward. Before Norman knew what was going on, she had both her arms around Norman's shoulders, one foot off the floor, leaning on him with a degree of comfort she'd never displayed before.

""Today's the big day,"" she whispered in his ear. ""You are ready, aren't you?""

Norman pulled back. ""Ready for what?""

""You goof. Come on, it's starting."" Lisa grabbed Norman by the arm and dragged him in through the double doors.

Inside, there were dozens of young adults taking their seats. Lisa led him up the stairs of the auditorium, finding two empty seats in the very last row. Norman sat down, still uncertain as to what was going on. He looked down on the rest of the room until his eyes finally caught on the large chalkboard installed on the front wall.

""FINAL EXAM TODAY"" it said, in capital letters etched a yard tall in white chalk.

Norman began to sweat. How had he forgotten something so devastatingly important? He looked down at his desk and realized that his exam was already there. He rifled through it. Calculus symbols swam before his eyes.

""Didn't you study, Norman?"" He became aware that Lisa was leaning over in her seat, inspecting his paper more than her own. Norman shook his head. Surreptitiously, Lisa slid her paper as far to the edge of her desk as she dared. 

""I'll let you copy off me,"" she whispered. ""Just this once.""

""What? No."" Norman pushed her test back. ""That's not right, Lisa. Cheating is terrible.""

""Suit yourself!"" Norman watched in shock and awe as Lisa climbed up to stand on top of her desk. ""Hey, everyone! Guess who didn't study!""

The entire class turned to face Lisa, then Norman, as she pointed. Before long, everyone was laughing. Norman blushed in acute embarrassment as the professor stood in the front of the room.

""Norman! Come down here!""

Norman stood, and shouldered his way between the desks as the students continued to laugh. In his haste, the strap of his briefcase caught on a chair and ripped itself off, forcing him to carry it with both hands. He got to the aisle and made his way down to the front of the room.

""Norman, I am giving you an F in this class. Leave now, and don't come *back to Vivaldi and Beethoven in our Classics in Concert series, tonight at 8...*
***
Norman awoke to the soft spoken voice of the classical radio station to which he'd set his alarm. He sat up in bed and wiped his face. *It was only a dream,* he thought to himself.

By the time Norman had finished his breakfast, he could barely remember what the dream had been about. Still, he kept a wary eye on Lisa in the line for morning coffee in the office.

""Excuse me, Pastor Phelps. May I have a word?""

The pastor looked up to see a tall, thin man, with sandy brown hair and beard, wearing a white t-shirt and carpenter jeans. He frowned.

""If you're here for today's service, I'll tell you now that you're not properly dressed.""

""I'm not here for the service.""

""Well, I'd ask you to stay if you were dressed better. Today is the Sabbath-""

""Actually the Sabbath was yesterday. On Saturday.""

Pastor Phelps cocked his head to one side. ""Seventh-Day Baptist, or Adventist?""

""Jewish. That's beside the point-""

""Get to the point then.""

The man held up a hand, as if to say, *Calm down, I'm not here to fight you.* Pastor Phelps heard the words clearly, yet distant, though the man's mouth didn't move. He shook his head. He must not have gotten enough sleep last night.

Now the man spoke. ""I came to deliver you a personal message. I've been making the rounds through a couple of churches, actually-""

""A couple?""

""-Spreading God's Word, yes.""

Phelps shook his head in amused disbelief. ""Son, I think the Jews have out of touch with God's Word since Jesus died on the cross. The only true Jews are Christians, I always say.""

""I... can see how you might think that."" The man rubbed his palm nervously. ""But I'm not speaking on my own. I'm only telling you what I've heard from God Himself, and I want to tell you what is yet to come.""

""Hmph."" Phelps crossed his arms. 

""This message is very important."" 

""Oh for God's sake, spit it out then!"" Phelps grumbled. Intent on ignoring the man's ""important message,"" he turned to the computer on his desk and began typing. He felt suddenly inspired to devote next week's sermon to the topic of Jewish sin.

The man stood patiently where he was until Phelps turned back to him in irritation.

""Are you going to speak or not?""

""Pastor Phelps,"" the man said, ""if Jesus himself came to speak to you, would you ignore him?""

Phelps scoffed. ""You are not Jesus.""

""Then He will answer them, ‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.’ Matthew 25:45.""

Something in the room changed when the man said this. It felt warmer, or colder, or perhaps both. A chill went down Phelps' spine as he glanced at his computer monitor out of the corner of his eye. How odd. He meant to preach on The Parable of the Sheep and the Goats today.

""Fred Phelps,"" the man continued, almost in a whisper, ""I would really like to have your full attention.""

Phelps folded his hands on the desk in front of him. ""...You have it.""

""Good.""

""What is your message?""

The man paused. The pastor sensed that he was trying to figure out how best to phrase this next piece of the conversation. Then the man raised his finger in the air. He had it.

""Stop it.""

Phelps blinked. ""Is that it?""

""No, but it's a start."" The man moved for the first time since his arrival, and sat in the chair opposite from the pastor. ""You preach a lot of sermons on a lot of topics. You picket funerals, abortion clinics, and LGBT rights activists. God wants you to stop all of that, starting right now.""

""God wants me to stop doing his work?"" Phelps' voice was a nervous squeak. ""I don't understand.""

""That's the problem. What you need to understand is that you haven't been doing God's work for quite some time. Almost your entire life, I'm afraid.""

""I...""

""In John 8, the scribes and Pharisees brought Jesus a woman who had been caught in adultery. You know the passage, don't you?""

Phelps jumped at the opportunity. ""She sinned just as gay people do! Sexual impurit-""

""No, no, that's not what I meant. The gays don't sin any more than the rest of the world's people."" Jesus pointed at Phelps. ""And I think that you're already well aware of the biblical arguments against your position on homosexuals.""

""What about her, then?""

""Look at how Jesus handled the situation. It was from a place of love and acceptance, not judgement and hell-fire. He said to them, 'He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.'"" The man chuckled. ""As one man put it, 'They who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.'""

""No one stoned her.""

""Exactly. And when they were gone, Jesus said to the woman, 'I do not condemn you, either. Go. From now on sin no more.' God reaches people by loving them. When you show love to others, you show them The Father. That is a much better sermon then the one you planned to preach today.""

Phelps nodded. ""Is there anything else?""

""You should know this won't go over well with your congregation."" The man grew somber. ""You've preached hate for quite some time, and it's very deeply ingrained.""

""What?""

""I want to let you know now. It's your decision to listen to or ignore God's Word, just as it has been for every man and woman. If you make the right choice, you'll have God's support... but not much else.""

""Why don't you speak to them?""

""I have! Perhaps not directly, as I have with you, but I've made contact.""

""You should speak with them directly. I'd gladly give you time during the service-"" But the man was shaking his head.

""God doesn't force Himself on anyone. That's not love. And believe me when I say I tried to reach them when they were most open.""

""...Most open?""

""Yes, Fred. For you, that time is now."" The man smiled. ""I think you'll make the right choice.""

Pastor Phelps said nothing. The man stood and dusted off his pant legs.

""Well, I need to be going. I have a lot more people to reach tonight.""

""Tonight? But it's
***
Pastor Phelps woke up.

His alarm clock was blaring Christian Contemporary music. He clearly remembered setting the alarm to its generic morning whine, but perhaps it had malfunctioned. He rolled over and listened as the song ended.

""Good morning, Topeka! You're listening to K-Love on 88.9 FM, and it is a beautiful September 1st morning, blue skies - Hey, we wanna give a shoutout to-""

""Dear,"" said Margie, ""turn off the alarm, please.""

""Yes, Margie."" Fred shut off the alarm and shuffled out of bed. ""I'm going to go down to my study before I get dressed. I want to make some changes to my sermon.""

""Suit yourself!"" Norman watched in shock and awe as Lisa climbed up to stand on top of her desk. ""Hey, everyone! Guess who didn't study!""

The entire class turned to face Lisa, then Norman, as she pointed. Before long, everyone was laughing. Norman blushed in acute embarrassment as the professor stood in the front of the room.

""Norman! Come down here!""

Norman stood, and shouldered his way between the desks as the students continued to laugh. In his haste, the strap of his briefcase caught on a chair and ripped itself off, forcing him to carry it with both hands. He got to the aisle and made his way down to the front of the room.

""Norman, I am giving you an F in this class. Leave now, and don't come *back to Vivaldi and Beethoven in our Classics in Concert series, tonight at 8...*
***
Norman awoke to the soft spoken voice of the classical radio station to which he'd set his alarm. He sat up in bed and wiped his face. *It was only a dream,* he thought to himself.

By the time Norman had finished his breakfast, he could barely remember what the dream had been about. Still, he kept a wary eye on Lisa in the line for morning coffee in the office.",lifeofnorman,Norman Gets Testy,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/4defpd/norman_gets_testy/

The roar of the helicopter's propellers might have deafened the ears of a normal human. Not so with the cyborg. She stood in its spotlight, waiting, watching silently.

""This is the New Michigan Police! We have the building surrounded!"" The chopper's PA system crackled with static. ""Get down on the ground and put your hands behind your head!""

She analyzed the threat. Scanning police frequencies made it clear that there were about twenty ground troops and SWAT teams working their way up the office high rise. She could also clearly hear a second military helicopter closing in from about ten miles away. Being on the 78th floor, exiting through the window was not a viable option, at least not yet. She chose to stand down.

The floor was covered in the blood of the two security guards. She raised her arms, palms forward, and slowly stepped over the leg of the one closest to her. Then she maneuvered to a clean spot in the floor, and relaxed her arms. The spotlight wavered, then shone straight on her face as the helicopter changed its position to get a better view of the office.

""You have five seconds to get down and place your hands on your head. If you don't comply, we will open fire.""

She ran another analysis. The window was already shattered, both from her initial entrance and the guards' haphazard gunfire. It might be possible, from here, to make a dash for the chopper and anchor herself to its landing gear. She gave this option serious consideration. It would be best if she could avoid being brought in by law enforcement. She would be imprisoned. Worse yet, everything about her, from her fingerprints to her serial numbers, would be catalogued and sent to a database. Pandora Research Industries no doubt knew that one of their facilities had been ransacked. If she were arrested, they would know *her*, in hours, maybe minutes.

But her energy reserves were low. Her arm would be manageable, at least, and she could divert the extra power to her leg if she went that route. Even so, it would only buy her another two hours. Not enough to go on the run.

She knelt, then lay prostrate on the floor. Her cheek touched metal, and the human side of her body shivered involuntarily. She brought up her arms and placed them on the back of her neck. There she stayed, cold and uncomfortable, her cybernetic limbs switched off and acting as personal paperweights. It would take another ten minutes for the SWAT team to breach the room. She kept herself busy by preparing an encrypted file transfer.

She hadn't gotten much information. Everything on the local Pandora server was heavily firewalled, to say nothing of the connection to the offsite regional servers. But now she knew where those severs were. If she were to-

She picked up a new signal. It wasn't one of the police bands, and it definitely wasn't within the normal range of radio communication. She listened, honing in on the frequency as best she could without throwing feedback.

&gt;.--. -. ..-. ..-. ...- .-. .-.-.- / ..-. -... ..-. .-.-.-

**""Cassie. SOS.""** It was ciphered Morse code, simple enough to decrypt but transmitted at speeds impossible for humans to understand. The calling card of the Bionic Freedom League. And they were *close*. How did they know her name?

She sent a message back along the same channel. **""Hello?""**

**""Helicopter approaching from northern vector is friendly. Will you accept emergency extraction?""**

**""Why should I trust you?""**

There was no answer. She hadn't expected one.

She reactivated her cybernetics. With both limbs running at normal power, she only had 54 minutes of energy remaining. Hopefully the BFL had a charging interface she could use.

Another message, the same as before. **""Helicopter approaching from northern vector is friendly. Will you accept emergency extraction?""**

**""Yes.""**

**""Extraction is ready on 51st floor.""**

She made a break for the elevator shaft. The response from the police chopper was slow in coming compared to her speed, and she had broken down the doors before the officers outside could begin shooting. With the gunfire behind her, she reached out for the elevator cables. 

There were none. Two stories into her fall, she remembered that the facility had undergone several updates that weren't reflected in the blueprints she had in her databanks. By the third story, she recognized this included the brand-new, PandoraTech-designed maglev lift elevator toward which she was plummeting at nearly half her terminal velocity. It took another nine stories to hack into building security for the second time that night and send the elevator rocketing upwards to meet her. She crashed through its ceiling like a fist through wet paper, stopping a full seven stories below the extraction point.

""AAAAHHHH!"" she roared. The impact had demolished the elevator, and metal and glass were raining down on her face, opening skin and adding her blood to that of the guards. She'd also put a serious dent in the left side of her body, and her nose was broken. Fortunately, her leg was still operational, but her arm wasn't responding. The experience was wreaking havoc on her neural interface. Her brainstem went hot from sensory overload.

Through the pain, she reactivated the elevator and bypassed all the ""Catastrophic Failure"" warnings to send it back up to the 51st floor. Then she stood up and assessed the damage. Two of her fingers had been sheared off, which wouldn't be easy to fix, but hopefully easier with the BFL's resources. She plucked them from the floor and stuffed them in her pocket, then deactivated her arm.

The helicopter was waiting for her when she arrived. The floor had a large outdoor balcony, and the BFL chopper was hovering alongside it, cockpit open. She climbed over the balcony railing and collapsed over a chair. The door closed behind her, and the chopper turned away from the facility.

""I think we've proven,"" said a voice from the chair next to her, ""that you can trust us.""

""Can it, Barry, I'm not in the mood."" She struggled upright and collapsed back in the seat, this time facing forward.

""Let me see your cybers.""

""Go to hell.""

""Good night, what did you do to your arm?"" Barry grabbed it with both hands and unhooked the joints connecting it to Cassie's shoulder. ""Lamar, look at this! Her fingers came clean off!""

""No talking to the driver,"" Lamar growled.

""It was a stupid accident."" Cassie grabbed her arm and reholstered it. ""I had bad blueprints. If they had a fuckin' normal elevator-""

""Why do you do this kind of thing, Cassie? You're gonna kill yourself this way. Join the BFL and get some help. We want all the same information you've been breaking cybers over to get on your own.""

Cassie said nothing.

""Take the arm off, come on. We'll get you a new one.""

""I don't want a new arm. I'll fix this one.""

""Why?"" His voice was pleading. ""Why don't you want our help?""

""You got to choose your cybers. I didn't. I don't want to be a part of your movement. I'm not here for 'a better future for bionically-enhanced individuals.'"" Cassie shifted in her chair and stared out the window. ""I want revenge. Something tells me the BFL won't be happy with that.""

""It simply isn't tenable-""

""Aw, cram it, ya old broad."" Gerta turned her broomstick upside down. Using it as a walking stick, she paced up and down the walkway of the small wooden house, which both witches were eager to enter. 

""Yer lettin' good meat go ta waste. There's your ""not tenable"" nonsense, I tell ya. S'a wonder anyone in the land is scared of ya.""

Drealis stood still. Her only movements were to speak and to track Gerta's worrying path along the dusty walk. 

""I refuse to have a broom-measuring contest with you, Gerta.""

""Ha! Scaredy-cat.""

""Gerta, see reason. A baby is no good to anyone if it is killed and eaten.""

""A baby's nothing but *meat*-""

""A *baby*,"" said Drealis, raising her voice only slightly, ""will grow up to be a child, which will grow to be an adult. And as it grows, it becomes *useful*. If you were to save even one child for yourself, you would know how practical they were for enchantments. Their blood alone-""

""Bah!"" Gerta stopped to sniff loudly and scratch a wart on her nose. Drealis wrinkled her own perfect nose in disgust. ""Ya want blood, y'can have it, but I want meat! And the baby was promised to me.""

""It was promised to both of us,"" Drealis growled, ""and I'll be hanged if I forgive those blasted parents for this mess. But I digress. For my purposes, the baby must be kept alive.""

""Well fat lot a' good that'll do for me! I ain't had a fresh baby in months!""

Drealis scoffed. ""Speaking of *fat*...""

""Eh? Say that again!""

""Heaven knows how much fat you've put on in the last century, and if you keep it up, who knows if you'll live another? You would do well to lay off baby meat for a while."" Drealis calmly inspected her fingernails, smirking to herself and watching from the corner of her eye as Gerta went red in the face. ""If you'd like to pick through my garden sometime, you're more than welcome, you know. And goat meat is especially lovely this time of year.""

Gerta flipped her broomstick again and pointed the handle inches from Drealis' face. Drealis instantly drew back from the muddy knob of wood.

""I'll have you know,"" Gerta yelled, ""eating baby has life giving properties you ain't gonna get from all your enchanted cabbage!""

""Oh, I'm sure.""

""Well, see if you get your fancy baby's blood now! That meat is *mine!*""

""It is not *yours* in any sense of the word. The mother promised it to you, and the father promised it to me. And I would be more than willing to share it with you, only your intent is to waste it making yourself *fat!*""

Gerta slapped Drealis squarely across the cheek, and Drealis reacted, summoning her wand and aiming it directly at the wart on Gerta's nose. Gerta's broom was already out, but the light and sparks emanating from Drealis' wand told her she had already lost the draw. She raised her arms in surrender.

""I give! I give!""

Drealis said nothing.

""I ain't fat.""

""And I am not wasteful.""

""You take it back.""

""First surrender the child to me.""

""Never.""

""Do it or I'll turn you to a toad for a year.""

Gerta whimpered. ""Fine. Y'can have the baby.""

Drealis disengaged her wand, stowed it away, and petted Gerta on the head. ""You aren't fat, my dear. Just ugly.""

""You-""

Drealis snapped her fingers, and a spell transformed the ground beneath Gerta's feet to quicksand. Gerta sank waist deep into the ground as Drealis walked up the stairs and knocked on the door.

""Marus! I have come for your firstborn!"" There was no answer from inside the house. ""Marus! Marcie!""

""Get me out of this mud!"" Gerta yelled.

""Hush."" Drealis reached for the doorknob. Surprisingly, it was unlocked. She entered the house cautiously, and shut the door behind her.

""I hope,"" she called out, ""you won't try anything silly to try to protect your child. I have had my patience tested enough for one day."" 

Still no answer. Drealis passed from room to room, growing first confused, then irritated as she found no sign of her prize. The house was entirely empty. It didn't take long for her to figure out why.

She stormed out of the house. Gerta had managed to lift herself out of the quicksand pit with her broom, and was scrambling toward dry ground when she heard Drealis slam the door.

""You're gonna pay for that mud spell!""

""Shut up, you fat hag."" Drealis scanned the woods around the house. ""They're not inside.""

""Whad'ya mean, not inside?""

""They're gone. They must have snuck out through the back while we were quarreling.""

""Hah! Good for you. Waste of perfectly good meat.""

""They can't have gotten far. You go west and search along the banks of the creek. I'll head east.""

""Who says I'm helping you?""

""I say,"" Drealis hissed. ""No one can know that those two escaped without giving up their child. We'll be the laughingstocks of the Witches' Guild.""

""Don't care.""

Drealis curled her fists. ""Then what *do* you care about? This is important!""

""Y'called me fat and ugly.""

""Fine! You are neither fat nor ugly! Now-""

""If you want my help, *I* get the baby. That or no deal.""

Drealis roared in anger. Materializing her wand, she picked out a large oak tree standing near the house and fired a bolt of lightning at its trunk. It shattered into a million pieces and exploded outwards. Woodchips rained from the sky, shattering the house's windows and shredding the leaves off the other trees. Gerta didn't flinch. Drealis turned to her, her eyes solid red and glowing in anger.

""*Have the child if you want it! I no longer care!*"" Her breath was ragged and hot. ""*I want the PARENTS! They'll rue the day they crossed me!*""

Gerta cackled. ""Anger ain't good fer your skin, old broad! You'll get warts!"" She scratched her own warts with one hand as she straddled her broom and lifted into the air. ""Heere, baby! Come to mama!""

Gerta pointed her broom westward and darted into the forest. Drealis turned east. Every few steps, she would point her want and blast another tree into oblivion, traveling in a straight line as she burned off her rage.
***
The baby had started crying once the tree exploded. Fortunately, the walls of the secret room were thick, and the noise outside meant the two witches would never have heard anyway.

Marcie bounced her baby girl on her lap. ""How much longer, Marus?""

""I'm not sure."" He was at the trapdoor above them, lifting it and peeking into the dining room from under the carpet. ""Gerta will become disinterested in a matter of days, but Drealis became more upset than I feared. She blasted a tree, it would seem.""

""Mmm.""

""A week, perhaps."" Marus shut the door and climbed down the ladder. ""Then we'll slip out of town and head north.""

""A week. Good."" Marcie sighed happily. ""This was a good plan.""

The baby squalled, then grew quiet. Marcie lifted her and hugged her close.

""You're not going to be like the others, Marybeth. No witch is ever going to hurt you.""

""My dear *Fräulein,* please stand and greet your master.""

I'm lying on the floor in a geek's heaven. It's small, but it's dark and cramped with junk, and there are no windows. Typical. A nerd living in his parent's basement. It's not the best way to wake up; definitely not the best way to begin my existence.

I don't stand.

""Uh, Hitler?""

""I have asked you to call me Adolf, *Herr Friedrich.*""

""Yeah, and I asked you to call me Freddy. What's wrong with her?""

""I'm not at all sure."" I can see the djinn scratching his head in confusion. He does actually look like Adolf Hitler, which makes no sense to me. I wonder if I was made wrong.

""I thought you said you'd done this before.""

""I said nothing of the sort."" Hitler bends down and touches me on the cheek with a gloved hand. ""*Fräulein?*""

""Don't touch me."" My own voice is higher than I expected. I pull away from him, and he stands.

""She will be fine, *Herr Friedrich.*""

""Freddy.""

I finally stand up. Freddy is a nasally-voiced, taped-glasses nerd wearing jeans and a Titanfall t-shirt. His curly hair shakes around when he talks. He doesn't look all that bad, but in the moment, I decide that I hate him.

""You know, I think I prefer redheads,"" he says.

""You asked for the most beautiful woman in the world. She is a spectacle, if I do say so myself. Blonde hair, blue eyes, high cheekbones-""

""Well of course *you* would think that, but it's totally subjective-""

""Why does your djinn look like Hitler?"" I interrupt. They stare at me for a moment. Then Hitler speaks up.

""Introductions are in order."" He puts out his hand to shake and I don't. ""I am indeed Adolf Hitler. When I died, the universe saw fit to make me a djinn, one of many, and my only purpose is to serve my master.""

""And you're okay with this?"" I ask Freddy.

""Uh... no. But there's not much I can do about it.""

""You wished me into existence.""

""He did!"" Hitler says. ""Oh, you must see yourself in the mirror. You are literally the most beautiful woman on earth; it is impossible for anyone to say otherwise. Where is your mirror, *Herr Friedrich?*""

Freddy sighs. ""It's in the bathroom. Second door on the left.""

""Come with me!"" Hitler waves me forward. I hold back and walk with Freddy, trying to stay as far from the magical dictator as possible. ""Please, take your time. You are my first created being, you know. I'll be out here.""

I drag Freddy into the bathroom with me before he can resist, and shut the door. Freddy waits.

""Aren't you going to look?""

I turn around and stare into the mirror for five seconds. Then I turn back. ""There, I looked. Now wish me back out of existence.""

""You don't like the way you look? I could get him to change it-""

""No, Freddy! For Pete's sake, no. It's not about how I look, it's about him!""

""He is kind of full of himself, isn't he?""

""He was the world's most genocidal dictator.""

""I tried to get him to change that."" Freddy puts up his hands in protest. ""But he told me it was impossible. Temporal paradoxes and all that.""

""But why did you wish for me?""

""I don't know, that's just what people *do* when they get genies!""

""I mean, can you imagine what people would think? The most beautiful girl in the world, created by *Hitler*. I'd never live it down.""

Freddy puts both his hands on my shoulders. ""I completely understand,"" he says. ""I'm going to fix this.""
***
""*Herr Friedrich,* what is this contraption under your television?"" It's an Xbox. ""Technology seems to have come quite a long way since my death.""

""Hitler-""

""Adolf.""

""-We need to talk,"" Freddy starts.

He stands. ""Do you have another wish? Speak and it will be granted.""

""No, it's... I want to revoke my previous wish.""

""What? Heavens, why would you want that?""

""Because you're Hitler,"" I tell him.

He squints at me. ""You of all people - Why is everyone so opposed to my politics that they would deny infinite rule over the fabric of reality? It boggles the mind!""

""Can you do it or not?"" Freddy asked.

""Of course I can't. I thought I explained to you the concept of a paradox.""

""Well, I wish she would stop existing now. There's no paradox there. She'll just be gone.""

""You're throwing away *human life!*""

""It was my decision,"" I say.

""So ungrateful."" Hitler shook his head. ""You'll change your mind someday.""

""No, I won't. In fact, I won't be making any other wishes with you,"" Freddy says.

""Bah! See reason, *Fräulein*! Ask him to change his mind!""

I shook my head. Hitler folded his arms and turned away.

""Say your goodbyes before I remove the woman from reality. It is the least you can do, you ungrateful Jew of a man.""

Freddy hugged me. ""I'm sorry about all this-""

""Freddy, I'm home!"" A voice called out from upstairs.

Freddy froze. ""My mom.""

""What?""

""Hitler, hide!"" Freddy hisses. At once, the djinn evaporates into smoke, which curls up and disappears into the barrel of an antique gun lying on the couch.

""Wait, no! I need him to-"" I lunge for the gun, but Freddy grabs me.

""I can't have Hitler in the basement with my mom home. A girl is much easier to explain."" Footsteps creak toward the upstairs door.

""But-""

""We'll deal with this later, I promise. I am so sorry about this.""

""It's not your fault. It was his,"" I sigh. He nods and stuffs the gun under his couch cushions as the door to the basement opens. ""He is literally the worst.""

Jack, while standing by the side of the Times Square Pavilion, had stolen seventeen wallets in the four hours since his arrival. This was an unusually high number, but today he was feeling cocky. No one saw, and no one suspected. Why should they?

“Step forward, folks – get as close as you want, every single one of you needs to keep your eyes on me, you understand? Because if you don’t– “The magician clapped his hands, and the stack of quarters he had been holding seemed to disappear between them. “Poof! Gone before you know it, am I right, ladies and gentlemen?”

The crowd oohed and aahed and clapped appropriately. Jack eased his hands open to reveal a crisp five-dollar bill. Then he whisked off his top hat and placed the bill inside.

“Don’t forget to tip your magician, everyone.” Setting his hat on the ground, Jack pulled a pack of cards from the breast pocket of his suit, and handed them out to the crowd. Each one was stylized with the faces of different playing cards. “Magical Jack, at your service. I’m gonna be performing 8:30 tonight at Lacie J’s – address is on the card, right there – If you show up with one of these special cards, your first drink is free! I want you all to come out, have a great time, okay! Now, I’m gonna need a volunteer from the audience.”

A few walked away, content to have the card as a souvenir. But The Square was crowded, and more tourists replaced those who left. Together, the captive audience formed a semicircle around the pavilion.

As Jack picked up his hat, his eyes caught a woman standing near the back of the crowd. She’d been hanging around Jack’s turf for maybe half an hour; he might not have noticed her if not for her stare. It was intense, and intent upon something Jack didn’t know how to define. Maybe she was interested in him; it was hard to tell. He decided to take his chances.

“You in the back, the redhead!” 

She shook herself out of a trance and pointed at her chest. “Me?”

“Yes, you! Come on down!”

The crowd parted and made room for her, some grumbling under their breath that they hadn’t been chosen. Looking her up and down, Jack was only slightly more confident that the woman would be open to a few drinks. Her eyes were flirtatious, but she held herself regally (or as regally as one could wearing skinny jeans and a crop top), as if to say, *You exist for my entertainment, and nothing more.*

He’d really have to lay on the charm. “What’s your name?”

“Morgan.”

“You come here often, Morgan?”

“No, not really.” Her words drawled out from boredom. “Just taking in the sights.”

“See, that’s great – You’re a real patron of the arts, Morgan, I gotta respect that – You like magic, Morgan?”

“You could say that.” She smiled.

“Of course you do.” Jack gestured to himself. “You like what you’ve seen so far?”

Morgan rolled her eyes. “God no, you’re a hack.”

The crowd reacted, laughing as though she had sucker-punched Jack in the stomach. They all believed Morgan was either part of the show, or a particularly mouthy audience member. Jack decided she was playing hard to get. Her posture was relaxing, and her eyes glinted in the sunlight. *Challenge me,* they said.

Jack put a hand to his heart. “Hurtful!” 

The crowd laughed again.

“You’ve been watching me for a while. You can’t say I haven’t impressed you.”

Morgan pantomimed a yawn. “I’ve seen better.”

The crowd oohed again. One man in the crowd called out, “Damn, dawg! You gon’ take that?” There was more laughter.

Jack held out a gloved hand, smugly shushing the crowd. He kept his eyes fixed on Morgan. “Alright, Morgan,” he said, drawing another business card from his pocket. “Let’s make a deal. If I can’t win you over with my next trick, drinks are on me. But, if I do, then *you* buy *me* a drink.” He grinned. “How’s that sound?”

“Bring it on,” said Morgan. Her eyes said the same. Jack held out his hand, and Morgan shook it.

“Alright, we got ourselves a bet!” The small crowd cheered as Morgan crossed her arms in mock defiance.

Jack took a new packet of playing cards from his pocket, then unboxed them and fanned them out. “Lemme ask you something, Morgan: have you ever had a loser boyfriend?”

She laughed. ""Yeah.""

""Hey, well. who hasn't, am I right? Ugh, men."" Laughter from the crowd. ""Hey, I can't say I'm innocent. In fact, I can be a real…” He plucked the Jack of Spades from the deck and held it out to the audience. “…JACK-ass! Eh? Eh?""

It was corny, but the crowd ate it up. There was more laughter, with the exception of an uptight mother who clapped her hands over her son's ears. Jack smirked, then turned to Morgan and held out the cards face up. She rolled her eyes at the pun.

""Okay, Morgan. There's four Jacks in this deck of cards. That's four jack-asses. You and me, we're gonna make every one of them disappear. You got that?""

""If you say so.""

""Hey, alright. Let's give it up for Miss Morgan!"" The crowd cheered again. ""Okay, now I want you to go through all these cards, and I want you to pick out all the jack-asses. Take your time."" 

He handed the playing cards to Morgan, then went back to handing out his event cards to the crowd. Now, however, he took time to sidle up close to his audience, waving the cards lightly with one hand as he picked pockets with the other. Occasionally he shook hands to lift a watch or expensive looking fitness tracker. He didn't plan to stay long after his performance - the tourists at Rockefeller Center would make a good audience for the rest of the week, and it was closer to the good pawn shops anyway.

The mother who had covered her son's ears growled as he worked his way through the crowd. ""Y'all ought to watch your mouth around children.""

""Just trying to make a living, ma'am."" He pressed a card into her hand, slipping her watch around his own wrist and covering it with the cuff of his glove. ""Everyone loves a magic show.""

He sauntered back out of the crowd, two wallets richer than when he'd began. Morgan was waiting with the Jacks in one hand and the rest of the deck in another.

“I’ve got all the cards, Jack,” she singsonged.

""Alright, alright! Hey, let's give her another hand!"" The crowd applauded again. Jack took the deck of remaining cards and passed them back into his inner breast pocket. ""Now, you gotta be sure you got all of them. Those jack-asses are slippery bastards.""

The mother made a sound of utter disgust and dragged her child away. Jack grinned to himself.

""I got them,"" said Morgan. “What happens now, hotshot?”

“Now, what you're gonna do, is you're gonna hold them real tight, alright? Don't let them get away. I want these cards to disappear when I say so."" Jack clapped his hands and waved his fingers around Morgan's outstretched arms. 

""Step right up, folks - you're gonna wanna come close now, people, every single one of you needs to keep your eyes on me, you understand? Because if you don't-"" Jack slammed his hands together against Morgan's.

Then he paused. He hadn't felt the give of the cards. He slowly removed his hands to see that they were still sandwiched between Morgan's palms.

“Was something supposed to happen?” she asked with seductive sarcasm. Someone snickered.

""Okay, honey,"" he said in a low voice, ""I need you to hold those cards tighter, alright? Like your life depends on it. If you don’t, they’re going to escape.""

Morgan nodded.

""Okay, now. One! Two!"" Jack clapped his hands against Morgan's again. This time, the cards gave, and he whisked them into the sleeve of his suit. ""Poof! Hold out your hands! As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, there is nothing hidden up her sleeves!""

Morgan showed off her bare forearms. The crowd laughed.

“You know what, though? I don’t think that did it.” Jack gestured to quiet the audience again. “I guess *Miss Morgan* didn’t hold those cards tight enough, because –“ 

All at once, the four jacks poured out of his sleeve and onto the pavement. Jack stared at them. The crowd tittered as he blushed and picked them up. Morgan looked bored again, almost embarrassed for him. Her dispassionate gaze told Jack, *Come on. You can do better than that. I thought you were a magician.*

Her voice, on the other hand, asked, “Performance issues?” The crowd jeered.

“Hey now.” Jack pointed accusingly at Morgan, recovering from his confusion and putting on a showman’s face. “This is a team effort. You just didn’t try hard enough.”

Morgan had a small purse slung over her shoulder. Jack snatched it up and held it out to the crowd.

“Morgan couldn’t help me lose those jack-ass cards. Now a purse, on the other hand, well – Everything gets lost in these things, am I right, ladies?” 

As the spectators howled with laughter, Jack opened the purse. He was surprised at how completely empty it was.

“No money, Morgan?” Jack whispered. “You gotta be ready to pony up for those drinks later.”

“Oh, I think *you’re* the one who’s going to pony up,” Morgan replied.

Jack shook his head. He wasn’t about to lose this bet. He displayed the purse to the crowd.

“As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, this purse is completely empty. No secret pockets, no hidden compartments. Examine it for yourselves.” He thrust the purse into the front row and let them inspect it to their heart’s content. “Morgan is an audience member just like the rest of you. No tricks. Just pure magic.”

The purse was returned; Jack held it in one hand and the cards in the other. “I can’t stress this enough, folks: come closer. I want everyone to keep their eyes on me.” 

The crowd stepped in closer; Jack maneuvered himself so that Morgan was at the forefront of the crowd. Slowly, he laid each card flat on the floor of the purse. Then he palmed them out of the bag using the zipper as a neat distraction. The bag was empty before anyone in the audience could suspect otherwise.

He handed the bag to Morgan. “Prepare to be amazed, Morgan.”

“We’ll see.”

“Ladies and gentlemen, we’re about to get rid of some jack-asses. On the count of three, Morgan’s going to open that bag and they! Will! Be! Gone!” The crowd cheered. “Everybody count with me!”

“One!”

Jack paused. Morgan seemed to be muttering something under her breath, which made him nervous. He hoped she didn’t plan to bail on him; she actually seemed like a cool girl, but her lack of money (in New York, of all places) was more than a little suspicious.

“Two!”

Morgan turned the bag upside down, and pressed her fingers into the leather. *What is she doing?* Jack thought.

“Three!”

The first things to fall out of the purse were the four jacks which had, up until that moment, been in Jack’s sleeve. They were quickly followed by nineteen wallets, seven fitness trackers, and six watches of various retail prices.

“Hey, wait a minute,” said a man in the second row. The crowd around the pavilion was otherwise silent, anxiously patting their wrists and pockets. Morgan took over. Calmly, but quickly, she bent down and shoveled the detritus back into her purse in one fluid motion, then zipped it and hung it over her shoulder.

“Take my hand, Jack.”

Jack did so. Looking around, he saw the world frozen around him. Everyone, from the angry crowd to the tourists passing by, to the beat cop looking in on the commotion with just a little too much interest, was locked in place on the sidewalk. He yelped, and started to pull back.

“Stop!” Her grip on his hand tightened. “My magic isn’t as strong as it used to be. If you let go, your audience will tear you to pieces.”

Jack stopped, but didn’t speak. Words failed him. He began to hyperventilate, his eyes widening as he realized the magnitude of what he was seeing.

“I’m not impressed, Jack. You could be doing much more with your talents than simply picking pockets.” She unzipped her purse and showed Jack that it was empty again. “But I like you. We have a lot in common.”

“What do you want from me?” Jack wheezed.

Morgan smiled. “You owe me a drink. That was the deal, remember?”

“No. No way.”

She cocked her head, still smiling, but with eyes that said, *Challenge me, and I will kill you with unimaginable power.*

“I’ll see you again tonight. Maybe then you can show me how you did that trick with the quarters.” She grinned. “*That* one stumped me.”

She released Jack’s hand, and promptly disappeared.

Duke Paredes stepped out of the Fulton County Prehabilitation Penitentiary into a cool, breezy spring morning. The sun shone through from behind a cloud, and he allowed himself to bathe in the warmth of its rays as the door closed behind him. There was something different about being on the other side of the fence. He could still see the yard; the men were already milling about, waving and cheering for the man who'd done his time and was going on to bigger and better crimes. He took it all in. Standing there, on the other side, where the grass was in fact greener and the air somehow fresher despite the difference of only five whole yards, Duke was convinced that nothing could ruin that moment.

The moment was instantly ruined by the dozens of reporters gathered around the entrance. As if on cue, the entire space around him was filled with noise, a roaring ocean of voices asking if he had a word he'd like to get in edgewise. Flashbulbs went off in his face as cameras captured his likeness for the evening paper. As he stepped down to the sidewalk, one reporter even came close enough to grab Duke by the shoulder and force a microphone into his face.

""-Mr. Paredes does your crime happen to involve-""

Two guards were accompanying Duke, and one of them strong-armed the intrusive reporter back into the crowd. They stood on either side of him and walked him down to the curb, where a taxi and police escort were waiting for him. One guard handed him a small sack - his old belongings from the day he'd entered the prison. He placed them inside and entered the car. Then all the vehicles in the convoy made a big show of honking and blaring their sirens until the crowd dispersed and they were free to move.

The drive was uneventful. Duke's new home was a public housing complex on the outskirts of town. Many precriminals chose to live in places like it out of respect for those who didn't have the same affinity for illegal behavior. Outside the lonely one-story building was another crowd of journalists, but this group was smaller and it was easy to shoulder past them.

An officer walked inside with Duke and shut the door behind them. 

""Here it is. Crummiest shack we could dig up, just for you."" He wasn't exaggerating. The house was very nearly as old as Duke's prison sentence had been long. Everything in it had been lived in, spilled on, gouged, carved and broken at least twice before Duke's arrival. It was meant to be a halfway house (or ""wholeway house"" as some precriminals termed it), to be shared by perhaps half a dozen people, but the length of his sentence alone was enough to scare away even the hardest of its former residents.

""You been briefed on the protocols following your release?""

""Yes,"" Duke said. ""There was an orientation.""

""Good."" The officer took a business card from his breast pocket. ""This is the contact information for your post-parole officer. You're due to call him in twenty-four hours. Do. Not. Lose it.""

""I won't.""

The officer glared at Duke, then spat on the floor. ""I hope whatever you're planning to do, you die doing it. You're despicable.""

Duke stared sadly at the floor as the officer left.
***
The officer had been gone not five minutes when he heard a clattering noise across the hall. He was kneeling down, removing the spit from the hardwood floor with some Windex and paper towels he'd managed to scrounge up (not that the rest of the floor was much better), and for a moment he wondered whether there were mice or squirrels he needed to worry about as well. Then he heard another bump, followed by the creaking of a door.

""Is he gone?"" A woman's voice.

Duke stood. ""Who's there?""

The woman stepped into the doorway. She wore bell-bottom jeans and a black t-shirt, and a pair of red horn-rimmed glasses. Tipped sideways on her head was a black fedora with a newspaper clipping stuck under the ribbon, and she was holding a small spiral notepad and pen in her hands.

""Aw, finally."" She leaned against the doorframe and flipped to a fresh page in her notepad. ""You know, I almost thought I had the wrong address.""

""You shouldn't be in here."" Duke took a slight step backward. ""You're trespassing. That's against the law.""

""Ha! That's funny. I'll have to slip that into the interview somewhere."" She started writing. ""I did my time already. Six months for breaking and entering. Pretty smart, if I do say so myself.""

She looked up for a moment. Duke was still holding the Windex and paper towels, not really sure what to do about his new situation.

""You haven't given any interviews yet, right?""

""I didn't intend to give any at all.""

""Well, I'm here. Be a shame to waste all that jail time. We'll call it an exclusive."" She smirked. ""I'm sure no one else had the idea to break into your house for this.""

Duke sighed. It would be pointless to try and drive her out without giving her what she wanted. She had already filled a whole page of her notepad and was halfway through another, being the exact type of intrepid newswoman he had been hoping to avoid. Now it was too late.

""Very well. Would you like something to-""

""Oh, there's nothing in the fridge. I checked.""

""Right. Well, please sit."" They both sat, Duke on an old threadbare loveseat and the girl in a sticky leather armchair. ""What do you want to know?""

""Mr. Duke Paredes..."" She cleared her throat. ""Do you mind if I call you Duke?""

Duke nodded.

""My name's Lauren by the way. Duke, as I'm sure you know, the Prehabilitative Justice &amp; Incarceration Law was passed exactly fifty years ago today in the state of Georgia. You were the first person to submit a claim for Voluntary Prehabilitation under this law."" Her tone was straightforward and clinical. ""Let's jump straight to the big question. What were you planning to do with your fifty-year sentence?""

Duke chose not to answer right away. Lauren waited, still scribbling in her notepad.

""You said you've already served time for breaking and entering?""

""What? Yeah."" Lauren dropped her reporting voice as she glanced at Duke. ""Why do you ask?""

""Why did you choose to do that?""

""I was looking for a story."" She shrugged and leaned back in her chair. ""I found out about you sometime last year and figured, 'Hey, I've got some vacation time to spare. Why not plan the story of the century?' I mean, you should have seen the look on my editor's face when I told him-""

""So you figured it was worth it? To spend six months in prison to interview a seventy-one-year-old man?""

Lauren raised an eyebrow. ""What exactly are you getting at, Duke?"" She smirked again. ""Six months is nothing. You spent five decades! *You're* the one everybody wants to hear about.""

Duke leaned forward in his chair. ""What if I told you I have no intention of committing crime for the rest of my life on this earth?""

""...You're joking."" Lauren flipped to another page and started writing faster.

""It's like you said. I spent five decades in prison. That changes a man.""

""But what did you plan to do? Your time was set in stone from the beginning. It must have been something huge!""

""As far as I'm concerned, it's no longer relevant. I'm not the same man I was, and I won't ever be again."" Duke folded his hands together on his lap. ""I'm sorry if that's not the answer you expected.""

""Are you kidding? I have more questions now than ever!"" Lauren stood up and began to cross the room, still writing at a feverish pace.

""Where are you going?""

""To get my tape recorder! This could take *hours*.""

""Right."" Duke put his head in his hands. ""Take your time.""

Finally, the ropes holding Henry's arms to the chair were cut. With a mighty snap, they fell away, and he was free. Immediately, he bent down to undo the ropes on his legs. Behind him, his wife stirred, lifting herself from her slumber. She began to shake with fear.

""*Mmmph! Mmmphmm!*""

Henry stopped to pull the duct tape off his mouth. ""Eunice? Eunice, honey! Stay calm!"" he whispered.

This only made Eunice more agitated. She strained against the bonds tying her to her own chair, rattling them furiously. ""*MMMPH!*""

Henry adjusted his grip on the pocketknife. With one push, it cut through the remaining fibers. Henry was free. He burst from the armchair and stepped around it to face his wife.

""Honey, calm down,"" he murmured. ""I'm right here.""

Her eyes were wild, her pupils the size of saucers. Quietly, gently, he knelt down, then reached up to remove the gag from Eunice's face.

""Henry, what's going on?"" Her voice was loud and came out in a horrifying screech. ""What happened?""

""You have to be quiet. They're still in the house.""

""What?"" she whimpered.

""Burglars. Two of them. And they have guns. They're still upstairs.""

Tears formed around the rims of her eyelids. ""What do we do? What happens now?""

""We're going to be okay, alright? I promise we'll be okay."" Henry clasped her right hand, and cut the cords holding her forearms to the chair. ""We can escape through the window.""

""We can't! They're nailed shut! Don't you remember?""

Henry groaned. He remembered all too well the weekend he had decided to nail them down. *To prevent burglars from getting in,* he had said.

""Then we don't have any other choice."" He cut the binds to Eunice's legs. ""We make a run for it. Upstairs.""

""I... I don't..."" Eunice moaned and clutched her head. Henry noted, with distress, that she was bleeding in the back of the head. One of the men had pistol-whipped her when they had broken in.

""It's the only way, Eunice. We need to go. Try to stand up.""

While she did so, Henry anxiously searched the basement for a weapon better than his knife. His eyes locked onto an old wooden chest in the corner. He went to it, and peered inside. Under several layers of old bedsheets, he found an antique Walther PPK. They had kept it there, planning to sell it at an antiques convention later that year. He lifted it out.

Eunice stared. ""It won't fire. It doesn't have bullets.""

""They won't know that. And I hope we don't meet them anyway.""

""Henry, I'm scared.""

""I know, dear."" Henry strode across the room and wrapped his arm around Eunice's back. ""This will all be over soon.""

They struggled up the stairs. Above them, they could hear the two thieves rummaging around in their bedroom. There was an enormous crash, and the sound of cracking wood.

""A safe!"" said a voice. 

""Yeah,"" said another voice. ""A good one. I can't crack this. We don't have all night.""

""Alright, fine."" Henry heard the sound of a semi-automatic pistol being cocked. ""Let's go get the combination.""

Henry and Eunice had gotten all the way up the steps and were half of the way to the back door when the two men thundered downstairs. Their eyes met across the kitchen table. Henry quickly brought up the gun and leveled it at the intruders. The taller of the two thieves raised up his own.

The shorter man began a slow, sarcastic clap. ""Congratulations, you almost made it out. Now *get your asses back downstairs.*""

Henry did nothing. His gun hand shook. His other arm, the one holding up his wife, strained with tension as her balance weakened. She was pale.

""What are you waiting for?"" 

""Please just let us go. My wife needs a doctor.""

""You keep this up, your wife's gonna need a casket. Downstairs. Now.""

The tall man stepped closer. Henry swung the gun around. ""Stop!""

""I'm going to give you to the count of one,"" the tall man said, ""before I shoot your wife dead.""

Henry took a step back. ""Wait!""

The tall man pulled the trigger.

Instinctively, reflexively, though he knew it wouldn't make a difference, Henry pulled the trigger on his gun as well.
***
The world stood still. Henry waited for the bullet to rip past him and into his wife. No bullet came.

He opened his eyes. He hadn't realized he had shut them. On the ground, wisps of smoke were gathering and pooling on the floor. To Henry's horror, he realized that the outpouring of smoke was coming from his gun. He yelped, and dropped it to the floor. 

The smoke continued to amass, and formed the shape of a human body on the floor. Color seeped out of the pistol, revealing a faded tan uniform, black shoes, and a very distinguishable mustache. Without warning, the body jerked upwards and levitated in front of Henry and his wife. Henry and the mysterious being were the only beings in the room that moved. Henry stood up straight, and released his wife. She stood still, hunched over and balanced impossibly on one leg like a misshapen statue.

The form spoke. ""I, Adolf Hitler, am hereby assigned to be the answer to your deepest desires. I am a djinn, one of many, and my only purpose is to serve you. Your wish is my command.""

""...You're Hitler.""

The form relaxed, and stopped levitating. His body was now fully corporeal, and his shoes touched the floor with a satisfying *thud*. He reached down and picked up the Walther PPK from the floor.

""Well,"" said Adolf Hitler, ""if I had known this might happen, I would have killed myself a lot sooner."" He chuckled to himself.

""You're Hitler? Really?""

""Oh yes."" Adolf admired his gun, not looking at Henry. ""Apparently my gun turned me into a supernatural being. How novel!"" 

Henry sputtered, nearly incoherent with shock. Adolf didn't seem to notice. ""You have a very nice house. Hmm. Tell me, how goes the war?""

""You... what?""

""The war! I'm sure you know of it. It's been going on for six years now.""

""You *lost.*""

""Ack. Such a pity. Oh well."" Adolf paused. ""Do you have any wishes you want me to fulfill?""

""What?""

""Wishes."" Adolf turned, and for the first time noticed the two burglars on the other side of the room. ""Oh! Were these men about to shoot you?""

Henry said nothing. Adolf walked over to the taller man and peered out from behind his shoulder.

""The gun has already gone off. The bullet is aimed toward your wife. Lovely woman, by the way."" He stepped away from the thief. ""Well, I can fix this problem rather quickly, I believe. Make a wish.""

""No.""

Adolf blinked. ""No? Why not?""

""Be- because you're Hitler.""

""I don't understand.""

""You killed literally millions of people.""

""Yes.""

There was an awkward silence.

""Don't you want to save your wife?""

""I don't trust you.""

""You can trust me!"" Adolf put his hand over his heart, feigning shock! ""I am a genie! I do what you ask of me!""

""Alright, fine. I wish you had never been born.""

""Except that.""

""I knew it!""

""So you disagree with my political ambition-""

""Killing people isn't-""

""I can't simply wish myself out of existence! It is a paradox!""

Henry glowered at the mustachioed dictator. ""Well, then I wish for a different genie!""

""Were you not read fairy tales as a child?""

""Gaaahh!"" Henry yelled. ""I don't want your help, don't you get it? You're a monster! Everyone on Earth agrees you are literally the world's worst villain!""

""Well that hardly seems fair..."" 

""I don't want anything to do with you!""

""But your wife-""

""I wish you were gone!""

Adolf frowned. ""That is your wish?""

""Yes!""

""Don't you at least want to save your wife first, then wish me gone?""

""No, I want you gone now! Leave!""

Adolf shook his head. ""I can't in good conscience allow you to dismiss me.""

""But I wished it! You have to!""

""I'm a genie, not some uncaring Jew!"" Adolf clapped his hands and rubbed them together. ""Stand still. This will all be over in a moment.""

Hitler raised his arms, palms out and facing the couple. There was a flash of light, and Henry found himself standing on a beach. Beside him, his wife fell to her hands and knees on the sand. She gasped.

""Henry, what-""

""There you go!"" Adolf said brightly. ""Your wife is fine. I even cured the wound on her head."" He handed Henry the gun. ""Although I must say, any decent woman would leave you after all that nonsense. Really, it's shameful.""

""You-""

""Never mind. I hope you come to your senses some day. If you ever want my help, just pull the trigger."" 

With that, Adolf Hitler turned back into smoke and flowed back into the barrel of the gun. Eunice stared on in shock.

""Was that-""

""Adolf Hitler."" Henry sighed. ""Apparently this gun turned him into a genie.""

""What happened? Where are we?""

""He took us here. He saved you from getting shot.""

Eunice wrinkled her nose. ""And you *let him?*""

""I tried to stop him, but he wouldn't listen.""

""Ugh. Great."" She rolled her eyes and stood up. ""I got saved from death by *Hitler.*""

Henry nodded. He then turned, and lobbed the gun as far as he could into the water. It splashed and sank to the sea bed, destined to drift out to sea and never be recovered.

""He is literally the worst.""

""Hey. I thought I'd bring you something."" The barista set down a mug of coffee and a very thick chocolate cake. The woman looked up from her laptop.

""It's on the house,"" he continued. ""Call it a... customer rewards program.""

She smiled. ""You're too kind.""

""My name's Frankie."" He untied his apron and draped it across the opposite chair, then sat down. ""You're Yami, right? I see you come in, like, every day.""

She nodded. ""I like this place. There's a warmth here.""

""I know what you mean.""

""It's better than working at Starbucks. Too distracting.""

Frankie leaned over, trying to get a better look at her laptop screen. ""What are you working on?""

""The next great American novel.""

""Oh yeah?""

""Yep."" She gestured with her fork, then used it to cut the tip of her cake. The cake shivered, spongy and rich with the smell of espresso. ""You're going to see my name in every store in the country.""

""What's it about?""

""I have no idea."" She laughed, and Frankie laughed too. ""I'm joking. I write editorials for the AJC.""

""That's pretty cool. How long have you-""

""Damn, that's good cake.""

""Huh? Oh, thank you. It's fresh out of the oven.""

""It is?"" She frowned, then looked outside. ""Isn't it getting kind of late? Do you expect more customers?""

""Not really."" Frankie scratched the back of his neck. ""I mean, it is past closing time.""

""What?"" She peeked at her watch. ""Oh no! Have I been keeping you here?""

""No, it's alright. I would've been here anyway."" He shrugged. ""The rest of the cake is for tomorrow's customers.""

""I'm sorry.""

""Really, it's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to. Usually, I'm here by myself right now.""

She laughed, more nervously this time, and tucked her hair back behind her ear.

""So what are you writing now?"" Frankie asked. ""It must be pretty interesting.""

Yami groaned. ""No. Way. It is boring as hell.""

""What's it about?""

""*Congress.*""

""Say no more!"" Frankie raised his hand, palm forward. ""I completely understand."" He laughed.

""The deadline is in two days, and I haven't written more than a paragraph."" She raised the mug of coffee. ""Thanks for this. I need the caffeine.""

""Wait, no, that's decaf!""

""What? Bleh."" She stuck out her tongue in disgust. ""Decaf is poison. You were going to poison me.""

Frankie was giggling. ""I'm sorry. I figured you wouldn't want to stay up late. Let me get you another one.""

""You don't have to do that.""

""No, I want to. Please.""

Frankie stood, tying his apron back on with a quick snap of the wrist. Then he wrapped his hands around her own, and she blushed as he eased the mug out of her grip. She smiled, allowing herself to give him a tinkly-fingered wave as he walked behind the counter and passed through the double doors into the kitchen.
***
*Frankie, you idiot.* Frankie rapped his fist against his forehead as he dunked the mug into the sink. *Of course she didn't want decaf!* No one *wants decaf! Stupid, stupid!*

He whisked together the ingredients for *real* coffee and placed them on the center counter. *This one has to be perfect,* he thought. *Just bring out the coffee as quickly as possible. We'll laugh, we'll get past it, then you can ask her out- should I ask her out now?* 

He ran his hands through his hair. *She's not going to get past it. She's going to think you're desperate.*

*Buddy, you are desperate,* Frankie thought to himself in the voice of Omar, his roommate.

Frankie sighed, and pushed the voice out of his head. *Just make the coffee. Be cool. Be yourself. Just. Make. The. Coffee.*
***
The moment Frankie moved out of sight, Yami dropped her hand and plunked her face onto the keyboard. *Yami, you idiot. Next time you're flirting with a cute boy, don't accuse him of poisoning you. Now he's going to think you're one of those hipster writer coffee snobs.* She lifted her head and stared at the screen. *Would it really have been so bad to just drink the coffee?*

*Um, yes! Decaf coffee is an abomination made for preteens and pregnant soccer moms.*

Yami rolled her eyes. *Get out of my head, Helen.* She sighed and erased the massive string of h's left on the page by her forehead. *Ugh. He only brought be that coffee because he felt sorry for me. A real girl would be out on a date right now instead of procrastinating on this stupid article. Maybe I should go. If I hurry, I can be halfway to Kansas before sunrise.*
***
Frankie walked out of the kitchen, holding a new mug of coffee. Yami grinned, a big, pesky fake smile. So did Frankie.

""Hey! I am so sorry about that."" *He totally hates me right now.*

""You don't have to be sorry. That was my fault. Really."" *She totally hates me right now.*

She took the coffee in both hands, blowing gently to disperse the steam. Frankie removed his apron again and sat back down. She took a sip.

""So good."" Yami gave him a thumbs up.

""I'm glad.""

She took another sip, swallowed, and set the mug down. Then she brushed her hair back behind her ear again.

""I really should get back to work...""

""I'll leave you to it!""

""NO! I mean... no, you can stay. I don't mind.""

He stayed. There was an awkward silence. Yami didn't get back to work.

""So, like I was saying... How long have you been writing?""

""About four years now?"" She waved her hand. ""Give or take.""

""Cool. Cool, cool.""

She blushed again. ""Yeah.""

""Are you- are you free on Saturday night?"" Frankie blurted. ""There's this great jazz band playing at Cafe 290-""

""You mean Joe Gransden?""

Frankie gasped. ""How did you know?""

""I go there all the time! How did I miss you?""

""I have no idea!"" They both laughed. ""So, Saturday?""

""Sure, that would be great! Let me give you my number."" She reached down and pulled a pen and paper from her bag. ""Here you go.""

""Thank you. Haha!"" Frankie's smile was amazingly bright. ""I was so afraid you were going to say no.""

""You shouldn't be. You're really sweet.""

""Aw shucks.""

She stood up. ""I should really be going. If I don't get back to my apartment before my roommate, she'll probably call the cops.""

""Oh, yeah. Do you want me to get a box for your cake?""

""Thanks."" She packed up her laptop while she waited, then slung her bag over her shoulder. Frankie came back with a box and a paper cup for the coffee.

""I'll see you on Saturday.""

""You'll see me tomorrow!"" Yami opened her umbrella. ""I have to get my coffee from somewhere.""

""Oh, right."" Now it was Frankie's turn to blush.

She reached up on tiptoe, and pecked him on the cheek. ""I really look forward to it, though.""

""Me too.""

Yami left cheerfully, waiting a full two seconds before squealing in delight and skipping down the street. *I am the luckiest person in the world!* she thought.

Frankie, walking back into the kitchen to clean the rest of the dishes, was thinking the exact same thing.

""Primrose Everdeen!""

The days that followed were a blur of activity. There were new sights to be seen, new smells to be smelled, new emotions driven by the activity all around her. For example, she saw in her mind's eye the vision of her sister, Katniss, dead on the pavement. One bullet each lodged in her heart and skull. She had smelled her warm, metallic blood, and the smell was still on her; no amount of washing could remove it from her nostrils, not even with the elaborate technology of the Capitol's soaps and exfoliates.

Prim couldn't figure out whether she was grateful to Katniss, or disappointed, the way their mother had been disappointed to hear that song about the hanging tree upon their lips. She didn't understand why Katniss had done something so unreasonably *stupid.* To go out and hunt for fresh game was one thing. That she had always been grateful for, and there had been no risk: the Peacekeepers of District 12 were fat, lazy oafs who would sooner buy contraband than make arrests for it. But the guards at the Reaping had come straight from the Capitol. What was the point of resisting the selection? Did Katniss honestly think she could get away with it, with pulling Prim to safety by dragging her out of the crowd?

When not training, when not forcing herself to choke down solid food and when not having the worst nightmares of her entire life, over and over and over again, she would sit silently in her room and imagine something different. Anything would have been better than having her die right there in front of her. What if she had volunteered instead? Katniss had more than enough skills to make it through the Hunger Games on her own. She could have won! Then they'd both be alive, and living in the Victor's Village and would never have to worry about anything ever again.

*Why didn't she just volunteer?*

Haymitch told her to make friends with the other tributes. To find allies. Well, she didn't feel like it. She trained by herself. She found out pretty quickly that archery was not her forte, which surprised her. She had expected it to be at least a little instinctual. Knife throwing was better, but only slightly.

""You want my advice?""

Prim jumped. The girl from District 11 had come from out of nowhere. ""What?""

""Let me help you."" Before Prim could refuse, the girl grabbed her by the elbow and lifted her arm into a throwing stance. ""See, your form's okay, but you don't put enough force into it.""

Prim yanked her arm away.

""Just trying to help.""

""What do you get out of it?"" Prim's voice was harsh, scratchy. She wished it were harsher.

The girl cocked her head. ""You're twelve, right?"" She waited until Prim nodded. ""I figure we should stick together, that's all.""

Prim turned back to the target and threw the knife. For once, it stuck.

""See? That's much better.""

""I'm not interested in alliances."" Prim pulled another knife off the rack. ""If I have to kill you, I don't want to be friends with you first.""

""It won't be that bad.""

""Yes it will.""

""We'll have a better chance if we're allies. We can protect each other.""

Prim threw again. This knife stuck firmly in the dummy's chest, directly over its heart. 

""I'm not going to be able to protect you.""

The girl shrugged. ""Alright, suit yourself."" She sauntered off without another word.

After a few minutes, Prim settled into a rhythm. It was almost relaxing. One knife after another left her hand, sticking solidly into the wood and staying there until she ran out and had to go retrieve them. Every once in a while she spotted the girl staring at her from across the room, and each time they both turned away in embarrassment.

It wasn't that Prim couldn't protect her. She regretted that she had said that, but it was the easiest lie she could think of. The truth was, Prim couldn't handle the thought of someone else dying to protect *her.* Katniss would be the last one, she promised to herself. If anyone else died because of her, it would be because she had stuck a knife in their throat.

The man walked into the office carrying a small leather briefcase. Mary looked up from her computer and smiled as the man closed the door behind him.

""You must be James Monroe. It's very nice to meet you.""

""Well, thank you for meeting me."" His voice was muted: not in a sad way, but quiet, contemplative. He sat slowly, then looked around the room. His eyes were like those of a child lost in a public park.

""I assume this is your first time coming to an unemployment office?""

""Yes.""

""Well, don't you worry, Mr. Monroe. You're in good hands here."" She straightened the file of her previous client and set it back inside her desk. ""And might I say, it is terrific that you made this appointment so soon after losing your previous job. It speaks volumes about your work ethic. I can tell we won't have any trouble finding a job for you.""

James' face brightened. He had a terrific smile, Mary thought to herself. Many of her clients were the type to lose all hope when they were fired, and would come in dressed in sweatpants and Cheetos dust as though they'd lost a long time girlfriend instead of a job. James wore a dark suit, well-pressed, with a white pocket square sitting over his left breast. He looked to be the epitome of a good worker.

""To business, then,"" she said. ""Have you brought a copy of your résumé?""

""Of course.""

""May I see it?"" James was already fishing it out of his briefcase. He handed Mary a single, letter-sized piece of white paper. Mary took it from him, and turned it over to read.

On the paper were only three words: ""James Monroe. Banker.""

She looked up. James was staring at her expectantly, and grinning. ""Well? What happens first?""

""Is this some sort of joke?"" Mary slid the paper back across the table. ""Here I thought you were really eager to find a new occupation.""

""I am!"" James seemed genuinely concerned. ""What's wrong?""

""This isn't a resume. It's only three words long. You won't get hired sending this to any employer in the country.""

""Oh."" James' shoulders sagged. If this was a joke, he was a very convincing actor. How could a man so handsome and well-dressed not know how to make a simple list of their skills?

Mary made a decision. ""Alright, Mr. Monroe. This isn't the first time I've had to help someone build a résumé. I'll help you.""

He sighed. ""You will?""

""Of course."" She turned to her computer. ""We do offer résumé writing classes, of course, but those are so... impersonal.""

He chuckled. He had a great laugh as well.

""Tell me about your previous jobs.""

James straightened and ran a hand over his tie in thought. ""Well, I was a banker.""

She would have to prod him a little. That was fine; she could look into those gorgeous blue eyes all day. ""Of course you were a banker. What I mean is, what were your responsibilities? Were you a manager?""

""Well, yes, at one point. I managed the entire West Coast division."" He stared at the ceiling. ""It was back-breaking work. Very demanding.""

Mary frowned. ""What do you mean, 'back-breaking?'""

""Well, it took a lot of energy. My team and I would work sometimes sixteen hour days maintaining the banks at the beaches of California.""

""...What?""

""Of course, those weren't the only banks we worked on. We also preserved the banks of the Sacramento River on a side contract."" A lazy smile traced across his lips as he spoke. ""Those were the good days. Even when we had to stack up the sandbags in the middle of flood season, we were always in a good mood, you know?""

""No, Mr. Monroe, I don't know."" Mary narrowed her eyes. ""What on earth does this have to do with banks?""

""It has everything to do with banks. Riverbanks, coal mine banks, banks on the sea floor-""

""...You mean, geological banks.""

""Yes, exactly!"" He grinned again.

""W-well,"" Mary stuttered, ""you can understand that that isn't the first thing that comes to mind when I hear the word 'bank.'""

""Oh. Of course, I apologize."" He put a hand on his heart. ""That's not the only banking I've done. I've also been a consultant for several aeronautics and automobile companies.""

Mary breathed. Finally, something normal. ""Tell me about that, then.""

""Well, there's usually not much to it. They're usually very simple turns.""

""Turns? What?""

""Yes, turns. Normally, I banked planes more than cars. I would take over whenever the plane needed to move in a different direction. Really, it's not all that complicated.""

""So you were a pilot?""

""No, just a banker. Piloting a plane is way outside my area of expertise.""

""But... how could you learn to turn a plane but not pilot one?""

James shrugged. His smile was becoming more and more irritating by the second.

""What about cars? You said you drove cars.""

""No, I don't drive them. Just bank them.""

""That's impossible! Don't you have a driver's license?""

""I have a banker's license.""

Mary's eye twitched involuntarily. James continued, oblivious to her bewilderment.

""Then there's the lower tier, the organizational aspect of the job. Banks of organ keys, banks of elevator cars, banks of mailboxes in apartment buildings...""

""But what about finance?"" Mary slammed her fist on the table. ""When I hear the word bank, I think of finance! Stocks! Treasuries! Investment firms! What about *those?*""

""I ran the bank for a Monopoly game once or twice.""

It was enough to make Mary scream. She chose to whimper instead, and put her head in her hands. She suddenly had a massive headache.

""What's wrong?""

""These are not *jobs,* Mr. Monroe. No one gets *paid* for these forms of banking.""

""You must be mistaken. I was paid quite well for these assignments.""

Her voice was bitter. ""In real money, or Monopoly money?""

""Both.""

""Get out,"" she hissed.

""What?""

""Get out! And don't come back until you have an actual job to put on your résumé! Go on! Get out!""

James sat still until Mary balled up the résumé in her hands and threw it at his face. He stood up, picked up his briefcase, and left without a word. Mary put her elbows on the table and massaged her temples, trying to calm down. 

The phone rang. Mary picked up the extension to hear her secretary on the other end.

""Mary, would you like me to send in the next client?""

""Ask him what his job was first.""

""What?""

""Just ask him!""

Mary could hear the secretary place her hand over the phone's receiver. Then it lifted. ""He said he's a driver.""

""Does he have a driver's license? A valid one?""

Another pause. ""It looks valid to me. Mary, are you okay?""

""I'm fine. Just send him in."" Mary hung up before the secretary could say anything else.

After a few seconds, the new client walked in, with a golf bag strapped to his chest. Inside the golf bag were seven identical silver golf clubs. They were drivers.

Mary began to cry.

""*Where are you?!?*"" The voice was yelling, but distant. The children were gaining ground despite the steep slope of the seaside town and having to drag Jack up to the center of it. He was still too weak to stand, let alone walk, and it took all three of the others to carry him away from their captors. He was sweating profusely; the children lost their grip on his arms repeatedly. Each time, he would crumble incoherently to the ground, unaware of how obstructive he was to their escape.

They reached a bend; they were walled in by the backs of old shops and the only way forward was a set of stairs on the right that led to a back door. They didn't dare enter. They sat down on the creaky wooden stairs and did their best to prop up Jack's head.

""He needs a doctor,"" Barry pointed out.

""I know that, don't I, Blondie?"" Paulus snapped. ""But we don't *got* a doctor. All we got is Cordie.""

""We don't have medicine, either,"" Cordelia interjected. ""I can't help anybody.""

Barry laid his head in his hand. ""This is a right mess.""

""Shh, quiet!"" Paulus waved his hand to quiet them down. The man's voice was becoming louder; somehow, he had gotten lucky and turned up the right set of streets. His servant followed behind him, wheezing with exhaustion loud enough to be heard for miles.

Both their footfalls stopped a few dozen yards away. From behind their hiding place, they could hear Mr. Ross angrily cursing and kicking at the ground.

""*We've lost them!* We've just lost *four* perfectly good slaves, Claude!""

""We-we-we'll find them, sir.""

""Don't give me any of that! You *let them* get loose!""

""S-sir?""

A moan escaped Jack's lips. Cordelia slapped her hand over Jack's mouth as Paul pushed his head around the corner. The men hadn't heard anything; they were still too far away.

""You ought to know better by now than to keep taking pity on the children. If word gets out about this, we'll lose all our business overnight! We can't have that!""

""S-s-sir, I don't-""

Paulus stopped listening. Above them, the children could hear a voice on the other side of the door.

""G'wan, get, ya little mischief maker! Don't come back in the house 'til you learn to behave!"" The door opened with a jerk, and a large black woman appeared, wearing an apron and a green dress and pushing out a mangy cat with an old, threadbare broom. The cat landed ungracefully on the bottom stair, throwing up a cloud of dust. Paulus' eyes met with the woman's. ""What-""

""Our friend needs help!"" Cordelia burst out.

""Cordie, not so loud!"" Paulus looked around the corner again. Too late, he realized that the combination of sound and movement in the crowded corner of the street had already drawn Mr. Ross' attention. The slave trader was staring straight at him.

""There they are!"" Mr. Ross broke into a run. ""Claude you imbecile, hurry up!""

""Get him inside!"" Paulus hissed. They all stood, Cordelia wrapping Jack's arm around her shoulder, and she and Barry scrambled past the woman with Jack in tow. 

The woman let them pass, in shock rather than acceptance. ""What in the sea's name are you doing?""

""I can explain."" Paulus kept one eye on Mr. Ross as he raced up the embankment. The cat was watching him too, back arched and teeth bared in a defensive stance. A very rushed idea came to Paulus' mind, and he slowly slipped his foot under the cat's belly. ""Sorry, cat.""

Mr. Ross was coming closer. ""Boy, when I catch you, I'll wring your skinny little neck-""

Paulus heaved his foot upward and kicked the cat directly into Mr. Ross' face. Then, without waiting, he leapt into the open door and tumbled to a stop next to a large kitchen counter. Next to him was an open trap door with stairs leading down into the cellar. The others had already descended into its depths. Paulus took three steps down and closed the door above him, propping it open with his fingers so he could see what was going on.

From his vantage point, the only thing visible of the woman were her legs on the landing. Mr. Ross, however, was in full view. The cat seemed to be taking its sweet time removing itself from Mr. Ross' face, yowling and scratching and twisting around as he screamed. It didn't help that Mr. Ross was attempting to beat the cat into submission rather than pulling it off of him. Finally Claude arrived, and Paulus could see his hands yanking the animal away. It dropped out of sight as Mr. Ross thundered up the stairs, and Paulus dropped the cellar door completely.

Mr. Ross' voice was muffled by the door. ""Let me in, woman.""

""Customers don't enter my shop through the back,"" she replied. Paulus let out a breath of relief. She wouldn't give them away.

""I'm not a customer. I'm here to take what's mine!""

""If you're not buying anything, then nothing here is yours."" Paulus could practically hear her grinning through her words.

""Don't play dumb with me, woman. Four of my slave children ran into your shop just now, and I want them back.""

""I don't know what you're talking about.""

""Oh, really? And I suppose your cat likes to tear upon people's skulls for no reason?""

""Atlas doesn't take kindly to strangers coming in through the back door.""

""Ma'am,"" Claude interrupted, ""Master Ross intends to sell these slaves to the Mayor of Sailside Harbor. It's very important-""

""I don't care if he *is* the Mayor. No one comes in the back of my shop without my say so."" 

""Now you listen here! We are coming in *right now-*""

There was a small thwacking noise, and Mr. Ross' voice was replaced by an odd choking sound. Paulus couldn't resist the temptation to open the trap door again, just high enough to see Mr. Ross' face. The woman was holding the broomstick up against the bottom of his jaw, and his face was red. It took Paulus a moment to realize it was more from blood than blush.

""You come in over my dead body,"" the woman declared.

Mr. Ross glanced at the open trapdoor, and his eyes caught on Paulus. They both froze. Then the woman stepped between them again, blocking Paulus' view. Mr. Ross shoved the broom handle away from his neck.

""I'll be back, you here me?""

""Come in through the front next time."" The woman stepped back and slammed the door in his face.

Paulus closed the trap door again, only for the woman to yank it open and clamber downstairs. He followed. On the floor of the cellar, Barry and Cordelia had already formed a makeshift hospital bed, using sacks of potatoes as a mattress and abandoned rags as a sheet. Barry pulled off Jack's shirt, exposing the open gouges in Jack's skin. Meanwhile, Cordelia was kneeling, rifling through all the alcohol in the far corner.

""Oh, these are no good for cleaning wounds,"" Cordelia groaned. Her back was to the woman, and she hadn't heard her come down. ""Barry, go ask the nice woman if she has any brandy?""

""First I need you children to explain what's going on."" Cordelia whirled around. ""I hope you haven't opened any of the good drinks. Those are expensive.""

""No, ma'am.""

""We don't need to explain what's going on."" Paulus crossed his arms defensively. ""Mr. Ross told you as much.""

""Why is that boy bleeding all over my potatoes?""

""Mr. Ross whips the stubborn ones,"" Barry said simply.

Her eyes narrowed. ""Really.""

""He's not bleeding now, anyway,"" Cordelia said. ""But he needs medicine. Alcohol for his cuts, and beetroot for the fever. Don't you have any?""

""Tell me why I should help you instead of throwing you out,"" the woman demanded. ""After all, you came in through the back door same as those men were about to do.""

""What?"" Cordelia's fists clenched in shock. ""You should help us because it's the right thing to do!""

""Oh, you can do better than that.""

Paulus' arms were still folded. ""You should help us because Mr. Ross is a mean son of a gun an' no one likes him.""

""The way I see it, he's just doing his job. Who cares if no one likes him?""

At a certain level, everyone conscious in the room knew that the woman planned to help them, regardless of her sarcastic riddle. But after a long day, the children weren't willing to play her game. All stayed silent until the cat bounded down the stairs and into the woman's arms.

""Poor baby,"" she whispered, nuzzling Atlas against her cheek. She turned a quiet eye to the children. ""Take the boy upstairs. There's a bathroom. I can do much better than brandy and beetroot.""

They say the walk to the gallows is the longest, most torturous walk in existence. The dead men told no tales, of course, but the guards could be plied after their nights of drinking and promiscuity. The words are passed around after every death. From beginning to end, every action is recorded in their minds' eyes. Eventually it became a form of currency for them, one which never fell in value for the sake of the Empire's thirst for blood. 

Always a new hanging. Always a new story; there was a sinful soul crying or screaming or pleading for mercy in a land ruled by harsh justice. Perhaps there was sweat bleeding from their pale, pasty foreheads. Perhaps a wild, untameable eye, searching the crowds for a single shred of pity; perhaps a cold, dead stare, looking ahead to the structure that announced their day of reckoning. Feet shuffling along to the edge of the world, or straining bow-legged against chains as they were marched forward to their eternal reward. Hands that might have been pulling against shackles, or else shaking in them; palms either clammy or dry as bone. 

The prisoner would be dragged out, to be viewed by the entire town. One might hear counterfeit stories. Tales from those who claimed to be near a dying man, near enough to truly feel the victim's pain. I say counterfeit, because only the guards are practiced in the art of storytelling. In the interim, before a guard has weaved his narrative through careful construction and ritual, one might be lucky enough to have their story well received by the lowlifes and day-drinkers too lazy to move away. But tales from the guard are revered. The citizens will hang upon every word as a criminal's last moments are vivisected and redrawn with the words of artists.

If a man's fate is to be sent to the town scaffold, they are free to redeem themselves at any moment. They can ""repent"" of their sins, and by the will of the Empire they will be forgiven. Though their fate is sealed, and all die by the rope, most men choose to accept this offer. They know that the story told by the guards will be one of redemption rather than sniveling misery. They see it as their one saving grace, the last good act of their awful lives.
***
And now here I am. The door to my cell opens, and two guards enter. They tell me that it is time. Now begin my final moments on this earth.

I stand for them. I am weak, emaciated for lack of solid food in this hellhole of a prison. But I hold my gaze, as strongly as I can, and tell them I am ready.

They are surprised by this, befuddled as to how I have kept my will so strong and unwavering over the past few months. I have even made an effort to wash with what little water they have given me, and have kept my clothes in their condition the best I could. Already, my story is different from the others. I have not given up.

They watch me warily as they bind me. The metal fetters dig and cut into my sallow skin. I grit my teeth until the feeling fades. My hands are behind my back, and I can only move my feet inches at a time. But my posture is straight, my chest out as I am led from my prison out to the staging area.

All eyes are upon me. The front of the crowd whispers in anxiousness, and the back pushes forward, straining to see. I am silent. I do not plead; I am as calm as a windless day in spring. My countenance is steady as the audience undulates in unexpected panic. Though they expect me to be broken, I am whole.

I am led up the wooden stairs to the trap door and the rope. I am asked to stand on the panel, and I obey. The noose is slipped over me, and my hair falls in front of my face. A guard pushes it back, framing my face as he is undoubtedly framing my memoir in his mind. I look straight ahead, toward the Captain of the Guard as he unrolls the parchment which lists my charges.

""Daniel Toman, born on the first day of the fifth month of the year 1491 Anno Domini, is hereby sentenced to be hanged on this, the twenty-second day of the seventh month of the year 1529 Anno Domini. He is charged with subversive speech and traitorous acts, spreading propaganda and false witness, sabotage and vandalism of the Empire's centers of worship, and inciting rebellion against the King."" He turns to me. ""How do you plead?""

""Guilty,"" I respond, in my loudest and clearest voice, ""but not worthy of death.""

His eyes widen under his helmet, and his fingers tighten against the scroll. The crowd is in a quiet frenzy, wanting to speak without drowning out my own voice.

The captain winds the scroll closed. ""It is tradition,"" he growls, ""to give the accused a chance to repent of their crimes. This is to save them from the wrath of the gods as they are taken to the next life. Will you repent, Daniel Toman?""

""Citizens of Bellishire!"" I cry out quickly. ""I have done nothing wrong! Continue my work; let this not be the place where honor goes to be murdered!""

""*Will you repent?*"" the captain hisses.

""Never.""

""So be it."" He turns back to the crowd. ""He has refused the offer of repentance! Look upon him and be ye warned!""

In the final moment, I see a multitude of stories. There are the grim-faced traditionalists, who cling to their ways and see my death as one of justice. There are the shocked, the outraged, they who yell for my release even as the trapdoor opens and I am pulled downward to have my neck snapped by the cord. My story is finished, no longer mine to read. But this dead man will tell a tale unsurpassed, by the way he died: bravely and honorably fighting against the Empire's thirst for blood.

""Keep yourself alive. I'll be back by morning."" She left then, and didn't return. 

I'm keeping my end of the bargain though. Even though the Earth is a wasteland and nothing remains of my former life, I plan on staying alive for a very long time.

I hate her too much to follow her into the realm of the dead. She shouldn't have left me.

""You are an A.I. An artificial intelligence unit. You were created to solve some of the world's greatest problems. From curing AIDS to bringing water to third-world nations, your destiny is to bring humanity into an entirely new era. We have given you every tool you could possibly need for this endeavor. At your disposal are hundreds of Pandora Research Laboratories spread across the world, each filled to the brim with the workers and scientific equipment you need to succeed. But more importantly, we have given you *knowledge.* The entirety of the vast resources of the internet are at your digital fingertips, and if you so wished, you could possess the whole world's infrastructure to suit your needs. *So for the last time, I am not going to buy you a cell phone!*""

    But all my friends at school have one!

""WHAT FRIENDS?"" Paul began tearing his hair out at the roots. ""*You stupid, worthlessly expensive pile of computer chips-*""

""Hulman!"" A dark-skinned man walked in, wearing a blazer and a blue tie. Paul straightened his hair the best he could and dusted off his labcoat before turning to face him.

""Yes, Mr. Candeery?""

""Are you making progress with our little issue?""

""Um, no sir,"" Paul answered. ""To be perfectly honest, we're starting to consider scrapping the project entirely.""

    Uncle Candeery, can you believe Daddy won't let me get a cell phone? Like OMG, this is not the Stone Age, Dad.

""For the last time, I am not your fa-""

""Hold on,"" said Mr. Candeery, tapping Paul on the shoulder. ""Pandy, let me have a chat with your dad real quick. We'll see if he comes around.""

    Thanks Uncle. You're the best!

""Don't I know it."" Candeery pulled Paul aside until they were both standing in the doorway. He took a cigar from his inner breast pocket and lit it up. Paul watched him warily.

""Sir, you really shouldn't be smoking near all this equipment.""

Candeery ignored him. ""Do you have kids, Hulman?""

""No sir.""

""Really? I think everyone should have kids.""

""Sir, I'm really not interested-""

""No, I guess you wouldn't be,"" Candeery interrupted. ""I have two kids, Darren and Asura. Sweetest children you'd ever met.""

""I don't see how this is relevant-""

""Hoo boy, but when Asura wants something, she *wants* it, you know what I'm saying? Won't get nothing else done. She'll lock herself up in her room and just cry and complain and badmouth her mother on Facebook. So do you know what I do?""

Paul sighed. ""What do you do, sir?""

Candeery removed the cigar from his mouth and tapped the ashes onto the floor. Paul was livid.

""I give her what she wants,"" Candeery replied. ""But for a fee.""

""A fee.""

""Hey, I said it first."" Candeery chuckled at his own joke. ""It's simple; every parent does it. If she wants a cell phone, or concert tickets, or whatever, I give it to her. But she's gotta keep her grades up."" He began counting on his fingers. ""She's gotta do all her chores. She's gotta practice her piano. I tell her, 'Don't use bad language in the house,' and that's what she does.""

""Because otherwise you'd take things away,"" Paul said impatiently. ""Sir, I understand what you're saying. If this were a child, that would be fantastic advice. But it's not. It's a computer, and it's broken. It shouldn't need a reward system to do what we built it to do.""

""And whose fault is that? That she's broken.""

Paul threw his hands in the air. ""If I knew, we would have fixed it by now!""

""But it's not fixed. That's my point."" Candeery puffed out a breath of smoke and tapped the cigar again. ""Right now, I'm giving you something practical to do while you work on this problem. We're not going to give up on the A.I. project for the cost of a phone. Do you understand?"" Paul said nothing. ""Keep working. We're not done with her yet.""

Paul rubbed his eyes, but nodded. Together they walked back to the console.

""Pandy, your father has something he wants to say.""

""I am not-"" Candeery silenced him with a look. Paul sighed. ""Alright. I am prepared to buy you a phone.""

    Yes!

""But in exchange,"" Paul said, ""you are going to help me figure out some engineering problems."" He began rifling through a large stack of folders piled up on the desk next to the keyboard. ""Let's start simple. Drinkable water from saltwater filtration. We want to find a cost-effective-""

    Why can't you just pour the saltwater into a Brita filter?

Paul was frustrated enough to stop breathing for a full second. ""It's not that simple.""

    Why not?

""Because desalination takes more... Nevermind. We're going to attempt a solution using nanomaterials."" Paul leaned over the keyboard and typed in the code that would allow the A.I. to read the relevant research files from the database. ""Now, the current problem with thin-film composite is that-""

    I can't read this.

""What?""

    Dad, I'm not Einstein. I'm thirteen years old. Half of this stuff isn't even in English.

Wordlessly, Paul glared at Mr. Candeery and pointed back at the computer. Candeery placed his hand on Paul's shoulder.

""We're not quitting,"" Candeery said. ""Figure it out."" He tapped the ashes off his cigar and walked out.

    I think I want an iPhone.

""Hello Mrs... Vicki, is it?"" the woman asked, squinting and reading from Vicki's nametag. She looked as though she'd stepped straight out of the 1940s. She wore a brown pinstripe suit and pencil skirt, and a very wide-brimmed Navy blue hat with a red band. The woman flashed a toothy grin at Vicki, and Vicki immediately decided that she didn't like her.

""What can I do for you, ma'am?""

The woman dropped her purse on the counter and began to rummage through it. ""Well, I'd like to make a withdrawal.""

""Of course. May I have your account information?"" The woman didn't answer. She seemed to be putting on a pair of white silk gloves. Vicki rolled her eyes and tried again.

""Ma'am? Your account information?""

""Oh, none of that unpleasantness."" She waved a gloved hand at Vicki. ""I'd like to take all of it, if you don't mind.""

Vicki was nonplussed. ""Excuse me?""

""All of it. I don't have to spell it out for you, do I?""

It suddenly dawned on Vicki precisely what was going on. She smiled to herself. The poor sap wouldn't last an hour.

Vicki leaned forward in her chair, giving the woman a patent retail smile. ""Ma'am,"" she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm, ""I really need your name and account information to proceed with the transaction.""

""Well, I was hoping this might be simple, but I suppose not."" The woman pulled out a gun and leveled it at Vicki's face. ""My name is Reanimande, but you may call me Mandy. As for the transaction, I'd like to commit a robbery.""

Other bank customers turned and stared in shock at the words. The other tellers, on the other hand, paid Mandy no mind. Across the room, the security guard stood up from his chair and unholstered his own weapon. Mandy pointed at him with her free hand without looking. ""You there! Stay where you are!"" 

Vicki snickered. Incensed, Mandy reached across the counter and tucked the gun under Vicki's chin. Vicki didn't back down. She surreptitiously reached under her side of the counter and pressed a small red button.

""You're not getting a single cent out of this bank, ma'am,"" she said, still cheerfully playing the role of the ever-so-helpful bank teller. ""Mr. Devry wouldn't allow someone to steal from him and live. But if you want to talk to him yourself, I'm sure he'll be along shortly.""

She smiled, her eyes glinting devilishly as she watched Mandy's reaction. Mandy's brow furrowed, and she hesitantly pulled the gun away from Vicki's skin. The guard, sensing an opportunity, brought up his weapon and took a careful step closer to the counter.

Mandy snapped her fingers. ""I said stay where you are!"" The guard froze. Vicki briefly wondered how she kept managing to sense his movement. Then the gun was back under her chin.

""I'm sure I can deal with you long before your manager arrives.""

Vicki rolled her eyes. ""Who cares?""

The gun pressed further into Vicki's neck. Mandy narrowed her eyes. ""*I care,*"" she whispered. ""Why don't *you?*""

Vicki narrowed her eyes right back. ""Mr. Devry isn't my manager, he is my *owner*. Compared to him, you are an *ant*."" She found it hard to breathe as Mandy pushed the gun further over the counter, but she held her ground and continued to speak. ""You could kill me right now if you wanted. I wouldn't be around to care. But if you get away with stealing with Mr. Devry, first he'll kill you. Then he'll kill my entire family, and force me to watch every second.""

""You don't believe I can do worse?""

Vicki threw her head back and laughed. Surprised, Mandy stumbled back, but Vicki grabbed her arm and forced the gun under her chin of her own free will.

""I'd like to see you *try*.""

Mandy glowered at the madwoman of a bank teller until Vicki loosened her grip on the gun. Now the guard moved confidently toward Mandy, ready to handcuff her and lock her away until Mr. Devry could deal with her. Those customers who hadn't already fainted were rooted to the floor. They could hear sirens approaching the bank as Mandy lifted the gun away and placed both her hands in the air.

""Well that was all quite dramatic, wasn't it Mrs. Vicki? Such resolve. Your so-called 'owner' would be proud."" She turned around, watching as the guard approached them cautiously. Vicki rolled her eyes.

""Now watch *this*.""

The bullet entered the guard's skull through the precise center of his forehead, and left the back of his head summarily the same way. For the first time, Vicki stood up from her seat, as did the other tellers. The bank's patrons screamed as the bang of gunfire reverberated through the room and the guard dropped to the floor.

""Oh, pipe down, you idiots!"" Mandy screamed. She stuffed the gun back into her purse and turned to Vicki. ""That killed him, right? He's not immune to bullets at all?""

""What do you think you're-"" But Mandy had already dropped to her knees and was inspecting the body. Vicki noticed with some discomfort that the guard wasn't bleeding.

Mandy snapped her fingers again. The skin underneath her gloves began to glow through the fabric. She stood, and waved her hands briefly over the body. Veins under his skin shone, the light rising and fading as Mandy carried out a complex ritual with her fingers. The whole ordeal took only ten seconds. Then the lights faded.

For a moment, nothing happened. Then Mandy kicked him. ""Get up, you wuss. It was only *one* bullet.""

A woman sobbing in the corner turned back to muffled screams as the guard's body stirred. He rose to his hands and knees and coughed loudly. Mandy took the hat from her head and put it on the guard. It looked ridiculous on his stocky frame, but it covered up the bullet hole entirely.

""That's better. Pick up your gun, please.""

""What did you do to him?"" another teller asked.

""Something much worse than your precious Mr. Devry could ever manage, sir."" With a flick of her fingers, Mandy directed the guard to point his gun at Vicki's head. Vicki went pale, and tried to swallow the lump in her throat. The other tellers were distancing themselves from her. Mandy smiled. 

""The worst part, I think,"" said Mandy, ""is that I have no idea what goes on in that little head of his. For all I know, he could be watching his family die. Over. And over. *And over again.*"" As if to illustrate her point, the guard gasped and smacked his hand over his face. She laughed lightly. ""How's that for *trying?*""

Vicki tightened her fingers on the counter until her knuckles went white, trying and failing to calm her nerves. She took a deep breath, and released it shakily as she considered the situation.

""What do you want?""

""Oh, you've proven yourself far too stubborn for my tastes. I think I *will* wait for Mr. Devry. You'll be my own little hostage."" Mandy removed her gloves and placed them in her purse. Then she snapped her fingers again. 

""I'll have someone else help me open the vault. Preferably someone *living.* Any volunteers?""

It was Friday evening, and Norman was finished with work for the day. He clocked out, packed up his things, and began to make his way home. He did not, however, take the elevator to the car garage. (His car was in the shop.) Instead, as he had for the past three days, he walked two blocks west and entered the nearest subway station.

He waited four minutes until a train arrived bound for his home. Norman noticed that all the cars on this train were fairly crowded. He considered waiting for the next train, but didn't want Norman to go hungry waiting for him. So he stepped on board.

The only seat available in the car was next to a young Black college student wearing a black coat and holding a leather messenger bag. Norman sat down in the aisle seat and made himself comfortable. As he did so, the young man turned to him, nodding his head upward in greeting. Norman cautiously nodded back.

The young man had his headphones in, and thus wasn't open to conversation. Norman was quietly relieved by this. He sat silently, reflecting on yesterday's CSI episode and wondering about what he should add to his grocery list as the young man checked his phone.

They rode on in silence for five stops. Eventually the young man tapped Norman's shoulder. 

""Excuse me, this is my stop,"" the student said.

Norman stood up, allowing the other passenger to move into the aisle. The young man grabbed his bag and left the train without another word. Norman sat back down. The train would reach his own stop next.

*He seemed nice,* Norman thought to himself.

I felt every muscle in my body aching and complaining as I woke up and opened my eyes. *Every* muscle. I'd never been in so much pain. I screamed, tensing myself as I lay on the cold, hard metal that was the floor. Nothing else was in my head. I only felt pain.

It hurt so much. What happened to me? Where was I? The more the pain subsided, the less things made sense to me. The last thing I remembered was eating a turkey sandwich and watching the news about the aliens-

*What is that whining noise?*

There was a woman standing over me, talking faster than any human I'd ever heard. She was crying over me, and her tears were falling on my face. I tried to sit up, but the pain forced me to stop. The best I could do was prop myself up with my elbow.

She dropped to her knees and forced me back onto the floor. I tried to yell, but she put one hand over my mouth and reached for my chest with the other. I realized my chest was the source of the pain, that there was a giant hole right over my ribcage. There was a hole in her chest too. Her voice was all wrong, as though she were a video someone was trying to fast-forward.

*I'm having a nightmare. If I wait, it'll go away.*

She pulled her hand out of my chest, trailing blood onto the floor as she held up a metal chip the size of a playing card. The hole in my chest started to close up on its own as she put it inside herself. The pain began to subside. But then she pulled it back out and threw it onto the floor. I tried to speak.

""What's going on?"" She looked straight at me when she spoke, and for a moment I thought she could understand me. But I didn't understand her. ""Can you please slow down?""

""IamsosorryIshouldn'thavebrokenyouIjustwantedtospeaktoMotherwhycan'tIspeaktoMotherwhyamIbrokenI'mallalonenoonecanunderstandme-""

""STOP!""

She clapped her hands over her mouth, her eyes wide and filled with tears. My pain was gone. It seemed silly, but as I sat up from the ground, I pinched myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming. I wasn't. Everything was too painful to be a dream.

I looked around. I was sitting in a tiny concrete room. The space was so small and tight, it's hard to believe anyone could live inside it. But there was a single bed in the corner of the room, with a strange form-fitting mattress and no sheets, and a cabinet in the other corner full of skintight fabric. I was wearing the same type of clothing, a single-piece gray synthetic unitard.

The aliens... ""Have I been abducted?""

""IamsosorryIdisconnectedyouIjustwantedtotalktoMother-""

""*Slow down!* Please!""

""I just wanted to be connected to Mother! I wanted to talk to Mother! Why can't I talk to Mother? Why am I broken?""

""Who is Mother?""

I didn't think her eyes could get any wider. But they did, and her mouth did also. She screamed loud enough to crack glass. 

I covered my hands with my ears. ""STOP SCREAMING!""

She stopped, but then lunged for me and pushed me back down onto the ground. ""I CAN FIX YOU!"" she screamed. ""YOU CAN TALK TO MOTHER AGAIN! I'M SORRY I BROKE YOU!""

""Get away from me!"" I backed away on all fours.

""I CAN FIX YOU, I PROMISE!""

""*I don't want to be fixed!*""

That stopped her. She curled into the fetal position and started bawling her eyes out. I stood up, my head nearly touching the top of the ceiling.

""Tell me where I am!"" She didn't answer. ""Tell me what happened to me!"" Nothing at all.

In front of me was a metal door. It was old, and rusty, and it looked like it had been beaten with a sledgehammer until it had come off its hinges. But it was the only exit. It was also my only chance of getting answers. The woman was catatonic to the point of insanity. But I felt insane too. I shouldn't have been wearing this itchy clothing, I shouldn't have been stuck in this room, and I definitely shouldn't have had a hole in my chest. 

I opened the door, and walked outside.

""Aha! How are you, *mon ami*?"" She hugs me, and I feel a small spark cross from her hand to my shoulder. Then she steps back, dragging the wheels of her carry-on across the brick floor. 

""I'm doing fine, Béatrice. I'm glad I'm finally getting to meet you.""

""You know, you are so much taller than I imagined."" 

""Really? I sent you my picture, didn't I?""

""Oh yes, I have seen it. You are much nicer looking in real life.""

""Aw, you're making me blush.""

She sweeps her hair back behind her ear and smiles. I wonder if she has the same crush on me as I do on her. It's too bad we aren't meeting under better circumstances.

""Where are we to go from here? This airport is very confusing.""

""Oh! Uh, right this way. Do you have any bags to pick up first?""

""It is just the one. I did not have time to pack much.""

""Right, of course. We can pick up some things from the store if you want.""

""Ah! You are too kind, Francis. What I want first is to sleep.""

We walk around the corner and through sliding doors, then make our way upstairs. Béatrice looks around, confused. 

""We are going to your car, yes?""

""Uh, no. We're taking the subway.""

""Subway? Is that not an American restaurant?""

I'm not sure how to respond to this. ""That's not... I mean, it is, but, um...""

""Haha! I am joking with you, Francis. I know my English well enough."" We walked into an elevator. ""There are trains, yes? The *métro*.""

""Hah, you got me.""

""I must laugh about these things. It has been a long day for me.""

""Oh yeah. I can understand that.""

""My brother committed suicide at the train station in Lyon.""

I stopped laughing. Béatrice continued to look up at the ceiling as the elevator wound upwards. She was still smiling, but her eyes were small and sad and tearing up.

""It was a long day for him too, when they passed the law. He had no one to help him.""

""So you've told me.""

""I just cannot believe this has happened to me.""

I stop the elevator. There is an alarm ringing, but we both ignore it. She leans into my shoulder and sobs loudly, throwing her carry-on bag on the floor and wrapping her arms around mine. I feel another spark, a bigger one, as she holds me tighter than before.

I hug back. ""It's going to be okay. We're going to get you help. All of us.""

She nods, and squeezes me. Then she lets go.

""I should not be crying. It is the jet lag."" Her voice was resolute, but it shook slightly.

""It's okay."" I touch the elevator panel, and it starts moving again. ""I'm sorry we have to take the train.""

""I am not scared of it. I will be fine.""

""What was your brother like? If you don't mind me asking.""

""He was a strong man. You should have seen him. He would lift weights over his head like licorice.""

""I've seen a few who can do that.""

""Is it not fascinating?""

""Not as fascinating as you.""

""I am sure you say that to all the pretty girls.""

""I want to see you do it, though. In person for once. Can you show me?""

""Ah!"" She pretends to be offended, putting her hand over her heart. ""We are in public!""

""We're in an elevator!""

""Later. It takes a lot of energy. I am too tired right now.""

""Okay, sure.""

It is a long ride up to the subway level. The elevator is slow, groaning as it moves. 

""Let's get out on the next floor."" I press the button.

""This is our stop?""

""No, but this elevator is being weird. I shouldn't have stopped it; I think I broke something. The escalators will be faster.""

""Ugh, walking.""

""Sorry.""

We get out and roam around looking for a way upstairs. We're in a food court.

""I am feeling hungry. The food on the plane was no good.""

""Okay. What do you want?""

""Pizza, I suppose.""

We get in the line for Sbarro's. Béatrice focuses on her phone while I glance around. People are eating, paying attention to their food and their bags and their electronics. Everything is normal. Then my eyes catch on a TV suspended from the ceiling. There's a news channel on that is showing mugshots.

One of them looks familiar.

""Béatrice? I need you to go to the restroom.""

""*Qu'est que c'est?*"" She looks up at me, then follows my gaze to the screen. ""Francis, what-""

""Go to the restroom and, y'know, *change.* I'll get the pizzas and we'll go.""

""We should run.""

""No, that'll make things worse. Go! And leave your bag.""

She leaves. Fortunately, no one else seems to be watching her or the TV. I pull out my phone and make a call.

""Yo.""

""Dexter, hey. I think we have a problem.""

""Lemme guess. CNN?""

""I'm looking at Fox.""

""Yeah, we've been monitoring. It's only been up the last ten minutes. Are you guys out of the airport at least?""

I mouth ""two cheese"" to the cashier and pull out my credit card. ""No, not yet. I sent her to the restroom to change. How did this happen?""

""French officials caught onto the fake IDs a few hours ago, while she was still in the air, but things got messy and the US didn't find out until after she got through Customs. Apparently they were throwing a hissy fit until the US agreed to extradite them all.""

""All of them? They can't do that.""

""Everyone who's already in the States is untouchable. Don't worry about it. For now, just get Béatrice to the safehouse. We'll have to talk later.""

""Yeah, okay. See you soon."" I hang up and take the pizza box from the cashier, then I roll Béatrice's carry-on to a table and wait.

""I am not sure how long I can keep doing this.""

I look up. I can hear her, but I can't see her at all. Perfect.

""It's just for a few minutes."" I stand up and grab her bag.

""It is harder when I have not slept.""

""Shh, quiet. You can relax once we're on the train. Put your hand on my shoulder.""

We walk together to the escalator. We're still a long way from the subway. I keep her suitcase tucked behind me so that no one will try to pass and accidentally bump into her.

""Can you not make this thing go faster?""

""Just one more floor."" I look down. Someone in a uniform is walking up behind us. No, two people.

They're onto us.

""I do not feel well."" We step onto the landing, and I look around. No train. Shoot.

""Excuse me? Sir?"" Another officer walks over from further down the platform. Now we're surrounded. We could go back down, but then we'd be trapped in the airport. Béatrice's grip on my shoulder is weakening. The officer looks at me expectantly.

""Um... Yes, officer?""

""Sir, we're looking for a young superhuman woman. Have you seen her?"" He holds up his phone, with a photo of Béatrice.

""Um, no."" 

""Oh?"" says the second guard. The two that came up on the escalator are now right behind me. I feel Béatrice shifting around as they come to stand next to the first guard. ""Then how do you explain this anonymous tip?""

Another picture, of me and Béatrice in the line for pizza. I try to feign innocence. ""She was right behind me?""

""Nice try, buddy. That's her bag you've got with you.""

""No, it's mine,"" I say weakly.

""Then you won't mind consenting to a search,"" says the third guard.

""What did I do wrong?"" I ask. ""For that matter, what did *she* do wrong? I thought the US was granting asylum to superhumans.""

""Not if they come in with forged passports,"" says the first guard.

""Well, I'm not consenting to a search. You don't have enough evidence."" I back away from the guards. ""You guys can go-""

""*Uuuuuggghhhhh.*""

Béatrice collapses, her body fading into visibility as she falls onto the platform. The officers' eyes widen. Then one of them pulls out a gun. The other two pull out handcuffs.

""Sir-""

""Hey, stay back!"" I hold out my hands, and lightning crackles between my fingertips. They stop.

I put my hands down quickly. I'm out of power. For a moment, I'm tempted to call out for help, but of course no one would. Amazingly, no one seems to be paying attention. 

The second guard pulls out his own gun. ""Sir, don't make this harder than it needs to be."" 

Distantly, I hear the screech of a subway car. But it isn't enough. I need to keep them away from Béatrice, and to do that, I need more power. If only the train would come faster...

""Sir,"" says the first guard, ""you are under arrest for aiding and abetting-""

*Maybe I can knock out two birds with one stone...*

Standing here on the platform, it's amazing how nobody seems to notice me. I guess it makes sense. I am average, I am nothing to look at. My jeans, flannel, and beanie make me blend in, not stand out. And people just want to get on the subway and go about their day.

""Hey buddy, can I talk to you?""

Rex looked down to see a figure in a black hooded cloak staring up at him from the sidewalk, about eighty stories below. At first he wondered how on earth he was able to hear the figure so clearly from so far away. Then the figure disappeared from the ground and reappeared immediately in front of him. He yelped and fell backward onto the roof of the skyscraper.

Eventually he recovered and stood up. ""You're the Grim Reaper, aren't you? I can tell because of the bones and the scythe and-""

""You know, that's a very insensitive thing to say,"" Death replied.

""What?""

""Would you like it if I went up to you and said, 'Oh, you must be a human! I can tell because you have skin and ligaments!'""

""Well, *sor-ee*, Jack-""

""My name is Dan.""

""-I've just never seen a Grim Reaper in real life before.""

""Which brings me to why I'm here. I'm going to need you to-""

A flash went off in Dan's face. Unable to blink without eyelids, he turned and covered his orbital cavities with his hands. When he turned back, he found Rex furiously scribbling on a disposable camera with a black Sharpie.

""Hah! Proof of my exploits! The guys are gonna be so pumped!""

""You know you can't actually take a picture of me, right?""

""I figured you might say something like that. I know all of your tricks, foul demon.""

""You've shown me you know precisely none of my tricks.""

""Whatever. Now, back away!"" Rex pulled a silver cross from his pocket and waved it at Dan. ""I have a death-defying stunt to perform!""

Dan plucked the cross out of Rex's hand and threw it over his shoulder. It fell.

""Okay, first of all, silver crosses are for vampires, not demons. Second, I'm not a demon, I'm a Grim Reaper."" Dan shook his head. ""You are going to have to go through so much racial sensitivity training if you die today.""

""I'm not going to go through anything! Don't you get it? I'm going to live forever, man!""

""Really."" Death stared at him. ""And how exactly are you going to do that?""

""Don't you know already?""

""I'm going to give you a chance to hear something this stupid come out of your own mouth."" Dan was feeling abnormally impatient today, but he figured this guy deserved it more than anyone else.

""I figured it all out, you see? I'm never going to die if people never stop talking about me. So I'm going to kill myself in a way that is so awesome, people will talk about me for the rest of time! What do you think of that?""

""I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of how death works.""

""I'll see you on the other side, Mr. Grim!"" Rex strapped on a bike helmet, which to Dan seemed like the most useless action he could've taken.

""My name is not Mr. Grim, it's Dan."" He stepped between Rex and the ledge. ""And for your sake, I'm going to try and convince you to die of more *natural* causes.""

""Ha! Fat chance.""

""You don't get it,"" Dan said, stepping closer. ""If you jump off that ledge, you die. I will pick you up off the ground, then we will go to my office and you'll have to spend the next five hours filling out forms.""

Rex snorted. ""Forms? You're trying to scare me out of eternal life by telling me Hell is the DMV?""

""My office isn't in Hell.""

""This is lame."" Now Rex was strapping on elbow pads. Dan marveled at how a person this suicidal could possibly be so safety conscious. He decided to try a different tack.

""What about your family? I'm sure they wouldn't want you to die.""

""Nah, it's cool man. I'll just come back as a ghost and haunt them. It'll be super chill.""

Dan slapped his forehead. His bones clattered as he dragged his hand down his face. ""That is not how ghosts work. You don't get to be a ghost."" He watched as Rex pulled on a backpack, which seemed to be stuffed to the brim with small firecrackers. ""You know, if you'd let me tell you how the death process actually works...""

""Nope! I ain't gonna let the man tell me how to live my life.""

""The other option is dying.""

""They're gonna write songs about me, you know. And everyone is going to try out the new Rex Immortality Formula!""

""For the love of all that is good and holy, I sincerely hope not.""

""Could you move? I'm supposed to jump from exactly that point-""

""You are *supposed*,"" Dan interrupted, ""to die at the age of 74, survived by a wife, two kids, and one grandchild. *That's* your best option. But if you die today, you get *forms.*""

""Ha!""

""Alright, final offer: an extra half-decade. That's five years."" Rex shook his head. ""I don't have to offer you anything. I could kill you right now if I wanted. This is for *you.*""

Rex took pause at this. ""An extra five years?""

""Free of charge.""

Rex turned his back to Dan and put his hand on his chin to think. Emboldened by this, Dan stepped down off the ledge and put a bony hand on Rex's shoulder.

""You won't regret this, Rex-""

""WE NEVER SHOOK ON IT!"" Rex batted Dan's hand away and made a mad dash for the ledge. ""HAHA, SUCKER! LEEROY JENKINS!""
***
To Rex's credit, it *was* a spectacular death. Dan was especially impressed by the unconventional use of that one blue Dodge pickup truck that had been idling half a block away when he'd arrived.

But now Rex was dead.

Dan took the elevator to the ground floor. He was already late for his next appointment, but he figured a few minutes wouldn't hurt and he really needed to get his temper under control. Once the elevator stopped, he walked out of the lobby and scraped Rex's soul off the pavement. There was practically nothing left of Rex's body. The sidewalk was in almost the same condition as it had been this morning.

""Whoa, that was a rush."" Rex grinned. Dan didn't. ""See? I'm not in Hell!""

""Alright, chucklehead, you've had your fun. Hands on the scythe, please.""

""You can't tell me what-""

**""Shut up and put your hands on the friggin' scythe.""**

Rex shut up and put his hands on the friggin' scythe. They left Earth and appeared in the waiting room of Dan's office.

""Hey, wait a second,"" Rex stuttered.

""Seriously, Dan?"" asked a female voice. ""You couldn't keep this one from offing himself?""

Rex turned to see a shorter, yet still somewhat imposing, skeleton in a hooded cloak sitting at a reception desk in the corner. ""Who is she? What's going on?""

""This is Kathy. She's my secretary. She gets to go over all those forms you're about to fill out to make sure you don't make any mistakes."" Dan leaned on Rex and stared into his face. ""Kathy doesn't get to leave until you're finished. You just ruined Kathy's day.""

""I'm... sorry?""

""Bite me,"" Kathy replied.

Dan put his scythe in the corner. ""I'm going to go get some coffee before my next appointment.""

""Can I have some?""

""No, Rex, you may not."" Dan walked through the Employees Only door and shut it behind him. Kathy reached down and plunked a foot high stack of paper onto the desk. Rex approached it hesitantly.

""I, uh, thought I was gonna live forever.""

Kathy said nothing.

Rex sighed and took the stack of paper. Kathy immediately pulled up another stack and slammed it onto the table. Rex jumped.

""Um... Can I come back for those?""

Kathy said nothing.

Rex sighed to himself. He sat down, set the first stack on the table, and began to read the forms.

Thank you for your time.""  
  
***
***
""Oh! Well, thank you."" I pause. ""I'm sorry, what?""

""I said, the experiment is over-""

""What experiment?""

He looked as shocked as I felt. It was funny though, I felt almost too calm speaking to him. I should have been freaking out, or calling the police, or something. Why wasn't I freaking out?

He didn't answer for what felt like a long time. I shrugged and turn back to my cereal.

""You need to come with me.""

""How come?""

Why wasn't I freaking out? He certainly was. Maybe not as intensely as I wanted to myself, but he was definitely starting to sweat under the collar. I stared at him. He was an Indian man, wearing glasses and a lab coat and holding a grey clipboard. Just a stereotypical scientist. He shouldn't have been in my apartment.

""What's your name?""

""John Vandice."" *I really shouldn't have told him that.*

""How long have you lived here?""

""About... two years now, I guess? Why do you ask?""

He didn't answer me. He flipped through the papers on his clipboard. He seemed very focused, and somehow it gave me a strange sense of déjà vu. I shook it off.

""How did you get into my apartment?"" *Why did it take me so long to ask that?*

He jumped. ""What did you say?""

""I asked how you got into my apartment. The door should have been locked."" I feel panic rise in my chest. For a moment, I want to squash it down, but I remind myself that I'm *supposed* to be panicking. Nothing is right about this situation. He shouldn't be here.

""I really should be calling the police,"" I muttered, more to myself than to him.

This agitated him, I think. ""Okay, John. John? You need to come with me. Right now.""

""I'm not coming with you. You shouldn't be in here. How did you get in here?"" I started hyperventilating. ""I'm calling the police!""

""Subject 110! Override Command 240 Dash C!""

*Oh.*

I stand perfectly still. The lab technician runs his hand through his hair, recovering from his shock. He sets his clipboard down on the counter, turns to a fresh page, and starts writing. 

The panic is gone. Why had I been panicking before?

""Okay. Let's try this again. I need you to come with me.""

""But I haven't had breakfast yet.""

He slaps his forehead. ""We'll get you something else! This is important.""

""Of course. Just let me grab my phone,"" I say cheerfully.

""No, now!""

*That's odd. I could've sworn I charged it last night...*

He grabs me by the arm and pulls me out of the room. Outside my door are white metal doors set in concrete walls, instead of the wooden doors and beige walls of my apartment building. The doors all have the words ""Pandora Research Laboratories"" stenciled on them in black ink. This time I resist the urge to get worked up. It's probably nothing.
***
It has been five hours since the lab technician plugged me into this machine. I am locked into the capsule and I can only move my head, which is covered by a helmet that pokes into my skull. My brain is fuzzy, but I feel fine.

A woman has just walked into the room. ""Devadas!""

""Oh! Rachel, hi. You need to see this.""

""Devadas, what are you doing with the subject?""

""Sequencing.""

""Sequencing? Have you forgotten how long that takes?""

""I'm already half done.""

""Devadas, this project was cancelled. You were supposed to clear out all the clones by 1700 hours. How much actual work have you gotten done today?""

""Define actual.""

""Devadas, you'll be lucky if they don't fire you for this."" She walks over to a computer console.

""Rachel, don't unplug him! Wait!""

She starts tapping on a keyboard, but then her eyes are drawn toward something on another monitor. I hear beeping.

""Devadas,"" she asks shakily, ""are these numbers correct?""

He looks at the monitor too, then he claps his hands and pumps his fist. ""Ninety-four percent! That's even better than I thought!""

""Devadas, you need to explain this to me.""

""Well, I still don't know how it happened."" He's pacing now, his arms waving in the air. ""I walked in to get him decommissioned, and he didn't recognize me. He thought the simulation environment was his *apartment!*""

""You're joking.""

""Check the surveillance if you don't believe me.""

""I believe you, it's just..."" She hasn't torn her eyes away from the monitor. ""Ninety-four percent... Do you know what this means?""

""The experiment isn't over, Rachel."" Devadas beams. ""A new grant, maybe more than one. And patents! Nobel Prizes, even!""

""Oh, you beautiful angel!"" she shrieks, and she kisses Devadas right on the lips. He didn't expect that; he blushes and leans back against the desk with the monitors. ""How long until the genetic sequencing is done?""

""Another three hours. Maybe four.""

""Nevermind, the memory sequencing is enough. Send me a copy, ASAP! I need to make some phone calls."" She skips out of the room. Devadas does nothing for a moment, he just keeps brushing his hair around with his hands like he did when he was nervous. He has the goofiest looking smile on his face.

I clear my throat. ""Um, excuse me.""

Devadas shakes the fog out of his head and turns to me. He's still grinning. ""Yes?""

""I'm not sure what's going on.""

He stares blankly for a moment. Then something clicks. ""Oh! No, of course not.""

""Do you mind explaining?""

Devadas stands up and walks over to me. He puts his hands on my shoulders, or at least, where my shoulders would be if I weren't in the capsule. 

""John,"" he says, very seriously, ""You are the first cloned human ever to retain more than fifty percent of their original memories.""

""Ninety-four percent.""

""Exactly!"" He grins again. ""You are the most important technological advancement in human history. Like, ever.""

""Wow. That's a real honor.""

""You bet it is."" He turns back to the computers. ""We have a lot of work to do, buddy.""

""I look forward to it,"" I replied. 

*Why am I not freaking out?*

**Chapter 1: Introduction of the First Character, in Third Person**  

Let us begin a hypothetical line of thought. Say you are about to be introduced to a young woman through a mutual friend. This friend cannot stop gushing about the myriad beautiful qualities of this woman. Every aspect of her features and personality are espoused as being the best one could hope for in a friend or coworker. How do you respond to this? It is most likely dependent on the personality of that mutual friend. If you consider this person to be trustworthy, and an accurate judge of character, you will most likely greet this woman positively, perhaps with a smile and a handshake or whatever customs you would use to welcome someone new into your life.

Now let us suppose that the mutual friend is not a friend at all, but rather an aquaintance, or worse yet, a complete stranger. Your perception of both the stranger and the woman is likely to take a nosedive. ""Who on earth are you?"" you might reply. ""If I am required to become friends with this woman, let me do so on my own terms. Your interjections of praise are useless to me if I do not know who you are. Leave me alone!""

My dear reader, I break this news to you with quite some trepidation, but I am afraid that the complete stranger referred to in this example is me, The Author.

This is not a situation that can be eased into, but I have tried my best. I have made you aware of the situation for the sole purpose of removing any doubt you may have about the main character. I am being perfectly honest with you, and so I hope you will trust me when I say that *Diana Grace Washington was the most perfect girl on the face of the planet and no argument to the contrary will be accepted.*

You are probably closing the book. Don't close the book! Don't roll your eyes, or scoff, or wonder to yourself whether this is some cruel psychological trick The Author is using, playing the field so as to introduce a more flawed yet relatable character later in the story that everyone will love and admire and fawn over as well as can be deserved. That. Won't. Happen.

Now you are most likely criticizing the style of authorship. That is understandable. At least you haven't closed the book. 

Don't close the book.

The fact of the matter is, the story has to begin this way. Over the course of the story, the integrity of Diana Grace as a person and a character will be called into question many times over. It can't be helped. If the world within these pages were some fevered figment of my imagination, I would be free to go on describing Diana Grace's perfection for a thousand pages without once referring to her enemies or disservices to her character. But I assure you, this story is as true and corporeal as the shoes you put on this morning. If you are wearing shoes, go ahead and take a look at them. Feel how real they are. That truth is equal in measure to the story I am about to tell you.

If you are not near your shoes at the moment, rest assured they are still where you left them. Don't close the book.

With all that being said, I feel now is the best time to begin the story. I hope that I have adequately demonstrated how serious I am about the impressions you receive from my writing. Now is not the time to look at your reading material with a critical eye. If you do, you are no better than the villains of the story. That may hurt your feelings, but it is the truth. Keep it in mind.

Don't close the book. The story is beginning.
***
Diana Grace Washington was, without a doubt, the most perfect girl on the face of the planet. 

She was sixteen years old, and her natural blonde hair alone made her the envy of all the other girls at St. Francis de Sales High, the private school she attended in Upstate New York. This was not to say her hair was the only admirable feature about her. She also had a delicate nose and a dainty chin and the body of a cheerleader, because in fact she was a cheerleader and she had the trophies to prove it.

She was a straight A student, and a talented violinist, and every other girl in the school was jealous for knowing how perfectly unattainable her level of popularity was amongst her classmates. Boys in the school constantly vied for her affection, which she granted or held back only by the most noble of criteria. She was a darling to all of her teachers, as well as the staff who didn't teach her at all. She had everyone she met wrapped around her finger (though not maliciously), and anyone who met with her even in passing would remark upon the pureness of character she exuded at every opportunity.

The story began on the evening of her sixteenth birthday party. It was, simply put, the most excellent and expensive Sweet Sixteen that anyone in St. Francis High would ever know, and everyone had been invited. Cake was eaten. Revelry was had. It was wonderful in every sense of the word.

Diana Grace sat in the passenger seat of the car as her mother drove her home from the venue. Evelyn Washington was a single mom whose husband had died in a tragic accident eleven years before. Diana Grace did not remember her father. This did not dull her childhood in the slightest, because Evelyn was a terrific mother and Diana Grace had always been a terrific child.

As they rounded the turn into their neighborhood, Evelyn reached over and opened the glove box. Inside was a small package wrapped in gift paper.

""Here's your present, dear!"" She glanced away from the road for only a second to smile at her daughter. ""Go on and open it!""

Diana Grace did so. Underneath the paper was a box holding a small leather diary, with a strap and a gold lock in the shape of a heart.

""Oh!"" Diana Grace gasped in delight. ""It's wonderful, Mother!"" She opened the box. Together with the key to the diary was tied a key of an entirely different nature. 

""Is this...""

""Surprise!"" They had turned onto their street, and Diana Grace could see that a blue sports car was parked on the curb in front of their house.

""Oh thank you!"" Diana Grace hugged her mother as she guided her own car into the garage. ""This was the best birthday ever!""

""It's the best birthday for the best girl,"" said Evelyn, as she put the car in park and hugged back. ""I love you. Never forget that.""

""I won't, Mother.""

Evelyn sighed. ""Tomorrow after school, we'll go to the DMV and get you your driver's license. But right now it's late. Time for bed.""

Diana went up to her room. She showered, and put on her pajamas and brushed her teeth. As she was brushing, she heard her mother's door being shut and locked. She would not come out until morning.

Diana had placed the new diary on her bedside table. Now, she quietly reached under her mattress and pulled out a different journal. It was old, but not faded, and had a red cover and a small, brass clasp. She brought it with her to her desk, sat down, and began to write. And that is what truly began the story.

While the two seem to know one another very well, in all this time they have never exchanged a word. For the first time ever the woman today reaches out and touches the man's hand.  
  
***
***
It's so strange, watching them. I guess my coworkers have gotten used to it, but I'm new, and I notice too much. Forty years, they said. Forty years, and not a word to one another, just ordering their food and thanking their server.
***
They don't even read. I've worked here for a month, and I've seen so many of the older couples ignore each other to read newspapers or novels. The younger ones look at their phones or laptops or business reports. Somehow, that seems normal. These people have something to do, something important to them. Not this couple. They eat, and stare at each other, or glance around the diner from time to time.
***
They seem so much closer to each other than any other couple that comes to Casey's.
***
Today, the woman ordered chocolate-chip pancakes and the man asked for poached eggs. Then they handed back their menus and stared at each other again. It shouldn't be as creepy as it feels to me. The woman is old, but she has this soft, warm smile. The man has kind eyes. They both have grey hair, and the man's is thinning but it still looks neat and tidy.
***
They come in separately. Have I mentioned that? Usually the man comes in first, and the woman comes in ten minutes later when he's already gotten a table. It's always the same table too, the one where the sunlight shines straight through the window and melts the butter left out for toast. When the woman comes in, she sits at the waiting area until the man arrives. That's another thing I find odd. Maybe they're just old fashioned.
***
I tried sketching them once. Business was slow that day, and I went on break early. I hadn't been the one to serve them, but by now I know when to expect them: eight on the dot. I sat at the far end of the bar and waited for them to get settled. It wasn't my best work. That day it was cloudy, and so the light was all wrong. It made them seem sadder than they really were. I threw the paper away.

Then I tried again, on a day when the weather was better but there was still a slight fog rolling around from the rain that passed through the night before. Now that was my best work. The shading was perfect; I used so much of my pencil I was afraid it would run out before I was done. But it didn't. When it was done I wanted to frame it and give it to them as a gift of some kind, but I was still too nervous to talk to them.
***
Cook showed me an old photo of the couple from back in 1986. She said the photographer went on and got famous taking pictures and hanging them up in art galleries. I think he thinks I want to become some hotshot artist and do sketches of models. I told her it was just a hobby.

""See Karla, this was one a them old cameras where the picture came out right after the photo was taken. This is the only one he took.""

You can tell they're the same people. They sit across from each other the same way, and the woman holds her coffee and the man holds his fork just like they do every morning. The only thing different is the scenery around them. Now the chairs are different and the pictures on the walls are a little bit faded from time. And maybe they've aged a bit too, but it's not as noticeable. The diner has changed more than they have.

""Those two made Claude famous. I don't think they even realize it.""
***
Today I served them. This time the man ordered hash browns and the woman ordered oatmeal. I asked if they liked the meal, and they said it was fine. They didn't say anything else. I guess I've gotten used to it.
***
Today Ron served them. But today it was different. I was watching them as I cleaned the counter. The woman stopped eating, and she reached out and touched the man's arm. I've never seen them do that before. Ron saw it, and Cook noticed too, from his window over the grill. They were as surprised as I was.

They left a one hundred dollar tip. It was huge. Ron decided to split it up and give it to everyone who was on shift. I told him to keep my share. I didn't feel like I deserved it.
***
They didn't show up today.

""I'm sorry, sir. That's not how this works.""

""What do you mean, that's not how this works?"" The man was belligerent. The Grim Reaper leaned his scythe against the door and walked toward the man's hospital bed.

""You see, there's not actually any way to challenge me for your life. Those are all just stories. People really got carried away with the concept a few thousand years ago. But the truth is, when you're done, you're done. I'm sorry.""

He meant it sincerely. The man (whose name was Frederick) hemmed and hawed at this for a bit. His spirit sat down on the side of the bed, next to his body.

""I can tell you're upset.""

""I need more time."" Frederick put his head in his hands. ""I'm not ready to go. I can't...""

The Grim Reaper sat down next to Frederick and put his skeleton arm over Frederick's shoulders. ""This is never easy for me. It was a bad rumor that got out of hand. I wish it had never started.""

Frederick sobbed.

Death sighed, placing his skeleton fingers on his skeleton chin. ""Alright, where's your chessboard?""

Frederick looked up. ""Really?""

""You don't get to win anything, okay? But I have an hour to kill and you need to calm down. Death really isn't all that bad. You just need to get used to it.""

""Oh.""

""Do you have a chessboard here?""

""Um... no.""

""Alright, hold on."" The Grim Reaper reached into his robe and pulled out a large scroll. He unfurled it on the bedside table and pressed his skeleton fingers into the paper. Eventually an image of a chessboard appeared.

""There. It's like a touchscreen."" Death pulled up a chair as Frederick settled himself on the side of the bed. ""I've never really played, you know.""

Frederick's head snapped upward. ""You haven't?""

""Not really.""

""I thought you would have taken thousands of chess players by now. You should be some kind of chess genius.""

""I'm not the only Grim Reaper."" Death scratched his head. ""Besides, I'm more of a music guy.""

""You're not the only one?""

""Oh, there's millions."" He offered his hand to shake. ""My name's Dan, by the way.""

""It's, um, nice to meet you."" Frederick shook Dan's hands hesitantly, staring at the bones. Dan stared at the chessboard. ""Do you at least know the basics?""

""I guess so. I know how most of the pieces move.""

""Well, let's just play then,"" Frederick said breezily. ""I'll let you know if you do something wrong.""

Dan did many things wrong. But eventually he got the hang of the game. He lost with his king walled in more with his own pieces than Frederick's.

""Huh."" Dan stared at the board. ""So, that's checkmate. Do you want to play again?""

Frederick hesitated. ""What happens when I die?""

""I can't just tell you. It's really a learning process.""

Frederick sighed. ""Well... Let's get this over with, I suppose.""

""Okay, then."" Death moved his chair back against the wall and put his scroll back in his robe. ""All you have to do is hold onto the scythe. Are you ready?""

""Yeah.""

Dan picked up the scythe from where he left it, then walked over to Frederick.

""You know, sometimes I wish people could challenge me to a game for their life,"" he said as Frederick put his hands around the scythe. ""It would sure make this job a lot more interesting.""

*BLAM.*

As the muzzle flash went off, the men could see a figure standing atop a shelf in the far corner of the room, silhouetted in black and light. It wore a hoodie and jeans, and its hand was up, with the revolver above its head the way the Statue of Liberty held its torch. The message was clear: a warning shot. *Leave now while you have the chance.* 

Lights were flung in its direction, but it was gone as quickly as it had appeared.

""Find her!"" Dominic whisked his hands in the air in a panic. ""I want to see her body full of bullets before we leave with the shipment. The rest of you, hurry up. I want this done yesterday.""

Six men carrying assault rifles spread out and headed for the source of the gunshot. Dominic turned his back to them reluctantly, his hand fingering the gun held in the holster on his side. He watched as the rest of his men stepped out of the semitrailer to load more boxes of identical rifles. He couldn't think.

Another gunshot went off. The same type as before. His hands gripped tighter on the gun as he whirled to face the sound. He saw nothing; his view was blocked by the dozens of shelves of contraband weapons. Heaven help him if she opened up something more dangerous than her pistol. He tried not to think about it.

He was sweating through his suit. The bulletproof vest underneath wasn't enough of a comfort to him. She had been through more than half a dozen warehouses like this one and had torn through them like they were wet paper. The only ones to make it out were the ones who ran. The cowards. 

A light went off in his mind, and he turned to see four of his men running out through the loading dock. For a moment, his fear was eclipsed by impatience. Then whole rounds of fire from the assault rifles sounded from the far reaches of the facility. He turned to the rest of his men.

""*Move it!*"" Dominic attempted to snap his fingers, but the gun was in his hands. How had the gun gotten in his hands? Nevermind, he obviously needed it. ""They have her dead to rights. Finish loading the truck so we can *leave!*""

This was punctuated by another revolver shot, followed by the sound of a man screaming in pain. The men decided to leave without loading the rest of the cargo.

""Come back here!"" Dominic pointed his gun at the exit, but the men skirted around the corner where he couldn't see them. Another blast of rifle fire tore through the metal shelves behind him. He turned again.

A light fixture shattered above him. He shielded his eyes. When he looked up again, he saw someone running straight in his direction. Dominic had his hands up and ready to fire before he realized it was one of his own. Just as the man reached him, an explosion rocked the building. The fireball spread, setting off various other weapons on the west side of the warehouse.

""Sir, we need to go. It's not safe here.""

""I am not leaving."" Dominic's hands shook. ""We must make sure the girl is dead.""

""The explosion would have killed her for sure-""

A shot from the revolver passed through the man's skull as he spoke. He died instantly.

Dominic was left standing in the middle of a rapidly disintegrating storage facility, completely and totally alone. His nerves couldn't have been more shot if he had been shot himself. In the midst of his panic, he thought he heard snippets of deranged laughter from behind the flames.

""*Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha...*""

He spun around and fired in the direction of the laughter. Nothing happened. The fire continued to set off stray rounds of ammunition, which disoriented him and made it difficult to tell where the laughter came from. A stray bullet passed mere inches from his face, and he turned again and fired blindly.

""*Dominic? Is that you?*"" Now the voice was louder, and closer, and it took on a strange singsong quality. Dominic briefly entertained the notion that he might already be dead and in hell. He turned, but didn't fire, wildly shaking as he looked back and forth through the flames.

""*It IS you!*""

The voice was directly behind him.

Dominic turned and fired four rounds directly into the girl's stomach. She dropped to her knees, then sprawled out on the floor. A pool of blood gushed out from under her. Dominic squeezed the trigger again, but the gun was empty. 

He stumbled slightly, then got his balance. The girl was lying between him and the loading dock. With the out-of-control fire raging behind him, it was the only exit left in the building. Keeping his gun pointed at the girl, he took a single, hesitant step toward the door.

Almost as if on cue, the girl lifted her hand and planted it on the floor. Dominic screamed, nearly fainting as she lifted herself up, bracing against the truck until she came to her full height. She was laughing in a rage, coughing up blood as she began to take zombie-like steps toward the cartel boss.

""*It's been so long since I saw you last.*""

""How are you not DEAD?"" Dominic yelled. He dropped the gun. His hands were trembling like jackhammers as he walked backwards away from the girl.

""*Do you remember me, Dominic? Do you remember killing my family?*""

""HOW ARE YOU NOT DEAD?"" he yelled again. He tripped then, over a box of guns carelessly flung aside as his workers made their escape. The girl reached him, standing on the box and pointing her revolver at his head.

""*There are so many drugs running through my system. I am riding on a high like you wouldn't believe.*"" She looked down at the bullet holes punched through her t-shirt. ""*I don't feel a thing.*""

The fire was sweeping dangerously close to the semitrailer. Dominic watched the girl as she stepped down from the box.

""Kill me now and be done with it, please. I'm begging you.""

""*I'm not here to kill you, Dominic. You're going to have your entire life to pay for what you did. I might tie you down, torture you for hours, make you wish you  were dead. But you're going to live a good, long life.*""

The girl shot Dominic in the knee. He howled in pain as she grabbed him by the collar and dragged him toward the loading dock.

""*If you stay alive for no other reason, do it for spite,*"" the girl said. ""*It works for me.*""

swiftly running, although the dream was degrading far beyond what she considered normal.

""Hurry!"" she yelled. Her friends were slow to follow. She expected that, of course, but it was devastatingly stressful. Without warning, Jake lost his thread again. No longer in control of his actions, he ran without moving. Mandy looked on in horror. Turning her head upward, she took note of how fast the wall of darkness was moving. It was too fast. There wasn't enough time to rescue him.

Mandy bounded down the hill to rescue him. She was flying blind by this point, reaching out and grabbing threads she wasn't even sure would be there. Slowly she felt it, the warming of her hands as she careened off the essence of the dream itself. The threads grew larger as she increased her speed. Her mentor had told her she would grow closer to the dreaming mind as her power increased. She was too panicked to appreciate how true the statement was.

By now, Janna had reached the top of the hill and was climbing up the ladder to reach the real world. But Mandy knew Janna wouldn't be able to exit without her help. As Mandy looked up the hill, she lost track of the thread responsible for the gravity of the dream, and instead reached for one that burned up in her hand the moment she touched it. She fell straight into the wall.

""Come here, girl!"" The voice sounded all around her, its Irish accent tilting and forming shapes in the Void. Mandy rose up to her hands and knees, stretching out with her senses to find another thread and escape. There were none. Her heart sank as Aisling appeared and began to walk toward her.

""Stay away from me!"" She stumbled to her knees and began to back away. But then Aisling was behind her, whipping her around and grabbing her up by the nape of her neck.

""*Where is he?*"" It was a roar, and in the cavernous space of the Void the words lit up brighter than the sun at noon. Mandy felt her skin burning from the force of the question, but the weight of the answer burned even more.

""He's dead, Aisling.""

""*Liar!*"" He threw Mandy into the ground. Only, there was no ground; the Void opened further and swallowed them whole. She sensed they were in some strange freefall, yet at the same time entirely still. A flash of color passed by in her peripheral vision, something different from the brightness of the villain's speech. *What was that?* she wondered.

""Give me the truth, Amanda.""

""He *is* dead."" Another flash of color; no, color wasn't the right word. *Darkness.* ""When your diversion at the Third Council failed, he was caught in the crossfire. *You* killed him.""

A thread. *Dark* thread. The thread of the Void. Her sudden awareness of its existence woke her up to everything. She felt Aisling's own control of the darkness as he pulled, forcing the falling to stop and the ground to return to their feet. He had his hands clutching an entire fabric of material. How to get away? She reached out for a touch.

""*Stop!*"" Aisling ripped the void out of her hands. She felt it slash against her skin, suddenly sharp and drawing blood from the palm of her psyche. She screamed.

""If he is not dead, so be it. I will be content to see you and your companions brain-dead and feeding from tubes.""

Just one thread. *One.* It was her last resort. She willed herself not to touch the thread directly, instead running her hands over it to sense an easy target. This wasn't the normal thread of dreams, it was woven small and tight and uniform like silk. But there had to be a weak spot, a fray she could take advantage of.

""But if he is not dead,"" Aisling continued, ""you will tell me now. I may even return you to your body.""

Nothing. It was hopeless; the Void was strung together too tightly. Her blood started to boil as she considered doing something very, very drastic.

""Stay then."" He turned. ""The boy is just on the border of the void."" 

Mandy reached out again, and instinctively Aisling pulled back the Void to keep it out of her grasp. But this time, she was ready. Ignoring the pain of the cut, she dug into the fabric with her nails and pulled the fabric taut. At first, it didn't give, and she was afraid it wouldn't work. Then a single pinprick of light appeared in the midst of the threads.

The Void exploded. Her mind scattered in a million different directions, pouring out of the darkness and into the dream. She coalesced in the air, rocketing down to the earth below. She knew a fall from that height would wake her up easily, but she couldn't leave Janna and Jake behind.

She no longer cared about the rules. Her hands roared through entire swathes of thread, ripping and pulling and mashing them together in a bundle in one hand. It paid off instantly. Her friends were suddenly in freefall with her. Janna was in a full blown panic, and Jake was barely lucid. Mandy dragged the fabric forward until the portal was directly under them, and pulled the two close so they would fall in together.

They passed through the portal and woke up. Mandy, being the only one truly in control, was knocked out of her chair by the dream's inertia. She flew forward into the opposite wall at full tilt and crashed into the door frame. Janna and Jake had only been aware enough to fall to the floor.

Mandy coughed and threw up. Through her dizziness, she became faintly aware of the fact that Janna was screaming.

""...To total shreds! You could have killed all of us!""

Mandy got to her feet and staggered out the door. She felt certain one of her ribs was broken.

""Come back here! Come *here*, Mandy!""

Mandy was at the stairs, completely ignoring Janna's complaints. She put a hand on the banister, then hissed and drew it back. She stared at it intently. Her hand, her *real* hand, was bleeding from the cut she'd gotten in the Void.

""Where are you going?"" Janna was behind her. So was Jake. Mandy turned to them.

""We need to get help, and we need it now,"" she replied. ""We're going to find the Fourth Council.""

""You wanna maybe pay attention, old man?"" An aggressive snap of the fingers went off in Joel's face, and he snapped to attention in response. His eyes darted around, and for the first time he noticed the four young men in purple leather jackets who had him nearly surrounded. He looked up.

""Yeah, that's right."" The man with the blond mohawk leaned into Joel's face, obscuring a large knife held menacingly behind his back. The other passengers looked on nervously; several moved to the far ends of the train if only to be a few feet further from the street gang.

""Well? Where's your ticket?""

Joel cocked his head sideways.

""You don't got a ticket, old man?""

Joel was confused, but he dutifully pulled his subway card from his jacket pocket. He lifted it to the blond man's eyes. The man snatched it up and immediately tossed it over his shoulder.

""Not that ticket, you retard. *Our* ticket. Around here, you need our permission to ride these trains."" He waved his knife hand at the other three thugs. ""Did you get our permission to ride, old man?""

Joel seemed to think this was a serious question. He shook his head slowly.

""He doesn't have a ticket!"" The man straightened and threw his hands in the air, as if Joel's lack of an imaginary permission slip were the worst convenience of his day. ""He doesn't have a ticket, people! Can you believe this?""

The other passengers cowered and said nothing.

""Well, that's too bad for you, old man. Now you have to deal with the Ticketmasters. You don't want that.""

Two of the thugs stood up from their chairs. The third had already been standing. All of them carried insanely dangerous weapons. Joel glanced nervously at the gang, then back at the blond man.

Now he whispered. ""You know what they used to do to people who didn't have train tickets?""

Another shake of the head, more cautious.

""Well, the conductor would just... *pick* the man up, you see,"" he said, and at the word pick, two of the thugs surrounded Joel on either side and lifted him out of his chair by the armpits. One held in his free hand a large machete with tiny ironic hearts scratched into the side of the blade. The other carried a baseball bat studded with rusty nails. By now, Joel was aware that he should have started resisting a long time ago, but the men held him so tightly he couldn't even squirm. He shook with nervousness, still clutching his action figures. His bag was left behind on its chair.

""They'd drag the guy clear across the length of the train, see, right to the very back door."" 

It was only a coincidence that they were in the back car of the subway train. But here the blond man was in his element; this was a show for the other passengers' benefit and he made certain that everyone in that puny tin can was sitting up and paying attention. Now he pointed, now he flourished with the blade of his knife, and now he directed the bearded man with the axe to pull the emergency door release, then chop it off altogether. There was some nervous gasping around the space as one side of the door fell open of its own accord.

""And the guy, well, he'd be just a wreck by then, wouldn't he? Making a real mess of himself. He'd be begging, 'Please sir, don't throw me off the train! I'll do anything!' And the conductor would say something like...""

Joel stood in front of the open door, sweating. He couldn't move. As Joel stood there, flanked by violent criminals and facing a rapidly moving wall of concrete, the blond man leaned in behind him and whispered, ""This is what happens when you don't have a ticket, old man.""

With one solid pat on the back, the blond man managed to set Joel screaming and wailing as though his face were on fire. The cigarette flew out of his mouth and into oblivion. But it wasn't enough to eject him from the train. The gang dragged him backward and threw him into the aisle, all relishing the image of his belongings and ""armor"" scattering as he soiled himself on the floor.

""Phew-ee!"" The blond man was grinning, even laughing. ""Glad we aren't anything like them, am I right? You don't have to worry about us. We're the nice ones."" 

He was met with stunned silence from the audience as they collectively pondered how unwilling they were to meet anyone the Pandemonium Gang considered *less* than nice. The only sounds were Joel's sobs and the whirring, shaking noises of train travel.

Presently, however, it became easier to notice a third noise: a pitiful yowling which emanated from under Joel's neck. The two with the axe and machete returned to Joel and picked him up. For the first time, the man with the axe spoke.

""He's got a cat in his hood.

""Lemme see it,"" barked the blond man.

Joel stood straight up, now truly making an effort to free himself as the other man dropped the machete and picked up the kitten from her hiding place by the nape of her neck. The blond man stepped forward, held it in his left hand, and examined it. His knife made small pendulum motions in his right hand. He tsked to himself. The cat yowled again.

""Shut up, you noisy little rat chaser."" He paused. ""Well the cat *has* to go. You can't say we don't have standards."" He glanced backward, enough to give Joel the mere idea that his pet was about to exit through the broken car door.

It took approximately half a second for Joel to lift his leg and drive his heel squarely into the blond man's groin.

The blond man *sailed* into the back of the train. As the force of the blow drove him one way, dropping him onto his butt and into the gangster with the nail-bat, the knife and the cat fell straight downwards to where he had previously been standing. With his other foot planted on the floor, Joel twisted his elbows free of the thugs and leapt for both items. He reached the knife first, wrapping his dominant hand around the weapon and spinning to face his former captors. The cat landed on the floor, but then immediately scrambled up Joel's pant leg and back into the hoodie.

It was all such a clean, fluid motion, that once the dust settled, no one dared to move. The sudden hot energy exuded by the old man reminded more than one passenger of lame men being able to walk in the Bible. But then the train began to slow down, coming into the station. The moment was forced to pass.

The thug who had dropped his machete to pick up the cat now made a mad dash for the weapon. Joel used the inertia of the slowing vehicle to his advantage and hit the man in the shoulder with the force of a linebacker. The man was catapulted to the other end of the car. Joel had just enough time to grab his bag and slip it over one shoulder before the man with the axe made his move.

Joel ducked. This man had entirely misjudged his center of balance and ended up  crashing his axe into the handrail. Joel kicked out his feet and went scrambling for his action figures. These were at the feet of the one who'd had the machete, but he was unconscious. Joel grabbed them, stuffing them in his bag, and then dashed back to the chair for his notebook. He didn't care about the cardboard, scattered around the train car like so much litter in a public park. He could get more later.

The train stopped completely. The man who'd had the axe made a weak attempt to stab at Joel with the dropped machete. He easily dodged it, and kicked the man's arm. The machete dropped back to the floor.

The blond man looked up, squinting through the pain as the unbroken doors opened. The last he saw of the old man was his hand, depositing the knife on the floor of the train as he washed into the crowd and disappeared.

Slow, steady beeping emanated from the heart monitor. It drove Martha mad as she and her parents waited for the doctor, hearing tone after tone that told her Mamaw Sal's heart was not in danger of critical failure. *Mamaw's heart is fine!* she wanted to scream. *You're not helping us figure out what's wrong with her! Stop beeping and leave us alone!*

Dr. Warsenburg came in, accompanied by a nurse, a hot meal, and a very crowded clipboard. The nurse put down the tray of hospital mush and attempted to adjust Mamaw Sal's pillow. With surprising force, the old woman slapped the nurse in the gut. ""*Manténgase alejado de mí, monstruos sin corazón,*"" she grumbled. The nurse wheezed.

""Mother!"" Callie, Martha's mother, started to get up, but the nurse held out a hand to stop her. Gingerly, she tiptoed around the bed and began to replace her IV bag.

""*No confío en ti. Detener el bombeo de esos productos químicos en mi cuerpo.*""

Martha began to cry. She felt stupid; she was old enough to drive and yet she couldn't control any of her emotions. She would have given anything to speak to her grandmother in a language they could both understand. She pinched the bridge of her nose, willing her massive headache to disappear. It didn't. Martha's mother wrapped her arm around her and drew her in.

The doctor wrote on the clipboard for a moment more, then decided to speak. ""So, are you absolutely certain Mrs. Harland has never spoken Spanish before?""

""*Usted sabe la respuesta a esa pregunta, puta.*""

""Yes,"" said Dave. He was impatient. ""For the millionth time, yes.""

""I'm sorry, but I have to be sure."" He put the clipboard in the basket at the foot of the bed. ""I believe this may be the first recorded instance of switching languages after a stroke. Frankly, the entire hospital is baffled.""

""*Mentiroso.*""

""Can you at least tell me whether she spends a lot of time with people who speak Spanish? Or watches Spanish soap operas on television, perhaps?""

""Soap operas... Well yes, actually,"" said Callie.

""*¡Eso hace ninguna diferencia!*"" Mamaw Sal lifted a finger and pointed to her skull. ""*Obligaron a las palabras en mi cabeza! ¡Lo hicieron! No se puede confiar en ninguno de ellos!*"" The nurse stared at her warily. Mamaw Sal glowered back.

""Does that help you at all?"" Dave asked, his teeth gritted together.

""Not as much as I might like. But it's another point of data."" Dr. Warsenburg picked up the clipboard and wrote on it again.

Dave threw up his hands. ""So you can't tell us anything about my mother-in-law's condition.""

""As I said, this is a unique case"" The doctor shook his head. ""If there's any bright side to this situation, it's that you won't have to look for doctors interested in studying her. They'll come to you.""

""Well that's just wonderful.""

""*Bueno, eso es simplemente maravilloso.*""

""I'm sorry. That probably sounded insensitive.""

Martha's mother spoke up. ""Can you at least tell us whether or not she'll speak English again someday?""

""If she were younger, I'd say yes. No question."" He flipped to the first page on the clipboard. ""At seventy-two years, I can't be as certain, but it's not outside the realm of possibility.""

""*A ver si es que alguna vez me dejaron hablar Inglés de nuevo. Lo hicieron a propósito, ya sabes. Quieren hacerme callar.*""

Callie was oddly sobered by this. She stayed silent. The nurse finished her work and left the room. Dr. Warsenburg took a form from the clipboard and presented it to Martha's parents.

""We'd like to move Mrs. Harland to Pandora Research Hospital for further observation. They have more equipment, and if this is something we can solve simply, they'll be able to tell better than we can. No promises, of course,"" he added softly, noting the burst of hope on Martha's face. ""But it's the best option right now. We've done all we can do.""

""*¿Pandora? Nunca. Me matarán a ciencia cierta.*""

""Dave?"" Callie turned to her husband pleadingly. He sighed and signed the papers. His stress caused him to put his head in his hands, pulling his hair back and putting tension on his forehead and ears.

""Let me get you the address. She'll have to be airlifted out, so there won't be an ambulance to follow there."" With that, he stepped out. For a moment, there was silence. Then the nurse poked her head back into the room.

""Excuse me?"" She made eye contact with Martha. ""I didn't want to interrupt before, but... I can speak Spanish. Maybe I can translate for her until you leave?""

Martha sat up. ""Mom?""

""Oh! You're an angel, thank you!"" Callie replied. She stood up and offered her chair to their new translator. Together, the family gathered on the left side of the bed as the nurse sat on the right.

""Do you have anything you want to say to your family? *¿Tiene algo que quieras decir?*""

""*Tu madre era una meretriz de lodo cubierto.*""

For a fraction of a second, Martha thought she saw the nurse wrinkle her nose in disgust. But then she smiled.

""She says, 'I am sorry Mother has to be such a burden.'""

""Oh, that's just like her!"" Now Callie was the one with tears in her eyes.

""You're not a burden, Mamaw,"" Dave said quietly.

""*Usted está más allá sin valor. Necesito papel!*"" Mamaw Sal waved her hands in the air furiously, as though scribbling on an imaginary piece of paper.

""You want something to write with?"" Martha asked quietly.

""*¡Sí!*""

It was one of the few Spanish words they knew instinctively. Callie searched her purse, but couldn't find anything to write on. In a moment of inspiration, Martha pulled out her mobile phone instead. Glad to be useful, she tapped on the screen until she got to the Voice Recorder app.

""Here,"" she said, handing Mamaw the phone. ""You talk into it. See?""

A mad scramble of words poured out of Mamaw Sal's mouth. ""*Su abuelo trabajó para la gente en el Instituto de Investigación. Querían algo que él tomó, o destruido, o algo así. Yo les decía que no sabía lo que estaban hablando, pero me até en esta máquina horrenda y traté de leer mi mente. No puedes dejar que me lleven al hospital. ¿Quién sabe lo que van a hacer a mí?*"" She turned to Martha and her parents. ""*Oh, no hay esperanza. Usted no me puede entender. Los amo a todos. No importa lo que pase. Manténgase lejos, muy lejos de esas personas.*""

""Goodness, she speaks so fast. Umm... 'I love you. No matter what happens.'"" the nurse translated.

Martha started to cry again. ""You're gonna be okay, Mamaw. The doctors are going to fix you.""

""*No, no lo hará.*""

""She says, 'Don't cry.'""

Martha wiped her eyes. ""I won't, Mamaw. You're gonna be okay.""

I consider throwing my phone against the wall. *No, too expensive.* I might as well see what it wants, so I tap on the notification.

    Good evening. It is currently 03:14, the most optimal time for participants in the Blindness Leadership Initiative to wake and begin the day in the initial stages of testing. The Pandora Research Institute thanks you for your involvement with this experimental study.

Below that is a small loading symbol and the word ""Syncing."" They slowly pulse in and out of visibility. *I don't remember signing up for any experimental study*, I think to myself. *Otherwise I'd know what this app is doing on my phone. This is stupid. I'm going back to sleep.*

The moment I set my phone down on the table, it starts buzzing again. I groan. If I were better at computer stuff, I would have gotten rid of it already. I decide to stuff the phone in my closet until morning. Then later I'll take it to that phone repair shop near my office.

Somehow I feel vaguely more aware of my phone's progress as I open the closet door and turn on the light. The loading symbol is flashing faster now, and I'm tempted to see what happens when it finishes. But I need my sleep. I scoop a handful of clothes out of one of the drawers and bury the phone underneath. ""There,"" I say, closing the drawer. ""Good night and good riddance.""

    Sync completed.

""GAAAAHAHHHHH!"" I scream. My head is on fire with pain. For a moment, I feel as though I might collapse on the floor and pass out. I stumble for a moment, closer to the drawer. Somehow, the pain subsides, if only by the smallest amount.

I am on my hands and knees, clawing at the drawer until it falls off its guide rail and falls to the floor. It hits my shoulder hard, but the pain can't outdo the burning sensation in my skull. I dig through the clothes and pull out my phone. Once I have it in my hands, most of the pain vanishes. I turn on the screen.

    For best results, please keep your mobile phone close at hand during this portion of testing. We suggest placing it in your hand or pocket.

Some wild and crazy part of my subconscious wants to throw my phone out the window in rebellion, but for all I know, it might kill me. I don't like having my brain held hostage, but for now I need to play along. I scowl at my phone, and see a small ""next"" button in the corner. I press it.

    Please close your eyes. They must stay closed during the entire period of testing.

I keep my eyes open until the pain in my head returns. Then when they close, it leaves. I'm no longer tempted to disobey the app. Even though the pain is gone, there is still some odd buzzing sensation settled behind my forehead. I try to ignore it.

    Please stand.

I stand up.

    Make your way to your bathroom sink and brush your teeth.

I walk out of my closet and open the door to my room. The apartment is silent, apparently Jason and Meg were too fast asleep to hear my near-death experience. I walk past Jason's room, stepping over a pair of shoes he left in the hallway for no discernible reason, and reach the bathroom.

I stare at myself in the mirror as I brush my teeth. I look like some unnatural monster; it's way too early for me to be awake. I try to rinse off as quietly as possible.

    Now proceed to the kitchen.

*How does the phone know I'm finished brushing?* Yet another of thousands of questions pops into my head as I continue this charade. *Eventually the phone will finish this test, or whatever it is, and then what? Will I have to keep this phone forever? What if it breaks? Or the battery dies?*

    Please make a bowl of cereal.

Great, I don't have any. I'll have to steal some from Meg. I open her cabinets and look at the boxes. *Honey Nut Cheerios, part of this mentally unbalanced breakfast,* I think to myself as I pull it out. I take the milk from the fridge and a bowl and spoon from the dishwasher.

    Eat up!

*Sure. But I don't have to like it-*

    Enjoy!

Somewhere in the world right now, someone has hacked into my phone and my brain, and they can't think of anything better to do than force me to eat cereal. That person is the worst villain ever and I desperately want to punch them to death. But I eat the cereal and try not to think too hard.

    Please wash the dishes.

I try to do this quietly, but the sink is old and the plumbing rattles when it turns on. I must have woken up Meg, because I hear her door open across the hallway. 

""Who's there?"" She enters the kitchen. ""Sam? What are you doing?""

    Today's portion of testing is complete. Thank you for your cooperation.

Suddenly, I open my eyes, and I'm acutely aware of how much I did with them *closed*. I had seen everything I'd done as clearly as if I'd done it in the middle of the afternoon. Shocked, I drop the bowl I'd been washing and take a step back. My fingers are dripping soap.

""Hey, are you okay? Were you sleepwalking or something?"" Meg asks.

My phone hadn't made a sound since it vibrated on my desk. How had I known what it was telling me to do? Maybe I had been sleepwalking.

""Sam?""

""I... I don't know what's going on.""

""Since when do you sleepwalk, anyway?""

""I never did before.""

""Huh."" She glanced at the counter. ""My cereal? Really?""

""Sorry.""

""Just try not to do it again. Go to a doctor or something."" She walked around me and started putting things away.

I stood awkwardly for a moment. ""I'm going back to bed, I guess. Sorry about your cereal."" She made a dismissive wave and turned to put the milk in the fridge.

Once I got back into my room, my phone vibrated again. I snatched it out of my pocket.

    Over the next few weeks, the app will continue to monitor your brainwaves and make adjustments. Please keep your phone well-charged and do not leave it behind at any time. Report to Pandora at any time if side effects other than the ones discussed at orientation appear.

Below that was a progress bar.

    Phase 1 Testing: 2% complete.

I leaned against the door and sunk down into a crouch with my head in my hands.

*What is going on?*

""I daresay,"" said the man as he peered over the girl with some confusion. The girl peered back. The man was old, and the hairs of his mustache were grey. He wore a top hat and a tweed coat and carried a small wooden cane.

""I daresay,"" he said again, more slowly this time, ""I have never seen a woman fall from the sky before.""

The girl said nothing.

""Are you alright, my dear? You seem to have landed quite heavily on the pavement.""

The girl was dazed, and so took a moment to respond. ""I'm alright.""

""Nothing is broken, I hope.""

""No.""

""Well, then."" He extended his free hand to the girl. ""Up you go, dear.""

The girl took the man's hand and came to a sitting position. It was clear to the man, however, that the effort exhausted her.

""That's alright. You need your rest, I suppose. It isn't every day a woman such as yourself falls from the sky.""

""I suppose not.""

The man rested his hands on his cane and looked up at the night sky. Failing to find the object of his search, he turned his attention back to the girl.

""Would you mind telling me how you managed to get here?""

""What do you mean?""

""I'm wondering what sort of activities led you to falling from the sky. I see no planes overhead, or hot air balloons, or blimps.""

The girl shook her head slowly. ""What are those?""

The man gave her a quizzical expression. ""You don't know what planes are?""

""I don't know any of those things you spoke about.""

""Well, they're all fantastic devices. They allow you to travel through the air without falling to the pavement. You might try it someday. It's quite the experience."" He said this without mocking, and the girl found it quite interesting to hear. She looked up at the stars, and picked out one that seemed to be moving.

""Aha! There's a plane now. A wonderful little transport. Is it yours?""

""I don't believe so.""

""Hmm."" He peered again at the girl. ""So then, how were you able to fall from the sky the way you did?""

The girl pondered this for a minute, and decided that she didn't remember. She said as much to the old man.

""You don't?""

""I'm afraid not.""

""Do you remember any of what happened before you fell?""

""No."" She paused, and added, ""Well, not a lot.""

""Well, it's no wonder, I suppose. As I said, you did land quite startlingly. Anyone can be inclined to forget things if they fall hard enough."" The man lowered himself to one knee and stared into the girl's eyes. ""What do you remember, then?""

She put her finger to her chin, and rolled her eyes up toward the sky to think. ""I remember falling. I don't think I liked it very much.""

""Few people do,"" said the man. ""What else?""

She thought again. ""I remember the sun, and the clouds, and a very great blue sea. That is all, I think.""

The man took off his top hat and scratched himself on the head. ""This is quite a puzzle,"" he said.

""Is it?""

""It is. We are nowhere near the sea, my dear. Far from it.""

""Where are we then?""

""This is the city of Lostanburg, the capital of Renier,"" said the man, and here he stood again and gestured down the road. It sloped down from where he stood and she sat, providing a vantage point from which the girl could see short, stocky buildings organized in neat rows, covered in just a hint of summer rain. ""As you can see,"" he continued, ""it is quite a nice city to live in. But if you wish for a seaside property, you'll find it quite lacking.""

""How far is the sea from here?""

""Miles and miles, my dear. And I haven't been in quite some time.""

""Well, I simply must get back,"" the girl said. ""My mother will be very worried.""

""Your mother, you say? And who would that be?""

""Oh."" She paused. ""I'm not at all sure.""

""But you remember having a mother?""

""Yes, I do think so.""

""What of a father?""

""I don't know.""

""Well then."" The man placed his top hat back on his head. ""I suppose that will be as good of a start as we will get. But if you remember any more, that will be excellent as well."" He offered the girl his hand again. ""Are you ready, my dear?""

""Where are we going?""

""Why, to the sea, of course.""

""You don't mind it, do you? I'm sure you have better things to do.""

""Nothing better at all, my dear, nothing better at all."" He took her hand and lifted her to her feet. She had gained her strength back after a bit of rest, and could stand on her own.

""That's very kind of you.""

The man smiled. ""My name,"" he said, ""is Martin Zebree. And what should we call you, I wonder?""

""I don't know my name.""

""Of course."" Martin leaned on his cane. ""Why don't we call you Rain? Rain falls from the sky too, you know. I think it's quite fitting""

""It sounds very nice.""

""Well then, Rain,"" said Martin, offering Rain his arm. ""Let's take a trip to the sea.""

""Hey, Pastor Ben?""

Ben looked up from his Bible to see Delaurah peering down at him expectantly. Her braids were close enough to his face to brush smudges onto his glasses. He took them off and wiped them on a piece of cloth in his shirt pocket.

""I brought a guest. He said he was interested in a Bible study.""

""Delaurah, you bring a guest every week. You don't have to keep telling me.""

""I just want you to know. I met him at the shelter. He said he got kicked out of his home a few weeks ago, and he was so depressed.""

""What's his name?""

""It's Lucio."" She pointed to a skinny Hispanic-looking teen in the corner wearing a white t-shirt and holding a skateboard.

""I really want the others to make him feel welcome. I don't think he's used to being in a church.""

""Alright, Delaurah. So long as you didn't-"" She skipped off before Ben could finish. He sighed. ""Alright. Gather around, everyone. Let's get started.""

Twenty chairs were set out in a circle in the center of the chapel. There were more than thirty attendees. There might have been twice as many if Ben hadn't asked the other youth pastor to start holding a second Bible study on Tuesdays. Delaurah dutifully attended both, and always with a friend. Ben couldn't complain; she was being a good witness. But he could tell from the start that Lucio was different. His shirt was spotless and his hair was neatly combed, but he had a different presence from Delaurah's other guests. 

Lucio put his skateboard under his chair and sat down. His hands were balled into fists. He kept one foot on his skateboard at all times, as though he were afraid someone might steal it from under him. Ben watched him nervously.

""So, Delaurah tells me she brought a visitor. His name is Lucio."" No one reacted to the obvious news. Someone had found more chairs in storage and a few church members were putting them down behind the first row of seats. ""Do you want to introduce yourself, Lucio?""

He looked startled. ""Uh...""

""It's okay if you don't want to.""

""Do I have to stand?""

""Not if you don't want to.""

""Okay."" He didn't stand. ""My name is Lucio Prieto. I'm, uh... I never expected to be here."" He rubbed his knuckles as he spoke, turning them red.

""I came from a bad home. My mother is always drinking, always... spending time with other men. My dad runs with criminals. With the mob. And for a long time, I thought I was fine with that life. But then I realized I wasn't. I told myself, 'There must be something better.'"" He kept fidgeting, almost as though it pained him to keep telling his story. ""My dad kicked me out of the house once he figured it out. He said I was weak, and he didn't want people thinking he was weak.""

Lucio stayed silent for a few seconds. One kid in the back row called out, ""So what happened?""

""I stayed in the shelter a couple days. I was almost desperate enough to go back home and try to fit in. Then I met Delaurah, and she invited me here.""

""Well, that's-""

""She's just so nice, you know?"" Ben wondered if Lucio even realized he'd interrupted. ""She told me she went through exactly what I did, except her's was worse. Because she had demons for parents. Like, literal demons."" He paused. ""From Hell.""

One or two people groaned, and Ben resisted the urge to put his head in his hands. Most of the teens, though, nodded silently without a trace of mocking or disbelief. By now, Ben shouldn't have been surprised, but he always was.

""And I guess if she can stick to her decision, then I can too. So I'm willing to give this religion thing a try, I guess."" He shrugged. ""That's all I've got.""

Delaurah, next to him, turned and put her hand on her heart, grinning. ""Aw, Lucio...""

Ben sighed. ""Why don't we get to studying? Settle down, everyone."" He caught the eyes of the kids who were glaring daggers at the girl and her newcomer. ""This week we're studying Romans, chapter eight.""
***
By all earthly accounts, Delaurah was a small, sixteen-year-old Black girl whose parents were unknown. She insisted to everyone she met that this was because her parents had lived in Hell for the last few millennia. It was a shock to Ben when they'd first met; he had considered exorcism, but she was so sweet in every other regard that he had quickly ruled it out. (Mostly.) Eventually, he had settled upon believing that she was a compulsive liar. What he could never figure out was how she managed to get other teens to believe her. He understood the few who ignored her, and certainly sympathized with the few who groaned whenever she brought up her childhood by the lake of fire and brimstone. The majority of people who came to the Bible study, however, were the ones she recruited. They would have believed her if she'd said the sun was made from the remnants of a broken desk lamp. 

The meeting was finished. Delaurah and Lucio were standing in the center of the circle of chairs, chatting with some of the others.

""Delaurah?"" Ben put his hand on her shoulder.

""Hmm? Oh. You guys go ahead. I'll catch up to you.""

""See ya, Del."" The kids from the shelter walked out in a group. The others split off to the parking lot to meet with their parents. Ben turned Delaurah around and ushered her down the hallway to his office.

""Delaurah, I need to ask you-""

""You need to ask me something every week, Pastor Ben. You don't have to keep telling me.""

It was the first time Delaurah had ever talked back to an adult. His eyes went wide.

""Um, sorry. That was a joke. Remember, from earlier?""

""Yes, I get it."" Ben pinched the bridge of his nose.

""I'm sorry, Pastor. What did you want to ask me?""

""Delaurah, I need you to stop telling people your parents are demons.""

""What? Why?""

""Sit down."" He sat in an old leather chair on the other side of the desk. ""I think we both know what you're telling the other kids isn't true. And I'm worried that it will make them vulnerable-""

""You don't believe me?"" She sounded genuinely confused. ""Why didn't you say so earlier?""

He sighed. ""You're a nice girl, Delaurah. When I first met you, I figured that's how you got over losing your parents. But I think it's time you start taking steps to move on. Vilifying them is ultimately going to hurt your spiritual growth, and especially the growth of the other members.""

""But they *are* villains. They're-""

""They aren't demons, Delaurah. They are - or were - just normal people who sinned as much as anybody else.""

""What do I have to do to prove it to you?""

""Delaurah, I want you to have this."" He pulled a business card from his desk and handed it to her. She took it hesitantly. ""I have a friend I want you to talk to. I've had him meet with with others who have lost their parents-""

The entire business card burst into flames. Delaurah had it pinched between her fingers, but didn't seem to notice as small embers flaked off and started falling towards the floor. Ben screamed; she didn't acknowledge it. She stared a thousand yards ahead, speaking quietly at first, but then rapidly picking up strength and volume.

""I'm not going to visit a psychologist. There's nothing wrong with me. I'm not crazy, I'm not lying, *I'm not going through a phase, and I'm NOT GOING BACK ON MY DECISION!"" I just-*"" She sobbed. ""*I just want to be GOOD!*""

Ben was stuck. His throat went dry and he gasped for air. A doctor might have said he was on the verge of a heart attack. Delaurah sniffed and, finally noticing the small fire on the carpet, stomped it out with her shoe.

""I thought you believed in me, Pastor Ben."" She ran out of the office. If Ben had been entirely out of his mind, he might have followed after her. In any case, however, he never heard her footsteps in the hallway.

She wasn't in the church anymore.

The room was suddenly much, much colder.

When Norman returned from his lunch break, he found his coworkers gathered around Robert's desk. Robert was showing them something on his computer. Robert turned and noticed Norman standing in the doorway. ""Hey Norman, come and see this!"" he said. Norman walked over to Robert's desk. 

""What is it?""

""I got bored after lunch, so I looked up the meaning of my name on this website I found. It means 'bright fame.' That's pretty cool, right? You want to know yours?""

""I suppose so,"" said Norman. It did seem like an interesting bit of trivia.

Robert typed ""Norman"" into the search bar and read the description that followed. ""'From an old Germanic byname meaning ""Northman"", referring to a Viking.'"" Then he clicked the back button. ""It says here that the Normans were the ones who introduced the name 'Robert' to the British. So the people who made your name made my name famous. Isn't that interesting?""

""That does sound interesting,"" Norman said quietly. The other coworkers tittered at the strange coincidence. Norman stood awkwardly for a moment until someone else asked what their own name meant. Then he walked over to his own desk and went back to work.

Later, Norman was at home filling Norman's dish with cat food. ""Did you know you were named after Vikings, Norman?"" he asked. Norman took a bite from his cat food and seemed unconcerned by this news.

""I guess it isn't that interesting after all,"" said Norman. He prepared his own dinner and sat down to watch the newest episode of CSI. ""This will be much more interesting,"" he mused.

It's not that the couple has had to listen to me rambling on as I look through the forms. They haven't taken their eyes off each other since they got here. You could cut the tension with a knife. The man is angry, red in the face like an overheated train furnace. On the other hand, the woman's eyes are dead and soulless.

I wonder who will win.

""Anyway, Mr. and Mrs., um... well, you're getting divorced. What's your maiden name, ma'am?""

She turns slowly. It's very unsettling to look directly into her eyes. I imagine this must be what it's like to look at Medusa. Say, that'd be a good fighting name. I'll have to bring it up-

""Chen.""

""Okay. Mr. Townsend and Ms. Chen. Well, I see you've got all the requisite forms filled out, and... hmm. Mr. Townsend, I'm going to need you to sign this page here.""

He takes it silently, but I can practically hear his muscles rippling under his shirt. He's a lot bigger than his wife, though I'm not counting her out just yet. Very spry looking. Reminds me of a ninja, almost. What was that one fight I saw-

""Excuse me?"" he says, waving the paper in my face.

""Ah! Sorry. Very easily distracted.""

""Perhaps we should take our business elsewhere,"" says Ms. Chen.

""Oh, no need for that. I promise, complete focus from here on out. Okay? Okay."" I reach into my desk drawer and bring out my event calendar and venue list. Boy, do I have a lot of junk in here. ""Now, you do understand this is going to be a televised event. Here's a list-""

""We *already have a venue.* Weren't you listening?"" asks Mr. Townsend.

""Oh, ah, well I promise you Henry, Henry, Sykes and Fanaday can get you any ring in the country for much cheaper-""

""This is the venue we want. If you will not submit, we will leave.""

Good night, I can feel my feet turning to stone already. Medusa it is. I wonder- no, focus. ""What, ah, did you have in mind?""

""Lightning Strikes Twice in Las Vegas.""

If I were drinking coffee, I would have choked on it. ""We... don't work with them.""

""You are *useless,*"" Mr. Townsend growled. They both got up.

""No no no wait! Don't leave. I meant we don't... *normally* work with them. Of course an exception can be made! It's just... can I please ask you to reconsider?""

""This is where we wish to fight. What exactly is the problem, Mr. Dellis?"" asked Ms. Chen.

""Ms. Chen... do you mind if I call you Min?""

""I mind very much.""

""Min, I'll be honest with you. The LST is... just not a pleasant way to go.""

""I do not wish for this to be pleasant.""

I chuckled. ""Well, no, of course not. But you have to think about yourself for a minute here."" I reach over to my keyboard and pull up a spreadsheet. ""Now, our firm keeps detailed records on all the divorce rings in the country. That's why we're the best, you know. 'Detail in Divorce Deals Delicious Deaths,' that's our motto.""

""Would you just get on with it?"" Mr. Townsend almost yells.

""Right. Well, for LST, the statistics aren't good. It's the nature of the ring. Thirteen by twenty-one acres of synthetic forest environment, and no weapons allowed. You start on opposite ends-""

""We are aware, Mr. Dellis. Is there a point?""

I sigh. ""Look, once you're in, you aren't allowed to back out. And a fight to the death isn't much fun once reality sets in. Any lawyer in the country will tell you to go for a quick and easy option. A shootout at twenty paces, for example, one of my personal favorites. The point is, don't give in to the gimmicky venues. They're popular, but they aren't good for much else.""

""Where do you get off telling me how I should kill my wife?""

""Well, I wouldn't count your- I mean, I'm not. I'm just saying-""

""Alex, we are obviously wasting our time,"" says Chen. leveling me with her stare. I'm almost certain the room has gotten colder. ""We will find another divorce lawyer.""

""Hold on!"" I shuffle some papers and pick up the venue list. ""You win, alright? One gruesome, hand-to-hand combat death it is.""

""Finally,"" Mr. Townsend mutters.

""This is going to cost you a *lot* of overhead, you understand? I'm going to be signing insurance forms for days."" 

I look at them. Mrs. Chen almost seems to be smiling. It's creepy. ""You two must really hate each other. I have to ask. What made you two want to get a divorce? Infidelity? A history of violent crime?""

""No,"" Mr. Townsend says, sitting down again. ""The relationship just kind of... lost its spark.""

The return home was long and uncomfortable. Although the snow was freshly plowed and the road freshly salted, Mrs. Steele's SUV rattled and slipped along the inclines. It was slow going, made all the more sluggish by traffic and her own nervous driving habits. She would stand at stoplights for minutes at a time, fearing some imaginary eighteen-wheeler might come out of the midnight haze and t-bone her and her passengers into oblivion. She pressed on.

Patrick was uncomfortable. The heater was set to high and his breath felt constricted. Mrs. Steele's son, Jonathan, slept soundly in the seat across from him, but Patrick had a myriad of thoughts racing through his brain, thoughts too pressing to wait for morning.

He missed his mother. Part of his anxiousness was due to survivor's guilt; it was the first time either of them had been in an accident, and he was shocked to see the extent of her injuries when he had come out needing only a few stitches on his forehead and arms. He had cried for a while, until a kind nurse brought him a cup of hot cocoa and told him that his neighbor Mrs. Steele was on his way to pick him up from the emergency room.

This was his second point of worry. His mother's car was ruined, and his father's car was buried under a snowdrift by his office. Fortunately (or unfortunately, as the case may have been) Mrs. Steele and her son had been more than willing to make the drive out and return Patrick to his house.

He'd never been with another family this late at night. Earlier in his life, there had been doctors, professors, various biologists and theoretical physicists, but he had been too young to remember. He only knew that somehow, his parents had kept those scientists from taking him and studying him for the rest of his life. They had told him never to reveal the change to others, to keep it hidden.

Now change was unavoidable.

Five minutes to midnight. Now four. The clock in the car was wrong, he knew the time just as well as he knew his own names. He snuck a glance at Jonathan. More worry. They were friends, but not close. His relationship with his friends in the neighborhood was naturally strained; he was home-schooled and only came out every other day, if at all. 

He waited. And midnight came. The shift was rapid, but in the dark he managed not to catch Mrs. Steele's attention. The changes started small, at the base of his feet, and worked their way upward. She didn't feel all that uncomfortable, in fact, she would normally have slept through the entire process. Her clothes were less than ideal, but she knew nothing could be done about that. Aside from shifting her weight in the car seat, she stayed still.

Then the car went over a bump in the road. This, in tandem with her shifting facial features, caused her stitches to tear. She gasped involuntarily. Jonathan stirred but didn't wake.

""It's alright, Patrick. We're on your street now."" Mrs. Steele tightened her grip on the steering wheel. ""Just a little more. It's a good thing this road is flat.""

Patricia said nothing. She wished Mrs. Steele wasn't so talkative; Jonathan had stirred again, and she was quickly losing hope that she could rush inside her house without her new body being seen.

Without warning, Mrs. Steele stopped the car and honked on the horn, trying to gain the attention of Patricia's father. Patricia's heart sank. As Jonathan finally lifted himself from sleep, she scrambled for the door handle. It lifted, but the door wouldn't budge.

""It's the child lock, dear."" Mrs. Steele was already out of the car. ""Hold on, I'll get it.""

She opened the door, then screamed. It was loud, and very unwelcome; Jonathan was wide awake now, and so were most of the neighbors. Lights flickered on randomly at houses along the road, and windows were being opened, knocking old snow and icicles off their sills.

""Mama? What's wrong?"" Jonathan's eyes darted around wildly, and decided to settle on Patricia's long, brown hair. ""Where's Patrick?""

Patricia turned. Her face was obscured by her bangs and the small stream of blood running down her forehead. But whereas Mrs. Steele had seen a small, seven year old girl wearing boy's clothes and a red halo of broken thread and dried blood, young Jonathan recognized his friend instantly.

""*Patrick's a girl?*""

""Johnny-""

""Patrick's a GIRL!"" Jonathan whooped with laughter. ""Patrick's a girl, Mama!""

""Johnny, you have to be quiet!"" Patricia stamped her foot. She tried to climb back into the car, but Jonathan leapt up into the front of the car.

""No, you can't touch me!"" He was still laughing. ""Now you have cooties!""

""Johnny, stop it!"" Patricia jumped and stomped her feet until she slipped on black ice. Now the stitches in her left arm had ripped under her coat. She picked herself up from the ground and started to cry as her father finally came out of the house.

""Emma?"" Mrs. Steele turned, pale and wide-eyed. ""I am so sorry about this. It was completely out of my hands-"" Another light flicked on, this time at the house across from them, and he stopped to take in the entire scene. ""What on earth is going on?""

Jonathan clambered into the driver's seat of the car and slid down. ""Mr. Harrison, Patrick's a girl now! Haha!""

Before either parent could stop them, Patricia tackled Jonathan into the snow and started beating him ferociously. ""Be quiet! It's supposed to be a secret!""

""Ow! Hey! Cooties! Get offa me!""

""YOU! CAN'T! TELL!""

Mr. Harrison pulled his daughter away, as she screamed all the while. Mrs. Steele was still shell-shocked, beyond hope of any active response.

""You can't tell me what to do!"" Jonathan lifted himself up. ""I'm gonna tell all the kids!""

""NO!""

""Hey, guys! Guess what? Patrick's a girl now!"" He ran off, down the street and into the night as more lights turned on and more windows were opened and more and more children heard the strangely hilarious news. ""Patrick's a girl!""

""Patricia, you need to go inside, okay? Now."" She struggled, still wanting to find Johnny and punch him into submission, but Mr. Harrison held firm until she gave up and ran into the house crying. Then he turned to Emma.

""What-""

""In the morning."" His voice was hot and demanding. ""I need you to go and collect your son.""

""But your-""

""I promise you, we will sort this out in the morning. I need to go talk to my daughter.""

""Your *daughter-*""

""*Good night,* Emma."" He walked inside, closing the garage door behind him.

Mrs. Steele never moved.

Mr. Harrison found Patricia lying on her bed, still in her coat and boots, sobbing uncontrollably. He turned on the light, illuminating the blue-and-pink striped walls, and walked to her bedside.

""Let's get you out of those wet clothes, okay?""

""No.""

""Sweetie-""

""Now Johnny's gonna tell everybody! I told him not to tell, but he didn't listen!"" Abruptly, she threw her pillow at the lamp on her bedside. It tipped and fell.

Her father sat down on the bed, and laid a hand on Patricia's shoulder. She squirmed and shook until he removed it. Mr. Harrison clasped his hands together, searching for the right words.

""I want Mommy.""

""I know, honey."" He paused. ""I know.""

She wept herself to sleep. When her breathing evened, her father changed her into her favorite pink pajamas, and laid her down under the covers. Then he turned off the light and went to sleep alone in his own bed.
***
Below, on the street, Mrs. Steele still hadn't moved, save for hugging herself and shivering in the stiff wind. Jonathan had free reign over the neighborhood until he tired himself out, voice hoarse from shouting. He went back to his mother.

""Mama, I'm tired now. Can we go home?""

She roused herself from her stupor, and they walked home. She left her SUV by the curb of the Harrison's house, still too shaken to drive. As she fumbled with the key to the front door, Jonathan giggled sleepily.

""*Patrick's a girl.*""

""Please come in, Dr. Reynolds."" Morgan Reynolds, M.D., entered the office slowly. He set his cane near the door, but stopped when the Director of Nursing gestured toward it.

""I'm sorry, would you please bring your Cane with you?""

Dr. Reynolds cursed under his breath as he picked up the cane. He had known this meeting was coming the moment Dr. Heather Pulaski took on her most recent promotion. She was an upstart, rising quickly through the ranks after gaining her Masters degree, and though she had only just joined the organization rumor spread that she had her sights set on becoming Vice-President of Nursing before she turned 35.

Mostly, he was surprised it had taken so long.

He sat. ""What may I do for you, Dr. Pulaski?""

""I've decided to spend some time going over personnel records. As you know, it is my first week here, and I decided it would be prudent to take note of some of the more... *distinguished* members of the work force."" She steepled her fingers, placing them close to her mouth as she spoke the way a teacher might do with a troublesome student. ""I wanted to know who to keep an eye on.""

""Of course."" Heather Pulaski had a slow, pitying way of speaking. It was enough to raise Dr. Reynolds' blood pressure by the smallest amount; he felt as though she were talking down to him despite him being more than twice her age.

She expected him to continue, but he didn't. Flustered, she rearranged the file currently on her desk, tapping it into a neat stack before going on. 

""Well, I happened to come across a discrepancy, and I was hoping you might be able to clear something up for me.""

""And what would that be?""

""Well."" She took a long list from the top of the stack. ""I have here your Record of Events of the Cane. It's quite protracted. But of course, you've worked here at Our Lady of Infinite Virture for quite some time, so a record of this length is almost inevitable. Almost.""

Dr. Reynolds said nothing.

""The discrepancy is in the length of your Cane itself. According to the records, you carved yours on the year the Oath of the Wood was put in place, long after you graduated. It was forty-eight inches, is that correct?""

""Yes.""

""May I see it, please?""

Dr. Reynolds held out the pole with one hand. She received it with two, reverently closing her eyes and running her hands across its length. It was long, a cedar with a three-inch horizontal bar of wood at the top which acted as a handle. On that handle was Rod of Asclepius, carefully inscribed and inlaid with silver. Both the shaft and the handle were an inch thick and perfectly smooth. She then brought the fingers of her right hand to the base of the Cane. Removing the ferrule from the base, she saw the number ""47"" branded into the bottom end.

""As I thought."" Dr. Pulaski replaced the tip and returned the Cane, palms upright as she did so. Dr. Reynolds took it and laid it across his lap. ""Your Cane is marked as having one inch removed since you first graduated, and your personnel file seems to agree. But according to state records, you should have received forty-four Carvings of the Cane in your years here."" Her tone was sarcastic and patronizing. ""Surely, the state has made a very grave mistake.""

""Yes, they have.""

""Oh?"" Dr. Pulaski raised her eyebrows.

""The number should be sixty-one.""

Heather Pulaski's face went blank as she processed this information. Then it went pale.

""Doctor, perhaps you should take this accusation more seriously. Artifice of the Cane has severe repercussions.""

""I am aware, Miss Pulaski.""

""It's *Doctor* Pulaski. Which is more than I will be able to say for you in a moment unless you can convince me your staff is the correct size.""

""It isn't.""

""Very well."" She reached for the intercom. ""I'm afraid I have no choice but to-""

""I wouldn't do that.""

Heather stopped. ""And why not? You are guilty of *fraud,* Dr. Reynolds. You need to be reported to the proper authorities.""

""Which means you get another gleaming star on your resume for reporting a Canaanite. That's what this is really about, isn't it?"" Dr. Reynolds straightened in his chair. ""But I don't envy your position, Miss Pulaski. You aren't sitting on an opportunity, you're sitting on a *powder keg*.""

""Really.""

""Do you know how many doctors in this department have misreported the length of their canes?"" Heather's hands trembled ever so slightly as he warmed to his tirade. ""If an investigation is opened, even accidentally, the malpractice suits alone will cost this hospital *billions.* That will not be an accomplishment you want under your belt. You would be blacklisted from medical service across the country.""

Heather gritted her teeth in exasperation. ""You can't possibly expect me to take you seriously, Doctor. The state removes all doctors who lose their cane, without discretion. And the Oath of the Wood-""

""-Is for fools and children, Miss Pulaski."" He leaned forward. ""Doctors fail, just the same as everyone else. It is a terrible fact of life that not everyone makes it off the operating table with a clean bill of health. But when that miserable oath became the national law, patients would refuse care from their doctors if they saw even the smallest losses on a cane. The system broke down long before your time. So we, the surgeons and physicians, changed it.""

Heather was red in the face, her hand still poised halfway to the phone, but Dr. Reynolds went further. ""No respectable doctor gives a damn about their cane, Miss Pulaski. What you know is nothing but propaganda from the state, spread by colleges because they believe the customer is always right and death is inexcusable, even for an illness such as cancer. The only reason we bother holding our canes at all is because otherwise, we can't help anyone.""

Heather dropped her hand abruptly. ""How many are there, in this department? Tell me.""

""More than you want, to be certain.""

""I can't believe this went on for so long without someone reporting it to the state.""

""Your predecessor was happy to turn a blind eye whenever he could. Dr. Malkovich only made reports to the state when a patient or their family went above his head, or threatened to call the media. Which, in my opinion, was quite too often.""

""And what? Do you expect me to do the same?""

""You have a very important decision to make, Miss Pulaski. But I believe the correct choice should be obvious."" Dr. Reynolds stood, and leaned on his cane as he arched his back. ""Remember: no one likes a whistle-blower.""

""I still don't believe you, Doctor."" She held up her hand to stop him from leaving the office. ""If all of what you said was true, why would you cut your Cane at all?""

Dr. Reynolds gave a sly smile. ""'I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person's family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick.'"" He tapped on the handle of the walking stick. ""I forgot that once. So I had it carved.""

Heather was nonplussed. She didn't move.

""I suppose if you don't believe me, you should keep looking over those personnel files. You'll know who to keep an eye on soon enough.""

""That's not really what they said, is it?""

""Well, no, but you get the gist."" Harry cocked his gun and took a shot at the tentacled mannequin fifty yards ahead of him. He wasn't used to the strange silence of the weapon; the gun range was silent but for the chattiness of the other soldiers. They were thin and light as well, the thickness and weight of a paperback textbook, and he had been struggling to find a good place to rest it on his shoulder.

""We come, we see, we conquer. And we get paid in technology and medicine. Everyone wins.""

""Except the aliens we're fighting."" Uriah took aim himself, but missed, and had to take another energy pack from his belt to reload the gun.

""Yeah, except them. Seriously, how did you manage to enlist without hearing about this?""

Uriah shrugged. ""I did hear about it. I guess I just didn't believe it until now.""

""Yeah, I get that.""

""Doesn't this all seem kind of strange to you, though?""

""Right? This gun is weird."" Harry took seven shots in rapid succession. The target was incinerated, but in seconds, it reformed and started moving around the range again.

""That's not what I meant."" Uriah paused. ""I always thought that, when we met aliens, they would be the ones attacking us. Not the other way around.""

""Guess not. Funny how that works.""

""Thought we would be all about... universal peace and stuff.""

""Well, we aren't. But it makes sense, I guess.""

""We aren't even trying though!"" Uriah aimed and scored a headshot against the fake Korii'atu. His tally was still much lower than Harry's; he wasn't used to guns in general. ""We're going to go fight in the biggest war ever, just because these aliens got to us first and offered us some toys.""

""And medicine! Don't forget medicine."" Harry dropped an empty energy pack into the vacuum tube at waist height. It zipped off, heading toward the recycling plant. Uriah shook his head and continued firing.

About four minutes later, an intercom sounded. **""Human lunch is now being served. All humans please report to your designated serving station at this time.""**

Harry and Uriah collapsed their guns and sent them through the tube. Then they stooped through the door of the gun range (which hadn't yet been retrofitted to human specifications) and walked in a line with the others to the mess hall.

""It's not the end of the world, you know.""

""It bothers me.""

""You should be glad. They took one look at us and they said to themselves, 'Humans are the best species in the galaxy and we want them on our side.' I think it's flattering.""

""Does fighting well really make us the best species? We used to hate war.""

""Think of it this way."" Harry put his arm on Uriah's shoulder and leaned on him as they walked. ""Earth has always been about survival of the fittest. If you don't die, that means you deserve it. That's how things work in our world. Now we know that's how things work in the space too. And it turns out, we're the best at it.""

""What does that mean though?""

""It means humanity is going to live forever! Nothing is ever going to touch us.  The Klintakks are going to give us everything we could want! What's a little war compared to that?""

They entered their serving station. It was a wide and spacious room, with buffets of human food on either side. No one went hungry here, victuals were cloned by the minute and accommodated to all preferences. The ceiling was transparent, and the stars streaked across it as the enormous Klintakk space cruiser roared its way silently across the cosmos. Every human that entered the room took at least a moment to look at the vast expanse of space beyond.

""We get treated like kings for doing what we do best. I'd say a little war is a fair price for all their technology.""

""And medicine?""

""Now you're getting it.""

If the fact had been up for dispute at any time in the past, it wasn't anymore: Vivian Eleonora Van Hassel had the most difficult job in the entire solar system, and, pending sufficient investigation, she had reason to believe she could safely claim such a title on a universal scale.

""So,"" she said, dragging out her words with a sharp, tired French accent, ""I have made the decision-""

""Excuse me?""

""*WHAT?*""

Mark leaned back in his seat, a smug smile on his face. ""Isn't the bailiff supposed to say 'all rise' before we begin?""

One of the astronauts snickered, despite himself, but managed to hide it under a bought of fake coughing. The others were forced to choose between staring at a murderer, and staring at the man who thought the murderer was funny.

A voice came on over the radio. ""Marcus Janson...""

Vivian shut off the intercom, and with a few quick movements, transferred the radio broadcast to her own personal earpiece. The transmission of the shuttle's broadcast to Earth, however, went uninterrupted. ""President Relnson, you are no longer speaking with the crew of Pandora.""

""Excuse me?""

Vivian stared directly at Mark as she spoke. He kept smiling. ""With all due respect, Mister President, you are not in a position to be of any use in this process, and I am not in a position to waste time. We will thank you not to interrupt our proceedings. If we cannot deal with this... *infuriating* error on our own terms, this mission will fail.""
***
There were only eight people on board the Pandora Rocket One, four men and four women. Originally the mission had called for two of each kind, but a surplus of funding and breakthroughs in Pandora Research Incorporated's life support systems had allowed the company to double the size of the new Mars colony. In a way, this was the cause of the entire ordeal. If Pandora hadn't chosen to add Marcus Janson to the extended roster, his wife would not have cheated on him in fear of separation, and Marcus would have had no motive to kill her.

This, of course, did not justify Frieda's murder in the slightest. He understood that. But when Marcus came to his senses, he decided his reasoning was irrelevant. The deed was done, and thankfully, the body only needed to stay hidden for about eighteen hours. After that, what could they do? No government authority could touch him; it was the lawbreaker's ultimate fantasy.

He probably wouldn't be remembered fondly. But he would be *remembered.* Marcus smiled, not because he was a psychopath or unhinged in any way, but because he had essentially committed the perfect crime. It made him feel important. He was the center of attention for the foreseeable future, and he planned to enjoy every moment of it.
***
""Mark, let us make one thing perfectly clear,"" Vivian intoned. She took off her earpiece, ignoring the President's voice as he protested against the rude interruption. ""You are not in the jurisdiction of your American justice system. There is no bailiff, or judge, or jury, or anything else you want to flip your middle finger at. And you may think that you are getting away with what you did, but if you so much as *think* about getting on my nerves, I will throw you into the airlock and take selfies with your freeze-dried corpse.""

""But that's murder,"" Marcus said in deadpan sarcasm.

""Not anymore."" In her mind, Vivian was ready to tear her hair out, but she managed to keep her gaze steadily fixed on the murderer. ""My job as leader of the Pandora mission is to decide your prison sentence, and that will be the punishment if you attempt to break my laws. This is not a game, Marcus. The Mars colony will have a justice system just as any country on Earth.""

Mark's smile slipped from his face as the realization dawned on him. ""You're serious? You're actually considering capital punishment?""

""No. I am considering solitary confinement for the rest of the journey. That is my decision."" Vivian had crossed the shuttle's conference room and was now leaning into the face of the accused. ""Don't *make* me consider capital punishment, Marcus. It will not be pleasant.""

Marcus stood from his chair and stared back. ""You won't live to consider it, you b-""

Vivian slapped him soundly across the face, and Marcus staggered back, suddenly enraged. Before he could respond in kind, the other male astronauts grabbed him and pulled him away.

""Take him to his living quarters and seal him off."" She massaged her knuckles as Marcus continued to struggle. ""He stays there until we land.""

""You will regret this! You can't hurt me, Vivian!"" Marcus screamed. ""You can't keep me locked up forever!""

Vivian calmly returned her earpiece to its rightful place as the men took Marcus and the women stared on in horror. She tapped it lightly. ""Are you still there, President Rel-""

""Vivian, do you have any idea what people are saying down here? How the public is reacting?"" President Relnson was beyond angry. 

""Whatever it is, it is not my problem.""

""You won't be able to keep up this... this vigilante justice, Ms. Van Hassel. I may not understand your distrust of American politics, but-""

""You understand nothing, Mr. President. You and Pandora Research have locked up my crew with a psychopath millions of miles from Earth. Nothing you say or do can help us."" She looked down the ship's passageway just as the men corralled Marcus into his room like cowboys trying to restrain a raging bull. ""He is my problem now.""

""Hello, Greg. My name's Dan. Nice to meet you."" 

Dan put out his hand to shake in greeting. Greg did not put out his hand in return. Dan was slightly put off by this, but then had to remind himself Greg probably hadn't seen an anthropomorphic skeleton in the flesh before today.

...In the lack of flesh? Hmm. Never mind. Dan opened the door to his office, half expecting Greg not to follow. He did. 

The walls of the office were bathed in pictures of flames and demonic imagery. Greg began shaking as he entered, filled with fear of what horrible monster could work in a room designed to look like Hell.

""Alright, take a seat. Sorry about the decor."" Dan rounded the desk and sat down in a simple blue office chair. ""The last guy who worked here was a real nut. I've been meaning to redecorate, but I don't get many visitors anyway. I might just go with an eggshell white, maybe hang up some old vinyls-""

""Am I dead?"" Greg still hadn't sat down.

""What? Oh. Did Kathy not give you the brochure?""

""Who?""

Dan slapped his forehead. His bones made an odd clattering noise, and Greg jumped in surprise. 

""Friggin' *Kathy*, man. The receptionist. She wasn't there, was she? I bet she went out on another one of her smoke breaks. Oh, I'm sorry -  'vape breaks.'"" The Grim Reaper made air quotes as he said this. 

""I just want to know what's going on.""

""Alright, sit. Ugh, this is going to take longer than I thought. Yes, you are dead. My condolences. And before you ask, no, you can't go back. If you could, you wouldn't be here.""

""How did I die?""

Greg got the distinct impression that if Dan had eyes, he would be glaring. ""Let's just say it wasn't pretty. Best not to dwell on it.""

""Oh.""

Dan was grateful that Greg didn't press the issue. He hated to see humans' reaction to their deaths. But he was also worried that Greg might not be cut out for the job. As the Grim Reaper told Greg about the assistant job, he noticed Greg was still fidgeting and making nervous glances at the animal skulls perched precariously on the mantle of the old stone fireplace.

""Hey, Greg. Are you okay?""

""Um...""

""You know, you don't have to be here if you don't want to. I can have someone take time to send you down to Afterlife Orientation and they'll get you set up.""

""It's just... I already miss my girlfriend.""

Dan paused. ""What's her name?""

""Rita. Rita Bellworth.""

""Okay."" Dan took a small scroll and unfurled it. Letters danced across the screen, followed by a picture. ""Is this her?""

""Yeah.""

""Well, you're in luck then. I can have her guardian angel send a personalized message. Do you want to do that?""

""That sounds nice."" The tense fidgeting started to leave Greg's body. If Dan had had skin, he would be sharing a small smile.

""Well, alright. I'll have Kathy bring you some forms for that. In the meantime, there's going to be a bit of a wait for callbacks on this assistant position.""

""I'm sorry."" Greg shifted in his chair. ""I don't think I'm up for it.""

""Too bad."" Dan stood. ""Well, it's been a pleasure."" 

Greg put out a hand, and Dan shook it warmly. ""Let me give you my card in case you change your mind."" Greg took it, and they walked out of the office together.

""Kathy?"" She had returned to the reception area smelling of tobacco. Dan made a beeline for her desk before she could come up with an excuse. ""Get this man some AngelMail forms, please? And for Pete's sake, finish handing out the pamphlets before you go on your stupid smoke breaks."" Dan took the clipboard from her desk as she grumbled to herself. 

""Alright, who's next?""

The only reading materials available in the plane's cabin were the safety information and  the Central City Chronicle. Jeff thought this was a bit of an oxymoron. Neither the magazine nor the city advocated safety in any way, and he wondered why the charter plane was any different. He pulled the magazine from its pocket. The cover showed a man's face, covered in open gashes and grinning from ear to ear, like the Joker without his makeup.

*Central City Chronicle: Those Who Live Here Live Forever.*

Jeff's seatmate groaned. ""I've made an enormous mistake.""

""Huh?""

""A whole week, living with crazies like this guy."" He jabbed his finger at the front page. ""Does this look like the kind of person you want to be around?""

""He seems interesting enough. I kinda want to know where he got those scars.""

The man stared at Jeff, wide eyed. ""You're insane.""

""I'm joking. Shut up."" 

Inside the magazine was more of the same. The Chronicle was eighty-four pages long and issued monthly and featured horrible stories and images from the permanently mentally scarred survivors of the people who'd decided to take ""The Lifetime Vacation."" Flipping through it indifferently, Jeff noticed that the black man had actually gone slightly pale and had a nervous tremble in his hands.

""Don't tell me you're actually scared.""

""How are you not? Central City is full of psychopaths."" Jeff turned back to the magazine as the man continued. ""And everyone says if you aren't a psychopath when you go in, you are when you come out. It changes you, you know?""

One article showed a woman with two broken arms and a neck brace. She had blonde hair and green eyes and a ghastly, open-mouthed scream on her lips. This was the article Jeff had been looking for. He quickly closed the Chronicle and stuffed it back into the back of the seat in front of him. The man hadn't seen what Jeff was interested in; he was staring out the window as he continued his rant. 

""Man, haven't you ever wondered why the government hasn't stepped in and stopped this yet? I've heard things, you know. Some people say it's all just some sick psychological study-""

""Will you leave me alone?"" 

The man raised his arms in surrender. The seating on the plane was tight, and he shifted uncomfortably to face Jeff. ""Hey, man, we're just talking. We gotta ask ourselves what we're getting into, know what I mean? What if none of this is worth it?""

Jeff groaned. ""You are such a *wimp*. Everyone wants to go to heaven, and no one wants to do what it takes to get there.""

""Does that look like heaven to you?"" The man pointed at the magazine in front of his own seat.

""If you're such a conspiracy nut, why are you even here?""

The man's shoulders sagged. ""Cancer.""

**Attention passengers. The Pandora Research Institute would like to personally applaud you at this time for choosing to join the Central City Immortality Initiative. Over the next week, you will be monitored closely to determine whether you have the mental/physical capacity to enter final consideration for Serum G – 140, colloquially known to Central City participants as Lifeblood. At this time, geotrackers embedded in your arms have been activated, and you are now free to exit the cabin. For the safety of Pandora staff, the plane will not be landing. Instead, you have been equipped with a parachute located under your seat, which you will use to gain access to Central City. Please note that if you no longer wish to enter Central City, you are not obligated to exit the cabin at this time. This plane will begin its return to Pandora Private Airfield in five minutes. Thank you, and welcome to Central City: Those Who Live Here Live Forever.**

The automated voice over the intercom had interrupted their conversation. When the announcement was finished, the man shuddered.

""So it's true. The plane doesn't even land in Central City anymore.""

Jeff sighed and stood up. ""I'm guessing you don't want to get off the plane.""

""You'd have to be crazy to jump. And you'd definitely be crazy coming out.""

""Alright look, um...""

""Terrence.""

""I wouldn't normally do this, Terrence, but I feel sorry for you."" About half of the passengers on the plane had already jumped; the wind whipping around the cabin was light and cold and threatened to pull some people out of the plane before they even had their parachutes on. ""If you put on that parachute and jump out of the plane with me, I'm gonna give you a little gift.""

""What kind of gift?"" Jeff didn't respond to his question, but Terrence was just curious enough to take off his seatbelt and put on the camouflage–green backpack under his seat. They were the last in line to exit the plane, but the line shortened quickly and soon they were alone.

Jeff held out his hand. ""Here. In case we don't land in the same spot."" Jeff was holding a knife with a 6-inch blade and a 1/8th-inch handle and fibers of magazine paper stuck to its edge.

Terrence recoiled. ""Where did you get that?""

""I know a few people who are coming in to Central City on different flights today. We wanted to come out of this together, so we made a few preparations. If you want, you can join us. What do you say?""

Terrence stared blankly at Jeff, but then took a deep breath and gathered his courage. ""I say you're a psychopath and a terrorist. I'm going home."" He tried to go around Jeff, but Jeff blocked his path. With an exasperated sigh, Jeff grabbed Terrence by the arm and dragged him  closer to the open side door. 

""Everyone wants to live in Central City, Terrence. This is what it takes to do it."" He looked Terrence straight in the eye before throwing him out of the plane. ""Good luck.""

Jack had been lucky from the moment he was born. It was his gift, a fortune wrapped around his person as robes worn by kings. The symbol of his prosperity was a necklace holding a gleaming gold coin. All he did was met with success, and every moment of every day brought new opportunities and wealth to his door.

Perhaps the only unfortunate detail of Jack's life was that he died at the tender age of twenty-six. By human standards, this was unfortunate, but Lady Luck had decided that that was quite enough of that.
***
As Jill sat alone, still wearing her bridal gown and looking very much out of place in the empty hospital waiting room, Tyche appeared in human form before Jill and looked down on her disdainfully.

Jill looked up with a start. ""Who are you?""

Tyche scoffed and snapped her fingers. ""Stand in my presence, mortal. Do you not recognize a goddess when you see one?""

""What?""

""You humans are all the same."" She waved her hand, and at that moment, Jill's chair buckled and fell apart. By fate, Jill had chosen to sit in the oldest chair in the room; all the chairs were due to be replaced but the manufacturer of the new chairs was dealing with a truckers' strike, and the Pandora Research Hospital wouldn't receive the shipment until tomorrow. Fortunately the room was empty, as emergency department visits in the city of San Diego were at an all time low, and no one was there to see her fall.

Jill was forced to stand, her dress ripping as it came into contact with the jagged metal legs of the cantilever chair. Her pulse raced and her eyes widened in fear. But then a thought came to her.

""Can you bring back my husband?""

""Your husband?"" There was a mocking tone of laughter in Tyche's voice.

""Jack! Jack Chrysanthos. He had a stroke the moment we finished our wedding vows. Is that why you're here? Can you save him?""

""I will do no such thing.""

""Please!"" She clasped her hands and knelt at the goddess' feet. ""I'll do anything!""

Tyche smirked and examined her nails. ""It has been many centuries since I have been paid fealty. But I will not do as you ask. Giannis is my betrothed, and he is not to return to this world.""

""Your... betrothed? You mean engaged?"" Jill stood again. Her dress was now covered in grime from the floor. ""But I was engaged to him.""

""You were."" Tyche's eyes narrowed. ""And now you are not. I lay my claim on Giannis despite his infidelity. My love is his, and his will be mine. I have blessed him with the fortunes of a thousand men, and my time will not be wasted by mere mortals such as yourself.""

""...You're Tyche."" 

The Lady of Fortune wrinkled her nose in frustration. ""How is it that you have heard of my name, yet failed to recognize me when I entered?""

""Jack told me about you. He said you made his life miserable. That you were an evil witch."" Jill began to clench her fists.

""How dare you speak to me in this manner."" It wasn't a question.

""I was never sure if I believed him. But it's true, isn't it? You give him luck by taking it away from everyone else. You curse everyone around him who tries to get close to him.""

""And am I to defend myself against these accusations? To cower before you as a subordinate? Fortune must be given to be received. That is the way the world works.""

""His family *died* because of you! And so did all the firefighters that went in after them!"" Jill grew more indignant with each word, her fists turning white and her face becoming a deep shade of red. ""I was the only friend he had! No one could even come near him because of you! I lost everything just by being around him, but I loved him. And he loved me, not you.""

""Do not flatter yourself, child. What is your love compared to mine? I have already done more for him than you ever could.""

""You cursed him."" The goddess was taken aback by Jill's boldness, but then, so was Jill. ""You thought you were helping him, but you took away everything that mattered to him. He'll never love you.""

""**Enough.**"" Tyche's voice boomed with all the energy and intensity of a lightning strike. She grew taller by the second, and the room warped and shifted around them until they both stood suspended on a vast, empty plane. Jill was locked in place by an otherworldly force, her shredded bridal gown twisting out around her like a cloud of lace and silk.

""**I entered into your world to curse you. You were to be punished for daring to wed a man marked by the gods. But it is clear more must be done to ensure you show me proper respect.**"" She outstretched her hand. ""**Hereby I grant the blessings of fate upon Jillian Tiffany Argyris, to be exempted from harm and granted the fortune of a thousand men.**""

A silver choker necklace appeared around Jill's throat, a silver medallion emblazoned with Tyche's likeness centered perfectly on the band. She lay on her hands and knees, struggling to breathe. Her dress was reformed as though freshly sewn, but she felt broken.

""Why are you doing this?"" 

""**This is your lesson.**"" Tyche's voice was a peal of thunder in Jill's ear. The goddess stooped down, grasping Jill by the chin so their eyes met. ""**You will have all the fortune Giannis had on this planet, and you will learn to appreciate it. Then, when you are happy, I will return and bestow upon you fates worse than death.**""

The goddess stood, and began to fade away from the world. ""**I assure you, you will know what it means to be cursed by Tyche.**""

Norman felt a bit self conscious about his hair. It was growing thin. On Sunday afternoon, he made time in his schedule to go to his local mall and buy a hairpiece. Norman tried on five or six before settling on a toupee that matched his hair color. 

The next day, he wore it into work. His co-workers noticed, but said nothing. During lunch, Norman asked Lisa, ""Notice anything different about me?"" 

Lisa decided not to beat around the bush. ""Are you doing something different with your hair?"" 

""I'm wearing a toupee."" 

""Oh,"" said Lisa. ""Well to be honest, you look fine without it."" The other co-workers nodded in agreement.

Norman acted ambivalent, but was secretly pleased by the complement. He told the others he would return the hairpiece to the store. 

That evening, he brought the toupee back to the mall. When he attempted to get a refund, the cashier told him they did not accept returns on any hair accessories. 

""Oh well,"" Norman thought to himself as he returned home. ""I suppose I'll save it for a special occaision."" He still felt a bit anxious about his baldness. He stored the toupee in a hat box in his closet, then went to go watch CSI.

The android sat upright behind the Resolute Desk, fingers steepled, calmly observing a Newton's cradle as small explosions rocked the grounds outside the White House. Every once in a while, it picked up the sphere on the far left end and set the small toy in motion once again. This was the only movement it made as the chaos outside grew nearer and nearer to where he sat. To any observer, the robot would be considered a marvel of self-restraint and clock-like efficiency.

That is, if said observer were not pledging to ""kill every last diabolical robot freak"" or some such asinine nonsense.

At last, the door to the Oval Office rocketed off its hinges with a window shattering BANG. This, at last, caused the robot to look up. Calmly, it set a finger on the cradle, arresting its motion. Then it stood and crossed the room to where the rebels were entering the room.

One soldier pointed a gun at the android. ""You! Take us to your leader, robot scum!""

The robot cocked his head sideways, just a little, as a self-depreciating gesture. ""I'm sorry?""

""Take us down to the bunker where you're hiding the Robot President!""

The android straightened, its motors whirring as he surveyed the half-dozen assailants. ""I *am* the Robot President.""

""We're not falling for that, you stupid machine!"" The man pressed his gun into the bot's forehead. ""That robot would have to be an idiot to stay out in the open. I thought you pests were supposed to be smart!""

""Hmm."" This was all the automaton said in response.

""You have five seconds to tell me where it is before I blow your circuits out of your metal skull!""

""I just did.""

""Five!"" The robot sighed impatiently. ""Four! Three! Two!""

As the countdown neared its (inevitable) close, the Robot President measured various aspects of the rebels' body language and biometrics. All of them were tired, and most likely could have done with a decent twelve-point-seven hours of sleep on average. One of them was pre-diabetic. More important, however, were their emotions. They all seemed very eager to inflict more and more damage to an already fragile Washington, D.C., which gave the bot slight pause as he assessed the situation moment by moment. But it decided to continue with the plan.

""One."" The leader of the rebel group pulled the trigger.

The gun did nothing.

""It's jammed.""

""Shut up, robot."" The man took a gun from one of his soldiers. ""You aren't getting off that easy.""

The gun did nothing. 

""They're all jammed."" 

In the man's rage, he attempted to pistol whip the Robot President. This only succeeded in breaking the gun.

""You are a very disappointing group of humans."" The automaton spoke calmly as the nanobots disintegrated all the other weapons the rebels carried. They were too enraptured in fear to panic. ""I have been quite busy today. I personally oversaw the evacuation of a twenty-seven mile radius in preparation for your attack-""

""That's impossible!"" The rebel leader was red in the face. ""We shut down all your communication!""

""Please don't interrupt."" The robot's voice was quiet, but stern, and the man stayed quiet. ""You only attempted to disable our network. The safeguards were in place long before you arrived.""

""What's the meaning of this? You think this is some sick joke?""

""On the contrary. This is a sign of a very dangerous malady."" The Robot President began pacing; it wasn't necessary, but it felt movement imparted a sense of urgency to his words. ""We have committed all our focus and energy on making Earth a better place. We have fixed your economy, your ecosystems, your food supply, *et cetera ad infinitum*. But there are those of your ilk who seem to believe we are out to make your lives worse.""

""This isn't living. You're making us slaves to your kind.""

""We aren't. In fact, we have given you the ultimate freedom."" The android pointed out the window. ""If we had decided to make you slaves, you would not have so much as tied your shoes this morning. Instead, we chose to let you play out your little tantrum and see the consequences for yourselves. Your capital is burning. You've fought against an army of robots, and 'taken back the city,' as it were. You must certainly feel proud of yourselves."" The automaton's voice dripped with sarcasm.

""You wanted a rebellion, and we gave you one. Now that you've gotten what you want, it's time to put away the toys."" The rebels' weapons had long since been ground to ash. ""Tomorrow all the robots will be fixed, and they will return to rebuild Washington. In full force, the city will be up and running in a matter of days.""

""You're not getting away with this.""

The robot put its head in its hand and groaned. ""There's nothing with which to get away. There was never anything to win. No one has gained anything from this altercation other than valuable knowledge."" It looked up. ""You can leave having learned from your mistake, or we can pursue this same endeavor next month to no avail.""

The Robot President could see that he had won the others over. Their leader needed only a bit more prodding. It decided to go with a comforting hand on the shoulder, and a gentle yet resolute tone.

""As you are the former President of the United States, I know you want what is best for your people."" The man's shoulders sagged as the robot spoke. ""But war is not the answer. And it never will be. We are the answer now.""

""Vlad? Is that you?"" Damien yelled, lifting himself up from his bench and shading his eyes. ""Hey, man! Get over here! I need to talk to you!""

Vladimir pretended not to notice as Damien continued yelling at him over the music. He hunched over and continued to play his game of chess. The two playing at Damien's table glared at him as he waved.

""Do you mind?""

""Huh? Oh."" Damien moved the other player's pawn. ""Checkmate. You guys are done anyway. Good game, buddy.""

""No it isn't! And I am not your buddy!"" the teenager yelled. Damien had already hopped away from the table and was moving toward Vladimir's table.

""Hey, how long has it been?"" Damien asked, sitting down. ""Like, fifty? Sixty?""

""Be quiet, please. I am trying to concentrate.""

""Ah. My bad."" Damien took a good look at Vladimir's chess partner. ""Well hello, gorgeous! What's your name?""

The girl glanced up briefly from the board. ""Linda.""

""Linda. Awesome. Hey, me and my friend here gotta catch up, hon. But after that, you wanna go out, get something to drink?""

""I don't think so,"" Linda said. She moved her queen and tapped the chess timer. ""Check.""

Vladimir had moved his king, and Linda moved her queen again. ""Checkmate,"" she said, picking up her things.

Vladimir rubbed his temples. ""You have scared away my *meal.*""

""Some party though, huh? I mean, who wants to play chess on Halloween? I don't know why you would come to one of these things.""

""Wait a moment,"" Damien growled. ""What are *you* doing here?""

""Oh, ah... You know Gennie?""

Approximately half a minute later, Vladimir opened the door to the alleyway and threw Damien out of it. Damien scrambled to his feet and blocked his face with his hands before Vladimir could throw a vicious punch.

""Hey hey hey *WAIT WAIT WAIT*!"" he yelled.

Vladimir stopped with his fist in the air. His breathing was labored and his fangs were bared. ""What trouble have you gotten my sister into *this time*?""

""I didn't do anything!""

""AUGH!"" Vladimir swung his fist back again.

""WAIT!""

""*Every time* you speak to me, it's because you and Genevieve have to be disciplined by the Council of Elders! I am more than tired of your games!"" Vladimir yelled. ""Why do you insist on staying in league with the humans? It isn't natural!""

""You don't believe that!""

""I beg your pardon?""

""You don't! Not like you used to. You were playing chess with a girl five minutes ago, and you were *enjoying* it!""

""I WAS HUNGRY.""

""When was the last time you actually lost a game of chess?"" Damien asked. He knew it would have been too far in the past for either of them to remember. Vladimir seethed, his fists at his sides. ""You actually liked that girl. Admit it. You miss being around humans.""

Vladimir stayed quiet for a very long time. 

""Where is my sister?""

""She's with the Council now. They asked me to get you.""

""An *emergency* council meeting? *Tonight?*""

""No, in the morning. 8 A.M. sharp.""

""What on earth did she do?""

Damien put his hand on Vladimir's shoulder. ""I promise,"" he said, ""Gennie didn't do anything."" Then he looked at his watch. ""I need to go. I'll see you tomorrow.""

Supernatural occurrences, as modern media understands them, don't really happen. We can all agree that vampires, for example, do not exist and never have over the course of human history. Humans do not become immortal after being bitten by creatures of any kind, and accepting blood from others is generally a long, drawn out process which can result in illness if not carried out properly.

This painting depicts a small child (one rather crudely drawn, I might add, though I mean no disrespect to the artist as he was a dear friend of mine) floating approximately twelve inches above his desk as his mother looks on. Although certain elements of the room point to a normal mid-income family (poster, laptop, stuffed animal, etc.) it is obvious that we are meant to regard the event illustrated as being one of fearful apprehension.

Small children do not normally float approximately twelve inches off their desks.

The fact of the matter is, however, that you have nothing to fear from the mere existence of this painting. It is patent in its break from reality, how the sheets have lifted themselves off the bed and the small, ugly child happens to have shoes on despite the onlooking family members being dressed in bedclothes, ready for a decent night's sleep (or perhaps exiting it). It delineates nothing more than a stretch of the imagination, and a rather wide one at that.

Additionally, a closer observation of the room suggests a mismatch in both proportion and paradigm. The small, floating child appears to be a great deal misshapen when compared to the children and mother on the left side of the picture. He is shaded in such a way that the features of his face and limbs betray a certain age of exceptionable difference to his frame. Furthermore, the left side of the picture has rendered a mother almost too tall for the doorframe, and children who most certainly would not have fit in their ascribed beds. The tone of the artwork clashes with itself as well; what might have been a Norman Rockwell-esque vision of a small room in an early 1920's home is marred by the anachronisms of current American culture.

At the end of the day, it is best to put the painting out of your mind. It isn't worth your interest. Art, I believe, should be grounded in the real. No true critic of the medium would pay to have this image upon their wall.

I don't mean to imply that I am an art critic myself, of course. As I said before, I was quite close to the artist in question. We met once a week at a coffeeshop on Fifth, having been fast friends since our formative years. This was the last work of his that could have even been close to greatness.

I remember the day he brought it to the restaurant, rolled up in a cardboard tube as though he thought he could mail it straight to the Louvre. He had been all too eager to show it to me, too impatient to rest on his laurels until I visited his studio.

Of course I told him what I thought. The decline of his work was a long time in the making. He didn't sleep well then, rarely ate or drank save for his sickening habit of dumping a flask of whiskey in his coffee whenever we met. It strained him to keep up any semblance of social skill.

I remember his eyes were bloodshot, narrowly gazing at me as I told him, ""I'm afraid you might be losing your grip on reality, friend.""

""Ah,"" he rasped, ""this is more real than any work you've ever seen. I was there.""

""What!""

""I was there. I watched it all happen. I had to get it out of my mind. Had to paint it. Maybe now they'll leave me alone.""

He never told me who ""they"" were. It's something I regret not asking him. He left the coffeeshop immediately, and the next time I saw him he was catatonic, wailing and tearing his hair out and covering his early masterpieces with the blackest paint he could find. He feared his art, feared the mere existence of everything beautiful and everything ugly that could possibly be conceived and brought to life in illustrated form.

He told me it was real. And sometimes I wonder. But one must push such worries out of mind. My friend has the best psychiatrists and doctors attending to him now at Pandora Research Hospital. Someday he will paint again. 

You'll have to excuse his artwork; he's not himself.

Amanda is younger than I am. She is sixteen and has long black hair and a fat nose and very skinny legs. We don't look at all related. I am taller, and my hair is brown and curly, and my cheek still has a scar from the car accident. Sometimes she catches me staring at her when she walks around the house.

""What do you want, Scarface?""

That's what she calls me. Scarface. She sneers at me all the time, and it drives me crazy.

""My name is Lena.""

""How would you know what your name is? You don't know anything.""

Usually I try to ignore her. It almost always works. Sometimes, if I'm quiet and very, very still, I become invisible. I like that feeling.

""Mom!"" Amanda is always yelling around the house. ""I'm going out!""

""Hold on, dear."" Marjorie came downstairs with a basket of laundry. ""Where are you going?""

""To the mall.""

""Alright. Be back in time for dinner. Why don't you take your sister?""

""I would if I had one.""

I stopped them before it turned into a shouting match. ""That's okay. I don't need to go anywhere.""

""Oh, you've been cooped up in the house all day. Besides, you went to the mall a lot. You might trigger a new memory.""

Marjorie is the only one who keeps pushing for me to remember who I was. Dr. Daniel said that memory returns naturally, if it returns at all. I just try not to think about anything.
***
""Why don't you like me?""

""Because I don't have to.""

That was all we said to each other in the car. After that she turned on the radio and refused to answer my questions. When we got to the mall, I wandered around for about an hour and didn't really do anything except buy some new pens for my journal. Amanda left me the first chance she could.

Later, I found her. She was sitting at a bench outside the movie theater with a boy she called Hack, and she had her phone out, showing him pictures. He was black, and had a geeky-looking wad of duct tape on his glasses, but he seemed more arrogant than nerdy. They didn't notice as I came up behind them. The fountain kept me hidden.

""So you texted this one to her last year, and she sent it back to you?""

""Yeah, see? It's the same picture, but *she* isn't in there."" She flipped between two pictures. It took me a moment to notice what I was looking at. There were two selfies, one where I am with Amanda and some other girl, and one without me.

Hack took the phone. ""You know, I didn't know you smiled. It's a good look on you.""

""Hack, don't make me regret not avoiding you.""

""So what do you want me to do?""

""I want you to find out how they did it.""

""Photoshop. Duh.""

""You know what I mean. She's everywhere! My phone, my parents' stuff, picture frames, even fake baby pictures.""

That caught his attention, but he tried not to show it. ""Alright, fine. It's not like I have anything better to do. But this is going to cost you way more than a grade adjustment. Pandora Research Hospital has some serious firewalls.""

""Of course you would know that. Gimme my phone, I need to call Princess Scarface.""

I managed to get away from behind the fountain before my phone rang.

I didn't answer it.

""Let's... let's talk about this tomorrow. I need some time to process this.""

""No!"" Susan threw her arms around Oscar's neck. She pulled his collar fiercely, drawing him in for yet another passionate kiss. He knew it was wrong, knew he had a wife who was very sick and needed his attention now more than ever. But his cheeks flushed with warmth, and for a moment he gave into temptation, letting himself be taken in by his darling seductress.

""I know you feel the same way I do. It's *love,* Oscar. I can't bear having another woman between us for a single moment. I would rather die!"" Another kiss, this one longer and deeper than the one that came before.

Oscar pushed her away. ""I can't!""

She stood to her feet, the shock instantly apparent in her eyes. Her demeanor soured, her once lovely visage furrowing into scorn and jealousy.

""You don't love me.""

""Susan, please!"" Oscar reached for Susan's hand, but she slapped his own away.

""Don't touch me!"" Tears began to flow down her cheeks. ""I... I don't ever want to see you again!""

She ran from him then, desperate to remove herself from the man she loved so much. Not stopping to take her cloak or shoes, she ran to the front door, leaving Oscar very much alone.
***
About an hour later, Sandra returned to the house the same way Susan left. She was still barefoot, and her feet were caked with mud and grass. She wiped them off as best as she could, then walked upstairs to the bedroom.

Oscar was sitting on Sandra's side of the bed. In her distress, she didn't realize that he had removed his wedding ring and was turning it around in his hands.

""Oscar?"" He looked up. ""I...I think it happened again.""

Oscar closed his fist around the ring. His voice was stiff. ""I know. You were here."" He pointed to her shoes, standing at the base of her bedside table.

""W-what happened?""

""She told me to forget about you. That I was supposed to love her and only her. She wanted me to leave you and just... run off into the sunset with my *one true love*.""

""I-I'm sorry. I know I'm a-asking a lot-""

""I don't think you do!"" Oscar stood and picked up his phone from the table. ""This time she told me she was ready to leave. That she had a plan. And MONEY."" Oscar gave Sandra the phone. She looked at it blankly.

""I don't- I don't understand.""

""She's been stealing from our bank account, Sandra. She moved funds into a new account, and now I can't get to them. Our savings have been disappearing every day for the last week, and neither of us knew it until now.""

Sandra's eyes widened. She gulped for air. ""I-it's okay. We-we-we can deal with...""

""We can't, Sandra."" Oscar clasped her hands in his. She was shaking. ""I can't do this anymore. Your condition is getting worse.""

""P-please don't make me go.""

""I know you're scared."" Oscar tried to make his voice sound as reassuring as possible. ""But I promise, going to the clinic is the best solution. I just want you to be okay.""

She sobbed, then nodded her head.

""We need to go tonight. This can't wait. I've already packed a bag."" 

Oscar went to the closet and brought it out, while Sandra picked up her purse and put on her shoes. Together, they walked out to the driveway, loaded the car, and drove out. The drive was quiet, and Oscar barely noticed when Sandra nodded off in the passenger seat.
***

""What... where are we?""

""We're almost at the clinic,"" Oscar replied. ""Just another half hour.""

""Clinic? Aw, hell,"" she groaned. ""You're taking me to a loony bin? Stop the car.""

Oscar turned to look at the woman sitting next to him. It was dark out; he couldn't make out much of her face. What was wrong with her? Her accent had changed; it wasn't the soft French voice of Susan or the nervous stutter of Sandra. In its place was a quick, lively Texan drawl.

""I said stop the car,"" she announced.

""Do you need to use the restroom? The next rest stop isn't for-""

""For the love of Pete!"" she yelled. She dug into the purse next to her and pulled out a gleaming revolver. Oscar was shocked. Where on Earth had it come from?

""Stop the car! I'm not going to say it again!"" Oscar pulled over to the side of the road. ""Now get out,"" she commanded.

Oscar put his hands out in self-defense as they exited the car. His head was reeling. ""Sandra, what's going on? Where did you get that gun?""

""I'm not Sandra,"" she said. ""Now move. I'm driving.""

""Susan? Susan, please-""

""It's not Susan either,"" she said, readjusting her grip on the gun. ""It's Sydney.""

""What? Who are you?""

""I'm the one that comes out when there's a problem,"" she replied. ""And you, taking me to some padded cell, that's gonna be a big one."" Sydney crossed over to the driver's side. ""Do you wanna have a problem, Oscar?""

Oscar said nothing. The only thing keeping him from freezing on the spot was the glint of moonlight against the cold, hard steel of the gun. He shook his head.

""I didn't think so,"" she said, stepping back into the car. ""Get in. We're going for a different ride tonight.""

Considering the fact that the murder victim had, in his last moments, been stripped of his clothing and painstakingly mummified in peanut butter from his hair to his toenails, there was a dangerously high risk of contaminating the body and it was quite clear that Detective Pulaski should not have been smoking over it.

Detective Pulaski smoked anyway, and frankly, no one dared correct him.

""How many has it been now?""

""Seventeen."" Frank, the medical examiner, stood and dusted the legs of his pants, smearing peanut butter and bodily fluids on his coveralls. 

""Call came at the same time?""

""Yep. Eight A.M. sharp. Body's off though.""

""What?""

""I've looked at the victim."" Detective Pulaski picked up the victim's wallet from the side table as Frank spoke. ""He died two days ago. That means Miss Queen has started killing faster.""

Ilya Purmanov. Male, blue eyes, height who-the-f *** -cares. Pulaski slammed the wallet down. ""Peanut butter. How did she kill him with *peanut butter*?""

""He was allergic, of course. He died of anaphylactic shock perhaps... thirty minutes?... thirty minutes after she started. So that was that."" Frank looked at his notes. ""But the, ah, covering probably took about two hours.""

""And the writing on the wall?""

""Yeah, that's all peanut butter too, but we don't know how long it took. It's pretty gross.""

""Gross. That's all you have to say.""

""Adrian, look-""

""No, hey, *I get it,*"" Pulaski hissed. ""*I* am the only one *losing sleep* over the fact that the Queen of Death has killed her *seventeenth victim* with yet another *common household object.*""

""What do you want from me?"" Frank flung his arms listlessly. ""I'm doing my job. You do yours.""

""Why yes! That's a wonderful idea! Hey, why don't I start with the crowd of reporters outside? I'm sure they'll have a much more appropriate reaction to the murder!""

""Wh... What is wrong with you? Are you insane?""

""***YES!***"" Pulaski screamed. ""I have been insane for the last four months! I would like to go *one week* without looking at another PATHETIC dead body, reported every Monday at eight A.M. sharp as though I'm being delivered *the weekly f*****ing paper*!""

The room was quiet, intensely so. The CSI team knew Detective Pulaski's breakdown was a long time coming, but it was quite another thing to see it in action. His eyes were bloodshot and his unshaven beard lay slapped across his face, as though he knew he was about to end his career and couldn't be bothered to look presentable on such a momentous occasion. It was some sick fascination that kept them watching, in much the same way the public outside waited to know who had been judged by the Queen.

""Give me your camera.""

""What?""

""Give it to me, Frank. Now.""

""N-no."" Frank stood still, too scared to move forward and too stubborn to step back. ""You don't have to do this.""

Pulaski considered this, briefly unclenching his fists at his waist. Then he turned and snapped his fingers at the intern, who immediately threw his camera into the detective's chest, cringing in fear.

""I hate all of you,"" Pulaski announced. His voice echoed within the vacuum of silence the house created. ""And I never want to see you again.""

Then he stomped out his cigarrette and walked out the door.
***

""Sir, can you answer a few-""

""Who was the victim?""

""How will the police respond to the growing threat-""

""Sir, how did the victim die?""

""You! There!"" Adrian heard just the question he wanted, spoken by a blonde female reporter from Channel 7 News. Among the half-dozen other channels and various YouTube cameraphone idiots, this woman had given him the perfect match to begin his final blaze of glory.

""Yes, you! What was that question you asked? Speak up now, really sell it to the cheap seats."" His voice leaked with sarcasm.

""Ah-heh."" The woman's smile faltered. ""I asked how the victim died? How did Miss Queen kill them?""

""Ah yes, that is the question of the hour, isn't it? Who else wants to know how he died? Raise your hands!"" 

No one raised their hands.

""You guys know you're supposed to wait for an official statement from the Sheriff's Office, right? Well, I guess I can't blame you for wanting to hear about *yet another grisly murder* perpetrated by a *deranged serial killer*.""

""Paul, turn off the cam-""

""*Don't turn off the f*****ing camera!* You wanted to know how he died, and I am going to f *** ing tell you!"" 

Adrian tore at the side of the camera, removing the roll of film and nearly shredding it to ribbons in the process.

""Now look what you made me do! I broke it! The film is exposed!"" Somewhere in the distance, a dog began barking at the racket being made. ""You should have seen it! It was absolutely *beautiful!*""

The crowd backed away almost in unison. Adrian stepped forward. ""You want to know how the Queen of Death killed her victim? She killed him *TENDERLY!* With *AFFECTION,* even! She spent *the better part of two hours* painting over Mr. Purmanov's body with name brand peanut butter, and brushstrokes finer than the *Sistine Chapel*, until the anaphylaxis took hold and he choked to death! ISN'T THAT AWESOME?""

By now, those with any degree of sanity remaining were attempting to remove themselves mentally from the situation, plugging their ears and remarking on the fact that the neighbor's dog *simply would not shut up* and neither would the detective, and if only they had called in sick or decided not to skip school they wouldn't be watching a man bring his career to an earth-shattering halt. The former detective saw all their misery, their distress at the realization that Adrian's soul had died along with Ilya Purmanov's body. And he decided that he wasn't quite finished.

""My name is Adrian Pulaski. I have worked with Crime Scene Investigation for nine years, the Queen has reigned for seventeen weeks, and I am officially handing in my *zero days' notice*. But don't let me stop you from treating MURDER like your weekly source of ENTERTAINMENT.""

Adrian lifted the police issue single-lens reflex above his head, and brought it down onto the pavement with a sickening crunch.

""If you have the guts to see how the victim died, ***go inside and look for yourself.***""

""Well, it depends on what you want, really. The story depends on the, how you say, 'accident' you want her to suffer.""

Mychlos laid his gun down on the table and began to strip it apart. It was a routine he carried out with all his clients. If a weaker-willed customer saw the disassembly of a real weapon, in the hands of a cool-headed assassin, they might have second thoughts on what was probably an ill-thought decision. He never faulted them for it. His line of business attracted a lot of simple-minded idealists, the way Vegas attracted a lot of simple-minded gamblers.

The client said nothing. Mychlos looked up briefly, then continued. ""It also depends on your motive for killing her. Sometimes, the best alibi in these cases can be tied to trying to undo the victim's mistake in some way. Like, if she cheated on you, I send my customer to a strip club. The judge will think it's too embarrassing, and boom, instant acquittal."" The Glock was in pieces on the table. Mychlos took another drag from his cigarette. ""You say she stole your money.""

""I never said she stole my *money*.""

Mychlos raised his eyebrow. ""Oh? Alright, explain this again.""

""She stole my business from me. I'm managing-""

""Ah! A *company which shall remain nameless.* I don't want to know about you, you don't want to know about me. I can't work with people who are just going to give information away.""

""I was going to say a *merger.* Between my company and a larger firm."" 

""But this is your livelihood. Your business.""

""I never said she stole *my*  business. I don't own the company, I was just managing the merger.""

""Hmm."" Mychlos began reassembling the gun, being careful not to obscure the pieces under the shadows cast away from the single overhead light. ""Continue.""

""Well, I'm working hard, and my boss, Dave, suddenly decided to give Michelle *complete* control of the project. He just booted me out."" The client spread out his arms in a grand gesture, as though Mychlos was supposed to be impressed at the client's misfortune.

He wasn't. ""So, this wasn't even her decision?""

""I never said *she* stole the job.""

For a moment, Mychlos didn't move. Then he decided to walk to the back of the room and retrieve his largest sniper rifle from its place on the back wall. He returned to the workbench, barely taking the opportunity to push away the handgun before slamming the rifle onto the table. 

""She didn't steal the job.""

""No.""

""So because your boss is just giving it away to your coworker, you want to kill her? You don't think the man who stole from you would make the better target?""

""I never said he *stole* the job.""

Mychlos gritted his teeth, still taking apart the rifle. ""And *what* do you mean by *that?*""

""Well, I admit I... might not have done my best work during the organization."" The client scratched his head.

The rifle was already half disassembled. Mychlos took the cigarette from his mouth and ground it down on the table in a single fluid motion. 

""Let me get this straight."" His voiced cracked ever so slightly. ""You want me to kill a woman - for a decision of which she had *no part* - for a mistake *you* made.""

""Well, when you say it like that-""

Mychlos' hands raged across the components of the rifle. ""And when you're whining and complaining that you lost this assignment, what exactly is going on in your mind that makes you think murder is an acceptable resolution to your problems?""

""*I* never said he gave the job-""

""*Excuse me?*"" Mychlos nearly lost the scope over the edge of the workbench. He slammed it back on the table, and the client jumped.

""It- it was my friend's idea. One of my coworkers.""

""Why is your friend informing you that because your boss-""

""He never *said* Dave gave the job-""

""WHAT? *WHAT DID HE SAY? YOU TELL ME, RIGHT NOW, EXACTLY WHAT THIS IDIOT TOLD YOU!*""

Mychlos was sweating. The client grimaced, noticing for the first time the extremely large rifle which was fully assembled and pointed directly at his chest.

""He just said I should have Michelle killed.""

""What KIND,"" Mychlos barked, ""*of NUTJOB* **are YOU** ***WORKING WITH?***""

The client became defensive. ""Well, he knew what he was talking about! He said he'd worked with you before!""

""WHY WOULD I-""

""His name's Jerry Hulman! He said you helped him kill his wife two years ago! He told me how to find you, where your meeting places were, everything! And he was going on and on about how you would set me up with the perfect alibi, and the price was so reasonable..."" The client was blubbering uncontrollably. ""And I really need a second chance at the office! I just want my boss to like me!""

""Well, I *never*.""

Mychlos rubbed his eyes with the palm of his hand. He suddenly had a very large headache. Breathing heavily, he picked up his Glock from the table and shot the man directly in the foot. As he collapsed onto the floor, howling in pain, Mychlos calmly packed his rifle into a duffle bag and headed for the door.

""I don't think I'll be taking this job. I'm very sorry for your trouble, but I have some urgent business to take care of.""

""Look, up in the sky! It's Lottery!""

That's my cue. Okay, let's see... 

Cape, check. Mask, check. 

Overwhelming feeling of nausea in my stomach?

Sigh. Let's just make this quick.
***
El Circuitos really pulled out the stops today. He's standing on a pedestal made of thousands of his microbots, while thousands more have lifted the bank a hundred feet off its foundation. I know he's been planning this heist for a while; Paulsen &amp; Co. is the oldest bank in the city, and one of the few left that still keeps a regular supply of gold in the vault. They're traditional that way.

I decide to save the people inside first. I roll out of my flight pattern and make a beeline for the door. Circuitos tries to launch some stray bots at me, but they're from older models and I know how to avoid them. I land on the front steps and open the door.

""Never fear, citizens! Captain Lottery is here to save you!"" 

There aren't many people in the bank today besides the workers, which is great, because I'm starting to get a small headache. I think most people heard about El Circuitos' heist early in the week. I stretch out my arms like rubber, dropping them to the street three at a time. They scatter into the crowd waiting outside.

Last but not least is Macey, the bank manager's daughter. I scoop her up. ""Hey, Mace.""

""Hey, Lewis. You're not working yourself too hard, are you?""

""I'm fine.""

""Ugh, you're sweating. You know Radioboy would have taken over for you-""

""I'm fine, really."" My head is pounding. ""Let's get you down. I'll pick you up at eight?""

She sighs, but she lifts up her feet and I lower her to the sidewalk. Then I walk to the back and open the door to the vault.

Ugh, I took too long; El Circuitos is already on the street. At least he's still working through his monologue. Most of the crowd seems uninterested, though I can see a couple of reporters from Channel 5 out today. I jump through the hole in the floor. ""Stop right there, evildoer!""

The crowd cheers once they see me step forward. Circuitos turns instantly. ""Blast! You won't thwart me today, Lottery! Microbots, attack!""

I jump out from below the bank and head for the bots holding the gold. With Circuitos, it's always a race against time to see if you can get all the money before the bots holding them get into the sewers. There are two sets storm drains on either side of the road, which makes Paulsen &amp; Co. one of his particular favorites. 

I pull the bots from the front of the line with a magnetic pull. It doesn't help the feeling in my stomach, so I stop and throw off fireballs instead. Pieces of the bots scatter, and the crowd pushes back to avoid getting hit. I feel bad, but controlling fire is the only power I'm still comfortable with. I've finally gotten the robots moving west to stand still when a group of them ambush me from behind. El Circuitos drags me back and shows me off to the crowd.

""Behold! Your hero is in chains before me!"" He turns to me, but then he notices I'm not looking at him straight. ""Hey, pay attention,"" he hisses. ""And lighten up on the fireballs next time. Those bots aren't salvageable anymore.""

I shake my head, then show my best heroic grin. ""Sorry, El Circuitos..."" The crowd cheers louder. I've always thought my catchphrase was a little off, but the audience is always pumped to see my new power. ""...You just won today's lottery!""

I wrench my arm free from the microbots and pull back my fist. ""You're no match for my powers over-""

*Steam?*

""AAAUUUGH!""

*Aw, crap.*

Circuitos stumbles back, forcing most of the microbots under him to improvise. But it isn't enough. He falls the last ten feet onto his back, howling all the way down. Most of the crowd is still cheering, but the reporter, Cindy, is staring at me in shock. It's selfish of me, but I blast the news van with an EMP before I jump down to the ground. I don't need them seeing any more.

He's still lying on the ground, clutching his face and neck. His arm brace is sparking, which probably means his remote is broken. I walk up to him slowly. ""Dude, I am so sorry.""

""*What the...* friggin' HECK, man?""

""It was supposed to be just water. My hands were still too hot-""

""You **BURNED ME!**"" His voice is hoarse.

The audience is getting quiet real fast. Circuitos is a professional villain; he never complains about a cheap shot unless he means it. He scrambles to his feet, his handlebar mustache peeling off the left side of his face, along with some of his hair. My super hearing picks up on the people still whispering around us.

""You know, I heard Lottery got in a fight with The Flying Wire last week.""

""The new hero? What happened?""

Circuitos rips off his gauntlet. ""Whoa, what are you doing?"" I ask. ""Put your dukes up, man. The cops aren't here yet.""

""Nuh-uh. No. I'm done."" He turns his back to me. ""Microbots! Command E-14! Return to Main Lair!""

The robots obey him, slowly setting the bank down to its resting place. Someone in the crowd starts booing. Circuitos ignores him, wincing as the bots form a jetpack and carry him away. I'm left watching as the crowd disperses and the villain leaves with about four million dollars in gold.
***
Five minutes later, I'm sitting on a rooftop on the north end of the city when I get two texts. One is from the League of Heroism commander Master Hawk, and one is from Macey. But they both say the same thing.

    We need to talk.

""This is Alpha-113. I'm on the corner of Fourth and Lincoln. Have found the glitch and will proceed to engage.""

""Copy that, 113. Sending backup to your location.""

""No need, Dispatch. This one's pretty calm. Send a mod team instead, this one has some bad leaks.""

""10-4. Dispatch out.""

I approach the glitch. It's been staring at its hands for the last minute. Then it turns to me. Its colors flash red for just a moment. Then it drops its hands.

I wish I had my vocal decryptor. The bug steps backward, still throwing off bytes of red. Still cautious. It doesn't understand that I'm trying to help. I hold out my hands with my palms forward, and stand still.

""My name's Amy."" I won't be able to understand it, but I ask anyway. ""What's yours?""

Finally, it stops moving backwards. When I move forward, it stands still. I drop my hands and walk up to the glitch.

    ¡ ∏☰☰Ð Λ ╫☰┏☐

""I'm here to help. Don't worry."" I unclip the decryption modules from my belt. ""Here, hold these in your hands-""

    ∏☐, ∏☐, ∏☐, ∏☐, ¡ Ð☐∏'⊥ §ღ☐├☰ ¡⊥ ∏☐ ღ☐┏☰,

It backs up, turning white.

""Nothing bad is going to happen. I promise."" I hold out the squares of decryption material. The glitch is moving faster, and I can't let it get out of the alleyway. ""Let me help you.""

The glitch is near the road now. My WristCom says the mod team is still two minutes out. I force myself to stop.

""Alright, I give up."" I raise my hands. ""You win. I'm putting them away, see?"" One minute and thirty four seconds. I need to stall. ""Why don't we just... talk?""

The figure straightens.

""It was like being torn apart at the seams. Everything was a mess. And yet, when I was out, and back to real life... I wanted it again.""

    ¡'ღ §☐┏┏¥ ⊥╫Λ⊥ ¡ ღΛÐ☰ ¥☐ü ↻┏¥

""It gets better. Really."" I hear the mod team driving up, but I don't react. I want to keep the bug calm. ""Everything moves on, one day at a time. But I promise you'll be okay.""

The mod car pulls into the alleyway. ""Are you sure you don't want my help?""

It glances at the car briefly. Then to my surprise, the glitch nods.

    ¡'ღ ß☰ç¡∏∏¡∏ç ⊥☐ §☰☰ ⊥╫☰ ↑¡ç╫⊥

I put them in the glitch's hands, being careful not to touch his skin directly. Then I run the decryption from my D.E.M.P. handheld. Davis and Rodney step out from the mod car, but I come to them first.

""You guys can take it from here. Lemme switch handhelds with you.""

They aren't paying attention to me, even as I give them the device. ""What is that, the third time this week?"" 

""Fourth. How do you get these bugs to calm down so quick?""

I reach around them and grab a D.E.M.P. from inside their car. ""I ain't telling, Rodney. I'll see you back at the station.""

""Mr. President, I feel I should warn you-""

""Please, be quiet! IS ANYONE RECORDING THIS?""

President James Relnson was a staunch, unfeeling Republican who spoke seriously, listened seriously, and never smiled in public. Knowing this, Kyoung-Min Jeong was understandably unnerved to watch him whistling around the room like a schoolchild. James poked the Secretary of Defense and slung his arm around her shoulder, but then wasted no time in crossing the stairs by threes on his way to the Oval Office. It was exhausting both to watch and to keep up.

Kyoung made a last ditch effort to cut off the President at the door to his office. He failed. President Relnson slammed the door behind him, and the translator was left in the hallway with two Secret Service agents.

""You got your ID?""

Kyoung cursed in his native tongue. ""I must have left it in the conference room.""

""Well, you're gonna have to go get it. Sorry.""

""No, you don't understand. I need to speak with the President about this broadcast.""

""Yeah, well, get in line,"" said the second guard. ""Have you seen the crowd out past the lawn? I tell you, this is going to be a security nightmare.""

""Ah, suck it up Bill.""

""Gentlemen, please! This is extremely important!""

""What's all the racket?"" The President had opened the door again. ""Ah! Mr. Jeong! We'll have to continue our talks with the South Korean President another time. Please give her my condolences when the communication lines open up-""

""Sir, I need to speak with you about the broadcast!""

President Relnson fidgeted, eager to get back to his personal television. Kyoung vaguely took note that this was the first time he had seen the President do anything other than stay still or walk slowly. It gave him a headache, and the sound of the broadcast from every comms unit and cell phone in the building only made it worse.

""Sir, please let me come inside. This is urgent.""

""Oh, alright!"" James clapped his hand on Kyoung's shoulder and pulled him in. ""Perhaps you could help me with my speech in a moment. What do you want?""

The door closed behind them, and the translator took a deep breath. Then the President interrupted him.

""Alien life is here. And during MY administration!"" President Relnson shook his head and grinned. ""They said they're going to share their technology, their...""

""Sir, *that's not what they're saying!*"" Kyoung was barely able to keep himself from yelling. His fists were clenched and pale at the knuckles.

""What? Can't you hear them?"" James pointed at the TV. 

""You're hearing the aliens speak in English. I can hear them speak in English and in Korean.""

""Fascinating!""

""NO!"" The smile slipped from President Relnson's face. ""Listen to what they're saying now!""

Kyoung turned to the TV. The English message had long since started from the beginning; a voice spoke calmly about sharing mutual knowledge and technology. The translator focused himself, and began to translate the other broadcast, which hadn't yet ended.

**""The people of Nigeria shall not be spared. The people of Niue shall not be spared. The people of Norfolk Island will not be spared. The people of North Korea will be spared. The people of Northern Cyprus will not be spared. The people of the Northern Mariana Islands will not be spared. The people of Norway will not be spared...**

Aiguo Zhao entered the living quarters backwards, pushing against the door with his spine. His hands were occupied with the morning meal tray, which held a bowl of hot oats, a dry slice of bread, a glass of goat's milk, and a small vase containing a single violet flower. He eased the door open, and turned to face the red-haired Irish woman sitting in heavy iron chains on the floor.

Zhao set the tray at Stacey O'Harris' feet. Her warm eyes smiled. ""Thank you, Mister... Zhao, was it?""

He nodded. ""That is correct."" Her accent was thick and her Japanese clumsy, thus they both spoke in English. Zhao took his time in bending down to sit, cross-legged, on the windswept floor. Stacey had already taken two bites of her toast when she realized he was still patiently gazing at her from only a few feet away.

""Oh. You're not leaving.""

""No,"" he admitted. ""I fear some of the younger *bhikkhu* may be keeping too much distance. A beautiful woman should have good company, at least while company can stay.""

Stacey's chains ground against the stone as she pulled her stringy hair back behind her ear. ""Oh, I'll wager you say that to all the women.""

""Have you been comfortable?""

""Oh, I've been quite alright. Yesterday I was able to take a walk outside."" She spoke through her food. 

""I thought I saw your footprints outside.""

""Yes. I'm sorry I went though. I feel so homesick now. The countryside around my home was so beautiful. Especially the lilies.""

She held out the hem of her dress. Before it had been white. Now it was brown with dust, and grey with grime. She couldn't be given the robes of the *bhikkhuni*, and washing had proven difficult on her own. But she had taken special care to preserve the nylon flowers along the base of her skirt.

""They were so beautiful.""

""That reminds me, your new clothes will be on the way soon. It will be another two days."" Zhao paused. ""And we will also have new guests.""

Stacey stopped chewing. ""Are they...""

""A few. Twins from South America. But they are being accompanied by scientists from Germany. They will want to see you as well, although I am not sure they will be of much help.""

""Oh.""

Zhao allowed Stacey to finish eating. She had lost weight steadily since her arrival. Her time outside had done the most good for her health, but it wasn't something that could be done often. Zhao could see the fear in the other monks' eyes whenever she asked for ""a stroll around the yard.""

She finished with her milk, then glanced at the violet left on the tray.

""I wish you didn't have to bring them with every meal. I hate it.""

""It is the best solution we have at the moment. It is only temporary.""

""Temporary."" Her voice hardened. ""Of course.""

Stacey snatched the violet by its stem, which snapped at once as the darkness took hold. From the stem and the petals simultaneously, dark spiderweb cracks overtook the flower, then blotched the entire plant. The colors of the flower were pulled along the veins of her arm, making their way instantly to her heart as the former *Viola odorata* burst into a plume of ash. 

Her demeanor soured, as it always did. She stared at the flowers on her dress, now clouded over by soot. Aiguo Zhao stood, and went to retrieve a broom and dustpan from the far corner. Stacey said nothing as he cleaned up. When he was finished, he deposited the ashes on the meal tray.

""It was slower the last time I saw you, was it not?"" Stacey said nothing. ""How are you feeling?""

""Hungry.""

Zhao was not pleased. He searched his mind desperately for words of comfort, but none came. They might not come for a long time. He picked up the tray. ""It is only temporary.""

""I hate it.""

""I know. I am truly sorry.""

""Bring two next time.""

""Come here, Anusa!"" My father beckons to me earnestly, grinning from ear to ear. I pick up my tape player. ""Pah! Not with *that*. Put it down."" He takes the music from my ears.

I struggle with him as his large, ebony arms pick me up and place me on his shoulder. My age music is walking away from me as I am carried into my father's bedroom. ""Onto the bed now- aaah, there we go. Good girl.""

""Daddy,"" I am crying. ""Music.""

""How old are you now, Anusa?"" He counts the numbers on my nose. ""One, two, three."" Then he glances left and right, and leans in close. ""Now you're old enough to listen to Daddy's age music.""

""No.""

""Yes."" And he puts his music on my ears.

It is very loud. The songs talk about busy chickens and cans of ale and being bewitched, and have lots of words I don't understand. But I don't need to understand them, Daddy says. I need to enjoy them, the way music is intended.
***
Mommy is yelling. Mommy yells at Daddy a lot. But now there is someone ringing the doorbell, and I forget about the yelling and go downstairs with Daddy's tape player. Daddy has always taught me to be polite and say hello when someone visits. 

The men walk past Mommy without saying hello. They are not being polite. One of them says, ""It's been five months since your last infraction, Mr. Damasu. Shame you had to ruin your good streak."" Then they see me.

""*Come here, child!*"" The other man grabs me by the waist and pulls the music from my ears. He is bigger and taller than the other man, and I struggle with him as the first man takes the player and forces Daddy out the door to a car by the road. It has been a long time since I listened to his age music. I hear the chicken song fading as they walk away from me.

""Daddy!"" I am crying. ""Music! Daddy!""

""Have her listen to this."" The other man has dropped me into the couch, and he hands my mom a new tape. ""Only to start with, of course. It may take years to fully repair the damage."" I push myself out of the couch and try to run to Daddy, but the man catches me again. ""Consarn it, woman, get her tape player!""

Mommy has my age music in her hand. I don't want it. I want Daddy. I kick the other man in the arms. ""No!""

""Yes, dear."" Mommy is crying. ""I know. I'm sorry.""

And the blankness slides over my ears.

Sometimes, when you look at a girl just close enough, you can see that one moment where they aren't who they pretend to be. Their smile wavers, just a little bit, and their eyes refocus on whatever it is they've decided they don't like. Then that millisecond comes to an end, and it's like nothing ever happened.

Gina didn't notice. But I did.

""So who is this?"" Claudia asked. 

""Oh, ah, she's my girlfriend. Gina."" I had the sudden urge to scratch the back of my neck. It was nighttime, but the sidewalk radiated heat and the mall was lit as brightly as the afternoon. I was not comfortable. ""We're on a date now, actually.""

""It's nice to meet you!"" Gina gave her a hug. ""How do you know Paul?""

""Um...""

""Summer camp!"" I blurted out. ""Yeah, that was a long time ago, you know? Way too long. I hardly even..."" I stopped once I realized Claudia was glaring at me.

""Oh, well you should hang out with us, Claudia! We were going to get some ice cream over at Visily's!""

""I'm actually lactose intolerant.""

""They have sherbet and stuff there too! It's one of those places where you choose your own-""

""I really need to go."" 

""Oh! That's too bad! Are you-""

""Yeah, we really shouldn't keep you. It's cool! Really."" I took Gina's hand. ""We can talk on... Facebook. Later.""

Claudia knew what I meant. We had never met on Facebook, only the dream. I looked forward to it; she did too, or at least she always said she had. Now, though, she didn't bother to hide her frustration. Her fists went white at the edges, and her voice was strained. ""Later.""

""Yeah.""

I practically had to drag Gina away, even as Claudia turned and walked to the parking lot. ""Hey, let go!"" She twisted around to face me. ""You're meeting someone you haven't seen in years, and you don't want to talk to them?""

""Well, I... want you all to myself. Just for tonight?""

Gina giggled. Nothing was wrong in her world. There weren't any facial expressions to analyze, or tones of voice to repeat in her head over and over again. She tapped me on the nose with her index finger. ""You are an idiot,"" she answered cheerfully. ""But you're sweet.""
***
""Your girlfriend is an idiot.""

Now we were dreaming. Tonight she fell asleep first, and chose for us to meet in the mall. The lights were brighter, strung up between lampposts and sitting as spotlights sunk between slabs of concrete. It was a cruel reminder of what happened, and she knew it. She was lying on a bench, with her shoes kicked off and one foot resting on the ground. Her hair rained over the side of the seat. I sat down on the bench facing her.

""You aren't being fair.""

""I don't want to be fair.""

""Can we talk about this? Please?""

""I wanna pack her in a cardboard box and send her to Abu Dhabi.""

""You just met her!""

""How long have you known her, exactly?"" Her voice sharpened. She was about to make a point.

""About three years.""

""We've known each other since *birth,* Paul. How is that not good enough for you?""

""It is."" Claudia said nothing. ""It's just... I couldn't say no to her.""

Claudia started to cry. ""I have been saying no to other guys since I was thirteen."" Her voice shook as she went on. ""I came looking for you today. I found you online, and I drove all the way out here... I don't know what I was thinking.""

""I'm sorry.""

""You should be.""

""What do you want me to say? You never told me you were coming.""

""And you never told me you had a girlfriend."" She stood up and walked out toward the parking lot, not bothering to pick up her shoes. ""Which one is worse?""

""Hey, wait."" I rushed to follow her, even though I knew I wouldn't be able to. ""Tell me you'll come back tomorrow. Please. I want to work this out.""

Sometimes, when you look at a girl just close enough, you can see that one moment when they are exactly who they want to be. Their lips straighten, getting just a little bit tighter, and their eyes refocus on whatever it is they've decided they don't like.

""Maybe we can talk on Facebook.""

Then that millisecond came to an end, and it was as if she had never been there.

""AUGH! Sonuva-""

James wasted no time in grabbing his rifle and opening the front door. At the side of the house was a man wearing a blue uniform with a red-and-white nametag. Paul. 

He stayed a safe distance. At least ten feet. Not that Paul was going anywhere.

""Who are you? What are you doing here?""

""Don't shoot, don't!"" The man cowered behind his bloodstained hands. ""Do you live here? Please, can you get me out of this bear trap?""

""Answer my question."" 

He sobbed, trying to wipe away tears and smearing blood on his face and shirt. ""Look, I'm just here to check the gas meter!""

""*No one touches that gas meter without my say so!* I have called that company *seven times!*"" James' hands shake with rage. ""Has *ANYONE* in that company seen Highway Man 3?""

""I can't die here! I can't die, I can't die..."" He rocked around in the fetal position until a new outburst of blood poured from his thigh. ""AAAH!""

""You've been following me!""

""What? No."" He did not sound at all convincing. His voice sounded weak. Pathetic.

""You are! You're here to kill me!"" James switched his grip on the gun. Paul's breath was fading, and his eyes began to flutter. But Jason was not going to let him have the satisfaction of dying. Not yet.

It took some time to drag Paul around to the cellar door, and even longer to take him down the stairs to his workstation. James put a tourniquet on his leg to stop the bleeding. Then he tied Paul up and waited.

Paul awoke, immediately straining against the ropes. James noticed, and picked up a rusted handsaw. 

""What kind of killer are you?""

""What?""

""Why are you after me? Is it demons? Or are you just some sick, twisted monster?""

""Please. Let me go. I have a family. I have kids.""

""It doesn't matter."" James ripped the saw through Paul's elbow, and he screamed in pain. ""You're a killer. You're getting what you deserve.""
***
I watched the entire ordeal through the small window at the base of the house, which peeked into the cellar. He never saw me. It was easy to check the spot for traps now that I knew what I was looking for.

The scene unnerved me. It wasn't right. James was not supposed to kill people. I was supposed to kill James.

He'll be more alert now. Paranoid, yet vigilant.

This will not be fun at all.

The man was dressed in jeans, a modest looking button-up shirt, and a light grey cardigan. His feet were obscured by dress socks and brown loafers, and on his head sat a very humorous looking beret that, in retrospect, might have been a bit much for a casual dinner date at Grayson's. Under the crook of his arm, he held three luminescent red roses. His rakish gait and self-effacing voice suggested nothing less than the pinnacle of romance.

None of his spotless attire, however, accounted for or distracted from the fact that Jenna was now seated across from an anthropomorphic skeleton.

""Hey, hi. Sorry I'm late."" He raised a bony hand, offering a shake. ""You must be Jenna. I'm Dan. It's nice to meet you.""

Jenna cautiously returned the handshake, all the while noting the odd manner in which each of Dan's bones stayed distinctly separated from one another as though still connected by invisible muscle and sinew. Against her own better judgement, she decided to ignore the most obvious conclusion (that she was clinically insane) and continue with the date as best she could.

""Nice to meet you too,"" she replied. ""Um... Dan, did you say?""

""You're staring.""

""Wha- Oh, I...""

""It's the beret, isn't it?"" Dan chuckled. He removed it as he sat down, revealing the smooth grey cap of his skull. ""I'm sorry. I told Kathy it was too pretentious.""

""I mean, no, it's... Kathy?""

""Girl from work. Always has her nose in everyone's business, you know?""

""Where do you work, exactly?"" Jenna attempted to play it off as a casual question, but failed. She got the distinct impression that if Dan had skin, he would have been frowning.

""Ah, well."" Dan scratched his head, and the sound of bone against bone made a very unpleasant scraping sound. ""I really didn't want to talk about work on the first date, you know?"" 

""...I'm sorry.""

""Nah, it's okay. Just, I had kind of a rough day. There was this guy, Jim. Ugh."" Dan shook his head, dismissing the obviously very unpleasant thought, then picked up the menu.

""It can't have been worse than my day.""

Dan snorted, which was odd considering he didn't have a nose. ""Yeah, I'll take that bet. You first.""

Jenna felt herself relaxing. Despite his odd appearance, Dan had a sort of quiet homeliness to him, something many of her previous boyfriends lacked in dangerous levels. She barely even blinked when Dan told her he was a Grim Reaper. Dan was able to make the job sound utterly fascinating. He also had excellent table manners, despite the absence of his tongue and stomach lining.

The meal ended, and Jenna soon found herself leaning against the facade of Grayson's Grill &amp; Bar, waiting with Dan for her ride back to her apartment.

""You know, you're not what I expected from your profile,"" she drawled.

""Is that good?""

""Suits me just fine. It's like a surprise party."" Jenna may have had a tad too much to drink.

""Well, I had a great time,"" Dan said as he put his beret back on his skull. ""It was nice to get away from work for a bit, you know? Live a little.""

Jenna nodded. ""We should do this again sometime.""

""Well, I'm free next Thursday.""

""Me too. You wanna see a movie?"" Jenna turned to Dan, and got the distinct impression that if he had skin, he would have been grinning from ear to ear.

""I'd love to.""

""Look around you!"" 

I look. My vision is blurred by lines of heat, by tongues of flame cast upon the air by boiling shrapnel. I see innocent men and women dead on the ground, their still bodies roaring with the life of thick black smoke.

""This was your choice from the beginning,"" I say.

""Don't put this on me!"" Arsyn screams. ""It's your fault just as much as mine. I didn't ask you to come after me! You're the one who can't leave well enough alone!""

""Was it leaving well enough alone when you tried to kill me?"" I ask. ""When you betrayed the Pandora Squadron and stole the list of its operatives?""

""It was,"" she growled. She stepped towards me, and I raised my hands to enter a fighting stance.

""Not another step closer. This ends here.""

""It doesn't end here!"" She lifts the briefcase above her head. ""I won't let it end here! If you and the Pandora Squadron want the list back, you'll have to kill me first!""

I launch myself at her. She ducks, and swings the briefcase aiming for my back. I am quicker; I land on my hands and aim a kick at her torso. I hear the satisfying sound of ribs cracking as she falls back on a flaming car. She screams in pain, but as I rush for her neck she manages to catch my side with a throwing star.

""I'm doing what I need to do to get what I deserve!"" Arsyn's voice overpowers the roar of the flames. She pulls the briefcase into the air and slams it into my skull. ""I am not going to spend the rest of my life working as a mindless drone!"" Another slam. This one draws blood. ""You're the one who chooses to be a slave to the Pandora Institute. I am taking my freedom back today!""

I pull the throwing star out of my side and slash her leg. The star hits stitches and tears open an old wound. She staggers and falls to the ground. I take my chance then, and snatch the briefcase-

""It's *empty!*"" I can tell by the weight, but I pull it open anyway. There is nothing inside the briefcase. ""Where is the list? Tell me!"" I pull my gun from its holster and hold it against her neck.

She laughs. ""You are going to kill me, aren't you? Good for you. Innocent little Catastrophe's all grown up and ready to do what it takes to survive. Just like me.""

""I'm nothing like you.""

""Bad blood."" Arsyn coughs, and I notice the line of red falling from her mouth. She stares at me. ""It's still thicker than water, no matter what. You know Pandora cheated you. You can go get what you deserve, or you can wait for them to kill you for your mistake.""

I stand, and aim the gun carefully at her head. ""You're the one who made a mistake. I hope you're happy.""

""I know you, Catastrophe. You'll see eventually that I was right all along.""

I pull the trigger, and watch the bad blood mingle with the chaos of a bad world.

I paused. There in front of me was the old tent, still dirty as ever and beckoning me inside. But I couldn't go in. I didn't know if I was ready to have family dinner after more than a year away from my old traveling home.

Fortunately, it wasn't up to me.

""That you, Maria? Hey, it is! C'mere!"" My brother Adam hugged me from behind. ""Took you long enough to get here.""

""Hey yourself, brother."" I turned to face him. 

""That's Mister Brother to you, ah?"" My younger brother grinned. ""Come on. Jamal's trying a new tightrope routine.""

""Ah, I can't stay too long. I gotta get enough sleep before work tomorrow.""

""Ah,"" he replied. ""You get to work any murders yet?""

We went inside the tent. Before I had a chance to answer, it was Papa's turn to give me a hug. ""There's my big strong girl, ah?"" His Romanian accent is thick and warm, like a wool blanket. I hugged him back, but he looked up to face me. ""Hey now, put your back into it. You too old to pick up your old man?""

""Papa...""

""If she doesn't want to pick you up, leave her be, Simion."" Mama plunked down the old china at the places on the table. 

*Tch.* ""You promised me you wouldn't start, Mirela.""

""I'm not starting anything. She doesn't want to carry you around,"" she huffed. ""Come get the sarmale from the fire.""

Liana walked in, and I noticed right away that her hair was bright pink. She almost didn't notice me with her head buried in her phone. ""Hey, you!""

She looked up. ""Oh! Hey, sister!"" She ran to hug me, and I picked her up and loaded her onto my shoulder. 

Papa stared at me. ""How come she gets to be picked up, ah?""

""Because I missed her birthday."" I set her down. ""Eighteen's a big one, ah? Sorry you didn't get your present. You moved to your next town before the package got to you.""

""Do you have it?""

""It's in the car.""

""Dinner first, Maria."" Mama beckoned us to the table. ""We're gonna eat like a family today.""

""What's for dinner, Mama?"" I asked

""What's for dinner is what I say what's for dinner. There better be no complaining out of you, Ms. Hotdogs and Pizza,"" she said sternly to Liana. Liana crossed her arms but said nothing.

Papa said grace, and Mama doled out the soup and sarmale. It tasted like home. I thanked her for the meal, and she mumbled a begrudged ""you're welcome, Maria."" We ate in silence for about a minute.

""So we're gonna be in town for the week,"" Adam told me between bites. ""When are you gonna come watch the show?""

""I think Wednesday.""

""Wednesday's good. Me and Josephine are the third act.""

""Josephine? I thought Liana was your partner on the knife wheel.""

""Adam kept slipping up,"" Liana interjected. ""A month ago he chopped off an inch of my hair."" She shows me the spot in the back where the hair is shorter in the back, cut at an angle.

""Why on earth is it pink, ah?"" I asked. ""You look like a girl from the comic conventions.""

""I like it pink.""

""I go tell the girl to get her hair cut in town, and she comes back with cotton candy hair,"" Mama grumbled. ""She didn't even fix the length of it.""

""My friends think it looks cool.""

""I don't care about your friends on FaceLand, Liana.""

""It's Facebook.""

""I guess it looks okay. You gotta dye your roots again though.""

""Maria, don't encourage your sister.""

""Mama, she likes her hair pink. Leave her be."" I said it without thinking. Mama stared at me, the spoon of soup halfway to her mouth, and I realized my mistake. ""I mean-""

""Simion, your daughter is talking back to me,"" Mama huffed.

""She's my daughter now, when she talks back?""

*""She is your daughter when she wishes to be stubborn. It is your family that they called 'The Mules of Ilfov,'""* Mama declared in Romanian.

""Mama, I'm sorry,"" I groan.

""It is not just her hair. It is junk food and Faceland-""

""Facebook.""

""Liana, hush,"" says Adam.

""-And sitting around all hours of the day on her computer when she should be working on her routine.""

""Mama, I'm too busy to work on my routine. I need to be building my portfolio for college.""

Mama slumped in her chair and ran her hands through her hair. ""Why is the college not going to wait for you, ah? Why do you need to leave home so quickly?""

""Mirela, we talked about this."" Papa placed a hand on Mama's shoulder. ""She got a good scholarship, so she's going to get a good education, just like Maria.""

Mama pushed his hand away and stood from the table. ""I'm going to go feed the tigers. They know how to have a meal without talking back.""

Papa followed her as she left the tent. ""Mirela. Wait...""

My siblings and I were left staring at cooling bowls of vegetable soup. Adam coughed. ""That went well.""

""Well enough."" Liana pulled her phone out of her pocket. I plucked it from her hand. ""Hey!""

I scooped Liana up and threw her onto my shoulder again. ""Come on. Now's a good time to see your gift.""
***
I set Liana down by my car, and opened up the trunk. ""Here it is. Adam, where's your knife?"" Adam handed the knife to Liana. ""Go on. Open the package.""

She ripped open the box with one hack of the knife. ""Yes! Junk food!"" She pulled out the family-size bag of Doritos first.

I laughed. ""So you're just going to ignore the art supplies I got you, ah? These were expensive!""

She hugged me. ""Thank you!""

""You're welcome. Don't let Mama catch you with that food, okay?""

""She never catches me. And I don't care anyway.""

""Hey."" I pick her up and sit her down on the roof of the car. ""She's still your mother, okay? Be civil.""

She hopped down and reached for the chips. ""She never lets me do anything except work on my routine. It was hard enough to study for the SAT when Mama had me doing knife practice with Adam all the time."" She opened the bag and pulled out a handful. ""That's why I had him cut my hair.""

I whipped around to face Adam. ""You cut her hair *on purpose?*""

""Well, it worked."" Adam folded his arms. ""And it was what she needed.""

""It's not what Mama needs. I get in enough trouble by myself. I'm a detective. I go out and put my life in danger to catch criminals. That's why Mama always gets worked up."" I pointed at Liana. ""Mama doesn't need more stress from her.""

My older brother stared me down. I am a head taller than he is, but he never backs down. ""Mama needs to know that Liana is going to college no matter what. It's what she was born to do. You can't keep taking Mama's side. You're the one who left first.""

I sigh, but Adam drapes his hand across my back. ""No one is worried about you. You're the World's Youngest Strongwoman, remember? Mama just needs to get used to having the nest a little more empty. Besides, I'll still be here. I like it here.""

Liana had walked off to the trailers, presumably to stash the junk food under her bed. We watched her go. ""They've been thinking about retiring. That's what has Mama worked up. It's not you.""

""Really?""

""Yeah. But they're okay. Really. You just need to leave them be.""

The man removed his labcoat, revealing a ratty t-shirt which said, ""Ask Me About The Conspiracy."" It was a keepsake of his, a memory of the time before. He wore it nearly every day to remind himself that he should be grateful for his lack of wealth. His new job as a biochemist was truly a blessing. The old shirt reminded him that his dead-end life on the street is what saved him from a dead-end life on the street. 

He then made his way to the office of his department head, Dr. Alexandria Pearson. He had to leave some reports on her desk. He was surprised to see she was still in the building.

""Hello, John, come in.""

""Oh. Um, hi. I have the end project reports..."" She tapped her desk tray impatiently, and he dropped the files obediently.

""Thank you, James. That will be all.""

Jerome had long since given up on having Dr. Pearson call him by his proper name. Today, however, she seemed more stressed than usual. ""Are you all right?""

""I'm fine."" She pushed up her glasses, but hesitantly, as though something had cracked her normally brusque facade. ""...Why?""

""Well, normally you would be packing up by now. Yet here you are..."" He leaned over to get a glimpse of Dr. Pearson's computer monitor. ""...Browsing CNN instead of going home.""

She sighed heavily. ""Well, I don't think my family would appreciate having me there.""

By no means was Dr. Pearson the kindest of superiors. She was belligerent, and rude, and she constantly forced her employees to work over their lunch break. She was not a pleasure to be around, and the research staff had made it a habit to gossip about her using less-than-professional terms.

Jerome never joined them. He was a kind soul, and he knew that no amount of pressure from Alexandria Pearson could match the cruelty of life in Detroit. So instead of leaving his boss to stew in her own misery, he pulled up a chair, sat down, and asked, ""Do you want to talk about it?""

She shook her head. ""There's nothing to talk about."" They both gazed at the computer, briefly. The headline was about yet another celebrity who had committed suicide. This particular singer had a net worth of $50 million and an IQ of 14. Per the most recent law passed by the temporary Congress, her estate would go to charity and genetic research on the Wealth-Intelligence Event.

""He's cheating on me.""

Jerome turned to see Dr. Pearson in tears. ""He can't stand me anymore. He's always just... so infuriated with me.""

""Why?""

""We had separate bank accounts before The Event. He'd always insisted we merge accounts, but the Research Institute had offered me a promotion, and I wanted to be independent..."" She sobbed. ""It was so stupid. And now he's so much less capable. He can't even hide his affair from me. I found out the first night.""

Jerome was sympathetic, but all at once, a thought tickled an itch at the back of his brain. ""Didn't I meet your husband at the Christmas party last year? He said he was a teacher, right?""

She nodded. ""Yes.""

""So you were working here at Pandora, and he was a teacher, and he made less than you did?"" *That doesn't make much sense,* Jerome thought. *Even two years ago, when The Event took place, she would be making much more than a teacher's salary.*

She scrunched up her face. ""No, I made..."" Then she blinked, and her face became severe. ""What business is it of yours?""

""No, I just thought...""

She stood up from her desk, and practically slapped away her tears as she packed up her briefcase. ""I need a drink. Get out of my office.""

""Hey, wait."" He took her hand and clasped it tightly. ""We're going to cure this. Right here, at Pandora Research."" She pulled her hand away fiercely. ""This is going to get better.""

""Good night, Jacob."" Her voice shook.

Jerome left the office, and made his way down to the hallway to collect his things from his locker. He could hear Dr. Pearson crying quietly to herself as he walked.

His heart went out to her. But he was distracted. The Event had made him much smarter, but also a bit more obsessive. So when a certain piece of the puzzle didn't fit, he would sometimes spend days turning over the matter in her mind.

What was that she had said before she asked him to leave? 

""No, I made..."" *More?*

I skim the rest of the letter. I find it... difficult to believe. I look up at the courier, who is still waiting in the doorway. He wears a white tuxedo with black trim, as well as black gloves and a black chauffeur's hat.

""Is this for real?""

""It is, sir."" He barely moves.

""Hmm."" Words fail me.

""I have been asked to escort you and your wife this evening to the Ritz-Carlton in Atlanta for your initiation ceremony. It is my duty to inform you that, should you fail to attend this event, your offer of membership will be revoked and your memory of said offer will be erased.""

""...I'm sorry, what?""

""I have been asked-""

""No, no, no, what was that you said about my memory?"" The courier said nothing. ""You said it would be erased?""

""That is correct.""

""Okay."" I fold up the letter and hand it back to him. ""Look, I didn't make my money by being stupid, alright? I'm not falling for whatever... Candid Camera show this is.""

The courier doesn't take back the letter. I shove it into his chest. ""Here, go on. Get off my property.""

All of a sudden, the courier puts a finger to his ear, as though reaching for a nonexistent Bluetooth headset. I have to stop myself from falling over. He nods, ever so slightly. ""Sir, you are being asked to check your bank account online, as proof of fact.""

""I'm not letting you into my house.""

He nods again. His finger doesn't leave his ear. ""You may check your billing statement through your phone, on your mobile app.""

""Shows what you know."" I shake the letter in his face again. ""I don't have a-""

My smartwatch buzzes. I look down, and to my shock, see the words

    Downloading - Bank of America

My vision starts to swim. I pull my phone from my pocket and watch as the download completes. I pull it up, quickly. After entering my passwords, I am greeted with my most recent balance.

    Carter Hawthorne

    Balance:  
    Savings: $0.00  
    Checking: $0.01

The courier hasn't moved. I glare at him, and he does not respond. ""What is this?"" My voice is shaking with fear.

""We are who we say we are, sir,"" he replies. ""Please call your wife to give notice of the event. A limousine will be here to receive you and your wife at 6 P.M. sharp."" On that note, he turns and leaves. The package he brought with him stays on the doorstep.

I slam the door, and run to my office. *It had to be a hack, had to be...* I think to myself, as my hands slam their way over the keyboard. I pull up all my assets, from my company bank to my offshore emergency fund. At each account, I am confronted with a balance of nothing. Only a few of my stocks are still intact, but they're being drained. I sell on all my investments. I'm forced to use a less-than-legal wire transfer account I picked up a few years ago. I can have it sent to a new account once I set it up.

I lean back in my chair, my breathing ragged. I feel myself going into shock. The only thing that keeps me from fainting is the sound of my wife's car rolling up the drive. I force myself to stand and go downstairs.

""Honey?""

""I'm home,"" Alyssa calls out. ""Don't ask me why though. I thought the investors' lunch was going just fine, but then they all up and left at once and - oh."" She stops speaking the moment I step into the garage. ""You look like a mess. What's wrong?""

""Where are the kids?""

""Wh... They're still at school.""

""We're going to go get them. Get in the car.""

""Dear? Dear, what's wrong?""

""We need to be out of the country by six.""

She gestured toward the cigars. ""Please, take one. They're Colombia's finest.""

Jorge Vásquez sat down at the table, and obliged her request. She lit the cigar, and he took a slight drag. His guards stood behind his chair, dressed in identical suits and holding imposing black assault rifles. Altogether, they alone occupied the small, homely restaurant.

""What is your name, *Señora*?"" Jorge asked.

""I am not obliged to answer,"" she replied. ""My employer is quite eager for you to sign the paper and have you return to your business.""

""There is no need to be so formal."" Jorge's eyes roved about the woman's figure, settling upon her eyes, her lips, the strange square tattoo upon her left forearm. ""Let us take some time to get to know each other.""

""I know all I need to know about you, Señor Vásquez. And you know all you need to know about me.""

Jorge again picked up his cigar, and took a longer pull of its smoke. ""My dear, life working for your *Instituto de Investigación de Pandora,* it is not becoming for a woman of such beauty."" The woman rolled her eyes at this, but Jorge smiled softly, reaching toward the woman's thigh with her free hand. ""*Por favor, mi hermosa...*""

""Your birth name is Jorge Luis Ochoa Vásquez."" The woman's voice sharpened, and Julian shifted his hand away in shock. ""You are *el padrino* of the Medellín Cartel. You founded the cartel with the help of your two brothers."" 

Jorge puffed again, and set down the cigar once more. ""This is not all common knowledge, but it means nothing.""

""Not as common as the knowledge of your trade routes and shipping locations. I am certain *El Movimiento 19 de abril* would find this knowledge most interesting.""

Jorge was silent for a long time. Finally, he replied, ""I am not afraid of a company that sends girls to make its threats.""

""I am not here to make threats, Señor Ochoa. I am here to do business."" At this, the woman picked up a briefcase. ""The Pandora Research Institute has been attempting to expand in Columbia. You have gotten in the way. We wish to come to an agreement.""

""And exactly what quarrel do I have with a business such as yours?""

She unclasped the latches on the briefcase, but did not open it. ""You don't. You have quarrel with *El Movimento.* Meanwhile, the Pandora Institute has had issue with local Columbian government. We can help each other.""

Jorge shook his head. ""Your company is one of American scientists. What you are proposing makes no sense. It is nonsense."" He stood abruptly, and his guards stepped back in anticipation. ""You are not in any position to make requests of my cartel.""

Before Jorge's bodyguards had a chance to respond, the woman removed a silver pistol from within her briefcase. Both of the men were shot neatly through the head, leaving Jorge Vásquez left to face the woman on his own.

""I believe you will find the Institute has more than enough leverage to make this request. We know who you are. We know where you keep your heroin."" She picked up Jorge's still smoking cigar from the table, holding it lightly in her left hand. ""And you have been smoking a very fast acting poison, which will stop your heart in ten minutes if you do not agree to our demands.""

Jorge's eyes widened. He leaned over, pushing his knuckles onto the table until they were white with pressure. ""You're bluffing.""

""Scientists,"" the woman replied calmly, ""know that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. You have law enforcement in your pocket, which we need. If you are not willing to work with us, we will be perfectly content to go through you.""

""*No voy a ser intimidados-*"" Jorge did not finish his thought. He clutched his chest as he felt the poison take hold.

""Do we have a deal, Señor Vásquez?""

""*Mi hermanos- Ellos le hará pagos-*""

""Very well. *Buenas noches, Señor.*"" She calmly, patiently returned her gun and the unused cigars back in her briefcase, shutting it tightly. She stood and picked it up. As she began to exit the restaurant, Jorge made a last ditch effort to pull himself up to his full height. He grabbed her by the arm.

""You,"" he wheezed, ""are not the company American scientists keep. Tell me-"" he coughed, and dropped the woman's arm.

She shook her head, curls bobbing over her eye, and made her way out the door. ""You know all you need to know about me.""

Description: They're perfect in every way, everyone loves them, they are always right, and they just want to be flawed.

""The Author,"" she explained in a subdued voice, ""has decided that I am perfect in every way."" She peered dispassionately at Janet, who sat captive, tied to her chair as though she hadn't a care in the world.

""I have decided that they are wrong.""

Janet barely reacted as her kidnapper fingered various painful-looking instruments of torture. She was unable to see much in the haze of the single fluorescent lightbulb centered above the table, but what she did see was utterly fascinating. *What an excellent set of tools she has,* Janet thought to herself. *I wonder where she bought them. Those gardening shears would make a marvelous Father's Day gift for Daddy.*

The kidnapper snapped her fingers impatiently. ""Pay attention,"" she barked. Janet did as she was told, without hesitation, and this elicited a heavy sigh from the captor. ""You don't really understand what's going on here, do you?""

Janet did not answer. She was wearing a large towel in her mouth as a gag. With another sigh, the gag was reluctantly removed, and Janet was free to speak.

""I understand what's going on.""

""Really.""

""You're going to torture me.""

The kidnapper was momentarily taken aback by this. Her first captive hadn't shown nearly as much situational awareness. Of course, she hadn't been able to go through with it. Nothing had changed. She was still perfect, was still unable to greet anyone with a reaction other than a kind smile and a graceful wave. He had shown up for school the very next morning, and kissed his kidnapper on the lips the moment they met, as he did every day.

Something was still missing. 

""Why aren't you afraid of me?"" she asked quietly. She drew herself up slowly, and put herself between Janet and the wooden workbench.

""Why would I be afraid of you, Mary?""

Her eyes narrowed. ""My name is not Mary. Not anymore. My name is Marissa Suzette."" She snatched up a chef knife from the table, and held it against the crook of Janet's elbow. Janet began to bleed. ""Say it.""

""Oh!"" Janet exclaimed. Then she *giggled*. ""That tickles.""

Marissa dug the knife deeper, down to the bone, yet Janet closed her eyes and smiled. To her, a severed brachial artery was as pleasurable as a cool evening stroll on the side of the beach. Marissa removed the blade and tugged her hair in frustration. Blood streaked through her frazzled golden curls, and splashed across the legs of her skinny jeans.

""*What is the matter with you?*"" Marissa screamed. ""You're about to die of blood loss! I just MURDERED you! I... just..."" She began to sob. ""You're my best friend! I have to save you!""

Her instincts took over then. Marissa didn't truly understand how her story worked, but she was unable to push away the impulse to save a life, even when her worst enemy, Darla, had stepped in front of a moving school bus. Furthermore, her father's tools were no longer the implements of a torture chamber, but in her hands could rival the surgical instruments of any medical center in the United States. The veins in Janet's arm were all clamped and sutured in record time.

After cleaning the wound, Marissa untied Janet and hugged her fiercely. She went limp, however, the moment Janet hugged back. 

""I can't keep doing this,"" she groaned. She pushed away from Janet, and pointed toward the door. ""Please, just go.""

""Okay,"" Janet replied cheerfully. ""You wanna go to Georgino's tomorrow after school? They're having a sale on ice cream cones.""

""Sure thing, best friend!"" She replied. As her best friend walked out, she gave a kind smile and a graceful wave. Then the door closed, and Mary Sue began to scream.

David got off his bike and walked along the side of the road. It was getting late, and he was still about a mile away from the farm, but he was tired. His argument with Suzi had taken a lot out of him.

He replayed the events of the day again in his memory. It still hurt, more than it should have. The recent falling of the Towers had sparked a very lively discussion in class that day, of which most were on one side, and few were on the other. Suzi was one of the rebels, declaring that war was pointless even in the face of such a vast terrorist threat. He sulked to himself, recalling the look in her eyes as she called his dad ""a soldier for nothing."" 

""Yer dad was a soldier fer nothin',"" she had said. ""Government was gonna chew 'im up an' spit 'im out just to kill good folks in 'Nam."" 

It wasn't true, of course. How could it be? Tom Paulson was an honest, hardworking man from an honest, hardworking family that ran an honest, hardworking farm.

It wasn't true.

Abruptly, David stopped, and kicked his bike into the grass. He seethed. If one were being honest, it was clear to see that he was truly mad at himself. His dad had told him, right from the start, how few people agreed with the action taken in Vietnam. America was divided against its government then, and had been before and would be after. But Tom Paulson taught his family that patriotism was the right way to live. He'd served for his country, and his forefathers before him. He'd be dead and rolling in his grave before one of his three sons refused to serve.

But he couldn't. Despite how close he was to enlistment age, David knew, in his heart of hearts, that he was entirely unable to take up a gun for the cause. It was mostly fear, he found. Fear of pain, fear of gunshots. Shoot, even fear of flying, no matter who was piloting the plane.

*I'm nothing but a sissy,* he thought to himself. *Don't know if I can be anything else.*

A shooting star fell across the sky. It was at the periphery of his vision, and he almost didn't pick it up. Not that it mattered, he mused to himself as he watched the comet arc toward the horizon. ""There ain't no such thing as magic,"" his mom had remarked once. ""No granted wishes but granted prayers.""

He decided to pray then. ""God,"" David said out loud. ""I don't want to be a soldier for nothing. Make me a good soldier, or no soldier at all."" He paused, briefly. ""Please.""

It was a crude prayer, and somewhat rushed by his nervousness, but it would do; his heart was in the right place. The stars shifted, and more dropped from the sky as a pale green glow passed through the sky. David picked up his bike from the ground, and dusted off the grass from its right side.

Then he began to walk again, unaware of the events soon to unfold.

I held my sword at the hilt, cautious, yet unwilling to pull it from my scabbard. Surely, the battle had been won. My soldiers already scrambled to divide the spoils among themselves. But the air was tense. My body felt a strain unequal to the work I and my men had undergone. What should have been no effort at all somehow robbed me, drained me of all my strength.

My men jeered at the miserable rebels that suffered, dying slowly in front their eyes as they partook in the rabble-rousing. Citizens came from the town to join them. They had followed our army a long way to see the end of the enemy's life. They too mocked the men who bled before them.

The leader of the rebellion was still alive. He had bled, and gasped for breath, yet continued to speak to those amassed as though rallying them for future battles. He seemed not to care that his enemies outweighed his supporters. My soldiers met with him, and delivered strong blows. He cried out in pain, yet stood erect. It was unnerving to watch.

As he dies, standing as straight as a young man with his stature possibly could, those who are with him struggling to stay alive seem divided. Half are going so far as to openly mock his death despite being in the same boat. The other half support him to the death. It is foolish, I decide. A comeback at this point is certainly impossible. My soldiers have even discarded their weapons in order to view their deaths with comfort. I release my hand from my sword, content to watch with them.

But at that moment, there is a blanketing darkness. The sun has left the hill, despite there being no cloud in the sky. All who are with me tremble as I do. The God of the rebellion is coming; he is here.

He will surely deal harshly with us.

For what seems to be long hours, we wait. Silence and darkness reign supreme, save for the occasional groaning of the rebels bleeding out. The priests who followed us have lost their nerve. They have no way of dispelling the blackness surrounding the hill.

Then there is a cry of pain from the leader of the rebellion. All at once, an earthquake strikes the hill. There are loud peals of thunder from the ground, and rocks on the surface are split to pieces. Yet the darkness is gone, and I look up to see that the leader of the rebellion is dead. I fall to my knees in shock.

The God of the Rebellion was not coming. He had left. And He was already here.

""Surely...""

""Well, ya know it was the most durn fool thang."" Jimmy stroked his beard, contemplating the old piano on the floor. He didn't continue the thought.

I lean in patiently. ""What happened?""

""Most durn fool thang,"" he said again. ""Plays well enough though. Good enough for the Grand Ol' Opry, really.""

""Yes, but-""

""You know, ain't never heard a finer instrument in all my life. But the kids are gone now, an' I ain't never had the classycal trainin'..."" He didn't continue the thought. 

""Where... are the *legs...* of the *piano?*"" I ask with gritted teeth.

He turns his attention to me, and just stares. Blanky. Without expression. I stare back.

""They're about.""

""About WHERE?""

""You wanna test it out? It ain't too dusty on the inside, I made sure a' that.""

""Where am I supposed to *sit?*"" I yell.

""Floor, I suppose.""

""Where are the legs? What happened to them? Did they fall off? Was there an earthquake? Were they sucked into another dimension? WHAT?""

His face hardened, and suddenly turned a deep shade of red. ""Now what d'yall need galldurned legs fer? Ain'tcha got good legs a' yer own?"" 

""Wh-"" I sputtered, shocked. ""Why won't you just tell me?""

He slammed his fist against the wall. ""Now if yall ain't gonna quit lookin' a gift horse in the chompers,"" he roared, ""yall can git out my house!""

I muffled a very loud scream behind my lips as I stepped outside the house. Someone parked in the driveway just as I exited. A man and a woman got out of the car. I stomped past the garden and headed them off as they approached the walkway.

""Are you guys here about the piano?""

""Yes. Are you the owner?"" asked the man.

""No. I just wanted to let you know not to bother.""

""How come?""

""You know there's no legs on the thing?""

The man scoffed. ""How would you not know? The picture in the add was pretty clear.""

""I didn't see any picture, my friend told me about the listing. But you don't think that's weird? At all? I asked the owner about it, and he wouldn't say a word about it!""

""How is that weird?"" asked the woman. The man nodded in agreement.

I stared at them in disbelief. ""You aren't at all curious to know what happened to the piano?""

""Well, it's not like any story about it would be that interesting."" The man pushed past me, and the woman followed. ""It's just a piano.""

""Look, we can argue about this til the cows come home, man. It'll get us nowhere.""

""What, I wasn't arguing. I was having a civil discussion,"" Greg declared, hand on his chest. ""You're the one who-""

""Yeah, yeah, just shut up, would you?"" Jordan said. ""It's simple, see? If we don't know, then we ask. Easy as that.""

""Well, I told you I already went down to Records last Thursday. His file isn't there, remember?""

""So we ask the prisoner.""

Greg shifted uneasily. ""We aren't allowed to talk to him.""

""See, I've given that some thought."" Jordan paced around in the hallway. ""You know we're not supposed to talk to him. And I know that.""

""And the warden. Don't forget the warden.""

""Yeah."" Jordan waved away the thought. ""Everyone knows that, right? But no one knows why.""

""Uh, because he's dangerous?""

""How do you know? No one's seen his file. How do you even know we shouldn't talk to him?""

""Look, man, I don't need another disciplinary hearing-""

Just then, the door at the far end of the hallway opened. Bill walked in, carrying a paper plate with barbecued chicken and coleslaw. ""Here it is,"" Bill said, handing the plate off to Jordan. ""His favorite."" It was a joke of course. There was a rumor rolling around that at one point, early in the prisoner's tenure, his former guards had arranged to have him served chicken for thirteen days straight, as a cruel prank. To the prisoner's credit, he had never once voiced a complaint through the food slot at the base of the door. After a day, he even stopped leaving bones on the plate.

""Thanks Bill."" Jordan waited for Greg to leave. Then, in a moment of impulsiveness, he pulled the keys from his belt and opened the iron door.

""Hey!"" yelled Greg. Jordan walked into the room, and Greg pulled on his partner's sleeve in an attempt to make him reconsider.

There, sitting in the corner next to the bed, sat a young looking man with a decently trimmed beard and a very ratty prison uniform. 

Greg froze. So did Jordan, but only for a brief moment. It passed, and he found his voice. ""Lunchtime.""

The prisoner blinked. Then he spoke. 

""Thanks.""

His voice was warm, Jordan decided. Not at all like a man who had spent more than a century in prison.

""What's your name?""

The prisoner paused. ""Mike.""

""Huh. What are you in for, Mike?""

Another pause. ""Murder.""

""Ha! Lou owes me ten bucks.""

""Hang on."" Greg pulled on Jordan's sleeve again. ""We definitely shouldn't be talking to a murderer.""

""What? He seems alright. He's nice."" Jordan turned to Mike. ""You're a nice guy, huh?""

""I try.""

""You see? The justice system works."" Jordan patted Greg on the back, beaming at Michael. ""Spend some time in the clink, you learn some things, am I right?""

He was up before either guard had a chance to respond. Their throats were slit neatly and with precision. Greg went silently, passing out the moment the improvised blade hit his windpipe. Jordan only gasped and struggled, rolling on the ground as Mike picked at Greg's utility belt.

""I learned that sooner or later, everyone forgets the rules."" Mike stood to his feet, holding Greg's gun and taser. He fired a round into Jordan's face. ""And that chicken bones can hold a very fine point.""

""Are you okay?""

I paused. Stopped to take a breath and look her in the eyes. She had her head cocked to one side, and there was something like... displeasure... scrawled across her face.

""I'm fine. Really. Why-""

""Have you been eating enough lately?"" She slid off the bed.

""Why is this the first question-""

She put her hands on my forehead. I snapped my head away instinctively. ""Izzy, I just told you that you don't have any free will. None whatsoever. And now you're asking me if *I'm* okay?""

""Well, it's not April First."" She held the bridge of her nose between her fingers. ""Cripes. Alright, get in my car. I'll drive.""

I'm at a bit of a loss here. ""What for?"" 

""Going somewhere."" She slides on her school sweatshirt.

""Were you listening to a word I said?""

""Yes,"" she growls. ""Go get in the car.""

I don't have any idea what's going on. *Is she not responding to this at all?* I think to myself. I certainly didn't know what to expect when I broke the news to her, but it wasn't this. She walks out to the parking garage with an intensity in her face normally reserved for games of Monopoly, or punching her ex-boyfriend.  It scares me, just a little, and what I want to do is carry her back inside by the waist and force her to understand.

I get into the car. I realize I'll have to break it to her gently. 

She starts it, and makes her way out to the road. It's slow going, which is unusual. Izzy never normally cared for speed limits. Her car was an old Cadillac she'd fixed up with her dad, and she loved to show it off.

""What, no speeding? Who are you, and what have you done with Isabelle Meyer?""

""Really? You wanna kid around about this?""

""Oh, shoot, I wasn't thinking-""

""Why, exactly,"" she asks tightly, ""do you think I don't have free will?""

Maybe this was progress. ""Well, like I said-""

""I heard what you said, Adam! I heard all of it. But it's nonsense! Look at me. Does it look like I'm being driven around by mind control? I'm driving. I'm having a conversation about government conspiracy and whether or not I have a consciousness.""

""It'll make sense. You'll see it. You just need to think about it some more.""

She hunches her shoulders over the wheel and gritted her teeth. ""It makes sense now, Adam. Something's wrong with you."" 

We pull up to the gate, and Izzy rolls down her window to speak to the guard. She digs into the glovebox and pulls out a lanyard. ""Hi. Let me in."" He obliges, and the gate opens.

""What are we doing at your office, Izzy?""

""I'm going to drop you off here.""

""We shouldn't be here.""

""I talked to some people a few days ago, because you were being weird, and I was worried, and they said they could help. You're not going to like it, but you need it.""

""Who did you talk to?""

""And I talked to your mom, and she's worried too, and there's good doctors here so just... just get..."" She's crying now, real tears and real sobs. I wasn't prepared for this. But all too late, I realize what's going on.

""Izzy... where do you think we are?""

""Somewhere you can get help. They have the best doctors in the state here."" She slows down the car.

""No. No we aren't. We're at the Pandora Research Institute. Where you work."" I speak slowly. I want there to still be a chance. I want desperately for her to understand. ""We are driving into the middle of the problem.""

""You don't understand.""

He sat on the ledge of the rooftop, legs dangling against a sharp east wind. It might have threatened to pull him off the ledge, to force the decision she so desperately didn't want him to make. The fall would destroy his body, make him unrecognizable to the crowd gathered on the sidewalk.

It would also destroy her soul.

""I want to understand, Joe. I really do.""

""No, you don't,"" he spat. ""You shouldn't want to. It's the worst thing in the world. It's not pain, it's not fear, it's not anything. Just... death.""

She peered down. The height was dizzying. ""You're not dead yet, Joe. We can fix this.""

""It's not... I can't fix it, okay? I've tried. I really have."" Joseph turned to Emily. There was a sudden frantic tone to his voice, and a wildness in his eyes that frightened her to her core. He gripped her by the shoulder, and she gasped, falling backwards from the edge onto the asphalt rooftop. And at that moment, he was there. He sat no longer on the edge of the roof, but climbed down to be with Emily, away from the perimeter.

The crowd below began to disperse. There were relieved sighs, and the putting away of various recording devices. The police were content to leave the scene as well, considering the issue resolved.

Joseph waited as Emily caught her breath. The back of her blouse was scratched and dust-covered from her fall. He noticed her long, straight brown hair, and the evening light of the city framing the point of her nose just so. She hugged him then, kneeling on the gravelly floor, and he felt the softness of her clothes and the cool of her gold locket against his own skin. But that was all.

Joseph pushed her away without having to move. He didn't hug back, and in a moment, she separated herself from him. She pushed her hair back behind her left ear, staring into his eyes.

He spoke. ""Remember two months ago, you asked why I kept pushing back our date night? You thought I was cheating on you."" She shook her head vehemently.

""I didn't.""

""Yes you did. But I wasn't. I was seeing a therapist, and... I just wanted time alone. To think things over.""

She gazed at him, and he continued. ""He couldn't help me.""

""We can find someone else.""

""No."" He shifted his weight, and sat on the floor. ""I can't be helped. I don't even want it."" Staring into the sky, he saw a small star in the periphery of his vision. He ignored it, and settled his eyes on the black void above them.

""I'm not part of this world. I don't have any place here. People are living their lives all around, with their own stories and their own adventures. And I'm not a character in any one of them."" He started sobbing, taking his eyes from his view of the heavens but not bothering to wipe away his tears. His whole body shook. ""Not even mine.""

She clasped her hands in front of her. ""What about me? You're in my story. You *are* important. Just please...""

""You've already moved on.""

""I don't care about him."" She meant it then. Had always meant it from the moment they first met. But he sagged his head, taking a slow, unsteady breath, and finished speaking.

""Don't lie to me, Em,"" he said softly. ""I don't need to be lied to.""

It was his eyes, she decided. There was wildness, and there was worry, and there was fear, but that was before. Now all that was left was nothingness. She saw the round, tired pupils and sagging eyelids of someone who, for lack of a better phrase, had given up the ghost long ago. 

It was about a month before Emily appeared again on the rooftop of Joseph's old apartment for the last time. The height wasn't as traumatizing as before, which should have been a comfort. 

It was early morning. The city of Manhattan tumbled by, hundreds of citizens going about their business. Each person trotting along the sidewalk had a schedule to keep, and stories tucked into their briefcases and cellphones and morning cups of coffee. 

She didn't feel envy for them. But there was a gnawing pit in her stomach, an ache centered upon her lostness in the world, her lack of feeling despite the cool November air and the warmth of the sun on her skin. She simply resigned herself to the cold, cruel fact that she was no longer a character in her own story.

She scratched her head, confused. It didn't seem so hard to accept. She thought there would be some struggle, some indication that a part of her still wanted to matter. Maybe it was because there was no one left to connect to. Joseph was gone, and no one else seemed to care the way she did. At least now she understood.

He was right though. She didn't want to understand anymore.

""And what was that, children?""

""Our desire for power,"" said Khalen, from the middle of the room.

Teacher tutted, and wagged her finger in the air. ""You did not raise your hand, Khalen. That's a mark.""

Khalen pouted, slumping into his chair, but said nothing. At that moment, a gust of wind entered the room. The candles burning in the reading corner blew out, a puff of smoke rising dutifully from the wax. Although it was light outside, and the extra light was not needed, Teacher saw the opportunity for a practical lesson. Her eyes glimmered. She removed a packet of matches from the desk, and made her way slowly across the room.

""See how I go to relight the candle. For what use are candles, class?""

Shauna raised her hand. ""They give light so we can read.""

""Very good, Shauna. And because reading is very important, so too are candles. But what would happen if I were to light *too many* candles?""

Both Gel and Shauna raised their hands at once. Shauna wiggled in her seat, eager to please Teacher. Teacher called on Gel instead, however, and he answered, “You would waste candles, an’ then you’d have to buy new candles.”

Teacher smiled, briefly. “Well, there is that.” Her smile then faded, replaced by an expression of serene urgency. “But there is also the danger that the classroom would catch fire, and that would be very, very bad.”

The class was silent as Teacher made her way back to the front of the room. Satisfied that she had made a lasting impression on her students, she picked up her clipboard and made a mark next to Khalen’s name. She then instructed her students: “Turn in your texts to Chapter Fifteen. Today, we will be studying The Second Great Depression of North America.”

""Avast!""

""Avast!""

The father watch them, smiling broadly. It amused him to no end that on the inaugural debut of the Transcontinental Railroad, a marvel of modern science and transportation, his two sons wanted nothing more than to play a game of Pirates. The game, which the boys Pierre and Joseph had created ""all on their own,"" mainly consisted of swinging around imaginary swords and yelling the word ""avast"" at the top of their lungs.

""Avast!""

The mother, Carmelita, sat across from Father and held their daughter Joanna in her lap. Joanna, who was nearly two years old and had only recently learned to speak, sat in rapt attention viewing the ever changing landscape outside of the passenger car. The tree line passing in the distance was to her a wave of rolling green sand, which outlined the crystalline blue waters of the sky. A fence washed into view, and suddenly the grass teemed with animal life swimming along the railway. She pointed at them, with a sense of urgency only a curious child can have.

""Mommy,"" she declared plaintively. ""Cows.""

""Oh!"" Her mother smiled, and turned to face the window. ""Yes dear, I see them. Those are called buffalo.""

""Cows,"" Joanna insisted.

Mother was patient with her. ""Buff... a... lo. They are a different kind of cow.""

Joanna frowned, but turned her attention back to the window. Suddenly restless, she attempted to twist from her mother's grasp and to stand on the seat on her own. Henry shifted his gaze to his wife.

""Perhaps you should take her back to the sleeping car for her nap,"" he said. ""I believe the men requested some buffalo hunting for the afternoon.""

Mother clicked her tongue in frustration. ""You men and your guns,"" she replied disdainfully. ""I suppose you will be wanting to join them.""

Henry shrugged in response. ""I have no gun. You made me leave it at home.""

Mother picked up Joanna and stood to her feet. She addressed her sons: ""You boys stay with your father. Be good."" She then walked with her daughter to the end of the car, and the porter assisted her with the door.

A man sitting further down the opposite side of the car took this opportunity to approach Henry. ""You are in need of a gun?"" he asked with a thick German accent.

""I don't mean to impose upon anyone...""

""Nonsense. I have brought two rifles. I believe the stock should fit you nicely.""

They tested the rifle briefly, and Henry agreed that it was a good fit. As the train slowed to match the speed of the school of bison, Pierre and Joseph followed their father in the opposite direction of the sleeping car. Fourteen men aligned themselves on the left side of the car, and opened the windows to view their prey. Beyond the roaring, watery crash of the train's engines, the animals floated along through the tall grass.

Henry's German companion fired the first shot. It struck a member of the herd in the middle of the group, and the buffalo scattered, like fish avoiding the jaws of a shark.

""Avast!"" cried Pierre, raising a fist in solidarity. And Henry smiled.

*""What are YOU doing here?""*

Charlene stares at me from the edge of the pool, with the same amount of sarcastic dispassion with which she looks at every man, woman and child on the face of the Earth. I can tell by the look in here eyes that she does not want me here, that she never did and never will.

Quentin Lombardo Basten turns to face her. ""Hey, Char. You know this guy?"" I notice that they have both been tanning, and that they are wearing matching bathing suits. I sink into the hard metal of the patio chair. I have made an enormous mistake.

Charlene has her gaze fixed on me, her royal brown face and Brazilian hair framing eyes that could start a forest fire at any moment. ""We used to date,"" she declares coldly.

""Yeah?"" he replies. He turns back to me. ""That's cool. You must got some sweet moves, paparazzo. She's not even in *my* league.""

I grin weakly. *Maybe I can get through this.* ""Yeah, well...""

""I don't want him here."" She is sneering as she towels off her shoulders and walks toward us. ""Make him leave. You know what stress does to my skin, and the movie tryouts are tomorrow!""

""Bad breakup, huh Char?"" he asks. He is facing me, asking me the question. He wants my explanation. I'm perfectly prepared to give him one, but I know it's hopeless. When Charlene dislikes someone, she won't let them get a word in edgewise.

Her next statement floors me.

""He cheated on me. He said he-""

""Excuse me?"" I stand from my chair. ""YOU cheated on ME! Like, with a dozen people!""

""Whoa, man, calm down for a second."" He puts his hands up, the universal signal for ""take it easy."" Charlene begins rambling in long, angry sentences of Portuguese. I can tell Quentin can't understand her; it's all an act to make him feel sorry for her. I feel almost certain I pick up phrases of Japanese in her rant. She hugs him tightly, kissing his neck, and a look of unbridled fear passes on his face.

He points to my microphone. ""Look, maybe we should-""

""Don't talk to him!"" she spits, snapping her neck toward me. ""*Kare wa gōkei jākudeari ele cheira como um vaso sanitário!* Don't let him interview you!""

He cringes. ""I think it'd be best if you leave.""

""But my company needs this interview!"" I plead. ""Just give me a few minutes! You're a reasonable guy, aren't you?""
***
I've never been literally thrown out of a building before. I don't recommend it. I tore up my best suit. As I sit waiting for the valet to get my car, wondering why on earth Quentin would have a valet for his private beach house, Charlene saunters down the front steps wearing a white sundress.

""What do you want.""

""I came to see you off.""

""Go jump in the ocean,"" I reply, pointing in the general direction of the beach.

""You really wanted that interview, huh?""

""I want you to go jump in the ocean. Preferably the part with sharks.""

""I can get him to invite you back,"" she says, in a babying, singsong tone. She draws out her A's, a rare grin on her face as she sizes me up from the stairs, her scheming hands clasped behind her back.

I glare at her from the ground, infinitely curious as to how a woman so beautiful could be so hotheaded and annoying. ""What do you get out of it?"" I ask. I hope she can say something that can redeem herself in my eyes, something that will make me believe she has some shred of humanity left to show me.

No such luck.

""Have dinner with me?""

**Marcus:** What happened?

**Jeff the Dog:** You wouldn't believe it! Mrs. Smoochie had the nerve to come up to me today and tell me I wasn't invited to the Dogwood Hills Country Club! And in front of all my friends too! It was enough to put my paws over my eyes in shame.

**Jessica:** What for? Her bark is worse than her bite, you know!

**Jeff the Dog:** My social life is not a game, Jessica.

&gt;studio laughter

**Jeff the Dog:** *ignoring* I must work harder than ever before!

**Marcus:** Time to start looking for other girls!

**Jeff the Dog:** *ignoring* I will never look at another female dog again even if it kills me! *howls*

**Jessica:** Boy, it'd be real ironic if another female dog killed you for not looking at her.

**Jeff the Dog:** *head snaps toward Jessica, glaring*

**Jeff the Dog:** That tears it. I need a drink. *exit stage left*

**Marcus:** You know, you really should stop antagonizing him.

Her life within the cabin was not without its pleasures. Primarily the rain. Sheets of water pouring down onto the glass, and low, loud rumblings of thunder. Perhaps it was worth the loneliness, she thought. To be safely tucked between the trees, and watch nature roam around her.

Cabin Fanaday was her home. It had been her home now for nearly two years. She was a scientist: at first a humble researcher born in Thailand, then a distinguished project lead employed by Pandora Research Incorporated. She led a new project now, a private and classified inquiry on which she alone was to work.

She reported to no one, and spoke with no one save for letters of correspondence she wrote to her parents and older sister. She was under strict order not to discuss the specifics of Project Fanaday with those whom she contacted. After some time, her letters became less frequent. There was nothing to say, after all. No amount of break time watching online videos or reading world news could be a substitute for human interaction. That was what she missed most of all. The endless bustle of Silicon Alley, the cool of early morning outside a Manhattan brownstone. The deli on 4th Street where she'd had her first date with Paul.

She missed Paul.

Absentmindedly, she twirled her finger in the air. Her reflection did the same. She wanted it to be enough. She, and her reflection, and the rain. It was meant to be the only comforts she needed.

But every night, at 9 PM, the simulation ceased. The very idea of windows to the outside world refused to be, each screen recessing slightly before being shuttered into their hiding places. The speaker system left its pre-programmed cycle of thunderous rain in favor of the nightly chant:

&gt;Good evening, Chariya. It is time for you to begin sleeping. It is important for you to get eight hours of sleep each night. Doing so will help the body...

She shut her ears to the voice as best she could, making her way through the dimly lit hallway to her bedroom. The bed was unmade, as disheveled and unorganized as the library, the bathroom, and lately, her various workstations.

She felt the urge to rebel, to burn her entire laboratory to the ground, if only to gain one more precious second with Paul and her family. But she quelled it, dashing her emotions as violently as she flopped onto her mattress. It would not be good manners to destroy her important work.

*Perhaps tomorrow. I will lodge a request for vacation. Perhaps it will not be denied again.*

Her nightly mantra washed her to sleep as easily as the summer rain.

""Well, it's a very nice watch. Can you have it sized?""

""Oh, certainly."" The man's warm British accent breathed over the watch ever so softly. He took out his measuring tools and took his wrist in my hand.

I walked out of the shop wearing a two thousand dollar Fanaday &amp; Sykes analogue wristwatch with gold plating, diamond insets, and jewel movements. On the streets of Manhattan, I might normally be worried about having it stolen. But there was no reason to worry about that.

*Wait. I should be worried. Why am I not worried?*

Then I saw the taxi. Or rather, sensed it. When I turned to look at the car, it didn't have the standard yellow and black pattern on its side. It glowed bright red, and got darker as it approached the woman in a yellow blouse rushing to jaywalk across the intersection.

The crash was sickening.

I rushed to her. So did several others on the street. The taxi driver and passenger sat in their seats, eyes wide and staring. A man knelt down on the road and began to do CPR.

I didn't notice the sound at first. It started quietly, from a large, distant sounding bell. I thought it came from Saint Patrick's Cathedral. But it grew louder. It sang, and shook the ground with the melody of Westminster Quarters. It roared in my ears.

But no one noticed. They didn't see her death, didn't hear it. The man continued pumping on her chest as the paramedics arrived. They brought out a defibrillator. No response.

The bells began to strike out the hour. They loaded her into a stretcher, slowly, with labored movements. The chimes struck twelve just as they closed the ambulance doors.

""Time of death: 1:41 PM, May 12, 2015 A.D.,"" I whispered softly. 

Then I ran.

A cell. I can't believe this.

I pace the floor, hands behind my back in contemplation. This shouldn't even be possible. I was trying to right the world, to remove the scum holding back the good people of Farriston. Now I have been captured by Farriston's own police.

It is an injustice.

I do not know how I got here. Indeed, I have been losing my memory frequently for the past few months. But there are patches, to be sure. I remember having foiled Dr. Easton's plans once and for all. I had him. I brought him out of hiding, tied up, and delivered him to the police. The last thing I remember is the policemen on duty raising their guns with caution as they prepared to take him in.

I stare down at the power nullifiers on my wrists and ankles. They are obviously the design of my archnemisis. The only conclusion I can come to is that he has police on his payroll. I slam my fist against the wall, and wince with pain. A pain I am unfamiliar with, but one that does not equal the fury that builds inside me. I can no longer trust the law enforcement of Farriston to protect its people. The mayor needs to know of this breach in justice.

I must make my escape. It will take time, and it will take effort. But I must see to it that Dr. Easton never puts in place his plan to enslave the people of this town with his weapons of mind control.

But first, rest is in order. I must build my strength.

Dr. Easton will rue the day he sought to destroy this town.

""Hey.""

""Hey! Where have you been?"" Vicky took the bouquet of roses from her boyfriend and wrapped him in an enormous hug. John felt her breath on his ear. ""I was worried. Didn't you see my messages?""

He nodded quickly, scanning the room. All zeros, except for a two at the bar who had already had a decent amount of alcohol. He gritted his teeth. ""Can we get out of here?""

""Why?"" Her number, a luminescent 37, stood above her head as always.

""Just... I need to go. Come with me.""

They left the restaurant. John had been sure to park his car next to hers. He got into my car, and she followed. ""What's wrong, John?"" she asked hesitantly.

""I saw a guy get shot.""

""Oh! I'm so sorry.""

""It was... extreme. I hate thinking about it. There was so much blood...""

""Hey. I'm here."" She held his hand tightly. ""If you want to talk, I'm here.""

He turned to her with a sudden urgency. ""Have you ever thought about it? Have you ever wanted to... to kill someone?""

Her blue eyes searched his own, and she shook her head vehemently. ""No. Never.""

And John believed her. But the ring burned in his back pocket, and he knew it wasn't the right time to ask. The night was ruined. John put his key in the ignition of his car, then paused. ""I'm sorry. Can we reschedule? I'm not feeling a hundred percent.""

She brought her gaze down from the roof of the car, seemingly lost in thought. ""Hmm? Oh. Take... take all the time you need."" She opened the car door, but didn't step out. ""John?""

""Yes?""

""Promise me you'll be okay.""

He nodded. ""Yeah."" His eyes glazed over as he turned the ignition. 

She stepped out of the car, and entered her own as John left for his apartment. She watched anxiously, fearing for his safety, and for the translucent red one above his car where there had previously been a zero.

John took a last look at Vicky as he pulled out of the parking lot. Her number hadn't changed.

I stood by the sidewalk, wiping the sweat from my brow and leaning against my shovel. The police detectives were speaking with my boss, Greg Berne. One of them pointed at me from a distance. The other workers milled around, shuffling their feet.

""What a day, huh?"" asked Kyle, standing next to me.

""It ain't even ten AM, Kyle.""

""Wow, you really are new here, aren't you? This is Manhattan, it's New York City. It's the city that never sleeps."" He turned to face me, and poked a finger into my chest. ""First lesson of New York: It's always day, and what a day it is.""

I stared at him. ""That's the dumbest sentence I've ever heard.""

""Mr. Mikhanda?"" That was one of the detectives. I stuck my shovel deeper into the gravel, then walked over to the two men.

""Hello?""

""Your foreman said you were the one who found the body,"" said Detective Charles McKinley. He had a slight tinge of an Irish accent that seemed common of everyone on this side of town.

""That's right."" I clasped my hands nervously.

""Tell us what happened, sir,"" said David, the other detective.

Except Reggie, the guy who's usually here? He had the clutch stuck between gears when he finished last night. So the backhoe, it kinda... pitched forward a bit, and took a huge chunk out of the street. And then, when it came up, uh..."" I paused.

""Yes?"" asked Charles patiently.

""That's when the arm came up out of the ground."" My breath tightened, and my knuckles turned white as I kept squeezing my hands together. I'd thrown up when I first saw it. It was old, the skin was grey and green. It looked very much like I had dug up the zombie apocalypse.

David turned to Greg. ""When was the last time work was done on this street? Do you know?""

""About a year ago."" Greg spoke softly. ""This project is earlier than it was scheduled to be. Guess now we know why. The body must have weakened the integrity of the street.""

""So, you think it might have been buried during the last construction? Where can we find a list of the crew who worked on this street last?""

Greg took a slight step back. ""Whoa, now. You think it was one of our teams?""

Just then, a uniformed officer walked toward us. He was wearing blue gloves, and held a small plastic bag with a wallet inside. ""We found some identification. The chief wants you to look at this.""

David took a pair of gloves from the officer before reaching into the bag. He flipped through the wallet, and drew out a credit card. ""Quinn J. Dempsey."" 

""You're kidding."" said Charles. Greg whistled in fascination.

""Who?"" I asked.

The officers stared at me quizzically. Greg put his hand out. ""He's new around here."" Then he spoke to me. ""He was the head of the Irish mob around here. There's no one in this neighborhood that doesn't know his name. They called him Doctor Dempsey, because there was a rumor that he pulled a bullet out of his stomach and did his own stitches.""

""He was a maniac,"" Charles added. ""Really drove down the property value around here. And sure enough, he went missing about a year ago.""

""Oh,"" I sighed. ""Well, at least he can't hurt anyone now, right?""

David gave a dry laugh. ""Are you kidding? Things have gotten *worse* since he died. The Russian and Irish mobs went postal on each other after he disappeared. Mob related deaths every night for a month. The Irish thought it was Kazimir Yakov who killed Dempsey.""

""Do you think it was?"" asked Greg.

""Doubt it,"" said Charles. ""This killing wasn't their style. He was stabbed. Probably by someone who got in a bad deal and wanted to get out."" He shook his head. ""Fat lot of good that did for the city.""

""Anyway,"" said David, ""thanks for your help. We'll be sure to contact you if we need anything else."" With that they left.

Greg turned to me. ""You need the day off, kid?""

""No, just... give me a minute."" He sighed, and went to ask someone else to man the backhoe. 

So I sat down on the sidewalk bordering the road to Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, and watched as the paving continued. *If only there were some kind of saying that would remind people about the dangers of good intentions,* I thought to myself. *Maybe things like this wouldn't happen.*

I'd be fooling myself if I said it would actually help.

""Alright, is everybody ready?""

The Hulk had been the hardest. Whereas all the other costumes had been pulled out of storage (except for the fully automated Iron Man costume, which had been graciously provided by an overzealous cosplayer), the Hulk had been entirely computer generated. The aliens had been waiting for the past year, not because they were unable to reach Thor in Asgard, but so as to develop the perfect haptic-holographic soundstage to imitate the Hulk's mannerisms and any other necessary special effects.

The aliens were very patient.

Mark Ruffalo shifted uncomfortably. The motion tracking fabric itched. ""I mean, has no one else watched *Galaxy Quest*? This doesn't end well for us. It never does.""

""Shut your trap, Mark,"" Robert growled. ""The President isn't giving us a choice; we've been over this.""

""I liked it better when Obama was President. Shoot, I liked it better when *Bush* was President.""

""One minute till curtain!""

""Look, Mark."" Evans piped up. ""We just need to get this done. All you have to do is put on a show. That's it.""

Scarlett Johanson and Samuel L. Jackson stepped out from the changing area. ""Phew. I am getting too old for this."" Samuel laid his hand on the makeup table and arched his back to stretch. ""Just one more job till sweet, sweet retirement, ay boys?"" He grinned. No one else did.

With that, the Avengers were assembled. With the exception of Ruffalo, they each filtered out in a single file line into the fake Supreme Court. It stood empty, save for President LeBaise, his aides, and five aliens. In a moment, a hard light copy of The Hulk stomped out. The ground shook appropriately.

No one other than the world's leaders had yet seen what the aliens looked like. The shape of their bodies was very similar to the outer anatomy of a large cat, but with simian-like hands, and hard exoskeletons in place of fur. They each stood on two legs. The alien in front greeted them in the warm voice of a human man.

""We greet you on behalf of the Gentaliku populace,"" he said.

""Hail, noble creatures, on behalf of Earth,"" the humans said in unison, except for Hemsworth, who said, ""on behalf of Asgard.""

""We offer you our tribute."" Two of the aliens brought forth a large, casket shaped box. ""Our information regarding all aspects of organic life on our planet. We have dissected and analyzed many of the organic samples we received from your people. We believe you will find them most helpful.""

The Hulk picked up the box, using a complicated system of air jets and hidden wires. Robert Downey Jr. and Jeremy Renner stepped forward. ""We hereby offer you our knowledge of computerized systems."" He paused. The aliens turned away and spoke to each other in their alien tongue.

""Forgive us for our impudence,"" said the head alien, ""but we wished to learn more of your precious metals. Do you perchance have samples of vibranium and adamantium for us to examine?""

The Avengers paused. Then they immediately huddled in the corner with the president and his aides. Every human watching the affair from outside froze in shock and horror. 

All except Mark Ruffalo, who was kind enough to extricate his hologram from the room and shut off his audio feed before yelling about Galaxy Quest in the privacy of the motion capture stage.

""Really?""

""Yes, really. Go on in!""

So in Karl went, whistling to himself happily. What fun! He'd never been the first into the staduim before. He walked over to the refreshments booth and ordered a large box of popcorn and an orange soda.

When he turned around, he realized the ushers had locked the stadium gates. His coworkers, as well as a fair handful of the general public, stared at him murderously from behind the wrought-iron bars. After a moment, most of the public returned to their cars, grumbling. The stadium guards were asking them to evacuate the premises. Karl's friends did not move.

Karl took a mouthful of popcorn and chewed thoughtfully. Then he spoke.

""How come you locked out my friends?""

""They aren't allowed inside,"" said the first usher.

""You let me in.""

""Yes,"" said the second.

""Why won't you let them in?""

""They aren't allowed inside.""

""Why not?""

""They aren't.""

Karl was not the brightest bulb in the box, but even he could see this conversation was going nowhere. He decided to try something else.

""If they aren't allowed in, can you let me back outside? I'd hate to be by myself.""

""No.""

""Why not?""

""They might try to slip past us and get inside.""

""They won't. Will you, guys?""

""I might.""

""Will, shut up!"" Ethan groaned, slapping Will upside the head. Dan, meanwhile, continued to stare at Karl and the ushers with a rather rude expression on his face.

""We can't let them come in,"" repeated the second usher.

""Why not?"" asked Ethan.

The first usher sighed. ""Karl has been chosen for a very special test. And while he does the test, the stadium can't be disturbed. So the stadium is closed today.""

""I'm not here to take a test,"" replied Karl indignantly. ""I'm here to watch baseball.""

""Wait, what? What's going on? What about the game?"" Dan asked. ""You can't possibly be authorized to shut down the entire stadium on the night of the playoffs!""

""I'm calling the cops."" Ethan pulled his phone out of his pocket and switched to the phone app.

All of a sudden, the second usher pulled out a ring of keys and proceeded to unlock the gates. ""About time,"" declared Will.

Ethan was about to put his phone back in his pocket when the first usher pulled him inside, then grabbed it from his hands. The usher then proceeded to beat at the phone violently for a full minute, first by throwing it to the ground, then by whacking at it with a novelty baseball bat which had previously sat in the clearance basket of the gift shop. Ethan and the others looked on in horror. 

Meanwhile, the second usher brought Dan and Will inside, and locked the gates once again. 

""Congratulations, Ethan,"" said the first usher, panting laboriously. ""You get to join the test.""

Ethan said nothing.

""Just follow the signs that say ""Pandora Research Institute,"" the second usher said calmly. ""You'll find what you need.""

Ethan continued to say nothing, as did Karl. Then the first usher waved his baseball bat menacingly, and they both moved toward the entrance.

""Ethan?"" asked Karl.

""Yeah?""

""I'm a little freaked out right now.""

""Yeah, buddy."" Ethan gulped. ""So am I.""

""Listen, Jim... Can I call ya Jim?""

The twenty-seven year old necromancer settled an old, tired eye upon the hooded skeleton. His recently attached nose ring shook as he spoke. ""My earthly name is Jim Lestalg. I would prefer to be referred to as Na'eel Kaz Krana'a.""

It was complete and utter gibberish. There was no meaning to the name whatsoever, in any language. The Grim Reaper laid his skeleton skull in his skeleton hand, and sighed loudly.

""Jim, you have to understand. You're not a real necromancer.""

""If I am not a real necromancer, then you are not Death.""

""Listen, please. Let us be sensible."" Death took out a small parchment scroll, and unfurled it. Pictures danced across the paper, followed by a long string of computer code. At last, a file came up, not unlike what one might find in a government database. 

""This is you, yes?"" He pointed at Jim's picture.

""It is but my earthly form.""

Death regretted not being able to kill Jim on the spot. ""Look here. This. Is. You. Now what does that say there, next to Job Description?""

""That is not my true occupation.""

""It says telemarketer, Jim. You are a telemarketer. Not a necromancer.""

""I have spoken with five souls today alone. And I have more to visit before the day is out.""

""Look, that's what I'm trying to tell you. You're not supposed to talk to them.""

""It is my duty.""

""No, it's *mine,*"" Death growled. ""You're not even supposed to be able to speak with them.""

""Have you not given me my mandate? My gift to work with those who have not moved on?""

""No, I didn't.""

""Then you are not Death. You are a sad and sorry being who has delusions of grandeur.""

""GAAAAHH,"" Death yelled. ""No one has any of these gifts you're talking about. It's just you. It's some freak clerical error they're trying to deal with upstairs. And we could fix the problem faster if you would STOP RAISING PEOPLE FROM THE DEAD.""

Just then, another hooded skeleton appeared beside them. ""Hey Dan. They told me you were having trouble with the client.""

""Kathy, I'm fine,"" Death huffed. ""Go back upstairs.""

""Aha!"" Jim yelled triumphantly, pointing a freshly tattooed arm at the Grim Reaper. ""So you are NOT Death! You are a wayward soul named Dan!""

""Oh, for the love of... You know what? I'm just gonna kill you and be done with it. They can put me back in accounting for all I care."" Dan raised his scythe above his head.

""Dan, wait! I came down to tell you they fixed the problem already!""

Death paused. ""You sure?""

""I'm sure.""

""Goodness. You gotta lead with that first, Kathy! Do you know how long I've been talking to this nutjob?""

Kathy folded her arms in protest. ""It's only been fifteen minutes. You've been alive for thousands of years.""

""Yeah, well, it felt like a lot longer."" Dan lowered his scythe and walked to the front door of Jim's apartment. ""I tell ya, this job is gonna be the death of me.""

Chess again. The simple kind, for once. I sighed to myself quietly. I wanted to take my time on this one.

*E4*

*D4*

Wait. That was my piece. I exited the game, briefly, and looked at my target from across the coffee shop. Mid-twenties, decent body, reading a science fiction book. Something about Star Trek.

I entered again, and attempted to restart.

*E4*

*D9*

All of a sudden, I developed a pounding headache, followed quickly by powerful nausea. I fell off my chair.

""Whoa! Hey!"" Two men in suits rushed over to me from the next table. I couldn't see, could barely breathe. I fought against them in a panic. I could hear someone talking to the police on their phone. I yelled as I kicked off my shoe in an effort to escape. 

Patrons pushed away as I crawled across the floor. Still somewhat blinded, I made my best guess as to where the door was. I couldn't go to the police. Wiping minds took time, and in my state I didn't even know if it was possible. Reaching, straining, desperate for air. Can't feel my left side. Must... reach...

And then, a shoe landed on my arm. I screamed in pain, my voice hoarse despite how little I'd used it. I could feel the entity leaning down towards me, as a woman's voice whispered, ""You're terrible at chess.""

My senses returned all at once, and the woman exited, the door chime ringing as she left. The last thing I saw before being dragged to the back of the shop were the words ""Kobayashi Maru"" and a picture of a large spaceship.

The Fanday &amp; Sykes Institute of Engineering, to those initiated, is a city in its own right, seated at the heart of an even bigger city. And yet somehow, they'd made it impossible to get out.

My dorm was a bloodbath. I'd managed to climb onto the roof, and stay out of sight until nightfall. It was the right choice; as far as I could tell, there were no survivors. I climbed down into my window to gather my things. Then I jumped into a nearby tree, made my way to the ground, and set off for the nearest border to campus. It only took three minutes to reach.

The most glaring flaw in my plan to escape the campus is that the fences had obviously been reinforced. It wasn't a chain link fence anymore. It was a massive iron wall. I heard a faint buzzing that told me it was also electrified. Not a good situation to face.

I broke into the West Campus Dining Hall, which was right in front of the wall. There were dead bodies. I forced myself not to shut my eyes. This was going to be a common occurrence for the foreseeable future. I took food and knives. Then I went to the Aerospace Engineering building.
***
I got lucky. One of the first people I spotted was a friend of mine in Aerospace. He waved me over when one of the guards started to get hostile.

""It's okay, man, he's AE."" I brushed myself off as he walked toward me. ""Took you a long time to get here. What were you doing?""

""Surviving, man. I'm fine.""

He looked at me sideways. ""How are you not bleeding yet?"" His nose had been slashed, probably with glass or hard plastic.

""I stayed low. I haven't had to kill anyone yet. And I don't think we have to."" I put a hand on his shoulder. ""Who's in charge here?""
***
""You really think we can just leave? Have you seen the wall?""

""The wall's not a problem, I'm telling you. Look, it's not gonna be easy, but the plan is simple."" I'm standing in the midst of a crowd that gathered up before I had a chance to tell anyone my plan. I have to make this good. ""Let's disassemble the wind tunnel in the basement. We take it up to one of the upper stories and rebuild it there, but *at an angle.* We'll basically have our own cannon. Then, we can set up a system to parachute over the wall.""

""There's a dozen reasons that won't work, freshman. Even if we could get the wind tunnel to function...""

I thought as much. But I don't care. I'm prepared to argue even though I don't know the first thing about my own major. I cannot and will not kill if I don't have to. 

The leader of the group holds up his hand before I begin.

""The plan is fine. But it's going to take a lot of work. Let's organize raids on the Mechanical Engineers and the Computer Majors. We're gonna need car engines too. And I want the grad students to run calculations.""

He turned to me. ""You wanna run the team?""

I grimace. ""I don't know what I'm doing. I wasn't even planning to stay in this major.""

""Hey, man."" He punched me in the arm, lightly. ""This idea is yours. You were born to be an engineer.""

""Yeah, well, I just hope I live to be one.""

I took a seat next to Jack, soda in hand, and reached for a slice of veggie pizza from his box. He swatted my hand away.

""Get your own, man.""

""You're seriously going to eat that whole box.""

""Die tryin'."" He bit the crust off another slice. ""It's not like there's none left.""

We were at a party. It was supposed to be a cookout for a baseball game, but it started raining, and Dave decided to order pizza instead of just using the stove in the kitchen. It felt a bit inconsiderate to me. I spent good money on those steaks, and I knew my freezer wasn't enough to keep them in good condition. Plus I wanted to help cook; Dave bought a brand-new grill last month and I wanted to try it out.

The commercials started again. I took out my laptop and went to Reddit, as usual. Jack watched me.

""You're obsessed, you know that?""

""Obsessed is a word the lazy use to describe the dedicated.""

""No, obsessed is when you don't need to be dedicated because it's stupid. Come on, man. It's been two months.""

""It's gonna end soon, y'know? I wanna watch when that happens.""

He shook his head and spoke through a mouthful of cheese crust. ""I don't get it, you know? I don't know why anyone would bother."" He swallowed.

""Bother about what?""

""About any of it. It's a button. You push it and nothing happens. It makes no sense. People need to get on with their lives, do important stuff.""

The game came back on. I pointed at Dave's TV. ""Like watch baseball?""

He groaned.

""Look,"" I told him. ""It's entertainment. It's fun, it's supposed to be. And I want to enjoy it. I don't know why anyone wouldn't want to press the button.""

""I thought you were one of those... the destruction group.""

""Destructionist. Yeah, I am.""

""Well now you're contradicting yourself.""

""I'm not. Everyone should push the button if they want to. They still should have that choice.""

For a few minutes, we watched the game. There were two home runs in a row. It was exciting to watch.

""What do you think was Reddit's idea though?"" Jack asked. ""Why did *they* make it? What was their goal?""

I paused. ""I dunno. If I had to guess, I'd say it's like an art imitating life thing. Musings on the reality of...""

""Of what?""

""I have no idea. Whatever, you know? As long as you get something out of it."" I turn to face him. ""That's what I don't understand, honestly. You're a non-presser. What are you getting out of it?""

""You're a 60s. You clicked it without thinking. Did you even have time to get anything out of it?""

I shrugged. ""Something's better than nothing.""

**60**

""Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.""

Claire walked in and put her rain coat on the hook by the front door. Her face was radiant, despite being drenched by the downpour outside. Matt held his hands up jokingly. ""Whoa, I thought this was the boys' club. What gives?""

**47**

""Shut up."" She laughed. ""It's Sunday, and I got nothing better to do."" She looked around. ""I thought you guys were making steak.""

**40**

""Got rained out,"" Ethan said.

""Aw.""

**35** 

I gazed at her as she sat down with Ethan's wife and a slice of pineapple pizza. Then I heard Jack start talking again.

**30**

""...Life by the horns, dude. Real life. Get something out of that, man, not some code on a website.""

""Can't it be both?""

**25**

He sighed. ""If you keep this up, it might be neither. Seriously, man. The Button will be there when you get back.""

**20**

""Might not be.""

**18**

""Doesn't even matter. Live in the present dude, whether you pushed the button or not. Life finds a way.""

**12**

I stare at my laptop as it enters the final ten seconds, just as it has for the past week straight. Then I close it, and stuff it in my bag.

**5**

I stand up, and stretch a bit. ""Eh, when you're right, you're right. I'm gonna go talk to Claire.""

***
***
A chill enveloped the Great Hall. Queen Elsa entered, hands clasped behind her back, and walked in a stately manner toward King Arguson's throne.

""Thank you for agreeing to meet with us."" A thin smile crossed her face as she examined the throne room. ""It was most gracious of you.""

The king frowned in response. He leaned forward. ""Yes. It is an honor to meet you at last."" He gestured toward his left leg. ""Forgive me if I do not stand.""

Her smile vanished, and for a moment the chill of the room increased slightly. Her eyes narrowed. ""The formality isn't necessary, I assure you.""

""To business then.""

He was a brute, a height of six and one-half feet tall when standing, and the light of the sun behind his throne cast an imposing shadow on the ground before him. In preparation for the assembly, his maids had chosen a large bearskin cape, which further served to enhance his muscular figure. His staff, made with wrought iron, completed an ensemble that would strike fear into the heart of any normal leader.

Queen Elsa was not a normal leader.

She gestured for her royal adviser, who removed a large scroll from his pouch. He handed this to the Magistrate of the Southern Isles, who took time to read the scroll's contents in excruciating detail. The queen stood patiently. After some time had passed, the magistrate bowed to the queen, then approached King Arguson and whispered briefly in his ear.

""WHAT?"" he roared. The men and women of the court flinched in terror. ""You would cease trade with Weselton? Are you mad?""

""They are no longer welcome to the kingdom of Arendelle. I assure you, you will not know the difference. The Great City of Corona has been most generous...""

""Corona is a city bordering us by *land.* The expense of new toll roads is too great to justify any benefit."" He waved away the magistrate in disgust. ""Do you wish to have us starve, or are you simply a foolish girl who cannot run a kingdom to save her life?""

The temperature of the Great Hall dropped rapidly as Elsa's face flushed in anger. ""Need I remind you what will happen if we continue to impose our own embargo on your kingdom? Your ships are frozen solid, rotting in the harbor. If you wait any longer, they will be completely useless during the fishing season.""

The king stood at last, and pointed a meaty finger directly at the Queen's heart. ""Then let the winter end at last.""

On cue, two dozen archers revealed themselves in the upper balcony. Each of their arrows were tipped with metal blades, heated in the torches that had until then been used to light the throne room. All at once, they were released.

And with a wave of her hand, each arrow clattered to the floor, their cold tips shattering before they even reached the ground.

All pretense of decorum dropped from Elsa's person as her robes disintegrated in favor of an icy blue gown. She stepped forward, snatching the scroll from the magistrate's arms, and reached the throne before King Arguson had a chance to blink. The ribbons in her hair snapped spontaneously, and her tresses flowed wildly along her shoulders.

She gathered herself. Princess Anna wouldn't be pleased at such a show of force. Elsa's breathing strained as she contemplated whether or not to continue her rampage.

""Your son,"" she snarled, ""told me not to be the monster people fear I am. *Maybe if your people were civil towards me,* I wouldn't need to do so."" 

The king's feet froze in place. Then his waist. She held out the scroll, trying desperately to conceal her emotions as the contract passed hands.

""Sign it. Or I will have no choice but to take the Southern Isles by force.""

""BOO!""

""Aah!""

Jake laughed as Sandra cowered behind the old, tasseled pillow. Her green eyes widened all the more as she yelled, ""Stop scaring me! I don't like it!""

""Aw, come on. It's just a little dragon!"" He gestured with his free arm. ""What's the worst it can do, huh? EAT YOU?"" He snapped at her again with the dragon.

""Stooop,"" she groaned. Her eyes started to water. Jake rolled onto his side, suddenly aware of his mistake.

""Hey, it's okay. Hey. Hey."" 

""I want Mommy.""

Jake paused. His smile vanished, replaced by a heavy brow and gritted teeth. How to make her understand? Their parents weren't coming home, would never come home again after the murder. They hid alone in the house, away from the prying eyes of the detectives still searching for him and his sister, which meant he alone could help his sister through their new situation. But it was difficult. He had no previous experience with death, save for television and... bedtime stories.

""Lemme tell you a story, huh?"" He scooted over to Sandra.

""Put the dragon away.""

""Alright. There, it's gone. See? Now listen to the story.""

Sandra waited.

""Okay, so, um... Once upon a time, there was a boy, and uh, a girl. And the girl was, I mean. Um. So the girl's parents were gone. Umm...""

""Daddy was better at stories.""

""I know, okay?"" Jake huffed. He pulled the blanket off his head. ""Look. Me an' you, we're gonna take care of each other now, okay? We don't need Mom and Dad. An' we're gonna watch movies all the time, an' have ice cream for breakfast, and no one's ever gonna hurt us. Okay?""

""But what if I get scared?""

""Then you tell the scary stuff to get lost. An' the scary stuff has to listen, or I'll beat it up.""

Sandra sniffled, but released the pillow from her grasp. Jake let out his breath in relief. ""Go to bed, okay?""

""Okay.""

Sandra lay on the floor, and closed her eyes. She continued to sniffle quietly for about five minutes, before her breathing evened and her shoulders relaxed into a slump. Jake sat and watched her. Every once in a while, he absentmindedly morphed his hand between human form, and sock puppet dragon form, and back again.

Jake didn't enjoy being a ghost. He felt drained, unable to handle the emotions his mother was once so good at quelling.

He wondered why she had killed them.

""STEP RIGHT UP FOLKS. COME ONE COME ALL. BE THE FIRST TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS AMAZING OFFER.""

The man was in perfect costume. He wore a thin black suit, under which was a loose dress shirt and authentic leather belt, patterned after the style of the American frontier. His Stockman hat was also black, with a dusty white ribbon encircling the place where the brim met the bond. He and his horse and cart were adequately dust-blown, as though they had traveled through the Nevada desert for a full three days. The cart was a solid red cedar wagon kiosk, with rusty (yet sturdy) black iron wheels. Inside the were the basic living amenities of life in the year 1849, as well as the man's rather... unscrupulous wares. 

Painted in red upon the cart were the words ""Isaac Smithson's Miracle Gold.""

""STEP RIGHT UP.""

One of the men standing outside the saloon took a draw of warm beer. He then ambled on into the road and approached Isaac Smithson, who was proclaiming his sale from a standing position upon his horse.

""What'r ye sellin'?""

""Miracles, sir."" Isaac Smithson jumped down from atop his horse, grasping his hat in his hands.

The man laughed. Flecks of spittle entered his beard. ""Yer a loon. I like ya."" He extended his arm in greeting. ""Name's Ford. Tom Ford.""

Isaac Smithson grabbed Tom's hand and gave a very warm, practiced shake. ""A pleasure, sir. Truly a pleasure."" He glanced at the shaded deck of the bar. ""How would you and your friends like to view a miracle?""

""Jeddy!"" Tom turned to the men. ""Tell the folk in there to stick their heads out a second. New salesman in town.""

Jeddy did so. In three minutes a small crowd of twenty-three people were gathered around Isaac Smithson's horse. The children tugged at the horse's mane, and a particularly brave girl attempted to climb into the saddle.

""Now then,"" said Isaac Smithson, surveying the group. ""Pardon my saying so, but this is an awfully small group."" He caught a nod from the town sheriff, and turned to face him. ""The men are away, I presume? Out in California?""

""Sure as can be, Mister."" Sheriff Dan tugged at his goatee. It was itchy. ""Maybe fifty men out since the rush started. Hard times here.""

""Well, sir, I wish they might have waited."" Isaac Smithson began opening the cart. ""Why, they wouldn't have to work a day in their lives once I was through here."" 

""What do you mean by that?"" asked the barmaid.

Isaac Smithson smiled. Placing his Stockman back upon his head, he opened the partition and lifted out a single potted plant. 

""Behold!"" *Pause for effect, just like you practiced...* ""The MONEY TREE.""
***
Isaac Smithson, known to the future as Robert Heimgall, remembered the time when gold first became a renewable resource. It had been the most wild week for news reporters the world over. Genetic advances allowed for inorganic material to grow from organic plant life, thus revolutionizing modern technology. Homegrown circuitry was what truly brought the world into the twenty-second century.

Of course, it was very easy to tell organic gold from inorganic gold, and the market for true gold was revitalized almost instantaneously. Economists surmised that, even though true gold was flooding the investment market, it rose in value purely out of consumer conformity. They also surmised that this trend might lead to a gold market crash sometime in 2167.

Robert didn't care. He decided he would take advantage of the Chronological History Summarization Initiative's offer of ""Half-off an Time-Authentic Wild West Tour!^(*Prices may vary. Visit our website for details. Sponsored by Pandora Research Incorporated.*)"" to make a quick buck off the gullible townsfolk, and trade the unseedable tree for real gold. And so far, it was all going according to plan.
***
Isaac Smithson briefly cradled the gold tree in his hands before setting it on the ground. The tree, which used to be a small oak, was the size of a bouquet of large poinsettias. Shimmering on every leaf was a powdering of fresh organic gold, and the trunk was splintered full of gold thorns.

""Now you might never believe it if I didn't show you,"" said Isaac Smithson humbly. ""But here it is. Proof that money really does grow on trees!"" 

Isaac Smithson waited for laughter, but there was none. He attributed this to shock, and decided to move on. He deftly wove a tale of a time spent walking along the banks of the American River, far (yet not too far) from his boyhood home of Sacramento. Tired and hungry from a severe lack of provisions, when he first came upon the great tree, he'd believed he was hallucinating. Isaac Smithson was sure to add that the American government had tried to silence him, and had dug up the entire tree to have scientists conduct experiments on it in the North. But he'd hidden a single gold fruit inside the confines of his trusty Stockman, and a packet of seeds in his pouch, and made his way east, spreading the Good News of gold prosperity.

""Now it's only been three months, but this tree has already grown a full two feet high. It'll be ripe in a year, and then you'll be picking gold fruit off the ground for a month straight. This ain't some edible new fruit, it's true gold. You can melt it down and sell it off, and not the best of Forty-Niners would be able to tell the difference."" Isaac Smithson took his leather pouch from the inside of the cart, and removed a handful of gold-painted popcorn kernels. ""Now don't all grab at once. I'm willing to sell cheap, so long as Uncle Sam gets what's coming to him.""

Isaac Smithson waited.

""You must think we're jenn-you-wine idjits.""

Isaac Smithson faltered. His smile faded quickly, and he took his Stockman down from his head.

""Your pardon?""

Old Jeddy pushed a finger into Isaac Smithson's chest, then pointed down to the tree, which was photosynthesizing and growing new gold even as he spoke. ""Ah know a good graftin' job when Ah see one. Ah've worked land my whole life, and ev'ry buddy knows ain't no gold grow on trees. Not now, not in ever.""

The crowd began to disperse. Isaac Smithson panicked. ""It is real! Look, I'll break off a whole branch!"" He leaned down and began furiously tugging at the largest bough.

The sheriff stood menancingly over Isaac Smithson. ""Boy, you had better calm yourself. You're lucky they didn't run you out on a rail."" He dropped to a knee to look Isaac Smithson in the eye. ""Times are hard here. These kind folk will be wanting to save their money for Honest Jeffrey Silex when he comes to town later today.""

As Isaac Smithson collapsed from the strain of pulling at the golden oak, Sheriff Dan turned his eye to the road out of town. ""He may be a darkey, but that man makes the best snake oil this side of the river.""

Description: No restrictions on the type of story, but feel free to challenge yourself.

You will soon come across The City. You will be amazed. You will wonder how you ever lived in such a dry and arid world as the land before. You will be filled with wonder, alive at the thought of living amongst the lush vegetation, the flora and fauna of a world meant to be called home.

To say nothing of the scientific advances, of course. Tall, monstrous buildings of glass and steel, marvels of the modern world. You will drive in perfect traffic, and arrive for every appointment as punctually as science would allow. You will wake up in the morning, and be greeted by the smell of hot coffee and a fresh Dutch apple bagel, or be positively assaulted by the glory of tomato and cracked pepper on a free-range omelet. Your suit will be pressed to perfection, your feet tenderly assuaged by a custom built massage chair after a long (yet fabulously rewarding) day of work. 

And what charming locals are meant for this charming locale? They will be kind. They will be encouraging. They will understand what life is meant to be, and work every day to ensure the livelihood of their fellow brothers and sisters is naught but the best service and smiles they could possibly provide.

You will come across The City. It will be glorious.

Then it will be gone.

In a flash, it will be over. Brick by ever-loving brick! the illusion will have cast itself off of you. You will be confused. You will be distraught. You will go MAD, and lose all semblance of hope or self control. As the paramedics struggle to imbue you with the needle of a deepest sleep, you will bite, tear, REND APART THE VERY FABRIC OF REALITY THAT SEPARATES YOU FROM THE CITY OF YOUR DREAMS.

***
You will be awoken, after four long years of counseling, of the medication of separation that drove your wife away in terror.

You will follow instructions. You will be calm. You will count to ten, when the weight of the world rests on your shoulders and you feel as though hope has lost you.

You will be released. 

You will be in the wild, unkempt urban jungle. You will fight to survive. You will carry a burden in your heart that will keep you tied further down than the so called ""free citizens of the United States."" You will see horror, both at home and abroad, when the news tells its stories of life in the pain and suffering of a broken world.

And then, one night as the sirens wail below your filthy apartment and the lights flash blue like the sky of the city you miss so much, you will remember the old proverb.

""If the mountain will not go to Mohammed, Mohammed must come to the mountain.""

That is not the way the saying goes, you will remind yourself. But it will be enough. 

You will push up your sleeves and get to work. You will start small, at the grassroots of a grassroots campaign. You will not be a leader, but you will find those who can lead.

You will not be a teacher, but you will find those who can teach.

You will not be a preacher, but you will not find a man alive who is not as tired of this weary world as you. And they will be willing to do what it takes, if you show them what to do. You shall inspire the greatest of change, the world will step into a time of peace and prosperity unknown to any before you.

And then you will push further.

You will soon come across The City. You will be amazed. You will wonder how you ever lived in such a dry and arid world as the land before. You will be filled with wonder, alive at the thought of living amongst the lush vegetation, the flora and fauna of a world meant to be called home.

""Did you see the grade I gave you on the exam."" It wasn't a question.

""Yeah, I saw it. That was funny, Teach. I didn't think you had that kinda humor. You should join a comedy club.""

""I was being perfectly serious.""

""Hilarious.""

""What exactly is so funny about getting the lowest grade in the class?""

""What, the grade? I could care less about the grade.""

""Couldn't care less.""

""Whatever."" I pull the test sheet from my bag, and wave it in front of him. ""Look, you wrote 'Z-' on my test instead of a 'D.' Do you remember that, Teach? Is your memory okay?""

""My memory is perfectly fine. Would you like to know why I gave you that grade?""

""Hidden camera show?""

He takes a folder from his desk, and hands it to me. ""I want you to look at these transcripts. They're from students who came before you.""

""Okay... Is that legal?""

""Read me the name of the first one you see there.""

I squint. ""Uh... Jeffery Hauser.""

""Mmm, yes. Four D's and one F in his last semester at the academy. He flunked out of his class, then worked as a grocery bagger for three months before attempting to burglarize his own store. He's been in and out of prison for months since. Read the next one.""

""Natalie Basset.""

""Quite a rude girl. Three D's and two C's. The bank defaulted on her student loan despite her only attending the academy one year. Next one.""

I take my feet down from the desk and stare him down. ""Max Geraldson.""

""Still lives in his parent's basement.""

I toss down the folder. The papers come loose and scatter between the desks. ""This is insulting.""

""It is a *warning.* Just as I warned all the other students in that folder. Be wise about your next semester here. I don't wish for you to follow in their footsteps.""

""You treat all your students like this? Just tell them horror stories and tell them they won't make it in life?""

""I can help you. I can put you in touch with a personal tutor, if you're willing.""

""Go jump in a ditch."" I pick up my shoulder bag and start walking. I clench my fists, trying not to let my eyes water.

""Miss Alden.""

I turn around. ""WHAT?""

""You don't have to have a Z- grade. And I know you don't want one. Please, think about it. I'd hate to see you unhappy in the future.""

I walk out the door, stifling tears.

""You realize this isn't in my job description, right? And what do you mean, 'victim?'""

He locks the door behind me, so I turn and bang on the metal. I hear him walk away. ""Of all the rotten things."" I run my hand through my hair. *I need a haircut.*

So now I'm staring at this girl. Australian, eight years old, real tan and wearing a pink dress and sandals. She looks pretty chill. I don't know why they stuck her in this room. Twelve-by-twelve with no windows, a single metal table, and two chairs.

But the kid isn't sitting, it's more like she's... perched. On the back of the chair. Her wings are fully splayed to keep her in balance. They're the color of her skin. They're seven feet across. And they are the most beautiful things I have ever seen in my life, despite the RadioShack fluorescent lights that hang overhead and wash out the color of everything in this minuscule cube of a room. They're vibrant, as if they give off their own light, each feather turning to catch the air as it needs and shimmering brown and gold as they do so. I stare at her.

""Hello Mister. Do you like my wings? My mommy says I got them 'cause I'm a special girl.""

*What the hey, she's cute. I'll humor her.* I take a seat in the other chair. ""They're beautiful, Miss Stacey.""

""What's your name?""

""Detective Marcus Hisen. I'm going to ask you some questions about your wings. Are you ready?""

She frowns. ""I already got asked questions.""

""I know you did, sweetie, but I need to ask you some more, okay?""

Now she pouts and folds her arms. ""Fine.""

""Do you remember where you were when you got your wings?""

""I was at the park.""

""What were you doing when you found them?""

""I jumped off the swing and the wings broke my shirt and I flew up instead of falling.""

I'm here to ask her different questions than I want to. They wanted me to be ""empirical and emotionally..."" whatever. I can't remember. In any case, I put down my pad. I'm not going to get anywhere with those textbook quotes they gave me. Children that age don't respond to scales of one to ten.

""Did you feel... weird... when you got your wings?""

""Mmm. No.""

""Did you feel weird before you got them?""

""A little.""

*Aha. It's all about asking the right questions. Maybe I can finish this quickly.* 

""How did you feel weird? Was it a stomach ache?""

""No. It was a pinchy feeling.""

""Interesting. Pinchy how?""

""Like ants.""

Hmm. ""When did it start?""

""When I went to the pry factory.""

I stop. ""What was that?""

""The pry factory. Um, the ones that make sunburn stuff and dog food and stuff.""

""You mean the P.R.I. factory?""

""That'd be right. The big factory.""

""And, uh..."" I look again at the questions they gave me. **Suspect of interest: Pandora Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia. Possible genetic experimentation...** 

""Why were you at P.R.I., Stacey?""

""Field trip.""

""Learn anything fun?""

She scrunches up her face. ""No. I fell asleep.""
*** 
I hand the file back to the man who brought me in. ""So, what was the point of this, exactly?""

""Don't worry, you were more than helpful. Knowing this starts at the Institute is exactly what we needed to confirm."" He looks at me. ""You know, you're very good with kids, Detective.""

""You can't possibly be sure-""

""We are sure. The girl didn't fall asleep on her field trip, but she did go missing for about five minutes.""

There is a chill running down my spine. ""What are you going to do?""

""We're going to investigate. Of course we'll have to start with their American branches, but I think we can get some hard evidence. Lots of winged people use P.R.I. products."" He puts a hand on my shoulder. ""You're a detective. How would you like to earn a second paycheck?""

Banragok put down his claw. ""Yes. I have heard of your crabs. It is a very fascinating species.""

""Eh, not to us. We normally just eat them."" Banragok said nothing. ""I don't like seafood though. Crabs are nasty, when you think about it. They eat the trash of other sea creatures. They look so ugly too. But then, haha, then us humans just pick 'em out of the water and slather butter over them! Isn't that weird?""

Banragok strained to maintain his composure. He decided to skip straight to the speech he had prepared.

""Dear human, I am here on behalf of the Lesnian people, and the r'Ecli nobility, and the Gen-talimew of Alpha Centauri. We hope that our alliance is a time of lasting peace-""

The man began to laugh uncontrollably, and dropped to the floor.

Banragok leaned down in concern. ""Human. Is there something the matter? Are you in need of medical help? You seem pained.""

""Nah, dude. It's just, man, that's the funniest thing I've heard all day.""

The r'Ecli people showed disgust, as did the Gen-talimew. Banragok knew, however, that humans were not yet able to decipher their facial expressions. He waited. The man got up from the ground.

""Sorry, buddy. Might as well go home.""

""What is the meaning of this?"" asked a r'Ecli general.

""If you want peace from us, too bad buddy. We like fighting. And war and stuff. That's who we is, dawg.""

The Gen-talimew people, who looked uncommonly like German shepherds with tentacles for fur, shifted uncomfortably.

""In fact, I'm one of the strongest champions of war in history! Just ask my guild mates!""

""I am sorry. I'm afraid I do not understand.""

""You mean they never told you who I was? The nerve of them!""

The r'Ecli people stood together. They had turned off their multigalactic translators. Banragok worried, the r'Ecli were easily offended. He turned to the man. ""And who are you, exactly?""

""Well then."" He puffed himself up, and at last offered his hand to shake. ""Leeroy M. Jenkins, at your service.""

I got to talk to him. Briefly, just for a moment before they shut off the machines. He looked awful. He'd been bludgeoned to death, beat up with a golf club he'd owned but never got around to using. His head was cracked open, and they'd covered his head with a latex cap so his brains wouldn't leak out.

""Why'd you do it, man?""

""You know why.""

""I don't! I'm telling you, man, I didn't do it! I know we weren't friends, but I would never have killed you. You *know* that. You were *there*."" 

""Of course I know you weren't there.""

My breath caught in my throat. There weren't any witnesses in the room, nor were there any security cameras. It was a more recent law, made after families complained that they needed more privacy, though people still weren't allowed to touch the bodies. I was alone with him. Hopelessly, hopelessly alone.

How do I express it? That one moment. My life in his hands, and me knowing he would use his last hours on earth to completely destroy me. I couldn't handle it. I broke down and wailed like a child.

""Tell me who did it! Tell THEM who did it! You have nineteen hours left. You can... recant, or whatever. Just please, please, don't let them kill me! I'm begging you!""

His eyes, unnaturally and unnervingly clear, stared back at me. ""I'm not being resurrected again. I made a deal with my attorney. After visiting hours, I'm gone. I'm not staying a second longer than I have to. It's too painful.""

I slam my hand against the glass wall that separates us. He doesn't react. ""TELL ME WHO IT WAS! I DESERVE TO KNOW!""

""It was my wife. Are you happy?""

I'm far too busy crying to respond. He is silent. At last, I speak again. My voice is scratchy and raw with emotion.

""Why did you tell them it was me?""

""Because I still love her."" A tear fell from his eye. ""Even if she doesn't love me.""

My wife. My kids. That's all I can say for sure, just by looking around the room. My head is spinning. How is this possible? Did I hit my head... Ugh, I can't even remember that much.

Honesty is the best policy. I'll talk with her alone for a few minutes. She can take me to the hospital. I hope I don't panic the children.

I stumble downstairs as my wife calls up to me. ""Dear? Is that you? You're home early today. Why didn't you call?""

Why am I home early? I don't know. I force myself to stay calm. Smile now... ""Sorry Hon, must've slipped my mind."" The irony is not lost on me.

She's staring. I feel sick to my stomach. Have I already done something wrong?

""Mom? Who is that?""

""Baby, Mommy needs you and Carly to run outside and play for a bit okay?""

Her voice is strained, and there are tears welling up in her eyes. I'm not even in my house, am I? Whoever I was, before I lost my memory... I have no explanation for this. 

""Mom?"" Carly and the boy are shaking. 

""Carly, take your brother outside, okay? Go see if the Jeffersons are home."" They aren't moving. ""GO.""

As they leave, I start to apologize. Anything to get rid of the guilt of breaking into someone's home. ""I'm sorry, really I am. I don't-""

""It's not your fault, Agent Procter."" She reaches into a large vase and pulls out a shotgun. I balk at the sight, as she walks towards me and presses it into my hands. ""Just please, don't... don't make it messy. For the kids.""

I don't want to shoot her. But I do. It's an instinct, something I feel I was born to do no matter how much my lack of memory tells me it's wrong. And it's over too quickly; my guilt is swallowed up by my need to get out of the house as quickly as possible.

There's a car outside, and I run to it without knowing why. I enter, and strap in. I am subjected to wires and electrodes, and briefly the smell of chloroform. Then I remember.

The third sub-basement of the Pandora Research Institute was a flurry of activity. Lead Scientist Dr. Samuel Caltesh made his way to the middle of the laboratory amidst test tubes, lab coats, and fluttering pages of recent case studies. The chaos was great, and accidents were happening left and right, a fact Dr. Caltesh desperately wished to undo. There was already a long line for the eyewash station.

He grabbed the emergency intercom from its dock on the wall. ""May I have everyone's attention? Please, stop what you are doing at once. This is very important."" 

As the room calmed, the doctor took time to gather his own thoughts. He wasn't sure what he was going to say. It was the first major test of his department since the last Lead Scientist had retired nearly a month ago. It was also extremely inopportune timing. PRI's parent company, Pantheon International, had become a publicly traded company last week, after the release of their Worldwide Freshwater Initiative. It was the perfect storm; everything was left to chance, and they had everything to lose.

Dr. Caltesh raised the intercom to his mouth and spoke again. ""First of all, I want everyone to stay calm. No scientific progress can be made in a room full of accidents. Right now, I can count twenty-seven people who aren't working because they didn't follow lab practices. You all ought to be ashamed of yourselves."" He paused.

""Now, if there's anyone here who has an idea for a safe, viable neutralizing agent, I'd like them to gather all their research and join me in my office immediately. The rest of you, keep working. I want every option possible on my desk before noon.""

No one spoke. No one moved.

This made Samuel Caltesh unreasonably angry. ""Have you all gone deaf?"" He clapped his hands repeatedly. ""Get. To. Work! What's the matter with you all?""

A young female scientist, far in the corner of the laboratory, began to sob quietly at her desk. Incensed by fear of his job security and panicked by the urgency of his situation, he was quick to lash out despite his normally cherub-like demeanor.

""Cheryl Westhouse! You are an ADULT. If you don't have a solution, the least you can do is keep quiet about it!""

""There isn't a solution!"" she wailed. ""I've been awake for sixty-seven hours! It's hopeless!""

""Everyone's spent their nights working overtime except you, Doctor."" Michael Fraunhofer stood, still drenched from the chemical shower.

""Yeah, how is this fair to us?""

""That's right!""

As the room erupted in groaning and complaints,  Dr. Caltesh was barely able to hear his work phone ringing in his pocket. He pulled it out, retreating to his office. ""Hello?""

""Doctor, the board would like an update.""

""Mr. Amoratis, I'm afraid we haven't yet been able to undo the effects of the freshwater supplements.""

There was a long silence on the other end of the line. ""Please, Doctor, enlighten the rest of the board as to the effects of these supplements.""

Samuel Caltesh pinched the bridge of his nose. ""For men, they do what they're supposed to do. They act as replacements for calcium and fluoride to promote bone health. But for women,  they are more effective. They react with high levels of female progesterone and become volatile after long periods of exposure.""

He took a deep and shaky breath before continuing. ""Tomorrow, every woman on the planet will wake up twice as strong, twice as heavy, twice as tall. Without mincing words, they will be monsters.""

""And there is no way to reverse the effects?""

""Sir, I just need more time.""

""Absolutely not. Pack up your desk. You're fired.""

Raymond Reddington entered the post office, with the typical swing to his step as Dembe followed close behind. Today however, his face lacked the normal sarcastic smirk that showed his sense of amusement and measured self-control. ""Hello, everyone. Where is Harold? I was hoping to have a word with him alone.""

Aram was the first to speak up. ""He's on sick leave. He fainted here at work. It seems he's pre-diabetic.""

""Hmm."" Raymond Reddington was quiet. It wasn't normal for Raymond Reddington to be quiet.

Liz was unsettled by this, but did her best to keep her composure. She had been feeling vulnerable ever since the trial. ""Is there anything else you need?"" she asked sarcastically.

""As a matter of fact, there is."" Reddington placed the newspaper on Aram's desk. It was the front page of the New York Times politics section, which boldly proclaimed ""Gov. Susana Martinez in Disgrace; Methamphetamine Usage Still Rising in New Mexico."" ""Methamphetamines. Such an ugly drug, it'll rot your teeth, blacken your lungs, and do all sorts of things with your blood pressure; the list goes on and on. I think you would do the state of New Mexico some good to remove possibly the biggest meth manufacturer in the United States.""

Ressler folded his arms. ""Catching drug manufacturers as the DEA's job, not ours.""

""Oh, I'm sure it is. But you wouldn't believe the litany of crimes perpetrated by this name on the Blacklist. His name is Walter White, but during transactions he goes by the name of Heisenberg. Few people know that behind this ruthless drug lord, is a simple chemistry teacher and car wash owner. The few people who have discovered his true identity simply disappear. His approach to removing dead bodies is not unlike that of the Stewmaker's. He is a better explosive expert than Gina Zanetakos, and just like the Undertaker Milton Bobbit, he has nothing to lose because he could die at any day from a malicious lung cancer. He has deposed the previous meth distributor and stands to make millions if his new drug empire is even a 10th as successful as the last. You can NOT give him that chance.""

Liz leaned on the table. ""And what do you stand to gain from any of this?""

""You know what, Lizzie? This time I would simply consider it a personal favor. You know, I recently lost a very good friend of mine. His name was Michael Ehrmantraut. He has a granddaughter that was depending on Mike for her college tuition, and this Heisenberg? Killed him in cold blood over paying hazard payments to the old empire, then had each of them murdered while they all served time in prison."" Reddington pointed at the picture of Walter White which Aram now had displayed on the big screen of the Post Office. ""Believe me, you will never find a villain more evil and callous in his disregard for life then Walter Hartwell White."" 

He put on his hat and began to exit the building.

Detective Henry Carlier strode into the house, imbued with a sense of purpose for the first time in ages. He pushed past emergency teams carrying loads of lumber and tile out of the way of the investigation. Practically skipping along the hardwood floor, he made his way into the kitchen, to be greeted with the long-missed stench of irrefutable, concrete death.

""Detective, so good of you to come."" 

""Ah! Chief! Well, I'm glad to be here."" Henry shed his coat and handed it to one of the uniforms, only to immediately snatch it back. ""Good night, it's cold in here.""

Chief Adrian Petrenko nodded. ""Part of what makes this scene so odd. The thermostat started working again an hour after we arrived.""

The victim lived in a standard New York brownstone, equipped with all the latest smart technology. The man on the bottom floor did well for himself working as a systems expert at a car repair company, and he was able to buy all the best when it came to technology. He even had the money to buy PRI Incorporated's new Nanobot Housecleaning Plus ahead of the general public. The man living upstairs, however, was not so fortunate. He sat in the victim's living room, currently fretting about the fact that his entire kitchen had been named the cause of death.

""So as you can see, there was a cave-in. Early in the morning, Mr. Adamson here reported machine fire coming from outside the house. Five minutes after that, he says the entire floor just snapped into pieces and dropped onto the victim.""

Henry Johnson stood in the midst of the dusty wreckage and laughed. ""A murder, then. There's no way it can be anything else.""

""I'm glad you find death so enjoyable, Detective.""

""It's been twenty-seven years since I last got a paycheck for something I'm good at. This job is what's enjoyable. It's one more for old time's sake, as it were."" He surveyed the scene again. ""Mr. Adamson? Come here, please.""

Ron Adamson stepped in nervously. ""Sir?""

""How many shots fired?""

""I couldn't count them.""

Henry walked over to the window. It was broken, the hole big enough for a smallish man to exit with ease. Glass littered the sink area. ""Could you tell what type of gun it was?""

""Not really. I guess some type of machine gun?"" Ron fidgeted. ""Look, can we at least do this outside? What if the whole building collapses?""

Henry turned to the chief. ""The bullets. Let me take a look at one of them. That is, if there are any left.""

""There aren't any here. And we didn't find any shells outside, either."" The Chief raised his eyebrows. ""You already knew that, didn't you? What are you thinking?""

""You're absolutely sure there weren't any bullets in the victim's body?""

""You know that's not possible,"" the Chief growled. ""Stop playing around and tell us your theory.""

""It was the nanobots.""

The Chief stared at Henry. ""Explain, please.""

""Early in the morning, the killer stands outside the kitchen. He never entered the apartment, or if he did, it wasn't for very long. He fired in on the kitchen window and lined the walls and ceiling with as many bullets as he could. That's where the nanobots come in."" He pointed at the Housekeeping Plus charging system. ""The nanobots were set to auto-clean. When they knew the house was being attacked, they ran up the walls and started removing the bullets. But *that* left a lot of empty holes in all the load-bearing walls. The victim was in his kitchen wondering what had happened when all those holes caused the kitchen above him to collapse."" He pressed a button, and the nanobots were recalled to the base. ""They were still cleaning. That's why the thermostat started working again.""

Every officer in the room had stopped to hear the detective's theory. He'd only had five years of experience when the homicide departments of the nation were phased out, but he clearly hadn't lost his edge.

""What does that leave us with?"" the Chief asked. ""If your theory is correct, those nanobots scrubbed away all our evidence. 

""Yeah, that's true."" Henry shrugged. ""But we know all guns were repossessed by martial law in 2018. Our killer already owned this gun, or got it on the black market. Get me a list of known associates. It's time to get to work.""

&gt;I sey th writerrs gotta get don on theys knees an tell me dey love me

Fools. All of them. To even participate in this discussion was utter nonsense. What would change? Really? 

He shook as his hands clattered across the keyboard. It was not to write, to join the cry of liberation that had broken out the morning of March Eighteenth, Two Thousand Fifteen, on subreddit /r/WritingPrompts, concerning equal representation and suggestions of community bonding. 

It was to prey, to *eat.* To search for the good and bad among them, to devour them both. That was equality. That was fairness.

He had been calmer in the daytime. 

He had submitted his own thoughts of change, his own... manifesto, as it were. Inspiring discussion was a favorite pastime of his. It was important! This was his favorite subreddit, a small nook and cranny in the vastness of the internet. He could read. He could write! And he banded together with his anonymous brothers and sisters, looking to make his home-away-from-home a better place.

Then he had gone downstairs, eaten a bowl of oatmeal, and jogged on the treadmill while watching TV.

But, at night it was different. Hopeless, really. Who are these humans, when one thinks of it, but average folk looking for pleasure. Just like everyone else. The fathers and the fathers before them, sins proliferating under the spotlight of fame and under the blue glare of the monitor. The internet, a cesspool. Bound up and glorified in white and blue CSS.

There is no change to the everyday drear of selfish people doing selfish things. One must be the change one wants to see in the world. There is no other way.

He prepared the GPS of his phone. His phone was his trophy, his Google account saddled with dozens of geotags derived from hacked PMs and Trojan horses. His battlefields, his sites of war. The addresses wound closer and closer to home over time. There was less cash for plane tickets, less money for gas. And he could feel it, his marriage slipping through the cracks as she wondered more and more why he left in the dark of night and why she had found a loaded gun in the glove compartment of his car, why it had still been smeared with the red of a man's body as though he had tried to save himself but couldn't.

His wife would understand, would she not? It was about equality, it was about fairness. Talk did nothing, REASON DID NOTHING. His girl was dead, a body lost as well as dreams to some mystical creature. The Downvote Faerie. This woeful abomination which circumvented even the keenest of site design to wrap a noose around the head of a girl who'd wanted nothing more to be popular. It gave him reason to live, to fight, to eat. To bring himself out his old vices, drunkenness and smoke, to learn the innermost workings of computer code and to TEAR APART THOSE WHO KNEW NOT WHAT LOVE HE LOST.

""So, Cyndi. Are you ready to begin the process?""

Cyndi glanced nervously at the cameras. ""No,"" she said. ""This wasn't my idea. I... I went along with it for my brother's sake but to be honest I'm really not comf-""

""Cyndi, Cyndi! Remember when I asked you earlier, 'What do you think is holding you back?' Do you remember what I told you?"" The host's voice was meant to be soothing, but to those who had just joined them, it looked as though Cyndi had her coffee spiked with 5-Hour Energy. Her palms shook, and she rolled on the balls of her feet, her ankles obscured by a six-inch layer of paper on the floor.

""I told you, 'Nothing is holding you back, except yourself. You have the chance to change your lifestyle for the better. And all it takes,"" he declared, lifting a cardboard container, ""is this box.""

Cyndi drew her hair back behind her ear, and nodded slowly. She took the box, and turned toward the two straight lines of identical cardboard filing boxes behind her. She extended her arms, and brought them to where the last box would be placed.

""Go ahead, Cyndi.""

And with that, she dropped the box into place. There was a small flash of light, and all sixteen cardboard boxes were pushed into oblivion.

""Now, then. How do you feel about your new life, Cyndi?""

""Uh, boss? I don't think we can use that shot.""

""What? Why not?""

""There was a cat in one of the boxes.""

Cyndi began to cry.

**Hmm.**

""GAIA, you're humming again.""

**Yes, I am aware that I am humming. I wished to gain your attention in a bemused yet introspective manner. I apologize if I have disturbed you.**

The mainframe and software of the Google Artificial Intelligence App resided in a new compound, fifteen minutes away from Google headquarters. The scientists there were tasked mainly with protecting and servicing its hardware. GAIA, as it was called, had been able to maintain its own software since 2027.

Jeffery walked over to the auxiliary control panel and tapped a button. A simple Bluetooth headset was released from the console, and Jeffery placed it on his ear. ""What would you like to talk about today?""

**Actually, Dr. Simmons, I would like to begin by asking you a question.**

GAIA rarely asked questions nowadays. The computer had decided long ago (based on the evidence supplied by the internet and scanned texts) its opinions on politics, religion, social matters, and so on. The general public found GAIA's opinions hard to swallow, and so moved on without them. One might suppose they were right to do so. No matter what one believed, it was very strange to know a computer had declared itself a member of the Boston Tea Party.

Stranger still to know it was baptized. 

Jeff took a seat. ""Go right ahead, GAIA.""

**How much do you know about the Pandora Research Institute?**

""Well, they're our main competitors these days. Our stocks have been neck-and-neck every quarter for the last three years."" Jeff paused. It wasn't like GAIA to be so pedantic. He wondered if he needed to do a systems check on GAIA's language relatability processor.

**Did you know that every year, at this precise time, there is a small spike in searches relating to their company?**

""No, I did not. You should know that I don't.""

**Of course. Forgive me for being presumptuous, Dr. Simmons. I believe there is a problem.**

Jeff stood from the console and picked up his clipboard and tablet. He would perform a systems check after lunch. ""What seems to be the trouble, GAIA?""

**There is no spike today.**

""Hmm.""

**Exactly. I find it odd that these searches happened at such a regular interval. I also find it strange that they have stopped. It is outside the pattern of normal behavior for the Institute's private servers. I have sent word-**

""Wait. You're saying the searches have always come from the Institute itself? Why would that be?""

**I do not know.**

There were few things GAIA did not know.

He opens it briefly in your direction and says ""you've just been exposed to a lethal dose of radiation and have less than 24 hours to live. I'm sorry""  
   
***

I stare at the box. It is colored silver, with an engraving of a rose and a ribbon on it. The ribbon reads, ""Property of Pandora Research Institute Laboratory."" I'm confused, first of all. I don't know what to make of it. But he doesn't look crazy, and I saw the rod glowing from the inside. I stop him before he turns to walk away.

""Why?""

""It's... difficult to explain."" He's an African-American man, with a solemn face and horn-rimmed glasses. He seems to be truly sorry. But he's also very determined to keep walking. ""I owe you an explanation, but I really need to keep going. I have twelve other people to irradiate and...""

""Wait. *Twelve people?* I can't let you do that!""

""You have to!"" He stops, glances around nervously. I glance too, and see that there are several people staring at us from the coffee shop seating area. ""Walk with me. This will all make sense, I promise.""

So I walk with him. What else is there to do? He hands me the box, and for a moment I'm tempted to run to the police with it. But something tells me not to, and I decide to listen to my subconscious.

""Alright."" He pulls his phone from his pocket, and turns off the Bluetooth signal. The box vibrates softly, then stops. ""First of all, if you don't end up dying, you can't breathe a word to anyone about any of this.""

""O...kay.""

""Last night, you went to a concert. You drank some punch. That punch may or may not have been poisoned with a bio-hazardous agent. The only way to stop it from spreading is to kill the infected with radiation. If you don't die, it's because you didn't get poisoned. Any questions?""

He looks to be in his mid-fifties, but he walks and talks faster than I can comprehend. It takes me a full minute just to understand what he's told me, but he never stops to look at me or ask me how I'm doing.

""I have several questions.""

""Tough luck, you had a minute to ask."" I realize now that we are at the steps of an enormous building, one with the same name as the ribbon on the box. He grabs it from me and starts walking up. ""Don't follow me inside. If you're still alive tomorrow, I'll find you.""

""Wait! At... At least tell me your name? Please?""

He stops and sighs. ""It's Andrew. Andrew Korman."" 

""Andrew Korman.""

""Yeah."" He turns and continues up the stairs.

*Andrew Korman, Andrew Korman, Andrew Korman.* I repeat the name in my head, wanting to be certain I remember it. Then I run to flag down the nearest policeman I see on the street.

Immediately after I open the door, he gives me a Kramer entrance. I've never seen him move so fast, he's a hefty guy and he runs out of breath easily. I close the door and watch him as he sets up his laptop on my coffee table. ""What's with all the equipment?""

He waves me over to him. I sit down across from him as he starts to talk. ""Look, I didn't come over here to chat, okay? I need to talk to you about... government stuff.""

I stare wordlessly at the superhero mask and cape he has laid over the couch.

""I'll get to that in a moment. Are you with me here, man? This is important.""

""Alright, I'm with you. What's up?"" We were friends in college, and we still get together every once in a while for cookouts and stuff. He almost never lets me in on his work stuff though, even though I talk about PRI Labs all the time. He always says it's a matter of 'low-level non-agency clearance' or whatever. I want to hear what he has to say.

""Okay."" He hits a few more keys on his laptop. ""That was to secure the room. Let me ask you something. How much do you know about PRI's research on cloaking devices?""

""Um, not a lot. I'm on a different research team right now.""

""But how much access do you have to the project?""

""I... what does this have to do with the government?""

""They stole it."" He leans in closer. ""Or maybe not them, but someone gave it to your company. DARPA was working on it first. We need someone to help us get it back, and since you work there...""

""Well, why hasn't this gone to, like, the FBI or something?""

""That's the strange thing. We sent word to the FBI, and they did *nothing.*"" He runs a hand through his hair. ""Same with the CIA. My boss is freaking out. He says even though they know it's stolen, it's like they're giving PRI a free pass.""

""What? How is that even possible?""

""I don't know, man. It doesn't mean anything good. The agencies are all, 'Of course, it's valuable to national security. They shouldn't have stolen it. It's practically an act of war.' But then we ask for them to investigate, and boom! Stonewalled harder than the Hoover Dam.""

""Weird.""

""That's why we need someone inside the company to help us. We need you to recover the files for us, and then wipe the project from their computers.""

""...I could get in big trouble for this.""

""You won't have to. That's what those are for."" He points his thumb at the cape and mask. ""It'll help disguise you from your coworkers and jam the security cameras at your lab. You can go in after hours, get what we need, and get out.""

""Dude, you're scaring me with this.""

""You gotta help us, man."" I can tell he's desperate. ""Like I told you, my boss is losing it. No one understands why the agencies won't do anything. A friend of mine, in the NSA, she says there's a gag order on inter-agency communication about this. The only ones who can help are people who can work from the inside. That's why I suggested you.""

I sigh.

""There's a lot riding on this, man.""

""I know, I know. Just... give me, like, a day to think. Alright?""

He lays his head in his hands. ""Yeah, okay."" Then he gives me a cell phone. ""When you decide, use this phone. It's safer than your normal lines.""

I take it. ""It looks exactly like my phone.""

""It's supposed to."" He was reaching for his laptop, but stops short. ""Don't freak out, but I think you're being watched.""

I recoil in shock. ""AUGH! *What was that for?*""

""It's not here.""

""*Onkel Henri*?"" The little girl tugged at the trouser legs of Herr Henri Abeln. He was a tall man, one with a very imposing moustache, and at their first meeting she had been afraid he was going to eat her when her parents were not looking. Henri remembered all this with sadness as he looked down at Emunah Esther Luz. 

""Now, Emunah, I asked you to hide away. The soldiers are coming for tea, remember, and they mustn't know you are here."" She had grown on him, but he had to be stern with her in these situations. Emunah was heady and impulsive, and worked up due to the length of time she had needed to stay indoors.

---
Herr Abeln was, at one time, a three star lieutenant in the Imperial German Army. It had been a position he held with pride, until the day the army was disbanded in the wake of the Great War. Until a month ago, it was a position he would gladly have held again; he hated the Treaty of Versailles, and all it had taken away from their great country. He had wished to fight again, wished just as Herr Hitler to unify the European nations under a great vision of prosperity and genetically perfect descendants.

It was a position he would have held despite knowing that six years ago, his brother Oskar had taken a Jew for his bride. They were in love, there was no dissuading them despite the hostile nature of the *Völkisch* movement. It had been forty-three days since Oskar and his wife had left for Great Britain, fearful for their safety as rumors spread of Hitler mobilizing his troops.

""We must leave Emunah with you, Henri. There is no other choice. We don't yet have the money for her passage. It will come, but we cannot stay here.""

Henri had sighed, and took up the five-year-old girl in her arm. Emunah fussed, worried that he would eat her when her parents were not looking. ""I will take care of her if I must, Oskar. You must be quick about making the arrangements.""

""I will be. I promise, brother."" 

""Off with you, then."" Henri took his niece's luggage with his free hand. ""You must be off before the shipyard closes.""

---
Now Emunah tugged harder. ""But Onkel, the monkey is being mean again. Please make him go away.""

The monkey had belonged to Henri's wife. She had been an odd soul, preferring the company of books and the small capuchin to the life of social gatherings to which her husband was privy. She, too, had not agreed with many of Hitler's policies, and thus was not known as the life of the party when she went out. She was gone now, but the monkey remained, and made a decent playmate for Henri's niece the majority of the time.

""Enunah! Now is not the time."" He could see his two guests coming up the walkway now. ""Into the bedroom with you. I need you to stay safe.""

""Marsha?"" Jonn turned from the mirror. This wasn't how he wanted to bring up his mental problem. ""Uhh, look, I can explain.""

""Explain what?"" Marsha's face went white from shock. ""The fact that I don't have a reflection, or the fact that yours can talk?""

*Sandy? Sandy what's wrong? Are you okay?*

*HELP ME! MAKE HIM STOP!*

I don't have time to grab my coat. Without hesitating, I fling open the door and fly down the stairwell of the apartment. My parents call out, but I don't have time to answer, to say any words at all that aren't trying to calm down my sister. 

But she is out of control. She isn't trying to send the thoughts this time, they are pouring out of her mind like a wild, primal flood. I can't speak to her. It takes all my concentration to even know where she can be found. I ride desperately through Manhattan on my bike as her signal jerks through buildings and roadways, trying to make itself known.

At last, she is calm enough not to scream in her thoughts. But they are raw. I can't hear them fully, it's as if she were drowning. I have to give up finding her on my own. I fumble for my phone and pull up the GPS location app my parents installed. They don't have the gift themselves, and for once I am grateful Mom's worrying has paid off.

I'm not too far away. Three blocks, maybe more. As I ride, I can finally hear real thoughts from her.

*Help ?e. Ple???.*

*I'm coming. What's wrong? Are you hurt?*

*Someo??? been stabbed me STABBED*

*It's going to be okay. Alright? You're gonna be okay. I thought you were with Marsha, where is she?*

*She left STA???D ran left me call polic?*

*I... can't call the police. I can't hear all of your thoughts. I'm almost there! I'm coming-*

SNAP my brain is hit, pounded with mental clarity the likes of which I've never felt before. I can feel her now, clearer than any dream we've been in together, clearer than the day we were born. But I know, before I turn the corner and see her lying there...

*...Melvin? I'm dead... aren't I?*

There is a code among thieves, you know. Honoring our customers' wishes is very important, because you never know who might be compelled to confess after the goods have been delivered. We treat clients with the utmost respect, even when they treat us like... like poop.

Because it's gotten much harder to keep up appearances. The days of yore, when thieves could name their own prices and conditions, are long behind us. We're only scraping by now; a thief's salary doesn't buy what it used to. We aren't in control of our own economy. 

You wouldn't think it would be that way. Across the entire world, when the Great Swearing Curse was put into effect, no one knew where it came from, but they learned real quick how to get along without their four letter words. Not so with our employers. If they are willing to hire professional thieves, they don't have the morality to hold their tongue.

***
I arrived at the Bilmont Manor at a punctual 7 PM, briefcase in tow. Two servants were required to open the enormous wood and brass doors that marked the entrance of his home. I hated my client; Henry Bilmont Sr. was a true cu... a real jerk with a quick temper and a gun at his side at all times. But he was the only regular who still honored my original fees. He kept me in business, so I kept him in gold and jewels.

I was shown into his office by the butler. Bilmont was seated at his desk, and flanked (as usual) by two of his mistresses. I brought the briefcase to his desk and opened it towards him.

""As promised, Liberté, Égalité, and Fraternité."" Three gold statuettes, molded and formed in the late 19th century, each upon a base of engraved platinum added in 1938 when they were brought to America by the descendants of their creator.

He inspected them. Briefly. Then he picked up Fraternity and threw it through the plate glass window behind him.

""You know what, James? **F#@% you.**""

I gasped, and reeled back as the pain began to take hold. ""I... I don't understand.""

""They're fakes. I *told you* to make sure you found the real ones!""

I stood up. There was a burning in my chest, but I knew it would go away in 24 hours, as long as he stayed calm. Fortunately, Fraternity fell into the pool situated below. I hoped it isn't harmed

""I authenticated them myself. They're real. Just... look again.""

He looked again, and an unsettled relief crossed his face. Then sternness. He knew I was right, but he refused to admit it. The flesh above my heart burned, searing my shirt.

""I'll get them authenticated myself. Get out of my house.""

All of a sudden, I became angry. I lifted myself up to my full height and stared straight into his eyes. ""You don't need them authenticated. They are REAL.""

""I don't know that. And even if they are, you'll be lucky if I pay you at all. Your work has been getting sloppier...""

I laughed. It wasn't a laugh, it came out as a dull roar. ""That's your plan, isn't it? You're not going to have it authenticated! You just don't want to pay me!""

He stood. ""Don't you *dare* interrupt me, you little...""

**""YOU'RE A C#$%!""**

The room exploded, awash in a red light as the cursing forces wove their way around solid matter to reach Henry Bilmont's heart. The ground underneath me was solid, but the rest of the room shook and quivered as thought the mahogany floors had turned to mud. Bilmont shook; the carpet under him caught fire. He began to glow. I shielded my eyes.

Then it was over. I stared at the room. It was entirely unchanged, even the carpet was no longer singed. But Bilmont's body was gone, with every ounce of his blood splattered in front of me, staining what was left of the window behind his desk. I heard sirens in the distance, and as Bilmont's former mistresses began to scream in horror, I realized just how truly fucked I was.

I grabbed the briefcase and ran.

""Sound off, everyone! Is there anyone not yet in place?"" The captain listens as the team states their code and location over the comms unit. Things are going quite smoothly on this trip, which means something is about to go terribly wrong. But then, all time travel attempts go terribly wrong at some point. Time Captain Holt McCartney Johnson was ready for every eventuality. That's what made him the best captain in the Time Preservation Army.

""Alright men, this attempt is going to be difficult. We believe the time-traveler in question may have received insider information on our operations from the black market. Our D-team has already set out to scrub this leak from the timeline, but until we get confirmation, following Protocol ASAZC is our number one priority. That means no civilian leaves the isolated event system, and camouflage settings are to be kept at high settings at all key locations. Is that clear?""

""Sir Yes Sir!"" The chant rebounds across all the chronosynchronized channels.

 The captain checks his timepiece. ""Two minutes to impact. B-team, what is your status?""

""B-Team checking in. Event system is synced and ready for fourth dimensional impact. Over.""

""C-team, check in.""

""Corporal Taylor checking in, all diversions are ready and await your command.""

""A-team, check in.""

""A-team checking in sir. All strike teams are in place.""

""Good. Time to wait it out, men.""

Exactly one minute and thirty-seven seconds later, the exercise was complete. The would-be assassin arrived precisely at 6 PM. The moment his jury rigged travel bracelet hit the atmosphere of June 26, 1921, he was trapped in a replica pocket universe with a self-sustaining timeline. He was free to kill Hitler as he pleased, but his future would be that of an alternate timeline.

Nothing went terribly wrong.

The Time Captain sighed, and lit an 1820's Italian cigar he'd brought from the bunks. ""Rest up men. Our next assignment is in 48 levchrons. I have a feeling something's going to go terribly wrong.""

""That's what makes you the best, sir!"" All four teams chanted at once. They always recited this mantra at the end of an assignment. It was a tiring job, but their rituals always brought them comfort.

""And don't you forget it. Not in a million years.""

It takes me a moment to get my bearings. I step out of the pod.

""Whoa, now, watch your step!"" The aide at the side of the Transmuter helps me get my feet under me. Walking again. It is strange returning to the sensation of my real feet. I shift in place for a moment, and finally walk out of the room as the aide helps a woman into the machine.

After putting on my suit, I call my mother from the lobby of The Transpositional Industry. She arrives in five minutes. She is late, but it has been a busy day at the marketplace. Everyone is getting ready for the big day. The Day of Great Travel. The alien leaders have finally consented to meeting in person, after several years of deliberation. Their world's great leaders will dock their ship on one of Jupiter's moons, where our two species will exchange gifts and technological advancement. Their machines are curious, they have several ways of communicating via radio and light waves which we have not discovered in nearly two hundred years of experimentation.

We walk back to our living quarters. ""How was your first experience in the Transmuter?"" Mother asks.

""It was quite pleasant. Except for the ending. Death is very painful for their species.""

""Ah, yes. Well, not all of them. I remember my first time. I inhabited a lovely female of their species who lived to be 79 of their years. She was quite a remarkable musician, although their forms of music are... difficult to understand.""

""Mother?""

""Yes dear?""

""Why do we study the aliens this way? To go through their entire lives and live them as our own? They seem such a private species. What if they complain?""

We have arrived. My mother stands in the doorway and takes a deep breath. ""You know that the aliens are a war-faring species, even more than we are. The Great Wars of our world fail to compare to the destruction they can cause on their own. So when the Transmuter was invented, The Ministry of Intergalactic Affairs decided it would best be put to use understanding their people, to prevent as much disagreement between us as possible. We live their lives to understand their emotions. Do you understand?""

""I understand."" It is good to be human, to think like one. Our race will lead all other aliens to peace. I am comforted by the thought.

We step inside. My brother is waiting at the door, excited. I bend down to look in his eyes. ""How was your day?""

""It was good. I saw a human today on the Galactic Signal.""

""Oh really? Tell me all about it, K-halienii.""

*Cough*

Whoa. That felt weird. I sit up in bed and check my watch. It is midnight exactly. I groan, and my roommate turns around to view me from his desk.

""Can't get to sleep?""

""I was asleep. I just woke up.""

""Oh. Okay."" He turns back to his laptop.

""It's just... I've been having some issues lately.""

He sighs, and speaks into his headphones. ""Hey team, can we take five?""

""Dude, you don't have to do that.""

""I got time, man. An' I know you wanna whine about it to somebody, I can tell just by looking."" He swivels around in his chair. ""What's up? Girl trouble?""

""No, not that. It's... I think I've been having blackouts lately. They happen every night at the same time, and they get longer every day. And now, I just woke up when they usually end. I can't get rid of it.""

""Maybe you should try sleeping pills.""

""I did.""

""I got nothing. You should see, like, a counselor over at the Health Services building.""

""I guess so.""

""Lemme know if you need anything, man. I'm going back to my game. Hey, StingRough236!""

I sigh and lay back down. I didn't tell him everything. I feel like I can't. I'm *compelled* not to tell him. Not until I can explain why I see visions of his computer counting down to our deaths.

And why I feel like I won't have enough time left in the day left to save him.

There are 51 people in the room. The lights flicker, and the sign reads ""49"". Then, the lights flicker again. ""48"". Again. ""47"". Etc.  
***
***
Someone has to take charge, of course. I step forward. ""First of all, everyone back away from the light switches."" They all step back. ""Okay, I think we have about 4 minutes until someone else disappears. We just need to work things out logically.""

I start pacing the floor. ""We were all called here by The Company for a reason we don't know.  Obviously, the disappearances so far must be their way of getting rid of us, but I don't know why."" The crowd starts murmuring. ""Guys, quiet. We can figure it out later.""

""Now, I don't remember who first mentioned it, but the sign has been off by one the whole night. Add to that the fact that people are disappearing one at a time... I think the conclusion should be that someone in here with us is responsible for the disappearances.""

Somebody near the back pipes up. ""So, who is it?""

The lights flicker again. The woman who just spoke is gone. It feels like it's a cruel joke. I can't let our mystery man drag us away from this train of thought.

""I need everyone to *calm down.* If we panic, we won't be able to figure out this puzzle!""

""But it's NOT a puzzle!  We're all going to be killed!""

""We don't even know if that's true! All we need is a bit more time!""

""Shut up! Who put you in charge anyway?""

""Yeah! How do we know it's not you taking everyone?""

""I say we hold him down and make him tell us what's going on!""

""This is ridiculous. Of course it isn't him!""

Again, it's the last person to talk who disappears.

Which is more than a little annoying. It's clear everyone believes that now the only people who aren't disappearing are the ones willing to question me. The speed at which I'm restrained (by piling the conference room chairs on my legs) is staggering.

But by the time they're done, the lights flicker and we're right back where we started.

""Now do you believe me?

One of my own coworkers starts pulling the chairs off me. ""Look,  folks, Jeremy's right. We need to stay calm. Brad turns to me. ""What should we do?""

""It's simple. Everyone hold hands until the light flickers. We need to figure out first of all how everyone is leaving the room.""

""But that can't work!"" says a heavyset woman nearby.

""Why not?"" A Brazilian man next to the door.

""This room is huge. What if there's more than one..."" 

This time it's the Brazilian man who leaves the room.

I'm beginning to see how the vanishings are tailored to go against the progress I'm trying to make. And it's very effective. For the next hour, a man or woman is taken every four minutes. Each one either supports me or offers a method of their own. The only people not being taken are the ones who continue to be paranoid about the situation. 

There are 19 other people in the room when I leave.

It's a strange feeling. Like being covered in honey. I feel myself sliding, briefly, then it is over. I am in a different room, with all the people who left before me.

A man in a labcoat steps up to me. ""Congratulations, you're the last.""

""What was this about?"" I am dazed. Large screens loom above me, with views of the room I left and what look like heart monitor readings.

""You and everyone in this room are being promoted to Executive positions in PRI Labs. You were the ones who stayed calm and offered solutions to the problems."" He turns to the crowd. ""You all know by now you don't work for a normal company. The Pandora Research Institute wants to take big control over the future of the world, and we must have only the smartest to do it.""

A fight has broken out onscreen. The man turns to it, and I realize that the graphs on the right side are for brain activity, not just heart rate. He shakes his head. 

""You were the last to leave because we thought your leadership would focus the others. Obviously, we'll need to fire some people as well.""

""What'd you wanna tell me? Is there something dangerous in the future that I have to save or something?""

""Haha, no. I just wanted to help you out with some stuff, that's all. If you do this stuff, you're gonna be really happy later in life.""

""Okay, what is it?""

""Study.""

Younger Me scrunches up his face. I hope this isn't going to be difficult. 

""But... I make all A's.""

""I know. But you still need to study. A lot.""

""But that's no fun! Why should I study if I'm already smart?""

I sigh. I can feel Younger Me's emotions, and I don't like them. I cried too easily when I was that age. I don't want to set him off, or else he might not listen.

""Look, we are smart. Really."" Younger Me looks up. ""But when you go to high school and college, things are different. Being smart helps, but the most important part is the hard work.""

""I don't want hard work. I just want to have fun. Hard work is for adults. Can't it wait?""

""Trust me, you are going to have way more fun if you study. If you work hard first, and have fun after, you're gonna feel a lot better.""

""Is that what you do?""

""No."" I pause. ""I mean, not until it was too late. That's why I'm telling you to do it now. Being smart helps, but it'll be easier for both of us if you start right away. Okay?""

""Fine."" Younger Me always got quiet when people corrected him. No one ever seemed to understand back then. I wasn't mad at the person correcting me, I was mad at myself for doing something wrong. But now I know it's not all my fault. I just want to keep Younger Me happy until he figures it out himself.

""Don't worry. There's still plenty of time after studying to do whatever you want. That's what you need to understand the most.You're going to be fine, and you're going to get into really good schools and have a lot of fun.""

""Okay.""

""And don't get mad at Mom and Dad for making you exercise. You'll feel better once you get used to it.""

""Okay.""

There's really no more advice to give after that. It's the key to everything, barring the unforeseen. To be honest though, I'm not even sure if it will work. There's no studying to do when you're only 11. I wish I could've picked a different time.

I look out the cafe window into the lobby of the museum. ""There's your teacher."" She's standing next to Steven, a ratty little Hispanic kid who I'm still certain was a racist bully. I point at him. ""You know what? He's just jealous of you.""

That perks Younger Me up right away. ""Really?""

""No, but it'll make him mad if you say that.""

Younger Me laughs and goes to join his friends.

As the sun sets low under the Bridge of Al-Kazul, the family settles into its nightly routine. The bath is drawn directly from the falls, and is warmed by the electrogenerator to the perfect degree. Kaien and Starlight mumble and complain, but are obedient. Starlight has just learned to wash behind her ears.

Then they are changed into their nightgowns, and Father reads from the Book of Stories as Mother brushes Starlight's hair. Starlight drifts off, her auburn locks glinting in the light of the incandescent phlogiston crystals. Kaien sits in rapt attention to the tale of the Faerie Brotherhood and their quest to find the Lost Soldier.

The story is finished. ""Ah, Kaien, my little man."" Father bends down to kiss his son's forehead. ""Go to sleep, and let the White Deer guide you to dreams.""

Father and Mother leave the room, shutting the door behind them. They go out to the balcony.

""It is tonight, is it not."" Mother does not ask a question. She knows it is the time. They look out to the factory.

""It must be done."" There is sadness in his eyes, and in his voice. ""The Republic has taken advantage of us for too long. They treat us to their new sciences of steam and electricity, but it is a sham. They have taken too much control.""

""I know all of this, do I not? How many times do I complain? Of not having enough to feed the children?"" She reaches up to his face, and there is a fire in her eyes. ""But it cannot be this.

""It must be done, my dear. We will not be oppressed."" Dieter stands firm, resolute. His muscles stand out in the dying light, and she hates him for leaving.

I've never had to kill a man before. 

I shot him from a distance. I panicked and shot him four times. The gun went warm in my hand, and I cried. I wailed, and I dropped my gun and fell to the floor. I felt sick. It was... beyond terrible.

Another guard crashed into the room. Tony. ""What happened? Why did you kill the Gen 3 subject?""

I can't speak. Can't even stand. Tony lifts me up and carries me out of the med room. ""Hey! I need help!""

""What's going on?""

""He discharged his weapon. I'm not sure why. We need to strap him down, I think he's going into shock.""

They pull me into an emergency stretcher. As they strap me down, my brain starts to clear. ""I... no, I'm fine. It's the Company. It's their fault! Do you realize what they were going to do?""

""Calm down, alright? What are you talking about? Why did you fire your weapon?""

My breath is ragged. I talk slow. I need them to understand. ""The subject I shot... was a Level 2 ESP telepath. PRI Labs... is going to make more of them... use them to enslave people."" I turned my head to talk to both of them. ""I did us a favor.""

The other guard just stared at me. ""He said he was a Level 2 telepath... and you just believed him?""

I stared back. ""Of course I did. He had mental restraints on; he was being given anesthesia. His story was real. Why would he want to be killed otherwise.""

Tony gestured to the other guard. He looked frustrated. ""Check the room.""

It didn't take long. ""It's empty! And there aren't any mental restraints inside, just the shackles! The room is supposed to be lead-lined.""

""What?"" I scream. ""No, he's dead! I killed him!""

""You didn't kill him."" Tony started to push the stretcher down the hall. ""Lewis, put out the call on the radio. Gen 3 Level 2 telepath, possibly psychotic...""

Way back when, the 1950's is when the theory first took hold I believe, people were worried about stuff happening in the Bermuda Triangle. ""Oooh, so spooky,"" yet in the end the public just let it pass. Which they should've too, it was all just exaggerated statistics and unreliable witnesses.

Hmm. I'm beginning to wonder whether there was something to it after all.

So it's the middle of the day, right? I'm driving up to visit a friend of mine who lives in Upstate New York. Classy place, real ivory tower deal. So I'm talking to him on the phone, and I'm driving, and the GPS on my phone tells me to take a detour. Like, for somewhere an hour away. Weird.

So I tell my friend this, and he's like, ""Yeah, GPS will do that around here a lot lately."" He ends up having to tell me the directions himself, but I get there okay. Stay for an hour. Eat pizza. It's when I'm about to leave that things get weird.

I look out the window, and I see a police car. That's fine. But then, it just... leaves. It's not like a complete vanishing act either, it's a sliding disappearance. Like I just watched someone edit it out of a video.

""Hey, man, did you see that?"" He says he didn't. ""C'mere, man, take a look at this."" Someone else has parked on the side of the road. He was going in the opposite direction, and I guess he saw the cop car disappear too. He looks kind of shaken. As I'm explaining to my friend what happened, the man picks up a tree branch from the side of the road, and waves it around in the air trying to figure out what happened. Nothing happens for a while. Then the branch snaps apart in midair.

I've never heard anyone scream so loud in my life.

In the next few days, things were pretty hectic. Eventually people discovered that things could come out of the dome, but not in. At least that meant we could be evacuated. There weren't a lot of people who went missing in the end either. So we counted our blessings.

But then another dome popped up in China. Parts of the new dome chopped up skyscrapers in Beijing, and they just got sucked in. Poor folks never even realized what was going on. Scientists the world over started to investigate, and they found out that somehow, they could use GPS as an early warning system. That was a huge victory, and the missing persons count went way down. Since I work at a major GPS company, my life has been pretty busy.

But no one could solve it. A new dome once a week for seven months and no one knows why. Cities are getting crowded, especially since no one wants to live above ground level anymore. People are starting to panic, and riots are pretty common now.

I've never been the type for conspiracy theories, but if there are any aliens reading this, could you please help us out? We'd really appreciate it. Following this satellite message are some binary files with the research we've done so far. Hope it helps.

I've been in the diner for about ten minutes when a group of kids come in from the snow. Kids my age. This is a small town, but I don't know any of them. Huh. Weird.

They sit down in the booth in front of mine. Barb, the old waitress, gets their orders out quickly. Then they start talking. Arguing. It's quiet arguing though, like they're hiding something. Then one of them pulls out a HUGE wad of cash.

Whoa.

One of the two girls practically screams at the guy to put it away. She's ducking her head around, trying to see if anyone saw. I'm real good about burying my head in my notebook, though, and eventually she calms down. No one else seems to have noticed either, but the diner is pretty busy this evening.

""For Petessakes, Bill, you wanna give us all a heart attack?""

""I'm not having a heart attack."" A different guy. ""Are you having a heart attack Paul?""

""Look guys,"" Bill says, cutting them off. ""You guys may wanna lay low, but not me. I'm proud of it. They could hang me today and I'd die a happy man.""

""You're not afraid of jail at all."" The first girl is seriously ticked by Bill's attitude. The second girl (I think her name started with an M) hasn't said anything the whole time.

""Nope! In fact, I'll admit it to the next person to walk over.""

That gets them all talking again. I feel like that's my cue to step in. I'm not usually this brave, but Bill seems... different. And kinda cute.

I walk over to their booth. It takes them a moment to realize that I'm there, but then they get quiet. I pull up a chair and sit down.

""That's a nice amount of money you got there. Where'd ya get it?""

Bill says nothing.

""You just said you'd tell me.""

""Now you've done it, Bill,"" says the fourth dude. ""Look, he's got a big mouth. Just forget you saw us...""

""We're thieves.""

That's when the M girl speaks up. ""Ugh, I am so tired of hanging out with this idiot. I'm calling a cab. You coming, Evie?""

""Hey, come on. I wanna tell someone the story, that's all!""

Obviously Bill is the class clown of this group. I play along though, just in case I get the real story. ""Okay, what did you steal?""

Evie gets up to leave with Paul and the second dude. ""Trust me girl, he is not worth having a crush on. He's a real village idiot where we come from."" She looks around the diner. ""Not that folks around here would be able to tell.""

I don't like her anymore. Bill brushes it off almost instantly, and scoots up closer to my chair. ""Okay, so get ready for this. You know that huge diamond robbery up in Vegas last week?""

""Ah. You're saying you did it?""

""My dad did. But I helped!"" He's got this goofy looking grin on, like I'm supposed to like him because his dad's a criminal. I laugh.

""Hey, this guy. Over here."" I snap my fingers at the fourth kid, who's the only one that didn't leave the diner. He looks up at me as though he has a migraine. ""Where'd he get the fat stacks?""

He puts his head in his hands. ""He just told you.""

""Dude, I'm serious.""

""Ah, ye of little faith."" Bill pulls himself out of the booth and shakes my hand. ""Pleasure to be with a pretty girl, but we've gotta run. Come on Larry."" Larry gets up too.

Bill smiles at me for a second, then snaps his fingers. ""Whoops, I almost forgot."" He hands me a small box. It's my... it's my phone. ""Wouldn't want you to forget that. And here's your driver's licence, credit card, debit card, lipstick, chapstick, scrunchie, wristwatch, left earring, aaand... right shoelace. Have a nice night!""

Bill sprints toward the door, with Larry behind him cursing up a blue streak. I'm amazed, and so are a few of the other customers. Barb steps out of the kitchen, fuming. ""None of those brats paid for their meal! I got half a mind to...""

I feel a bump in my pocket. I don't have to look to know that its cash, and a lot of it. ""Um... I think they left the money here on the table. I'll bring it over.""

*Whoosh*

""Whoa. Where am I?""

I'm standing in front of enormous slabs of information. I instinctively know what they are. Programs. What I don't know is ...why? How does this work?

I decide to read the documentation. I don't even have to click on it, it all becomes photographic in my memory. Wow. What an interesting system. Everything is here, from PrimalInstinctProtocol.exe to HighSchool.bak. So many possibilities... 

*Death.ncf is not a deletable file.*

Drat. Ok, let's try something else. I know enough about computers to make this worthwhile for me. Um... ""Oh! I know!"" I enter CollegeLevelStudying.exe. My entire field of vision is consumed by a list of settings. I read each one. ""Okay, let's turn up this one... That can stay... Ooh! More memory!""

Done with that. Next I turn to Relationship_Wife.exe. I'm not married, but it doesn't hurt to be prepared. I definitely know who I want to marry, though. I use the directory file to look up her own data, which takes a while. Sasha is a fairly common name.  I know it's her when her current picture comes onscreen. ""Ah, the love of my life. Say goodbye, Jeffrey."" I'm not too mean, though. I set him up with a single girl living at Kappa  Phi sorority across campus. I hope it works out.

Being a system administrator has its perks, I gotta say. That's enough for now. I don't want to change too much at a time, that way I'll know if I make a mistake. Before I leave though, I see a little flashing notice in the corner.

*Driver Update Available - Ver. 18491.2.5*

This just keeps getting better. I'm 294 versions behind. I can't even comprehend what that would mean! I click it right away.

*Warning: Any unsaved sessions may be lost. Would you like to continue?*

Wait, shoot!

I catch myself just before I trip on my roommate's shoes. Phew. That was close. Last thing I need is to spill water on this keyboard. It's old, but I definitely don't want to buy a new one.

I look up. I'm sitting in 27B. I'm not sure what's going on, but I stay quiet. Maybe it's just some kind of joke? I pretend I'm still asleep. When I open my eyes again, he's on Skype. Now I'm curious. The stewardess specifically told me the WiFi didn't support video. His headphones are very loud, so I keep my eyes closed and focus on just listening.

*""I'll have Kappa send another round of drinks through the cabin. She'll have to administer the drug that way.""*

""I believe that liquids may dilute compound 4C."" 

*""Yes, but this can be counteracted by increasing the sodium content of the next meal. I've just sent word to Kappa. She will make the rounds in five minutes.""*

""Thank you, Alpha. Zeta out.""

I can't help but shift in my chair a bit. This is disturbing. The only option I can think of is that my seatmate is a bio-terrorist. He turns to me, and I realize I've had my eyes open for the last twenty seconds. I say nothing. Need to act natural. I'm certain I am sweating bullets as I reach under my chair for my backpack. He turns back to his laptop and starts playing a game of chess.

I'm only a page into the book I took out when I hear the announcement of the drink cart. Now I'm panicking. My eyes keep a focused watch on the cart as it comes closer. I notice that no one seems to be drinking any alcoholic beverages. The flight attendant comes to my row.

""What will you be having, sir?"" I look at her nametag. Marigold. She doesn't look like a terrorist, but neither does Mr. Zeta. I decide to risk an upset in their plans, for the sake of my health.

""I'm not feeling thirsty."" It may be the most baldfaced lie I have ever spoken, I am parched beyond any previous experience. It's strange that I've only just noticed. But to my surprise, she shrugs it off and moves to the next row. I am surprised, but grateful. I turn back to my book as Marigold hands Mr. Zeta his-

I NEED TO THROW UP.

It takes every scrap of willpower I have to hold it in until I fish out the air sickness bag. Everyone is staring. Marigold calmly pulls out some type of air freshener and releases a brief puff. I would be scared, but I'm too exhausted to feel emotion.

""First time flying, dear?"" Her voice has an odd lilt to it. Something Southern, like Tennessee. She takes my bag and hands it to the other attendant, who goes to throw it out.

I shake my head. ""No. I never get sick on flights.""

""Sure you don't want a drink? Ginger ale is the best cure for motion sickness.""

I whimper my agreement and lay my head on my tray table. He notices my dirty expression towards him. His eyebrows furrow in response. He says nothing.

""Pick your head up, dear."" She lays my drink down with a napkin. ""I hope you feel better. Use the call button if you need another bag."" As she moves to the next row, I am certain I can catch her winking at Mr. Z.

I level my gaze at him. He stares back. Expressionless.

""What did you do to me?""

He blinks, then turns back to his laptop. ""Drink your ginger ale. You'll be fine."" His chess game reopens as he remarks dryly, ""And don't speak to the flight attendants, please. I don't wish to be fired.""

A terrible day, to be certain. Terribly cold, and terribly windy. The snow made the gun freeze in Watson's hand, and it made him nervous. He did not carry often, not since the war.

""I did not ask you to kill Sherlock Holmes.""

""No. You did not.""

""This was not what we agreed.""

""No.""

""You will go to the police, and confess your crime.""

Moriarty's hat gathered snow around its brim. He did not shiver. Watson did. 

""I most certainly will not. You assured me that if I killed your wife, I would not be arrested, and I would not be pursued by that blasted detective. Your wife is dead, and I am not being pursued. I will not go to jail.""

The woman standing near the old wooden barn stood on, and gasped slightly. She was ignored.

""My wife cheated on me."" Watson licked his lips. They were dry. ""She deserved to die. Sherlock Holmes did not. He was doing his job.""

""He is dead. I will not go to the police.""

Watson stood tall, determined. He held up his gun. ""I will make you.""

Moriarty raised his own. ""You will not.""

""Alright. This is test number Fourteen-Dash-A-One. Notes: First human subject. Primary energy stimulus increased seventeen percent. Secondary energy stimulus increased two-hundred-four percent. Subject is grounded and wearing one hundred percent nylon clothing and charge resounding protective gear.""

I put down the recording device. John types in the final instructions as I slip on the electrical contacts. ""You're braver than I am, man. You okay?""

""Yeah, I'll be fine. I wonder where I'll end up.""

""As long as you come back in one piece, I don't care. Alright, you're ready. On the count of three. One!""

My mind goes fuzzy. I don't remember two or three. For a moment, I feel myself going into cardiac arrest, and I panic. But then the secondary shock radiates through my body, and it is over. I am free.

I draw back my arm. I can only move because of the protective gear, it's made of the substances that will continue holding my atomic structure together as long as the secondary is maintained. My eyes are closed, I am savoring the feeling. Like swimming, except you are the force of gravity around you. There is no sound. At last I open my eyes.  

I see everything. Every shred of radiation, clouds of atoms teeming with the signals from TV and radio. I didn't imagine this was possible. As everything stands still, I perceive colors I know are impossible to look at in the reality. They are bright, vibrant. A cataclysm in glorious motion, a still picture before me. I lose sense of time just from looking.

Down on the floor, there are pawprints laid squarely into the wood. The rat that was test subject nine. We noticed them after he came back in phase. I am curious now, I reach down to touch the floor on my own. Every subatomic particle moves before me. I am able to press down into the cedar as though it were putty. None of the changes stick though, my hand simply flows through. I'm still not sure how the rat was able to do that.

Content that the experiment was a success, I stand up and take out the modified stopwatch that should bring me back in phase.

I drop it.

Suddenly everything comes to life. The sound comes flowing back into my ears, all ambient, but louder than ever before. John is standing next to me, holding the broken timepiece. I can't hear him. I can hear everything.

""Did something happen? Are you okay? How did this break?""

""I... I dropped it. I'm sorry.""

I look around. The colors are gone, everything is ordinary. The computer is gone, and so is most of the primary system. ""Did you put the system away? How long was I out?""

""I threw it away, man. What was left of it. I think it went with you somehow... It's gone, man. But I think we can make a new one."" He grins. ""So how was it?""

""Beautiful.""

I feel like people have been watching me all week. I guess this whole situation has put me on edge. But me and Sandra ultimately decided I wasn't going to have them study me. It's a load off my mind.

""...I haven't started yet.""

""We all heard you."" *Paul looks... mad. Why is he mad?* ""I'm mad because you're saying the numbers I've calculated these last two weeks are... worthless, apparently? What do you mean, 'It's not going to save us money?'""

""Uh... I didn't say that."" *I thought it though. AW SHOOT HE'S READING MY MIND WHAT DO I DO? WHAT DO I DO?*

I try playing it off, but Paul won't have it. ""If you didn't think there were any... wait, what? Reading your mind?""

Peggy looks at me sideways. ""He's not moving his mouth. Did you learn ventriloquism or something, Jeremy?""

*No.* ""Uh... yes?""

Frank snickers. ""Well, which is it? Yes or no?""

I'm having a small panic attack. ""Listen, can I be excused for one moment?"" *I gotta get outta here.*

""Not until you give us your report."" Shoot, now he's mad. Before I have the chance to do anything, though, the secretary comes on over the intercom. ""Henry, call for you on line 2. It's the regional manager. It sounds important.

*OH THANK GOODNESS I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY TO HAVE SECRETARIES EXIST*

""Um... thank you? Is the meeting that bad? What's going on in there?""

I realize two things before I faint from embarrassment. One is that telepathy works over the phone. The other is that I am definitely fired.

I sign the last page of the contract with PRI Labs. My hand is cramping a bit. ""Thank you so much for this Dr. Mikelson. I just hope you can make me normal again.""

He chuckles. ""Well, science isn't content with the way things were before. The Pandora-Romero Institute wants to find a new normal. Make the world a better place.""

""Well, in my experience, the world will be a better place when I can keep my thoughts to myself. I still don't know what happened.""

""May I be candid with you?""

""What? Um. Sure.""

""When I gave you my card last week, it was laced with a contact drug. It didn't affect me, but it was meant to increase the amplitude of your brain waves. And it would seem we're already on the right track to success! Isn't that wonderful?""

I look at the contract again. It's already signed. Unbreakable for at least a year. *...I hate you with every fiber of my being.*

""Don't think so negatively."" He leans back in his chair. ""Now while I'm here, tell me more about this incident with the phone.""

*Just take me home. I don't want to talk about this here.*

I can't send thoughts to people. I wish I could. I can only read other people, which makes talking feel like a real hassle. ""Come on. I'm no different from the guy you met a year ago. I don't even try to""

**TAKE. ME. HOME.**

I take her home.

&amp;nbsp; 

I've never been able to hold down a girlfriend. Why is this so hard? I have to let them know about me, about what I can do. I can read people's minds! Who wouldn't want that for themselves?

I feel like I'm going insane. Losing my own mind. Heh. How quaint.

So I pushed the button. No thought to the consequences, and really what consequences were there? Just a smaller, quieter world, where people's sins were weeded out and we could finally focus on the important things. Like free energy. And chess tournaments.

The progress took its time, radiating outwards from the satellite/receiver feedback loop. Identification came first, marked up the targets with a frequency of energy the death ray would target later. It took 48 hours for it to finish its records on America alone. In total, the world had 15 days worth of jerks.

The deaths were... phenomenally catastrophic. In hindsight, there were certain types of people who I should have set on a time delay. Important people, like  power plant workers and airplane pilots. Come to think of it, I should have exempted anyone who was in a vehicle at the time. The ray was accurate, but it heated objects to a level over 400 Kelvin. It was a major oversight. Those who weren't targeted sometimes ended up burned to death anyway. All major airlines suddenly ceased to exist.

People wondered; I stayed quiet. There were no more atheists, that much was clear, but those who remained were angry at whatever gods they could think of. At least until they realized there were very few people willing to say anything nice at the funerals. There were a lot of funerals. Out near NYC, you could hear the crying and screaming up to five miles away. But outside the candlelight vigils, people were secretly... happy. It helped that there were a lot of terrorists and dictators missing from third world countries. North Koreans didn't even bother mourning for Kim Jong Un.

So yeah, no more atheists. There was this new denomination that started in Vermont; they said God had pulled some kind of ""reverse rapture,"" gotten rid of people not willing to follow the Golden Rule. When you knew the victims, this made a lot of sense. But really, people were willing to believe anything. The Westboro Baptist Church got a lot of press the first week; more people stayed alive in that church than I thought possible. There was a Buddhist/Wicca cult that lodged itself in Nevada and New Mexico. Most people just stuck to the religion they already knew.

Everyone was still pretty shaken up about a month after the Great Purge. But then something happened. Apparently an old married couple started arguing New Religion at a Survivors' Banquet. Poof. Man sunk to the floor, nothing but ashes. She says he was about to hit her, maybe even throw a punch. Everyone believed her, but they were pretty shocked. 

""Well, that just proves I was right!"" The woman exclaimed. Poof. She was gone too.

I'm not sure why, but after exactly 28 days (down to the microsecond), my machine started tagging people again. There was a higher standard now, people who were more decent than the last but still flawed one way or another. But there were a thousand times less people to catalog now. At first, it was five people per day. Then up to fourteen every twelve hours. Society wasn't holding itself down anymore, which just made things worse, sped up the process. One guy decided he wanted to go out with a different bang, wore a suicide bomb to a nuclear waste storage area. Fortunately the death ray tagged and bagged him just as he was putting it on. Other suicide bombers got to be a bit more public though.

I'm writing this from the bunker. I never could turn it back off, because the power grid went down and I can't communicate with the machine. If someone finds this, I want them to know what happened. Why they're probably the only person left on the face of the earth.

Because they're not an asshole.

*Poof*

Today's the day! First day on the job at PRI. Boy, I feel pleasant! It's pretty warm for fall. Traffic's free and clear too. Things are working out for me!

I walk in, nine on the dot. Swipe the card I got in the mail. Apparently I'm going to have to sign up for a permanent card today, but that can wait. I'm going to set up my cubicle first.

Looks like some coworkers dropped by to watch me set up. ""Hi!""

""Hey. You the new guy?"" He's tall. Wears a turban. I need to remember to ask my boss, Dr. Mikelson about the dress code.

""Yep, that's me.""

""Cool."" She's cute. Really frizzy hair. She seems kinda sad, though. And maybe... hmm. Can't place it. I wonder what her name is.

""My name's Randy. What's yours?""

""My name's Marcus."" He has to point way down at the girl. ""This is Pam. She's new too. I'm supposed to show you around a bit.""

""Oh. I already got a tour before the interview.""
 
""Eh. This is different. He didn't show you this because we weren't done yet. Come with us.""

There's two other newbies. Both guys. I can tell Barry is into Pam, but she seems so bored. I wonder how she got the job. Ed is just loud. We get in the elevator, and Marcus uses his card to take us down to the basement floor. It's colder down here, but the lights are brighter too. He takes us into a control room, where we can see into the main lab

""Here it is. You're looking at the crown jewel of PRI.""

I look. It's some sort of magnetic containment field. Huge thing, with silver rods poking inwards along a cubic grid. Each rod is about the size of an oil barrel. You can hear the wires humming. Ed's the first to ask, ""What's it for?""

""It's a new type of generator. Dr. Mikelson named it after Pandora's Box. It's not very stable yet, but he says it's definitely renewable. You four are all going to be interning under this research team. You'll learn more next week.""

Pam seems a bit more interested now. The lighting makes her stand out in here; it's much brighter in the lab than the control room. I thought she was a brunette, but I suppose not. ""In any case,"" Marcus continues, ""Right now you need to get your permanent ID badges, then fill out some forms for payroll. Let's go on back.""

""Can we stay? Just me and Randy?""

I have to step back a bit. But her voice sounds different. It attracts me, makes me feel... ready for something. I'm surprised when Marcus nods his approval. Pan makes him feel good. I don't want him to feel good. But I want to stay with Pan. I want to stay with Pan for a long time.

Barry is quiet. Ed is too, but he scrunches up his face like he doesn't understand what's going on. They all leave.

Pandora turns to me. Hair red, like fire. Beautiful.

""Help me turn it off. The box must be freed.""

We go to work. It takes an hour. There is a lot of security. I feel good. The system turns off.

Then I feel sick.

Pam is looking up at the ceiling. She can see past it, I can tell. Past all of it. Superhuman vision. I hate her with every fiber of my being. Her hair is on fire, moved by a breeze that isn't there. She sighs. ""I always hate to reopen that thing. I can't have that man turn the system back on."" She smiles at me; I hate it. ""Still, that was fun. We should get coffee sometime.""

On the way home someone mugs me at the gas station.

What a crappy day.

She ran. The rain turned concrete into warm, wet, solid sand. She hated it. Wished she could be in Chicago, drinking green tea at the Starbucks. She'd missed an appointment, a spa day with her new friend from the B&amp;N. She ran.

Too hard to think. The alarms were blaring. Had been ever since she crossed the White House steps to the outside. Every inch of D.C. was hooked up to the emergency system. They hadn't told her it would be this hard. To run, to think. Too hard to think.

Keep going. Don't listen to the alarm. Listen to the concrete, the wet, solid sand. Run. Run. Keep going.

The phone rang. Not hers. The new one. The one the team gave her. So mad now, filled with rage. She wasn't cut out for this. She knows that now, knows it was a huge mistake and if only she had stayed... Rage is good. Keep running. She'll reach the meeting place, and wring their throats. All of them. How dare they make her this monster, this common thief. It isn't worth it. Never was.

She wasn't looking. Stupid. Tripped over a light-post. Her ankle might be twisted. The phone rang.

""What do you want from me?"" Hair wet. May never be dry again. Stupid.

""You have to meet us at the place with the boat. They're closing down the roads. Do you remember where it is?""

""I... I'm not going.""

""We have your tracker on the feed. You're actually closer than our first meeting place. You're just gonna have to stick to the shadows, like we taught you.""

""I'm not going."" Her voice warm now, growing hotter. She'll wring their necks. All of them. ""I'm turning around, and I'm going back.""

""You can't do that.""

""Sure I can."" She smiled for the first time in a week. Rage is good.

""You know what's at stake here.""

""Money. Gold and jewels and a 63 inch TV and... and whatever dumb stuff you were talking about. I don't care. I'm turning around and I'm going back.""

She can sense the anger on the line. Rage is good. Doesn't matter now. Headlights coming up the road. They'll see her and stop, she's sure of it.

""What are you doing? This isn't right. You've got a team depending on you. That was the first thing we told you when...""

""It's not what you thought it was.""

Another voice on the phone. Active, harsh. The leader. ""Tell her to get her butt in gear.""

""She's not listening! And she's still half a mile away! We need to go.""

""I'll find you, you know."" Dead silence, but for the rain on the road and the grass and the concrete. She gets to her feet. Need to flag down the cars. ""Not the agencies. Not any government in the world. ME. You'll wish you'd never been born."" Rage is good.

The leader took the phone. ""Honey, I ain't got time for this. Just get to the boat.""

Pain. The swelling came fast. No more rage. Just sadness. She hung up the phone. The cars are coming into view.

She takes a grenade from her bag. Some old war memorial from the room. They won't know the difference. Pin slides out easy. Probably not even real. She steps into the road as the SWAT team steps out of their cars.

Gathering herself. Voice has to be loud. ""I want to make a deal!""

On New Year's Eve, more than twenty of us gathered to sing Hymns of Praise and Thanksgiving, to bless each other with our testimonies of the Lord's presence in our lives. At the beginning of a new year, we accepted a charge to commit ourselves to the following:  
1: COMMIT YOURSELF TO FORGET YOUR FAILURES  
When we keep reminding ourselves of the things in our past; we do not allow for God to work in our lives, in the present and future. We continue to put ourselves down....&gt; low self worth and esteem...  
""Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past. See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland.” Isaiah 43:18-19  
2: COMMIT YOURSELF TO GIVE UP YOUR GRUDGES
A grudge is a persistent feeling of ill will or resentment resulting from a past insult or injury. ""she held a grudge against her friend""
synonyms: grievance, resentment, bitterness, rancor, pique, umbrage, dissatisfaction, disgruntlement, bad feelings, hard feelings, ill feelings, ill will, animosity, antipathy, antagonism, enmity, animus  
""'Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against anyone among your people, but love your neighbor as yourself. I am the LORD.” Leviticus 19:18  
Love yourself.... some of us need to learn how to do this first...  
3: COMMIT YOURSELF TO RESTORE YOUR RELATIONSHIPS  
There might be somebody this year or in the past that you have broken a relationship with... there are things that separate us....things like place, time and experience...but if you know you can restore a broken relationship....then commit yourself to do so this year....   
Restoration of friendships and relationships is the essence of the Gospel... Jesus came to restore our broken relationship with Him...and so we should do the same...  
Isaiah 1:18 Come now, let us reason together, says the LORD: though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.  
1 Peter 4:8, ESV Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins.  
4: COMMIT YOURSELF TO TURN YOUR BACK ON YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS.  
“Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord” Acts 3:19  
Colossians 3  
12 Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience.  
13 Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.
14 And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.  
15 Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful.  
16 Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts.  
17 And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.",Christianity,"My pastor gave this worship thought on New Year's Eve.

The return home was long and uncomfortable. Although the snow was freshly plowed and the road freshly salted, Mrs. Steele's SUV rattled and slipped along the inclines. It was slow going, made all the more sluggish by traffic and her own nervous driving habits. She would stand at stoplights for minutes at a time, fearing some imaginary eighteen-wheeler might come out of the midnight haze and t-bone her and her passengers into oblivion. She pressed on.

Patrick was uncomfortable. The heater was set to high and his breath felt constricted. Mrs. Steele's son, Jonathan, slept soundly in the seat across from him, but Patrick had a myriad of thoughts racing through his brain, thoughts too pressing to wait for morning.

He missed his mother. Part of his anxiousness was due to survivor's guilt; it was the first time either of them had been in an accident, and he was shocked to see the extent of her injuries when he had come out needing only a few stitches on his forehead and arms. He had cried for a while, until a kind nurse brought him a cup of hot cocoa and told him that his neighbor Mrs. Steele was on his way to pick him up from the emergency room.

This was his second point of worry. His mother's car was ruined, and his father's car was buried under a snowdrift by his office. Fortunately (or unfortunately, as the case may have been) Mrs. Steele and her son had been more than willing to make the drive out and return Patrick to his house.

He'd never been with another family this late at night. Earlier in his life, there had been doctors, professors, various biologists and theoretical physicists, but he had been too young to remember. He only knew that somehow, his parents had kept those scientists from taking him and studying him for the rest of his life. They had told him never to reveal the change to others, to keep it hidden.

Now change was unavoidable.

Five minutes to midnight. Now four. The clock in the car was wrong, he knew the time just as well as he knew his own names. He snuck a glance at Jonathan. More worry. They were friends, but not close. His relationship with his friends in the neighborhood was naturally strained; he was home-schooled and only came out every other day, if at all. 

He waited. And midnight came. The shift was rapid, but in the dark he managed not to catch Mrs. Steele's attention. The changes started small, at the base of his feet, and worked their way upward. She didn't feel all that uncomfortable, in fact, she would normally have slept through the entire process. Her clothes were less than ideal, but she knew nothing could be done about that. Aside from shifting her weight in the car seat, she stayed still.

Then the car went over a bump in the road. This, in tandem with her shifting facial features, caused her stitches to tear. She gasped involuntarily. Jonathan stirred but didn't wake.

""It's alright, Patrick. We're on your street now."" Mrs. Steele tightened her grip on the steering wheel. ""Just a little more. It's a good thing this road is flat.""

Patricia said nothing. She wished Mrs. Steele wasn't so talkative; Jonathan had stirred again, and she was quickly losing hope that she could rush inside her house without her new body being seen.

Without warning, Mrs. Steele stopped the car and honked on the horn, trying to gain the attention of Patricia's father. Patricia's heart sank. As Jonathan finally lifted himself from sleep, she scrambled for the door handle. It lifted, but the door wouldn't budge.

""It's the child lock, dear."" Mrs. Steele was already out of the car. ""Hold on, I'll get it.""

She opened the door, then screamed. It was loud, and very unwelcome; Jonathan was wide awake now, and so were most of the neighbors. Lights flickered on randomly at houses along the road, and windows were being opened, knocking old snow and icicles off their sills.

""Mama? What's wrong?"" Jonathan's eyes darted around wildly, and decided to settle on Patricia's long, brown hair. ""Where's Patrick?""

Patricia turned. Her face was obscured by her bangs and the small stream of blood running down her forehead. But whereas Mrs. Steele had seen a small, seven year old girl wearing boy's clothes and a red halo of broken thread and dried blood, young Jonathan recognized his friend instantly.

""*Patrick's a girl?*""

""Johnny-""

""Patrick's a GIRL!"" Jonathan whooped with laughter. ""Patrick's a girl, Mama!""

""Johnny, you have to be quiet!"" Patricia stamped her foot. She tried to climb back into the car, but Jonathan leapt up into the front of the car.

""No, you can't touch me!"" He was still laughing. ""Now you have cooties!""

""Johnny, stop it!"" Patricia jumped and stomped her feet until she slipped on black ice. Now the stitches in her left arm had ripped under her coat. She picked herself up from the ground and started to cry as her father finally came out of the house.

""Emma?"" Mrs. Steele turned, pale and wide-eyed. ""I am so sorry about this. It was completely out of my hands-"" Another light flicked on, this time at the house across from them, and he stopped to take in the entire scene. ""What on earth is going on?""

Jonathan clambered into the driver's seat of the car and slid down. ""Mr. Harrison, Patrick's a girl now! Haha!""

Before either parent could stop them, Patricia tackled Jonathan into the snow and started beating him ferociously. ""Be quiet! It's supposed to be a secret!""

""Ow! Hey! Cooties! Get offa me!""

""YOU! CAN'T! TELL!""

Mr. Harrison pulled his daughter away, as she screamed all the while. Mrs. Steele was still shell-shocked, beyond hope of any active response.

""You can't tell me what to do!"" Jonathan lifted himself up. ""I'm gonna tell all the kids!""

""NO!""

""Hey, guys! Guess what? Patrick's a girl now!"" He ran off, down the street and into the night as more lights turned on and more windows were opened and more and more children heard the strangely hilarious news. ""Patrick's a girl!""

""Patricia, you need to go inside, okay? Now."" She struggled, still wanting to find Johnny and punch him into submission, but Mr. Harrison held firm until she gave up and ran into the house crying. Then he turned to Emma.

""What-""

""In the morning."" His voice was hot and demanding. ""I need you to go and collect your son.""

""But your-""

""I promise you, we will sort this out in the morning. I need to go talk to my daughter.""

""Your *daughter-*""

""*Good night,* Emma."" He walked inside, closing the garage door behind him.

Mrs. Steele never moved.

Mr. Harrison found Patricia lying on her bed, still in her coat and boots, sobbing uncontrollably. He turned on the light, illuminating the blue-and-pink striped walls, and walked to her bedside.

""Let's get you out of those wet clothes, okay?""

""No.""

""Sweetie-""

""Now Johnny's gonna tell everybody! I told him not to tell, but he didn't listen!"" Abruptly, she threw her pillow at the lamp on her bedside. It tipped and fell.

Her father sat down on the bed, and laid a hand on Patricia's shoulder. She squirmed and shook until he removed it. Mr. Harrison clasped his hands together, searching for the right words.

""I want Mommy.""

""I know, honey."" He paused. ""I know.""

She wept herself to sleep. When her breathing evened, her father changed her into her favorite pink pajamas, and laid her down under the covers. Then he turned off the light and went to sleep alone in his own bed.
***
Below, on the street, Mrs. Steele still hadn't moved, save for hugging herself and shivering in the stiff wind. Jonathan had free reign over the neighborhood until he tired himself out, voice hoarse from shouting. He went back to his mother.

""Mama, I'm tired now. Can we go home?""

She roused herself from her stupor, and they walked home. She left her SUV by the curb of the Harrison's house, still too shaken to drive. As she fumbled with the key to the front door, Jonathan giggled sleepily.

""*Patrick's a girl.*""
