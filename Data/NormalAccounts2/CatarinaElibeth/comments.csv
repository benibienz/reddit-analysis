3,"It really depends on the person. But definitely be honest and up front. Don't use the word, ""experiment,"" because that is very scary. Tell them exactly what you just typed. That will give them a chance to know exactly what they are getting into, and to prepare themselves. 

You are a great person for taking the time to actually think about this though. I think 85% of this sub has a heart-breaking experimenting girl story.",2016-10-10 12:50:59+00:00,d8lsa99,1.0,t3_56qvqy,19446.0,actuallesbians

5,"As the person who has been in her shoes. I just got out of a two year relationship with my former straight best friend. Same thing happened. She knew about my feelings, then started to develop her own. 2 years later, she realized those feelings were gone, and she was, in fact, straight. She strung me along for months before she finally told me. Then strung me along even longer when she said she still romantically liked me, just not sexually. I think you need to figure out your feelings first. Completely. Really think about how you feel about women, not just her. ",2016-10-10 10:13:23+00:00,d8lp2ny,1.0,t3_56jpna,123933.0,actuallesbians

8,"Be confident, and flirt casually as if she is into you. Odds are, if she is into you, she'll be having the same thoughts. As someone that has had more straight girls come onto me than non-straight girls, it's easier to be the more open person with flirting, and see how she will take it. One of you has to take that step.
