This is my 6th year living here, and I'm actually only from an hour north from birth. I've been wanting to move to Australia for as long as I can remember, but that will take a great deal of saving and planning and documentation. In the meantime, I'm not sure I want to stay in Austin. I went through a shitty breakup with a girl (yes, she's such a child, I refuse to call her woman), all of my true friends now live outside of the state for graduate school, I spend all day every day alone, and I want to be somewhere better suited for the future I want for myself. 

Other than looking for an affordable place for a young 20 something, there are two huge things I am looking for: diverse community with a chance for me to meet people like me (not just lesbian hook ups, but genuine friendships) and career opportunities for writers.

We had a talk, and decided to stay together. Then I just couldn't handle how much of a terrible person she actually is, so I broke up with her in August. She told me she didn't know if she wanted to be in a relationship right now, and that she wanted to be friends, and all this other stuff that I now realize is bullshit. I have been suspecting that she is seeing someone, and my suspicions were confirmed a couple of hours ago. I sent her a lengthy text about how I'm coming on Wednesday to pick up the last of my things (that I gave her a list of), and I told her to give me a list of what she wanted back. Then I went on to talk about how I don't want to be friends with someone that broke my heart and lied to me, and replaced me so quickly and didn't actually care about me. If anyone is interested, I'll post the message in a comment.

I'm livid. If she even tries to be a bitch in any way, I've already prepared a response along the lines of, ""I hate to show you the kind of person you've turned me into, but I want you to know I am not above black mailing."" She kept our entire 2 year relationship a secret from her family, and I'm not afraid to change that if she decides to do anything like keep my stuff or refuse to respond to me. I already told her that this will be the last time she will see me. I just want my stuff back, and for her to know how I feel now. And I hope that guy gets her pregnant, and her mom finds out, and disowns her.

I have already deleted her on social media, and I'm prepared to cut her out completely. I just really want my things back, or else they will just represent a hold she has on me. She has a book of mine that was a gift from someone, and other things I want back. Once I have those, I'll delete her number, and be done. I don't genuinely want to follow through on any blackmail, but I need her out of my life for good. I'm hurting, and there's no coming back for us. 

I'm not seeking someone to talk me out of what I'm doing, because it's already done. I'm just needing friendly support, since I have no more friends within the state of Texas.

Okay, I'm done. 

TL;DR. My ex is with some guy after we just broke up, and I sent a long, somewhat hateful text message that ruins any chance for even a friendship in the future. And I hate her.

Edit: I realize my anger is coming across quite strongly, but I'm more venting than sharing my actual plans. As much as I wish I was one of those people that could get even with someone, I'm not. So my solution was to just go on a rant to get it all out since she was my go to person to vent to.",actuallesbians,"I did something kinda bad, and I'm not done...",https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/56r6gu/i_did_something_kinda_bad_and_im_not_done/

A little while later, we had sex and then got together. We've been dating ever since. We've been living together the past year, although when our lease ends in a month her parents are making her get a one bedroom for her and her sister. We've shared so many things. We're each other's best friend.

The past couple months or so, things have been different. I haven't been as open or happy with her, and she's been giving off this vibe I could never explain. Last night, after getting her drunk, I finally got her to talk to me. She said she likes me, wants to be with me, like hanging out, likes holding me, likes sleeping in the same bed, and kissing. But she's not sexually attracted to girls. Myself included. It turned into a lot of crying and yelling and eventually I had to step outside to calm down. I came back and she was asleep. I laid down opposite of her so my head wasn't next to her. I don't know what to do. She compared it to being asexual, but she's not asexual. She just wants to have sex with guys. But she says she wants us to be girlfriends. All I can see is disaster ahead no matter what. But I don't know what to do, and she's mad at me for feeling insecure about us now. She likes me. I like her. She said she likes me as more than a friend. But is that possible without being attracted to someone in that way? 

I feel like the rug has been pulled out from under me, and it's still possible for it to be thrown on top of me, so I can be trampled on. We've been together for 2 years this August. Was it all a lie?  Am I wrong to feel a little used? Or like she will just find a guy and be done with me like that? She got so mad at me when I told her how I feel, cause it hurt her feelings.
