38,"tl;dr: my standard final build would look like **dt, warrior taibi, BoV, frostbound, Bulwark, spirit robe** becoming **runeforged, ninja taibi, mantle, frostbound, bulwark, spirit robe** late game.

i build bell:

* dt, 

* warrior tabi, 

* BoV/witchblade/nemean/urchin depending on mu, 

* genji's/pestilence/bulwark depending on mu, 

* frostbound, 

* mantle/spirit.  

* Replace dt w/ runeforged/qins/mantle/brawlers/winged blade.  

* ninja taibi can replace warriors late.  mantle replaces BoV

bov standard, wb vs an aa solo + more relevant aa gods, nemean vs just solo aa. urchin vs magic solo, phys jg or if you have already won lane hard by time boots are done and will snowball stacks.  runic shield vs chronos/freya solo into phys def next (usually hide of nem).  Ancile vs magic solo+ao.

Genjis ideally if no bov for cdr, pest vs enough healing (ravana + lifesteal on the adc, prob not. any 1 of e.g chaac+ arachne+ ra+ freya+ sylvanas and ls on the adc yes).  bulwark otherwise.

you can build fb before magic def if you arent scared of mid or went urchin.  in fact w/ urchin if your team doesnt need wb/pest passives build only hybrid def (urchin, spirit, mantle).

spirit if you are full tank w/ mantle last item or went bov, mantle if finishing w/ dmg item.

runeforged w/ team slows, qins for pure dmg, brawlers vs heavy healing, winged vs slows.

40,"polynomicon doesn't make sense.  his niche is doing ability dmg from beyond aa range and he doesn't even have cc to confirm his poly proc.  Plus w/ his range he should not be getting poked so why lifesteal (or the health from sash)?

obs shard is typically mandatory on mages.  spear and sash is pretty greedy.  as a poke mage w/ only 1 reliable dmging ability and a long cd escape you want cdr i think.

i would build something like doom orb, pen boots, chronos pendant, obs shard, book, rod.  

with his passive there is merit to swapping shard for spear of deso late for the total 50 flat pen and just focus on backliners.  Maybe his passive and role as backline harasser makes obs shard skippable and you just build pen helm early and swap for spear late.  

also gem of iso could be strong w/ his 1 to give him more utility w/ a long range slow on multiple targets. (drop doom orb, adjust build order)

Effect of talents: + 180 (chaos reigns) + 212 (Psychokinesis) - 10% overall (quick mind or applied force).  +878 (deadly charge) + 1,096 (counter strike)

**Kerrigan** L20 untalented combo (W-E, Q either open or closing combo): 1,292 in ability dmg.  Each AA = +263 dmg

Effect of talents: + 137 (sharpened blades) +79 dmg/sec (psionic pulse 5s)  +197 per (double strike) AA.  +163 dmg/sec (maelstrom 7s)

**Thrall** untalented combo (W, E, finish with Q): 727 ability dmg + 1084 AA dmg from windfury.  Each additional AA = +361 dmg

Effect of talents: FT autos +144.5 per auto.  One tempest fury hit (831 dmg instead of 361, net 470 dmg).  5x activations of giant killer (7.5% of health) +1.5% per non E aa.  +600 (sunder)

As one can see Alarak has the highest potential ability dmg burst in the shortest amount of time in in his combo (deadly charge, W -&gt; Q -&gt; E, or even better deadly charge W -&gt; Q -&gt; Counterstrike -&gt; E,).  If counterstrike activates he will do 3700+ dmg purely thru abilities.  Only Rewind combo zera can compete (and alarak can also get rewind)

249,"Abathur: A global presence hero who supplements team members and can soak, stall, and push when left to his own devices.  Weak early game presence compensated for by a powerful team fight ultimate and late game pushing or team fighting abilities.

Anub'Arak: a mobile dive warrior with good late game AoE damage and powerful CC.  Strong vs skill shot based heroes, but susceptible to being cc'd and bursted down when his defenses are down.

Artanis: A low mobility bruiser with strong displacement and the ability to stick to other low mobility heroes.  Very tanky if allowed to auto attack freely.  Once he's in, he's in and can be bursted down in CC.

Arthas: High crowd control, damage, and sustain off tank, but his lack of mobility requires smart flanks and he needs time to get his healing off.  If he catches someone he makes it very hard for them to get away.

Auriel: A manaless support who keeps healing as long as her team keeps doing damage.  Has trouble being useful if her team can't secure damage and must position safely as her only defense is a pushback and a stasis ultimate.  If her team is snowballing her healing will go through the roof.

Azmodan: Tanky, long range artillery mage with a strong split pushing kit.  His summons scout, block skills, and help push whether he's there or not, while his laser melts structures or dissuades melees from sticking to him if he's not CC'd.

Brightwing: A global AoE healer with a powerful CC in her base kit.  Good at split pushing and aggressively assisting in getting picks in a skirmish, but has trouble enabling melee heroes in a team fight when bursts of healing are needed.

Chen: A tanky, mobile bruiser who can stick to squishy heroes and displace them.  If there is little CC to disrupt his drink he can soak damage for days.  Limited CC outside of his ultimate and late game talents.

Cho'Gall - Two heroes in one body, a huge healthpool, manaless AoE dmg dealer with powerful ultimates and lots of mobility tools.  Weak to percentage damage and ways of isolating him from his team, allowing either him or his team mates to be focused down.

Chromie - A super long range, skill shot reliant burst mage who excels at damaging heroes.  She has little mobility and weak PvE dmg, but her ultimates can guarantee a pick or exert great zone control.

Dehaka: A global warrior with strong wave clear and sustain.  Has a powerful, hard to hit single target CC on a long cooldown in his 1 and his ultimate.  Has trouble navigating a team fight outside of smart flanking with his burrow and the predictability of his stasis makes him vulnerable to being bursted down.

Diablo: High health pool, high AoE damage, low sustain, great single target CC and displacement warrior.  Great at punishing out of position targets, but doing so puts him in a vulnerable position with little way to maneuver his way out.

ETC: The king of stuns and wombo combo potential, ETC gives up damage and wave clear for a powerful AoE stun, AoE displacement, and a game winning ultimate that can stun an entire team for 4 seconds.

Falstad: A global assassin with strong single target damage both from autos and abilities, good mobility, and a long range AoE poke that also clears waves well.  His ultimate is a versatile AoE displacement and slow that can force fights or  stop fights, save allies or secure kills on enemies.

... that's enough for me for now.

496,"https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Definition:Logical_Argument

A logical argument (or just argument) is a process of creating a new statement from one or more existing statements.

An argument proceeds from a set of premises to a conclusion, by means of logical implication, via a procedure called logical inference.

http://www.philosophypages.com/lg/e01.htm

Just remember the basic definition of an argument: it includes more than one proposition, and it infers a conclusion from one or more premises.

http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-informal/#Arg

Like classical logic, most work in informal logic has understood an argument as an attempt to present evidence for a conclusion. It does so by providing premises (“propositions” or claims or some sort) that support the conclusion. Hitchcock 2006 provides a precise account of this conception, defining an argument as “a claim-reason complex” consisting of (i) an act of concluding, (ii) one or more acts of premising (which assert propositions in favour of the conclusion), and (iii) a stated or implicit inference word that indicates that the conclusion follows from the premises.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument

In philosophy and logic, an argument is a series of statements typically used to persuade someone of something or to present reasons for accepting a conclusion.[1][2] The general form of an argument in a natural language is that of premises (typically in the form of propositions, statements or sentences) in support of a claim: the conclusion.[3][4][5] The structure of some arguments can also be set out in a formal language, and formally defined ""arguments"" can be made independently of natural language arguments, as in math, logic, and computer science.

http://www.iep.utm.edu/ded-ind/

A deductive argument is an argument that is intended by the arguer to be (deductively) valid, that is, to provide a guarantee of the truth of the conclusion provided that the argument's premises (assumptions) are true. This point can be expressed also by saying that, in a deductive argument, the premises are intended to provide such strong support for the conclusion that, if the premises are true, then it would be impossible for the conclusion to be false. An argument in which the premises do succeed in guaranteeing the conclusion is called a (deductively) valid argument. If a valid argument has true premises, then the argument is said to be sound.

http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/

In order to understand what a fallacy is, one must understand what an argument is. Very briefly, an argument consists of one or more premises and one conclusion. A premise is a statement (a sentence that is either true or false) that is offered in support of the claim being made, which is the conclusion (which is also a sentence that is either true or false).

http://www.logicalfallacies.info/

Arguments consist of premises, inferences, and conclusions.

530,"I suggest you actually learn philosophy before lecturing people on the basis of copy and pastes from internet fallacy websites. you will look like less of a fool.

""You are wrong"" is a statement (technically, in formal argument, it would be a claim) regardless of what precedes or does not precede it.  Being used in the course of an argument does not mean something is itself an argument.  Arguments are composed of various components connected by logical operators.  Claims are components of arguments but are not themselves arguments.  A claim alone cannot be dismissed on grounds of logical fallacy.

Being involved in an ""argument"" (use A) with you does not make the series of statements traded between us an ""argument"" (use B).  In arguing (use A) with each other we trade ""arguments"" (use B).  

Person A: ""I think X"" Person B: ""You are wrong"" = arguing (use A).  

You are wrong because P, N, M = an argument (use B).  

You cannot logically analyze the mere fact of disagreement in two people arguing (use A).  You can logically analyze the arguments they put forth for their positions.

&gt; At no point did I say ""you are wrong"" is a fallacious argument

&gt; by claiming that ""you are wrong"" without context is the same as ""Abathur mines are not fun"", which is an appeal to emotion

You are a liar.  Let me simplify your sentence: ""claiming that ""you are wrong"" without context ... is an appeal to emotion.""  What does this sentence imply (logically)?  It implies that my stating ""you are wrong"" is the commission of a logical fallacy.  In order for it to be a logical fallacy it would have to be involved in a logical argument - the relation of claims to evidence supporting them via logical operators.  It was not.

&gt; This is guilty of Alleged Certainty -

You have no clue what you are talking about.  All argument is based on the positing of claims.  I offered a provisional claim about a working definition of a game.  You do not understand how to apply logical fallacies.  I did not appeal to common knowledge in defining a game.  My definition of a game depends on the consensus of those who argue with me about how to define a game.  I did not say, ""a game is defined as such and such because everyone says that's how it's defined."" (appeal to alleged certainty)  I essentially said, ""I am defining a game as such.""

""Asserting a claim based on an entirely subjective premise is fallacious. And it is called Appeal to Emotion.""

This is just wrong.  You do not understand argument at all.

Concepts, words, ideas, the world we live in as interpreted through our language and ideation is subjective.  Pretty much all argument involves the assertion of subjective premises.  You do not understand argument or its scope.  You do not understand philosophy.  You need to stop pretending your cursory knowledge gleaned from logical fallacy websites is worth a damn.  Argument proceeds from mutual agreement about shared subjective experiences.  The assertion of ""entirely subjective premises"" is integral to argumentation about the contents of the world.

One way of defining a game is ""something that people do in order to have fun.""  Following this definition, a game causes those who play it to have fun.  

Let us call having fun ""enjoyment.""  

If a game does not produce enjoyment in its players, it is failing at being a game, because a goal of a game is to cause enjoyment.  

Therefore, critiquing a game for its failure to produce enjoyment is an apt criticism.  

Because games may not only be about fun, and because fun is participant relative, one person's estimation of how fun an aspect of a game is, is not alone sufficient to determine what is or is not optimal for a game.  Consequently, saying a feature should be removed from a game because it is not fun for you is an ""anecdotal fallacy"" but not a ""fallacy of appeal to emotion.""  

However, saying a feature should be removed because it is unfun (for most people, for all people, for people who play the game) is a staple form of argument about the design of a game, because game design is in part about producing enjoyment.",2016-07-13 02:48:39+00:00,d5a3pjw,3.0,t1_d59zuns,6141.0,heroesofthestorm

The role simply isn't going to compare to other mobas where healing is built through items and lifestealing so ""supports"" actually having powerful healing abilities is besides the point and therefore are much more like warriors with (if they even have any sort of healing or mitigation). 

Look at something like Smite and most of their ""supports"" (guardians) are pretty much HotS tanks.  While a few gods have healing abilities (and only a few of them are even supports), most healing is done through consumables, auras, and lifesteal.

Everytime I hear the ""more interesting supports please"" rant coming out recently it essentially sounds like ""I want to play a warrior.""  Problem is the game was designed so healing is a crucial team role.

981,"There are a few primary things teams are composed of: healing, rng dmg, melee dmg, control, sustainability/tankiness.

There are then secondary considerations: burst, sustain, single target, aoe, and poke dmg/healing; wave clear; push power, jungling, solo laning, pve dmg, global presence, engage/initiation, disengage, chase/stickiness, pick potential/roam, wombo-combo potential, isolation, area control, vision, peel, escape, interruption, mitigations (blinds, AS slows, invuln, unstoppable/relentless, spell shield...).

Maps, team comps, and responses to enemy team comps require different combinations of these primary and secondary qualities.
Understand what qualities heroes posses, what they are complemented or countered by, and what is ideal for each map and you are on the way to understanding drafting.

Examples:

BHB is a large map where globality and vision are useful, with a need for a solo lane bot, a jungler, and good wave clear mid-top.

BoE is a smaller map w/ a solo lane, a large area for vision control mid, and huge emphasis on single target pve dmg.

Thrall is a melee burst single target dmg dealer with good sustain, a solo laner, a jungler, has cc and engage/disengage/wombo/interrupt w/ sundering, and good poke. He benefits from burst healing/shielding and is punished by hard cc and blinds. He has strong pve dmg and can also roam effectively.

ETC is a tanky cc roamer w/ strong peel, some sustain, good engage/escape, and great wombo. He has weak waveclear so struggles against push, and his ult is ruined by interrupts. He relies on follow up on or set up for his wombo, meaning burst aoe dmg and more wombo, respectively.

Gazlowe is a solo laner, pusher and jungler with good area control, good wave clear, and a wombo ult. He lacks in most other areas - no escape, unreliable cc, meh sustained/poke dmg, &amp;etc.

Falstad is a global rnged single target burst and sustained dmg dealer. He has a good escape, a strong disengage/interruption ult, and great pick-off potential.

&amp;so on.

Gives a bit over 4,100 damage, more with GK over grace...  601, 502, 502, 390, 502, 803, 335, 502.  Takes ~4 seconds.  Minimum frostwolf from it is 8, with up to 4 more from the q and however much you can get off of sunder and w (over 9000 frostwolf resilience w/ worldbreaker Keepo).

1059,"for a 4 rotation the distance between lanes needs to be such that you can get all xp from each lane doing the rotation.  This is why tomb and dragonshire have their standard rotations.

4 man rotation is the default because it has both the greatest kill potential and the greatest safety.   A 4 man will clear faster than fewer heroes both because it has more resources to clear the wave and because it can push off the resources of the other team from clearing.  This means that you will gain time over the opponenent going to the next lane.  This creates asymmetries in the lanes: they have to leave someone to finish soaking xp in one lane while you move to the next, giving you a 4v3 or 4v2,  this gives you kill potential and also allows for free structure damage and ammo drain as you push the opponent into their towers.

The rotation distance on shrines and sky temple is not great for 4 manning, and in the case of sky temple it cedes control of an important resource: vision top.  However this can be offset if you are making gains in a 4 rotation on sky temple by stacking an azmodan, seasoned marksman, or globe collection talents.

The more important decision is how you lane on the large maps: Curse, garden.  This will depend on your comp and the enemy's comp.  Identify potent roamers: zeratul, nova, tyrande+stun tank.  If you have them, you want them to roam so you will have 1/1/1 and a gank squad.  If you are against them, you want to maximize the safety of your lanes.  You can either do this by matching their roam with a defensive roam (e.g. a muradin and uther counter roaming vs a zeratul and an ETC to protect their backliners in lane) or by demanding their roam respond to your lane.

In order to demand a response from their roam, you need to have a 3 man that forces their hand with strong push hereos.  Zagara, sylvanas, and xul are probably the best examples given their ability to disable towers and destroy structures if left unchecked.  A roam attempts to capitalize on inequalities in a lane.  By forcing them to respond, you make them treat all lanes equally so they cannot take advantage of their superior ability to profit from uneven lane match ups through the use of heroes designed to do so.

1/1/1 2 roam or 3/1/1 will almost always be superior to a 2/1/2 type set up.  The only reason to default to a 2/1/2 is to compensate for a lack of ability/coordination on the part of your team.  In a 2/1/2 you put the most unkillable person mid (e.g. a muradin, johanna, tyrael, or leoric)) and then have two sets of buddies in the side lanes.  This set up requires the least game sense.  You just sit in your lane and keep it neutral until an objective comes up

The problem with this is that it is very easy to stabilized a 1v2 match up.  Heroes like Jaina, zagara, kael thas, valla can easy hold themselves vs 2 in a lane unless they are up against a strong lane bully +1.  Accepting 1v2 match ups allows you to have 2 roam and capitalize easily on whichever of their lanes is the weakest.  Without a counter roam they will not have knowledge of your location so you can go to wherever someone is most overxtended/chunked and secure an easy kill.  A healer, tank, and assassin trio can even easily dive against towers/gate for a kill if someone is poked down a bit.  If you kill the lane coverage, the only way to cover it is to force a rotation, which is then itself easy to gank if it takes a path through the jungle.

Having a roam also allows you to easily compensate for a jungler transitioning to camps, cover a ganked lane, and optimize your positioning for responding to an objective.",2016-05-16 08:28:50+00:00,d379zd8,3.0,t1_d374dlb,15967.0,heroesofthestorm

BHB: 1 bot, 1 mid-top soak, 1 jungle; 2 roam -control vision and turn in, scout invades, support the jungler.

On the large 3 lane maps (curse, garden, shrines) you can do 1/1/1 2 roam or 2/1/2 or 3/1/1, just depends on your comp, their comp, what's happening in the game.

Roam is typically tank/healer (counter roam) or tank/burstiest+cc'iest assassin that's not a dominant solo laner (gank squad). Can also be support/assassin or double assassin.

4 rotations/lanes should have the tank, the support, and the strongest wave clear assassin.

Solo laners = thrall, zagara, chen, nazeebo, murky, tassadar, gazlowe, rexxar, sonya, illidan, falstad, brightwing. Many of the warriors in a double warrior comp can also solo lane (need: sustain/escape and decent wave clear - tyrael, arthas, johanna, leoric, stitches, dehaka). Solo wants sustain, survivability, escape, poke dmg.

You typically always want to start 5 mid on a map because A. you beat &lt;5 from the enemy  B. you lose to 5 if you send less C. you can respond to pressure in either side lane D. waves hit mid first E. you can clear mid as 5 w/o missing soak in other lanes

Exception is watchtower maps because their height doesn't permit rotation.  4/1 on bhb/sky temple.

frequently relative to what?  Two people can have the exact same proclivity to be toxic in a game and yet one will be silenced and one not simply because of game volume.

&gt; The whole theory that silenced players are just people with a ton of games doesn't really hold water either

you can't know whether it holds water unless you have data everyone else isn't privy to.

1126,"&gt; and it also directly contradicts OP's theory that silenced players are somehow carrying their teams to victory.

that theory is nowhere present in this thread.

&gt;  When they aren't silenced, they are not only damaging the game experience of other players, but also probably tilting them and ruining team focus.

the threads using data on toxicity in mobas have said toxic behavior is typically widespread with respect to how many people do it but infrequent with respect to how often anyone does it. Of course frequently toxic people exist. But Silenced players could be just as prone to toxicity in a given game but play orders of magnitude more games.  You actually don't know jack about the prototypical behavior of (ex)silenced players until you start controlling the relevant variables.

1183,"On fighting:

team fight at talent parity over objectives. Force when you have talent/player advantage and you aren't facing map pressure on structures or missing significant safe xp that will get you further ahead.

Things that make fights good/bad: talent differential, player # differential, ultimate/heroic cd differential, on structures, in minions, map pressure elsewhere.

On priorities: 

push on a keep &gt; (hard) push on a fort &gt; objective &gt; (weak) push on a fort = lane experience &gt; mercenary camps

On laning:

standard laning:

towers: 1/1/1 2 roam/counter roam.

infernal shrines: 1 top 4 rotate mid bot or 1/1/1 2 roam

battlefield: 1 top 4 bot. or vice versa

tomb: 1 bot 4 mid-top rotation.

sky temple: 1/1/1 2 roam to control vision. 1 top 4 mid bot rotation can work.

garden: 1/1/1 2 flex (roam, tri lane, jungle whatever)

BHB: 1 bot, 1 mid-top soak, 1 jungle; 2 roam -control vision and turn in, scout invades, support the jungler.

Dragon Shire: 1 top 4 rotate mid-bot. Can go into 1/1/1 2 roam if losing 4 man and need to gank/counter-pressure top.


Curse: Same as garden.  On the large 3 lane maps (curse, garden, shrines) you can do 1/1/1 2 roam or 2/1/2 or 3/1/1, just depends on your comp, their comp, what's happening in the game.


Roam is typically tank/healer (counter roam) or tank/burstiest+cc'iest assassin that's not a dominant solo laner (gank squad). Can also be support/assassin or double assassin.

4 rotations/lanes should have the tank, the support, and the strongest wave clear assassin.

Solo laners = thrall, zagara, chen, nazeebo, murky, tassadar, gazlowe, rexxar, sonya, illidan, falstad, brightwing.

From that perspective there are already quite a few silences in the basic kit of many heroes.

Just for purposes of defining basic concepts, Root = unable to move, Silence = Unable to cast, Blind = Unable to Basic Attack. So  Polymorphs = Silence+Blind, stuns = Silence + Blind + Root

Should there be more abilities that only stop casting but not movement and basic attacking?  Sure.  There's also room for exploring casting slows as parallels to AS slows and movement slows, which would, I guess, translate into cooldown delays.

He doesn't appeal to Diablo lore, he appeals to ""high fantasy.""  But his articulation is just text book D&amp;D which is not the Bible of high fantasy.

1371,"I like relentless predator at 16 on greymane.  The q talent gives you burst but situations where you are going to get any more than 2 qs out of it are rare, especially since q talents at 1 and 4 encourage being waaaay out of AA range of anything.  Popping w just for a single buffed q gets you some burst but meh.  75% cc reduction makes you incredibly slippery and survivable.

For the same reason I prefer running wild to on the prowl.  Can engage from way out of range, as Q talents encourage, and also are very safe when you escape, while keeping up on the prowl can be unreliable.

So instead of staying in AA range to keep up OTP and buffed Q, you Q from long distance then can go in for buffed melee damage and get out easily with upped disengage distance and cc reduction. 

This also allows for aggressive depush/soak in worgen form because you shrug off any cc and e out if people try to catch you.

All in all keeping W up just seems too unreliable outside of PvE and sieging situations to make talents contingent on W being active that consistent.  If I know I can sit around safely at AA range w/o any escapes in a TF then I'll go W-contingent talents.

I also like tooth and claw over blunderbuss sometimes.  Blunder buss again is great if sieging or when you can AA safely, but tooth and claw is better depush and merc and gets great value if you are going in for dmg to follow up on any mass cc (like a mosh pit) and to take advantage of Divine Shield/Ancestral type support.",2016-04-14 20:18:45+00:00,d232490,1.0,t3_4ertpe,15347.0,heroesofthestorm

1449,"There are a few primary things teams are composed of: healing, rng dmg, melee dmg, control, sustainability/tankiness.

There are then secondary considerations: burst, sustain, single target, aoe, and poke dmg/healing; wave clear; push power, jungling, solo laning, pve dmg, global presence, engage/initiation, disengage, chase/stickiness, pick potential/roam, wombo-combo potential, area control, vision, peel, escape, interruption, mitigations (blinds, AS slows, invuln, unstoppable/relentless, spell shield...).

Maps, team comps, and responses to enemy team comps require different combinations of these primary and secondary qualities.

Understand what qualities heroes posses, what they are complemented or countered by, and what is ideal for each map and you are on the way to understanding drafting.

Examples:  

BHB is a large map where globality and vision are useful, with a need for a solo lane bot, a jungler, and good wave clear mid-top.

BoE is a smaller map w/ a solo lane, a large area for vision control mid, and huge emphasis on single target pve dmg.

Thrall is a melee burst single target dmg dealer with good sustain, a solo laner, a jungler, has cc and engage/disengage/wombo/interrupt w/ sundering, and good poke.  He benefits from burst healing/shielding and is punished by hard cc and blinds.  He has strong pve dmg and can also roam effectively.

ETC is a tanky cc roamer w/ strong peel, some sustain, good engage/escape, and great wombo.  He has weak waveclear so struggles against push, and his ult is ruined by interrupts.  He relies on follow up on or set up for his wombo, meaning burst aoe dmg and more wombo, respectively.

Gazlowe is a solo laner, pusher and jungler with good area control, good wave clear, and a wombo ult.  He lacks in most other areas - no escape, unreliable cc, meh sustained/poke dmg, &amp;etc.

Falstad is a global rnged single target burst and sustained dmg dealer.  He has a good escape, a strong disengage/interruption ult, and great pick-off potential.

&amp;so on.

1610,"W, W, Battle Momentum, Shadowstalk, Overflowing Light, W, Shadowstalk is standard healing tyrande.

Taking empower means taking pierce.  Taking ranger means taking pierce.  However taking pierce doesn't mean taking ranger or empower.

You can take trait CDR at 1 if you aren't taking W talents.

You can take protective shield or healing ward if you have multiple high health pool targets, don't need interrupts for objective channels, and aren't going any other W talents.  You take shield vs single target burst, ward for drawn out objective fights.

Battle momentum = more healing.  Lunar blaze = better cc follow up and ganking.

Always shadowstalk.

Overflowing light, shrink ray, or sprint depend on whether you need healing, threat mitigation, or self-protection.

Trueshot aura is if you have characters like valla, raynor, greymane, thrall on your team.  Lunar blaze can be paired with shooting star if you didn't go pierce.

You take rewind with an owl build for damage. Not really typical. Otherwise it's ult upgrade or storm shield, depending on what is more necessary (mitigation or engage/disengage).

against triple ranged/mages: q, q, trait, sunder, spell shield, q, bolt

against multi warrior - w, q, trait, sunder, gaint killer, tempest fury, bolt

If you are going to be taking dmg from a greymane, zeratul, sonya, other thrall, block will mitigate alot of damage.  Since you will be melee dueling them, trait at 13 is a reliable way to get more sustain in a duel.

Some solo laners in HotS are more like mid laners/mages in smite, some are more like warriors.  In hots solo lane is about self sustain + safe harass and this isn't confined to any class.  Some solos are warriors, some are assassins, some are specialists.  hell, some are supports.

support: lt. morales ~ aphrodite, tyrande ~ cupid, muradin/johanna/ETC/Tyrael/Arthas/@etc ~ Khepri/Cabrakan/Ymir/Athena/Ares/&amp;etc.

HotS assassins include smite's mages, hunters, and assassins.  Same w/ ""specialists"" which is a non-useful category except for the 2 actually special chars, vikings and abathur.

But he can solo camps quickly (paying in health), he can push quickly, he can dps pve objectives hard, and when played intelligently he is pretty resistant to ganking.  

Smart play during a TF can easily get two kills fast, and with a support he should get out ok from that aggressive play, but without a good support you can still 2 for 1 for your team and come out ahead.

So he has a solid laning phase, decent pick potential, good push, good mercing, good ability to win pve objectives, and good ability to quickly swing a team fight as well as solidify a lead from a won team fight with rapid chase/kill secure when prudent.  All that adds up to a decent amount of carry potential.",2016-02-17 07:35:06+00:00,d02z5if,2.0,t1_d02m9pn,24065.0,heroesofthestorm

1976,"Been playing alot of graymane lately.

I was going standard cocktail (q, q, q, GFT, OTP, q, blunderbuss) but have slowly modified it into q, q, q, GFT, running wild, relentless predator assuming there is sufficient CC to warrant it, otherwise q.

Used to like wolfheart but imo you just need to manage your w intelligently.  It's too high mana to be spamming anyways and you really only need it for sustained PvE damage and at the right moment in TFs.  I've started trying scented tincture vs zeratul and I really like it.  10s is a loooong time (long enough for q to come off cd and reveal him again.)  Hitting him does alot for your team during laning phase as long as they pay attention to the mini map.  

I've switched to running wild over On the Prowl because as much as I love OTP, I find kiting around with his AAs and W up is not really how I end up playing him.  This often puts you too close for comfort and open to being engaged upon by the ETCs and Diablos of this world.  I value staying back with huge Q ranged and being able to e huge distances more.

Because of this I've started to value relentless more.  Since I don't find myself able to just auto stuff in Inner Beast while tossing out a stream of buffed cocktails every 9 seconds common, I'm liking making my dive safer, better.  Since worgen is not just for engaging on, say, a kt (who gets wrecked when his stun on your darkflight is only .25 seconds) but also for general safety (e in when people go on you in human, q away, e out) having relentless while you're in it complements the strategy

I already prefer worgen for clearing lanes because it gives you our escapes and worgen q is cheaper wave clear than human q, and buffing cocktail to clear minions is an especially wasteful mana proposition at 16.  So having relentless when I'm doing that just makes me even safer.  Also worgen form is great for dealing with Zag creep.

This is especially important because one of Genn's greatest strengths, imo, is his PvE.  His clear is quite good for Tomb/Shrines and his boss melting is super strong right off the bat on, say, BoE.  His l1 auto dps is 290/s - it's simply insane - outclassing everyone in the game, even a full meat butcher.

Just had a game with him where I did 280k siege (80k more than next closest), had 5-6k more xp than anyone else, while also going 13/15/1 on tomb.  Held so many gems, safely, for much of the game because of the ability to rotate and clear aggressively while knowing I was uncatchable with disengage.  Your E allows you to rotate very quickly.  E onto a wave from the side, q twice and auto down the creeps, e out towards the next lane.  The e distance adds up for the speed of your rotations.

The other build I would consider is probably something like viciousness/wolfheart, insatiable or q, quicksilver, OTP, q, blunderbuss.  having raynor style range makes the perma W human kiting a much more consistent strategy.  You'll have to hit your human Qs but this build would be more anti frontline (sitting autoing a tank from +20% range) so you should have reliable targets to explode cocktail on.  This sort of Jimm Raymane build was the first I saw and tried for his kit.",2016-02-17 03:16:23+00:00,d02rs9b,1.0,t3_465ex4,11552.0,heroesofthestorm

 I'd say actives uther, kharazim, and brightwing are difficult and prob not advisable.  Uther can be easy if you go w talents @ 4/7 with hardened focus @ 16, but still requires careful cd management

Rehgar can be straightforward but optimal play requires knowledge of when/how to bodyblock and ancestral timing.  

Malf is similar to medic w/r/t his positioning but his cd and mana management is more involved and he requires active tracking of more stuff with the utility of roots, moonfire, and innervate alongside healthbar management.  I'd put him at moderate difficulty.

in sum, 

lili for spamming buttons and positioning aggressively for blinds,

2128,"since you're actually incapable of basic math let's spell things out.

assume 100/80 split for n1.  

n2 t1 has 0 seeds t2 has 80.  T2 gets seeds for a terror in 80% the time of t1, assuming seeds get gathered at a common rate initially.

This means t2 can have an active plant while t1 still needs close to 4/5 of their plant and close to 140 seeds are open on the map.

Having a terror active during night phase allows either advantaged tf over remaining seeds (either because terror engages in 5v5 w/ polymorph advantage or because multiple ppl back to defend push, creating a 4v3) or free value on terror (no one defends or solo hero defense).

In contrast, after n1 the terror typically cannot contest seeds.  w/ no main obj to contest t2 defends 3/1/1 during a period they would tri lane regardless. Night phase terrors when the other team doesn't have one force the non-plant team to split or suffer when they want to be grouped.

plants not active during night phase ask 1 question: how do i best defend plant push.  plants during night phase ask 2 questions: how do i defend plant push **while also** securing seeds.  When only one team has to handle both qs, as happens when a team can get out their plant significantly faster during night, the asymmetry creates advantage.",2016-02-01 02:25:45+00:00,czj9blq,,t1_czj686b,5231.0,heroesofthestorm

2316,"Distinctly early game: kerrigan.  Her stun combo is very potent early, but late game people have more mitigations and the long cds on her abilities plus the all in nature of her combo make her less effective in fights.

Late game: Kael'thas.  His base abilities are not that effective.  His q is easy-ish to dodge and his w is good poke on a single target but doesn't do that much.  With his 7 and 13 talents, his W gets a big damage increase and starts doing massive AOE damage and forcing enemies to move in ways they may prefer not to.  

Or Artanis - pre 16 he has no way to stick to a target and can only hope to swap someone and get in a few aa's as people walk away from him.  Once he hits 16, he can stick to people, which not only ensures good damage on enemies, but also keeps his trait going and ensuring his tankiness.  Before 16, often times Art will need to hit stuff but have no way to get to the things he can hit.

Compare KT to Jaina - Jaina's abilities do huge aoe damage right from the start, and her trait makes blizzard more reliably get damage than flamestrike

Compare Thrall to Artanis - Thrall has a 1 second root and a 30% move speed bonus from level 1, plus a ranged poke ability.

2317,"It might help you to understand the variety of ways to approach getting minion experience, which is pretty much all soaking is - getting the xp from minion deaths.  

Soaking is part of lane/minion management.  You can also push/depush (that is, quickly kill off the minions) your lanes to affect how relatively safe you and your opponent each are in lane and to affect how quickly you can rotate from a lane.  

The basic trade off is that pushing a lane allows you to rotate faster but makes you more vulnerable in lane and your opponent safer, and also prevents you from attempting to zone your opponent off of XP soak.  

Whether you want to freeze your lane (let the minions kill each other, staying in the middle of the lane), let your opponent push (let him clear waves and get closer to your towers), push your opponent (clear waves and push your opponent to his towers), zone your opponent (stand on his side of his minions and keep him away from the deaths of your minions), or be able to rotate in/out of a lane (kill the minions and then leave) is all variable and takes experience to learn.",2016-01-08 09:23:13+00:00,cyqftq9,2.0,t1_cyq8hr4,18861.0,heroesofthestorm

2393,"The passage of yourself you repeat makes no sense: 'somebody with a low skill ceiling ... will have a high ceiling."" It's not clear what exactly you're trying to demonstrate.

How much of a difference there is between bad players and good players is a function of the skill floor and skill ceiling, but that doesn't hinge at all on your definition.

If you think ""floor"" doesn't make sense with ""you must be this tall to ride"" then you don't understand english.  Another way of saying ""you must be this tall to ride"" is ""the minimum height requirement for this ride is ""x.""  That's a floor.  If there's a maximum height, that's a ceiling.  The analogy is perfectly coherent and apt.

A floor is a downward limit.  Some downward limits are minimum requirements.  ""Floors,"" in the non-literal sense, generally are used to refer to minimum requirements.

As to what you say makes perfect sense, it's not at all clear how what you say makes perfect sense contradicts the common (and correct) usage of skill floor and skill ceiling.  The downward limit on performance is the minimum level of competency required to use a character.  This is an abstract, non-literal quality of games/moba characters because any conception of a minimal skill requirement will be arbitrarily defined.  A monkey mashing a keyboard can make a moba character do stuff.  That doesn't meet anyone's conception of the skill floor for a character.",2016-01-01 09:10:21+00:00,cyi6e6b,9.0,t1_cyi0f6a,18781.0,heroesofthestorm

Raynor: (Give me more, Focused Attack, Rev overdrive, Hyperion, Double Barrel, Berserk, Nexus) Straight aa, no ability usage - ~450/sec.  Berserk+Inspire, ~750/sec over 6 seconds.  Just using inspire, over 16 seconds: ~550/sec.  Max AS for max GK damage: 2.37 for 4 seconds.

Zera: (block, master warp blade, searing, shadow assault, assassin's blade, berserk, nexus blades) 1500/sec for 5 seconds decaying to 900/sec by 10 seconds only using Searing, SA, Berserk.  ~500/sec straight auto-ing, using no talents or abilities.  AS For GK: 1.78 for 4s, decaying to 1.33 for 5s more (with berserk plus Nerazim's Fury).

Falstad: (Updraft, Power Throw, Secret Weapon, Gust, Static Shield, Hammer Time, Nexus Frenzy).  Just AA: ~400/sec.  Q, W, AA: ~1200/sec over 5 seconds.  AS for GK: 1.71.  Two Q casts worth of AA, 13 seconds ~600/sec.

Butcher: Invigoration, Flail Axe, Abattoir, LTTS, Savage Charge, Blood Frenzy, Nexus Blades: ~900/sec at full stacks.  Weaving in hamstrings doesn't affect much; he has some initial burst/follow up burst from savage charge.

Valla: (rancor, manticore, searing attacks, strafe, frost shot, stoneskin, nexus frenzy).  Just AA, full hatred: ~630/sec. One full q + searing, over 5 seconds: ~930/sec. AS for GK: 2.25 at full stacks.

Hammer: (advanced artillery, focused attack, first aid, napalm strike, first strike, graduating range, nexus frenzy).  Just AA ~630/sec. W/ napalm strike ever 5s: ~780/s.  AS for GK (loses first strike bonus) 1.2.

Note that both Zera and Falstad can match raynor with Seasoned Marksman and all these heroes except butcher can match with GK, with valla out-competing all comers for max GK value over time.  A Falstad spamming q, a stacked valla, and hammer all out DPS a raynor spamming inspire.  With marksman Raynor can outscale Hammer and Valla and close the gap with falstad due to Ray's slightly higher AS.  

Where Raynor actually can outperform many of these heroes is in fact with his initial burst, not his sustained damage, using the q build: focused attack, q, follow up q is a 3 second lock down + burst combo that puts out ~1k/sec for the period.

2470,"I bought morales recently and have been really liking her.  I pick her if we have a solid frontline (double warrior, or warrior plus a high presence melee assassin who can peel with their cc, like a thrall or butcher) or if the other team has a draft that presents zero threat to me (triple ranged single tank).

She has a lot of talent diversity imo. At L1 If they can get to me somehow (stealthies, double frontline), I go trauma trigger.  Otherwise prolonged safeguard for value or scouting drone if it's nice to have on the map.

At L4 advance block vs nova/zera or (and conceivably thrall butcher, but not likely I'd pick medic into them).  Otherwise, upgraded ballistics.

At l7, all talents viable.  Mule/cleanse based on map/enemy comp.  Clear if you don't need anyting else.  Irradiate if I've got a solid frontline that's going to be up in people's business alot.

10 usually stim.  Just easier to use in unncoordinated play and there's usually a good target on our comp for it.  Medivac if there's not a good stim target.

13 spell shield usually for protection from your novas, zeras, mage flanks.  Couples therapy possible but the sort of damage it deals with usually can be handled by your trait, since it's a solution to poke not burst.  Preventative care an option if you're supporting a melee carry against aa heroes.

At 16, inoculation if vs a high burst comp, second opinion esp with other grenade buffs, system shock if your team doesn't have that many other sources of good control or is speccing into executioner talents, as it's a quite significant slow.

20 always caduceous.

2471,"LMAO, no one is saying it isn't a bug that shouldn't be fixed.  People are responding to the ridiculous hysterics that the Grace of Air bug makes windfury build ""unplayable.""

And I quote, ""Grace of Air is basically crucial if you want to go WF build.""  ""People prolly think Thrall players are crying but it makes Windfury build unplayable.""  ""The issue is that one talent is the staple of his E build.""

The talent isn't crucial or staple and it doesn't make wf build unplayable.  Tempest fury is really the only key component to an E build - maybe Windshear at 7.  But CDR at 7 can be swapped with follow through - higher burst vs more frequent instances of burst; both have their advantages.  

Giant Killer synergizes just as well with tempest fury as Grace of Air and spell shield is sometimes superior mitigation than Grace.  

Seasoned, despite its synergy with tempest fury and WF in general, isn't a default pick. Block is often preferred for survivability or even the CL talents since there is no WF talent at 4 and while envenom can compensate for the relatively weaker early game on WF build, it's by no means integral to the build.  1/4 CL talents are independently strong without the double charge at 16 so can fit into WF just fine.",2015-12-21 22:21:43+00:00,cy72yam,2.0,t1_cy6tzpa,13428.0,heroesofthestorm

There is no dedicated jungling role, but there are characters who are roamers for kills (zeratul, nova the classics) or good at PvE and taking jungle camps.

2731,"The ""if you had"" is there to evoke situations in which someone decides to focus a damager and someone decides to focus core and you lose.  Sometimes all core could be right, sometimes all on the damager could be right.  High damage heroes can do alot quick if left alone.

Here's something that just happened. I'm falstad 1v4.  Tyrael, leo, monk, kt all go for our core, they are full or close to it health with varying mana levels, no one completely out, some maybe at 1/3, some near full.

They are all focusing it.  I come out of the hearth area. Kt stop to pyroblast me, I delete him instantly with q, w, auto attacks before it can channel.  Would have happened whether he was unloading on core or otherwise.  

Now it's just leo, tyrael monk.  I auto monk to half health.  At this point they decide I'm a problem.  Monk 7 sided's me.  I e out, heal for a few seconds in base, come back in.  

Tyrael judges me, I immediately hinterland all 3 of them for a lot and pop q and w on tyrael, chunking him for 50%, putting him to near zero, in seconds and forcing hardened shield.  

Meanwhile, Lili has come up.  She's on leo and khara, still focusing core, with the blinds shortly after tyrael judge's me.  She autos monk, he dies, I auto leo, he dies, I auto tyrael, he dies.

If kt had focused core and not me, he would have gotten 1-2 autos and died.  So the question is whether maybe 15 seconds max lost of some combination of tyrael and monk auto attacks used over ulting me kill the 48% of the core we had left by the time I had wiped them all.  

Compare that to all 4 going on me instantly when I pop out of core: judge, seven sided, pyro combo = dead falstad, 4 live heroes, and only a lili to threaten coming out in ~13 seconds.",2015-11-05 06:20:11+00:00,cwp55bn,11.0,t1_cwjstuu,379233.0,heroesofthestorm
2732,"don't die in your lane should be familiar from lol, but one thing to figure out will be the flexibility of laning in HoTS.  You're not stealing anyone's farm so there is no lane propriety here.

It's not duo/mid/solo/jg-roam on every map vs every team or with every team comp, and lane positions are much more flexible. 

You want minimum one hero (or viking/abathur hat) in a lane when enemy minions are dying pre 10, excepting objective fights.  And ideally you still get soak post 10 when safely possible.

  Aside from that you have tons of flexibility.  It will take learning the heroes and maps to figure out how to use that flexibility.

power throw (safer harass, +20% slow is huge, synergy w/ other hammerang talents),

flow rider (best of a bad talent tier, rip gp.  charged up viable vs a frontline you aren't too threatened by as you can sit on em for awhile and if you feel safe staying close then you must not need e as much), 

secret weapon (boomerang if needing wave clear or vs multiple blinds), 

usually hinterlands (gust if i think we need the disengage), 

static shield vs triple damage (quasi stoneskin on 15 sec cd) or giant killer vs multi warrior (maybe thunderstrikes with charged up?  i took this for awhile from habit playing with gp, but i think survivability on w is better vs squish and giant killer better damage vs non-squish), 

hammertime (having an interrupt is huge, and .75 sec allows you to output alot of damage, also great for killing abathurs - stun when they burrow),

epic mount (nexus frenzy if closing out a game).  Insane utility.  Your z is basically always up.  If you're playing on a map where mobility isn't important, why'd you pick the falstud?

I like him vs...

other globals (aba, bw, tlv) cause of his soak potential, 

some melee assassins (illidan, butcher.  zera too in/out, kerri maybe but stunlock is bad for you) - slap a w on them, q them kite them.  If they want you they will eat alot of dmg,

warriors - i'd prob go raynor or valla aa before falstad unless there's another reason for the bird, but he can kite warriors easily and is a bit better vs attack speed slows and blinds due to w.  But if you want ability based anti frontline, chain bomb kt better.

other mages/immobile ability based squish.  You can dodge blizzard, grav lapse flamestrike, zagara/naz crap, snipe.  Once their cds are down they don't have shit.  they can't dodge your w and unlike them your aas hit hard and fast (ok zag w/ envenomed spines hits pretty hard).  Bait their cds and if map state allows you can e in, q, w and duel them pretty well.  With an 8.5 sec cd on your e from flow rider, if they aren't dead you ought to be able to get out when they become a threat again and then q for your disengage.  You have crazy burst at 7 so you power spike pretty early for dueling.

Like him with... 

roamers.  Zera or nova want to kill someone?  Fly into a bush and go in with them. Diablo - you wanted out of my w?  Sorry, overpowered.

Lockdown combos.  Maw/vp/mosh then hinterlands.  Tyrael: judge + hinterland = crispy taco.  


Like him on... Curse, BHB, Dragonshire, Shrines, Battlefield, Temple.  Z strong for drawn out sustain based fights and quick rotations, so he's good on maps with either or both of those.

2761,"When learning zera I think the main thing is just be safe.  Being on the team alone makes people play differently.  Regen master, Focused, Follow through, VP, wormhole, Rending cleave, nexus blades or rewind is what I go.  You can take defensive talents like first aid and stoneskin if it feels right.

Early, roam, get globes, poke some damage if you can, ping for a gank if someone is already low.  Try to coordinate pick offs on rotations to objectives.  With follow through, you can take siege giants effectively solo at the least.  You're also a safe pusher/soaker because of your escape and strong wave clear with cleave (esp with rending.)  As a bonus, when you're taking a siege camp or rotating to a lane to push it, the enemy has to be afraid you're out trying to kill them because of your stealth.

Ganks are almost the last thing you should be thinking about.  You're helping your low wave clear lanes push, collecting globes, harassing when you can, tracking and matching enemy rotations, and only when conditions are right do you put in the risk to get a kill.

For team and objective fights, get your team vision by approaching the enemy/objective from safe angles by flanking in ways that don't put you in the middle of the enemy's rotation.  Take roundabout roots, use bushes.  People can spot your shimmer and you don't want to get caught.

Your team can better situation themselves and engage due to your vision.  You should wait for cooldowns on stuns and aoes to get used before you go in on a target.  Walk up or blink in with wormhole on squishy targets to harass.  You don't need to stay in for a kill.  Poke, get out.  If you can vp a portion of their back line, either mid fight or as an initiation, go for it so the team can pick on the front line.  Wait for your cooldowns to reset, maybe go near your healer for a little top off, then go in to poke again.  

You're harassing and zoning the back line by putting poke on them and always threatening engaging on them from stealth.  If they let themselves get too low and are out of position for a moment, they know they can die to you.

Your time to shine, safely, is towards the end of fights.  People have used their cooldowns, they're low health, they're backing off a bit.  You are relatively safe to go ham picking people off with ability auto attack combos.  You can stay on targets longer to ensure the kill and you can start blinking a bit more aggressively with the knowledge that you'll be finishing who you engage on and don't have to worry about a whole team's worth of cd's turning on you.",2015-10-24 23:11:51+00:00,cwbmmc3,1.0,t3_3ppqpr,250726.0,NexusNewbies

2764,"Lvl 1:  Regen master.  Purge evil iff 2nd warrior AND 2 lane map.

Lvl 4.  Amp healing, always w/ regen master.  Vamp strike if qm no healer.  Retribution iff purge evil and you don't think you need buffed healing from your support  (but its effect is insane w/ heals like uther q, ancestral, double support - tass w/ leeching = 40% lifesteal)

lvl 7 - battle momentum.  lowering all your cds too good, especially your ults.

10 - Sancti against heavy dive vs your backline (e.g. locust swarm anub, sonya ) and wombo aoes.  Bad vs vp unless you can reliably save it for after.  Can be used with heavy melee dive if your team has sufficient lockdown to keep some of the enemy on the point.  Also strong on infernal shrines because of how the objective fights work.

Judgement the less situational ult.  Take it for a guaranteed interrupt (vs strafe, rav, cups, mosh pit).  Know whether you need to use it to initiate and blow up, peel, interrupt, or chase/secure.  Also good just for getting pick offs.  Know your kill combos - judge + seven sided, hinterland's, jaina combo, chain stuns, and so on.  Be patient w/ your initiation.  Wait for bad positioning.  Tyrael has ranged harass - you can afford to poke and judge only when positioning is right.

lvl 13- imposing will.  old imp presence was awesome.  tyrael still has it, and he still has it 3 levels early.  Absorption  possible with amp healing vs ability damage burst comps.  I think imp will is too good to justify burning even vs a zag.  You can tumor clear with e.

16 - Holy ground.  B4B possible vs multi warrior/azmodan.  Esp good vs stitches, diablo. Unfortunately does not synergize with Amp Healing (not sure why).

20 - Hardened shield.  Nexus blades if ahead and you just want to body people more, angel of justice if ahead and you have frequent judgement targets/opportunities, holy arena can be good for closing out a game (4 second team invuln with 25% damage boost on the core?  Yes please?)


Q - Save it.  It's your escape, your engage, your chase/body block, your peel, your last hit behind the wall, your bait.  Also good for dismounting and messing people up on rotations to an objective.  Use if for when it counts for its utility.  You are a many hungry angel.  Don't use it for wave clear, smite is your aoe damage.  Smite does more damage initial and scales more.

W - try to time it for enemy aoe's, can help your wave in lane or help your team.   Also your most expensive ability so use it wisely.  It helps counter taste for blood azmodunk.

E - your bread and butter.  Use it to help wave clear, should be able to hit the whole wave with it.  Use the speed boost wisely.  You can clear an enemy wave and haste yours to the towers to make them lose soak if they are out of lane.  Try to e the hero and the wave, you can then move in and use the speed to stutter step and auto while kiting another melees autos or just backing out quickly from killing a wizard/picking up a globe.  Ideally you can roam early, e a wave to help clear, get your globe, and the e boost helps your waves in lane push in a little bit faster.

Trait - People hate it.  I think it's alright.  Could be buffed a bit (make even in death default?  definitely make it scale better late game.  It gains 40 damage a level while every hero except like valla is gaining 3x+ that in health)  but in drawn out sustain fights on like curse or shrines you can sometimes suicide at the tail end of a fight and turn it for your team by killing their poked down no escape backline.  Yeah, being leo would be stronger but take what you can get.  

Lastly, base when you can.  With BM and the already low cooldown on smite you use abilities a lot.  In a TF you basically have opportunity to be using everything whenever it's up, so you drain mana fast, and have much less utility without mana.  But if you come in full and can get an amp healing powered tap part way through a fight, you will be adding a lot.",2015-10-24 19:34:16+00:00,cwbfpx2,1.0,t3_3q1lg4,11696.0,heroesofthestorm

Another aspect to laning is making trades against your opponent that are favorable in anticipation of objectives.  If you can out trade your opponent in terms of health/mana, this can give you an advantage in team fights and rotations.

2825,"Zeratul - Good against triple ranged comps.  Also good vs some other melee assassins as he can damage them then get out (butcher, illidan.)    The lockdown on kerrigan and thrall can be harder to deal with.  The more warriors in a comp, and the more stunlock, the worse for zeratul, as he will have trouble getting in without immediately being cc'd and peeled off or engaged on and zoned when he blinks out.  Doesn't require the sort of protection (d-shield, etc) that other melee assassins benefit highly from.

Illidan - Weak vs blinds and muradin's attack slows + stun lock.  Benefits greatly from shielding and attack speed buffs which allow him to heal back up.  Quite strong against most anything that doesn't have lockdown vs him, as he can just keep avoiding ability damage, evading auto attacks, and sticking to the squishiest targets with his natural ability to shut down kiting and body block escapes.  Will even shred tanks when they are all that's left.

Butcher - particularly strong vs tanks and with complementary stunlock and shielding.  Weak to blinds, stunlock, and kiting.

Kerrigan - a better melee assassin when a comp is resistant to auto attack damage (blinds, muradin) as she does most of her damage through abilities.  Also less susceptible to stunlock as she is much more of an initiator who gets in her main damage with her opening.  Plus, maelstrom keeps going if you're stunned.  That opening also gives her shielding and locks out people from using abilities, especially with follow up stuns and ability damage from her team mates.  Pairs well with aoe damage (Jaina, Kael).

Uther is the premiere melee assassin support, with his stun and d-shield.  Rehgar and monk are also good with their burst healing potential, which has the benefit of providing another health bar but the detraction of not being as proactive as d-shield.  Tassadar and Brightwing are viable for their shields, while B-dub can also aid roam and gank strategies with her polymorph and global presence.  

Tyrande, Muradin, Anub'Arak, E.T.C., Uther, and Rexxar are all good candidates for adding stuns to Butcher and Kerrigan, while Arthas can add a root.
  
Tyrael is good for going in with a melee assassin and protecting them + aiding them in chasing or escaping with his shields on W, slow on Q, and haste on E.  Can also help isolate the melee assassin's target with his 16 talent, holy ground.

2867,"The roles are:

Warriors:

tank: offers crowd control and durability (johanna, muradin premiere examples)

bruiser: durable and heavy hitting melee.  Softer CC, less sustain, better engage or damage than other warriors (premiere bruiser is Leoric.)

A number of warriors can be talented tankier or brusier: Arthas, Tyrael, Anub'Arak.  They all have pretty good CC, with Anub (2x stuns, big fat beetle body blocks) &gt; Arthas(roots and slows) &gt; Tyrael (ulti stun, slows) for disruption

Melee assassin: Zeratul is the premiere.  High burst, very powerful escape.  Kerrigan and Butcher offer harder engage but less escape.  Illidan has high mobility but needs baby sitting.

Support: 

healers: Malfurion, Uther, and Rehgar are the top.  Uther has most utility but least total healing power.  Rehgar has both burst healing and sustained healing and can put out some of the highest healing numbers, but less utility.  Malf has all the Heal over Time but no burst healing.  

LiLi and Monk can put out great healing but each have easy counters (stuns wreck lili's ult, blinds and stuns wreck monks trait and E.)  They do have their own benefits - Monk is really great at supporting a front line and Lili works wonders vs auto-attackers with her blinds.

utility: tassadar and tyrande.  Each offer vision, pretty good ranged damage output, some form of team healing/damage mitigation and some other utility options.  Tyrande brings the stuns, Tassadar has wave clear and great survivability.  When included in a comp they typically take a slot that would go to a ranged dps.

Ranged Damage: Among ranged damage there's  heroes which mostly poke, heroes which mostly burst, and heroes mostly do sustained single target damage.  All the competitive specialists offer some type of good ranged damage that's not quite at assassin level in exchange for their other utility as pushers.  Burst and poke are generally preferred to sustained ranged damage.

Burst: Jaina is the premier.  Kael, Falstad, and Q build Valla all have some burst potential but with caveats.

Poke: Nazeebo, Kael'Thas, Azmodan, Multishot Valla.  Can harass a team with their AoE damage.

Sustained damage: Auto attack valla, Zagara.  Sgt. Hammer, Falstad, and Raynor also offer this but aren't seen much in competitive play.

Sylvanas is another ranged damage dealer but she saw her burst potential nerfed so her damage is not too impressive now.  More taken for her utility (wave clear, disabling buildings, engaging with wailing arrow).

Team compositions vary.  You'll typically see some combo of 1-2 warrior, 2-3 ranged, 0-1 melee assassin, 1-2 support (usually 1). 1-3-0-1, 2-3-0-1, 2-2-1-1, 1-2-1-1 all viable.

Nova is generally not thought to be very good, and has taken a big hit with the recent nerf to Gathering Power.

2868,"Valla, malf, muradin for sure.  All cheap and good.  Then, by role in order of priority:

support: uther, rehgar, lili

warrior: johanna, anub, leoric

ranged damage: jaina, kt, nazeebo, zagara, sylvanas.

Always put characters you enjoy and feel competent  with before those you don't feel good with.  Just find what you like from those, I'd say.

Tychus, Falstad are ranged damage that generally aren't seen as equal to the other options but can be solid in a pinch (e.g. the mages are already taken), and also have a lower price point.

Melee assassins other than Zera either require a lot of team support (butcher, illidan) or aren't seen as up to snuff (Thrall).  Kerrigan can be solid but typically needs a coordinated gank squad early to pay off.

Tyrael and Arthas can both be good warriors but are more situationally useful/team dependent (dive/anti-dive) and often much more bruiser than tank.  ETC just isn't as strong as the other CC-y warriors.

Among specialists Azmo and Abathur are both good but require team support and in the case of Aba lots of game knowledge.

The off supports (tyrande, tassadar) can be good but need a team that complements them and won't suffer from their relative weak points.  Monk is good but mostly in certain comps and can be counter picked pretty hard.

Most other characters aren't considered ""good enough"" though with the updates Hammer, Sonya, Thrall are all a bit more competitive.

Put characters you enjoy and feel competent  with before those you don't feel good with, though probably best to save the ""not good enough"" heroes for qm otherwise you'll tend to get a lot of grief in HL.  ",2015-08-24 00:27:45+00:00,cudd6ce,1.0,t3_3i2i1m,47999.0,NexusNewbies

People consider Jo and Leo to be *the* two tier one tanks right now, and a large part of it is their wave clear.  You've zeroed in on what makes them so strong right now relative to all other warriors.  They can clean up their lane and go do something useful (get to objective first, gank in a nearby lane and return) faster than other tanks

You can improve the wave clear on anub and mura though, by taking thunderburn at 4 on Mura and utricating spines on Anub at 7 (also burning rage at 13 on Anub.  Mura has that option, I think, but better talents available for him).

Of course, there are things about other tanks that are great and can make them preferable to Jo/Leo, but the power of the wave clear on those two makes them more generically good and less situational.  You'll always benefit from that fast soak and added time to be useful on the map.",2015-08-22 21:31:04+00:00,cuc64dk,1.0,t3_3hue38,117103.0,NexusNewbies

2875,"Meta is short for metagame  (also, meta is ancient greek for beyond/past).  So what's the difference between the game and the metagame? 

The game is all the relatively fixed, predictable stuff that doesn't depend on player choices.  How XP progression works, teams being 5 people per side, the way maps work, the way characters can be built and progress as they level.  Unless stuff gets patched, you ought to know all those rules.  The developer make them and with a little bit of experience even just playing vs AI you mostly know the quirks.  

You know chests spawn at 50 sec on blackhearts.  You know Sky temple goes top + mid then bot.  You know tribute locations are random but spawn in a small set of ""random"" spots and happen at a relatively predictable pace and that there's a logic to their location for the first 3.

The metagame is the aspect of a match that is contingent on the players and how they decide to approach the game.  The player base reacts to the game, and comes up with a set of most optimal strategies to deal with the game.  Then, they react to those strategies, ad infinitum.

These optima are variable - what's optimal depends on what other people think is optimal - any meta strategy ought to be countered by some other meta strategy - there is usually no perfect solution for a map/game (except Sylvanas on mines :D).  

This is to say that there's no team composition, set of talent builds, and way of rotating on objectives that is always the best in all situations.  Every strategy ought to be able to be countered (if not, if the meta-game really is totally one note, the developers have a problem with their game).

So how a map works: the game.  What team compositions people like to pick for a given map, and how they like to lane/rotate/play the map = metagame.  Siege giant camp on mines: game.  Don't cap siege till their golem is a bit past their fort so the golems defend from behind your towers on first golem: metagame.

The however large character pool and every character in it plus how their abilities and stats work: game.  The however small character pool of characters which people think are viable, and the however small number of builds/talents for a character which people think are viable: metagame.

""Meta"" can go deeper and deeper.  So jaina has a ""meta"" build, which picks frostbitten (the damage increase on chill) at 7.  In the game, Jaina has multiple talents she can take, in the meta game, it's just that talent.  But then people pick Zeratul (a metagame choice) to kill Jaina, and the meta evolves: now Jaina takes frost armor at 7, as a response to Zeratul's auto-attack focused burst (focused attack, follow through).  Maybe Zeratul anticipates this, so he goes spell build, and takes gathering power + cleave buffs and not auto attack buffs, making frost armor less impactful for jaina by using ability, not auto attack, burst.

Or maybe zeratul gets first picked, so you don't even go Jaina, you go double warrior (some combo with Johanna, Muradin, Arthas, Tyrael, Anubarak) and uther, and now your team has so much cc that every time Zeratul tries to blink/decloak in he gets stun trained, rooted, and blown the F up.  So people stop picking zeratul and switch to strong ranged auto-attackers great at kiting and killing tanks - like valla, falstad, raynor, hammer - or anti-tank bruisers like Leoric or Sonya who resist cc and deal heavy damage to immobile, close in targets.

Maybe a bit rambly but hopefully all that helps illustrate the concept of metagame.",2015-08-22 21:09:50+00:00,cuc5gfb,1.0,t3_3hxx98,54385.0,NexusNewbies

When you're laning alone and worried about nova, just maintain map awareness so you know when she's in other lanes, don't push out too far when you don't know where she is, play near your towers, use minion waves to shield from snipes, and keep stutter stepping to make snipes difficult to land.

5. Depends on the match up.  How necessary is having board presence in order to respond to your opponent's threats?  How does a 3/3 affect their turn, the removal they are likely to have, and the curve they want to follow?  A warrior wants to play war axe or death's bite.  A druid would generally rather develop a minion than consume their turn using wrath.  Vs. hunter you typically want to be able to trade with minions rather than your face so board is important.
