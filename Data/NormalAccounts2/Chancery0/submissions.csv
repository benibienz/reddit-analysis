Xul is a wave clear and ganking hero.  This makes him perfect for ROTATIONS, not soloing.  He doesn't even have sustain until level seven.  Can he solo?  Yes, sure.  So can tons of heroes.

You maximize his trait value by getting skeletons in two lanes, not one.  You maximize his e by using it to gank on rotations with follow up damage, not in a solo lane.  

You will dominate tomb and spider queen by using him to 4 man roam and you will dominate BHB by having him dual soak mid top.

Greymane has some of the strongest ranged poke in the game and his ranged autos, while not falstad/valla/raynor levels, do significant damage.  

His play style complements a melee assassin, it doesn't over crowd it.  When a thrall or zeratul, for example, goes in on a target, greymane can swap from ranged and guarantee the kill, then disengage out back to ranged to avoid the sort of melee punish (chain bomb, mosh pit, arthas, whatever) that a secondary pure melee assassin would suffer from.

He is a ranged carry that complements a heavy melee dive comp, not one that overcrowds it with too many melee-range heroes.",heroesofthestorm,Greymane is not a melee assassin,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4605gy/greymane_is_not_a_melee_assassin/
