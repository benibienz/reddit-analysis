1751,"It was her birthday, a day she had hoped would be spent surrounded by her family. All year long she had spent her every waking hours toiling in the factory; sewing and suturing rows and rivers of string on cloth. Her mind began to fade after awhile and she had forgotten who she was and why she suffered so. But when she asked herself these questions, the answer was always quick to follow. She had a son and a daughter to put through school, and they were all she cared for. It didn't matter what she had to suffer through if it meant her kids never had to go without. But today was her birthday, and when she got home she readied herself a glass of wine. She savoured that glass, and she couldn't help but down another. And another. She felt happy then and remembered her kids; her family.They would be waiting for her at school just like any other day. 4 o'clock PM. She had about twenty minutes to get there. She never did.

2178,"I developed an ED when I was really young, after I realized how fat I was compared to all the other 5th graders my age. I stopped eating lunch at school and would eat small portions of food at home. It was until I reached high school that I started to hate myself and thats when I got into binging and purging. It was after I gained 20 pounds from all the binges that I  started excersizing and restricting more regularly. It wasnt like I wanted an ED though, I just wanted to lose weight. The ED was a hell of a side effect, though.",2015-08-19 01:56:26+00:00,cu7s9m3,1.0,t3_3hir77,4441.0,proED
