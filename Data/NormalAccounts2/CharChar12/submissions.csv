I work after school (doing 30hrs/week) and so I don't get to go home either. I rarely get 6 hours of sleep anymore.

During weekends I worry over college apps &amp; fafsa. I have nobody helping me because no one in my family has ever gone to college.

So for the past 2 months Ive completely lost my urge to eat during the day. Im busy at school in the morning and work in the evening so I have no time to even think about food. (But I do have small meals and snacks when I have time and on my lunch break)

I get home at midnight almost daily and Im usually very tired. I have six hours of sleep while Im home so I try to fall asleep as soon as I can. 

But Ive noticed about an hour after I fall asleep Ill wake up and just ravage any bread or sugary item in the fridge or kitchen. Im not even fully conscious while Im eating either; I feel like Im not myself or like Im just a spectator.

I usually fall asleep immidietly afterwords and when I wake up Im bloated and I feel dizzy and I just hate myself.

She's overweight and she's ALWAYS asking me to help her lose weight. BUT, its the weekend and it seems like shes been binging since breakfast. I want to let her know that this isnt healthy but I dont want to flat out tell her to stop eating. 

Sometimes I think she just WANTS to stay fat.",loseit,How to confront my sister?,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/3ju2ft/how_to_confront_my_sister/

While we where there, the doctor said that I wouldnt have any problems at this weight and she also said I had to eat more protein since my muscles are wasting. 

I ended up NOT having anemia and my cholesterol and blood pressure were normal. But since I was anxious during the visit and since I was apparently very stressed, she said that if I lose any more weight she will recommend me to a phsychiatrist or therapist or what ever it is. I actually dont care if I get sent to one, but its my mom who really thinks I should see one. 

Im pretty shocked but if losing weighr means ""getting help"" then I want to maintain for these two weeks. Problem is whenever I maintain I feel SO SO SO fat and nasty that I feel shitty until I get back on track. I just dont know ugh",proED,I have an issue,http://www.reddit.com/r/proED/comments/3hk1ci/i_have_an_issue/
