165,"&gt; this entire comment thread is the fucking problem how do you NOT SEE THAT

&gt; BURYING YOUR HEADS IN THE SAND about what a LARGE percentage of people with religious beliefs derived from the same place as yours are doing

The comment thread is bad, I didn't deny that. I only stated that because of bad journalism there has been more problems caused by creating a rift between people.

""The thing is the large percentage of people with religious beliefs"" i.e. Muslims that actually study the religion properly, go to the masjid and pray as close to 5x a day as possible know that what is being done out in the middle east by terrorists is not what islam is about. This whole culsterfuck of an issue has been cause by previous countries fighting proxy wars in the whole middle east over control of resources and leaving nothing for the people there except dead families and horrible corruption and crime.

When you get that situation then anyone with a brain can see that it isn't the religion that is causing the issue but the political and geographic problems.

&gt; oh.. it makes me upset to hear about ACTUAL shit radical Islam is doing so i just ignore it

There is no such thing as radical Islam and people like yourself who keep calling it such is just perpetuating this idea that the religion is an issue. 

&gt; do you think most people in germany actively wanted to gas millions of people..? most were just totally fucking content ignoring the brewing catastrophe JUST like you folk are...

Most of the Muslim people that I personally know have been engrossed in refugee/charity work trying to help other people fix their lives in a new area. I bet that if the news had a more even split on positive/negative news stories, instead of spending all their time talking about negativity, we would see a lot more progress instead of seeing more hatred and anger spread.

My team (4 of 14 and 7-5record) -

QB- Bortles, Wilson

RB- Thomas Rawls, Charmander West, Latavius Murray, Eddie Lacy, Robert Turbin

WR- Julio Jones, OBJ, LaFell, Cecil Shorts, Steve Smith Sr. 

TE- Barnidge, Julius Thomas

Kicker- Bailey

Defense- Buffalo

So my dilema is I choose keepers day after the championship game so I will be keeping Julio, OBJ, and either Lacy or Rawls.

This kid (9 of 14 and 6-6 record) offered me a first for Lacy.

Is it too soon to negotiate for Lacy since I haven't fully decided on keeping him or Rawls?

I view Rawls as the better keeper if Lynch walks but I wouldn't have a good bet on that especially since Rawls needs to continue to perform.

Rookie wrs are good but most of them have a bad sophomore slump and having ameer fills your immediate needs more so then having Diggs. 

I personally like Diggs a tad more but he is getting run without guys ahead of him. I think he will drop off a tad so now is the best time to trade him for ameer imo.

What was your plan of action for memorizing surahs? I'm currently trying to memorize surah mulk this Ramadan and it's pretty slow going. 

I am not the best Arabic reader but I'm not bad either, I tend to just brute force listen to mishary recite ayats at a time and once I get the general outline sand it out by reading the Quranic text. 

Do you think that's a good method? It seems slow going to me",2015-06-27 11:45:24+00:00,cskevzp,1.0,t3_3baise,6212.0,islam

And the news is the worst propaganda filled thing ever. The news lies about stories instead of spinning the story to suit them.
