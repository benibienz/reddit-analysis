I pulled this trade since I had Sankey last year and my optimism slowly waned during his tenure on my team. 

I feel that this week 1 game was an outlier due to Mariota throwing 4 TDs and with the RBBC that will develop over there it was a safe bet to offload a 1st (might be a late first) and Sankey for a RB in a young offense where he is the 3-down back.
