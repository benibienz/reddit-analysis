Great song, but the lyrics are definitely off.. 

""Sitting on a park bench
Eyeing little girls
With bad intent
Snot running down his nose
Greasy fingers smearing shabby clothes
Drying in the cold sun
Watching as the frilly panties run
Feeling like a dead duck
Spitting out pieces of his broken luck""",2016-08-24 15:20:03+00:00,d6uqte5,1,t3_4zbmqm,22780,AskReddit

10,"Hey dudes, it's Rich. Glad y'all liked the photos I snapped the other night. 
Figured I'd try and help add to the AMA, so here's a few:
- What was the songwriting process like for this album? How long did the writing phase take? And then the recording?

- How has adding Wes added to or changed the band dynamic, or writing style?

- how do you see the touring cycle(s) for this album playing out?

Stay golden my friends, and see you again soon!",2016-07-28 23:25:18+00:00,d5v5r27,1,t3_4v3i3n,1552,progmetal
