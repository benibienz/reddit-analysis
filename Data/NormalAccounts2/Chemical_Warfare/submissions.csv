Are those caps on the deck replaceable, or should i should get a whole new deck? It's also my first rebuildable, and i like having a tank. Maybe some options/opinions on what i could go to as an upgrade, if replacing the deck is what needs to be done?

Thanks for the help!",electronic_cigarette,Leaking on chimney seal of Kanger RBA deck,https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/4o00xu/leaking_on_chimney_seal_of_kanger_rba_deck/

A friend had his truck stolen from his shop yesterday morning and there is video. The DVR is a Digimerge DH 200+, and the software it dumps on the flash drive is mcdplayer. It's also got an aviconverter as well.
The video is a .d file, and there's an index file as well. (.i)
When I try to convert the video to an AVI it only converts about 5 seconds of the video, not the entire 7~ minutes (which I need).
The mcdplayer software is absolute crap and won't let me seek so I can screencap the split second where the guy looks into the camera.
Can anyone either help me fix the index file, or extract the video from the .d file?
There was 2 channels of video shot, but I only need one channel of it. Any ideas or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.",homesecurity,Need hep with software/conversion,https://www.reddit.com/r/homesecurity/comments/4nh1n0/need_hep_with_softwareconversion/
