18,"Hello @Crypton3! :D
I have been enjoying your game for like months but i still need something like
-Being able to gift other players. By that i Mean only a limited amount per day like 3 times where you coulis send 3-5 skins. That Would be cool
-A new gambling game like Csgodouble.com or csgo2x.com (Basicly roulette) 
-More upgrades at later stages! It doesnt feel rewarding to get to Global elite and Then the only Thing i Can do is tap, roulette and trading. That just doesnt feel rewarding for me.
-Maybe some kind of login feature (NOT GC and GP) because i have a Android tablet and a IPhone.
I Think that was all. Btw. Super awesome game i just thougt i Would leave my problems with the game On the Reddit cause i Saw u Reading comments @crypton3 //CherryTeaaa PCE",2016-02-01 22:09:27+00:00,czk81xw,1,t3_3lstic,11524127,caseclickers
