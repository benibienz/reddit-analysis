6,"[My Steam profile.](http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChibiLawl/)

To me, the most memorable TF2 experience is meeting other people through their interest of this game through various means of communication (s/o to the /r/tf2 Discord!), and listening to people have conversations over the in-game voice chat.

I don't exactly remember the exact way I found this game, but it is one of the first games I had installed on Steam and is the only reason I created a Steam account in the first place. 

I like this game due to it's distinct art style and charming atmosphere. (like it's lore, the way how each of the individual classes communicate to each other, etc.)

I'm not actually sure if the prize is one or more items, but I primarily want the Upgrade to Premium Gift and/or an Strange Rocket Launcher or something like that. I have ~450 hours put into the game.
