I blame the internet. These kids have spent their time reading internet articles that often have click-bait titles. Humans are social creatures, and we take our cues from the world around us. I theorize that they are adjusting their language use to the myriad examples they see everyday. Monkey see, monkey do. 

Otoh, just think how many of us old folks used to say, ""Radical, dude!"" or ""Cool beans!"" or ""Catch you on the flip side."" Maybe there's hope that it's just a phase all young kids go through as they navigate difficult social waters and find themselves. 

Colloquial English will always have a place, but so will formal English, is how I like to think of it.

26,"So you know what you want : lead server or sommelier, non-corporate, fine dining. Why not go talk to some restaurants?

Go tell them, ""Look here, I am a reliable worker who only wants to learn more and improve myself. I am planning a move to NYC and I desire experience to fulfill my dreams. I would work hard to learn from you in that short time. Do you think we could benefit from each other?"" 

Full disclosure, here, I am a cook so my perspective may be a bit skewed. But what if you *did* work something out and went to NYC with a letter of recommendation from fine-dining FoH? That would be pretty sweet. 

I want you to at least think about how interviewing at non-corporate, fine-dining restaurants in *your* town will be excellent practice for interviewing at non-corporate, fine-dining restaurants in NYC.

Life's too short to be unhappy, is what I usually say. But this is harder because you're leaving in a short time. Different restaurant experience could help your job prospects in NYC, but longer-term employment does look good on paper.

36,"+1 for don't let his rage infect you. There's a couple options, here. 

1) Kill him with kindness :  Treat everything he bitches about as a serious request for change or action, and act thrilled to help him out. Mention how his observations will make others' lives easier. ""Oh, good point, I can think of a way to fix this that benefits the whole team!"" 

2) That's nice dear : Acknowledge his bitching without getting upset and then change the subject. ""Oh, yeah, probably... Hey, I think we can put this food out now, let's go table 5."" (Related to the Cesar Milan : use your innate authority and ""the look"" to redirect bitching into action. Note : Moms excel at this one. Study them.)

3) Overly-positive kindergarten teacher : Gently suggest that he behave otherwise. Use phrases like""86 badditude, please"" and express things as if you were teaching a four-year-old not to hit. ""We don't throw plates at the dishwasher. Here, we respect others to ensure they do their best. Teamwork makes the dream work!""

4) Hulkmania : If he bitches then immediately shut that shit down with your own louder and angrier bitching, yelling at him to stfu, and calling him names. Stab him if you have to.

5) Best friends: Get him to tell you his life story. Junkies love talking about themselves. Plus it'll be a wild ride of embellishment and hardship, so it's kind of interesting, at least.

Really I think the best course of action is just keep on doing your thing, try not to let it affect you too much, and realize that others do not appreciate him.

59,"Winston knew the man by sight, though he knew no more about him than that he held some important post in the Fiction Department. He was a man of about thirty, with a muscular throat and a large, mobile mouth. His head was thrown back a little, and because of the angle at which he was sitting, his spectacles caught the light and presented to Winston two blank discs instead of eyes. 

What was slightly horrible, was that from the stream of sound that poured out of his mouth it was almost impossible to distinguish a single word. Just once Winston caught a phrase -'complete and final elimination of Goldsteinism'- jerked out very rapidly and, as it seemed, all in one piece, like a line of type cast solid. For the rest it was just a noise, a quack-quack-quacking. And yet, though you could not actually hear what the man was saying, you could not be in any doubt about its general nature. 

He might be denouncing Goldstein and demanding sterner measures against thought-criminals and saboteurs, he might be fulminating against the atrocities of the Eurasian army, he might be praising Big Brother or the heroes on the Malabar front -- it made no difference. Whatever it was, you could be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy, pure Ingsoc. 

As he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up and down, Winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being but some kind of dummy. 

It was not the man's brain that was speaking, it was his larynx. The stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words, but it was not speech in the true sense: it was a noise uttered in unconsciousness, like the quacking of a duck.

80,"Update the Third: 

Yesterday's adventures yielded two messages, both italic phrases listed on the wiki and both followed by ""was that a wriggling sound?"" small text.

1st instance (Spookyraven Manor - bedroom) after 142 turns and 2nd (ducks post-war) after 123 subsequent turns. 

Anecdotal evidence follows: 

I could swear I get message instances more often when I'm fighting spooky monsters. Yesterday I was finishing up the Nemesis quest (aftercore)... tying up loose ends before (hopefully) something exciting happens. 

Day before I was running Stephen quest in Spookyraven Manor and I really want to say it was about 75 turns per message instance. I was also running a higher spooky resistance. 

Also, full disclosure here, the reason I paid 5mil for the book is because I was trying to put and extra t in eldritch. Eldritch, not eldtritch. I never even saw the difference, not even after reading so many useful comments here by /u/EldritchCarver. Like when you don't notice the the extra 'the' in a sentence. Yeah. I search mall good, and do other stuff good too. 

I , ChickenDinero, claim this quest (edit: and/or the 1mil penalty) as grammar penance. Eldritch. That is all. For now. ",2016-10-28 09:56:17+00:00,d9b86ij,1.0,t3_592wzj,362151.0,kol

And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. 

At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms;
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. 

And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon’s mouth. 

And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lin’d,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slipper’d pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well sav’d, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound.

That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion;

Maybe? If not, you can always put some regular cane sugar in a coffee grinder and grind it finer. Idk that it makes it closer to rum, maybe if you caramelized it... 

Yep, that trick works. Evaporation! Did you know your fridge is also a dehydrator? Science!!

That sounds weird. Why not keep the lime zest then add it directly to the daiquiri? Or maybe make lime zest sugar (just mix them together) and use that to sugar the rims?

Yes, definitely zest the limes!

Seems legit. Why not thinly slice some strawberries, freeze them, and use those for garnish? Maybe even dip them in sugar and then lime zest and then freeze. Fancy!

Dammit, Jim; I'm a cook, not a mixologist. I wouldn't worry about trying to duplicate the rum flavor; if you do then that page seems like a fine guide.

Don't be a wanker.

Personal preference. I like mine to go in the blender, no straining. Perhaps straining would be better for a shaken daiquiri. 

Uh... you mean like if there's people who are anti-alcohol there? Vanilla extract is like 40% booze. Enough extract to be a component (not a garnish) would probably make it taste gross. Maybe add a tiny dash at the end so they think of it as a garnish... because nobody's getting wasted off 1/8 teaspoon of vanilla extract.

417,"Chefs will work you as hard as you allow them to work you. Yes, you're young and this is a great time to put in massive hours and learn technique. And I hear the part about cooking pulling you out of some bad stuff. 

But it's also a great time to create habits that you'll carry with you for the rest of your career. Proper lifting and correct posture make a hell of a difference when you add it up over 20 years. So does making time to grow as a person *outside* of the kitchen. Man does not live by bread alone and all that. Make time for your SO, even if it's just one night a week. Hell, make time for *you* once a week. 

Maybe ask your chef for a regular day or night off. An agreed-upon time where you are unavailable. Say what you said here; that cooking is important to you and you love it, but you need to dial it back just a little bit so that you can *continue* to cook. You want to run the marathon, not the 50-yard dash! Having a day of rest is essential to continued survival. Dedication and drive are admirable qualities, but exhausted cooks make more mistakes. 

I'll echo what some people are saying here; 50 hours is not a lot. But do you really want to wake up 30 years old someday, with sore knees, alone, wondering who you are when you're not at work? Scary thought, that.

Your comment gave me some minor culture shock, lol. Square dancing has always just been around me (county fairs, church camps, old folks homes, even at Folklife Festival) so knowing someone had to Google it is... strange. Just so you know, and ysk that this is why I love Reddit; for moments like this. 

So I went and found a few videos because the link you saw was, frankly, boring (no offense to you). If a caller like that ever got up at a county fair the white-hairs would boo him off the stage! 

[School square dancing is so embarrassing](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CSDAWhFRDEk) This one is for proof that they do make us square dance in school. Music's terrible, and I'm pretty sure nobody is having fun.

[Apologies for ad. Excellent music, caller, and dancers](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=I4lxfXltCxQ). This is a great example of how much fun it should be to watch because you can see how the patterns start to show. Also, you can see one of the guys lead his gal too far around the circle at one point, but it all works out. 

[Skip to 1:04](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=S3sy4r_EfeY) This is what a room full of square dancers looks like. The angle isn't the best, but it gives you a bit of an idea what the patterns look like on a larger scale.

Ever see one of those piles of logs in a river? Search and Rescue people call those things ""strainers."" Because that's where the people get pinned underwater, and where their bodies are found later. 

Fun fact! One pint of water (2 cups or 16 fluid ounces, or .47 litres for those across the pond) weighs one pound.

It's like losing faith in god. Or finding out that the SO you loved and sacrificed for was cheating on you *and* laughing with friends about how stupid you are.

That we have just chased the ball for forty years and it was all a joke on us? We hope that catching that ball and returning it brings us something more than tangible rewards... and they say it will.... but it was all a lie to get us to chase.

Might one in this situation not seek for true meaning in life? How would one even go about it? What *is* meaning in life besides the awarding of badges and comparing your set to your neighbor's?

How does one adequately convey that the written word has power, and that the meta-meanings of connotation extend all the way back to when most people spoke Latin? That writing anything is claiming a heritage that extends back thousands of years? That writing precisely is necessary for clear communication, and more?

How else are we to be lulled into agreement with an author? To take their hand willingly and be drawn into their world completely, basking in the rhythym of their words as they wash around us? The stark beauty of text demands thoughtful choice: stripped of voice and facial cues, the myriad words we select from to convey our meaning speak volumes.

Yes, changing one's mind is a good sign. I am proud of Hilary for changing her stance on gay marriage. I do believe there is a difference between changing one's mind (thought one way, now thinks another) and flip-flopping (goes back and forth to garner support). I don't think Hilary flip-flopped on that issue, I think she changed her mind. If Bernie doesn't win the nomination I will probably support Hilary. 

However, I mainly see this election as a way for the American people to feel enfranchised again. The Bush/Gore election outcome was a slap in the face, and then the banks got bailed out after swindling the general population, and now more people are struggling than ever, and the people with no money get told to work harder. And before you say I'm just repeating Reddit, no, I was furious when the electoral college overturned the popular vote. My S and BIL lost their house shortly after buying it. I make minimum wage and the best thing that has happened recently is my insurance not being tied to my job and the sick/safe time laws (I can accrue paid sick leave so I don't have to work foodservice while running a fever or barfing).

It's a chance to support someone who seems to be exactly who they say they are, which is what I've always wanted from a politician. I want to vote for them based on their beliefs (not religious, but as evidenced by their voting record). I want to know who I'm electing president, and have a general idea of what they will do (based on how they have behaved in the past).

740,"Oh, man, it has helped so much! Life is 100% better.

No thoughts of suicide since I started, or hating myself or feeling worthless. I now have insecurities instead of a litany of hate and people I've disappointed in my head. Does that makes sense? Like, this is how normal people must feel - slightly apprehensive or disappointed but seeing it through rather than crushing self-hate that leads to inaction. I also now have time to consider how I feel before reacting instead of reacting immediately. 

I had some side effects the first 3 days, strange but not alarming. Day 1: felt mushy-headed, still functioned just fine except for almost crossing the street against the light once. Day 2-3: very euphoric, but not manic. Felt like a good, clean hit of Molly (I lived fast in my 20s, I only do legal drugs now). That leveled out and now I just live. I can still feel feelings, the negative ones have become much less intense and I am not troubled (feels like this won't last!) when I am happy. 

Other than that, the only thing I've noticed is that I now have a harder time telling how high up in the sky seagulls are. OTOH, we have two sizes of seagulls here (monster movie and normal) so that could be what's tripping me up. :)

744,"So there's a church that has a men's group for improving the relationship with your wife. The pastor introduces the night's topic: married sex life. 

He says, 'Okay, men, today we'll start the discussion with how frequently you and your wife have sex. All of you who have sex once a week, raise your hands.' And so about half of the men raise their hands. 

He says, 'Okay, great. Now those of you who have sex once a month, raise your hands.' And about a quarter of the group raises their hands.

The pastor notices that some of the group has not put up their hands yet, so he says, 'Okay, now what about every other month?' And the remainder of the group, except for one guy, raises their hands.

Not wanting to exclude anyone from the discussion, the pastor says, 'Once every six months?' Guy doesn't raise his hand. Pastor says, 'Once a year?,' in disbelief. 

The guy jumps out of his seat, puts his hand in the air, and excitedly shouts, 'ME!'

The pastor says, 'I don't understand, why are you so happy about this?'

Otherwise, it's hard to explain to people if they haven't felt that same urgency themselves. You're not angry, or trying to bark orders, or talk down; you're being *efficient.* It sounds intimidating until it clicks, and then it becomes the best way to communicate as a team. 

I found it helpful to give these people the expo (position where they call the tickets and manage times) and then mimic their calling style (to a point, of course). Maybe you could compromise and incorporate a please into your requests (idk if there's actually time for this in your job)

Or sometimes what worked was just running through practice calls and then having them take the lead and see that you respond to calls the same way. This can help with the talking down feeling. Timed runs are good for this... Tick, tick!

'Chauvinist' originally meant exaggerated patriotism and belligerent view in your nation's superiority, after Nicolas Chauvin. 'Chauvinism' later came to mean fanatical devotion to a group/cause with a strong connotation of hostility towards outsiders (like the KKK, or record store employees)

And then! And then after years of feminists using {SEE BELOW PLS} the term 'male chauvinist pig,' the word chauvinism came to mean shorthand for male chauvinism, and here we are today. 

(or at least being portrayed but the media to be using,... but I digress.

Yes, young people are awkward as fuck, especially teenagers. But just like bravery means going on in spite of your fear, it also means going on in spite of your awkwardness. It'll be okay, and the more you practice being you the easier it gets. Don't waste time being afraid!

It means believe that you are beautiful. Young people are all so beautiful (not in a pedo way, I mean like butterflies). You are all overflowing with possibilities and so young and strong. Young people are beautiful by virtue of being young, please believe in your beauty. 

You won't realize it for another twenty years. It is a strange thing to look at photos of teenaged me and remember how I felt at the time. I don't see the same thing in the mirror that I used to (I remember how I looked to myself back then and it is *not at all* what I see now looking at pictures). 

It means, dammit, use your body before it starts getting all achy. Train it to do something, like yoga or weightlifting or running or dancing. Become strong and coordinated while you're still young and can move effortlessly. 

It means that old people regret not asking that guy or girl out, or not knowing that it would have been a comforting thing to do to hold that girl's hair while she puked, or not standing up for your friend that one time, or not telling that random jerk to go shove it. Truly it is the things I have not done that I regret more than the things that I have done.

And, yes, do something crazy (don't go hurting other people, not that kind of crazy). Dye your hair pink and dress weird - you can get away with it because people expect that of teenagers - learn to use their expectations to your advantage. Go to a rock and roll show! Ask that cutie on a date, or is that too crazy? :)

I mean, the internet pretty much revolutionized genealogy because of immediate access to information over long distances. They used to do that sort of research *in person,* can you imagine? 

Today, I take out my phone and look it up. Even if it takes me a few tries, whatevs, it took maybe 5 minutes. 

In 1987, it went more like this:  Get mom to drive you to library. Go to card catalog. Read Dewey Decimal System chart. Open card catalog drawer, peruse relevant DDS section. Copy with too-short library pencil the DDS #s onto a slip of paper. Navigate library shelves. If books do not precisely what you seek, write down possible candidates from hopefully useful bibliography. Return to card catalog, repeat. Make sure to ask the librarian if any books that seem checked out might in fact be waiting to be shelved (very important!)

Hopefully during your search you are presented with a number that means you get to go down and use the microfiche machines, which are pretty cool but there's a lot of rules that go with them, sigh. 

Got all your sources? Great! Time to sit down and page through your books. Mark the pages where you want copies, and check out the rest. Don't forget to fill out the check-out card! Did anyone you know check it out before you? Their name will be printed on the card in their own pencil handwriting, cool! Fill out your name, and oh yeah, the date. Take your books to the librarian at the desk and make copies (10¢/pg) while the librarian files your check-out cards and puts temporary slips into your (for two weeks) books. 

I promise you that once you get home and start working on your project you will discover that you needed a book you looked at but decided not to check out. Oh no! You threw away your slip of paper with all the numbers?! Why would you do that!? You were there for like three hours! Game over, man, game over. :(

Return to Step 1, repeat. :(

1077,"It takes about 5 months for a chicken's adult feathers to come in. Waiting for this and the start crowing or egg laying is the only 100% method. If your chickens are sex-linked or of a breed that can be feather-sexed then it's easy to tell, but not all chicks are like this. 

Things I have personally noticed: 

Roosters will have a larger comb from the very beginning. It will be very obvious at around 2-3 weeks. I can spot roosters fairly easily now after 3 rounds of the same breed (Marans). This might not work for other breeds!

The roosters are also (usually) the ones standing up to flap their wings. The roos will challenge each other (the staredown, head bobbing). This is not 100% because the hens are fitting themselves into the pecking order as well, and will defend if challenged, but a few days observation is enough to find patterns. 

Thicker legs is a dead giveaway, but again, some chickens have fatter legs than others so that's not 100% either. 

Sometimes (at around 3 months) you can tell by the feathers, if they are developed enough. Roos will have longer tails that curl over at the top, their neck feathers will be pointed (hens have blunt neck feathers), and their saddle feathers will also be pointier and longer then the hens'.

Good luck!

Tl;Dr: You can't tell for sure until around 5 months, but there are some clues you can use to guess.
