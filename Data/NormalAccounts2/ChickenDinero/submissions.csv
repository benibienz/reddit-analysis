2) Count Drunkula : Is it possible for a lvl21 DB to kill him? It's a one-kiss difficulty (because I'm killing time until Crimbo, and also because I'm running Dreadsylvania alone). Would being only 24/19 drunk be enough to kill him?

Bought the book using almost all my meat. Used the book. Had fun fighting tentacles. 

Then the damn flaregun announcement came in the middle of the day AND someone bought all my flareguns from the mall. I would have had just enough flareguns to get the item but now that'll never happen. Damn! 

So. I'm butthurt that I can't get the item, and also ticked that I didn't pull flareguns from the mall in time, and ticked off because I can't sell extra flareguns for highly profitable prices. 

What I cant figure out is *why* I'm so ticked. It's just a game, man, chillax!

I often find that finding a name for these sorts of mental glitches and reading other peoples' experiences in similar situations helps immensely. And I know there's a lot of smart people here.

Surely there is a name for this sort of glitch-out and surely there are persons who have suffered greater disappointments in KoL. Help?

Drank some cranberry juice and raged for two days. Almost walked out on bf. Was how I felt before starting Lexapro (angry, world hates me, can never improve situation or self).

Feeling fine today, but wondering if anyone else out there has experienced something similar. Can find lots of info about grapefruit interaction, but none on cranberry. 

If it's not the cranberry juice, could it be PMS? It is right time. Haven't had a bad month since I started... what gives? I'm pretty sure it wasn't the tikka masala...

If/when this (feeling like you did before starting meds) happens to you what is usually the cause? Fairly new to meds (this is my 1st) so probably unaware of several important points. 

Stories please?
