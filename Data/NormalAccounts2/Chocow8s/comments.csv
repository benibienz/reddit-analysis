This sounds really interesting, thanks for posting here. Definitely keeping an eye on this. Part of me's a little wary that the reality of the game might not live up to the language from your post(s), though. Certainly hypes up the reader.

&gt;Of course, these are all interconnected. Maybe you saved up enough money for an old ice hauler and you've been mining ice in the rings of Saturn in the Sol system and you come back and via Spacebook you check in for the first time at The Little Mermaid, an inn at the KÃ¸benhavn station. Little do you know that you've left your Spacebook feed public and a bounty hunter sees that check in. They claimed a contract taken out on you because you betrayed an NPC in a mission you were hired for last week and you've accidentally told them where you are.

I'm really curious about this part. Are any of these events procedurally generated, and will more than one player end up experiencing the same things, or will they feel unique enough per player? How does this work exactly?",2016-11-20 00:44:12+00:00,da7lqne,1.0,t3_5dubae,15923.0,GirlGamers

27,"I tend to always pick a male character first, mostly 'cause I find them attractive (straight cis woman here). For MMOs, this serves a dual purpose and lets me be more invisible, if that makes sense. I do mix it up in MMOs though, but my first characters have always been male so far.

The only exception for me so far in single player games where you can choose your sex is in Mass Effect, and I'm really glad I went with FemShep there rather than MaleShep. Absolutely adore FemShep. =D

**Edit:** So...just clarifying, since I'm afraid people might be reading stuff into this reply different from what I intended because I suck at phrasing, I meant this for games that let me pick the protag's sex and let me customize, so mostly MMOs and Bioware games for me so far. My male characters in these games tend to be dark skinned, lean/slender, and dressed in ways I personally find attractive (often in tasteful, revealing clothing preferably, but the revealing part is tricky. Clothing options are often terrible for men, especially when I'm going for something I find sexy.) 

I'm mostly ""eh"" on a lot of the male protags in SP games, because they very rarely do anything for me. But if they're the only option in an SP game I want to play and experience, then what can I do. The standout exception to this that I've experienced is Geralt from Witcher 3, I really feel like they took the female gaze into account a bit for that game.",2016-11-10 21:09:47+00:00,d9uw0y1,1.0,t3_5ca3l1,2878.0,GirlGamers

34,"Yennnnn. Admittedly not much of a Witcher fan in general, but I thought Witcher 3 was freaking amazing and Yennefer broke my heart. There's a tragic air about her that I absolutely adored, and I loved how unapologetic she was about going after what she needed, and willingly bore the brunt of being shunned as a villain afterwards. As a character, she felt very well-crafted for me. I have such mixed feelings about Triss in general, tbh. I had poor impressions of her when I tried playing Witcher 1 way back when, and she didn't really seem to fit Geralt much for me in Witcher 3.

36,"&gt;I mean, I know I could just start to post more stuff on here as well in general (and I want to)

I think this is probably the way to go. There's an assumption that since it's a woman-defined space about gaming, then it's ""women-only issues about gaming"" instead of ""gaming + women gamer-centric issues welcome,"" but it's rather easy to forget that. There are many spaces about discussing games in general after all, and very few about discussing games and gender issues in particular. (I also don't think we have *that* many threads about gender issues tbh, unless you count the LFG ones, but I could be wrong. It might just seem so compared to other subs.)

On a related note, harassment and how to curtail it is sadly a common theme in women-defined spaces. There was an interesting thing I observed a few months back wherein a popular thread that hit the front page asked guys what's in their ""bro code,"" which led to someone asking in a non-default woman-specific subreddit I'm subbed to what girls have for their ""girl code."" The differences were striking, in that a lot of what women posted in the girl code were related to safety and helping other women from certain situations.

1. Regarding drops, does it matter in which order you kill the monsters first? If I'm trying to farm a specific monster from a lineup of four, does killing the one I need first give it first chance at dropping an egg before the others, for example?

2. Why do people recommend an all-green team for G/D Bastet, when her lead skill doesn't benefit a specific attribute? Her active gives a slight advantage to Wood Att, but it looks pretty underwhelming.

3. On average, how often do Non-IAP players get to acquire magic stones after getting as many as they can by finishing dungeons?

4. How rare are Tamadras? I have a handful from the free daily ones and I'm tempted to use most of them on all of G/D Bastet's awakening skills, is that a good idea?

325,"Damn, reading this almost made me cry. Thanks for sharing! The whole thing's worth reading from start to finish, but this portion stood out for me:

&gt;*And maybe this begins to explain the sorcery of Hamilton: It is new and it is familiar all at once. You know these characters and donât know them at all. You know the story and donât know it at all. I canât remember anything quite like that. When the second act begins, Aaron Burr introduces Thomas Jefferson (âYou havenât met him yet, you havenât had the chance/âcause heâs been kickingâ ass as the ambassador to France), and then Daveed Diggsâ Thomas Jefferson rolls out wearing a glorious purple suit, looking for all the world like a revolutionary version of Prince â¦*

&gt;*â¦ and itâs JUST RIGHT. Do you know what I mean? You might be aware that Thomas Jefferson really didnât look like Prince and he wasnât much of a hip hop performer. He was a Virginia slaveowner. But by the time the second act begins, no, this is Thomas Jefferson. It feels exactly right. This is the closest experience Iâve ever had to that feeling inside a dream. You know: In the dream, you are talking with your best friend only heâs actually a grizzly bear wearing a stethoscope, and youâre inside a car thatâs not exactly a car and youâre parked inside the Taj Mahal but itâs orange and looks a bit like old Shea Stadium â¦ and none of it seems out of place. None of it seems unfamiliar. It doesnât just make perfect sense, it feels perfect. There are goosebumps detonating because, my God, look, thatâs Thomas Jefferson.*",2016-05-30 09:30:25+00:00,d3oznbc,1.0,t3_4lnm5p,23284.0,hamiltonmusical

It's also possible he's worried the games will take too much of your time, which is another legit danger in a relationship. I'm sure you already know, but games can be highly addicting, especially to obsessive personalities, and MMOs in particular are often designed to keep you constantly grinding for something for months on end. 

If it really is purely financial, having at least one and saving up again over time without sacrificing anything crucial (including money for the future, in case one of you gets sick, etc.) could help show that it's perfectly doable to have both.

389,"I played DA2 pretty late as well, and despite its faults, I enjoyed it a great deal. The repetitive map designs and textures + the way the ending played out were the most bothersome for me, but everything else I found rather fun. My male Hawke romanced Anders, kind of wish I'd spoiled myself a little before going that route, but I thought the first half of it was adorable. Was rather sad that Aveline wasn't even an option, but I had a few laughs regarding her romance quest.

My Hawke was a mage, kept trying to play middle ground and was just generally ""leave me alone and don't be dicks to each other ffs"" until the game made me choose, then I sided with the mages. I thought the game was pretty interesting, especially coming from DA:O, which was so grand in scale. I like the thought of zooming into the center of a boiling pot, ready to explode, but the experience was really lacking in certain areas. Really felt like they wanted to do a lot with the game but ran out of time. Still pretty fun, though.",2016-05-11 14:42:28+00:00,d31c110,1.0,t3_4iv0ul,2621.0,GirlGamers

Do you mean Oakwood or the Manila Peninsula? I'm not so clear on the Manila Peninsula one, but from what I can remember of Oakwood, he and the other Magdalo soldiers were knee-deep in a lot of the effects of government corruption on the military side and wanted to both draw attention to it and protest Arroyo's presidency. In the investigative hearings that followed, they were citing things like Arroyo bribing military higher-ups for their support, dumping a lot of funds in the military that got pocketed by superiors and never reached your average soldier. The soldiers out in the field barely had any bullets, and they were being sent down south to fight.

Another thing they protested was the war with Mindanao itself. One thing that really sticks to me is one of the Magdalo soldiers trying to explain why they didn't want to fight the rebels in Mindanao, not due to cowardice, but because these people they were being sent to kill were normal citizensâfarmers, workers, people who had no other recourse but to join the rebels because their local governments had abandoned them. ""Mas makapal pa ang kalyo sa paa kaysa sa 'min,"" is a phrase I remember. 

I can also still remember how damn impressed I was with how organized, disciplined, and peaceful the actual Oakwood event was, despite most of these men carrying firearms.

Instead, they have their moments in the spotlight and have some of the best songs in the entire musical. There's so much about ""Burn"" that's genius, it even feels like a meta song. I do feel a little iffy on a few things though (I think Angelica was somewhat reduced with some of LMM's creative choices), but they're minor quibbles overall.

&gt;Yes, I give personal critiques if you email me at submit@proko.com. Because of a high volume of requests, right now Iâm only critiquing students signed up to my Premium Courses.

&gt;If youâre looking for quick feedback I recommend posting your work in one of the Facebook Groups.

Proko's a young instructor from Watts Atelier, and his lessons have assignments and critique videos on his premium site. [Here's his Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/ProkoTV/videos). He might be a very good fit for what you need. I love his gesture videos the most.

For info and training that's animation-specific, I highly suggest [Aaron Blaise](https://www.youtube.com/user/AaronBlaiseArt/videos). Unfortunately, no assignments/critique included, but he's a former Disney animator with an amazing body of work, transitioned from traditional to digital, and has a wonderful introductory course to the human figure and a lengthy animation course on his site that's pretty affordable. 

New Masters Academy is definitely worth looking into, with teachers like Glenn Vilppu, Karl Gnass, etc. You'll get the most value from it at intermediate level, I think. Not all video lessons give assignments as well, IIRC.

520,"TBH, I liked your initial comment as it was introspective and seemed like a good reflection of how some of the men I know react when they hear feminist issues about the things they like. Especially my dad. 

I personally think there are feminists (and people who go for feminist ideals but for some reason absolutely refuses to be labeled as such) who need to pull back, calm down, and *listen* sometimes, including me on occasion. Especially on how to treat allies, and how to talk to and about people that are actually making an effort to do better, even if they might not get it right the first few times. Lurking in /r/MensLib has taught me how to do that a bit (and getting older, heh), and often reminds me that tackling feminist issues should encompass all genders, that there are people trying to navigate the same cesspool of modern gender biases that are getting hurt by feminist conversations that don't include them or don't take them into account. I think we all could do better.

I do disagree with quite a lot of what you said after, because I think there is simply no way to talk about certain feminist issues without people getting hurt. We're not fighting against people, we're fighting ingrained patterns of behavior, oftentimes within ourselves, shitty things we were taught while growing up and from our parents and from the people who were both kind and cruel to us, and to point it out bluntly to others is going to make a ton of people who haven't given it as much introspection defensive and dismissive. I don't think any amount of careful wording can avoid that in certain topics. Quite a lot of feminist conversations understandably have an amount of anger to them since the issues are so personal, and most of the dialogue occurs ""off the cuff"" when something shitty happens recently and people want to say ""knock it off."" But I do think opening oneself up to other perspectives and thoughtful phrasing can avoid harmful exclusion and makes for more constructive dialogue. But this is another thing to learn on top of a lot of other things we need to learn about each other as a society, and not everyone's gonna be opening the door to that classroom.

But IMO, there's a difference between ""buff manly-men"" as the previous commenter put it designed to appeal to male power fantasies and those designed to appeal to the female gaze. Quite a lot of it has to do with framing. I think Witcher 3's HoT DLC romance is one of the most amazing examples of recent years. The whole wedding portion was like an adorable romance novel, and the very simple inclusion of a specific moment during the sex scene was very female gaze-y (when Geralt was descending for a kiss).

616,"I know what you mean. Took me a while to get into the game as well, but you do get used to Geralt's voice after a while and it stops being hilarious. 

The main thing I can recommend is after clearing White Orchard, generally stick with the main quest until well into Novigrad, then save your exploring 'til then. It'll give you the tools, levels, skill points, etc. you need to make exploring more fun. [Here is a list of quests that can fail if not done on time](https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/3e5s1h/is_isle_of_mists_the_point_of_no_return_for/ctbrqgm), refer to it now and then. Areas contain both high level and low level mobs, so don't hesitate to just run past them if they're way past your current level.

The movement...yeah. You just learn to roll with after x hours of play. It was the most annoying thing about the game for me. 

Two other minor things that have helped: during combat, roll (spacebar), don't dodge. Dodge consumes stamina, and you want that saved up for spells until you unlock more combat builds/options via skills. And equipping the Counterattack skill (hit after a counter is an instant critical) makes fistfights much easier.

749,"I would really like to know as well, as last I heard he seemed pretty excited over the new IP he'd been shifted away from DA for. 

And I agree, he has said some of the most remarkable and inspiring things throughout the years. Who can forget his reply to someone's forum post about Dragon Age apparently not catering enough to the ""straight male gamer"" demographic, way back in 2011:

&gt;*The romances in the game are not for ""the straight male gamer"". They're for everyone. We have a lot of fans, many of whom are neither straight nor male, and they deserve no less attention. We have good numbers, after all, on the number of people who actually used similar sorts of content in DAO and thus don't need to resort to anecdotal evidence to support our idea that their numbers are not insignificant... and that's ignoring the idea that they don't have just as much right to play the kind of game they wish as anyone else. The ""rights"" of anyone with regards to a game are murky at best, but anyone who takes that stance must apply it equally to both the minority as well as the majority. The majority has no inherent ""right"" to get more options than anyone else.*

&gt;*More than that, I would question anyone deciding they speak for ""the straight male gamer"" just as much as someone claiming they speak for ""all RPG fans"", ""all female fans"" or even ""all gay fans"". You don't. If you wish to express your personal desires, then do so. I have no doubt that any opinion expressed on these forums is shared by many others, but since none of them have elected a spokesperson you're better off not trying to be one. If your attempt is to convince BioWare developers, I can tell you that you do in fact make your opinion less convincing by doing so.*

&gt;*And if there is any doubt why such an opinion might be met with hostility, it has to do with privilege. You can write it off as ""political correctness"" if you wish, but the truth is that privilege always lies with the majority. They're so used to being catered to that they see the lack of catering as an imbalance. They don't see anything wrong with having things set up to suit them, what's everyone's fuss all about? That's the way it should be, any everyone else should be used to not getting what they want.*

&gt;*The truth is that making a romance available for both genders is far less costly than creating an entirely new one. Does it create some issues of implementation? Sure-- but anything you try on this front is going to have its issues, and inevitably you'll always leave someone out in the cold. In this case, are all straight males left out in the cold? Not at all. There are romances available for them just the same as anyone else. Not all straight males require that their content be exclusive, after all, and you can see that even on this thread.*

&gt;*Would I do it again? I don't know. I doubt I would have Anders make the first move again-- at the time, I thought that requiring all romances to have Hawke initiate everything was the unrealistic part. Even if someone decides that this makes everyone ""unrealistically"" bisexual, however, or they can't handle the idea that the character might be bisexual if they were another PC... I don't see that as a big concern, to be honest. Romances are never one-size-fits-all, and even for those who don't mind the sexuality issue there's no guarantee they'll find a character they even want to romance. That's why romances are optional content. It's such a personal issue that we'll never be able to please everyone. The very best we can do is give everyone a little bit of choice, and that's what we tried here.*

&gt;*And the person who says that the only way to please them is to restrict options for others is, if you ask me, the one who deserves it least. And that's my opinion, expressed as politely as possible.* 

He also had this insightful post on including women writers in writing teams, but I can't find the original post anymore. 

I'll be keeping an eye on any other project he gets involved in, but for now, the fact he's no longer working in Bioware feels like such a big loss to me. Inquisition's still fresh on my mind, its characters and dialogue are some of the richest I've ever encountered in *any* game, and he had a great deal to do with that.",2016-01-23 04:59:53+00:00,cz8nrpv,2.0,t1_cz8eclh,18411.0,GirlGamers

Because skepticism is reasonable and to be expected, but sheer vitriol isn't. I really wouldn't call some of the reactions I've read online as just skepticism. It's all knee-jerk talk at this point, and you just know mixed in there are other reasons for not wanting it to exist that have nothing to do with making good films.

877,"&gt;*The problem is that when it gets highjacked by the folks that cut together that video. The way I described it is like, if you made a movie just about a movie that the hardships the characters face, but never show how they overcame them, that would be a pretty weird little film. Thatâs kind of what that video is. Because it kind of took the essence of what it was about which was âHey, this is why we moved the battle, I didnât know what I was doing with the battle,â which is true. They took that and in terms of the media, turned it into âWell, that was his opinion of the whole movieâ which is not true.*

&gt;*I didnât expect people to take our work, manipulate it out of context, and use it sort of in a salacious kind of, sensationalist way to support their opinion. âI donât like the movie, so Iâm going to take what I can from this and create a sound byte and use it support my opinion.â  I hope that this doesnât make (other filmmakers) gun-shy from being open with the public because you can see why it would. â¦Whereas if you do watch the show, you can see, oh my god, this is really cool what happened. Look what they are up against, look what they did, look at the steps they took, and hereâs where they ended up. Now, whether you like the movie or not, thatâs another story. Thatâs a subjective story.*

976,"So this reply turned into a bit of a messy rant, and I apologize in advance.

It really doesn't help that a lot of art teachers/instructors feel comfortable teaching and enforcing this disparity of portrayals to others. Access to quality art education with minimal sexist leanings is surprisingly elusive. 

One of my old teachers even said he felt obligated to make his women ""sexy and beautiful,"" while feeling more free to experiment with men, especially with facial expressions and body shapes; and that he really wasn't sure why, ""it's just how it is."" 

I'll also never [forget encountering](http://reelgirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/menbodyshapes.jpg) these [two pages](http://reelgirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/femalebodyshapes.jpg) from artist Christopher Hart. Felt like a punch in the gut at the time.

It's so normal that artists write books on how2beautifulWoman as if it was just one standard and can just outright say stuff like ""don't give her cankles!"" and no one bats an eye.

This sort of stuff needs to be unlearned though, because it's so common that the majority of us grow up with this as normal, and have had no need to question it. Including me, for quite a long time. 

I don't often rant, but this specific issue honestly bothers the hell out of me. I feel like the whole rugged-male-power-fantasy and objectified-women-in-impractical-armor is a subset of an overarching problem in the art world.

You could try starting with [Beastie Bay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.kairosoft.android.mujin_en), and if you find you like that, look into their other English-translated games.

There's also [Alpha Bear](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spryfox.alphabear), made by Spry Fox, a pretty awesome indie studio. I love playing this, but the game does limit you to just a few turns per day.

There's also [Seabeard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.backflipstudios.seabeard&amp;hl=en), which is like a simplified Animal Crossing. There's quite a lot to do per day and a bunch of areas to unlock, but I find the daily grind's catching up to me now that the world's so large.

1038,"Your enthusiasm was what made me check it out in the first place, and there's really no denying that the game looks incredible, especially for an indie production. But from what I can see of the game right now, I'm sure you can understand my skepticism in terms of how it frames women. 

And I hear you on all the things you're describing, a lot of women want that, too, including me. I believe that's actually the ideal that a lot of women gamers want. But when the artwork, designs, and promotional material feel more objectifying versus empowering, I have to take things with a grain of salt. I'm very much open to changing my mind, it sounds like there's quite a lot of material that hasn't been released yet.

Your post sounds like a poorly-disguised plug tbh, but the game looks pretty good to me. Just annoyed that the designs and artwork I've seen so far seem obsessed with making sure we know that the women have breasts, lol. 

OP, when you say that ""someone is representing us,"" it immediately increases the expectations meter, and this game falls really short for me. The artwork and designs are all very male gaze-y (the ""boobs and butt poses"" put me off), so I'm not convinced this game has us in mind.

1049,"I'm not sure if this counts, as it's more odd/weird and a little comforting than scary, and it's probably pretty common. Very soon after my mom died, we started experiencing weird things around the house. While looking back from an open window, I saw her feet very clearly inside the well-lit room, but when I glanced up, there was no one there. Our dog would suddenly stare at a specific, human-height spot for a long period of time and cant his head like he's listening to someone--I know that sounds pretty normal, but he never used to do that before, and with such frequency. It was often when there were two or more people in the room, too. He stopped doing it about a month later. Our neighbor said there was an overpowering scent of flowers when she was walking through our living room, but we couldn't smell anything out of the ordinary. 

My sister and I also started having very vivid dreams where our mom was talking to us or comforting us, but I kind of attribute this last one to our own minds trying to get us to cope with her passing, maybe. 

Some of our relatives mentioned a few more weird occurrences during her wake and funeral, but they mostly sounded like coincidences or wishful thinking (portraits falling off, someone getting chills, stuff like that). The one thing that really stood out for me though, was when a relative brought a baby to the funeral. My mom was *very* fond of babies. She'd coo and make faces at them even when they're being held by strangers and often strike up conversations with the parents. Anyway, this baby, throughout the *entire* time we were out at the cemetery, would consistently stare wide-eyed at an empty space and then squeal out loud, giggle, then reach out at the air. The entire time. It was freaky as fuck, but also really funny. Her parents were bewildered. A number of times, while she was reaching out, we'd try to physically carry her to wherever she was reaching to see if she was just reacting to something at the far wall or whatever, but after a few paces, she'd just stop and look confused. Soon after, she'd start again, and it wasn't always at the same spot, but the spot was always empty or had nothing remarkable. The way she was acting, it really seemed like someone was actually trying to interact with her, rather than her just finding glee in very boring cemetery walls. She kept doing this even during the somber prayers, which made things pretty funny and light-hearted.",2015-10-24 20:16:14+00:00,cwbh2t3,1.0,t3_3q26nr,5219.0,Philippines

1057,"The short answer to the question in your title is, ""No, of course not.""

The longer answer would be, a lot of things depend on how they're framed, especially in the context of an underrepresented group. How was the hurting done? What was the purpose of it? Was it to enrage another character? Was she formerly a power fantasy character that was suddenly harmed just to further someone else's storyline? Was she ""fridged"" or ""damseled""? Women characters are among those who often get the short end of the stick, and people are understandably wary whenever something big and negative happens to them. They often end up being martyrs or props, even in their own stories.

Also, I don't see infallible heroes as ""Mary Sues"" (or, I suppose, ""Mary Sues"" as inherently bad, as people have come to start using that term to mean just about any female character that isn't submissive or isn't in the background, and it's lost any sort of meaning for me).

&gt;Sat 7th Nov, 2015, 19:30 - Â£8.00/ Â£6.00

&gt;Bernard Hareâs popular memoir about growing up on an East Leeds estate is vividly brought to the screen for the first time by Candida Brady. Eleven-year old Urban Grimshaw (Fraser Kelly) is Britainâs most runaway child, heâs even been on TVâs Crimewatch. His mother Greta (Anna Friel) is a junkie and his father might as well be dead. He canât read or write, and he doesnât go to school. His average day is spent sitting round a bonfire with his mates smoking drugs and stealing cars. When he meets his motherâs new friend Chop (Richard Armitage), a disillusioned ex-social worker also living on societyâs margins, on one of Leedsâ roughest estates, the two become firm friends.

&gt;Book tickets for the screening at 16:00.

&gt;Hullo, everyone! Sorry we've been unable to give you any information about our progress and how you can see our film. Believe us, we are as eager for you to see Urban and The Shed Crew as all of you are to see it. The film is finished - post-production was complicated - and we're actively seeking distributors. We hope we'll be able to tell you about #UrbanandtheShedCrew screenings at upcoming film festivals, and that these screenings will draw the attention and distributors we need. 

&gt;Please, all of you, keep your fingers crossed for us, and we promise we'll tell you as soon as we have any news to share!

&gt;Thank you so much for your steadfast support!

1251,"&gt;So long story short, I have fear issues of sticking my neck out.

I can empathize with this so much. It's why I asked about AGF here instead of the other subs, figuring there'd be some crossover subscribers.

I know you want to make your dream game, but please consider making a whole bunch of tiny crap games first before attempting the one you seriously want to focus on. I'd suggest choosing an engine and following a few tutorials to test the waters. I'm more on the graphics side of things and only recently diving into art assets specifically for games, so the help I can offer is limited, but in case it helps: the two most popular engines for indies at the moment are Unity and Unreal, as previously mentioned. Unity uses C# and Unreal uses C++. A lot of lovely games have come out of both engines, and they have large community support groups here in Reddit and in their official forums, so it's pretty much a coin toss between the two if you have no preference regarding the programming language. If you have no programming experience before this, it's going to be quite a learning curve but keep at it. You sound passionate about this game you want to make, and that's going to help with motivation, especially if this ends up being long-term. Depending on the game, you could also look into plug-ins like Playmaker and see if that will suffice in lieu of code, but if you want some pretty complex stuff, there's no going around the coding, really. 

If you're choosing to stick with the group you mentioned earlier, what sort of framework did they want? You could consider making a [game design document](http://www.cgmasters.net/free-tutorials/gamedev-3-gdd/) to pitch the game more effectively to them and give them a better idea of your vision, maybe? It could also help you organize your ideas. Essentially, you're asking these folks to invest their time and skills in your passion project, so approaching this in a more serious or formal manner might help make them see that you're serious about it. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt here though, I don't have the best impression of them because of how they've treated you. :/ 

I know this isn't much, but I hope it helps somehow. ",2015-09-03 09:49:53+00:00,cup3jvz,5.0,t1_cunwc8u,99093.0,GirlGamers

I've seen people mention the lack of extensive backstory for Dolarhyde quite a few times, but I like that the show has taken this approach on it. That very brief glimpse at the dinner table was pretty powerful for me and left quite an impression, I thought it was very well done. Am curious if they'll include more peeks in the last two episodes.

I do wish more season real estate had gone to Red Dragon, though. Loved the midseason finale of the first arc, but felt like they could have shaved one or two episodes from close to the start.

Very curious about Manhunter, and will probably watch it after Hannibal ends. ",2015-08-19 06:44:41+00:00,cu80dq7,1.0,t3_3hiyoi,18396.0,HannibalTV

I find it a little odd when people try to compartmentalize what's CG and what isn't into neat little boxes--oftentimes, VFX digital artists are tasked with compositing anyway (though I'm not sure if that's the case for Hannibal).

http://i.imgur.com/XEQU1B2.jpg

There are blurry parts that shouldn't be, and clear parts that shouldn't be. The fact that the ground the dragon is standing on is the clearest bit of the image makes it look like a badly photo-bashed scene rather than a cohesive picture. And they went with a blurred out photo-realistic fire and a photorealistic ground as well...and layered the painterly dragon on top of both. Yeah, that's really not gonna work. 

I personally love CG, but I cringe whenever I see people putting up poorly-made stuff regardless of whether or not it's traditional or digital. Hannibal's had to make do with poor props and effects before, and this is no different, really.

Yeah, that was a great moment (though I personally felt it was hindered by the poor CG quality--I know there's disagreement on this).

* Dolarhyde fanboying over Hannibal, and ""observing"" his own conversation with him. 

* Will's entire conversation with Bedelia in her office. Some quotable lines there.

* Zachary's brief performance in the flashback was riveting. 

* The tiger scene, especially the dip in tone and music when Reba's hand approached the tiger's mouth and Dolarhyde's strong reaction to that, then everything shifting back to intimate and poignant when her hand moves away. Loved the whole moment.

* Wasn't too thrilled with the couch scene, it had some weird shots, but the sex scene in Dolarhyde's bedroom was pretty great. Dolarhyde smothering his face with Reba's hand after while she slept was oddly sweet.

* Loved Gillian Anderson's line delivery in this episode. All of it. All the lines.

* Will and Dolarhyde's first meeting. The look in their eyes was a breath-stopper for me. Amazing note to end the episode on.

1433,"I think this is assigning too much blame on deviations from the source material (which I'm personally glad for, and which I think are rather blameless) rather than how much of a niche audience this series was ever going to have. In my family, two people are Harris fans, one isn't (me, oops), and all three of us weren't up to even giving this series a try when it first came out. My relatives, because they're rather fond of the Hopkins version and didn't want to see just another repeat of previous adaptations; me, because there were certain elements in SOTL and the Red Dragon novel that I disliked intensely and didn't want to see on screen. The only thing that got us to start watching was a close friend insisting that we try it. Left on our own, none of us would have touched the first episode with a ten foot pole.

Since we've been hooked, I'm finding difficulty pimping the series to others. Gore's a hard sell, and gore with a story that people already have either negative or positive impressions of, even harder. ",2015-07-21 09:11:57+00:00,ctapguj,1.0,t3_3e1qs3,4764.0,HannibalTV

1540,"Wow, that's enraging. The whole point of not having the trinity in GW2 is everyone's responsible for their own damage output and *their own survivability*. Admittedly, I run the meta zerker build on my Ranger with a few variations because I absolutely love damage, but I love playing with others regardless of build and I don't finger-point when the party wipes. I'm glad I haven't encountered many assholes in the game, but the few I have just make me want to throttle something. Sorry to hear they get on your case about your builds. People also want to ignore that not all players have the same pings, asking players with average 250-300ms latency to run a glass build calls for a frustrating amount of prediction skills. At best, it adds a 1/4 second delay to everything you see and do, and there are situations where that's already far too much.",2015-06-25 04:29:41+00:00,cshx1mo,13.0,t1_cshnbex,18258.0,GirlGamers

**THE WALKING DEAD SPOILER WARNING**

The Walking Dead. Saying good-bye to little Clementine broke my heart, because fuck, you're leaving her alone in a dangerous world and she's not ready and she's scared, and you know that if you don't do a good job she'll try to stay with you even if you turn and you don't want her to see you turn and you want her to stay safe away from you, so you do your best to prepare her while pushing her to leave the place on her own. Those little notifs from the game ""Clementine will remember that"" whenever you gave life-saving advice while dying didn't help, I was a mess.

**ME3 SPOILER WARNING**

ME3, that Mordin scene you mentioned and near the end when Liara  laid her head on my Shepard's shoulder and quietly watched the stars go by.

Probably not a popular stance here, but I don't think there's anything inherently bad in sexualizing fictional characters. It contributes to fantasy and lets people who like it escape in their own ways. It does become a problem when it's all one gender, all the time.",2015-06-23 07:29:04+00:00,csfopok,1.0,t3_3asl41,11376.0,GirlGamers

1590,"* Terraria's a great 2D equivalent to Minecraft. A game I recently got that's similar to Terraria but with better visuals and interesting management mechanics is [Craft the World](http://store.steampowered.com/app/248390/). No online/multiplayer component, though. It's been eating up most of my time recently. Picked it up for like $4, hoping it'll come up in the last two days of the Steam Sale again.

* Harvest Moon series. I recommend starting with Back to Nature (way more to do, lovely intro to the series) or Animal Parade (more relaxed atmosphere, days are much longer). No combat, just making your way through life in a small village one day at a time.

* Guild Wars 2 doesn't have a healing class, but its PvP and PvE are completely separate. Not really sure what you mean by violent fighting/being attacked...but if you mean being attacked in open world while you just want to farm that harvesting node and mind your own business, then that doesn't happen in this game. Since progression to top level and good gear is also fairly quick with comparatively little grind, it's as relaxing or as stressful as you want it to be. If you just want to zen out or explore or farm open world bosses with hundreds of players everyday, you can do just that without feeling left behind or underpowered compared to the power gamers. No kill-stealing or fighting over harvesting nodes either, no silly last-hit gets all the loot system. I'd wait until the Heart of Thorns expansion is out before getting it though, it's a pretty big update, and hopefully they'll come up with a better pricing scheme for it. But yeah, highly recommended. The game does have an item mall, but there aren't any stats or performance-related items in there, just Quality of Life stuff and aesthetics. The item mall currency can also be converted from in-game gold, which is pretty great.

* A fun little mobile game I like to play during pockets of time is [Alien Hive](http://appxplore.com/index.php/games/alien-hive). It's a different take on the match-3 game, has a bit of a learning curve but once you get used to it, time just flies by.
