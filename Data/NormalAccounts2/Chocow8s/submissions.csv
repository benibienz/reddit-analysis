I'm having trouble getting DAI to work via Steam Link and having it detect either the Steam Controller or the XBOX 360 Controller. Are there any definite solutions to this yet?

Setups I've tried:

* Steam Link with Steam Controller
* Steam Link with Steam Controller + XBOX 360 Controller
* Steam Link with Steam Controller, XBOX 360 Controller attached to PC to try and trick the game into activating gamepad for SC
* Disabled all Origin in-game overlays.
* Disabled/enabled Use desktop settings in launcher under Steam's Controller COnfiguration.
* Removed my Razer keypad so the game won't detect/use it.

Things I've tried:

* Added Origin to the Steam Library and tried to run DAI from there. DAI opens, but the steam controller defaults to kb/m, and it won't detect the XBOX 360 controller. It won't let me configure the steam controller either, when I press the Steam button, it goes back to Big Picture mode but won't return to the DAI window.

* Added DAI to the Steam Library. For this to work, I have to open Origin first on my PC, otherwise it tries to open Origin on its own but tabs back to Steam Big Picture Mode and won't return. With Origin client open beforehand, DAI runs, but I get the same problem as earlier, ie the game doesn't detect gamepad at all and defaults to kb/m. Trying to edit the steam controller config by pressing the steam button just returns to Big Picture Mode and won't return to the game.

* Plugged in the 360 to the PC and ran DAI via Steam Link. This way, the game does detect the controller, but it won't let me use the SC as a gamepad. Setting Controls as ""gamepad"" results in zero input from the steam controller, even if it's setup as a pure gamepad configuration beforehand.

I'll try to stay on top of the photo stream though, but the schedule page will have to be frozen at the time being, and the weekly news discontinued, unless someone else can help me keep either (or both) of those up to date.

&gt;As you’ll discover in December this is where some of the key scenes take place, with Richard Armitage using his fantastic array of voices on everyone from Romeo to Mercutio and a hilariously bombastic Nurse. I’ll leave you to spot the unexpected source of her accent, though I will say I think she deserves a TV show of her own.

&gt;Moretz's decent yet increasingly hysterical performance doesn't temper the movie's Lifetime-production atmosphere, to be sure, while the able supporting cast, which includes Richard Armitage, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Tyler Perry, is left floundering in underwritten characters that seem to have emerged directly from a template for movies of this ilk.

* A review of Brain on Fire from ThePlaylist.net: [""‘Brain On Fire’ Starring Chloe Grace Moretz Is Disappointingly More Conventional Than Daring \[TIFF Review\]""](http://theplaylist.net/brain-fire-starring-chloe-grace-moretz-disappointingly-conventional-daring-tiff-review-20160915/) rated B-
&gt;Sentimental touches abound: Cahalan’s devoted boyfriend Stephen (Thomas Mann) writes a song for her that inspires her to shed tears even in her catatonic state; her frustrated father Tom (Richard Armitage) delivers an angry outburst that emphasizes his desire to “find out what is wrong with my daughter;” John Paesano’s music score ramps up the tear-jerking electronic droning. 

* [A video review of Brain on Fire from We Live Entertainment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxqaLO6Ew6Q), one rated it 8/10 the other 2.5 stars out of 4. Excerpts:
&gt;1: ""I actually was very impressed with Richard Armitage, who played her father. He brings I think a lot of emotion to some of those scenes.""
&gt;
&gt;2: ""Once again, I really loved Richard Armitage, who's best known for being in The Hobbit trilogy, but he was really good here. And the scenes that he shares I think with Thomas Mann I thought were some of the best, because that's the kind of the aspects that I'm trying to say, we were stuck so much in one aspect that when we do get something else, like the relationship between the dad and the boyfriend, that was something that actually grew throughout the film. Like at the beginning of the movie, this kid's dating his daughter, and he hates the guy. But then he sees how committed this kid is to his daughter, and then they have a moment at the end of the film. I actually thought that that was the best scene in the film.""

* Moviepilot.com's review of Berlin Station's first two episodes: [""Next Stop, 'Berlin Station': A Top Secret Look Inside The New TV Spy Thriller""](http://moviepilot.com/p/why-berlin-station-could-be-tvs-next-big-spy-thriller/4098235)
&gt;Richard Armitage has the lead role as Daniel Miller, the agent seeking shaw. The talented character actor is perhaps best known for his role as Thorin Oakenshield in The Hobbit trilogy.

* A not-so-flattering review of Berlin Station's first two episodes [from The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/entertainment/fall-tv-shows-2016/?tid=sm_fb#berlin-station), rated with a D-. Excerpt follows:
&gt;One of the reasons it’s difficult to keep up is that “Berlin Station” is boring, as is its central character. As the spy we’re supposed to be rooting for, Armitage might as well be a cardboard cutout. If you want cable viewers to find you on a busy Sunday night and stick with you, you’re going to have to do better than this.

&gt;*What Is It? Richard Armitage leads the impressive cast of EPIX’s spy thriller as Daniel Miller, a CIA agent stationed in Berlin to determine the identity of a now-famous whistleblower masquerading as “Thomas Shaw.” Miller is thrown into the fast-paced world of field officers — running, deception, danger and moral compromises — with the help of veteran spy Hector DeJean (Rhys Ifans). Richard Jenkins and Michelle Forbes co-star.*
&gt;
&gt;*I’ll Like It If I Like… “The Game,” “The Americans.”*
&gt;
&gt;*Why Should I Care? Um, because Richard Jenkins is in it? The recent Emmy-winner may not be the star, but considering his record on prestige drama series — “Olive Kitteridge,” “Six Feet Under” — how can we not check out his latest venture for the small screen? There are other reasons, but you don’t need to hear them. Trust us.*

Would love to know if there's a good team here I can progress normal/technical dungeons with and farm the weekly dungeons for evo mats with more easily (expert and higher). I'm fairly new and a little lost/overwhelmed at the moment. I've tried using the ogre/siren trick for farming the wednesday/friday dungeons, but I've been very unlucky with that so far (mobs with the same countdown I can't kill on time, mostly). Succeeded twice just this Friday, but hoping there's a more efficient way with what I have.

Thinking of replacing Kushinada with Bastet as leader once I've leveled and evo'd her. I've gotten very attached to Kushinada though, and I'm not seeing that big of a difference between their leader skills. Also considering replacing the Plesios with Echidna after I've farmed her, or Armor Ogre for the orb change skill. Not sure if any of these are wise decisions.

I was thrilled about pulling Liu Bei until I realised I got the mini version, and now I don't know what to think. (Why are there minis? What should I do with mine? I seem to have three types of them.)

&gt;[1](https://twitter.com/RCArmitage/status/759841298945679362): .@EpixHD BerlinStation premiere on EPIX Sunday 10/16 @ 9:00 p.m. And offering the first 2 episodes free on multiple platforms across the US
&gt;
&gt;[2](https://twitter.com/RCArmitage/status/760153772429611008): Proud to be in the company of Nick Nolte, Richard Jenkins and Norman Lear at the TCA event in LA #legendary
&gt;
&gt;[3](https://twitter.com/RCArmitage/status/760193940838637568): .@OfficialTCA @BerlinStation @epixpress @EpixHD Thank you to the Television Critics Association for covering Epix presentation.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt;[5](https://twitter.com/RCArmitage/status/760200534745812992): .@BerlinStation @epixpress @EpixHD See you in NYC and at the LA premiere later in the year.

* Later in the week, he tweeted the following regarding ""equivocation in the Intelligence Services"":
&gt;[1](https://twitter.com/RCArmitage/status/761559045836828672):.@BerlinStation @epixpress @EpixHD Equivocation in the Intelligence Services is a theme brewing in my mind. Is fielding the truth, lying?
&gt;
&gt;[2](https://twitter.com/RCArmitage/status/761559872638967808): @BerlinStation @epixpress @EpixHD the paradox being; full exposure leaves us extremely vulnerable. Just pondering Clintons e mail decision.
&gt;
&gt;[3](https://twitter.com/RCArmitage/status/761562175907430400): @BerlinStation @epixpress @EpixHD ""there is a possibility I could be wrong, but I'm acting in a way I wholeheartedly believe to be right""
&gt;
&gt;[4](https://twitter.com/RCArmitage/status/761562762346631168): @BerlinStation @epixpress @EpixHD shouldn't this be pinned to every politicians mirror as they rise daily to fight for their citizens
&gt;
&gt;[5](https://twitter.com/RCArmitage/status/761566716086411264): @BerlinStation @epixpress the CIA use the term 'redaction'; applies mainly to document but maybe also to testimony. What do we need to know?
&gt;
&gt;[6](https://twitter.com/RCArmitage/status/761568316095889412): @BerlinStation @epixpress I have become the kind of person who indomitably seeks to find the 'best' in people, to the very end.
&gt;
&gt;[7](https://twitter.com/RCArmitage/status/761979385192865792): Governments have more power when its citizens are thrust into a state of fear. 'Enemies of the state' thrive on this division.

&gt;*Outstanding Drama Series Hannibal (NBC)*  
&gt;*Here’s another one I fear as vanished from memory and conversation. The third and final season of Bryan Fuller’s aesthetically audacious and gleefully transgressive adaptation of Thomas Harris’ Hannibal Lecter oeuvre aired last summer. Also, like, no one watched it. But it was important, boundary-pushing TV, in formal innovation and characterization, that paved the way for two other arty marvels that I hope Emmy remembers, HBO’s The Leftovers (in particular, the writing and directing in the surreal purgatorial episode “International Assassin”) and USA’s Mr. Robot (in particular, Rami Malek’s mesmerizing lead performance). The first half of Hannibal’s final course served up meaty nightmares about self-destructive obsession, enmeshment, and vengeance, sauced with op-art sex scenes, baroque violence, and disturbing, meaningful grotesque. The second half, a novel reworking of Red Dragon, gave us a vital and vigorous serial killer performance by Richard Armitage – no small thing, given our serial killer-saturated pop culture – and pushed the strangest ’ship in TV history — doomed psycho-seer Will (Hugh Dancy), damnable psycho aesthete Hannibal (Mads Mikkelsen) — over a cliff in a locked embrace and into the abyss. It was a sublime concluding statement about the dead-end fascination with abomination.*

&gt;*Pour out a glass of 1979 Chateau Margaux for the heaviest loss of the most recent round of mass network dismissals. Bryan Fuller's take on Thomas Harris' thriller novels about Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter was never cut out for life on network TV. It was steeped in highbrow esoterica of literature and art history, and shot with a formally experimental spirit seldom found on the small-screen — Fuller's house style could be described as ""classical oil painting meets the iTunes visualizer."" The show's swan-song season wasn't just darker and more daring than the first two, a feat in itself; it also put MVP actors Mads Mikkelsen, Hugh Dancy, Gillian Anderson, and Richard Armitage to good use. We're still waiting for something to fill the ""bizarro art-TV"" vacuum Hannibal left, but for now, these leftovers will have to suffice for a four-course tasting menu.*

* [The 2016 Emmy Awards Nominating Ballots are up](http://www.emmys.com/ballots/2016), and Richard's in consideration for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series as Francis Dolarhyde in Hannibal

&gt;*Similarly, the final season of Gaumont International Television’s “Hannibal” for NBC has only been submitted in a handful of categories. Star Hugh Dancy is not on the ballot (possibly because it could conflict with his bid for Hulu’s “The Path”), making Mads Mikkelsen and guest star Richard Armitage the lone acting entries. The show was submitted for drama series consideration and writing, but no directors are on the ballot and it’s MIA in tech categories like cinematography and art direction too.*

* TV Roundtable: [""FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION: HANNIBAL AND THE 68TH PRIMETIME EMMY AWARDS""](http://tvroundtable.com/2016/06/consideration-hannibal-68th-primetime-emmy-awards/), via Microlina
&gt;*Guest performer categories are ones where, historically, excellent series get the consolation nod. Last year, Margo Martindale gave The Americans fans a small, small piece of satisfaction by winning in the Guest Actress category. Even though The Americans has had a tough time swaying enough of the voters to make it a major contender throughout the rest of the Drama categories, there’s some solace in any amount of recognition. If Martindale, why not Armitage? Richard Armitage haunts the second half of Hannibal’s third season by giving one of the most imposing, physical performances in years as Francis Dolarhyde, the Tooth Fairy. “The Great Red Dragon,” the first episode of that arc, begins with a dialog-less montage of the Tooth Fairy’s inception and is a terrifying evolution of self-discovery. Dolarhyde has been portrayed by actors as renowned as Tom Noonan and Ralph Fiennes, but Armitage makes the role his own and elevates it to the demanding level of quality at which Hannibal operates. With the popularity of the Hobbit films, Armitage has the added benefit of a bit more name recognition, but even without that boost, “The Great Red Dragon” showcases Armitage’s character as an opposing force to Hugh Dancy’s Will Graham that is as confounding, compelling and complicated as viewers could want out of a final antagonist for the series.*

&gt;*When you think British actors at the moment that play rugged yet refined, handsome and caddish heroes there is only one name that springs to mind: Richard Armitage. The odds may be on Hiddleston, who has met Bond execs, but he suits the Bond villain over Bond. Armitage is younger than Craig, he’s had the experience of working with a major film franchise in The Hobbit, but mostly he’s been working in TV. Who doesn’t remember Armitage as the dashing Gisborne in the BBC's Robin Hood? Bond doesn’t need the flashiest Hollywood star, nor does it want it. Craig wasn’t huge before Casino Royale and Moore was tied up with television series The Saint. Brosnan was known for television roles, Dalton came from television too, starring in Sins. Armitage has proved he’s got the acting chops, he’s proved he can carry a major role through a franchise and he’s damn good-looking to boot.*

&gt;*The second book released in February was Charles Dickens' David Copperfield, as performed by Richard Armitage. The Hobbit actor has performed for multiple Audible books already and he does not disappoint in this version of the famed Dickens novel. Readers love how Armitage is able to fully form each of the characters in readers' minds by giving them a specific voice, making the story all the more realistic. Despite the fact that there are over 50 characters introduced in this coming-of-age novel, Armitage performs perfectly.*

&gt;*If that's not enough, check out Audible's March release of The Turn of the Screw, a Henry James novel performed by Emma Thompson, with Richard Armitage voicing the prologue.*

&gt;*Probably the most truly darkly Shakespearean character in MI-5 is Richard Armitage’s Lucas North, who performs heroics beyond the call after returning from seven years of torture in Moscow, only to have his dark past come back to bedevil him. His romance with CIA agent Sarah Caulfield (Genevieve O’Reilly) is worth mentioning mainly because one of the more amusing sidelights of MI-5 is when U.K. actors attempt American accents. The Dublin-born O’Reilly is all over the map, north to south, east to west, giving an inadvertent Saturday Night Live quality to her intimate moments with North.*

The production relies on familiar faces from the movies like Richard Armitage, British actor known for roles like Guy of Gisborne in the series “Robin Hood” or Thorin Oakenshield in the film “The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five armies” based on the novel, “The Hobbit,” from the trilogy [sic] written by Tolkien.

* Audible praises Richard as [one of the Top Voices in Classics](http://www.audible.com/mt/Genre-Narrators-Fic/ref=amb_link_458593122_3) under Genre-Defining Narrators
&gt;*Richard Armitage first won our hearts with his performance of Hamlet: Prince of Denmark: a Novel. While not technically a classic, the acclaimed actor proved his ability to bring well-known characters to life in a whole new way. With his impeccable recent performance of Dickens’ David Copperfield, he’s sealed his reputation a top voice in the genre.*

*  Bild.de has posted a small article about Berlin Station [here](http://m.bild.de/bild-plus/regional/berlin/dreharbeiten/hollywood-star-in-charlottenburg-entfuehrt-44844200). It's translated by Me + Richard Armitage [here](https://meandrichard.wordpress.com/2016/03/08/english-translation-of-bild-article-about-richard-armitage-nothing-new/).

* [Another German tabloid has posted about Richard](http://www.berliner-kurier.de/berlin/leute/zwei-briten-stars-berlin-du-bist-so-wunderbar-und-so-nervig--23701126?dmcid=sm_tw), translation provided by Me + Richard Armitage [here](https://meandrichard.wordpress.com/2016/03/10/translation-of-berliner-kurier-article-richardarmitage/).

* Richard is featured in MSN's [""Actors We Wish Would Play The Next James Bond""](http://www.msn.com/en-gb/entertainment/movies/actors-we-wish-would-play-the-next-james-bond/ss-AAfmS3N?ocid=spartandhp#image=2):
&gt;*The “dwarf prince” of ""Hobbit"" trilogy definitely has the required rugged edge to play 007. At 44 years old, he is old enough to convincingly portray James Bond who has risen to the rank of Naval Commander; and seems the kind of fellow who can dodge bad guys on European ski slopes and take a clean gun shot with equal ease.*

* (Very) Small mention of Richard's David Copperfield in Examiner.com's [""Classic novels get fresh take for spring break with audio books""](http://www.examiner.com/article/classic-novels-get-fresh-take-for-spring-break-with-audio-books)

* [Gold Derby has some very flattering words about Richard's performance in Hannibal S3](http://www.goldderby.com/news/12010/emmy-spotlight-richard-armitage-hannibal-red-dragon-319752468.html):

&gt;*The third and final season of the cult hit aired last summer on NBC, and all my praise for season two still applies, but I'd like to focus particular attention on one new standout: Richard Armitage as serial killer Francis Dolarhyde, aka the Red Dragon.*

&gt;*So yes, you should nominate Hugh Dancy, Mads Mikkelsen, Gillian Anderson, writer/creator Bryan Fuller, one or more directors and as many below-the-line craft professionals as possible. But let's talk about Armitage. Like many other actors on the show he had big shoes to fill. The Red Dragon, infamous for his deadly home invasions and delusions of transformation, is well known as the title character of Thomas Harris's 1981 novel. He had also been portrayed twice before on-screen: by Tom Noonan in ""Manhunter"" (1986) and later by Ralph Fiennes in ""Red Dragon"" (2002).*

&gt;*But like his co-stars, Armitage gives a performance all his own. It's a carefully balanced turn: Dolarhyde has a split personality, one half an insecure wallflower and the other half a monster out of nightmares. But Armitage makes us believe that both personas could exist in one man -- more than that, that each persona fuels the other.*

&gt;*But even knowing what we know about his alter ego's horrific crimes, his Dolarhyde is sympathetic, fragile even. He has a cleft lip, which affects his speech and leaves him with crippling shyness; he speaks and moves as if apologizing for the space he occupies. Then he meets a film developer, Reba (""True Blood"" alum Rutina Wesley), who is blind and thus eases his self-consciousness. The tender scenes between Armitage and Wesley have a dual tension: of course we fear for Reba's life, but we're also hopeful for Reba's loving influence on him.*

&gt;*It's impressive that ""Hannibal"" and its actors were able to create such human scenes and relationships alongside the unparalleled horrors of its murder stories, but Armitage has the added challenge of trying to pull it off in one character.*

&gt;*As the Red Dragon, the actor has to go toe-to-toe with Mikkelsen and Dancy as Hannibal Lecter and FBI profile Will Graham, respectively, and he's more than fearsome enough to hold his ground. More than perhaps any other villain in the show's entire run, he channels a demonic rage that is downright otherworldly. Standing six-foot-two, Armitage has an imposing physical presence; with Reba he seems to cower in that height, but as the Dragon he towers with menace. To think, this is the same actor who played the diminutive dwarf Thorin for three years in the ""Hobbit"" films; seeing the two characters side by side, you'd never know it's the same actor.
Armitage has already picked up a Critics' Choice bid for his performance as Dolarhyde. An Emmy nomination should follow.*

The child has passed away, and the mother's in surgery. These guys had Globe IDs and were carrying a job order that granted them access to that house. 

If the job order they were carrying was legit and that family was expecting someone from Globe, then these guys possibly have access to information on which houses have pending technical problems requiring people to be sent over. Please exercise caution.

Globe had also apparently received confirmation that the job order had been completed. PNP also expressed frustration that Globe wasn't coordinating with them to aid in the investigation. Local government has issued a Php 200,000 reward for information that could aid in the perpetrators' arrest. 

**Edit5:** [According to GMA News regarding the two technicians from Levinson brought in by the PNP](http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/557818/news/nation/internet-repairmen-under-probe-for-filing-fake-job-report): 

&gt;*They are now persons of interest in the investigation after police learned that they filed a fake report on going to the victims' home.*

* David Copperfield review excerpt from Bookriot.com: [""8 Classic Audiobooks Read by Famous People""](http://bookriot.com/2016/02/26/8-classic-audiobooks-read-by-famous-people/)
&gt;*David Copperfield narrated by Richard Armitage — Next up in Bizarrely Attractive Brits Narrate The Classics is the Richard Armitage, whose voice could put me to sleep or keep me captivated forever, depending on what he’s saying. It’s a voice that could get anyone through one of Dickens’s more beloved works, no matter how scared you are of the length or repeated use of semicolons.*

* Another review excerpt from South China Morning Post: [""Book reviews: fiction from Yann Martel, Ernest Bramah and Charles Dickens""](http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/books/article/1916598/book-reviews-fiction-yann-martel-ernest-bramah-and-charles-dickens)
&gt;*You may have seen Richard Armitage in full-body acting action as Thorin Oakenshield in The Hobbit, or the serial killer Francis Dolarhyde in Silence of the Lambs spin-off Hannibal. Audiobook fans may have heard him narrating Hamlet (the novel), which won Audible’s 2014 audiobook of the year. His range of voices – unlike some he doesn’t hold back on accents or characterisation – means it was only a matter of time before he attempted a big Dickens, having read the Christmas story The Chimes last December. And here it is: his David Copperfield is a 36-hour epic which stretches his full range. Armitage narrates Dickens’ own vibrant narration with humour and melody, but you have to tip your hat to the diversity and consistency of his voicing, from the simpering, slippery Uriah Heep to the well-spoken bounder James Steerforth. The exception, of course, is David himself, whom Armitage develops from helpless child to confused, aspiring young man to mature, redeemed adult. Armitage passed my own tests, which were making Mr Murdstone a greater monster than, say, the murderer Magwitch in Great Expectations and presenting Mr Micawber as an infuriating, lovable rogue. If you have a spare day and half, I urge you to clamp headphones over your ears.*

&gt;*Audible Studios, a production arm of Audible.com, today announced the release of beloved stage and screen actor Richard Armitage’s audio interpretation of Charles Dickens’ most autobiographical novel, David Copperfield. This impassioned performance by the star of Hannibal and The Hobbit is now available for download at audible.com/Copperfield.*

&gt;*""I think David Copperfield is Dickens’ broadest, most humorous and moving epic novel,” said Armitage. “His treatment in this work of birth, life, love and death had a huge impact on me the first time I read it. It gave me immense pleasure to attempt to bring these vivid characters to life for Audible. The resilience and tenacity of the central protagonist and the paths which Dickens carves out for David, through his extraordinary life, touch the heart and soul, bringing tears of both laughter and of deep sadness.”*

&gt;*“That this work was considered largely autobiographical makes for a truly immersive read and is one of my favorite works of classic English literature,” added Armitage. “I'm very proud to have been asked to read this beloved book. I hope you enjoy listening.”*

&gt;*“David Copperfield is among Dickens’ most enduring and popular novels, and now there’s another reason to experience—or revisit—this remarkable and inventive imagining of one man’s life,” said Audible EVP and Publisher Beth Anderson. “With every recording, we strive to identify the perfect match of text and actor, and we think listeners will agree that Richard Armitage and David Copperfield is that ideal pairing. Fans of Richard’s television and film work are going to love spending time at the gym or in the car as he tells them this story.”*

&gt;*In addition to his impressive television and film resume, Armitage is a renowned and polished audiobook narrator. His 2015 performance of Classic Love Poems, also published by Audible Studios, was one of the bestselling audiobooks of the year, and is a finalist for the Audie Award in the “Best Male Narrator” category. His recording of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark: A Novel, was named Audible’s best audiobook of the year in 2014.*

&gt;*In a chilling, largely physical performance, Richard Armitage nearly steals the entire third (and to date, final) season of HANNIBAL as the “Tooth Fairy” himself, Francis Dolarhyde. It takes an incredibly skilled performer to make such a terrifying psychopath- one that murders families and targets the family of our protagonist- so sympathetic and poetic; from his very first episode on HANNIBAL, it was guaranteed that Armitage would find himself in the running for a Chainsaw Award in 2016.*

* Glamour UK posted their [list of 100 Sexiest Men of 2015-2016 on their site](http://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/celebrity/celebrity-galleries/2015/08/sexiest-hottest-men-of-2015-2016/viewgallery/1552041), Richard is number 13!

&gt;*Sarah Wayne Callies was thrilled that her Into The Storm co-star Richard Armitage knows Walking Dead friend Andrew Lincoln
Yip Wai Yee*

&gt;*American actress Sarah Wayne Callies assumes all English actors know one other, she says.*

&gt;*She is being facetious, of course, but she hit the nail on the head when she discovered that her latest co-star, Richard Armitage, is in fact friends with her former The Walking Dead leading man, Andrew Lincoln.*

&gt;*Speaking to Life! in a telephone interview this week to promote her new movie, Into The Storm, in which she stars with Armitage, she says with a chuckle: ""After Richard was cast, I called Andy (Lincoln) to ask about him and it turns out they really knew each other from when they did Strike Back (2010) together.*

&gt;*""Andy told me that Richard is such a gentleman and he's so talented and all that. Unbeknown to me, Richard had done the exact same thing about me to Andy.""*

&gt;*She adds cheerily: ""Andy shortened the distance between Richard and me because we had someone who cared so much about the both of us say such nice things about us to the other person. So working with Richard from day one felt like I was working with a friend.""*

* [According to Empire magazine's March issue](http://batman-news.com/2016/01/30/batman-v-superman-empire-march-2016/), Zack Snyder had met with Richard Armitage for the role of Batman.

* Excerpt follows from Den of Geek: [""Strike Back: Saluting a Great Action TV Series""](http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/strike-back/252386/strike-back-saluting-a-great-action-tv-series):

&gt;*In the original series Richard Armitage played John Porter, a disgraced soldier recruited by a secret branch of the British military. His job was to run around the globe tackling various threats while his shady boss – played by Andrew Lincoln – did his best to cover up a mistake from his past.*

&gt;*All said and done, it was a solid six-episode run, but looking back on series one it feels like a prototype for what the show would become. It has the same basic formula and high-octane action, but it feels like it's missing a certain something that would really make it pop. Season one has since become the odd man out with the rest of the series, and was even redubbed Strike Back: Origins for its belated American debut in 2013.* 

&gt;*The second series brought some major changes; American network Cinemax (nicknamed Skinemax for their focus on er, adult-orientated programming) came on to co-produce with Sky – upping the scale and scope of the series - but with Armitage busy filming The Hobbit two new characters were brought on in his place.*

&gt;*Richard Armitage is probably best known for playing Thorin Oakenshield in The Hobbit, but I think he could turn that performance around into one of the most sinister villains of all time. Thorin commanded respect and was feared by many people, and that's an important presence to have in Darkseid. Besides that, Armitage has the height, jaw line, voice, and body for this character, so he really is an all-around perfect fit!*

&gt;*My strongest memory, which was both exhausting and a really warm memory, was it being five in the morning, on the patio of that house, with Mads and Richard [Armitage], literally covered head to frickin toe in blood. More than I’ve ever had on that show before, which is really saying something! And being freezing cold and realizing that... Because in this scene, before Dolarhyde attacked us, Mads is opening a bottle of wine. We suddenly realized that wine was real, which it never is on a film set. They hadn’t thought to swap it out because we never drink it. So we pop that open. So at like five, six in the morning, as they were desperately trying to get the last shots, because the light was dying... And this was a few days before we wrapped. We didn’t know maybe forever, but we had a little toast and we nicked a bottle of wine, basically. That was a nice moment. But it was born of necessity, as well.*

Having the option to ""lock"" specific shared slots to certain items would be great.

I'm hoping something like this can be implemented:

http://i.imgur.com/sYyUZlU.png

* Right-clicking on the slot with the item inside it gives the option to ""Tether item to shared slot,"" or something similar.

* Double-clicking on the locked item in that slot automatically equips the item on that character. If that character had been wielding something else, it gets placed in normal inventory.

* Double-clicking on the greyed out empty ""locked"" slot automatically unequips the item from that character and places it in the assigned shared slot.

* In case the item has been left on another character, right clicking on the slot indicates which character it's been left on (""Equipped by: [Character name]"")

&gt;*However, I’ll single out Armitage, as he’s a new character introduced halfway through the season who still manages to make a huge impression. He delivers a creepy, showy, and yet still nuanced, performance, and he plays well off of Rutina Wesley as they help make the final arc of the show compelling.*

* [Richard tops Collider's 2015 TV Awards for ""Best Guest Actor/Actress - Drama""](http://collider.com/best-tv-2015-drama/#guest-actor-actress)

&gt;*Winner: Richard Armitage*

&gt;*2015 saw a wealth of fantastic guest appearances (Sam Elliott has never been more devilish, Margo Martindale never more conniving, B.D. Wong never more beguiling), but none were more fully arresting than Richard Armitage on Hannibal. Transforming himself — even through his physical movements — into the Red Dragon character was astonishing, terrifying, and without equal. Hannibal was a show that grew and matured with each new season, and for Armitage’s exceptional portrayal of Red Dragon to cap off the show’s run was a fitting, if bittersweet end.*

* Fangoria's [""The Year in Horror, 2015: Ken’s Top 10 Episodes of Horror Television""](http://www.fangoria.com/new/the-year-in-horror-2015-kens-top-10-episodes-of-horror-television/) mentions Hannibal and Richard/Dolarhyde a few times, excerpts follow:

&gt;*Honorable Mention: HANNIBAL, “The Great Red Dragon” (dir. Neil Marshall)*

&gt;*While HANNIBAL’s fate was unfortunately sealed before the debut of Richard Armitage as Francis Dolarhyde, the character’s nearly-silent debut on the show was among the most creepy moments throughout the third season.*

&gt;*4. HANNIBAL, “The Wrath of the Lamb” (dir. Michael Rymer)*

&gt;*The final episode (to date) of HANNIBAL was exactly the emotional powerhouse that we all expected, but no one could have expected the episode to be as visceral as it would eventually be. Though carrying the air of finality, HANNIBAL gave Graham and Lector a fitting goodbye while offering a grandiose and gruesome last stand for Francis Dolarhyde.*

* Vote for Francis Dolarhyde in [IGN's Best of 2015's ""Best TV Villain""](http://uk.ign.com/wikis/best-of-2015/Best_TV_Villain). Excerpt follows:

&gt;*Considering Hannibal is a villain in and of himself, Richard Armitage had to deliver something different when he came into the series as Francis Dolarhyde. He was a tortured soul, and Armitage let the character delve into the more sympathetic elements of his personality to really make it hurt when he followed his villainous path as the Tooth Fairy.*

* Hannibal is number 4 in [Digital Spy's list of ""Best TV of 2015: Our Top 5""](http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/feature/a776788/digital-spys-best-tv-of-2015-our-top-5-and-number-1-show-of-the-year-revealed/). Relevant portion:

&gt;*Richard Armitage made a fragile and frightening Francis Dolarhyde. But his story was ultimately a means of reuniting Hannibal and Will (Hugh Dancy) - whose cycle of seduction and betrayal finally paid off in a tragic, blood-soaked and startlingly romantic climax.* 

* Dan's Media Digest hails Hannibal as their number 2 pick: [""The Best Television of 2015: No.2 - NBC's HANNIBAL""](http://danowen.blogspot.com/2015/12/best-tv-of-2015-no2-hannibal.html) Relevant portion follows:

&gt;*Then, arguable the show's raison d'être arrived in the second-half, with a surprisingly faithful retelling of Red Dragon (already filmed twice) that nevertheless didn't become a chore to sit through because of the show's twists on the material—plus a benchmark-setting performance by Richard Armitage as Francis Dolarhyde.*

&gt;*""Debuting as The Great Red Dragon, Francis Dolarhyde, The Tooth Fairy Killer was Richard Armitage. In another phenomenal addition to the Hannibal world, Richard Armitage was able to convey the sense of inner conflict and emotional struggles that lie deep within Dolarhyde's psyche.""*

* [Slant Magazine posted a review of Hannibal Season 3](http://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/review/hannibal-season-three) on December 8, relevant excerpt follows:

&gt;*Relatively faithful to Thomas Harris's novel, the Red Dragon arc stands apart from both its cinematic adaptations with its own aesthetic, its extreme patience of character development, and the human portrayal of Francis Dolarhyde by Richard Armitage, who apes neither Ralph Fiennes's exaggerated performance nor Tom Noonan's detached psychopath. His is the first truly pitiable Red Dragon, a man constantly fighting back his madness, and losing nearly every time. Francis's relationship with the blind Reba (Rutina Wesley) no longer feels like a blatant signifier for his struggle, but a real connection with consequences for both people when his illness gets the better of him.*

* [Bryan Fuller gave an exclusive interview](http://wegotthiscovered.com/tv/exclusive-interview-bryan-fuller-talks-hannibal-season-3/) with We Got This Covered regarding Hannibal S3. Relevant excerpts follow:

&gt;WGTC: *Can you open up about whoâ€™s going to be on those commentaries?*

&gt;BF: *Yes! Thereâ€™s commentaries with Hugh Dancy, and Richard Armitage, and Rutina Wesley, and even Patton Oswalt drops in on a commentary for episode two. Thereâ€™s a lot of fun had in those conversations thatâ€™s essentially conversations with myself and the actors. Gillian Anderson did a commentary, so we had quite a few of the actors participating.*

...

&gt;WGTC: *Notably, you skip over Francis Dolarhydeâ€™s origins from the book. Was that because of time, or something that worked better for the character?*

&gt;BF: *Well, I think the trouble would have been for us giving so much to a child actorâ€¦my concern was finding the right child actor, and then seeing that child actor in Richard Armitage, which could convolute the character in some ways. And I felt it was better to get a glimpse of it and understand that Richard Armitage is Francis Dolarhyde, and not spend too much time with anybody else being Dolarhyde.*

* Vulture lists [Hannibal as their number 1 Best TV Shows of 2015](http://www.vulture.com/2015/12/10-best-tv-shows-of-2015.html#)

&gt;*Other series were more comprehensible, and nearly all were less gore-soaked, but none was as consistently innovative and sublime as Bryan Fullerâ€™s take on Thomas Harrisâ€™s fiction. This visionary drama evoked German Expressionist cinema, glossy-pretentious art-house pictures like The Hunger and Zentropa, super-sexy fanfiction, and even experimental film. Long stretches surrendered to pure sensation, cutting images together in a free-associative rather than literal way. The third season of this lamentably canceled series was really two seasons: the first following Hannibal Lecter (Mads Mikkelsen) to Florence (the basic plot of the book Hannibal) and the second revisiting the plot of Red Dragon/Manhunter (with Richard Armitage as the terrifying yet pitiable Francis Dolarhyde). The climactic showdown between Dolarhyde, Hannibal, and the doctorâ€™s nemesis/pupil/platonic love interest Will Graham (Hugh Dancy) was the most orgiastic display of choreography, music, lighting, and gore since the glory years of Miami Vice; Fuller might as well have reached through the screen and handed viewers a cigarette and a towel.*

* Is there stroke lag, or is the response instantaneous?

* The iWork11 seems to come with Windows 8 32-bit rather than 64-bit, is there a way to either change this to 64-bit or upgrade the OS to Windows 10 with little or no extra cost?

* How long does the battery last when using a drawing program for several hours straight?

* How is it in terms of longevity? Any hardware problems encountered so far?

&gt;**Gag Reel** (1080p; 8:47)


**Disc Two**

&gt;**Audio Commentaries:**

&gt;* Dolce with Bryan Fuller, Steve Lightfoot and Don Mancini

* Watchmojo.com lists Richard as third in their [list of actors they'd like to see play the next Bond](http://watchmojo.com/video/id/14634/). Relevent excerpt:

&gt;3: Richard Armitage

&gt;*We're fascinated with what this actor's portrayal of Bond could be because we really wouldn't know what to expect. And this is all part of Richard Armitage's allure. He's been placed in so many conflicting roles, it's hard to confine him to one type of character, which could very well be the key that unlocks all the faces of Bond we've yet to see. While Armitage has primarily stuck to television, his movie and many theater performances have far from disappointed.*

* [GamesRadar features Richard among the list of possible actors to be the next Bond](http://www.gamesradar.com/who-could-be-next-james-bond/). Relevant excerpt:

&gt;*Before The Hobbit trilogy, Armitage was best known for Spooks and the BBC's muddled Robin Hood, where he played Guy of Gisborne. Appearances on The Vicar Of Dibley further cemented his status as a telly hunk, but perhaps that was all. But then Dwarf King Thorin Oakenshield came along and gave his career a big old boost (ironic, given the character's diminutive stature). Bond would be another serious step up in his career, but he's more than capable of making the leap, and his recent turn in Hannibal as Francis Dolarhyde was another versatile performance. An outside choice, perhaps, but we think he'd be a good one.*


* [Richard tweets](https://twitter.com/RCArmitage/status/655052342140649472) that Hannibal Season 3 is now available from Amazon in the UK

* Urban and the Shed Crew's recently announced third screening (which Richard and the cast will also be attending) [is now sold out](http://www.leedsfilm.com/films/urban-and-the-shed-crew/).

&gt;All credit again to Richard Armitage for his powerful portrayal of Dolarhyde, which, even in these final gore-soaked moments, elicits a strong sense of sympathy. As he lies bleeding to death on Hannibal’s patio, his life leaking out of him in one final dragon wing pattern, the look on his face is both pained and mildly ecstatic.

**More Notable Excerpts from the Hannibal Finale and Season Overview Reviews**

**1)** IGN: [HANNIBAL: SEASON 3 REVIEW Love Crime](http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/04/hannibal-season-3-review)
&gt;But this was creepy, intense storytelling through and through, with Richard Armitage bringing just the right mix of scary and semi-sympathetic as Francis Dolarhyde, a murderous, delusional monster who was at war with the potentially loving man somewhere deep inside him – a war amplified as Dolarhyde fell for the blind Reba (a strong Rutina Wesley), even as “the Dragon” was coming to life within him, compelling him to kill.

**2)** FASTNBOOLBUS: [Cantankerous Critic: Hannibal Season 3](https://fastnboolbus.wordpress.com/2015/09/01/cantankerous-critic-hannibal-season-3/)
&gt;Francis Dolarhyde was incredibly well done in the show, as was Reba McClane. Their performances were the driving force behind the Red Dragon arc. Richard Armitage’s performance was visceral and evocative, and you can sign me up for his fanbase after his stint as the Great Red Dragon.

**3)** (audio) [Eat the Rudecast's Hannibal finale podcast episode](http://eattherudecast.com/hannibal-s03e13-the-wrath-of-the-lamb-eat-the-rudecast/) touched upon Richard's performance starting at 13:30


**4)** Geeks of Doom: [TV Review: Hannibal 3.13 “The Wrath of the Lamb” \(Series Finale\)](http://www.geeksofdoom.com/2015/08/30/tv-review-hannibal-3-13-wrath-lamb-series-finale) 
&gt;I can’t heap enough praise on Richard Armitage’s performance. He’s a fascinating actor. While his presence in The Hobbit film trilogy ultimately fell flat for me (a symptom of three overwrought and frankly unnecessary films), his guest arc has made me very eager to see where he’ll end up next.
 
**5)** Inquisitr: [Richard Armitage Wows Audiences in 'Hannibal' Finale, The 'Red Dragon' Goes Out With A Bang](http://www.inquisitr.com/2381005/richard-armitage-wows-audiences-in-hannibal-finale-the-red-dragon-goes-out-with-a-bang/)
 
&gt;Throughout Season 3 of Hannibal, Richard Armitage proved that showrunner Bryan Fuller made the right choice when he cast him as Dolarhyde. According to the 44-year-old British actor, he had the liberty of making the character his own, and boy, did he go above and beyond.
 
**6)** TV Fanatic: [Hannibal Season 3 Episode 13 Review: The Wrath of the Lamb](http://www.tvfanatic.com/2015/08/hannibal-season-3-episode-13-review-the-wrath-of-the-lamb/) 
&gt;The Red Dragon scenes were all pretty fantastic, and Richard Armitage delivered as he always does. I quite enjoyed his pow-wow with Will and his last scenes with Reba. He convinced me every single time he was on screen. I could have used a little more Dragon.

**7)** PopMatters: [How Hannibal Turned Into a Modern Television Classic](http://www.popmatters.com/feature/196863-this-is-my-design-how-hannibal-turned-into-a-modern-television-class/)
&gt;Yet “taking risks” is one thing, “awe” is another. In Francis Dolarhyde, the murderer known as the Great Red Dragon, we have one of Harris’ greatest quotations: “Fear is not what you owe me. You owe me awe!” Three great actors have uttered this, from Tom Noonan in the original 1986 feature Maneater to Ralph Fiennes in the 2002 adaptation, Red Dragon. Yet in Richard Armitage, Harris’ second most well-known creation is perhaps given its ultimate form, terrifying but ultimately tortured by the dragon he feels lurks inside him.

&gt;We have multiple visuals of Armitage pacing around as the dragon, with the image of demonic wings that help connect us with his fractured mental state. Yet perhaps even more awe-inspiring is when we first meet him, pouring over reels of candid film that Dolarhyde has made of the families he inevitably slaughtered, and suffering a breakdown while doing so. The celluloid wraps around his head, light shooting from his eyes and mouth, himself turning into the projector in an act of Croenenberg-esque body horror.

**8)** FlickFilosopher: [Hannibal: the thrill is the terror, and the terror is the thrill](http://www.flickfilosopher.com/2015/08/hannibal-thrill-is-the-terror-and-the-terror-is-the-thrill.html)
&gt;I’ve only seen Season 3, and I confess: the only reason I watched is because it features Richard Armitage. I think he’s amazing, and I worry that he is not being offered the sorts of roles that take advantage of his presence, which is considerable and rather ominous but not something there’s a lot of room for in our hidebound pop culture. I needn’t have worried in this case, because his Francis Dolarhyde — the serial killer who fancies himself a Great Red Dragon — is a weirdly delicate and very chilling combination of pathos and rage, of vulnerability and power (scary, terrible power), of (on our part) fascination and repugnance. I renew my contention that Armitage is amazing, and I hope to see him in more roles like this.

It was very exciting to cast Richard Armitage and Rutina Wesley in those roles, and really focus on them as characters worthy of the rest of the incredible cast of characters on the show, and tell their story equally with the stories we were telling with Will and Hannibal and Bedelia and Alana and Jack.*

**Notable Excerpts from the Hannibal Finale Reviews**

**1)** Fathers on Holy Gore: [Hannibal – Season 3, Episode 13: “The Wrath of the Lamb”](https://fathersonholygore.wordpress.com/2015/08/28/hannibal-season-3-episode-13-the-wrath-of-the-lamb/)
&gt;Also, both Armitage and Wesley are in their best form here yet. Although we’ve seen a ton from these two, especially Francis, the emotional intensity running through these moments is so palpable, it’s nearly gritting between your teeth. The tears in the eyes of Francis, the lump in his throat, as he sets things alight, it is terrifying beautiful. Armitage has done more than his share of terrific acting over his 6 episode arc and I’m so happy he was a part of Hannibal during its impressive run.

**2)** TV Fanatic: [Hannibal Season 3 Episode 13 Review: The Wrath of the Lamb](http://www.tvfanatic.com/2015/08/hannibal-season-3-episode-13-review-the-wrath-of-the-lamb/)
&gt;The Red Dragon scenes were all pretty fantastic, and Richard Armitage delivered as he always does. I quite enjoyed his pow-wow with Will and his last scenes with Reba. He convinced me every single time he was on screen. I could have used a little more Dragon.

**3)** Hypable: [‘Hannibal’ season 3, episode 13 recap: Who holds the devil?](http://www.hypable.com/hannibal-season-3-episode-13-recap/)
&gt;For six weeks, Richard Armitage’s Red Dragon performances (Emmy-worhty in an ideal/fair world), seized the focus of Hannibal‘s final arc.

**4)** TV.com: [Hannibal Series Finale Review: Guess Who's Coming to Dinner](http://www.tv.com/shows/hannibal-2012/community/post/hannibal-season-3-episode-13-series-finale-the-wrath-of-the-lamb-review-144045187295/)
&gt;I've already discussed Richard Armitage, Rutina Wesley, and Raúl Esparza's work this season so I won't rehash that save to say they were all very, very good, and Armitage, especially, had to do a lot of heavy lifting to make sure the Francis stuff worked at all, and he did that. 

**5)** Collider: [‘Hannibal’ Series Finale Recap: “The Wrath of the Lamb”](http://collider.com/hannibal-series-finale-recap-the-wrath-of-the-lamb/)
&gt;Wesley and Armitage’s characters make for an, er, complicated romance, one that’s more viscerally realized and emotionally lacerating than even Joan Allen and Tom Noonan‘s take on the same characters in Michael Mann‘s Manhunter.
 

**More Notable Excerps from Hannibal Season 3 Episode 12 Reviews**

**1)** Geeks of Doom: [TV Review: Hannibal 3.12 “The Number Of The Beast Is 666″](http://www.geeksofdoom.com/2015/08/26/tv-review-hannibal-3-12-number-beast-666)
&gt;The Great Red Dragon is truly great, as Armitage uses this chance to build upon all of the work that’s come before; he’s presenting us with his own masterpiece. The thing that struck me the most is Armitage’s physicality: the way he moves, slinks, and ultimately flies around the room demands that he be noticed. His performance rendered me as helpless as Chilton (Raul Esparza); We were both glued to our seats as the Dragon snarled and spoke and burned us alive.

**2)** TV Minus the TV: [Hannibal #312, “The Number Of The Beast Is 666”](https://randomnerds.com/tv-minus-the-tv-hannibal-controls-your-mind-and-a-mr-robot-pre-finale-podcast/)
&gt;Richard Armitage turns in his finest performance as Dolarhyde yet, believably playing out a scene in which a homicidal maniac attempts to talk his ex-girlfriend out of his house mid-murder. He’s the star of this episode, though Mikkelsen only takes a back seat in terms of face time.

**3)** TV Over Mind: [“You Owe Me Awe!”: A Look at the History of NBC’s Hannibal](http://www.tvovermind.com/hannibal/owe-awe-look-history-nbcs-hannibal-262862)
&gt;As expected, Richard Armitage’s portrayal of Francis Dolarhyde stole the show in this half of the season, and the length of a television show allows for such an intimate look at a character that just isn’t possible in a film. 

**4)** PopWrapped: [HANNIBAL 3×12: “THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST IS 666”](http://popwrapped.com/news/101763/hannibal-3x12-number-beast-666/)
&gt;Richard Armitage and Raul Esparza delivered truly magnificent performances and  I simply could not tear my eyes away from the television screen (even when Chilton got his lips ripped off).

**5)** Paste Magazine: [Hannibal Review: “The Number of the Beast is 666""](http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/08/hannibal-review-the-number-of-the-beast-is-666.html)
&gt;Above all else, the scene provides the ultimate showcase for both Richard Armitage and Raul Esparza. Over the past five weeks, Armitage has demonstrated himself to be an actor capable of both great menace and sensitivity. Here, we get “menace” levels turned to 11. It’s a performance of such raw animalistic rage that when the scene ends with him literally biting a chunk of Chilton’s face off, it makes a certain amount of logical sense. Likewise, Esparza plays the perfect victim, his face an expressive canvas of paralyzing fear.

**6)** TV Junkies: [HANNIBAL: YOU OWE ME AWE](http://www.thetvjunkies.com/hannibal-the-number-of-the-beast-is-666/?utm_content=buffer622d2&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer)

&gt;I’ve mentioned earlier that Armitage manages to play some of the Red Dragon’s more over-the-top behavior in a way that still somehow manages to keep the horror of the listener/reader intact. It’s really a marvel to watch, and a lot of this success is owed to his total committal to the character — Armitage doesn’t hold back in the slightest, therefore the character is truly believable in his madness, and therefore he is realistically terrifying.

&gt;This was certainly the experience with this week’s attack on Chilton. Armitage’s very specific manner of speaking as the Great Red Dragon is absolutely chilling.

&gt;From his pregnant pauses and the laborious way he pronounces many of his sentences, Armitage’s Dragon is never silly. The way he loomed over Chilton with his mask half-on and half-off, the way he climbed over the couch like an actual animal, with his prosthetic dragon’s maw, to take a bite out of Chilton’s already messed up face: it was all so perfect.

**7)** TV Fanatic: [Hannibal Season 3 Episode 12 Review: The Number of the Beast is 666](http://www.tvfanatic.com/2015/08/hannibal-season-3-episode-12-review-the-number-of-the-beast-is-6/)
&gt;The scenes between Raúl Esparza and Richard Armitage were captivating. I found myself feeling Chilton's terror as he faced The Red Dragon, as Francis Dolarhyde towered over him, imposing, intimidating, threatening. The horror in Chilton's face as he realized he was stuck to the chair was palpable. The acting between those two was magnificent.

**8)** Eat the Rudecast: [Hannibal S03E12 – The Number of the Beast is 666 – Eat The Rudecast](http://eattherudecast.com/hannibal-s03e12-the-number-of-the-beast-is-666-eat-the-rudecast/), discussion of Richard Armitage's performance starts at 55:50

**9)** TV.com: [Hannibal ""The Number of the Beast is 666"" Review: No Pets Allowed](http://www.tv.com/shows/hannibal-2012/community/post/hannibal-season-3-episode-11-the-number-of-the-beast-is-666-review-143993305868/)
&gt;Last week, I touched briefly on how well I thought Richard Armitage was doing with Francis Dolarhyde, and that continued here, but in a different way. We've seen him as Dolarhyde for pretty much the entirety of the run so far, but this was the first time we've been granted an extended experience with Armitage as the Great Red Dragon.

&gt;So much of what Dragon should be is defined by what Dolarhyde isn't in front of others. Confident. Deranged. Arrogant. Demanding. Raspy. Contemplative. So it's important that we've seen Dolarhyde, mild-mannered photo and video lab technician, struggle with the Dragon before it's essentially unleashed and had nearly completed its becoming. That contrast was necessary so that this moment was horrifying for us as much as it was for Chilton. Glimmers of Dolarhyde couldn't come out, or it would break the illusion. It's why as the Dragon touched Chilton, it was horrifying for all the obvious reasons, but weird because that body was a body that we've watched refrain and pull away from physical contact. Here, it's sensual and controlled. Even when Reba stopped by to drop off soup, it's not Dolarhyde who answered the door but the Dragon playing Dolarhyde. Armitage simply got it.

**Notable Excerpts from Hannibal Season 3 Episode 12 Reviews**

**1)** 411Mania: Hannibal Review 3.12: [“The Number of the Beast Is 666…”](http://411mania.com/movies/hannibal-review-3-12-the-number-of-the-beast-is-666/)

&gt;Richard Armitage gets a lot more screen time this week as Dolarhyde and he continues to kill it. I know the Emmys have avoided the show like the plague but is there no way we can’t get him some sort of nomination for his work here? He’s outacting everyone, Hugh Dancy included, at this point. I was on the fence before, but I truly think he has the best version of Dolarhyde, beating both Tom Noonan and Ralph Fiennes. He’s progressed from a serial killer that still had human traits at times to something monstrous. He was animal-like before but now he’s achieved his becoming. As he points out to Reba at the end of the episode, now he’s the Dragon. The crazy thing is that you can see him evolve over the course of the season to get there. He’s completely lost it and we witnessed it happen. I wouldn’t be surprised if Reba, who survived before, didn’t make it out of this show alive.


**2)** A.V. Club: [Hannibal: The Number Of The Beast Is 666](http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/hannibal-number-beast-666-224254)

&gt;“The Number Of The Beast 666” was fully Richard Armitage’s episode to command, and command it he did. The voice of the Red Dragon seems to come from a place deep inside of him, rumbling up through his throat. It’s a wholly physical performance that is best embodied by his movement as the Red Dragon, slithering across to bite Chilton. The camera certainly helps him embody this creature: He towers over his prey, Chilton, who is ensnared in the chair. The camera is tilted up to make Francis the beast in complete control. Another beautifully shot image featured Chilton upright, racing Francis, who seems to be horizontal. His body is out of the frame, his head only attached to a long neck, much like the lizard he has become..


**3)** Fathersonholygore: [Hannibal – Season Three, Episode Twelve: “The Number of the Beast is 666”](https://fathersonholygore.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/hannibal-season-three-episode-twelve-the-number-of-the-beast-is-666/)

&gt;Richard Armitage is a blessing. I love to see a role that’s already classic to so many film fans/book readers become a fresh, new vision in the arms of an actor. It just goes to show that many of these modern literary characters and villains we come to enjoy and love so much are similar to stage characters – just as actors, like Armitage and many others who have graced the stage before and continue to do so, play the characters of Shakespeare over and over yet actors bring new things to the role, nowadays actors on television and film can do the same. We have people like Hannibal Lecter, Francis Dolarhyde, and so many more (I won’t go on with all the great literary characters brought to life in film/television – you know there are tons). Here, we get to see Armitage bring that type of sensibility to the small screen. That’s a huge reason of why I love Hannibal, we get highly gifted actors like Armitage, Mikkelsen, and Dancy tackling these well-known characters and giving them new life.


**4)** IGN: [HANNIBAL: ""THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST IS 666"" REVIEW](http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/21/hannibal-the-number-of-the-beast-is-666-review)

&gt;The entire sequence of Dolarhyde holding Chilton hostage was fantastic, with terrific performances from both Raúl Esparza and Richard Armitage. 


**5)** Flickering Myth: [Hannibal Season 3 – Episode 12 Review](http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2015/08/hannibal-season-3-episode-12-review.html)

&gt;Even knowing what was going to happen, the episode was wracked with a tremendous amount of tension due to the great performances by the whole cast, but most notably Richard Armitage and Raul Esparza. As Hannibal’s penultimate episode ‘The Number of The Beast is 666’ may prove to be Hannibal’s best.

 &gt;As stated above, the hostage sequence was quite intense largely due to Armitage and Esparza’s performances. Armitage gave quite a different performance of Francis in this scene than Tom Noonan or Ralph Fiennes did in their respective films, coming off as much more monstrous and animalistic than his predecessors.



**More Notable Excerpts from Hannibal Season 3 Episode 11 Reviews**

**1)** CutPrintFilm: [Hannibal Review: 3.11 “…And the Beast from the Sea”](http://www.cutprintfilm.com/tv/hannibal-review-3-11-and-the-beast-from-the-sea/)

&gt;Richard Armitage delivers his best performance yet here. Dolarhyde gets a lot more dialogue this week than previous episodes, and Armitage nails it all. He’s actually managed to turn the character into a somewhat sympathetic creature. When he was first introduced, Dolarhyde seemed more monster than man. Armitage, over a period of episodes, has been able to subtly and masterfully bring out the humanity lurking in there.

**2)** HitFix: [REVIEW: 'HANNIBAL' - 'AND THE BEAST FROM THE SEA': WHY ARE YOU HITTING YOURSELF?](http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/review-hannibal-and-the-beast-from-the-sea-why-are-you-hitting-yourself)

&gt;That said, this was another winner overall, with Richard Armitage continuing to bring both Dolarhyde and the Dragon to life with his intense physicality. Because we have such a history with Hannibal, it would be easy for Dolarhyde to feel like a distraction, or a plot device to force Will and Hannibal to resume their interactions. But Armitage and the way Fuller, Lightfoot and company have chosen to represent Dolarhyde's madness make him every bit as compelling as our two main characters.

**3)** TV Fanatic: [""Hannibal Season 3 Episode 11 Review: ...And the Beast From the Sea""](http://www.tvfanatic.com/2015/08/hannibal-season-3-episode-11-review-and-the-beast-from-the-sea/)

&gt;Now it's time for our weekly Richard-Armitage-Is-Amazing discussion. That first scene where Francis was being counseled by Hannibal was simply incredible. The transformation from Francis Dolarhyde to The Red Dragon was an absolute beauty to behold.

&gt;In that first scene we got a piano glissando in the score to signal the transformation. However, all the subsequent transitions between Dolarhyde and Dragon were seamless. In every conversation with Reba, he switched between the two versions of himself effortlessly. 

&gt;My favorite visual scene was the fight between Francis Dolarhyde and The Red Dragon. I loved how they showed both his perspective of what was happening and the reality of it. He literally beat himself up over his failure.

**4)** Inquisitr: [""Richard Armitage Shines In Thrilling ‘Hannibal’ Episode ‘And The Beast From The Sea’""](http://www.inquisitr.com/2340114/richard-armitage-shines-in-thrilling-hannibal-episode-and-the-beast-from-the-sea/)

&gt;Richard Armitage shined in the heart-stopping, full of action, edge-of-your-seat Hannibal episode Saturday night, and if you were live tweeting with the show executives, it was also pretty entertaining.

...

&gt;British actor Richard Armitage took his portrayal of Francis Dolarhyde/Red Dragon to a whole new level, and fans were thrilled.

&gt;There’s no question that the star of Saturday’s Hannibal episode was Richard Armitage — who made serial killer Francis Dolarhyde even more of a sympathetic figure, instead of a hated character because of the despicable criminal he really is. 

...

&gt;But what was so stunning about Richard Armitage in Hannibal’s latest episode was that he truly exploited the arc of his troubled character. The 43-year-old actor put all the different and terrifying personalities that make up Francis into action, and it was simply breathtaking. It was explained on Twitter that Armitage did those handstand pushups unassisted multiple times. Some other interesting tidbits were shared by sound department staffer Sean Armstrong on Twitter.

&gt;Francis beats himself up — literally — for getting involved with Reba, and in his twisted mind, holds a session on Doctor Lecter’s (Mads Mikkelsen) couch trying to put his feelings into words.


**5)** TV Junkies: [""HANNIBAL: HE ATE IT UP""](http://www.thetvjunkies.com/hannibal-and-the-beast-from-the-sea/)

&gt;I’m beginning to sound like a broken record, but oh my, Richard Armitage. To fully embody such an enigmatic, strange character and make him such a stand-out in only a handful of episodes is really an achievement. On top of that, the Red Dragon has been portrayed several times before and yet Armitage’s performance still manages to impress.

...

&gt;The imagined scene of Dolarhyde’s “Red Dragon” beating him unconscious (interspersed with the realistic scene of Francis knocking himself around) was surprisingly well done. A scene like that could have come across as hokey (“Stop hitting yourself, stop hitting yourself!”) but it came across as the tragic moment it was — he had attempted to conquer his demon (his dragon) by forcing it (unsuccessfully) on the Grahams, but it came back full force and knocked the hell out of him. That was the moment he knew that Reba had to go, for her own good.


**6)** Hypable: [""‘Hannibal’ season 3, episode 11 recap: Kill them all""](http://www.hypable.com/hannibal-season-3-episode-11-recap/)

&gt;In a pseudo session with Hannibal Dolarhyde speaks for the longest time we’ve heard yet. The compelling narrative Richard Armitage was able to create using his body is only enhanced watching him explain his internal struggle to Dr. Lecter. His voice is heavy and low bearing the weight of his constant internal struggle to fight the Dragon.

**7)** CarterMatt.com:[‘Hannibal’ season 3, episode 11 review: The Great Red Dragon hits home for Will Graham](http://cartermatt.com/175850/hannibal-season-3-episode-11-review-the-great-red-dragon-hits-home-for-will-graham/)

&gt;Hugh Dancy and Mads Mikkelsen are as brilliant as ever, while Richard Armitage almost effortlessly brings some of the magnetism to the Francis Dolarhyde role. He is terrifying, but in a different way than Dr. Lecter. He has gone done a different rabbit hole of insanity, one where his personalities are severing and he feels as though he can bring about great change for others in the same way as himself.

**8)** Yahoo! TV: [15 Shows That Made This the Best TV Summer Ever](https://www.yahoo.com/tv/15-shows-that-made-this-c1439949112765/photo-hannibal-nbc-photo-1439936968520.html)

&gt;And now we get to see an imprisoned Hannibal and Will actually join forces to catch a new killer: the demented Francis Dolarhyde (in a fearsome performance by Richard Armitage). A triumphant final act for one of TV's strangest and most satisfying dramas.

[Episode 8 The Great Red Dragon](http://janicepoonart.blogspot.com.ar/2015/07/episode-8-great-red-dragon.html):
&gt;By the way, I can see why Richard Armitage has such a loyal fan base. Not only is he a gifted and dedicated actor, he is a wonderful man. All the crew adored him - especially Hair Department's - talented Karola Dirnberger and Make-up's sweet Katie Brennan. (Hello: daily tattoo application/removal)

[Episode 9: Woman Clothed With the Sun](http://janicepoonart.blogspot.com.ar/2015/08/episode-9-woman-clothed-with-sun.html):
&gt;On the plus side, it was my first time on set with Richard Armitage who is thoroughly charming and courteous.

[Episode 10: Woman Clothed in the Sun](http://janicepoonart.blogspot.com.ar/2015/08/episode-10-woman-clothed-in-sun.html?m=1):
&gt;When we shot the scene, Richard Armitage wanted to get it perfect so he ate a real paper print as well. And that's why we love him.

[FeedingHannibal](https://twitter.com/FeedingHannibal/status/630973653157588992):
&gt;The whole crew loved working with Richard. Full of awe and respect for his formidable talent.

**Notable Excerpts:**

**1)** TV Equals: [‘Hannibal’ \(Season 3\): Past is Prologue](http://www.tvequals.com/2015/08/12/hannibal-season-3-past-is-prologue/)

&gt;He’s only been in three episodes at this point, but Richard Armitage has already become an integral part of the Hannibal universe, bringing a more savage type of killer for Will and the FBI to have to hunt down.

&gt;Richard Armitage is doing stellar work as Dolarhyde, and because we know everyone else so well, the show can indulge in multiple acts dedicated to his activities before returning to our main characters. 


**2)** HitFix: [Review: 'Hannibal' - 'and the Woman Clothed in Sun'](http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/review-hannibal-and-the-woman-clothed-in-sun-the-mouth-of-hell)

&gt;Fortunately, this one didn't disappoint, as both Rutina Wesley and Richard Armitage conveyed the overwhelming emotions both were feeling in this unusual moment. Sensuality from unlikely sources has always been a ""Hannibal"" strength, so I didn't doubt they would do this moment right, but it was still great to see, hear, and feel. (And the emphasis on Dolarhyde's reaction to Reba touching the tiger's mouth, given his self-consciousness about his own, in some ways conveyed the point even better than the Mann version.)

**3)** Film and TV Now: [""Hannibal: And the Woman Clothed In Sun Review S03E10""](http://www.filmandtvnow.com/hannibal-and-the-woman-clothed-in-sun-review-s03e10/)

&gt;Richard Armitage certainly gives an interesting performance in this role. It's certainly a hard one to play and can easily come off as cartoony, but he balances the nuances well, delivering to us a depiction of a very tortured and unfortunate soul. He's a stark contrast to everything that Doctor Lecter is.


**4)** Digital Spy: [""Hannibal season 3 episode 10 recap: '...And the Woman Clothed in Sun'](http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/s225/hannibal/recaps/a662511/hannibal-season-3-episode-10-recap-and-the-woman-clothed-in-sun.html#~pkRy9WxlBcDHcT)

&gt;Both Richard Armitage and Rutina Wesley did beautiful work in that zoo scene, where Reba touches the unconscious tiger's face and mouth, and Francis is momentarily overwhelmed by the emotion of it because in that moment it's his twisted jaw she's caressing. The actors and writers have done a fairly remarkable job of making us care about this romance in the space of just two episodes, and this scene becomes more moving moments later as Reba lays her head against Francis just like the tiger, wordlessly soothing his distorted self-image.


**5)** Collider: [""HANNIBAL Season 3 Recap: And The Woman Clothed in Sun""](http://collider.com/hannibal-season-3-episode-10-recap-and-the-woman-clothed-in-the-sun/)

&gt;The entire episode belonged to Armitage and Wesley, who play out the intimate connection between these two wounded creatures with tremendous care, though both performers make their more animalistic attractions to each other's character more than clear. 

**6)** Inquisitr: [""Richard Armitage Transformed Into The ˜Red Dragon In Riveting ˜Hannibal Episode""](http://www.inquisitr.com/2320968/richard-armitage-transformed-into-the-red-dragon-in-riveting-hannibal-episode/)

&gt;Fans were anticipating Richard Armitage's complete transformation into the beast after they got a little peek last week, and they weren't disappointed. The British actor clearly stole the night, and those who have followed him for a long time couldn't be happier that the rest of us now realize what an incredible talent this man is.

...

&gt;Sexy wouldn't begin to describe the scene between Richard Armitage and Rutina Wesley, as the blind woman uses her hands to feel the beautiful animal she cannot see. Francis is entranced and probably shocked at what he is feeling and how these feelings for Reba are affecting his well laid out plans to continue his murderous spree.

...

&gt;Richard Armitage transformed into the 'Red Dragon' and audiences paid attention. The 42-year-old actor also spoke more than in any other episode, and it was masterful in a role unlike anything the talented actor has ever done before. The scene in which he is shown practicing his speech is perfect. Why did NBC cancel this series again?



**7)** Flickering Myth: [""Hannibal Season 3 – Episode 10 Review""](http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2015/08/hannibal-season-3-episode-10-review.html)
&gt;Richard Armitage and Rutina Wesley showed a lot of great chemistry with each other during their scenes, showcasing how these two physically broken people can connect on a very personal level. 

**8)** CutPrintFilm: [Hannibal Review: 3.11 “…And the Beast from the Sea”](http://www.cutprintfilm.com/tv/hannibal-review-3-11-and-the-beast-from-the-sea/)

&gt;Richard Armitage delivers his best performance yet here. Dolarhyde gets a lot more dialogue this week than previous episodes, and Armitage nails it all. He’s actually managed to turn the character into a somewhat sympathetic creature. When he was first introduced, Dolarhyde seemed more monster than man. Armitage, over a period of episodes, has been able to subtly and masterfully bring out the humanity lurking in there.

**Notable Excerpts:**

**1)** Flickering Myth: [""Hannibal Season 3 – Episode 11 Review""](http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2015/08/hannibal-season-3-episode-11-review.html)

&gt;Richard Armitage was both suitably creepy and sympathetic. This was the first time we saw firsthand Francis on the hunt as he stalked Molly and her son. The scene was very suspenseful, evoking classic horror-slasher films from the 70s and 80s. Armitage’s performance during this sequence was especially impressive since it was mostly silent, relying on his movement and body language to convey Francis’ feelings.

**2)** Dork Shelf: [""Hannibal 3.11 Recap""](http://dorkshelf.com/2015/08/14/hannibal-3-11-recap/)

&gt;Francis, meanwhile, fears so much what he is becoming with the help of Hannibal, that he breaks up with Reba before making the aforementioned call to his therapist. Both scenes showcase Richard Armitage deftly handling material that could so easily produce embarrassed laughs from an audience. As it is though, seeing Armitage fluctuate seamlessly between tears, cold silence and monstrous threats is chilling and heartbreaking. Add in Rutina Wesley’s confident and scared performance of Reba McClane and it’s hard not to get teary eyed in these scenes.

&gt;Armitage and Wesley are such a natural addition to the show that it’s difficult to feel like it doesn’t belong to them (though it occurs to me that if Hannibal Lecter were to read that sentence I’d probably be in a bit of trouble). 


**3)** Fathersonholygore: [""Hannibal – Season Three, Episode Eleven: “…And the Beast from the Sea”""](https://fathersonholygore.wordpress.com/2015/08/14/hannibal-season-three-episode-eleven-and-the-beast-from-the-sea/)

&gt;Armitage continually proves he has the chops. Incredible actor. Not only is the physicality he’s bringing to the role of Francis Dolarhyde marvellous, the gentle and quiet way in which he portrays the madness of Dolarhyde is a revelation. Again, as I’ve said before, I love both Tom Noonan and Ralph Fiennes in their respective performances – Manhunter and Red Dragon – however, it’s Armitage who is able to bring the full scope of emotions, the density of the torment and suffering inside the character into our eyes right before us.

&gt;Scenes with Francis and Reba (Rutina Wesley) are very tense in this episode. Dolarhyde, in a scene familiar to many, watches some ‘homework’, as Reba lays in his lap drinking with him. All the while, Francis is watching footage of his possible next victims: through the frame walks Molly Graham (Nina Arianda). DAMN! Not that I wasn’t expecting it, but still – chilling, to say the least.

...

&gt;In this amazing episode, we actually see a physical fight between Francis and the Dragon. We get little bits of him fighting the fictional image of the Dragon, juxtaposed with the reality: he is beating the life out of himself. Dolarhyde beats himself bloody onto the floor. One of my favourites thus far including Armitage.



**4)** Bustle: [""Can Will Catch The Tooth Fairy On 'Hannibal'? They're On A Collision Course As The Series Comes To An End""](http://www.bustle.com/articles/103926-can-will-catch-the-tooth-fairy-on-hannibal-theyre-on-a-collision-course-as-the-series)

&gt;It's a testament to both Fuller's storytelling abilities and actor Richard Armitage's terrific portrayal that we can have sympathy for such a vile murderer. 


**5)** TV.com: [""Hannibal ""...And the Beast From the Sea"" Review: Holding Onto the Good""](http://www.tv.com/shows/hannibal-2012/community/post/hannibal-season-3-episode-11-and-the-beast-from-the-sea-review-143966496877/)
&gt;The lack of exploration for why Dolarhyde is the way he is should make things a bit fuzzy, but it's a credit to Richard Armitage as Dolarhyde, Rutina Wesley as Reba, and the thematic structure of this season that that question doesn't prove to be a huge barrier to the arc's momentum. Armitage has been doing really fine physical work, contorting and shifting his body to express the Dragon seeking to free itself from Dolarhyde's puny mortal frame all season. With last week's episode and now this week's, he's had the opportunity to dig into expressing Dolarhyde's fears and concerns about whether or not he even needs the Dragon any longer. He's found someone to love him, someone who could transform him that way instead of him transforming others, and in very sacrificial ways. Again, the why would fill in a gap, but Armitage has played the division within himself so well that it almost hardly matters. 

**6)** Collider: [""HANNIBAL Season 3 Recap: “…And the Beast From the Sea”""](http://collider.com/hannibal-season-3-episode-11-recap-and-the-beast-from-the-sea/)
&gt;Wesley and Armitage built such magnificent tension during their break-up in Reba’s dark room, clearly outlining the confusion and conflicting feelings in each character, but there was also a palpable vulnerability to the scene, which actually made Dolarhyde into an empathetic figure. Invoking such feelings is not an easy task considering Armitage’s character shot Molly and gunned down an innocent bystander a few scenes beforehand.

&gt;I wanted to share my experience meeting #RichardArmitage on the set of #Hannibal I was a background performer that is told not to talk to the stars and leave them alone on set. When shooting this seen between takes Richard Armitage decided he would take off his glove and shake my hand and introduce himself. At the time I felt honoured that he would take the time to do so and we chatted a bit about my suit jacket and common talk. It made me feel comfortable being there and really made me feel good. I had no idea who he was. After shooting I went back to background holding and realized that he was an actor in #TheHobbit movies and I lost my mind... Anyone that knows me knows I watch these movies every week. I just wanted to say that in this life you never know who you will meet that will inspire you so don't ever stop believing that things will not change. #djkwes #inspiration #TV #positivepeople @hannibaltvseries @richardarmitage71

**Notable Excerpts:**

**1)** Inquisitr: [""Richard Armitage Continues To Impress With His 'Red Dragon' Portrayal in 'Hannibal'""](http://www.inquisitr.com/2302050/richard-armitage-continues-to-impress-with-his-red-dragon-portrayal-in-hannibal/)

&gt;Viewers met the Red Dragon last week, in the second part of the cancelled series, and even though the British actor didn’t use his deep baritone voice at all, one could say he stole the show. His heartbreaking introduction left his fans in awe of his physical strength, displayed in the difficult movements his body was able to perform as part of his transformation.

...

&gt;Richard Armitage finally spoke on Saturday night’s episode, called “And The Woman Clothed With the Sun.” The lisp Harris describes in his novel was done perfectly, and it was actually painful to watch him struggle with his words. That is one of the things Armitage said he wanted to do, make Dolarhyde an empathetic character, despite the horrible crimes he commits.

...

&gt;Richard Armitage is proving he is a force to be reckoned with when he’s on-screen, and with all that was going on in Hannibal episode 309, it’s not an easy task. 


**2)** Vulture: [""Hannibal Recap: Trust Me, I'm Smiling""](http://www.vulture.com/2015/08/hannibal-recap-season-3-episode-9.html?mid=twitter-share-vulture)

&gt;Richard Armitage’s Dolarhyde displays none of the Wellesian ham of the character’s previous incarnations. Notice how he jitters, how he can’t sustain eye contact. He’s twitchy yet sensitive, menacing because we know what he can do, though nothing in his scenes with Reba convey malice. His face contorts, unsure how to express emotion. He eats as though he’s afraid someone might take away his food – the way a stray dog eats.


**3)** CutPrintFilm: [""Hannibal Review: 3.09 “…And the Woman Clothed with the Sun”""](http://www.cutprintfilm.com/tv/hannibal-review-3-09-and-the-woman-clothed-with-the-sun/)

&gt;As for Dolarhyde, Hannibal once again makes great use of Armitage’s body-language — all twisted muscle and clenched fists. There’s a wonderful, Cronenberg-ian moment when we even see a big, fleshy tail snaking its way out of Dolarhyde’s back. 

...

&gt;— Speaking of that phone call at the end, Armitage’s delivery of what he is becoming, “The Great. Red. DRAGON!” is wonderful in how monstrous it sounds.


**4)** The TV Junkies: [""HANNIBAL: WHAT ARE YOU BECOMING""](http://www.thetvjunkies.com/hannibal-and-the-woman-clothed-with-the-sun/)

&gt;Richard Armitage continues to impress in the role of Dolarhyde. He has the voice, in particular, down pat. The ending scene, where he calls and speaks with Hannibal, was completely terrifying. You can really hear just how unhinged Dolarhyde truly is. The way he growled “The Great Red Dragon” in response to Hannibal’s “What are you becoming?” was just… chills-inducing. Excelltent.



**5)** [Starpulse: ""'Hannibal' Recap: Wait, The Great Red Dragon Is… A Real Dragon?""](http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2015/08/02/hannibal-recap-wait-the-great-red-drag)

&gt;Equally terrific: our further look at Francis Dolarhyde.

&gt;It's like Hannibal is toying with us. Last week, it set up that Dolarhyde is a totally deranged, will-bathe-in-your-blood-while-screaming serial killer. This week, the show pointed him like a loaded gun at various characters, but lingered on the trigger.

&gt;IS HE GOING TO KILL SOMEONE? The answer is no, unless that poor blind woman tried to dig too deep into his psyche and ended up painted across the walls.

&gt;(Also, you've got to love the bus stop poster when she climbed into Dolarhyde's serial killer van- ""Open Wide and Say AAAAAH!"").

&gt;But Dolarhyde might be aiming at Will. Or Hannibal. Or Freddie Lounds. Or the blind lady, if she made it to next week. All with great potential. And all promising more of Richard Armitage's simmering-just-below-the-surface murder rage. Acting-wise, that guy's a formidable foe to Mikkelsen.


**6)** Paste Magazine: [""Hannibal Review: “And the Woman Clothed with the Sun…”""](http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/08/hannibal-review-and-the-woman-clothed-with-the-sun.html)

&gt;What remains undeniably fantastic is any scene involving Richard Armitage’s Francis Dolarhyde. Given that Hannibal can be so obsessively centered on its major characters, it’s clear that Bryan Fuller and his writers are having a ball exploring the new blood that is this character. This becomes apparent in their decision to really swing for the fence when it comes to embracing the crazier elements of the novel. This includes, in a scene depicting Dolarhyde’s “transformation” into his Red Dragon persona, actually having a dragon’s tail sliver into frame, and thus turning the character’s mental procedure into a literal one.

&gt;Most notably, of course, is that the episode marks Dolaryhyde’s first encounter with Reba, the blind woman who will become a pivotal figure in his life. It’s through this encounter, after an episode and a half of silence, that we finally hear the man speak—something he’s been reluctant to do given his insecurity about his voice. And while Reba maybe seems a bit too trusting in choosing to accept a ride home from Dolarhyde, even if he is a work colleague, their interaction in the kitchen goes a long way to setting a stage for a real emotional connection between the two. Both have had to deal with disabilities that set them apart from the mainstream—Reba with losing her sight and Dolarhyde with the mental scarring of his upbringing—and both flatly reject demonstrations of pity. When Reba asks to touch Dolarhyde’s face to see if he’s smiling, the way in which Armitage delivers the line “Trust me, I’m smiling…” manages to somehow be simultaneously eerie and heartbreaking.

&gt;There is a moment in ‘…And the Woman Clothed with the Sun,’ where Richard Armitage’s Francis Dolarhyde asks Rutina Wesley’s Reba McClane if he may have a plum. Chances are Francis doesn’t really want a piece of fruit (though you never know, they did look delicious); he was simply interested in breaking the ice with the lovely film developer before him, and asking for a plum was his way of doing that. The inherent symbolism of ripe fruit aside, the episode’s writers have keyed in on a subtle, but potent way to make their serial killer more sympathetic. There is something incredibly vulnerable and childlike in the way Francis asks for permission to take and eat a piece of fruit; it’s something that is there anytime an individual must ask for whatever he or she wants, especially when the conversation has nothing to do with the item in question. And for whatever reason, an adult, asking for food – from someone who is more or less a stranger – places him or her in a position where they may feel particularly exposed. How awkward would it be if the recipient of the question said “no”?

&gt;Asking for a piece of fruit is Francis’ first precarious step in building familiarity. This person cares enough to see that I am fed and made happy, how far does that compassion go? And for someone as shy as Francis is, well, he may as well have asked Reba to marry him. In other words, there is an incredible amount of intimacy packed into a single scene between two people discussing infrared film in a darkroom. And the idea of intimacy carries over and emerges again and again, during a remarkably affecting episode of Hannibal that is ostensibly all about intimacy – especially the particular kind of emotional intimacy between family members.

&gt;Have I mentioned how much I love seeing Francis Dolarhyde covered in blood that glows black under the light of a full moon? Bonus:we get to see Will gloriously clothed in black blood as well.

&gt;We finally get to hear the voice of Francis Dolarhyde and it’s, pretty much, perfection. Richard Armitage seems to have pulled a Mads Mikkelson and managed to own a role that has already been rightfully owned by two talented actors before him. If there is still any doubt as to the fact that all of the good writing is on tv, the fact that a well known character can still be portrayed in what feels like a fresh way is proof that good writing brings all of the good actors to the yard.

&gt;For his part, Dolarhyde remains a tremendously menacing fixture despite his newfound ability to make friends (or friend, at least). When Reba reaches out to touch his face — on which we can see the surgically repaired traces of the cleft palate that gives him both his speech impediment and his self-esteem issues — to see if he’s frowning or smiling at her, he grabs her arm to stop her. “Trust me, I’m smiling,” he says, stonefaced, able to articulate the appropriate emotional affect but incapable of wearing the mask of sanity that reflects it.

...

&gt;But his finest moment comes at the end of the episode, when he’s triggered by Freddie Lounds’s reports in the Tattler to call up Hannibal and express his admiration. “What are you becoming?” Lecter asks. “The Great…Red…DRAGON!” he growls, and it’s every bit as theatrical and “spooky”-sounding as a child telling the story of the Big Bad Wolf. That’s what he is, more or less — not a cold-blooded murder machine like Hannibal, but the same scared little boy he was at his grandmother’s dinner table, trying to chase the scary stories away by becoming the monster at the end of the book. All Will can do is hope that when the time comes, he can turn that final page.

&gt;How many times can I say it? Richard Armitage is doing a superb job with the character of Francis Dolarhyde. I mean, I’m a massive fan of Ralph Fiennes – total nut for the guy’s filmography, but still… I think because of his performance, and plus the ability to play the character in a handful of episodes as opposed to a single two hour film, Armitage has the advantage here. There’s something about his quiet physicality. It moves me, honestly. Even in the beginning when he’s practicing certain sounds, making sure he can sound appropriate enough to make it through so he can speak to Hannibal, I felt this insanely vulnerable feeling for Dolarhyde. Not that he doesn’t scare me at certain times, but Armitage truly makes me feel bad for the guy. The other incarnations – both Fiennes and also Tom Noonan – really came across with the insane aspects of the character; they didn’t overdo things, they just played it quite well on that end. With Armitage, I’m impressed by how he brings out that vulnerability and the traumatic past so much better. It’s really something to revel in. So glad he was chosen to play this part because even if someone else could’ve done a decent job, Armitage is making Dolarhyde one of the best villains ever on television. The essence of a sympathetic killer, if there ever was one.

...

&gt;When Francis Dolarhyde makes his way into the museum, I got giddy. This has always been one of my favourite things out of Red Dragon, particularly because it shows just how beyond deranged Dolarhyde is, I mean, if it wasn’t sickeningly obvious. It has this fascinating quality that speaks to Dolarhyde’s delusions. Further reinforcing the fact he wants to gain control over the hold the Great Red Dragon has over him.

&gt;Armitage had me just creeped out here, enormously. The teeth come out, he’s sniffing the painting, then starts biting into the thing.

**Notable Excerpts:**

**1)** Den of Geek: [""Hannibal season 3 episode 8 review: Great Red Dragon""](http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/hannibal/36355/hannibal-season-3-episode-8-review-great-red-dragon)

&gt;The first five minutes of The Great Red Dragon convinced me not only to put aside my doubts but has completely reinvigorated my enthusiasm for the series. Armitage is every bit that impressive in the role.

...

&gt;What we get instead in those opening scenes is an intense and spot-on combination of the physical skills of an actor and the careful staging by a director. Armitage’s contemplation of his hands as they form themselves into claws, the labelled watercolor on the cover of Time, the beginning of a look of realisation on the character’s face as he reaches to pick up the magazine and thus reveals his name tag: Francis Dolarhyde. For a full five minutes, there is no dialogue (in fact, the character is on screen a total of about 8 minutes and never speaks an actual word, though his vocalizations are fascinating), and yet we understand: he is undergoing a transformation that both energizes and disturbs him.

&gt;But throughout the episode, Armitage manages to communicate things about his character that props cannot. He is not simply transitioning from one entity to another. He moves between the two. As Dolarhyde, he has a certain bit of Hannibal’s fastidiousness, and yet, he is essentially a nervous person. The dragon, on the other hand, is certain in his movements, the actor’s body taking on a more powerful and distinctly reptilian quality as it goes about its business. He is also not passive in this transformation, the actor showing us that it is not mere compulsion that drives Francis. In the scene with the projector, there is seeking in his expression—he wants to understand what is happening and why (though this desire is frustrated in the end).

&gt;Where Mikkelsen and Dancy have proven themselves adept at conveying a great deal in a look, this was still within the context of a lot of supporting dialogue and narrative. Watching Armitage doing it absent all of the former and much of the latter has highlighted his own skills in a way that little else could. It’s a spectacular introduction of both character and actor to a series where the bar for both is already set quite high.



**2)** Decider: [""Hannibal Recap: And There Came A Great Red Dragon""](http://decider.com/2015/07/27/hannibal-recap-episode-308-the-great-red-dragon/)

&gt;More impressive still is Richard Armitage’s instant-classic work as Francis Dolarhyde — aka the Tooth Fairy, aka the Great Red Dragon — whom he doesn’t so much play as inhabit. In a recent interview, Armitage said he patterned his (so far entirely wordless) performance on Mica Levi’s avant-garde score for Jonathan Glazer’s art-house horror masterpiece Under the Skin. That a main character on a network television show would be based not a performance but the music from one of the most difficult and surreal horror films ever made is remarkable in and of itself. But beyond that, the connection makes perfect sense. Like Under the Skin, Red Dragon concerns an individual in the process of becoming: making, and perhaps unmaking, themselves into a creature driven to commit monstrous crimes. Armitage’s Dolarhyde stares at his own hands as if only now realizing not just their potential but their existence, and mouths formless syllables as if trying to construct not just speech but the meaning behind it. It’s both easy and instructive to see the parallels with Scarlett Johannson’s nameless predator, another beast slouching toward mayhem to be born.


**3)** TrueCrime: [""The ""Tooth Fairy"" Story Debuts on Hannibal, And It's Bloody Fantastic""](http://truecrime.io9.com/the-tooth-fairy-story-debuts-on-hannibal-and-its-blo-1720422163)

&gt;With Lecter behind bars, there’s room for a new handsome/sadistic/exquisitely bizarre killing machine to do his thing on Hannibal. And what an entrance Francis Dolarhyde (Richard Armitage) makes! Welcome, sir, and your obsessions with William Blake, dentistry, fitness, and slaughter.

&gt;After we get a wonderfully wordless intro to Dolarhyde, aka the Tooth Fairy, aka “The Great Red Dragon” for whom this episode is named, we get a more melancholy look at what happened to Hannibal. 

...

&gt;The glass between them cracks, but it’s really a mirror in Dolarhyde’s attic lair that enables us to see a man whose personality is literally fractured. It’s only 10 minutes in, and he hasn’t spoken a word yet, but it’s hard not to be already loving this character and performance: brutal yoga moves, a huge back tattoo applied in what looked like one sitting, picking out false teeth, yowling and growling at a broken mirror, and standing covered in blood under a full moon ... EVERYONE ELSE IS BORING!


**4)** Nerdly: [""‘Hannibal 3×08: The Great Red Dragon’ Review""](http://www.nerdly.co.uk/2015/07/26/hannibal-3x08-the-great-red-dragon-review/)

&gt;Hannibal‘s head-first plunge into its adaptation of Thomas Harris’s Red Dragon also introduces us to a new antagonist, the tortured and orally-fixated Francis Dolarhyde. Richard Armitage plays with his commanding physique to make Dolarhyde a figure of clockwork horror and pitiable derangement. Wordless throughout the episode’s course, Dolarhyde assembles himself before our eyes with skin-crawling slowness. Fixated on William Blake’s famous painting, ‘The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed In the Sun,’ he has the titular dragon tattooed on his back (the tattooing itself shown in uncomfortably sensual slow motion, the needle pulsing blood and ink into the air) and keeps himself honed to his physical peak with a grotesque exercise routine. His moments of fear and confusion, his haunting by the ambient growls and whispers of what sounds like an actual dragon(perhaps pursuing him from his last gig as Thorin Oakenshield in The Hobbit), and his bizarre and beautiful vision of being subsumed by a film projector impart a distinctly unsettling visual and emotional texture to the character.

&gt;Armitage is spellbinding in his enactment of Dolarhyde’s physical tics and tremors. Moved to kill in rough sync with the lunar cycle and fixated on murdering happy families in their homes, he wears a set of snaggletooth dentures to bite his dead victims. This, sometime before the episode’s time frame, earned him the unwanted sobriquet “the Tooth Fairy.” In the grip of his murderous seizure he is wholly the beast, stalking naked and bloody through the snow, mouth agape, body convulsing. Will’s journey through the blood-spattered scene of his crime reveals a man living in a world literally fractured, positioning broken shards of mirror over the mouths and genitals of the dead so that his silence, his physical dominion, extends even to the sensations of others.


**5)** Flickering Myth: [""Hannibal Season 3 – Episode 8 Review""](http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2015/07/hannibal-season-3-episode-8-review.html)

&gt;Richard Armitage made a memorable introduction in the opening as he prepared for his first set of kills. While he did not have any lines, much of his performance was given through body language and facial expressions, painting a picture of a very disturbed and emotionally unstable man. Armitage is sure to be a standout of the series once all is said and done.


**6)** The Geeks of Doom: [""TV Review: Hannibal 3.8 “The Great Red Dragon”""](http://www.geeksofdoom.com/2015/07/28/tv-review-hannibal-3-8-the-great-red-dragon)

&gt;Brought to life through an already mesmerizing performance by Richard Armitage, Francis Dolarhyde makes his grand entrance into the stage created by Fuller and company. Armitage’s physicality is such that he can express volumes without having to say a single line and this week’s script gives him plenty of material for him to dig his teeth into, but already the former Hobbit actor has proved himself a worthy addition to the Hannibal universe and a threat that’s a worthy successor to Hannibal’s abdicated throne.


**7)** Starpulse: [""'Hannibal' Recap: Say Hello To The Red Dragon""](http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2015/07/26/hannibal-recap-say-hello-to-the-red-dr)

&gt;Already, he's a force for creepy villainy. Richard Armitage is an astounding actor- I don't think Dolarhyde had a single line of dialogue in the entire episode, but already we know so much through Armitage's physical performance. That opening scene was especially strong- Dolarhyde doing some kind of psycho yoga/stretching, his muscles popping and bulging off his frame. Totally beautiful, totally unreal.


**8)** Frame Rated: [""HANNIBAL, 3.8 – ‘The Great Red Dragon’""](http://www.framerated.co.uk/hannibal-3-8-great-red-dragon/)

&gt;Armitage is immediately compelling in what is, in this sequence and most of the episode, a nearly dialogue-free performance, and Marshall does a great job, within the show’s unique aesthetic, of establishing a tighter pace that signals that the show has shifted gears. Few shows share Hannibal’s boldness in periodically shaking up its storytelling formula, even within a season, and this may have been its boldest move yet.

&gt;INCREDIBLE MOMENT = as Dolarhyde squirms and groans in his becoming there slithers a dragon’s tail back beyond the projector – amazing little shot thrown in there.

...

&gt;I cannot get enough of Richard Armitage as Dolarhyde. I mean, it’s incredible. His physicality, the way he embodies the character and truly becomes him; it’s the essence of the character. Plus, he has several episodes to flesh out that performance. Perfect actor to have chosen for this role. Armitage rules – I am now a believer!


**2)** Slant Magazine: [""Hannibal Recap: Season 3, Episode 9, ""And the Woman Clothed with the Sun""""](http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/article/hannibal-recap-season-3-episode-9-and-the-woman-clothed-with-the-sun)

&gt;As rich as these scenes are, the duets between Francis and Reba take Hannibal to a level of intensity that honors the best, most surprising portions of Red Dragon. We've seen the carnage that Francis has wrought, especially this week in those unmooring close-ups of Mrs. Jacobi in bed, spread out in a quasi-crucifixion pose, engulfed in geysers of blood stains, and now we're to somehow find a way to understand him as the most pitiful, tormented human being this series has offered. Francis speaks for the first time this week, after only uttering guttural moans previously, and we can hear the profound speech impediment caused by his cleft palate. The way Francis utters ""Mrs. McClane"" from his van, garbling it yet determined to verbally push it out so as to reach out, when he offers her a ride home, is the most moving gesture in the entire series. Considering the context of who Francis actually is, the scene is flabbergasting for its empathy and awareness of vulnerability, bringing to mind some of the vocal effects that Charles Laughton landed in The Hunchback of Notre Dame.

&gt;Armitage plays this role in the tradition of some of the 1930s-era Universal Studios movie monsters: with an acknowledgement of the grace that arrives almost inadvertently from the purity of the effort to overcome physical damage—a grace that Francis hates himself too much to recognize. When Francis eats a piece of pie that Reba offers him as they sit in her home, quickly, like a hungry dog, we share his relief in being able to eat with someone while remaining alone and unwatched in equal measure. It's training-wheels companionship for a man who's long been lost in the figurative cold.

&gt;It helps that Richard Armitage is playing Dolarhyde like a scarred youth searching for a parent. He’s childlike in the sense that his emotional development is incomplete, and there’s a strange mix of innocence and menace in his interactions with Reba McClane (Rutina Wesley). She can hear his pain, and her kindness offers a healthier road to evolution.

&gt;Obviously we loved Ralph Fiennes' take, but, in our humble opinion, @RCArmitage takes it to a whole new level.

&gt;We've now seen 3 of Richard's episodes and there really are not enough superlatives to describe his performance.

* Excerpt from Buzzfeed's [""Everything You Need To Know About The Next — And Possibly Last — Chapter Of Hannibal""](http://www.buzzfeed.com/jarettwieselman/the-next-and-last-chapter-of-hannibal):

&gt;**Bryan Fuller:** Now we have Richard Armitage, who is closer to Ralph Fiennes’ interpretation but with a steelier character as indicated in the book where he wouldn’t fall for pop psychology. He is actually as smart as anybody in the piece, is military trained, and has a precision and meticulousness with his attacks that slowly begins to wobble under the duress of a human connection — not only with Reba McClaine, played beautifully by Rutina Wesley, but also Hannibal Lecter himself. There’s aspects that we’ve seen a couple of times before in previous adaptations that you will see again in this adaptation of the Red Dragon story, but informed with character dynamics that are completely unique to our series.

&gt;**Buzzfeed:** The episode opens with a really unsettling sequence where Richard twists and contorts his body — was that CGI?

&gt;**Bryan Fuller:** That is all Richard’s body. We talked at length about that because we wanted it to feel like An American Werewolf in London, that it was a transformation taking place and things were popping and locking and moving as he is becoming the Great Red Dragon. Richard did a lot of research into body movements and this wonderful dance style that he found and really explored and made his own. Richard was just a gem, such a fantastic addition to the series because he, like Mads and Hugh, is such a consummate professional and so well prepared for his role and collaborative. Richard would send me his journals for the character and then we would discuss what was going on between them — the them being Francis and the Great Red Dragon — and maybe he’s not as insane as you would assume!

* Excerpt from Business Insider's [""Despite cancellation, 'Hannibal' just pulled another 180 to become an even better, scarier show""](http://www.businessinsider.com.au/hannibal-red-dragon-2015-7):

&gt;We’ve seen the first terrifying episode of this new arc (episode eight of the third season as a whole), and without spoiling anything, it holds true to everything that makes “Hannibal” great: Gorgeous, unsettling visuals, psychological horror, and riveting performances from the entire cast.

&gt;And while you don’t need to see the previous episodes to enjoy it, what sets this adaptation of “Red Dragon” apart from the novel and two prior film versions (1986’s “Manhunter” directed by Michael Mann, and 2002’s “Red Dragon“, directed by Brett Ratner) is the slow-burning history between all the characters that the show has spent two-and-a-half seasons setting up. 
	
&gt;Of course, a big part of what makes this new arc so immediately compelling is the addition of actor Richard Armitage as Francis Dolarhyde. Armitage is a force of nature, terribly frightening in the role without ever saying a word (and completely unrecognizable from his most famous role, Thorin Oakenshield from “The Hobbit” films). “Hannibal” has shown us a lot of depraved killers in its first two seasons, so setting up one in a way that justifies a six-episode hunt for him is a huge feat.

* Excerpt from [6 Things We Need to See Before 'Hannibal' Ends for Good](https://www.yahoo.com/tv/hannibal-nbc-canceled-122971237015.html):

&gt;1. The Red Dragon

&gt; Luckily, we already know this wish is coming true: The Hobbit’s Richard Armitage will play tattoo-covered killer Francis Dolarhyde, aka the Red Dragon, starting with the July 23 episode. And since Dolarhyde is such a key figure in the Thomas Harris books and the Lecter films, it’s great that we’ll get to see him come to life on Hannibal by season’s end.

&gt;Dolarhyde’s gory rampage will likely bring Will Graham back into the FBI fold — and he may even enlist the help of Dr. Lecter to bring this demented murderer to justice. Hannibal and Will working together to capture a common foe… how delicious would that be?

**RA-related Excerpts (Hannibal spoilers in this section)**

* [Excerpt from ""On Hannibal Season 3 Endings and What Season 4 Could Be"" from Assignmentx.com:](http://www.assignmentx.com/2015/hannibal-bryan-fuller-on-hannibal-season-3-endings-and-what-season-4-could-be-exclusive-interview/)

&gt;**AX:** How did you decide on Richard Armitage to play serial killer/Hannibal acolyte Francis Dolarhyde in the RED DRAGON section?

&gt;**FULLER:** I had been a fan of his for awhile, and we have several friends in common, and so I’ve always wanted to work with him, because I’d heard such great things about him as a human being and had seen his performances and so he was always in my mind as somebody that we needed to have on HANNIBAL.

&gt;Also, in my mind, I had many conversations with Lee Pace [who starred in Fuller’s PUSHING DAISIES] about playing Francis Dolarhyde. And so until the moment that Lee was definitely not available, I was like, “Okay …” HALT AND CATCH FIRE [which stars Pace], when it was picked up, I was secretly, not so secretly disappointed, because then I knew that Lee wouldn’t be available. Then it was like, “Who would be great is Richard,” and I reached out to his reps, who are also my reps, and we got on the phone, and he was just lovely and fascinated and was really up for the challenge of the role and stepped in with such ownership and a collaborative spirit in shaping this new adaptation, and there were many conversations that we had where he was like, “You know, this moment has a particular sweetness to it, and can we weave that into the story?” and “Were you planning on doing this?” He had a lot of really great, interesting ideas about the character and let me read his journals that he was composing [about] his approach and they were meticulously written and well-referenced and demonstrated such a sophisticated understanding of the role. And in the novel, he’s a tragic figure.

&gt;For me, I really wanted to challenge the audience into trying to forget that this is a horrible killer of families and a man who is insane that is looking [for] and perhaps has found some rope that he can pull himself out of his insanity and root for him in overcoming his madness. And I think you need an actor like Richard, who brings an innate likability and vulnerability, as well as a ferocity, to the character. And I’m excited for people to see what he does, because it’s both heartbreaking and terrifying.

&gt;**AX:** He was surprisingly Shakespearean in his approach to the dwarf leader in the HOBBIT trilogy …

&gt;**FULLER:** He was great in those movies. And buried under a lot of makeup. So it’s interesting to see his face exposed. [As Dolarhyde] he has the cleft palate. It’s odd to see how much one thing can change the structure of a person’s face.

&gt;**AX:** Are we going to see Dolarhyde’s flashbacks?

&gt;**FULLER:** We see a couple. We see some very limited things that give you an indication of his trauma, but so much of the real estate dedicated to the Francis Dolarhyde story is about his relationship with Reba McClane, who’s this beacon of humanity that might be able to save him from himself, and so I was excited about adapting that, because in reading the book, it was one of the most romantic stories, obviously, in very corrupt circumstances, that the idea of a man bringing a blind woman to the zoo and wanting her to experience it by facilitating her touching the tiger is one of the most beautiful, romantic things I’ve ever seen in any story, and its simplicity and yet in its eloquence, so I wanted to make sure when we told that aspect of their relationship that we were rooting for these two as a couple to overcome.

* I've caught a few sheep in my farmhouse, but sometimes, they seem to stay fixed in one place. Is there a way to select a sheep that hasn't been cut from behind the sheep that's been sheared already? Or at least a way to get the sheep in front to move?

* What's the recommended gear to defeat those underground Guardians? First time I tried attacking them, I had iron/steel gear and now I'm scared to try again.

* Any advice on how to effectively keep my tesla towers out of harm's way while they attacks invaders? Any way to repair them? I've tried placing them an empty square above  the enemy's path (path &gt; space&gt; stone &gt; tower), but I end up using fireballs cause the enemies start stacking to reach them. They don't seem to be repairing themselves either.

* Seeing as how rare mithril is, what should I prioritize with it? I just spent most of it crafting armor and weapons, not sure if I should have focused on making more tesla towers instead (I only built two rank 3 ones and 2 rank 2). Don't think I have enough mithril to gear everyone either.

I bought this game on a whim, little did I know I'd be consumed day and night with making sure my Dwarves are safe from the undead. Having a great deal of fun! Hoping some sort of online co-op/multiplayer component can be added in the future.",CraftTheWorld,a few newbie questions,http://www.reddit.com/r/CraftTheWorld/comments/3adzgi/a_few_newbie_questions/
