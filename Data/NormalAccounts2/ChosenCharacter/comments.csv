47,"I think it takes a lot more than just a few projects. It takes dedication to see it through. It takes patience to build up your skills. It takes the desire to make something better than the last. A lot of indie devs settle for mobile puzzle games or endless runners, they saturate the market with their lack of effort. Same for students that think that making a bunch of artistic cubes with floating text and basic unity effects is enough to be ""daring.""

You gotta not be that. You gotta want something better for yourself. Always.

I went from clicker game to RPG with a (very small) fan base who made a wiki to getting a game through greenlight. It took a stupid amount of time and hell no am I not satisfied since I know I can do better. I'm zooming with big ideas but I know at my current financial level those big ideas are not possible. So I'm trying to make things I can make that are unique enough to be recognizable. I've headed to conventions, sat around booths by myself, demo'd the game a gajillion times, lost my voice a few times, but I'm still kinda lazy lol since in the end this game's taken too long but what can ya do. You just gotta do it anyways.

Honestly, the reason why Shine was run so well is because it was well thought out from the get go. Shi, Collin, and co waited a long time to get the experience, money, and infrastructure needed to do this event, and it was incredible. They rented out the perfect venue, gave everything the time and detail it needed (2 hours per pool, best of 5 top 32, and 3 hours per top 8, VIP room) and treated everything and everyone with the respect and dignity it deserves.

228,"Just some notes about the now:

Balance

- Season 1 of competitive was a mess and pretty much universally disliked for ridiculous punishments for losing and no gain for wins, as well as odd things like coin flips instead of draws.

- ""protect the Genji"" meta right now basically

- Lucio/Zenyetta are your support characters if you want to win

- Mercy is shit tier now, Symmetra CONTINUES to be shit tier, Ana is ""what are we supposed to do with her"" tier though she's rather nice in QP

- Mei is broken, in a bad way, because of the hitbox nerfs and RNG ice wall glitch (please let me be laughing about this in a good way in a year.)

Speculation

- Everyone is overlaying the sky code with everything.

- We're prettttty sure Sombra is a stealth hero and will be invisible, considering the whole lucio ball thing and leaked voice clips.

- Also halloween, oktoberfest, christmas events will probably be happening.

- Current ""heroes we think will happen"" are Liao, Soundquake, Sombra (obvs, who we're expecting on August 23rd) and Doomfist (who we recently speculated is the black visor guy)

$$$ 

- Currently everyone has at least 4 legendary skins, only 'impossible to get regularly' skins are Olympics and Origins

- A lot of people are very upset about the Olympic Loot Boxes and we're hoping Jeff Kaplan fixes it (another thing I hope I won't cringe reading a year in the future)

- Currently the only ways to progress in OW is either your Season ranking, your level, or your progress in collecting hero stuff.

- Current Overwatch monetization level, with 0 being pre-TF2 hats valve and 10 being Candy Crush, is about 5 (cosmetics only, but it's clear the cosmetics system is kinda rigged.)",2016-08-07 20:09:42+00:00,d685gaj,1.0,t3_4wlbm6,15899.0,Overwatch

301,"Mei could easily be buffed by losing her 1 second startup on right click. I don't know why it's there, as the projectile is slow and deals little damage in the first place. Mei is a defense hero that gets stomped by offense heroes like Reaper (can just wraith out of it,) Pharah (can just jump out of it and moves too fast for right click,) and Tracer (yea right.) So her only purpose is to maybe kill Genji theoretically if the Genji is genuinely awful at his job or ice S76 if he misses his missiles.

Like, come on, who thought that was a good dynamic? Mei STRUGGLES AGAINST OFFENSE CHARACTERS. Like, come on.

That being said she's a tank eater, but that's only if she's, you know, got room to fight the tank. I can imagine in competitive there'll never be a situation where the tank isn't matched up with an offense hero who'll destroy her.

And it's like, what can you do other than buff right click? If you make her left click better, she'll be freezing people left and right. If you buff her ice wall, well, you know.

I personally really liked arcade mode, it's how I learned how to initially play new characters. Yea that sounds stupid but consider that not everyone who plays SF only plays it for the MLG gitgud or g3t r3kt bullshit that Capcom seems to assume people do with SF5.

The modes for SF4 simply have more in them. That's just a fact. The arcade mode is significantly better than a few stills and a three fights with a dumb as nails AI.

The hidden bosses I mean as in, if you do incredibly well you can fight Akuma or Gouken. I don't care if you unlock them or not, that added bonus was just a very nice throwback that showed an extra layer of polish that SFV didn't have - the fact that SF4 even had secrets while SFV doesn't have anything. 

When you buy SF4, there's no doubt in your mind that the game is worth $60. It has everything, a single player, a multiplayer, several characters, and it doesn't feel like anything was held off for DLC. With SF5 I feel like I bought an incomplete game and had to shell out more to finish it.

427,"&gt; git gud

I'm in Bronze hell because matchmaking is taking forever. I'm winning almost every match I have that isn't a glitchy nightmare. When I pick 4-5 it takes forever, worth it I guess?

I mean, this game is generally easier to play than 4 was. Easier to pull off combos/execute moves by far.

&gt; diversity

As for opponent diversity, I dunno, I really literally don't see anything but Shotos. SFIV was a LOT more diverse than this.

&gt; wait times

The wait time is pretty awful, it takes a very long time to start a match, and it's just all around ""why is this a thing."" SF4 just got you right into it, this is a mess.

&gt; if you don't like the game, stop playing it

708,"I think Lucas is a great character that is marred by a high skill ceiling. Initially it would seem like Lucas is the Dr. Mario to Ness's Mario - while Ness hits 10 times, Lucas hits once and hits hard. But people don't realize that a LOT of Lucas's attacks link, those hard hitting moves that do a good amount of percent chain right into eachother.

I also think Lucas is by far the one of the single most variable characters in the game. I know a lot of other Lucas players, they don't play Lucas the same as me or eachother. Lucas has tools for every situation, and some moves, like fair, have considerably more range than you'd think (for everything else, there's a well spaced PK Fire that usually pushes you out of punish range.)

Also, despite being light asf (one of two major downsides imo) he can also recover from pretty much any distance and can use that to go deep offstage for early kills.

His other major downside is that other than fsmash, his smashes have extremely high commitment. usmash is deadly and is not as hard to hit as you'd think, but if you miss you're screwed. dsmash is a very good edgeguard but the same deal - he just keeps attacking, Bowser Jr. style, and you can get on a safe distance on the other side and charge something up.

But with so many offstage kill options and mix ups, as well as fsmash and fair which are really good kill moves (offstage PK fire as well for the skilled too,) there's more to Lucas than just the numbers. ",2016-02-25 02:38:07+00:00,d0cso1d,2.0,t1_d0cnhqf,8104.0,smashbros

777,"- Air Mobility isn't just air speed. PK Magnet let's you maneuver really well.

- Off stage PK Fire is not that hard to do when you've figured out how to do it.

- Here you go saying ""most"" again. ZAir isn't that high commitment, Nair is as high commitment as most nair's and has an active hitbox up until the last few frames, Dair has a huge disjoint, etc.

- Never said it was good. It's about as good as Toon Link's and that's the best you'll get out of a range grab. Not everybody can be ZSS.

Lucas is my dual main. I have Yoshi for all the things Lucas can't do and Yoshi for all the things Lucas can't do. I use them about equally.

I mean, honestly, you're a Bowser Jr. main. I honestly think you're confusing Lucas's drawbacks for Jr. The problem with Jr is that his everything just isn't worth it and his giant ass hitbox makes him easy to punish. Lucas is tiny, slippery, and has a mix of super fast and slow attacks. It's not the same character and tbh I don't know why you even think you're entitled to comment on his weaknesses when you've clearly not played him.",2015-11-22 23:44:32+00:00,cx9jedh,5.0,t1_cx9cilc,10712.0,smashbros
778,"- Lucas can land whenever he wants to. I'd like you to find me 13 characters that can slow their down descent to a crawl and basically wait for you to come down just to hurt.

- Yes, actually, having a PK Fire that doubles as a finisher and can push people so far off stage that they get out of recovery zone is very nice to have. The point of Lucas is to push you so far out there that it's not gonna happen.

- Sheik is universally agreed to be broken. Pikachu is universally agreed to be top 5. You keep comparing Lucas with the top. Lucas isn't the top.

- ""Most of his moves require commitment"": usmash, dsmash, fsmash. Gee, smashes that are high commitment? PK Thunder is high commitment because it's a RECOVERY and shouldn't be used when they're right next to you. Meanwhile he's tied for the fastest jabs and tilts in the game, and they end fast as well.

- You need to learn how to grab. Seriously. Don't throw it around randomly. Ranged grabs are only a problem for people who don't spam the grab button and hope it works. Again, this isn't Ness.

- It's not hard for Lucas to create distance. Seriously. He can keep you as far away as he wants if you know how to play the game.

You honestly seem like you played Lucas for about 5 minutes and said ""aww geeze I can't throw moves around randomly, this guy must suck."" I know this is crazy talk that a character who doesn't have 0 endlag like Shiek or 1 move repeated 'combo's' like Mario/ZSS and has to switch it up is not garbage, but seriously, either invest time, learn the character, and learn that he's bottom high tier/top mid or don't talk like you know him.

Lucas is hard. Lucas is good. You can learn Lucas if you want, but don't expect an easy ride. It's worth it, though.",2015-11-22 20:36:02+00:00,cx9c4p2,3.0,t1_cx95dxp,10531.0,smashbros
779,"I honestly think that the only reason people rate Lucas so low is because of Ness.

Here's the thing about Lucas:
1. He's extremely hard to use (one of the hardest in the game)
2. He's combo based
3. He's absolutely nothing like Ness.

Ness is broken. Ness is braindead. Everything comes easy to Ness. Ness has the best throw in the game (by a long shot) and has those aerial 'combo's' as well as a PK Rocket that kills at 50%.

So if you try Ness and then try Lucas, I get why you think Lucas is trash, because you're comparing one of the easiest, most linear, characters in the game to one of the hardest, most mix-up based. IMO I think they are on the same power level, but it's an entirely different ball game.

BUT HERE'S WHY HE DOESN'T SUCK

1. He has possibly the best aerial mobility in the game, due to his PK Magnet making you get to what ever level you want at your own pace. He can recover from anywhere, so he can chase really, really, deep. His fair outranges almost all non-sword attacks (it's also very fast) and hits hard. This, coupled with the other points I'm about to make, make him one of the most dangerous characters to face off stage.

2. His PK fire is one of the best projectiles out there. It hits hard and can kill offstage if you hit it with a good read at around 120% (depends on lightness/rage). IT ALSO PUSHES YOU OUT OF THE WAY. Especially if reversed. Reverse PK Fire is a satisfying way to get those pesky Roys away from you midair as well as getting you out of the way of them if you whiff.

3. He has the best recovery in the game. Seriously. He has so many options to recover it's not even funny. He can reverse PK fire. He can tether. He can PK magnet. And then, of course, he can do his ridiculously long range PK thunder/rocket. If somebody is expecting one recovery, give him the other one. Either way, Mr. Floats and his PK Magnet descent will avoid any off stage chase and make sure he gets back on stage.

4. Zoning. Lucas can outrange you pretty much all the time. Whether it's the fair, the pk fire, the rope, and yes a CAREFUL PK Thunder chase. One of these days somebody will master the PK Magnet which ALSO can kill off stage.

5. Lucas's bat is one of the best smashes in the game. It comes out quickly (significantly faster than bat,) has a very good long range disjointed hitbox, and usually kills at 100%-ish or puts someone offstage.

6. Yes he has a ranged grab. Yes this can be a bad thing. It also can be a really good thing - it can prevent people dashing in, it's a defensive player's worst enemy, it's just a bundle of issues. I DO think it needs to either come out/retreat quicker or have more range, though, but as is it outranges most disjointed hitboxes.

7. His jabs are great. Really. Try them. Down tilt is also stupid fast and links into his grab for his famous downthrow combos.

8. Usmash is extremely slow but has intangibility on a few frames, it also has a tricky looking animation which is pretty much ""by the time you noticed it's happening, it's already too late."" It also has Palutena-level vertical range AND it also has horizontal range. Did I mention it's also hands down the strongest usmash in the game?

9. Dsmash has stupidly high knockback and a bigger hitbox than you think. It only shoots in one direction, though, but it will shoot HARD. It's also a very high commitment move, like usmash, though a little less so.

10. The love-it-or-hate-it PK Thunder is amazing for racking up damage. That being said it requires a predict to be able to avoid hitting. One tip? If you're getting close to them and you know they'll air dodge (they will) IMMEDIATELY begin a loop BEFORE you hit them. This pretty much guarantees they'll hit it as most characters will be trying to recover first by moving towards the stage (obviously) and will try to airdodge forward.

WHAT TO DO WITH LUCAS?

1. Get off the damn ground.

2. Don't keep going for the grabs.

3. Don't rush in.

4. DO NOT SPAM PK FIRE. It is a very useful tool, but it can get predictable and is best used as a surprise attack.

5. DO NOT SPAM PK THUNDER. It is literally only used for off stage chasing. This isn't Ness, PK rocket will not kill until like 150% or so (variable.)

6. PK Freeze can be a safer but significantly harder to use chase option off stage.

7. Don't be afraid to bait and switch. The entire point of Lucas is to get them where you want them, especially when it's off stage.

8. CHASE THEM OFF STAGE. Lucas can recover. Most of the cast can recover, but god help them if they try to recover from the bottom of battlefield (which Lucas can do.)

9. Learn the short reverse jump PK Fire and be able to do it immediately. That is, short jump facing away from your opponent, then shoot backwards (where your opponent is.) This is especially useful when they're getting close as it pushes you straight out of the way.
