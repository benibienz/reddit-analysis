This DOESN'T mean you instalock a sniper on offense.

This DOESN'T mean you don't switch off chars that aren't working (no this doesn't mean you can't ever play Bastion, but if you're running in to gunfire constantly because we don't have the tanks to get you there safely and die before you can turret *every time* it's time to switch.)

This DOESN'T mean you don't work with your team and completely ignore objectives.

It's OK to try X as long as you're actually trying. But if you're getting annihilated because you're doing things that cannot and never will work, you're not trying. If you're walking into a storm of bullets as Bastion, you're not getting Bastion practice, and you WON'T get Bastion practice, so try playing something else until we can secure the point. Same with Hanzo, Widow, Torb, whatever it is that you're trying (and failing) to do. If you want target practice, you won't get it, because they'll either kill you, your turret (then you,) or won't be in your LOS. You're not getting practice. Stop.

OW is fun when you are actually trying to win the game, it's fun when you get that adrenaline rush after a match well fought, it's not fun when you run in and get shot up in 5 seconds because you INSIST on 1v6'ing the team or INSIST on making this a 5v6 (hell I've had 4v6) because you refuse to be an active player.

I'm playing Bronze one star, if you're at that level this means that you've at least put 60 hours into this game.

It's pretty sad, but for some reason I find myself able to relate. Every feel like you're not getting that specific skin you want? Ever feel like the game's trying its hardest to prevent you from getting even the basic recolors?

Well, based on the practices of other game companies, I'm almost certain that Blizzard is specifically trying to deny you skins for characters you want. For example, I main Mei, and literally never get Mei drops (had to buy them.) While I played Hanzo I never got Hanzo drops either. It seems whatever my top character was at the time, I literally didn't get a single thing for them.

It's not beyond a company that's half Activision to be tracking down what you're looking for, what you're in the Hero Gallery looking at. It may even be that once you become a ""whale"" and start spending money the RNG gets even worse.

I mean, this is Blizzard, you don't get 10m players on WoW without learning a few things about how to keep people playing up to and including targeted denial.

I don't know, maybe I'm just distrusting, but it just seems too common to be a case of bad RNG.

But it seems Blizzard really DOES care.

Because imagine my surprise that, while messing around in the practice range, I finished off a bot just for her to say ""Etalim min al Elam"" (learn from the pen, but more usually another way of saying ""smack/slap,"" so literally ""learn from the punishment"") I then used her Ult and she yelled to her teammate ""Wareehom quwitak"" (literally 'show them your power,') then I tried just saying Hi and she they didn't just have one but THREE ways to say Hi in Arabic!

When SF5 came out I was like, okay, this game doesn't seem complete so lets wait for the sale. Well, I waited for the sale, and the game... still doesn't feel worth it.

Let's just talk about online - first off, I'm currently stuck in Bronze hell apparently. I win my matches when I get them, but it takes SO long to get them. When I DO get them, I have to wait 10 seconds as ""A New Challenger is Approaching"" is flashed on my screen for the nth time. Then we're shown what our opponent picked. Then we're taken to the game.

When the game starts, Capcom shows you how much they failed to gauge what a ""3/5"" connection means. In SF4 if it's yellow, it means you'll have SOME lag. In SF5 the game is literally unplayable. It looks like a high ping connection on GGPO, where people are teleporting all over the place and the game is trying to decide which alternate reality of inputs its going to make canon. It's a disaster.

All the while you're listening to the Ryu theme which you CAN'T change. Unlike SF4, you can't decide whether you listen to stage or rival music. In SF4, if you played arcade mode you at least got to listen to the stage music. In this game, because they forgot to put Arcade mode (hell they forgot to put versus AI despite it clearly being there in training mode, not tough to code and completely inexcusable,) it means that Kanzuki Beach which I bought specifically because I loved the music is practically worthless since I NEVER hear the music. Just the Ryu theme, all the time, because player skill has apparently degraded since Super Slow Fighter 4 and people refuse to play literally anything but play Ryu, Chun, sometimes Ken if you're lucky. All the other chars are icky because they can't shoot fireballs.

Then you win/lose, if you lose you get another match, if you win your opponent is so damn salty that they leave. I don't know if this is an attitude problem, but in SF4 you could EASILY get a rematch since players would be right there in the lobby, and all of them were willing to give it another shot. In SF5 it's just an endless saltfest. That one's not on Capcom, but it's just an attitude problem.

So yea, I'm done with online, mostly done with this game. I'm sick of listening to the Ryu theme - it's never been good in any iteration of the game - and I'm sick of long queue times to get SOME value out of this game since I'm not allowed to have fun offline apparently.

Quick play is still Overwatch. It didn't get a new meaning because of competitive. You STILL use strategy in Quick Play. Sure you can mess around and have 6 torbs, that's legit, but we STILL need to work together and agree on a general *something* we're going to do together.

There seems to be a general aggressiveness in QP towards people who are still actually playing to win, still trying to make this game happen.

Yes. It IS just a game. Yes. It IS casual. But still, we need to actually try to win the game. You don't have to take the game super seriously either, you just have to actually make that motion forwards.

Let's be clear: OW is fun when the team is well put together and doing their best, OW is fun when you're cooperating, OW is fun when you have that nail biting close match, win or lose it's fun when you feel like you're getting better and moving forward. It's not fun when you have to switch to second healer because people stubbornly refuse to switch off that third genji and we're simply not getting the kills and not being effective. It's not fun when we're failing to get through the most basic of defenses because nobody wants to group up and work together. It's not fun when it's effectively a team of six lone wolves.

For Mei more than anyone, you need to master that 3 star difficulty - being a bad/clueless Mei can actually sabotage your teams efforts by getting in the way - a really bad and almost deadly thing.

On offense, Mei's key job can be summed in 3 words, one for each star - her role is to ISOLATE, APPROACH, and DISTRACT. Her role can easily be summed up as ANTI-DEFENSE (as in, those characters that are defense class.)

Let's talk about APPROACH: Mei is very, very, good at making a path for her teammates and opening up for a flank. Be aware that half the time when an Ice Wall comes up, your opponent team will be both confused and will take a moment to navigate around it. Use this to your advantage.

Mei excels when there are lots of turrets/snipers, especially if they are in a confined area. For example, let's consider Temple of Anubis, which imo is Mei's best offense map. On Anubis, there is what I lovingly call the ""entrance way turret clusterfuck"" that almost always assembles every single match. Expect torb, expect Bastion, maybe expect Symmetra turrets behind the doorway. Now in this situation, what you really want to do is just plop an ice wall right in front of the biggest threat (bastion &gt; torb turret, ideally you get both.) THEN, assuming at least one other person is through the doorway, you can easily go in from the left, through the door, up the stairs, and single handidly flank that entire setup. If you have blizzard, use it. If you don't, we move on to the next role.

Mei's extreme survivability makes her an excellent DISTRACTION. When you're flanking, you can kind of go in there knowing you probably won't destroy the temple clusterfuck by yourself. What you CAN do, however, is make the biggest distraction you possibly can. Jump around. Ice wall them again. Hit shift and freeze yourself (stay inside the building for the most part,) then ice wall the door when you're out, retreat, heal, etc. If done right, the opponent team will focus on you, giving the rest of your team enough time to go through the main doorway. If you're good, you can clear that platform yourself. Blizzard almost always does it (rack up damage with icepick on the turrets, don't get too cocky though,) but otherwise you can just wait for backup and keep blocking those turrets and causing issues.

Now that you've cleared that defense, you can focus on Mei's third purpose - getting on that damn point, which Mei does incredibly well. Don't worry if you're the first person there, because as soon as the enemy team knows you're on that point they're going to turn around and start sending people. This is when you learn to ISOLATE. Mei is great 1v1 vs right about anyone that isn't Genji, Reaper, or Pharah. Often, however, you're not going to be in that 1v1 situation. You need to use Ice Wall NOT to block the entire team or the doorway or whatever, but to *cut people off* their teammates. For example, if you see a mercy healing from the side, switch the direction of ice wall and plop it right in front of her. If you see Reaper and a Lucio coming for you, BLOCK the reaper and get that Lucio. If all else fails, isolate yourself and try to survive until backup arrives, contesting that point so the enemy team focuses on you while your team flanks from behind. Remember - if they're retreating and are at low hp, block the doorway where they're retreating from. I've taken out many a Hanzo or Soldier 76 who thought just pressing D would get them out of range, then panic when they realize they've hit a wall that wasn't there before (remember, they don't know the ice wall's behind them until they hit it.)

Mei is very underrated. Played well she can be a nightmare, but played badly she's a hindrance to the team - that's why she's 3 star difficulty. I've taken Temple of Anubis, Hanamura, and other CP's in less than a minute because she's one of the best anti-defense you can ask for. She can counter snipe (block and flank them, use that ice wall to get through their line of sight and then climb to where they are, and if the sniper doesn't see you - remember, ice pick has a LOT of range,) she can cockblock turrets leaving a lot of time for your team to move forward, she can do a whole lot but she needs communication with the team (tell them what you're gonna do, otherwise you risk getting in the way.) I see too many Mei's trying to be a lone wolf and be a one Mei army and it ends terribly every time.

Was kinda hoping they'd change the meter mechanics on KillCam. Right now it shows you what the meter looked like at the time of the kill, but it's kind of annoying as it makes you blind to how your team is doing in real time.

I know it sounds strange, but I've made on the spot hero choices based on ""did we manage to get those attackers off our point yet"" or not. It's also just kind of frustrating to be thrown out of the loop for 7 seconds to just be shown quite frankly useless info.

Showing the other team's ult charge is alright, though, useful to know how far along they are.

So a little BG about myself: I'm Egyptian born, 4/5 American raised, so I'm always excited when I see ANY Egyptian representation in any game (it is incredibly rare for the 15th most populated country in the world, with 8m more than Germany and 28m more than France,) so I'm actually very thankful for Blizzard giving a slot in their initial roster for Egypt.

That being said, Pharah really strikes me as only Egyptian in name.

The problem is that Pharah, unlike any of the other characters in the game, doesn't actually sound anything like what she's supposed to be.

For one thing, her accent... isn't Egyptian. I don't know what it is exactly, but I've never heard anyone in Egypt speak with her accent, and yes this includes people with ""light"" Egyptian accents.

For another thing, she's one of the only characters that never says anything in her native language. Mercy speaks German, Widowmaker speaks French, Hanzo speaks Japanese, but Pharah doesn't speak a single line of Egyptian Arabic. It'd be amazing to finally hear a character in a video game (that's not a villain) say something inspirational or intense in Arabic - it's not that scary of a language and I'd imagine a soldier (which, as of 2016 is impossible, as A. you can't enlist in the Egyptian Army and B. not as a women in the infantry, but in 20XX I'm sure those will be resolved) would say something in her language when the situation gets intense (also, Arabic rallying cries are always a good time - play AOE if you want a taste of that ;))

I'd really like to see Pharah be given the same kind of treatment as other characters. For such a patriot, she just doesn't strike me as from the country she's supposed to be from.

EDIT: Just a clarifying note, the current VA doesn't have to go. Just some additional lines in Arabic would work.

Also, thanks for the Reddit Gold from whoever you are. I really appreciate it :)

It is very similar to how Americans, after achieving independence, celebrate Christopher Columbus as a hero even though he is considered a despicable human being to many today. Undertale has no real history since it is such a recent game and they need something to identify themselves with, similar to the Americans after breaking off from Great Britain. Melee has an enormous, long standing history filled with many colorful stories and characters much like Great Britain. If we lose or win the contest, it won't affect us too much as we have a lot to fall back on while Undertale has nothing besides a Game Awards nomination. And Gamefaqs is not known as the most respected of websites, much like how Columbus is not the most respectable figure in history. I think it's quite funny how well it all fits.

What will essentially happen is that I'm sort of half awake, half asleep, and I'll feel I have actually woken up and done things. For example, once I was waiting on a text and went to take a nap. Throughout the nap I kept waking up, 'getting the text,' RESPONDING to it, and going back to sleep. I'll wake up again with the feeling that it might not have happened, but still be unable to move. Throughout this I'll be checking the clock and be completely aware that time is passing and I'm going in/out of sleep, but completely unable to stop. When I wake up, I usually have an 'overslept' feeling.
