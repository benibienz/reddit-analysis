1,"Sometimes I wonder if the powers that be ""really"" want things to gert better. There are community colleges that are doing it right. Aspen awards some of them every year. Other colleges can examine what really works and adapt the best practices to the characteristics of their institutions and student body.",2016-08-28 20:48:57+00:00,d70dc1x,4,t1_d6z85gu,84485,highereducation
2,"You are right, college is not for everyone. Unfortunately, they don't know that until they get there. We, community colleges, get a bad rap sometimes because of our ""numbers.""  Like I said above, we are being measured by 4-year institution standards and we are much different. The AACC has created the Voluntary Framework of Accountability (VFA) (http://vfa.aacc.nche.edu/Pages/default.aspx) which is free for community colleges to use and is a better resource to check our effectiveness.  It was created for community colleges by community college experts. Most colleges haven't bought into it yet.",2016-08-27 17:39:14+00:00,d6yzyed,2,t1_d6yh1cq,47462,highereducation
3,"Wow, I can see where that could be frustrating. We haven't gone that far, yet. What could help is during their enrollment, the admissions counselor could ask if they intend to graduate from your school or take some classes to transfer. Then, put them in the appropriate program, transfer or degree. Just my thoughts.",2016-08-27 00:33:55+00:00,d6y98ty,4,t1_d6y8y75,490,highereducation
4,"Thank you for commenting. You are right many students that come to our community do not attend to graduate. Some just want to take some classes to transfer to a 4-year institution, some just want to take some classes to get a better position at the current place of employment. Others just come to college because mom and day said to do so.

To my point, community colleges are measured by the same standards as 4-year institutions though our missions are vastly different. One of those primary measures is the Graduation Rate. The Graduation Rate is calculated by the amount of first-time, full-time students who have never attended college anywhere that graduate within 150% of the time required to get a credential.  That's 3 years to complete an associate's degree.

As you correctly stated, the average age of the community college student is 28 and about 70% work at least part-time (http://www.aacc.nche.edu/AboutCC/Pages/fastfactsfactsheet.aspx). The funny thing is most of the time those students don't get counted in most of the reports that community colleges have to complete.
Frankly, I don't think that we should be measured by the 4-year college ""measuring stick,"" but that is where we are at. We are different and should have different measures as to our effectiveness. Like, how many students actually transferred, got a promotion, or a better job because of the one or two classes they took with us.
I appreciate the dialogue.",2016-08-27 00:06:13+00:00,d6y88lo,2,t1_d6y5fku,4475,highereducation
