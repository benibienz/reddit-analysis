Hope he can get a prescription.  

Lindsey and Gretch fighting was hilarious.... but interesting to see their friendship wither... Lindsey is the worst. She's fucking up her friendship with Gretchen and obviously is further fucking up hers with Paul. Thats gonna be awkward that she wants Paul to watch her fuck other dudes.

Jimmy and Gretchen were cute. Jimmy was cringy as fuck at the end but he did it for her..plus he overall enjoyed himself. I love the trope of ""Hates the activity but is amazing at it and secretly enjoys it"".

Fuck that was a roller coaster. Poor Edgar I just want to hug him. I loved the idea of showing the day from his point of view. The jokes that seemed fairly light hearted were now cruel and painful. Makes me really pissed at Jimmy, Gretch and Lindsey. Really makes them seem like heartless asssholes more than usual. 

The thing before he found the sailboat. Was he going to run into traffic? I feel the suicide question where he had a pause between it, was insinuating that. I'm glad he had that sailboat to save him. I don't have PTSD as bad as him but I do from a long term illness and major depression (such as Gretchen) and the littlest things can distract you and save your life. So if so I like that they did that.

Also that talk seemed to really pep up Edgar, I hope he can start to use what was said as a way to cope and move to progress. On a show called You're The Worst.. Edgar is actually a great person who just had shit hands dealt to him. Thats why its so painful to see him like this.

A lot of people say Elliot being in jail slowed things up....wellllllllll.. it sorta makes sense being he committed a crime. Would take some time to get out of jail...and they made it entertaining. 

Did Stage 2 complete? Nah. But is Stage 2 even supposed to complete? Thats what I think people are confusing. It may no be in Sam's plans to go further than Stage 2. Elliot might finally take control and stop it somehow and then it becomes him and whomever vs. Dark Army. Cause if you ask me, they have more control than Ecorp.

Good twist on what I expected. Glad Jimmy is fine. For now, if the ending was foreshadowing. If so I bet it will happen when. On the cruise 

Lindsey..good mom, horrible wife. Maybe she would work best as a single mom idk. But her cockaholism might be coming back. Plus I think know she is afraid of having a kid. So weird.

Edgar. Was he drunk/stoned at the end? He seemed happy but also under the influence. With the previews of next week I feel one of two things might happen. Either he is going to have a huge breakdown or he will try to help make a system to help suffering vets like him.

90,"Dana isn't the best in the ring no.. and using Bayley and Sasha as pawns is pretty shitty..but I like the Charlotte/Dana angle...in which it takes 2 good actors to pull off. People say why in Kayfabe would Dana be still helping Charlotte, defending her, crawling back, etc. This is the story of an abusive relationship. Charlotte threatens and sometimes hit Dana if she does or says something she doesn't like. Charlotte belittles her, reminds her anytime she can be dumped by her. When Dana stood up for herself Charlotte ditched her and Dana had to beg to be taken back..so Charlotte once again had the upper hand on the person she abuses. Dana, being belittled and told she's nothing so much, thinks she needs Charlotte.

This storyline seems to parallel with a lot of domestic abuse/abusive relationship stories. This is a big abusive friendship story. In my mind they are pulling it off well and I will pop for Dana when/if she gets the upperhand. ",2016-09-21 04:45:21+00:00,d7vn178,1.0,t3_53ppde,26733.0,SquaredCircle

Here's one of my EP's http://fryscreamforicecream.bandcamp.com/album/fsfic-ep ..it's a little rough since my technique is a bit dated (2 years ago yikes!) but I'm working on some new stuff with fuller production. But all and all a lot of others have said its not bad. But yeah this was all recorded in my small room. All DI and with an AT2020 condenser on a cheap mixer. Mixed on Headphones since the small, untreated room would be worthless for speakers. 

Feel free to PM or post a link down here, would love to hear anything you have! I dig Indie Rock (I dig all genres) so I'm down to hear some.  You have some pretty great gear! I have an SM58 myself that I used on my next EP mostly. With that I have a broken (gonna get it fixed soon) SM7b, AT2020, a harm mic and some cheap radioshack mic if I wanna go lo-fi. You have some crazy damn good gear man! I feel even in a small room that shit will sound amazing. I'm quite jealous haha. I feel Guitar, Acoustic, Vocals will sound great in that small room. I feel though Piano and Drums may be a bit of an issue in a small, untreated room. Unless you don't like a lot of room sound on Piano or Drums and just digital room it. Thats what I do haha. 

But it's good you have some Dynamic mics. I've learned those things will sound great in any room. Just close mic and you are good. In my experience at least. I've recorded vocals with someone next to me talking on Xbox Live..with the Xbox on making noise..and it didn't show up on my mic. So I doubt any untreated, small room, will be noticeable on your tracks. ",2016-09-14 21:45:40+00:00,d7mzybz,5.0,t1_d7mvgwg,5558.0,audioengineering
116,"No problem! I record Post-Hardcore/Heavy music mostly but also the polar opposite with Acoustic now and then. I used to make Rap and Instrumental Jazz/Rap Fusion many years ago.

My space only limits me drum wise. I can't afford to sound proof this room. On top of that the acoustics here suck anyway. So I do everything programmed when it comes to drums. Which works for my style of music anyway. Everything else (Guitar/Bass) I record DI. Although I have recorded live amps with no problem in my space. Just close mic it up. Vocals never had issues with a Dynamic or a Condenser. I have really cheap gear too. Behringer Mixer, my most expensive mic is about 150 (I have a few mics though) and it still works well. No creative issues with the room, if anything it helps since it helps me focus on the song more so than the room I'm in.

If you want I can post some work I've done. I do the whole one man band thing so I wrote, played and mixed/mastered everything in this small little room. Just so you know I'm not completely talking out my ass. (While I'm no pro, It's totally workable I believe).

138,"Sure! It's a Mooer Elec Lady clone which is an Electric Mistress clone I believe. I haven't side by sided either but judging by youtube videos they are spot on.

So ok. Set it all to noon. You get some classic flanger but not too heavy. Turn the giant knob up you get some more obviously. Turn it all the way up it's wobbly ufo sounds. Turn it down it's very subtle, almost Chorus like. 

Color knob I'm still figuring what it does .. or how to word it. There's a change for sure. You crank it all the way it oscillates and makes bat shit crazy noise. Move the other 2 knobs to make some crazy sounding stuff.

The Range is simply how fast it goes. The higher up, the more flangy it sounds I find.

I'm new to the Flanger game so I'm still learning this is just day 1 with it. I got huge into The Cure and Post Punk in general as of late and they like their Flange (and Chorus but I have that covered already!) so it inspired me to pick up one at a decent cost. Sounds great for what I want it for! Can go from subtle, to heavy, to crazy ufo sounds. 

Edit: Forgot to mention the review above is on the ""Normal"" Switch. As for the Filter.. it gives it a weird Metallic noise. I don't really like it so I'll explore it later if my heart desires. ",2016-09-04 06:26:23+00:00,d78vi18,2.0,t1_d78ralf,10216.0,guitarpedals

Gretch and Jimmy seem to somewhat be on the same page, Jimmy less than Gretch tho but I think they are showing a good point that Jimmy and Gretch don't really know each other. I hope once they know each other more they won't break up for real this time.

160,"I use an SM58 for my vocals. Mostly screams but some singing (Male Rock Vocals) .. with that said I've messed with spoken word. I've found that EQ is the most important here. I'd start with a hi pass filter to get some of that boomy-ness away. Start at around 40hz and move up until you find the right balance..not too boomy, not too thin. For me personally I find around 60-70hz the sweet spot.

Next anywhere around 300-450 hz I do a fair cut (3-5 db) to get rid of some mud)

Lastly I will add some high end. Anywhere from 8-12k to get some sparkle on it. Not too much just maybe 2-3db tops. Obviously you want to mess with other frequencies if that doesn't do it but that's generally what I do. All depends on the song/voice though.

I have heard great things about Vallhalla and need to get my hands on it when I can afford it. I have not heard of the TSAR or the Toraverb but they look great, especially the Toraverb, will have to look into it and that company in general, thanks!

261,"Late response but I got around to hearing your guy's stuff. I dig it, even just for a home recording. Sounds like a good mix of Shoegaze and alt.rock in general. I love the chorus on this song, especially on the chorus of the song. I dig your vocalist too, smooth voice. Also I noticed you are from Illinois! I'm originally from Chicago but moved to Northwest Indiana but still close to Illinois. Small world-ish. Dig the song though thanks for sharing.

An example I have, I self record and mix/master and all that stuff..so being this is 2 years old the drums and bass aren't mixed too well, I'm far better at it now, so the recording may sound a tad off but this song has this pedal used slightly on bass, slightly on the first guitar riff in the verse and paired with (i can't remember the distortion), distortion at the end. Sum Trem Bar useage too.  https://fryscreamforicecream.bandcamp.com/track/07-stress

As for mixing this chorus with a Fuzz, I have to try that! I have a Behringer Super Fuzz which is an interesting fuzz, probably will be a fun experiment. I might have put it with a Tubescreamer before but its been awhile, gonna try that tonight thanks!

But have you ever paired it with another chorus at the same time? I wonder what noise that would make haha. but true it does work very well with distortion. I love it with the Fulltone OCD. I can go from crazy-ness to smooth to dreamy shoegazy sounds.

The first one, that was thick but so smooth at the same time. Worked with Chords and Single Notes well. Never got it to sound that thick before thanks!

Also the second one, that's beautiful, especially on Chords. Wash sound indeed, has a slight trem sound to it!

My two personal favorite settings are. I like to have every knob cranked for some fun. Almost sounds like a phaser. Pair it with distortion and a good delay it can be some fun noise making I've found.

I also really love this setting thats similar to your wash one, sort of a trem setting with it. Speed A almost at the minimum, Depth A all the way up. Speed B all the way up, Depth B at about 4 o'clock. 

I've also found this pedal works really well with a combo of distortion and a trem bar. It's perfect for some sick bending action!",2016-07-26 05:04:04+00:00,d5r3oc1,6.0,t1_d5r2hb6,2211.0,guitarpedals

but yeah everything I've heard is pretty solid. The Octoplus is pretty awesome. It's only one octave up or down but it works. I've replaced it with a shifter/octave pedal with more diversity but I like to keep this around. It's oddly really cool on vocals or making a sub-bass with my keyboard.

328,"Can I ask if you are using Midi/Programmed/Sample Replaced drums or Acoustic? 

Either way it's an EQ thing for sure. http://www.audio-issues.com/ultimate-eq-guide/ I like this cheat sheet personally. I asked about if they are ""real"" drums or not since you (I feel) can get away with more boost on ""fake/programmed"" drums if needed. Although honestly I feel it'll more so be cutting somewhere between the high mids or the highs in general which is clicky (especially in Samples). Possibly all I'd suggest boosting is the lows or the low mids (if it needs more punch even when removing the click frequency. It's all dependent on the song though, the drum, how it was recorded, etc. The link above might help. 

As others have said, Side Chain with the bass is always a great idea, also Parallel compression can help beef it up. DON'T FORGET tasteful Saturation can REALLY get a kick drum to boom and sound big.

955,"Jesse's scream confuses me. I fry scream which I can tell he does sometimes. For example: Vices, The breakdown of Guernica and so forth. This song/a lot of his screams on this album sounds like he's just shouting. Or shouting with a layer of fry screaming in the back. So it sounds like just yelling which would hurt like hell. So I suggest against trying. Note I could be wrong and he could be using diaphragm in his yells..which idk how to do. I can just scream with it. 

As for his fry screams. as everyone says. Diaphragm. Start with the grudge noise with your tonsils. Then push with your abs like crazy. Start to put a word into it. It'll suck at first but keep practicing. This shouldn't hurt at all and you should feel nothing in your throat. ",2015-12-18 06:10:43+00:00,cy356ye,1.0,t3_3x6vdw,79281.0,brandnew

Awesome tag match...crowd was really into it, some cool spots and continuity with working the leg. 

Happy Corbin won over Apollo. I wasn't expecting them to have Corbin win..let alone clean. 

I loved the strategy of the Bayley vs Nia match. She's too big to do the her normal stuff so Bayley had to work in submission mode. That ending submission looked so awesome.

Really liked the last match. Wasn't sure who'd go over. Surprised it was Finn but that is ok. Both put on a good match. Side note Top Hat Demon Finn is bad ass.

I can sort of see them going Asuka/Nia for awhile with that little forshadowing. Also can see Corbin getting his title shot. Awesome PPV. I'm not sure which was the match of the night for me..and thats how it's supposed to be. ",2015-12-16 22:15:38+00:00,cy1j23y,1.0,t3_3x4umn,517.0,SquaredCircle

I'm unsure about the med thing. It works for some..not others..but I can see Jimmy's point that she should try it because without meds, it's just not working. I'm glad at the end she had the realization it isn't just her she has to worry about, that she has someone who loves her..and that being why she should seek help for her depression.
Also, super cute they both said they love each other (: Season ends on a WAY higher note than last. I feel Season 3 will involve them getting even more serious as well as Gretchen getting help, trying different meds possibly, going to therapy, etc.

Awesome B-Plots all around. Was so happy when Edgar went back for Dorthy. Glad they aren't done and made a compromise for the sake of their relationship. That's what good couples do. Lindsey... I feel bad for her.. but yet I don't.. I don't know. It seems she doesn't know what she wants and just had a realization what she wanted still won't make her happy. It's rough.

Good:

-Enjoying Champ Sheamus actually. Sheamus 5:15!

-We actually had a title match. With a unique stipulation. 

-New Day in 4 segments. Hell yes.

-TOMMY FUCKING DREAMER RETURNED. Sure I was expecting Spike.. but Dreamer was so left field I marked out like crazy.

-Sasha in a match is always good

-Charlotte Heel turn/possible Becky push. SIDE NOTE. I know it seems like they are doing the whole ""Who will Becky choose thing"", but I'm hoping it's more of an emotionally abusive friend thing. Charlotte basically belittled her friend and Becky seemed hurt but was still ""we are friends, you are doing this for my own good"". Could get dark-ish. 

-8 man tag turned into a 7 on 4, then 7 on 3 and didn't end in Roman ""overcoming"" the odds. 



Bad:

-Faces acting like Heels WAY too much. Plus Roman didn't even try to keep the title, gave it away instantly. Why. 

-Predictable outcome to the Title match.

-Wtf was that Adam Rose thing?

-While I liked the match, was tired of Dolph vs. Tyler

-I liked Rusev's mic skills but the whole segment and match with Ryback was pointless

-Too many Count outs/DQ's

On the flipside I feel sorry for Gretch because if (hopefully she will) she starts feeling emotion again. This will crush her.. especially if the relationship is dead.

1357,"Actually everything is to grid/snap since I am playing bass and guitar to midi drunms. Granted they are mixed to sound less robotic.. but they are by default to grid/snap. So I have to be pretty tight/perfect. I tried looping certain parts and such and it just sounds so off and there's no rhythm at all. It probably would be easier if I had an actual drum track or did a whole live recording with a band but sadly I am just one dude who works alone.. so I have to play to a gridded midi track. Good advice though.

my brother, who is also a musician, has heard me play to click and drum tracks and he's saying I'm over thinking it that most of the time I'm on beat.

But hey guys I have a question or 2, I'd appreciate any help. I was given two mics today. The one pictured I can't identify was on a Radio Shack Kick Drum Stand .. probably from the 70s or 80s. It requires a ton of gain but doesn't feedback or hiss which is good. It is mostly low end and a fair amount of mid. A bit muddy mid wise. Not much high end. Would not use it for vocals other than maybe screams if they weren't ballsy enough. Anyone have an idea what this mic is and what it's practical use would be?  

The other is the Shure PE53 (not pictured). Which is a Vocal/Harmonic mic. Which I'm told is similar to the Shure Bullet Mic..  lower quality I assume but it's a cool mic. Sounds ok on vocals if I want something pretty bright or even effecty. Obviously awesome on harmonica. Just wondering, any other uses for this mic? I hear people use it as an extra mic to blend to add grit to a drum track. 

Thanks for any help. ",2015-10-18 05:35:31+00:00,cw3qfcj,1.0,t3_3p75ei,237.0,audioengineering

I went to cook myself some Ramen and when I came back to the room with the TV, there was a random screen with a guy (well a shadow of a guy in a hoodie) pointing a gun at the screen while there was screaming in the background noise. It said something on screen then about preventing gun violence. It scared the living shit out of me, still makes me cringe thinking about it.

1447,"Recording is the bane of my existence. I don't mind recording others, but when it comes to record myself. Oh I hate it. I play every instrument (I one man band it) .. and I make Post-Hardcore music, so there are a lot of layers to record. So I go fucking crazy at times. Having to keep perfect tempo for multiple layers is a pain. Then vocals is a mother fucker. I have the same issues as you with recording at home and such. It's worst when I have acid reflux and bad allergies, that even on days its perfect to record, sometimes they prevent me from being able to do vocals.

It's a pain, but just have to rough it out the best you can. It makes the final results so much more worth it since you know the hell you put into it. as for the 13 listens.

An observation though.. Morty is obviously becoming more cynical, less emotional. Yet Rick is more emotional now.

Go to a ton of label's websites, look at their Contact section or FAQ section. 9/10 they have if they take demos or not. Most indie/some major-ish do. Usually sending a soundcloud or bandcamp link is requested. 

It takes awhile though. I sent, maybe a year ago, 30 label's my first EP (dumb choice..shoulda waited till my band grew a bit) and 3 got back to me in the past year.

1522,"Hey guys. I need someone's opinion on this mixtape track. I'm usually a rock/metal mixer myself, but as a favor for my best friend, who is a rapper, I agreed to mix/master his mixtape. Issue is I haven't mixed rap in about 5 years.. let alone a mixtape. All I have is a pre-mastered mp3 instrumental, so I'm going crazy at the loss of dynamics. So I'm trying my best to make it decent at least and not like. .super shitty like some mixtapes. With that said, I'm going crazy trying to figure out if this is ""good enough"". I tried using the actual song of the instrumental he used (Melancholy Hopeful by Marcus D) as a reference but that didn't help much, being those were mixed with stems and alas, I have no stems obviously. With that said, if anyone can give me feedback, I'd appreciate it so much, literally going insane here.

I guess my two biggest questions are. Did I HPF too much? Or Too Little? I have issues determining that on Rap vocals. Also, Are the vocals loud enough or too low?

I'd appreciate it guys thank you in advance

1599,"Old style of finishing a song (Note I am a one man Post Hardcore band) : 

I don't have a drum set so I program my drums (in post production they sound fairly passable I'm told) .. with that said, I'll basically have a basic drum pattern, set it at a normal Post-Hardcore tempo. Start to improvise guitar. Once I have a guitar part, I'll find the best tempo for it. Find the best tempo. Record. Then I'll improvise and record second guitar or synths/piano. Then improvise/record bass. Then complex the drums up. When I feel inspiration, write and record screaming vocals. Then Mix/Master over whatever span it takes (each song is different).

I never demo'd any songs

New style I've been working with:

Write a guitar riff. Usually just messing around on the guitar until something sounds good to my ears. Find the tempo. Practice it like crazy to a click track. Then program the drums for the song at that tempo. Record the guitar. Then write and record the bass track, this could take anywhere from an hour to a few days to get the right riff to go along. Then I usually improvise a second guitar part to go along with the first. That way I keep a bit of improvisation in my recording. If it's not the best recording I can do, I WILL re-record. Making the original file a demo, which I didn't do demo's in the past, so now I'll perfect songs instead of using the first take I do. Then same vocal technique as before. Mix and Master however long until it's good to my ears. 

As for settings I forgot to mention. I'll tend to mess with tones and effects for some time on guitar and bass. I use a lot of guitar effects for leads. I have a good amp setting for leads and a good amp setting for rhythm guitars. Leads + effect usually gets a bit of changing tone wise but usually for each project/EP/Album I do, I'll use the same tone for each song.

1606,"Already added Fat Animal on my personal page (gonna add on my band page too) and will do the same for Noise Witch now. Will totally keep in touch, I'll shoot you a message tomorrow or so since I'm gonna pass out after this response.

I have a love/hate for Mars Volta. I like their later works more cause I feel by then they established their goal of the band better. I think, like you said, it took awhile (still taking some time for me) to get fully into them since it's basically ATDI doing a different genre, so hearing their signature traits as artist (manly the guitar work and vocals) but in a different genre, it's always felt pretty odd. Not bad though, especially their later work, just I guess I always held them to a high expectation and used to the artist in that band making heavier, gritter music. A lot also has to do with the more polished production sound. It's been awhile since I gave their older albums a spin, might have to do that again soon.

His energy was fucking nuts, highly emotional lyrics and performances. His vocal range was nuts, he'd go from melodic to psycho and back down and back up so easily. His control was crazy. Not just on the recordings but even live while jumping around like crazy. I can only imagine what actually being at one of their shows was like.

ATDI are fucking legends. Even their last album which they aren't too found of, is a fucking masterpiece. I can't say I've heard another band with the energy of the vocalist and the instrumentation equaling each other. 

Thanks man, and I dig your approach too. You don't like to be simplistic, don't do cookie cutter shit and that I can respect. True artist shit right there. And thanks for your words on that man I try. I sort of am going that route honestly. The last song I wrote for it is errie as fuck. Think like.. It Follows soundtrack (if you haven't heard this, my god that is some great electronic music) meets overdriven screaming, then goes into a creepy rap breakdown where my voice is like cracking lol. I hope I can execute it well when I mix it. ",2015-08-29 08:25:37+00:00,cujkh1a,11.0,t1_cujkeb8,339.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers
1610,"I honestly think its mixed fairly well. The only gripe I have with the mixing is I feel the drums could be mixed a bit better/a little wetter but it's not bad by any means. Sort of fits the style honestly. As for it changes too much, while i only heard the one song (I'll letcha know when I hear more tomorrow, really interested, gave you guys a like on FB btw) ... I find that songs changing a lot is great, its abstract, it gives you multiple sections to like. I prefer my music like that. So yeah that is totally criticism I'd dismiss, since what they are criticizing is actually a good thing not many artist can pull off. 

With NoiseWitch. I feel its fine like that, again, it's abstract and complex. If you can build a wall of sound, build that wall 100 feet fucking high. It may a bit hard to get vocals to sit in a mix if that is the goal, but just as is, it's awesome as is. It's sort of like Flying Lotus' music, it's abstract, a lot going on at once and that's what makes it stand from the pact. I'd honestly say keep doing what you are doing because it's working. Sadly most listener's like simplistic and thats why Top 40 is such shit most of the time. So they don't know shit lol.

No problem man, I really dig it and will be following your music man, you are a true artist it seems which I highly respect.

Thanks for listening and giving your feedback, most in depth dissection someone's given me in a long time so thanks for taking your time out. Thanks for saying it's emotional, that's really my goal. You are also the first person to figure out what I do vocally. I mix it dry to give a personal feeling. I (while I do put some distortion on vocals), try not to over do so it doesn't sound too artificial. I don't even layer, unless for effect. Which also gives it that raw, personal feeling I feel, not for everyone but thats what I try to convey since I see my music as my way of getting heavy shit off my chest so I don't want it to sound as human as possible. So while it can be awkward/uncomfortable to hear, that's sort of my goal. Because I'm uncomfortable, so I want to make other's feel that for some reason lol. Admittingly my next EP I'm working on, I'm doubling because the songs call for it, so hopefully that'll kill some of the criticism lol. 

What type of Post-Hardcore were you into when you were into it? I really was into Thursday, Early Thrice, At The Drive In and Brand New. Give or take an album or 2 from each, a lot less processed and raw sounding vocally than most Post-Hardcore bands today. So I take influence there.

As for the electronic/hip hop stuff, I gave Toy Airplane a spin. Fuck dude you are one talented person. This is better than the stuff I'd make. This gives me a sort of J Dilla meets Nujabes vibe. I really like it man, also looking forward to hear more.

Do you have any music I can listen to of your own? I used to do electronic/hip hop stuff for many years before switching to more rock/metal based music, so I'm always down to hear what you got.

1882,"I agree with basically what everyone is saying. Over compression is the biggest factor I feel. As well as duplicating guitar tracks far more...as well as bass being recorded through DI more than ever. 

Besides the listed above (both play a HUGE part) .. the fact that the guitars are edited to not have any feedback or harsher frequencies, give it that super digital sound. Hell the guitars could have been recorded all digitally.. instead of a mic'd amp, so that alone will give that sound. Also.. shocked nobody said this. Samples for drums. Most of the newer songs are 100 percent sampled/triggered drums. Super clean, polished, machine sounding drums will suck the human touch out in a heart beat. Mix that with insane amounts of compression, a ton of distortion and layers on screams, layered/perfect sounding guitars.. it will bring this result. August Burns Red still sounds mostly the same since I believe they don't sample replace, or at the very least blend their drummer playing with samples. So it gives the songs more grit and human like touch. Its not 100 percent perfectly processed drums. ",2015-08-09 07:04:38+00:00,ctwojuq,1.0,t3_3gb9x4,13274.0,audioengineering

So It was a ""I'm ok with what ever happens"" Well..lived..and pills HURT LIKE HELL.

1885,"Honestly don't think each genre is beaten dead. Take for instance Rap/Hip-Hop. There's a few albums taking a more progressive tone. Specifically Kendrick Lamar's past 2 albums and Dr.Dre's new album. I see a lot of progressive rock influences. Not the rock part, but the progressive part. 

As for Metal, there will be new ways I feel. I mean Djent isn't that old and thats pretty much a new-ish style of metal. With something like metal, there are so many guitar tones, guitar pedals, vocal styles. I feel a new genre or subgenre can really take hold at any time.

1929,"A bit late responding but thanks for the honest feedback man, this is why I love this subreddit. I'm glad you liked the reverb, its my favorite part honestly. The kick and bass yeah big issues there I noticed. I wasn't sure if it was just me but I didn't really have anyone to sound check. I spent the past 24 hours re-working on my bass rig and I think I got a WAY fuller sound, so thanks for that comment. As for the kick, maybe I need to find a good sample..I agree it is pretty boxy.  So def. will work on those

As for the guitars..I feel they aren't too weak, but I know what you mean about something being off. I say about weak cause, the genre I tend to go for, sort of calls for these type of guitars... mostly clean with a little OD on it.. so it sounds a bit thin..but you are right something is off. I'm guilty of the mid-range scoop. I used to be a like death metal guy so its a habit lol. But thanks for putting that out, I also worked on my tone and between mid-scoop and layering it gave a fuller sound so thanks there.

So glad i saw the whole season already. Fuck that was amazing. I posted in the Bojack subreddit, but I liked this season more than 1. 1 was amazing but it took time to fruitate, season 2 picked up right where season 1 left off. Same humor, really funny, but also, dark, really dark, darker than season 2. Which i love about the show. It makes me laugh but also I can relate to it. This show..an animated show, is the most accurate representation of depression I've seen in a show. I deal with a lot of the same issues Bojack and Diane deal with. Its amazing writing. I'm interested in where Bojack will go from here with New York and such. It does get me down to know, although uplifting of a finale, it doesn't mean he's fixed by any means.

It wasn't just Bojack feeling deep depression, most of the characters had moments that just hit you in the gut. Even characters like MR. PB who is the happiest guy, you saw some deep, dark shit.

**It Follows** - Directed by David Robert Mitchell. Genre: Horror

I've been wanting to see this movie FOREVER so I'm glad to see it. It lived up to the hype and more I feel. The way it was filmed was beautiful, I got a big 80s-90s style with the way it would transition from one scene to another. The film and dialogue was really intimate and unlike other horror films, you don't want anything to happen to these characters. As for the plot, I loved it, it did take some researching, but I'm all for a movie that is up for interpretation. While it wasn't ""scary scary"" it was creepy at parts and what ""IT"" stood for, any way you interpret it, was deep and I loved it. Can I mention the soundtrack too? So creepy and Errie, it fit the tone PERFECTLY. I know this films been talked about 100 times over on here, but I give this a **high recommendation**. 

**The Loved Ones** - Directed by Sean Byrne. Genre: Horror

WARNING: This film is so disturbing its crazy, not for everyone. It's a torture porn-ish film, but it has a pretty good plot for this type of film. Basically about a girl who gets rejected from a guy for prom, so she kidnaps him and tortures him. The acting of Lola in this film is what makes it for me. The actress did a great job of scaring the hell out of you, believably sadistic, evil, cruel, just completely crazy. Her father is just as crazy. I really don't know what else to say other than its a Hostel-style film, but without a cringe worthy plot and likeable characters. **Mildly Recommend** 

and lastly... a big difference from what else I saw this week:

**I Am Not A Hipster** Director: Destin Daniel Cretton. Genre: Indie Drama/Music Drama

I love Destin's film Short Term 12, its honestly my favorite drama movie. So i back tracked and wanted to check out his other full length film. While it was fairly different, I was not disappointed. Being a musician this movie hit more home for me. Being depressed and wondering why you are doing what you are doing is hard, so hard...and this film captures the motions of it perfectly. The acting was phenomenal. You could feel his pain, it wasn't melodramatic, it was real pain. The plot is sort of indie-ish in the sense its nothing GREAT, but it drives home the story of this character and shows why he is why he is, while giving a glimpse into his possible future. The music is also fantastic too, performed by the actor. Really good music. **Highly Recommend**",2015-07-07 00:48:05+00:00,csug96e,1.0,t3_3c72uu,124984.0,TrueFilm

I was so depressed, granted I'm still really depressed, but for awhile a few episodes of Community a day, and then searching up on the show/discussing on the subreddit really helped me forget about my problems. It helps the show has a theme about broken people getting a second chance. 

P.S. Community's creator also is a co-creator of Rick and Morty

Edit: If you are in the mood for a Dramedy.. and I stress, its not for everyone cause while its funny, it is depressing as hell, I just binged Bojack Horseman in the last 24 hours and that really helped me through one of the worst weeks I can remember.
