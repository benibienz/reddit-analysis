Hey all, I have a Boss Eh-2 Enhancer that I don't have use for. Works like a charm, no issues. It's old so there's little cosmetic scratches on the side paint wise but nothing major and nothing that affects how this pedal works.

I've seen people say this works somewhat as an EQ of sorts. I can tell it brightens your sound. I've also heard it can give some dynamics back that you may lose. I've tried it after a few dirt pedals and it's just not my thing. I thought it deserves a home for someone who can put it to good use.

What I want. I'm on the hunt for a few things:
1.Dirt Pedals. I'm a fan of Rats, Fulltone OCD's, Joyo Ultimate Drive (aka an OCD clone) or Boss Ds-1. 
2.Flanger Pedals. No preference
3.A mix of the two or others. For instance if you want to offer like 2 cheaper used pedals, I'm game.
4.This is an odd request but willing to trade straight up for a *halfway* decent used Acoustic Guitar.

Thanks all!",letstradepedals,WTT: Boss EH-2 Enhancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/letstradepedals/comments/4xp7xp/wtt_boss_eh2_enhancer/

Upon researching I see it's gotten some acclaim but seems to have flown under the radar compared to other (somewhat) art films of this sort. I found it an amazing movie. It was heartfelt, the acting was exactly what the film needed, the soundtrack was great and finally, what impressed me the most, the cinematography. Be it CGi or the nature spots they picked to film, it was visually stunning. I got big Enter The Void vibes from the visuals that were computer created. Different of course but similar trippy, colorful, hell even creepy elements. All of these packed together really made a wonderful film. I'd highly recommend it. I do, however, say if you have epilepsy not to watch it. The main character has epilepsy and she deals with it throughout the movie, which, while a unique character trait (and somewhat plot of the film), due to this, you see a lot of lights flashing and stuff like that, which might be trigger-sum for those who have it.

It's an odd situation since I live in Indiana but my friends and their family live in Utah..but that's only a minor detail in this. Anyway, they've been homeless before but have lived in an Apartment in Utah which is about 1200 a month rent. The 4 of them squeeze into this small apartment. Not ideal but a home is a home. Anyway my best friend is 25, her and her mother are the workers to support the household. They lost their job at the call center they worked at (a job they frequent) and now they can't afford rent. They have no family to turn to, no friends.. nothing that can provide help. I'd take them in if I could be they live so far away and I/my family are still getting out of a struggle ourselves, so we can't provide them anything. They've applied for numerous jobs for weeks but no luck. Unemployment won't even help them (unassumingly due to their credit history but idk). They do receive food stamps though which is good. Their only hope was, my friend I'm discussing, is an author and a painter with a few published books and many pieces of art (paintings, canvas prints, etc.) for sale. They made one sale in a week but it wasn't for much.. they've posted everywhere we can think... we had one potential buyer but they backed out. So sadly that option (as well as a GoFundMe) have failed...unless a miracle happens in 5 days. 

They would move into their car and apply for jobs, but the idea they'd live in their car, in the cold Utah weather...for who knows how long until they find work. Scares me. They are such great people I just wished there was something more I can do. I feel like a bad friend that I can't help more. Do you guys have any advice I could give them to help? Please and thank you. 

Edit: Ok the unemployment denial isn't due to Credit. I'm not exactly sure, I know they filed but they never got back to them and it's been over a month now.

Also, items can not be sold since they have nothing to sell. No Furniture, TV, etc. ",Assistance,"I want to help my friend and her family who will be Homeless in 5 days, but I'm out of ideas.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/42vk8l/i_want_to_help_my_friend_and_her_family_who_will/

47,2015-11-21 10:07:58+00:00,self.mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/3tofo3/hey_guys_not_looking_for_a_diagnosis_of_course/,False,"Hey guys. After a week of hitting my ""I feel nothing"" stage of depression I do at times, I was wondering what else I could do to fix my life. Before, I was watching Jessica Jones on Netflix, who has PTSD. So I looked a lot into it, for I was once diagnosed and deemed ""cured"". For the time being.

A little back story, I am now 22, about to be 23. When I was 18 I came down with an unknown disease that made me unable to swallow anything, be it liquids, food, my own saliva (I'd have to spit it out or else I'd choke on it). I lost 50 pounds, was in the hospital constantly due to dehydration and nourishment. Would pass out at times, had a stroke.. just.. so much bad shit. My parents were told by doctors if this kept up for another month or 2 I would have died, as I was told I was ""wasting away"". This went on for 8 months before the 100th doctor or so figured it was Silent Reflux. Aka Acid Reflux that showed no symptoms until now. I had it my whole life. It burned my throat causing it impossible to swallow. Anyway I was cured in 2 months time of medicine. It took awhile to re-learn how to swallow and such though. 

Then the panic attacks started. 

I always had anxiety and depression as a teen. I had self harm issues but it was never too serious. Not compared to now at least. I never had panic attacks. But I found myself having multiple a day for months. I became claustrophobic. I became super conscious of my breathing and swallowing so I would over breathe. Anyway .. the panic attacks and my weird random symptoms went away in half a year with therapy and meds.

Fast forward to now. Some things I just learned to live with in 4 years time .. I don't like it but I thought it was just my general anxiety and depression. Which sure plays a part. Admittingly, a lot of things in my life have happened that really suck the past few years since recovering so depression and anxiety make sense. So I though that was normal and being taken care of by my meds. While they do help a bit.. not as much as I hope. Some things they never fixed.

-I still am conscious of my breathing and swallowing. Every time I eat I think about when I'd choke from attempting to when I was sick. I also always am conscious of my breathing. I will have panic attacks, feel weak, dizzy, etc., because I never feel I'm breathing enough..when honestly I am, I am just breathing heavy because I am thinking about breathing. If I'm distracted I don't think about it.. but a lot of the times watching a movie, tv, talking to someone, I am over conscious of my breathing and hyperventilate. 

- When I eat, I always have to grab something and squeeze it. I don't know why. It's like a safety net for me when I eat.

- I still get horrible anxiety attacks. Not as bad as I used to, but I still have panic attacks, which all started after I got sick. I also became suicidal and attempted to kill myself last year. I was never suicidal until I was sick. Granted a lot has happened in my life since then to make me so.. but as I and everyone I love noticed, my stability has never been close to what it once was when I got sick.

-This one I've been told I'm over thinking, but I get startled so easily. It's crazy how often I jump up screaming by being startled by something as simple as a little tap on the shoulder unexpectedly, or my name being called. This never happened until after I got sick. 

-I also am more prone to starting arguments with family and friends. Not violent ones, but I can get mad at people for the dumbest reasons and it ruins our relationships.

-Lastly, dreams and memories. I was in the hospital a lot in those 8 months. Also I spent time in a mental hospital from trying to kill myself. I have frequent dreams of being in both.. and it freaks me out when I'm in the dream, I know I have to get out because I don't want to be there. When I wake up I'm always depressed for the rest of the day. Also, my house is flooded with memories of where I had really bad health issues. Being I don't work or go to school for other reasons (money/health/etc.) .. I'm surrounded by these memories and they really mess with me. 

I'll stop there. I'm sorry if this is long and pointless. I've never really opened up about this because I'm afraid to bring it up and be written off by those I love. I caused them enough issues and the guilt of having more health/mental issues scares me from bringing this up. What do you guys think though? Should I get a screening for PTSD? 

Edit: For what it's worth, I'm diagnosed with Anxiety and Major Depressive Disorder. Also my therapist said with my family history and my.. well me-ness, there is a chance I could have Bi-Polar. I never got it tested or anything because my insurance got dropped.

It is a film about a man who's wife dies of cancer and shows him getting his life back together. With that said, it uses flashbacks and fast forwards heavily. Usually when movies do this, it feels forced to me or not as fluid as I'd hope, but with this movie, it was perfect and didn't distract at all. It added to the emotional depth perfectly. Which, besides the well written script, the actors did perfect. It wasn't a melo-drama cancer based film, it felt real. I was just blown away.

Just wondering if anyone here saw it. I can't see much about this film on here. Part to do with it being a limited release film I feel.

I was blown away, yet disturbed. If you don't know about the snowwtown murders, its a REALLY messed up true event about a group of serial killers. This movie is based on these events. With that said, the script was really disturbing but it was interesting, since, sadly it is based on a true story that is so messed up it sparks the interest. What really made the film for me was the acting and the direction. The acting was spot on, it made me feel how heartless these people were and how scared others were. I began to think the actors were the real life criminals. They were perfect. The direction style along with the soundtrack push it to the next level too. If the plot, occasional gore, rape, etc. wasn't unsettling enough, the bleak/gloomy film style and location really gave an uneasy feeling in your gut along with the creepy ambient soundtrack. 

Such an unfortunate movie to be based on a true story, but real life based crime movies usually bore me and seem to glorify to an extent the criminals, not the case here, it was interesting and I feel it was cause they portrayed these people as the messed up people they really are.
