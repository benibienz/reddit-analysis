**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

- Is the i7-6700k overkill, or will the i5-6600k be sufficient?
- Will the build produce a lot of noise? If so, any changes/additions on how to reduce it? (I selected a noise reducing case to help with this).
- Is the case size needed? Or can I go for something smaller?
- I'm open to any other part suggestions to improve the build in general. ",buildapc,Looking for Critique on my Build,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/4g1ulk/looking_for_critique_on_my_build/
