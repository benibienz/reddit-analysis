And honestly, I cannot answer that for you, as I do not know her. The only one that can answer that would be yourself. But just remember: If you meet people with trust, you will be trusted. So I think she trusts you. And it definently is wise to get back with her, if you do like her and she likes you. You seem to be getting along well. 

Awesome!

And thank you! But just because God is my father doesn't mean that I'm Godsend. I think...",2015-07-11 19:32:37+00:00,cszy41v,7.0,t1_cszxopr,867.0,Tinder
204,"I am very happy to hear that!

Well, the question is: Do you still like her? Was it a healthy relationship overall, or what? If she is sending signals that she wants to get back together (which I get the impression of), then you should try and get back together with her if you still want to.

Regarding the bio, I have an idea for you: https://i.imgur.com/hu96Bdc.jpg

Regarding the pictures, I would actually suggest that you get rid of them all if possible, or at least add some that arent just selfies and where they see your braces, as I don't think the girls on Tinder appreciates those. Have any pics without braces?

Why don't you get a wingman then? Wingmen are a fantastic help at times, and I'm sure one of your friends will be happy to help!",2015-07-11 19:06:54+00:00,cszxclg,5.0,t1_cszwkay,1563.0,Tinder

First of: The description is a bit too... cliché? I'm not sure what to call it, it just not appealing. It is fine that you write what you like, but don't go on Tinder and write ""...and you're my best friend instantly"". That one kills the Tinder-game! You're not on tinder for best friends, right? You should at least try to come up with something fun to write in your bio! Try surfing /r/Tinder for inspiration. Or else, I might just PM you my bio if you want!
You should also get rid of at least 3 of your pictures, as they are very alike. Think about placing some pictures of you doing a fun activity or being at a fun event or being at a turist attraction (show that you are well-travelled). Or just anything that shows that you do other stuff than taking selfies :)

Secondly: I am gonna do this even tho it is going to hurt to say.

The Tinder game is really, really hard if you are not very good looking. And you are not in the league of being very good looking. Don't get me wrong, you are not ugly! You are just average-looking. And girls on Tinder are very picky, especially on the looks, and since you get matches by looks on Tinder, and the ammount of likes people get are limited, you probably won't get many matches. Even then, just getting to meet a Tindermatch takes a lot of luck, and you really have to just click with the person.

So my tip to you is: If you do not come up with a better description, and do not have better pictures of yourself, *don't* use Tinder as a way of finding love, because that is REALLY hard. Of the 400+ matches I have had, I have only dated 3 people, and only one of those I dated for longer than just 3 dates.

Trust me when I say this: You are gonna have a lot more luck with finding love in the nightclubs. There, you actually have a chance of letting the girls getting to know you before they deside ""he is not in the cathegory of very hot guys. I'm gonna skip."". 

I hope this helped, and sorry if it sounds a bit harsh, but such is reality my friend.",2015-07-11 18:02:12+00:00,cszve0y,3.0,t1_cszuaj8,2156.0,Tinder
