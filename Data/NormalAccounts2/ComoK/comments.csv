0,"I like to keep the top CP of every pokemon candy line, and most IV 89+.  I also keep all snorlax/lapras/tangela/porygon/chancy ulta rare types.  I have probably 30+ strong eevee evolution army.  I keep most of the high IV dratini from before they were nerfed.  So that's probably like 400 pokemon, then I have another 50-100 top rated IV pokemon I still have to run thru a calculator, and another 100+ evolution fodder that I'm waiting to egg.

98,"Honestly I think the real reason things are less and less fun is because trading has broken down in general.

There are a few reasons for this.  And actually I think its the opposite of what you are saying, I think they killed trading mostly by trying to recapture secondary profits.  Losing lots of active/larger/long term players definitely hurts the trading economy as well...

1. The flooding of inserts, when almost every insert is $1 to pickup, why bother trading.  There's very little upside to flip, so your market makers don't bother (no profit), and also lots of people probably will just directly buy the inserts, why bother with fan feed.

2. When most of the whales can directly buy the rare cards and not have to trade, there goes another source of trading, and profit opportunities for trading.

3. And finally they made most sets death marches that lock most smaller players into draining all their credits and having no ability to even contemplate chasing more than one set, so they basically cannot trade at all, since they have to dump everything into whatever daily death march they selected.

All of this isn't particularly fun, instead of being able to pull and collect stuff you like and trade and complete many sets.  You have your selection of 18 days of blueprints, 30 days of lonely path collecting, 15 days of death star, and marathons that are completely not worth spending credits to pull given how little they are worth now.  A lot of these issues stem completely from the poorly designed sets/odds and timing of releases.  Its not fun, and I don't think burning out your players results in better spending.  Before many could complete a few sets of 6-8 cards at once (with each worth ~$10).  Now they have to collect 15-20 cards that are still only worth $10, and they can only complete one.  A lot of this is due to Topps not treating this like an economy that needs to be healthy.  Instead it seems like they viewing it as a short term cash extraction operation.  More fun and a lot less blatant cash grab would honestly go a long way...

1. Does this guy spend money?  (Seems like a clear yes)
2. Is this guy a net positive for the community? (Lots of trades, has lots of rare cards, lots of people have traded with him, I'd say so)

I think they definitely need to recalibrate things.

The best way to make this thing actually popular is to seed resources into ALL packs, make them part of all loot tables.  Make schematics more available is definitely important too.

With gold EW they turned that into the never ending set of EW to get enough of them out there.

Who knows if this works, my guess is it has to make some people break down and buy those extra credits to open a few more packs during that hot moment.  As a collector I don't really like this pace since its overwhelming, and it just forces me to skip entire sets since its just too much work to try and chase everything at once.  I don't even have to buy master access now since they split the red edge from the master access ones :)  They already learned and went with timed variant inserts to prevent the stacking (which reduces the reason to buy master access even more!)

Shrug, I think this is just a case of putting too many sets out at once.  Which makes interest in the individual sets lower than they would be otherwise, and makes the liquidity / ease of trading in all sets lower (probably an unintended side effect of too many active sets going on and a finite player pool)

I don't really care how many sets they put out at once in the end, but it ends up just being wasted content (to me), since there's only so many sets I can chase at once.

551,"So I usually don't like to comment much on these silly fair trade threads.  But I can explain it pretty simply.

There are two rough buckets of traders.

1. Fair traders (who believe every trade should be equal, very few people actually are here, but the people who constantly complain about greed typically consider themselves to be in this group)

2. For profit traders (who for the most part try to 'win' every trade, most of the players fall into this bucket, whether they admit it or not, unless you spend all day sending base cards 1:9 to noobs, you are likely making offers that are helping you out in some way...its a very rare person that offers bad trades for themselves)

I've always maintained a 1:1 is never fair unless its a mutual dupe for need swap of the same set same rarity near the end of the set.  In general you need to offer trades that are slanted slightly towards the other trader if you really expect them to accept it.  Otherwise they are ambivalent and you are just counting on them being nice.

Now back to high rollers.  If they have everything you offer, and you are offering them stuff they don't need.  You have 0 leverage.  You basically are expecting them to do you a favor.  So hence you need to overpay.  You might think a 2:1 is a huge overpay greedy, but to them, that might be the only thing that makes it worth their time.  Trading is all about leverage, and unless you have something the other party wants, you basically cannot expect the trade to be fair, since they could care less if the trade happens.

The golden rule is this: the person making the offer is almost always making a trade in their favor.  that is why they offered it.  Even if its the most ridiculous 'overpay'.  They sent the trade, its impossible by definition for it not to be something in their favor.  To expect people to OFFER you a fair trade is silly.  If you want good trades in YOUR favor, you need to be the one sending offers.  

Most offers are going to be bad ones when you look at things this way.  It takes time and effort to send out offers, as a result, most offers come from the for profit camp.  Fair traders do their 1:1 swaps or whatever and even out their dupes and are done... But people who are trying to trade up (i.e. you don't get from one white zuckuss to vintage han by doing fair trades) are creating value through effort/making trades.

Bonus tip:  if you want more trades to happen, counter more, and don't bother leaving snide comments, because the for profit camp really really doesn't care :)",2015-10-06 05:42:00+00:00,cvptnfk,12.0,t1_cvpaa5w,34279.0,starwarstrader

The first 2-3 white hoarding chases were interesting, but honestly I have no appetite for doing this on a regular basis, and I got the same impression from other people I helped hoard.  I like hoarding when its something you do when bored.  Spending all day on a weekend to 'chase' just turns it into work for me.  I view it as a fun passive activity, I really don't enjoy being forced to spending 8-12 hours grinding whites.  And that's why I think this simply won't work for very long.  If you look at the R2 chase, that one dropped down to around 3k to be top 20 just because fatigue set in.

577,"So I think there's a few issues with the current design compared to the old.  In actuality with the old way, most people had a shot at the top 20 starting from 0 if you wanted to grind whites.  The new way, almost noone can get 5000 whites in one day starting from 0 in 24 hours.  I would guess the counts will end up less than 20 now, unless these cards start selling for a ton (which might be possible initially, but fatigue will set in if there is one for every character).  I also think if each is going to require 5k, it should just always be available in SD.  The time limitation mostly just makes the count really low as there's almost no one that can go from 0 to 5000 easily without buying a ton of whites.  I personally didn't care much about the name part, but I'd imagine that added a ton of value to some people.  

Honestly as a hoarder, I would rather keep my 5000 whites, and buy someone elses shredded award.  Do you know how much time it takes to gather 5000 whites? lol

As a simple example, clearly they can't sell 30 days of master access for $30, anyone can see that's a terrible deal.  $15 for 30 days?  Still seems a horrible deal.  $10/30?  maybe.  I was just throwing out a straw man, but I'm pretty confident that the true value of master access (if you aren't buying credits) is probably only $5 for the month :)

I say this because unless you buy credits you are extremely unlikely to pull any of the high end variants, so its a very small kicker to your EV.

Base are effectively free chaff that get dumped out as part of opening packs for inserts.  To assign them credit cost is completely missing what they actually are to a lot of people (free junk that comes with the insert lotto).  As someone who moves a lot of base, actually the only thing I find matters, is your time when moving base.  I don't think anyone sane should spend the time worth breaking a yellow down to red, down to blue, into whites 9:1.  Any 'profit' you made there, you could make better by flipping ANY card with a spread on the feed...

Its just a huge time sink time offering trades and selecting cards, I don't think whether you use red, or blue, or yellow factors much into it at all once you have a large supply of base. You almost certainly will be time (fatigue bound)

Another huge disclaimer, not all whites are equal. The difference between a popular white and a useless white is huge

The main reason why I think purely evaluating base like this, is the same flaw as if you hypothesized that all 50 counts should be roughly equal in value.  Just because there are 25% less blues than whites, does not mean they should be 4x as valuable.  I guarantee you the pyramid will almost always be MAX # of cards in a trade for one of the higher base.

1. First insert (green JST lol)
2. First quote =&gt; a Set (got you into the next tier)
3. Sepia =&gt; Boba (at this point I think you were basically done, since boba was in the highest tier of demand)

1000,"My take on it is, topps has figured out how to get us to pay more.  The answer is flood us with so many cards/sets that we don't have enough credits, and keep the most popular ones going for a long time.  Its intentional that they have created triple dips I think.  Master access now is a no brainer to me whenever I get to 100k+ credits, as you basically 2x the amount of inserts you get for 99c, with all these triple/quadruple dips its a no brainer.  They have dropped a bunch of interesting sets all at once, to get people to spend money/buy credits/get master access.  This a good thing.  

I for one much prefer this explosion of cards, as opposed to the old days where all you can do is bash your head around the same 3-4 cards that people were moving.  

The drawback is definitely you get spread thin, and its much harder to be focused now with 5 new drops a day in 5 different sets... I do feel overwhelmed as well :)  But I like it...",2015-07-13 22:14:52+00:00,ct285fd,1.0,t3_3d4rhs,26572.0,starwarstrader
