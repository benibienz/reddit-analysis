I've read most of the guides which were written 2 mos back, so I have a general idea of what I'm working towards (card augment, clear all single player, save up to buy mobius box, etc).  

My primary question is what should I be focusing on next with my stamina (Chapter 3.1/Infinite arena/or the new tower/farming augments)?  And for MP should I focus on skills for my one pulled job (ranger?)

Current status:

- Cleared Chapters 1,2 + Explorations 1/2.  Working on Chapter 3.1.
- Infinite arena, I can do easy, and I've cleared the first treasure area, but the next sections are red and too hard

Jobs

- Pulled Ranger (Close to finishing panel 3), Starter jobs are about all about done with 3rd panel (not doing starter ranger anymore ofc)

Abilities:

- Amazon (Rolled)
- Bought: fenrir, hades, salamander, fafnir
- Have weak lvl 2 ability MP 3*s and chapter drops

Basically I just want to catch up as efficently as possible, so I want to avoid dumping stuff into abilities that will not be useful once I'm caught up.  But I've had to spread out and level warrior/mage to clear content so I haven't really been focusing on ranger to this point figuring its best to rush the content...?

For example with all these low count variants, they could have at the same time introduced permanent den variants like an unlimited 1000 white/500blue/250red/100yellow shreds for a thick variant border(like the pink for golds).  And these might actually end up as pretty useful currency long term for trading too, as more of a premium hoarding unit.

These add value to base which would indirectly make opening packs more valuable, and also give people things to do other than hoarding (which is pretty boring if you ask me).

Most of the new sets were modeled after TK death marches it appears :/

Examples of death marches:

- 77 (66 days of daily drops)
- TK (44 days of near daily drops with random vacations)
- Space Paintings (Is this one finally done?)

Knowing how many inserts in a set, and whether an award is there is good and all.  But given that the last few sets have had (21, 15, 18, 20, 29) on daily release schedules...  I mean its great for stacking inserts if that's the goal...

It might be a good time to remind Topps what we like.

So if you look at the high demand popular sets, they almost always were short and compact.

- Reflections (6 cards + award)
- Del Rey (7 cards, for some reason no award)
- WoSW, Prism, Badges, Quotes 1 (8-10 cards)

So for me, after the subjective ""do I like the set question?""  The top 2 things I like in a set are:

1. Compact (6-9 cards + award) [And EVERY set should have an award, otherwise be like huddle and say its a ONE OFF no chase]

2. No more than 2-3 variants.  I personally liked the old locations: 5k-2k with 1:10-1:25 odds, 2k-500 with 1:30-1:50 odds, and the 500-10 count rare tier with 1:50-1:1000 odds

Lets see what happened today with the Rebels set.

1. For a set that was supposed to be completed over the weekend, instead they decided to give away the entire stock of inserts BEFORE they gave the award.

2. And if that wasn't enough, what used to be a 400 count master access only variant, was handed out basically for free to everyone as well in the sales pack.  So what was going to be a nice low count sepia award, will now be...wait for it... a 750 count set because of a typo in the original post?  

So to sum up, if you played by the stated rules and chased the set during the weekend it was supposed to be completed.  You LOSE big time, because not only did they cheapen your set, awards, they also decided to give away all the inserts at way less than what you paid to open them.

I will certainly flipping resources, and trading for finished ships.  But this just isn't a very appealing mechanic right now.

Here's the tweaks I would love to see to make this more appealing.

First, rather than 4 variants of the same thing with ridiculously scaling costs, can we not have it be different cards that take different amounts resources?  Space 1: cheap, Tie fighter: somewhat more, Xwing: even more: Falcon: a lot... Star Destroyer (this can cost a ton of resources).  

But...really a pink Slave one requires 1 million credits resources in 24 hours...for a 100+ count card?  I honestly feel bad for the people who built these.  

Which leads to issue #2 Time windows are fine, but time windows with bad pack structure is death.  Pinks in master, blues in blue pack.  Greys in resource.  Different times to build each, and the pink schematic becomes pure trash after a short 24 hour window???  

Easy fix is to do it like the gold 2 chase:  If you build it in 24 hours you get a PINK, 48 hours you get a GREEN, 1 week you get a GREY, after that a WHITE.  Release the entire set of schematics up front, and then everyone can be happy.

So TL:DR:  Make the variants based on time to build from release.  Make each THING cost different amounts.  Worthless schematics suck (and please make it easier to pull schematics in one central place, the master pack perhaps?)

Given that lightsabers are pretty iconic, and well the outcome of the elegant weapons set was pretty mixed given the completion rates.

I think a few things went wrong:

1. Suboptimal structure (2 different regular packs and a 25k uber expensive 1:4000 master only?)  4 variants and demand was pretty much dead on arrival of the set.

2. Lack of variety and differentiation in card art (combined with way too long of a set).  Hopefully the length of the set was related to the fact that the golds were not getting pulled fast enough, otherwise I have to question why we had 2-3 copies of the same lightsaber with a button moved around).  

My suggestions for the next saber set:

If you want an elite set AND make it popular, this is what I would love, combining low variants and overall card count that makes sets valuable (reflection/prisms).

Set length of 5-10

- Common Variant: 2500 count - black/white version, BIG HILT with BLADE, think mechanical saber but even more zoomed in on the hilt.

- Rare Variant: 25 count - COLOR version, so you have red/green/blue/purple, these would have made me want to keep my goldens if they were more interesting and unique

- 5k SINGLE saber pack 1:50 b/w odds (still high like before, but these will be worth more) (1:5000 color odds) so both will sell out roughly the same time.  I don't think its actually all that important to put a high odd set like this behind master access since anyone who's going for the 5000 packs almost certainly is buying master pack access... this would just make the rare variant actually get pulled, but not a big difference either way

Widevision: Funeral Pyre + Vader Butt [This would have been fine if Vader Butt was Wk 11 and the award was funeral pyre... We'd all be like WOW BEST AWARD ever. instead...MEGA DUD].  Runner up: Power of the Jedi could have been a sweet award too

TC: Tano + Vos [I think Tano should have been the reward, the award NEEDS to be better than the other cards in the set to validate the worth of the chase IMO]

Bounty: Zuckuss + Eval?  This set is entirely random to me, I don't know who anyone is, so I wish the award was someone I knew :)

Connection: Leia/Han + ?? [The format of these cards is fixed and their hands are tied, There hasn't been a yoda connection yet, so if its not the wave 3 award, maybe we get it for our wave 2 award)

GM: Heir + ?? [I really hope its better than Super Star wars!]

I think that its ok if the set drags on...But I'd much rather extra time be taken to get the award right than to give us a mediocre reward.  It really cheapens the chase if the payoff is not satisfying...  My heuristic would be the BEST card is the award, with the second best card being first in set.

I might just be a little biased though since I finally got a yellow jango yesterday, promptly blew thru all of my 125k credits to wiff...  Spent 5 minutes grinding tapjoy to luck sack it on the very next pack :)  Cracked a second yellow jango with the count at 2.1k at like 1 am, and stayed up til 3 am for the big 50k weekly bonus and pulled it in 6 packs.  Safe to say I've spent my pack luck for the week :)",starwarstrader,Reflections is by far my favorite set and the mechanic is awesome,http://www.reddit.com/r/starwarstrader/comments/3eeh44/reflections_is_by_far_my_favorite_set_and_the/

1. I really wish variants were grouped together instead of scattered within a set in our collection.  Its just so much better visually to see them all clustered.  I totally understand why some players dump all the other variants just to keep their collection clean.

2. Related to this, I wish the rarest variant got super special treatment, similar to hearthstone golden level flair instead of just a different color (which isn't even always the coolest looking one!)

I know blizzard has a team of artists which maybe SWT doesn't yet have the resources for, but I am pretty sure if the master access variants looked WAYYY cooler instead of just being rarer, that would kick the demand and spending into overdrive which is good for everyone, and maybe even get us back to a happy place of just regular and foil variants for every card (my dream)

I think the feature everyone really wants now that our collections are ginormous and only growing over time is the opposite.  Here are all the cards I want to trade, and that should be the default view when you trade to start (Filter by tradeable)  This probably requires a bit of work on the backend for them, but this by far would make trading so much better.  As everyone can now easily distinguish between (no this is my set I'm collecting, and here feel free to offer on this complete set I'm trading).  You can always still do the 1:1 and ask for someone to make things tradeable, so think of this as making locks infinite (with a view of unlocked cards only)",starwarstrader,[FeatureRequest] Notion of Tradeable count replacing locks entirely,http://www.reddit.com/r/starwarstrader/comments/3bnznh/featurerequest_notion_of_tradeable_count/

How do I know this?  Because I couldn't bring myself to trade my black maul so I let the other guy get it for this (which I think is a pretty good price assuming you can let go of a black maul with no regrets).

I made a slightly stronger offer with black maul, full red nb, and white nb, but I cancelled it and replaced it with han + obi + red nb which I thought was worth more...  But he really wanted black maul (I don't blame him I couldn't trade mine)...  So I dropped out
