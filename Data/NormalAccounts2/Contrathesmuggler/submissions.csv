I am new to breeding and I just want to make sure I'm doing this right.  I have 2 Mawile's, one has perfect IVs in Attack, Sp Atk, Sp Def, and Speed. The other has perfect in HP, Attack, Sp. Atk, and Sp. Def. (Holding Destiny Knot).  I've gone through a ton of eggs and haven't gotten one with 5 perfect IVs. Obv I know I will need to find another Mawile w/ pefect Defense and breed w/ it later.  I'm just wondering if I'm doing this correctly, or if there's a more streamlined way I can be going about this.
