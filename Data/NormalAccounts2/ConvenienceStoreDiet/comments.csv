4,"Yeah, that's not a conspiracy theory. It's true. Most news is there to get your attention. Your Facebook wall is covered with articles from places that seem like news/journalism sites, but are entertainment and clickbait articles. Local news in a major city would make you think you're living in a war zone... but it keeps you tuned in. Broadcast cable news used to be more interested in reporting just facts. Now, it's a lot of analysts and talking heads talking over each other. The more brash the personality, the better. For example: Donald Trump.

Donald Trump had more media coverage in the primaries than any of the other candidates. He was able to get as far as he did by being outrageous and saying outrageous things and the media ate it up. We all know about the wall, grabbing by the pussy, ""extreme vetting"" of Muslims. We know about him being an ""outsider"" who wants to take down ""crooked Hilary"" and how he ""tells it like it is."" That he's a businessman who made billions and gets things done and will likely fall victim to the rigged election. And in all of those talking points and distractions, why don't the conversations flood around the serious concern that we might enter a war in Syria, how we plan on handling the aggressive climate change tactics we currently need, NSA spying, scrutiny of his economic plan for the debt, and why isn't the conversation about how we can all come together? Because battles are interesting to watch. 

Scientific studies. A new one comes out with promising news. A new fad diet based on one study. Scientists say... this happens all the time, and people use these studies to strengthen their predispositions, regardless of the study's need for more scrutiny. One study a few decades ago linked autism to vaccines. It was disproven and now the debate is still being covered for its controversy. So much that people start to give credibility to the other side. Business men and politicians ignore actual scientific data to propel their economic interests on-air about climate change. It's not a debate, it's a scientific fact. But by having the ""debate,"" they're not looking at the solutions. They're analyzing the problem. And we're watching the battle. We're watching really shitty versions of gladiator battles, starring loud people in pretty suits.

The importance of media is to protect the public from the misinformation of politicians, so that the nation's leaders cannot become an oligarchy. And a good number of them are. But what ends up in front of our eyes isn't what we need. It's what we want, and that's not always good. And it usually ends in the term ""gate"" for some reason.",2016-10-22 18:30:41+00:00,d93acef,2.0,t1_d92zsqx,18138,AskReddit
5,"Not everyone is built to understand each other immediately. There are those fallacies of believing everyone experiences the world similarly to how we experience it. So it becomes difficult when you meet someone who doesn't enjoy it the same way you do. For an extroverted person, they may wish to include others to fuel their energy. And when you say ""no"" to that as an introvert, you are rejecting that inclusion. For them, it can be about trying to include through questioning, or to ultimately exclude for not accepting the offer to be included. Introverts want to not be overwhelmed. So with so much energy being tossed at them, it's hard to really navigate. Conversation can feel like confrontation or obstacles. And even they can get like, ""well why don't you just let me do my thing and leave me alone.""

Both sides scream, ""why don't you get me!"" Until they realize, ""you don't have to get me and that's okay."" It just takes time and life experience to understand people.

Best we can do is try to help each other and appreciate each other.",2016-10-15 18:11:28+00:00,d8tb27o,5.0,t1_d8t9gap,2471,AskReddit

I want to see the interesting arts, landmarks, overlooks, parks, oddities. But some friends just want to sit at any cafe and ""absorb the culture."" Some have to see EVERYTHING and check it off the list. And you don't always get to experience things at the pace you desire if you just follow that.

9,"Promotions often involve leadership roles. Some can add more difficult tasks with higher compensation, but often a step up means more interactions. You don't just perform task X, but you lead a larger group to achieve goal Y. That often comes with being less hands-on, more focused on organization, and being very adept at social interaction. 

It's not a great call to hire incompetent people, smooth talkers, narcissists who can hype themselves up, etc. But you want someone who can keep morale up, get workers excited to work for you, stay focused on larger goals, be trustworthy, and resolve social issues efficiently. And who better to do that then someone you know personally, who has an emotional stake in the success of your business/project because they have an emotional stake in the boss.

20,"Not necessarily. A lot of my ambitionless friends are some of the most creative people I know. But they don't want to do anything with that talent, unfortunately.

For me personally, I try to surround myself with people who have the same work/entertainment goals/life goals. I try to be around people who inspire me with their epic feats. If I spent all my time around people who were not ambitious, I would find myself taking on their personalities. I wouldn't be fulfilled where I want to find meaning. I'd be bored without the shop talk or the creative projects. So personally I spend time with them very moderately. I also personally prefer to date someone with ambition. I'm a busy guy myself, so being in a relationship with someone who is also busy is a great thing. We don't rely on each other for interesting things. We just have boatloads to talk about by the end of the day.

You really end up finding your friends through the shit you're ambitious about, and if you don't have those things, I find it's harder to just meet people.",2016-09-10 22:07:41+00:00,d7hg5es,3.0,t1_d7hf447,1642,AskReddit
21,"No ambition? Everyone has some ambition. What gets you excited in life? What thing do you want to complete or build? It doesn't have to relate to a career. I'm ambitious with my career. I'm not the best at actually achieving my goals, but I try and put my efforts toward that.

Other people don't want to make their ambitions their careers. For some, it's about living a balanced life. Or living in nature peacefully. For others, it's travel. Or being a good parent. Or hosting great dinner parties. Or having sex with a lot of men/women. Some find it in their hobbies or their relationships. Or in volunteering. Or in having a great nightlife.

It's not wrong to have no ambition. But speaking from someone who has experienced both, there's a lot of fun in exploring new things and trying to see if you find that ambition in something new.

27,"I always feel like I'm growing up. I'm a lot smarter than I was when I was a teenager. And every five years, I think my perspective changes greatly. From my experience, around like 25-30, you pretty much start to understand the vast majority of how humanity operates and you get it.

I think with life, you gain purpose. In your teens/20's, it's about discovering the world around you and finding your place in it. So your outlook changes with more information. You start to gain standards. ""Yay, Taco Bell!"" ""I'm not eating that crap."" ""Only the finest tempeh avocado sandwich triangles for me."" It's like learning music. You think pop songs are the greatest. Then you learn piano and you realize that D, A, C, D, A, C really has nothing on the complexity of Beethoven, which you can now appreciate. Your tastes change. Fart jokes are hilarious. Then, you realize the beauty of a well-crafted emotional drama, and those fart jokes you realize are cheap laughs and don't hold the same joy. Or maybe they do and hold a different one.

One day you travel to a new place. And you meet people from other countries. You hang out with people of different cultures and you learn how big this world truly is. You learn how to communicate with others who can't understand you. You respect those who came before you. You discover the world is so much bigger than you ever could imagine.

Maybe you get in some relationships. Back in my 20's, relationships were an ideal attainment. I'd meet the perfect woman and we'd live happily ever after. She'd have all the perfect qualities, and it'd be like heaven on earth with my princess. Then you realize what they are. They're just two people with interests and insecurities hanging out and being best friends. Some you wanted to stay go away, you break some hearts, you meet a lot of average people. Maybe you fall in love and that has to stop for some reason. Over time, you may discover that you're not looking for prince charming/the princess, but a down to earth real person. One who's not obsessed with looks, flaunting, materials, will reject you for not liking Breaking Bad. You'll find someone who wants to understand your heart. And you'll start looking for the same things in others. ""Yay, booze and sex"" turns to, ""yay quiet dinner date with someone who's into palm tree reforestation."" And that will be fulfilling.

Eventually you fall in love and start a family. And your family gives you a very different purpose. You're not just there for your own selfish reasons. You have others to look out for, whether they're spouses, pets, kids, adopted kids, aging parents/grandparents, neighbors. And if you have kids, you experience what you experienced through them again. It seems so distant, but you'll learn what your parents had to go through. And you'll do anything for your kids.

Eventually you get old. Being the best at work isn't important, but leaving the world a better place is. Your kids grow up, move out, and you have to reconnect with your spouse. Your friends die around you. You have to understand your impending mortality. But you learn to enjoy every day as much as you can.

Do you ever feel like you grow up though? Not really. There's always room to grow. There's no ceiling you reach. There are many moments when you realize you're an adult. When you live on your own. When a parent/grandparent dies. When a sibling has a kid. When you get a job. When you pay bills. When you move in with someone. When you have a kid. When you buy your first car. When you graduate college. Shit like that. But you just feel like you. ",2016-09-10 20:21:56+00:00,d7hc4o8,2.0,t1_d7h8r20,5048,AskReddit

Now go do great things and be kind to everyone you can.",2016-09-10 20:03:54+00:00,d7hbf58,2.0,t1_d7h8kso,4228,AskReddit
29,"To quote the great Ben Kenobi, it's all true... ""from a certain point of view.""

The economy is great! It has seen strong growth since the recession. The Dow Jones is up, stocks are up, job growth is up, investors are making money, it's going great!

The economy is terrible! The wealth divide is deplorable and only growing. Jobs are being shipped overseas. Businesses are leaving the country to avoid taxes. China is overtaking the US as the economic powerhouse of the world. We're not making strong enough strides to become energy independent. It's all going sour!

Arguments can be made for anything, and television/clickbait journalism is great at keeping you wound up in the arguments. The challenge of finding a good representative is finding someone who doesn't just argue one point of view. They look at as many points of view as they can and come up with a course of action to move forward on improving the human condition. It's easy to rally people around a cohesive purpose. ""The rich are the enemies for stealing money from the middle class."" ""The poor are the welfare leeches pulling the economy down."" It's easy to rally behind that regardless of their validity because you rally people behind an enemy, not a solution. ""Looking at our budget, we can improve assistance program efficacy if we raise taxes on these income brackets and cut back spending on obsolete programs A, B, and C. While that may not create some idealogical answer, it allows a utilitarian approach to come up with a compromise that....zzzzzzzzz."" Boring, too many facts! Not enough to get incensed about. How does this affect me again? What 20 seconds can I lift from that to show on the news/facebook? What's discretionary spending? That stuff requires more investment and effort from everyone to keep up with. And it's a lot. We can't do our jobs in society AND keep up with thousands of other full-time happenings in the world AND make time for ourselves. We rely on politicians/news to parse down information, and they're not great at making it interesting. Same reason you don't go partying with your accountant.

51,"Actor here, of much lesser note and prowess. I've always greatly respected Matt Damon as a person and actor. I'm very thankful he was able to do an AMA and share so much of his insight. And I respect his opinion with his first piece of advice. However, I unfortunately have to disagree, or at least add something to help.

I didn't discover acting until my 20's. I was uncomfortably shy, had taken some classes in high school and college that weren't very good, and this thing in my head just kept saying, ""give it another go."" I put it out there to a friend who, rather than saying, ""don't do it, it's a terrible idea"" said, ""take class here and see if you like it."" So I did. And I discovered what none of the other acting teachers taught me: technique. And I fell in love with it. It opened me up as a human being. It improved my social skills. And more importantly, I found my artistic calling. I have been pursuing it since. Had my friend told me anything different, I might not have been open to discovering it.

I understand Matt's advice and how it teaches a lesson in perseverance. I think until you hit a point in your maturity where you can understand that what he's saying is noise to be ignored, you may not be able to process what he's saying. Yes, it is a cognitively terrible idea to gamble so heavily on an artistic pursuit such as acting. But if you love it and have that passion and need to do it, there is no other choice in life. It's that simple. You make it work somehow.

People come to me all the time looking to get into acting. And like an old-timey gas station attendant, I just say, ""Oh, you want to get into acting? The road is that a-way. It's a treacherous journey indeed. Make sure you have plenty of gas. Good luck, traveler!"" The pursuit itself tends to weed people out and give them the answers they were looking for, or they act at the level they're meant to. Even if I'm going to tell people it's a hard life, I'd at least like to show them where the road is if they decide not to care about how hard it is.

And yes, just do the work. No matter where you are or what you're pursuing in life. Just do the work. Always.",2016-07-20 14:31:43+00:00,d5jknhd,3.0,t1_d5iryfs,57915,IAmA

You gain a greater view of the world that shows you how minuscule your existence truly is in this world. The pale blue dot. The ant on an anthill. And from afar, no one cares. Billions of people have no clue who you are and will put no effort whatsoever toward what you do in life.

It's gotta be a mindfuck for celebrities. You could have been the most talked about person in the world twenty years ago. Debbie Gibson. Monica Lewinsky. Then people just stop recognizing you entirely.

If anything, it's kind of trippy to think that also someone actually does care. You'll have a handful of people in this world who do think about you. They're probably shitty about expressing it, but they love you and want the best for you. And though they may never be the ones you want to love you, they will. And at some point, you start to or continue to acknowledge them as family. And when you come to this truth, you realize that the world isn't sad because nobody cares.

If you think about it, those celebrities are selling you on their exceptionalism, whether it's via their looks, acting, singing, whatever. So the ones who do it at the highest level have the most desire to make themselves look exceptional and protect their brand image. It's visual autotuning.

I will say this: celebrities look very pretty in person, and while most look pretty average, the pretty ones stand out. But we all age, get acne, cut ourselves shaving, run into a table with our legs, miss a couple of days at the gym, etc. And that stuff isn't flattering. Neither is the camera with bad light.

That last day, they were given a choice: die by the kool-aid, or die by these armed guards. Jones panicked once he killed the congressman and knew it was all over. And the people there didn't all just jump up and drink the kool-aid. They dissented, but ultimately were left with no options. Die, or die. 

I think the documentary helps dispel that idea that they were a bunch of cultists who just followed a crazy person to the grave. It shows that they were mass murdered. Had they known it would end that way, they probably would have left. And many tried to, but couldn't.

She tells you that she feels stifled being around you and that you inhibit her freedom, even if you don't. She starts hanging around other friends and purposely doesn't invite you. You feel like you're on edge with every action you take and feel like you're being constantly judged. You sit in your car every night listening to Pink Floyd's The Wall (because it's the only album that didn't get erased on your iPhone when you botched a backup) before going into your place of cohabitation and dealing with her wrath.

78,"Maybe he wanted to see the other guy's ""magic wand."" 

Or maybe he was having an existential crisis in which he felt invisible to the whole of society. He discovered how meaningless his existence as a caddy at a local country club had become. He discovered that all whose clubs he carried would forget him. His legacy would be a reminder to no one of what happens to a life not lived. So, he spent his Saturday hopping from thrift store to thrift store to costume shop to retailer in small towns over 300 miles away. He carried no phones and only paid in cash, never to be detected. He tirelessly gave up his Thursday nights following that to inventing an identity. ""The Panda. No... The Bumble Bee! No... I got it!"" Thus was born ""The Thieving Magician."" He would rob people of their riches and dignity, leaving nothing but a trail of glittery smoke and mirrors behind him. He trained with the best. Liam Neeson. Houdini's corpse. Some dude on Youtube who shows you how to do magic tricks. After years of innocent people robbed and massive amounts of wealth gained, he still couldn't fill the hole inside him. ""Maybe if I look better, I'll feel better about myself."" One day he played an awful trick on a man who loved video games. He offered to show him the Secret of Mana. He magically made the man's pants disappear conveniently into the magician's backpack. And yes, he did reveal the man's most magical possession. It was that fateful day where, after passing two other victims, the man met Lana, a woman who reacted not with horror to his exposed penis, but with kindness and compassion. She offered him her shawl and covered him up. Seeing how he had no wallet or keys, she drove him home. He thanked her. He looked her in the eye and, for unexpected reasons, couldn't break his gaze. She saw that her shawl, still around the man's waist, moved ever so slightly. Flattered, she blushed and returned the same look. It didn't take long for their passions to ignite his junior studio apartment. Months later, the two became happily married in the park where they met. At the wedding reception, the man heard a voice. It was familiar with a sarcastic... no, it couldn't be! It was the magician! He also was a wedding DJ! The man stormed to the DJ booth and, with a fire in his eyes as hot as the sun, he looked through the magician's eyes and into the depths of his soul. ""Do you remember me?"" ""I don't."" ""Well, I remember you, oh great magician!"" The magician shrunk into himself. A bead of sweat rested along his eyebrow as he prepared his defenses. ""And I wanted to say... thank you."" ""Thank me?""""Four months ago, I saw you in a park on my way to a blind date. You played a trick on me and stole my pants. Embarrassed, I could not go on my date and tried to exit the park. There, I met the love of my life. And by exposing my penis, you exposed my heart to someone wonderful. I will always remember you."" The magician, welling up, took his pants off and returned them to the man. ""I believe these belong to you."" But the room was full of old people and children. It didn't take long for confused uncle Skippy to call the cops. The magician was arrested. And though he no longer had the riches he once had, nor did he have the freedom to pursue his life, he discovered that he had one thing: purpose. That and a jail cell with Jared from Subway. Okay, he had two things. But now that he fulfilled his mission in life, he was at peace. It made his death in jail via toothbrush shank just a little less painful.

Say I'm on my new computer and I haven't synched my device yet. Now I have to erase everything on there to synch it, then put my videos/songs on, meaning I could lose a bunch of shit on there. And I've been at points where the new version of iTunes won't install on my old computer, so I have to use my new one and go through this process.

83,"They can't legally fix them. So while it's mostly glossed and edited to build fake tension or make you think one person is going home, the outcomes can't legally be fixed if there are monetary stakes involved. Meaning Trump couldn't specifically make Meatloaf and Gary Busey's challenges easier to keep them on the show longer. You can lead the contestants to say stuff and use those sound bytes perfectly to make it sound like they are worried about going home. But when it comes to the games themselves, they can't fix the outcomes.

So there were something called the Quiz Show Scandals in the 50's. Producers would coach contestants or favor of contestants they wanted to win. Soon the FCC found out and noped the fuck out of that. The FCC made into law that game shows could not fix the games. My guess is that they legally can't fix reality competition shows like Bachelor either. There was that thing a few years ago where a Bachelor contestant may or may not have been friends/more than friends with a producer, which was not disclosed. So, they canned her off the show immediately rather than risk any liability if someone thought the outcome was fixed. So they can't stuff the boxes in Survivor, nor can they give advantages to their favorite Amazing Racers.

84,"I'll give my experiences as I've worked in the field and have been a contestant on two gameshows.

**The Price is Right:** You gotta wake your ass up early to get in line and guarantee your spot in the audience. Or, you're going to show up when your tickets tell you to and wait in line for a really long time in the hopes that you're one of the first 400 people to show up, or how ever many the studio seats. I barely made it in. It's possible to have tickets and not make it in. Mostly I think that's because people bail all the time, so they need to make sure they have a full audience.

Before you go in, the casting people bring you in in large groups and briefly ask you questions about yourself to see if you're going to be fun on camera without putting it on. Me being a general weirdo/performer, I had that in the bag.

When you get called up, you can barely hear your name in the audience because everyone is screaming. My friends had to throw me up because I didn't hear my own name. Some people genuinely lose their shit. The woman who went up after me won a car. She didn't even remember doing it. Afterwards, you go to some area back stage or an office and you fill out paperwork. 3-6 months later, they send you everything you won from the various vendors. You can even opt not to accept those things if you don't want them. It's not like you walk out of the studio with all that stuff.

And the wheel is heavy.

**Wheel of Fortune:** When you're a contestant, you get picked via that wheel watcher bus or through online submissions. Then they bring like 200 of you to a giant hotel conference room to give you a written test and play some practice games in front of them. They want to make sure you can scream your answers and know how to play the game. 

When you do get picked, you show up at 7am and hang out back stage. And everyone there is pretty fuckin' cool. Even Vanna came to say hi and hang for a hot minute. They tour you through the stage, and eventually you just wait back stage for your episode to come up. They tape six in a day. When you're up there, Pat is cool as fuck. He's a really cool dude and knows everyone's nervous. He makes the effort to assuage everyone's nerves. Then when you're done, you go to some office and realize how much or how little you won.

And the wheel is heavy as fuck.

And on both shows, the announcers do crowd work to keep everyone interested during the pauses for commercial breaks. They also tape in a manner called ""live to tape,"" meaning they record it as if it were being broadcast live. Talk shows do this as well. It keeps the production moving more precisely.

And I've worked on reality shows. This tidbit that you won't unsee. Say you see a segment on a home design show like Property Brothers or something like that where someone answers a door. Then someone's like, ""surprise, you got picked!"" Yeah, that's often not the case. That person knows to answer the door at that time. It's not really a surprise greeting. Crew is already there. How you usually know is that there's already a camera inside covering everything from another angle, and they started setting up 15-30 minutes before that shot.

100,"Okay, no worries: ) You don't have to care about the point of view.

You being clear about not caring would be you not responding to anything in this forum, or typing specifically: do not respond to my line of messaging with vegan suggestions. That really makes it clear that you do not wish to engage in this discussion. From the looks of everything before, you're stating a point of view and people are typing counter to your point of view, challenging it with their information and experiences. And you're returning the same discussion with your point of view and experiences as well. You seemed to be received and understood and heard. Reading back, only when it came to me that I challenged the idea of meat being essential to an inexpensive workout routine did you seem to throw down a strong, negative reaction to the conversation. Not one based off of talking points, information, or debate/discussion, but of a seemingly emotional reaction and a direct attack toward my character.

You're engaging in conversation on a hub of information sharing, with other people reading our seemingly private communication. Some may agree with you, some may find my messages interesting, some may find yours. Some may learn. Some people are looking at me like the ""preachy vegan."" Some are just looking at me like another dude who posted a cool link. We're all subject to the same [cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases), [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) being a huge motivating factor with most people. And that may influence how others see our points of view. Okay, cool. 

Again, I don't have to be right in this conversation. I don't win or get anything if your point of view changes or holds with our conversation. Our communication will probably end in like 1 more exchange when we both get bored of this and realize it's getting circular, likely with you getting the last words, and two weeks from this moment we'll never have thought twice about this exchange for the rest of our lives. And so goes life.

By your definition of me saying ""hey, I checked out this post of a guy who built muscle being vegan and I liked it"" is of course me saying I think it's a better way of doing things. Much like me saying I watch Walking Dead is my way of saying what I watch is a better way of watching TV, or me wearing a t-shirt that says Pink Floyd is me saying that listening to the bands I like is a better way of listening to great music, or me posting a Carl Sagan quote is me saying what I get inspired by is a better way of being inspired by life. That's kind of how exchanges go, from one point of view. Had I posted, ""yeah eating grilled chicken builds protein too"" would be me saying, ""I think you should agree with ba1018 because his way of eating is a better way of doing things."" Would you be so negative to respond to my suggestion then? Would you have responded with, ""Stop being a preachy carnivore and soliciting your point of view? I'm not going to change because this is who I am and your agreeing with me does nothing? I didn't ask for this."" Or would you have agreed with me and felt relief that you weren't the only one feeling so attacked or solicited to?",2016-03-27 15:52:35+00:00,d1fb4mo,10.0,t1_d1dwv4x,124852,comics
101,"Did this last year when the weather was tolerable. Fully agree! It sounds like it was cooler for everyone pre-9/11. Now it's just standing in line for really bad GA to a pop show.

So we had to show up at 1:30pm to get into the area. Waited around for a few hours and went through at least three or four security checkpoints. I couldn't bring in water or anything. No drinking if you wanted to. The ball looked quite distant and there was a distinct possibility that a bad angle meant I couldn't even watch that drop. We're packed like sardines. No porta potties. No cafe to hang in. Nothing. While in line, the performers all did their soundchecks, meaning we all heard the same concert twice.

We finally made it to about 45th street by the end of it, and moving off to the side meant losing that prime real estate to see the ball drop. Meaning I was standing in the same place for hours. Everyone around me wasn't too talkative, so your group means everything. And my friends and I couldn't hold a 12-hour straight conversation. But at least we'd get to see the show on some big screens in Times Square and essentially marathon the show, right?

The thing they don't tell you is that the party is for the people at home, not you in Times Square. You're an extra in a big TV show. The big screens and sound systems aren't there to entertain you in the crowd. They're there to show advertisements. Sometimes one of the smaller screens would show a performance, but usually not. You couldn't even see the stages anyway. One wasn't faced toward the crowd, but toward the building faces, meaning only a handful of people got to see one stage. The other was so far away that you couldn't really make anything out. Oh, and Planet Fitness thought it'd be cool to give everyone in the crowd 1-ft foam hats and 2-ft balloons with streamers, meaning someone was tickling your face in a not-fun way for four hours while you lost most of your field of vision. The last hour, I just kept hoping the dude in front of me wouldn't move his head.

When the ball dropped, holy shit was that magical! Those 15 minutes after are really really cool! It's a big party in New York where people aren't shitty to each other. It's one of my favorite things ever to see. 

Then immediately reality set in and we got the hell out of there. By the time I got back to the apartment, I realized what it was like to not stand for ~11 hours straight. Lots of pain.

TL;DR: 11 hours for an okay pop show, it's made to look cool on TV, not to entertain you in the pen.",2016-03-27 15:00:37+00:00,d1f9iev,1.0,t3_4c58db,13824,AskReddit

106,"Took me a while to understand this one. So I make entertainment for a living and couldn't understand why people weren't watching ""The Walking Dead,"" ""Breaking Bad,"" and all these other high-stakes dramas or thought-provoking comedies more often. A couple of main things going on.

1: It makes people feel better about themselves to watch people they perceive themselves to be smarter than. A lot of entertainment is watching perceived idiots fail until they succeed or learn their lesson. Arrested Development. Even Shakespeare wrote comedies like this (Twelfth Night, OMG HE is a SHE?).

2: Doctors. Imagine you pull a 16-hour shift where you lost two patients. You come home and need a break from life. Are you interested in watching Carol to ask someone to look at the flowers or Schindler's List? Or would you rather veg out to some idiot Kardashian sisters waxing each other's vaginas in the kitchen? What will help you wind down easier when you need the escape?

3: Emotions. Emotionally available people put themselves out there all the time and we, as humans, connect to living things that connect to their emotions. The dog wants to go for a walk. The cat wants to play. We're all about it! Babies, kittens, they mostly live by their senses and emotions, and we can't take our eyes off of them. Many of us don't emotionally connect to everything. We'd be stunted in our days if we cried every time we ate a delicious meal or screamed at the top of our lungs when the wifi stopped working, then laughed hysterically at ourselves for being so angry about it all. Can't do that at the office. Some things we learn to take for granted in order to not live in a hyper-present. You can't tune into and be pulled in by everyone's emotions in a large crowd, after all. But emotionally available people are more connected to their present. Emotions tell a story, which are fascinating to watch and necessary, but sometimes exhausting to live. Great actors deeply connect to theirs over grave circumstances and we call that high art. Kardashians connect to the problems of unwaxed vaginas in a kitchen and we call that just another wacky Wednesday. They're like watching puppies or kittens.

4: No effort. It really takes no effort to watch Kardashians wax each other's vaginas in a kitchen. I had trouble falling asleep after watching an emotionally disturbing episode of The Walking Dead not too long ago. I sleep like a baby to almost anything reality. No effort/investment needed. This goes back to the point about doctors.

109,"Bad relationships are built around these constant expectations of the other person. Often you'll meet a lot of girls out there who expect the man to do these tasks (because chivalry isn't dead!), have these ambitions (he has to be good enough for me, I'm not dating a plumber unless he's Super Mario), put in these efforts (because he has to earn my affection), be the ear to all her problems (which you can't resolve or laugh off, you just have to emotionally take on those feelings to show you care). And you're judged if you don't do these tasks. And that gets exhausting and it never resolves the bottom line of the problem: you will never meet her expectations. Ever. They will constantly grow and consume you until you are nothing, reducing you to someone she would never date. She'll say her expectations are low, but they aren't. They have to be maintained and they'll grow. At a certain point, you'll run out of new hikes, restaurants, concerts, events, etc. to take her, or you'll run out of money. That relationship built on customer service can't sustain itself, and she'll go from your PS2 model right up to a PS4. Because you're not a boyfriend. You're a commodity.

Hopefully, you get to the point where you get past that or meet someone who is past that.

Good relationships you don't have to worry about their expectations. You just are yourself and you want to do good things for the other person. You want to be better, mostly for yourself but also because you think of her and she inspires you to be a better person. You put in efforts because you want the other person to be happier, not because they need you to make them happy. Your time with them can't be evaluated with a grade letter and a performance review. Your time together is only honored, and the good things are relished.

Or, judged me as incompetent and not a provider, then told her friends about this awful date she was on. I was in for one of those nights, right? Well, nope! She was cool the entire time, we laughed it off together, she kept herself busy while I looked for a way out, and we even had a pleasant conversation the entire ride home, and we'll see each other again.

This advice here is solid, and I hope you can be kind to yourself and surround yourself with loved ones in this time, whether that's family or friends or even some kind strangers on reddit. It's okay to feel how you feel, as out-of-place as the feelings may feel, and as impossible as it is to see right now you will move on from all of this a stronger person. A part of you didn't go with him. He gave you the gift of showing you kindness, connection, and happiness. You now know what all of that is, he gave you that. Rather, he showed you that you are worthy to receive it from this world, and I hope you do remain open to the kind of love and kindness that he showed you. So many people right now want to show you kindness, sympathy, and love. They may not know how, you may not know how to process it, they might just feel like words. But every little bit will help over time, and with time you'll learn how to accept it more and more.

There wasn't anything you could have done different in life to have changed anything. You loved each other and enjoyed your time together. That was the time you had, and that's okay. Some day in the future you'll look back with fondness for the good times you shared. For now, the times will be tough and I hope that you can be well for yourself, so that you can cherish the gift of the time you had together and carry those good feelings he gave you. Grieve as you need to. Write all you need to, call those friends up who will listen and be there for you. Spend the time with your family and know that a lot of people love you and will be and want to be there for you.

120,"So, as a creative type, it's great! 

If I feel like playing loud music and working on a comic or a script until 3am, I'm going to do that. 

Late night voice over or on-camera audition show up? No one will give a shit about me being up screaming my lungs out until 3am (VO booth keeps the neighbors from hearing things, but it's like having a loud TV on in the apartment so the roomies/SO's would mind).

Do I want to play guitar or video games until the sun comes up? Yep. Is anyone there to judge me or tell me to stop so they can sleep? Nope!

Can I spend one night making a 5-star meal, then the next 8 nights eating tacos made of cereal? Yep! Oh, and garlic on whatever I want!

Early morning call time to work? Do I have to worry about waking up anyone in the house when I need to get my day started? Nope!

Taking home a date? The best! No awkward moments where you have to interact with roommates or your wife. You can be loud during sex and not feel like you have to tone it down out of courtesy.

Showering! I take FOREVER in the shower. Once I'm in there, I start coming up with ideas, or I end up just zoning out like I'm in a hot tub. Either way, I don't have to rush through a shower for someone else. I should get better about it for water conservation, though.

Talking to myself or being weird is the best part! I don't have to censor my inner monologue for anyone!

Cleanliness. I'm fairly clean but not the cleanest. And living with someone who isn't clean can quickly turn a place into a dump. Or, living with a neat freak makes you on edge if a piece of mail is left on a table.

But most importantly, I have a place to disappear to when I need it. I grew up sharing rooms for most of my life, or sharing spaces. Some days would come where I felt really down and needed to not be around people, or not have people come up to me and ask me what's wrong.

125,"Broadcast journalism's commodity is attention and they sell that to advertisers. For us who work 12-16 hours a day, I don't really have the extra 2-3 hours that others do to keep up with everything that's going on. I try. I fail. If I turn on Fox News and even CNN at times, I'm expecting the news to be catered to grasping my attention by appealing to my emotional desires of watching pretty girls and people fighting. That's pretty much why every reporter on Fox News is a 10 and everyone is yelling. That's the presentation. 

I consume the parsed-down version because I have no time to cull through thousands of reports, footage, books, narratives, to understand all of what's going on. I can't really expect to understand the ever-changing complexities of finance, trade, international relations, domestic events, law, etc. by the moment. I try hard. I fail even harder. 

That's why I rely on reporters to report back the information second hand, and hopefully have it parsed down to something digestible with context via radio, online news, or even sometimes John Oliver, who as much as he says he isn't a journalist is doing a journalist's job. I personally have resorted to NPR as my news source. It's the one resource not telling stories for for profit. It's boring as fuck and lacks Katy Perry boobs, but it's awesome.

So your information is what I need and should have, the deep journalism that helps me, someone who cannot have regular access to information because of time/financial limitations or other life obligations. Understanding why the Trans Pacific Partnership, Arab Spring, CISPA/SOPA, the climate change summit, the complexities of middle eastern politics, local news, local government, etc. Journalists are finding the information and publishing it. And there is a lot of great journalism out there. It's meant how to inform me how to vote, shape local government, and take charitable actions.

But what's easy to find? Well, my Facebook trending thinks I should check out Justin Bieber's new purple hair. What does the broadcast news here wish to show me? Things I innately give a shit about: food, sex, and my family. What do they show on screen: cooking segments, Katy Perry nip slips, and stories about how I should constantly fear ISL. Broadcasters are catering to what I innately would give a shit about. They're appealing to my desires as opposed to constructing an important narrative for a more well-rounded, informed society. Those with benevolent intentions will find an honest way to make money. Those looking to use their power as a trusted source of information to make a profit will use that system in place to get our attention, which is for sale. At that point, they've blurred the line between News and Entertainment. That means printing the scare-tactic stories and Katy Perry nip slips. And in return, I don't get a trusted news source for information. I get shitty news meant to keep me glued. Why, because I want to see Katy Perry's boobs and am afraid my family is going to get bombed because that's all I see in the news? I can't control that! If all I am is, as a news consumer, a point of sale and can't know what I can't know, and am inundated with terrible news, then my worldview is going to be skewed unless I know how to find better news sources or the media environment changes back to one that's focused on information and not ratings.

And thus I'm stuck being the journalist in whatever free time I have without those 2-3 hours to spare to find answers on shit I should know about, and even trying to find out what are the topics I should know about.

I find it harder to blame millions of uninformed people than the much fewer gatekeepers. I'm reminded of this moment in reporting history here from [Edward R. Murrow: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nN3VBrlmu70](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nN3VBrlmu70)

126,"Worked in pharmaceuticals many years ago. My opinion after the fact is that the employees making the cures for diseases weren't trying to screw the world over. They were trying to save it. They're researching new drugs, discovering new cures with research opening unintended doors.

The PR teams: even little things like those stupid commercials for boner pills made people aware and opened a dialogue about erectile dysfunction. Or heart disease. Or arthritis. Or birth control. The list goes on.

Even with all of that being said, they still suffer from the fact that they are a high-volume-trading company who has to push a product. So that can make you fairly question their ethics:

- Exorbitant CEO salaries/bonuses

- Allergan purchasing Pfizer so they could move overseas and not pay US taxes, while still charging much more to US residents over other countries.

- Pharmaceutical reps who were known for wining/dining doctors to get them to prescribe their company's medication. Business people aren't sworn to the hippocratic oath. Despite a drug going through three phases of clinical trials proving its efficacy, a pharmaceutical company has to convince the population that its drugs are the necessary treatment for a problem, and they've used doctors to help them with that.

- Drug pricing in the USA, which can be insane! Thanks, Martin Shkreli. And yes, I get it, pharmaceuticals have 20 years to earn their profits because Hatch-Waxman imposed patent expiration for generics. But some of those numbers are still to this day insane.

- Advertising drug-based solutions to uninformed patients instead of doctors. Have you ever read through the entirety of a warning label on a prescription your doctor said was ""okay?"" I had a doctor go into his closet and give me an inhaler sampler once because it was there. Anecdotal evidence is shit, so case in point: Zoloft. 

Remember how there was a large dialogue about overprescription of antidepressants? And that people were killing themselves on them? Part of that came from a misunderstanding of depression, easily seen by [this commercial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twhvtzd6gXA) 

Quick links to better understanding depression (a quick chart of the DSM-V and the NIMH's site). [1](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression/index.shtml) [2](http://www.psnpaloalto.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Depression-Diagnostic-Criteria-and-Severity-Rating.pdf) [3](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2011/10/adventures-in-depression.html)

Depression is a tough thing to describe, which is why the DSM V requires you to have like 5 of the 9 or 10 symptoms of it present to make a diagnosis. A lot of those symptoms are physical: loss of energy. Inability to concentrate. One of them is suicidal thoughts. The best way someone described depression to me was that when you're in it, you are immobilized. You may have suicidal thoughts, but you're too despondent to act on them. Going in and coming out of it, you actually have the strength to act on those thoughts. Antidepressants were meant to keep you from going too far down the hole of being immobilized by depression, not be a magical cure-all of sadness. So it kept people from the phase of being immobilized by their depression. Those patients could still find themselves in the zone where they could still act on some of those suicidal thoughts. Zoloft was technically doing its job by treating some of the symptoms, just not all of them. Depression is much more complex than the pain-pill-pleasure model could ever hope to resolve.

And for anyone out there who may think they are suffering from depression, please seek out the advice of a doctor (not me, I just studied this stuff in school/work and by no means am a professional to give advice or treat actual depression) or ask a loved one to help you find the right person to talk to. Google ""depression help"" and find the right number to talk to someone. There is always someone who wants to help you and always hope for a better tomorrow. There's nothing to be ashamed or afraid of. Except maybe spiders with blowtorches. That shit would scare the shit out of my shit.

So from that ad, I'd think that I could possibly cure sadness from my life if I took Zoloft, or even self-diagnose depression. No mention of cognitive behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy in those ads. My diagnosis with my doctor could just require a better diet or exercise or a less-stressful job. Or, it could require a lot more serious attention. The advertisers are trying to get you to buy a drug, not solve your problems. That's why they get you to ask about the product, push the responsibility to the doctors, who by means of our current health care system have more of a systematic incentive to [push you through and prescribe medication as a quicker fix.](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/need-15-minutes-doctors-time/). And I apologize if I'm generalizing doctors. There are so many great ones out there. I am led to believe that the system in place does not necessarily give doctors the flexibility they need to be even better doctors.

In a perfect world, I might be inclined to believe that pharmaceutical companies represent my interests more than theirs, and that my health and well being as a productive citizen of planet Earth was their first priority. And while I believe many people at Astra Zeneca believe in the company's mission statement of ""Making the most meaningful difference to patient health through great medicines,"" they still have to make money. They can't be snake-oil salesmen. Thankfully there are a lot of regulations preventing that. And they're not trying to make you addicted. But still controversies around their drugs like Seroquel will happen and money will be at the root of it.

TL:DR; Pharmaceutical drug makers aren't bad. They're making drugs to save your lives. They're heavily regulated to prevent selling you fake shit or keep you hooked. Still, advertising and profits are involved on these publicly-traded companies and thus they won't be immune from related ills.",2016-01-19 05:42:24+00:00,cz3nf3e,2.0,t1_cz2ygb1,39962,AskReddit

130,"Seconded. We're just people. 

The industry is full of delusional, egotistic, self-aggrandizing lunatics. It's also full of really smart people who are out to make films just like they did when they were kids, and can take the maturity that comes with their art and combine it with the kindness they've learned works best when working with people. And those people are awesome to work with and hope to continue to work with.

It's like with anything, once you get to a certain point, you work with a lot of crazy people. Then, you grow and move past all the people you didn't like, hopefully learn from the ones you respect and did like, open yourself to meeting and work with, find a few brilliant folks, and continue to work with those kind of people in the future to make better art.

Our jobs have a high turnaround, so collaboration becomes about whittling down to a solid group of people. Sure, there are the self-involved dreamers and you have to deal with peoples' crazy personalities. Sometimes you have to make choices about choosing to work with people who are difficult-but-brilliant artists vs people who are great to be around socially. Yeah a lot of us are awkward. And yeah it's long hours and sometimes stressful. But I'd take all this over any industry I've been in because I love doing it.",2015-11-01 16:24:49+00:00,cwki5ks,3.0,t1_cwkfrgp,4723,AskReddit
131,"Apparently I'm not the first person to fall asleep during the deed. But this one I regret. 

It was sophomore year of high school in a life studies class. I sat front row, the overzealous learner that I was. And that day, I was suffering from teenage lethargy. Our teacher introduced the day's guest speaker: a woman who had the horrid misfortune of contracting HIV. She was there to tell the class her life story and what it means to live with his virus. For a half hour, she opened up about her heartbreaking experience. The pills. The financial ruin. The stigma. Her deepest regrets. 

I unfortunately remembered about five minutes of it, as it was the school bell that woke me up. I wiped the drool off of my face and left in shame.

136,"One of the many points of advertising isn't to sell you the product. Priority with consumerism has shifted from a needs-based society to a wants-based society. And the goal is to fulfill those wants, as manufactured as most of them are, with products. It's to sell you an emotion that you tie to a product. Then, if you fall in that emotional group, they have a way in to sell you shit. You may need a durable shovel. But you also have a family who depends on you to get the job done, and brand X can do just that. A lot of it is preying on our emotional fears and insecurities.

Not to say all of that stuff out there sold is bad or good. It's mostly unnecessary, and why we buy it can be irrelevant.

Think of every car brand out there. There is a feeling attached to it. Lamborghini/BMW/Ferrari/Lexus - wealth/status. Jeep/Dodge/Ford - Rugged/American. Honda/Toyota - reliable. VW/Honda/Toyota - young/economical. Electric cars like Prius or Tesla - earth conscious. They're just giant machines that mostly do the same thing with varying differences. All that other stuff is mostly noise. Running is more rugged. Walking is more reliable and economical. Neither of those cost $15,000.

Coffee doesn't really provide comfort outside of routine/social setting. Beer doesn't mean party, it just lowers inhibitions and makes you fat. Smoking is not really a rebellious thing if most people do it in the world. Cigars and champagne don't mean celebration. That's just advertising, too. Drinking an IPA doesn't make you a more sophisticated drinker if you like Budweiser. Having an iPhone 6s doesn't make you more current than someone with an iPhone 6, or out of touch/poor if you have old tech. But advertising sure makes you feel that way by repeating these messages and influencing others to repeat them. And they like being able to define you by the products you consume. ""He's a whiskey and golf kind of guy."" ""She's a wine and cheese lady."" ""She's a minecraft geek, Netflix binger."" ""He likes his man cave with Mountain Dew and Call of Duty."" I'm sure you probably judged these people as if you new them. But you don't. Advertising just encourages you to think you do. 

With dating sites, being on eHarmony doesn't mean you'll find the love of your life or are more likely to on there compared to another site or elsewhere. Because of the advertising, more people with that goal may be more inclined to sign up and you'll meet like-minded people. But it's still not the place to go to find the love of your life. Just like Tinder isn't the place to just hook up, and neither is Ashley Madison as the world discovered. They're just portals to facilitate communication between similar people.

Organic doesn't mean healthier or better for the environment. Everyone in the world would be less trash-filled and eco-friendly if they could self-sustain on their own landplots and compost/grow their own food. GMO isn't necessarily evil. Bacon isn't manly/American. That garbage message started as a way to get people to purchase more overflow from pork production. Diamonds aren't forever. That's a slogan from a company specifically pricing up a non-precious rock (that has far from a permanent lifespan) and making you think that diamonds are the only legitimate way to express your love.

Cable news: watching MSNBC doesn't mean you're smarter. Fox News doesn't make you more American and unbiased. All bullshit. 

That doesn't mean any of those desires are unfounded or that the products don't have their uses. I want to be conscious of the planet, find love, help others, relax, and have passions. But I don't think Dole, Tinder, Facebook, Corona, John Deere, diamonds, and a Prius are necessarily the way just because someone else told me they are.

Even if she was in a great mood and didn't care, I would only hear her criticism every time I hit the brakes too hard or wasn't in the fastest lane. Driving with me became insufferable. I was a hot mess and trying way too hard to be the perfect driver for her. I did so really just to not hear her frustrated nagging. Seemed easier and less painful to beat myself up before she could.

Recently I was in the car with my parents and my father was driving. I realized he was doing the same thing. Years of my mother making small criticisms made him hyper aware of every one of his mistakes and on-edge. Missing an exit would make him furious. Because if he wasn't, my mother would be. And if it wasn't a big deal to her, he still felt that need to criticize himself before she could get to him and make him feel like he was failing her.

So now, I have the option: continue to work on my self-efficacy and self-worth, see the pattern and be better, do yoga, mindfulness, focus on my inner peace, meditate, learn to be present to avoid living in a negative what-if, and improve my overall being so that I don't allow romantic partners to affect my being in a negative way, or date a real doll and avoid the time-consuming hassle of becoming a better person.",2015-09-13 14:32:24+00:00,cv00opq,1.0,t3_3kpqfd,58735,AskReddit
