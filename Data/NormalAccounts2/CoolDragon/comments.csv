5,"On a date where a girl who plays in a goth music band asked me to be at her [last] concert, I had a VERY STRONG urge to get her a marigold flower instead of the usual rose; but could not find one, I walked well over a mile looking for anyone selling marigolds; so I got her a rose instead. Weird because it was Oct 31 and in Mexico the streets are packed with people selling marigold for the 'Day of the Dead'.

When I met the girl that night and showed her the rose there was a disappointed look in her eyes, but I told her: ""I was looking for a marigold for some weird reason, but this is what I could find; please accepted as a placeholder/rain check while I get you a marigold tomorrow"". She started crying.

A few days later, she told me that THE MARIGOLD was her sign of who was to be her true love (who gives marigold flowers on a first date anyway?). We've been together for over 6 years now and recently married.",2016-11-07 22:08:00+00:00,d9q6mug,1.0,t3_5blita,40826,AskReddit

We looked below and behind a tree, we looked up and there was the critter, on a high branch. I tried to reach for her but would just meow. It climbed down a branch within my reach and I touched it on the head, it purred loudly. 

I grabbed it, put it on my SO's shoulder where it started to purr like a mini diesel engine. Did not attack, run away or anything. Looks like it was born in the park and needed a home. So, we brought her in. Our oldest cat is NOT amused, but she'll get used to it. ",2016-09-04 07:57:02+00:00,d78x33p,1.0,t3_51338z,389,catpictures

186,"A bit late but hope someone else reads this. 

I was in an abusive relationship for the last 7 years of my previous marriage, I basically endured physical, emotional and spiritual abuse from my ex wife that I had accepted the idea of never being happy and dying like a provider/donkey machine which just works and never gets to enjoy much. Even a coffee or beer with a friend was out of the question back then.  

One night I found my (then) best friend and then wife humping away in bed. I felt like I was going to have a heart attack, chest pain, nausea and RAGE. 

Confronted both and I basically left for work the next day and never came back home. My parent's home was my next stop, they had seen her behaviour for years but did not interfere in the relationship. 

All of a sudden I found myself in my late 30s having trouble deciding what to wear or eat because the previous relationship was that much manipulative. 

Eventually got on another relationship, I was quite broken at first not knowing how to react to ""genuine TLC"", I kept my guard up for a few years until many things fell into place and I finally broke down and became depressed and had to go to the mental hospital on suicide watch. Meds and therapy made me better. 

Long story short, on my second wedding I WAS THE ONE CRYING FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS!  There wasn't a dry eye during the ceremony. I learned to finally let go after many years. ",2015-12-15 06:57:11+00:00,cxzi57c,1.0,t3_3ws26a,65714,AskReddit

Históricamente fué la Capital del Territorio de Baja California hasta que Mexicali llegó a serlo. 

Ciudad tranquila, en el centro hay casi de todo. La vista hacia el malecón y los cruceros no tiene comparación. 

Las montañas NO ESTAN CERCAS, son al menos 5-8 horas a San Pedro Martir y 3 horas a Laguna Hanson. 

Lugares interesantes cerca de Ensenada para vivir son San Antonio de las Minas (mas caro, mas que nada porque el status de vivir en ""rancho suburbano"" tiene cierta tendencia y Valle de Guadalupe (por los viñedos)/Francisco Zarco aunque ahí hay carencia de servicios y pavimentación.

So I just got my new starter gear, boar brush (is it normal that a 30-50 hair clump falls out after the first wash?). 

Lord L5 DE razor. With the Lord blade included, also teo packages of Super Max blades and a Personna pack. 

Two mexican Noble soaps, they smell like lavender. Good stuff. 

I'm using Noxima for preshave, and will eventually use the tub for the soap. For now I'm using and old incense oil burner as a stand for everything.
