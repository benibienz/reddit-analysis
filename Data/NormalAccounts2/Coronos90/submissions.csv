I use to be a PLD and spent alot of extra time grinding up a bst wich was hard but really fun back then. I really just wanna come back and do all the expansion's stories that I missed, I have to make a new account. What would be the most populated server, best starting city, and class to play. If im having alot of fun I may try to get into endgame stuff at some point.",ffxi,Returning Player,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxi/comments/4pf2wv/returning_player/

 Hero? After she called turn I put her on sets of 5, as I blocked aces and tens, turned two pair, rarely has sets of jacks which she would either reraise preflop, KQ is unlikely, based on her earlier play I don't think she wasn't floating gut shots.",poker,"Live 1/2 line check, weird river spot.",https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/45301h/live_12_line_check_weird_river_spot/

Instead of EDTA they should test the blood in the vehicle to see if they can approximate the age of the individual. If it's blood from when Avery was 23 even if it comes out in an age difference of 5-10 years like the article suggests, it would show that the blood was taken when Steven was much younger and it wasn't blood from when he was in his late forties. Which means the blood in the vehicle was from 1985 when Steven was 23 and it wasn't blood from him when he ""committed"" the murder.",MakingaMurderer,Could this blood test help?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakingaMurderer/comments/3zt7g3/could_this_blood_test_help/
