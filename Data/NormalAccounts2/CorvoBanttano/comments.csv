She can go invisible, get stealth headshots whilst invisible that multiply in damage and steal loot from nearby enemies whilst invisible. Also, she can create pathways with her dashwires to stay out of site, create bubbles that make players inside invisible, use distractions arrows and AoE arrows that put all enemies to sleep, making them vulnerable to stealth kills for a period of time, and rendering them immobile. She also has a ability that let's her steer arrows towards targets. Her ultimate is the Artemis bow. Basically a high damage bow that let's you shoot multiple arrows horizontally or vertically all whilst using prowl, the stealth ability.





She's currently the only TRUE stealth frame. Ash and Loki just have invisibility abilities which just keep you unseen. Banshee is slightly better, but her abilities are more rounded, rather than fully stealth focused.",2016-01-11 17:24:39+00:00,cyu7nqu,3,t1_cyu6qp0,1385,Warframe

104,"Warframe has a load of pistols. I'll run you through the basics of the game. If a stealthy, rogue like style is more suited to you, consider the frames Loki or the newly added stealth frame Ivara. First, I'm going to warn you that this game is going to require a CONSIDERABLE amount of grinding.





1. Loki:
Loki is a trickster frame that is very popular. It has the following abilities.




Decoy: This puts a hologram of Loki where you cast it, drawing fire and allowing you to revive and other things.





Invisibility: This is one of the usual builds for Loki, as you attempt you spend the longest time invisible possible. Invisibility is the games easy mode, giving huge DMG multipliers and other perks, like not being shot at.






Switch Teleport: This is less useful. It basically let's you switch the positions of a target and yourself.






Radial Disarm: The other usual build of Loki is this. It basically forces every enemy around you to drop their gun, forcing them into their weak melee abilities.







I'd recommend Loki, but the newer frame Ivara is built around Archery and stealth may also fit your style. Perhaps do some research on her, because I don't have her built yet.







Weapons wise, you're going to want to aim for a few things. As a secondary, I'd recommend 2 weapons greatly. The first is the Lex Prime, and the second is the Despair. These are two quite late game weapons, but they're the best IMO. The Lex Prime is a high crit chance high damage semi auto pistol that can actually be used as a sort of sniper rifle. The Despair are throwing knives that maintain stealth.







As a primary, Bows are pretty good. You'll get the Paris Mk1 to begin with. You can quickly upgrade this for credits to the standard Paris. So, late game bows are really good. The Paris Prime is excellent, the Dread is brilliant and the Rakta Cernos is pretty good, as long as you mod them correctly.






Melee: Sadly, melee is pretty pointless at the moment in comparison to weapons. Whilst you can equip a primary, secondary and melee on any one class, you will probably use the melee the least. The best melee weapons as of now are the War, Broken War and the Dragon Nikana. These are pretty late game. Choose whatever to begin with and then just choose one of the above weapons to aim for.






Modding: Check some YouTube videos for this, because its too hard to explain.







As a starter frame if you haven't started the game at all yet, I'd pick Excalibur. He's the best all round frame from the 3.





Feel free to ask anything else. Sorry if any of this is hard to understand, I've got a shitty headache and the words all just blended together as I was writing. Good luck ;p

4. Zombies (occasionally?) drop spider pickups on death when WW grenades are used, that refill grenade ammo.

I think a possible fix would to be that they spawn mid round, and the next round doesn't begin until all Margwa are dead. This removes the difficulty of Zombies after the round is clear, meaning you are able to take on the Margwa(s) without any threat from Zombies.

648,"That shit needs changing quickly. The scout is the hardest class to play at the minute, and is the least rewarding. Infiltrators can go invisible, sprint across the map, CQC about 50 people in a room, interrogate them all and leave without a scratch. Enforcers just hide behind a shield spamming sleep grenades and stun grenades, and they can then CQC and Fulton.
What do scouts get? Meagre sniper rifles that are impossible to use during laggy games, the sway is ridiculous and the people you tranq snipe wake up 2 seconds later as you are approaching them.",2015-10-22 16:29:14+00:00,cw8zi73,3,t1_cw8ypap,1179,mgo

654,"Funnily enough, this exact same point was raised by someone else a day or two ago. Not complaining about the posts, but it seems that it's a common opinion and Treyarch would be wise to listen. I play a lot of a game called Warframe, and in it there is this parkour run thing. The best times on it are around 0.01 seconds because of a glitch, whereas a normal run takes around 30s.",2015-10-19 20:14:05+00:00,cw5jie7,1,t3_3pe8nf,898,blackops3
