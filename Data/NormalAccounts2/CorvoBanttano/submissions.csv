I'm not sure of the ages of the two, but I'm assuming with this that Arthur is the eldest.






You can hear the sounds of a steam train during the scene. During WW2, young children were evacuated, often by train. My theory is that Arthur remained as he was deemed old enough, whilst Percy was taken to the countryside. This was the last time the two saw each other, explaining why the flashback triggers the noises. Percy calling ""Arthur"" repeatedly may also have been a suggestion that Arthur got off the train before it went and Percy was calling him back, or just Percy calling goodbye.







This leads me on to the 'terrible thing' the people of WW did to save themselves after the Germans invaded. If Arthur was still in WW, and Percy was elsewhere, what if the residents of WW used their seemingly advanced technology to destroy the rest of the country.






This would kill millions, but wipe out the invading Germans and save themselves. Percy would be killed, Arthur would remain alive and have a VERY guilty conscience. This also might explain why the game is set on Islands, if the rest of the country was completely removed and all that was left was the small islands surrounding WW.

For example, this thread on the Respawn forums is focused on the idea that MacAllan somehow survives the Demeter blast and goes on to continue the War. Whilst I personally think this might be slightly farfetched, it's up to you.





&gt;http://www.respawn.com/forum//viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=21382







So, another theory, and my personal favourite, is the idea of a prequel. We know the drop pod in the trailer is meant for MacAllan, and I find it unlikely that they would keep that name if it went on to be a completely different character.






Through different snips of information and past community posts, I strongly believe that there was a war prior to the Titan wars. This war possibly involved MacAllan and Graves, as well as some of the others. This may lead on to why MacAllan committed mutiny on the Odyssey, and possibly gives some hints at motive for the rest of Titanfall 1.






Another factor hinting at this to me is the lack of development in the trailer we saw. In Titanfall, sonic repulsion towers are possible that scare away any dangerous wildlife and keep it peaceful, (see Boneyard). Also, every map we visited had colonisation of some form, and there were no entirely rural maps with no development at all.






So doesn't it seem strange how suddenly, MacAllan is being dropped into combat right in the middle of a thick jungle with no other signs of buildings or technology present apart from his Titan. This leads me to believe that the previous war did in fact include MacAllan, and it may have involved the power struggle for planets in the Frontier to prepare for colonisation. Perhaps different countries from Earth were still a factor at this point, or maybe some other factions will come into play.





My final little reason why this is the most likely reason is the use of a sword. Whilst this is dope as hell, and I'm totally down for Attack on Titanfall 2, it doesn't seem as advanced as the punching in Titanfall 1. To me, and you may interpret it differently, this shows that the Titans are not as well built in this form, meaning they have had less development over time, hinting at a sequel. If the Titan is not strong enough to do sizeable damage with a punch, swords are a very viable option for melee combat.






I'm going to use a game some people here might hate as an analogy. That game is the bundle of fun that people call Call of Duty. Now, in the old games, knifing was used as the traditional melee. However, in Advanced Warfare, the introduction of exoskeletons allowing for incredible strength meant that a single punch did enough damage to kill.





While I do understand it isn't QUITE the same, I hope you get the point.







Anyway, this brings me on to one of two more possibilities in my eyes.





The future, and a simulation.






I'll start with going forwards in time. A few years after the destruction of Demeter, we know the IMC is still holding up thanks to the description of one of the maps, showing that their automated spectre production is still going strong.





What if this process is getting out of hand, and the Militia once again move to save the day. However, this does raise questions.





1. Why does the Pod still say James MacAllan? If the occupant of the Pod was a child of the T1 MacAllan, then why is he still using the same pod? However, we never really saw MacAllan use a drop pod in T1, maybe suggesting he did in fact escape the Demeter blast and he is now fighting again.





2. Who is the mother? I know T1 wasn't the most story driven experience in the world, but from my understanding, we didn't hear AT ALL of a wife/girlfriend of MacAllan, yet alone one carrying his kid.






3. Why is the occupant of the Pod being dropped into the middle of nowhere alongside a Titan? Maybe the Militia were attacked and this was an evacuation pod, and his Titan was dropped alongside him. However, we don't have any idea how long this pod had been there. For example, this could simply be a reference to the first game, and the Pod could be empty. Another idea of mine is that the Titan was not dropped with the Pod at all, and that a faction on the planet we see has come to see what happened.







Anyway, that leads me to a very short theory about this pod. We know very well that there are simulations designed to test pilots and train them. Whilst this is the least likely in my eyes, it could allow for any number of story routes.





Anyway, I hope somebody agrees with at least something I've written. Please, comment your own ideas. I'm really enjoying the discussions people are having, and I'd like to see what people think about my ideas.

Anyway, I was thinking that the only reason I never touch my clans Dojo is because of 2 things.






1. Hosting issues.






2. I can't do the sort of stuff I can do in the Liset.





So, here's my proposed change. First, add some sort of host migration system where whoever has the strongest connection will host, or make it a dedicated server that people can use whenever Dojo's start up.





Secondly, make the Dojo more like a home. Give players the option to spawn into the Dojo instead of the Liset, and let us customise our own quarters. We should be able to construct rooms for every person joining the clan, and then let them design it and use it just as much as the Liset.





We could have an armoury, foundry, modding, market and incubator all in the room, that would link to the Liset, so building one thing in the Liset will be claimable from the Dojo etc.

But anyway, I was thinking that there aren't too many frames that are viable in the endgame, and this could do with changing to allow diversity. My proposal is for a frame that is able to use different buffs from enemies around the battlefield, almost becoming a different frame.




1. Revert
All buffs on all enemies are removed for the duration of the ability. I think this would prove INCREDIBLY useful in the void when dealing with healers and other enemies.




2. Reflect
This one's a bit more situational. It would take any procs currently on your frame, and put them on the targeted enemy.





3. Can't think of a name.
This ability would share all buffs between nearby Tenno. For example, Loki could cast Invisibility, and then [untitled frame] could case [untitled ability] and the nearby teammates and the frame itself would get the invisibility until the [untitled frame]s ability ran out.




4. Balance
All buffs are stolen from all enemies in a large ranged AoE ability. They are then all placed onto the frame. Basically, it makes the frame very powerful for a small period of time. To balance it out, the energy drain would have to be quite significant.






I think this frame would work well with an average amount of shields and health, and a slightly below average movement speed. It would allow for more diversity with building it, but not allow it to become a complete tank taking all buffs and having ridiculous health.

The only thing I can generally do and do well is snipe in games like Battlefield, because I'm not at risk and I'm good at tracking targets/judging bullet drop. I was just wondering if this was something actually implemented into the game. I remember the first time we saw the game demo'd, the 5th player was out of the way, shooting holes in the walls from far away to open up sight lines for teammates.




Just wondering if this actually made it into the final game?",Rainbow6,Sniping?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/3vjk3z/sniping/

We know Diamond is making a comeback, and Gold is in every CoD nowadays, so all that leaves to work out is the 'special camo' teased to us. My theory for this is as follows.





We all know that there are now Camouflages for MP, Zombies and Campaign. These camos are unlockable on the guns in each of these modes. My theory is that when all camos in EVERY mode have been unlocked for a certain gun, the mastery camo for that gun will unlock.
Eg. The Shieva gets all camos unlocked for it in EVERY mode. This unlocks a secret camo.

When EVERY camo in Zombies, MP and campaign is unlocked for EVERY gun, the mastery camo will then be unlocked.",blackops3,Camo Speculation,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops3/comments/3qyxdu/camo_speculation/
