Be they crispy or from Wendys.
Spend my hard-earned good-boy points,
on Kid's Meal ball pit burger joints.
Mummy lifts me to the car,
To find me tendies near and far.
Enjoy my tasty tendie treats,
in comfy big boy booster seats.
McDonald's, Hardee's, Popeye's, Cane's,
But of my tendies none remains.

She tries to make me take a nappy,
But sleeping doesn't make me happy.
Tendies are the only food,
That puts me in the napping mood.
I'll scream and shout and make a fuss,
I'll scratch, I'll bite, I'll even cuss!
Tendies are my heart's desire,
Fueled by raging, hungry fire.
Mummy sobs and wails and cries,
But tears aren't tendies, nugs or fries.

My good-boy points were fairly earned,
To buy the tendies that I've yearned.
But there's no tendies on my plate!
Did mummy think that I'd just ate?
""TENDIES TENDIES GET THEM NOW,
YOU FAT, UNGRATEFUL, SLUGGISH SOW!""

109,"Watch your back because the next man is coming
And you don't know if the next man is dumbin'
Survival of the fittest what it is
I got your back, you got my back, and that's the biz
Blood is rushing through my veins, I got the power
Channel the energy and with my strength I will devour
Sickenin thoughts is runnin' through my head
That's when I realized I'm glad I'm not dead

Corruption and it grows
The salesman of our blood
For the public's craving
Existence in the dark

It's in our nature to destroy ourselves
It's in our nature to kill ourselves
It's in our nature to kill each other
It's out nature to kill, kill, kill

It was a dream and then it hit me
Reality struck, and now my life is all shifty
And it all moves, close to a buck 50
We all stand strong in respect to the family
In times of insanity
And through words of profanity
I describe our dysfunctional family
Blood brothers keep it real to the end
Deeper than the thoughts you think, not a trend

Corruption and it grows
The salesman of our blood
For the public's craving
Existence in the dark

It's in our nature to destroy ourselves
It's in our nature to kill ourselves
It's in our nature to kill each other
It's out nature to kill, kill, kill

It's in our nature to destroy ourselves
It's in our nature to kill ourselves
It's in our nature to kill each other

Well I have news for the narrator of this story, I think you are a very neat guy and that you will find the love of your life one day and this one will give you the love and respect you deserve so much. Forget the one you are pining over in this tune - you gave and gave and gave and it was never enough. Move on Buster Brown and sail brown bay to chocolate town.

423,"The three main contenders are John Matrix, Dutch Schaefer and Conan The Barbarian. If no firearms were allowed then I would give my vote to Conan due to his brutal expertise in hand to hand. Schaefer would come in second - this is a man who went toe to toe against a Predator and won. Matrix would be third, without the added motivation of rescuing his daughter he would lack the killer edge that let him annihilate an entire drug lords army with relative ease, I do take into consideration Matrix hand to hand combat with Bennet but I consider The Predator a higher tier threat than that chainmail wearing goon.

Hercules would also do quite well as he is a Demi God, however he lacked the killer instinct and will to kill.

You have to take in the motivation of the characters, e.g. John Kimble - he was motivated by the children and his need to protect them, without this he is just a cop, a brutally effective one but still a cop. Total Recall was just a regular guy until his memories were messed about etc.etc. Conan wins here again, he has been in situations like this before - gladiatorial combat is bread and butter for him, he thanks Crom for such fun and games.

Uh...
Here come the Men in Black
It's the M.I.B.'s, uhh, here come the M.I.B.'s
Here come the Men in Black
They won't let you remember
Nah nah nah

The good guys dress in black remember that
Just in case we ever face to face and make contact
The title held by me - M.I.B.
Means what you think you saw, you did not see
So don't blink be what was there
Is now gone, black suit with the black Ray Ban's on
Walk in shadow, move in silence
Guard against extra-terrestrial violence
But yo we ain't on no government list
We straight don't exist, no names and no figerprints
Saw somethin strange, watch your back
Cause you never quite know where the M.I.B.'s is at
Uh and...

Here come the Men in Black (Men in Blaaaaack)
Galaxy defenders (oahhaooohh ohhhhh)
Here come the Men in Black (Men in Blaaaaack)
They won't let you remember

Uh uh, uh uh, now
From the deepest of the darkest of night
On the horizon, bright light enters sight tight
Cameras zoom, on the impending doom
But then like BOOM black suits fill the room up
With the quickness talk with the witnesses
Hypnotizer, neuralizer
Vivid memories turn to fantasies
Ain't no M.I.B.'s, can I please
Do what we say that's the way we kick it
Yaknahmean? I see my noisy cricket get wicked on ya
We're your first, last and only line of defense
Against the worst scum of the universe
So don't fear us, cheer us
If you ever get near us, don't jeer us, we're the fearless
M.I.B.'s, freezin up all the flack
(What's that stand for?) Men In Black

Uhh M
The Men in Black...
The Men in Black

Let me see ya just bounce it with me, just bounce with me
Just bounce it with me c'mon
Let me see ya just slide with me, just slide with me
Just slide with me c'mon
Let me see ya take a walk with me, just walk it with me
Take a walk with me c'mon
And make your neck work
Now freeze...

Here come the Men in Black (Men in Blaaaaack)
The galaxy defenders
Right on, right on
Here come the Men in Black (Men in Blaaaaack)
They won't let you rememberk (ohhhh nooooo)

Alright check it, let me tell you this in closin
I know we might seem imposin
But trust me if we ever show in your section
Believe me, it's for your own protection
Cause we see things that you need not see
And we be places that you need not be
So go witcha life, forget that Roswell crap
Show love to the black suit, cause that's the Men in
That's the Men in...

Here come the Men in Black (here they comeeeee)
The galaxy defenders (ga-la-xy de-fenders)
Here come the Men in Black (ohhhh here they come)
They won't let you remember (won't, let you, rememberrrr)
Here come the Men in Black (ohhhh here they come)
Galaxy defenders (ohh ohh, ohh ohh, ohh ohh)
Here come the Men in Black
They won't let you remember

Determination, to steal what you can and run from the nation

Stop the violence from the police
You know my dad used to say but now he's deceased
He got caught in a jam, threw in the can
When the cops from Brooklyn said he killed another man
Seek knowledge was my main game
To figure out the the law, to figure out the frame
