298,"Storage formats--ALL OF THEM--HDDs, DVDs, HD-DVDs, BDs, flash drives, etc. use the SI definiton of KB, MB, GB. That is, 1 KB = 1000 bytes, 1 MB = 1000 KB, 1 GB = 1000 MB. Thus, when an HDD reports that it has 80 GB, they mean it has 80,000,000,000 bytes available on it. Computer OSes don't use that. They use the binary definition for KB et al. 1 KB = 1024 bytes, 1 MB = 1024 KB, 1 GB = 1024 MB. To prevent this confusion, these are sometimes written as KiB, MiB, etc. (""binary kilobyte""). So, let's do the math:


 For DVD,

 4.7 GB ==&gt; 4.337 GiB

 8.5 GB  ==&gt; 7.91 GiB

___

 For Blu-ray, 

 50 GB = 50,000,000,000 bytes. To convert that into the GiB that the computer sees, we divide by 1024^3, and get...46.56 GiB.
___
 For HDDs,

 80 GB ==&gt; 74.5 GiB

 120 GB ==&gt; 111.75 GiB
___
 For HD-DVD,

 30 GB ==&gt; 27.93 GiB

 51 GB ==&gt; 47.49 GiB

416,"""Branch Similarity Threshold"" is a meter of how accurate you want branches to be. The lower the number, the higher quality branches. A higher number gets a larger amount of branches but quality may suffer and it may be easy to tell when the track skips around.

""Branch Probability Range"" is how likely it is that a branch will be used. 100% means that if a branch is passed, it will certainly be used. 0% means that no branches will be used. This value is checked every time a branch is passed. If you have a range instead of a single value, it will use a random integer from in between your maximum and minimum values.

""Branch Probability Ramp-up Speed"" increases the value of Branch Probability Range for every branch passed. For example, if you have a Branch Probability Range of exactly 10%, and your Branch Probability Ramp-up Speed is exactly 5%, for every branch you pass you will go from 10% likelihood to 15% likelihood to...either 20% likelihood or 22.5% likelihood, I'm not quite sure. The former assuming it uses the original value of Branch Probability Range every time to increase, the latter assuming it uses the output of Branch Probability Ramp-up Speed. 

""Allow only reverse branches"" makes it impossible to travel through a branch forward in a song. If you want to repeat a portion without ever escaping from it, check this, as well as the other settings (excluding the value of 12, play around with this depending on the song). It makes it so that it will have a 100% chance of looping back to the beginning of the sequence and given a low enough Branch Similarity Threshold value, it should be high quality. 

""Loop extension optimization"" doesn't mean anything to me, but it's on by default so I just leave it.

Hope this made sense. I'm on mobile and rambled quite a bit so just ask me if you have any questions.",2015-11-25 22:36:21+00:00,cxd3mzb,5.0,t1_cxcqog7,20017.0,Ratatat

457,"According to [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Are-free-inhabitants-a-real-thing-in-the-United-States-Do-they-have-any-legitimate-legal-claims):

&gt;Once she said 'Articles of Confederation'  I laughed.

&gt;Article 4 States 
But to instill a national feeling, ""[t]he better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the people of the different States in this union,"" it establishes equal treatment and freedom of movement for the FREE INHABITANTS of each state to pass unhindered between the states, excluding ""paupers, vagabonds, and fugitives from justice."" All these people are entitled to equal rights established by the state into which he travels. If a crime is committed in one state and the perpetrator flees to another state, he will be extradited to and tried in the state in which the crime was committed.

&gt;Even in this, there is nothing that states you get to ignore the laws of the state you are in.  In fact it says the state you are in says what rights you have.

&gt;And it is all a dead point anyway because The Articles of Confederation were replaced in 1789 by the ratification of the Constitution.

If you have a warm apple pie, an animation may show the smoothness of the top of the pie, a good color scheme of the inside and outside of it, and some heat marks coming off of it.

574,"ill once again start this post letting everyone down, due to pax we are just today finalizing the release date for afterbirth… therefor we need to postpone the release date trailer till next monday so we can start taking preorders on the same date. i know it seems like im messing with you guys at this point but i swear im not, in fact ill give you a bit of info about release to ease your minds a bit.
-afterbirth will be out before xmas
-afterbirth will preorder with a considerable discount 
-afterbirth will be awesome.

we showed/tested the game out at pax and the response was extremely positive, especially for greed mode (which we are still currently tuning) so ill switch this post over to the 2nd half of the greed mode update with added video gameplay from pax for those that missed it!

Greed Waves
greed modes main game is fighting off waves of randomly chosen sets of enemies that spawn around the room. these waves ramp in difficulty and continue to stack on top of one another till you hit wave 8, press the stop button or die.
the more waves you string together without hitting the stop button the higher the cash bonus and if you are able to do it without taking damage there is another bonus in it for you. after wave 8 you get a breather to cash in your winnings and the button mysteriously changes to a skull!
image
pressing said skull will start the “boss waves” an easy wave (on par with a basic boss from that chapter)and a med wave (usually an easy level boss with a small mob). you get a lot more time to kill these waves, but depending on how fast you are there is a high chance that the second boss will spawn in along side the first… but you can always sacrifice half a heart to stop the next wave from spawning if things are looking dire.
image
once these boss waves are finished, the exit door will unbar and you will be able to progress to the next level… or you can take a chance with the “nightmare boss wave” in order to unlock the devil room door.
but get this… every single room in greed mode is 100% new, cursed rooms yield totally new surprises, secret rooms have bigger pay offs and the content of devil rooms aren’t exactly what you are use to.. in fact all the pools in greed mode are totally new and have been heavily modded to fit greed mode perfectly.
all in all greed mode will feel like a totally new experience that will not only yield tons of rewards for completing it with each character.. but also features a very unique ending that should have you coming back for more for quite a while.
and here is some actual footage of afterbirth being played for the first time ever publicly by one of the best isaac players of all time, cobalt! (greed mode starts around the 18 min mark )
enjoy!

you only kinda get a taste of greed mode in the video but the further you go the more greed will take over and the theme of this mode will really make itself known to you. risk/reward is a huge theme here and if you get too greedy.. it will bite you in the ass hard.

While a lot of people would like a longer period of discovery, Cobalt pretty much wraps it up in a week.

That's why I didn't watch the last week-long stream of his, and why I don't plan on doing it this time. I'm just going to sit at my computer for a few hours trying to figure out what's going on for myself.

That said, what Cobalt's doing isn't necessarily a bad thing, because many people want to know the secrets as soon as they can. But for me, it's like swallowing a $100 steak in one bite.

This budget is...acceptable. A few notes:

* I added more RAM. Is this neccesary? Usually I have Steam, Skype, Winamp, and about 10 tabs of Chrome open with about 10 extensions. I heard Chrome is tough on memory, but I'm not sure if this is overdoing it.

* I added an optical drive for the operating system. To me, it's just worth it for the ease of use and not having to find an ISO. Yes, I know it's probably very easy, but I'm sticking with the disc.

* I changed my operating system to Windows 7 Home Premium. I'm more familiar with it, it has more support, and it's ever so slightly cheaper. However, if there is a case to be made for another version of Windows, I'm interested.

* I went with your choice of headset, after locating it on Amazon. Thanks for the suggestion.

* I chose a Logitech K120 keyboard. If you have any thoughts on it one way or the other, go ahead.

* I dropped the SSD as suggested. More expensive for less than 20% of the space? I don't care if my boot takes 10 seconds longer, no thank you.

* What about this monitor makes it worth spending ~50 dollars more for against the other monitor that I had in my original build?

* My previous one merchant of only Amazon has been increased slightly to two to include Newegg. Any thoughts on merchants?

Yes, I do! I moderate /r/2spooky4me, which was booming with content before /r/ledootgeneration overtook it. It was definitely a learning experience and I have fond memories of interacting with the community and the pride of being a moderator.

**4) Do you have experience in coding/CSS/design?**

I am somewhat familar with CSS and the other parts of designing a subreddit. To see some of my work, see /r/ComproseTheme, which I made contributions to. I'm willing to learn even more to help design this sub.

**5) Do you produce ASMR content?**

Unfortunately, I do not. I'm only a listener of ASMR content. Maybe one day, though!

**6) What is your location/timezone?**

I live in Massachusetts on the East Coast of the US, so I use Eastern Time.

672,"[The most memorable and worst part of the book for me was](/s ""when the main character meets up with Aech for the first time and sees that it's not a white guy, but a black, transgendered, homeless girl who made her game avatar a white guy because she felt like she would have more opportunities in game. And then the main character literally says, almost word for word, 'I didn't care that she was black, transgendered, or homelsss. She was my friend, and that's all that mattered.' I understand that you want to teach people to be accepting, but the scene felt so forced and preachy that I had to put the book down for a few minutes and wonder why everybody liked it so much. Again, nothing against the message, but the writing is just amazingly bad."")
