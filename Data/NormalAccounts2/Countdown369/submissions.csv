3.	NO OTHER ARTIST BASHING, save that precious ammo for when that artist's time to be roasted comes. This includes suggesting artists for future roasts, it detracts from the focus of the post. If you want to suggest an artist, PM me.

5.	The next artist/thing up will be posted in the thread the week before, so you guys will have time to come up with material and decent jokes referring to the artist.

6.	Have fun! This is meant to be lighthearted thread and they are to be taken as such. Roast away!!

[This is the most recent one, for reference.](https://reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/4tazs1/rnfl_roast_of_the_new_york_jets/)

I was wondering if this sub would enjoy participating in roast threads of artists. These threads can't be daily because there are infinite indie artists and everyone would become tired of it in a week. But I think that it would be a pretty entertaining discussion to rip into our favorite bands with some witty banter. 

If you guys are interested, just tell me in the comments. I'm going to sleep now but if the reception is positive, in a few hours I'll post the first actual roast thread. Thanks for reading!

**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**

I'm unsure of what to do about hooking up my computer to my monitor. I've attached the DVI cable to the monitor and the graphics card. However, I'm not really sure about what to do with the other cables. I have a VGA cable that attaches to my monitor, but my graphics card does not have a VGA port. Both have an HDMI port, but I do not have an HDMI cable. My monitor does not have a DisplayPort port, and my graphics card does.

My question is, what do I need to connect to be able to see something when I turn my computer and monitor on? Is DVI enough, or do I need to connect HDMI and buy a VGA to DisplayPort converter? Or forget about VGA and DisplayPort and connect DVI and HDMI? Or what? I'm very confused, and I hope I did a good job explaining why. Feel free to ask me clarifying questions in the comments.

**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**

I found out the names of all the ports? I'm new to building and I don't have many cables, so there's not a lot for me to ""try out"" bar me buying some cables and converters.

**Post relevant photos of build/parts here.**

This is my first build, so I need everything listed in one form or another. I can spend up to $1200 but I hope I don't have to. Also, if someone could tell me what exactly I'm getting with the Windows 8.1 OS, I would appreciate it. I'm not sure if I need a USB or what to set it up.",buildapc,"[Build Ready] First gaming PC, about $1000 USD, the works in terms of peripherals",http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/3fohv8/build_ready_first_gaming_pc_about_1000_usd_the/

* Browsing and games. The highest intensity games will probably end up being CS:GO and Rocket League. Want these at 60 FPS please!

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

* $1100. I don't think I will need to use nearly this amount, but if it comes to it, that's my budget.

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

* Probably close to the beginning of September.

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

* The works. Monitor, keyboard, headset (or any decent headphone + microphone combination), tower, OS, *and* a wireless adapter.

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

* USA, Massachusetts. I have a Microcenter relatively close by.

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

* [Dell E153FPb](http://www.overstock.com/Electronics/Dell-E153FPB-15-inch-UltraSharp-Black-LCD-Monitor/4022907/product.html). Yes, this means I'm trying for a duel monitor setup with this as my secondary monitor.

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

* No.

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

* SSD, preferably.

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* No, any color or theme will do for a case.

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

* Yes, I do. Preferably Windows 7, or if it's cheaper Windows 8/8.1.

&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**

* This is my first build ever. Thanks for helping me out here, I really am unsure of a lot of things in the PC building community.",buildapcforme,"First timer, budget of about a thousand USD for a gaming computer.
