I've hacked pretty much all my consoles (Wii, Wii U, etc) so I do have *some* experience, but this seems daunting.

A couple questions:

1) Am I going to have issues using a MicroSD to SD adapter?

2) How do I 100% avoid the 9.2 downgrade softbrick? I don't have a CFW 3DS, so if I have to go to 11.0 I'm fucked.

3) What are my chances of bricking?

4) How should I prepare for the install? What prep work should I do in the coming days?

Sometimes I have to break the solder gun out to repair power issues, but most of the time a quick bake in the ""dedicated graphics oven"" does the trick.

Can you please explain ""in line with what consoles offered power-wise""? 

It shouldn't matter that you can inject ""hacks"". Any i5/i7 since Sandy Bridge will beat an FX chip even in multicore situations. You can't just magically unlock power in the FX chip. It's architecture has limited it. It's why AMD is actually sending FX ""the way of the dodo"" with Zen.

As far as overall emulation goes, Intel will still be the better choice for a long time (unless Zen is a home-run). 

Sure DX12 will make CPUs *less* of a bottleneck, but you'll still see slight gains with an Intel.

Okay, holy shit. Let's start.

You've got your two E5-2699 Xeons with their whole 72 threads of processing power. We've also got 2 Noctua U12Ss to go on them (can't go wrong with Noctua, and air cooling is way safer than liquid).

We've got the Supermicro X10DAX to keep your I/O times low and uptime at it's absolute maximum.

The Supermicro is one hell of a board, you'll be getting every last drop out of those Xeons.

We've got 256 GB of *fast* Crucial DDR4 RAM.

For storage you're rocking 2 Intel 750s at 1.2 TB and 2 1TB Samsung Pro 850s.

For your GPU-assisted processing I opted for 2 Titan Zs. We needed to cram as much power into one PCI-E slot as we could to make room for those lovely 750s.

The double-precision and workstation ability of the Zs won't disappoint you.

For the PSU we have the EVGA Supernova T2 1600W Titanium power supply. That 1600w should be plenty enough to keep this absolute beast running, and the Titanium cert only ensures you'll be getting the most out of your watts.

For the case I went for the Corsair 900D. It's an absolute beast of a case that literally weighs a ton (well not literally but you get it), so it's not going to fall off a desk or anything. It's got plenty of room to fit the massive amount of hardware you're rocking.

For the fans, I went with the most reliable, quietest, and best performing fans you could ever hope for. The Noctua NF-F12s are the best fans I've ever used. These 4 in conjunction with the fans from the 900D will keep the whole system nice and cool.

And then we have the DVD drive.

After all that you have about $300 for SATA cables and an OS.

Yes, some i5s are faster than some i7s (for example, the i7 2600 could be beat by an i5 4690).

But to say that i5s are better than i7s in general is false. i7s have some instruction extensions that may be useful in the future concerning Xenia and the like, not to mention they have hyper-threading.

Swapped down to a quad core.

Put in 32 GB of RAM so you can run multiple game servers at once with no lag.

Has a fairly nice motherbaord, should server (heh) you well.

Put in a 2 TB NAS drive so you'll still have plenty of space and it'll be reliable.

And finally I decided a Platinum PSU was probably the best because the server will probably be on 24/7.",2015-06-17 05:38:27+00:00,cs9a4co,5.0,t1_cs99usu,672.0,pcmasterrace

Just above $1500.

For that you get the 8-core Xeon, a good motherboard, 64 GB of DDR4, 4 TB of storage, nothing too crazy, but an awesome server nonetheless.
