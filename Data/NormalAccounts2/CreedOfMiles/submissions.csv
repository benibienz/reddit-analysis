She puts out when she's properly terrified. So Fred starts this whole Mystery Machine thing to just drive around and bang Daphne. (Pretty much every episode, they go 'look for clues' together and come back with nothing.) They're always in a rundown area because there's always been plenty of those if you're looking for them (and that's what Fred is doing) But his parents aren't going to let his teenage ass drive off with his girlfriend in a van and assume it's totally legit just because he painted the side of it. So he gets Velma. Velma is the face of the group. She brings legitimacy to their ""mystery team"". In actuality, she's the nerdy kid desperate to be liked by the Prom King &amp; Queen who have invited her to go hunt ghosts. However, they can't just drive off to locations and leave Velma in a haunted house while they go fuck. Velma might get the sense of third wheel pretty quick. So he got Shaggy as well. Shaggy is his childhood stoner buddy who always backs his play because he doesn't really give a shit. It's cool, man. As long as you keep taking Shaggy to cool places to go get high with his dog (hence they also usually go look for clues and come back with nothing but a huge appjavascript:void(0)etite). So now Velma thinks she's part of a crack team of ghost hunters, when really she's just the front for a mobile fuckshack. One team goes and looks for clues, another team goes and looks for clues, and so does she! When she started actually solving mysteries... all the better.

11,2016-09-29 02:46:52+00:00,self.3dshacks,https://www.reddit.com/r/3dshacks/comments/5505v8/guide_shacking_on_a_budget_making_your_perfect/,False,"So if you're like me, you don't have a ton of money to splurge, but you love Nintendo stuff and you reallyyyy love the 3DS. 

So whether you're a prospective first-time buyer or looking to buy another 3DS to hack, this guide will help you decide what you should purchase!

Disclaimer: Prices in this guide are based in the US. Prices will vary country to country.

**SECTION I - THE SYSTEM**

The 3DS has a wide range when it comes to pricing. Systems range from $40 to $600. I'll be placing systems into tiers to help you pick the right bracket.

About the systems:

2DS - A great value. Lacks 3D and all the features of the N3DS. Internally, it's the same as the o3DS. Despite it's looks, the 2DS is pretty easy to handle with any size hand (it seems to fit better in large hands however). ***Always*** comes with firmware 6-7 (when purchased brand new), which allows for easy A9LH installation.

Original 3DS - The original compact system. Has standard 3D (no face tracking), and generally comes with a telescopic stylus. Can be quite uncomfortable if you have big hands.

3DS XL - The OG's big brother. Much easier to handle than the original 3DS (unless you have baby hands). The bigger screen size is a wonderful improvement (unless you're looking for compact).

New 3DS - The budget ""new"" option. Much more compact than the XL variant. Generally comes with firmware 10.7 or below. Has face tracking 3D, a C-Stick, and a much improved CPU (which allows for a broader range of homebrew use). This system is only marginally larger than the original 3DS.

New 3DS XL - The pinnacle of the 3DS family. Has all the features of the New 3DS while being easier to hold.

***Something to consider:*** Installing A9LH on New 3DS's is much easier than the old variants. A 2.1 downgrade is not necessary, which eliminates a large step in the process. It is much harder to remove the SD card however.

Now for the tiers!

**TIER I ($40-$60):** This tier consits of the 2DS and only the 2DS. At this price point, you should look at [these eBay listings](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_mPrRngCbx=1&amp;_udlo=&amp;_udhi=60&amp;_nkw=2ds&amp;rt=nc&amp;LH_Auction=1). If possible, message the seller asking what firmware it's on (if you'll be installing A9LH)*

**TIER II ($70-$100):** At the lowest point on this spectrum, you can buy a refurbished 2DS with Mario Kart 7 [from Nintendo](https://store.nintendo.com/ng3/us/po/browse/productDetailColorSizePicker.jsp?categoryNav=true&amp;navAction=jump&amp;navCount=0&amp;atg.multisite.remap=false&amp;productId=prod760270&amp;categoryId=cat200006). These systems will *always* come with 11.0+, so keep this in mind when buying these. The o3DS and o3DS XL can be easily found on eBay for this price. You can also make a post on /r/hardwareswap, where these systems pop up regularly. You can also check your local GameStop or similar shop, where you can pick up 2DS's and o3DS's for cheap.

**TIER III ($110-$150):** At this price, you can look into picking up a used New 3DS XL on eBay. For $150 you can pick up a brand new New 3DS at [Target](http://www.target.com/p/new-nintendo-3ds-super-mario-3d-land-edition/-/A-51327765), these always come with 10.7.


**TIER IV ($160-$200):** At this price, you should be looking at a used XL or a brand new XL. You can walk into pretty much any retailer and get a new XL for this price.

**SECTION II - STORAGE**

You *will* want more space than what will come with most units. The question is, *how much*?

| Size   | Fit For 
|:-----------|--------------------------------:|
| 16 GB     | Users who will be playing games primarily on carts and won't be storing lots of material|      
|32 GB  |  Users who will have a fair amount of game backups and CIAs, while not having an excessive amount of data |  
| 64 GB       | Power users. Recommended for people who will have a lot of game backups and CIAs.      |      
| 128 GB       | Extreme users. Recommended for people who will be developing software, harboring multiple EmuNANDs, or storing entire genres of games.       |  

""But Creed? What's the best size for my dollars man!""

For most people, 64 GB will be the perfect amount. You'll never have to worry about space (for the most part), and you won't pay that much of a premium over 32 GB.

Oh and something I should mention: ***fakes.*** There are tons of the bloody things. For this reason, I recommend buying a card from a reputable dealer such as Amazon (fulfilled!) or your local retailer.

You should always buy a Class 10 card with a decent speed (48 MB/s). If you don't, your games/home menu will take ages to load.

If you're using an o3DS, you'll need a microSD adapter.

Some cards I recommend: [16 GB](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Class-Adapter-MB-MP16DA-AM/dp/B00IVPU7KE/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1475113512&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=16+gb+micro+sd), [32 GB](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Class-Adapter-MB-MP32DA-AM/dp/B00IVPU786/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1475113581&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=32+gb+micro+sd), [64 GB](https://www.amazon.com/Patriot-Transfer-Speeds-Cameras-Tablets/dp/B00BTYZ3GM/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1475113635&amp;sr=8-8&amp;keywords=64+gb+micro+sd), [128 GB](https://www.amazon.com/PNY-Elite-Microsdxc--UHS-I-P-SDU128U185EL-GE/dp/B01G26R7LA/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1475113680&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=128+gb+micro+sd)

**SECTION III - THE EXPLOIT**

You will fall into one of three categories: the 1st being you are on a firmware lower than 10.7. If you are, skip this and use BrowserHax/menuhax. The 2nd being you already have a hacked 3DS. In that case, use one of the Secondary cart exploits found on the wiki. The 3rd category is that this is your only 3DS (above 10.7), use Cubic Ninja as your exploit. It can be picked up for around $25 at GameStop. If it can't be found at GS, eBay has used carts for $30-$35.

In other countries, FreakyForms Deluxe can be found for around $20 brand new. Most shops should have a copy in stock.

The absolute best value for most people is going to be Cubic Ninja or FreakyForms. They're the cheapest primary exploits.

If you're over firmware 10.7 and you'd like to get A9LH, the cheapest (albeit shady) way is to go to a store that allows returns on new items that have been opened, buy a 2DS, install A9LH on it and then use it to install A9LH on your 3DS, and then return the 2DS.

**SECTION IV - DS PLAYBACK**
 
This one is easy. The max microSD card size 99.9% of users will need is 32 GB. I recommend a 16 GB card, as it's the best value for DS playback.

If you'll be running CFW you should get a [DSTT](http://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=157), it's an insane value and works with CIA forwarders (channels that let you launch a DS game right from your home menu!)

If you're running just regular homebrew, an [R4i RTS](http://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=146) will work on the latest firmware.

**SECTION V - CONCLUSION**

To boil it down, if you want the absolute cheapest but most feature-filled gateway into 3D Shacking, I recommend buying a brand-new 2DS, a 32 GB microSD, and a DSTT paired with a 16 GB microSD. This will run you just over $100 in most places, and you'll be able to play every title from a Nintendo handheld ever (barring n3DS exclusives).

Hope this helped!


**Terminology for nubbies**

o3DS - the old 3DS variants

n3DS - the New 3DS variants

A9LH - arm9loaderhax

CFW - Custom Firmware such as Luma3DS, used for unlocking full access (required to install backups/CIAs)

Exploit - Entrypoint for loading the homebrew launcher

Primary Exploit - An exploit which does not require additional hardware/software (can run with just the cart)

Secondary Exploit - Requires a prior exploit to run

CIAs - A file that when installed creates a channel on your Home Menu

People from all over the world sell their old hardware to put money towards upgrades.

The advantages to buying pre-owned are that you get a much better price and hardware that has already been tested. 

In the wake of the release of Nvidia and AMD's new cards, which will inevitably cause an influx of used parts, I'd like to guide you through getting the best price, and dealing safely.

To start, buying pre-owned is *NOT* risky if you know what you are doing. That's why I'm here to teach ya!

The first thing you need is a site to buy from...a *reputable!* site.

To get you started, here is a list of sites that are safe to deal on:

/r/hardwareswap 

www.ebay.com

www.outletpc.com

www.amazon.com

www.gpushack.com

http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/forum-8.html

Find which site has the best price and product for you.

Second, things you should look out for as a buyer:

1. Sellers accepting gift cards as payment

 This is unnecessarily risky. If the seller won't take PayPal, the risk is not worth the gain.

2. Too good to be true

 If an item is priced unusually low, almost suspiciously so, it is *most likely* a scam. An example of this would be a 970 for $100.

3. Sellers with no feedback

 Some sellers are legitimately trying to start out. Others are alts or bots trying to scam you. Refer back to rule one; a new seller only accepting gift cards or gift payments is a *scary* combo!

4.  Unverified PayPal

 Always check the verified status of a seller. Some scammers will take your money, empty it, and then delete their account.

Simply call PayPal and give them the seller's email. They'll let you know the status.

5. Erratic behavior

 Use your judgement. If a seller refuses to give you information about the item in question, or behaves in an odd way, go with your gut!

6. PayPal Gift payment

 Unless the seller is *highly* reputable, DON'T DO IT! Just don't.

Lastly, when you get your item, be sure to inspect it thoroughly and stress test it. 

Always take clear pictures while opening your packages. This will come in handy should a part be damaged.

Use these tools to stress test your components:

[CPU](http://www.mersenne.org/download/)

[GPU](http://www.ozone3d.net/benchmarks/fur/)

[RAM](http://www.memtest86.com/)

[HDDs and SSDs](http://crystalmark.info/software/CrystalDiskMark/index-e.html)

PSUs will usually not even start the computer if they are bad. If they do POST, they will usually fail when running a GPU or CPU burner.

Should something terrible happen and a part be DOA, fret not! Getting a refund is usually hassle-free.

Use these pages (depending on where you got your part):

[eBay](http://pages.ebay.com/help/account/contact-customer-support.html)

[/r/hardwareswap mods (for reporting)](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fhardwareswap)

Contact PayPal about getting a refund if you used HWS.

[Outlet PC](http://www.outletpc.com/rma.html)

[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/orc/returns/homepage.html/ref=orc_surl_ret_hp?fg=1)

[gpuShack](http://gpushack.com/pages/our-warranty)

Contact PayPal about receiving a refund if you use Toms.

[PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/security/buyer-protection-resolution)

That just about wraps it up! Hopefully this guides helps you guys on your quest for the best value!

How is this tanker still running you may wonder. I've attributed my PS3's long life to a simple trick:

The thing that causes the YLOD isn't the overheating itself. The YLOD is usually caused by the solder under the CPU and RSX cracking and separating. This makes the CPU/RSX unable to make contact with the motherboard.

The cracking is caused by physics. When something heats up it expands, and when something cools down it contracts. This constant expanding/contracting causes the cracking.

I've found a good way to subsidize this.

When you are done with a heavy gaming session, leave your PS3 on the XMB for 15-20 minutes. This allows your PS3 to slowly cool itself off at a rate that doesn't cause extreme contracting.

Once your fans have revved down and the system is running cooler, THEN turn off your system.

This doesn't mean don't clean your PS3 regularly and replace the paste(if need be), those things definitely help too.

May your PS3 live long and prosper!

""Customer came in yesterday and said he wanted this card in his PC, I picked it up this morning. Go ahead and install it please.""

I was happy to oblige.

We have a Steam account with some games on it for testing, so I installed those onto a shop HDD and fired 'em up.

This isn't an ""in-depth"" review. This is just some intel from a fellow masterracer.

The card is very easy to install. You just need an open 120mm fan bay and you'll be fine. The tubing is pretty damn long.

The card is definitely on the small side as well, perfect for SFF builds.

In my *personal* opinion, the card is kinda meh looking, especially under the hood.

I use Afterburner to measure temps and usage in the following situations.

(I cannot and will not overclock a customer's gear, don't expect OC results).

Temps:

At 100% load I saw the card peak at 60 C. This is very impressive and much better than I was expecting.

The frames:

In GTA V the card topped at 70 FPS at 1440p and 2x MSAA (everything Ultra).

That seems to be almost in-line with Guru3Ds findings.

The Witcher 3 topped out at 57 FPS with the following settings:

1440p

Ultra

AA on

8x AF

SSAO on

Hairworks off

Bioshock Infinite topped at 98 FPS with the following settings at 1440p:

Ultra with DDOD and FXAA on.

So who is this card for?

If you are a performance enthusiast who likes to bleed every last drop out of your card, get a 980 Ti. It has much more overclocking headroom and is much more versatile due to the fact that aftermarket coolers can be made.

The Fury loses out in the OC department thanks to locked voltages. Hopefully that will be fixed soon.

For the average consumer: The 980 Ti is still currently the best choice. It outperforms the Fury X as of right now (the exception being 4K, which is hardly the average).

For people playing at 4K or building an SFF box: The Fury X is your best bet. The AIO helps keep the heat off and it's size make sit great for sliding into tight spaces. The HBM helps boost 4K performance, and drivers will only help this in the future.
