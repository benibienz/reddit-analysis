22,"I'm a child care specialist. I work one on one with kids that have gotten in trouble with the law and have to live away from home. Basically here or jail. Most of them have mental issues. There's a cottage for girls who are emotionally unstable. There's one for boys who are lower functioning. And there's a few for the more ""hardened criminal"" type. Also at have a couple emergency shelter cottages for kids taken out of the home in a hurry. 

I love my job. Seeing the look on kids' faces when I tell them ""good job"" or point out something I'm proud of them for makes the shitty pay and annoying coworkers worth it. 

To top it off all my bosses are awesome. I'm friends with one of them outside of work. And the best/worst part about my job is I work third shift. That's the best because I only see the kids for approximately two to three hours a day at the max. I don't get so burned out by the constant fighting, cussing out, threats to your life, as all the other shifts do. I run a small ""business"" at home and I get to work on my products all night long while they sleep. I get a lot of shit done and I get paid to get paid. 

It's the worst because third shift sucks. It's hard on your body. Vitamin D deficiency, circadian rhythm irregularities, etc. But I'm not sure I could ever handle the stress of working a day shift. ",2016-05-17 08:15:49+00:00,d38kffr,1.0,t3_4jkl5o,77451.0,AskReddit

But when I was about seventeen, I started a new medication for my bipolar disorder and it made me gain 100lbs in less than six months. Ever since then I've been fighting to lose at least a little. I lost some on a diet but gained it all back and more. I am now so big I can't find clothes my size except at specialty stores and I can't even tie my own goddamn shoes. 

The worst part is I have body dimorphic disorder and it's centered around my weight. So I deal with a lot of terrible thoughts.
