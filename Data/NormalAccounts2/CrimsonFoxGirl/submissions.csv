I really haven't had a manic episode either. At least not a full blown one. But I'm depressed. 

I sleep at least 14 hours a day usually more. When I wake up I'm sore and tired. I cry at the most random times for no reason. I cry all the time, really. I always take a two hour nap before work and still I have to take caffeine pills to stay awake. My house is a mess. I can't bring myself to clean. The only reason I shower or do my hair is because my husband makes me. On my days off I never change out of my pajamas. I never want to go anywhere. I'm terrified. 

I take 150mg of pristiq which is the max dose and I take a large amount of welbutrin as well. I also take Depakote, Buspar, abilify, Haldol, kolonopin as needed, zertec, synthroid, omneprozole, Lyrica, and naproxen. 

So I don't think upping the dose of my anti depressants is going to help since we've been doing that for a long time now. I've heard people talk about stimulants on here? I've never taken any and I wonder if that may be a way for me to go? I don't know. I'm nervous to try something new but... I'm getting desperate. I thought of suicide today and I've been thinking of self harm all week.

When I got back from my honeymoon I discovered they don't carry any of those colors locally. Much to my dismay, I went online in a search for my yarn. I can buy one of them on Walmart.com of and one on Joanns.com but the only place I can find the forest Heather is on amazon and it's over six dollars a roll. I just can't believe that's the best I can do.
