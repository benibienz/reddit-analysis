18,"This is so stupid and biased. The kid was fucking pointing the damn gun at people in the park and you can tell from the person calling the police that he/she was scared and felt very threatened. This isn't someone flaunting the second amendment. I find it ironic that most of these ""cop killers"" involve the ""victim"" doing something EXTREMELY illegal to begin with. It doesn't help reaching toward your waist when the cops know very much so that you are armed. Yes the cops came too close and yes they could have played the situation better but COME ON KID! He should not be playing with a gun spray painted black pointing it at people without thinking that maybe just maybe something bad can happen.

23,Ya I'm not believing this story one bit. Sure you may have been raped but I highly highly highly doubt that that case was thrown out for just what the supposed attacker stated . If that was the case and your lawyer had half a brain you could've taken that to the media and raised hell maybe even sue the judge? Not sure if that's possible but just saying.

24,"You can't compare plane crashes to false accusations of rape. That's like comparing rape victims to cancer. ""Oh it could happen to any of us but the likelihood of getting it is slim"" imagine saying that to a feminist. They would lose their shit. Why should I have my life ruined when someone is obviously lying about something that never even happened? It happens a lot more often than you think. I'm sure it's a lot more than actual rape cases. It disgusts me that something hasn't been done about it because we're ""men"" and women can never wrong or deceitful in the eyes of the court.

25,Pretty fucking often. I'm serious. I myself have been wrongfully accused of rape and had it blown out of proportion when in reality this female just cried rape because she cheated on her boyfriend with me and wanted a way to get him back. Girls do this shit all the time without thinking how it affects the victims. I know 2 other friends in my lifetime that have at one point been accused. That's 3 people counting myself that I know of. That's a scary high number. ,2015-12-15 00:04:04+00:00,cxz99xq,3,t1_cxypwxb,30630,AskReddit

31,"This may be the case sometimes but most of the time from what I have seen, the white upper middle class males tend to be more obedient when stopped by officers or when they raid a party etc. What happens a lot in these cases is black people over the years have gotten this sense of ""fuck authority"" attitude and will deliberately defy the requests of police which result in shootings, beat downs, and really unneeded violence. I grew up around rich white kids and transferred to a predominantly black public school and from what I can tell my hypothesis holds true. Richer kids will dress nicer (which police may use in their heads before even talking to the child as a determination of is this kid going to give me a hard time) and be more respectful as well as tell the truth. You don't get that from the more underprivileged kids and it just so happens those kids tend to be black.  Not anything ""racist"" about it just facts.
