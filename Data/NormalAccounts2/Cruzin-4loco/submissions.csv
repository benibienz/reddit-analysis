I leave for bootcamp in September and will miss the general election and the months leading up to it. Will the polls in September be accurate enough to assume the winner? ,The_Donald,General election,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4p98ue/general_election/

So basically someone hacked my girlfriends Twitter and she used the same password for Instagram and her other social media so they had access to all of her information and posted some sexually explicit photos (of me) I'm a male and note also minor as well as she is. So basically my girlfriend noticed it but it was too late. So many people now have screenshots of me off her account and have been showing people and it's been pretty hectic the last 2 days. they made the picture her header as well as tweeted the photo numerous times. I found out that Twitter keeps a record of all the IPs that log into the account and I went on her account and checked for my ip and hers and then noticed two Unidentified ones. I found the one that accessed her account the minute it was posted so I knew it was this one. The other ip was blocked as numerous websites were giving me weird locations(like the middle of the ocean) so I assume they were using a proxy/Vpn. Again I'm not a computer genius but I think that's correct. Well anyways, this one particular ip I can see their ISP from it as Well as where their city is.(it's the same as my city and the pictures were of me so I can safely assume it's someone we know) is there any other way to proceed with this. I want to find out specifically who it was as Well as possibly take action legally against them. Especially since we are both under aged. Thank you for reading and If I should post this somewhere else please tell me and I will move it thanks. ",Advice,Need some sort of help please.
