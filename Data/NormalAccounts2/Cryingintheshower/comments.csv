A good way of killing two birds with one stone is editing some dailies(get already shot footage in a sequence and see how it plays ) this is also a good way to both kill the time between shoots and learn some rudimentary editing skills. 
Perhaps your cast will find their zing back when seeing how the film is panning out. 
With regards to editing itself. I see it this way. You script the film you have in your head, then out of the fray of shooting you get another that you will discover in the edit.  Rarely you get a film by just putting your shots in sequence as how they were in the storyboard. Editing is not a nightmare,  but a huge creative jigsaw with multiple solutions.

For what they do they do it very well. Teaching and entertaining. The videos they make professionally and that we see are nice enough, but that is besides the point. I want them to be good at teaching and entertaining, that is why I watch some of them.

Granted, 50% of the stuff most of them talk about is irrelevant and too specific. But I do learn from some of their reviews whether equipment is any good to work with. Mostly ergonomics wise.

Alot of us have started out with DSLRs and simple handycams. And now you have the natural progression of growing out of that, but our 'teachers' are still in that niche.

So in case of a server crash we lose a day. In case of catastrophic fire, we lose a week. 
Raw footage is always backuped of site immediately after the shoot. 
Having just the premiere files in a cloud folder messes up our organization of projects.
Bottom line is, get lots of hard drives and automate the backup system so you never miss a day.",2015-07-22 21:32:29+00:00,ctcm2cf,1,t3_3e8f5z,7630,Filmmakers

A DSLR is just as easy to point, but has some higher useful ISO (sensitivity)  so you can get away with a darker set (and work a tiny bit faster). The BMPCC is a freakishly good camera that needs good lighting.
Bottom line is, if you like the look of a situation/framing, add a light that amplifies that light source and you'll be fine for your first short film.
