At the moment we are doing illustrations in Illustrator (because i'm fast in it) and then grouping elements that are together, separate the layers (with ""Build sequence"") and then importing it in AE as composition layers. But now if i wanted to add some textures to it, i cant change my ILL files because the dimensions and anchor points will change. This is the [storyboard](https://reddit-uploaded-media.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/images%2Ft2_8ava6%2Fbdz0r8yx64jx) i made for this next animation btw.

Should i use photoshop as an entrypoint towards AE or design directly in AE? Am i the only one doing it this way?

I know how to do it my way, but is this a stupid workflow?

 First night i hide in a 2m hole in the ground with a block of cabin wood above me in a burned out forest. Creepy fuckers waking around but no one noticed me. Had to punch my way out because my shovel broke. 

Second night i dug a hole on the waterfront and coward in that for 2 nights. Did ok, bit of hunting killed a bear. That thing took like 25 damn arrows to the face.  Found a house, build a little room on the roof, started to expand it, second floor, forge. And on the eve of the sixth day it starts. Fucking thunder. Loud thunder. 
I was already aware of changing weather because of the freak snowstorm that happened the day before, but this was new. 
I don't know who did the sound effects for this game but that rain and thunder stuff in the middle of the night with day 7 coming up is hair raising creepy. 
I had surrounded the broken down house with three layers of spikes, a 2m ditch with spikes and an earthen wall. Internally i reinforced the wooden house with some cobblestone pillars. Hopefully when they do get in, the zombies won't cause a collapse immediately. 
Day 7 arrives. The three layer spikes are gone in 10 seconds, the ditch overrun in 5 and now they are eating away at the foundations of my makeshift treehouse on a house. The roof has already collapsed into the second floor and i hear them punching the cobblestone pillars.
All the while i have the most unsettling thunder in my headphones.

Every time also something different. Just now, the derailleur (the mechanical shifting thing) broke off. I've also had the little mounting bracket of the thing broken in half. The wheels have been completely been replaced once. I'm on my third seat and third rotating handlebar shifter. The handles themselves also seem to go loose and crappy after about three months. I've lost about three pairs of pedals also. 
Kind of fed up with the whole thing. 

I cycle 1 hour every day (30 min commute) in all weather. Anyone got something build like a tank that they can recommend? 

The broken one is a folding mountain bike by dahon (i understand that the hardware might be under par to begin with, but there is not a single original part on it now apart from the frame ).

But our server/sharing work solution is not perfect/fast enough. We are using a striped nas that is being backed up every evening that we share through a gigabit switch over 4 computers. But what i read recently is that gigabit networks are limited to about 150mb per sec of data transfer.  Well.... with a couple of 4k files in a multicam we reach this limit fast and get jittery playback. 

What would be a good solution that you guys are using over multiple users? I was thinking of connecting a raid 5 housing to the imac that needs it the most and have other users connect to that one and share the data. That way the first imac has 450mb+ rates and the others 150mb max or something. 

Upgrading to a 10 gigabit switch is very expensive I'm finding out slowly. That would be ideal ofcourse . 

In short, I've been disappointed by the bottleneck a nas has by sharing it over a gigabit switch and was not aware of this before buying it. I'm a filmmaker, not an IT guy dammit!

Since it was the only take of the day and the only one of the commercial we decided to shoot 4K RAW (as you would).
The take consisted of a short walk towards the talent, hold behind the talent for 2 minutes (graphics would be superimposed) and a push in towards the screen for a pay off.

Now, what we and the rental house (a well respected one) did not know is that the bloody camera will drop frames randomly in bunches of 5-30 in longer takes!
We used the SSDs black magic themselves recommend so they should be fast enough.

First hint was that playback did not work. Thing is that if your clip has dropped frames, the playback will halt at the point where the dropped frames are (good way of checking in the future if you have them).
Of course the rental house and the DP were shocked that that could happen and started checking other BMPC owners if they also encountered the problem. Apparently one even had their camera returned 4 times and still had the issue. 

So, if shooting with those things, we wary of dropping frames when shooting 4K RAW (as you would want to do with the thing).

We managed to save the shots because most of the problems were in the moments were the camera was mostly stationary.
