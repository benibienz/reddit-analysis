16,"&gt; You don't wanna manufacture in America? Okay that's fine but here's a tax to make up for the money you won't be putting into our economy

I've always wondered what would happen if, instead of a tax, we came up with some way of limiting how much a company could sell in the country. Some sort of ratio related to salaries in country. For example, Nike spends (let's say) $3B on American salaries, then they would be allowed to sell some multiplier like 3x that amount or $9B in America. Also drop this requirement for any company that manufactures completely in the USA. Give made in USA a competitive advantage, instead of the current disadvantage. 

Nike knows going into 2017 that they can only sell 3x their wages before the dockworkers turn the boats around (which they would fucking love, I'm sure), so they raise salaries so they can sell more, or they give out year end bonuses to get above the cap.

The IRS would love this deal too since Nike, and every other company would have to report all their wages to get their sales numbers higher, so it would be easy to spot discrepancies come filing time.

Sure it'd lead to a black market, but that would in turn create a lot of jobs.

I dunno, just seems like it makes too much sense.",2016-11-14 17:16:23+00:00,da00a08,4.0,t1_d9zt4gn,9982.0,technology

There's also a few football players that would probably translate well. Johnny Manziel is an undersized quarterback, but he'd be a good height for soccer. His shiftiness and creativity would make him a pain to defend. Cam Newton is a great all around athlete with tons of size, he'd probably fall into that Lebron zone though where his size doesn't really help all that much, I think those two would be better suited to being CBs or maybe goalkeepers with their good hands. 

The NFL has a treasure trove of guys who can just flat out sprint, so we'd never have a shortage of wingers.

Running backs are generally just too bulky and powerful to able to play a 90 minute game, but just yesterday I passed Christian McCaffrey on the sidewalk and that dude has a lower body like I'd never seen.

Damn this just gave me a good idea. The stadium/team should just auction all the seats for like a month in two or four seats chunks or whatever, with the auctions ending maybe 48 hours before the game so they cut out scalpers (I'm looking at you Stubhub). That way they sell at market price, everyone has a chance to buy, and it would all be transparent. The only downside I can think of is accommodations and transport.

If the postmen, school teachers, single parents etc. can't compete anymore, there's always jobs in Sacramento or Fresno or Santa Rosa. 

My point is, it seems like people are out of touch with the reality that the bay is a super desirable market, and the street art portrays the people moving in as thieves to their neighborhood, but really they just represent a shifting of what is the ""working class"" in the bay. 

I personally blame real estate investors for inflating the prices everywhere. There should be a limit on how many properties you own, especially if you're not an American citizen. Every foreigner that owns five houses in the bay is taking away five houses off the market from the people portrayed in the street art. They're the real source of the problem.

272,"Well I've never played the Madden ultimate team, but FIFA is pretty cool since they link by nationalities and leagues and teams they play for. So there's endless possibilities with making a squad. I've heard that Madden has too many good players, but on FIFA it's somewhat difficult to get a team full of studs. 

Cfb lends itself to UT better than Madden because if they have team of the week, you would get slightly upgraded cards throughout the season, and there's a pretty large gap between the best and worst players, plus a huge player pool in college. Packs of college players would probably be a lot more varied than Madden packs, and thus getting a, say, Derrick Henry card would be huge upgrade to your team.

There's also better possibilities for end of season upgraded cards, as they could issue ""all conference"" cards at the end of the season, whereas Madden probably just does all pro. So there's less. 

I'm not sure if Madden does this, but they could issue ""playcall"" cards that you have to collect to build a playbook, etc. Uniforms cards would also be cool.
