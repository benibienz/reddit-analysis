I switched off between the 7.5k gold packs and the 7.5k jumbo silvers. Here are the amazing results counting down from 1,000,000 coins:

* 981k TOTS Alli! Third pack in and we're off to a flyer! 
* 939k TOTS Propper. Looks okay I guess.  
* 887k TOTS Ozil! We've already made a profit boys! Going to sell him later (maybe during Bundesliga TOTS) as I already packed an untradeable KO Ozil which is a better card. Checked his value and its hovering around 2.4 million!! 
* 741k IF Maxwell. Second IF I believe. Nice all around stats, I'll add that one to the collection.
* 633k TOTS (Silver) Kabasele!! Yessss I was hoping to nab at least one silver TOTS as they fetch a nice amount. After the pack opening I instasold this guy for 2.15M coins!
* 511k Silver IF Younes. Looks shit, but will probably sell later on
* 393k Another TOTS Alli. Added to the transfer list to sell later on
* 301k TOTS Gray! What a beastly League striker! 94 pace, 87 shooting, 84 physical. Too bad he probably won't sell for much. I'll probably hang on to this one for an England squad.
* 282k Silver TOTS Christie! Alright I bagged two silvers. I sold him off for 750k after the opening as I didn't want his value to drop off in the coming days. 

Pretty damn good for 770k, I nearly quadrupled my coins, and I still have Ozil and Alli to sell. Go open some packs boys and don't neglect the silvers!

Player #1:

This NIF was a product of the Southampton academy and has his own token celebration on Fifa. 

Player #2:

This position change SIF card switched from a BPL club to a Bundesliga club during the January window.

Player #3:

This TOTS card was the second blue card packed by Spencer during his Zarate kid series. 

Player #4:

This Serie A IF card played at Envigado, Boca Juniors, St. Etienne, and Porto before joining his current club.

Player #5:

This SIF card famously switched allegiances with regards to his national team. Lately he's been banging in goals in the BPL.
