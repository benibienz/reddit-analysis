12,"Another similar tip - The number 3 will also deposit your inventory when using a deposit box (number 5 will deposit the familiar's too, which is useful for buying from stores in bulk).",2016-04-05 20:06:49+00:00,d1r5bqt,2,t1_d1qyq29,8114,runescape
13,"Honestly another good focus before getting all of those things unlocked is to get a full ring of kinship upgrade to finish the Demonheim hard tasks.  The reason to prioritize it is cause it costs around 300k tokens, and you get one free reset of the ring to refund all the tokens. So, get the upgrade, finish the task, then you can buy anything you want.  It's better to get the tasks finished early, since the extra teleport you unlock from elite's helps out a lot in the end.",2016-04-05 20:01:35+00:00,d1r52br,3,t1_d1r2873,3470,runescape

16,"Glad to see you joining the community of ironman!

For early level's you can buy seeds from Olivia in Draynor, that will give you access to some decently low level seeds. Beyond that, you will want to just plant basically any seeds you can get your hands on, most of which should be coming from slayer.

For higher levels, consistently buying the pineapple trees from Priff is the easy way to go.  Also, killing aquanites can give some seeds as well.  After those two things, gano's once you get 95 slayer is the next best thing.  In general though, for almost all levels, slayer is the best way to collect seeds.",2015-10-30 15:27:41+00:00,cwifncp,1,t3_3quie0,1109,runescape
