82,"I would honestly completely disagree with you. I have played probably 500 hours of league, and around 1500 hours of dota so I have played both games. This being said, I would say the most complex champion in the game (Obviously subjective) would be Syndra, with regard to her throwing of creeps, and things like that. In DoTA, not only is there a hero similar to Syndra, but also more complex named earth spirit. He uses a system similar to the orb system, but his ultimate is FAR more complex than anything Syndra has to offer. When Earth Spirit uses his ultimate, it magnetizes all of the heroes around him. If an orb is near one of the people with the ultimate effect on them, it reapplies the buffs duration on everyone. If any person is magnetized, and one of them is silenced by earth spirit, they are all silenced. If one person is slowed by earth spirit, they are all slowed. Another example of complexity within DoTA is Invoker. He has four base abilties, quas, wex, and exort. Whenever you use one of the first three, you apply a buff to yourself depending on which you use, for example one of them gives damage, whereas another gives regen. You can have three orbs active at the same time, and they last until you change them. Depending on the orbs you have currently on, when you use exort you will gain an ability unique to the combination you have on. For example, quas quas quas is one ability, whereas quas wex exort is another. The abilities he has range from summoning fire spirits to help him, to making meteors fall from the sky.

I understand it sucks that there was trouble with the battlecup, but compared to problems that LoL has and other games have to deal with, DoTA is fucking perfect.

Just because he fell into ownership of a part of a company doesn't mean he is personally acting with the same intent as the owners themselves. For example, someone may pay another person with stock, this stock could be of a bad company. Just because the person was paid the stock of the bad company doesn't mean they are scheming with the board of directors. ",2016-07-04 12:56:16+00:00,d4yq47y,1,t3_4r5c44,33830,GlobalOffensive

101,"1) Not really sure for this one man, try and google it, you should find something.


2) The max level is 100 now I believe, and once you play around 120-ish games you can start playing ranked. 


2A) MMR (Matchmaking Rating) in DotA is done in a number system, so when you get ranked, you will be assigned a number. The highest people in ranked gameplay have around 8,000 MMR, and that number is constantly pushed up. Low MMR is around 2,500-ish.





3) Play some games, and see what you like. I recommend when you get in your first games to click the small book in the top left corner, there should be a list of guides to the hero you picked, including item, and level progression. I recommend find a build by Torte de Lini, he has great builds that try and lay out the position the hero is in in the current patch, aswell as giving a brief overview of the hero as a whole. Of course you don't need to follow the builds, but they help to explain each hero when you're unfamiliar to the game.



I recommend you check out these resources as well.
