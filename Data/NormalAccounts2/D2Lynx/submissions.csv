If they just added a feature that most people don't like at first, many would just disable it and not give feedback. By making it undisableable for a short amount of time, they're making it possible for us to give feedback, rather than just disable them and never think about them.

For example, just with regard to how the game is going to make money post release I think very few people in the skins current state would purchase the chests. The skins themselves are interesting at best, and could really use some work. There is also the separate issue of the chest system all together in that, even in Overwatch very few people buy the chests because you'll just earn all the skins anyways. This is especially prevalent in Battlerite as the chests are MUCH easier to earn with daily quests, hero leveling and buying them from wins.
