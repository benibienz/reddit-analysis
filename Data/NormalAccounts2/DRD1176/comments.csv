However, I hear and respect the point(s) that you are making here and appreciate you making them as they give me plenty to R &amp; D for myself and hopefully anyone else here or otherwise to look at and come to a conscience and invaluable personal decision to their daily lives and that of the ones that they care about and hold dear.

The ""chase"" was at low-speed, and both these cops had her cornered from the jump! Front bumper and rear corner and quarter panel of her car, then she had a small but deep ditch to her rear and rear driver side with a telephone poll just to the rear and left. 

Where and what prey tell makes you think that she is gonna use a car for a weapon? Was that before or after the ""chase,"" started? The post also intimated that the chase began in a hotel parking lot. 

Why didn't the officer who came up on her there stop her in her tracks then and their? I respect your thoughts, but I don't agree. This woman never hurt anyone, BUT her self, really. 

Family's gone from her life, her ex-husband removed himself and their child from the home and her life entirely. Family had little to nothing to do with her because of repeated drug and alcohol abuse. She lost her job, her car, and her home.
