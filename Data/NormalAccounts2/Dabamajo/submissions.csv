So to begin with this is my first PC build and it went swimmingly until I woke up the day after I built it and almost all games would run at 60fps, but would drop constantly. This happens almost exactly every second.

After some searching I thought I solved it by uninstalling GeForce experience, HD Audio drivers and 3D Vision (by this time I spent almost the entire day searching for answers). This fixed it and it has been running perfectly until after I came home from work today and now it does its usual routine of dropping frames every second. I should also mention that on the first day I was running Far Cry 3, Borderlands 2, Skyrim and Saints Row 3+4 perfectly on max graphics, but it still doesn't work if I lower the graphics settings to the minimum. 

Strangely enough through all of this Far Cry 3 has been the only AAA game that doesn't drop frames. Unity and Unreal work perfectly as well as all other non-AAA/ smaller games (e.g. Hotline Miami, Binding of Isaac, etc.) if this helps.

Thanks in advance :)

P.S. To any Australians that are wondering more about this build I purchased all of these parts from TechBuy because they were the supplier I could find that were cheap, had all the parts and accepted PayPal.",buildapc,FPS Jitter with Intel i5-4690S and GTX 960 2GB[Troubleshooting],https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/3nb94j/fps_jitter_with_intel_i54690s_and_gtx_960/
