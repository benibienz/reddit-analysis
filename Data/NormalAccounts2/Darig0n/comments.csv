134,I do believe it is Dynamic enough to be apart of a sleeve granted being Mario / Bowser themed. Where I would get it would be on my upperarm / deltoid area. I was thinking worst case scenario it can become astract and it could be the logo that appears on the Bowser Airship. I also edited it in onto a Bowser shell logo in photoshop. Let me know your opinion when I'm available to upload it. I always enjoy a good critique.,2015-09-12 16:15:30+00:00,cuz2q6r,2,t1_cuz1tr9,1670,tattoos
