31,"I, personally, think they may go with some of the events in the Death of Wolverine. They could easily do that story with Logan as an old man. The premise could be that Mr. Sinister uses several mutants to hunt down Wolverine, one of these could be Nuke and X-23. And maybe X-23 decides to stick with Logan instead of killing him. Somehow, they'll involve Professor X in this, so maybe Professor X is being mind controlled by Sinister. And he ends up leading Logan into Sinister's trap. So then Sinister does whatever with Logan and will probably end up killing him. 

Hopefully, they do it like in the Death of Wolverine comic, and cover Logan in liquid adamantium, to finish him off. I have a feeling this could very well be the direction they go, as we already know x-23 will be in it as well as Mr. sinister, or at least a form of those characters.

And really clearly state, that the center piece of all the films is the Chosen One, which is pretty much just the embodiment of the Force.
