I only use my pc for gaming and browsing the web, so I'm somewhat stuck on what to do here. I plan to just really install my os on the m.2 and probably, that's where I'll install all my drivers and programs as well. Good idea, yes or no?

And I'll probably install a couple games on it. But for my other games, I don't know if I should buy a 7200 rpm hdd, and just keep them on there. Or if I should just buy an internal 250 gb ssd. The only thing that I'm not sure on, is if I game on the internal ssd, is that it's life expectancy will decrease a lot, compared to storing them on the hdd. So is the performance going to matter that much? I'm don't want to kill the ssd, since I game a lot.

I'm looking to sell this for $70.

This is a custom set which I modeled in Lego Digital Designer and ordered the pieces. It's modeled after Man Bat's Lab. I've decided to let it go to a new owner.

The Bat-Copter and Batpod are not my creation, I just added them from other sets. But the building is the part I made. The set has a few play features to make it feel similar to a Lego set.

The wall on the side, can fall apart when the top brick is removed. This is to simulate Man Bat breaking out, and the same goes for the break away window which pops out by pushing on the tile. And anyone familiar with the stairs know they rotate around.

84,2016-07-04 23:20:05+00:00,self.RewritingThePrequels,https://www.reddit.com/r/RewritingThePrequels/comments/4r9tt2/my_revision_of_the_star_wars_prequels/,False,"This is a write up I submitted to fixing movies, but I wanted to re-share it on this subreddit. 

I know they're are many people who love the prequel trilogy, and I happen to appreciate them very much, but we all know they're some definite issues. Especially around the story. So these are some of my ideas on how to improve them.

For one, I think you could pull it off in two films. So the major change would be that of Anakin's character. Instead of having him be a spoiled teenager, have him be a very respected general in the clone wars. Start the first film with him already being established as a strong force user and a respected general in the clone army. I want him to be portrayed much like he is in the 2003 Clone-Wars cartoon.

Also his and Obi-Wan's relationship is very strong. Obi-Wan is still his mentor, but they have much more of a bro-mance in the films. They tease and fool with each-other. They both respect each-other, and Obi-Wan has much faith in Anakin. But whenever they're assigned a mission, they are on task and get the job done.
Now as far as Anakin's and Padme's relationship goes, they do not meet as children. Anakin meets Padme whenever he is assigned as her bodyguard. they soon develop, a CONVINCING and BELIEVABLE, love for each-other. Anakin loves her with all his heart.

During one scene, he explains that he loves her because no one has ever cared for him the way she has. He's never been treated with such hospitality and such love. That is why he loves her. All Anakin has ever known before is the Jedi way, and now he's met a woman and falls for her. He's never felt happiness and he feels it with Padme. He doesn't want to loose that feeling. So whenever he begins to have visions of her death, he is willing to do anything to prevent that from becoming reality.

so one of the major elements for this story to work is I want the audience to believe Anakin really believes in the Dark Side. In the prequels his transition is so rushed and doesn't really feel like he actually believes in the Dark Side. So in my first film, I'd want to have Anakin be befriended by Palpetine. as in the prequel films, Palpatine realizes Anakin's power and wants him to become his apprentice.

So gradually, Palpatine tells Anakin the powers of the Dark Side. He will also tell him the story of Darth Plageius the Wise. Anakin begins to explore the depths of the Dark Side way. He finds holocrons and is exposed to the teachings of the Dark Side. Palpatine offers him the chance to learn even more about the Dark Side. Intrigued by this new power, Anakin accepts. Anakin soon becomes a believer of the Dark Side way.

All he ever knew before was the Jedi way, now he has been exposed to this new view on the Force. And Anakin explains how he really believes the Dark side is much more efficient since you can sue the Force to its potential. And he starts to convince himself the Jedi are cowards and are ignorant to not use the Force to its full potential.
So at some point during the second film Anakin becomes a full Dark side user. But, while believing in the Dark side, he still is friends with Obi-Wan. He is like his brother to him.

Yoda begins to sense something wrong with Anakin and becomes suspicious of Palpatine and Anakin's association with one another. This is when the Jedi-council ask Anakin to spy on Palpatine and Anakin starts to lose faith in the Jedi and Republic even more so.

So after Anakin saves Palpatine from Windu, Sidious grants Anakin the title of Darth Vader. This is when Anakin is granted a new lightsaber with a crimson kyber crystal, to represent his full transition to the Dark side.
And at one point, Anakin has a conversation with Padme, in which he gives her his old lightsaber and asks her to give it to their new son. Padme becomes worried about Anakin.

Once Sidious commences Order 66, it plays out the same way it did in the prequels. Once Padme finds Anakin on Mustafar, she explains how he has hurt her and is not the same man she once loved. Anakin is sad to hear this, but at the same time, he is angry. He explains how everything he has done has been for her. All he ever did was love her. Padme begins to fear for her life as she sees the hate grow in Anakin's eyes, she pulls out a knife in self- defense. Anakin force-chokes her and Obi-Wan intercedes to stop him.

Anakin calms down and then him and Obi-Wan have a conversation about their differences. Anakin tries to explain to Obi-Wan why he feels the way he does about the Dark Side. And how this is what he really believes in, and how the Jedi are naive to not use the Force properly. Anakin is reluctant to kill Obi-Wan, as he knows he has been ordered to. Since they have been friends for so long, Anakin offers Obi-Wan the chance to join him to rule the Galaxy. And that if he doesn't accept, he will have to kill him. Anakin doesn't want to, but he offers him the chance, for his own self conscience. Just so he doesn't feel guilty for having to kill his best-friend.

Of course, Obi-Wan does not accept and is insulted that Anakin would think he would join him. Then they duel, just as they did in ROTS. But Anakin uses his red saber in their duel.

During childbirth, the last thing Padme tells Obi-Wan is that Anakin wanted his lightsaber to be given to Luke. She then dies, and at this same time, Anakin, as Vader, tears off the restraints and falls to his knees. He does not scream, ""NOOOO,"" he only breaths heavily. He also tears the entire room apart with the Force, while on his knees.
Well, that was my attempt at fixing the prequels. I'd love to hear what you all think below. Thanks.

EDIT: I also remembered that I would like to implement Count Dooku and Darth Maul in the films as well. I think this would be a chance to give Maul more spotlight. And I also wanted to add that the medical bay Vader destroys gets #rekt m8 instead of just wrecked.

EDIT 2: A user by the name of Speterius had mentioned this, which I think would be a great addition for Anakin's transition to the Dark side.
I would also add more reason for Anakin to despise the Jedi council. For example have the Jedi masters find out about Padme and her being pregnant and doing something radical about it.

Especially around the story.

So these are some of my ideas on how to improve them. 

For one, I think you could pull it off in two films. So the major change would be that of Anakin's character. Instead of having him be a spoiled teenager, have him be a very respected general in the clone wars. Start the first film with him already being established as a strong force user and a respected general in the clone army. I want him to be portrayed much like he is in the 2003 Clone-Wars cartoon.

Also his and Obi-Wan's relationship is very strong. Obi-Wan is still his mentor, but they have much more of a bro-mance in the films. They tease and fool with each-other. They both respect each-other, and Obi-Wan has much faith in Anakin. But whenever they're assigned a mission, they are on task and get the job done.

Now as far as Anakin's and Padme's relationship goes, they do not meet as children. Anakin meets Padme whenever he is assigned as her bodyguard. they soon develop, a CONVINCING and BELIEVABLE, love for each-other. Anakin loves her with all his heart. 

During one scene, he explains that he loves her because no one has ever cared for him the way she has. He's never been treated with such hospitality and such love. That is why he loves her. All Anakin has ever known before is the Jedi way, and now he's met a woman and falls for her. He's never felt happiness and he feels it with Padme. He doesn't want to loose that feeling. So whenever he begins to have visions of her death, he is willing to do anything to prevent that from becoming reality.   

so one of the major elements for this story to work is I want the audience to believe Anakin really believes in the Dark Side. In the prequels his transition is so rushed and doesn't really feel like he actually believes in the Dark Side. So in my first film, I'd want to have Anakin be befriended by Palpetine. as in the prequel films, Palpatine realizes Anakin's power and wants him to become his apprentice.

So gradually, Palpatine tells Anakin the powers of the Dark Side. He will also tell him the story of Darth Plageius the Wise. Anakin begins to explore the depths of the Dark Side way. He finds holocrons and is exposed to the teachings of the Dark Side. Palpatine offers him the chance to learn even more about the Dark Side. Intrigued by this new power, Anakin accepts. Anakin soon becomes a believer of the Dark Side way. 

All he ever knew before was the Jedi way, now he has been exposed to this new view on the Force. And Anakin explains how he really believes the Dark side is much more efficient since you can sue the Force to its potential. And he starts to convince himself the Jedi are cowards and are ignorant to not use the Force to its full potential.

So at some point during the second film Anakin becomes a full Dark side user. But, while believing in the Dark side, he still is friends with Obi-Wan. He is like his brother to him. 

Yoda begins to sense something wrong with Anakin and becomes suspicious of Palpatine and Anakin's association with one another. This is when the Jedi-council ask Anakin to spy on Palpatine and Anakin starts to lose faith in the Jedi and Republic even more so. 

So after Anakin saves Palpatine from Windu, Sidious grants Anakin the title of Darth Vader. This is when Anakin is granted a new lightsaber with a crimson kyber crystal, to represent his full transition to the Dark side. 

And at one point, Anakin has a conversation with Padme, in which he gives her his old lightsaber and asks her to give it to their new son. Padme becomes worried about Anakin.

Once Sidious commences Order 66, it plays out the same way it did in the prequels. Once Padme finds Anakin on Mustafar, she explains how he has hurt her and is not the same man she once loved. Anakin is sad to hear this, but at the same time, he is angry. He explains how everything he has done has been for her. All he ever did was love her. Padme begins to fear for her life as she sees the hate grow in Anakin's eyes, she pulls out a knife in self- defense. Anakin force-chokes her and Obi-Wan intercedes to stop him. 

Anakin calms down and then him and Obi-Wan have a conversation about their differences. Anakin tries to explain to Obi-Wan why he feels the way he does about the Dark Side. And how this is what he really believes in, and how the Jedi are naive to not use the Force properly. Anakin is reluctant to kill Obi-Wan, as he knows he has been ordered to. Since they have been friends for so long, Anakin offers Obi-Wan the chance to join him to rule the Galaxy. And that if he doesn't accept, he will have to kill him. Anakin doesn't want to, but he offers him the chance, for his own self conscience. Just so he doesn't feel guilty for having to kill his best-friend. 

Of course, Obi-Wan does not accept and is insulted that Anakin would think he would join him. Then they duel, just as they did in ROTS. But Anakin uses his red saber in their duel. 

During childbirth, the last thing Padme tells Obi-Wan is that Anakin wanted his lightsaber to be given to Luke. She then dies, and at this same time, Anakin, as Vader, tears off the restraints and falls to his knees. He does not scream, ""NOOOO,"" he only breaths heavily. He also tears the entire room apart with the Force, while on his knees. 

Well, that was my attempt at fixing the prequels. I'd love to hear what you all think below. Thanks.

EDIT: I also remembered that I would like to implement Count Dooku and Darth Maul in the films as well. I think this would be a chance to give Maul more spotlight. And I also wanted to add that the medical bay Vader destroys gets #rekt m8 instead of just wrecked. 

EDIT 2: A user by the name of Speterius had mentioned this, which I think would be a great addition for Anakin's transition to the Dark side.
&gt;I would also add more reason for Anakin to despise the Jedi council. For example have the Jedi masters find out about Padme and her being pregnant and doing something radical about it.

My take on this would be for when the council discovers Padme's pregnancy, they have to demote Anakin or maybe even remove him from the council. This would add to Anakin's animosity towards the council since they would not allow him to be with her and stay a member.",fixingmovies,Fixing the Star Wars prequel trilogy story,https://www.reddit.com/r/fixingmovies/comments/4kjrqf/fixing_the_star_wars_prequel_trilogy_story/
92,2016-05-22 17:43:13+00:00,self.fixingmovies,https://www.reddit.com/r/fixingmovies/comments/4kjl0p/fixing_batman_v_superman_conflict/,False,"As many fans are aware Batman v Superman has some major issues. One of the primary ones begin that Superman wasn't really given enough reason to want to fight Batman. And here I am going to give you my attempt at how they could have fixed the issue.

The scene takes place during where Batman is stealing the kyrptonite from the Lex Corp truck. 

So instead of having Batman and Superman exchange two lines during this scene, this is when they could have taken the opportunity to establish the character's main points of view. 

So after Batman rams Superman with he batmobile, Superman tears the doors off and they exchange conversation about their differences. And Batman attempts to strike Superman but is thrown into the wall next to them. Superman explains how he knows Bruce is smarter than that.

Batman then violently explains how he witnessed people die during his and Zod's fight. He explains how no man should posses the power Superman has. Superman's response is that he may posses that power but he's using it for good. And that his goal is to keep the people of the world safe. And when he sees a vigilante just going and killing people, he can't have that. He's trying to save those people.

Batman explains how he has his own reasons for why he kills and that Superman may be trying to do good, but no man should posses that power. This is when Superman warns him that next time the bat signal shines, that he'll answer the call. And that he will take care of crime in the world from now on. 

And with Lex Luthor, you could fix that by having him be more accurate to his comic book character. Make him the mastermind. Whenever he goes on Zod's ship, he comes into contact with Darkseid. Darkseid tells him that he will grant Luthor immortality, when he invades earth, if he rids of Batman and Superman, along with the other meta-humans. And this would give Luthor an actual motivation. 

I think you should also have Luthor and Wayne be business partner's and they both discuss how they're going to rid of Superman. Maybe have Luthor supply Bruce with the kryptonite. And simultaneously, have Luthor contact Superman and ask him for help on the Bat vigilante in Gotham.

So Luthor would be working with both Batman and Superman as a catalyst to spark their conflict. And whenever Superman is at the city hall, before it explodes, Luthor calls Bruce and tells him to meet him there. So whenever the building explodes, Superman sees Bruce in the crowd outside, and is infuriated by the fact that he killed all those people just to frame him.

This would set up much more tension in the film between Batman and Superman. And Luthor would also supply Superman with newspapers articles and photos of the people Batman has killed and injured throughout his career. This would enrage Superman. And eventually, for the actual fight between the two, Batman lures Superman into his trap by setting the large empty building on fire. Superman comes to save the day and then Batman attacks him. And while they're fighting, Batman has an earpiece in, listening to Lex Luthor. Luthor is able to see through Batman's helmet, the entire fight and is monitoring Superman's pulse.

And instead of having the two stop fighting over MARTHA, once Batman has Superman on the ground, Superman mentions how Batman framed him for the killing of all the people in the court room. And he was willing to kill hundreds just to frame him. Batman then explains how he never framed him and had absolutely nothing to do with this. Superman then hears Lex's voice through the transmission in the ear-piece, this is when Superman puts it all together. 

That's when Lex unleashes Doomsday and Batman and Superman decide to resolve their differences.

I think that this is an improvement of the actual film and this would have established a lot more character and tension between Batman and Superman. 

I'd love to know what anyone thinks in the comments. Thanks.",fixingmovies,Fixing Batman v Superman conflict,https://www.reddit.com/r/fixingmovies/comments/4kjl0p/fixing_batman_v_superman_conflict/

Okay, I think that's good enough. Hopefully I wont' get wined at for not giving a good enough warning. 

Anyways, I read this theory from this post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/4egl1i/episode_viii_script_leak_please_debunkconfirm/

Now I think one element could be very true, as to how they explain Rey's parents. Here's the quoted scene he claims is part of the film:

&gt; Rey is the reincarnation of Anakin Skywalker. Luke went to the first Jedi temple to better understand how the process works. He learned that the spirit of the chosen one is reincarnated by the Force every time the universe is thrown out of balance, which apparently happens on a semi-regular basis (Anakin was hardly the first time the chosen one reincarnated). This is why she's so crazy powerful with the Force (remember that Anakin blew up the Trade Federation don't ship by himself when he was like 8 years old).

Now the whole idea of the Chosen One is the entire basis of the prequel trilogy, and somewhat the originals. But if indeed Rey is the new Chosen One, it would perfectly tie all the films together. In A New Hope, Obi-Wan explains how the Force is an entity which binds the galaxy together. It is the center-piece of the universe. 

Now see this would be a very clever way for the writers of Episode VII - IX to tie all the films together. Simply what Obi-Wan stated in A New Hope, is exactly what the entire nine Star Wars films are based upon. The Force is an energy field which binds the Galaxy together. Well, the Chosen One binds all the films together. The Force very well binds all the films together, in a coherent story. 

You could say Anakin was the protagonist of the first six films. But, what I think the new writers are trying to say is that the real protagonist is that of the Chosen One. Whether it be Anakin or Rey. 

And also you could say, and this is a joke, since the Force reincarnates a new Chosen One every time the universe is thrown out of balance, then it is somewhat a metaphor for what Disney is doing with Star Wars.

Lucas threw the universe out of balance with the prequels, Anakin being the Chosen One. Now Disney (The Force) is rectifying that by reincarnating Rey (The new trilogy/ the new Chosen One).

Now I don't know that this is the direction Disney is going, but I think it would be a very unique way of fusing all the films together, with a nice bow. It would even reinforce the story of Star Wars more than it already is. Having the Chosen One really be the main protagonist, center-point is just interesting concept, in my opinion.


Also, this statement made by Oscar Isaac reinforces this theory even more.
“I would agree with [Kasdan]. Rian is definitely going to places and investigating things that haven’t really been done in the ‘Star Wars’ universe. For me, it’s so fun getting to explore different things that I wouldn’t have expected in this universe. In some ways it feels like we’re making an independent film. Certain things we get to play with – this kind of intimacy that we get to find – it’s special. It’s been really fun.""

Many fans have seen the terrible three films of the 21st Century. But some may not know that there is a 1994 film. And it's actually pretty decent. Well it's much better than any of the other films.

And the main thing that film gets right is Dr. Doom. The 2015 one was an absolute abomination, and the 2005 one is mediocre. But the 1994 one is far superb to both of the other incarnations. And on top of getting the character right (For the most part), they even did justice to Doom's notorious outfit.

Here is an excerpt from an article which explains how the 1994 film did justice to Doom's character.

""But Corman’s version actually nails it… mostly. Doctor Doom is stuck with ineffectual sidekicks and has at least one too many face palm moments, but his origin (described above) puts him in a position of megalomaniacal power early on, and his vendetta against Reed Richards takes a more elaborate and villainous form than simply beating up on the guy. Also, he looks exactly like he does in the comics, and it actually looks great on camera. He even has a booming voice that fills a room like a proper tyrant, and he sounds just great. Not terribly well acted mind you, but otherwise great.""

Here is the full article:

And here's an album I made which shows the 1994 Doom, for those who haven't seen him.

I do hope to see a proper adaption of the Fantastic Four some day. I'm sure Fox won't be the company to do it. Unless they give complete creative control to the people working on the film.

But anyway, I wanted to know what the best CPU I should get is? I don't have to have 60 FPS, but I'd like to have at least 40.

I followed the Falcon Guide from one guy, can't remember his username. Here's the link: http://s1002.photobucket.com/user/The_FalconO6/media/CurrentLogicalPCBuyingGuide/Guide.png.html

Anyways I was between these two CPUs

Intel Core i5-4460 3.2 GHZ

Intel Core i5-4690K Processor 3.5 GHz

I am assuming the 3.5 GHZ is better, but I am not going to be doing super intense gaming. This will just be a gaming and internet use PC. I would like to be able to run Halo 5 and any new games. I'm hoping these parts will do the job.

Oh and for the RAM I was just going to get 8GB.

I'd love any advice you guys can give me. Thanks.",buildapc,[Build Help] I would really appreciate input on my gaming PC build.,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/3pkcbl/build_help_i_would_really_appreciate_input_on_my/

So there's this girl in one of my classes at school the rumor had been going around that if you said chicken noodle soup to her she would go berserk and walk out of the classroom. And me being the person I am, had to test it out. So the next day during class, I go over to where she's sitting. (Now I had never spoken to her before, so she probably had no idea why I had now). I looked at her and asked if she liked chicken noodle soup; immediately she stands up and just starts crying and running out of the classroom. This sent me into laughter as well as my friends who knew I was going to do it. But at the same time I was confused as to why she reacted this way. Now the teacher had noticed this and sent me out of the classroom.

So I'm sitting in the hallway, and there's no sight of the girl, and the teacher approaches me. I explained to him what I had said, and I could tell he was confused as well. So I guess being the teacher, he felt like he needed to resolve this issue. So after she returned to the classroom, we were both asked to step out into the hall. And this is where it went downhill.

So the teacher asks her side of the story and it's the exact same as mine. So both the teacher and I were confused as to why she freaked out. So he asks her and she tells him that her grandfather drowned in a bowl of chicken noodle soup. I almost started laughing, because that's the most ridiculous way I have ever heard of someone dying. And the teacher was surprised too. But it turned out to be the truth. Her grandfather had a stroke while eating chicken noodle soup, and i guess his head fell into the bowl and he drowned. 

I still feel bad about saying it, but I would have never imagined that scenario. If I had known, I wouldn't have said that, but no one knew why she would freak out. I mean I still laugh over the fact of how he died, not that he died, but how he died. 

TL;DR TIFU by mentioning chicken noodle soup to a girl in my class, but I come to find out her grandfather drowned in a bowl of chicken noodle soup.

Bruce realizes that he cannot stop the Joker without killing him, but Alfred helps him realize how to really defeat the Joker. Near the end, when Bruce is sitting in the chair in his apartment or wherever, reflecting on life, he asks Alfred how they dealt with the situation with the man in the jungle. Now I never caught on to this before., but Alfred says, ""We burnt the forest down."" 

Now this is an implication to what Bruce does near the end. At this point Bruce realizes the only way to put an end to the Joker's reign is by quitting as the Batman. The only way Alfred and his men were to stop the man in the jungle was to kill the sport, which was stealing the jewels or something like that. The Joker is motivated by the sport of getting in Batman's head and screwing with it. Take Batman out of the equation, then Joker is finished. So he hoists up the Joker in the end and lets him be arrested for good and placed in most likely Blackgate prison. But Batman knows Joker will just break out or something, so he retires. Now the Joker has no reason to keep harassing Gotham. 

I kind of doubt I'm the only one to ever bring this up but I feel stupid for never realizing this before. But I thought it was very interesting how Nolan planted this in their. It's very subtle and if you do not pay attention, like me the past five times i watched the film, you won't catch on to it.

Update: I really appreciate the conversations in the comments. And I'd say both the sonar and my theory are correct. They both apply. But the reason I said it was somewhat subtle was because you wouldn't have known Batman was going to retire unless you've seen TDKR, so you have to have known the story for both films. So in a way you don't really get the meaning of the metaphor, and how Batman retiring for eight years was to end the Joker's reign of anarky, until you had seen TDKR in 2012. you weren't supposed to put it together until the overall story was completed for the trilogy. ",movies,[The Dark Knight] I just realized how Batman really defeated the Joker in TDK and how retiring for eight years was his plan.,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3j0w87/the_dark_knight_i_just_realized_how_batman_really/
