I agree with a lot of the things you're saying but I also disagree with a few points. However, the information was absorbed and I appreciate the feedback.

10,"Hello Tofurocks,

I'm going to address this in my next video. I'm reluctant to give out this information, even though it's probably easy to find, just because I don't wish to be immediately discredited by potential viewers by my league, instead of my teaching ability. 

However, that being said, I'm always willing to hear constructive criticism. In fact I thrive for it, I wish to bring the best content I can and would love to know what comments where considered off.

Thanks!
