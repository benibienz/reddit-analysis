There's an MMORPG, that I'm pretty sure shut down, that was all about fishing. It was in an anime style, you could dig for your bait, and when you hooked a fish; tons of colorful sparks came flying out. Does anyone remember the name of this MMORPG?

The idea is to present WoW's in depth story ,told by quests, in a fun and interesting way. A lot of people have pondered the idea of knowing more about WoW's lore but don't want to delve into the depth of material required to catch up or simply don't want to read quest text!

So, I came up with this idea for a video series that would tell these stories in a easier to grasp way that was funner to consume. 

However, about half way through this first chapter I realized the ambition of my idea was quite out of the potential scope I'm capable of doing by myself. So whether I continue to make more is currently uncertain.

That being said, I hope you enjoy what I have come up with and would love to hear your feedback.

Thanks,
DarkslayerTV

About a month ago a friend challenged me to route and speed run Lady Sia. Since then a very small community of about four people has developed around this speed run. We've found several breaks, many of which aren't included in the run, and have began optimizing the game. 

Below I'm going to attach the current world record (which needs optimized severely, it's a bad run.) and a tutorial of the tricks we're currently aware of. We'd love to see more people become interested in Lady Sia and optimize the game further.

A few weeks back I requested you send me some replays and I would do my best to get them cast! You all sent me replays and I was so happy to get the response I received. However, I've ran out and would appreciate it greatly if I could get some more! :)

Also, I've started another series where I analyze your replays to figure out what went wrong in your game. I do my best to not just point it out, but help you make corrections. 

Replays can be sent to: DarkslayerReplays@gmail.com

P.S. If you send a replay in, be sure to let me know if you want it cast or analyzed!
