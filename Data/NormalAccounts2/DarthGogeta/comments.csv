123,"&gt;I also don't know any way for a third party to accurately be able to measure for themselves (please let me know if you do), so sources from Riot are the only option if you actually want to have any discussion with merit. 

The only possible way would be providers. And not even they would be perfect.

&gt;Additionally, if it were that easy to just fudge numbers to the public, I don't see why other developers don't seem to do that and make claims that theirs are more popular than Riot's.

There were many examples of companies making their numbers looking better than they're. Even Blizzard did that in WoW. Im not even saying that Riot is lying. Im just saying to be careful with numbers provided by the developer himself. And yes shady stuff happens, in all companies. (Just google the E.T. Story. :P)

&gt;Yes. You said, ""Players? There is bigger,"" without providing any source or reasonable supporting follow-up. I'm pretty interested in Video Game growth and the industry in general, so if you do have some sources, honestly hit me up! I'd be happy to be proven wrong :D

Acturally I provided an example. Tetris. You could even argue that Mario and Pokemon are also bigger.

&gt;You seem to be annoyed that LoL uses DLC instead of the traditional purchase method, but I don't think that should really affect it being the biggest and most popular game of all time :P. I'm wasn't talking about if the DLC model is what game companies should do, but if you really wanted to measure size by $$$ (as many investors or developers might) then League was still #1 last year.

No, really not, I have no problem with the DLC in LoL (there is far worse in other games, im looking at you EA, Ubi Soft and co), if I had I would not have spent so much money in it.  And again, LoL is for sure not the most popular game of all time. LoL is popular in the gaming scene and even really popular outside of it. You cant compare it to Mario, Pokemon, GTA or FIFA/NFL/NHL(the games) which everyone knows. In a post before you talked about statistics and how you could pick 100 random people and 1-2 of them are playing LoL. You could pick 100 people and I bet 10000 bucks that more than double of the people who tried LoL already played a Mario game. And also more people know who Mario or what Pokemon is than LoL.",2016-09-24 12:11:41+00:00,d801a8c,8.0,t1_d7zzejv,6415.0,leagueoflegends
124,"&gt;League of Legends is unquestionably the largest game ever to have been created.

Lol that sentence alone should be enough to just ignore your complete comment.

&gt;You want measures? How about the fact that they have over 100 million monthly players, almost 1.5% of the global population. If you were to gather 100 random people in the world, from the Andes mountain range to the slums of Mumbai, there would statistically be someone that has played League of Legends in the past month. Even if you could find any larger total (hint: you can't), Riot hasn't even released a total playerbase which is obviously by definition higher than what a monthly number would be.

These numbers come from Riot so take them with a grain of salt.

&gt;I personally don't think that making a free to play game is inherently generous or they should necessarily be applauded for it since it's simply one type of business strategy, but when you start talking about people with ""no idea"" about anything related to the industry, maybe you should look in a mirror.

Should I? Did I say anything false in my statements? Is there something I lied about? The only thing I see here is a bunch a kids whose first big game is LoL. The actual target audience for a free game, people who still have to ask their parents for money to buy a game. Talking about how LoL ist the greatest/largest game ever made when Riot is criticised. Besides that I never said that LoL is a bad game. Hell, on this subreddit there were even multiple people saying that LoL is the most famous game ever existed. And then there is people like you, do you really want to compare the revenue of a game were you can continuously invest money to stuff like Mario, Pokemon, GT, Fifa etc which dont have DLC and still pull giant numbers with every new Version?",2016-09-24 09:37:57+00:00,d7zyoul,6.0,t1_d7zy2cz,2550.0,leagueoflegends

Ocelote as former captain of SK Gaming and xPeke as former captain of Fnatic have clashed many times in the past. SK famously knocked Fnatic out of contention for the World Championships in Season 2, while xPeke got his revenge on SK and Ocelote with the now-legendary Kassadin backdoor play at IEM Katowice 2013.
