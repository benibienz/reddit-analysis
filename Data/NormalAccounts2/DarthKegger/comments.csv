647,"The best way to succeed in KOTR and Exhibition is to have consistency across your cards.  While the Roman Pro is the best card in the game, the rest of your cards aren't close in numbers.  In exhibition I'm sure you normally win one and struggle to get the second win.  It would've been better to keep the Roman cards separate, along with Sheamus and Dolph so you have 4 cards that are pretty even in point totals.

For matchmaking they essentially total up the number of attribute points and place you in matches against similar point ranges.  With one of your cards being overpowered, the other cards in your deck will be overrmatched most of the time.

Not sure what kind of gradual curve you were looking for, but I'm done trying these matches until the second wall in Alberto....I don't really see much of a point to them since I piss away so many matches losing +5 and +3 before I give up and go to the +1

I played some more +3 matches when I hit the wall in the Nikki card, here are the stats from those matches 


I went 0-10-2....only managed two ties with 10 losses


My deck is leg+ with 3 legendary pros, after winning my last +5 match 6-5 I went too the +3


During those matches the total number of legendary pros was 21 for me and 78 for my opponents including 3 matches where I did not get any of my 3.


In all 12 matches I recieved my bottom three cards which are single legendary cards


During those matches my special ability triggered 53 times as opposed to the computer getting his ability 147 times. 

I saw in the 2k forums that you wanted the see a larger sample size of +3 matches so I sacrificed 12 bouts and managed to get a paltry 6 points. My +3 matches started 50 points into Nikki

They say they want you to play your best cards, however I have Ryback Legendary Pro as my best card, 8 Epic pros (none are divas) and two UR Diva pros.  In exhibition if I have Ryback in the lineup I run into all single legendary and Epic Pro divas and can never win those matches as well as multiple Legenadry Pros so the Ryback can only win 1 for me.  If I take Ryback out and put Legendary Edge in so I have a tag partner for Epic Pro Cena, I dominate.  It is too tough to find a balance at higher levels, keeping my Rybacks separate serves no purpose to me since those singles barely make my RD deck yet when I combine them it throws my deck out of balance.

I agree with a lot of the changes but felt they could've rolled it out in a different manner or been a little more open about the upcoming changes.  

As far as the changes, I enjoy being able to customize the cards more, the animations are cool, and I like the fact that you can get good cards in PCC without sacrificing friends and family for a weekend. I haven't spent on season 2 as I was a big spender on season 1 and am afraid to spend if its going to be a yearly change in seasons.   Also, I've cut down on my playing partially because I worked hard to create a top deck for season 1 and haven't felt like investing in season 2 to build as strong of a deck.  

The thing that worries me is that it seems like CatDaddy is communicating less with players since season 2.  Although a lot of the blame rests with people who were downright mean and nasty while Brad was trying to answer questions about season 2.  I feel that a large divide has been created and a lot of players have truly left the game and have no intention of coming back.  ",2015-09-15 17:09:13+00:00,cv2ijok,1.0,t3_3l1ysm,4879.0,wwesupercard

1445,They will make them financially viable if you put a PCC diva out there to drive up the need for a Diva than follow up quickly with an RTG diva to strike while the iron is hot,2015-06-16 17:30:25+00:00,cs8kf1x,6.0,t1_cs8jzwx,584.0,wwesupercard
1446,I think with a Diva PCC followed by a Diva RTG (especially if it is a Trish or Lita) money will flow in because people will feel they need that card to compete. You would have people buying bouts to get a Diva RTG ahead of time so they can compete in KOTR. ,2015-06-16 17:18:09+00:00,cs8jw29,4.0,t1_cs8jr82,186.0,wwesupercard
1447,"I'm basing this on the CatDaddy knowing that there were issues having RTG Nikki floating around in Survivor with no cards to compete against her, as well as RTG being so much more difficult in that tier",2015-06-16 17:15:05+00:00,cs8jr9z,4.0,t1_cs8jow0,93.0,wwesupercard

1451,"No problem, it just concerns me that I've lost so many past KOTR matches in the past where I had the better card and they needed to hit their finisher to win I'm really skeptical about it.  That one just stuck out to me since I have the Ryback card. It's been about a month since I've been to a WM Final.

That sucks you lost in the semis....those Pro Divas are killing everyone (and I can't even pull a Fusion Nikki)",2015-06-16 15:42:42+00:00,cs8g0v1,2.0,t1_cs8fw9e,197.0,wwesupercard
1452,"I did, I activated everything right after I won game 2 and I'm paranoid about forgetting to boost (especially with a WM card on the line) so I checked about a half dozen times to make sure I had boosts activated.  I didn't have enough Speed boosts so I used the 10 credits to buy one.  One time I bought one and forgot to activate it so that is why I'm paranoid about checking and rechecking my boosts.",2015-06-16 15:20:48+00:00,cs8f6rk,2.0,t1_cs8ez37,353.0,wwesupercard

1454,"Someone will have to explain to me the benefit of running WM pros in Survivor KOTR...yes it sucks that WM is a coin toss at best, but if you get lucky you can get a WM card.
