It took several days of killing myself, lack of food or sleep, but I did this in La-Mulana.

Reaction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7QCQMpFzTc

Explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_6QQ3Fpwtg

Basically, it's a TAS-only trick where you do 2 frame perfect inputs to get an early game item about 5 seconds faster. It involves aligning with a wall, then manipulating the x-coordinate float to a precise value using differing speeds in each screen section. (Your speed is different by a few millionths if you're in 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, cuz the way floats round fractions. I add some of these speeds in a way to get a full integer x position.)

Here's a table that might make sense or not.

    screen  1  2  4  8   16   32    64  *128   256    512
    2.4     ?  ?  ? 95 -381 1526  1526 -6104 -6104  24414
    1.2     ?  ? 11 48 -191  763 -3052 -3052 12207  12207
    1.92    ?  ?  ? 76    ? 1984  1984 -1831 13428 -17090

For example, level2 wave2, this is a situation where you'll use all 4 spells to hurt 2 ghosts with each, but you HAVE to use at least 1 spell twice cuz you start by looking at the first spell of each ghost. This 1 spell should be a 1-line spell for the 'A's cuz that's faster and less actions. But for the 'B's, they're followed up with a lightning ghost. So you wanna start with a 2-line spell, do the other 3 spells to hurt 2 at a time, then you'll have 1 ghost left with the 2-line spell. Use lightning to kill the C and the remaining B.

I'll check the rest later. More importantly, how long does it take for B ghosts to appear after A ghosts and such? Does it vary? Also how many of each spell can you (or most people) do per second, on average?

Is...pentab allowed? Maybe writing the spells like ""+VIA"" or ""+VИ-"" would be faster",2016-11-02 20:27:00+00:00,d9ivqfl,4.0,t1_d9innab,9361.0,speedrun

93,"Okay, so this really, really scares me because...Well, it's about something I REALLY love. Tool-Assisted Speedruns (TAS).

Speedruns are about beating a game as fast as possible.

Tool-assisted speedruns is... You can probably skip this whole first big paragraph if you watch this video. https://youtu.be/eM8Z9e-WoFs?t=8m17s (watch to 8:48)

Tool-assisted speedruns is about finding what the hypothetical best possible time could possibly be. After heavy use of save states, and frame-by-frame playing, they create a series of inputs to run into a console through the controller port. They're often impossible for humans to perform, often needing exactly 30 button presses per second in some sections, yet they sometimes reach beyond what you imagine is possible and truly reach godhood within the game.

Here's one of such example. https://youtu.be/BZPQ29NayVQ?t=1m15s (watch to 2:18) That is THIS EPISODE. DwangoAC explained what really is going on in his Twitch stream. The game, for some reason, needs to check twice for the same controller button input in a frame (60 frames per second, btw) to make sure they got the correct input, if it's wrong, in that frame, they'll check twice again. The TAS shoves 6000 button inputs a second to take advantage of this. The game took in so many inputs, you start going outside of the stack list, going into the game's code, and you...make your own code.

So this TAS uses this exploit simply to activate the ending scene. But what else can it do? https://youtu.be/eM8Z9e-WoFs?t=9m16s (Yeah this is that first link. Just watch all of it or whatever you want.) I'd almost call this a more light-hearted version of Playtest. The mind fuck, up to making up its own creator, Shou Saito, talking to you, or make you think the game ended when it didn't. What if Shou Saito wanted to make a Mushroom that tries to make your jaw drop instead of horror? If you're not watching the video, let's just say...[Spoiler](/s ""you can fuck the game up SOOO HARD. Reprogram the entire game, add games inside the game, maybe even just replace the whole game with a different game. Whatever ya want!"")

You can even have a gameboy game connect to the fucking internet! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWa5GPb9fw8 Favorite part is at 6:50.

Picking the 10.84%s seem like the best idea, since you can also click the other 10.84% if you click one. But the chance these numbers will get you stuck again is too likely.

I'm gonna need some opinions on this, does the 12.05% or the 14.76%s seem like a better choice? 14.76% opens two blocks, but it seems 12.05% has a slightly better chance of revealing more of the board, however little that is...

That's why I said you're on the right track, duh. I was just saying, you mentioned clicking behind 50/50s and I mentioned you forgot what more place you can do just that. And you have to agree, with your method, that is still the best spot to click.

I'll explain later. Basically if 250 was 100%:

     42  42  42  42  42  42
     42  42  42  42  21 104
     42  42  42  42  21
     42  30  30  30 104
    120 130      30 146

In percentages:

    16.8 16.8 16.8 16.8 16.8 16.8 
    16.8 16.8 16.8 16.8  8.4 41.6
    16.8 16.8 16.8 16.8  8.4
    16.8 12.0 12.0 12.0 41.6
    48.0 52.0      12.0 58.4

But next is a P vs NP problem of what risk is *worth taking*.

These percentages doesn't tell you what to click. Sure, the 8.4% blocks seem nice, but that's not a guarantee it's the best choice. And if they're the best choice, which one? I would go with the bottom 8.4%. It will be reveal how many mines there are in 3 new blocks to its left. The chance that amount is 0 or 3 is

(12%\*16.8%^(2))+(88%\*83.2%^(2)) =0.339%+60.916% =61.255%

and either possibility will solve a huge chunk of the board, and will likely give us more low risk choices we could make.

However, what's a really REALLY good choice is one of the 30%s, specifically the bottom-right one. Think about this. [To its right is 2 blocks, in which we already know there's 1 mine there.](http://image.prntscr.com/image/eb72e7f6e1f844469b455da9947e3a5b.png) So clicking this block will reveal the number of mines in the other 2 blocks adjacent to it: the ones up and up-left of it. 

[Well, there's either 0 or 1.](http://image.prntscr.com/image/ffc234053c1e472083c7868926b8d06f.png) (There can't be 2, because there's only 1 block surrounding the 3.)

To explain the colors, red is mine, green is safe, blue line means ""there's 1 mine in these blocks"". Orange mark means ""this block is solvable when green blocks are cleared."" Orange line means ""we'll know how many mines are in these blocks when green blocks are cleared."" Just by clicking that block, this much reasoning is possible for Furudo Erika, ohohoh-- nvm sry. The top possibility is less likely to happen as 27.27% vs 72.73%, btw. The top possibility is nicer cuz if the orange mark turns out to be green (83.2% chance this will happen), then even *MORE* of the board could be solved!

Oh well, I could go on and on with the probabilities until I exhaust EVERY. SINGLE. POSSIBLE choice we can make through the entire game, but finding out what choices we should make using such a brute force method is for computers and currently, nobody made a solver that would do just this. Even if they do, it will freeze your entire computer very often, unless they specifically programmed it to stop after like a million combinations.

Well, that's it for me here. I'm gonna go sleep.",2016-08-31 12:05:19+00:00,d73vgpa,1.0,t3_50d5vm,57188.0,Minesweeper

When a player dies, you get extra health, but only some of them are healed, while that player's death heals other teams.

When someone takes damage or heals, other teams will take damage, but not too much. 

In pvp, when damage is dealt to either player, both fighters will take minimum damage and knockbacked upwards. 

All the above damages cause knockback, and a 3rd a second away from each other, so that all the knockback will boost both players up super high. Whoever gets a kill here will gain fall damage immunity so a double kill doesn't happen every sword fight.

There is one number per block. The /X is ""out of X combinations"". So the bottommost block has a 1/6 chance of killing you, while the topmost has 7/12.

If I were to take the undiscovered blocks into consideration, these numbers will go up to large numbers. 94 blocks with 18~22 mines. 94 choose 18~22 can become 18 digit to 21 digit numbers. Still, finding their greatest common denominator, they can be reduced to 14, 56, 210, 740, &amp; 2701.

The part at 11 seconds has been way more optimized than how I used to do it. And of course, at the end, I do a swag strat and fall off the edge of the level.

Camera Obscura is a puzzle platformer and there's a few people who did blind speedruns of it, but only 3 people who did a practiced run and put it on the leaderboards, and it's not competitive at all, since I'm the only one who did multiple runs. 

It's more a puzzle than a platformer, and there are almost no glitches, and I don't practice it as much these days so it should be very easy to take the record. There are any of 58 IL records to take from me, too. The few people I was super competitive with in IL leaderboards stopped running ILs and I just feel bad taking their records these days.

Floatkid is a joke IWBTG fangame combining the ""dotkid"" mechanic and the bubble mechanic. It's 1 screen of moving a floating 2x2 pixel box pixel by pixel though precise spikes, so nobody runs it.

587,"The most math I've seen myself use in a speedrun is where, in Camera Obscura, you can copy the blocks surrounding you and the blocks follow you for a second, then freeze, so you can place them where you want. The thing is, the copies move 1.4 times slower than you.

So I thought, [if I can jump onto a copy above me and land on it, then jump again, I could have the copy raised worth two jumps (divided by 1.4), from which I can do a third jump off from again.](https://youtu.be/hiGKzaRH0ZM?t=4s) (I do this 4 seconds in, and 14 seconds in.)

In the video I linked above, I'm trying to reach a 7 block high platform using this unintended trick. To do that, I need the absolute maximum height possible, since my max jump height is 2.8 (making the max height of my copies exactly 2 blocks).

This is 6.8 blocks total, so it seemed hopeless, but stay with me here. The devs left a 0.1 block leeway for people barely able to reach a platform. The max height, 2.8 blocks, still can't reach a 3 block high platform, so sadly this can't be used there.

First jump, we want our copy to reach the max 2 blocks high, and for us to be just 0.1 blocks below that block to reach it. Then we need to be 2\*1.4+0.1 = 2.9 blocks below my goal. In other words, I want to be 2.9-2 = 0.9 blocks below the *starting* platform. So for my setup copy, I put the copy 0.9 blocks below the starting platform and to the side, where I can begin the 7 block trick.

So 2.8 + 0.1 so far. And now I do a full 2.8 block high jump in place, raising the copy by 2.8/1.4 = 2 blocks. If done at the right timing, the copy should freeze at that max height.

From there, I do another 2.8 block high jump, and I'm 0.1 blocks just below my goal (2+0.1+2+2.8 = 6.9 blocks), which the game allows me to reach, totaling the 7 blocks I needed to reach the height to skip more than 70% of this level.",2016-06-14 19:58:38+00:00,d497ht7,1.0,t3_4o36m5,1766.0,speedrun

646,"I want to add to this video that, overall, if we consider the 16 bits inputted into the RNG function as:

A B C D | E F G H | J K L M | N O P Q (maybe I should use different variables?)

And you manipulate this based on what's said in the video. Like, after the first few steps, you'll get that ^(*the right byte is moved to the left, and left and right byte xor'd together becomes the right byte. The last digit of this value is important and it is the xor of the last digits of both left and right byte: H^Q.*)

^(*You then xor by the left byte moved 1 bit left, then move result 1 bit right, and xor by FF80. Here, you know that the last bit of S0 is important, H\^Q. The two bytes will decide to xor S1 with share the same numbers in a few bits. X00X XXX1 1XXX 0X00. These are independent of H\^Q, so they are simpler. The bits I marked with X vary depending on H\^Q, and will be xor'd by it.*)

Well...anyway, assume ^ means ""xor"", and ! means ""not"" and the output will be:

---
!H\^Q

!J

!K

L\^H\^Q

---
M\^H\^Q

N\^H\^Q

O\^H\^Q

P

---
Q\^J

!A\^J\^K\^H\^Q

!B\^K\^L\^H\^Q

!C\^L\^M\^H\^Q

---
D\^M\^N

!E\^N\^O\^H\^Q

F\^O\^P

G\^P\^Q

---
Edit: I made a mistake somewhere. Fixed it, but this got more complicated. I'll admit this is random enough. (I tried to split them by 4 to make it more organized. Dunno if that helps.)

One note about XOR, think of it like this. If you have a value and you xor it by 0, it stays the same. If you xor it by 1, it changes. 1-&gt; 0. 0-&gt; 1. That should simplify a lot. 

Should I write a detailed proof here?

So each frame, the 16 bits of RNG values go through this function about 0~4 times a second, I guess?

Trying to go through the 100F tower was hardest. I got stuck spawning in the opposite side of the tower, where all the monsters were stronger than me, so I had to climb the whole thing. Everything would one-hit me, a wrong jump or misstep would mean taking fatal fall damage, and I would spawn all the way at the beginning town.

727,"Yes, but you can reduce that number by an incredible amount by taking out repetitive combinations. 

If you have the total amount of mines and a range n1~n2 amount of mines that are in the blocks that are adjacent to numbers (I call these shores). You can subtract that from the total mines and get how many mines there are in the blocks nonadjacent to numbers (I call these land). There's m1~m2 amount of mines in the land, so if you counted how many land blocks there are, you can do a (L choose m1) all the way to (L choose m2). You basically found the m1th to m2th number in the Lth row of Pascal's triangle. These are, most of the time, divisible by a large number, greatly simplifying a problem with 100 digits into one with 20digits. (or 20 to, like 5. You get the point.) I show how to find how to make these numbers smaller in the link below.

1 mine in group AB. 2 mines in group CFGH. And 1 mine in DE. All 4 mines accounted for, I has no mine. (well that's a grammatically correct sentence...)

H is opposite I, so that's solved ezpz (it's a mine).

Since DE and EF are grouped, D is opposite E is opposite F. In other words, D=F. So technically, BCD(has 2 mines) and CFG(has 1 mine) have 2 overlapping blocks. The overlap CD(or CF) cannot have 2 or 0 mines or it would contradict one group's mine amount or the other. Basically, it's a common 1-2 pattern formed very...strangely.

1047,"#First step: Identifying the board

http://i.imgur.com/gsWloBr.png

So I first find all the mines and open spots I know. Next I identify draw lines where I know how many mines there are in a group of boxes. Here, red means 1mine, and green means 2mines. Group the lines that overlaps and they will link into 3 groups. Each individual line is a shore, and these groups are shore groups. These shore groups all have a variable mine amount. Coincidentally, they all have 2 or 3 mines, although the probability of if they have 2 or 3 is different for the 2nd shore group than the 1st &amp; 3rd ones.

Anyway, overall, we identified 50 mines and there are 6~9 more mines among these shore groups. Simply, 56~59. So in the grey boxes exclusive to all this, there are a range of (total-59)~(total-56) mines. Assuming 99mines, that's 40~43.

Now we need to count how many grey boxes there are. ...... There are 166 grey boxes. I call these land.

I need the total mine count, but I won't assume this is a default 99mine expert mode board yet. We have 480 boxes and 166 land. 480-166=314. So we have 56~59 mines in 314 boxes. With the same density, there's 85.6~90.2 in 480 boxes. It's only natural that the spots already open have a lower density than the rest of the board, btw, since the lower density parts are easier to open, boxes with 0s opening automatically and all. I don't know how high the difference is by average, but 10~13 mines seem decent. I'm not about to assume there's 85~91 mines total, and do probability calculation for every single potential total mine count...

So we now have to take each shore group and, among all possible mine arrangement combination, find how many combinations there are for each mine count (smallest~largest). There's only 2 mine counts and 2, 3, 2 combinations respectively, so this will be very simple. (I screwed this up and had to do it all over again. Namely, I switched the 2&amp;1 in the 2nd row.)

From 1st to 3rd:

    1 1
    2 1
    1 1

    166
    40~43
With the shore array, total land, &amp; land mines, we have the very identity of the current situation of the board in 3 numbers and a sequence. This is all we need to begin calculating.

We need to find the total combinations of shore and land respectively.

Starting with the shore, since this case is simpler, treat each line of the shore array as a polynomial and multiply them.

(x+1)(2x+1)(x+1) = 2x^(3)+5x^(2)+4x+1

Take the coefficients and you get back [2 5 4 1]. That's it.

For land, we need to find the ratio of 4 numbers, a,b,c,d, which are (166 choose 40) ~ (166 choose 43). If you plug that into Wolfram Alpha, you'll realize that might be a bit of an inefficient way to do things. (It's like a 50 digit number, isn't it? Undecillion or whatever.) You only need the smallest a~d that still represents the ratio of these 4 over9000digit numbers. Here's what you do.

All (n choose k) numbers are actually Pascal's Triangle numbers. a~d are the 40th~43rd numbers on the 166th row. Knowing this, we can just take 166 and subtract by 40, then divide it by 41. Then keep doing that.

    a*126/41=b
    b*125/42=c
    c*124/43=d
You get those 3 numbers, and you do those operations on a~d. We just need to find an 'a' that will make b,c,d all whole numbers. Look at the right numbers 41~43 and find common denominators with the number left of them, and then all the numbers above that number. For example, 43 doesn't share a denominator with 125 or 126. But 126 is entirely divisible by 42. Since 42 is entirely eliminated, 'a' just needs to be 41*43.

     1763 *126/41=  5418
     5418 *125/42= 16125
    16125 *124/43= 46500
And we got 1763, 5418, 16125, &amp; 46500 to compare with [2,5,4,1]. Great. No problem, the numbers always get this large. I've seen it go up to 11digits, but don't complain. We could've used those 50~100digit numbers instead.

btw, it's important that you reverse the order of the total land combinations a~d. That's because the we went from least to most mines with shore boxes, the more shore mines there are, the *less* land mines there are. So shore mines increase, land mines decrease. [46500,16125,5418,1763]. Note that these can be seen as the probabilities of how many mines there are in the land, and similarly, how many mines there are in the shores. So the shores have a x26 higher chance of having 6 mines than 9 mines. Most of the time, shores are likely to have less mines than more, so always go for that if you're in a hurry. Not 100% guaranteed, but it's a good bet if you can't spend hours doing what I'm doing in this comment EVERY time you get stuck. And trust me, I do custom density runs, I have to do this like 50 times each playthrough...

So what now? Dot product. We multiply the numbers in the two sequence of numbers, then add them. It's simple. (I say this, but then I accidentally thought [2 5 4 1] is [1 4 5 1] for some reason, and I had to redo everything all over again.)

2\*46500 + 5\*16125 + 4\*5418 + 1*1763 =197060

That's every single combinations of arrangement of mines on the board, congrats! Of course, there's like decillions of combinations, but we cut that all off with that one simple trick. Sweepers *hate* him. Sorry, I'm a memer.

We're far from done. Let's start with finding the exact probability of dying if you click a land mine. All land mines have the same probability, why wouldn't they?

So we have a 3rd sequence of numbers, [43,42,41,40]. (Again, reverse order for land.) multiply all 3 sequences.

43\*2\*46500 + 42\*5\*16125 + 41\*4\*5418 + 40\*1*1763 = 8344322

And divide that with 141616 and we get our average total land mines count: 42.3440 (This is probably the simplest way to solve this. Tell me if I'm being an idiot because ANY way to make this simpler would be great.)

Like with statistics, you might wanna hold on to 4 digits of numbers, just in case.

So divide that with 166 and you got yourself a 25.509% chance of killing yourself, congrats! So about what we just did? Don't bother doing it. Land mines are almost never the answer. Why? The shore mines have like dozens of boxes with different probabilities. At least one of them has to be lower than 25%, right?

Well here we go. This is the final boss of Minesweeper Probability Calculations: Calculating each and every shore box's death chance.

#Step 3: Calculating Each and Every Shore Box's Death Chance.

Actually, we're pretty blessed with this board. We only need to find 5 different probabilities! Finding which box to calculate is important to speedrunning calculating all this, or yknow, not wasting your life on this any more than necessary.

Remember the shore array? (It's just below this if you don't. Don't worry, I don't blame you.) We need to find the anti array for each line. Simple. You could either polynomially divide the total sequence, or just polynomially multiply all the other lines. You would ask why the *fuck* would we polynomially divide here and you're right. Polynomial division sucks ass. But ask that again if we had 6 lines, each with 5 numbers. We got lucky here.

    1 1    2 3 1
    2 1    1 2 1
    1 1    2 3 1
    2 5 4 1
Yes, [2 5 4 1]/[1 1] = [2 3 1]. But why do that when you could [2 1]*[1 1]=[2 3 1].

So what do we do with these [1 3 2]s and that [1 2 1]? Dot product *twice* with [46500,16125,5418,1763]. First with the first 3 numbers, then with the last 3 numbers.

    2 3 1    146793 50267
    1 2 1     84168 28724
    2 3 1    146793 50267

Those numbers you have is how many land combinations there are for each shore combination, depending on their mine count. If you didn't understand that, screw it! You have 2 numbers. Dot product them by their respective [1 1] or [2 1]. Guess what you get?!!?! PENI-- You get 197060. What a magical number~. Well duh, you just calculated for the total mine combination. You GOT the total mine combination.

What now? Divide these 6 numbers by 197060.

    74.4915% 25.5085%
    42.7119% 14.5763%
Almost done. The 3 rightside boxes of the 2nd shore occurs twice, so you want to add those up. That is, 42.7119*2 and 42.7119+14.5763.

I'll just draw this for you the best I can.

    25.51 25.51 25.51 25.51 25.51 100     100
Yeah. You're done. Well, not really. You have the probability. So...what now? Just click the least risky box? You naive, little, hypothetical bastard. If you click the 25.51% land box on the top or bottomleft, you could get a 0 and it'll be good. But you only have a 30.79% chance of that. You'll probably get 1, 2, or 3, and you're stuck again. If you click the 25.51% box twice left of the topmost '2', you'll get a 1 or 2 and that's better. The difference between these is because of their yield. This is the hidden boss after the last boss in this game. We need to find every yield of every unopened box and we need to consider every combination. Each land box has an entirely unique yield, and nothing is sacred.

#Step 4: Find the Yield for Clicking Each Box. Do this for every box. For every one of the 40digit amount of combinations.
                                
I don't know how to do this without bruteforce. Whatever, fuck it, I'm done. Bye. (The paragraph above does show how to estimate yields, but that's just an estimate. If you get every yield to the 3rd decimal, compare it with each probability and find which risk is mathematically most worth it. Thanks for reading, and good luck.

B~E are all 33.3% chance of death. A is 66.7%.

If you pick A, there's a mine in B and E, creating a 50/50, solving the entire board. **Overall solvability: 1/3*1/2 = 1/6 to win**

If you pick C or D, you won't solve anything and the rest of the board will become a 50/50. **Overall solvability: 2/3*1/2 = 1/3 to win**

Choosing B would open E and visa versa. Now, when you open E, it reveals if D has a mine or not depending if E's number is 1 or 2. Then C is solvable and A, too. **Overall solvability: 2/3 to win**

Conclusion, pick B and E. No need to choose, either means the same thing. If you're going for time, just pick E and you'll probably be able to solve it in the least clicks. I won't go over that in this comment.",2016-01-26 23:27:06+00:00,czd6a7m,1.0,t3_42d6kl,261494.0,Minesweeper

Here's how to calculate the exact probability of a mine in each block:

http://imgur.com/RYyNSLW

So first, the ""circuits"" image shows everything we know based on the numbers. The blue lines mean there's 1 mine among the blocks the line crosses; the green line means there's two. You should just do this in your head. Drawing that was a hassle.

The point of this is so you can find how the groups are divided. On the top-left ""groups"" image, I divide it into two. The black group has an unchanging 1 mine in them, so we can ignore that. However, the green group has 8~10 mines. Still... thank god there's not like 5 groups. Hellish...

The 4 images bottom-right are to make it easier to see all possible combinations the group has. The red numbers mean how many combinations there are in each image, so there's a total of 43 combination of mine placements.

So we have to find how many mines there are for each case of amount of mines in the group. From 1 to 4, I figure how many of the combinations has 8, 9, or 10 mines.

    10:     8+16 =24
     9: 2+1+2+12 =17
     8:        2 = 2

    24 15 4

I go from 10 to 8 because that's 23, 24, &amp; 25 mines outside the group each. 34-1-(10~8) It's good to have a consistent order so you don't get confused.

Now here's the thing. You have to count how many inner blocks there are, blocks that are not part of the groups. I'll do it for you. There's 96 inner blocks. There are between 23 &amp; 25 inner mines in 96 inner blocks.

Why did we need this? Well, depending on if there's 8~10 mines in the group, there's 23~25 mines in the inner blocks. There are more combinations of 25 mines 96 blocks than there is 23. Between ""5 choose 2"" and ""5 choose 1"", ""5 choose 2"" is clearly larger. It's the same thing. But by how much? We need to find the exact ratio between these mine combination amounts.

How do we find that? Well, you can go type ""96 choose 25"" and tell me how that went. What? A 23-digit number? I got just the thing to help you with that. Do 96-23=73 and put it over 23+1=24 for 93/24. Don't do the operation. Then -1 the multiplying number and +1 the dividing number, for 92/25. You would keep going until you reach the largest inner mines number, but you already did, so stop there.

    A*73/24=B
    B*72/25=C

You can apply any number, like 1, into A and it's done. However, I prefer to add a number that will result in all the numbers becoming whole numbers. To get that number, just multiply by all the dividing numbers on the right side, but for each number, see if they share a common denominator with the number to the left of it, as well as all the numbers above it. Here, I just 24*25=600.

    600  *73/24 =1825
    1825 *72/25 =5256

    600  1825  5256

And that's it. We now know how many combination of inner mines there are depending on how many mines there are in the group. If you want the total amount of combination of mine placements, which you need, you can multiply each mine amount situation, then add them all together.

       24    17     2
    * 600  1825  5256
    14400+31025+10512 =55937

Edit: will finish in a few minutes.

We're almost done. Except this is my least favorite part... Go to each, but not every, block and see how many times a mine occurs inside it for each amount of mines in the whole group, 8~10. For each occurrence with 8 mines, add 5256. For 9, 1825. And for 10, 600. Add it all up and divide it by the total, 55937, to get your exact probability! Multiply by 100 to turn it into percentage. You can use some of these numbers to figure out the rest of the blocks in a faster way.

For example, if you pick every combination with a mine in the top-leftmost block, you find in image (1), (2), (4) that there are 2+1+2= 5 combinations with 9 mines, and in (3) &amp; (4), there are 2+4= 6 combinations with 10 mines. The top-leftmost block has a (5*1825+6*600)/55937 = 12725/55937 = 22.749% chance of having a mine! Since we know the two blocks to the right of this block both have the same property to this block, we can assume all three have 22.749% chance each.

Another example, this time the bottom-rightmost block. Adding combinations from (1)~(4) 2+1+2+6=11 with 9 mines. From (3) &amp; (4), 8+24=32 with 10 mines. 39275/55937 = 70.213%. That's pretty high, so you don't wanna click that. But the block above that? What? We're gonna do the whole process for it? No, just do 100-70.213=29.787%! The block above THAT block? 1-X=70.213! The block left of that block? 1-X=29.787! Doing a lot of this, it won't take as long to find the probability for every block in the board.

So what next? Just click the safest block? No. You now have to consider the possible yield from clicking that block. If there's a mathematical way to calculate this portion, I don't have it. Therefore, you're going have to just go by your gut on if a block is worth clicking. You have the risk calculated now, so you can just measure against that now.

Hopefully, I can find a way to calculate a block's yield. I have an idea, but it would be too complicated, involving doing the probability calculation over and over again a thousand times, and I think there might be a simpler way around it. I have a flow chart for the brute force version, but I didn't upload it yet.",2016-01-19 08:30:51+00:00,cz3qwkv,3.0,t1_cz3d45m,28202.0,Minesweeper

Personally, I think ZeedMilleniummon's power was just exaggerated from rumors back when the game released, and the internet was great at spreading misinformation. And they seem to exist to this day since almost nobody played Brave Tamer. listing some rumors...

X: ZeedMilleniummon is the ruler of the past, present, and future. He can create and destroy space-time at will.

X: He's an infinite being existing in all space and time at once.

X: If his seal is broken, the world will end.

ZeedMilleniummon CAN travel through time and space at will. He can manipulate causality (I think something mentioned Pixiemon and Wisemon could do this, too). And he took over the future. But he had some places he didn't have control over, so he planned to destroy the past and recreate the world from 0. He attacks ENIAC and successfully destroys it. But this is where it gets stupid. Atanasoff–Berry existed before ENIAC. If ZeedMilleniummon just attacked Atanasoff–Berry, he would've won. He even could've traveled time himself, but he just sent minions weaker than himself. I dunno.

And I have to add that Melano's opening in the demo was so good that I bought the game at full price and went to support them on pateron. To be honest, I felt the demo didn't have to go so long. I think it could've ended around when the group reached the boat.

1414,"I thought up a few awhile back. I think the ones that weren't terrible ideas were Crests of Tenacity, Freedom, Joy, and Power.

Power is about a chosen one who didn't meet her partner digimon for a very long time. That digimon grew and killed until it towered over all other digimon. He crosses the portal to find his partner and kidnaps her to use as a weapon. But she was empathic of his situation, as she has wanted great power, too. By the time the heroes reach the digimon's lair, the two had made an agreement and the war between the two species was over. They will unite over a larger threat.

Joy is about a young girl who didn't fit in with the other digidestineds. Nobody hated her. But they all had problems and were giving up working as a group. She's not as old as them, they may think she's just annoying or useless, but she's the only one who can make them smile again.

Three close friends once promised each other to go on an adventure like in the cartoons. Then in highschool, they find their digimon. They all decide to pack their bags, take a car, and run away from home. They travel city to city, plotting ways to earn money or steal food, evading the police and helping locals, all with the help of each other and their digimon. But then the digidestined of freedom finds that their decision has consequences as a huge incident happens...

There was a child who was bullied, abused, and was always alone. But through everything, he never gave in. He was determined to live for something. But that something was nothing good. He was determined for revenge. Years later, the digimon lord tells the heroes that someone proclaiming themself as the human lord has been abducting digimon, using them to control every aspect of the human world behind the shadows. All electronics were being watched and controlled, information is spread and contained, machines would go rogue, and the humans were being used to attack the digital world.",2015-11-20 19:37:41+00:00,cx77u6e,1.0,t3_3thx4c,73436.0,digimon

So these time loop ideas have interested me quite a bit. I had the idea of what if a human was stuck in a time loop, looking at it from an outside perspective. What kind of person would do the same thing over and over again, going back in time and repeating. Depression? Stupidity? Other than insanity or being in a coma, nothing makes sense. Humans, by nature, are supposed to keep trying different things! But then I thought, they are forced/mind controlled to do the same sequence of actions. After all, something would have changed them to never age in the first place. What's to say a few other things changed, too.

Hypothetically, it would take the massive amount of energy to split the timeline and change the past, and if you fail, the universe will rebound back to a stable timeline, fixing you into a single place in time to repeat for eternity. Maybe a few decades. At worst, just within few seconds of time as you repeat those same few seconds. And to the rest of the world, you're just something that existed for just those few seconds. They won't even know that you, an anomaly, even exist.

Consider columns as A, B, C, and rows as 1, 2, 3, 4. I would choose C1(this would kill me, but it's still a good guess), C4, or B4.

The corners are obvious, but why B4? It's right next to a blue line created by the ""3"" (There's 1 mine in 2 blocks.) so when you click what you click, if you get a 1, you'll know the rest has no mines. (This does not apply if you click B1 obviously.) And if you get a 2, 3, or 4, you'll know there is 1, 2, or 3 mines among the 3 mines. You would be lucky to get a 4, since that solves the whole board, but you're way most likely to get a 2, I'm afraid. 1 or 3 should be sufficient to solve the whole thing, though.

Of course, there's a much easier way. Same image, note that there's a 3 and a 1 adjacent together. Only one of 3's mine can be in 1's area. Meaning two of 3's mine MUST be outside 1's range.

Since as a kid, whenever I made mistakes, it's painful to look back, so I would go on as if it never happened and try to remove it completely from my memory, when I should be thinking about them and trying to figure out my flaws. So even to now, I'm a very cringey person who thinks he is never wrong.

If I was here to apologize, I would've already said sorry by now, but this would make a shitty apology. What would I even be apologizing for? I'm just writing this here to admit mostly to myself. I suppose it's here for those this applies to. I never mentioned exactly what I did, because there isn't just one. There's too many to count. I'm just talking generally about everything mistake I made  while I was here, or even anywhere else. Just, if I wronged you, I probably still remember anyway. And I probably know. And I probably tried to forget.

Finally, I should just stop telling myself everyone hates me. If people say that's not the case, maybe it's time I should trust those words from my great friends.

First, the three 3s below the block have a total of 5 combinations, only one of which has a mine in the green block. And then, among those 5, 1 of them forces the two 2s below the three 3s to have one combination instead of 2. And then there's one mine out of 4 blocks adjacent to the 4 up-left of the block will have a mine. Since only one block is overlapping between these two formations, we just multiply the two numbers.

We can also take the 3 above the 4 into account. This would mean 9*3.5 = 31.5

So that block has a 2 our of 63 (or 1/31.5) chance of having a mine. A bit more than 1/40 but close, I guess.

1838,"So I'm going to use my usual method. It will make things a bit more complicated than usual, but I have to do this step by step.

Divide blocks with those adjacent to numbers and those nonadjacent, respectively called shores and lands. Only the two corner blocks are lands. The rest are shores. Group the shores to top-left and bottom-right groups.

Top-left group has 3~2 mines. Bottom-right group has 2~1 mines. I go most~least group mines because they will be inversely related to the amount of land mines.

Top-left group has 3 combinations. 2 with an extra mine. 1 without.

2 1

Bottom-right group has 2 combinations. 1 with an extra mine. 1 without.

1 1

Overall, they can have 5~3 combinations. 2 with 2 extra mines, 3 with one extra mine, 1 without.

~~2~~ 3 1 (2 extra mines is 5 mines. There is total 4 mines, so this is impossible.)

There are two land blocks. If there is 0 mines among them, there are 1 combinations. If there is 1, 2 combinations.

    3 1
    1 2
    ---
    3 2

3 combinations with no land mines. 1 combination with 1 land mine, so 2 land combinations. Total 5 combinations.

So we need to find how many times among the 5 combinations each block would have a mine.

    12 |
    13 |
    1  | 41
    32 | 11

Now to find what happens if we were to click each block. There are 5 possible combinations and 11 choices we can make. We will be going over 55 possible outcomes.

If you said ""more isn't necessarily harder"" you're right. However, you said amount is irrelevant. Amount *is very* relevant.

Say there's zero or one mine in a board. Click one spot and you win. (First click is always guaranteed to be safe.)

Hypothetically, all but two spots are mines. You start by clicking a spot. You get a 8. There are 480-9=471 spots left and only one of them is the safe spot. GG

50% is the hardest, with higher than 50% becomes easier at a *much* slower rate. That is humanly impossible without god-like luck.
