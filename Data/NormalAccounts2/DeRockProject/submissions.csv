I got drunk and made this. I dunno. (I wasn't actually drunk. Just sleepy.)

So as a refresher, in Compensation, when a player on a team dies, the player's max health is divided up and added to the max health of the player's teammates. The extra health received will also be filled, effectively healing the player by extra hearts given.

---
Now, what I'm **adding** to that, when a person dies, the amount of damage the person took just before they died must be subtracted from the health that gets healed, then do a square root, round down, THEN split among the teammates. Then multiply that by 0.9, subtract 0.2 hearts, round up, and everyone in the OTHER teams will get the NEGATIVE of that amount of damage. (The minimum damage from this will be 3% because √(0.1) is 0.3 hearts, while the minimum negative damage will be 0.9*0.3-0.2 = 1%. When enemy teams take this negative damage, they WILL receive knockback.)

And every time someone takes damage, the other teams will take 20% of that damage, maxing out at 1.5 hearts (20% of 7.5 hearts). And when someone heals, everyone in the other teams will take half a heart of damage per heal.

And when someone makes an enchanting table or an anvil, everyone in that team takes half a heart (no knockback).

And when pvp happens, the Damage Dealer (the DD) takes half a heart, and the Damaged (the D) also takes half a heart. If a player gets a kill, they get fall damage immunity for 2 seconds.

These extra damages will all be dealt one third of a second from each other (in the order in which I mentioned each in this post), knockback included.

The intention is that this results in (with enough combos), for a player to get knocked high enough to take fall damage on flat ground.

When I saw the scenes of Igo-Soccer being played, whether it was the passion or that ""feeling of watching a game I had no idea about"" being conveyed from the author, I felt a certain empathy, as I like to watch Tool Assisted Speedruns of video games I never played, displaying technical skill and knowledge of the game entirely beyond me, and literally beyond human.

Anyway, assuming all statements in these scenes as truth, that Sakurai and Takasaki sensei are pros going beyond the convention of the game, that no move was being wasted, that it was true someone might've died, and that this game truly is intended to be a combination of Igo and Soccer, then I realized there weren't too many possible interpretation.

Made at the insistence of the president of Daiku Corp for unknown reasons, it singlehandedly ended the cold war 10 years ago. At first, it was used as a proxy of warfare, bringing peace to the era. Soon after, the evolution of the metagame replaced the war with an international game more bloody and chaotic than the war itself ever was.

A sport so extreme, a single move could kill a majority of the pieces on the board/play field .

It's soccer, but with igo rules applied. There are no ""turns"", but players must take considerable thought before taking each action. There is no limit to the people who can join, including the enthusiastic spectators, hyped up by the ultra-nationalism at the time. The few can surround the many and wipe out the opposing team, in the name of putting the ball into the opponent's goal. Most of the violence in the sport can be attributed to hateful and racist propaganda by the governments of participating nations. Examples major Igo-Soccer tournaments during the Cold War Era include the games hosted in Vietnam and Korea.

Because spectator participation is allowed, 3rd parties could form, either with intent to reduce fatalities, or from disagreeing with their own home team, or in extreme cases, to disrupt and end the game itself through bombings, all allowed by Daiku Corp's rulings.

To keep further loss from occurring, the metagame evolved to the point of surpassing violence, whole games consisting nothing but various threats and treaties, which if one team breaches, the other team may break several in return, exponentially escalating tensions between teams.

One way of keep low fatalities was to make ""deals"" or ""bets"", where players will agree on rules for a game within the game, and whoever wins could gain territory in the soccer field, or even go ""all-in"", producing a winner without ever kicking the ball. Shockingly, Daiku Corp made new rules stating that deals made in this way must be adhered to strictly, overriding even the game's original rules, or the referees will forcefully ban the offending team (the referees at the time being the full military force of the entire world). With this, the game can turn more and more labyrinthine as players add arbitrary rules after rules.

Since any sort of action (especially small movements) could be suspected by enemies as ciphers, all players are mostly seen seemingly frozen perfectly still in thought, moving only rarely, and explicitly, to signal the other team various requests, threats, or challenges. When this happens, every single position of the fingers and angle of the limbs is scrutinized for any hint or motive of foul play.

With this final state, you can say igo-soccer is a complicated series of mating rituals, and, in fear of retaliation and struggles to deescalate tensions: M.A.D, Mutually Assured Destruction.

The reason for these complicated changes in the sport is partially caused by excessive ""updates"" in the rules by Daiku Corp, who claims it was done at the insistence of the ""benefactor"". When asked for the reasons this mysterious man added these rules, the president stated ""Because it's cool."" The UN agreed to severely limit Daiku Corp from making new rules by the time igo-soccer started determining the fate of the world, saying ""It's as if the person who made the rules doesn't know real people are playing and dying in this sport.""

Modern day igo-soccer is considered a martial art of peace, sociology, and rationality.

To this day, Daiku Kenzaburou still does not know that he invented the sport, his doting parents accepting his absurd requests using their massive political influence. Only by finding his younger self, who made the sport on a whim, will he find his true potential in igo-soccer.

Some historically notable players include John von Neumann, John F. Kennedy, his assassin, and Mao Zedong.

But I once got the idea to make a new characters with dark sight (rogue skill to hide from monsters) and just explore. Some monsters could hurt you with magic, but only a fraction of them auto-aggroed you. I basically got to places with lvl150 players and took their leftover loot, go through a 100F tower in stealth mode, or I would try to reach a boss I would only dream of seeing ingame, and die to it in one shot after getting a quick look at it (these late game stuff seemed to have higher quality animation than beginner stuff.

Assumptions are that you don't know how many mines are left because there's a few stuff on the opposite side of the board, but it's (somehow...) worse than what you see in the image (Like, blocks completely surrounded by mines. Let's say there are 3 of them. And you have 6 mines left.), so it's better to take care of this part now.

The reason about this is I'm doing a series of test playthroughs with the [Minesweeper Risk Calculator tool](http://mrgris.com/projects/minesweepr/demo/player/) that was posted in this subreddit a few times, because there's a WR that apparently completed a 24x30 board with 226 mines.

Which I'm calling bullshit.

^(btw, the Risk Calculator also keeps track of the ""Total Accumulated Risk"". Every time I completed a 226 mine board, no matter how I do it, it always ended up with such a high number that it rounded up to 100.00% before some of the board is even cleared. I'm estimating at least 200,000 absolutely perfect attempts required before you can actually clear a 226 mine board.)

Anyway, there's an image of the WR cleared board (no video, just an image), so I'm thinking of taking different starting points and see if this is in any way just some lucky RNG seed spawn.

Also, should I make a post about efficiently solving minesweeper? It's actually an entirely different world there. I hate trying to go fast in minesweeper, so I've started looking into guessing and calculating risk and gain. I started like 4 years ago and I'm still not done yet. It gets very complicated.

Oh btw, here's the ""answer"". It doesn't really matter if you look because your answer should NOT look like this. Still better if you don't look at first. http://i.imgur.com/FYXCZCV.png

I'll give the exact probability in the comments soon.

There's no reason not to exploit this. There's a bit something that gets completely changed if we do this. If we want to get 25 areas unlocked with least picrites used. We'll assume that farming dailies takes about 3 minutes, that you need 3470 picrites total, excluding the 50 picrites on the way to profit from having a 3rd party slot. I did a terrible job approximating this, but you'll spend only 1130 minutes farming picrites for dailies.

But then there's a new limiting resource here and it's no longer picrites. 1200 minutes means 1200 energy, and you need way more than 1200 to reach 25 areas unlocked, right? And that's considering that you only took the fastest path to the end of each area AND that you Revealed/Hyper Scanned/Auto Fixed X at 0 energy immediately when your pokemon recharge. You can go about this a few ways, just use 10 picrites each time you run out, or upgrade to infinite energy with 650 picrites total. Or you could level up once or twice with 100 picrites or 250 picrites total, which makes your 10 picrite energy recharge x1.5 or x2 times better per use. (Using 250 picrites to upgrade seems like the best idea atm without doing calculations.)

So what I want to figure out is, how many picrites can we get exactly from missions and medals at each specific point just before we would unlock our 5th, 9th, 13rd, 17th, 21st, &amp; 25th area? Then we just need to consider that we get 150(?) picrites at the starting tutorials. To do this, all we really need is if someone who unlocked these areas to list all the mission objectives and mission rewards, how much energy each puzzle costs, and what puzzle(or 1 of 2 puzzles) we need to unlock to access another puzzle.

With this, we should be able to figure out when we should spend energy to get picrites (by finding a X energy per picrite, or epp, we shouldn't spend above at, which I believe is somewhere below 40epp), and when we should spend precious picrites to energy for the sake of time.

After reaching 25 areas and getting the max possible 13 picrites per daily, it'll be simpler from there. Probably just farm the rest of the needed picrites and spend them all on energy, pokemon slots, the mega pencil, whatever.

After all this... we'll be limited by the mythical pokemon rate, totaling at least... 170 hours? Note that you'll get 10200 energy in that time, so you want to spend picrites if beating the 170 hours is possible. Unless there's a way to exploit the internal clock, going 10 minutes at a time, to speed this up, the fastest completion time is probably that. At worst case scenario, the pricrites needed would be 4000+ and that's still around 20 hours, way less than 170.

tl;dr: We can figure out a way more efficient route using the daily exploit, and right now, I believe you *might* want to upgrade your energy twice to 250. Unless you must spend more than 400 picrites to get 16000 energy in the long run, in which case, it's worth just using 400 picrites for unlimited energy.

Sorry, if this turned out a bit disjointed. Also, I hate this game. And it's horrifying how much time I evidently spent on it.",PokemonPicross,Should we make a new guide/route taking the Dailies exploit into account?,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonPicross/comments/44o5jv/should_we_make_a_new_guideroute_taking_the/

So it starts with the fact that nobody has to die. And yet there are 3 people I can count who we couldn't save (excluding the 6 souls. I'd say they're saved when they're freed from the containers).

**Asriel**: He comes back for a moment but it's said he'll turn back to flowey again. I've seen plenty comments about wanting to save him.

**Gaster**: I don't need to list down everything people did to the game to find anything that could lead to him.

And there’s **Chara**: But there's no sympathy for this kid, at least not in the game.

The other two have a more physical problem, but Chara seems to have a mental problem that existed either since birth, or some time before she fell into the underground. It might as well be figuratively ""since birth"" for us, since we know nothing about them before they came to the underground.

The point I will make with Fault Milestone One is pretty much all within the demo, so I recommend you check out the free demo. FM1 is a story that begins with a princess and her royal guard running from an attack on the capital by escaping using some teleport magic. They end up in a place where there's no magic and is run by technology and capitalism. They have to find a way back home to fight back against the mysterious foe. There, they meet **Rune** who awkwardly introduces herself and wants to introduce them around town. In exchange, she wants to know what the world outside her town is like. Milestone 1 is mainly about the mystery surrounding Rune.

Demo Spoilers: In the past, there was a kid named Rune Zhevitz, daughter of a CEO, [who seemed to be a completely different person. She stabbed a kid in the eye with a stick, cut up wild animals with scissors after school, and after 6 years of pretending to be reformed into a kind, innocent girl, she poisoned her mother, Elise, to death as a test. She then uses the same poison to kill about 10 more people. Her dead body was later found in the ocean. All this leads to her father, Cid, to go from capable CEO to a shut-in at his lab. Rune was sadistic and a habitual liar. People question if she is even human, some even calling her a “hellspawn”. And here's the important part. There was a MRI brain scan and it revealed that she lacked a part of her limbic system that regulates emotions.](#spoiler)

Quote from the Demo: “[I feel like a blank canvas, every waking moment of my life ...until I've brushed it with the pain of the living, stained it with the purest blood of the heart, and captured the very essence of sweet, euphoric death. All the 'pleasant' memories with our family mean absolutely nothing to me. Natural or not, observing death's will is the only pleasure I derive from life. If only you understood the beauty behind the sweet sound of a death rattle, and the spastic contractions of rigor mortis... If only you knew how fulfilled they make me feel!](#spoiler)""

---
Full Game Spoilers: As for the rest of the story, [Rune's father commits suicide after building a mysterious, impossibly human automaton that seems to look just like Rune, but she seems to act more normally, and lacks some memories. Of course, nobody believes this. And since it's just a robot, the company plans to dismantle and study it, rather than keep a possibly psychotic magic robot in the company building.](#spoiler) Our main characters figure out the whole story and go to Rudo, [Rune's brother and current CEO, to convince him against dismantling Rune. They figure out that her father built the current Rune using her memory mana from her dead body, using a method based on Path-Down, a ritual the main character's royal family line use to directly transfer all the ancestors' experiences to the next in line. He sacrificed himself to make the automaton so Rune can redeem herself through her 2nd chance at life without her congenital disorder, and so the two siblings can stay together.](#spoiler) And as you can easily see on Fault Milestone 2’s steam page, [Rune becomes their 3rd party member in their journey back home.](#spoiler)

""Just because she's devoid of emotions doesn't make her any less human! It's our heart that makes us who we are!"" - Cid Zhevitz

Next paragraph includes a quote Elise made at the end of the game. I had to include this because I feel it said the point better than anything I ever could. Don't read this if you haven't read the whole VN already. There are even some videos online if you can’t buy it or something.

Final quote from the game: (talking to her husband) “[After Rune died, several regrets stacked up in my mind. I wished I never gave birth to her. I wished that I never met you.](#spoiler)  Most of all, I wished that I had never fallen in love with your ambition. Those were the sort of regrets that overwhelmed my mind. But truth be told, I wouldn't have done it any differently. I love you all too much to give any of those experiences up. [I couldn't even think about living a life without my dear daughter. Regardless of what she did to me, I still would have chosen to bring my one and only daughter into this world.](#spoiler) Nothing made me feel more fulfilled than becoming your wife, becoming a mother, giving birth to Rudo. And even though the world as we know it may [never forgive her for everything she's done, I was glad to have given birth to Rune. I'm glad that she was able to experience life... for as long as she did.](#spoiler)"" - Elise Zhevitz

There's all this ""nice Chara"" fanwork, and it's refreshing after all the unsympathitic depictions. But Chara was the kind of kid who laughed at Asgore when they poisoned him. They used Asriel to go kill humans, whether their motive was to open the barrier or if it was ""for fun"". They don't even have a troubled past mentioned, if there is one. 

But they’re just a kid! I’m certainly unwilling to give them full responsibility for their actions. I just need to know that *something* made them the way they are, even a birth defect, and that's enough that I'm willing to feel sorry for them. The fact that Chara could be so evil makes them so tragic. Not someone who is misunderstood, but who misunderstands the world. Who was so unhappy they wanted to disappear, and is willing to kill all monsters and human.

I honestly don't know what Toby was trying to say by making Chara as an evil, genocidal character with no known motives or redeeming traits (a kid at that), cleverly tricking us into giving them our name, but then making them a separate entity to the player. But I can at least see, playing the game, that this emotion is not what he intended. And if I’m supposed to hate them, I reject that.

I posted this before, but I kinda deleted it a bit after, so I'm posting it again. Hope that's okay. It's late night here, so hopefully I didn't make a bunch of typos or stuff.

Sorry for such an ""english essay"" (making simple comparisons), but this wasn't just ""making bullshit comparisons between two games"" for me. Characters like these are something I've been hugely invested on, and I felt nobody else understood Chara in this particular way. I mean, not many people probably played both this game and that VN.

So I made a partial TAS of Blockdude and now I'm doing the rest, so I can say I made a TAS at all. I feel this is way more complicated that it is. I *think* each button press needs to be separated by about 6 frames for some reason except one button which takes 8 frames before allowing me to input something next. So I've been manually counting frames to add each action...

And then there are all these red rows and I don't really understand what they are, but I guess they're supposed to be when I'm not allowed to press anything or the game wouldn't respond. When it gets annoying is when these red rows overlap with a button press, requiring me to wait a frame to press another button. So 6-&gt;7 &amp; 8-&gt;9. And then there are long stretches of the game where I have to do some repetitive action over and over again and if I copypaste the actions, I would have to align all these button presses so they avoid red rows and I swear I made a mistake of moving a 7 frame to 8 or 9 to 10 instead of back to 6 or 8. Maybe if there's a way to detect these... It would just be easy to have one action per frame, even if the game would have way less fps.

BTW, do a lot of games have variable framerate or something? The fps seems to move around close to 20fps, but I wonder if that has something to do with the problem.

Finally, when I have multiple strats, is there an easy way to try both, starting from an identical savestate, then compare the two side-by-side?
