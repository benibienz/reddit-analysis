Been single for 6 months now, and have been getting rejected pretty much constantly since. I tried apps like tinder, but I got almost no matches and the women who did match me were very overweight and they didn't respond to my messages anyways (fitness is my thing).

I work as a software developer, educated, very fit(gym 5 days a week) and have friends and a social life. I am kinda short though 5 foot 9. What gives?

I will include pictures of myself, maybe its looks??

My girlfriend of 6 months is amazing. We love each other and she is not very affectionate with her words but she shows it physically. 

Anyways she has quite a few guy friends who she has slept with and more she hasn't. But this one guy named Chris, she claims is her best guy friend out of them all. The problem is she has had relations with this guy before, like a FWB type situation. 

I told her at the start I had no problems with her hanging out with her guy friends while I was not there. But when she said she had previously had relations with this guy before it made me uncomfortable - they text etc. The other day she texted me saying she was going to a restaurant, with ""Chris"" to eat and have a few beers to catch up. She did not mention if I wanted to come, even though I live a 5 minute walk from this bar.

Guess my question is, is this normal behaviour in a relationship? She knows it makes me uncomfortable, but gets mad when I bring it up. I don't think she would cheat but it makes me feel ill thinking about it. Am I just being a controlling jerk or is this normal??

edit: she has cheated before, twice actually with 2 different guys, but says she told them immediately. She also told me that, which I have mad respect for her for telling me. She has been very honest.

I am not too experienced dating and I have fears revolving around it. One such fear is falling in love with a girl who is not physically attracted to me, and is with me for personality alone. I have a very loving, bubbly and outgoing personality and it has gotten me far, but I really need to be physically appreciated by my partner to feel happy. I am very physically fit with a slight bodybuilder look to me, but lacking in facial aesthetics maybe just average. 

I have brought the fact that she doesn't compliment me up 1 time very briefly as I do not want to come off as needy. She quite literally has never commented on my appearance once. She said that she find its awkward when I brought it up previously. 

She has mentioned too that her ex boyfriend who she was with for 6 months was quite unattractive, which I fear I fall into that category.

I am a single man (24) who is quite lonely at the moment. I have lots of friends(male ones) and am a very sociable person. I live with 2 of my best friends, who I have grown up with and known all my life. We all have our own sub set of friends in which we all bring by the house regularly. Its not this basic male companionship I seek, its an actual relationship with a woman. I have issues with getting close to women, probably because my parents had such a fucked up relationship/divorce. 

My problem is that I cannot, for the life of me, find someone who wants to date me, and I have no idea why. My gut reaction tells me its my looks that's holding me back(will post pics at bottom) but then my logical side kicks in and I realize that I cannot be that unattractive. I have a good job in a STEM field, I am educated, have a bright career ahead of me, go to the gym regularly and the most important is I meet tons of women! My living situation has set me up to meet loads of women, but the women are not interested, show very little interest in me.

My question is, what the hell could be my issue?? Any thoughts of advice is welcome. Here is what I look like, in case you wanted to see.

Long time lurker but haven't had the need to post anything yet. I have tried noopept, aniracetam, phenibut and phenylpiracetam. Aniracetam gave me a slight boost which I noticed when I took it with coffee or a stimulant, gave me decent mind boost to help me with my programming.

I got LiftMode phenylpiracetam as well as their noopept product. I took them both at the dosages most people recommended. I pretty much got nothing from either of them, that is, until I snorted some of the phenylpiracetam and then I got a massive surge of energy and focus combined with my coffee. 

It seems this is the only way phenyl works for me, but its not something I want to continue doing as its not socially acceptable especially at work.

Any ideas?
