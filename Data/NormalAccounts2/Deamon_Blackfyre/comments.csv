17,"&gt;That's myopic. Marxism is hardly the only threat to a free society.

No but it is the largest one at the moment IMO.

&gt;Calling Trump ""radiation"" for the tumor of Marxism is a little too on the nose. Radiation is absolutely destructive, taking the bad and the good. I'm not sure you wanted to use that metaphor.

Ehh chemo is more destructive than radiation, but yes I agree. IMO Trump will do less damage than hillary and might shift the overton window to the right a bit, or at least slow it's shift to the left. The key is to suppress the left. We would be having a entirely different conversation if Gary actually had a snowball's chance in hell of winning, or if the LP would have nominated someone who is actually a libertarian.

&gt; Also, is it a threat to Marxism? Marxists don't trust markets and neither does Trump. Maybe you just mean ""cultural Marxism"" because he gets angry when people don't say Merry Christmas?

They are one in the same. The goal of cultural marxism is to shift the overton window to the left so right wing ideas are silenced. The communist elite, in particular Trotsky realized that there was no way that you were going to have a ""peoples revolution"" in the west after the failed attempts in the 20's and 30's. That was how cultural marxism was born. You slowly slip marxist ideas into the society you are trying to take over until you wake up one day and you are living in a communist country none the wiser for it.

&gt;Trump is in many ways anti-Enlightenment and anti-classical liberalism. I'm not sure why a betrayal of our principles is just the thing we need to fight for our principles. 

You can't get there from here. You can't create an ancap society directly. There has to be a transition phase. the time preference is so high in a democracy that the bread and circus is working for now. One of two things are going to happen if Trump is elected. 1. 4 years later, nothing changes, and people start to realize that working inside the system isn't working. 2. Trump actually accomplishes something and people realize that it takes an outsider to fix the problems in washington. Either way we win. Trump is the peoples last hope in the system, if he cannot fix things the masses will be shaken to their core.

&gt;Trump is ""pro-America"" in the sense that a nationalistic fool is - distrusts foreigners irrationally, thinks they're always tryin' get one over on us with their sneaky, inscrutable ways

Yes because things have gone so well with with the muslim migrant problem. Importing people in mass who do not share in our culture or value set is just so successful. IQ tests.

&gt;doesn't understand the merits of trade, thinks we need to have the biggest, baddest, toughest, most threatening military, that we can be the ""best"" just through the sheer force of his awesomeness to make deals and rule with an iron fist.

Between trump and hillary which one has said that other countries should help pay for their own defense? Which one is trying to start a war with russia with rhetoric and a no-fly zone?

&gt;But pro-America is not pro-western culture. A lot of this is very much anti-western or, at least, anti-libertarianism.

America was founded on the principal of ""classical liberalism"" which is basically the root of libertarian-ism. What america is today is not the principles that america was founded on. 

&gt; I really don't understand the argument that it's enough to throw up a strongman who's really disdainful of foreigners and thinks he can 'make the country great again' on this throne, and consider this in any way an affirmation of western values and culture.

Nobody said it was enough. But it might be a start.

&gt; It's an affirmation of a culture that I don't like and that doesn't represent my libertarian principles. It's a different kind of threat than HRC poses undoubtedly, but it's a threat in its own right. 

Burying your head in the sand is not an option either. It is a shitty choice, and I would much rather have trump than clinton, and I can't vote my conscience with Gary, who is basically a republican that likes weed with a democrat that likes weed as his running mate.

It is about knowing the highways. if you are traveling down a ladderwell, leave a strobe or a guidleline there, use a jumpline off of that for going into a smaller room if need be. 

Here is a video of John Chatterton from 1991 where he gets into some of his navigational methods. When we took his wreck class he mentioned that after this video they started running guidelines down the ladderwells because someone got lost in one, but the other parts are still very relevant:

This is where you and I will have to diverge in opinions. Wrecks are manmade. They have blueprints, they have rhyme and reason. They are laid out so people can move through them efficiently. Building a relationship with a wreck is important, studying the blueprints and understanding how and why it sunk are all critical to this relationship.

24,"Nope. I learned from John Chatterton and we learned how to use a guideline, but it was tought as one of many navigational aids to use on a wreck. It is actually frowned upon to use guidelines even now on some wrecks, such as a u-boat. If you run a line inside a u-boat someone is going to cut it to get a laugh and prove a point.

The way I heard it from people who were actually there, the Rouses died because they were not deep air divers. They did not have the hundreds of dives at 230' on air the other people that they were diving with had, because the majority of the deep dives they did were on mix since that was already being used in caves at the time. This one weekend they could not afford mix so they dove air. They did not know how to manage narcosis properly so when they had a stress situation the narcosis overwhelmed them and they panicked.

25,"Relying on a single piece of string as your only link to the world is just as dangerous if not more so. People are way to dependent on guidelines. If you are using a guideline as your sole means of navigation on a wreck and it breaks or is cut how fucked are you?

Instead I use multiple means of navigation when I am on a wreck. I study the deck plans, get the lay of the wreck during recon dives. what direction does the wreck point, what depth are various decks at? Are there tactile aid that can be used in a silt out such as a handrail, that runs forward to aft, and since I when I entered the handrail was on the left, when I leave it needs to stay on my right. Or do I know that I entered through the forward torpedo loading hatch, which means that I am in the forward torpedo room, and the only direction you can possibly go is aft? 

If it is appropriate I will lay a line, but there are many situations where it is completely unnecessary due to having other more reliable navigational aids available or due to the fact that you are exiting a different route than you came in. 

U-853 is a perfect example of this. Laying line is completely pointless and causes an entanglement hazard. There are only two directions to go, and you are exiting a different hole than you came in which means that you need to go back through the wreck to get your line at the end of the dive.",2016-10-13 03:18:49+00:00,d8psbtu,4,t1_d8pro15,1018,scuba

27,"This is incorrect. Most east coast wreck divers that dive 80 do their switch at 30ft, but do their last stop at 20-25ft due to waves/currents, drift deco in heavy boat traffic areas, or the positioning of the carolina rig. If is near impossible to do a 10ft stop around here, and when your last stop is 15-20 at the best 80% is the better gas in most cases.",2016-10-13 02:44:34+00:00,d8pqyn3,8,t1_d8pgw63,14572,scuba
28,"lol. You have never dove off the east coast? 3-5ft seas with 2 knot surface currents are not uncommon in the gulf stream. Combine that with a carolina rig that is not perfectly at 20ft makes using O2 more hassle than it is worth in most situations.  If I dove O2 for my deco gas I would end up doing my whole deco off of back gas because most of the boats off NC do not have a safe way to make a constant 20ft stop. 

The 1.6 MOD of 80% is 33' BTW. Most of us those use 80% on the east coast do our switch at 30ft, but do our last stop at 20-25. It is not uncommon to be bouncing 3-4 feet around on the anchor line  unless you bring a 12ft john line to make up for the wave action. I dove with some GUE guys on a 130ft dive a few months back, and they were diving 50% instead of O2 while the rest of us were diving 80% because of the boat and the seas. But they also had computers, so maybe they were blasphemers? They did have the matching color coordinated t-shirts and hats though?

This whole thing that O2 cleans you up faster is a such a edge case, it only really worked when you are talking dives less than 100ft. Run some plans with 80% vs O2. Even when you don't account for air breaks once you are deeper than 90ft or so 80% is faster if you are just doing a single deco gas.",2016-10-13 02:37:52+00:00,d8pqojw,5,t1_d8pgbab,14988,scuba

Depends on where/what/how/who he is diving. Context is key.   

&gt;You're not wrong, equipment can fail for inexplicable reasons. But what is the likelihood of it happening. If someone has limited resources is training or supplemental gear more important? 

Again context is key. If he is diving relatively deep depths regularly then those equipment failures happen enough to matter.

When I took my rescue class years ago, I loved it. It is great and useful information. However the core take-away is really ""don't let some idiot get you killed"" that is why I always sling a contingency bottle. If some idiot swims up to me out of gas, or panicked I am going to push them away, hand them my contingency, and wave them good-bye.

Sling and stage bottle valves should be closed until needed, so in an emergency you have to open the valve anyways. This is to prevent freeflows. I have seen it happen several times where divers staged their deco bottles on a wreck, come back, pick them up, hit their switch depth and find them empty. 

It only takes a sec to open the valve, and if you followed proper procedure of charging the reg then re-charging after you hit the water  you have at least one breath in the LP hose to give you time to get the valve opened enough to get air.

2. Sling it. http://www.dir-diver.com/en/equipment/stagebottle_rigging.html
3. Charge reg before dive, turn valve off, crack valve open then closed again after submerging. Valve stays off until needed.
4. If not doing tech dives, breath your pony reg at your safety stop.

Have you ever seen a LP hose come unscrew or fail during a dive? I have. You do not have that much time before you are out of gas. Now imagine that you are towards the end of a dive 130ft, you only have 1000psi left in your tank and are about to ascend the line. Your LP hose blows, bubbles are everywhere completely obscuring your vis, you start breathing harder, fight or flight kicks in, do you think you have enough gas to either find someone elses octo or make an ESA before you drown? The answer is ""I would rather not find out"".

Redundant air is always a good thing to have, and there is no such thing as bringing to much gas. If I am diving a mixed boat I always bring a contingency bottle for the idiot who runs out of gas. For some reason they always swim at the guy with the double 120's on his back when they run low on gas. My back gas is for me, if you are having a problem you can have my contingency or drown, and I really don't care which choice you make.

The only reason why people think that computers dive them more bottom is it accounts for changes in depth. However, if you run close to your NDL without making appropriate conservatism changes you are dancing with the devil. Both the haldane and Navy tables that are popular and used often were published after doing extensive trials using pretty fit navy divers. The Navy tables considered a 5% occurrence of DCS acceptable, so the NDL's and deco times published on Navy tables were the numbers where 5% of the divers got bent. Why? Because Navy dive ops have a chamber right there. They were most concerned about getting the dudes out of the water as fast as possible. Bend them, and fix them is the rule of the day.

I don't know about you, but I don't consider myself as fit as a navy diver and I sure as hell think a 5% occurrence of DCS is not great gambling odds. Also remember the more gas you breathe the more you are on-gassing. Tables and computers do not account for that.

TL;DR Read about your computer's conservatism settings and use them if you plan on bumping up against your NDL.

EAN32 has a EAD of 107ft, with a po2 of 1.58 at 130ft. NOAA tables give you a 20 minute NDL at 130ft for a single dive with 46% of your daily CNS limit. The soonest you can enter the water for a repetitive dive to that same depth and a reasonable bottom time within NDL would be 8 hours later. By that point your oxygen clock has really worn down, since the rule of thumb is that your CNS halves every 90 minutes. 

So you see the very nature of the NDL prevents most dives that could run into an issue for the sport diver, assuming you don't do something really dumb like breathe 40% at 130ft for 20 minutes.

There is no reason to ever penetrate a wreck without a redundant gas supply, and excusing reckless behavior because someone is a DM or an instructor is even worse, because they should know the risks. That is like saying ""I have driven drunk hundreds of times, and never killed anybody, but it's ok because I'm a cop."" 

As a DM or instructor you are responsible for the divers in your group, and any issue with your group is your problem at the end of the day. I was on a drift dive in cozamel a few years ago, and a diver ran out of gas halfway through the dive. The DM gave the OOG diver his octo and they continued the dive for another 10 minutes. I guess because he is a DM, this is something that is ok to do, even though it violates every standard out there?

Entering an overhead without redundant gas is against every agency standard I have ever seen. As an instructor, you are expected to know the standards. If he is not a tech instructor then he is violating standards by leading a dive outside the level of his training and certification. If he is a tech instructor he is violating standards by not having a redundant gas supply, and leading divers  that I am assuming do not have a redundant gas supply either on a wreck penetration that they are not equipped for. In the US at least, if someone were to die on a dive like this the DM would be charged with manslaughter, or at the very least reckless endangerment, and it would probably stick because he violated standards.

Except for the fact that certain other cultures do not believe this. It is just like communism, on paper it looks great, but when another culture is actively trying to destroy yours you just don't allow them to do it.

&gt;And don't forget, if you want to be a libertarian, ""freedom to move where you want"" is a central part of that...that freedom applies to everyone including people from other ""non-western cultures.""

&gt;It is antithetical to libertarianism to want shut down open legal immigration.

Libertarian-ism is about property rights. You do not have the freedom to move wherever you want. If a property owner does not want you move onto his property, or to cross his property, then you cannot ""move where you want"". 

Public spaces and ""legal immigration"" are a construct of the fact that the state claims a monopoly on violence in a certain geographic area. As long as the state exists all efforts must be made to stifle the flow of people that want you dead into your geographic area.

&gt;I do believe people saying hateful shit though can get a punch to the face, I don't feel sorry for them one bit. Actions have consequences, if you're an ass, expect to get treated as such.

So you don't believe in free speech, thanks for making my point about you pieces of shit destroying western culture for me.

&gt;You also have alt-right types like Sargon of Akkad literally starting petitions to get college campus courses on social justice banned, yet we're the ones that want to censor?

The right reacting to the bullshit that is SJW's, never would have guessed. Colleges are public institutions, that receive funding from taxes. Therefore the alt-right has every right to try to suppress something they disagree with when it is being paid for by their taxes.

&gt;People like white supremacists and rape apologists aren't guaranteed a platform for their hate filled nonsense. I guarantee you if someone ever talked like that to my family, I'd knock them the fuck out. It's verbal violence, and yes, verbal threats and attacks can hurt psychologically as much as a physical attack.

It is called freedom of speech. If I come on your property and say something that you disagree with, you have every right to use whatever means necessary to remove me from your property. But what is said on other people's property or a public forum falls under free speech.

&gt;Trump is the one instigating the fights by telling his supporters to get into fistfights promising them he'll pay their fines and medical bills. And what do you think is going to happen? 

Last time I checked I don't see Trump supporters crashing (((bernie saunders))) rallies. If you showed up to my private event and started a riot I would have you physically removed too.

&gt;You think the Latino community is going to love him when he's advocating building a fucking wall and closing the borders even more? That's not an anarcho-capitalist position.

It is an anarcho-capitalist position. I have the right to say who can and cannot come on my private property. If I don't want Mexicans or muslims or anyone else for that matter on my property I can physically remove them. Unfortunately right now we have this monopoly on private property called the government, and until it no longer exists I think it is smart to exclude those who are actively trying to ruin our society from this geographic area.
