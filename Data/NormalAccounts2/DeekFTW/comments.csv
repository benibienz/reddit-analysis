3,"Never put links to episodes of a let's play series on reddit. If you have a tutorial video or something like that then you can get away with linking to the content. But a series will usually be downvoted immediately and even worse you can end up looking like a spammer to the regulars of the subreddit if they keep seeing you post link after link to episode 4, 5, 6, etc.

If you're doing a creative game like Cities, you can take screenshots and post an imgur album to the subs. Then link your series in the imgur descriptions or in a comment replying to your reddit post. You aren't going to get as much traffic to the videos doing this as opposed to just linking the videos but I've noticed those that care enough to click the link embedded in an album are going to be genuinely curious about what you're doing. These people will be more likely to subscribe to you. Plus you get the added benefit of people upvoting your album if you're doing good work which increases visibility of your post.

SEO helps not only for search results but also for suggested videos. Properly tagging your content will help YouTube suggest your video on related content.

My concern is how often they can keep this up. Are they going to drop a new series on us every time the items in the crate drop below 1 key per crate? Because that's going to happen really fast now that they are only adding one series instead of two (albeit it is adding to the existing crate pool). That said, there is only one import body in this new series whereas each of the last had two which means it's more likely to get the Breakout every time you open a C3.

209,"I'm fairly new into the esports scene myself. I sometimes hate the comparison of Rocket League to the other big esports games like CS:GO because this game has a different aura around it. This game is much closer to a sport than it is to a video game. I personally believe Psyonix needs to look more at the real world sports and take influence from what they do. 

If you look at the NBA for example, they build their league on the power of their superstar players. Rocket League needs to do the same. Kronovi, Paschy, etc need to become household names within even the casual RL scene. If you get those players to a point where everyone knows them then you're going to have people tuning in to see the tournaments to see the best players in the world compete to see who comes out on top. 

Eventually with time, the game will create history for itself. You'll be able to see which teams are statistically the best and where they sit amongst the teams of the past. These story lines will become the fuel for the RL esports fire.

That's why it was so interesting to see all of the moves around the pro teams after RLCS season 1. We now have a new context to season 2: who made the best ""off season"" moves and who will be able to dethrone the standing champions? 

I'm really hoping that Psyonix can get the right people in place to make this happen the right way. I seriously think that this game can become the biggest esport of all time. It has huge potential because it is such a viewer friendly game. You don't need to know the complex strategy behind playing it to enjoy watching RL and because of that you can get the attention of people who might not even be gamers. That's something very unique to this game as opposed to the other esports out there now. Build those players within the game and we'll be able to expand the esport scene beyond anyone's imagination. I wouldn't be surprised to see Rocket League on TV within 2 years. In fact, I'd be very disappointed if it wasn't..",2016-09-18 20:48:55+00:00,d7s8zf9,3.0,t1_d7s4pu5,5197.0,RocketLeague

211,I've been saying this since the first RLCS season. They need to build the pro's into household names if they want to explode as an esport. Think about all of the casual players that probably don't even know that there is a huge pro tournament happening right now. If they utilized the game menus to showcase high level play I personally feel like they could suck a lot more of the casual fans into watching the tournaments and maybe even inspire some more people to play the game a little bit more hardcore than they might have otherwise.,2016-09-18 04:57:17+00:00,d7rfzgh,1.0,t3_53agw0,7554.0,RocketLeague

&gt; Now as a party, they most definitely likely deserved Challenger III. That doesn't mean the individuals do, as the skilled player still belongs in Allstar, and the lower skilled player belongs in Prospect II.

Then why have party play available at all? It just seems useless if the system is only focused on finding an individual's true MMR.

Where is the incentive for a lower ranked player to play with a teammate of higher ranks? Likewise, where is the incentive to play with lower ranked people unless they are truely at your rank it just isn't reflected in the game (due to lack of play time or whatnot)?

I've seen it suggested that there should be a team oriented ranked playlist where everyone creates unique teams with a roster and the team gets it's own MMR.

315,"The issue isn't the roster changes themselves. The issue is that there isn't a good place to follow these changes. You said it yourself, the average viewer isn't going to know who went where or which team has outright disbanded. 

Roster changes aren't inherently bad for Rocket League the esport. In a way they could actually be really good for it. People are going to buy into the drama of one of the best players in the world leaving one team to try to form a superteam that will try to take down Cosmic, for example. Then they will watch the tournaments to see if they can pull it off.

Psyonix needs to create a way that people can see these changes and get a beat on the pro scene. I personally think they need to do this in the game menus somewhere. There is no reason I, or any other player who is at least a little interested in the pro side of this game, should have to go out of our way to see what is happening around the leagues. 

Look at the NBA (or any pro sport league) as an example. People will go to their site to get stats and standings but the thing that will keep them around are the articles that showcase the story lines of the league. People love drama and they love a good underdog story. Unfortunately, there is not a good way for a majority of the RL player base to know of these story lines at the moment.

Rocket League will grow as an esport if they can perpetuate these story lines the right way. Create a story that is too good to not tune into the tournament to see unfold. The money will come especially with the crate system but the real draw will be to see the players compete to find which team is the best of all time.",2016-08-29 13:59:27+00:00,d716vqn,1.0,t3_504p0w,6521.0,RocketLeague

There is a randomness in which player connects to what room. 

Now is this randomness statistically relevant? Over time perhaps not. Statistics will tell us that the more matches we play the closer to the true map distribution numbers each account will get. We cannot know for sure unless we had real data to study. But this is hardly an irrelevant argument. If the distribution across all players is even then we have a fair system.

I actually talk a little bit about this in my latest video. I'm playing a river heavy map currently and just the other day I was down by a river so I was noting things that I saw. A lot of this game comes down to how realistic you can make your creations look. For example, not a lot of the buildings in the game have any parking associated with them. Building parking lots near commercial zones gives the area that look of something that would actually be in a city.

Another cool thing to do is to just go look at Google Maps to get ideas for road design. This is another thing that I did to help me get over a creative block. We're given this blank slate of land and are thinking ""this is going to be a residential neighborhood"" yet it can be hard to get started on it.

482,"&gt; which suggests that if one of your videos is not clicked on by a large amount of subscribers, YouTube will not serve your next upload to a significant portion of your subscriber base

I don't understand this logic. So if only a few subs click on my video today then tomorrow's upload will not be shown to a majority of my subscribers?

How are subscribers seeing my videos then? Because when I go to YouTube to consume content I go to www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions which displays all uploads from all the channels I'm subscribed to in sequential order. This feed is not selectively showing me videos they think I will watch.

A lot of this article is looking at correlation but doesn't do a great job at determining causation. There are so many factors that go into people watching content that cannot be accounted for. For example, day of the week is a large factor for many people. I've noticed that on my channel Fridays are usually terrible days to get views on a release. 

We'll never truly know how the algorithm works. And even if we get close, YouTube will change it up to keep people from gaming the system.

509,"The best advice is to learn SEO and produce quality content. After you start logging a bunch of videos there becomes a point that your videos will market themselves a lot better then you can push your marketing efforts onto other places like Reddit or Twitter. Make every episode of a let's play a new entry point to your channel. You can and should tag each and every episode uniquely to give it the greatest chance at visibility in searches. It is also important to create unique content that people will be looking to find. That is the hardest question of them all: ""what will people be searching for?"" Truth be told, no one really can know the answer. Sure, a bunch of people will look up ""[Game Name] Gameplay"" but you will never be able to rank on a top page dominated by the big guys. You need to find a unique search term that you can compete in and try to dominate it. 

Also my advice to small channels is to not kill yourself in editing. Putting 4 hours into recording and another 5 into editing a video that is a general highlight style video is a total waste of time in my opinion and you'll get burned out quickly. Your highlight video is never going to compete with the NerdCubes of the world and it is very hard to SEO that type of video for a search that small channels are capable of ranking in. Try to keep focused and find a way to let people find you through search. I'm not saying editing is bad but over editing is something that you can grow into later if that's the style that you are going for. Minimal editing in the beginning is fine to keep the episodes moving. Note that I don't know if you are doing this highly edited style that I'm referring to but I thought it was worth a mention.

My other advice is the generic quality over quantity. A new/smaller channel should never be putting out more then 1 video per day. You can even get away with 3-4 videos a week as long as the content is good. I still don't put out a video a day and I've been doing this a year now. I just don't have time to keep up with that kind of schedule. It looks a lot better to people who stumble across your channel if you have less videos with more views on them then a ton of videos with basically no views.

524,"You kind of are on the right track to answer your own question. Stand out. There are plenty of run of the mill channels out there. They do the same thing that most of the other channels do. Highly edited content that is hilarious, or so they think.

The key is to differentiate yourself. Don't expect to be able to play the same games that all the large channels are playing and grow and audience based on personality alone. You need to do something different then what they all do. Don't get me wrong, you *can* play the same games. In fact, you *should* play games that people are actively searching for. But you need to do something unique. 

I love to play games where I can build things. City builders, tycoon games, etc. So when Cities: Skylines came out I decided to start my channel. I did a series that was pretty run of the mill at first. So I pulled the plug on it and did something different. I have been building a city with only one way roads for 100 episodes now. This concept was so interesting to people that if I mentioned it in passing on a forum most people would ask me for a link to the series.

Even deeper than that, I saw a small opening in a niche market. Most people who play creative games like Cities or Planet Coaster are usually one of two people:

* Designers who make really nice works of art but aren't strong commentators

* Are funny/interesting but can't build anything to save their lives

I wanted to fall somewhere in the middle of that group. Be interesting and compelling, create a back story for my creations and such, but also be able to design things that people would consider well built. I try to keep this channel direction in mind when I go in to produce and record an episode. My commentary is still a work in progress but it gets better with each episode's practice.

So my advice to you is simple. Find a genre that you enjoy and are good at and then find your niche. You need to produce content that if you tell someone about it they cannot help but ask you for a link. Create content that people can find in the search results. ""Cities Skylines let's play"" will never yield my channel but ""[cities skylines metropolis](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cities+skyliens+metropolis)"" puts my channel in ~7th position.

Start out focused. Attract people through your niche. Grow organically. Once you see an audience start to form then you can leverage that into branching out your content's reach.

And finally, have fun in what you do. Going in to this with the ""it's easy to be the next 1 million sub gaming channel"" mentality is going to beat you down and make you give up. It's not easy, it takes a chunk of your life away by the effort that it requires, but damn if it isn't rewarding to get your first sub.. 100 subs.. 1,000 subs.... If you aren't in it for the love of it then you should get another hobby.

Good Luck; Have Fun

It sounds like starting a channel could be a fun hobby for you but you shouldn't go into this only thinking about the money. By all means, let the money be an inspiration. Use it as motivation to get better. We'd all love to be able to make money doing what we love (playing games) but you can't go in expecting to make a substantial income in a short amount of time.

* How can I be successful with a gaming channel?

* Why would people want to watch my content?

* How can I strategically grow my channel and gain consistent viewers?

* How can I make the best content that I can make?

These are the types of questions that all channels need to ask themselves. The revenue will come in due time. If you connect with an audience you can even supplement the dipping CPM rates by fan funding your efforts through Patreon or donations.

YouTube has always boiled down to the content. The people who make the most unique and interesting content at the highest quality will always float to the top.

It isn't every day that someone goes ""I want to find a new YouTuber to watch. I wonder if there is a site to help me out."" Usually they just type in the game that they want to watch and pick from the top content creators that show up because they know that their content is going to be high quality. 

You'd need to add a benefit to using your site vs searching on YouTube. I don't know if there is a plausible answer to that predicament. If you could come up with a good way of suggesting channels based on the channels that they already enjoy it may help but YouTube already tries to do that. Not to mention they have more access to behind the scenes data to make a more informed suggestion then your external site would ever be able to do with an algorithm. 

Maybe the answer is to set up a rotten tomatoes style of rating for channels and then get the creators to direct their viewers to go rate them. The problem there is that the creators won't care enough to get them to go do that. They would rather just send viewers off to more of their content.

In the long run, it sounds like a good idea. There have been many people who have had a similar type of idea.

562,"&gt; I wonder what the real value of branding is on YouTube. I don't mean that antagonistically. In terms of real numbers, what is its value?

Unfortunately it is hard to put a tangible analytic on this for YouTube. My argument has always been in regards to someone sharing you via word of mouth outside of YouTube. Unfortunately there is no ""word of mouth"" statistic found under the subscribers tab. Another way to maybe look at this is to think of the people you are personally subscribed to. Think of one person off of the top of your head. If that person came to mind almost instantly then they might have either a really catchy name or have correctly branded their channel to you and over tens, hundreds, thousands of videos of theirs that you have watched you can now instantly think of not only their name but probably their logo if they have one. On the other hand, has there ever been someone that you wanted to show someone but couldn't quite remember their name? Odds are they haven't branded correctly. A lot of this gets back to choosing a good name for your channel but in the end that's a big step in the branding process. But, like you said, it is hard to tangibly present the concept of branding. Especially on YouTube. 

After working for a company who has what I call a ""branding identity crisis"" where customers have literally gone to competitors because they couldn't remember our name, I absolutely believe in branding from the time you launch your channel to the time you end. I've seen branding so bad that it works against you. Even if it's hard to quantify I believe it is still worth focusing on.",2016-05-09 22:24:02+00:00,d2z6bfq,6.0,t1_d2z4fzs,2780.0,letsplay
563,"&gt; what objective value does the intro give to the viewer and/or the video?

An intro isn't going to add much, if any, objective value to a video. I've never once seen an intro in a gaming video and thought ""wow that intro was spectacular, now I can't wait to watch the rest of this video"". But to counter that point the intro isn't supposed to be there to do that. It's supposed to be there for branding. But it needs to be able to do that effectively without driving traffic away from the content. I think in the climate we see now on YouTube, with the attention span of viewers getting smaller and smaller, an intro that is longer than ~5 seconds isn't going to do anything but harm you, especially as a young channel. 

&gt; The premise, as originally stated, was an intro that is ""separate"" from the video (as in, it's a branding message only).

I guess my view of an intro is defined as any overlay that is put in the beginning of a video (which is why I think we're having this debate). The intro that I use starts as the typical ""intro video"" taking up the full screen but quickly transitions to a hybrid overlay/content mix. I've never seen any issue with my retention nor have I ever had any complaints from viewers on the intro. Maybe because it isn't exactly an intro per se, but instead a glorified title overlay.

If OP is seeing that significant of a drop off *before* people are even getting into *content* then clearly something is wrong with the intro. There are better ways to go about getting your branding to the audience, as you said. I will just always feel like some effort toward branding you videos is better then not doing anything. 

PS: It's nice to be able to intelligently debate a topic on Reddit. This isn't normally the case.",2016-05-09 21:15:11+00:00,d2z3i3c,4.0,t1_d2z28g7,1757.0,letsplay
564,"&gt; So, the real question I'd ask of you, and anyone with an intro, is what purpose does the intro serve the viewer?

An intro makes the video feel like it has higher production value which will help you to seem more legitimate to a viewer. It feels like you've put some hard work into your content and, as a viewer, I would be more likely to respect the work that you put in. It also gives each episode a starting place so it doesn't feel like you just cut three hours of footage in half and posted it to YouTube.

 &gt; Also, if the answer to the first is, ""branding,"" then it still needs to go.

I disagree. You need to build branding from the launch of your channel in today's environment. You need your viewers to know who you are so they can share you with their friends if they wish. Getting your brand into their minds is the difference between them saying ""I watch some guy on YouTube"" and ""Have you ever watched Deek on YouTube?""

You contradict your point here a little bit by saying ""a small overlay at the beginning of the episode while the actual content is playing is one way to do things"". Is that not an intro of sorts? 

I totally agree with your point on binge watchers. They do not want to see the same intro over and over which is why the shorter the intro the better. I even go a step further to say using music in an intro isn't a great idea. Music will be the thing that people will pick up on and can get annoyed with quickly.

There will be a lot of people around here who will tell you not to use an intro at all but I am in support of an intro strictly because of branding. That said, the intro needs to work for you and not against you. If you want to keep the ~11 seconds of intro then I'd suggest putting a clip at the very beginning of the video to draw people in. I prefer not doing that so the intro I have is ~2-3 seconds long and transitions into the content. This is just enough to get my branding in the viewers head but short enough to not drive them away.

567,"Sure a dynamic isn't as sensitive but that also means it isn't picking up every frequency within your voice. Condenser mics pick up a wider range of sound which will make the recording sound ""fuller"" in the end. There is a reason that professional recording studios use condenser mics over the dynamic mics. If you want to go for quality then you want to go for a condenser. You should also try to treat your room accordingly but I understand the external noise factor is out of your control. I made the switch to condenser when I found a deal on a Tascam TM-80 and the quality jump was extremely noticeable. 

If you want to use a dynamic mic for your recording situation then go for it, to each their own, but I cannot support the statement ""do not recommend condenser microphones"".

As for it taking longer to see the content I would maybe have to disagree. They remove a lot of clutter on the screen so the focus is going to be your content. There is no more sidebar with distractions in the face of users. The new banner will take up more room but people will scan over that fairly quickly since there isn't really anything they can interact with in that space.

I'll agree that an mcn with higher requirements is more appealing then one that takes anybody but I'm still not looking to join one at the moment. I really don't feel like joining one will benefit me any more then going out and getting better as a content creator on my own. 

If a sense of community is what you are looking for then you can always build one up on Twitter. I've followed a bunch of my favorite people from this subreddit and we frequently like to talk shop about YouTube and content creation all while complaining about ridiculous stuff we see on reddit. 

Would I ever consider joining an mcn? Possibly. But I struggle to find the benefit. I haven't found one that would really give me something I couldn't create for myself. The only one that comes close is the social blade network because they have their site and can promote network videos on it. The only issue I have with them is that the requirements are so low that the network videos they have promoted are absolutely awful content and that diminishes that whole feature in my mind. Curse would probably be my top choice because of the no lock in contact and revenue split but again, is hard for me to justify at this point. Maybe they can offer protection against claims but with the recent changes to that system will that still be a benefit in the next few years? Plus with the kinds of games that I tend to play I really haven't gotten a claim yet thus far.

There have been people who have said that uploading more frequently helps your content rank higher in searches but I haven't seen anything from YouTube that supports that. What they mean is that when you upload on a consistent schedule your subscribers will begin to expect a video every day and they will be waiting to watch those videos upon release. When your subs start to watch your videos on the day they are released then that will start to push the videos up the search ranks. It has nothing to do with release schedule and everything to do with viewers watching and engaging the content.,2016-04-26 18:21:36+00:00,d2i8p8h,2.0,t1_d2i62b1,3276.0,letsplay

654,"Looking at your channel it seems like your descriptions are all one sentence and then a link or two. Most of your videos have no more then a couple tags. YouTube works algorithmically so it sees a description with less then 70 characters and then a link or two so it flags the content as suspicious and then the system hits you with whatever form response it is programmed to send. Your lack of tags and content for YouTube to read is exactly why you get the ""untargeted"" party of the message. It essentially looks to them like you are posting lots of videos without trying to target your content while trying to get people to click on the links ""to learn more"" on an external site. 

Your content is actually of really high quality! You just need to start filling out more of the meta data. Look into teaching yourself SEO and use that description to it's fullest potential. Many experts recommend using most of that 5,000 character limit in the descriptions along with the full amount of space allotted in the keywords. 

Good luck! Also, when you are able to, start using scheduled videos instead of unlisted. It helps to make sure you subs will get the video in their sub box when it is released.

I've actually completely discontinued using annotations in favor of cards. Cards work across both the desktop viewer and the mobile app. According to my analytics about half of my all time views have been on mobile or tablet devises so annotations actually aren't going to get to half of my viewers. Plus, cards are way easier to use from a creator standpoint (everyone has fiddled around with the annotation editor for way too long..). They are a little less versatile then annotations but I think the pros outweigh the cons. I've heard they will eventually discontinue annotations and complete the push to cards but we'll see what happens with that.

I always recommend having vocal calls to action toward the end of the video. Saying ""remember to like this video if you liked it and dislike if you didn't"" and ""be sure to subscribe if you aren't subbed yet to watch any future content"".

Once you begin to gain a following your viewers will push your content up the charts. You just need to get that initial following first. This is done through a number of ways whether it be social media marketing, seo, or simply getting friends to start to share your work. There is a formula to this madness that we call YouTube. Not everyone will get to use the same ingredients but if you know how to work with what you have and make it work to it's fullest potential then you will see success. 

If you look at all of the biggest YouTube stars you will notice one thing that they share between them. They all have some sort of personality or persona. This is what people latch onto. Why do viewers watch Person A's video over Person B who is playing the same game at the moment? Because they like Person A's personality and commentary. 

Success on YouTube has many different factors involved. No factor is ever equal for the most part. This scenario simply doesn't happen. Ever. Create your own luck and good things will come.",2016-03-28 22:59:44+00:00,d1gylx8,1.0,t3_4cbr3u,12230.0,letsplay

I'm sure when this game gets released we'll see posts around here that say something like ""130mph fastest coaster album"". I'm just thinking that Frontier could put something into the game to cater to what people will ultimately end up wanting to compete for in the end anyway.

The best thing to do is to look at the viewer retention and see if there is a definitive dip off at some point in the video.

Never let anyone tell you that ""you should have X amount of subs by now"". Channel age means nothing in YouTube. Personally, I look at Views to Sub ratio as a better way to judge a channel.

The data is extremely interesting. The link is to basically raw data with a page that also has some rough calculations involved. There is no real statistical analysis on the data because I am/have been unfortunately too busy to sit down and try to run regression and correlation tests. If anyone wants to do so go ahead and share your findings. It would be interesting to see how people's classifications change based on their own channel. It is also important to note that this data hasn't been purified at all either. Typically we would want to go through and remove any duplicate submissions and take out any exaggeration (or in internet talk: troll) answers. This might skew the results a little in the calculations tab.

There are some really interesting answers to the final question of ""Do you think subscriber count is a sign of a successful channel?"" question. Be sure to check those out in the raw data. It's also interesting and extremely relevant to this subreddit to look at the results for both the ""On average, how many YouTube videos do you watch per day?"" and ""On average, how long are the videos that you watch?"" questions.

This was a fun little survey. I hope we can all get some use out of the info at hand!

Then you have r/letsplaycritiques which was spotty if I remember correctly. I don't think that's a very active community over there. You can always ask for a critique over on r/partneredyoutube but the advice over there will generally be along the lines of ""don't do a gaming channel, it will never work for you"".

The best way to gain fans and subs is to go into the communities for the games that you play. DO NOT LINK YOUR CONTENT. Instead, become a part of the community. I play a lot of Cities Skylines so I've been a part of the r/citiesskylines since before I even started YouTubing. I like to discuss the game and sometimes I have the opportunity to bring up my series. Sometimes people will ask me for a link to my series because it sounds interesting. That's when I give them a link to my content. If you are looking for the fast and easy way to grow, there really isn't one.

934,"The word you're looking for was *organically* not *naturally*. There was a time where all you needed to do was throw up a video and the subscribers would come just solely because of the fact that your channel was there. Today's climate has changed that. There is so much more competition that you need to make content that stands above the others. 

No, you don't need a large marketing budget to pour money into ads to become a success on YouTube. Most stories that I've heard from people advertising their channels through paid campaigns have resulted in empty subs and no real bump in engagement.

One of the big reasons for that golden era was the emergence of Minecraft. It became the biggest game in the world and the gameplay was a perfect fit for YouTube. I'd predict if we saw another game hit that potential then we would see another LP bubble. 

The best thing to do is to learn SEO and let your content do the work for you. Once you build up a sub base from your videos you can then leverage those views to start to compete for those top spots in the broad searched that are dominated by the Pewdiepies. The best example I've seen lately has been Draegast aka u/jynxedkarma. He'll tell you that effectively leveraging SEO is key for anyone's success. 

You will continue to see the top talent emerge over time. The top let's players will eventually retire which opens up their spot. It's just harder to do today than it was a couple years ago. ",2016-02-21 21:49:05+00:00,d08j3cl,1.0,t3_46x9ha,2765.0,letsplay

That's usually because of the subscriber base. When your subs are going to watch every upload you post and you can guarantee your video will reach 10k views right off the bat then SEO won't matter so much. That's because the YouTube search algorithm takes into account things like watch time. The larger channels basically don't have to worry about tags at a certain point because they know their fans will push that video to the top of the search results.

On the other side of that interaction, you want the name to be unique enough for someone to look up and find your channel without needing to go through a hassle. 

But I would agree with you somewhat. The name is definitely not as important as making quality content. If you make things that people want to watch them they will share your channel regardless of what your name is. ",2016-02-20 16:00:47+00:00,d07422v,3.0,t1_d06zdua,12473.0,letsplay

What I mean is people will be more likely to leave if they don't like you're intro than they would if you just didn't have one at all. That being said, I personally love my intro. It's perfect in my opinion. It gets my branding out there without me having to start every video ""hey it's Deek back with another blah blah blah"". The key is to have something that isn't intrusive that flows into the content. That's why I borrowed heavily from NerdCubed. A lot of people say a 5 second intro is what you should use but I say shoot for a 2 second one. A 5 second one should be the maximum. I saw a channel yesterday with a 20 second intro.. are you serious? Why would anyone want to sit through that? They don't.

998,"You make a good point in that it was probably more out of necessity than anything. Although if you think about ice hockey for example it was a game that started outside on frozen ponds and rivers. People had fun playing it so games went from casual to more and more competitive. The more competitive the games got the more players wanted to show that they were the best of all the other players. The only way to do this is to strip out all other variables and try to boil it down to skill vs skill. That's why they ended up playing in a standard regulation size rink. 

In a sense, Rocket League is starting just the opposite. The game is played in a standard arena where your skill beats my skill. We are playing the game in it's purest form. When you start adding in other maps that emphasize specific facets of the game you diminish the ability for players to rank themselves among others in the overall scheme of the game and in the competitive world that is what matters the most. 

Don't get me wrong though. The variety in maps is very welcome in my mind. You're right, it is a virtual game where the world and it's laws of nature are completely invented. There are no limits. The variety of maps will indeed keep the game fresh and enjoyable for the players.

MLB Stadiums is a really good counterpoint although the game of baseball is a very rigid format (each player resets to position every pitch) where I would compare RL more to hockey or soccer which are all played on the same field (or slight size variations of the same template). 

What it comes down to for me is, when looking at RL in the grand scope of things, what will people want to talk about after a tournament? What will bring people back to watch more of this esport? Pro sports gives the audience something to easily talk about by stripping out all variances of gameplay and boiling it down to one thing: player skill. This player or team beat this player or team straight up given the same circumstances.

1002,"&gt; Rocket Leagues needs variation for better storylines and compelling matches.

I disagree with this. Variation can make for storylines but I think the thing that should make storylines in a game like Rocket League is the players and teams themselves. Look at sports in the real world. Most pro sports have been played on the same field, arena, rink since their inception. The thing that makes people come back to watch every year is the team and the players which they root for. There are storylines in Rocket League already. Just take a look at you guys for an early example. The first few big tournaments Cosmic ran away with. The storyline became ""these three are the best team in the world, unbeatable even."" Then you guys eventually fell in the finals. It was a huge story. David beat Goliath type of headlines. That's what makes Rocket League very interesting to me. Not what team plays better in Map X and who plays better on Map Y but rather Team A beat out Team B in a stripped down show of skill.

The real question is how to compel these types of storylines to an audience. I personally think it's on Psyonix to come up with a way. Either through setting up a website that is the definitive all spot for everything professional Rocket League or something else. However it is done, the storylines will be on the players and they should perpetuate the tournament popularity in the end.",2016-02-05 21:32:53+00:00,czpat0m,2.0,t1_czp9o2a,1644.0,RocketLeague
1003,"People really need to stop comparing this game to other esports game and start looking at it akin to actual sports. I've been saying it since the beginning, the more complicated the maps are the higher learning curve a **viewer** is going to need to tackle in order to enjoy watching the game. The game in its ""standard"" map form is a pure sport style game that is easy to watch to nearly anyone, not just gamers. 

If the gaming industry wants to grow esports into to the mainstream public the games that are broadcast will have to have high view-ability and spectacle (something that isn't possible in real world sports). Rocket League is a spectacle. It is not able to be replicated in a real world setting. The standard maps allow anyone who has ever seen or generally knows about the concept of soccer to understand what the game is as soon as they see Rocket League for the first time. 

League of Legends is arguably one of the largest esports games at the moment but to people who don't play the genre the games look cluttered and confusing which is a huge barrier to viewers. Rocket League can very well be the game that brings esports to the forefront of mainstream media. I've been saying this ever since I bought the game. People who don't play RL can understand the difference between highly competitive players and the run of the mill player.

If I were in charge of the esport division over at Psyonix (which I would love to be) I would be pushing to keep competitive play in the standard arenas. In this argument it is not about what the *players* think is best. It is about what is best for the *viewers and audience* of the gaming tournaments. You need the casual viewer to be able to walk away thinking ""that Rocket League game is very fun to watch"" and want to come back to see the next big tournament.

This is huge. Don't feel obligated to like everyone here. A lot of people aren't going to be doing something that you will find enjoyable. Find people who have series that interest you. Try to look past anything that might be due to their inexperience (video quality, poor audio, nervousness).

&gt; 3.) If you're not interested in their content, leave a nice comment telling them how they can improve, but do not subscribe unless you intend to mentor them.

I'm not entirely sold on this. There is some degree of this that can be helpful but I would say that instead of mentoring them on let's playing, instead try to contribute to the series in anyway you can. Leave suggestions about the gameplay or whatnot. This is way more encouraging to a let's player than ""you should buy a better mic"". These types of comments can come off as rude. Plus to other viewers that may stumble onto the series these comments mean nothing. If they see comments about the series itself they might be more inclined to add to the conversation themselves.

Larger channels partner up with networks to reduce the risk of losing out on revenue because of a fluke in YT flagging systems or whatnot. Networks will have a better line of direct communication to YT support and can handle and issues that arise. Many see networks as money hungry shells that will gladly take a split of your revenue but do nothing in return for you. It all depends on the network and on you and your channel.

I find his commentary forced and annoying but there are those people who love it, just look at his sub base.

My commentary is fairly laid back on my channel because that's the personality I have. I try to be compelling though. You can have a laid back style as long as you aren't boring. But just as I don't like Markiplier's style, there are those who won't like my style and that is completely fine. That's the great thing about YouTube.

Personally, I think it is important to have a sub base even if they aren't watching. The casual passerby may not want to sub to a channel with, for example, 78 subs but if you have 380 it makes it seem like your channel is more worth it to subscribe to. It's sad but there are people with this mentality out there. They want to know why you have 380 subs, clearly a bunch of people like this guy.

After you gain some experience and confidence and you feel you are ready to launch into greater things then you should worry about the SEO/searchability factor.

You can be the best SEO'ed channel on the internet but if the quality of the content is terrible you won't retain any of the people who find you. It's a nifty game this YouTube is.

All that being said, there is a purpose for those so called gateway type videos. The goal is to be searchable and hopefully shareable in order to bring new viewers to the channel. The trick is getting them to convert to subscribers that will actually watch the a let's play series. Would a top 10 video get people to watch me build a city? Probably not. But would a tutorial or tip video get them to watch? More likely though still not a guarantee. You have to be smart when you make these kinds of videos. Know who will be searching for them and whether they would want to watch a series or not.

1180,"I just hit 100 subs about a week and a half ago and am currently up to 121. I've branded my channel correctly since I started and have always made good quality videos in terms of audio/visual. Content wise I feel like I've definitely gotten stronger as of late but that is generally the situation with most channels. Up until now I've really only been running one main series and it's a legitimate let's play series (unedited, unlike what many channels here are actually doing). 

I feel like the key to my success so far has been interesting content. While my commentary has been meh at points the core concept of my series is interesting. I'm playing Cities Skylines and building a city entirely out of one way roads. This is a very easy series to promote because anyone who knows the game will know how challenging and different that concept is. I've heard people say something along the lines of ""that's a very interesting challenge, I'll have to check out the playlist"". 

Beside the content itself I am always trying to get people involved. Whether it be having the audience suggest names of districts in the comments or ask which tile to buy next I always try to give them something to talk about. This creates a community within my subscribers. I've seen a handful of people who are really, really enjoying the series and they want to help out as much as possible. I've also seen the people who just want to suggest funny names which I'm fine with, it builds character in the city.

I was actually just reading a great post about [gateway videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/3nlw9i/someone_told_me_to_post_this_here_im_not_a_lets/). The concept here is to basically make highly searchable content to get exposure and try to gain momentum that way. It is a tried and true method which I have done to a very small extent and honestly need to be doing more. Find a game that you are knowledgeable in and make interesting videos about it that aren't gameplay. For example, I made a video outlining the changes in a Cities Skylines patch and it's become one of my most viewed videos. That's because people look that kind of thing up. There aren't many people actively searching for a let's play series. To gain traction there you *must* promote it yourself. But if you make some great quality content that people will find on their own then you can hopefully turn that exposure into a meaningful relationship.

This is a pretty lengthy response but it is all pretty important. Just remember that success doesn't come overnight. I've gained over a quarter of my subs in the past two or so weeks. This growth is awesome but I know there is a large chance that it will not last. I know I just need to continue to make quality content to try to perpetuate the success.

1181,"Replying is big but if you can use comments in the video its even bigger. I play Cities Skylines so I always want people to name a district, building, park, etc. so it is really hard to go past a few episodes in advance. I've found that if you ask for suggestions in the comments early in the episode you will be more likely to get them.

1194,"&gt; In reality parks probably use admission because it's less stressful for the guests, you need less staff for selling tickets

I'd actually disagree with this statement. The IRL parks would rather people pay upfront for economic reasons. If you as a park guest needed to pay for each ride individually would you want to jump on as many rides as possible? I think many people might let their wallets decide what rides to ride and which ones to skip. Additionally, they don't care how long guests stay since they have a bulk of their revenue up front(This lends to the park not closing argument). But, IRL parks want people in the park as long as possible so they will end up buying concessions and play the games to win prizes later in the day (after the hefty price of admission has left their minds). This model has its limits though which is why we are seeing parks try to generate additional income from vending machines in queues and the passes to skip portions of the lines. 

Personally, I've always felt using the ""county fair"" model diminished my park in a way. After all, I did just build a beautiful *Theme Park* not a *County Fair*. I would always charge the admission and then use concessions to generate my additional income. I would usually hit a limitation in RCT2 because guests would spawn on the map with a finite amount of money outside the park. If you would set the price of admission too high they couldn't afford it and then would turn around and leave. 

I hope you guys can make the IRL admission model a viable option even given the game limitations on it. Let the player choose which path they want to operate on. It would be great if you could have guests take into account the entire park and the price of admission and then make sure they spawn with enough money to pay to get in!",2015-12-26 03:00:53+00:00,cybhk01,2.0,t1_cyauh4l,64340.0,ThemeParkitect

1198,"Watch time isn't really a great stat to gauge success from because it literally will add up the more people watch. The more important thing we need to be concerned about as a content creator is audience retention. I've heard anything over 25-30% is good for a gaming channel. I was just looking at this earlier. Last quarter I had a retention of 33% across my channel. This quarter is is up to 34%. Looking at monthly, last month was at 38% and this month is sitting at 36% so far. 

You should be checking this periodically because it is a good indicator of whether people are staying to watch your content or where they are leaving from in the middle. If you see a rise, you know you are doing something right. If there is a decline, you need to ask yourself why people are leaving and what you can do to improve upon that. You should also filter to see your subscribers only. This is the best indicator of the quality of your content. Your subs will (most likely) already like you and know what your content is all about. If they are leaving early then they felt something was not entertaining. 

If you improve on the retention numbers then the average watch time will increase as well. I can tell you that on one of my videos from my main series the average watch time was 5:39 overall but 12:57 among my subs. The length of that episode was 20:17. This was just a random example I picked out of the bunch. Is wasn't the video with the best stats but it was one of the more recent videos so it was a good one to look at.

1271,"It sounds to me like you want to go the route of Nerdcuded and the like: mostly one off videos that are heavily edited down. I think your question is a little misguided or maybe a bit unfocused. You need to look at what your audience is going to like best. They are the people that keep the channel going. So if your question is what type of content would help you grow, I think a lets play series can certainly do that. A lets play can be that constant on your channel while you produce the other montages and reviews. If you are looking to get your audience involved in your channel through the comment section then the lets play will give them that chance. Though I would think that the edited gameplay videos *could* help you grow faster because you will have a higher chance of hitting search results just out of the sheer number of games you have played and made content for but that method also has some drawbacks. The first of which is that you are going to need to have an arsenal of games at your disposal to make the content for. You are also going to be putting a lot more time into the editing and production phase of work. You are going to need to develop your style quickly in order to keep the audience you build interested in your content. For example, I follow Nerdcubed and watch most of his stuff but there are a few videos a week that I don't watch because I'm just not interested in the game. 

I think this issues is a strategic one and the solution is this: what do you want your channel to be to the viewers? What kind of viewers are you trying to get? How confident are you that you can support the work load of either content choice?

1291,"I agree with much of what you want in the game. The part about having teams that know specific languages might not make sense to implement in this game from a playability standpoint. The game is already incredibly deep and intimidating from a person who knows nothing about software development. Adding a coding language barrier would only make the game more frustrating for new users. I do agree that the training is OP at this point. It would be nice to have the education levels decay over time when the employee doesn't use that skill every day. It would also be nice to need to train the employee every time a new technology comes out. For instance once you are able to develop 64 bit OS's, just because they are trained all the way up wouldn't mean they necessarily know how to program for this tech, especially if they have never worked with it before. 

I also like your point about office drama. That would add a more dynamic HR mechanic that would keep things fresh. I always like employing young kids who are very well educated out of the gate. In real life these kinds of employees would be highly sought after by other companies. Conversely, you should be able to hire from other companies. And on that note, should we not inherit employees from companies we acquire?

This game is really deep as it stands but there are some issues with it. As you outlined, the game does become very linear after you have money in the bank. Design &gt; Develop &gt; Market &gt; Prosper &gt; Repeat. I think the brand issue is huge. If you build up a reputation for being a great game publisher and then you put out antivirus, the market should react to that.

Also one of my biggest issues at the moment is that if you want to sell some stock you may get the message ""no one is interested in buying this"". What? There is ALWAYS someone interested in buying stock.

As far as the pads flattening, I can't comment because I've only had them since March(?) but they haven't seemed to lose any padding as of yet. Coming from a music background, a flat response rate is excellent for mixing. It means your EQ's/hardware aren't influencing the outcome of the mix. That said though for a let's play it is important to make sure your final mix sounds good in computer speakers because that is probably what people are going to be watching your content on. It is good practice in general to listen to your final mixes on multiple devices/speakers to really get the best overall impression.

1305,"That's true but the standard maps are aimed at keeping all aspects of the game fairly level. A map with a low ceiling for example would favor ground play and not aerial work so players who focus only on ground game would benefit. In my opinion, the goal of a competitive sport should be to showcase players who have mastered the all around game not just certain elements. That's why the standard maps work so well in Rocket League. Now I'm not saying I am against putting nonstandard maps into ranked, I would just keep them in their own ranked ladder. That way players who want to play the ""pure game"" on standard maps still can and if players wanted to see who is the best at nonstandard play could. This would segment the player base though and the RL team has stated many times that they are not willing to do that.",2015-11-21 17:45:42+00:00,cx84r93,6.0,t1_cx7uz84,27516.0,RocketLeague

1314,"&gt; That's 60% of people that probably won't play these maps often if they are not included in rank.

I think the question becomes are we going to see that 60% number drop because the people are wanting to play the new maps. If enough people were to play new maps consistently for a long period of time it would be a decent indicator that they are having fun on them and would (probably) be open to including them in ranked. There was a good comment on here at one point regarding the learning curve of the game and they mentioned that the ""standard"" map at this point gives the most balanced play and thus should be exclusively used for ranked matches. I tend to agree but if a majority of the population were to devote a majority of their time to other ""non-standard"" maps would that not make them the new ""standard""? If the game of basketball were to be played on a round court instead of a rectangular one  by most people would that not render the round court the norm?

I also made a point once that most pro sports are played in a regulation playing field. This is because it showcases the skill of the players verse *each other* and not verse *the field*.

1352,"I think introducing strange maps into competitive play might actually be detrimental to Rocket League from an esport perspective. As it sits now RL is poised to make a big splash in the esport would because it has a very broad appeal. Anyone out there, not only gamers, can watch the game because it is familiar to them (soccer) but adds that video game element. When you start introducing maps that are abstract to the audience then they start to have less of a chance to actually watch the game because of the higher level of game knowledge needed to understand what is going on in those maps. 


I think the ""regulation"" playing field is needed to propel RL to where it can and really should be in the esport world. As far as the high skill cap being reached, how is that any different than real world sports? Why do athletes today play sports that have been around for decades even though the skill cap may already have been reached? They all want to win and they all want to be the best. That's what happens when you give all the players the same level playing field. Record get set and they get broken by the next generation of players. Storylines develop and the audience becomes attached to the players. 


While we as players might see the rectangular field as standard and maybe boring, the broad public will be able to easily understand the game. If we want RL to be the biggest esport in the world (which I truly believe could happen) then we need to play to an audience bigger than gamers. At least in the beginning. After the game has reached a broad understanding then introducing new maps could be a refreshing boost. ",2015-11-01 16:57:57+00:00,cwkj916,1.0,t3_3qyxjv,93967.0,RocketLeague

1373,"To start: I think your video thumbnails are good and your channel avatar isn't bad. Your channel banner could use a little work though. Moving on to your videos: the audio quality isn't amazing but the video quality is pretty good. I think your mic is suitable at this point though but it at times sounds like you are far away from the mic. This could be because of the room you are in or because of the quality of the mic, I'm not sure. I think one of the big reasons that no one is finding you is because of the games that you are playing. Call to Arms is a game that I have never even heard of. Banished had it's moment at least a half a year ago. Now, I'm not saying these games are bad to play (they both look fairly modern and interesting) but to get those sweet, sweet subscribers you need to get into search results. For example, I am playing Cities Skylines as my main series right now. Not that impressive right? Well I decided to challenge myself in the game and make a series out of it. I decided to make a city completely consisting of one way roads and I named it One Way Bay. Anyone searching ""cities skylines one way"" or the like will likely find my stuff. One big piece of advice I would give anyone just starting is to be uniquely searchable. Do something interesting in a game that if someone were to stumble upon it in a search, they might watch and stay interested. 


Another big point is to market your content outside of YouTube. I recently did some cleaver marketing in the Cities subreddit and netted about 12 new subs. These are all people who I know are into what I am playing. You should get involved in the game's communities and on social media to help drive new views and subs.


In the end though, it is all about your content. You can have the best audio/video quality, top notch branding, and SEO sent from the YouTube headquarters but if the entertainment and involvement factor isn't there to make viewers feel interested and a part of a community then they won't stay around long. Personally, I feel like you need to come out of your shell a little bit and work on creating content that grabs me as a viewer and draws me in. This comes in due time and through practice. Three weeks of commentating on videos doesn't make you a pro. A good exercise I tell people to do is to go look up your favorite big name YouTubers out there and watch their first few videos. They really aren't great videos at all. Use this as encouragement! Look at where they are now as opposed to where they started from.


I know you don't want to go crazy into editing and I don't blame you at this point but you want to try to be as compelling as possible to keep people interested. As someone who knows nothing about Call to Arms I could have used some insight into how the game is played and what we are doing in the video. If there were one simple tweak that I would make it would be here. Try to put more emphasis into your intros in your videos. Keep in mind that if you are into a series that people will probable already know what is happening but also try to make every video stand alone in the sense that anyone could pick one up and continue watching from there. Call to Arms looks very interesting to me, but I don't really know what the objective is here (I watched part of the #4 video). A quick recap of the last video and an explanation into the goal of this video would be nice.


But in the end, if getting views and subs is what you want then you need to make searchable content that people will latch onto and want to subscribe to see more of. For example, this could be as simple as making a Call to Arms strategy video. This will get people in from search hopefully and then maybe introduce them to your series. If they like your personality and commentary then they will stay around and watch/contribute to your channel. All in all, 3 weeks is WAY too early to judge success. I know you may not want to put time into editing video and whatnot but I would look at it as put out the best possible content you can at the moment and people will enjoy it as opposed to if people find my stuff and enjoy me then I will put more effort into the content. There is a ton that goes into growing a channel and I hope some of this helps out a little. This subreddit is a really awesome resource and I encourage you to use it as much as possible. I really didn't mean for this to come of in any offensive or elitist way if it did, I'm only trying to help.

I've noticed that if I write up a creative little story in the description for a video using good SEO focused phrases and words it helps drive views. Retention numbers may not be great because some people might just drop off but if you hook just a couple of those viewers in they might subscribe to you and better yet go back and binge watch the series to catch up.

Just jump right in and record a video. If it is really bad then don't put it up. It might take a couple tries before you feel confident enough to release something to the world. I recorded about 6-7 episodes of a series that never ever made it to my channel. I used them to learn about recording's technical side and how to make commentary that doesn't suck. I mean, my commentary is far from perfect but I took notes (and still do) while I edited and look them over before the next recording session. This is how you get better. They say it's all about practice. That's because it is. You aren't going to be the next PewDiePie in your first month of recording. But the more you do it and the more you get comfortable with it and find your unique personality the easier it becomes and the more people should start to like what you're doing.

For example, I've seen a few really big channels that aren't necessarily the most entertaining people but since they are extremely good at building a city in Cities: Skylines they have grown because people out there like to watch them create these beautiful cities. Another example is Kronovi on Rocket League. While he isn't a let's player, he is a streamer on Twitch. By streaming standards, he isn't good. He isn't over the top, he doesn't look at the camera with stupid faces, and his commentary isn't even aimed at the audience. But since he is arguably the best player in the world in that game people tune in to watch him play the game. So is it possible? Yes. Is it viable?

1594,"I've done some promotion with AdWords. Not a video ad but a sponsored search result or the ad on the side of a video in the related video section. It's really all about how well you target, providing your content is good enough as an end product. For example, I put together an ad for my [7 Things you Didn't Know About Rocket League](https://youtu.be/qlJDhzwZwbQ) video. I only set the total budget of the campaign to about 5 dollars. You need to really set up your targeting in order to get meaningful conversions. For example, I wanted only people who played Rocket League to view this video because that's who would be interested in the content. Someone who is looking up gameplay or a review might not be a player and only players will want to know what they don't know about the game.

So I set up a target group of people in the US, Canada, and the UK because they most likely speak English. And I targeted key words that people who play the game are likely to search. Things like ""Rocket League easter eggs, Rocket League tutorial, Rocket League glitch, Kronovi"" are all things that people who know the game and the community would search.

In total there were ~2,500 impressions, 94 views at $0.06 CPV. Here's what is really interesting though. Of those views 76% of the people who clicked watched 75% of the video and 48% watched the entirety. Half of them watched the whole thing. That is either good or bad depending on your personal retention but for me and showing the video to random people and getting half of them interested enough to watch the whole thing sounds pretty good.

If your ad is popping up everywhere (untargeted) then the chance that somebody will watch the video in its entirety is extremely thin.

1687,"Personally I prefer a no BS intro. No music, quick, sweet and to the point. Thus I have [my intro](https://youtu.be/qlJDhzwZwbQ). It flows into the game really simple and easily. I don't need to worry about how to start it off or what to look at to make the intro look good while I'm recording. 

The pro's of an intro slot are that it helps immensely with branding and it gives the video a beginning. It doesn't look like you just threw on fraps and tossed the video up on YouTube. It gives your audience the sense that you know what you're doing in terms of production value and polish. 

The big con is that if done improperly, the intro can spoil the entire experience for the viewer. No one want to sit through a 15 second animated title with dubstep blaring in the background. 

Though it's not a necessity I would suggest having at least something to put up there. Keep it short, like 2-5 seconds max, and keep it simple. You don't want to make the viewer think too hard about your introduction. Good luck!",2015-08-10 22:28:28+00:00,ctyhf8b,1.0,t3_3gi6xp,8394.0,letsplay

I might also consider a subtle gradient to keep it a little more interesting.

1759,"In the NHL games I've played they have made me watch sponsored videos in order to receive pucks for one of their game modes. This is intrusive. EA doesn't get slack for billboards because of their excessive use of microtransactions they seem to love so much. You can buy a pack of pucks (which is their currency) for real money in order to buy card packs which may or may not contain good cards. This puts players who only wanted to pay the $60 potentially at a disadvantage to the player who paid $90. 

Microtransactions that give players advantages to non payers is bad,  paying $4 for a new car body that doesn't effect gameplay is fine. Putting display ads in a stadium is fine.

You just want to fill up the time by talking through what you are doing in game. Creating backstory for a character or explaining your strategy or even pointing out something funny that's going on. 

I noticed a few little um moments while watching my episode back in editing. I like to make notes of what I did in a notebook and then read the notes before recording the next session. The more you practice the better you will get. It's all about getting over the fact that you're essentially talking at a computer screen and not a person and learning to riff with yourself.

1811,"I only had time to check out the 90 second video unfortunately but here's my thought: 

If you are going to use this as a channel trailer I would cut it down. I would probably take it down at least to 45 seconds. The beginning of the video had me but it felt like it dragged on the father we got in to it. I would say you should pick just a couple of the very best highlights that showcase your style and keep them short. Maybe a good joke or a funny reaction or two. Keep it moving and keep me, the viewer, interested enough to want to subscribe. Then you need a call to action. Maybe an outro that says thank you for subscribing or something along those lines. Maybe in your introduction you hint at what your subscribers have come to know Soliloquy as. The subtle subscribers name drop hints at clicking that little red button. Your production quality seems pretty good which also helps when a viewer is considering whether or not to subscribe.

The first thing that I noticed was the banner art. I know what you were going for with the lightning but I really had a hard time figuring out your name for a few seconds until I looked down. I would have made the lightning bolt a bit taller to look more like a Z. Also the bar running across the top of the first few letters throws me off a little too. I would maybe break up the line with a small 2-5 pixel gap that outlines the A maybe? Hard to explain but something about it is throwing my eyes off. Maybe it's the top part of the E going farther out than the rest of the E?

I noticed that the popular uploads are at the very bottom of the page. As a viewer that hasn't subscribed to you yet that is one thing that I look for right away. ""What has this person done that others have seemed to like?"" I would move that to either the top or the second slot under the trailer.

As far as the end slate goes, there's something about how the name of your channel looks at the top. The colors contrast a little too much maybe. You could probably fix that in photoshop by adding a slight blur to it (maybe? I'm no expert at PS).

Make people feel like they should be interested in your content and then you will get them to view. It also helps to do videos that are more than just Let's Plays. Think of how many YouTuber's you have subbed to because you found them through a tutorial or something completely unrelated to what they typically do on their channel. And always remember that building an audience is a process. If you have quality stuff, the people will find you eventually. ",2015-07-09 02:47:00+00:00,cswzi4x,1.0,t3_3cmcyg,6484.0,letsplay

I think we will probably see something like a few new public transportation options (bikes, taxis, trams maybe) and maybe some big element to the game. There has been talks of adding a culture type system into the game. That would be really cool depending on how they do it. I also think they should fix tourism and add things like tourist specific buildings/zones. Entertainment zones with a boost to tourism ratings for buildings and the ability to place casinos would be neat. I also think they need to implement sports into the game. A city should be allowed to be ""selected to receive a sports team"" based on some sort of criteria. The teams could also effect city culture points if they are good or bad.

Coming from a music background, I already had a M-Audio XLR interface so I was set. I see your mic is USB. I'm not sure how a USB powered condenser mic is going to sound but it should be a significant improvement over your headset. 
The only thing that I was going to recommend is to get a pop filter but it looks like you have that in your plan. You'll be surprised how great a condenser mic is going to sound compared to your old setup. But as a warning, this mic will pick up everything in your room. You can drop a coin across the room and this thing is going to record it in crystal clear audio. You should probably sharpen up on your audio editing skills (ie. noise gates and compression) but a simple search of how to optimize a voiceover in YouTube should help out a bit.
One last note is to know how to use your new condenser. Some people don't even know how to properly set it up to talk into. Here's a [quick video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr9uG4cqD4E) to help if you aren't familiar.

The problem with a free form approach is that if you guys aren't entertaining with it, no one is going to tune into another video in the series. Being entertaining is something that no one can tell you how to do but if you record with your friends and in the editing room it turns out to not be good material, you are probably better off not posting it.

There are tons of people who put up highlights with commentary that is nothing more than them yelling ""oh my did you see what I did there?"". People will want to see highlights but you also need to keep them coming back. Doing a career mode or a gm mode and showing through your commentary that you know what you are doing will keep people interested and help you grow within that niche. 

Using mass appeal games is a great way to help new viewers find you but unless you want to keep putting up the next popular game, I would say try to find that niche and if that's where you're comfortable keep with it.
