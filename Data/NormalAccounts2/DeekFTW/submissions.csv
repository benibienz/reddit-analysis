It's Deek here. You may know me from my channel or from around r/letsplay. I've been around here since I began last June and have always enjoyed this community. At one point I noticed that it seemed like every couple of days we got a new ""Leave Twitter Handles Here"" type thread so I decided to create a [Twitter list for this community](https://twitter.com/DeekFTW/lists/r-letsplay-community-list). This list has become a really helpful thing for people to easily network with other members from this subreddit. It is really nice to be able to read all of the tweets from the r/letsplay community in one spot and be able to choose who you would like to follow based off of what they have to say.

I thought I'd make a post to inform anyone who is not on the list but would like to be how to get added. If you want to be added to this list simply hit me up on Twitter [@DeekFTW](https://twitter.com/DeekFTW) and let me know to add you! Please feel no obligation to follow me back on Twitter or to subscribe to my channel. This list is for the greater good of this community, I am not looking to ""profit"" from running it. My schedule for the evening is to sit back and edit a few videos for the week so I should be fairly responsive to requests today. For the sake of my sanity I usually only add people who tweet at me so please don't expect to leave a comment here with a link to your Twitter and get added to the list. 

I really enjoy seeing everyone being so supportive of the list. I always seem to find someone who is commenting about it to anyone asking how to network. I appreciate that all of the work I put toward maintaining it isn't going to waste.

Last week we saw a number of good surveys posted here in r/letsplay so I've decided to design one myself. I want to see how everyone defines channel size on YouTube based on subscriber count. It will be very interesting to see what everyone's definition is and how the answers correlate based on the size of your channel.

This survey is actually set up so even a person who doesn't have a channel can take it so you can share it with anyone if you wish . It would be really interesting to see how someone who only watches YouTube defines these channel categories as opposed to someone who is a content creator themselves. Remember, the more data that is collected the better it becomes.

I've been coming up with my tags first because they seem to be easy to brainstorm on the spot. Then I try to work those tags into my description as much as possible. By doing this you are giving your video that bump in the searches that you want to see the video perform well in.

There are many other factors at play here of course but I figure this method may be better for anyone struggling for what to write in their description. It is recommended that you use up as much of the description and tag allowance as possible to try to be able to be shown in as many search results as possible.

* How often does this game get updates, being that it is in early access?
* Do updates break the save files? I know some early access games do when there are updates.
* This is more open ended but are you having fun with the game? What do you like/dislike about it?

I've been recording a Let's Play of C:S and recently got an interesting comment from a viewer saying the episodes feel a little long. I'm fairly new to the whole YouTube game so I'm still trying to refine my style. I try to keep episodes around 20 minutes or so but in the past couple the episodes kind of dragged along. There was stuff going on but it just wasn't entirely fast paced.

Now on to the question:

Would you as a viewer rather watch a ~20 minute video that is edited down so there is more action happening or would you rather watch a 10-15 minute video where every part of the build is included?

I know that I would rather see every minute of the game so we see how far we've come with the city build but I'm wondering if the public opinion is the same.

At this rate I'm just thinking of not telling them until someone stumbles on to my channel haha.

I've noticed a few people here say ""my first few subs were my friends"" or ""my mom was my first sub"". I'll be honest, my first sub was the account that I usually watch YouTube content on. But after that I've found ~17 people at this point that enjoy what I'm doing. It's truly an awesome feeling and an even better hobby.

A special thanks to this community(r/letsplay) for feeling like a family. So in a sense maybe I have told my family what I'm doing. I'll continue to find great people here and continue to share what I know and discover with you as long as you promise to do the same with me.

There has been some great advice floating around on here so I figure I would make a short list of some of the best pointers that I've seen so others in my shoes can get the same feedback that I have gotten. Feel free to add your own in the comments and upvote any that you feel are the most important for people to see. This is going to be a relatively longer post but if it even helps one person then I feel alright writing it:


**Production Quality is Everything**

If your videos look like they were filmed on a phone people will immediately leave. More importantly though, if you sound like you're yelling into a toaster people will leave even sooner. Having a good mic is essential and knowing how to do a little touch up in an audio editing suite is also helpful. 


**Quality is Better than Quantity**

You could upload ten videos a day but if they weren't quality content then no one is going to want to watch or subscribe to you. Even worse, some may get annoyed and never come back to watch another one of your videos. If your content isn't entertaining, try to learn about ways to edit down your videos to make them entertaining.


**Your Biggest Source of help is YouTube**

Speaking of editing, if you don't know how to do something in one of your multimedia software suites then look it up. The best place to check is, ironically, YouTube. ""How to add compression to a voice over."" ""How to fade a video to black in Adobe Premiere."" Search whatever is on your mind.


**Your Second Biggest Source of Help Is Reddit**

Have a question specifically about Let's Plays? r/letsplay is a great place to ask. Have a question about YouTube policies or how aspects of the system works? r/partneredyoutube is there for you. Just don't spam you videos to try to get views. These communities are there to be resources to learn from not to promote in.


**Marketing is Essential**

Whether it is properly tagging your videos for search or branding your channel consistently, marketing is extremely important. There could be a whole other post about how to properly get your content into the hands of potential subscribers but for now just know that being creative in your approach while not spamming people will get you on the run on train to success.


**Your First Month or Two Can Make or Break You**

Building a channel up is a battle. It isn't going to come easy. The most successful channels are the ones that grind it out and use smarts to produce and market quality content to their target audience. If you only see 7 subs in your first month it isn't the end of the world. If you're views aren't converting to subs try to learn why they aren't. Are you making subscribing easy for the user to do or to remember to do? You need to learn and apply what you learn into your videos and keep at it. If the content is there, the people will come eventually.


**Watch Your Favorite YouTuber's Early Work**

Speaking of starting out, all YouTube channels had to go through exactly what you are going through right now. PewDiePie once had zero views and zero subs. He's now the biggest thing in gaming on YouTube. Go to your favorite YT personality's videos and sort from oldest to newest. Watch a few really early videos. Are they top quality content? Does the audio sound like its recorded on a condenser microphone? Odds are the answer to these questions are no. And odds are that if you were to ask them about that content, they too wouldn't be very proud of it. What did they do though? They kept at it and they became more and more successful. If you need inspiration, this is the very best way to find it.


**Conclusion**

Starting out in the gaming realm of YouTube is a very hard thing to do. Finding a niche is a very good way to grow but your content needs to have the right qualities to connect with people. Remember, you are a *personality* on YouTube, not a *gamer*. Have fun, engage with your audience, and remember that Rome wasn't built in one day (unless you believe those ancient alien conspirators..).

The only issue with this concept is that the starting tile needs to have a road for outside traffic as well as a water source within it's borders. From a gameplay standpoint this wouldn't be difficult to achieve. For the map builders out there, we would need the game to recognize which tiles have water in them which shouldn't be an issue as I believe the map builder already does this. We would then need to build a set of roads to each of the viable starting tiles. The trick here is that the game would not place the roads unless you choose that tile to start on. 

So now when you first load out a new map, you get the option of your starting tile. The screen would look like it does when you go to purchase a tile but as you hover over the tiles you can select, the highways would then appear in the tile. I'm not sure what the coding load would be in order to implement this but I feel like it would be a really nice tweak to the game.",CitiesSkylines,"C:S needs to build in the ""select your starting tile"" aspect and here's how..",http://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/3anist/cs_needs_to_build_in_the_select_your_starting/
