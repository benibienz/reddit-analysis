20,"Heres the original comment:

This is so late that I don't know if it will be seen, but I'll post anyway. Also using a throwaway because the victim is another redditor who could be identified through my normal ID.
Back in 1995 I lived in a quiet neighborhood in the SF East Bay with my wife of a few years and our 20 month old daughter. We had a small 3 bedroom two story house, and one of our second floor bedrooms doubled as my home office. One quiet Saturday morning I was in my office playing Command and Conquer on my computer with my headphones on, oblivious to the sounds of the outside world.

I'd probably been playing for an hour or so when, during one particularly quiet moment, I faintly heard my wife cry out downstairs. Knowing that she was down there with our daughter, I pulled my headphones off to see if she needed help with anything. Until the day I take my last breath, I'll never forget what I heard when I pulled them off. I heard the voice of a man, with a thick Mexican accent, shout, ""Quit yelling bitch, or I'll fucking cut your head off and fuck your fucking daughter!"" My daughter was crying hysterically.

After that, it was like some switch was thrown in me and my higher brain just shut off. I wasn't making decisions. I just acted. I don't even remember pulling the .45 from the lockbox in my desk, I just remember walking down the stairs slowly, scared as hell that I was going to see my wife dead when I reached the bottom. Instead, when I reached the bottom, I saw my wife half naked, bent over the couch, bleeding from somewhere in her upper body, while being raped from behind by some burly guy with a knife in his hand. He wasn't TRYING to rape her, he was in the middle of the deed and was probably nearing climax.
I never said a word to the guy. Not while I was upstairs, not while I was coming down the stairs, and not when I walked into the room. His back was to me, so he had no idea I was even standing there.

He was holding his knife in his right hand, so that was the arm I grabbed with my left when I pulled him off. He spun away from her and me with a confused look on his face, and I shot him square in the chest at nearly point blank range before he had a chance to say a single word. His face went pale as he went onto one knee, and I fired twice more. One hit his neck, and the second missed entirely. I was told later that the first shot was the fatal one.
What happened next has always been a point of shame for me. The only thought going through my head at that point was that I couldn't let my daughter watch this man die. Without even checking on my wife, I scooped my daughter up and walked out my front door. As I walked out to my driveway, I saw one of my neighbors standing there staring at my house (he'd heard the gunshots). The poor guy went pale when he saw me walk out, and I vaguely remember asking him to hold my daughter while I went and checked on my wife. The neighbor asked me if I'd shot her, and I told him, ""No, I shot the man who was raping her."" I didn't realize at the time that I had the guys blood spray covering half my body, and that I looked like something out of a horror movie. I then handed him my daughter and my gun (I also have no idea why I gave him my gun), and went back into my house to help my wife.
The police and DA gave me some flak about the exact circumstances of the shooting (one of the detectives told me that it was more of an ""execution"" than a ""defense""), but in the end they declined to pursue any charges. The man who attacked her turned out to be a guy with serious mental issues who had been previously convicted of two violent rapes, one of which was against a 9 year old girl. Under California's then-new 3 Strikes law, he'd have gone to prison for life if I hadn't killed him.

As for recovery; I like to think that I've recovered from it, but it certainly induced a few behavioral changes. To this day, for example, I can't wear headphones that block out background noise. Even after years of counseling, over-ear and noise cancelling headphones give me panic attacks because I can't hear what's happening around me. I found out later that he'd been raping my wife for nearly 10 minutes before I heard him, and that he'd actually told my wife THREE TIMES that he was going to rape my daughter when he was finished with her. I was sitting 30 feet away and had no idea it was going on, and that fact has fucked with me for years.

My wife had a much worse time of it though. In addition to two stab wounds to her shoulder and upper arm, and the bruising and injuries from the forceful rape, she ended up having a mental break and took years to really recover. For the first 6 months, she absolutely could not be in any room by herself. For more than a year, she couldn't be in a house by herself (and she NEVER reentered the house where this happened). For several years, she'd break out in a sweat when she heard men with deep hispanic accents talking, because she'd hear his voice again. Even now, decades later, she starts shaking if you try to talk to her about it. She's fine in every other sense, but even discussing it freaks her out.",2016-11-16 01:59:24+00:00,da25zbo,9.0,t1_da24da3,2155.0,funny

To stop without a farmhouse near   
Between the woods and frozen lake   
The darkest evening of the year.   

He gives his harness bells a shake   
To ask if there is some mistake.   
The only other sound’s the sweep   
Of easy wind and downy flake.   

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   
But I have promises to keep,   
And miles to go before I sleep,   
And miles to go before I sleep.

652,"
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an off-hand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away, across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spell

It did not lead him to meditate upon his frailty as a creature of temperature, and upon man's frailty in general, able only to live within certain narrow limits of heat and cold; and from there on it did not lead him to the conjectural field of immortality and man's place in the universe.”

Elaine Donnelly of the Center for Military Readiness (CMR) suggests that Hultgreen ""may have been the victim of a flawed policy"" which overlooked her mistakes in training, two of which were similar to those that caused her death.[6] The Navy conceded that the material on which the CMR based its report was ""largely accurate"". The other pilot named by the center subsequently brought a suit for defamation against the CMR, but lost because the court determined that, by virtue of her status as one of the first women to attempt to qualify as a carrier combat pilot, she was a ""public figure"" and needed to prove malice on the part of those who published the charge of favoritism",2015-12-21 13:37:31+00:00,cy6jtn0,11.0,t1_cy6bt4r,27598.0,news

Some men hunt for sport
Others hunt for food
The only thing I'm hunting for
Is an outfit that looks good

See...my...vest
See my vest
Made from real gorilla chest

Feel this sweater
There's no better
Than authentic Irish setter

See this hat
'Twas my cat
My evening wear, vampire bat

These white slippers 
Are albino 
African endangered rhino.

Grizzly bear underwear
Turtle's necks,
I've got my share.

Barret of poodle 
On my noodle
It shall rest.

Try my red robin suit
It comes one vest or two.

See my vest,
See my vest,
See my vest!

Like my loafers?
Former gophers
It was that, or skin my chaufferus.

But a greyhound fur tuxedo would be best.

So let's prepare these dogs

Kill two for matching clogs.

2338,"Friend of mine in high school needed to pass economics to graduate.

I was sitting in study hall with him when our economics teacher came in and sat down at our table.

He was very serious and grabbed my friends shoulder and said 'I'm sorry you needed a 75 to pass and you got a 74 there's nothing I can do about it'.

My friend sat there in shock and asked the teacher if he was serious, said his parents were going to kill him, and what he could do to try to pass the class to graduate.   He even started hyperventilating and crying a little bit.

After a little while the teacher stood up and told him 'I was just kidding you passed it by one point'.

My friend once he got over the shock, became angry at the teacher and asked him why he would want to get him so upset.

The teacher said 'I dedicated my life to teaching and wanted you to experience just a taste of the frustration I feel every night trying to teach kids who don't want to learn'.

Then he walked out of the room and we sat there in silence...
