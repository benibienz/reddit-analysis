9,"Hi,  thanks for your inputs. I had just googled the prons and cons of bamboo charcoal topper. Here's what I have found:

Prons: Bamboo charcoal infused memory foam mattress are cooler to sleep on and dissipate heat up to 10x faster than a polyurethane foam mattress due to the extreme open-cell technology. These are widely accepted as the best mattress for allergies and sensitive skin due to the natural substances used, offering a healthy alternative to chemicals found in the previously mentioned products. 


Cons: Like any new and innovative technology this type is generally more expensive than a viscoelastic or gel mattress. Some people have sensitive skin and allergies so will unfortunately have to pay the premium for natural products. You may also struggle to find showrooms locally which stock or deliver these products; however if you want a plant based item you’ll find plenty online.

10,"However, I have a bad memory. So more often than not, I would forget many terrible things easily, as well as happy things. T_T. But i used to be good at forgiving others. You can try those small tips offered by some great guys (just like us), and I picked some of them for a reference (The ones that resonated with my most strongly were):


&gt; 1. I remember them as a child and it’s much easier! –Joy Thompson

&gt; 2. I remind myself that I forgive not for them but for me and that it’s easier to forgive than to hang on to so much anger, hurt and betrayal. –Sarah Clark

&gt; 3. I just acknowledge that we are humans, so we are allowed to make mistakes. –Haydee Lizbeth Lopez Cruz

&gt; 4. Remind yourself that they are not separate from you; they only appear that way. Then you will realize you are one, and it is yourself you are forgiving. –Justin Hayden

&gt; 5. Do not keep thinking of the past or the bad thing that happened; when you let go of it, you get over the anger/bitterness that you felt and it clears the path of forgiveness! The best thing is time! –Ashna Singh

&gt; 6. Remember that we are all doing the best we can at the time. –Diane Paul

&gt; 7. Remind yourself of how much forgiveness would mean to you if it was your turn for a mistake! – Carol Mcbride-Safford

&gt; 8. Wayne Dwyer describes how hate is love which has been turned around. Seeing the expression of what can’t be forgiven as love makes it easier to forgive. Were also all doing the best we can, according to our own evolutionary state, including those we find hard to forgive. –Lise Heeley

&gt; 9. Because it takes less energy to love and forgive than it does to stay angry and hold a grudge. It brings peace to your life. –Linda Adams

&gt; 10. I know that I need to forgive someone, not for their benefit, but for my own peace of mind. Don’t do it for them, do it for you! –Cathryn Kent

&gt; 11. You remember why you love them. Love is about forgiveness.- Holly Chapman

&gt; 12. Forgiveness comes easier with the passing of time. I tend to find that, if I am wronged, I forgive the person before they forgive themselves, and when I am in need of forgiveness, it is I who feels the guilt for longer. –Mandy Richardson

&gt; 13. Stop thinking and just do it. Open your heart and forgive. –Lindsey Windrow

&gt; 14. Don’t force it. If I don’t feel forgiving, I can at least not act on my anger. Eventually forgiveness will come if you welcome it. –Julie Trottier

&gt; 15. Just learn to smile and let things go. –Sudharma Lama

&gt; 16. Give up on all hope of a better past. –Matt Child

&gt; 17. Every time you think of them send them love. After a while it gets easy. –Crystal Chang

&gt; 18. Meditate, meditate and meditate some more until it’s gone! –Margot Knight-Guijt

&gt; 19. The harder it is to forgive someone else, the more I am responsible. When I understand and forgive myself, forgiving others is easy. –Pamela Picard

&gt; 20. Two different approaches. One involves restoring your boundaries and sense of protection first. The other involves focusing on what your body is feeling and stop dwelling on the offense. Both involve being present. –Chris Campa

&gt; 21. Forgiveness comes easy when you know that what people say or do is about them, it’s not about you. –Kim Kings

&gt; 22. Shift the focus, feel the pain and think of the thousands of others in the world who are also feeling the same pain, then send a loving-kindness message to everyone to be relieved of this suffering. -Nick Ong",2016-10-21 06:48:56+00:00,d91gzsd,1.0,t3_58lt5z,2024.0,LifeProTips

13,"1) **To make new friends, you need to expose yourself to new people.**


You obviously won’t find people knocking at your door and asking you to be friends with them. You got to meet and interact with new people. And not only that, you need to meet the same group of people frequently enough to click and to know each other enough to carry the friendship forward. If you feel nervous to do so, pls just repeat, do again and again. Repeating can make you feel accustomed to those behaviors. And everytime you make it, pls say something good to yourself, cos you're doing a great job.


2) **Share your life**


As much is being part of other person’s life important, that much important it is to open up and share your life with them. This is the beauty and simplicity of friendship. You care and share each other’s life. By allowing friends to be a part of your life, by sharing with them glimpses of your life, you provide them with a chance to know you better; you provide them with a chance to be your friend. 

3) **Be there for friends**


People remember people who stand by them in their joys and sorrows. It’s important to be there for friends in their times of celebration and times when they need someone.No matter how busy you are or how inconvenient it is, doesn’t matter if you are late by a couple of days, be there for your folks. There is nothing that cements a bond of friendship as strong as being there for the other person on important days/times of their life.

16,"Yapper. Sad moment. I summarise my five sadest moments.  

**1) When Kelsey directs BoJack to feel what Secretariat feels in the White House scene.**

   ""This is the moment when you realize something inside you is broken, and it can never be fixed.""
 
**2) When Herb tells Bojack that he will never forgiving him.**

   ""I don't care about the job! I did fine. I had a good life. But what I needed then was a friend, and you abandoned me. And I will never forgive you for that.""
 
**3) The entire scene after BoJack kisses Charlotte, asks her to go with him then begs her to let him stay after she refuses**

""Uh, BoJack, I think you got the wrong idea.""


""Let's go. Let's get out of here right now.""

""No, BoJack.""

""You and me, this is real. You know this is real.""

""My husband is right upstairs.""

""I don't care about your husband. All that matters is us.""

""Don't do this, BoJack.""

""I know you feel it too. So many times in my life I've done the wrong thing, but this is the right thing and I have never been more sure than anything. I've wasted so much time sitting on my hands and imagining what could have been. Tell me you don't feel the same. Tell me you haven't thought about it.""

""I think you should go. Tomorrow""

""Charlotte -""

""I have worked very hard to build this life for myself. I am happy here. And you just roll into my life like a hurricane. Why? Because we knew each other for 5 minutes 30 years ago? I don't know you.""

""You do.""

""I don't. And you don't know me.

""No, Charlotte, please. These last few months have been amazing. I love you, and your family, and this town -""

""Stop.""

""I never wanted to hurt -""

""BoJack -""

""I'm sorry I kissed you. I shouldn't have. We can pretend it didn't happen. Everything can go back to normal, but -""
""No, no. Stop, no.""

""Please, don't make me go back to LA -""

""I don't care where you go, BoJack, but I can't have you around here. You make me too sad.""
 
**4) When BoJack asks Diane why she wouldn't go home after she secretly comes back from Cordova.**

""I should. I know I should. I wish I could just go home right now and crawl into bed and not have to talk about anything or explain anything [...] And I wouldn't have to say 'I'm sorry I left', 'I'm sorry I made things so difficult', 'I'm sorry I'm not the person I was'.""
 
**5) The breakup between Wanda and BoJack**

""What happened, BoJack?""

""Same thing that always happens. You didn't know me. Then you fell in love with me. And now you know me.""

""You know, it's funny. When you look at someone through rose-colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags.""

For the price, this is the best mattress I've ever owned. The last one I had was over $1300 and not as comfortable as this one.

I had to get a new bed quick, and was surprised to see that this site even carried mattresses. I was definitely skeptical, but the reviews were mostly good so I took a chance and I'm so glad that I did. I figured it was cheap enough to be temporary and I'd get a ""real"" bed later.

It arrives in a giant roll, like the biggest yoga mat ever. You start to cut it open and it floofs up and inflates itself. Bam, you're done. It's that easy, that cheap and that comfortable. I plan to keep this as my permanent bed.  Also this may help you:

You can take a look at [floureon security camera system] (http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=floureon+camera+system) and I notice that most of them have a hdd with a good price (about $100 or less). I have installed one 4ch system of this brand and I have to say that it's super easy to use. With motion detect function (When motion detection recording is enabled, camera begins to record if it detects any motion and then stops once the movement ends.), I will receive email-alerts from the system if any unauthorized activities have been detected. I think this feature is a must have for monitoring home security. In addition, the night vision is also critical important. As we all know night can be robber’s paradise, thus you need to focus on the IR leds. You know that how far the illumination of Infrared usually determines the night vision range. And more IR leds means higher the night vision range.

Just FYI, to set up a network camera for WiFi access, you will first have to temporarily connect it to a wired Ethernet network in order to configure the camera's wireless settings. 


-&gt; Connect the camera to your Ethernet switch or router via a network cable.


-&gt; Configure the camera's wireless settings. Remember to disconnect the camera once you have finished setting it up, as many cameras will not connect wirelessly unless you do this.


-&gt; In addition to assigning a manual IP address to the camera, you will need to enter information about your wireless network, such as the following:


SSID


Also known as the ESSID or network name. This is the name of your wireless network.


Encryption settings


You will need to set the correct encryption type and password. These must match the settings on your wireless access point or router.


-&gt; Install the monitoring software on your PC (PC surveillance software and mobile phone client are included in 2CD/ come with the camera package), then complete the configuration. You are all set for monitoring from your PC. If you have any NVRs, you can connect them to a NVR. Your cameras are compatible with NVRs (with third-party ONVIF platform software built-in).

If you still have any questions, you can go to their facebook page to get support from experts. ",2016-01-18 02:19:32+00:00,cz28f2j,3.0,t1_cyzt79w,183312.0,homesecurity

I just got one for a friend from Amazon for less than two hundred bucks, a floureon security camera system with 4 cameras. Leaves expansion on down the in case you change your mind. And this new system starts off with some pretty nice 1000 TVL resolution. Besides resolution, its night vision can reach to 82 ft with 36 IR leds. 


The new system allows you to scan the QR code to phones so you can view anytime home or remote. What's more you don't have to worry about becoming educated with port forwarding DNS client and so forth, which really sucks if this happens.

You can also wire to desired TV/laptop for life real time monitoring. And you can set up snapshots so they take a pic of the event and store it on your HD.

-&gt; Set up the Network, which requires a wireless router or a wireless bridge that can connect to the current wired network. Before attempting to connect a wireless camera to a new network, ensure that a laptop or tablet can connect to that network wirelessly and access the Internet and other local features.


-&gt; Install the Camera Software. Most wireless cameras come with some form of software solution (the cam I linked has a CD Disk). You can also opt for a third-party solution but just make sure that the software supports all of the features that the cameras do.

Flashing light/ headlamp with batteries or chargers. I will echo Luckylee's thought. No matter camping in a RV or in the wild with a tent, you can not avoid the flashing light for outdoors uses. If they are in the outside the SUV or RV, a headlamp or small flashing light is necessary.

Placing the bed under it and decorating symmetrically, will create a symmetrical feeling. One more thing: make sure your windows are hermetic so that cold air won’t get inside and make you cold.

Peer to peer is a technology that makes it simple to link the camera with a smartphone. Lets get that more specific, there is a unique ID assigned to each camera. When the smartphone app is opened, it pings the P2P server which in turn looks for the listed UIDs and where they are located. If the camera can be pinged, it shows as online, others are offline.


This brand is recommended by my friend and now I'm using a cctv security system of this brand. So far so good I have to say. Mine is a 4 channel cctv dvr kit with one dvr and 2 night vision cameras. It indeed has a good performance as for its competitive price. As for the cameras, I can see clearly in my footage and always get some alert emails with pictures attached. And the service is quite good with quick response when I ask them questions, even now they still ask me to do a survey about their products and then send me some coupons. A decent cctv system I think so far. But I haven't had a chance to test all products, only having some experience with this one. So if you need to make decision please do some research before act.

As for ip camera, you need to focus on the following points. 

- Weatherproof. You mentioned outdoors, so IP66 rating is a plus. 

- Lens Selection. A camera lens with a higher focal length number will deliver more magnification.

- P2P (Peer to Peer). To avoid complicated DDNS network setup, P2P function should take into account. It is the easiest and fastest one-step network setup function.

- Night vision. To see clearly under low light condition, IR led is required. Generally speaking how far the illumination of Infrared determines the night vision range.

- Your network bandwidth. IP security cam requires network bandwidth to transmit and store images, video and data. The higher the resolution of your camera, the greater your bandwidth requirements.

375,Guess you might find the right place to post your question. That's where I'm. Now come to the point. I do think that spending around £200-300 is rly too much for a home security kit. My home security kit is a floureon cctv dvr kit (2 cameras &amp;1 dvr cost abt £85) and goes so far so good with wireless network and cloud storage. I can keep track of the recorder in my laptop when I'm at work. But one thing I should mention is that the home security kit is a little bit complex for me to set up since I'm not a good handy guy. Google might help u. HTH.,2015-07-28 05:35:42+00:00,ctip1qq,1.0,t3_3e2e2d,578725.0,homedefense

378,Home security systems are more important than ever before. You know that crime is on the rise in many areas of the country.
