It's 3 tier coat racks with 11 hooks.

Put it together very easily following the picture instructions - done in 20 mins and it seems to be very strong and very slim so does not take up much room.
Good sturdy coat stand and value for money.

Usually retails for 36 quid, now 15 quid including free delivery. (Perhaps Save 60% off)
