116,"Myeah, that's true.. They even put a limit of 300g to winning 20 games per day, which I hear is really tough at the last arena. And it even isn't that much to begin with since it takes then over week to update single common to level 9 from that mechanic... Just way too expensive. (High quality chests and donating obviously gives you more, but donating makes you lose cards and chests are pretty luck based and take time to open.)

Honestly speaking, I really like the game.. I like the mechanics and it's one of the few PvP games that I actually really enjoy, I just don't like that they limit people's progress so much.

I personally bought a special sale that had 100k gold for less than 10€ worth of gems.. I don't know if it was bug or something, because after that I have seen same offer only giving 10k gold, but it was an offer that I wasn't gonna pass.. It got all of my cards upgraded to max for while, but now I already got 7 that I can't afford to upgrade anymore.. xD

In my opinion, they would make more money from the game if they gave us sales like that every once a while, 10€ isn't that much money every few months for mobile game, so it's money I would be willing to pay them every now and then...

276,"The castle is definitely a 1:1 in one block equals one meter.. So it should be to the scale.. Might be the perspective that's causing the castle to feel somehow smaller.

And the castle is made with Minecraft PE, so textures are much harder to make for it, that's why I want to make a PC version at some point when I have time for it.

Also the reason why my castle looks more straight, is because well.. Minecraft.

I had to straighten up a lot of parts of the castle and then scale them to feel right from the inside. (Yes, pretty much 90% of the castle is also completed from the inside, which took by far the most time to get feel right.)

Anyways, here's a screenshot from almost the same perspective: http://i.imgur.com/K8HDOM7.png

I find it really strange how small the towers seem in the real life photo, because my version is build to match the live version of the castle while standing right next to it and inside it.. Altho part of the build is based on the 1500 roofs etc, and those might've been bit taller than the current ones..

Also: It's not really that symmetrical tbh:

425,"I actually have kinda sad story about Ampharos, but Ampharos itself is one of my core team for multiple reasons, the most obvious being that it's an INSANE tanky electric nuker and fits most of the teams really well.

But the sad part is that it used to be the favorite Pokémon of my best friend who passed away pretty much exactly 10 years ago in the spring (due to a disease in his intestines). We used to play ton of Pokémon during the school hours at vocational school and used to battle with our decently good level 100 teams all the time, and I kept losing against Ampharos really often. But after his death, after a while I picked Ampharos as part of my team and it has been there for years, but about 3 years ago I made a horrible discovery after I randomly found the Pokémon Crystal cartridge from a box and decided to go check out my old dudes that I used to spend over 999 hours with (that's how far the in game timer went), but you might guess it that after over 8 years, the internal battery had died and I lost there tons of memories, not only off my friend, but also I had original Mew that I lined for in real life event and my very first Charmander too from christmas '99 along with many others like my first proper shiny pidgeot (if not counting the welfare Gyarados) and plenty of other guys and gals.

So I'm going to just say now RIP for my old game and all the memories, and I really wish my friend is in a good place now, hopefully filled with Pokémon that we used to love so much. Being a realist, I kinda don't really think so, but it's a nice thought to have.

595,"That's actually kinda true.. They did pick the cards randomly enough for some people to chance places, but the box wasn't shaken at any point when setting up the game.

But the point also is that Jesse wasn't hitler twice in row at any point, people just acted like he couldn't be.. Because it was ""unlikely"", which in my opinion is too much assumption. Every game should be treated as a new game and trying to figure the hitler based on the actions, not by chances from previous game that doesn't even matter anymore.

Also turns out, the ""house rule"" they made that first vote shouldn't happen is actually wrong. You could see it happen twice in the game that fascist (other than hitler) if they get presidency on first turn always contact fellow fascist on first turn. So even in the first turn, you should question people why they chose someone to be consultant and try to read their reaction. TB just assumed that nobody would be that good at the game yet, but it turns out Jesse was. The first thing he did was to contact hitler on turn 1. And the game already started there, under the approval of TB's house rule. Ironically enough, the very first vote being nein, screwed up the game for Jesse in game 1 but that was random luck more than anything.",2016-01-13 14:18:36+00:00,cywm0d4,5.0,t1_cywlrj2,500.0,Cynicalbrit
596,"What purpose was behind that decision. Like it turns out in the end, Mathas was Liberal so why would've he chosen shooting Maggie who was claiming to be Liberal and wasn't proven to be fascist by any of the policies before that. The only thing pointing her to be fascist was TB doubting that she wasn't honest about the Jesse's card, but Jesse never declined being fascist so why would she lie about it, for what purpose would it serve?

In my opinion, there were many more better targets for that bullet already at that point..

Jesse was obviously testing the water with that first choice, and it was confirmed more when Maggie claimed him to be fascist. So I personally would've shot him at that point to give Liberals more power in voting.

Cry was the loudest fascist in the game, and was really annoyed by Sinvicta for some reason when he wasn't co-operating with his lie about the choice. It seemed so odd that someone would be so upset about being forced to Liberal decision. So imo, either of those would've been better targets than Maggie. As they were causing too much confusion overall.. I personally thought after that shot that he was actually fascist, but it didn't make sense neither in the late game.

But why was Maggie being chosen in middle of all that fighting, why didn't Liberals like TB or Genna try to prove that she was what she claimed to be? Mathas was obviously too confused from everything, so good job from fascist on that. He was totally out of the game, and was more fascist than liberal with everything he did in late game..

It was like some perfect crime scene, Liberal politician shooting other Liberal because she tries to call out someone being fascist, but nobody believes her so she get's shot, but WHY? What strings were being pulled to that to happen, I just can't get over it because to me it doesn't make any sense and there was no reason for it..",2016-01-13 14:00:36+00:00,cywlhu6,1.0,t3_40s3i0,554.0,Cynicalbrit
597,"Well, the way I see it.. I heard genuine frustration from Maggie when people didn't believe her.. And that made me personally think she was being honest. I still don't understand why TB has so sure she was lying, unless Maggie would've been the best liar ever.. Which seemed highly unlikely from her reaction.

So why would you shoot her instead of the person who doesn't decline accusations of being fascist by someone who has actually seen his card, hasn't been confirmed to not being hitler and who seems to go awfully quiet towards the late game when fascists are starting to get more power.

Imo Maggie getting shot was just really odd, and Jesse would've been safer bet for Liberals which Mathas actually was himself.. I would've understood shooting Maggie from fascist point of view.. But not from Liberal.

If anything, Genna or TB should've tried harder to get a proof that Maggie really was liberal like she was claiming to be and that would've proven Jesse to be fascist. But instead Genna stayed silent and TB was just accusing her to be lying without even trying to get proof of that. Mathas was just really confused and giving him the power to shoot someone worked great for fascists, so I wouldn't have trusted Mathas to do anything good for Liberals after that silent shot during the argument everyone else had at that point, I actually thought for a long time that he would be fascist instead of Cry, but that wouldn't have made much sense either.",2016-01-13 13:39:42+00:00,cywkxtn,5.0,t1_cywd8m3,25564.0,Cynicalbrit
598,"It was actually kinda hillarious the way they kept complaining about ""chances"" and how they work.. While they didn't understand that 7-8 players is quite small pool of people to talk about chances, it's actually decently likely for someone being hitler twice, three times in row is quite unlikely already but still not impossible.

Pulling a hitler card from 7 envelopes is 14,3% every time you make a new game and doing that twice in row is 2,9%.. It sounds small number but in a world of chances, 3% isn't actually that small. For a random number generator that happens 3 times out of 100 deals..

So to say it simply, those 3 chances out of 100 games could be the first 3 games, but after that it's very likely you won't get the same result for 97 next games (but it can still happen). That's how chances work in a ""simple"" way.

TL;DR: It's 14,3% chance for someone to pull hitler card, and 3% to do it again next game. But you shouldn't assume that you ""know"" who can't be hitler just based on chances of previous game.",2016-01-13 13:23:54+00:00,cywkjip,3.0,t1_cywhrxt,9101.0,Cynicalbrit

The old ones are painted on wooden dice, as I thought it would be easier to get the paint stay on them.. But honestly, I were surprised how well the paint stayed on the new plastic ones.. But also not having to worry about the holes of the normal dice was a huge bonus.. It was much easier to outline the pictures without them.

Also the blue arrows don't have currently black outline on them, for two reasons..

1: I'm afraid that I'll screw up the pointiness of the arrows, if I keep on painting more (also getting really exhausted of painting small details.)..

2: The blue color I'm using is kinda dark, so it would be hard to see black on them anyways.. And I'm way too lazy atm to mix any white with the blue, mainly because the paint dries so fast that getting multiple sets of right color would be kinda annoying..

Also the pointy cheekbones on the picture was a mistake, but I kinda ended up liking it that way (reminds me of a skull of an elf).. Other red skulls are ""more normal"".",2015-12-05 15:58:33+00:00,cxo3tv6,1.0,t3_3vjtiq,138.0,bloodbowl

Support Shen in nutshell: Get couple early ganks with taunt, preferably together with jungler and some chain CC. In mid game get few ganks again with jungler (by using ulti from anywhere) to make it 3vs1 and make some runs for wards while dashing over walls. Late game, just try not to let your carries die and if you can get good initiate with flash taunt, then do it but main focus is not letting enemies to get to your carries.",2015-10-11 10:52:33+00:00,cvvp9hf,3.0,t1_cvvog8f,3761.0,leagueoflegends
