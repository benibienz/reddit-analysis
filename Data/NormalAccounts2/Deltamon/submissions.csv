This works against EVERYTHING that Pokémon Go is supposed to stand for and worst of all: People are locked into watching their phone screen constantly, especially if they want to find some specific pokémon and not just wander around aimlessly.

I give you an example with another similar game: Geocaching gives you exact GPS location where the cache is supposed to be so you can just quickly glimpse the location and then walk / drive to there and once you are nearby.. Then you can get the phone out again and search for it in smaller and less dangerous area.

TL;DR:  
Please Niantic, fix your tracking system. It has already at least once caused an actual death of young player, so before you do any other changes to the game, try to make the searching for Pokémon more safe and actually fun by being less cryptic.",pokemongo,"Currently the biggest issue in Pokémon Go, that needs to be fixed ASAP.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/4szec1/currently_the_biggest_issue_in_pokémon_go_that/

It's not a game at all and it has NOTHING to do with Pokémon except it has 3d models of them in it.

It's really a shame because the idea of catching pokémon by traveling and searching in real life is a brilliant idea. But this product barely qualifies even as a game at all.

So where should I start? First of all, what is Pokémon known as besides catching them? (oh there's plenty of catching, don't worry, that's nearly everything you can do and it's flappy bird quality minigame there you toss pokeball and catch everything on first try.) What about Battle system, statistics of various pokemon, leveling up, breeding, encountering other trainers, fighting in a gym and becoming ""Pokémon Champion"".. Forget all that, since there's none of if.. 

It's basically you catch a Pokémon and then spend either real money or ""increase their combat power"" and then when you fight, you tap screen. That's everything there is to it. You can place a combat level 10 charmander to gym if you find it first, then beat it non stop yourself to get 10 exp per beat down. You can fucking fight YOURSELF for infinite experience if you are among the first to get level 5 which I was (and getting that was quite tedious walking around with badly implemented catching system, which I eventually figured out and even then it was really poorly done.).

There's zero interaction with other players and many people have compared it to Ingress (game from same company), but even that has at least some game aspects to it.

So in other words, please Game Freak.. Check what you have given your permission to, then take this shit down and remake it properly. There's no hope for this game to become any good, unless they completely remake it.",pokemongo,My synopsis after spending ~4-5 hours today with this game:,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/4rjk2y/my_synopsis_after_spending_45_hours_today_with/

Now to back up that statement, my history in FPS games is quite long: CS for years since 1.4, Quake III Arena, Unreal Tournament, S4 League. So I have spent many hours in ""arena shooters"" before and I have been waiting for Overwatch for a long time after I heard people talking so much good about it.

And now that Open beta is out, I tried it out and felt quite disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the game feels like it's really well made, but something feels off very badly.

I could think 2 major things that bother me most: 

* The gun play feels really weak and most of the weapons feel like they lack a punch, as if you tickle enemies instead of actually damaging them and on the other end, there's few guns that instantly take you down. So the gap is quite huge between the weapons. After a while you can get used to the guns, but they just don't feel good to use.

* However the biggest issue I have with the game is the movement. It feels really sluggish with most of the characters, and even the fastest characters don't feel that fast.

There's other minor issues too (like not knowing how well Symmetra's turrets actually work when you are playing her), that might be just that I'm so new to the game that I'm not used to it yet and I just would need to get better at it, but the game does kinda bad job at explaining how your skills work and you'd have to play for quite long time before you actually start getting used to them.

So I'm sure the game is alright and most aspects are really well made, but I just don't feel like I want to play it long enough to start really enjoying it.",Overwatch,"First time playing for several hours, my honest opinion about the game so far:",https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/4i60py/first_time_playing_for_several_hours_my_honest/

Especially Chillout section has some great ambient music and you'd think that ""Space Dreams"" was the obvious choice, and while it fits great. I still personally prefer Psychill while playing this game.

Do you other commanders have some favorite background music to play while flying around? 

(I also tried listening to Cowboy Bepop soundtrack too, but fount it to be bit too upbeat for the game, even tho I love the songs they just didn't seem to fit here..)",EliteDangerous,"I know this isn't directly related to E:D, but I was looking for some nice and relaxing background music to play while flying around in vast space.

Taken from ED Wikia, but seriously.. **Heat signature** is a thing in this game? O_o

How much more deeper can this game go, just when you are starting to think you start to understand it, suddenly such thing matters somehow..

I personally bought Cobra as my first ship as it's supposed to be multi purpose ship, but I didn't know that the ship details can go so deep..
