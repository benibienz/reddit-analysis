Maybe they don't like you? Or think your being cheeky asking?",2015-12-30 05:24:47+00:00,cyfun4h,2,t1_cyfu76s,905,AdviceAnimals

9,"Recently my omega 2831.80 just stopped. Completely. Fortunately it's still under warranty from Swiss time services. Hopefully it's not water damage. I've never had the crown undone when I have been in water... :/

I needed a stand in watch, and just bought this from a shop in the UK for £6.99. 

It's fantastic! And looks stylish, retro, and quirky.

I do miss the weight and feel of my omega though...",2015-08-30 17:41:40+00:00,cukxhrx,1,t3_3iz59w,177,Watches
10,"Sure, it's actually simple. ( I think ).

You have two letters (the city where the car was registered in the uk)

Then two numbers, mine is 54, which is the latter half of the year 2004. 

04 would be the first half of 2004.

A new car in the uk, would be a 65 plate today... In Jan it changes to a 16 plate.

12,"The body work is a lot more an issue than the engine. The bumper hangs up by some cable ties. And it's peppered with scratches and bumps...!

It's still nippy though, and does 60mpg which is as good as most newer cars...
The only reason to buy a new one is vanity...",2015-08-18 17:53:14+00:00,cu79z6o,4,t1_cu79le1,564,Watches

14,"Good decision! Does yours keep good time? 

The clocks at work were wrong recently on the computers, I said to my boss, that it was 2 minutes 15 seconds wrong, and he said ""are you wearing an atomic clock on your wrist?""

I should have said ""no, an omega""",2015-08-18 17:49:07+00:00,cu79t62,2,t1_cu7069a,15288,Watches
15,"I like the fact that omega is a bit of a lesser known brand name within the general public. No one ever asks me about my watch ever. My nephews and nieces have never heard the name omega...

Rolex is a lot more ""bling"" and well known, I am sure people judge you a lot more harshly wearing a Rolex...

19,"I paid £800 for it, I was a bit concerned it was a fake, as they normally go for 1.2-1.5k 

The case had been over polished and was very shiny.

I had it serviced at Swiss time services in the uk, and they restored the finish (£300).

I didn't opt for a new bezel, as it was another £250 and it gives it character!",2015-08-18 17:37:44+00:00,cu79cac,3,t1_cu72c7q,10565,Watches
20,"I've had this a year now, and I have a pact with my fiancé, that if I got promoted again, I could trade in my watch for a more expensive one.

So I am a bit torn, I am not going to rush into anything but I've been toying with a sub in my mind for a few months.

I might not get promoted, so the decision may already be made!",2015-08-18 17:35:30+00:00,cu798wm,2,t1_cu6vtej,27864,Watches
21,"I've got around 3 pairs from eBay, I just searched for watch movement cuff links. They cost around £15 a pair. These are my favourite as they are old Swiss Movements. (A bit of a shame for them to end up as cuff links I guess)

I get a lot of people notice and comment on them. ",2015-08-18 17:32:48+00:00,cu794yi,3,t1_cu6y3r3,19241,Watches

23,"I've wanted a blue Seamaster since I was at university playing Goldeneye on my flats N64, it has always been my dream watch. 

Recently I moved jobs gained a hard earned promotion and had quite a significant pay rise, including a bonus. This is the result of my first bonus payment. 

I bought it second hand, for a great price.

I recently had it serviced, and it keeps fantastic time +3 seconds daily. 

I love how slim a watch it is, it's beautifuly designed, feels weighty but not too heavy, and has a beautiful ticking sound that you can hear sometimes when lying in bed in perfect silence.

Only problem is, I am thinking about trading it up for a sub...",2015-08-18 08:27:23+00:00,cu6uny1,1,t3_3hf89i,274,Watches
