I dated this girl for the last year and a half of my life. I'm 20 now. We started dating when I was a senior in high-school and she was a freshman. Well we were perfectly fine for that year and a half no major fights, no real problems, we always worked through everything. Then at her Halloween party on the 29th she dropped the bomb on me that she doesn't think she feels the same way about me and that she thinks she has feelings for another guy. Needless to say I feel empty now. She was perfect for me. I gave my all for her and it wasn't enough. I'm trying to steer away from the ""I'm not good enough"" mindset but that's really hard in this situation because that's what you're essentially told. I don't know why I'm writing this here or what. Maybe I need someone who might have an easier time understanding this than my friends. They help but I dunno. I feel broken and I want to move on but it's too early and I don't know how to after building my life around her. Advice? Anything will help.",infj,Just got dumped by ENFP.

I dated this girl in highschool 2 years ago when I was 18 and she was 16. It wasn't a good relationship, abusive. She did a lot of pressuring to take things further than I wanted to. I made the mistake of letting it go that far a few times but I didn't want that so I broke up with her. She's tried off and on for the last 2 years to ruin my relationship, friendships, and relationship with my family. She has been faking call logs and texts with an app. All I want to know is how to get her to stop. I just want to be left alone but at this point. I'm lucky my friends, SO, and family know her and what she's trying to do but I want her to stop trying and to stop trying to make it out I'm a rapist. If more info is needed I will provide on request :) Thank you guys.

Edit: Thank you so much for the help! I am going to get a new number and leave the old one online for documentation. I have had her blocked for about 2 years. This is all screenshots shes sending to my friends and family. Haven't spoken to her for 2 years so thank you all for putting my mind at ease. I will get the phone records from my service provider for documentation and I will decide later whether or not to press charges for defamation/libel.
