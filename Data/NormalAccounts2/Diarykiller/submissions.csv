Hey Guys, i am a broke student from germany and my story is simple i have no job because i am a full time student taking his A grades ( don´t really know if this is the correct term) I have a friend who recently got himself a rig and bought himself Far Cry 4 during the sale but i missed this sale because i haven´t had the time to go on the pc and now im missing the money to get it.


Why do i want this Game ?


 the reasons why i want this game are some i loved the Far cry Series i started with Far Cry 2 which i lost endless hours in and then came far cry 3 which wasn´t as good because of the stereotypical story and gameplay( i miss those days in which you gun just decided to break during a fight ) but still its world was awesome i loved it and everything about it got it on xbox 360 and it was not the best performance but i still had my time with it , and now there is far cry 4 i sadly had no time and no money for it  and now that holidays start and i have a friend to play it in coop with i have 2 more reasons to get it. 


What do i Expect from this game ?


I Personally hope it lives up to my Expectations that i got from viewing reviews and such. it should be some Funny, good looking Shooter that i can have some good time with. It should not be to short so my friend and i can lose a lot of time because we play this game ( I have Holidays now and i am waiting for Fallout 4 so i have some time to lose)
