40,"Quick overview of the rules for anyone who has not heard of Snooker:

Aim is to pot a red (1 point) then a colour (yellow = 2, green = 3, brown = 4 blue = 5, pink = 6 and black = 7), then a red and so on until only colours are left on the table. You then pot them in the order of value (as above). 

Snooker has come a long way since the 80s when this was filmed, for example here are a few interesting videos depicting the modern game:

* [Ronnie O'Sullivan, arguably Snooker's greatest ever player's best shot compilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWzzPbsurAY)

* [Fastest ever 147 maximum break by Ronnie O'Sullivan - 5m 27s](https://youtu.be/M3C7I5lRZII?t=1m8s)

* [And my personal favourite shot ever, by Stephen Lee, as narrated by Jabba the Hut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrrmeymFQWY)

Bearing in mind the table is 12ft long and 6ft wide with very small pockets, it makes these shots all the more impressive!

45,"La Palma is very unlikely to happen, mainly due to the fact that the main theory behind it is somewhat flawed. It says that when the main Volcano erupts, it will superheat the water inside the flanks of the Volcano, causing a lateral force that will push the sides of the volcano towards the ocean. Whilst it is true it will cause an expansion of the water within the flanks (sides) of the volcano, the water is not be concentrated in one particular place in order to provide a focus centre of force/pressure to cause a fault in the flanks, thus making them slide. Also, the rocks and nature of the flanks of the volcano are porous, so a lot of the steam will either percolate through the rock harmlessly, or be directed out of a smaller vent. 

As well as this, although the peak wave amplitude would be huge (about ~500m) due to ~30km^3 of debris (compared to 30m m^3 of debris at Lituya bay), it would dissipate very quickly. This is because there isn't a relatively large amount of water being displaced - especially compared to a tsunami created on a convergent plate boundary. (e.g. 2004 tsunami)

In regards to how often, maybe more than we think, since in uninhabited areas they would only be noticed if the aftermath was observed (e.g. fell trees etc), and if the area is unfrequented by visitors then it would be even harder to spot as vegetation may have grown back. The last major landslide tsunami was Lituya Bay in 1958, and before that underwater slides such as the [1929 Grand Banks E'quake &amp; tsunami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Grand_Banks_earthquake), and the [Storegga Slide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storegga_Slide) about 8000 years ago.",2016-02-29 19:55:50+00:00,d0ifaxc,5.0,t1_d0i5rpc,13082,thalassophobia

The processes involved in forming this delta are pretty simple, so ELI5 should be ok. As you probably know, the river transports material downstream - pebbles, sand, mud particles etc. When water exits the mouth into the ocean, it loses a lot of energy, because it slows down a lot. Because it loses energy, it can't flow as fast, nor carry as much material. As a result, the material that was being transported is deposited into the ocean, out to sea. Over time, the deposited material builds up until it breaches the surface. This acts as a new river bed. Now, instead of depositing the material into the ocean bed, the river deposits it onto the newly made, shallow delta. Because of the depth, the water still can't flow fast, therefore it doesn't have a lot of energy. The larger material, such as smaller pebbles, and eventually sand/particles get deposited in the path of the river, so the water diverts around it. This is known as braiding. This carries on, with new channels and diversions being created, depositing material further and further out to sea. What you see hear is a culmination of 30 years of deposition.

It's pretty similar to when water flows over sand, like when you pour a bucket over sand on the beach. Because there isn't a lot of water it doesn't have enough power to move the sand on the beach out of the way, so it goes off into numerous streams.

105,"I've just finished Year 13 and am moving onto University. Doing 4 A levels is a pretty damn tough job, and you will need to put 110% effort into it, and revise as much as possible. I did 3 A levels, and 4 AS's, which was very hard in itself. I did Maths, Physics and Geography, so doing 2 Maths subjects is very tricky, from experience! Good luck and hope it goes ok, just remember doing 4 a levels is a very difficult task and you need to be prepared to sacrifice a lot of personal time to revise enough. You've got a while to decide yet, so just get focused on doing your current subjects.

In terms of impacts on your future, most Universities ask for 3 full a levels, and by doing 4 all you are doing is increasing your workload, whilst minimally decreasing entry requirments. E.g: University A wants 3 full a levels for a course, entry requirements AAB. If you do 4 A levels, it will probably become AABB or ABBB. The grade drop in 1 or 2 of your subjects is not worth the extra stress of an added subject imho. 

Speak to your tutors/teachers as much as you can, as they are the real experts and will be happy to help.

I'd definitely recommend subjects such as sociology / physics at GSCE for the human and physical aspects of the course, as Geography is a brilliant subject for linking in a lot of outside knowledge. 

History is a good subject, but Geography has such a wide span that includes loads of different subject areas, whilst still using the evaluative and argumentative / writing skills of history, and without trying to upset any historians, a lot of Geography is more relevant!
