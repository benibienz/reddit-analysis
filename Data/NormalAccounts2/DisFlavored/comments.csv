I can't speak for the lawsuit, but it sounds like a power play. He probably knows she can't prove the encounters, but mental abuse is real and someone will stand beside her. There are offices that represent abused women and they might be your best bet. If she has any texts or emails saved that point to his character, I would hold them to prove a pattern or ill intent.
