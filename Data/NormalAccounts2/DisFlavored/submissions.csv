I'm stuck in this horrendous loop of load screens that I can either let sit for 10+ min or just give up and close the game. I thought it was just Dragonsreach, but it's pretty much everywhere except for stores/inns. I tried deleting my Skyrim inis and letting the launcher rebuild them (per a Google search) but no go.

Many have mentioned that their map mods are the cause, but I don't have any of those. And the latest mods I downloaded were just followers and crafted gear. 

The only mods I have that alter cities or the areas in a heavy way are The People of Skyrim and Dawn of Skyrim (Director's Cut). I ruled out DoS because it doesn't alter open cities. I tried turning off TPoS, running loot, turning it back on, and running loot again. I'm not wholly convinced that my mods are causing this issue because it's just now starting and I've had most of these for quite a while.

Crap. So I think, hey, no biggie, I'll sell it to a player and make some extra money. After actually looking up how to do this, omg.

When people said they were selling houses to players in shouts or PF, I thought they were literally exchanging permits for gil or something. I didn't realize that people are basically saying ""I'll relinquish my land for x mil so you can buy it for the default x mil from the game."" 

I'm curious, has SE ever said why they would give a refund back to reclaimed land owners but not to those who relinquish it? Wouldn't refunding relinquished estates disuade players trying to sell to other players, which apparently has become so rampant that people are getting reported/banned?

I really hate to just give up my house with no money back, trying to get an Ishgard house. What are the ARR plot default prices?

I learned Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, and a small amount of Flash. I didn't learn web design, different printing techniques, how to save a ""clean"" file (still don't know what that is), or product design. 

I don't know if my university was just behind on what was current or what. I know that you're probably thinking ""Why are you waiting 3 yrs to say this?"" Well when I graduated, I spent about 3 months trying to find something while I lived off my savings and my then boyfriend's couch. There were either no jobs or I was clearly not qualified. Now, one non art job later, I'm in a new state looking for work. 

Once again I'm surrounded by jobs I'm clearly not qualified for. Reqs like 4 tone printing, animation, and word press experience. Then there's the min years of professional experience...

Basically what I'm asking is, what can I do to really get a shot at this? I'm using my savings to continue paying my student loans while my boyfriend pays for rent. I'm tired of feeling like an unsuccessful leech.

-----------------------

RESPONSE EDIT: Thank you guys so much for your advice, I honestly wasn't expecting so many replies! It makes me feel a whole lot better knowing that my college experience was pretty on par with everyone else. I thought that maybe because I schooled in a state that is popularized by hillbilly jokes that I had missed out.

And yes, I do have a portfolio but it largely consists of digital paintings because, at that time, I found my design assignments very lacking. This was actually an issue for a while in my logo class, my teacher called me out for ""always wanting to make pretty pictures."" For a while I was cruising 99Designs just so I could get practice and pieces for a portfolio.

For some reason, I always thought people were lying to me when they said that a lot of the reqs were to weed out the week. Thank you for confirming that they usually are. TBH, I think a lot of my issues come from my own self-doubt. I'm trying to work on it. I loved this: ""Embrace Rejection.""
