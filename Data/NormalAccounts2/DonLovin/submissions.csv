Gomez, Kolorov, Targget, (Baker, S.taylor)

Baker and Taylor are both injured, chances of Gomez and Targget playing are now slim. I know it serves me right for thinking short term but i didnt think it was going to get this bad.

i have 1FT and no money left. I was going to use that FT to get a nailed on defender in but now im tempted to make the Silva &gt; Kbd switch.

The rest of my team is

Silva, Sanchez, Countino, Mahrez (Cattermole)
Wilson, Aguero, Martial

what can i do?
