3,"With the caveat that I haven't played Shogun II in a while, the absolute priority number one is to [upgrade your rice farms](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/094/658/563.gif), followed by your roads. It really depends on your starting location, too, but IIRC the Mori clan has a gold province right next door to them. If you don't mind not getting some bonuses, upgrading trade goods to give more income can also be super helpful. 

Also, economic research is an absolute must. You really need to start off slow, don't be afraid to play defensively after your first few turns and maybe an initial war to grab a lucrative province. Slow and steady wins the race. 

Edit: also, with the really early game sieges, if the enemy only has that level one fort with no ranged units, you can literally just park your bow ashigaru outside the walls, turn their spearmen into pincushions, and win without losing a single man.

One day, he's talking with a new Salvadorean patient about the patient's newborn kid, and my dad mentions getting *culeros* a couple of times, since in Puerto Rico, that word means diapers. The patient is outraged, says something along the lines of how dare you speak about my child that way, and storms out. My dad is of course super confused, and when he talks to some of the medical staff (a couple of whom are Central Americans), he leaned that in Central America, *culero* is a more offensive term for ""faggot"". 

Since then, he's always given a little disclaimer to his new patients to the effect that he's from Puerto Rico, if he says anything that is offensive to them, he didn't mean it and to please let him know. 

On a less serious note, Puerto Ricans also use the words *paraguas* (literally means ""water stopper"") and *sombrilla* (literally ""small shade"") interchangeably for umbrellas. This led to a bit of confusion when I was hanging out with some Spaniards, since in Spain, *sombrilla* is used exclusively for parasols.

Freshman year was awesome, it was great being exposed to so many different perspectives (especially since my HS was basically filled with Champagne Socialist types and there was a very strong hive-mind mentality about most issues) and becoming a lot more aware of some issues, especially surrounding race but also gender and the like. Made a lot of great friends, had a ton of fun, learned a good deal, but also gained a great deal of appreciation, got some perspective but also realized that I will never be able to really have a full, grounded appreciation for all the things I take for granted. 

On the flip side, my absolute FAVORITE website^1 [The Toast](http://the-toast.net) announced that it would be closing (as in not making any new articles or anything) on July 1st, which is just... On the one hand, utter and absolute crushing sadness because it is the best humor/commentary/weirdness/serious essay website there is, but on the other hand all good things must come to an end and better it happen this way than it burn itself out. On a related note: I strongly recommend you guys read some (or most or even all) of the stuff that The Toast has posted, because it is brilliant and the site itself will stay up, and because it has actually good and nice comment sections that are moderated as fascistly (if not even more fascistly) than ours are (and of course this is meant in the best possible way).

After about three years of service in CorSec (Note: I may have to increase my character's age by a year to 28 to make things fit better), during which he earned several commendations, including [second-class Corellian Bloodstripes](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Corellian_Bloodstripe), he was involved in a raid on a Black Sun complex in Coronet City. The raid turned into an ambush (evidence collected during the raid suggests that some corrupt high-level officials in league with Black Sun had orchestrated the thing as a set-up)^1 and then into a bloody siege, as the initial Tactical Response Team force (of which Wes was a part) wound up cut off and besieged by a large number of Black Sun troops for several days before finally being relieved by CorSec and Imperial forces. Several in Wes's squad were killed over the course of the siege, while Wes and the a couple of other survivors from the initial infiltration team were awarded First-Class Bloodstripes, an honor that is usually granted posthumously. Wes himself was seriously injured during the siege, but made a full recovery. 

Shortly after the siege incident, Wes resigned his position in CorSec and joined the Imperial military. Due to his prior experience with CorSec, and thanks to several strong letters of recommendation from some of his superiors there, he was able to bypass most of the basic Stormtrooper training. He specialized as a shocktrooper, but also voluntarily underwent cold-weather assault training and some wilderness survival training. His first posting was guard duty at the Corellian Shipyards before his unit was sent to Alzoc III in order to pacify the local uncivilized population. He was then assigned to a posting on an *Imperial*-class Star Destroyer in the Outer Rim for a few months, pacifying some last Separatist holdouts which had flared up in a couple of sectors, before being rotated back to garrison duty at the Carida Academy, where he took the opportunity to take a few more specialist training classes. After the stint guarding the academy, he was assigned back to the *Evictus*.

The Chinese nation is not only composed of the *Han*, but also the *Man* (OOC: Manchus), *Meng* (OOC: Mongols), the *Hui*, and the *Zang* (OOC: Tibetans), so therefore we must strive for the unity of all of these many peoples to create a single union, for it is by their powers combined that we are ~~Captain Planet~~ the Chinese nation. We are equals, acting as partners in the construction of a new China. Indeed, the Chinese nation has been a multi-ethnic one for many centuries, and it is from that blend of unity and diversity that we have been able to draw great strength. 

As for the militarism, we spit on it. We have been forced to take up arms and fight to prevent nothing less than the annihilation of our nation by forces both internal and external. It is not a choice made willingly. We do it because we have no other option.

Does the Japanese government have no sense of decency, no sense of shame?

Your recognition of the Khan's mad reign, in addition to being a blatant violation of Chinese sovereignty, is a naked assault on the very principles that serve as the basis of modern governance. This self-proclaimed Khan has no moral right to rule over Outer Mongolia, save under the degenerate and barbaric principle of might making right. He is an unelected tyrant, unaccountable for his actions and answering to no one but himself. The consent of the governed plays no part in the Mongolian regime, and it is this which renders his rule not only illegitimate but also fundamentally unjust.

News of Indian Massacre sparks outrage in India and in House of Commons, Gen. Dyer praised by Lords

***

News of the massacre at the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, India has led to severe protests by many of the subjects of the British Raj and a strong call for a full inquiry by the House of Commons. The noted poet Rabindranath Tagore has renounced his knighthood in protest at the events of April 13th, and is reported to have written a passionate letter of protest to the Viceroy Lord Chelmsford. The House of Commons was also deeply disturbed by the news of the violence, with several MPs calling for the Government to carry out a full inquiry into the events, and if necessary to harshly discipline General Dyer. Gen. Dyer commanded the detachment of troops who allegedly opened fire into a meeting of natives, primarily Sikh, who had gathered to protest British rule in the subcontinent. Several eyewitness accounts obtained by *The Times* indicate that the crowd was unarmed, although Gen. Dyer and several Raj officials have insisted that the crowd, which had assembled in violation of martial law, was intent on revolution against British rule. It is these latter allegations that have lead many in the House of Lords to laud Dyer as a hero and as the saviour of British rule in India, an accolade which few MPs agree with. What is clear is that the incident in Amritsar will be bound to have further consequences and cause much more controversy and debate in the future, both in the halls of Parliament and among the general public. Furthermore, in this paper's opinion, the government will likely have no choice but to open an investigation into this most muddled affair.
