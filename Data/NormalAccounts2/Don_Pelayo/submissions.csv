The blaster fire was near-constant. There must have been at least two dozen pirates firing at them from the mall's upper levels or advancing on their positions on the ground level. No doubt that there would be even more hostile reinforcements coming shortly. Wes wasn't too worried, though. His position was not too exposed, and as long as the pirates were busy here, the bulk of his platoon would be fine. Sgt. Carvalho had already gotten most of his squad out of there, so it really would only be a matter of a couple more minutes until...

**grooooaaannn-crack**

Wes looked up *oh no* 

""GET BACK!!"" 

**BANG-CRACK**

Wes jumped out of the way, and tried to brace himself as best he could 

***CRASH***

***

All was still. Wes was trapped under a large piece of ceiling, which thankfully had not crushed him. Some of the others weren't so lucky. He could hear horrible screams somewhere to his right. He tried to pull himself out, but his legs were wedged in too tightly. 

He heard chatter on his comlink, a few feet past his head. He extracted his right arm and tried to reach, but it was useless. 

He could hear Bolek's voice through the static ""Lieu-*crackle*-llaeon? -*crack pop*-tenant! Do you copy? Lieut-*buzz-fizz-hisssss*"" 

***

Sgt. Major Shevchuk had gotten together what troops he could and had almost arrived at the Lieutenant's position when he started to hear single shots. *Those* ***BASTARD*** *coward pirates!* 

They burst into the atrium, finding a couple of pirates working their way through the wreckage, picking off what stormtroopers they could find buried under the debris. 

Bolek's stormtroopers made short work of them. 

""Have Sgt. Khare and her squad join what's left of Sgt. Carvalho's men and look for survivors. Sgt. Delacroix and her squad will keep an eye on our exit path."" 

***

Seven dead, five wounded. Sgt. Zhu had been crushed to death by a durasteel beam. The Lieutenant was probably the luckiest damn man in the sector: he'd made it through with barely a scratch, even though they'd needed a half-dozen troopers to lift up the chunk of duracrete he was wedged under. 

***

""We'll have to leave the bodies for now, I'll send word to command and have them send in a recovery team once we've hit the drop point."" Wes shook his head, ""Should've known such an old structure would be unstable...""

The sergeant major had the other stormtroopers start moving on ahead. ""Lieutenant, it's not your fault. There was nothing you could have done."" 

The lieutenant let out a sigh ""Come on, we've got to get moving again.""

***

It was all quite simple, really: When you had a fresh officer who actually gave a damn, no matter how much previous experience they had, they always seemed to blame themselves for every single loss and casualty their platoon suffered. Now, of course this was preferable to having a CO who treated you like disposable cannon fodder, but letting your CO wallow around in guilt is never a good thing. In Bolek's experience, ex-cops tended to be especially prone to this. And considering what he had read from Wes's service record, well... you don't resign a commission in a PDF *after* being decorated for bravery and recommended for further promotion for no reason. Hell, he'd even signed himself up as an enlisted man! 

But this would all have to be dealt with over time. Coruscant wasn't built in a day, after all. 

***

They'd finally made it to the drop site. *Lost a squad to get here, though*

""Eagle to nest. Eagle to nest. Do you copy?"" 

""Nest here, reading you loud and clear. What's your situation?"" 

*Wait, that's Lt. Colonel Farahani's voice! What in the hells does he want with us?* 

""We've taken losses, sir, but we made it. Securing the drop site now. We'll need a medevac too."" 

""Understood. Dropships and extraction is on the way. And congratulations on your commission, Lieutenant Pellaeon. I'd like you to meet with me once you've been extracted, we'll have some things to discuss."" 

""Understood, sir!"" 

""But don't rush yourself. I understand there will be letters and reports that you will want to be writing.

My first question is why was this? I understand that the war was extremely traumatic for France, so was there a sort of semi-official ""pact of silence"" like in post-Franco Spain? 

Second, and I hope I'm not breaking the 20 year rule here, how has the study of the Algerian War changed since ~1980s? It looks like that was about when it started to be discussed again by academics, so what sparked that change, and how has the understanding of that war and its repercussions evolved within France? I would also be interested to know if that academic discussion has led to changes in terms of how the more general public deals with and views the war, but that might be outside of the scope of both this sub and the 20 year rule.

It was finally time for his [Omega Exercise](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Omega_Exercise), which would be both his first taste of action as an officer and the last step of his Stormtrooper Officer training. Of course, he was experiencing some stress. It didn't help matters that this would be the first time he would be in any sort of combat in a couple of months, and his first taste of real action in almost a year. 

He had spent the last few weeks rushing to finish his work on a rather critical internal paper that several of the Imperial Academy's instructors, some junior and field officers, and a handful of officer cadets (those with prior military experience, that is) had been preparing. Ideally, the paper would get the Imperial brass to pull their heads out of their asses. His contributions were pretty much entirely in the volume on counter-insurgency, given his own experiences on the topic. Thankfully, a couple of the higher-ups were supportive of the report, and would provide cover for the rest of its authors. Considering that the report was basically a refutation of the Tarkin Doctrine's fear and terror tactics, and included several (veiled, vague, and plausibly deniable) criticisms of COMPNOR and the New Order's policies of chauvinist humanocentrism, over-centralization, and (more directly) the increased tendencies towards aristocratic elitism in the general staff and officer corps. Not that they were rushing to bring back the Jedi or the Republic, mind you. Still, Wes knew damn well that the report would not sit well with most of the Imperial brass, for obvious reasons. 

Getting shifted to a hardship post was a problem for the future, however. Right now, he had the mission to deal with. They had landed on Arion, an agriworld of very little significance in the Mid Rim. The planet's equatorial and sub-equatorial regions had a temperate/sub-tropical and fertile soil that allowed for year-long production of fruit, thanks to the absence of hard frosts throughout this region. All in all, it seemed a rather pleasant planet, filled with acre after acre of blooming fruit orchards, dotted with small, quaint rustic villages and the occasional landing field. The planet's capital, where they first landed, was only home to a few tens of thousands, but did host a (rather unremarkable) spaceport. 

But the fruit orchards was not why they were there. Beyond the planet's 45^th parallels North and South, there were vast frozen expanses of tundra, ice-choked snow-covered wastelands, and mountain ranges. And in the middle of those barren expanses, there was an old, abandoned mining colony. With a spaceport, a rather big and well-equipped spaceport that had been left there when the mining company folded. A spaceport that was now, apparently, home to a major pirate and smuggler resupply station. Because that's what happens when you leave a big-ass spaceport abandoned within a few dozen parsecs of a major hyper-route. *Damn PDF militia voidheads, not keeping an eye on anything but their parade uniforms*

He had met his new platoon only a couple of days ago, far too little time to get to know almost any of his NCOs well, but enough time to at least do a couple of training exercises with them. They were, apparently, specialists in urban combat and trained for cold weather assault, which had led Wes to think, correctly that the ""abandoned mining colony"" they were going into was neither very abandoned nor the small outpost that his briefing had implied. As for the platoon, they seemed a more than competent bunch: hopefully, this would be a cakewalk. Hopefully. And of course, there was **Sergeant Major Bolesław ""Bolek"" Shevchuk**, the platoon's senior NCO and Wes's second-in-command. He was a barrel-chested boulder of a man, a couple years shy of 40, round but not at all fat. He was indeed robust, but with a round, friendly face and a decidedly non-regulation haircut. He was mostly bald (which added to the overall roundness of his head) but he had kept [a single large lock of hair on the top of his head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chupryna), along with a thick walrus mustache. He was rather open about not giving a damn one way or another whether this was in fact against regulations, staunchly maintaining that it was his native custom and he'd be damned if he was going to go clean-shaven. The man could also drink a Devaronian under the table, no sweat. 

***

But back to the present. Wes looked over the holomap again: This place was clearly far larger than he had been led to believe by his own COs. As they approached in their dropships, it became clear that the [it was a ghost city](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rqyxcfjf4), block after block of near-identical duracrete structures stretching out for several kilometers. He joined the rest of the troopers in the ship and looked out at block after block of abandoned city, while the arctic wind battered away at their faces.  

""That's some fucking mining colony"" 

""I'd bet the brass thinks Coruscant is just a couple of huts and a well"" 

""And what'd that make Nar Shaddaa?"" 

""A flashy casino on top of a mountain of shit"" 

*Hah. She's right, too*

Their mission was clear enough: find and clear a landing site for a couple of Imperial Army battalions, who would handle clearing out what was obviously a full-fledged pirate garrison at the spaceport. Getting to the drop site that'd been picked out, however, would be a right pain in the ass. They touched down just south-west of the city, while the spaceport was (of course) on the city's north-eastern end, on the other side of a river that ran right through the city's heart. Behind them were the massive, ore-filled mountains that had brought the miners here in the first place. The wild wind whistled through old mining equipment, cranes and support struts groaned, protesting about the weight they had been forced to hold up for over a millennium now... 

""Listen up, it's gonna be about four klicks march from the LZ to the objective. Should be a milk run, but keep your heads down and your eyes open. The pirates don't know we're here,"" *I hope* ""and I'd like to keep it that way."" Bolesław then gave a few brief (if profane) words to rile up the troops before shouting at them to form up into a column. Wes joined the squadron taking point, while the Sgt. Major would direct and keep an eye on things further back in the column. 

They moved out into the silent streets of the city, all abandoned for 500 years, seemingly dead and all disturbingly empty. Desolate storefronts, all picked clean by a few centuries of scavengers, stood on street corners that once must have teemed with life. This city must have housed at the very least a couple hundred thousand beings, and it would have by far been the most important place on the planet. Once they got to the city center, it looked just like every other town in the galaxy, except... there was no one. 

Once they were a bit more than halfway there, things started to not go to plan. 

""Lieutenant, the bridge is out!"" 

*Sithspawn* ""Have the platoon set up a perimeter around that train station, we'll regroup and figure out which crossing to take."" 

***

The Pan-Galaxia Emporium shopping mall was a rather unique structure in a couple of ways, for a thousand-year old abandoned shopping mall. First, it was (much like everything else in this damn city) nearly perfectly preserved because of the cold, and still had quite good structural integrity. Second, the mall's developer had decided to splurge on being as showy as possible, and so built it spanning across the (admittedly narrow, but deathly cold) river that ran through the heart of the mining town. It had several entrances and levels filled with stores, a supermarket, a food court, and anything else a mining technician or corporate bureaucrat might want or need when they're stuck in the middle of nowhere. Unsurprisingly, the mall's main entrance was right next to what would have been a massive liquor store. 

""Real shame they packed everything up when they closed shop"" 

Bolesław agreed. ""Well, Lieutenant, I'm sure they must have left at least a few cases behind. Wouldn't hurt to take a look, would it?"" 

""Hah! I wish. C'mon, the less we stick around the better.""

They had managed to get to the other side of the river and were in the process of moving through the ground level of a four-floor atrium area when things well and truly went to hell. 

""Sergeant, I think I can see movement!"" 

""Then get behind something! Corporal, get me confirmation!"" 

""Can confirm, got a visual on someone... second level, behind us and to the left! They're armed, and appear to be searching the area."" 

""Lieutenant, we've got a visual on possible hostiles, second level!"" 

""Keep an eye on them, hold your fire until they've noticed us. I'd rather not have to fight on the low ground, and we're way out in the open here."" 

Sgt. Major Shevchuk, for his part, growled at the rearguard troopers to get their asses moving. They were the only ones left at the atrium's exit when shots started to ring out. 

""Blast it all, they've spotted us!"" 

""Sit Rep, now!"" 

""About a dozen hostiles to the platoon's rear, I think we can hold them off, but some support would be nice, sir!"" 

""Understood, Sgt. Major. I'm heading over there now with Sgt. Zhu's squadron. You keep them moving. We're only a couple hundred meters away from the exit. Is Sgt. Delacroix's squad free?"" 

""Affirmative"" 

""Head over to their position and get her people ready to start wiring up explosives on the columns I'll indicate on our way out. Once we're clear, we'll bring this side of the place down"". 

""Haha! The damned fools won't know what hit 'em!""

***

As Wes personally led the reinforcements into battle, Bolek Shevchuk smiled in approval *That new lieutenant is a quick one, and he definitely has guts. Thank god they've finally sent someone competent, I've had enough of dealing with spoiled brats and Emperor-botherers...* 

**BANG-CRACKA-*CRASH***

*Ah shit* Bolek turned back, fearing the worst. A good portion of the roof above the atrium had just caved in, taking with it all three levels of walkways and crashing into the first floor in a storm of broken glass, metal shards, ice, and now snow being blown in from the outdoors. Worst of all, he could no longer hear any firing *Oh god no*

""Lieutenant Pellaeon? Come in, Lieutenant! Do you copy? Lieutenant?"" 

Silence.

But after the Officer's Academy, what next? 

His last few months of service had been, quite bluntly, nothing short of disillusioning. His commanding officers seemed incapable of running anything resembling a counter-insurgency. They seemed to see every problem as a nail that needed to be hammered with overwhelming force. That wasn't how keeping the peace, that wasn't how law enforcement worked. He had seen how people here in the Outer Rim reacted when they saw that he was an Imperial. How when they were on leave on Cartve, the stupid actions of a couple of men *well, a pyromaniac and a peacock* had caused a full-blown revolt. How they had then bombed the planet into submission and claimed ""mission accomplished"". Bullshit. You don't drive hovertanks through a gang-ridden neighborhood, blow up a few buildings, and then leave and call it a job well done. You do that, you piss off the locals, the gangmembers just melt away into the next neighborhood or the local inhabitants, and when you go back on patrol there the next week, you get shot to death. You can't leave these at-risk areas alone to their own devices, either. He'd seen this on Nar Shaddaa, in a sense, with the growth of Black Sun groups. And if Imperial forces were using this same ""approach"" elsewhere? 

He knew what he would be doing after graduating the Academy, at least. He could have the chance to shape, or at least call attention to, Imperial policy on the insurgency.

### Background Information

Comes from a military family, his ancestors have served in both the Republic's military and in CorSec for as long as anyone can remember, and now, he serves the Imperial military. Distantly related (about third cousins, once removed) to a certain Gilad Pellaeon, who is also in the Imperial Military. Something of an intellectual type, coming from a rather politically active family, but has kept his own political opinions really only to himself so as to not harm his chances at a promotion. Wes himself started out as a CorSec officer, training at CorSec Academy after graduating from Corellia University. He stood out thanks to his great skill with explosives and steady markmanship, quickly earning himself a place in the crack Tactical Response Team. Through the years he spent in CorSec, he has further strengthened an already-inborn hatred of slavers and slavery in general, as well as nurturing his independent streak. 

The good times, however, would not last forever. In 15 BBY, he lost several members of his team during a botched raid on a major Black Sun hideout in Coronet, which eventually turned into a bloody siege. Throughout the course of the battle, Wes distinguished himself by his outstanding bravery, before being put out of action by injuries that would leave him stuck in a bacta tank for a week and convalescing in hospital for several months. That's all that was said in the holonet reports at least. He was awarded a Blood Stripe first class for his actions during that bloodbath, but soon after that incident, he resigned his position in CorSec, taking almost a year's leave (during which he got married to his fiancée, a CorSec pilot who he met during classes in the Academy) before signing up for service in the Imperial Army. It is clear that what happened during that siege still haunts him. 

Wes tries to be a father to his men, and has sworn to never leave a man behind. He feels a personal duty to keep the men under his command alive and well. However, he is... less than fond of overbearing authorities and more than a bit headstrong, just like any good Corellian is.

Angolans! Let those bloodsucking parasites know that we will not stand for this any longer! Let them know that the days in which they could dominate you are gone for good! On May first, put down your tools and march in protest against these dirty crooks from overseas who have stolen our land and grow rich off of our homeland's riches!

But what do we have left to lose? They have taken away our lives, which we spend working as slaves for their benefit and enrichment. They have stolen away our land and resources, which are even today being parceled out at the whims of the colonial government and foreign capitalists. They have tried to take away our identity and culture, forcing Catholicism down our throats and kidnapping millions of our people into slavery. They even seek to take away our future and the futures of our children, by condemning us to forced labor for their benefit. My brothers and sisters, you must rise up! The imperialists will tremble once they learn that their threats and empty lies no longer control us! On May First, we shall take the great first step on the road to our liberation! 

We will protest in the thousands, in the hundreds of thousands, in the cities, in the towns, even in the meanest villages and the most far-off plantations we shall make our voice heard! The ground shall shake under our righteous steps, and the entire world shall hear our cry for freedom!
