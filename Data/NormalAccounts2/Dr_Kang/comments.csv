1,"Alright heres the deal:
Lets say I am TEST as fuck. Lets say Im one of the reasons you are (yes you) are anywhere you are.  Lets say Im probably the reason youre in TEST.  Lets say Im the architect of TEST and Eve as you know it. You dont have to believe me because ive always been one of those behind the scenes niggers. Its cool.
But like I have all of the addictions. Like all of them. 
Im kinda at the point where I give up on humanity.  Like I just dont care.I truly dont care if I never get laid again.
But heres this community that I helped build; that almost seems to care if I fucked off.

2,The problem is as soon as we gay up a neighborhood in NYC ppl think its safe to live there.  Then we get Starbucks and WalMarts and it TOTALLY drives the homo cache down so we need to move out and gay up another neighborhood.,2016-08-01 08:21:56+00:00,d5zd2su,2.0,t1_d5zc6tl,2741.0,evedreddit

4,"Since I feel like I've done ~all of the things~ in the stable beta, I just opted into the experimental.  So far its a lot of crashes to desktop; nothing fatal.

5,"Sorry, apparently this only applies to the experimental build.  

That's the problem i have with the LoFi Kenshi forums-its never clear whether or not the poster is talking about the stable beta or the experimental.  Plus, there seems to be a little ""experimental master race"" type mentality over there.  Maybe I'm just looking into things too much.  Although the guy I quoted  poasts liek dis lol u c wut eye mean?  So I'm not sure what I expected.

Anyway, can confirm you can make a copper alloy plate bench and attendant storage in the experimental version.",2016-07-11 03:51:36+00:00,d57gv0s,,t1_d53c8xa,,Kenshi
6,"Any follow up? I'm very curious to know if he was depositing things, esp since he counted towards mine worker total.  From what we know of Hiver society, it makes sense that a lost drone would gravitate to a job that needs doing,as thats what they do-jobs.

If I may go on a slight Hiver tangent, I dig their area and them as a faction in general.  I sent my fastest ninja on an Ancient Science Book run through the Hiver villages, and just watched the NPCs mill about in the settlement closest to The Hub.  Maybe Im projecting, but the way they milled around really reminded me of the way ants move about when theyre hot on the trail of a dropped ice cream cone.

8,"I'd agree with everything the previous two posters said.

I just started playing a week ago with the Wanderer start and made my first town in the green valley just SE of Blister Hill.  Yes the Holy Nation nerds really chap my ass, but like all good fascists they keep the area relatively safe.(well safe for a given value of safe,anyway) All you'll have to deal with are dogs and starving bandits, which are a far far less dangerous entity for a brand new group than dust bandits.  So I built up, got stronger and relocated to the general area where it sounds you are now. 

If you don't want to do that, then get some sort of shelter down ASAP, and keep a sharp eye out for dust bandits while you're out working.  Soon as you see them, pull everyone inside, and lock the door.  Save often.  Then get a fence up using the same strategy.  It's going to take a while, but you'll eventually get there.",2016-07-09 16:19:28+00:00,d55mxav,1.0,t3_4rz2um,37291.0,Kenshi

""Postby Smiley Â» Mon Jul 04, 2016 9:56 am
I dunno at what tech lvl or anything but i guess most people who need the copper alloy plates are pretty far into the tech tree.

So if it aint there and ur playing on steam verify the entegrity of ur game cache.""

So yesterday Durr's in Mumble yelling at the top of his lungs ""LISTEN YOU AUTISTS IM TRYING TO TELL YOU ABOUT SHIT SO SHUT UP""

Then I noticed he had ""priority speaker"" on, so he was effectively trying to shout over himself.  I had a sensible chuckle, then ate some chocolate ice cream out of one of those little plastic batting helmets you get from Dairy Queen. I don't know where it came from; I found it in the back of the kitchen cabinet.
