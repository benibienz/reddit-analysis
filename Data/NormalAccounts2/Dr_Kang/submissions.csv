Neither Frogg Furnishing nor Terramart has opened for me.  All of the other shops have opened after their requisite quests/missions have been completed.

The following is a list of completions, and whats open or still closed for me:
Erchius Mining-Shipyard and 2 Stop Teleshop open, Frogg and Terrmart closed
Lost Teddy-Ursa Miner open
Dreadwing-Beakeasy open
Shockhopper-Biggy's open
Ceremonial Hunting Caverns-EASEL open

Additionally I have the Hyotyl and Avian missions completed, have upgraded my ship via the ""Totally Legal Goods"" merchant, and recruited a penguin from the Beakeasy.  Scanning the Outpost and the three tech obstacle courses are done as well.

I have played this in the campaign mode the whole way through, not once switching over to a multiplayer server; I know that has been an issue for others with this problem.

Possible issues:
-Mods. About half a dozen, but nothing in their respective discussions has indicated an issue with the shops opening
- /admin.  Not sure if this is an issue, but I've /admin'd my way through the three racial boss fights.  Frankly I came here for the crafting/exploration/colony building, and not metroidvania boss fights.  Not whining about it, just stating the use of /admin as a possible cause
-Deleted account.  I started one character, got to Erchius, realized that character was trash, deleted him and rerolled.

I'm going to go back and redo Erchius and delete my mods, any thoughts or advice in the meantime would be most helpful.",starbound,Unlocking Outpost shops in 1.1,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbound/comments/52ggkv/unlocking_outpost_shops_in_11/

Granted I haven't been everywhere yet, but wanted to make sure it was just a lack of exploration on my part rather than them not being implemented in the game as an actual item.

Anyone able to point me in the right direction?  The Kenshi wikia has them listed as a ""trade good"" without any further elaboration.

UPDATE-They do spawn at the Waystation trader.  They seem to get resupplied, albeit sporadically, every 24 hours.  Between two and six units appear in the trader's inventory at a time. 

Had my heavy squad parked outside of town waiting for the plates to resupply.  While we waited, recruited 13 new passersby of all races and abilities AND equipped them with the weapons and armor of the bandits and slavers that blundered into us.  Of course all of my new guys have the spiked helmets of the dust bandits and are all now retards, according to the ingame description of that item.  Such is the struggle in Kenshi.",Kenshi,Copper Alloy Plates?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenshi/comments/4reb08/copper_alloy_plates/
