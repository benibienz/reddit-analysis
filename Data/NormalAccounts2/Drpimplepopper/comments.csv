2,"That's an epidermoid cyst that is getting inflamed. You can see the punctum to the left of the raised whiter area. It looks like the cyst is under increasing pressure and close to the skin surface which is why you see some of the internal contents coming out from various areas. You need warm compresses and likely an incision and drainage soon... if you do an I &amp; D it will feel better very quickly because it's the pressure that develops that causes pain and discomfort which will likely worsen. Many people think these are infected but actually most commonly when we culture these the results are negative. The inflammation, redness and pain are actually due to the cyst breaking or bursting under the skin and creating a vigorous inflammatory reaction and it most often NOT due to bacterial infection. So actually, from a dermatologist here, I would classify this as a probable inflamed cyst not an abscess or a carbuncle. But, ya know.. I'm just giving you advice, and can't really diagnose and treat someone who's not my patient over the Internet! ;) if it gets worse go to urgicare or see your dermatologist!

Make sure they inject it with intralesional steroids to ""shrink"" the cyst down as much as you can so you can excise it with the smallest/shortest excision that you can. Don't keep squeezing/cutting it though. I know this is tempting bc it grows bigger and this shrinks it. However, the more times it gets inflamed the more scar tissue that forms and this likely won't make the cyst go away. It will probably return. Yes, there is scar tissue and you will have a scar there after a surgical excision but know that with your light complexion you will heal well and with a little makeup no one else will likely see a scar there.

Here are his questions: 

💥1) What is it about popping videos that you find so satisfying? What does it feel like when you watch a particularly spectacular pop? 

💥2) When did you see your first popping video? Do you remember which one it was? Also: was that when you realized that your interest in popping might be more intense than many other people's, or did you realize it earlier than that? Did you ever hide your interest in popping, or did you announce it proudly?

💥3) What is it about Dr. Lee's videos in particular that you like? Are there other poppers that you also think are doing an especially good (or, for a point of contrast, bad) job?

💥4. Do you prefer 'soft' pops (whiteheads and blackheads) or 'hard' pops (like pilar cysts, lipomas, etc.)? If you prefer one over the other, could you please try to explain why?

This technique is prob good for small comedones, pimples pustules and ingrown hairs. Not for larger blackheads and certainly not cysts. The needle would bend and break. Just shows there are many ways to pop a pimple! I can imagine estheticians doing this but the laws are diff in diff countries and even in different states. In California, the laws are pretty strict. I think estheticians are not allowed to pierce the epidermis (correct me if I'm wrong) so I don't think a needle like this would be technically allowed. Also they are not allowed to use a Comedone extractor which is why you will see many squeeze with qtips or gauze. Too bad bc they prob see more pimples than I do and could get some good ones!

Heck, I myself get annoyed listening to how often I say the same thing and ask if I'm hurting someone!! 
However I continue to do so, and will continue to do this because 1. Remember you have seen me do this MANY times but most of my patients have only seen and heard me do this once. 2. I would say that 75% of the time people will not tell you if they feel pain, and in general people equate pain with physician competence and excellence. If someone experiences pain during a procedure with me, they are more likely to think I am a not a good doctor. Also, asking the opinion of my patient  gives them some ""control"" in a situation where it's really easy to feel you are not in control. Remember as a dermatologist, I deal with people every day who are not under general anesthesia but who are completely awake and alert. I do not want them to feel uncomfortable and frightened. 3.  Although I may be a chatterbox during surgery I would say that socially I'm not a big chatterbox (except with people I know well). In fact, I think strangers who meet me may think I'm a b*tch bc I HATE small talk and would rather go talk to people i know. This is because I make small talk all day every day at work and I don't wanna do it anymore at home or when I'm relaxing! During surgery I purposefully talk about everything and nothing bc this is ""talkasthesia"". Did you know that when I cut into the scalp or the face often the patient can't feel this but can hear the sound of it through their head? This can make many people freak out. When I talk, I distract them from hearing the sounds of surgery, the snipping of the scissors or the sound of the blade cutting thru skin. 

And there you go! That took me about 10 min to type in my phone during my lunch break... Now back to work and more small talk!! ;)

However, this pic is the type that I ""like"" because it's clean - it looks like half of the wall of a pilar cyst sac, no evidence of infection (such as staph). Nice and clean removal. Pilar sac walls are usually thicker then that of epidermoid cyst/sebaceous cysts. Btw if any doctor calls a growth on you a ""sebaceous cyst"" I'd bet money s/he is not a dermatologist (even if they claim they are) bc this is a ""layman"" or non-Derm term. this descriptive word is misleading and incorrect.

185,"I'm a dermatologist who is a surgeon, and it sounds like you may have had a pilomatricoma- it's not technically bone that is there, but it is calcium deposition which makes the growth (not really a cyst) very firm and hard, almost like a pebble or rock. 
Also, sounds like you saw derms who are not surgeons,  but many of us are! There are many sub specialties within dermatology. And yes it's a very competitive specialty to get into. In fact, there are many physicians who practice dermatology who did not complete Derm residencies, and they do this because they can't financially survive as a physician in their own trained specialty or they are unhappy in their trained position. So consider that perhaps the doctor you saw was not truly board certified in dermatology and this may be the reason for misdiagnosis and/or inability to remove the growth surgically him or herself. 
We as Derm surgeons perform surgery using mainly local anesthesia and personally if I had a growth like you had I would seek out the help of a dermatological surgeon many/most who have fantastic surgical skill. It's complicated but there could be many reasons why you weren't referred to one. A common reason is because there are no derm surgeons in your area, or the derm practice you have visited doesn't want to refer you to another group of dermatologists who have a derm surgeon because then they are afraid they will lose you to the other's medical practice.

197,"OK, so I have really tried to avoid this case primarily because I don't want to give medical advice to anyone that I haven't seen as a patient in person.. I don't think this is a good way to practice medicine/dermatology. 
Also, I have not seen the video, I have only seen a pic, and I will comment not directly about this patient but about keloids in general
I see many patients with keloids and I have seen some very dramatic extensive cases in my practice.  Keloids are NOT easy to treat, there is no single option that works in every patient, and there is no single definitive treatment option. There is not a single amazing doctor that you need to travel across the world to see that can solve all your keloid problems. There is no ""Dr King or Queen of Keloids"" who can do something that others cannot.  There is no special surgical technique that works that one certain doctor uses that will eradicate all keloids.  Sometimes a treatment works, and oftentimes it doesn't. I personally would NEVER claim that my technique is better than anyone elses. It's the luck of the draw that a keloid goes away and stays away.  I guess the skill is in knowing what all the techniques are that are out there, and counseling your patient about the frustration involved, and the low success rate.  Personally, I would be a little suspicious of a physician who claims that they can definitely cure anyone and everyone of their keloids.  Keloids are caused by trauma - and some people are just more prone to developing them. The problem is that surgical removal is a form of trauma - and when a keloid is removed it often comes back much bigger, and much worse than it was before. I have seen this happen countless times. This has nothing to do with the skill of the doctor or surgeon treating it - this has to do with the keloid itself and how keloids behave.  
So I can't give advice on treatment options for him that I could guarantee could help him or anyone with keloids.  Sometimes treatments work sometimes they don't, but the larger the keloid, the more difficult and fewer the treatment options. This patient will have a hard time getting rid of his keloids I'm sorry to say but I wish him luck and all of you looking out for him are truly great people.
