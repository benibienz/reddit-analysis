The despair that Subaru faces is extremely similar to the time travel in Steins Gate and the things that occur in Higarashi. 

Steins Gate starts off slow, but it picks up quickly after that. Both Okabe and Subaru face similar situations where they are unable to change the future even with information of it. Well, they can change it, but it never seems to lead anywhere in the end.

Higarashi is more on the psychological and horror side compared to the other two, but it does the horror better than any other anime or even movie that I've ever seen. The horror isn't that of seeing a mutilated body, but rather that of paranoia. The greatest fear isn't being forced to see beating hearts being ripped out, but rather the fear that something is always behind you, making you scared to look back. Higarashi shows so well what paranoia can do to the characters as they are normal happy children that are being driven insane. Higarashi is also much more confusing than the other two anime, but everything will fit together after watching both seasons. I'm going to refrain from saying the most striking similarity between Higarashi and Re: Zero, because it was a shock for me, who went into Higarashi blind.
