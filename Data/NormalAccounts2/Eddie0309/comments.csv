You sound like a wonderful person, and so does your boyfriend. He seems like he's a very nice guy, and if he has done nothing to raise any of these thoughts then I wouldn't think that you would have to worry very much about him.

In all honesty, I feel like in any relationship, be it a friendship, parent to child, student to teacher, communication and honesty are the most important things. I'd say the best thing to do is get on the phone with him and tell him everything you've said here. Talking about problems fixes them before they get much worse, especially if you're long distance.

This uncertainty that instead of moving our minds, we simply copied ourselves would never really go away. How do you know that you’re actually not just killing yourself and uploading a copied mind onto a computer…It’s a creepy thought.
