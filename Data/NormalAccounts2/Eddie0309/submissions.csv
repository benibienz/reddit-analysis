However, I know that the Snowball can be really iffy with mounts, for example, to fit it on the [NEEWER Scissor Arm Boom Stand](https://www.amazon.com/NEEWER-Microphone-Suspension-Scissor-Stand/dp/B00DY1F2CS/ref=pd_sim_23_7?ie=UTF8&amp;dpID=41nstg4dlyL&amp;dpSrc=sims&amp;preST=_AC_UL160_SR134%2C160_&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=GG0JM4H0DMAEFN0H4WYW) you have to unscrew the little plastic thing on the mic clip that comes with it, screw that into the Snowball, and then mount all of that onto the scissor arm, as shown in [this video](https://youtu.be/WZCxtaqzvgA).

I saw how Mari and Stacey have things set up and I see that they are in fact using a boom stand, nonetheless exactly the same way I would have liked to. Their setup can be seen on their Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/GeekRemix/status/627196386287726592) and on their Tumblr [here](http://geekremix.tumblr.com/post/119069549827/our-recording-set-up).

My question is, if I were to get the tripod stand linked above, would I need to get anything else to actually mount the Snowball onto it, like Mari and Stacy did? Or better yet, does anyone know what exactly they did to be able to set it up like that? It looks like they have some sort of clip that the Snowball is hanging from.

Thank you in advance!

(The reason I can't just settle with the NEEWER scissor arm is that my desk doesn't have an overhang to clamp the stand onto, let alone in the angle I need it. Having a floored tripod stand would be much more convenient and actually functional :D )",GeekRemix,Anyone know how Mari and Stacy have their Blue Snowball mic mounted on that tripod stand?,https://www.reddit.com/r/GeekRemix/comments/4vfd1c/anyone_know_how_mari_and_stacy_have_their_blue/

I've always been interested in learning to do something similar, what with the floating particles and bubbles and such, but I could never find a tutorial or anything similar anywhere.

Would anyone happen to know how to recreate this effect? If I were to use it, it would be used as a scene in OBS. 

Note that I do not actually stream or make videos at the moment, but I am going host a stream for my game studio in sort of a  podcast format, so I thought ""Why bore viewers with a still image?"", you know?

Unless that's perfectly fine. I don't know how this shit works.
