Since i just finished my college semester, i now have time to do this, and i would like to ask some questions here. I believe this is the most appropiate place to ask.

First of all, to clarify, i live in Chile, and computer parts are extremely over priced here (for reference, an i5 4590 costs arround $250, and an MSI R9 290X costs $570).

I would like to ask you guys 2 things:
1-Is this project viable? Would i be able to profit from it? I have to consider that here, few people have the knowledge of building a pc, so almost everyone prefers to buy a prebuilt one.
2-If the answer to the previous question was yes, then what would be the ""ultimate"", most affordable, and better price v/s performance gaming rig? Im looking into the 200-250 and maybe 300 dollar price range.

I hope someone can answer this questions, and im really looking forward to reading them! Any help would be much appreciated!",buildapc,[Discussion] /(Build help) Mini pc-building project.,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/3y6w6t/discussion_build_help_mini_pcbuilding_project/
