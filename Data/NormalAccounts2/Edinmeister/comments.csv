21,"one important thing is kiting. Move away from the monsters if u have attacked them, until u can autoattack them again. The creeps will move towards u and wont attack until u stop to auto them again. If u practice this, u will be more healthy after ur clear and can sustain a lot better. A good tip is, clear scuttle crap after your first buff (blue/red). It ensures vision and restores your health because of your jungle item and the fact that it doesnt attack back!

Edit: practice your clear with graves, the tips should be really helpfull and u shouldnt have a problem with a full clear even without runes, if youre kiting the creeps correctly.
