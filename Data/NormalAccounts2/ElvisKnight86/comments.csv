17,"Read an article on comicbookmovie.com that broke it down in a very detailed fashion. It came to the conclusion that batman had been fighting crime for 10 years. Five years between BB and TDK. His last sighting was at least 8 years before TDKR, leaving at least 5 years of more crime fighting. 

""So in conclusion, the timeline of Christopher Nolan's Batman films start at 2002 and end at 2017. Bruce has been Batman far longer than people actually believe. 5 years between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, as opposed to the generally believed 1 year. Also since the last ""confirmed"" sighting of the batman was 8 years before The Dark Knight Rises, Bruce could have still been active as Batman for, at least, another 5 years. This gives Nolan's Batman 10 years of crime fighting. This also explains why his body by The Dark Knight Rises is a total mess. "" comicbookmovie.com.

The best in other sports are used for their performance and if they are hurt, well, you use a backup or reserve. With the team swapping and such we have seen upgrades bringing the unfair advantage when it matters the most, using a team you didn't use to get there.
