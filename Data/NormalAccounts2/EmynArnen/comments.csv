2,"It wasn't exactly like that. He was talking about how they're working on a patch, a guy complained about how his GTX 1070, 16 Gb RAM and 4690k was only getting 40 FPS in Karnaka and the dev stated that Very Low settings 1080p was on 60 FPS on their intern testing. Also, there is not a huge difference beween Ultra and Very Low on this game (It's noticeable, but we all know games that basically look like years apart when you change from low to ultra), I guess due to ""Don't make consoles look bad against PC"". This is not an excuse though for the absurdly poor performance, specially on the AMD side (Thanks again, Nvidia GameWorks...), and they have to fix it as soon as possible. Specially this last part. I'm an Nvidia user and yes, cranking up GameWorks makes parts of some games looks gorgeous. HairWorks on FarCry 4 made some of the most realistic animals I've seen in a game. Still, how Nvidia manages it is a massive dickmove, not letting AMD even take a peek at it to make drivers for it. Sure, AMD should step up it's game, but Nvidia aggresive attitude with implementing GameWorks on major releases is quite a shady competition imo. For example, TressFx is comparable to HairWorks, and it's free and open source. FreeSync doesn't add cost to the product while Gsync does. 

TL;DR: Dev words misinterpreted, they're supposed to be working on performance fixes. Very Low vs Ultra not that different on this game, but still needs a lot of work.",2016-11-12 11:58:15+00:00,d9x30ua,1.0,t3_5chm5w,45212.0,pcmasterrace

Tension started growing in the Spanish National Team because Madrid players and Barça players had too many open fights from those matches because of how Mou throwed shit to everyone. To solve it, Casillas started talking with Xavi and Iniesta so everything could calm down in the National Team. Since then, Mou started his crussade against him, not letting him play and therefor making him worse from the lack of practice (and that's why his latest matches with RM were far from being his best shape) and hardcore fans saw those calls as treason, as if he was selling RM honor to the eternal rival.
