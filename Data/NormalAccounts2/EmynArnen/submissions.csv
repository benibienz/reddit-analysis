If you compare Hearthstone with other major eSports, it's the only one  along with CS without either a test realm or community feedback getting considered while creating a patch or an expansion. If you browse customhearthstone you'll find a lot of interesting cards for all the classes. Some are overpowered, some are not, but they're interesting ideas nevertheless. 

Being more proactive in this matter and not just saying ""there will always be a worse class in the game"" would only benefit Blizzard. The way of fixing the game is not what they did to shaman, which was in a poor state and in two expansions got some fucking insane cards. Eventually there will be an expansion where priest gets buffed to the roof, and then another class will end up being garbage.

To be honest, while I see them post sometimes, I don't know if they will ever read this or will ever consider this or any of the hundreds of times it has been said before. But if that happens: Blizzard, please, either create a PTR for hearthstone or make more ""designer insights"" and have in consideration what people says about the things you show. It will eventually mean better content, people happier with the game and what you really care for: a longer lifespan for hearthstone.",hearthstone,The solution to Priest being garbage is something Blizzard already does in other games: PT servers,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/4wkgbe/the_solution_to_priest_being_garbage_is_something/

And hey, it has a decent action camera on it for like 60 bucks. Pretty good deal only for that.

So, about 2 weeks after getting it I start the game and decide to redeem all the content on the season pass. But an error message pops ups, saying that my code is unvalid. No more info, just that.

We met some weeks ago and it has been like a fairytale so far. We started just like 2 people that are comfortable with each otehr, but it grew very fast to something more. We're in love, we need to be with each other constantly. We're both quite depressive as we have had a lot of problems growing up, but when we're together we're just happy and nothing more matters. A couple of days ago we went to a bar just to hang out, Even though we both tried to kiss each other, we stopped as we knew what would happen. Her boyfriend doesn't know about this, he just knows that she was with me that morning, and he's now acting insanely jealous, like if she had been cheating him with me for months, when nothing actually happened. He's mad because she's happy, basically because I'm the one that makes her happy. So, most of you would say the solution is quite easy, but it's not. She really wants to break up with him now, not for me but for how he's treating her, but there are 2 big problems: It's a 3 year relationship (2 of them living together) and she wants to end it properly and try not to hurt him, but as he's very egocentric he will never see that it's because how he's treating her, he will think it's because of me. Now he has prohibited her to even speak to me. He tries to control her phone constantly. He wants her to delete me from her life at any cost, even her own happiness, and she's too afraid to leave him yet. This is killing her. The only moments she laughs or basically stops feeling like a pile of crap are those when we completely ignore the ""don't talk to him"" rule and I call her and spend time on the phone. I can't stand seeing her feel like that. She's the most incredible woman i've ever met. She's kind, comprehensive, talkative... She's completely perfect. And he would rather kill her personality than leave her be happy. So far, the only solution that would avoid all this to blow up is that I leave her. But that would kill her. Probably literally. And leaving him and having a hard break up would end probably the same way. How can something so beautiful be so wrong? Still, we regret nothing, and we will be together as soon as we can, but until we get to that point... it's going to be very hard. Specially for her.",confession,"Met a girl, fell in love with each other, but she's on a relationship and it's killing us.",http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/3e7rt0/met_a_girl_fell_in_love_with_each_other_but_shes/

I'm a 20 year old guy, and my love life usually sums up in: I meet a girl, I really like her, even though I'm incredibly shy, I ask her and then she says how much she likes me and all that but then dumps me for another guy and never talk to me again. Time after that, the guy (surprise surprise) turns to be a douche and either cheats on them or just gets tired and dump them. They come back to me saying how sorry they are and how they regret what they did and how she should have chosen me, I help them to feel happy and confident again, and instead of giving me the chance they say they should have given to me on the first moment, they go again for another guy that also turns to be a douche.

To be clear, I'm not only going for the ""average hot girl that bangs the first gym guy she sees"".
