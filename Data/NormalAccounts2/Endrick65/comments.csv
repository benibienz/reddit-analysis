24,"I can think of a few things...

Roll in showers with either large fold down shower benches or having large quality shower benches in the room or available...  I've been in more than a few hotels where they have no bench or moveable shower benches at all... One hotel even had to send someone to a medical supply place for one because they had none on premises... 
Those small shower stools are useless and dangerous... 

Lots of room for a wheelchair to manuver... make sure there is at least 5 feet of space at the side of the bed for a large wheelchair to turn around... and make sure there's still that 5 feet of space AFTER all the furniture is in the room...
Also the walking space between the dresser and bed needs to be at least 3.5 feet... 

Electrical outlets need to be up higher and there needs to be more than the standard 2 near the bed... I travel with a Bi-Pap machine and an battery charger for my power chair...  I can't tell you how many times they've had to send up heavy duty extension cords for me because the bed side lights and alarm clock have taken all the outlets already... Oh and burying the outlets behind the bed is no good... 
One hotel had to send up maintenance to move the bed so I could plug in my charger and Bi-Pap... ",2015-11-08 21:27:47+00:00,cwta623,1,t3_3rsftl,185204,disability
