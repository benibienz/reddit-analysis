""Mr. Trump's been trying to tell America what's going on, but they seem to have a deaf ear to reality. Because he doesn't have the eloquent speaking ability or the lawyer ability to lie, it seems to be easier to humiliate Trump. Treason is happening in this country and nothing is being done about it. I used to be a proud American, but if Clinton's get in, our pride goes out the door. How many private citizens would take on these corrupted folks and with their own money. Just what do they think he'll gain? Oh yeah, maybe pride and courage back into our country with no apologies to anyone for being who we are; a GREAT Nation, under God, with Liberty and Justice for all! God Bless Donald Trump for all his efforts to save our country.""",2016-10-12 03:22:00+00:00,d8obdz3,2,t1_d8nqvnl,28176,The_Donald

We absolutely have a criminal entity, the Clinton crime family in league with the global elitists and big banks actively trying to take down trump and gain control of our white house and our government, ultimately our lives.  They are desperate and running scared, because they know if trump gets in, he is representing, finally, WE THE PEOPLE, where every corrupt rock Will be turned over and exposed.  That means Hillary goes to prison, which means bubba, finally, goes to prison, which means Obama goes to prison, so many in the corrupt establishment go to prison, possibly some of the Bushes, some in the media, the Clinton corrupt cronies, the whole disgusting BIG BANK GLOBALIST ESTABLISHMENT will have the spotlight of the people and the constitution shined on it, and the cockroaches Will come running out!  Trump has a potty mouth, but these slimy, criminal, corrupt entrenched elitists cannot be exposed for their criminality, so they must take down the ONLY one exposing them.   They are trying to hide EVERYTHING coming out in wikileaks, and THAT is the big story, one of utter cronyism corruption, that deceives and controls WE THE PEOPLE.  the ONLY way ALL this stops and we are rescued from becoming a banana republic is for David to beat goliath!

633,"The year was 1983.  I was a 21-year-old cute bartender who worked in a happening nightclub.  I was driving home late one night at about 3 a.m. along I-95 in Connecticut.  I was in the middle lane and it was raining terribly.  I was almost out of gas, but I figured I had enough to make it home. 

Thank goodness I was alert enough to notice a white van drive by me in the slow lane.  My radar went on when I noticed the van drive past me and the driver hid his face from my view.  The vehicle looked shady and it had a New York license plate.  I was very aware of this van and I noticed during the drive home that the driver had maneuvered his vehicle behind mine and was maintaining a distance.  As I got off the exit to get home, I watched in my rear view mirror as the white van also exited a distance behind.

I was freaking out because I was almost out of gas and my house was approaching.  I didn’t want to stop because I knew I was in danger and I didn’t want him to know where I lived.  I drove past my house and decided to take a right hand turn to see if he would follow.  Sure enough, I could see the van’s headlights make the same right turn.  I drove past the local convenience store, hoping that a police officer would be parked there.  The area was dark and deserted.

I had no choice but to drive to the local police station which was about 7 miles away.  I remember the terror I felt during that long drive.  It was 3:30 a.m., pouring rain, the town was deserted and cell phones weren’t invented yet.   This white van followed me through several neighborhoods.  I took a right-hand turn onto the road where the police station was and he continued to follow me!

I parked my car in front of the police station and ran inside.  I noticed the white van speed away.  I remember that when I ran up to the policeman to tell him what happened, I was paralyzed and couldn’t speak.   I think that is the only time in my life where I couldn’t talk due to terror. 

So that’s the happy ending; I made it to the police station!  My car didn’t run out of gas!  Perhaps the lesson in this story is preparedness.   Always be aware of what’s going on around you and make sure you have enough gas and cell phone power when driving, especially at night.

889,"Hello  Reddit—

I have a story to share with you, which few people know about.  Fortunately it has a happy ending and my sharing this experience might save some lives.

The year was 1983.  I was a 21-year-old cute bartender who worked in a happening nightclub.  I was driving home late one night at about 3 a.m. along I-95 in Connecticut.  I was in the middle lane and it was raining terribly.  I was almost out of gas, but I figured I had enough to make it home. 

Thank goodness I was alert enough to notice a white van drive by me in the slow lane.  My radar went on when I noticed the van drive past me and the driver hid his face from my view.  The vehicle looked shady and it had a New York license plate.  I was very aware of this van and I noticed during the drive home that the driver had maneuvered his vehicle behind mine and was maintaining a distance.  As I got off the exit to get home, I watched in my rear view mirror as the white van also exited a distance behind.

I was freaking out because I was almost out of gas and my house was approaching.  I didn’t want to stop because I knew I was in danger and I didn’t want him to know where I lived.  I drove past my house and decided to take a right hand turn to see if he would follow.  Sure enough, I could see the van’s headlights make the same right turn.  I drove past the local convenience store, hoping that a police officer would be parked there.  The area was dark and deserted.

I chose to drive to the local police station which was about 7 miles away.  I remember the terror I felt during that long drive.  It was 3:30 a.m., pouring rain, my gas tank is on E and the town was deserted and cell phones weren’t invented yet.   This white van followed me through several neighborhoods.  I took a right-hand turn onto the road where the police station was and he continued to follow me!

I parked my car in front of the police station and ran inside.  I noticed the white van speed away.  I remember that when I ran up to the policeman to tell him what happened, I was paralyzed and couldn’t speak.   I think that is the only time in my life where I couldn’t talk due to terror. 

So that’s the happy ending; I made it to the police station!  My car didn’t run out of gas!  Perhaps the lesson in this story is preparedness.   Always be aware of what’s going on around you and make sure you have enough gas and cell phone power when driving, especially at night.
