41,"Here are a few more conclusions from the 2013 NAP report ""Priorities for Research to Reduce the Threat of Firearm-Related Violence"":

* ""The U.S. rate of firearm-related deaths is the highest among industrialized countries. In 2010, incidents in the U.S. involving firearms injured or killed more than 105,000 individuals (including 19,000 suicides).""

* ""In the past decade, firearm-related violence has claimed the lives of more than a quarter-million people in the United States. By their sheer magnitude, injuries and deaths involving firearms constitute a pressing public health problem.""

* ""The complexity and frequency of firearm-related violence combined with its impact on the health and safety of the nation’s residents make it a topic of considerable public health importance and suggest that a public health approach should be incorporated into the strategies used to prevent future harm and injuries. public health approach involves three elements: (1) a focus on prevention, (2) a focus on scientific methodology to identify risk and patterns, and (3) multidisciplinary collaboration to address the issue. Public health strategies are designed to interrupt the connection between three essential elements: (1) the “agent” (the source of injury [weapon or perpetrator]), (2) the “host” (the injured person), and (3) the “environment” (the conditions under which the injury occurred). This public health approach has produced successes in reduction of tobacco use, unintentional poisoning, and motor vehicle fatalities.""

* ""The exact number and distribution of guns and gun types in the United States are unknown, but for each of these populations it would be valuable to have counts of total guns owned, their attributes (i.e., general type, caliber, firing mechanism), how the guns were acquired (i.e., purchased, received as a gift, traded for, stolen, etc.), and information on the sources of the guns (i.e., licensed gun dealers, friends or relatives, gun traffickers, owners of stolen guns, and so on).""

* ""At the community level, a range of factors appears to be related to high levels of gun use. These factors include high rates of poverty, illicit drug trafficking, and substance use.""

* ""A number of individual behaviors and susceptibilities are associated with firearm violence and injury. Impulsivity, low educational attainment, substance use, and prior history of aggression and abuse are considered risk factors for violence (for both perpetrators and victims).""

* ""The committee identified the following key research topics as priorities for research on risk and protective factors: Identify factors associated with youth having access to, possessing, and carrying guns.""

* ""Unauthorized gun possession or use is associated with higher rates of firearm violence than legal possession of guns. Controlling access to guns through background checks or restrictions on particular types of firearms remains controversial, and the effectiveness of various types of control is inadequately researched. Research on the impact of imposing additional penalties for firearm use in illegal activities has also produced mixed results. Studies on the impact of right-to-carry laws on firearm violence also have inconsistent results and have been debated for a decade.""

* ""Community-based programs and focused policing interventions in general have been found to be effective in reducing violence in some settings (e.g., high-risk physical locations) and appear to be more effective than prosecutorial policies, including mandatory sentences. Moreover, regulations that limit hours for on-premise alcohol sales in pubs, bars, and nightclubs have been associated with reduced violence.""

* ""There are both active and passive technologies that may have an impact. Passive technologies—for example, technologies that recognize person-specific features such as voice, hand geometry, iris scans, and fingerprints—are those that confer a safety benefit without requiring any specific action by a user. Active technologies require a specific action by a user to enable the technology—for example, to activate a firearm a user has to produce an item that activates the firearm (e.g., tokens, magnetic stripe badges, or proximity cards).""

* ""More than two-thirds of victims murdered by a spouse or ex-spouse died as a result of a gun-shot wound"" (between 2007 and 2011).

* ""More than 600,000 victims of robbery and other crimes reported that they faced an assailant armed with a gun"" (between 2007 and 2011).

* ""Even when defensive use of guns is effective in averting death or injury for the gun user in cases of crime, it is still possible that keeping a gun in the home or carrying a gun in public—concealed or open carry— may have a different net effect on the rate of injury. For example, if gun ownership raises the risk of suicide, homicide, or the use of weapons by those who invade the homes of gun owners, this could cancel or outweigh the beneficial effects of defensive gun use. Although some early studies were published that relate to this issue, they were not conclusive, and this is a sufficiently important question that it merits additional, careful exploration.""

* ""Violence, including firearm-related violence, has been shown to be contagious. Recognizing this, the academic community has suggested that research examine violence much like is done for contagious diseases.""

* ""Motor vehicle–related injury reduction provides a useful analogy for using a public health approach to a problem that also has criminal justice considerations. For example, in both motor vehicle and gun use, there is a need to balance health and safety with the practical reality of a potentially dangerous tool that is embedded in U.S. society.""

* ""The scarcity of research on firearm-related violence limits policy makers’ ability to propose evidence-based policies that reduce injuries and deaths and maximize safety while recognizing Second Amendment rights.""

* ""Since the 1960s, a number of state and federal laws and regulations have been enacted that restrict government’s ability to collect and share information about gun sales, ownership, and possession, which has limited data collection and collation relevant to firearm violence prevention research. Among these are the amendments to the Gun Control Act of 1968, which prohibits the federal government from establishing an electronic database of the names of gun purchasers and requires gun dealers to conduct annual inventories of their firearms. In addition to the restrictions on certain kinds of data collection, congressional action in 1996 effectively halted all firearm-related injury research at the CDC by prohibiting the use of federal funding “to advocate or promote gun control. In 2011, Congress enacted similar restrictions affecting the entire U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The net result was an overall reduction in firearm violence research. As a result, the past 20 years have witnessed diminished progress in understanding the causes and effects of firearm violence.""

* ""Basic information about gun possession, acquisition, and storage is lacking. No single database captures the total number, locations, and types of firearms and firearm owners in the United States. Data about the sources of guns used in crimes are important because the means of acquisition may reveal opportunities for prevention of firearm-related violence.""

* ""Fatal and nonfatal firearm violence poses a serious threat to the safety and welfare of the American public.""

* ""The U.S. rate of firearm-related homicide is higher than that of any other industrialized country: 19.5 times higher than the rates in other high-income countries.""

* ""A recent estimate suggested that firearm violence cost the United States more than $174 billion in 2010 (Miller, 2010). However, it is essentially impossible to quantify the overall physiological, mental, emotional, social, and collateral economic effects of firearm violence, because these effects extend well beyond the victim to the surrounding community and society at large.""

This means that those who die from gunshot lose significantly more years of life expectancy than those who die from heart disease, cancer, respiratory disease, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and even falls.

Thus, a more appropriate comparison between these leading causes of death would be the rate at which years of life expectancy are lost. With such an approach, the death rate due to gunshot becomes much more important. ",2016-11-07 01:16:16+00:00,d9oxqfb,8.0,t1_d9owmur,1595.0,GunsAreCool

Regarding the comparison of gunshot death rates to fall death rates, in 2014, CDC reports 33,018 people died from falls, where as 33,599 people died from gunshot.  The average fall victim was undoubtedly a senior citizen near the average life expectancy of ~78 years, whereas the average gunshot victim was somebody still in the prime of life.

51,"&gt;Just to be precise, the age-adjusted gunshot death rate from 2012 to 2014 was 10.4 deaths per 100,000 people *per year*.

52,"&gt;Even when we take the most liberal estimate of gun violence there is still a **half percent** of the population that is experiencing these negative outcomes.

Moreover, if the ratio of nonfatal firearm injuries to firearm deaths continues, **~2.6% of the population in the U.S. will be shot within their lifetime** (the math on this gets tricky, but essentially this percentage is based on empirical evidence that for every gunshot victim who dies, there is another gunshot victim who survives and eventually dies of natural causes).",2016-11-06 23:47:34+00:00,d9otybh,6.0,t1_d9osxas,1409.0,GunsAreCool

That said, it would be a sad state of affairs if John Lott Jr were to be the ""single most credible statistician about guns and gun violence.""   Consider the following: [Mary Rosh's blog](http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2003/01/21/maryrosh/).

If you believe GVA methodology is flawed, feel free to identify specific incidents that demonstrate such (given that GVA logs hundreds of shooting incidents every single day, they undoubtedly make a mistake periodically).

While I suspect that there are probably many cases where people use guns defensively that don't get reported in the media, I also strongly suspect that there are more incidents were people use guns ""offensively"" that also don't get reported in the media (particularly in cases of domestic violence).  Without actual data, we're both conjecturing.  

Lastly, as per the figures posted in my initial comment above, documented domestic/accidental/suicide shootings occurred **34 times more frequently** than documented successful DGU incidents in October (i.e., 2,142 vs 63 incidents).  I doubt very much that unreported defensive gun use incidents outnumber unreported offensive gun uses by the same factor (if at all).",2016-11-05 21:41:47+00:00,d9nclhy,3.0,t1_d9nbk1b,1581.0,dgu

Also, as per [CDC data (Table 18)](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr65/nvsr65_04.pdf) there were 33,736 motor vehicle accident fatalities versus 33,599 firearm fatalities in 2014 (i.e., the risk of dying in a car accident and the risk of getting shot -- for the U.S. as a whole -- were almost exactly the same).  Moreover, the risks of car accident fatalities are decreasing every year due to responsible actions take by manufacturers to make cars safer.

Lastly, I agree that the data shows that many more people are shot by handguns than by assault rifles (primarily because many more people own handguns than assault rifles). ",2016-11-05 21:04:06+00:00,d9nb4as,3.0,t1_d9naju2,847.0,dgu

Those persons with guns in the home were at greater risk than those without guns in the home of dying from a homicide in the home (adjusted odds ratio = 1.9, 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 3.4).

88,"&gt;VPC's own numbers show DGUs number about 75K a year.

This is what the VPC actually has to say about defensive gun use: **""The use of guns in self-defense by private citizens is extremely rare. VPC research has found a gun is far more likely to be used in a homicide or suicide than in a justifiable homicide. More guns are stolen each year than are used in self-defense.""** [Ref: VPC: Defensive Gun Use](http://www.vpc.org/revealing-the-impacts-of-gun-violence/self-defense-gun-use/).  

A 2013 VPC study found that defensive gun uses occurred an average of **67,740 times per year** between 2007 and 2011, which is where I assumed you got the ""about 75K"" number above. [Ref: VPC: Firearm Justifiable Homicides and Non-Fatal Self-Defense Gun Use](http://www.vpc.org/studies/justifiable.pdf). The study noted that **""Guns are rarely used to kill criminals or stop crimes. In 2010, across the nation there were only 230 justifiable homicides involving a private citizen using a firearm reported to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program as detailed in its Supplementary Homicide Report (SHR). That same year, there were 8,275 criminal gun homicides tallied in the SHR. In 2010, for every justifiable homicide in the United States involving a gun, guns were used in 36 criminal homicides.  And this ratio, of course, does not take into account the thousands of lives ended in gun suicides (19,392) or unintentional shootings (606) that year.""**

If this isn't convincing enough, just compare the small number of DGU's posted on your site to the number of domestic violence, accidental, and child-involved shootings posted on the [GrC site](https://www.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/) (note that most firearm suicides are not reported in the popular press, and are thus not posted on GrC either).  Alternatively, compare the 1,478 DGU incidents reported by the [Gun Violence Archive](http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/) so far this year to the 1,743 reported accidental shootings.  

&gt;Firearm suicides are a mental health issue: You can't impose restrictions on millions of mentally stable Americans because a relative handful have suicidal thoughts.

The issue is whether owning guns for self-defense purposes makes one safer.  Even discounting suicides, the answer is clearly ""no"" [Ref: **Guns in the Home and Risk of a Violent Death in the Home: Findings of a National Study**](http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/160/10/929.full).  Also, note that many firearm suicides are actually domestic murder-suicides; more than 1,080 Americans die in [murder-suicide shootings](http://www.vpc.org/revealing-the-impacts-of-gun-violence/murder-suicide/) each year.

I've personally known three people (all older white males gainfully employed) who took their own lives with guns.  None of them showed any outward signs of mental illness (although one was a functional alcoholic).  

&gt; According to WISQARS, there are about 60K firearm injuries per years, and about 10K deaths.

Your numbers are pretty far off.  According to the CDC, the number of **non-suicide firearm deaths** were **12,897** in 2012, **12,461** in 2013, and **12,265** in 2014 ([Ref: National Vital Statistics Reports - Deaths: Leading Causes](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/nvsr.htm)).  The number of **non-fatal shootings** were **81,396** in 2012, **84,258** in 2013, and **81,024** in 2014 [Ref: WISQARS, Nonfatal Injury Reports, 2001-2014](http://webappa.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/nfirates2001.html).  So clearly, the number of non-firearm deaths (even excluding suicides) and non-fatal firearm injuries are significantly greater than the number of defensive gun uses (which includes defensive gun uses where only property was at risk).

&gt;You trot out the same old weary arguments every time. Really, stop drinking the kool-aid and use your brain: If every law-abiding citizen were to give up his/her firearm, then firearm injury/death rates would rise probably by a fraction of the number of DGUs that there are per year.

My objective is not to have ""every law-abiding citizen ... give up his/her firearm.""  This sounds like typical NRA fear-mongering.  Rather, my objective is to convince the average person that dedicating a large fraction of a month's paycheck to buy a firearm for self-defense is a waste of money, and will in fact increase the probability that someone in your family will get shot.

273,"I actually up-voted this post because it is a superb testament to the inability of many pro-gun advocates to perform simple ""math"":
  
* Accepting the OP’s figures of 32,000 gun deaths per year and a U.S. population of 312 million means that (32,000/312,000,000) x 100 = **0.010256%** (not 0.00010256% -- apparently the OP doesn’t understand percentages) of the U.S. population is shot to death **every year**.
  
* To obtain the average lifetime probability of getting shot to death, one would have to calculate the cumulative probability over a lifetime.  Assuming an average U.S. life expectancy of 78 years, the cumulative probability of getting shot to death is Ptot = 1-(1-Pr)^n = 1 – (1-0.00010256)^78 = 0.00797 (or **0.797%**, which is equivalent to **1 out of every 125** U.S. citizens).
  
* The [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/deaths.htm) has actually determined that **1 out of every 78 deaths** in U.S. was due to gunshot in both 2014 and 2013.  Obviously, if this trend persists, the average percentage of people killed by gunshot in the U.S. will be (1/78) x 100 = **1.28%**.  This value is 12,500 times greater than the value cited in the OP.

* The CDC does not specify the percentages of gunshot deaths that are attributable to gang violence.  According to the [Bureau of Justice Statistics](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf) the leading known cause of homicide in the U.S. between 1980 and 2008 was “argument.”  “Gang homicides” were consistently more than five times less frequent than “argument homicides.”

* The idea that suicides don’t count shouldn’t be any comfort to white males over 40, who commit gun-assisted suicide at much higher rates than any other group (see the CDC link above).

Regarding GVA, you should be aware that [the guy who runs it](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/23/kentucky-gun-owner-gun-violence-archive-mark-bryant) is a gun owner, CCW permit holder and former NRA member.  The assertion that GVA -- or GrC for that matter -- makes the case that there is no such thing as good gun uses is not true.  They're just few and far between, as your sub-Reddit is documenting quite well.

Finally, GVA actually lists 24 incidents involving defensive gun use in August, whereas your DGU sub-reddit lists only 18 (including 2 ""animal DGUs"" and 1 ""Bad Form"" DGU).  Over the same time period, our Mass Shooter Tracker lists 12 incidents in which 4 or more people where shot at one time.  I don't know about you, but the fact that there have been almost as many mass shootings as legit DGUs seems telling.

If I understand correctly, any incident where the shooter *says* he acted so as to protect himself from ""imminent danger"", with no evidence to support the claim, is a legitimate DGU?

Not imminent danger"" (and I believe the most recent bad DGU about this one involved evidence of forced entry--definitely imminent danger). Someone breaking your door down? Imminent danger. Someone in your house? Imminent danger. (But you better take steps to identify your target before deploying your firearm/other defensive weapon.)

It is clear that there was no *imminent danger* in the Abbeville County incident as described here (at least until the teen escalated the situation by drawing *his* gun); the worst case scenario was a thief stealing some stuff out of a shed.

355,"&gt;The vast majority of gun owners never commit any crimes.

* True, legal gun owners probably commit crimes at about the same rate as non gun owners.  However, there are about 112 million legal gun owners in this country.  If even 0.1% of them commit crimes, that's still 112,000 legal gun owners committing crimes. 

&gt; The people that commit crimes with guns get their guns illegally most of the time, and aren't eligible to own guns anyways.

* All ""illegal guns"" were ""legal guns"" at one point.  How do we keep legal guns from becoming illegal guns?

&gt;  In countries where guns are nearly impossible to get people still murder each other. The only difference is the innocent victims can't defend themselves.

I believe you have a right to own a gun for hunting, self-protection, etc., but that this right is not absolute and must be weighed against the rights of others.

My views on guns have undoubtedly been influenced by two friends having taken their own lives with guns, as did another work acquaintance.  So there's that.

I've never owned a gun, but grew up around friends and neighbors who used guns for hunting, etc. I actually used to go target shooting with a friend now and then when I was young.

Do you have any objections to universal background checks?  I realize it's not a perfect end-all solution, but do believe it would save lives.

They reported 1296 DGUs for 2015, as compared to 13,433 gun deaths (excluding suicides) and 27,008 gun injuries.  So, according to their data, there were 31 gun deaths/injuries for every DGU.  If gun suicides are included, this ratio would increase to 46-to-1.  

If you use CDC values for 2013 of 33,636 gun deaths (including suicides) and 84,258 nonfatal injuries (many gun injuries are not reported in the press), the ratio increases to 91-to-1.  Not a very compelling figure in support of guns for self defense.  Granted, not all DGUs are reported in the press either, so the 46-to-1 ratio is probably a reasonable figure. 

It would be interesting to determine the percentage of the reported DGUs that actually prevented personal harm or death (as opposed to chasing burglars away from cars they broke into, etc.).",2016-06-24 17:47:43+00:00,d4midml,5.0,t1_d4mfrkl,3381.0,GunsAreCool

It does not include firearm suicides, accidents, cases of negligence, and firearm deaths from unknown causes (much less cases were people were shot yet survived).

716,"Here are some of the actual conclusions from the 2013 NAP report ""Priorities for Research to Reduce the Threat of Firearm-Related Violence"" report you that cite above:

•	""The U.S. rate of firearm-related deaths is the highest among industrialized countries. In 2010, incidents in the U.S. involving firearms injured or killed more than 105,000 individuals (including 19,000 suicides).""

•	""In the past decade, firearm-related violence has claimed the lives of more than a quarter-million people in the United States. By their sheer magnitude, injuries and deaths involving firearms constitute a pressing public health problem.""

•	""The complexity and frequency of firearm-related violence combined with its impact on the health and safety of the nation’s residents make it a topic of considerable public health importance and suggest that a public health approach should be incorporated into the strategies used to prevent future harm and injuries. public health approach involves three elements: (1) a focus on prevention, (2) a focus on scientific methodology to identify risk and patterns, and (3) multidisciplinary collaboration to address the issue. Public health strategies are designed to interrupt the connection between three essential elements: (1) the “agent” (the source of injury [weapon or perpetrator]), (2) the “host” (the injured person), and (3) the “environment” (the conditions under which the injury occurred). This public health approach has produced successes in reduction of tobacco use, unintentional poisoning, and motor vehicle fatalities.""

•	""The exact number and distribution of guns and gun types in the United States are unknown, but for each of these populations it would be valuable to have counts of total guns owned, their attributes (i.e., general type, caliber, firing mechanism), how the guns were acquired (i.e., purchased, received as a gift, traded for, stolen, etc.), and information on the sources of the guns (i.e., licensed gun dealers, friends or relatives, gun traffickers, owners of stolen guns, and so on).""

•	""At the community level, a range of factors appears to be related to high levels of gun use. These factors include high rates of poverty, illicit drug trafficking, and substance use.""

•	""A number of individual behaviors and susceptibilities are associated with firearm violence and injury. Impulsivity, low educational attainment, substance use, and prior history of aggression and abuse are considered risk factors for violence (for both perpetrators and victims).""

•	""The committee identified the following key research topics as priorities for research on risk and protective factors: Identify factors associated with youth having access to, possessing, and carrying guns.""

•	""Unauthorized gun possession or use is associated with higher rates of firearm violence than legal possession of guns. Controlling access to guns through background checks or restrictions on particular types of firearms remains controversial, and the effectiveness of various types of control is inadequately researched. Research on the impact of imposing additional penalties for firearm use in illegal activities has also produced mixed results. Studies on the impact of right-to-carry laws on firearm violence also have inconsistent results and have been debated for a decade.""

•	""Community-based programs and focused policing interventions in general have been found to be effective in reducing violence in some settings (e.g., high-risk physical locations) and appear to be more effective than prosecutorial policies, including mandatory sentences. Moreover, regulations that limit hours for on-premise alcohol sales in pubs, bars, and nightclubs have been associated with reduced violence.""

•	""There are both active and passive technologies that may have an impact. Passive technologies—for example, technologies that recognize person-specific features such as voice, hand geometry, iris scans, and fingerprints—are those that confer a safety benefit without requiring any specific action by a user. Active technologies require a specific action by a user to enable the technology—for example, to activate a firearm a user has to produce an item that activates the firearm (e.g., tokens, magnetic stripe badges, or proximity cards).""

•	""More than two-thirds of victims murdered by a spouse or ex-spouse died as a result of a gun-shot wound"" (between 2007 and 2011).

•	""More than 600,000 victims of robbery and other crimes reported that they faced an assailant armed with a gun"" (between 2007 and 2011).

•	""Even when defensive use of guns is effective in averting death or injury for the gun user in cases of crime, it is still possible that keeping a gun in the home or carrying a gun in public—concealed or open carry— may have a different net effect on the rate of injury. For example, if gun ownership raises the risk of suicide, homicide, or the use of weapons by those who invade the homes of gun owners, this could cancel or outweigh the beneficial effects of defensive gun use. Although some early studies were published that relate to this issue, they were not conclusive, and this is a sufficiently important question that it merits additional, careful exploration.""

•	""Violence, including firearm-related violence, has been shown to be contagious. Recognizing this, the academic community has suggested that research examine violence much like is done for contagious diseases.""

•	""Motor vehicle–related injury reduction provides a useful analogy for using a public health approach to a problem that also has criminal justice considerations. For example, in both motor vehicle and gun use, there is a need to balance health and safety with the practical reality of a potentially dangerous tool that is embedded in U.S. society.""

•	""The scarcity of research on firearm-related violence limits policy makers’ ability to propose evidence-based policies that reduce injuries and deaths and maximize safety while recognizing Second Amendment rights.""

•	""Since the 1960s, a number of state and federal laws and regulations have been enacted that restrict government’s ability to collect and share information about gun sales, ownership, and possession, which has limited data collection and collation relevant to firearm violence prevention research. Among these are the amendments to the Gun Control Act of 1968, which prohibits the federal government from establishing an electronic database of the names of gun purchasers and requires gun dealers to conduct annual inventories of their firearms. In addition to the restrictions on certain kinds of data collection, congressional action in 1996 effectively halted all firearm-related injury research at the CDC by prohibiting the use of federal funding “to advocate or promote gun control. In 2011, Congress enacted similar restrictions affecting the entire U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The net result was an overall reduction in firearm violence research. As a result, the past 20 years have witnessed diminished progress in understanding the causes and effects of firearm violence.""

•	""Basic information about gun possession, acquisition, and storage is lacking. No single database captures the total number, locations, and types of firearms and firearm owners in the United States. Data about the sources of guns used in crimes are important because the means of acquisition may reveal opportunities for prevention of firearm-related violence.""

•	""Fatal and nonfatal firearm violence poses a serious threat to the safety and welfare of the American public.""

•	""The U.S. rate of firearm-related homicide is higher than that of any other industrialized country: 19.5 times higher than the rates in other high-income countries.""

•	""A recent estimate suggested that firearm violence cost the United States more than $174 billion in 2010 (Miller, 2010). However, it is essentially impossible to quantify the overall physiological, mental, emotional, social, and collateral economic effects of firearm violence, because these effects extend well beyond the victim to the surrounding community and society at large.""

952,"I meant to say that it's hard to accept that the NRA does *not* blanketly oppose expanding background checks.  If this is incorrect, the NRA needs to fire their PR/webpage firm, as there is absolutely nothing on the NRA's [Background Checks/NICS webpage](https://www.nraila.org/issues/background-checksnics/) to suggest otherwise.

The mental health legislation you cite was signed into law in 2008, so is irrelevant in terms of whether or not the NRA supports expanding background checks today.  I know that the NRA support's Senator Cornyn's recent [Mental Health bill](http://mediamatters.org/research/2015/08/07/what-the-media-should-know-about-gop-sen-john-c/204831); however, this bill is [criticized by many](http://mediamatters.org/research/2015/08/07/what-the-media-should-know-about-gop-sen-john-c/204831) as a means to actually make it *easier* for individuals with serious mental health issues to obtain guns. 

The larger issue is the so-called [""background check loophole""](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/jan/07/politifact-sheet-3-things-know-about-gun-show-loop/) that allows private sellers to avoid NICS background checks.  Most people in this country support eliminating this ""loophole,"" the NRA does not.  Simply because some criminals will evade a universal background system is no justification for not implementing one, just as the fact that some people drive drunk is no reason for eliminating laws against drunk driving. 

Regarding the knife argument, when was the last time you heard of a ""mass stabbing""?  Mass shootings, on the other hand, occur daily.

Finally, I do support gun registration.  I do not believe it will not result in gun confiscation, any more than car registration results in confiscation.  However, it would allow police and the ATF to better track where criminals obtain guns and ultimately stem the tide flowing into the hands criminals.  

As I said, my views are evolving, and I appreciate a nuanced discussion (instead of the usual hurling of epithets).  I'm not familiar with the ""case of NYC"" that you allude to above and would appreciate it if you could provide a reference.  ",2016-03-28 01:02:33+00:00,d1ftr75,15.0,t1_d1fqsza,5102.0,CCW

It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court’s opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.

I also reject the NRA's narrative that guns make us safer, as do essentially all academic researchers who study gun violence and publish in peer-reviewed journals.

The article your cited above cites a [Pew Research Center poll](http://www.people-press.org/2013/04/24/mixed-reactions-to-senate-gun-vote/), which concluded:
&gt;The key Senate vote that halted gun control legislation last week is drawing a mixed reaction from the American public: 47% express negative feelings about the vote while 39% have a positive reaction to the Senate’s rejection of gun control legislation that included background checks on gun purchases. Overall, 15% say they are angry this legislation was voted down and 32% say they are disappointed. On the other side, 20% say are very happy the legislation was blocked, while 19% say they are relieved.

In other words, 47% of those polled were ""angry or disappointed"" that the gun control legislation was not passed by Congress, while 39% were ""very happy"" or ""relieved"" that the legislation was not passed.  Clearly, Congress as a whole did not vote according the the view of the majority.

This is what I found in the article you cite above:

&gt;But Sen. Christopher Murphy, Connecticut Democrat, said gun owners and NRA members generally agree that strengthening background checks is a good idea. Several polls conducted this year — from Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, Quinnipiac University and Pew — all found that at least 84 percent of gun owners (or in Quinnipiac’s case, “households with a gun”) support universal background checks. “The NRA and its lobby — especially when it comes to the debate we’re having right now in Washington — is badly out of step with the people that the NRA claims to represent,” Mr. Murphy said on a conference call Monday.

&gt;But Mr. Murphy, who was the congressman representing Newtown and senator-elect when the shootings occurred, pointed to congressional testimony from Mr. LaPierre in 1999 expressing his support for universal background checks, with **“no loopholes anywhere for anyone.”**

So the article you cite above actually says nothing about NRA rank-and-file members opposing background checks, and even points out  that Wayne LaPierre himself supported universal background checks in the past.",2016-03-20 22:26:26+00:00,d176idy,11.0,t1_d1757ts,2147.0,shitguncontrollerssay

&gt;At the time, 81% favored expanded background checks, while **73% wanted the background checks bill to pass.** Among Republicans – especially Tea Party Republicans – support for background-check legislation was much lower than for the overall proposal: 63% of Tea Party Republicans and leaners supported expanded background checks but just 28% wanted the background-check bill to pass.

So 73% of those polled wanted the background checks bill to pass.  Only extremist Tea Party members (and in fact only 72% of them) were actually opposed to the legislation. ",2016-03-20 21:35:02+00:00,d174ns0,7.0,t1_d174bh2,570.0,shitguncontrollerssay

1115,"Exactly.  You won't find a firearm ad that outright states that owning a gun will make you safer because it is simply not true, and the gun industry knows it.  However, the ad links you post above clearly *imply* that a gun will make you safer, which if stated explicitly would be a blatant lie and grounds for a lawsuit.

Also, I understand why you might be opposed to mandatory insurance -- why not have the general public pay the social costs of your deadly hobby?  Financial aid for purchasing gun safes and training?  You can do better than that.  Why not impose a universal tax so we can buy everybody a gun?  Hell, why not universal welfare for gun owners while you're at it?",2016-02-26 23:57:39+00:00,d0f8hoh,4.0,t1_d0eqb7j,25932.0,GunsAreCool
1116,"Unlike the gun industry, the auto industry does not market their product with the lie that it will make the buyer safer.  In addition, the auto industry has acknowledged the inherent risks associated with motor vehicles and, moreover, has taken successful steps to reduce these risks.  In sharp contrast, the gun industry realizes that every shooting death increases demand for their product, and consequently actively obstructs all efforts to make guns safer.  

Finally, we are required to have a driver's license and liability insurance to operate a motor vehicle, and consequently the social costs of motor vehicle accidents are borne by those who enjoy the benefits of driving.  In contrast, gun owners are neither required to have a license nor to purchase liability insurance, and consequently the costs of gun violence are borne entirely by the general public -- this is effectively welfare for the gun industry.",2016-02-26 14:36:00+00:00,d0el3fz,2.0,t1_d0ednf3,23034.0,GunsAreCool

1417,"Ignoring suicides (for whatever arbitrary reason), the actual ANNUAL probability of getting shot to death in the U.S. is about 0.0037% (using CDC data). This corresponds to a LIFETIME probability of 0.29% (or 1 out of every 343 people).

If firearm suicides are included, the lifetime probability of getting shot to death increases to about 0.80% (or 1 out of every 125 people).

If you use the CDC firearm fatality data for 2013 (~12,000 firearm deaths, including accidents and undetermined intent, but excluding suicides and legal intervention) and the current U.S. population (318.9 million), you get 0.00376% of getting killed  by a gun EVERY YEAR.

According to the CDC, in 2013 firearms caused 79,084 nonfatal injuries (excluding self-harm and legal intervention) and 11,994 deaths (excluding suicide and legal intervention).  Thus, the total number of people shot in 2013 was 91,078 (excluding suicide, legal intervention, and self harm).

Multiply 91,078 shootings by an average U.S. life-span of 78.74 years and you get 7.17 million people shot.

There are currently 318.9 million U.S. citizens.  Divide the current population (321 million) by 7.17 million people shot and you get roughly 1 out of 45.  If you include firearm suicides and self-harm, the probability increases to 1 out of 35.

The math is pretty simple.  Obviously, if the per capita probability of getting shot decreases (let's hope), this number decreases as well.

•	""The U.S. rate of firearm-related deaths is the highest among industrialized countries. In 2010, incidents in the U.S. involving firearms injured or killed more than 105,000 individuals (including 19,000 suicides).""

•	""In the past decade, firearm-related violence has claimed the lives of more than a quarter-million people in the United States. By their sheer magnitude, injuries and deaths involving firearms constitute a pressing public health problem.""

•	""The complexity and frequency of firearm-related violence combined with its impact on the health and safety of the nation’s residents make it a topic of considerable public health importance and suggest that a public health approach should be incorporated into the strategies used to prevent future harm and injuries. public health approach involves three elements: (1) a focus on prevention, (2) a focus on scientific methodology to identify risk and patterns, and (3) multidisciplinary collaboration to address the issue. Public health strategies are designed to interrupt the connection between three essential elements: (1) the “agent” (the source of injury [weapon or perpetrator]), (2) the “host” (the injured person), and (3) the “environment” (the conditions under which the injury occurred). This public health approach has produced successes in reduction of tobacco use, unintentional poisoning, and motor vehicle fatalities.""

•	""The exact number and distribution of guns and gun types in the United States are unknown, but for each of these populations it would be valuable to have counts of total guns owned, their attributes (i.e., general type, caliber, firing mechanism), how the guns were acquired (i.e., purchased, received as a gift, traded for, stolen, etc.), and information on the sources of the guns (i.e., licensed gun dealers, friends or relatives, gun traffickers, owners of stolen guns, and so on).""

•	""At the community level, a range of factors appears to be related to high levels of gun use. These factors include high rates of poverty, illicit drug trafficking, and substance use.""

•	""A number of individual behaviors and susceptibilities are associated with firearm violence and injury. Impulsivity, low educational attainment, substance use, and prior history of aggression and abuse are considered risk factors for violence (for both perpetrators and victims).""
•	""The committee identified the following key research topics as priorities for research on risk and protective factors: Identify factors associated with youth having access to, possessing, and carrying guns.""

•	""Unauthorized gun possession or use is associated with higher rates of firearm violence than legal possession of guns. Controlling access to guns through background checks or restrictions on particular types of firearms remains controversial, and the effectiveness of various types of control is inadequately researched. Research on the impact of imposing additional penalties for firearm use in illegal activities has also produced mixed results. Studies on the impact of right-to-carry laws on firearm violence also have inconsistent results and have been debated for a decade.""

•	""Community-based programs and focused policing interventions in general have been found to be effective in reducing violence in some settings (e.g., high-risk physical locations) and appear to be more effective than prosecutorial policies, including mandatory sentences. Moreover, regulations that limit hours for on-premise alcohol sales in pubs, bars, and nightclubs have been associated with reduced violence.""

•	""There are both active and passive technologies that may have an impact. Passive technologies—for example, technologies that recognize person-specific features such as voice, hand geometry, iris scans, and fingerprints—are those that confer a safety benefit without requiring any specific action by a user. Active technologies require a specific action by a user to enable the technology—for example, to activate a firearm a user has to produce an item that activates the firearm (e.g., tokens, magnetic stripe badges, or proximity cards).""

•	""More than two-thirds of victims murdered by a spouse or ex-spouse died as a result of a gun-shot wound"" (between 2007 and 2011).

•	""More than 600,000 victims of robbery and other crimes reported that they faced an assailant armed with a gun"" (between 2007 and 2011).

•	""Even when defensive use of guns is effective in averting death or injury for the gun user in cases of crime, it is still possible that keeping a gun in the home or carrying a gun in public—concealed or open carry— may have a different net effect on the rate of injury. For example, if gun ownership raises the risk of suicide, homicide, or the use of weapons by those who invade the homes of gun owners, this could cancel or outweigh the beneficial effects of defensive gun use. Although some early studies were published that relate to this issue, they were not conclusive, and this is a sufficiently important question that it merits additional, careful exploration.""

•	""Violence, including firearm-related violence, has been shown to be contagious. Recognizing this, the academic community has suggested that research examine violence much like is done for contagious diseases.""

•	""Motor vehicle–related injury reduction provides a useful analogy for using a public health approach to a problem that also has criminal justice considerations. For example, in both motor vehicle and gun use, there is a need to balance health and safety with the practical reality of a potentially dangerous tool that is embedded in U.S. society.""

•	""The scarcity of research on firearm-related violence limits policy makers’ ability to propose evidence-based policies that reduce injuries and deaths and maximize safety while recognizing Second Amendment rights.""

•	""Since the 1960s, a number of state and federal laws and regulations have been enacted that restrict government’s ability to collect and share information about gun sales, ownership, and possession, which has limited data collection and collation relevant to firearm violence prevention research. Among these are the amendments to the Gun Control Act of 1968, which prohibits the federal government from establishing an electronic database of the names of gun purchasers and requires gun dealers to conduct annual inventories of their firearms. In addition to the restrictions on certain kinds of data collection, congressional action in 1996 effectively halted all firearm-related injury research at the CDC by prohibiting the use of federal funding “to advocate or promote gun control. In 2011, Congress enacted similar restrictions affecting the entire U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The net result was an overall reduction in firearm violence research. As a result, the past 20 years have witnessed diminished progress in understanding the causes and effects of firearm violence.""

•	""Basic information about gun possession, acquisition, and storage is lacking. No single database captures the total number, locations, and types of firearms and firearm owners in the United States. Data about the sources of guns used in crimes are important because the means of acquisition may reveal opportunities for prevention of firearm-related violence.""

•	""Fatal and nonfatal firearm violence poses a serious threat to the safety and welfare of the American public.""

•	""The U.S. rate of firearm-related homicide is higher than that of any other industrialized country: 19.5 times higher than the rates in other high-income countries.""

•	""A recent estimate suggested that firearm violence cost the United States more than $174 billion in 2010 (Miller, 2010). However, it is essentially impossible to quantify the overall physiological, mental, emotional, social, and collateral economic effects of firearm violence, because these effects extend well beyond the victim to the surrounding community and society at large.""
