* There were [**89 documented domestic shootings in which at least one person was injured**](http://archive.is/7OXpC), 1 of these cases involved a child (&lt; 12 yrs) injured;

* There were approximately **1,778 suicide shootings in October** (based on 21,334 suicide shootings reported by the [CDC for 2014](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr65/nvsr65_04.pdf)).

* There were approximately **25,000 to 50,000 cases in October in which guns were stolen from private owners, more than enough to provide a weapon for every instance of gun violence in the country** [(based on the results of a recent national survey)](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/21/gun-theft-us-firearm-survey). 

* [**American taxpayers paid roughly $19 billion to cover the costs of gun-related deaths and injuries in October**](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/04/true-cost-of-gun-violence-in-america).

* There were [**63 documented DGU incidents in October in which the victim stopped a crime**](http://archive.is/SeSjs), including incidents where no shots were fired (there were also [**5 documented “bad DGUs""**](http://archive.is/x8GO7), which didn't include these [**7 shining examples of defensive gun use**](http://archive.is/8VOqg)).

**These figures above indicate that, in October, gun owners were ~31 times more likely to shoot themselves, a family member, an intimate partner or an innocent bystander than to successfully stop a crime with a gun.  Gun owners were also 400-800 times more likely to have a gun stolen by criminals than to successfully stop a crime with a gun.**

* **42 verified mass shootings**
* **208 total casualties (killed &amp; wounded)**

These people were victims strictly of mass shootings (when four or more people were shot in an event, or related series of events without a cooling off period). Not included are victims of shootings where three or fewer people were shot. On average, [**91 Americans are killed and more than 200 injured with guns every day**](https://everytownresearch.org/gun-violence-by-the-numbers/). In the U.S. in 2014 – the last year for which data is available – [**1 of every 78 deaths was caused by gunshot**](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/deaths.htm).

**Bonus Fun Facts**

* So far, there has been an average of **1.32 mass shootings per day** in 2016, as compared to 1.02 in 2015, 0.89 in 2014, and 0.93 in 2013.


* The **top ten states for mass shootings** so far in 2016 (# per million people) are: **Alabama** (3.31), **Louisiana** (2.59), **Illinois** (2.41), **Mississippi** (2.34), **Georgia** (2.00), **Tennessee** (2.00), **New Mexico** (1.92), **Missouri** (1.82), **Kansas** (1.73), and **Maryland** (1.52) (for states with &gt; 2 mass shootings).


* The **top ten Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) for mass shootings** so far in 2016 (# per million people) are: **Fort Wayne, IN** (6.98), **Birmingham, AL** (4.36), **Cape Coral-Fort Myers, FL** (4.27), **Baton Rouge, LA** (3.61), **Albuquerque, NM** (3.31), **New Orleans, LA** (3.17), **Fresno, CA** (3.08), **Memphis, TN** (2.98), **Chicago, IL** (2.93), and **Jacksonville, FL** (2.76) (for MSAs with                      &gt; 2 mass shootings).


* **Mass shootings involving domestic violence** occurred in [**Fort Wayne, IN**](http://wane.com/2016/09/11/three-dead-another-critically-injured-in-shooting/), [**Minneapolis, MN**](http://www.argusleader.com/story/news/crime/2016/09/30/minneapolis-police-investigate-after-3-killed-1-hurt/91318680/), and [**Fort Worth, TX**](http://www.newswest9.com/story/33116163/two-texas-officers-shot-responding-to-911-call-suspect-reportedly-dead).

* **59 verified mass shootings**
* **309 total casualties**


These people were victims strictly of [**mass shootings**](http://www.massshootingtracker.org/about#massshooting). The casualties listed above exclude the thousands of victims – every month – of shootings in which fewer than four people were shot. On average, [**91 Americans are killed and more than 200 injured with guns every day**](https://everytownresearch.org/gun-violence-by-the-numbers/). In the U.S. in 2014 -- the last year for which data are available -- [**1 of every 78 deaths was caused by gunshot**](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/deaths.htm).


**Mass shootings with 15 and 20 casualties** occurred in [**Bakersfield, CA**](http://www.ksby.com/story/32557429/bakersfield-shooting-that-wounded-14-claims-innocent-victim) and [**Fort Myers, FL**](http://www.nbc-2.com/story/32519233/2-dead-at-least-16-injured-in-shooting-at-fort-myers-club), respectively. Other notable shootings in July included those in [**Minneapolis and Baton Rouge**](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/08/us/philando-castile-falcon-heights-shooting.html?_r=0) where two young men, carrying guns for protection, were shot and killed by police.  These two events led to reactionary mass shootings motivated by [**“anti-tyranny” ideology**](http://www.armedwithreason.com/militia-myths-why-armed-populations-dont-prevent-tyranny-but-often-lead-to-it/) in [**Dallas and Baton Rouge**](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/09/us/dallas-attacks-what-we-know-baton-rouge-minnesota.html). Who gains when citizens are fearful of armed cops and cops are fearful of armed citizens?  The [**gun lobby**](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-07-08/gun-stocks-reach-record-highs-after-dallas-police-shooting); the rest of us pay, some with our lives.  


Guns, presumably obtained for self-protection, were used in **domestic violence mass shootings** in [**Miami, FL**](http://www.local10.com/news/mother-2-teens-killed-in-quadruple-shooting), [**Mukilteo, WA**](http://komonews.com/news/local/3-dead-1-wounded-in-shooting-during-party-in-mukilteo), [**Bastrop, TX**](http://www.star-telegram.com/news/state/texas/article92305362.html), [**St. Louis, MO**](http://www.kmov.com/story/32441632/2-dead-1-wounded-in-south-st-louis-shooting-officer-shot-by-suspect), and [**Cleveland, OH**](http://www.wkyc.com/news/local/cleveland/gunfire-rings-out-2-children-1-adult-shot-in-cleveland/264489421). Again, these were only the *mass shootings* involving domestic violence.  In the U.S., on average, [**51 women are shot to death by intimate partners every month**](https://everytownresearch.org/gun-violence-by-the-numbers/#DomesticViolence). 



**Bonus Fun Facts**

* July, 2016 was just the just second time (since the Mass Shooting Tracker was started in 2013) when there were [**more than 300 total mass shooting casualties in one month**](http://www.massshootingtracker.org/data).  The first time was in June, 2016.

* America celebrated freedom on **July 4th** with [**7 mass shootings**](http://www.massshootingtracker.org/data).

* So far, there has been an average of **1.31 mass shootings per day** in the U.S. in 2016, as compared to 1.02 in 2015, 0.89 in 2014, and 0.93 in 2013.

* The **top ten states for mass shootings** so far in 2016 (# per million people per year) are: **Alabama** (4.24), **Louisiana** (4.06), **Illinois** (3.19), **Georgia** (3.06), **Kansas** (2.95), **Tennessee** (2.88), **Mississippi** (2.86), **New Mexico** (2.47), **Nevada** (2.42) and **New York** (2.04) (for states with &gt; 2 mass shootings).

* The **top ten cities for mass shootings** so far in 2016 (# per million people per year) are: **Orlando** (28.2), **Atlanta** (24.1), **St. Louis** (22.7), **Baton Rouge** (22.4), **Fort Myers/Cape Coral** (22.0), **Oakland** (16.9), **Miami** (16.4), **Chicago** (14.5), **Baltimore** (13.8), and **New Orleans** (12.5) (for cities with &gt; 2 mass shootings).

* **52 verified mass shootings**
* **104 people killed**
* **226 people wounded**

These people were victims strictly of [mass shootings](http://massshootingtracker.org/about#massshooting). Not included are victims of shootings where three or fewer people were shot. On average, [**91 Americans are killed and more than 200 injured with guns every day**](https://everytownresearch.org/gun-violence-by-the-numbers/). In 2014 -- the last year for which CDC data is available -- [**1 of every 78 deaths in the U.S. was caused by gunshot**](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/deaths.htm).



**Bonus Fun Facts**

* Even *without Orlando*, more people were killed in mass shootings in June, 2016 than in any month in the preceding three years (i.e., since the [Mass Shooting Tracker](http://www.massshootingtracker.org/) was initiated in 2013).

* So far, there has been an average of **1.26 mass shootings per day** in the U.S. in 2016, as compared to 1.02 in 2015, 0.89 in 2014, and 0.93 in 2013.

* The **top ten states for mass shootings** so far in 2016 (# per million people) are: **Alabama** (2.14), **Kansas** (2.06), **Illinois** (1.72), **Louisiana** (1.55), **New Mexico** (1.51), **Nevada** (1.41), **Mississippi** (1.34), **Georgia** (1.29), **Virginia** (1.08), and **Tennessee** (1.07) (for states with &gt; 2 mass shootings).

[""Let's break down official numbers""](https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13450279_10154120613916550_7149342727954032569_n.jpg?oh=342fd8a48c800f57ba2ce33145e8e43a&amp;oe=57C772EB)

He divides ~32,000 gun-related deaths per year by the U.S. population of ~312 million and claims that the resulting value of 0.01026% is the ""chance of death by a gun.""  What he fails to understand is that this is the ANNUAL probability of being killed by gunshot.  If you calculate the cumulative **LIFE-TIME probability of being killed by gunshot in the U.S.** it comes to about **1.23% (or ~1 of 80 people).**  

For those who don't trust statistics, consider this approach.  Divide the ~32,000 gun-related deaths in the U.S. last year by the total number of deaths, which was ~2.59 million.  The result clearly indicates that ~1.23% of all U.S. deaths last year were caused by gun shot (again, ~1 of 80 deaths).  For most people, this is a sobering number, especially when you consider that only 1 out every ~3.5 people who are shot actually dies from it, and that many people who do survive are permanently debilitated.

* 18 verified mass shootings 
* 31 people killed 
* 51 people wounded


By comparison, there were 18 verified mass shootings in December, 2015, resulting in 31 people killed and 95 people wounded.  There were 371 mass shootings in 2015, averaging 1.02 per day.


Again, these people were victims strictly of mass shootings (when four or more people are shot in an event, or related series of events without a cooling off period). Not included are victims of shootings where three or fewer people were shot.  


There were two incidents in January, 2016, that may have been mass shootings, but involved separate shootings that were not confirmed as related:

* [""Seven injured in three shootings in S.W. Oklahoma City""](http://kfor.com/2016/01/31/five-injured-in-two-shootings-in-s-w-oklahoma-city/).
* [""Four people shot in less than 24 hours""](http://news3lv.com/news/local/three-wounded-in-north-las-vegas-shooting).

**Bonus fun facts**

* Virginia wins first prize for 3 mass shootings in January, with 8 people killed and 5 wounded.
* Florida and Illinois tied for second prize in January with 2 mass shootings each.
* Mass shooting of the month: [""6 Family Members Dead in Apparent Murder-Suicide""] (http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/national-international/6-Family-Members-Dead-in-Apparent-Murder-Suicide-366831601.html).

In addition, in 2013 gun owners caused 84,258 nonfatal injuries, including permanent maiming and life-long disability.  Extrapolating over a typical 74-year lifetime, this means -- if current rates persist -- 1 out of every 37 people in the U.S. today will be killed or injured by a gun owner (again, excluding ""legal intervention"").  

The Gun Industry/NRA's solution?  Ban funding for gun violence research.
