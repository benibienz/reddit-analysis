41,"&gt; Government passed a law which raised prices. How did this confuse you?

no actually the assault weapons ban was a ban on manufacturing, it was not a tax

i can see youre confused by the economics behind this, thats ok it can be complex to understand this stuff but i would encourage you to stick it out in economics 101, econ can explain well how pricing generally works in a market. in this case, its a matter of perception, scarcity, and supply and demand

this graph should help you understand

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Fig5_Supply_and_demand_curves.jpg

in terms of the awb, demand largely stayed the same but *perceived* supply was reduced given the *assumption of future scarcity* (fwiw there was no real scarcity at any time, everything was just as easy to get as it is today), so like a market often does with individuals sensing a business opportunity, some sellers took advantage of that *perception* and charged more for existing items as a result. in practice it meant something like a 15 round magazine for your average 9mm maybe went from $8 to $10. this was the 90's before you were born or maybe you were swimming around above the uterus at the time, but thats like going from $12 to $15 today, not much of a difference. youd usually find the same pre ban prices at gun shows, it was the established gun stores with more overhead that tended to up prices and ham up the scarcity thing to move product.

you may find it interesting to know that the sks also got very popular during that time since it didnt have the aw appearance without being kitted out, and the manufacturer supply shot up so prices came down on those considerably, you could buy a cherry sks for about $150 or less. slight modifications and kit and youd get your aw appearance if you wanted that look for whatever reason

two helpful articles on understanding the economic concepts behind this

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity

you may find it worthwhile to read about the assault weapon ban itself, it was a ban on further manufacturing of a particular type of weapon appearance and capacity magazine, it was not a tax, and it had no impact on existing weapons or magazines

&gt; In what world does using government services that I've already paid for qualifies as mooching?

oh really? youve paid for all of your usage of government services?  so you dont use any of the above services other than driving a single mile of interstate highway and you have already paid over $7 million in taxes alone? because it costs about $7 million per mile of highway built, and given that someone with a bachelors degree has lifetime earnings of about $2.5 million that would be pretty hard to achieve. and that gives you the assumption of being an educated person, someone with a high school diploma only earns about $1.5 million over a lifetime.

that applies almost universally to every single health care service, whether its drawing blood, casting a broken limb, gallbladder surgery, pharmaceuticals, etc

perhaps you'll find japan to be interesting, since they are not big scary socialists. but you better believe they negotiate set reasonable prices on everything, something the usa largely does not do

&gt;  Fees for all health care services are set every two years by negotiations between the health ministry and physicians. The negotiations determine the fee for every medical procedure and medication, and fees are identical across the country. If physicians attempt to game the system by ordering more procedures to generate income, the government may lower the fees for those procedures at the next round of fee setting.[9] This was the case when the fee for an MRI was lowered by 35% in 2002 by the government.[9] Thus, as of 2009, in the U.S. an MRI of the neck region could cost $1,500, but in Japan it cost US$98.

no, youre missing the point. a highly educated society does benefit you. we have a low educated society and we see the results. the average us citizen isnt particularly educated and they earn shit, low skill means low wages, which means they have to make up the difference from government subsidies and programs. and going further, due to low educational attainment, they routinely vote against self interest and perhaps worse, low information voters routinely vote against broad interest of their country, worsening not only their own plight but that of fellow citizens and future citizens, and they seemingly have no ability to better themselves or contribute in a meaningful way. its not hard to see why a dumbed down population is broke and burdensome, let alone detrimental. 

&gt; I also paid the federal government roughly $85,000 in taxes last year,

85k/year to fed puts you with an earned income of about $300,000 a year? or are you including fica with that number? 

even if your income actually was that high, which is doubtful given some of your other statements, you still get tax credits for having a kid, mortgage, etc, every deduction, every line item, every credit, youre mooching subsidies from the government that dont benefit me or anyone else

here's what happened in australia: it got slightly harder for the casually insane idiot to buy any gun imaginable, and so gun ownership mostly concentrated to sportsmen, enthusiasts, hunters, farmers, etc

in fact, it is really easy to buy a gun in australia today, but you have to fit some excruciatingly low level basic criteria:

- 18 years or over

- Judged as a fit and proper person 

- Have undergone a firearms safety training course and;

- Have provided documentation about the storage arrangements in which they will secure the firearm.

and in *some parts of australia*, you need to demonstrate ""a genuine reason to have a firearms licence"", like, hunter, marksman, sportsman, work in particularly dangerous field, etc

thats why there is a qualification process, its federal assistance! 

you are paying below market rate on a mortgage, 0%, through a government subsidy program. market rate is around 4% on a 30yr. who do you think pays that difference? not you, thats why you got the subsidy. you are receiving a government subsidy from taxpayers. other federal tax payers are paying for your 0% mortgage rate.

&gt; Aluminum is one of the most destructive mining products in the world. Although aluminum only occurs in aluminum ore (bauxite) in densities of 3 – 5% (meaning that for every ton of aluminum metal produced, 20 to 30 tons of ore are mined and dumped) and mining wastes make up the largest waste stream in the world, the reason aluminum is so destructive has little to do with the actual mine. 

&gt; Because the melting point of aluminum is so high, in order to extract the aluminum from the ore and process it into sheets or ingots, it takes massive amounts of energy.

one idea, this is not advice, blah blah, is owning a diversified portfolio of individual bonds as a way to achieve yield with little risk. not a bond fund, not a bond etf, but actual individual bonds with a set maturity date, the old fashioned way.  there will be no fluctuation in value if its held to maturity, principal will be returned and the coupon is paid on schedule.  the risks are same as other bonds, mainly default risk, and the potential for missing out on higher yields if rates go up. munis are tax favorable which helps boost real yield, but again you'll need to hold a basket to diversify

&gt;  She is very concerned about losing any of the 401k money.

another option is to split the 500k into a CD ladder that will pay somewhere around a whopping 1% to 2.2%, but no price fluctuation, safe, and fdic insured

lets look at some assets of the usa, lets keep it simple, like recoverable energy resources since those have global market value

&gt; IER **estimated the worth of the government’s oil and gas technically recoverable resources to the economy to be $128 trillion, about 8 times our national debt**. 

http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/analysis/federal-assets-above-and-below-ground/

that is $128,000,000,000,000 in oil sitting in the ground on us soil. thats just oil value, ignoring land value, ignoring all future claims (taxes), ignoring all other assets

this may help you understand things further, if you are concerned about the debt and the political bullshit talking points:

&gt; The USA has an institutional arrangement in which it is a contingent currency issuer. That is, while the Treasury is an operational currency user (meaning it must always have funds in its account at the Fed before it can spend those funds) it has the extraordinary power to tax and issue risk free bonds that the public will always desire to hold so long as inflation is not extraordinarily high. Additionally, in a worst case scenario, the US Treasury can always rely on the Federal Reserve to supply the funds necessary to fund its spending.  Imagine having your own bank that would always lend to you. This makes the government quite different from a household. The key here is that there’s no solvency constraint as in, “running out of money”.

that is ridiculous and totally wrong, telling someone that is probably why theyre 212 pounds at 5'9 and still gaining weight. 

if youre overweight your insulin response is already fucked which means chowing down on thousands of calories of garbage food immediately turns to more fat. the body is overfed and immediately stores the excess energy as fat, it does not burn it. this is why fat people tend to get even fatter, and overweight people tend to gain more weight over time. the only way out of that cycle is a dramatic change of diet with an increase in activity.

spend a few months with a legitimate personal trainer and nutritionist, not the free guy/gal at the gym who is out of shape themselves, pay for one who works with people who use their bodies for a living. your diet will become lean protein and large servings of vegetables, thats it, and if you measured calorie wise you will be eating probably 1/2 to 1/4 of what most do now, and guess what happens? they become healthier,  they lose tons of fat, they get ripped, and they have way more energy. no, they dont starve to death. but the second they change diet back to junk average americana, the weight comes back.

you may not like the tea party, but the tea party is evidence of that working. sure the tea party is a manufactured group, but ultimately the collection of pissed off voters threw out anyone who wanted to govern, theyd rather stick a bunch of anti-governing fools into power to grind the machine to a halt. and hey what do you know, it has worked, we have a totally useless congress that refuses to govern at all.

another organized group that is incredibly effective at lobbying for their members is the nra. they are incredibly efficient at pressuring elected officials to vote for their interests, and the evidence that it works is all around us. a great documentary about the nra and their political power is here, whether you like the nra or not you absolutely have to appreciate their incredible political prowess, which is driven from the bottom up

I tried to listen carefully and accept thoughtful criticisms. **But it seemed to me that the crisis had helped to radicalize large parts of the Republican Party**,” Bernanke writes on page 432.

&gt; We have low real growth in developed economies due to either demographic forces or households deleveraging (thus reducing aggregate demand) and we have little to no inflation. This is why long term rates are low

agree completely, there is very little demand in the consumer economy. but there is significant inflation in housing and risk assets, housing cost is particularly important for household formation which creates sustainable demand. i suspect this will continue to be the case until either the new bubble pops, or the boomer demographic start unloading their real estate which is likely a decade+ out

&gt; where is the fucking case for raising rates?

we have 5.4% unemployment, the us economy is one of the better in the industrialized world despite muddling along, risk assets are far beyond their pre recession values. so fed mission accomplished? right? so get out of the way and let the market reprice assets accordingly

to buy that 1m house in LA, you'd need 200k cash for a down payment alone and then your mortgage payments are 5k/mo, 1k/mo to taxes, $500/mo insurance, utilities another $500/mo+
