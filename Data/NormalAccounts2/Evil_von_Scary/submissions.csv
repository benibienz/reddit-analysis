I also already have a mouse and headset as I've been using a laptop for a few years. I've never done a build before and don't have a ton of knowledge, could you guys check out the builds and give your advice? I just don't know which to go with.

And that's it. The purpose of the build is gaming, I will primarily be playing Team Fortress 2 but I will also play newer games like Overwatch and would like to have solid fps at high settings. So will this build accomplish that? Are there parts I'm missing and need to get? Will these parts cooperate together?I'm also open to suggestions on changing brands or models. Also, I found this on Tom's Hardware, should I just get this build by someone else? http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-pc-builds,4390.html
