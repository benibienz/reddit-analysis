1324,"“Critics who treat 'adult' as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.”

Either way I can think of a few things, for 1 this sub was a big part of this harassing Keystone Motel thing if I remember correctly. At least until the crewniverse said to stop in which case they did then blamed tumblr for it all. As well as that the sub is generally REALLY reactionary so whenever the SWJ's or whatever on tumblr do something awful some of them think the solution is to do equally awful things to said SWJ's perpetuating the cycle of hate.

And yet the sub still maintains this insufferable attitude of always being the superior part of the fandom, better than all those other lowly websites. And while those websites are trash this sub hasn't yet proven itself to be much better.

4275,"Orbital: I'd recommend making it a bit more like Forecast, or at least restrict it to your turn. As is 2 damage a turn for 2 mana is really strong, you can just shoot down your opponents creatures as soon as they're played.

Maneuver: Seems balanced but I think the Bishop's Officer could stand to have 1 less power or attack, that or make it a rare.

Rivalry: It's a bit weird but it has potential, lots of design space.

Symbiosis: Seems neat although it's really overstatted, potential 3/4 flying for 2? And at uncommon rarity? (Also the word you're looking for is Produce.)

Squadron: Again, 2 2/2s for 2 with an upside is really pushing it.

Toll: Lifelink is a bit pushy but it seems decent, maybe should be rare though.

Augment: I like the idea but aside from it being aggressively costed, maybe think about exiling the creature if it leaves play as an artifact. Repeatable recursion is a dangerous thing to mess around with.

Salvage: Seems reasonable.

Oppression: That could become really unfun really quick, see Jin Gitaxias.

Surplus: I'm not sure a mechanic name is needed for that, just saying ""enters the battlefield with counters"" should suffice.",2016-07-11 12:54:09+00:00,d57sko6,1.0,t3_4s9zip,14363.0,custommagic

Personally I'd put: ""When Mikaeus, the Dishonored enters the battlefield put a 3/2 Eldrazi Horror token onto the battlefield for each creature you own that died this turn."" (I'm sure the wording can be tightened up here...)

That way it gives a benefit when you emerge (extra 3/2) while still remaining functional when it's hard-cast.

1: Asriel saying big kids don't cry doesn't imply he got that from Chara, in society ""Big kids don't cry"" is an extremely common sentiment from society in general. It's not a good thing but it's also not something Chara propagated.

2: The writer says that Flowey saying ""You MADE them love you"" implies that he thinks Chara was manipulating the monsters into loving them. ""You MADE them love you"" can just as easily imply that Flowey's forcing blame onto Chara/Frisk yet again for effing everything up by not killing/being killed.

3: The writer makes A TON of assumptions about what Chara is saying to Asriel in between his text. Such as assuming that Chara is belittling him for crying, assuming that.

""I didn’t want to directly address this because I don’t want anything to do with this mess. Now I see Lewis and Turps have ‘addressed this’, you can go straight to them to continue the dialogue - they know far more than I do, as does Minty since she was party to the initial incident and meeting. Please leave Kim out of it too, she’s had enough on her plate.

I’m not protecting anyone - I’ve passed along every concern to Turps and Lewis that I was sent from the original incident all the way through until recently, as that’s what I asked to do by them. I expressed concerns over staying silent, and I was told to urge people to go to the police and follow correct procedure so it’s addressed officially - it’s not within my power to take any form of disciplinary action on him. And it certainly wasn’t in my power to blow the whistle on it. You saw tonight who deals out the discipline to content creators so judge for yourselves how it works.

Lazy people don't sit on their ass all day and do nothing every day yeah? They can actually do things like a normal person every once in a while.

Listen I know this all probably conflicts with your headcanon of what you want Sans to be like in your head but hey, I don't imagine Sans being anything like this and I'm not complaining.

But Chara knows, anyway if you're Chara then who's determination were they talking about leeching? Who's power did they steal? Did they steal their own power?

And if they're truly a manifestation of the player, including their past being player analogies then why did the player kill themselves? Why did the player like chocolate?

I'll get back to your points, lets talk about the first part of my first comment, they talk to the player. That seems a bit odd if they are the player.

If the player doesn't exist, who was Chara talking to at the end of a genocide route?

Who is the ""anomaly"" that Sans frequently mentions?

Also the implication that the player can't be a character in the game world is absurd and straight up wrong, there are plenty of games where the player is even talked to such as in OFF.

1: The narrator is defined and clearly has some bias such as saying you did things you didn't do, commenting on your decision to stay healthy and the fact that they always say less and seem to be more uneasy when fighting members of Chara's family.

1: The jokes you tell Woshua: There are three possible lines you can tell Woshua as a joke: ""You tell a joke about a kid who ate a pie with their bare hands."", ""You tell a joke about two kids who played in a muddy flower garden."", ""You tell a joke about a kid who slept in the soil."" Put together these pretty eerily describe key parts of Chara's story and at that point Frisk wouldn't know those things.

3: A lot of their snarky dialogue at the end of a pacifist when you return to places you visited like ""It's still just you Frisk."", ""You came all the way back here just to look at Toriel's socks. You have great priorities in life.""

4: Even in a lot of other rpg's where you can check monsters you almost never start out just knowing Trivia about the monster just by looking at them and Frisk would have no way to know. Chara however lived with the monsters and can accurately give information and trivia about them.

I always say ""I'm not the one who made it but I'll pass the compliments on to the artist"" and I do, and guess what happens every single time I do so:

They're fucking happy that I'm attracting more people to them! They're grateful that I spread it to different sites since 9/10 times they don't use reddit and have no interest in using reddit. There are so many people here who post to an imgur album of someone else's work and you're mad at me?! The one person that actually always gives proper credit?!

Aside from that, once somebody asked me to take a post down, it had about 200 karma and guess what I did? I FUCKING TOOK IT DOWN, because I respect everyone I post from. That is why I post their art, if I don't respect the artist I don't post their art because they don't deserve the free exposure.

And you want to know the last thing, I've gotten one piece of reddit gold from this so far and you know what I did for that? I donated 5 bucks to the artist's tumblr.

2: He didn't end a war, he started one. He didn't have to kill six children.

3: For one going out and killing six humans frees the monsters much quicker rather than letting them wallow in misery for a longer time and for two if he went outside he could choose his kills, in other words he'd probably be killing the sick or elderly rather than children that had their whole lives ahead of them.

4: No it wouldn't have, in her solution they could just wait for the humans to die of natural causes then take their souls.

Napstablook and Mettaton aren't confirmed cousins so they're not.

Do you see what I'm getting at? You already take things that aren't explicitly stated and treat them as canon, why should this be any different?

And canon did not say that, Chara gave the underground hope, they were Asriel's best friend, I mean you can headcanon what you want but you're the one jumping to conclusions. They hated humanity because of something humanity did to make them want to kill themselves but they seemed to like the monsters alright, at least until the player did awful shit in genocide.

If I was to recommend a Final Fantasy game, V has great gameplay, VI has great story and VII has both but is a little dated (getting a remake soon tho). My personal favorites are XI and XIV but those are MMO's which I understand aren't everyone's cup of tea. And Kingdom Hearts is nice if you have a few weeks and the degree in psychology necessary to understand the plot. Gameplay is fun though.

Fast forward 6000 years and some things may have changed.

18042,"I think it's because it was partially Dr. Maheswaren's fault that Connie was lying to her by trying to be too controlling. Pearl was 100% to blame for her actions.

As for what makes a character irredeemable, I'd say:

Murder of innocents/genocide.

Torture. (this is the one I see the most ""good"" characters getting away with)

Rape/Molestation.

Mass Desecration or needlessly cruel weapons such as chemical weaponry (even in war).

Now keep in mind characters who do these things can still do good things and may even get a pseudo redemption/noble sacrifice but I think in the mind of many readers including me they will never really be considered good people.",2015-12-31 22:38:45+00:00,cyhr1qx,1.0,t3_3yyfsl,3302.0,stevenuniverse

18707,"""I remember when it all went wrong

Guzzling eggnog all night long

We went outside

The snow was thick

Rolled our balls together made a snowman quick

Erecting a friend but there's something left

Had to indulge in some carrot theft

To make him whole

We raided the salad bowl

To give him a classic nose

I slipped and fell when I put it on

Stuck the veg where it didn't belong

I went for his face, but i hit below the waist

And now he's got a root vegetable dong

He's got a carrot for a cock (Carrot for a cock)

And it gives you quite a shock (Oh, it's unexpected)

When you see it in the flesh, so orange and so fresh

Looks like its just been pulled from the ground

He's got a carrot for a cock (Carrot for a cock)

It's the biggest on the block (oh what a massive one)

The neighbours were upset, my dad saw it as a threat

it stood so mighty and so proud

Some kind of magic happened then (Uh Oh)

He came alive and he was real my friend

An excited expression

twinkled in his eyes

We looked on in surprise as it started to rise

Scarf around his neck, his arms are made of bark

Get down on your knees he'll help you see in the dark

He has a filthy addiction

Veg on veg friction

Behind the bushes down in the park

He's got many dirty habits and it's terrified of rabbits

He'll make you moan he's organically grown

He's got a carrot for a cock (Carrot for a Cock)

You know it's hard as rock (Oh what a crunchy cock)

He's got coal on his head, No meat but one veg

He's packing so much more than just snow (Ho ho ho!)

He's got a carrot for a cock (Carrot for a cock)

But his life's against the clock (Oh such a crying shame)

Cause as the sun rose, they'd gritted the road

All was left was his bright amber chode

You'll remember this December, when you dream of his member

Now all that's left is his salty sludge

Next time it snows, you all will know

He's coming on you from above

He's just snowing you all of his love

He has a carrot for a cock (Carrot for a cock)

He's a friend you just can't knock (Oh we want him back!)

So when it gets chilly just whip out his willy

Scoop up snow and he's ready to go

They all have carrots for a cock (Carrots for a cock)

A movement you can't be stopped (It's a revolution)

To make a new best friend, just follow this trend

Give him a vegetable bell end

CARROT FOR A COCK! YAY!""

Heaven Beetle Abilities:

Aerokinesis: As I headcanon the uncorrupted Heaven Beetle as being just as small as her beetle form a physical weapon wouldn't do very well so I think Wind Manipulation might be ideal, fashioning the wind into blades and gales to attack or just using it to help her fly better. Plus it fits with the Heaven motif, for this reason I also headcanon the Earth Beetle as having Terrakinesis.

I don't think Rose or Yellow Diamond is evil (also I refuse to give anything you say about Greg any thought since you clearly have some deep seated bias and hatred towards him that you need to work out), I mean you're just making so many assumptions, I think you've gotten so into fanon that you're confusing head canon for fact with these things like Rose killing gems so she can play with humans?

Perhaps that's what homeworld saw humans and/or Pearls as, it's not because they're evil it's because they didn't want to think about it, Rose could have resorted to the rebellion because she couldn't handle the sacrificing of other species for the good of gemkind.

Here's another idea with no villain: The Diamond authority desperately needs soldiers because a separate species threatens them with extinction but the only way to get such soldiers is to drain inhabited planets of their lifeforce, how do you choose? There's no easy answer and Rose Quartz simply choose the one she believed in, that doesn't make one side better than the other.

1: All of the Crystal Gems seem to care for humanity in their own way, sure they might not be as fervent as Rose but they're not heartless.

2: What the hell did Greg do to try and alienate Pearl? Pearl tried to alienate Greg from Rose! Did you not see we need to talk? Most people would have flipped their shit at Pearl in such a situation- And I just realized you're trolling me. God damn it. I fell for it again didn't I?

However I have seen it done differently, once I read a manga where the Rose character flew into a rage and killed them both, once I saw one where it worked and the Rose and Pearl characters got together, Once I even saw one where it was resolved by the Greg character getting together with the Pearl character (I guess he realized she was a better kisser?).

20347,"No but I guess I could give it a go, I'll base them off my FFXIV character since I'm creatively bankrupt:

Gem Name: Aquamarine

Gem Location: Lower Back.

Weapons and Powers: Uses a Beam Staff in battle, think a staff with a focus on the end that shoots beams of energy, also has massively enhanced vision and can teleport short distances, the staff can be swung as a melee weapon but all in all they're pretty weak when the opponent gets up close.

Personality: Slightly pompous and condescending but knows to stay quiet in the presence of superiors, not adverse to many things morality wise, will do almost anything for self preservation, lawful neutral with slight leanings towards lawful evil.

They also have a Sunstone for a bodygaurd, she's probably their closest friend and the one person they might sacrifice their life for.

Appearance: Tiny, even smaller than Steven, most likely about a meter tall. Aquamarine (duh) colored skin, blue eyes, short spiky blue pixie cut hair, wears a mage robe at all times including gloves and boots.

Fusion Style: Something they could do in a long robe I guess, probably a ballroom dance with a lot of spinning involved.

Well that was kinda fun, good character creation exercise. Here's the character I based their appearance on by the way: http://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/6277090/

20692,"Yeah Steven would make a good White Mage, here are my thoughts on the rest of them:

Jasper is a Marauder/Warrior.

Garnet is a Pugilist/Monk.

Lapis is a FFXI Black Mage since they had offensive water magic.

Pearl is possibly a FFXI Samurai since they often wielded spears and she doesn't have much to do with Dragons.

Amethyst could be a Blue Mage which kinda works with her shapeshifting and variety of attacks? Eh I'm not certain on this one.

Connie as a Rune Fencer? Maybe?

Peridot as a Machinist from FFXIV, or possibly a ranger from FFXI.

Rose Quartz definitely seems like a Paladin, sword and shield wielder that she was.

Ruby and Sapphire both remind me of Geomancers given their ability to passively effect their surroundings.

Any thoughts? :P",2015-11-14 05:11:13+00:00,cwzolo3,3.0,t1_cwzo8fy,884.0,stevenuniverse
20693,"1: What the fuck, Lapis is the one torturing her in fusion and when did she torture Lapis mentally?

2: She didn't try and blow up Beach City, she told Peridot to blow up the Crystal Gems.

3: Wow you're really grasping at straws here, three word of god examples and you still believe your precious little water witch is morally better than Jasper? And you only answered one of said examples.

4: Good.

5: Yeah so nazi techies/scientists get off the hook but nazi soldiers should die? And where the fuck have we seen her doing good? She's only helping the Gems so she wouldn't die, that's not good it's just being a coward. And let's not forget she participated in the most vile act of the show so far which is forced fusion, basically a mix of necrophilia and rape.

6: Still waiting for an answer on how Lapis is such a sweet angel for tormenting Jasper at the bottom of the sea when she could have easily just let the CG's handle it.",2015-11-14 04:57:21+00:00,cwzo981,15.0,t1_cwznvx9,868.0,stevenuniverse
20694,"1: Who said she tortured Lapis you sick fuck?

2: Garnet attacked her first, she probably would've just locked them up if they came quietly.

Ok so you're going against word of god? Because Rebecca said there are no true villains in the show. Matt Burnett said that Jasper was complicated and that she has good in her (via magic colors). And Lauren Zeke said Lapis was selfish.

And as for Jasper crawling towards Steven, being tormented for months doesn't do the mind well, I mean Lapis went a bit nuts after her years of solitude. Plus according to what she's been told her whole life the CG's are evil so why would she expect Steven to help her? Last thing of course it was a choice for Lapis to not bitch slap Jasper, it's because she wanted revenge, think of a better reason and I'll accept it but as is there's no other reason for her to do it.

Also you haven't said a good reason why Jasper is worse than Peridot yet.",2015-11-14 04:11:00+00:00,cwzn1z3,13.0,t1_cwzmq59,726.0,stevenuniverse

Yeah if she wanted to protect Steven why didn't she just use the BIGGEST FUCKING BODY OF WATER ON EARTH THAT WAS RIGHT NEXT TO HER to curb stomp Jasper into the ground, I mean Jasper was already weak from getting her ass kicked by Garnet, also even if she didn't feel up to fighting the CG's were right there and could have easily 4v1ed her.

No her time as a prisoner has made her embittered and she sought revenge on the closest asshole who wronged her which unfortunately for Jasper happened to be her, not very noble eh?",2015-11-14 03:18:59+00:00,cwzlmi3,11.0,t1_cwzl9l8,755.0,stevenuniverse

At least I had the maturity to step down when I realized where we were arguing.

I've been the bigger person repeatedly, first I stepped down in our original confrontation because we were just upsetting the sub, then when he randomly attacked me today I told him if he wants to talk we should do it over PM and even now I've been trying to tell him that he's not going to achieve anything by yelling at me here, and while I make no denials about being an ass I will protest to the ends of the earth if you try and imply that Darth isn't equally in the shitpit.

Also don't misunderstand my speech, we were both in the wrong not just me, I suppose for now I'll try and ignore him but don't try and stop me from defending myself if he attacks me again.",2015-11-06 06:00:38+00:00,cwqe0xn,27.0,t1_cwqcmjx,3186.0,stevenuniverse

Peridot is working on the drill, presumably after Back to the Barn.

Pearl captures Peridot, is presumably still bitter about Peridot's comments in Back to the Barn.

Pearl remarks that Peridot's gem is in the same place as hers and readies a needle.

Flashback to Pearl finding out that the gem is the most sensitive part of a gems body, or perhaps that's just the case with gems located on the head.

Cut to present where Pearl is presumably going to be trying some experiments in pain on Peridot's gem, half science, half revenge.
