3) I have about a year of experience with 5e 
4) I'm thinking about a Half-elf bard
5) Valentius Peersath was born to a middle class merchant family  and raised to take over the family business. During his time training to be a salesman he met an old bard who taught him the basics of being a charismatic story teller and  singer. Valentius took the idea of being a bard and ran with it leaving his family to pursue a life of adventure and story telling, of charisma and charm, of valor and bravery (and money).

7) God I love movies and games! I'd say any Inglorious Bastards would be my favorite movie. Game wise, I'd say one of my favorite games ever was Battlefield: Bad Company 2.

362,I've heard a lot of good things about using krylon. I'd suggest thinning it down more a little and then spraying your primer from a little bit farther away so it's less thickly coated. ,2016-02-29 20:50:15+00:00,d0iht68,1.0,t3_48c6jd,1967.0,Warhammer40k

365,Alpha legion. Hands down the most interesting to me plus they actually use tactics that put most other chapters/legions to shame. As a side note they are definitely loyal to humanity in my opinion despite being labeled traitors. ,2016-02-29 16:31:32+00:00,d0i6c7e,1.0,t3_480uoc,117215.0,40kLore

368,If anyone has played borderlands 2 maybe make ork weapons kinda like a combo of Hyperion weapons where the more you shoot the more accurate it becomes with the bandit weapons and their extremely large magazines but crappy aim and damage. So like the weapons could fire really quickly with big mags and low damage and start off as accurate as a shotgun in the hands of a blind man to becoming around equal to a space marines and their bolter the longer the gun fires. ,2016-02-27 18:56:29+00:00,d0g0ym6,1.0,t3_462tng,964022.0,Eternalcrusade

374,"Round 1: I'd probably say Horus considering he is rather competent at being both strategic and charismatic but for a second choice I'd say Lion because despite his social skills being on par with a walnut he is arguably the best tactician, something pretty useful for a Master of War. 

Round 2: if I knew if the heresy I'd definitely choose Alpharius because the need for a strong warrior who could unite others to their cause is not exactly what is needed to prevent a civil war, someone who can stop traitors before they even begin to plot against the Imperium is needed. Alpharius also has the advantage of still being a great tactician. ",2016-02-26 22:11:58+00:00,d0f4lqu,1.0,t3_47pmlq,22379.0,40kLore
