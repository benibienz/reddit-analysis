95,I dont mind it. Especially when I need to get high amount of elixir quick. My DE stays around 18k. When I upgrade what I had to then I switch to different composition. ,2015-12-10 22:48:19+00:00,cxunrxm,3.0,t1_cxunlq4,266.0,ClashOfClans

104,"My go-to attack strategy for bases like that is take out cc troops first, obviously. Then use about 12 giants around to bait and distract defenses and take max hogs in cc to do real damage. Two heal spells to keep em alive. That's the gist of it. ",2015-08-22 06:56:14+00:00,cublf2v,1.0,t3_3hxomn,8912.0,ClashOfClans
105,I started a new account and found that having a valkyrie in cc for defense really helps. I defended against 7 attacks with valkyrie still alive. Hope that helps :D,2015-07-08 10:14:08+00:00,csw1avp,1.0,t3_3ciwmu,11516.0,ClashOfClans
