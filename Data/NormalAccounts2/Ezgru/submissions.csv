Before I share my questions I just want to clarify, that some of the things we're working through currently AND I do not want any advice on what I should do with my husband. Ha. 

First topic. My brother (19) was killed in a freak car accident January 2015. He had no insurance. None form work and none on his vehicle.  He totaled my step moms car (side note, she had a beater, which was totaled, her work car and my dads car). My brothers car was in the shop. March 2015 (after paying off my previous vehicle) I offered to take my brothers jeep and make the payments for my dad because they couldn't afford to keep the car but wanted to have it since it was a brand new 2014 and the last of his things. 
Fast forward to now. The car is still in my dad and brothers name, and I applied for a loan to refinance the car but wasn't approved. I have not very good credit (because of a precious job that just decided to never pay me which resulted in debt piling up and tons of late fees) so I am at a loss. I want to get the car in my name because it has been over 1.6 years that I've been making payments for my dad. I haven't missed any payments, which is good for my dad- not for me.  What are my options? My sister wants the jeep now, so it's just a matter of what I can do to get my own vehicle. 

Another reason I'm stuck, I found out after we were married (April 2016) that my husband had $1000s of debt he just decided to not pay for about 5 years. His credit is shot, so he's no help and we've gotten down to two more debts to pay down. So I'm stuck. He keeps saying he wants to buy a house but doesn't understand why not being able to finance a car is a big deal. Also want to mention- I've paid down all of my debts, except for school loans, have a secured card and 2 other CCs.
