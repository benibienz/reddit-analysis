I also recommend you play it before Fallout 4 because it will make Fallout 4 look worse compared to it and will make it hard to get into IMO.,2016-05-17 12:08:40+00:00,d38ol4a,1.0,t3_4jqhcf,1337,xboxone

119,"Basically you're in the world of Kyrat, a very big map and you start off with very limited resources and abilities, as you progress through the game there are hundreds of activities you can do from supply drop pickups and fashion quests to taking on fortresses that are very hard to capture unless you progress through the main campaign.

 You can do so many things in the game, like hunting animals for fun or crafting upgrades to your wallet or so you can hold more weapons. You can cause havoc as a fricking elephant! 

The story is okay so far imho, I haven't progressed too far on it because I am overwhelmed over how many things you can do! I never have tried the coop play so I cannot really tell you what it is like but it is fun.  

That's not all in the main game, there is also online multiplayer where you pvp against other players with rpg's and the elephants! Also, there is the map editor which I have spent a lot of time with because it is so darn fun. You can create some cool landscapes and make awesome structures, but the cooler part is doing ai battles, to see if one enemy can take on another face to face. 

Far Cry 4 isn't as good as Far Cry 3 is in terms of story and gameplay, but it is a damn amazing game and I really think you should go buy it, with or without the dlc that has some yeti ice land thingy and some other stuff that I might get to playing eventually. Just pick the game up for cheap as I assure you that you will have a blast! Have fun!

242,"Ok, so first of all, I think the bundles with all the games for black Friday are finished? There will be some cyber monday ones soon though. If you look around the web, you will find some excellent bundles. Fallout 4 bundle + Battlefront + Tomb Raider etc. But currently, to just get a bundle with 1 game by itself, It would probably be either the Forza 6 one or Fallout 4 bundle. Depends on whether you want to pay a bit extra for a really cool console and controller  and racing game, or just a normal bundle with a rpg shooter which will keep you more entertained than forza probably.

If you bought the GoW UE, you will get the whole collection, with bc. But to play online on either the first original or remastered one, you will need xbox live gold, this will come with your console, 1 month iirc. But you can buy 12 months from a website called cdkeys.com for like $30. 

If you had to buy either halo mcc or halo 5, it would depend on what you want, if you want a good story, mcc has all 4 games with good stories, but the multiplayer is broken and not as good as halo 5, but halo 5 also has a story, but not as good as the other ones. The multiplayer for halo 5 however is fantastic, best one in the halo series. The dedicated servers are very good, the game modes, warzone btb etc are AWESOME! Combat is amazing as well. Overall I think you will have a better time with halo 5 than MCC. If there are anymore questions you can ask me.
