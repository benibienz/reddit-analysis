I had a problem with my power supply as it stopped working. I contacted support and told me they would be replacing it for me for free because my Xbox is still in warranty and that they would also send a shipping label.

Turns out I didn't get the label and I contacted them again and I got told again that I would receive the label in my email. Guess what happens next? I didn't receive it.

Fast forward today and I get in touch with an agent named Mark who I once again thank for being an awesome person! Basically I was told that apparantly you don't get shipping labels for the psu and that you only get it for the console, kinect, controllers etc. He then proceeds to send me another replacement and put in a shipping label even when he didn't have to. 

Thank you so much Mark for helping me out and letting me be able to play my Xbox again after 3 months!",xboxone,Outstanding service from Xbox support!,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/5b825l/outstanding_service_from_xbox_support/

You can already see what the problem is, the fact that I have to go into sabotage which is a pain in itself on Xbox. I have to be able to manage to pickup a hero token when other people are camping them, and then manage to get 50 kills with a hero, drives me insane. Also the fact that I have done about 10 games of sabotage and not once have I picked up a hero token let alone get the 50 kills.

I have no problem with the get 50 kills as a hero, that's easy, the only problem is that I have to be lucky to get a hero token making it a luck based contract. This is my last objective btw for all the Hutt contracts since their all done so this is also why it is mostly infuriating me and that it is so hard to join a sabotage game since the matchmaking is all screwed up. 

I just hope that DICE don't do this again especially because I pay for these things and when they are done by luck that just really puts me off. If anyone could give me some tips or they are having any issues with this as well then please let me know. Thanks.

Edit: Well, I finally finished it, I feel really guilty for it but I had to camp the hero tokens twice and got 30 kills with Nien Nunb then next match got 25 kills as Greedo.

I live in australia, I got an xbox one at home about 12 months ago. I got an extra COD AW controller with the xbox, and 7 months in the rb button stopped working, it won't even click, it's stuck.

So the other controller from before is now having the RB button stop partially working. I can still click it unlike the other controller. Sometimes it would work sometimes it wouldn't. I have to blow into the rb button and sometimes it will work and sometimes it won't. 

Could somebody please help me?
