3,"You should defiantly buy a hardware device, either trezor, keepkey or ledger nano S.

Trezor is the most popular at the moment. Use this to store your BTC, for the love of god don't use blockchain.info's wallet anymore for anything.

Next. you need to figure out this income tax thing. is your employer reporting to the government that you are an employee, and that you are being paid? If this is the case you absolutely need to set some BTC aside to pay income tax...otherwise you need to make a choice on this...

You will get a better rate for exchanging your BTC on QuadrigaCX (lees fees) However, you will be identifying yourself to do this. So you better be paying your taxes if you end up verifying your identity on QuadrigaCX. They're withdrawal options include cash and to your bank account.

Theoretically, if your employer is not reporting you as an employee to the government, and the government doesn't know you are working, you could withdraw cash from BTM's or sell the bitcoin through localbitcoins for cash without having to pay income tax.
I know that's tempting, but the risk is probably not worth it unless you are in the highest tax bracket. &lt;- just my two cents.

&gt; By NATHANIEL POPPER October 11, 2016
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin was created by libertarian-minded programmers with a deep suspicion of central banks and the national currencies they issue.
&gt; 
&gt; Yet it is central banks that are doing some of the most ambitious work of late in trying to harness the technology introduced by Bitcoin.
&gt; 
&gt; The central bankers do not want their institutions to own or use Bitcoin itself. Instead, they hope they can use the decentralized method of record-keeping introduced by Bitcoin — known as the blockchain or distributed ledger — to complete and record transactions in the real economy more efficiently, quickly and transparently.
&gt; 
&gt; The most enthusiastic central banks — including the Bank of England and the People’s Bank of China — have discussed issuing their national currencies onto some sort of distributed ledger, a name that comes from the concept of several parties keeping records simultaneously.
&gt; 
&gt; Blockchains allow several different players to keep a shared spreadsheet using cryptography and so-called consensus mechanisms that provide a way to agree on which transactions happened at what time.
&gt; 
&gt; For the central banks, the promise of the technology is that it would allow them to track every pound or renminbi on every step of its travels through the financial system in real time — something that is impossible now. The goal would be to make the financial system more transparent, fast, efficient and secure.
&gt; 
&gt; If the central banks succeed, it would be one of the greatest unexpected twists in new technology: An invention aimed at dethroning central banks and making it harder for money to be tracked instead ends up empowering those central banks and making money more easily traceable.
&gt; 
&gt; The Bank of England has produced several research papers on the topic. One suggests that the economic benefits of issuing a digital currency on a distributed ledger could add as much as 3 percent to a country’s economic output, thanks to the efficiency it could offer.
&gt; 
&gt; A deputy governor at the People’s Bank of China, Fan Yifei, wrote for Bloomberg View that “the conditions are ripe for digital currencies, which can reduce operating costs, increase efficiency and enable a wide range of new applications.”
&gt; 
&gt; And in a speech on Friday, the Fed governor overseeing new technology, Lael Brainard, said the technology had the potential to transform multiple aspects of the financial system.
&gt; 
&gt; “We are paying close attention to distributed ledger technology, or blockchain, recognizing this may represent the most significant development in many years in payments, clearing and settlement,” Ms. Brainard said.
&gt; 
&gt; Even the central bank officials who are most enthusiastic about these experiments say it will be years before any central bank issues its own currency onto a live distributed ledger.
&gt; 
&gt; Some critics say the public interest in the blockchain has been all talk and no substance — an easy way for stuffy central bankers to appear hip and relevant.
&gt; 
&gt; David Andolfatto, a researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said many of the central banks looking at blockchain technology would be better served by spending time and energy in updating the current software that underlies the financial system.
&gt; 
&gt; “If you take a snapshot of the existing plumbing, it looks a bit ugly,” Mr. Andolfatto said. “There’s nothing magical about a blockchain in solving this problem.”
&gt; 
&gt; Even within the Fed, though, other researchers and officials have expressed more excitement about the technology.
&gt; 
&gt; A week before Ms. Brainard of the Fed gave her speech on distributed ledgers, the chairwoman of the Fed, Janet L. Yellen, was asked about the technology at a congressional hearing. She said that “innovation using these technologies could be extremely helpful and bring benefits to society.”
&gt; 
&gt; The Fed has been pushed to act by the big banks that it regulates, many of which are experimenting with distributed ledgers as a way to settle trades and record data and transactions. Just last week, JPMorgan Chase said it was moving toward a public release this year of its “enterprise grade” blockchain.
&gt; 
&gt; Most financial institutions and central banks are looking at distributed ledgers that would be maintained on the computers of all the major players in the financial system, including the central bank and the biggest financial institutions.

62,"By NATHANIEL POPPER
October 11, 2016

Bitcoin was created by libertarian-minded programmers with a deep suspicion of central banks and the national currencies they issue.

Yet it is central banks that are doing some of the most ambitious work of late in trying to harness the technology introduced by Bitcoin.

The central bankers do not want their institutions to own or use Bitcoin itself. Instead, they hope they can use the decentralized method of record-keeping introduced by Bitcoin — known as the blockchain or distributed ledger — to complete and record transactions in the real economy more efficiently, quickly and transparently.

The most enthusiastic central banks — including the Bank of England and the People’s Bank of China — have discussed issuing their national currencies onto some sort of distributed ledger, a name that comes from the concept of several parties keeping records simultaneously.

Blockchains allow several different players to keep a shared spreadsheet using cryptography and so-called consensus mechanisms that provide a way to agree on which transactions happened at what time.

For the central banks, the promise of the technology is that it would allow them to track every pound or renminbi on every step of its travels through the financial system in real time — something that is impossible now. The goal would be to make the financial system more transparent, fast, efficient and secure.

If the central banks succeed, it would be one of the greatest unexpected twists in new technology: An invention aimed at dethroning central banks and making it harder for money to be tracked instead ends up empowering those central banks and making money more easily traceable.

The Bank of England has produced several research papers on the topic. One suggests that the economic benefits of issuing a digital currency on a distributed ledger could add as much as 3 percent to a country’s economic output, thanks to the efficiency it could offer.

A deputy governor at the People’s Bank of China, Fan Yifei, wrote for Bloomberg View that “the conditions are ripe for digital currencies, which can reduce operating costs, increase efficiency and enable a wide range of new applications.”

And in a speech on Friday, the Fed governor overseeing new technology, Lael Brainard, said the technology had the potential to transform multiple aspects of the financial system.

“We are paying close attention to distributed ledger technology, or blockchain, recognizing this may represent the most significant development in many years in payments, clearing and settlement,” Ms. Brainard said.

Even the central bank officials who are most enthusiastic about these experiments say it will be years before any central bank issues its own currency onto a live distributed ledger.

Some critics say the public interest in the blockchain has been all talk and no substance — an easy way for stuffy central bankers to appear hip and relevant.

David Andolfatto, a researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said many of the central banks looking at blockchain technology would be better served by spending time and energy in updating the current software that underlies the financial system.

“If you take a snapshot of the existing plumbing, it looks a bit ugly,” Mr. Andolfatto said. “There’s nothing magical about a blockchain in solving this problem.”

Even within the Fed, though, other researchers and officials have expressed more excitement about the technology.

A week before Ms. Brainard of the Fed gave her speech on distributed ledgers, the chairwoman of the Fed, Janet L. Yellen, was asked about the technology at a congressional hearing. She said that “innovation using these technologies could be extremely helpful and bring benefits to society.”

The Fed has been pushed to act by the big banks that it regulates, many of which are experimenting with distributed ledgers as a way to settle trades and record data and transactions. Just last week, JPMorgan Chase said it was moving toward a public release this year of its “enterprise grade” blockchain.

Most financial institutions and central banks are looking at distributed ledgers that would be maintained on the computers of all the major players in the financial system, including the central bank and the biggest financial institutions.

In the systems being discussed, each player in the system would communicate with all the others anytime money moved in the system, allowing everyone to update the ledgers on their computer systems simultaneously. This would provide multiple backups if the central bank’s computers came under attack. It would also hypothetically allow them to complete transactions much more quickly, and would make it easier to spot rogue actors.

Eric Piscini, who oversees work on blockchain by the consulting firm Deloitte, said that a year ago, central banks were looking at the technology mostly because they wanted to understand what private banks were talking about.

Now, he says, the central banks are embracing the technology to revamp their own infrastructures.

That's insane, and probably not accurate considering most miners in China are paying peanuts for their power.

With that said, it's interesting to see that approximately $65000 worth of energy is being injected into the Bitcoin network per hour! That's 1.2 million dollars per day.

Finally, there are direct channels, and while this does a good job of removing intermediaries, you lose a lot of insight into who is licensing your music and how they are using it.

UjoMusic plans to address these issues with the release of their closed beta by the end of 2016. The system combines the transparent attribute of a blockchain with smart contract technology. Users will be able to buy different types of licenses, such as the right to play in a commercial, in a bar, in a youtube video, or just when sitting at home with friends, by sending ether to a wallet that can be easily branded as the artist’s own. A smart contract is then executed which will determine the type of license purchased based on the amount paid, deliver the music to the user, immutably maintain a record of the contract bought on the blockchain, and then pay directly to all the stakeholders involved in the creation of the music. While removing intermediaries in both the distribution and payment processes, this solution adds another layer of transparency that helps artists ensure that when they see their music being used in various ways, that it has been properly licensed, while providing an easy way for a licensee to prove their ownership of the correct license.  

PeerTracks is another solution leveraging blockchain technology to change how artists interact with their userbase. Unlike UjoMusic, which will replace the existing studios and rights management with something transparent and content producer-centric, PeerTracks envision some dramatic changes in how musicians build relationships with their user base.

Whereas UjoMusic acts as a tool for artists to directly connect with the users licensing their products from their own homepage, PeerTracks behaves more like a digital service provider with a twist. Songs and albums can be streamed, downloaded, everyone who is supposed to get paid does, and PeerTracks proudly compares their 5% fee to Apple’s 30% take, while noting the difficulties for artists to gain access to the iTunes store.

Artists can sell ‘Notes’, which are a sort of multifaceted security tied directly to the artists themselves. Artists can use the Notes to figure out who their biggest fans are, offering them perks such as free concert tickets or early previews of new work. Functionally this is a well reasoned prediction market; rising stars will be discoverable by watching their Notes value.

So where does blockchain come in? The Notes can be bought and sold, their value goes up the more an artist’s content is streamed or downloaded, so a fan can promote a band and watch the value of the Notes they own rise. These Notes are all tokens on the blockchain, allowing them to be freely tradeable for Notes and currencies without requiring intermediaries in the process.

Notes are subject to the market force of each artist’s NoteBot, a software agent funded by streaming and music sales that purchases Notes on the open market and then shreds them. This mechanism effectively increases the value of the notes as an artist becomes more popular by shrinking the supply of Notes which are limited in number.

Will UjoMusic’s efficiency in a familiar environment receive quicker uptake than PeerTracks, which requires some thought, as it integrates things that are currently external to the revenue model? The first fosters artistic innovation, the second both artistic and business model innovation. It isn’t clear which one will get traction, and these are by no means the only efforts to reform the music industry, which makes this a very interesting area to observe.",2016-09-19 19:40:15+00:00,d7tkeru,2.0,t1_d7tkdgm,49.0,Bitcoin
79,"When it comes to the $15 billion recorded music industry, the artists rarely come out with a big payoff.  The recorded music industry began in the late 1800s with the invention of Thomas Edison’s phonograph and benefited greatly from the rise of radio broadcasting in the 1920s. However, back in those days, for the artist, it meant that in order for their music to be heard, they would have to make deals with a series of intermediaries, such as record labels, publishers, and distributors. Almost 100 years later, musicians still must go through this archaic system of intermediaries developed before the advent of the internet, where the artists lose up to 86% of the proceeds from their music.

This is where blockchain comes in. Much like our experience in international payroll processing, the music industry can benefit from the existence of blockchain technology. Any industry that in encumbered by inefficient intermediaries is in danger of disruption, and the music industry is ripe for it. There are many blockchain oriented startups in this area, but two of them shine through as having a unique, innovative perspective on what should be done.


UjoMusic’s initial manifesto at TheProblem.WTF immediately offered a simple, understandable value proposition:

Shouldn’t it be possible in a digital world for the royalties to come directly to you, instead of through a slow, inefficient, and opaque chain of collection societies and publishing administrators?


Their characterization of the music industry’s troubles is as slick a piece of writing on an industry wide blockchain application as I’ve seen this year, but it dates back to the summer of 2015. They collaborated with Imogen Heap to release her song, Tiny Human, on the Ethereum blockchain through an alpha version of their solution in October of 2015. The way this worked was that users would create a wallet on alpha.ujomusic.com, and send Ether, the digital currency of the Ethereum blockchain, to it. Once the wallet was funded, the user would send money to a smart contract, which would issue a license to the user, granting them the MP3 file, while simultaneously paying out directly to Imogen and the other members of her team.

I spoke with Jesse Grushack, Director of UjoMusic, regarding the inefficiencies of the music industry,

There are three main avenues for music distribution, mainstream channels (such as radio, TV, bars), digital service providers (such as Spotify and Apple Music) and direct channels (such as soundcloud).  

 With the mainstream channels, you run into two issues, accessibility and payments. In order to get access, you typically need to go through one of the big three record labels, Sony, Warner and Universal. Then, if you want to get paid, you have to join one of three Performing Rights Organizations (PROs) that are regulated and controlled. It can take up to two years for the artist to see their payments, and they have absolutely no insight into what is happening in the meantime.

With digital service providers, licensing deals are negotiated directly with the labels and publishers without the need of PROs, since these are not public performances. While this may create efficiencies and cost savings for those negotiating, it is only the Beyonce’s of the world that benefit.

I grew up in a christian home raised to be a christian. I found the light one day in church when I realized that the preacher was a bully enacting guilt and shame from the pulpit to control the minds of weak men/donors. 

With that said, religion taught me some valuable lessons about propaganda, delusion, hope, story telling, symbols and power. and so Religion has a value of a sort.

So do I still believe in God? I do in a way, just not the version fed to me by other humans seeking to control me by being gods proxy. So let me just say that I'm open to the possibility of God, and I appreciate the history and heritage of Christianity.

My niece will be raised by her religious parents to be a christian. And hopefully, the ark will allow these gifts to pass under their radar without scorn.

153,"Hi fellow Canadian,

transactions fees are minimal, (maximum five cents). just make sure you include a medium sized transaction fee (more then 3 cents) so that your transaction is confirmed in a reasonable amount of time. (sometimes they even pay the transaction fee for you)


As for transferring your funds to cold storage, you should still be able to do that as long as you set up the cold wallet correctly and send the funds to the cold wallet address. play with this first before sending everything! but yes, the keys are kind of locked in with blockchain, so sending your bitcoin to another set of keys is advised.

as for copay, I haven't used them before, but if they require your name, then they are kinda no different from blockchain, sounds like a hot wallet still. EDIT: never mind, they look good! open source and multi sig is better then a hot wallet for sure. its still not technically cold storage, but its defiantly moderately secure to use multi signatures to secure your bitcoin. I used to use the same method before I bought a hardware wallet called trezor. you shouldn't have to provide a name to download their wallet. and if you are, lie. it's best to not have your name attached to bitcoin if you can avoid it.",2016-07-30 03:09:18+00:00,d5wrqd7,1.0,t3_4va9kw,831.0,Bitcoin

You can do this because different rates are charged during ""peak periods"" when the power grid is under a lot of strain. The highest rate for power is usually on Monday-fridays from 9-5pm. While the lowest rate for power consumption is on the weekends.

184,"Yes the transaction fees incentivize the miners to mine (find blocks + confirm transactions). At present these fees are small for end users (like 5 cents). Because miners can bundle a bunch of transactions into one block, they get 5 cents X 500 transactions. 

In the long run, the transaction fee will first become equal to and then replace that reward (12.5) we were talking about as the main mechanism for incentivizing miners.

&gt;I'd imagine this is why it isn't the new official currency of the world, but works well for large, high value purchases.

^This statement is interesting^ Because from my perspective, I can say with confidence, this is why bitcoin is the new and only official world currency, and works very well for high and medium sized transactions.

185,"On Point One: Yes it is more complicated than guessing a number, but essentially that's what it boils down to for simplification. The miners are all trying to be the first ones to solve a math problem. the only questions is how difficult that math problem is, are you guessing a number between 1 and 10, or 1 in 100. 

Ingeniously, the network self regulates the difficulty of the problem based on how much mining power is running on the protocol. So if you have only one computer mining, the protocol will know that there's not a lot of power to solve an equation and will make the math problem easier for the solo miner. like guessing between 1 and 10.

But if you have thousands of computers, hardware designed for solving this specific math problem, the protocol will know this and adjust that math problems difficulty to something like guessing a number between 1 and 10^999


On your second point: You have it Exactly. To clarify, The blockchain is a ledger of every transaction. yes. Most wallets keep a copy of the ledger (some don't). yes. This prevents people from gaming the system, since everyone has the same record of what happened. yes. It's updated every block (each time the miners find the solution to the math problem they are competing to answer) which is about every 10 minutes. yes. The transactions that are queued go into those blocks every 10 minutes. yes. Most everyone's blockchain copy will be updated, yes. The miners get to approve and CHOOSE which transactions get to be confirmed every 10 minutes. And most miners approve the transactions that pay the most in transaction fees. 

Not all queued transactions can be confirmed every Block (10 minutes) because blocks can only store up to 1 megabyte of data at the moment. So if there's more than 1MB of transaction data waiting to be confirmed (which is often the case), then transactions who don't pay high enough transaction fees will have to wait for the next block to be solved to get confirmed by the miners. yikes, that was a mouthful.

Ok you're a transaction in line to go on a roller coaster. And your position in line is based on how much you're willing to pay. The roller coaster has 20 seats, and your 22nd in line because you payed 5 cents, and the people ahead of you payed 7 cents. the roller coaster comes by and everyone loads up, but you have to wait 10 minutes since there's not enough seats. You are now 2nd in line. You wait ten minutes, but during that time 19 other transaction people decided to pay 6 cents and cut  in line ahead of you (these are important people in a rush who need to get going). You are now 21st in line. you wait another 10 minutes and are now first in line. since no one decided they were in a rush to out bid you for your spot in line,  you board the roller coaster, have the ride of your life. You're now a confirmed transaction.",2016-07-10 04:37:54+00:00,d56bx7n,8.0,t1_d56awln,1970.0,lego
186,"So mining in Bitcoin is this really creative and nuanced thing. I'll try to make this really simple.

So anyone can ""mine"" Bitcoin. But what is that process really? Fundamentally mining is a guessing game/competition between all the miners.

So if you have a computer and I have a computer, we both are trying to use our machines to guess the correct number between 1 and infinity that the Bitcoin protocol has chosen. 

The only problem is that I have a Windows 98 operating system, and you have Windows 10! So your system is way better at making more guesses at that mystery number is a shorter amount of time. 

Example: My computer can only guess 100,000 numbers a minute, but yours can guess 1,000,000 numbers a minute. This means you are more likely to guess the right number that the protocol is holding behind a closed door than I am.

So your computer is better at mining. What's the consequence of that? The reward!

For solving the equation/finding the hidden number you get a reward! But once you find the number, the competition starts over again with a new number behind a closed door that everyone is try to find. We call this process, finding a Block. So Bitcoin mining is basically the biggest guessing competition is human/technological history.


there are three parts to the reward, which you get for finding the correct number. 

The first is that you get the base reward of 12.5 Bitcoins deposited to your account, like we discussed in the previous post.

The second is that you get to choose which transactions to recognize as valid that are waiting to be recognized on the ledger/blockchain (this is a entirely different rabbit hole Alice, so I won't get into that...yet). But why should you choose some transactions as valid over others?

Because, there is a transaction fee that you also collect as a reward. And this is the third part of the reward. You get all the transactions fees associated with the transactions you choose to verify!

188,"The halving is an event that happens about every four years.
to explain it I kind of need to explain what bitcoin is.

But I'll give you the short answer. Previously, about every ten minutes 25 brand new Bitcoins were ""mined"" into existence. So every day about 3600 new Bitcoins were introduced into the total Bitcoin economy.

But about every four years, there is a rule that is activated that reduces the payout/reward by half. And that event is what we call the Halving, which was today. So now, instead of 25 new Bitcoins being created every 10 minutes, only 12.5 Bitcoins will be created.

This happens every four years, so come the next halving in four years the reward will be cut to 6.25 Bitcoins and so on. This will continue until the year 2140, when the last Bitcoins will be mined.

There will ultimately be only 21 million bitcoins ever minted.

That...was the short answer.

210,"Hi sticky,

LAT is designed for students intending to go after a Arts degree AFTER completing their 2 years at Seneca. 

From what I understand, the way it works is that after 2nd semester you have the option to take York courses at the same time as your regular LAT courses. This usually means more stress for students since they end up taking 6 courses at the same time, so some people take summer courses instead to lighten the load.

You absolutely need a 3.0 GPA minimum (B average) to succesfully transfer. this is none negotiable. 

For all the courses you complete in LAT, York should give you 36 credits which equal 12 courses. PLUS any York courses you did while in the LAT program. You need around 40 courses to get a degree, so you'll be looking at another 3 to 2.5 years (6 semesters to 5 Semesters) in your degree.

Total time for diploma and degree is 5 years.


There is also a similar program to LAT called Arts and Science University Transfer (ASU). This pathway gives you the same credit as described above and works the same way, BUT for the University of Toronto, AND for Any arts AND SCIENCE degree.",2016-06-25 02:28:03+00:00,d4n346i,1.0,t3_4pjori,97593.0,Seneca

A Bill has passed parliament to omit ""thy Sons"" with ""of us""...

The Bill will now go before the Senate who will decide upon its approval. The bill is expected to pass.

225,"so what happens for depositing CAD?

Is it converted to USD? Or is there CAD/BTC exchange?

EDIT: Full press release below from their Blog: 
&gt; We are thrilled to announce the expansion of Gemini services to the Great White North! This is just the beginning of Gemini’s international expansion and our tireless pursuit of building a world-class digital asset exchange with global reach.

&gt;As of today, registered customers in Canada can trade bitcoin and ether on Gemini’s ETH/BTC order book. This means that registered customers will be able to:

&gt;    Buy ETH with BTC, and sell ETH for BTC

&gt;Coming soon, we’ll be opening our USD order books (BTC/USD and ETH/USD) to Canadian customers as well. As a registered customer, this will allow you to:

&gt;    Buy BTC with USD or ETH, and sell BTC for USD or ETH
    Buy ETH with USD or BTC, and sell ETH for USD or BTC

&gt;We’re excited to bring our friends to the North aboard the Gemini spaceship for our journey, and we look forward to expanding to additional areas of operations in the near future.

&gt;Bienvenue à bord!

&gt;Team Gemini

So what i can glean from this is that you have to deposit USD to trade on the exchange...meaning i have to convert from CAD to USD...which costs money to do.

This is only useful for Canadians who already have USD in USD accounts...which isn't exactly for us little guys. 

I guess they're going after big Canadian fish with this. Looks like QuadrigaCX is safe for now.


On the other hand, this may open up an opportunity for canadians to get USD by selling long held BTC or ETH, so not a bad option from that perspective. However, QuadrigaCX also already has a USD/BTC exchange available on their platform for Canadians...so this isn't really anything new in the ecosystem, except maybe for an exchange with more volume.",2016-06-07 01:14:55+00:00,d3yuwoi,1.0,t3_4mtlmf,34023.0,Bitcoin

238,"&gt; AVW: Did you know Dave Kleiman as well?

&gt;JVP: Dave Kleiman was an exceptional man. If you want to know more about Dave, you should talk to the SANS folks.

&gt;One of the top SANS people is also having a conference in Las Vegas in September, where the Trustee of the Tulip Trust is expected to appear.

Ok, so here's what I've pieced together of the story that's being drawn for us. keep in mind, none of it is likely true, but I think its important to understand the narrative that is being painted with this ""evidence"".

1. There's some kind of trust that was created that handed over control of 1.1 million bitcoins to David Klieman. 
* At least 100000 of these bitcoins are required to be returned to Wright by 2020. Wright can also barrow funds from the trust. 

1. Wright is likely the beneficiary of the trust. While David Kleiman was the trustee of the trust, who was in charge of securing the 1.1 million bitcoins. 
1. David also appointed someone else, as co-trustee that only he knew the identity of.
1. This anonymous co-trustee could act as trustee in some way as well. 
1. 7 keys were created for this trust, only three were needed for access.
1.   it's likely that both trustees had access to these keys or could gain access, While Wright does not have access to these keys.
1. Control of the trust was supposed to revert to Wright upon Dave's death. The implementation of this would likely be handled by the co-trustee.
1. Dave dies...So control was either given back to Wright, or it was now in the hands of the anonymous co-trustee.
1. However, it appears from this article that the co-trustee is known by Wright/Joseph VaughnPerling and is apparently a ""She"" 
1.  She will be at a conference this coming September and may possibly be one of the three female presenters listed on the conference website: https://www.sans.org/event/network-security-2016/instructors/the-core-group 

The following is a message posted by Joseph VaughnPerling addressed to the co-trustee:

&gt; “The Tulip Trading Trust trustee, appointed by Dave Kleiman as of Oct 12nd 2012. It has been rumored that Craig Wright will need to access Tulip Trading Trust assets. Trustee acts in the interest of the beneficiary alone and must defend against undue influence by others. In order to authorize movements of trust assets the beneficiary must come forward and make a direct request of the trustee our way–NOT via 3rd party nor any intermediaries. Any coin movement affecting the trust asset without prior authorization will be considered a trust violation and invalid irrespective of any claim of constructive bailment. The Trust alone has control over its assets. Tampering or manipulating with trust assets by anyone (including the beneficiary) might have material legal and tax implications. Beneficiaries are invited to a conference call 12:00 UTC Friday to discuss interests. Principals only.”

The implications of this message are as follows:
1. * Wright doesn't have the keys, the co-trustee has the keys
1.  Wright wants access to the keys, but the co-trustee is obligated to withhold them from him until 2020
1. therefore, Wright can still make a loan of some kind, that the co trustee could authorize to move funds to his account (possibly even from a specific block ie genesis block funds).
1. Wright could also claim sovereignty of the trust, since it is supposed to revert to his control upon Kliemans death.  

In any case, if all of this is true, there is some kind of power struggle happening behind the scenes surrounding this trust, Wright, the co-trustee, and the beneficiaries of the trust, who could be more than the just wright. 

Also its possible to expect something early Friday morning Eastern time, since the conference call between the beneficiaries is supposed to happen at that time.

But it may be possible that a woman is in control of satoshi's keys. cool. and possibly one of these three woman:

254,"This happened in ancient rome to an extent:

&gt; The drain of gold as a result of a trade deficit, combined with an ever increasing government spending for its standing army and other public works, set up Rome on an uncertain path. Despite of its inability to sufficiently produce state revenues, the empire’s army continued to double in size. Even if emperors are not on a conquest to acquire new territory, it had to maintain its massively expensive standing army which now requires newer weapons and more horses to maintain its edge. The Roman Empire’s inability to pay its legionaries promptly resulted in a loss of confidence and even loyalty of some of its soldiers. Out of this rose a few of Rome’s mortal enemies that were once a loyal soldier or even a general. The skirmish battles as a result of this revolt proved yet another burden on the treasuries of the Empire as it had to replenish lost soldiers and equipment.
&gt; 
&gt; Determined not to repeat this ordeal, emperor Nero devised a way to artificially increase the number of coins to keep up with the expanding government spending. Rome did not have the benefits of a fiat currency as it is under a bi-metallic standard which limits the amount of money that can be minted. **Nero tampered with the coinage by decreasing the silver and gold content of its coins. Reducing the content to as much as 85% increased the monetary base as it allowed more extra coins to be minted as a result of this reduction. A pound of silver that produced 84 Denarii can now be stretched up to 96 pieces of Denarii. Later emperors followed this public deception that allowed them to increase the number of coins to pay for their ballooning government spending. The silver and metallic content reached below 50% during the reign of Lucius Severus as he increased the pay of the Empire’s soldiers hoping to maintain their loyalty. Over a span of 200 years, the silver content on coins went from pure to virtually 1% or even nothing.** This resulted over the years, an increase in prices of goods. Wheat that once sold for 1 Denarius now sold for over 200 Denarii. Even with Rome’s adequate internal income from commerce it is inevitable that it needs new sources of income to support its growing borders and a massive army that no one dares to challenge. 

Naturally, at each stage of devaluation, people in the know would start to horde older coins and trade in new coins for old coins. Once the suckers of larger society caught onto this scheme they stopped trading their old coins for newer ones and started hording these older coins as well. But now the race was on to buy physical assets with these new coins before prices would naturally rise for these items because of the inherent inflation caused by this devaluation of the currency and inflation of the monetary base.

&gt;By utilizing bitcoin’s inbuilt script system to create what he calls a covenant, special transactions can be created to send your bitcoin to a vault, a saving account which requires no banks, no middle men, no intermediary. Unlike normal transactions, this saving account is designed to have a recovery key so that **if your bitcoins are stolen you can use the recovery key to in effect undo any transaction by the hacker.** Thus making theft impossible... 

&gt;...If the hacker manages to steal your recovery key as well as your vault key, a back and forth is possible where he can undo your transaction while you can undo his transaction. Game theory kicks in at this point as either of you can in effect burn the bitcoins, so no one gets the money, greatly reducing the incentives to steal from a vault in the first place as a hacker can expect to not be able to spend the money.",2016-02-27 17:15:06+00:00,d0fxdhj,1.0,t3_47vob3,5459.0,Bitcoin

If you all want to really help out a bitcoin project that truly deserves more support, please check out [chopcoin.io](http://chopcoin.io/account/referral/132)

It's a one of a kind game of skill in which you can win bitcoins in a faucet, or even bet small amounts when playing against others. The developers are paying out of pocket to get the game off the ground so the wider Agar.io community can start playing. Any support for them would be much appreciated, I'm sure. Plus, its a kick ass game that's addicting as hell.

I'll be donating all tips received to their project, which is so far is .077, wow!

Thank you all for the fun! &lt;3Bitcoin

354,"I think I got a little carried away...

but the thing I wanted to convey with satoshi wasn't really the entombment. but more the similarities between the creation of the Blockchain as being comparable to that of the pyramids and the pharaohs who created them. 

Both are virtually indestructible, short of nuclear warfare, and should last for a really long time. 

So in that respect, the name of satoshi will live on inside the blockchain far after you I and everyone else is in the ground.

furthermore. I like to think of Bitcoin as similar to a pyramid in terms of it's security. imagine trying to move the bottom most block at the center of the pyramids of Giza. You can't unless you remove the vast majority of blocks above and around it. this would take months of man power, cranes etc. I like to think of the Genesis block having the same level of security.

So when people say bitcoin is a pyramid scheme, you can say no, it is a pyramid of security. ",2015-12-06 18:03:39+00:00,cxp9i6j,2.0,t1_cxp2re1,14959.0,Bitcoin
355,"&gt; At 1 minute before the end, he was quite far away and I went in the complete opposite direction. He was in middle right side when I saw him, and less than one minute before the end, I was on the outer top left.

its likely that he saw you too at this point and new where you would be by the end of the game by your direction. (I can project into the future where you are going to be roughly based on this alone.)

Once he knew your general direction, and that you couldn't see him anymore, he split as much as possible, for speed, and viewing capability. at the thirty second mark he combines and eats you. 

life man. dog eat dog.

this game isn't a scam, but fundamentally one of skill. there have been people playing for hundreds of hours with instincts honed to the max.

It felt like the old algorithm for determining dots was in place for the round. This threw off my game play a bit, so I would recommend more dots for future tournaments. 

Other then that, it was a lot of fun. Hopefully as people start earning more btc, even more players can play in more expensive tournaments. maybe in a years time we'll get to see massive pot sizes. who knows. fingers crossed.

I ended up coming in like 10th in the first round because I was late to joining, some kind of error in the first minute where it wasnt connecting. so i had to refresh and try again. in the second round i got in the top five by splitkilling in the last minute. all in all i died 13 times and won 26 lives (.026). so basically i doubled my winnings :)",2015-10-18 22:37:44+00:00,cw4hlnc,1.0,t3_3pa4em,316.0,Chopcoin
380,"think of yourself as a cell. you move your cell by using your mouse, and you collect little pieces (dots) to get bigger. but the bigger you get the slower you are. to go faster and accumulate more dots you can split using *space*. You can also eat smaller players to get bigger. But you can also be eaten by bigger players. It's a game of hunting and survival. The biggest wins.

there are some more complex things in the game, like mines. these things act as weapons for the small guys against the bigger guys. if you collide into these mines you will explode into smaller pieces and be more vulnerable to attack. these mines can also be launched against players by pressing (w) which ejects some mass into the mines and makes them activate and launch towards other players. If the launch is successful it explodes another players mass and makes them vulnerable to be eaten by you even though you are smaller.

its a very complex game, even though it looks simple. I recommend trying it out.",2015-10-18 18:32:06+00:00,cw47s1i,2.0,t1_cw47lmk,260.0,Bitcoin

Works exactly like the regular agar.io game.

However, the arenas are much smaller, and will likely expand if their are more players.

I was able to withdraw .02 to my wallet no problem. 

I've also created a subreddit /r/chopcoin and will be posting some video tutorials/games/dates and times for tournaments there.

Description of the fees currently charged in connection with the E-Card is available at help center. Please note that we are not responsible for certain third party fees associated with the E-Card. Such fees are subject to change from time to time. E-Coin will notify you of any such changes but shall not be held responsible for third party fees.

430,"&gt; Now, what if I walked across the border with a private key, stored only in my head, that controlled an address with $1B USD worth of value within?

This is why Bitcoin changes the game. value is now 12 words you have memorized that give you access to your wealth. Anywhere with a internet connection. 

No one can prove or disprove that you have this access without significant and unwarranted use of force. 

This is a public policy problem for governments. Bitcoin has subverted their wealth tracking and restriction capabilities for the time being. An effort will be made to create significant barriers of entry to acquire bitcoin by governments. This can start with small things like, the NYC bitlicense. But it could devolve into further extreme measures, such as confiscation. A similar thing happened to gold owners in the united states in the 1930's, where private gold owners were mandated to hand in their physical gold by the federal government. 

Luckily, governments are usually slow to act, so we have some time until a manufactured headline spurs the masses to take action to save the populace from the evil monster of crytpocurrency.

can anyone verify the following impression I'm getting?

1. Blocksize testing happens - oh look that's an issue

2. Bitcoin core sits on their asses

3. Gaven + Mike team up to try and light a fire under their asses to fix this issue before it becomes a problem by introducing XT. 


The problem I have with this is that I can see the Bitcoin core perspective as more valid then what Is trying to be done with XT. First of all, the blocksize issue doesn't appear to be an imminent threat causing mass devastation/interruption. Though I agree it could. evidence of this was seen with the stress tests causing backlogs of blocks, raising fees, unconfirmed blocks TEMPORARILY.

this was artificial traffic bought with a price. we aren't at a place yet were the network vitally NEEDS an upgrade due to natural traffic. But, we will be.

With that said, I think choosing XT RIGHT NOW and the risks associated with that kind of choice are greater then the risks associated with waiting for the Bitcoin core devs to implement a solution that everyone can agree on. We have time is what I'm trying to say.

And until there is an actual prolonged distribution in service that causes doubt, XT will remain a choice of last resort, for me (currently. please try and change my mind), and others I'm sure.

Now my hope is that Gavin and Mikes intentions with XT are to try and motivate the core team to do something, not to make an alternative Bitcoin where there is less decentralization where they become king makers. 

If the first intention is true, then I can see its merit from a Machiavellian perspective. But this isn't Florence, this is bitcoin. going rogue and injecting that kind of energy into the space should only be done as a last resort. And perhaps it has and is.

That's my layman analysis.

If the first intention is true, then I can see its merit from a Machiavellian perspective. But this isn't Florence, this is bitcoin. going rogue and injecting that kind of energy into the space should only be done as a last resort. And perhaps it has and is.

That's my layman analysis.

497,"I posted this exact story yesterday, so permit me to reuse it here.

&gt; This is my story on how I earned my first Bitcoin, and what I learned along the way. In December of 2013 I downloaded Bitcoin-QT after hearing about the meteoric rise of Bitcoin. At the time the price was in correction from the all time high of 1163 and was at 651. I had missed the train.		
&gt; At this time I started to visit r/Bitcoin more. I didn’t understand a thing I was reading. It’s like I stumbled across another language, with so many references to concepts that were completely foreign to me. I am by no means a computer expert. My competence level is average.
&gt; 
&gt; The highly technical language used in this sub and in the Bitcoin spaces is a barrier of entry to non-tech savvy individuals. But it is also an attraction for people who have a thirst for knowledge. And once you understand the technical side of Bitcoin it becomes more attractive. By its very nature Bitcoin is a self sustaining unit of account that is incorruptibly honest. Reading those words is entirely different from understanding what they mean. And once you do understand what they mean, what Bitcoin means, Attraction Amplified. So after lurking for a while and learning the basics, I came to this simple conclusion. I wanted it. But I honestly couldn't justify out right buying it.
&gt; 
&gt; So I set myself a goal. I’ll try earning just .1 bitcoin. Looking back, this took me way too long because I sticked with the faucets and paytoclick sites for way too long. But once I got go my first .1 BTC in February of 2015 I set myself a new goal. To earn one Bitcoin. My first Bitcoin wasn’t going to be mined or bought, but Earned. And 5 months latter I achieved that goal. By doing this I learned so much about the Bitcoin ecosystem.  
&gt; 
&gt; ***Chart of earnings over time. Blue is earnings per day. Red is total earnings over time.***
&gt; 
&gt; http://i.imgur.com/Y6cgH5z.png
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; The first thing I learned was that faucets are a huge waste of time for earning Bitcoin. But they’re nice to begin with just to get a feel for the mechanics of transactions.
&gt; 
&gt; The second thing I learned was that I could earn on average around 1500bits per day using Bitcoinget to do small online tasks, like visiting sites or doing short surveys. But, I have a love hate relationship with Bitcoinget. On the one hand, I’ve earned a good amount with them. But on the other hand, their jobs suck balls. The majority of the tasks on their site are not worth the time to complete, and many don’t work properly. The key is to know which tasks are worth doing and which are not. One in ten tasks on Bitcoinget are worth doing, and that’s being generous. But by using Bitcoinget I was able secure a steady supply of Bitcoin. Shameless Referral link if anyone feels like signing up: http://www.bitcoinget.com/?r=1MienR4vFattHj6XSZjKjDiwDqgxGeq67n
&gt;  
&gt; ***Chart for how much Bitcoinget and the other earning methods contributed as a percent to the 1 BTC goal.***
&gt; http://i.imgur.com/4qj2S82.png
&gt; 
&gt; The third method I learned for earning Bitcoin was giveaways. Changetip and sign up bonuses from sites like circle were very lucrative for the time spent on singing up. Just by visiting r/Bitcoin regularly you can get a fair amount of Bitcoin through giveaways. 
&gt; 
&gt; The fourth method for earning BTC, and the most profitable, was using r/Jobs4bitcoins. My first job I took for this method was video editing for some kind of school project/feminist propaganda. The second job I took from Jobs4bitcoins was a excel research project, finding the smart phone penetration rates throughout Africa. This last job tipped me over the edge of .95BTC to 1.25BTC. Both jobs paid quite fairly for the task involved. Protip: never submit work before receiving payment first/use an escrow service.
&gt; 
&gt; Jobs4Bitcoin is hands down going to grow into something more. There is huge potential for people around the world to connect with someone else with the skills they need for quick work. Bitcoin enables this seamlessly and empowers individuals to pick and choose their work for themselves. So, shameless plus #2, if you need someone who is good at excel/researching literature/synthesizing large amounts of data, I’m your guy. Video editing too!
&gt; 
&gt; Along the way I’ve learned the Bitcoin lingo, set up multiple wallets using Armory, Electrum and Mycelium. I discovered the wonderful world of multi-sig addresses, and the benefits they offer for security. I’ve also learned how to store the backups for these in exotic offline devices like calculators and digital cameras. I’ve even attended a Bitcoin ATM release event, Cool stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; **Conclusion:** Bitcoin is simply amazing and amazingly simple in its simplicity. Overall it’s been a fun experiment, and I’m glad I did it, but this is definitely not a method for everyone. Buying from an exchange or ATM is much faster to acquire BTC. This is why I’ve joined an exchange and plan on buying some more BTC. 	
&gt; 
&gt; My new goal is 2.1 BTC, but I don’t think I’ll be satisfied until that coveted 21 BTC mark. 1 in 10 million here I come, 1 in a million one day soon. Maybe one day when we’re all grey and weary with the years of Bitcoin reaching planet after planet past the moon, I’ll tell my great-great-great-grandchildren that I earned my first Bitcoin. And they’ll either ask me, “what’s a Bight-coin?” or stare at me in silent wonder. I don't know where Bitcoin is going. But I do know that I want it. Other people want it. And there's only ever going to be 21 million.
