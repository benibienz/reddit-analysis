I'm going to be an uncle soon an I wanted to get my niece something special that would last her a long time. So I came up with an idea to give her Bitcoin that would be secure for her to access when she would be old enough to know what money’s are, and that would inspire her to learn about what bitcoin/money is.

Anyone can do what I did you just need

&gt;a pregnant family member

&gt;a creative idea

&gt;One sturdy metal [Noah’s ark piggy bank
](http://www.thingsengraved.ca/Product/noah-s-ark-bank/010606)

&gt;a copy of [tails operating system](https://tails.boum.org/) on a bootable DVD

&gt;boot tails on an device without an internet connection

&gt;create an electrum wallet

&gt;copy down the seed on a piece of paper

&gt;copy down one of the public addresses on paper

&gt;copy down the private key of that public address just in case

&gt;destroy tails boot DVD

&gt;keep piece of paper in secure location as a backup

&gt;engrave the public address on the Noah’s ark piggy bank

&gt;engrave the seed in a coherent riddle story format on the piggy bank

&gt;wait 20 years for Bitcoin to go to the moon 

&gt;use greed to force her to learn about Bitcoin to figure out the correct seed words from the riddle to access her funds


My question is, would this work and would the level of security be reasonable for her funds. My main concern is that I I've created a bitcoin wallet using electrum, but never connected to the network/internet to verify that I can send/receive/have funds in the corresponding public address.
Thank you for your feedback, I will update with the final product in the coming weeks.

thought i'd start a post about the new happenings on our favorite game.

it looks like the developers are having some fun and are finally experimenting a little with the game play. and i say, its about time!

so far the current turbo game mode is excellerated combining within 8 second of spliting. personally i love this game mode. i just fly into mines and recombine shortly. its great for collecting and killing.

the other previous turbo game mode was 2X speed. this was super fast lighting movement and recombination within 15 seconds. made things extra interesting and chaotic, which i love.

all in all, i love that the devs are playing with the game! keep it up! what do you all think of the new experiments? what kind of game modes would you like to see?

me personally: i'd like to see powerups sprinkled randomly through the playground, kinda like mines, but for 2X speed or 3X recombenation, or worse a mine! so it can be a mystery box, where you can get one of these three, but you dont know which, and you have an equal chance of getting either!!!

other idea, maybe for way in the future: a playground that has a que where there is an unlimited bitcoin bet amount. players only start when at least two agree to a set bet minimum thats up to the first better to set (unlimited range).

53,2015-07-04 01:05:35+00:00,self.Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3c21lf/story_how_i_earned_my_first_bitcoin/,,"Re-posting this because it's a good story :P

&gt; This is my story on how I earned my first Bitcoin, and what I learned along the way. In December of 2013 I downloaded Bitcoin-QT after hearing about the meteoric rise of Bitcoin. At the time the price was in correction from the all time high of 1163 and was at 651. I had missed the train.		
&gt; At this time I started to visit r/Bitcoin more. I didn’t understand a thing I was reading. It’s like I stumbled across another language, with so many references to concepts that were completely foreign to me. I am by no means a computer expert. My competence level is average.
&gt; 
&gt; The highly technical language used in this sub and in the Bitcoin spaces is a barrier of entry to non-tech savvy individuals. But it is also an attraction for people who have a thirst for knowledge. And once you understand the technical side of Bitcoin it becomes more attractive. By its very nature Bitcoin is a self sustaining unit of account that is incorruptibly honest. Reading those words is entirely different from understanding what they mean. And once you do understand what they mean, what Bitcoin means, Attraction Amplified. So after lurking for a while and learning the basics, I came to this simple conclusion. I wanted it. But I honestly couldn't justify out right buying it.
&gt; 
&gt; So I set myself a goal. I’ll try earning just .1 bitcoin. Looking back, this took me way too long because I sticked with the faucets and paytoclick sites for way too long. But once I got go my first .1 BTC in February of 2015 I set myself a new goal. To earn one Bitcoin. My first Bitcoin wasn’t going to be mined or bought, but Earned. And 5 months latter I achieved that goal. By doing this I learned so much about the Bitcoin ecosystem.  
&gt; 
&gt; ***Chart of earnings over time. Blue is earnings per day. Red is total earnings over time.***
&gt; 
&gt; http://i.imgur.com/Y6cgH5z.png
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; The first thing I learned was that faucets are a huge waste of time for earning Bitcoin. But they’re nice to begin with just to get a feel for the mechanics of transactions.
&gt; 
&gt; The second thing I learned was that I could earn on average around 1500bits per day using Bitcoinget to do small online tasks, like visiting sites or doing short surveys. But, I have a love hate relationship with Bitcoinget. On the one hand, I’ve earned a good amount with them. But on the other hand, their jobs suck balls. The majority of the tasks on their site are not worth the time to complete, and many don’t work properly. The key is to know which tasks are worth doing and which are not. One in ten tasks on Bitcoinget are worth doing, and that’s being generous. But by using Bitcoinget I was able secure a steady supply of Bitcoin.

&gt;  
&gt; ***Chart for how much Bitcoinget and the other earning methods contributed as a percent to the 1 BTC goal.***
&gt; http://i.imgur.com/4qj2S82.png
&gt; 
&gt; The third method I learned for earning Bitcoin was giveaways. Changetip and sign up bonuses from sites like circle were very lucrative for the time spent on singing up. Just by visiting r/Bitcoin regularly you can get a fair amount of Bitcoin through giveaways. 
&gt; 
&gt; The fourth method for earning BTC, and the most profitable, was using r/Jobs4bitcoins. My first job I took for this method was video editing for some kind of school project/feminist propaganda. The second job I took from Jobs4bitcoins was a excel research project, finding the smart phone penetration rates throughout Africa. This last job tipped me over the edge of .95BTC to 1.25BTC. Both jobs paid quite fairly for the task involved. Protip: never submit work before receiving payment first/use an escrow service.
&gt;

&gt; Along the way I’ve learned the Bitcoin lingo, set up multiple wallets using Armory, Electrum and Mycelium. I discovered the wonderful world of multi-sig addresses, and the benefits they offer for security. I’ve also learned how to store the backups for these in exotic offline devices like calculators and digital cameras. I’ve even attended a Bitcoin ATM release event, Cool stuff.

&gt; **Conclusion:** Bitcoin is simply amazing and amazingly simple in its simplicity. Overall it’s been a fun experiment, and I’m glad I did it, but this is definitely not a method for everyone. Buying from an exchange or ATM is much faster to acquire BTC. This is why I’ve joined an exchange and plan on buying some more BTC. 	
&gt; 
&gt; My new goal is 2.1 BTC, but I don’t think I’ll be satisfied until that coveted 21 BTC mark. 1 in 10 million here I come, 1 in a million one day soon. Maybe one day when we’re all grey and weary with the years of Bitcoin reaching planet after planet past the moon, I’ll tell my great-great-great-grandchildren that I earned my first Bitcoin. And they’ll either ask me, “what’s a Bight-coin?” or stare at me in silent wonder. I don't know where Bitcoin is going. But I do know that I want it. Other people want it. And there's only ever going to be 21 million.

I just used it today for a hotel booking for a friends bachelor party in a couple weeks and got 183 bits per dollar. which is a nice 15 dollars off/return in BTC.

not bad, but I haven't yet received these BTC yet and apparently it does take some time. So I'll report back when/if I receive them and give everyone a review. 

Moral of the story, you might as well start off on this site if you are already going to buy something.

55,2015-06-20 20:27:26+00:00,self.Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3ajiss/experiment_earning_my_first_bitcoin/,,"This is my story on how I earned my first Bitcoin, and what I learned along the way. In December of 2013 I downloaded Bitcoin-QT after hearing about the meteoric rise of Bitcoin. At the time the price was in correction from the all time high of 1163 and was at 651. I had missed the train.		
At this time I started to visit r/Bitcoin more. I didn’t understand a thing I was reading. It’s like I stumbled across another language, with so many references to concepts that were completely foreign to me. I am by no means a computer expert. My competence level is average.

The highly technical language used in this sub and in the Bitcoin spaces is a barrier of entry to non-tech savvy individuals. But it is also an attraction for people who have a thirst for knowledge. And once you understand the technical side of Bitcoin it becomes more attractive. By its very nature Bitcoin is a self sustaining unit of account that is incorruptibly honest. Reading those words is entirely different from understanding what they mean. And once you do understand what they mean, what Bitcoin means, Attraction Amplified. So after lurking for a while and learning the basics, I came to this simple conclusion. I wanted it. But I honestly couldn't justify out right buying it.

So I set myself a goal. I’ll try earning just .1 bitcoin. Looking back, this took me way too long because I sticked with the faucets and paytoclick sites for way too long. But once I got go my first .1 BTC in February of 2015 I set myself a new goal. To earn one Bitcoin. My first Bitcoin wasn’t going to be mined or bought, but Earned. And 5 months latter I achieved that goal. By doing this I learned so much about the Bitcoin ecosystem.

The first thing I learned was that faucets are a huge waste of time for earning Bitcoin. But they’re nice to begin with just to get a feel for the mechanics of transactions.

The second thing I learned was that I could earn on average around 1500bits per day using Bitcoinget to do small online tasks, like visiting sites or doing short surveys. But, I have a love hate relationship with Bitcoinget. On the one hand, I’ve earned a good amount with them. But on the other hand, their jobs suck balls. The majority of the tasks on their site are not worth the time to complete, and many don’t work properly. The key is to know which tasks are worth doing and which are not. One in ten tasks on Bitcoinget are worth doing, and that’s being generous. But by using Bitcoinget I was able secure a steady supply of Bitcoin.

The third method I learned for earning Bitcoin was giveaways. Changetip and sign up bonuses from sites like circle were very lucrative for the time spent on singing up. Just by visiting r/Bitcoin regularly you can get a fair amount of Bitcoin through giveaways. 

The fourth method for earning BTC, and the most profitable, was using r/Jobs4bitcoins. My first job I took for this method was video editing for some kind of school project/feminist propaganda. The second job I took from Jobs4bitcoins was a excel research project, finding the smart phone penetration rates throughout Africa. This last job tipped me over the edge of .95BTC to 1.25BTC. Both jobs paid quite fairly for the task involved. Protip: never submit work before receiving payment first/use an escrow service.
