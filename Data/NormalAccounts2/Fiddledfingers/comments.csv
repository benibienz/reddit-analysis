95,"I had trouble with this as well for quite a long time. The trick is making sure you land your sweet spot SHFF Nair as closely as possible to your opponent. And it's easiest to do this around 10-18% on most characters. Also more practical because it isn't going to be the first thing you throw out in a match. 

When you land the Nair, I like to push the left analog stick over with some force, not like slamming it, but really make sure greninja is moving forward. A lot of the time I miss this is because I held forward to softly so greninja did not get above the opponent in time to footstool. When inputting the foot stool make sure that you double tap jump quickly! I use the tip of my thump on the Y button opposed to resting it flat. 

A lot of the time it fails is because you were not getting greninja moving forward quick enough, you really gotta make sure he's moving forward or it won't work. 

Practice on Corrin, Yoshi, Mario, Shiek, different %'s work the best for different weight classes. 

It's also easier to perform this at low percents from a running Nair, so you have some momentum carrying you forward. 

As for Up air spike, make sure that you are waiting until you are past the apex of your jump to input U air and then fast fall, you can still drag them down with you if you mess the time up slightly but for the best spike you want just the first hit to connect.

I have Z for special so that I can do a grounded wave bounce with neutral Special by holding the L stick one direction and flicking the C stick in the opposite direction and hitting Z at the same time. And my jump on L trigger is for Up B out of shield on other characters that I play, as well as the occasional D air out of shield with greninja but I don't get that much bc of his sliding when getting hit on shield.

115,"It's mainly just another movement option, if you jump one direction and then move your stick in the opposite and hold it, you'll land and slide.

I think there was a video with a tutorial and a better explanation posted to this sub awhile back. 

While I'm talking about movement options; make sure you practice b reversing and wavebouncing as well with his neutral b, I also like using a grounded wave bounce neutral b for a retreating shuriken.

146,"Two years ago I woke up, stranded without a working phone and only one shoe, in a foreign country. 


I was visiting a friend in Munich for the Oktoberfest (I'm American) I had left my bag which had all my belongings in his car which we had parked at his friends place downtown. Prior to going to the Oktoberfest I had not been to my friend's place yet so I had no idea where he lived. Despite promising each other we wouldn't lose each other, we had a few too many drinks at some bars after the Oktoberfest. I vaguely remember some guy in a horse mask buying me some shots and entering what looked like a mansion that had been turned into a party house with each room being a different bar. 

I woke up in the morning, or came back to consciousness, walking down the street. My phone was dead (no service anyway) and my friend was gone. One of my shoes was also gone, which I found out after stepping into a puddle. After a few hours of walking around looking like a homeless man, and asking confused Germans to use their phone, (none said yes) I found a really nice young couple around my age who were dressed and going to the festival that morning. They gave me some food and suggested I go back to the festival seeing as how many people go there early and my friend might be there looking for me. I ended up going to the security station there in the festival and explaining my situation to the guy behind the counter, he laughed his ass off and said that it happens more than I would think. Luckily one of the girls working there had the same phone as me (curse you iPhone 5 lightning chargers) and I got to charge my phone. I was able to get my friends number from my contacts and use their phone to call him. 

Several tries later he finally picked up and gave me his address. I got a cab and after a hilarious can drive to his apartment he greeted me outside. Where he immediately fell on the ground laughing at my missing shoe. Apparently he had gotten to drunk and lost me and ended up taking the wrong train home to a completely different side of town. We went inside and slept for the rest of the day.

Although a lot of this video I didn't agree with as being broken, (the grab, nair end lag, shadow sneak not being an immediate hit box, crappy counter) some of this stuff is really jank. The hit boxes on greninja's smash attacks are really bad. I can't count the number of times I have had a good read just for the opponent to be 'too close' to hit with the attack...and I end up getting punished. 
The hit box on his falling Nair is also very frustrating. You are clearly hitting the opponent and the animation comes out and even finishes but no hit box comes out. You have to be careful with your FF Nairs because of this whereas I'm not aware of other characters that have a problem exactly like this. 
Also, the very last segment of the video shows something that has been very frustrating for me. Smacking backwards into the ledge and flailing helplessly to your death is so frustrating. You are able to side b and do regular attacks after flailing about. But you are not able to perform an Up B again. It happens when you are recovering closer to the ledge and your back is facing the corner, but also it seems to happen randomly.
