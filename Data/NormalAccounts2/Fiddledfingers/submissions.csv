How the hell do you guys play against competent Fox players? 

Istudying makes the MU look almost even but I get bodied by fox almost every time. His aerials seem unpublishable on landing and his dash attack comes out so quick. Sure I can abuse shield but I can't shield grab any of his moves because of his great frame data into jab and u tilt. 

I can do the ol' f-throw water shuriken into hydro pump gimp and get a somewhat early kill but the neutral is just completely dominated by fox.

I don't know how to punish his rush down game if I can't use shield, and my Fair doesn't out space him that well. 

Any tips would be appreciated. I consider this the worst MU on the roster and it has made me strongly consider a pocket character against Fox. ",GreninjaMains,Getting bodied by Fox constantly,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreninjaMains/comments/4qshmc/getting_bodied_by_fox_constantly/

I am really into following the competitive smash bros scene. For all games. I watch whatever tourneys I can and keep up to date with the news and of course have favorite players. My problem is that I can't seem to get into the community aspect. 

I haven't ever been to a tournament, I really want to go I just always have to work evenings so it's hard to make it to even locals... But anyway, I have gone to a smash fest before. I just felt weird having people introduce themselves to me as their tag and having to come up with one myself. I would rather use people's real names. And i can't imagine getting more into the community and having friends whom I refer to as their tags even when we are just hanging and playing smash, I've seen lots of people do this in their streams... It just seems strange to me, I guess? 

Does anyone else feel like this? How did you get used too it? I am moving in a few months to an area with a larger scene and am going to have a new job which allows me to attend tourney, and

I am going to be graduating next spring from college with a degree in Poli  sci and Philosophy and I have been doing some job searching online for state government jobs in Austin. I am from Michigan and plan on flying down to Texas to visit family in Houston but while I am down there I would really like to use a few days to do some networking in Austin. I am going to bring plenty of copies of my resume with me. 

My question is; what resources, websites, etc should I use in my job search in Austin? I would like to email some offices, organizations, and companies before I am down there. I am particularly interested in working for the state or a government organization as that is where most of my experience is. But, I am open to anything! 
As for walking around...where would the best areas be for meeting potential employers? 

I just want to be as prepared as possible to make the most of my time there. I will be in Texas for 2 weeks. I have done a lot of job searching here in MI but if I had the chance to move out of state I would love too, and this is one place I am looking!

Thank you for any advice you can give! ",Austin,Job searching in Austin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/3cb3xh/job_searching_in_austin/

I have never been to a tourney before but I play smash 4 a few hours a week and would like to start getting involved with the local scene. But idk where to start. 

I live in Kalamazoo, MI but I can drive an hour or two if need be. I know I'll get my ass handed to me my first tournament but I want to make connections and practice partners. Cause I have noticed that my online play is much different than when I play on the weekend with my friends (but they are not competitive about the game at all so not much help) 

Anyway, as the title says, are there any local tournaments in my area? 
Btw I do not use facebook
