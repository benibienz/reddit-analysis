You have to install the color profile as well as change some of the sliders. The color profile goes deeper than just moving the sliders around. They actually adjusted the levels of the individual color channels which you can't do in camera. You will need to install the canon software which is on the disc that comes with the camera. You can download that from canon now though which is great. Then google the color profile settings and that will tell you how to place the sliders.

60,"You're right, this isn't always true. But, there is also different qualities of noise. Some sensor noise even allows you to see scan line of the sensor. Which you don't want. Noise also is directly correlated to heat. As a sensor gets warmer you see more noise. I personally like the noise on some high quality image sensors. Supposedly when we reach 9K digital camera sensors, that's when we start seeing incredible similarities in digital and the look of film. I can already see it happening now. But most people won't be able to tell the difference between the mediums when comparing film to a 9K image.
