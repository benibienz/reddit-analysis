Sadly though I have never really felt that spark everyone talks about. For a while now I've been trying the online dating thing with no luck.
A week or two ago I got matched on tinder with one of the most beautiful girls I've ever seen. She actually messages me first and we talked for a few days. We finally meet up and have a drink. It wasn't very long into the night that I can clearly see that this girl is something special. After the bar we walked around for quite some time and just talked.

She tells me that 4 months ago she got out of a relationship with an alcoholic guy so she doesn't know what she wants right now. I'm disappointed at this because I am truly ready for something but we continue to chat.
I've never been able to talk to someone so easily. I almost couldn't even recognize my self. It was the most refreshing thing I've ever felt. So, we happen to stumble down an alley and she looks over and tells me she wants me to kiss her. I don't hesitate. Things got heated and we decided to go to my place. Before hand I told her I have weed paraphernalia out and I hope she's okay with it. She didn't mind.

We arrive and more things happen.. After the abundant sex we talked for hours on end about some of the most deep and complex thoughts I've ever spoken about. I've never connected with someone on this level.
The next night she makes it clear that she wants to come over and relax with me before I go to work. She arrives and we immediately have sex, of course. Then lay on my floor speaking for another few hours.

That morning I went to work and finished the day no problem. Then she texted me telling me she wanted to talk. I called her immediately when I got home and she told me that she doesn't want to be in a relationship with someone who smokes pot. Her ex had an alcohol problem and she doesn't want to constantly think I'm stoned.

I told her I'd quit and it's not a problem. I truly would. She said she doesn't want to change me after only knowing me two days. I get it. So we agreed it's best we don't talk.

It has now been 2 days. I don't know what it is but this girl is beautiful in every way and I can't lose her. I don't think my life could get better. She made me feel like I was living in a real life movie for those two days. Her personality and energy was sheer magic and we had real chemistry.

I feel I have to text her and ask to speak in person. But I also don't know. I have to take her feelings into account. I just don't know what to do. I feel like I'm going crazy over this and it's telling me that this is serious. I really really really like this girl and I already know that I could love her.
I feel she fell for me equally as hard as I have fallen for her based on conversation. I think she's just scared and I get it..

Do I text her? When? How long do I wait? I just feel like I'd be giving up if I don't try harder. But at what point is it foolish?
