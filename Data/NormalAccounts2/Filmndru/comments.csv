16,"Hi, i'm not getting upset, I couldn't really care less except for not wanting to rip anyone off. A main motivation to sell them is that they could be getting used by someone.
As they are, they work, though I miss the use of the fx but I don't have an fx mixer with my 800mk2's and don't mind clean mixing. I'm probably not a very good judge looking at it from this angle as, to most and the actual main selling point of these units means, the fx are probably pretty integral.

I'm assuming the djm600 but is there any other mixers that jump to your mind that go well with my newer (still old) cdj's?

I'm not far off the mark though either, right?

http://www.ebay.co.uk/bhp/pioneer-cdj-200

With them prices as a guide, which I know are just 'buy it nows,' what do you think they'd be worth as spares? It's really not a case of wanting to scrape every penny I can get out of them, I simply want to be fair about it as I remember being excited about getting my first 1210 mk2's in knackered shape but completely deluded into buying them because they were literally the only pair I could get after trying to get some for months. Obviously these are much more postage friendly where as nobody at the time were doing this with technics so the rash purchase was down to collection only issues. However, I've seen this same delusion in a lad on a FB group who is just excited about getting into mixing just like I was with getting my first direct drives. He was basically ready to pay anything for them, couldn't have them quick enough lol and that's why I wanted to be sure.

What can I say? I'm a sucker for being duped, no matter how long I look into something or watch ebay etc. I always end up getting screwed somehow and at that exact moment you realise you've been had, it ain't nice so I wanted to avoid unintentionally causing that for someone else, they could be the next big thing and they're put off right from the start lol.

I can be an idiot and clearly overthink things way too much and often come across poorly so thanks for the help and ¬£50 for the pair it is then. Got an old vmx200 mixer laying around so with that also thrown in it could make up a very cheap beginners set. What would you recommend to add on? Or would this bring the price down further haha?

Cheers again, I'll admit I was a little sore on the low value too though.

Edit: I Just realised I'm literally just asking you a series of questions in this wall of text which aren't regarding my original post, apologies.",2016-11-01 08:43:10+00:00,d9gl0s8,,t1_d9cjcba,,DJs
17,"Sorry if I wasn't clear. I always use a basic anti-bacterial solution sprayed onto a micro fibre cloth. Someone else in the house had bought a citrus scented kitchen/bathroom cleaner which was by chance the same brand and in all honesty, although the bottles were absolutely identical except for the small label indicating what they were, it was a balls up of epic proportions on my part. Nothing new for me lol!
It was when the citrus scent hit me it sank in so I grabbed the other micro fibre I used for dry wiping dust off of the units to wipe them down and get off as much kitchen/bathroom spray as possible and a couple hours later both cdj's started with the problem. I can't see what else it could've been and as usual only a small amount was sprayed onto the cloth first. So, it's okay to just directly spritz cleaner on cdj's then, obviously unplugged?
 
Like I said, I had the covers off and took a good look at the tact switches and the board and they all seemed clean as a whistle but at this point I'd not much left to lose so tried electrical cleaner; and at a later time, air duster which, if you're getting the theme of my life, of course came out as a fluid, it's proppelant, because the can was faulty.

Must say though, the air duster which was replaced by amazon, followed by the electrical cleaner does seem to remedy the problem. This is very temporary though which just raises more questions really. As short as a matter of hours before the problem returns.

As you pointed out it seems like something was directly spilled onto them but with this definitely not being the case the cleaner couldn't have gotten very far inside so I assume it's an issue with the board directly under the tact switches. Any idea what this is called? Could it literally just be the tact switches need replacing or if they look good they're good?

Still annoys me as I quite liked the Jet effect but often as you're turning the dial in time with the mix it'll swap to zip which, well, you can imagine lol.

Thanks for your time.

58,"Are you me?

I just suddenly realised like mid feb i hadn't had a dump since the night after star wars came out! Wasn't eating basically though so in my addled mind I wasn't too worried. Got a home enema kit and that's what started it all off! Yeah I'm with you on the latex gloves but had to find out the hard way that even if you're a nail biter they're never short enough to stop a smell getting trapped there for 50 washes xD suppositories also did feck all and I nearly killed myself by making a saline solution. Had to be pure sea salt or something and ended up emailing the brand of salt I'd bought and they promised me it was, so i drank the solution and started tripping out. Don't know if it was all the toxins in that Iron Man suit metal style shite being released or what but when I came to I emailed again with the response ""Well if I knew you were going to do that with it!""
Worst part was when you'd started going but wanted to stop and your muscles kept going for it, complete loss of control and yet the slowly trying to figure out where the end of your pap is with your finger or whether you need to break it off is actually a luxury after what you've just been through.
So I've heard of this coffee thing but I assumed it was the new fkin atkins diet or something, what's the down low on it (pun intended)? Instead of the suppositories I eventually found that just shoving some petroleum jelly (not the water based lube that comes with the enema kit that just wipes off after one plop) up the emergency exit half an hour prior really helped.

A song in memorandum of our excruciating suffrage.

When I started 4f-mph I genuinely forgot to take my painkillers for about 2 months, unfortunately as the 4f-mph started to lessen it's effect on me I found that taking the dihydrocodeine and, when I ran out before my refill, kratom boosted the serotonergic effects again quite nicely. I'm epileptic btw and this did not trigger any seizures nor absences, infac, the most epilepsy free I've ever been were them nice months before the ban.

Having said all this I don't recommend any of this and would strongly recommend waiting for as many replies as possible before even beginning to start making a decision. I'm talking from experience and my findings could be very unusual i.e. should've been fatal. Careful with the mph though, you may prefer 4f-eph, different doses for different people but there is an awful jittery, sometimes, peripheral shadow people stage. I managed to beat this with 0.5 mg pyrazolam but can you see where this escalates?

91,"Hi, noticed this had been up voted so thought I'd follow up with a quick TR.

First off, I have spent the best part of this year abusing 4f-mph and for a month or so before that, MPA. I'm not always like this but, let's say I was having a hard time and didn't deal with it very well, like at all. I understand 4f-mph to be a norinephrine re-uptake inhibitor so don't think this would effect the trip but I had taken some 3-FPM for a few days before it, as well as trying Phet which is, IMHO, a waste of time and money. So, to the point then!

I received 3 of these for ¬£30 and noticed they were very brittle and remembered that the doves I took back in the day were this way too though the doves seemed twice as thick, like they were a big mac, these a happy-meal burger. Other than what I've mentioned my experience is high with drugs that are primarily serotonergic i.e. Cathinones such as 4mmc (mcat) or the main one ofcourse, MDMA, they are my chem of choice. However, until this recent year I have not touched anything beyond the odd J in roughly 5 years, the last thing I took, what were being nicknamed at the time, Super-pills which were a tenner and were just okay ( I see where I thought these were a good idea now.)

I decided to play it cautiously and took only one. There was no rush or come up at all really but after taking a shower I did notice I was a bit 'up' but no real extra empathy and I had actually planned to play on my decks but looking at them was tiring to be honest, as was music, I actually just sat trying to decide what to do. Not long after this a very bad comedown hit, it drove me to stick the second 'comedown pill' under my tongue and once that had dissolved I took the last along with it. Following this I drank, smoked and did basically anything to try and escape this, I mean I've had more comedowns than any one person should really have but this was plain old hell (though them doves, possibly london doves or am-hi-co, never did so the theory of bullshit pills and comedowns I tend to support.) To give you an idea of how quick this happened it was roughly 9pm that I took the first one and about 10.15 when I panic dosed the other two which just fed the decent. This nightmarish chapter lasted until about 11:30 am but everytime I had a remotely pleasant thought I felt the little serotonin I had longingly regained drain away. Sleep did not come until about 4pm that day which was brought on desperately (thought it still fought back) by half a ridiculously strong hypnotic rc benzo called Flubromazolam (zolam, not pam) which no one should ever take, not even a warning yawn usually and if you're curious further you'll see that google searches of it tend to be horror stories. Still took a while to drift off. 2 and a half hours later I woke up wired and still monumentally down. After forcing some food down an hour later I went out again, this time unaided, but only till about 11pm where I knew I'd gotten all I'd get. Of course I was up all night again, pretty lonely on a comedown too.

So, oh what a night that was. It's very possible, hell, probable that the 3-FPM and Phet had already set about depleting my serotonin but I had noticed that the 4F-MPH didn't even give me the slightest of euphoria anymore either, just angst ridden jitters so maybe my body was simply all out of happiness. But, does anyone really want to chance that after what I've said? As obvious it may be that it was caused by prior tolerance, Doves I would use on a nightly basis, sometimes up to a week or more at a time and they just barely worked towards the end, no comedown, again supporting the bullshit pills theory as I'd be left with an okay afterglow actually. This is not supposed to be encouraging to anyone or the opposite, this is simply about being safe, sensible and sharing experiences, especially bad ones (though best not to risk having them) in which, as I received no replies, I took it upon myself to retrieve this knowledge for the greater good, or something like that lol. Use my behaviour mentioned as a guide and just do the opposite lol, not just regarding the pills that led to my previous worsed comedown being times by a hundred but in general. If anyone has actually had a positive roll with these I'd be interested to hear about it but I'd honestly not even consider it guys and there's no excuse because these now have a TR!

Stay safe. Cheers for reading.

After pre-ordering a few times and having been disappointed I've given that up unless it is expected to sell out with no re-issue (but then it would probably be on vinyl anyway) not to bash them as the album is genius but Horsepower Productions - Crooks, Crime and Corruption is the best example to date, a white cover with physical tacky police tape wrapped around randomly which was naturally peeling and gathering dust where the tapes underside was exposed, all by it's time of delivery :/ and then there are those vinyls **and** CD's that have a plain sleeve, the worst being paper.

I'm with you on the space dilemma though, in fact it's a crisis really. I bought a 4 per page 120 CD wallet from amazon basics and I'm surprised how quickly the swapping out of less used CD's comes around lol! I'm considering one of the cases with cue cards in the lid as it'll be easier to flick through, I do actually use bpm, key etc. Anyway and even if I do not continue to buy actual tangible copies I'm going to need space anyway for the burns, any thoughts? There's problems with the new age method too though, a certain purchase/download site won't let me download an album I've paid for unless i want each track cut into pieces and so far I've had no reply from them ‡≤†_‡≤†

94,"Thanks! Yeah, I thought so. So not losing much quality if any then. I've been checking to see if an albums audio cd is a similar price to it's wav downloads and if so going ahead with the physical album even though the odd time the download wav is slightly higher in bitrate. I always rip them and burn them to two blank verbatim azo discs anyway for mixing but just seems to me if you can wait a day and its around the same price you might as well have a physical copy right?

Don't know when and in what state I was in when I added him, or how I found him by his real name for that matter but anyway, I asked him if it was really him lol? It's like he was a little ticked by that and after going out of his way to prove it, not that I doubted him, he just started talking about music and Japan, genuinely wanting to hear what I had to say, my opinions on the Dub scene and what's happened to it like my opinions were worth a damn lmao and yeah, good few hours we just talked tunes! Has to be one of the most chill, humble producers out there, no kidding and he knows his stuff too, i think i convincingly winged it haha xD

Out of curiosity what is the best way to burn flac, player compatabilities and what not out the window ofcourse, also what is the best quality flac file?

I know i rip everything in 44,100 16-bit and burn it that way too except for some lossless downloads which get burnt however they are which is usually somewhere above 44,100 and i think I've seen 24-bit.

114,"Yeah, i was thinking along them lines recently as I found out the software i'm familiar with, mp3tag, have a codec available for flac use. After meticulously going through your music and adding amendments like a more specific genre, key and tempo then losing the lot in a crash you realise how much it sucks to regather that library from usb sticks, hardrives, sites that let you download your purchased music more than once and redo the lot. I've been buying wav however in the belief that, come the time I'm lucky enough to own cdjs that can play wav I can just convert the file as wav is lossless nevertheless. When burning flac do you add the cue sheet, i ask so I'll know for that amazing time lol. Changing the wav file names with the key and tempo prepended will do me for now but others have suggested that flac burnt to audio cd will just read as audio cd so my cdj800mk2s which only play mp3 cbr, vbr and wav will read the burn fine. Could save time is all if it's truly pointless. What do you think? Also, just so I know, Is that how you burn flac or would you do it the same way you make an mp3 disc?

I had a lovely cat for most of my life and it surprised me to see how delicate looking her skinw as underneath her fur, siamese cats don't give off this impression as their skin seems to 'bunch up thicker' where as hers was paper thin folds, if that makes sense.

136,"Hey, sorry for such a late reply, i've not been well but fine now. The point I was getting at was that, i know by experience that skin doesn't jut come off in a soak unless it's really ready to, even if a little amount of skin is still attached with the nerves, a soak and a wash simply won't do it. Even if some of the skin wasn't ready, rather the skin underneath wasn't ready for the air, the warm water would have been a nice middle point to go from skin covered to out in the open, it would of given the nerves a chance to climatize. You said you could see the muscles and stuff right? Trust me, whenever a furry type pet comes back from the vets having had an operation it shocks you to see a patch of fur missing and what is actually underneath. I've seen cats and dogs like this too where there skin seems to be very thin and shows off muscle definition quite significantly where as the fact is your just not used to seeing it and, probably because you're a caring person, you've fathomed up the worst case scenario like us worriers do. Anyway, I still haven't gotten company for Guia as my family don't want to be stuck in the loop of keep replacing mice and you know how strongly I feel about it so was wondering if you had any advice on how to convince them or any advice regarding Guia and keeping her in company in general.

141,"I'm so sorry you had to experience that. I don't know what I would've done shorter than losing my mind, except contemplation upon what I know from experience first hand. Hand being the point of this, when I was 7 or 8 I trapped my finger in a very heavy door in school and the end of it burst open under the sheer pressure. Now, i don't know whether it was adrenaline or shock as I could see the nerves hanging out of my finger but I was only crying because of the fuss being made. As a result that finger is a little shorter and the nail sits to one side which actually upset me later in life when I'd gotten good with a guitar but couldn't finger pick :/ anyway, the air usually stings fresh skin but the brain protects you in such a trauma and as I understand does in much of the animal kingdom. After it was sewn back up I had to see a consultant a few weeks later, every nadage change I looked away but I was there to get all the dead skin picked off. I did this myself as I didn't trust the nurse to peel it off running into fresh skin which I had done plenty of times with sunburn being a redhead lol. I made this mistake many times during the process anyway but still no pain. The nurse, a little concerned collared a passing doctor because I had all the feeling in the end of my finger but what should be stinging like mad was just hypersensitive, almost tickly to touch. He explained that when it happened, my subconscious (or something like that, i'm no proffessional in neural pathways) will have experienced the pain first and decided to process the signal in a way that wouldn't hinder or prevent self preservation. Thinking back, it was like a hose pipe, it couldn't have clotted and I indeed passed out a few times but, no I wasn't calm and collected about it, but I navigated my way through that junior school to the Headmasters office after knocking on the nurses office door which was just opposite first, rather than running and breaking down into shock at the first grown up. The scar is still tickly/hypersensitive to touch and I often get wicklows, or hangnails I think they're mainly known, which hurt like hell. My whole point being that if anything is tuned into self preservation it's a creature with so many natural predators, you can never fully breed that out of a domesticated animal. Though upon release into the wild I doubt they'd fair too well, that would be because of conscious decisions or a lack of, not what the brain decides for you, all the time, like when some ass writes YOU'RE NOW BREATHING IN MANUAL MODE lol, my apologies. You've got to remember aswell, that scab was ready to fall off, you didn't peel it off, also I've read about barbing in mice so the chances are it would of really hurt had another mouse been cleaning her too much and I'd imagine whilst seperated if it had dropped off naturally she wouldn't have had the steps of the scab coming off in the water where the nerves had some chance to climatize to the air slowly as she dried off, if she felt it at all. Infact, the scab coming off when it did, this is again on the chance she could've felt it, was very fortunate.

I'ts always a shock seeing a pet with zero fur where they should have some. My cat suffered from a thyroid problem and needed two seperate operations in her neck as she fell ill twice, the skin looked raw but the pics I have of all these cuts glued up and her face above, I think she would've just been a little chilly there. She didn't make it eventually bless her :(
(Just incase you were worried I had a cat tormenting them outside the cage all day.)

Sorry for this huge wall of text, but, you're clearly someone who devotes so much time and love for animals. This is vastly extended further by means of the internet in aiding me across the pond in which you've been brilliant. For you to experience that then feel bad, I thought some other perspectives may offer some solace. It's always about the self blame and doubt when we're softies in regards to animals right?!

Guia is still doing fine at this point btw but I've lost track of time. I told you we were recommended by a breeder to give it two weeks right? Do you think it's time to introduce her to a new little mate on neutral ground yet? Also, that neutral ground is gonna be a permanent playpen for a change of scenery so do you have any advice on it's construction i.e. the best things to include for their entertainment, fun and i guess relaxation lol, my sisters main intent was for it to be somewhere where they could interact with us easier and if or not they wanted to as opposed to waiting for them to get in the jar and then be restricted to our laps?

Thank's again mate, hope all is well your way.",2016-08-15 23:19:57+00:00,d6iz9k3,,t1_d6ex2ea,,PetMice
142,"Just by chance my sis was on about making a playpen, escape proof of course. Guia was out playing with us last night, I've not handled her in some time but she was getting used to me as she climbed all over my sister, running up her sleeves and all sorts so I don't think, at least in my very limited experience, that she is suffering the loss too badly. We were advised to give it 2 weeks before introducing another and obviously to go for a similar age.

So,. just your thoughts again if you wouldn't mind. I id notice that the house they have had tack like nails sticking out which have obviously been whacked in fully and double checked they didn't come through, one did so i pulled it out and it really had no need to be there. Can't remember them being there over xmas and with me having a good dose of ocd I know I would've checked. Could they have been having a go at them as a few were just say sticking out too but in any case is this sought of thing a big worry or are mice not as fragile as I'm making out? Can't see a pet store being that absent minded though.

Cheers again and I know I keep saying but thanks so much mate, we've already sorted a breeder too, not far away at all :)",2016-08-12 18:47:03+00:00,d6ewk64,,t1_d6aufp1,,PetMice

146,"Eeeh mate, sorry. Got yah now though, cheers bud!

Sick of hearing about it just being a mouse. They're Sentient enough right!? They show clear distinguishable traits and personas which I'll miss and thus yah gonna feel the loss and it's always worse with animals as they can't communicate what ails them so it stresses them and us both out tenfold more.

Nice to hear off my dad that everyone said the same at his swimming club, a life is a life. Even the coach, old traditional fella ex sas n what not (seen some real stuff)showed nothing but condolences and of course me dad played it off but he's the softest of the lot of us. used to have a cat yah see n if she was tossing a wild one around and had no pink staining aorund her fur he'd have me as decoy while he flanked Socksie. otherwise unfortunately we had to pretend we were coming to take it off her so she would hurry it up. She'd fall out with us for days because of her cat flap being locked, but when mice get picked up, although she woudn't bite until she'd had her play, sucks but that's apparently your cat showing you how to feed yet she knew where the cupboard and fridge was xD, even wild mice just tend to freeze. Once it was 3 hours before the terrified mouse on the other side of the flap finally snapped out of it and scampered off. Cat often returned an hour later with a realy thick basil brush tail, really annoyed with us as she obviously couldn't track the sent.

PETS HUH?!

Shes had a nut off me, well half as by force of habit the other was for remi but she wouldn't take the other half anyway. Me sis is back, gutted as expected but it turns out they were originally off gumtree, advertised as having been aound a while. This girls had em a year, well minus the 2-3 months her 'only' 2 weeks turned into and the week or so theyve been back so goodness knows there age.

I'll apologise first because I've asked alot and you've been great throughout, to Remi, Guia, and myself and what you've told me I've been able to pass on to my sis, mum and dad so really, cheers, can't thank you enough. Nevertheless, as we're all new to this and my sis agreed she'd have spent the ¬£130 and done the drive if we'd have told her, we are gonna procee with your recommendations in finding a breeder so if it isn't too much trouble (you've done plenty though bud and gooogles my friend lol) could yah please give me an idea of what to put? Yah know sorta like a header letter, match.com for mice style ad or what lol? I'll start with a mate of mine actually who breads ferrets, he's bound to know someone who knows a thing or two, Of course there's facebook and there's a North East Uk group for anything you've thought about, honestly, whatever yah can think, there's a north east uk group lol. Other than that is there any universal websites with area coded forums or something? Just any thoughts  that might be of benefit, brilliant, also keeping Guia busy is posing a challenge too :s

Like I said bud, you've done your bit a hundred times over, really can't thank you enough for your help and kindness so no dramas at all if I don't hear back.

My sis met her doing their masters if you can believe that, i can't fathom how someone with that level of intellect, can be so ignorant. All the info is at our finger tips! &gt;:(

I think they were bought together, probably from a big chain with poorly trained employees where kids wallop the sides of fish tanks where a 'warning don't tap the glass' sign once hung but that's a 'bit' of a presumption; I don't think it is to guess that they're close in age, may in fact be sisters for all we know. Any idea what to do because getting a new one means it will be alone eventually or worse for guia she ends up alone again and I don't know how to go about rescuing a mouse let alone age specific, but, as you said it could have a negative instead of a positive effect which could spiral for the two of them.

150,"Thanks for your reply, unfortunately the vet took one look, took her away, returned to say what he was going to do which was to just fill the plastic tank she was taken up in with a gas. :( I wish I'd gone with now but I'd been up all night doing the odd check. It was a warm night at least so I just left her where she had chosen to be. There was no change, no worse no better. Apparently the vet mentioned it could of been cancer and would've been a costly route to go down but as I said last night I'd have paid happily, but my parents made the decision. I wonder what it was, why her eyes are still open and unfortunately what could've been done differently. This fortnight, if that, I've barely seen them and not handled them at all, I just kept saying tomorrow to myself which is upsetting, just frankly selfish really, but I know my sister had them out at every opportunity and when we had them at Xmas I'd often wait as long as an hour (and then some) for them to hop in the jar when they were ready and then transport them through to the living room for a play. Often suffering insomnia around the beginning of the year they were great company and because of them it didn't feel like the whole world was asleep as it normally does lol.

What do I do about the other mouse? I mean, do I show her or... that probably sounds ridiculous but also I fear the remaining mouse will get very lonely if you've any advice there too? In any case, thank you again for your reply. I got plenty of snaps of them lol.

I record my mixes in Audacity and to stop glitches I usually have it set to 16 bit pcm but will this product give me the extra cpu to record in higher quality, also would it be preferable to record in ableton?

In all seriousness, I used to be a stoner and any chance to defend weed I would take, but this drug run through I've done since the last 5-6 years ago made me totally forget about green. I never tried the cannabinoids though as I'm carefully careless, if that makes sense at all?

I don't want anyone to quote me on this, but i was majorly depressed so got back into it, now and then to avert a build up that inevitably leads to anxiety. But i had the seizure 3 months after my last smoke... I've no problem being open to a doctor about this once I've changed docotors as I was assured I wouldn't be placed on ssri's by her; and i repeatedly stressed to her i hadn't even tried a cigarette before my first ssri and this time, as Citalopram turns out to be an ssri, the next day after taking my first I stopped doing my 17 mile bike rides and within weeks was trying to see if legal highs were even still a thing. I bought enough gear to taper but in the meantime I have had a few revelations regarding myself so it's not all bad news but them same revelations would have come to me had I of given them a chance in the first place i.e. Your Holiday theory.

I have come to learn the reason i had the seizure but I don't care to share the details but i will say there is nothing to doubt mdai or 1plsd had anything to do with the gran mal episode and would rather be quoted as saying they were to blame. Having said that any American epileptics out there who have responded well to medical cannabis please give me a shout as the tiny amount i inhaled each night like clockwork stopped last october and i believe after 3 months you're clear of it right? Then it's just been a game of chance since xmas time for me.  Though i had started the odd inhalation the week before my seizure my understanding, if this is at all the reason, is that whether I'd had my usual 4fmph and random benzos that night instead. I still would have had the seizure, a week later not. I tried a 50 mg 5 meo dibf a week later because my bdays caning of mdai and last corner of a 1p blotter mixed with a seizure (please tell me if it was just one off the above) gave me a permanent comedown. Itook the dibf with depression, it peeked me up and a week later i bombed a mix of 4fmph and mdai as mdai makes me sleepy and it perked new up again. I have plenty of the above and have not been tempted where veggie it was previously very moorish and although i went prepared to a stash do full of strangers itook neither my 4fmoh nor my pyrazolam and sit rather happy now

I had taken mdai with mpa many times last year just so the own wasn't wasted otherwise I'd have thrown it but that was now clearly down to the mpa outweighing the mdai stages. , i didn't even hey my scans till 4fmphs release.

211,"yeah, i know how crazy what I'm saying sounds, but i didn't just roll over and let life become a struggle. Ten years nearly i've jumped from ssri's to exercise and played by the rules. Then, my doctor recently said she had exhaused her avenues. That was a huge shock.

She had a contact so after a little heel dragging I went along to meet the contact. He just ask questions which is sort of what I expected.

Next day, he rings to say he was the receptionist of the guy I was supposed to be seeing and he won't see you. "" The guy on the other end wouldn't leave either, I physically, quite literally said, you're not responsible for what happens to me here on out for him to get off the line. Turns out he was actually an ex drugs councillor turned receptionist. He rang ym doctor and my (much needed Dihydrocodeine) painkiller script has been terminated, sure I Pickedthem up early once or twice, I'm a week and a day late this time, that isn't rare and other than the odd j, i've been clean since mcat was banned upto last october.

Having said all this, I'm better than where i was last october.

Anyone who frequently catches their Doc looking at webmd (who then procedes to click off of it the moment they're aware they have visitors, should change docs. But...i'm with this Doc because my last Doc did that and threatend to end my epilepsy meds when i used to need them because she wanted a catch up and I was away at UNI. Her husband actually was my specialist as a child. Confidentiality can be broken surely if you give permission and it saves the long trip home. I've drifted, my apologies. But I've really lost faith in the professionals.

I hadn't even tried a cigarette till my first ssri (sertraline aka zoloft) and within a few months I had done the majority of things never on any ones list in the first place but I enjoyed only drinking now n then and I took extra care with being a peti mal turned gran mal epileptic (that alone took like 5 years to sought out as a kid because Doctors, the other end of the UK this time, said I just didn't get enough sleep.) After a few years off the rails i was believed, finally, I was no longer greaving the loss of my closest friend, suicide btw, but some people do that and, whilst it hurt, i accepted it almost from the start so in turn the ssris were stopped and i still had time to stock some mcat or w/e but I lost interest.

She assured me ctilopram was different, was only for ocd anyway. Wen I returned two weeks later having given up my day on day off 17 mile bike rides she felt it important she upped my dose because my depression was coming back. I now know that she was giving me ssris again. If i go to a doc again it stands to chance that 6 month's down the line i'll be charming cobras in india. Just the word Doctor, stirs feelings of worry, anxieties and stress.

Hard way to have to realise it, but I've wasted alot of time and probably removed some from myself too and others for that matter! Hurt family, damaged relationships.

I had pride once, but the amount of specialists I've seen who've watched Good Will Hunting too many times took that, hopefully ill get back to normal and never trust one persons judgement again, Docs are human and therefore fallible, which is why I ask here and will on as many sites as there are words in this wall of (easily by now) jibberish. But ask me anything about music or movies, or w/e I'm interested in at a particular time and I'll tell you everything like a museum tape, shot interest span on things other than that so I've mentioned ADHD, Low Spectrum or maybe Uncharted Autism. But neither can be diagnosed in adulthood, only childhood, when all attention was on epilepsy.

The 4f-mph worked, it doesn't permit me a recreational dose, it's side effect, easily stopped by Pyrazolam. Many don't believe that works, for me it's gold, worth more actually. But the ban... LSD and the likes could have been the one off thing to fix me like 4f and Pyr had already achieved.  I think if it could be diagnosed as an adult, adderall (is it?) and whatever Pyrazolam cousin/ analogue there is in existence would have led me to a happy healthy life.

Oh, and my ocd's alot worse so I hate myself for not just toughing it out. But I did state clearly no ssris cos they make ma carefree. On etizolam, or Flubromazolam and an Empathogen, I'd still care. Took years after stopping sertraline to give a flying eff again. That was really hard living, minus any serotonin from that scenario.
Did get a weak dose of the introspectives though, i probably needed that so, i need to get my own place again. My family, what I must have and still am putting them through, that's real grief, greaving for the damage you yourself have done to others! Bugger what i've done to me)

It gave me some amazing realizations and my levels seem to be a little higher but... still crazy low.

The 75mg spaced out was with my sciatica meds dihydrocodeine and a tad bit 4f-mph and pyrazolam. No idea what to expect, just yawning giggles, very relaxed, for maybe an hour or so. So i thought nothing of taking the 25 during the night after my bday where id had some mdai and 4f-mph.

Unfortunately the beginning of that chemical depression was my first seizure in ten years. My mum found me and said it lasted 40 mins.
75ug and it wasnt a problem last corner actually months later and it is? Or it was the mix? The 50 mg 5 meo dibf was taken out of desperation but like the seizure time, it began very ketamine like. Very confusing, still confused compared to how i was before. But passable as normal :S

Any help here please? I used to get through 30 g's of mcat in a day.

With a history of epilepsy you'd think I would have the sense to avoid these risks but a decade now, life has been a static battle with depression which in turn leads to heavy alcohol and drug use, which stopped when I was taken off anti depressants, actually ssri's Sertraline. I did have one good year a few ago where exercise replaced all and everything. Alas, I started with OCD and my doctor placed me on Ctilopram. I went back and said I was becoming down almost depressed numerous times to wwhich doses and drugs were changed. Till she admittedly had no idea how to help my depression!!!!! :O ""You put me on these for OCD initially remember, i was doing well!?"" She admitted under he breath that she had infact put me on an ssri, I could also see the remnants of webmd on her screen. Nevertheles, we're all fallible. Again apologies for the rambling, it'll be a murky few days, still feel sick off popping my shoulder back in. It's been out plenty but get a Doc, like I normally do, it ain't like the movies.



As far as I was conscernered I had outgrown my epilepsy, ten years, zero fits. Possibly the uk's most reputable source or myself has brought it back with 1PLSD or my careless behaviour :S

As a kid, petimal seizures are where you freeze like a computer and that can either progress into full on fits with adulthood or leave you enitirely, I had 2 fits then nothing for ten years so I wasn't certain but confident I was free of it. till I tried a very reputable sources 1p lsd or it's badly chosen mixture by me. A quarter, just the 25ug as it was only my second time, no more! The first time was the other 75 in 3x15 min phases accompanied by pyrazolam 3x0.5mg for confidence and i had a bad back, (genuine) sciatica, so took a few dihydrocodeine, weened onto kratom now but I can't get that dosing quite right and |I hate the buzz of the DHC because I enjoy it but I did thnk, it'll be easier to explain if it goes wrong. Well...Damn. Anyway I just yawned and giggled for an hour, anyway,

Just the 4f-mph, 1.5mg pyrazolam 2-300 mg of mdai in about 8 hours then calmed it down as people were getting up, was the morning after bday so they could've thought anything, then rolled a weak WeaK WEAK J, using juicy jay and decided to have that and chew the 25, people are microdosing the stuff I thought. The people getting up found me seizing covered in blood off multiple injuries but all I remember is a Kayhole almost instantaneously starting when I finsihed my j and was walking up to my room. After sitting I noticed the buttons on my phone were, like that youtube video trick to watch, but that was odd but ok, then I was in my own soap drama and the main charcter was on Acid. Still hadn't fallen at that point though till I think I realised, I took some acid.Things is whilst not 1P, I've done alot more of a variety at uni,  for 4-5 days at a time, and id had 3 times this amount in 1P a few weeks before and this probs only did the youtube trick without the laptop as intended for that fraction because of the no sleep. Once I blinked that stopped, no cev's.


A reputable vendor, or myself caused my absent for ten years fits to strike again so the carefree me from the Mcat, ket and w/e days, who just popped back because I wouldn't get the chance otherwise to get hold of unadulterated stuff or at least the closest someone can get without becoming a chemist/ pharmacist.

""I'm quite confident you do not, so I will not waste my time"" That is all it took for an average person like me to realise where the following was heading. You summed yourself up to everyone else.

I'm sorry you picked up on what I wrote as aggressive, I was merely trying to engage you in debate. In future read objectively because after misinterpreting what I wrote, anger clouded and then took control of you ""Comparing one report to many others whilst simultaneously asking questions regarding yourself in a community who's pure aim is to reduce harm."" Does not even specify a community let alone 'a user forum.'

Do you know why the moniker for such a community is forum? Face to face I doubt that this is you at all and lashing out at strangers on the internet accomplishes what? If it is the real you then I think you need to reevaluate who in your life lately you have perceived to be reckless, irresponsible or just simply wrong in a circumstance you've appointed yourself the rightful.

I am aware I have grammar issues and I apologise, it's a little laziness and ignorance on my behalf but you don't know me, nor what I may or may not have been through as I know just as little about you, except you're angry.

I hate making assumptions but whatever you are on, you can tell yourself repeatedly what the studies and statistics say till you're blue in the face, it doesn't agree with you and you will burn all of your bridges in the real world as well as behind the mighty keyboard.

223,"When I used to take E and later Mcat, i would have upto 4 days of a session, never took my ssris during, but that is jumping ahead.

My initial passion for empathogens was me double dropping at around 11 pm, meeting my friends inside a pub or club, danced, talked and smoked like a chimney. Came home, smoked more because of the dopamine and drank fresh oj, would always take hours to get to sleep, sometimes wouldn't and just ... because it felt a hundred times better and different (you guys know what I'm talking about.) Whether I made it into Uni or not that day depended entirely on how early the lecture was but my sertraline i'd even set an alarm to wake and take. That night, bang, just as powerful. 

So, it stands to reason my meds were filling my 'roll fuel' back up but at the same time, i was clearly but unknowingly playing with fire.

Okay, thanks for your input, though I'm afraid the majority was wasted on me. Alas, others will come across this I'm sure and find what you said ,not only interesting but useful.

""I hold that it is a must for anyone going to use a psychoactive drug to be familiar with the basics."" On the contrary I was at my wits end after two devastating occurrences when I was offered an Empathogen from someone under the effects of one.

I DO NOT CONDONE SELF MEDICATING IN ANY SHAPE OR FORM, THE LATTER PART OF WHAT I SAY SHOULD BE ESPECIALLY CRITICISED BY YOU, THE READER.

I went into a spiral of using different substances to get by as suicide was my constant thought. I'm not only alive today because of substances, but I no longer have Epilepsy. Having said that, yes, I  used a lot of drugs but did not go as far as the likes of Heroin, at that point that was simply because the opportunity didn't present itself.

What is wrong with the usual methods of harm reduction? As in, comparing one report to many others whilst simultaneously asking questions regarding yourself in a community who's pure aim is to reduce harm. There are simply no absolutes, but the voice of many, either by experience or by literature comfort me more in my decsion making than what a couple of scientist/authors wrote in a book. I reiterate there are no absolutes.

233,"100mg at least for me with 3-FPM, to just sense it. Same with MDAI up untl a few weeks back. October I thought I'd try mpa, 2ai, 5iai, nm2ai, mdai and 3-fpm. MPA was the only one that worked. I'd been in a room full of cokeheads all with their own supplies and tired each and had nothing but a sped up heartbeat so assumed it was just no for me. Then I stumbled upon a forum, bah blah blah, i took 150 mg of mdai in  one go, it was like my first roll ever. However, it was just the white gold stock they ffound they had left over :(

So did the same with the 3-FPM, nice but not a touch for me on MDAI. WSas just about to try smoking 15mg of 3-FPM when I hapened upon a earthy yellow source of MDAI, just meant taking more, not alot more for me, bit more expensive is all. I think I will order some 3-FPM now and take ...... on what I've shared with you what would you recommend? The first pill i had, was with all my mates who had done a few, took another one and a half to get me there, I think they still believe to this day I was secretly an E addict but nope...sucks, not even a good party trick is it? I've already had some 4f-mph and was warned not to trifle with mixing that and ephenedrine, diphenedrine because the stimulation would be unbearable, 1plsd is quite stimulating so I've heard so...what dyah think? I've some bk-2-cb and some 5-meo-dibf too btw, not tried em.

On a side note, have you smoked 3-FPM? I do have about 30 mg of it still? Never smoked a powder before but I'm certainly not above it.

234,"Could you suggest any for me? Even mixes would be ok here.

I know before I got back into RC's last october, a good 6 year away from them (mcat got banned, NRG2 was too hard to get hold of, so I thought eff it, missed out on a boat load of good stuff though) I devolped sciatica. Still having my old ways about me I would take 150-200mg Dihydrocodeine in one go which had built up off of the less painful days.

That always hit like a weak empathogen with no comedown. Mildly  more chatty, but it was almost an instant warm rush, again weak but in no way undesirable and it would stay that way for about 4 hours. Kratom is lush but if I'm feeling euphoric I'm also barely conscous, though I've not tried extract.

Also worth mentioning I was on daily meds for depression when  was double dropping every night, sertraline, a ssri. 

!!!!!As far as I'm aware, only learned recently by me, that can lead to serotonin syndrome so please do not copy this practice!!!!!

235,"Great info, thankyou very much!

The problem is, ive found I can hammer anything but weed. Gets me too aware of my heart and from there  it moves to 'I'm having a heart attack.' Even needed to be talked down a little (but not anything like them videos you see on youtube lol.) So, i've a few 100ug 1plsd blotters, 1 bk-s-cb pellet and a 5-meo-dibf tablet. I tried 25 mg 1p then again after 15 mins and once more after 15 mins along with a pyrazolam and (genuine) dihydrocodeine for sciatica. As wonderful as it was I don't think it was supposed to be like an extremely giggly sleepy sunday lie in.

But on any other drug, even a pint of lager, i can smoke as much weed as I want, especially on a comedown. So will the mdai have that effect or are the hallucogens such as those you mentioned nothing like weed? Aldo, how about microdosing 1plsd with it?

I'm afraid I can't get hold of the same ones you've mentioned nor the stims as I'm in the UK. That's why I use 4f mph and eph. How about Thiopropamine or 3-fpm? Methiopropamine was good with it but heard varying stories on it's son.

Is it indeed true that the ingredients used to produce MDAI were included in the 116 substance ban In China? If so, it stands to reason they've found analogues of the chems needed or some awesome way around that tree in road. My last batch, initially disappointing because to look at it, it was was like the colour of wet sand, yet, went down and felt just as pixie dust like as the white yet golden crystalline quality we prefer during test conditions. 

So we're researching substances, because the predecessors were deemed illegal and now, even the chems used to make up these legal lab supplies are ancestors of what once was possibly a much more straightforward operation that (at least in the case kratom 'not extract') had a low criminal element, passed through a great deal less adulterating hands, hell, even the governmental vigilantes must've had easy jobs with our tax money pocketed to boot.

255,"Best i can currently do for something like this is any stim and mxp.

The reality 6-7 years prior was what we liked to call a night at the catshack 'my place' (drugged minds think shit is more than shit, that name was shit.)

We'd go to our local takeaway who sold lot's of herbal highs including some real stuff and buy some london doves, herbal E, but the strongest E you'd had regardless of whether it was legal or not. Then we'd hit a drum n bass or dubstep night or just go back to the Cshack, or even our mates place who all sessioned just as hard (The Boom Room was their place) and we'd absolutely, morishly and shamelessly fiend on mcat. I'm talking vinyl sleeve corner to far corner 5 mm thick swelling towards a cm in the middle lines aplenty.

Both mine and the Boom Room had all sorts of decks, a third party of mates actually (self taught and by hand) rented out sound systems they had built from the ground up. So we'd start mixing back to back (once even tried to do a spiral line on a vinyl that was for the bin, it wasn't as complimenting as them treadmill zig zag sweets/chips youtube videos I'll tell you that much).

3am we'd hit the park, where there would be no one to be found, usually, but the fire was always lit. This time however, people were there playing dubby technical hi-hat type percussion on some bongos they had brought. (I'll speed this up) They came back to mine where we each took turns selecting our favourite songs on youtube or whatever, it didn't matter if it was the clair de lune or the british national anthem. The mix of the london doves, with Mcat, spliffs all night ,obviously, and the Ketamine them 'guys already at the fire' shared out was absolute bliss. I'd wager in the hours that followed us all slipping into our holes that not one of us could of had a bad trip, it was too perfect. From then on, ketcat (another monika for the books) was fun, but we never came close to that again. Trippiest bit was that we all remember hanging out with a friend that night, the same friend actually, who wasn't there lol. He was on the phone hands free for a few minutes but gave up after a string of nonsensical answers, we kept talking to him though, long after he'd hung up. Also, I've gotta buy this as a poster, if you have the time search ""king midas sound - dub heavy"" because that vinyl sleeve, we all thought was a window and waned to invite the lady in as she looked cold.

Speaking of, is it okay to mix 4f-mph or 3fpm or mdai with ephenidine or mxp? I'm not that spirit I used to be. Not sure whether I should follow that with unfortunately or prepend it with fortunately. We admired everything at that age and them soundsystem's were just as awesome turned respectfully down at reasonable times, we even walked our a's to b's, to c's and back to a's etc. In near silence, empathetic with those who have to rise and work early. Had we of drank alcohol to that level of an altered mind, we would've probably been breaking out into violence, though I hope I don't have that within me.)

:/ 6 years clean and a ban coming, narrowly evaded, I want to live it once more and if not it then some form of different, yet in it's own right, glorious high. I have 1plsd but weed on it's own gives me bad anxiety. With a beer its fine so i still tried the 1p, with my prescription dihydrocodeine, a pyrazolam for nerves too, so yeah I yawned and giggled for about an hour that's it, felt lush but not what was aimed. Though 100 ug cut in 4, 1 25ug every 20 mins, only took 3 anyway, bound to go wrong. Proper fucked that up. But I've acquired some Phenibut I'm assured will do the trick. Hopefully have some new nostalgia before my uk totalitarian government prevent me from ever doing so again.

He knows he's better not using any, works for him, if it does for you too then that's great but I'd imagine he ain't the majority, also, if you want to produce in a DAW (most djs tend to now, i use a few and they all need theory so ...) you're gonna need at least a little bit of theory.

278,"We meet again lol. How yah doin?

Here's how I see it. It's crucial to me personally and I, at least, don't believe I'm a noob. The camelot wheel is essentially the circle of fifths, now you can't really think that the circle of fifths are something that only noobs think is crucial, right? Alot of symphonies have been written by a lot of noobs in that case. 
Whether you know the theory or not, if you're in key you're adhering to the structure and that's that, by knowing the structure, understanding why it is the way it is and works the way it does only gives you more possibilities. Unless you're great without all that then maybe just leave it but I'll get to that.
I'd not only encourage harmonic mixing but for learners to 'key' their music instead of 'coding' it, using the circle of fifths instead of the camelot wheel. The camelot wheel is still a very clever and useful tool but your access to the sheer number of scale possibilities (harmonic minor, phrygian dominant, pentatonic, simple major or minor for example) is seemingly cut off.

Now, Having said all that, to many DJ's and the greater picture many musicians in general, Theory isn't so important. They adhere to it still, but are creative, happy and satisfied enough without that knowledge. Plenty of them will be brilliant djs, I know someone like that actually who has done pretty well for himself but as a producer too. 
Just to clarify, his theory knowledge = zilch and his mixing and tunes are great, It's strongly believed Hendrix knew no theory, he's even played songs out of tune that worked fine because in some way they followed some scale lol. Also worth a mention, a guitarist from the band Metallica, kirk Hammett, sought out music education after fame.
Fans argue that that alone led to the bands following couple albums being of a lower standard set by those prior, it was almost like he'd been restrained by the knowledge.
He was overthinking things I believe but he's back to normal now, better even as he works rather than struggles with the knowledge, there's fans of Metallica who'll disagree with every word of that though as again that's my personal belief. By the way though, his mentor Joe Satriani is a guitar god and really really knows his music theory. Nevertheless, it goes to show, there are no ultimatums, it's whatever works for the individual. 

If you're comparing yourself too much to 'the pros' then surely you're gonna strip a little individuality from your set right?
Why don't you just say aural training or a good ear instead of words that are only going to deter people? Unless you start out with ears that really aren't made for music, the more music you play or mix or even make, the better trained your ear will be. Just to reiterate though, because I'm aware I make a lot of statements and my grammar isn't very good these days, this is what I believe and at the same time there's nothing wrong with not sharing that belief, unless you have no choice but to be a musician and your ears suck then it's your only hope.

I didn't claim an authorised music file was a thing, poor phrasing maybe, but why are some words green and others black? That's the only question I really wanted answering lol, I thought I'd add a second in whilst on the topic but its led to your tangent and in turn my tangent and also your stance on piracy. By the way i whole heartedly agree with your stance on piracy except when an artist gives out free downloads, they don't want you to delete it you know, they mean for you to keep it. It's ok. My source in question which I only ever buy from have made me suspicious regardless of how reputable they are, it'll sting more because of that. Infact, a few sites have been called out in the past, whatever your source is mate, it could be them one day.

I'm getting to the point where I need a rest from the agony and my bladders attitude is 'come on we've just started' so hopefully i can attempt manually breaking it up again tonight.

On the subject of painkillers and before I leave you alone lol, can you think of anything that would genuinely help with the pain, my options are really benzos, some ket like analogues which I think both are the last things I need lol, or ibuprofen and paracetamol which even my last 6 years off drugs never helped. Cannabis will just make this whole thing more scary I think. Only thing that's slightly worked is a pile cream, slightly is maybe generous too!

Thank you for your interest in Cornish Sea Salt!

All sea salt contains traces of naturally occurring iodine but here at Cornish Sea Salt we do not add any.

It didn't and according to another redditor is too much salt but i thought they would've just advised against it knowing this because i'm not really thinking clearly.

Now, to the case regarding how I've made you feel. I've found great support here and am truly at my wits end but if you look at my other posts and the way I've been told ""I'm a Dickhead"" and the likes, i'm clearly not the person I thought I was. I suffer anxiety and however old my account is ,7 months i think, is when i first had the courage to even join th eonline world again, still struggling with the outside one. Having said that, I'm not going to missed if I sink back into depression, im certainly not suicidal though, just means a very boring life. I truly appreciate you helping against the odds of someone who seems like they don't want to listen. Hopefully people are still willing to help but after I think I'm going to again 'retreat' so to speak and look at myself properly again. I have had some great correspondences within this subreddit so assumed the others were just 'keyboard warriors' but I'm hard work full stop it seems :/ I even got ridiculed for putting kind regards on the end of messages.

My doc has me on dihydrocodeine for sciatica so I've had bm problems by proxy, nothing like these epic proportions though.. Made especially worse after the first few weeks when I realised I could abuse it, btw my doc knows my history so took a risk in hoping i wouldn't find out?

It's a stim im buying on line i believe is behind this problem, this is self inflicted so no sympathy due here really but after 6 years of behaving I think I just got to the end of my tether again, but saying that, here I am.

Just for reference may I ask why? Also, how come there are posts on here specifically aimed at the discussion of sources, anything special about them? Just out of curiosity that's all.

Lastly, is there a way to communicate sources at all and if so how? My point is, I'd trust someone with a review at least over google results and is it not safer for all at the end of the day to be informed and well read source wise? The source options in the sidebar seem outdated but then things change so fast and often in general, not just rc wise I mean everything, I don't suppose many subreddits keep up.

Non UK redditors? Heres an idea. Go to the petition parliament website and pick a petition. Next, give the details a look over but this exercise mainly pertains to the number of petition's it needs for parliament to act. Many of you will find that our government has acted well on a petition you picked and I guarantee that will depend on it's content because they don't like nor trust us but they like us placid, dopey (in a false sense of security way) and preferably, on their side. Those of you who saw your number match only to witness the climb resume without a mumble of the subject matter in the house of commons can come together and discuss the common ground your subjects share. They may even be audacious enough to reset the number a few times but at the end of the day I bet you didn't shout Shotgun or whatver the rules to the game they play in them rows are. Perhaps it's too big a decision to trust the nitwit Brit public and like carers, shepards or even sheepdogs they make them decisions for us. Like when your mum cut your food as a kid if it was tough because you couldn't yet use a sharp knife?

Now Trump, I'm sure many of you truly belive in him but just spoil yah vote would you or go and read the art of the deal. Can you spoil your vote inthe US? He not only admits to making a living out of simply being an effin liar but manages to show that he doesn't understand the meaning of his seemingly favourite word, see hyperbole. Need any more convincing with your decision, see Bush Jnr and Sovereignty. Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it right, it also effects this stupid little rock too so pack it in, you're making me nervous as eff and they'll be nothing to take to calm them nerves. Have you thought what happens if enough of you vote for one person, they usually win. Is it really worth it to prove a point? Right, back to it then.

Whilst farfetched and who started out just like your Trump rebellion vote, Nigel Farage has declared that he has ‚Äúnever taken drugs‚Äù and ‚Äúhopes he never has to‚Äù but revealed he supported their decriminalisation. Uk independence would have surely made the RC scene, different, to what we see now, would there have been a need for one? It really only raises more questions as you think how many ways the whole (probable) Shebacle may have transpired, threatening culture, trade and on and on but there were things more important to him, at least, than ruining the fun (in some cases the last line ) of others in an edging Dictatorship masquerading as a fair system. Panic it was, in it's purest, utterly misjudged him and more importantly us didn't they. They all stooped to amazingly pathetic new lows to tarnish his name, decent bloke never retaliated in that manner where as It's basically common knownledge he has some anecdotes and if he'd of gotten started... but he showed respect and preferred to yield than Smeagle himself. Crazy man, yet interesting ( walked from a plane crash almost Bond style) wild ideas but maybe a good guy? Same with our awesome Boris, admits to being a toker on numerous occasions not the once and ""I didn't inhale"" rhetoric but Cocaine in Uni even, the world saw him dangling from that zip line at our Olympic games lol but again, good chap I think. The problem is, I think, they both have a spine and so both become automatically unsuitable as British leadership material.

So, it goes without saying I have over generalised alot and made light of certain subjects and people to support an epicly bias stance which is my affinity for Psychoactive substances, but, in conclusion I ask what would be the point of hurrying the current dwellers out? Who is representing us anyway? :S At least on the rehab vs punsiment front we have someone right? Russell Brand, he's finally grown on me but they'll never listen to him, once tarred, you know? ""The man in the silly hat!"" Peter Hitchens, a mature conservative author quipped as Russel was quite blatantly outwitting the man. he probably still tells people about that and how fast the witty moniker entered his head.....Brilliant Peter but tone it down, psychoactively I nearly used all my monthly laughs up in one go.

Many of my friends had enough common sense to do some warped and highly specific degrees meaning they live all over the world now.

No one talking to him is more than likely correct. Full Disclosure of what I understand to be the facts. The people closest to him, from what I understand shamed him, small time shamed but still shamed nevertheless, because it turned out he liked homosexual pornography. Ok, he's got a gf and they've had a kid and his internet history transpires somehow. A: Why did that go any further than between himself and her and B: I bet it was quite the shock but why did the sexuality of the content make it 100 times a bigger deal? Whilst I'll admit I may have cracked a gay joke or two as a kid, these are adults and it's 2016, even Stone Cold Steve Austin supports equality lol 'more power to them' I believe he says (youtube it it's pretty cool) Anyway it was the Same people who shamed him this time so he's always had a crowd on his side, not! Basically they're all his ex's friends and you can't just cut an ex out of your life when you've a kid can you. I've no kids yet so I don't really know enough to maintain a position on this but the fact that he stuck around after something that personal became common knowledge shows his head and hearts in the right place in regards to his daughter right?

Please pardon my ignorance but Where is NL?

Regarding everything you just said, although I had to think about the rapist etc. parts a while I think I agree and it actually brings to mind something that happened near me.
A guy near where I live had hidden a camera in his own bathroom to catch people going to the toilet which isn't the worst but also had some questionable child orientated pictures on his computer. Knowing the guy (as a sort of familiar stranger if that makes sense and not personally) I believe him being rumbled would have been punishment enough, very timid, self conscious, timid dude. But the law is the law and he was punished. However, locals plus facebook and said information added up to him being shamed over and over till these people ran out of contacts. He has never actually laid a finger on a child and actually has a very happy and healthy daughter. I'm certainly not in the guys corner rooting for him but with empathy on a basic human level It made me really wonder how after all of that he can ever try to put his life back together, you know? It has also just occurred to me that these shaming do gooders  have probably made things impossible for his daughter as kids can be mean without being given ammunition to use too.

No situation is ever really rose tinted but did you have something specifically in mind?

I can honestly say that, the ebst thing I've come across is Pyrazolam. I still love my stims but not asmuch as empathogens which you just can't get now. Many deem Pyrazolam inactive, but if , like myself, someone has suffered depression or anxiety and jumped through all the hoops of different brand names of the same chemical 'sertraline' for almost decade, i'm not advising anyone try drugs but i will say you won't find pyrazolam so inactive then...recreational it's not, to me though, life changing.

As for stim usefulness I've never found one that isn't morish other than 4f-mph, just a shame that it's not good for you, but it is most certainly a functional stim to me.

Are you coming from the angle of rehab as in real rehabilitation? I recently lost a friend who originally got locked up for having a dealers amount of, I honestly don't know, which apparently was all for him. He spent the next years of his life trying to get back in, drugs were easier to get hold of, cheaper, more varied and apparently safer because veryone knew the seller and if someone died it didn't take a huge guess as to the cause.

The guy was a trouble maker from the word go from what I gather but didn't move into the area till my teens, where he stuck up for me. The area i reside in all have bad opinions of the guy but a true 'code of honour' style mate, distant mates but mates nevertheless.

My point is I personally believe that rehab rather than punishment initially could have led my friend onto a great life, it may not have as he may have refused the chance or squandered it or even played along to avoid sentence, but at least the system could have  said it gave him a fair chance.

I do see where you are coming from in regards to how it affects daily life and as we know some substances affect others more or even differently than others so maybe an individual basis perhaps, think Lemme or Ozzy? Either way, why can't we have people altering their minds?

It's always gone on whether society accepted it or not i.e. Entheogenic reasons in tribal cultures to the sheesha fiends, (feudal Japan? Not sure,) who were ousted from their villages.  BTW it grows at the side of the road in N Korea apparently and not illegal, nor considered anything but a literal weed. Those who were ousted sound no different from modern day, dropping responsibilities, running out of money etc. So it's simple thy are either on too strong a drug or can't handle anything. My point being is that, if society relaxed a bit and everyone managed to fit into this fantastical society without hurting or offending others then what is the problem?",2016-03-19 22:35:44+00:00,d1645m8,2.0,t1_d15nbbn,31888.0,researchchemicals
382,"I use that 4f-mph and can confirm the sketchiness, nearly completely off it so wish me luck :)

I never tried real acid so Have bought a few tabs of 1p, i tried 75 mg 5 mins inbetween 25mg but then took a pyrazolam and some kratom so I was just a sedated giggling mess :( but still... :) will try again.

A kratom website I like to use who's owner is very anti extract and hardly tolerant of maeng dah. Anyway, he sells only natural and was actually more peturbed about the hardworking harvesters of the leaf that have gotten used to an income. Them harvesters will probablies have to turn to work for those that create maeng dah which is 'Pimps Grade.'

His words not mine although not verbatim as I lost the e-mail ""The RC's exist to replace what has already been banned, safer things that we now know plenty about, this will ban will occur but this time new more dangerous rc's wont emerge but good people will go underground and have to deal with sometimes dangerous individuals who have no regard for your safety in the slightest.""
It annoys me to think an elderly person who has used kratom to leave the likes of dihydrocodeine behind, ike myself, will have to visit said individuals or go back to DHC, that is their choice :S

Mdai, 5iai, 2ai and 3fpm have no effect on me, but neither did coke really, I'm currently giving 3fpm a final chance but it doesn't seem to do a thing for me, MPA worked though which is why I felt mdai was a shame for me as I'd heard they had fantastic synergy, actually MPA and the awful MXP had a nice synergy, noone will ever believe me on that though.

What is M1? I stopped everything after mcat, just started back last september so I'm afraid I missed a lot of the fun including the furans and 3fma, 4fa, i caught the tail end of MPA, just, and now just 4f-mph, anxiolytic benzos and the dissos once in a blue moon. Having said that, I would've started back on stuff either way, fortunately there was still a legal much safer route available for me, right? Never touched any cannabinoids though and up until recently realised I stopped using that in september hahahaha. Whilst arguably safer and the anxiolytics are a new addition, sinc about october I've just gone about things as 'nearly' usual.

My main worry is the day mcat stopped, I was paying ¬£5 a gram so i had to quarter my intake as it was ¬£20 on the street and cut to ribbons so probably halved my intake overnight. It was unreal, people were turned away from help as the 'help' new nothing about the substance as they had refused the research, I believe a respected scientist quit over it. What would have happened if Mcat withdrawals and the recent MPA for that matter were like alcohol wd's...Delerium tremors...fortunately it wasn't but with so many substances going on one day, what are the chances a few of them are cold turkey killers? The chances are certainly raised, thoughts?",2016-03-19 22:14:56+00:00,d163h8e,2.0,t1_d15q0ba,24459.0,researchchemicals

My mixing is fine, I hope yours is too but you seem to be chasing after some, fountain of youth style, dj secret so you can finally mix properly.

Right, this isn't anything new, I grew up in the south of England, born there along with my younger sis. My whole family on both sides are from the opposite end of the country, my dad was just down there for work. So I'm 12 and my sis is 8-9 and we move to the opposite end of the country, back up north with the rest of the family. Now, my parents accents rubbed off on us down south but arriving up north it was obviously the southern accent that shone through. Both me and my sis, not voluntarily, have molded an accent of our own if you will. This is not like how twins make up a secret language incase anyone is thinking along them lines, it is simply outside influences affecting our vocal chords I suppose lol. But then the contrasting dialects become intermingled also, i hope you can appreciate my point of view. Both me and my sister graded very well in English nevertheless but I've become lazy towards ,generally being aware, of all that in recent years. My sis now just has a constant telephone voice haha.

Right that's already a wall of text. My point is I can change accents and dialects like the wind depending on who I'm talking to, it;s just adaption and noone has ever had a problem understanding me.

A friend once mixed two of my own vinyls together in such a way I was convinced he had something plugged into the back of the mixer at least! Then I found comfort In simply thinking 'That sounded a lot like my.... comfort gone, it was my tune! I'd only played them a handful, but still we have keen ears us dj's right? My point is, no amount of phrasing can do that, that's a combination of all sort's of different controlled changes he made that he intended, not for a smooth transition at all, but for a completely separate section of music altogether to come through. He literally picked his instruments like you would in any DAW and layered them up to an extent I didn't think capable. Complete use of the tools at his disposal I guess.

I still don't think this is actually phrasing we're talking about, good phrasing is just knowing, or feeling rather, and using the optimal moment to bring a track in. You have to structure a mix, you can't set the next tune off at the beginning of the break for it to drop when the last song's break is finishing over and over and over again. You'd drive yourself mad let alone the audience, but some people will work their way through ideal cue point's till they're dropping tunes in starting from beyond the break, like making 4 tunes mixed sound like 1 song. That's what I understand phrasing to be. I know where you're coming from and think I know what you mean, like comparing Jimi's little wing to vais if you get the reference, Jimi is more sensitive timbre wise, at least I think that is what separates them. If my perception of phrasing is wrong in any way though please correct me, I didn't have anyone to teach me and by the time you're mixing with new friends that are clearly skilled but insist you still play because 'they were at your stage once too' you tend to forget all about asking the little things because DJ's like that will have forgotten more than I'll ever know about mixing probably.",2016-02-23 14:20:36+00:00,d0aktvo,10.0,t1_d0a59jx,40726.0,DJs

418,"I agree with your first statement but it is really a very loose term where I'm situated and not a firm unwavering statement like phrasing.
Those aren't the only two possibilities, someone in here said they got there's from mates and from a label with an allowance etc. besides if you had any idea the cost of DAWs, plugins or hardware it's hardly a reimbursement.
I didn't say anything about producer A or B so I don't know where you got that from.
I said at some point earlier 'I'll call it what it is, stolen' and thank's to everyone's help I will be joining a dj pool when the question I asked is cleared up.
I don't care if you care, I frankly don't give a rats arse what you think, I believe I was justifying it to ease my conscience also in the hopes I'd skip some negativity, as I'd already used the word stolen I think I fessed up then but every comment you've made in here has been negative in some way or about phrasing, no one else has and the post was about harmonic mixing.

419,"Then you would enjoy Tubular Bells in it's entirety, really cool track :) amongst countless other songs that use phrases which is probably a lot of them and like I say, if growing up listening to music you didn't pick up on it you can't go out and learn it, easily anyway. Anyway, I know what phrasing is, I've been a guitarist for the most part of my life, I don't look at a wheel when popping off a solo but I think it's important in mixing and good for those who use it.

If anyone wanted to try and learn it you could record every single mix you do and find what you liked about it that you did different to the last one/couple, but, at the end of the day you either know where you're going with a mix or you don't and that's not at all a bad thing, if you don't get phrasing so bloody what, if you're having fun and so is your audience, then you do you rather than listen to any advice on being taken on a journey.

What if your audience doesn't dig the beginning of your journey, you can't just keep going, you need to switch it up, they might react negatively to another tune later, unless you're mixing on you're own or recording a mix, you're the one getting taken on a journey really. Just my opinion though.

After nailing beatmatching the next best thing to get down is setting your own rhythm with your eq's. You may have heard a track before, but some DJ's can make you hear it the way they want you to hear it and in turn it's almost a new track.",2016-02-23 02:24:45+00:00,d0a3rhk,8.0,t1_d09yfqz,7831.0,DJs

Probably should spend more time reading about it though so I don't think I'm onto something cool that apparently the whole world knows about.

422,"See I thought the whole Harmonic thing was still on the down low or something. I've a mate who's releasing tunes, put on his own nights, now has a slot at a big club every wkend, hell, even did music production at uni. He said ""He'd heard of it!"" Where are you, could it be a UK thing?

What's difficult about phrasing, I'm not sure I'm with you on that because isn't that really just feeling the music and knowing when and what's gonna sound good, you can't really learn that can you? That is to say, you've got to have heard the tunes first unless you follow waveforms or the light and dark black sections of a vinyl lol.

Whether it's a esoteric tool or a well known noobish tool, like many say, there isn't a lot of key elements to many edm genres and my ear struggles to pick up on it alot of the time, so yeah, I use harmonic mixing 99% of the time, the only time I don't is when I get out the old dusty fav's on vinyl and have a spin on my 1210's because they don't have a master tempo, so if I did know the key, after beat and phrase matching, it wouldn't matter because they'd be out of tune.

Edit: Ah! Noobs, do you mean the guys who are just grabbing controllers and laptops and everythings done for them, including the matching from what I hear? Then yes I know what you're on about. Them controllers are surely reserved for those who've learnt the rest yet there's dudes getting paid who have only ever known controllers and software. :S",2016-02-22 23:36:28+00:00,d09wyyq,6.0,t1_d09uxj0,2982.0,DJs

I still like to hear Mala drop changes or Icicle drop dreadnaught. My poop understanding may be wrong though as my understanding is, let's say, there's ten in a poop and want 30 tracks, they'll buy 3 each and share the rest of them in the poop, but I could have poops all wrong.

436,"Ah right! Then I was drunk when I wrote that, real real drunk...ahem!

No but seriously, I've bought my fair share of music, even today as my mates just got a new EP up on beatport, not a huge fan of his chosen genre but you best believe for a mate I bought it in FLAC. 

Now, I'm not defending myself, but, I was studying when I got most of my Dubstep, before it went into the charts and in turn itself became chart like, and the little spare money I had was seeing my fav artists live. I could see three top of the Dubstep charts artist's between a monday and a friday; and for the price of admission in them clubs disreagrding drink's etc ;) , I could have bought the vinyl, 1210's back then; and downloaded the mix for free off their own damn facebooks.

I do use torrents, I get it if people don't want to own up to that because there's collectors out there who have never done this and will hate the ground you/I walk on, if i was these guys i would too, but I'm not and I do. Regardless though, if I download a torrent that turns out to be a show stopper, not literally/bedroom dj here, you better believe i'll whip that beauty up, but not the mp3 cos I've already got that, the vinyl special edition picture disk yah know the whole trimmings, sometimes the t-shirt to match, so a little less hate my way is earned maybe, if not maybe a little understanding from my angle, but I don't expect it and certainly don't demand it? Thoughts welcome.

I wasn't smart enough to seperate my paid from my, I'll call it what it is, stolen music so if I ever came to gigging is there an offline app i can run my music through to find out, or should I just press delete all now and get spending? Do people actually gig with tunes on a five finger discount, how would anyone know, top producers are often caught using cracked vst's and even DAWS when they are more than capable of buying a copy for each of us so them guys probably did. My conscience is difficult enough in my bedroom, but just for shits n giggles whats the scenario?

Edit: Genuinely sucks sometimes, in my bedroom, when I have a flawless mix and everything sounds perfect, I go to master it and it barely needs doing because my levels were so damn on point. Then I think, I'll upload this one and then when I realise the mix could have been done with all paid tunes or none, it hits me.

Only person who lost out was me, so now I'll give anything at least a couple of minutes, simply because I realised what I was missing.

More pertinent though, I sometimes like to grab enough tracks of a genre I'm not particularly fond of to have a mix because I've noticed you pick up on things that add to your favoured genres mixes, if anyone gets me say 'I' but please don't make me put that into words lol.

I might have 'policed' ebay but I'm the friendly bobby on the beat. They were from the same place as me so same time and between the item going up, me messaging them and me reporting them, I could see alterations being made to the page. So, they had chosen to ignore my message. Maybe not.

If I was setting a DVS up it means at that time I'd probably be getting my Technics sorted shortly anyway so If I find the process clunky too It wouldn't or shouldn't be a problem for too long. I'm really enjoying the newish freedom of cd's at the moment and like I said above, just to get that sort of rythmn down, I think they'd be best in me adding a channel onto my mixes because I find them easy to use and should be easier again once I can cue up a track vinyl style but push it off with the play/pause accuracy.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I knew about the time code cd's and vinyl simply because I stumbled across some awesome looking vinyl with no attributed artist or song, sounds really dumb now lol really dumb.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I think a controller like the vestax VCI range would be my thing because I'm no stranger to midi-mapping and I'd find it other uses i.e. Control of a DAW,  but I think I'd miss the mixing aspect at it's most basic, the beatmatching phrasing etc. Really just getting it right and buzz over it a little.

The 800mk2's have vinyl mode and to me, as I learnt on and mainly used 1210's for a lot of years is what I personally want to buy, in fact that's common and the 400 and 350 jog wheels on vinyl mode don't feel right to me.

467,"So do you have anywhere I could try, The few places I did find it  just wasn't economically viable, all computer repair stores actually, Only one Electrical store worked out, they were an official Pioneer service centre, but just for the tv's. They had an engineer upstairs though who said because of their age he can imagine what's inside and will do it all for me to pick up the next day. He had my business, 20 pound a player, depending on whether he ordered from uk or europe it wouldv'e been 20 or 3.99 added on each deck, but the guy couldn't help himself, it wasn't greed, the guy just literally has no business. Suddenly he was to charge me double after saying he didn't know anything about them and not visibly looking in a book, on his phone or anything ... suddenly knew that they were, get this lol, 20 years old and needed parts modernised, and that was if he could even get the schematics which he highly doubted. They came out 2004 I'm certain. Anyway, found schematics and parts within 30 seconds on the internet and took the cases off myelf and stripped em.

Well, I'm still non the wiser. I did fix a cue button along the way butt that's it I mean they didn't even need a dust after all these years and owners, just some flux removing from the edge of a cue button which was causing it to feel like it needed a tact switch replacing and, you could tell by the screws, It's not been apart in a good 3 years at least. I'm willing to pay courier at this point so where do you take your stuff to get it fixed? They'll be my best bet, I mean, you didn't even realise it was hard to get hold of a repair service let alone a one that won't attempt to rob you blind rob you blind. Could you get a website tome or at least a phone number. Cheers mate.

Anyone considering 200's to move from Vinyl to learn cdj think twice. There are companies out there that famously copy Pioneer, infact nearly all of them; and you won't get bored with them as quickly either because they have a few, tacky but better than none, modern advancements built in. Pitch fader, Wheel, loop buttons etc. are in the same place with all the copies, the 200 imho is a fantastic piece of equipment, but just not econimcally a sound investment. You're copies arent exactly gonna hold there value, but they shouldn't be breaking anytime soon and if so, take them back!",2016-02-13 09:20:28+00:00,czybxk5,,t1_czboyyd,,DJs

After looking though the midi/audio effects I think I'll be fine. The spectrum analyser is a nice touch for finding the keys for my samples, similar to an old waves plugin actually. Also, I would usually rely on another software to master but this has it all! I think I'm gonna like this. I do have one more question however, after a quick search there's multiple methods to achieving midi slicing i.e. MPC style, which one is the best in terms of accuracy, quality and user friendliness and can the samples then be set to hang on the last note? Thanks in advance.

EDIT: Quick add on whilst I remember, i get that it can be used to mix, and I'm guessing with midi mapping that would be fun but are their any ways to run either TT's or cdjs through?

I've never soldered before. Now taking the two in for repair is 40 pound as soon as you walk in the door. For the age of them and the price I got them for second hand it just isn't economically viable, which is a shame because i've ordered an 800mk2 and intend to order a second and fancied keeping one of these, firstly because they're the same colour (I can be rediculous) and secondly because, although I've used 1210s for years before getting these a year back, i want to move up to three channel mixing and believe that for me 3 cdjs will be the best way to get to grips with it. Back to the reason the wah buttons went, being that I picked up the wrong cleaner, how would it have caused the wah white switch to shorten, it happened on both decks instantly as well because it wasn't long after I had a mix and realised; and also why do jet and zip still work fine but the wah button can jump to them and then they're jumping between themselves when i'm pressing the wah button and again when i'm pressing there own buttons to stop them it's as if they're just joining in with the wah lol?

Yeah standard is what I would need, but for the things important to me that, actually, intro doesn't offer I believe, whilst time consuming, there are work arounds; For example ,take the lack of slicing in intro, there are many other ways and programs to slice and dice as perfect as ableton would and then just load them in. Again, only two send tracks? In a previous project of ableton apply the desired effects and record. Could you then not add that altered sound that will be within the bundle of that previous project once you've saved it? Intro will be limiting for me, as my money will be shortly thanks to needing a lot of dj equipment repairing/servicing, but hopefully that will make me more inventive and when the time comes that I have spare money again and can upgrade to standard or indeed suite, though I feel your really paying for max which I have at the moment no interest in, I will appreciate it all the more; and may have future uses for the work arounds I came across or simply the then acquired inventive mind set.

     Looking back over your posts can you find a single instance that pertains to the help I requested? Do you believe you have been of aid in the slightest? There's times people have a multitude of things on their mind and in turn it imposes on their focus, naturally, which is why I posted here in the first place. Your first post was nothing but discouraging and the follow up inferred you were trying to make sense of some hapless idiot. Taking into account you had chosen to not even answer a question regarding an issue you yourself raised, think notepad, it stands to good reason you haven't the knowledge to help in any case any way. After the first few odd criticisms I continued to be gracious you'll notice, but if you yourself read each opening line of yours you may begin to appreciate how rude you've been. I really hope you don't conduct yourself this way when people usually ask for help, humble yourself man, every one needs help at some point and you should only ever look down at someone when you're trying to help them up.

559,"The program I got was a DAW, same one I've used for years, same set up exactly, downloaded from same source exactly. This worked fine for hours after, shut down laptop for night. turned on laptop next day and it was immediately apparent something was wrong, almost at a hundredth less the speed, explorer didn't even give off its chime. Any typical noises sounded like they were being slowly let through some ones hold on a vinyl. Booted in safe to uninstall the DAW and also check system config i.e. what was set to startup, recently updated or installed programs or drivers. Other than said DAW nothing. I honestly believe the DAW was just a last straw. Everything changed when I installed rainmeter which after a short play around with I realised and uninstalled, this was weeks before. In that meantime I had to , educate myself firstly, lend kernels or w/e from hardrive to memory. Realised this helped very little and read alot of opposing opinions so set it back to windows control. Btw when I mentioned the program known for being a trouble with RAM i meant the DAW not some rinky dink memory extension, who doesn't that these are garbage? DAW's so far only work with 4gb max, i only have 3 but have always managed, many people run off and upgrade to 8 which I intend to do, but for other reasons, then complain that their DAW is still slow, well that's your computer not the DAW or your RAM, not sure what it is exactly mind you, guideline easiest is download old versions of DAW's. The notepad problem, what should the extensions be?

562,"Well thanks, lol but I think the joking about is more a coping thing at this point as I lost alot of stuff, though, reading it back is a bit slapstick. Well, from what I can remember disk check etc. all indicated everything was fine. But sure I had missed something I tried sfc /scannow which alerted me each time I tried this that I could not because something 'something related was doing something.' Sorry man, that's the clearest thing coming through but I do remember alot of people had this same issue with SFC with the same prior symptoms. From then on I was booting in safe and poking around at latest drivers etc. It was like something was inside pulling wires because through no obvious reason each boot became more difficult and restricted till the furthest I could boot was F2 or F8. I think I then just tried everyones ideas on youtube, at least if they had trust worthy faces knowing me. I will be honest and say that, that night I procured a program out of the traditional means which no matter the company or version or OS it's used on causes ram problems, but that program, thinking now, was just a final straw, wrong place wrong time. A, that program has been on and off my laptop for years, exact same release even, all the problems with memory and teaching myself how to lend off the hardrive etc. Started weeks before when I got rainmeter. It was quickly uninstalled of course with me letting windows do the memory stuff automatically from then on. Neway, I can't remember how I learnt this bit, but it was my hardrive that was the problem, maybe not when i could get on in safe mode, but like I said It deteriorated quick. My next mission was putting an oem win 7 on a usb to use after I removed my stuff with Lucid Puppy that booted from a disc I made on another computer in the house, the latter me learning on the spot talking to the google microphone on my s4. Ive still got them files, can't make sense of what to do with them, nor do I any longer care, I wish I'd just done the fresh install and have gotten done with it. My home premium is straight up, no worries there. Anyway, laptops fine now, except 'this I learned after posting just earlier on' i can't save stuff written in notepad unless it's saved to HTML? Erm, n yes the phone I actually have some grabs I tried to send off to chrome, but who the hell do you send them off to. Monkey, laptop and infinite time might've gotten someone to reply. It was literally just me pressing chrome on phone and a white screen with black words, no matter how fast and for how long i flicked down, it was bottomless. It opened on about kernels, i assume that's ram talk and when I went to the browser chrome screen, there was a link to go back and something about reading NTF or NTFS files just to the right. Sorry for the essay and almost complete lack of punctuation but I'm also keep fighting a Picasa program simultaneously as it is addiment it is uploading every photo and video to google plus. Actually no, im back to the shoes, definately the health app in tiny in the corner of one shoe but there's no options to stop sync with either. Oh and my location keeps changing :S Again sorry; and cheers for your time.
