I didn't think the move from 4100 to 48 would be noticeable or maybe it's just better with my monitors i.e static wise but I'd like advice on what driver to use in live for both the above reasons?

I've tried USBCODEC which I believe was the default on my old acer aspire 5738z, the latest behringer 2.8.40 drivers which are about the same latency wise and asio4all which was perfect if it wasn't for it taking exclusive control. Is there a middle ground for asio4all where it'll play all applications using sound as that's handy for tutorials aswell as being great on latency whether recording or adding multiple midi players?

For some reason, even though I'm not an Ableton beginner or anything, I realised I know very little about what to do with a DJ mix once it is recorded in. I've only ever used it for , may I add attempting, production and audacity for recording.

I realise now how much better live is compared to audacity as I had been having a severe issue with audio drops and other than normalising when a mix was successful I've never really gotten into all the rest and it seems that most youtube videos either all agree on the most technical methods (how would i even know lol) and disagree on the quick tidying methods.

I'm asking specifically regarding UK Deep Dubstep but I'm pretty confident the audio veterans out there will be able to hook me up in any genre.
So far I have chopped the beginning and ends off of the audio and added an EQ Three (only have the lite version of live 9 to work with sadly) I've moved the bass level to 0.50 the mids to -1 and the treble to -0.75 and it made more of a difference than I would generally expect from such tweaks.

Anyway, that's when it finally hit me, other than any tips on giving your mix the final treatment can anyone help me with the final volume before you upload, not like fully mastering the mix but the basics, you know?

I only ask because I realised when changing from my monitors to my 5.1's, which I'm told is good, trying a sound on different speakers and also definitely trying it on speakers the general population have, anyway, I nearly hit the ceiling. SO, so, loud!
When I open a film or music in VLC for instance it has a volume level set somewhere in the middle by default and you can change this default volume in VLC's settings but I firstly don't want people jumping out of their skin, the opposite of what the genre is trying to achieve lol; and secondly, people shouldn't have to know how to fiddle with all these settings to listen to some damn mix done by someone they barely know and don't know why they even have them on Facebook lol!

I've recently been using this horrible stuff in the UK we call fet which is amphetamine sulphate, comes as a paste so you can bomb it or let it dry and snort it. In any case, it doesn't do allot and can only begin to imagine what lovely healthy things this includes :S

If it's a problem copying and pasting it again here just say, new and not clued up with how people generally post here yet.

Hi, noticed this had been up voted so thought I'd follow up with a quick TR.
First off, I have spent the best part of this year abusing 4f-mph and for a month or so before that, MPA. I'm not always like this but, let's say I was having a hard time and didn't deal with it very well, like at all. I understand 4f-mph to be a norinephrine re-uptake inhibitor so don't think this would effect the trip but I had taken some 3-FPM for a few days before it, as well as trying Phet which is, IMHO, a waste of time and money. So, to the point then!

I received 3 of these for £30 and noticed they were very brittle and remembered that the doves I took back in the day were this way too though the doves seemed twice as thick, like they were a big mac, these a happy-meal burger. Other than what I've mentioned my experience is high with drugs that are primarily serotonergic i.e. Cathinones such as 4mmc (mcat) or the main one ofcourse, MDMA, they are my chem of choice. However, until this recent year I have not touched anything beyond the odd J in roughly 5 years, the last thing I took, what were being nicknamed at the time, Super-pills which were a tenner and were just okay ( I see where I thought these were a good idea now.)

I decided to play it cautiously and took only one. There was no rush or come up at all really but after taking a shower I did notice I was a bit 'up' but no real extra empathy and I had actually planned to play on my decks but looking at them was tiring to be honest, as was music, I actually just sat trying to decide what to do. Not long after this a very bad comedown hit, it drove me to stick the second 'comedown pill' under my tongue and once that had dissolved I took the last along with it. Following this I drank, smoked and did basically anything to try and escape this, I mean I've had more comedowns than any one person should really have but this was plain old hell (though them doves, possibly london doves or am-hi-co, never did so the theory of bullshit pills and comedowns I tend to support.) To give you an idea of how quick this happened it was roughly 9pm that I took the first one and about 10.15 when I panic dosed the other two which just fed the decent. This nightmarish chapter lasted until about 11:30 am but everytime I had a remotely pleasant thought I felt the little serotonin I had longingly regained drain away. Sleep did not come until about 4pm that day which was brought on desperately (thought it still fought back) by half a ridiculously strong hypnotic rc benzo called Flubromazolam (zolam, not pam) which no one should ever take, not even a warning yawn usually and if you're curious further you'll see that google searches of it tend to be horror stories. Still took a while to drift off. 2 and a half hours later I woke up wired and still monumentally down. After forcing some food down an hour later I went out again, this time unaided, but only till about 11pm where I knew I'd gotten all I'd get. Of course I was up all night again, pretty lonely on a comedown too.

So, oh what a night that was. It's very possible, hell, probable that the 3-FPM and Phet had already set about depleting my serotonin but I had noticed that the 4F-MPH didn't even give me the slightest of euphoria anymore either, just angst ridden jitters so maybe my body was simply all out of happiness. But, does anyone really want to chance that after what I've said? As obvious it may be that it was caused by prior tolerance, Doves I would use on a nightly basis, sometimes up to a week or more at a time and they just barely worked towards the end, no comedown, again supporting the bullshit pills theory as I'd be left with an okay afterglow actually. This is not supposed to be encouraging to anyone or the opposite, this is simply about being safe, sensible and sharing experiences, especially bad ones (though best not to risk having them) in which, as I received no replies, I took it upon myself to retrieve this knowledge for the greater good, or something like that lol. Use my behaviour mentioned as a guide and just do the opposite lol, not just regarding the pills that led to my previous worsed comedown being times by a hundred but in general. If anyone has actually had a positive roll with these I'd be interested to hear about it but I'd honestly not even consider it guys and there's no excuse because these now have a TR!

I'm using an Acer aspire 5738 64bit with windows 10, pentium dual-core, 4gb ram and a HL-DT-ST DVDRAM GT30N disc drive. The problem may or may not be with the latter as I have hit a problem using cdburnerxp version 4.5.7.6282, though i've read posts to suggest it may actually be this. I'm using this to burn 16 bit 41kb wav files as an audio cd onto verbatim azo discs. The cd's are being burnt for use with cdjs and so personally I burn two copies of each disc, this I set in cdburnerxp. I always set to burn at a low speed which was initially 8x but noticed my cdjs had a little lag on the jog wheel i.e when manually reversing tracks it sticks now and then and so I selected 1x to see if that helped. Well the problem is this (after going through 20 discs I notice it though lol) after my first disc ejects half way through i get the notification to insert my second disc, this i do and have thought nothing of the process. At the end of the burn which I found quick I noticed a message that said burned successfully at 24X !!! I don't know if that was both discs, the second one only, if it matters or how many discs have met this fate? So, as I had one more EP to burn I thought I would see if I could check between discs, unfortunately I couldn't get past the notifivcation to insert the next disc until I had done that and it had started burning but when I could select burn options to check the settings the burn speed had changed to 16X this time. This could mean each and every one of my burns, since I was recommended moving from using itunes to burn to something better, are different speeds.

So, my questions are if anyone knows why this is happening? If it is just the second disc then obviously unselecting 2 copies and just manually triggering the second burn should work right? Is there a way for me to check which discs got this treatment if it actually matters? Finally, just so I know my cds don't have any hiccups being read, have the expected quality of the lossless original files and last a long time could you reccomend me the best free burning software and it's recommened settings for my need? I've heard EAC is great but quite in-depth.

Text box would be best for me but I imagine it would take ages (any voice disguising plug-ins actually lol?) Also it would be cool if we can use the same method in real time too i.e. I can see his screen so I can see if he is following along okay and in turn hopefully he'll find watching my screen with a vocal or text cue beneficial. I know by learning through tutorials I would often have to keep jumping back in a vid where they may have gone a little too quick to follow or far too quick because it was a minor detail they assumed you'd know. I often wished I could just sit down one to one with someone with that level of understanding of the program and pick their brain. Whilst I'm not particularly a skilled DAW ...hobbyist? I'm confident I can at least give someone the basics, hoppefully without the stress of each of us writing super long messages back and forth. I was also wondering, is it practical for people to work on tracks together this way or does latency play a big factor here. Unknown territory for me but I'm aware some of the big producers work together on projects without ever actually meeting one another. So using this setup, could we work on a track together or would we both need overclocked setups basically?

So I've really only got OBS so far on the list, any good? Classic or Studio? I tried manycam or something similar in the past but you had to pay to get text removed and I think I recall having to line the audio up afterwards :S which would be a nightmare for this so a free software is preferable but I'm happy to listen to reason.

So yeah any advice on what program to use, maybe a few tips on setting it up and tutorial advice if you've got it guys, start out with maybe putting together a drum rack and then build said track or..?

Last night i took it fairl easy compared to usual. I had a little 4f-mphbut mainly took 3-fpm. Tonight i used the last of my mdai in two doses that was mixed in with TPA or Thiopropamine, a rather week yet cleaner analogue of MPA. Rather than hit the bottom I think If I dose something else that is serotonergic in nature I'll glide oiut of the other side and into a deep sleep.

Now, I've taken a dibf 50 mg pellet months ago and found the initial rush very much like that of an empathogen though it seemed the come up was confusing firstly which was not unlike dissassociatives. After that passed I remember just having epiphany after ephany, still though Minus that almost ketty style moment in felt somewhere between mdai and mdma so I'm guessing it isn't that trippy of a drug. I have 250 mg in powdered form and whilst I'm exhausted I'm pretty sure I'm gonna struggle to get to sleep after the comedown hits hard so would I be okay dosing some. 1plsd did cause me an epileptic fit however, but I had only just taken a 25ug quarter and gotten my first ever visuals before waking up covered in blood where as my first try with it weeks before I dosed 75 ug to no avail. I had been up longer than this too and although I was told it was a bad idea I took the quarter trip after having spent 3-4 days maybe? Ingesting 4f-mph.
Do you guys think a 40 mg dose would be okay? Also, what of the blotters I have left, will I be okay if it was taken while I was generally fresh, i.e. no full nights inbetween and nothing else in my system except maybe a beer or a few?

I would like to be able to use this to watch films too, I typically use vlc for this on my current laptop and often output to TV via HDMI.

I don't want to put a number here as I've literally no idea but if it's as good as my laptop except improved cpu then I want to spend the minimal, mainly to just build my first desktop computer with the plans to improve it when i can afford it.

* Tower, OS, Keyboard, good audio soundcard with possibly up to 10.1 capabilities if that's needed. Not important for DAW as I use an external soundcard.

* UK.

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.**

* I've a usb mouse laying around lol. I have sufficient storage already if that helps i.e. Kingston usb sticks and a mypassport external hardrive.

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

* Other than what the name suggests I don't really understand this sort of thing but am interested in it nevertheless. If it speeds up system allot and isn't a fortune this is something I would definitely be keen on learning and having.

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

* Not specifically, just what I've mentioned if possible thanks unless any of you guys have a burning suggestion or idea?

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* Pretty lights, honestly! 

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

* Win 10 if poss or is it cheaper to get 7 then upgrade, if that's still possible that is?

My sister looked after some mice for a friend over xmas and it turned out the friend was from canada so as shes finished uni here in the uk my sister offered to take them. Can't believe someone would get pets abroard knowing they aren't staying, maybe she didn't expect them to live this long but thats an odd mind frame to have going into the responsibility anyway but I'll save my opinions and get to the pooint.

We've only had them back a couple weeks and one of them simply isn't well with the symptoms mentioned in the title and with hindsight when she wouldn't take a nut off me a week back I should have rang someone but as my sister had been playing with them and the mouse in question had taken a nut off her too it was just put down to being full, plus at xmas this mouse was fat and lazy the other athletic and constantly hungry too lol. I've read this could be a respiratory infection, she seemes to be bruxing and bobbling which seems to be good for rats but bad news with mice. She won't take water from me with na oral syringe, or the cages water bottle and the same goes for food. I've cleaned the cage out completely incase there was too much saw dust in the wood shavings and incase it was [particularly filthy somewhere but it all seemed fine, physically she looks fine too i.e. no hurt limbs etc. but shes skin and bone, the other has become the fat and lazy one now btw but obviously this isn't a complete role reversal as theres no energy in the newly thin one.

Serotonins showing no signs of life, highly depressed last night  i took a 50 mg 5 meo dibf pellet. It gave me some amazing realizations and my levels seem to be a little higher but... still crazy low.

The 75mg spaced out was with my sciatica meds dihydrocodeine and a tad bit 4f-mph and pyrazolam. No idea what to expect, just yawning giggles, very relaxed, for maybe an hour or so. So i thought nothing of taking the 25 during the night after my bday where id had some mdai and 4f-mph.

Unfortunately the beginning of that chemical depression was my first seizure in ten years. My mum found me and said it lasted 40 mins.
75ug and it wasnt a problem last corner actually months later and it is? Or it was the mix? The 50 mg 5 meo dibf was taken out of desperation but like the seizure time, it began very ketamine like. Very confusing, still confused compared to how i was before. But passable as normal :S

Any help here please? I used to get through 30 g's of mcat in a day.

I'll order some mdai seens as the 5 meo dibf whilst spends that chemical seemed to give a little back afterwards but yep i did a lot of mdai that 2 wks back tiny 4f-mph but there was a good 3 hours between hitting it hard and the seizure. At most did 400 mdai that night btw and din't giggle nor yawn, but enjoyed visuals on mobile screen before i must have started the gran mal.

It's the kettyy feeling also lingering that's a wind up. I never got that feeling with 75 ug just with 25 ug and 50mg 5 meo dibf, oh my mum couldn't sleep.

I'm still on an old acer aspire 5738z. It has the dual core, it's 64 bit yet only came with 3 gb ram. It had windows 7, yet whilst not an accepted by acer win10 upgrade, knowhow suggested it.

Not certain if all my music is licensed as I dj and as you can imagine stuff gets swapped around, torrent clients being the quickest means, or at least the easiest means. To be safe I asked on reddit somewhere and was advised anti spybeacon before i went ahead. Did that and apart from the beacon needing an allowance here and there, perfect. Must point out though my sis had just recieved an item with a fuol free mcafee which you could then residually install on other family devices, so my phone, my laptop has that, windows firewall and mcafees did not et along at first one bit.

Jump months till now.

I've no desktop icons (found a way of removing the arrows off the icons a while back, probs not just a coincidence) no folder icons, files etc. icons either. Quick flash of black shaped like a L and then a recycle bin next to every file but thats it.

I noticed my space had dwindled to only 9 gb out of a possible 232gb but it now has 60 gb free and at this stage its taking seriously extended periods of time to open a folder, forget about listening to a song. I had several VLC windows open at one point a few months back and now, when it won't open ill go find something else to do and hit the roof when sound suddenly starts playing an hour later.

I was just going to max out the 8gb ram, because (producing music too) means it'll be alot easier and naturally cheaper  to try and fix this.
I have knowhow insurance still, but, if any of you guys can think of anything obviously wrong with my set up it'd save being without it for 2-3 weeks, it's been away longer! Infact, xmas time I didnt even risk it so following a chat on here word for word fixed my hardrive using a linux tool called lucid puppy? (Probs defo should've mentioned earlier.)

So sorry for the lack of info I know you guys need to be able to help if that's the case. I must Definitely sorry for how quickly and possibly incoherently this has possibly been written but am just dashing out to work.

Perhaps that shutter thing we have on cigarettes which I personally think 
is daft might not be so daft in this case, but in contradiction I also believe drugs have never and will never need advertising.

I admit it, i use Legal Highs or RC's which seems to be the more popular moniker so I'm happy for the obvious reason's, not only that I can get my drugs nice and easy and in the comfort of my own home without that meaning a dealer coming around for a cuppa' but because I'm A: Not breaking the law and B: Arguably rightfully able to decide what I put in my own body as long as I'm not harming nor offending others.

P.S. Whilst many are shouting and cheering in agreement with the ban they don't realise that their civil liberties are being stripped, something that may effect their selves one day. I know a rather large number of people who have never tried anything our society deems 'drugs' who share that opinion too.

Just gotten a pair of m-audio BX8 D2's and decided to start taking sound more serious instead of keep playing away, decks and DAW's, on logitech x-530's but rather than just make some stands for speakers (which I've discovered have some strict compliances) I thought I'd finally stop leaning over my mix adding to the back problems I already have.

So, this is what I know... The tweeters need to aim toward my ears about 2-3 feet away and they themselves must have ,not sure how much exactly, a clearance from the wall because they have rear facing ports and I'm also the 3rd point of an equilateral triangle? That is pretty much it.
Would like to sit to work on ableton (which is half the reason I'm being so fussy about accuracy) and stand to mix with a desk that doesn't hurt my back. It all then becomes confusing to me, I grumble about it, then it's put off another day.

Just wondered if anyone has any advice or wisdom to pass onto me to make this process a smoother one, even just rules of thumb and the likes would make all the difference?
What wood would be best, I've seen alot of mdf in use as it ideally would hold 2x1210's, 2xcdj200, 2xcdj800mk2 a mixer, a nanopad2 and a laptop into a tidy, pain free, aurally pleasing set up? Are there any templates to use, or helpful software to aid in the design aspect. Also, any sound treatment advice for a room 274x250 cm.

Apologies for the wall of text but as you can now probably tell, I don't know where to even begin and you guys most certainly do. No dramas if I don't get any responses as I'm sure you're all busy or have better things to do, but most likely just found me annoying lol.

Honestly though, getting to look at all your setups gives me genuine enjoyment, I do genuinely spend hours flicking through setups, learning about new equipment that's often presented with pride and safety, in fact making that equipment significant even when it's not. If I hadn't of discovered this sub I would've just bought something from gorrilla or had one built for me and have been done with it by now but I've built and restored things, before my bad back at least, and I believe the satisfaction will be worth it and probably outweigh the pain that in turn should improve.

I'ts cracked, a live 8 suite; and I learnt my lesson not long ago.
     I was going through the software bundle that comes with the device, genuinely happy about all the legal vsts I now had to play with, I suppose feeling rewarded for having finally spent money on this hobby. I came to a particular plugin, watched a trailer for it, thought yep I'll be playing around with that for months to come; and was just getting the prerequisite download stuff out the way when there was a mention of anti-piracy. Don't wanna add insult to injury so I'll just skim over. I turned off the net, don't know how bad it was but at least I've got the other vsts left to play with. How long do I have them though or how long will I use them if I'm always worried about losing them; and say by a stroke of sheer luck I wrote a masterpiece, what could I do with it?
     Anyway, when I think how much my mixing has improved simply because I have a better understanding of whats going on in a track or how It feels great being able to answer your own questions sometimes i.e. 'I know how they're doing that' It's time I buy it. I've really gotten very comfortable with a specific release of Ableton, as when using just the demo of 9 I tended to lose confidence and in turn interest because it seemed so daunting and unrealistic for someone such as myself, so I'd rather leave them till I've improved some more. Can I do that? Just purchase the license? Fresh install would be better I'd imagine but can I just download my favoured release wherever? Surely as long as ableton gets the payment, we're squared up right? Or is there a more uniform and (hope not) more expensive route I'm supposed to take? Just wanna get this sorted now really.

EDIT: This may or may not have been important, usually turns out to be 'very' when a sentence starts that way, but my phone came in a very small Samsung box with super thin paper included which I guess are this generations user manual. The instructions didn't tell me how to factory reset anywhere, and barely how to even turn it off, but I discovered a few different methods online.
