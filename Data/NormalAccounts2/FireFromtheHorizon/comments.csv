I was in the  basement one time when I was 17 and my mom called me up for dinner. I quickly got up and ran up the stairs and walked over to the pantry where i started to get that feeling when the blood rushes from your head or whatever that head rush is when you get up fast. I ignored the feeling and all of a  sudden I just start to fall. My mom had a couple little shelves in the door so I tried to grab on to them while I was falling, and I hit the ground and blacked out. Couple minutes later I wake up with everyone looking over me and my dad trying to wake me up  and I look at my arm. It was covered in blood from the shelves  so I just got up and washed my bloody arm. 

Very weird part of my life, and now forever on my left face of my arm is a scar. ",2016-02-23 05:59:03+00:00,d0ab5nq,1.0,t3_47599d,457.0,AskReddit
