Night 1: trouble sleeping and when I finally get to sleep and wake up it actually feels like I never slept at all.

Night 2: Tired as fuck from lack of sleep. That night I stayed up till four.

Night 3: Finally have a good night's rest. The best part about night 3 is that I noticed I had a dream. I know it doesn't sound like a big deal but when I smoked weed I never use to have dreams, so it was definitely a good experience!

Overall it is getting easier and I hope to continue to be smoke free!",leaves,Sleep after quitting.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/4aok19/sleep_after_quitting/
