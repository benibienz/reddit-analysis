9,"I think it works like this (but I'm an idiot so I could be wrong):  
For 1 year of lifting, one can get at most 20-25lbs of pure muscle mass, that's 70,000-87,500 calories surplus in a year. For pure muscle, you'd need a 240 calorie surplus to gain 25lb in a year. However, you don't just gain muscle, you have other parts of your body that gains weight, such as skeletal structure? (correct me if I'm wrong here) and water weight. Plus, if you were only gaining muscle, your BF% would lower as there is more weight for your fat to fill in. Therefore, a 400-600ish surplus would be optimal for at least your first year of lifting.  
It boils down to this: If your body can put on more muscle, eating more on your bulk is optimal. However, eating too much will just add on extra fat. When you've lifted for a while, your surplus should be less, as your body can't add on as much muscle as it could the first couple of years. If you're not fat and it's your first 1-2 years of lifting, I'd go for a 400-600 surplus.",2016-10-23 15:13:31+00:00,d94a819,1.0,t3_58yter,2067.0,Fitness

Also, I don't think God instantly damned the ""wrong"" Church after Schism. Especially when there was only Catholic OR Orthodox Churches in the area post-schism. If one lived in Italy, there was no physical way to get to an Orthodox parish each week, likewise if a Russian wanted to go to a Catholic Church. I see weeping icons in the East and Eucharistic miracles documented in the West. There are mystics in the Oriental Orthodox, Eastern Orthodox and Catholic churches post-schism.

Hotshotgg saw that the public image of the team had fallen quite a bit due to LCS preformances, specifically in the latter half of the spilt. One night, Hotshotgg awoke from a dream where he was running through an endless toys'r'us where every choking hazard sign had been replaced by a CLG logo. He awoke drenched in sweat and frantically searched for ideas to buff CLG public opinion. He was unable to come up with any ideas all night. Resigning himself to the futility of the situation, he turned on his favorite television scrubs to drown his sorrows. Suddenly a glorious idea came to Hotshot. He awoke the team and quickly piles them into the CLG van. Players on the team at the time have described hotshot as almost maniacally filled with glee during that moment. They drove to the nearest abandoned hospital and filmed this scene and it will forever grace CLG threads.

591,"Short of time so I haven't read the comments. Just want to let you know that the Catechism does not teach that you'll always be thrown into the fires of hell. Culpability, habit, etc. all contribute to lessening the severity of the sin (all mortal sin is grave, not all grave sin is mortal).  
In my opinion (but talk to the priest) you aren't in a state of mortal sin. Also, the catechism can't change its stance because it's not up to the Church to what God wills. Pedophilia would not change. What sick priest would say ""I certainly shouldn't masturbate, but instead play with children"". That just doesn't work.  
You also mentioned how we can truly confess something that you know will happen again. Isn't that with pretty much every sin? That's the reason why confession isn't just a one-time deal. Try going one day without losing your patience, gossiping, etc. Also, if something may not be a mortal sin, don't let it become easier to fall to. It's still offending Christ just like any other sin. Just don't completely beat yourself up. ",2015-08-03 14:16:16+00:00,ctpw8a2,1.0,t3_3fjqgu,60479.0,Catholicism

I just switched the card to a different PCI slot and once I installed the drivers, I moved it to the original PCI slot. This may not even happen, but I'm just letting you know.",2015-06-26 22:35:15+00:00,csjxlkp,1.0,t3_3b8uvc,388.0,pcmasterrace

716,"I'm a Roman-Catholic starting to look into Eastern Theology (Eastern Catholics/Eastern Orthodox). It's actually the same theology explained differently (yet there are differences between RCC and the EOC).  
&amp;nbsp;

Even though all of this intrigues me, it doesn't shy me away from doubts. From what I've learned, humans are planted with a desire to find the truth, to find God. It doesn't mean that we will fully embrace it and never have doubts. Your intentions are in the right place. The will to do good and to find truth is pleasing to the Lord. I'm big on miracles as well, but that shouldn't be the prime reason to join any religion. Catholics have theirs and so do the Orthodox with their Myrrh-streaming icons. Study Church history, the bible, and of course as a Catholic I'd say the Church Fathers. Hopefully the community can recommend certain things as I'm not the best at this.",2015-06-24 22:01:29+00:00,cshkfik,1.0,t3_3awr1h,68232.0,Christianity

Also, when I make a motherboard upgrade, I also want to have a CPU upgrade which would probably be Intel in the future.
