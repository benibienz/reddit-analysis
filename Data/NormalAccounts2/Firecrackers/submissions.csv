When I started doubting, it wasn't the issues themselves, but whether these teachings were real or not. Cafeteria Catholicism never made sense to me, because half assing the belief isn't really a belief at all. Eventually, I became atheist. It definitely disproves the belief that somebody knowledgeable in the faith won't ever leave.

The first time I tried it was back in May. There was a load of mosquitoes out and my tongue wasn't having the best time. I didn't have a horrible tongue bite, but a little one that was there.

&amp;nbsp;  
Today I tried it out again. I loved it! I still got a bit of a tingle on the tongue, but it isn't as bad. I smoked very slow, but the tobacco may still be too moist? Not so sure. I opened it a month or two ago, but never aired it out. I haven't ever smoked anything before, and only got a bit of a buzz (which was nice, nothing too bad). A Missouri corn cob pipe is great for starting out. However, I still get a bit of a tingle on the tongue (I feel it more when I'm brushing my teeth). Could this be the tobacco being too moist? It doesn't sound dry and rubbing it out feels a bit moist. However, I think it was an enjoyable experience.",PipeTobacco,Thank You!

I'm just trying to think of this when I think of the Orthodox Church rejecting the Immaculate Conception. We both believe she was sinless. They and the Eastern Catholics have different perspectives, but Western Theology talks of Original Sin. What do we disagree on?

I got the card yesterday and have been messing with it ever since. When first putting it in, I noticed the card idles around 60C, and only moves a couple of degrees when playing Battlefield 4. The fan is never above 40% in games, and is usually 0-5% browsing reddit/youtube/OSRS.  
&amp;nbsp;

I have an FX-8350 in my system with an ASRock 970 EXTREME4 mobo. Playing BF4 on full Ultra (sometimes with 2x MSAA) could allow me to average 70, 80, 90, 100 FPS depending on the map. With Mantle, I did see the card around 100%, so the 8350 isn't a ""bottleneck"". However, going to Direct3d made the GPU usage a little jumpy (80-100%) on my system. Playing a 64 man server, Siege of Shanghai with Direct3d and maxed would give me 60-80FPS. This felt a little low.  
&amp;nbsp;

I haven't tinkered too much with it yet, but these are my initial impressions. I don't know if 61 C idle with 0-5% fan speed is good, but that's what I'm seeing. If something seems wrong here, please let me know! I'm not really qualified to do a review, but people asked to see my experience with it.  
&amp;nbsp;

Edit: I play my games @ 1080p 144Hz. I came from 2 r9 270s in Crossfire, which gave me little to no performance gain with BF4. I believe it had to do something with my motherboard. Dips in FPS were a big pain, so I'm selling those and keeping the 390.",pcmasterrace,"So, I got the R9 390 (Small Review Request)",http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/3az30d/so_i_got_the_r9_390_small_review_request/
