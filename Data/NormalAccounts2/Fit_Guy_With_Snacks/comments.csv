This one was a few listings down from the Bronco/Mustang, but haven't posted it because I don't want to come across as spam-y. Maybe tomorrow. ",2016-09-30 15:11:14+00:00,d88d8op,2,t1_d88cz67,363,Shitty_Car_Mods

4,"That's good to hear. I test drove an 09 Canyon earlier this week that had 144,000 miles on it. Immidietely fell in love with it but ultimately had to walk away because it had a little too much rust for my liking. The dealer had done quite a bit of service on it, so I'm not sure if they all hold up well at that mileage or they just put exceptional effort into it. Your comment is encouraging that they may hold up well. I'd like to personally get at least 100,000 miles out of whatever I end up getting.",2016-09-24 01:39:15+00:00,d7znqo2,2,t1_d7zm68v,2911,Trucks
5,"I ended up not buying them because of this. They seem to go for a couple a bucks a piece, but when I scanned eBay while in the store, there were hundreds of listings with zero bids. It was a cool find, but I have no need for them and there doesn't seem to be a big enough market to try and flip them.",2016-09-14 00:34:37+00:00,d7ls5da,2,t1_d7lhg0v,14961,ThriftStoreHauls

The thing is I have until 4PM Saturday to cancel it, but that'll be too soon to know if the race is on or not. On the up side, Regardless of the race happens or not, I now have a hotel and don't need to do 11 hours of driving in one day.",2016-08-19 04:02:56+00:00,d6nmvq0,4,t1_d6nklj1,3627,INDYCAR
