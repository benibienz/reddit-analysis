I'm trying to buy my first truck and have always been fond of the Ranger. Literally everyone I've talked to so far has said something along the lines of ""Oh I used to drive a Ranger!"" Is it just a stage of life nobody told me about? Am I required to own at least 1 Ranger in my lifetime? Is It like an 11th Commandment? ""Thou shall not kill. Thou shall not steal. Thou shall own a Ford Ranger."" Not complaining about it at all, it's just funny that it has gotten to the point where I can open up a conversation with anyone and assume they own or have owned a Ranger at some point and I wouldn't be wrong.",fordranger,TIL: Everyone has owned a Ranger,https://www.reddit.com/r/fordranger/comments/549qio/til_everyone_has_owned_a_ranger/

I was hoping the wonderful community that is r/Trucks could tell me what they know and how they feel about them. My web searches on Canyons/Colorados has shown a pretty even split of people who love them and hate them.

This particular truck is a 3.7L I5 4-speed automatic. It has just over 70,000 miles on it and the asking price is $16,000 (should be able to bring that down + trade-in value of current car). Thoughts? Is it worth persuing? Is there anything I should be on the look for when I go to see it in person? I'm not the most mechanically inclined person so not entirely sure what I should be checking for.
