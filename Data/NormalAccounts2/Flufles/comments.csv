0,"There are places that do it the right way, and use fresh cloths (Never use a brush on paint). We do, and so do a few places I know.  My cars only get touched by my staff, or one other place which I've recommended to some redditors and they've had great experiences.

Yes in the gas stations there is no eye for quality, but it isn't their fault, management believes quantity over quality, the guys are given a quota to meet, and they have a quota for everything, for example they can't just replace a cloth, it has to meet certain criteria before it's replaced.  So management has put in these policies, and the poor guy who gets MAYBE AED1000 a month has no choice but to follow it, or risk loosing his job",2016-11-06 11:44:27+00:00,d9o1ag6,5.0,t1_d9o13qr,684.0,dubai
1,"NO automatic wash is better for the paint than a hand wash.  And even then, the standard tradition for a hand wash here is not the right way.

Its easy to find out how to do it correctly, but look up '2 bucket' method, thats is one way to do it correctly.

A lot of it depends on the products you're using as well.  I know what they use in the automatic car washes over here, and trust me when I tell you this, its not good for your paint.

5,"I never had a chance to drive the first gen GTS, but having owned the S version some changes would apply right across the board. 

The 958 was a total redesign, shedding weight and adding a ton of technology. They paired it with the 8 speed, which is lightening fast (and even faster in the 958.2!). It feels like a totally different vehicle, the 957 is equally happy off-road as it is on-road. The transfer case with a real low range offering was amazing. I loved that and used it a lot!  With the 958 they got rid of the transfer case, but kept the locking differentials. I do wish it had a low range option at times, but can understand why it doesn't. Porsche must have realized very few Cayennes ever go off-road. 

On-road the 958 is totally different. Everything from the vehicle dynamics to the way it drives has been changed. It's more of an on-road performer now, you need to drive one to feel the changes. Everything from the standard sport exhaust (which is ridiculously loud), to the technology you can equip has propelled it into one of the segment leaders (Atleast over here in the GCC). 

The 957 is still a great vehicle, there are times when I wish I had kept the S around, as it really could hold its own off-road, and happily took all the abuse I threw at it. Yeah I never had it around the track, but it wasn't meant for this purpose (I had 19's with tires suited to being off-road rather than on).

6,"The Macan is a phenomenal vehicle. It really does dominate the mid size crossover class IMO. I'd gladly add a Turbo to my garage, but I find the Macan too small for my needs. I have a dog (GSD), and she needs more room to be comfortable. Also I do go off-road and the Cayenne is much better performer, it's the most versatile vehicle I've ever had. It's been up mountains, and around race tracks. I love them and will continue owning them as long as I can. 

I personally only drive in sports mode, with the PASM set to normal. That's my daily setup. With PASM set to sport, it's a night and day difference. The entire vehicle tightens up and I can't be sure on this, but when the suspension is set to sport, it's the only time I really feel the PDCC system kick in. In normal it's perfectly suited for daily driving. With the GTS, it's lower then the other models in the range, and I just leave it at low level 1 all the time. I rarely use comfort, it's too soft for my liking. In the 2015/6, they've replaced the normal mode for some stupid reason. You have comfort - sports - sports plus. That REALLY annoyed me. 

In terms of how hard it is, let me just put it this way. Stick the thing in sports mode and that's when you realize it's a true Porsche. The Cayenne gets a lot of hate, but it's usually from people who've never owned one. The comments I get at times are funny. I let some of the master level guys lap it, and every single one of them loved it. Those guys were setting some serious lap times rivalling people driving 991/7's in the intermediate/club class. In the end it all comes down to the driver I guess. 

That's another reason my tires and brakes were shot, I let a couple of people have a go and some of them really pushed it. I don't mind it, it's a Porsche, it can take the abuse. I converted one of the masters to a believer, he was so impressed by it he's already looking in the preowned market and is listing his Range Rover Sport for sale. Well worth letting him have a go, hopefully next time I won't be the only one in a Cayenne! It may sound like I'm blowing my own trumpet. But having owned the previous gen X5M and first gen RRS HST, I can confidently say this is the better vehicle. I haven't experience the new X5M yet, and don't really want to as it still doesn't have an option for adjustable ride height, which is a deal breaker for me as I do off-road my SUV's. 

I love the 981, I've driven both the standard and the S model, and God damn those things handle so well. The power is perfect in my opinion as you can actually use it. The 718 is nice, but I the noise is just disappointing. You cannot compare the 718's engine to yours, the 981 is a totally different beast. It's so well balanced. The 718 is quick no doubt about it, but in my opinion I feel the 981 is a better drivers vehicle. The feel, experience and connection to the engine in the 981 is just better, or more pronounced. The 718 feels softer, more suited for daily driver use if that makes any sense. I've never gotten a chance to drive the 981 GTS so I can't talk about that, but if the S is anything to go by, that's should be a beast to drive. 

At Yas Marina no drones are allowed as there is an active air corridor over the circuit. But there is a video on YouTube of my Cayenne being followed by my friends drone (DJi I think), while I was driving up Jabel Jais (a mountain). I'm sure you'll be able to find it with a quick search, I'm on my phone at the moment and can't figure out how to embed it. ",2016-10-16 00:02:29+00:00,d8toxlt,6.0,t1_d8tnjpq,2186.0,Porsche
7,"It's a totally different vehicle compared to the 955/957. My first Cayenne was a 955 Turbo, kept that till the 957 and then went the S route due to some reliability issues I had with the turbo. Great vehicles tho, very tough. They can take a lot of abuse. 

The 958 was a total redesign, they added some welcomed upgrades, making it a lot more luxurious, the 8 speed really helps getting this thing moving and the driving dynamics were massively improved. I had a 2016 GTS as well, just sold it recently as I wasn't enjoying the V6 TT as much as I enjoy the V8. 

It's a very surprising vehicle on the track, the response is second to none in the SUV range, and this thing can move. I have PDCC and PTV and those two options are worth their weight in gold to me. Even my instructor was surprised at how this thing just grips and grips with little to no body roll. Sure in the straights the power of a turbo would be nice, but around the corners it's just stunning. That being said, turn PSM off and it's actually hilarious, this thing gets sideways with little effort. Tho I do need a new set of tires, and the brakes I just put on before the track day have already lost a significant portion of their life, but as they say, you have to pay to play. 

Thanks! Carmine Red is one of my favorite colors in the Porsche range, especially when it's got the full sport design kit on it, even on the Panamera this color just pops. I've actually ordered the new Panamera in this color, that's how much I love it.

26,"Cayenne and issues? Sure the 955's weren't the most reliable bunch, and it got better with the 957 (coolant hoses barred).

But the 958.1 is the picture of reliability. I had 2, a GTS and a Turbo, the Turbo was a 2011 which I just sold last year after putting over 150k kms on her, and the only thing that ever really went wrong on that car was the rear right window motor quit working, but was replaced under warranty. 

My GTS is a 2013 and is just approaching 91K kms, and that has been perfect since the day I got her. I love the Cayennes so much I picked up a 2016 GTS as well, even though I don't drive it as much as its V8 sibling, I assure you none of the plastic bits have ' falling apart ' on the 3 958's I've owned since 2011. And I don't baby my Cayennes, both the turbo and the GTS were taken off-road quite a bit, hauled the dog around in them, beat on them daily and so on..

Sure the Panamera gets a lot of hate due to its looks, but looks are subjective right?

I suggest you go drive both the GTS and the Turbo to narrow down your selection, they're very different vehicles. The GTS is a drivers car, it's the last normally aspirated V8 you can get in the Panamera range, that engine is a jewel, so eager to rev and it makes a glorious noise, and once you're behind the wheel I bet you'll forgot about whatever issues you have with the looks. The turbo is the quintessential GT car, tons of power, extreme smoothness and more refined than practically any other GT Sports sedan. The turbo is a much more comfortable experience overall, the suspension is a little softer, it's quieter, but that being said once you flatten your right foot the world starts going by very very quickly.

There are a ton of subtle changes, some which are welcome, some which I hate. 

Personally the 957 (Red one) is my favourite. It manages to put a smile on my face ever time I drive it. There are so many things particular to the V8 GTS, it'd take me ages to create a list. But a lot of engine parts are bespoke to the GTS model, reason I bring this up is a lot of people think the GTS's are just S's with a ton of 'standard' options

The 958 (Gold one) seems to have misplaced it's soul, it's basically a glorified (optioned up) Cayenne S.. The V6 is great, makes good power, barely and lag and it's much smoother than the NA V8.. But that being said, it really does seem to have lost a part of what GTS really stood for. Hopefully Porsche pulls a rabbit out of their hat for the next one.

31,"I do agree with you to a certain extent about the weight. Even tho this generation lost weight compared against the 955/957 Cayennes, and continues to do so with the refresh, it really doesn't feel as heavy as it is. 

The red one is equipped with PTV+PDCC and those two options combined with the engineered vehicle dynamics makes this thing handle and feel like nothing else I've driven.  The NA V8 puts a smile on my face everyday, it is truly a gem of a engine, it's really sad that there are no more NA V8 Cayennes anymore, I will really miss them. 

In my opinion Porsche was extremely smart to create the first true sport SUV. When the first gen Cayenne Turbo came out, the numbers that the thing put down were unbelievable. I've had the E70 X5M and a RR Sport HST, and for me they can't come close to what the Cayenne can do. The X5M is supremely capable in a straight line on tarmac, but show it some sand and it tucks it's tail in between its legs. It wasn't a very comfortable vehicle too. On the other hand the RR was a great package, produces decent power, has some off-road capability and was generally a nice vehicle to drive. Unfortunately it was the most unreliable vehicle I had ever owned.

It comes down to the kind of lifestyle you have in the end, I would love to own a 991 C4 GTS, but my dog usually accompanies to work, and I heavily doubt a 991 would be a very good vehicle to transport a growing German Shepherd in. Over that I actually use them off road nearly on a daily basis. These aren't SUV's that are confined to the roads, Porsche wouldn't equip them with 2 off-road levels for the suspension and differential locks and so on.

When she was 3-4 months she used to only whine, then somehow she managed to find her voice.  Ever since then it literally has been non stop back talk from her, which is one thing I actually love.

No breeder worth their salt would ever let a puppy leave before the 8 week mark. So for the 'raising from birth' part, it's a nonissue. You keep referencing 'how it was treated', do you know where she got him/her from? That would answer a lot of your questions right of the bat. 

And for the 'defective GSD', these are living creatures each with their own unique personality traits. Every dog is unique and it's upto their owner to pick up on their preferences, likes, dislikes, etc. This isn't a one size fits all situation. 

I cannot comment on the service dog training part, but at 3 months he/she is still extremely young. This is the time to create that lifelong bond. I am sure someone else will chime in with their views.

Just one last thing, my GSD stopped crying in the crate after just 4 days. I made the crate like a den, soft blanket on the bottom and covered with a light bed sheet to keep it a little dark. It was a game for my GSD, I fed her in the crate, played with her in the crate, and a few other things. A google search will tell you all you need to know.

41,"For me it's a matter of preference, the NA V8 is a gem of an engine, the V6TT just lacks soul. They've definitely made it a much more comfortable daily driver in the 957.2, but they've watered down the rawness that came with the GTS. 

It's not about hating on forced induction motors (I own and love them), but anyone whose had a chance to drive a Cayenne GTS or a Panamera GTS and a normal one of either of those will attest that the GTS is extremely different from the other models. Many subtle little changes add up to an extremely different overall package.

The red one sounds, feels and performs like a sports saloon, not an SUV. It's got PDCC+Torque vectoring which are both incredible. I have never driven another SUV that can do the things this does.

The gold one is a supremely comfortable vehicle in every aspect, somehow they've actually made it easier to drive. The new tech is a welcome addition, LED headlamps and surround view are two new must have options in my book. The suspension changes are very well done now, seems they've tweaked all the chassis settings to be closer together rather than the way they were in the 958.1. But for some reason this vehicle doesn't do it for me. It's on the market and once I sell it I'll be putting an order down for a Turbo S, now that is a different beast altogether. 

As to why I have two, I bought the gold one sight unseen. I took it on the word of the dealer that it was a worthwhile upgrade. The red one was always a keeper, the last normally aspirated V8 Sport SUV.

She seems to hit these random growth spurts. She may not put on any weight for a week, but then suddenly in a matter of days she'll put on a kilo or two. 

She's cute, mine does that too when she wants a lie in the kitchen. Right at the base of the refrigerator. So if anyone wants any food, they have to go through her. ",2016-04-21 05:13:29+00:00,d2bd27v,2.0,t1_d2agn9l,46909.0,germanshepherds

Holy crap I've never had as many cuts as I have right now. The teeth. I know it's a phase and it'll pass. But damn do they hurt, and even at 9 weeks old these guys aren't weak by any means. 

Luckily mines good with dogs, she is besotted with my Maltese (Chanel). If she isn't following me around, she's following her around. 

GSD's are insanely smart, maybe a bit too much for their own good. You need to not only physically tire them out, but mentally. I normally spend 5 minutes a couple of times throughout the day on training. 

But you need to have the time to set aside raising them right. As they say, there are no bad dogs, only bad owners. 

I usually work from home so I'm always around, but even then she gets into things she isn't supposed too. My garden is destroyed, my house plants are destroyed, 4 pairs of shoes are destroyed, and who knows what else. But all of that is because I turned my back on her for a couple of minutes. These guys need constant supervision. 

I'm up every 3 hours during the night to make sure she goes for pee. As time goes in it'll get better. Chanel is great, she would sleep with me for 8-10 hours without a fuss. I know Chloe will get there, but for now I am literally living my life on a timer. 

But whatever the drawbacks/sacrifices are, it's all worth it when she comes and cuddles with me. I wouldn't change a thing. ",2015-10-29 19:45:48+00:00,cwhj094,2.0,t1_cwgx0au,46326.0,germanshepherds
