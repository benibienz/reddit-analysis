1,It was easy enough. I have moved a lot when I was younger so I know how it is to arrive in a new placed without knowing anyone. The key is to not isolate yourself. In the case of an study exchange you meet a lot of other students in the same situation right at the beginning of the semester. This helped me a lot too.,2016-09-23 11:00:01+00:00,d7yp1fr,4,t1_d7y2l19,46164,trees
2,"Sweden in really nice! I don't really have a total immersion since I don't speak swedish and I usually hang out with other exchange student, but every Swedish person I met is nice. Everybody speak a good English too. I live in Gothenburg which is the second biggest city in Sweden (500 000 pop.), the best thing is that even if it is a city, you just have to take the tram for 15 mins and you are at a lake in the middle of the forrest. Or you can take the boat for 5$ and go explore islands on the sea.",2016-09-22 21:30:04+00:00,d7y0uyd,2,t1_d7xzbrx,2064,trees

37,"Had my first one this summer. I was in Quebec city staying an hostel and at the end of the night my friend and I realized we didn't have the front door key. I had noticed earlier that there was a back door that stayed open on the fourth floor balcony so went behind the building and noticed the door was still open. The only way to go up there was to climb on the balcony of the next building, then across a fence that was standing between both balconies. I went first and my friend followed me, I should mention we were pretty wasted so we were doing a lot of noise. When i finally arrived at the top, I looked under and realized my friend have climbed down and is trying to tell me something. Then I see him, a big bald man with a metal bar in his hands just a flight of stairs behind me. I try to explain to him that I am just trying to go the hostel next building but he doesn't seem to understand and start walking slowly towards me. Now the to only ways out are to climb the fence or try to climb down from where I came. I chose the second option and jump across the balcony hanging on the railing with at least 8 or 9 meters between me and the ground. Thats when I realized I was screwed. The guy  started trying to hit my hands with is metal bar. By luck, he only hit my little finger on the right hand. With the adrenaline rushing in my body, I managed to jump to the balcony under me but the guy ran down the stairs and tried hitting me on the head from there. He got me but not strong enough to do real damage and I was able to jump down to another balcony then to the ground. From there me and my friend went hide behind a car on the street and waited. The police arrived soon after and we left to escape trouble. In defense of the guy, it was a bad neighbourhood and he probably thought we were thieves but I had the fear of my life.
