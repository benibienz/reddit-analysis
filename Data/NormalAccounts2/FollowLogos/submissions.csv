Now every time I load it I just die immediatly and when I respawn I keep dying too I don""t have anytime to move or to try to heal.

Is there any backup save files on my ps3 or anyway I could keep playing? I don't think I have the patience to start again.

Last week i did the TTK update (1.1.3 I think) and I was able to play with the new maps and the new ""armor level"". I don't know if the new quests were available because I still haven't finished the main one.
But today there was a new update (1.1.4) and when I go in the crucible, the 5 principal modes are locked and it tells me to buy the expansion for TTK. Well I can't even buy the standalone TTK expansion because I don't have pack 1 and pack 2, so I MUST BUY the legendary pack at 80$ which is all the 3 expansions, + the game. So this mean that if I want to keep playing destiny in the main modes, I need to buy a game 80$ I already bought at 70$ 6 months ago?
