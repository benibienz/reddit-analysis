However, day to day, the cons outweigh the pros. The street level window is kind of annoying...lets in noise, can't leave it open all the time, people looking in when the curtains are open...can't walk around naked...

That's just the window issue, being one of the apartments everyone in the building passes as they go in and out is its own issue. More noise, the door slamming at all hours, conversations, drunk people being louder than necessary.

The biggest thing I found was to set the feedback or number of repeats to only once, and the mix should be at least 50/50 if not a little more toward the wet than dry, so that it actually sounds seamless. For the longest time the main attack was too prominent and the delays trailed after, but if you set it right, the notes should ring 4 times each, all the same volume so as not to distinguish the delays.",2016-04-04 03:51:37+00:00,d1oy7z9,1.0,t3_4d7xvb,24181.0,guitarpedals

674,"Sorry if it wasn't clear, but by pitch pedals I meant the Whammy and HOG lol, that's all I'm letting go of at the moment.

The Hog is definitely a commitment and has a bit of a learning curve, but it really is a beast. Playing around with it, you can see where EHX got many of the effects for a lot of it's other pedals. You can do some of the organ sounds from the B9/C9 series, you can do some string sounds, it has a freeze effect, it has a gliss effect like the Superego. It's amazing, but it is big and it is intense hahah

The Whammy is not all that bad, if you've played with one before you know exactly how to handle it. It's a great effect, much fun, and I love the chordal mode on the 5. It loses that glitchiness that the Whammy is famous for, but it allows for polyphonic work, can do like 12 string type sounds and such.

The FF has a great vintage kind of vibe, I love it for psych rock.

The gliss and wet/dry volumes are a cool plus with the SE, but I set my freeze volume to match the signal and I find it's similar to the SE with the dry volume down.

Bugy Craxone fits the ""indie rock"" stlye out of those most I'd say...Bloodthirsty Butchers and Toddle are great, in the vain of Dinosaur Jr. Number Girl and Eastern Youth are both great alternative/post-punk indie outfits, and Spangle Call Lille Line mixes genres, with some post-rock/indie rock kinda style.

871,"It's very different from most games of it's type. It's *basically* an offshoot of team deathmatch/survivors/capture the flag game-type, but different in their own ways.

* Supply Raid is basically team deathmatch, but with a cumulative 20 lives for the team (4v4) and unlimited respawn (though there is a timer, not instant respawns(. The objective is to go to the boxes, gather parts, craft items, and use them to kill the other team. 

* Survivors is similar, but with one life for each player per round. You get killed, you don't respawn until the rest of your team dies or kills the other team. Similar gameplay, but more focus on killing over crafting, crafting is more for your own benefit here. The supply boxes in this round are randomly placed, while in SR they are fixed.

* Interrogation is an interesting kind of twist on king of the hill/capture the flag. You wanna down your enemies and not execute them instantly. Instead, you want to special execute them (by going up to then and pressing triangle) and in this mode you ""interrogate"" them. 5 interrogations and their safe is shown on your map, your objective is to then get to their safe and open it, which takes a long time, so you want your team around to guard whoever is opening it. As the timer counts down in the round, the unlock speed is increased and it becomes easier to open the safe. 

That's the main objectives. But yeah, this one definitely emphasizes strategy and stealth (nothing more satisfying than shivving someone in the back). I remember going back and forth between this and COD and getting tripped up. COD is a run and gun, pretty much fast paced running and killing/dying until the end of the round. With Factions, you want to take your time. It's pretty slow-paced gameplay comparatively, which turns some off. But I love it. 

You do start with few bullets. One of the quirks of factions is there isn't any real leveling up perse, overall. You level up each round. So everyone starts off on equal footing pretty much. I mean the weapons all have their ups and downs, someone with a shotgun or automatic might have an advatage due to the power of their guns, but it's nothing that can't be overcome with strategy. 

I highly recommend playing with a mic and playing with others with a mic if possible, adds a whole team dynamic where you can talk each other through situations/let them know where people are. In general, it's best not to lone wolf it and stick with your team. 

EDIT: Also thought I should mention, the supply boxes are reflective of each round, which is cool. If your team is wiping the floor with the other team, it's not going to give you a hell of a lot. If you're losing bad or the last man standing, you'll be getting already crafted bombs and molotovs, full melee weapons, and a ton of parts.

952,"So after black friday and a bunch of swaps, and a few other purchases, I was able to do an overdrive and fuzz shootout when I got back home from school for the holidays! I don't have any way to record, but here's a write-up.

 It was everything I dreamed of....I found some keepers and some that are on their way out. I tested them all with a Strat and a Les Paul through a '65 TRRI.

**THE OVERDRIVES**

I know they're in the pic, but I had: 

* DOD 250 Overdrive/Pre Amp Reissue (new)

* EHX Hot Tubes Nano

* Boss BD-2

* Boss OD-3 (new)

* Barber Gain Changer

* EHX Crayon (new)

**My Thoughts:**

 So let's go in order. The 250 was pretty great. I liked it a lot more than I thought I would like an overdrive with two knobs, and no tone knobs. I don't need a lot of knobs, but I usually like control over my dirt sound. This one was actually great right out of the box, and sounded awesome pretty much anywhere settings-wise, though I found it didn't really open up until like 11 o clock on the gain knob. It sounded fatter with the HB's of the LP, which I dug a lot, but it sounded really good through both guitars. I'll be honest...I probably wouldn't buy it for the full price (I think they go for $100?) But for a pedal that regularly goes on sale for $50, I'd definitely recommend it!

The Hot Tubes I've had for a while. It's very bassy, which I've seen some complain about. But it compliments my this set-up well when playing through the strat. It's got a thick sound that's great for rhythm playing, I love playing Yellow Ledbetter with it for some reason. I like to set it for a light break up. I will say that it's kind of a one trick pony for me, and that's just this deep, light overdrive. It doesn't do great at high gain imo, and the switch makes it unusable IMO, I always keep the tone stack on. It just gets too dark otherwise. That said, it's a solid pedal that I can't seem to get rid of (as in I don't try to get rid of it, not nobody will take it haha) I'd recommend it if you're looking for that kind of sound or if you have a bright rig. I'd definitely recommend trying it first.

The BD-2 remains one of my favorite overdrives to date. It is the perfect overdrive to me. The stock version gets some heat, and people prefer their mods (Keeley mostly, but there are dozens of big name mods for it). I just love it stock. It CAN get shrill and it CAN be too fizzy. I agree with the critiques. But if you set it just right, it can't be beat. It's very versatile, I like to set it to clean up with the guitar volume knob, it can go from a very light, almost clean tone to a medium gain overdrive just by adjusting your volume. Great for blues, great for alt-rock. At least that's what I use it for. Can't extol this pedal enough. I recommend it whole heartedly, even if you feel you have to mod it. Do it.

The OD-3 I've always heard about being another drive that Boss got right, and I'd agree with that. It is a good pedal, but definitely a different beast than the BD-2. The OD-3 does not clean up as nice, and it is definitely more mid-heavy (though not necessarily boosted), I don't think it's a TS? But it is a very classic (almost generic?) OD sound. Can almost get into distortion type territory. I'll say that it sounded a lot better with my strat than the LP, as it can be a bit dark. I need the tone around 1-2 oclock, where as the BD-2 gets a bit ice-picky around 2 oclock. I definitely prefer the BD-2, and will probably sell this one. 

The Barber Gain Changer is another one that Ive had around for a while. It's my main drive these days, and I've put it through it's paces, through a variety of shootouts over the year or two that I've had it, and it always stays. It's super versatile (it's like 3 pedals in one I believe), and is perfect for what I need. It has that great clean-up ability that I love about the BD-2, and it's just a really great drive sound. I really want to get Barber's Compact Direct Drive, as I've heard great things about that too. Definitely recommend this one!

The Crayon is obviously very new. It just arrived yesterday actually. I was pretty excited for it since I first heard about it, and I won't say that I was let down, but it is very different than what I pictured. First off, I have to keep the bass at at least 1 oclock. It's a very bright pedal. But then to compensate, I have to raise the treble as well. I have it set currently at bass at 3 and treble at 1. Secondly, the drive is interesting. It doesn't clean up all that well and excels as more of a heavier medium gain drive. It's got a pretty middy tone in general, but with the tone knobs that high, it's no longer much of an issue. Thirdly, and probably lastly...the switch pops when you engage, and lesser so when you turn it off. That's a build issue and EHX is kind of known for QC issues lately. But it's a thing with this one (actually my first first-hand experience with EHX's faulty switches). Overall, I'm not sure about it. I did like it better with the strat I think, which is weird since it's bright, you would think the HB's would be better for it...I think more or less I'm set with my drives, and I was gonna keep it and put on colorful knobs and make it look nice, but since it didn't wow me, I'll probably pass it on...other people I've read about liking it, so maybe it's just not for me! I'll be playing with it throughout the weekend to be sure though!

**FUZZZZZZZZZ**

The Fuzzes are:

* Blackout Effectors Musket V1

* Blackout Effectors Musket V2

* Blackarts Toneworks Pharaoh

* Solidgold FX If 6 Was 9

* Dunlop Fuzz Face Mini (Germanium) 

So you might notice some symmetry here, I've got two Muskets, the Pharaoh, and then two fuzz faces. The Muskets are actually different. The white one has V1 circuitry, and the green one has V2 circuitry with V1 graphics.

The first Musket, I'll say the V1 circuitry is actually very different. There's a whole other level of gain with that one. At the smae settings, the V1 circuit is much much heavier, and you can't really pull back on the reigns all that much. I much prefer the V2 circuitry, but I can definitely see people loving the V1 for like heavier stuff, shoegaze, etc. Both sound fantastic, but I prefer the range of the V2 circuit. I do however prefer the white graphic to the green haha. So I'm not sure how to reconcile this, but in general, I recommend the Musket. Great Muff of the Russian variety, the pre knob can really boost your gain (like an overdrive before it), and the focus knob (I don't really know WHAT it does) but it really fine tunes the sound in a way I can't describe haha

The Pharaoh is an awesome pedal. I think it's supposed to be a Muff type fuzz, but I always assumed from the GE/SI switch that it was FF-based. Well after this shootout, I guess I agree that it is muff based. I can definitely tell it's very modified, the tonal options are unreal. But the muff flavor is definitely there, namely that deep bottom end that's great for chugg-chugging lol I definitely recommend this one, but I think that since it's not an FF like I hoped (no one makes both a SI and GE FF in one?) I think I'll probably end up passing this one on. 

I've had the If 6 Was 9 fuzz for a while. It's beautiful to look at and sounds great. It's an SI FF based classic fuzz sound, but the added bias knob is a real treat. It can bring it from a thin zippery fuzz to a heavier gated type of fuzz. As with any FF, it sounds best with the Fuzz knob dimed. I love busting out some Hendrix riffs with it.

The FF mini is a new one. I actually have a custom built GE FF coming soon, so I got this to try them side by side.

I'm usually happy though...

Chinese I usually opt for Hunan Delight or China Taste, though Sunny 88 was pretty good last time I got it. Oriental Cafe is alright too.

Japanese is harder, haven't been as successful with great take-out, but if I'm in the mood I'll order from Oriental Cafe or Dai Hachi. I'm not sure if they are on Seamless but the best sushi I've had in a while was at the newish place between 82nd and 83rd on Lex.

Pizza is usually Arturos or Salvos. Al Forno is good too though, and Delizia is alright.

Indian I go for OM, though the place on 83rd and York is good, I don't think they're on Seamless though.

The Thai place on 82nd and 2nd is good, again, not sure if they are on seamless...

Mexican is also rough for delivery here, I've found. I'll opt for Sabor a Mexico though, the one uptown, not in the 70s.

1136,"I mostly agree, it is sad seeing them decline in quality, which, as I mentioned, correlates to around the time they signed with Avex and Wake Up!x3. I really loved My Foot, there are a ton of great tracks on there like the [title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSNaqSPxF4M), [The Third Eye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQt2lKIU9Po), and [Sayonara Universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pRs9JVARXc). But I agree most post-My Foot tracks are not that great...Wake Up!x3 is just alright, OOPARTS wasn't anything special, Horn Again was a let down aside from a select few tracks. Trial was a pretty great resurgence in my book, I really loved [that title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umjTZzdAc8M) as well, and Minority Whisper, as well as Energia and Comic Sonic. Then Moondust came out this year and it was a let down as well. so they are really all over the place, but their best album released in almost 10 years now (IMO) was Bootleg the Pillows, which contained tracks written in the early 90s...that's telling of their current status. 

I always found it interesting how they didn't really include the bassists as members of the band, kind of jerkish lol. Jun was the only bassist to be shown in a select few music videos, but still...but yeah, I guess his drinking was causing problems. I liked him a lot, but I'd love it if Tatsuya Kashima reunited with them, maybe see a return to their jazzier days.

That's funny, reminds me of searching for the pillows and getting results for just pillows, or when I try to specify with ""Japanese bands,"" the search will pick up Japanese and give me results of Japanese anime body pillows. Happy Bivouac is a great album, the title track is so good! My favorite songs off of that one would probably be Backseat Dog, Kim Deal, and Rush, though Crazy Sunshine and Beautiful Morning With You are also amazing. I really love Our Love and Peace too...sooo, that covers about 3/4 of the album haha...I can't say I personally love Wake Up!x3, but it *is* a solid album. I was honestly disappointed when they came out with it following My Foot, which was the first ""new"" album to come out after I got into them and it was awesome.

1156,"Got a few new pedals in trades recently and decided to put em to the test...the new ones in are the Context, Musket, and Pharaoh. 

Put the Context up against my DIY reverb, which is a kind of ""plate"" style, deep reverb. The Context is awesome, every mode is very usable, I really love the delay, plate, and cathedral modes especially. It's got a very natural sound, definitely one of the best reverbs I've played around with, although it's a little harder to dial in a subtle effect. I found it was mostly either a good amount of verb or ethereal, which is definitely A-OK for some. I would hold onto it, but I think I already have another swap lined up for it that I'm looking forward to, so it's probably on its way back out. I'd definitely pick one up to keep sometime down the road though.

The dirts there aren't new to me, I've had the Pharaoh before and the Musket before. But I wanted to see if the Pharaoh was more muff-y like the Musket, or more FF-y like my If 6 Was 9. I always thought it was FF-based, but I kept reading it was in the muff family.

After playing around for a while, I found that the Si side could get very close to my I6W9, confirming my suspicions. However, I definitely did miss the bias knob. It remains to be seen if the Pharaoh will lead me to sell/trade the I6W9, but it's possible. The I6W9 is just so pretty to look at though ;)

Great song list, I love Solanin so much, so much emotion in that one, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqThbWqMTT8) video is awesome, I really want to see the movie.

1202,"Great stuff, thanks for sharing, this is the kind of discussion that makes me happy I wrote this writeup!

I have to agree about Yamada, I hear his bass lines and often think, damn, I don't hear shit like this just anywhere...I especially love the bass line in the intro to Kimi no Machi Made....if only we lived near by, we could rock out with some AKFG covers and other great Japanese acts.

The same can be said of Ichi on drums, his drumming is absolutely superb. Songs like Marching Band and Mugen Glider, AtoZ...they all really highlight his technical skills and they are amazing. 

I'd have to disagree, at least a bit, on their deterioration of quality. There's no denying that Sol-Fa is definitely a high point of their career, their first few albums in general contain a lot of their hits that have been featured in animes and stuff. I would say that the have dipped and wavered, while still maintaining an overall greatness, but albums like Magic Disk, Surf Bungaku, are a tad weaker, but Landmark absolutely blew me away, and Wonder Future has proven amazing too, I loved their live webcast, hearing all those new songs live really made me love them. I really really hope they come to the US soon! But I wouldn't say that they deteriorated increasingly on each release, just a mid-career slump that plenty of other bands have gone through.

I had a friend switch the ins/outs because on those muffs the input was on the left and the output was on the right, super annoying when trying to put it on a board. I also added a 9v input because the stock ones only ran on batteries.

Then I had a mids knob added because it kept getting lost in the mix, like the Musket and most modded muffs add. Added a yellow LED to match the aesthetic, and then my friend came up with the idea to add a feedback switch, but it didn't work out that well. Not that it's bad, it still works, it's just underwhelming...when you flick the switch you get a low-volume feedback that you can play with via your guitars tone and volume knobs to change pitch and stuff.

EDIT:

Found some names:

guitar: Jun Matsue, bass: Maki Kitada, drums: Atsushi Matsushita, and keyboard: gomes

Jun Matsue appears to be a studio musician, he's got a lot of performance credits, but no stable band from what I can see.

Bassist Maki Kitada is from the great band [Syrup16g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOsJUHzDhnI&amp;list=PLmPE8oqnWfNPA43FPN5lAzsT-RxZBh5zi&amp;index=2)...another good one of theirs is [Reborn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Vc6rh0OFzo&amp;list=PLmPE8oqnWfNPA43FPN5lAzsT-RxZBh5zi), and he also played with the Seatbelts, the band Yoko Kanno formed for the Cowboy Bebop OST.

Atsushi Matsushita drummed for ZAZEN BOYS, the band of former Number Girl frontman Shutoku Mukai. I think I'll be doing a Number Girl write up this month as well.

I've done it myself.

There's a reason to be suspicious for sure, it's a very real problem, but I'd decide after talking to the guy and then meeting up and seeing the tickets. If you want a failsafe method, meetup at the show and have them scan the ticket before you pay him or something.

1297,"Joined a band with metal-loving acquaintances because my good friend joined as vocalist and said they wanted another guitarist. He/they promised they weren't going to play anything too heavy (that's just not my scene, don't play it, don't enjoy it), but before our first show even, just working out a setlist, the song picks got heavier and heavier. Draft 1 was fine, I enjoyed all the songs and we sounded pretty damn good. But they ended up adding more and more songs, and they were getting more and more metal....

Needless to say, I was out. Not just because of that...they also didn't want to play any of my picks, didn't accept any of my input on band name, etc. My friend/vocalist left as well before their first show, and they got another guitarist/vocalist. They played a pretty much all metal show. And they sucked. They sounded like every other wannabe metal band at my high school. Terrible tone, sloppy, etc. 

OH, and just remembered....the guitarist they ended up going with, was their previous guitarist, who they dropped to get me. I didn't even know I was replacing anyone, and when I showed up to the first practice, afterwards, they were talking and realized they never even fired the first guitarist yet, and ended up calling him while I was right there.

I got into them via Eleven Fire Crackers and do think that it is their most refined album, but I agree their whole discography is pretty solid!

I was in a car parked at the beach, not smoking but my friends were. Cop pulls up and goes through the whole routine, but he takes the ""Bad cop"" road.

Personally, I find the dirt quality fairly average, while the rest of the effects are awesome. I don't think that the dirt sounds bad though, as others do. I've used the dirt section just fine in a live situation. But I usually supplement it with a couple dirt pedals to take care of that bc I love dirt pedals haha

As for the switches, I've been through 2 M5s...the first I sold and went to the zoom Multistomp series, and then I came back to the m5. Now I'm looking to sell again to buy an m9. I've never personally had switch issues, but they are easily replaceable if something does happen. 

The M series is a truly great line of pedals, the M5 is a small little swiss army knife of effects, I think it's a great buy!

1470,"Fair enough, oh yeah lol I think I did!

Not saying this to strengthen my case, just in general for if you ever come across a good deal on one, don't count out the M series just because it's a multi FX. It's no rinky dink machine, most of the algorithms are awesome. It's no Strymon or anything, but for the price, the reverbs and delay choices are top notch, you got your tap temkpo, some cool filters ranging from standard to wacky, and a slew of modulation making it a great swiss army knife for any pedalboard. Not to mention it runs in stereo and is expression pedal capable! The M5 allows just one effect at a time, but I've got a friend who has played out with just an M9 (3 effects).

Cries himself to sleep that night but the next morning, what does he do? He practices. And he practices and he practices with one goal in mind: Never to be laughed at again. And a year later, he goes back to the Reno... And he steps up on that stage and he plays the best motherfucking solo the world has ever heard. (beat) So imagine if Jones had just said: ""Well, that's okay Charlie. Eh... that was alright. Good job."" Then Charlie thinks to himself, ""Well, shit. I did do a pretty good job."" End of story, no ""Bird."" That, to me, is... an absolute tragedy. But that's just what the world wants now! People wonder why jazz is dying. (beat) I'll tell you man. And every Starbucks ""jazz"" album just proves my point, really. There are no two words in the English language more harmful... Than ""good job.""

I'm sure we can work something out...I just value the memory card a little higher since they're so expensive.

And the thing that stuck out to me, while it could've just been my phone speakers, is the vocals were a little too clipped. I don't know if if was the effect, or the result of singing just a tad beyond your register (which you still nailed for the most part), but the vocals sound a little too dirty.
