This is an AVRI sized pickguard, but works on VMJM with a different rhythm circuit bracket. The transition is simple enough. This should fit all American made and the Squier Jazzmasters (Squiers need a tad of maneuvering) I think it won't align right with imports.

I've read it's possible to find a place without a broker, problem is we are out of town for most of the time before late August...so groundwork won't be super easy. We are considering getting a broker again. Is this easier/a wise move? Or a waste of money?

Furthermore, my uncle is now retired, my parents don't have that much as my Mom had a stroke and is unemployed. I don't think we'll be able to get as good of a guarantor. My question is that if we've had our place now for 5 years and have been good with paying rent, does the income rule still apply as harshly? Is it going to be tough to find a new place without the cosigner or someone who doesn't make exactly 40x? Would having a broker make it easier to deal with this issue or not matter? 

Sorry if this post isn't all that coherent, just a bunch of questions I had in my head that I let flow all at once. Any help appreciated!

The CE-240 Sheena was one of the guitars FA released to try and make it in the ""mainstream"" guitar market. Sold about a decade ago for almost $500 bucks, this guitar is totally worth that price. When their venture didn't turn out, they blew out these guitars and people picked them up 2 and 3 at a time, and they had a cult following for those willing to look past the name on the headstock.

This guitar has a red flametop-esque body with a 22 fret maple fingerboard, set neck (not some cheap bolt on piece of crap). The neck plays great. The neck pickup is a P90-like single coil and the bridge position has a Humbucker. There are two independent volume controls and a shared tone knob. 6 in line tuners (that actually hold tune well!) on a cool custom FA style Firebird-esque black headstock.

Google this guitar and see that people have great things to say about it! It's a definite sleeper hit, better than any Squier I've played, about on par with a MIM Fender.

This guitar is basically new...I mean, it's almost a decade old, but it looks as if it just came out of the box. No major flaws to speak of, just gave it a set up and new strings. It plays great!

I've seen these go for 175-200 on ebay sold prices, I've seen it being asked for over $300. I just need to clear space, so I'll let it go for $150.

Mostly looking for local pickup at this price, shipping can be discussed however.

Crappy cell phone pics: https://imgur.com/a/Up6Fo

Story: I have a thing for off-beat, quirky guitars, and when I saw this I was immediately intrigued. I'm no brand snob, and am definitely one for taking in cheap/beater guitars to fix up. The price was right so I grabbed it, after a little research...

Apparently, this model, the CE-240 ""Sheena,"" was one of the models FA attempted to break into the regular guitar market with. We all know that we can find First Acts at the big box stores and such, and they aren't known for quality. However, these guitars were sold at street for around $500 if I recall correctly, and the craftsmanship is on par with any guitar in that range in my opinion. Definitely as solid as some mid-range Epiphones and Fenders I've played.

So the story goes that FA just couldn't escape their big box rep and they discontinued the models that they created, namely the Sheena and the Delia. They were blowing these babies out in '08 for 100 bucks a pop, and from forum posts I've found from that time, people were buying them up 2 and 3 at a time, as they were indeed a well kept secret gem. 

Here are the specs I could pick-up from a little research, albeit this is for the blue model:

&gt; Single cutaway body, as per template and prototype SHEENA

- translucent blue glossy finish of headstock

- Cream binding on body top and top of headstock

- smooth radius edge back of guitar body

- 1.5"" depth

- solid poplar body

- Two piece, book matched, flame maple top

- 13.5"" lower bout

- 8.6875"" waist

- 11.25"" upper bout with contoured cutaway

- SET North American maple neck. Slim taper, flat C-shape

- smooth, polished nickel-alloy frets

- black graphite nut, 4.2cm width

- maple fingerboard with black I-line, 22 nickel frets, Cream binding along edge

- 25"" scale length

- tilted First Act painted (black), 6 in-line headstock with First Act, silver ""hologram"" decal logo on the headstock (under the finish) between tuning machine posts on headstock, cream binding

- Serial number applied to a transparent decal. Decal put under the finish, on back of headstock, between tuning machines- black truss rod cover

- Nickel die cast tuning machines

* cream/nickel, FA-designed humbucking pickup in bridge position

* cream, FA-designed single coil pickup in neck position

* with ALNICO 5 magnets

* .022 capacitors

* A250k neck volume pot

* A500k bridge volume pot

* B250k tone pot

* RoHS standard

* Lead-free solder on all wiring 

* nickel pickup rings (PE010)

* nickel bikini ring covers (PE012)

- Nickel, dome style, volume and tone knobs. (2 volume, 1 tone)

- three position pickup selector with white tip, positioned between 2nd volume and 1st tone knob

- nickel plated First Act tailpiece (PE024), bridge (PE026) and string retainer back plate

- Black shielded rear cavity cover

- metal strap buttons with black felt between button and body

- 3 ply white pearloid pickgaurd, shape specified by First Act

- Neck angle range as measured with First Act Neck Angle Tool: .625"" to .675""

- String height at the 12th fret:

Low E string: 5/64"" to 6/64""

High E string: 3/64"" to 4/64""

String set

-.010"", .013"", .017"", .026"", .036"", .046""

Reaction: 

So when I got it, it was a little scary...the fretted notes near the neck didn't really ring out, and I was worried there was a truss rod issue. After a little research of the specs, I set out to set this baby up and get her right. I immediately bonded with the neck. Though I don't love the maple, it feels good. The fret work is surprisingly great, no rough edges, frets are level. The guitar holds tune wonderfully. I gave it a set-up and popped on some new strings, and the issue immediately went away. The stock strings sounded terrible, but with new strings the guitar really livened up. I haven't put it down in 2 days. 

It's set neck, with either either a 14"" or 16"" radius, which is definitely new to me (this is judging by old forum posts, which is the only source of info I have on these guys). From there, I've also gathered that these are Kent Armstrong designed pickups. There's a single coil in the neck and a humbucker in the bridge position.

From the looks of it, they are selling on eBay for $175-200, which even then is a great price for this guitar. If it had been a decade ago and I played one of these in the store, I would've had a hard time NOT throwing down the $500 for it. It really is quite surprisingly good! If you get a chance to play one, I highly recommend it!

For Star Wars, I'm interested in a few PS4 titles.....Trials Fusion, the newer Naruto, Far Cry Primal, the Division. Could even the trade out a little if necessary. Would also be interested in a non-standard colored Dualshock 4.

As far as handheld titles go, I have a big list so just shoot some offers and I'll let you know if interested!

We've been in our studio for 5 years now and pay currently 1875 a month. The rent has steadily gone up about 75-150 a year, I believe, and I think we started it at 1625?

At this point, it's a bit too much for us for what it actually is. We are strongly considering a move, but as someone who who grew up out on Long Island, I'm not too familiar with the neighborhoods. 

What we are looking for is a 1 bedroom preferably if we are going to outer boroughs, but a studio would technically work. We'd like to get the rent back down to 1600-1700, or at least get some kind of upgrade from what we have...a dishwasher would be a treat, or some perk that our bare bones studio currently is without.

Were not opposed to moving to Queens or Brooklyn, but that was more or less the focus of this post. I'm not too familiar with neighborhoods there aside from the random weekend visits we sometimes take....we've been to Astoria, flushing, williamsburg, carrol gardens...among others. But I don't know what it's like to live there.

Not to sound like a scared little suburbian bunny, but that's more or less what we are. Our neighborhood now in Yorkville is pretty perfect in the quiet/activity ratio. There's plenty to do as far as bars and restaurants, but it's super safe and pretty quiet. I'm fine with my GF coming home later at night alone. That ""safety"" criteria is important. And just not too far from Manhattan is kind of important as its the borough we know the best and have all our ""spots"" so to speak. That said if there are neighborhoods in Manhattan that fit the criteria, that'd be perfect. 

So I guess that's it? I can answer ay other necessities criteria wise or whatever if needed, but I was just curious of my options.

Oh and as for timeframe....our lease is up at the end of August. I've never moved apartments in NYC and don't know when to begin looking, etc. Ideally we'd be signing a lease in July or August I guess. My girlfriend is excited and already looking now but in pretty sure that's way too early. Anything she finds now won't still be available in 5-6 months...so when to start looking for real?

I mean, I enjoy learning and putting in the work, but left to my own devices I'm not that structured. 

I've tried to get through Genki I but always find my interest waning. I know Hiragana almost 100% (Just takes me a second sometimes) and Katakana maybe 60% (I learned them all, just not memorized them perfectly yet.)

I think my main thing is that I'm not really learning it for any specific reason other than I enjoy it/enjoy the music/enjoy the culture. But I really am not in it for the long haul, I'd be happy with just basic conversational speaking, and don't even really care too much about reading.

So at least for now, that's the case. I've been watching the Japanese From Zero youtube videos and enjoying them, is that book series a good course?

Looking for something light-hearted with an emphasis on basic day to day conversation, over actually learning everything there is to know....basic sentence structure over techincal grammar, etc.

Have 2 V8 Sovtek black box Big Muffs, a modded 4 screw version and a stock 6 screw version. The mods on the 4 screw are: switched and upgraded the jacks (the stock pedal has the input on the left and output on the right for some reason...), I added a 9v jack (the stock can only run on battery),  added a mids knob (a common muff mod), and a feedback switch (great noise switch, can adjust tone of the feedback with the volume and tone knob on your guitar, I love to add delay and make spaceship noises lol)...the 6 screw version is fuzzier to my ears, at the same settings, the 6 screw has more gain......moddded version sold, 6 screw still available!

Also have a superego in good condition (a few small knicks in the paint), works great, has the box.

**FORMATION**

In 1989, punk band Kenzi and the Trips dissolved, but bassist Kenji Ueda and drummer Shinichiro Sato were not satisfied being dormant. They were ready to start a new project immediately, and they did so by inviting ex-Coinlocker Babies vocalist Sawao Yamanaka and guitarist from the hair metal band the pees, Yoshiaki Manabe to join up, and on September 16, 1989, the pillows were formed in Hokkaido. The name originated from a poster hanging in Manabe's apartment for the UK release of a post-punk compilation entitled Pillows &amp; Prayers. Ueda and Yamanaka got right to work composing a variety of songs which would wind up being their early indie EPs, *Pantomime* and *90's My Life*, released on the indie label Captain Records. **Key Tracks:** [Razorlike Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg9brrsv8tQ), [Paris no Joseii MARI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26z4zBnDEi0), [90s My Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fugY93Br8yE)...and the [live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zwxBDHxkE) version.

**Major Label Recognition and The Second ""Movement""**

the pillows have undergone 3 self-defined ""movements,"" which coincidentally more or less coincide with their change of bassists, but mostly dealt with stylistic musical changes. The first movement was the time spent with founding bassist Ueda, who left the band in 1992 to pursue a solo career and career as a producer. However, before his departure, the band was able to catch the ear of major label Pony Canyon Records, who signed them and released their first full album, *Moon Gold*.**Key Tracks:** [Their debut single, Ame ni Utaeba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCJr0IlqSFY), [Hello Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BosC6B85Xg) 

The band garnered many fans and started touring extensively, and even traveled to England the following year to record their second album, *White Incarnation*, and shoot a music video for their single [Kanojo wa Shisuta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIrRuwBFVSw). However shortly after recording, Ueda decided to split, opting to pursue a career as a solo artist and producer. The band never really ""replaced"" Ueda, out of respect for the founding member. Future bassists would be considered support bassists, and not listed as full members in credits, nor were they shown in press shots of the band, or music videos.

**The Second Movement**

Following Ueda's departure, the band kind of stagnated, but Sawao decided to take the reigns and recruit bassist Tatsuya Kashima from the band Super Bad. This reinvigorated the band and started them on what would be known as their ""second movement."" The first recordings with Kashima are included on a mini-cd released only to members of their fan club entitled *the pillows presents special cd*. One of my favorite of their early tracks, [Kimi to Futari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBXyWjKmLp0#t=9m13s) is off of this limited release. The change also spurred a stylistic change, backing off of their alternative/pop rock sound and moving to a jazzier style. In 1994, the band moved from Pony Canyon to King Records, where they'd release their third album, *Kool Spice*. **Key tracks:** [Monochrome Lovers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYX942EY4Bw), [Twilight Park Waltz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxat51CrrPQ). Shortly thereafter, they'd release the single preceding their next album, [Daydream Wonder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tNWwsuLen0), a hit which stayed in the top 3 on the charts for for just as many weeks.

 The following year, they'd release the album *Living Field*, considered by many their magnum opus of their early career. This eclectic album blended jazz, latin, and reggae, with pop influences into a broad-based fusion that I still have not found a match for. It is an unparalleled album in my book. However, the album was not a commercial success, although the single [Girlfriend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBt47MfTEJY) was used in a romance movie entitled Love Letter.**Key Tracks:** [Sunday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hJ_-vyX5mQ), [Native World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mgauQ1lCKM), [Something Like A Romance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P--YD2SrrR0), [Bye Bye Sweet Pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7PzCk8h0wA)

Their next single, [Tiny Boat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PxraLHOZrc) would also not chart that well, but the band was not deterred. Instead, they jumpstarted a 3rd movement, this time unleashing a new brand of alternative, and at times very poppy, rock which would be their main branding for the years to come. Following several successful singles, the band released their first forray into this genre with *Please Mr. Lostman*, which garnered mass acclaim and is considered by many to be their finest work to date, and the start of their ""holy trinity"" of albums, considered by many to be their glory days. **Key tracks** [Trip Dancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4ETUI56vXU), [Kanojo wa Kyo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBZU8KdJkCk), [Swanky Street and Strange Chameleon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9e4H0-E7mw)

In 1998, the pillows released their first DVD, *Hello, Welcome to Bubbletown's Happy Zoo*, which featured live clips and music videos. They released the album *Little Busters* later that year, which would go on to be one of their best selling albums for a long while, maintaining a distinct 90's rock formula. **Key tracks:** [Another Morning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77e7BERNy1k), [Like A Lovesong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge6uf28oHow), [Blues Drive Monster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM6v4z_SXm0)

The band would celebrate their 10th anniversary in the following year with 2 studio albums and a music video compilation DVD entitled *We Have a Theme Song*. The first album, *Runners High* would be their last album in the legendary trifecta, and the final album with Kashima on bass. **Key tracks:** [Let's See if That's True Or Not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENrgKe9vIyQ), [Juliet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyaareYS3r0)...chose a great cover because this guy is awesome at covering pillows songs, [Midnight Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6IuifdRS78)

However the hits were still flowing, and even with a line-up change, the band would release a second studio album later that same year, the first album with bassist Jun Suzuki from the band The Chewinggum Weekend. Entitled *Happy Bivouac*, the album contained many hits, such as [Funny Bunny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcvwfzdJnuU) and [RUSH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3egzf3dc7k). 

The band was approached before the turn of the century by animation studio Gainax to contribute music to their new OVA series FLCL, also known as Fooly Cooly. The studio licensed *Little Busters, Runners High, and Happy Bivouac*, as well as requesting a new track for their title song, for which the pillows composed probably their most well known song [Ride on Shooting Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTtOUlhL0WQ). The band also wrote the song [I Think I Can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhchOc1HqKc) specifically for the show, the two tracks would be released as singles, but not on an album until their 2001 Best Of. The FLCL OST cds (3 of them) all sold very well and the series was more or less a mainstream success (without any real plot or intricate storyline to speak of, but it's still awesome!) The series, as we have seen countless times before in these write-ups, propelled the band to stardom, and their fanbase grew exponentially, and world-wide, increased further by the dubbed version which ran on Cartoon Network's Toonami line-up in 2003, increasing their western fanbase, and leading to the western releases of the FLCL OSTs and a couple of their later albums.

After 12 years, the band had accrued enough hits to release a Best Of entitled *Fool on the Planet*, as well as a live DVD, *Busters on the Planet*. Before the years end, the band would also release their album *Smile*, a relatively eccentric and progressive album considering their tried and true rock formula was working so well for them. **Key Tracks:** [Fun Fun Fun OK!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUnB87bLVK8), [Monster CC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiNiZ0r_HRo), [Vain Dog (In Rain Drop)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eieBO0yLxWU) (could only find this cover), [Kono Yo No Hate Made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlnGM17wmDE)

There is a marked difference hear, in songwriting especially, while still loosely sticking to their rock persona. It's hard to explain, but definitely audible if you listen to the albums that immediately preceded this, and then Smile.

In 2002, the band released the album *Thank You, My Twilight* and the B-Side collection *Another Morning, Another Pillows*. **Key Tracks:** [Thank You My Twilight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btAjbge49N4), [Robotman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRnGz8fhBY), [shiroi natsu to midori no jitensha, akai kami to kuroi gitaa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM1pCoCuBnE). The band would release their album *Penalty Life** the following year, which would be their first CD licensed for release in the US (two years later). **Key tracks:** [Terminal Heaven's Rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p4-NymWskk), [Freebee Honey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtG3y4MLBxE) (all I could find), [I Know You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr97ZablLSU)

The following year would mark the band's 15th anniversary, and was celebrated with many releases. To start with, they rereleased their first major release, 90s My Life. This version, entitled *90s My Life Returns*, contained remasters of the original tracks, as well as additional tracks from early releases, such as  their 1991 Christmas album. They also released the ""self-cover"" album *Turn Back*, which was a collection of their early songs reworked by the band themselves, some sounding like a modern version of the original, while others contained revised/added sections. They also released a tribute album of other bands covering their songs entitled *Synchronized Rockers*, which features tracks chosen by a variety of popular artists such as Ellegarden, Mr. Children, Going Underground, and noodles. Still not finished, they released a documentary DVD entitled *Walking on the Spiral* and a new studio album, *Good Dreams*. **Key Tracks:** [Sono Mirai wa Ima](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj0BmZI1pYU), [New Years Eve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EclRzVOGo5Y#t=3m36s) It was a big year for the band in many ways.

The following year they'd release the DVD *916*, their 15th anniversary show recorded the previous year. That spring, they embarked on their first US tour, playing at SXSW in Austin, as well as an anime convention in Boston, and other locations such as NYC and San Francisco. This tour footage would be released as the *Delicious Bump Tour in USA* live DVD. 
 
2006 would see the release of their album *My Foot*, first in Japan and later that year in the US. The band returned to the states to tour in support of the album, as well as their first international stop in Mexico City. 

In 2007, the band switched labels again to the very prominent Avex Trax label, who also housed pop artists as famous as Do As Infinity, Ayumi Hamasaki, BoA, and Gackt. Their first release with the label would be the single [Scarecrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUcMyAzt2Ck) off of their new album *Wake Up!Wake Up!Wake Up!*. **Key Tracks:** [Century Creepers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK67hCWl320), [Boat House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkf1_qno2Eo). Scarecrow would be used as the ending song for the anime series Moonlight Mile. The band also released a 5 disc Best Of entitled *Lostman Goes to Yesterday*, which contained all of the singles from their time under the King Records label, as well as the 21 music videos released under the label. Simultaneously, they released the live DVD footage of their 2006 US tour, *Lostman go to America*.

The following year, the band released their new album, *Pied Piper*, which hosted a few singles such as [Tokyo Bambi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYGNM_gJrV4), [New Animal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwQ8ynOkaUw), and [Ladybird Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWajprtWpf8), which would be used as the theme song for the Japanese syndication of Cartoon Network's animated show Ben 10. The album charted at #13 and stayed on the charts for 9 weeks. 

The band returned to the US in 2008 with the second iteration of the Delicious Bump Tour in USA, again with female rock band noodles. They played again at SXSW, Anime Boston, and making other stops in NYC, Seattle, and SF. 

Upon returning to Japan, the band was offered the opportunity to share the stage with Oasis and open for them on their next show in Japan, however Sawao declined this invitation for unspecified reasons (although he later joked on the radio that it was so he could have a story to tell. 

In celebration of their 20th anniversary, the band issued a slew of releases, as with similar anniversaries. To start, the band released two dvds, *Pied Piper Goes to Yesterday* and *Blue Songs With Blue Poppies*, the latter of which was an acoustic concert they performed that year. They also released a pair of mini Best Of albums, a new single [Ameagari ni mita Maboroshi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoN7qINNAX0), the album OOPARTS (""Out of Place Artifacts"", an album of unreleased tracks and reworkings of fleshed out sketches of songs drudged from their rough draft works. Lastly, the band would hold a formidable performance at the Nippon Budokan arena, released the following year as the *Lostman Goes to Budokan* DVD.

In 2010, the band released the country-tinged single [Rodeo Star Mate](), used as the OP theme of a Japanese offshoot cartoon of Disney's Lilo and Stitch, as well as a new single [Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AdfHMFPml0) which would precede their new album *Horn Again*, released in early 2011.

That summer, the band would release a new single, [Comic Sonic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcwixTwUsmc), which would be used as the ED theme of the anime Sket Dance. They would soon return to the US again on their NAP Utatane tour, a 3-way tour with noodles and Japanese/American band All Ages. Bassist Jun Suzuki would not be apart of this tour, officially cited as due to a problem with his visa, and the bassist for the band monokuro was able to take his place last minute. Before the end of the year, they'd release the single [Energia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnepkYIkFgE), not to be confused with their early track Energy!

In January of the next year they'd release the album *Trial*, as well as a DVD of their NAP Utatane tour entitled *We Are Friends*. The album would reach #9 on the charts and stay for almost two months. **Key Tracks:** [Revival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGIVLWMpCaE), [Minority Whisper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uYa4QOxaCI)

Following the tour in support of that album, the band took some time off. Sawao, who had an ongoing side project as frontman of The Predators, would also release a solo album. Similarly, Manabe would release an instrumental rock guitar solo album entitled Rutile, as well as contribute to a similar-genre compilation album featuring a variety of Japanese guitarists. 

Their 25th anniversary in 2014 would be celebrated in a similar vain as past anniversaries. The band first released a second tribute album featuring a much more indie-centric artist lineup. Next, the band released *Our Black Flag*, a Blu Ray boxset of all the video releases to that point. They also released a Blu Ray/DVD release entitled *Revival of Motion Pictures*, featuring every single music video to date, as well as a few new clips and music videos created for early songs featuring unseen concert footage. The band released the single [Future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sa2uu-pCvMk), from which the title track and another song were recordings of songs that the band had played live but never released in the 90s. The feel is very reminiscent of their early works, which was a welcome change to some fans who found their latest works monotonous and tired. The band released two more singles that year, and finally, their latest album *Moondust*. **Key tracks:** [Tokai no Alice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Bgy_E0xANw), [About a Rock and Roll Band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1pNmDlGg88)

That same year, the band would undergo a series of three shows, each dedicated to their earlier movements. The band was joined by founding bassist Kenji Ueda for their first movement concert. Some of these songs had not been played live in over two decades, and it was a very special event for pillows fans, and was released as the *Do You Remember 2nd Movement?* DVD. The group concluded their anniversary celebration with a performance at Tokyo Dome City Hall, whose footage was used for the *Don't Forget Today* live DVD, and they released an album of unreleased tracks entitled *Bootleg the pillows 1992-1993*, sold only at that performance.

Following the festivities, the band started off 2015 touring in support of *Moondust*. However, following the tour, Sawao released a statement which described bassist Jun Suzuki's being let go from his position in the pillows. Citing ""bad conduct"", the unofficial word is that Suzuki's actions related to possibly drinking too much were too much for the band. It was speculated that this might have been a contributing factor to not participating in the 2011 US tour. As of yet there is no one officially named as the next bassist, although live shows throughout the year were played with ex-bassist Tatsuya Kashima, and more recently, the bassist from Vola and the Oriental Machine (who you may remember as the band created by ex-Number Girl and Zazen Boys drummer Ahito Inazawa).

2015 has been mostly quiet as far as releases go, hopefully 2016 will be different!

**Personal thoughts**

Where to begin...as previously mentioned, these guys are my favorite band. I got into them right after Good Dreams came out, and I was pissed because I saw that they were literally JUST playing in NYC and I missed them. It was on that tour that they were featured in the magazine Anime Insider, which I used to read pretty regularly back in the day when I was big into that scene. While I had never seen FLCL, I looked up the band and instantly fell in love. As such, I got in right before the release of My Foot, and when that hit I was enamored. The title track is still one of my favorites by them. But like most bands (and girls), when I fall, I fall hard. I was quickly in love with most everything they put out. I imported Thank You My Twilight first, as I'd heard the title track and really liked it, and soon fell in love with every song on that album when I brought it on a weekend field trip with my jr. high class (it arrived the day before I left, so I had to bring a discman and listen old school!) I soon was importing all I could find by them and scouring the internet for what I couldn't get physically. As it stands now, my collection nears 400 tracks, including a few live cuts, acoustics, covers, etc. And my physical collection is almost complete, as far as main CDs go, and a good amount of singles. I am a fanboy without a doubt. I don't know how to describe what it is I like about them, because it changes with every movement. I love their early work for it's infectious melodies and Ueda's background vocals. The jazzy years I love for their versatility and musical prowess, Manabe's guitar work is so good in this era. Their trinity of amazing albums is just that, and while I do agree the mid-late 2000s saw the band descending in quality, there are still gems to be sure. Then they do things like the Bootleg the pillows album and their Do You Remember 2nd Movement shows, and you can tell they still have it in them. That being said, they are getting old (they're ancient compared to some, all of them in their mid 50s). I feel like their move to Avex Trax was their major turning point as a drop in quality. I don't know if the new label, being so prominent, demanded too much, but they started releasing things at lightening speeds, and not always great quality. I hope to see an increase in quality, but looking back on almost 30 years of work, I think they've made their mark, and would understand if they decided to pack it in at some point. However, there are no signs of that happening, so I hope their next release is a good one! And definitely I hope they make it to the US for another tour in 2016! Their last tour in 2011 gave me hope, as they started branching out from the standard FLCL hits and playing more from their discography that American fans might not be familiar with. At least at the NYC show, that was met with a warm reception, so I hope they see that we love what they do outside of the show!

Ugh, that should probably be all, though I could probably write doubly this more...but anyway, sorry it's late, and thanks for reading all my write-ups this month!

One feature I would miss is the separate knobs for the dry level and the effect level. I love only hearing the effected sound and not hearing the dry.

To my knowledge, there is no way to do this with the Freeze, as it always plays the dry tone. But I was wondering if there were any mods that added this feature, or if there was some kind o manual work around you guys could think of so that the input sound would not play, or a way to get rid of  the dry sound quickly?

That'd make my switch a no brainer...but if I have to live without this feature, I could.

**Formation and Early Years**

In the year 2000, Futoshi put an ad on the website ""with9"" to form a band. OKP-STAR responded to this ad, as well as others, but that band dissolved within a year. However, the two stayed together in search of another project. In 2003, the pair recruited Daisuke, mayuko, and Abiko, and the band was formed, under the name AQUA TIMES. They won two *Shinseido* auditions in 2003 and 2004, and in 2004, they self released an album, *Kanashimi no Hate ni Tomoru Hikari*, which didn't sell that well. Around this time, their name was butchered in the press as AQUA TIMEZ, and the name stuck.

**Indie Label and Mounting Success**

The following year they were picked up by an independent label, MEGAFORCE CORPORATION, and in August of that year they released an EP titled *Sora Ippai ni Kanaderu Inori*. **Key track:** [Himawari](http://www.jukebo.com/aqua-timez/music-clip,himawari,q5vlfk.html). The album reached #1 on the Oricon charts and stayed in the top ten for 73 weeks, selling over half a million copies, a major success for an indie release. The song [Toushintai no Love Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-kO6n23Ydg) (cover version since there is no real video online), was written by Futoshi for his girlfriend's birthday and received extended radio airplay day in and day out.

**Major Label Career*

The following year, AQUA TIMEZ was signed by Epic Records, and released the EP *Nanairo no Rakugaki*, but not before Abiko parted ways with the band. They soon pick up new drummer TOSSHI and release their second single [Sen no Yoru wo Koete](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds60nJYwjok). The single charted at #5 and was used as the OP theme to the Bleach animated movie. Before the year's end, the band would release their first full length album, *Kaze wo Atsumete*. **Key track:**[Ketsui no Asa ni](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DknOR3vehN4). The album charted at #3 and stayed on the charts for 50 weeks. 

2007 saw the release of their second album, *Dareka no Chijou E*, which featured the single [ALONES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpxNljGXnUU), which would again be used in the anime Bleach, this time as an OP theme for the television series. The album peaked at #2. That same year, their single [Shiori](http://www.jukebo.com/aqua-timez/music-clip,shiori,qvzxz3.html) would be used in a television commercial, for ""Mitsuya Cider,"" and charted at #5. 

The following year, their single [Niji](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wverTDVtOQ) would be used as the OP theme for the dorama Gakusen 3, and the single [Natsu no Kakera](https://www.facebook.com/546006078772742/videos/562814280426816/) would be use as a theme for Fure Fure Shoujo.

In 2009, their single [Velonica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBqoLEP5zA8) was used again in the anime Bleach, as it's ninth OP song. Their third album, *Utai Sarishi Hana* is released in March and charts at #3, with the single [Pulmeria~Hana Uta~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFLRpKWrV6w) being used in the movie version of Gakusen.

I'm honestly not too familiar with the band after this point, but I know they've released a few more albums and a couple Best Of collections, which, if nothing else, are worth checking out.

**Personal Thoughts**

I got into AQUA TIMEZ from their first EP. I absolutely loved the two tracks from the album which I linked above. They're a little more poppy than I usually am into, but Futoshi's vocals always hook me, he writes some awesome melodies, and his rapping adds a nice flavor to the band. I really dug their whole rap/reggae fusion on some of their early songs, but I do get tired of them after a while, as they can be heavy on the ballads, which grow old on me fast. Nevertheless, their early works can always get me moving, and I plan on looking into their more recent work thanks to this write-up!

**Formation**


AKFG was formed in 1996 by Masafumi, Takahiro, and Kensuke when they met in a college music club. Kiyoshi joined the trio after parting ways with his previous band, and the line-up was solidified. Their early years consisted of playing cover songs and songs in English at University events and around Yokohama. In the year 2000, they self-released a couple EP's: *The Time Past and I Couldn't See You Again* and a split album with artist Caramelman. All of their early songs were written and sung in English, and they were sold at shows and online. The following year, they released another independent album, *I'm Standing Here*, which featured their first Japanese-language song [Kona Yuki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9ulURxQ_o4). The song would reappear on their major label debut and be their first massively popular single. They would start to see a major surge of popularity after it got airplay on a local Yokohama radio station, and as the scope widened on their popularity, they started touring around Japan. They also caught the eye of major labels. **Key track**: [Well....here's the whole EP since there aren't many individual tracks on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcqQY7QFKJc)


**Major Label Career**


The following year they'd release their debut ""mini-album"", *Hokai Amplifier* with Ki/oon Records, a Sony Music subsidiery, which landed at #35 on the Oricon charts. The album would feature their previous hit single, as well as one of their trademark hits, [Haruka Kanata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcLF9oo1ZPE), which would be used as an opening for the anime Naruto. **Key Track**:[Sunday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaS68M4DaG8)The album also started their relationship with radio host/artist [Yusuke Nakamura](http://fuckyeahyusukenakamura.tumblr.com/), who's trademark style can be seen on every AKFG album cover from the beginning and to this day. The band started touring heavily, including many stops on the summer rock festival circuit. That August they'd release their first major label single [Mirai no Kakera](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xc22e_mirai-no-kakera_music), followed by another hit single [Kimi to Iu Hana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umEGrzzzvBk&amp;index=2&amp;list=PLc5bg2WhZ7voGNWGUCxZEZiNyKPjzTltN) not long thereafter. They'd also host the first annual NANO-MUGEN music festival, which they've organized every year since, at the Shinjuku LOFT. Before the year's end, they'd release their first full length album *Kimi Tsunagi 5 M*, which sold a quarter of a million copies and landed them at #5 on the Oricon charts. **Key tracks**:[Understand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pihZjLEUAx0), [Mugen Glider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kTVtG-der4)


The band started off 2004 by winning Best New Artist and Best Music Video for Kimi to Iu Hana at the Space Shower TV Music Video Awards, and selling out their first solo tour which stopped in 13 cities around Japan. They'd play at over 10 festivals that summer and release four singles which preceded their landmark album *Sol-Fa*, which topped the Oricon charts for two weeks in a row and sold 600,000 copies. The album would be sold domestically in the U.S. and the single [Rewrite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePz7-s5dOck) would be one of the opening tracks to the anime Full-Metal Alchemist. **Key Tracks**: Literally every track is good...[Loop&amp;Loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-m_xijQ9U), [Kimi no Machi Made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQG8CvcErVU), [Last Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYwieL4CNtk), and [24ji](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9zgDnagDmI) The band would round out the year with continued touring.


Entering 2005, with their popularity at an all-time high, they'd begin extensive national touring, starting by selling out their 38 stop, 44 show Re:Re: tour. The band would release their first live DVD which topped the Oricon DVD charts for a month. That year they'd share the bill with seven other Japanese and British bands at the 5th annual NANO MUGEN FES, and release the first NANO MUGEN compilation album which featured a song from each band on the bill. They'd continue their annual summer festival tour and more touring, while releasing the single [Blue Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B88pR8zkEng) before the years end.


In 2006 they would release the single [World Apart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-riM2kKLXA), their first #1 single (which had the B-side [Uso to Wonderland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tguyNUqoig), the first song to feature Kita as lead vocals), and they also came to acquire their own recording studio, where they would record their album *Fanclub*, a solid release which debuted at #3 and had a nearly 2 month stay in the top 5. **Key Tracks**:[Waltz in Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_xhaof7Kj8), [Blackout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hxXvltZzto). Following the album, they'd sell out another national tour, host the NANO MUGEN FES which had grown to feature six Japanese bands, two American bands, and three UK bands. They also toured the summer festival circuit, for the first time having a spot on the main stage headlining the Fuji Rock Fest 06. They'd release a B-Side collection to celebrate their 10th anniversary that year, which also featured some reworked indie tracks and live cuts. Proving they could do no wrong, even an album with no new tracks was able to make it to #2 on the Oricon charts. They'd headline their first arena tour at the end of the year and into 2007, which hit 8 cities and featured both Japanese and American bands as opening acts. The band was asked to compose a theme song for the animated movie Tekkon Kinkreet, for which they wrote their single [Aru Machi no Gunjo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6n_1h-3RvY). ;


Following their arena tour, the band withdrew a bit from the public eye, (taking a well deserved break I'd imagine). They played various summer festivals, but even held off on their own annual festival. However, by years end, fans were relieved with the single [After Dark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txc15StkB3g), which would be used as an opening track for the anime Bleach. They ended the year with a concert in South Korea and a New Years concert in Japan, but remained silent and working on their next album. 


In early 2008, the band released their single [Korogaru Iwa, Kimi ni Asa ga Furu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NCGRcz6Qko), which preceded their album *World World World* which debuted at #1. **Key Tracks**:[Night Diving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHmUn5TudCg), [Travelogue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZQX66lyfAM) (following a Re:Re intro jam). That summer they'd also release a ""mini-album"" entitled *Mada Minu Ashita ni*, which featured the single [Mustang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I66V76IGcA), which hit #15 on the newly created Japan Hot 100 charts. They opened for Third Eye Blind in July of that year at Yokohama Bay Hall, who would join that year's lineup of their NANO MUGEN FES. 2008's NANO MUGEN compilation album was the first to chart, reaching #18, and the AKFG song written just for that album [Natsusemi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kLWlvFwj3I), reached #36 on the Japan Hot 100 charts, even though they didn't even release it as a single. They'd also share the stage with one of their inspirations, Weezer, at their tour stops in both Osaka and Tokyo. Before the year's end, they'd release [Fujisawa Loser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vng7bvIK_WM) as a single before releasing the album *Surf Bungaku Kamakura* shortly after. You can hear some Weezer influence here for sure. **Key tracks**:[Enoshima Esuka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGsxPoa4Ir8), [Inamuragasaki Jane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkSfedpIo50).


2009 would feature extensive touring and various festival appearances. Their concerts started to evolve, featuring more intensive backdrops and sets, as well as featuring other instruments such as strings, or orchestras. The band released their single [Shinseiki no Love Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9qJsRhpo10), as well as the single [Solanin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCwtmCxJgik) which they created as the theme for the live action movie of the same name. 


In 2010, the band recorded two songs in New York City. They'd create the opening theme to The Tatami Galaxy, an anime which featured character designs from their album graphic artist Yusuke Nakamura. The song would become the single [Maigoinu to Ame no Beat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_AmxbyI7Po). That summer they released their album *Magic Disk*. **Key tracks**:[Sayonara Lost Generation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArBRNwW9ohM), [Kakuu Seributsu no Blues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RbnUctDOgM).


Their Spring 2011 tour was cut short due to the terrible earthquake/natural disaster that struck the country in March. The disaster inspired the song [Suna no Ue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8o_aD1yPtw). That summer, their usual festival circuit included a stop at the Jisan Valley Rock Festival in South Korea. In November, they released a new single, [Marching Band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ--ELYv9AU), which was featured on their Best Of album which they released at the beginning of the following year.


2012 featured extensive touring and countless singles, most notably [Kakato de Ai o Uchinarase](http://fansoop.com/2012/10/pv-asian-kung-fu-generation-kakato-de-ai-wo-uchinarase-subbed/), which was composed by Kita, and [Sore dewa, Mata Ashita](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZgeE4_s75M), which was featured as the closing theme for Naruto the Movie. They'd release their album *Landmark* that year, and round out the year touring in support of that album. **Key Tracks**:[All Right Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSwS1lsCUOw), [Machine Guns to Keiyoshi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsWxlZB8LXs), [AtoZ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hE7QlYzUT4)


The following year, they released the single [Ima wo Ikite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnerUALrcPg) which was featured in the movie Yokomiche Yonosuke. 2013 would also mark their 10 year anniversary on a major label, and they celebrated with their first European tour, stopping in London, Paris, and Cologne, as well as a small tour of Asia with stops in Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. They also celebrated with a two day concert at Yokohama Stadium, where they invited bands like ex-Ellegarden frontman Takeshi Hosomi's The Hiatus, the Rentals, Fujifabric, and Straightener, who joined them on their Asia Circuit tour, and who also were celebrating a 10 year anniversary.


The year 2014 was another year of withdrawing and resting, with markedly less touring, and a second B-Side collection, *Feedback File 2*. **Key Tracks:**[Slow Down](https://vimeo.com/74862114), [Rolling Stone](https://vimeo.com/74861823). They would again record in the USA, this time at the private studio of The Foo Fighters, Studio 606 in LA, where they recorded entirely their 2015 release *Wonder Future*. The album reached #4 on the Oricon charts and stayed on the charts for almost 4 months. They broadcasted a live webcast world-wide of the final stop on their tour in support of the album. They toured Europe again, and are currently in the midst of their first Latin American tour with stops in Argentina, Chile, Brazil, and Mexico. **Key tracks**:[Standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgzxDo2hVuI), Signal on the Street, Eternal Sunshine (no links :() .


**Personal Thoughts**


This has been super long, and very extensive, because AKFG is probably my second favorite Japanese band, oftentimes probably even tied for first place. I got into them around the time that Fanclub came out, but the first album I ever heard was actually Sol-Fa, and I was instantly hooked. Super catchy, but equally rocking, Sol-Fa to me is an absolute masterpiece. Every track is great. I quickly imported their previous albums and have been following them ever since. They are a tremendous live band, and I really hope with all my heart that next year they will tour the US. The European and Latin American tours this year keeps me hopeful, and interviews from these tours say that they hope to tour the US eventually. They're a band who have changed up vibes but have kept largely the same style throughout their whole career. There is a marked difference to me between their early releases and the more recent ones. *Landmark* really shows their maturity as musicians, with many tracks having a much more polished feel. Their most recent album is great in my opinion, I watched their live webcast and they're as tight as ever. The new material is just as catchy as ever, with a definite Foo Fighters inspiration in songs like [Easter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEsdTOjXfFk).

**Formation**


Shutoku Mukai brought the first incarnation of the band together in 1995 to play an event in Fukuoka. Taking previous members of the band Cowgirl (and Mukai previously being in a band called Number Five), together they created Number Girl. This lineup, however, was short lived. Having quickly disbanded, Mukai got in touch with bassist Kentaro Nakao, who knew Hisako Tabuchi, a light tech at a local concert hall. Mukai knew of Inazawa from the local rock scene and the winning line-up was formed. They quickly self-released two demos before being picked up by indie label Automatic Kiss, where they debuted their first album *School Girl Bye Bye*, with their first single [Drunken Hearted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qriAeeL15yc). Key Tracks: [Omoide in My Head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJIYZGs4iJs) (picked this live version because it embodies everything I love about them), [Sentimental Kajou](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0A3qPuHPJY), [Iggy Pop Fanclub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf9PtnwPO6A).


**Major Label Shift and More**


Number Girl started touring the following year and playing shows in the famed live music district of Tokyo, Shimokitazawa where their ""fast, guitar-driven rock""  quickly gained the attention of major labels and their popularity skyrocketed. They signed with major label Toshiba EMI in 1999 and released their first major label single with [Tomei Shoujo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8to6ZZEzjU0) off of their major label debut *School Girl Distortional Addict*. Key track: [Hadashi no Kidesu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgtgmoKkRWA) and [Eight Beater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GVMjBl1YTA).


Following just their debut album, Number Girl sealed their fate as a huge indie rock act, and started touring nationally with such acts as Bloodthirsty Butchers and Eastern Youth. Later that year they released the single [Destruction Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovkODVyrtiw) with the producer Dave Fridmann, most famous for his work with the Flaming Lips. It was a winning combination, and the band entered the studio in 2000 with Fridmann to record their third album *Sappukei.* This album really shined, with a much sharper sound than previous albums while still retaining their endearing lo-fi feel. Key tracks: [Tattoo Ari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqM5tPNsseU), [Sasu-You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLIwrK2Fg4), [Zegen Vs Undercover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFmA7iFApKw).


Number Girl hit the states with Polysics in that year and continued touring Japan as one of the biggest indie rock acts on the scene. They combined forces with Fridmann once again in 2002 to create what would become their final album, *Num-Heavymetallic*. Their was a distinct shift in sound with this album, notable by the increased experimentation with effects, rhythm, and vocal styles. Mukai adopted a very punk style of vocals which ranged from screaming to more or less spoken word. Key tracks: [Cibicco San](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05fruBXGEPk), [Num-ami-dabutz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDoNX0lRL1g), [Num-Heavymetallic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkRRvCNbRB0).


The band set out on a 30+ stop national tour in support of the album, however suddenly announced their disbandment in September of that year. While there was no official reasoning for the break-up, it is known that Nakao had decided to step down from the band, and it is likely that the group decided just not to replace him. It was clear that they each had more to give however, as they would each remain active in the music scene for the years to come.


Number Girl have come to be known as one of the biggest and most influential Japanese indie rock acts, and have inspired such acts as Base Ball Bear, Asian Kung-Fu Generation (who I'll be writing about shortly), tricot, Art School, and plenty more.


**Post-Number Girl**


Each member would work on a number of projects following the dissolution of the band.


**Kentaro Nakao**


* [Sloth Loves Chunks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2Ulrir8EfA)

* [Seagull Screaming Kiss Her Kiss Her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs2TxHT_Qks)


* He would also support bands such as Mass of the Fermenting Dregs, dry as dust, The Salovars, hammer, and fast Tokyo when they needed a bassist to fill in.


**Hisako Tabuchi**


* Tabuchi would go on to join the Bloodthirsty Butchers in 2004, who I did a write-up on as well. I mentioned their she also created her own band Toddle, and joined forces as part of the supergroup LAMA. She's been covered pretty in depth lol


*Following the break-up, Mukai and Inazawa stuck together in forming the band [Zazen Boys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv2kPCds56Y).....[live version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlW00qCzNaY) (I always thought they were much better live), basically picking up where *Num-Heavymetallic* left off, with the same heavy experimentation and screaming vocals. (I personally couldn't ever get into them...) However, they also had separate projects. Inazawa left Zazen Boys in 2005.


**Shutoku Mukai**


* [Mukai Shutoku Acoustic and Electric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxJlWyYOZe4)

* BEYONDS


**Personal Thoughts**


I love me some Number Girl. They fit in snugly amidst the many 90s alternative and indie lo-fi rock that can sound so bad yet so good. They're another one of those bands who can seem to play super sloppy, but makes it part of their sound. They sound like their falling apart sometimes, and yet that's when their brilliance shines through.

Jun Seba|Turntables/Production|

**BIO**

This one might turn out a little short, like my last one, but for a different reason...Seba was by all accounts a private person, and didn't do too many interviews or anything.

**Nujabes** is the moniker of Jun Seba (an anagram of his name reversed). Born in 1974 in Tokyo, it is unknown how or when Seba developed a love for hip-hop, but by 1996, he was an active DJ on the scene in Tokyo, and in 1998 he formed Hydeout Productions, an independent label, with friend and rapper/producer shing02. That year saw his first mixtape release, [*Sweet Sticky Thing*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlMn8T9LJbM), followed by an official EP *Ain't No Mystery*. These early works are marked by a heavy R&amp;B influence which was later evolved to involve more jazzy mixes.

The early 2000s were when he really gained popularity. He collaborated with a large selection of underground rappers from around the world including Japan, the US, and England. In 2003 he released his first full length album, Metaphorical Music. **Key tracks:** [Lady Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9QHak8h1AQ), [Summer Gypsy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEJuw9eNNnU), [Horn in the Middle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUYNsDwY-LM). The album was met with critical acclaim, and by many accounts considered ""a masterpiece"" and ""groundbreaking.""

Furthermore, he was chosen to make up the majority of the OST to the anime *Samurai Champloo,* where many of you may have heard his track [Battlecry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OS-b5nt88Yk) as its theme song, which was off of his first album.

Following these successes, Seba released follow-up *Modal Soul*, which expanded on his jazz/hip-hop hybrid style, combining songs with vocals and instrumentals. **Key Tracks**:[Reflection Eternal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qU2MXeAz1E), [Music Is Mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-2hNsVh0zA), [World's End Rhapsody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDK_3VkkYRE), and [Modal Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrO9PTpuSSs).

Seba opened a few record stores in Shibuya, Tribe Records and Guiness Records. He released a second Hyde-out Productions collection in 2007 with notable tracks [Imaginary Folklore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgXxDFvfdhM) and [Counting Stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJWLDCdOvwM). 

Nujabes released a few more albums after that, a compilation album of songs which inspired him that he remastered, and a Hyde-out compilation where he produces two songs. Tragically, however, Seba was killed in a motor vehicle accident in 2010 at the age of 36. 

Posthumously, shing02 has continued Hyde-out Productions, and even released Nujabes final album of unreleased material in 2011, entitled *Spiritual State*. This album shows that Seba still had so much to give. **Key Tracks:** [Spiritual State](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0AvO0oBmUA), [Color of Autumn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uZQtXNOESs), and [Prayer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1I24eyv7XM).

**Personal Notes** 

I really love Nujabes vibe, I can lay back with my eyes closed and get lost in the music, I can appreciate the talented lyricism of many of his collaborators, or I can just throw it on in the background. No matter how I approach it, it's just very solid musicianship. He had a great ear for producing, he makes things flow in a magical way, and his choice of samples is so all over the place it's awesome. 

I highly recommend the entire series of Love(sic) tracks (I believe there are 6 scattered throughout all of his releases and posthumously (the final one was made off of a track found on Seba's phone after his death). They all feature shing02 rapping over Seba's beats and his lyricism is really great. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCmT8QMyUwU) part 1 to get you started!

I also recommend, slightly unrelated, Japanese band *toe's* cover of [Reflection Eternal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHt0arrZTSw).

Also, if you are into the production aspect at all, this breakdown of the [same track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z08nQGL1QQs) is awesome, and gives a glimpse of Seba's process/sample choices.

I also really dig his work with Saxophonist Uyama Hiroto, such as the aforementioned *Spiritual State*, but also [Next View](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEv6VJCjDrg) and [Island](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf3ymTSHinA).

**Beginnings**

GOING UNDER GROUND actually formed in 1991 when all the core members met in middle school, but after many line-up changes, they debuted in 1998 with live shows around their hometown of Okegawa. They took their name from the song by British artists *The Jam*. They are often also affectionately referred to as just *Going* in the press.

They released their first album on the indie label *DNA Capsules*, and after a few early label jumps, settled with major label *Victor Entertainment* in 2001, where they debuted with their first major single [Graffiti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh5fs5Zl9GQ&amp;spfreload=10). From there, they only gained prominence. In 2009, keyboardist Ito Yoichi left the band. The following year, they switched labels to *Pony Canyon*. Then, in 2014, drummer Kono Takehiro stepped away from the band as well. 

**PERSONAL STATEMENT**

Sorry, but combined with their not being much about them out there in English, and the lack of youtube videos for them, this is a lot shorter than I had hoped, but being one of my recent favorites, I felt they should be more known! GOING UNDER GROUND is a great rock band, but are also very melodic. They also have great instrumentation, and instruments you don't always see in J-Rock, like keyboard and strings. Their songs are also really catchy, so I'll just let them speak for themselves! Their best albums in my opinion are Heartbeat and h.o.p.s., but they have a Best Of and Singles collection that covers all the bases.

Quruli was formed in 1996 when Kishida, Sato, and Mori met at a music club at Ritsumeikan University. They decided to name themselves Quruli after a sign in a subway station in their hometown of Kyoto (Quruli is a Japanese onomatopoeic phrase for turning or revolving). The trio got right to writing material and recording demos. Their first cassette tape demo, called Quruli no Ichikaiten (One Quruli Revolution) was released that same year.

In 1997, after another cassette demo release, the band was signed with independent label *Bad News Records*, where they re-recorded many of these tracks as their debut album, *Moshi Moshi*, which was released in November of 1997.

Their second album, Fandelier, was released the following year, gaining major label attention. In 1998 they were signed with a subset of the major label *Victor Entertainment* and released their debut single [Tokyo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE11p7uYljg), which anticipated their first major label debut, *Sayonara Stranger* in 1999. Key Track: [Niji](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAxvKBzxjSY)

Quruli continued gaining fans during the early 2000s with hit albums like *Zukan* and *Team Rock*, produced by the great Jim O'Rourke. Key Tracks:[Machi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcSzKsJyn5w) The band would see some line-up changes in the following years. In 2001, while creating *The World is Mine*, the band added second guitarist Tasshin Omura, and the following year, Mori would leave the band. They would fill his place with mostly session drummers to start, but in 2003 they secured Christopher McGuire as a permanent replacement. That same year, HMV ranked Quruli at number 74 on their list of Top 100 Pop Artists. [Worlds End Supernova](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftSVF9CkT1g)

In 2004 the band released *Antenna*, and following the tour in support of that record, McGuire left the band. The following year, many singles were released, as well as the full length album *Nikki*. Key tracks:[Birthday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oUE28LR85I)

The band released Tanz Walzer in 2007, which they recorded in Vienna with the Ambassade Orchester Wien. 

In May of 2010, they released a B-side collection, *Boku no Sundeita Machi*, which would be their first album to reach #1 on the Oricon charts. [Kiseki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHTHUbw1U1Q)

At present, the two original members perform with session musicians as their live support band.

**BIO**

Snowkel is an alt-rock trio that started in 2004 in Fukuoka. As per usual, they started with heavy local touring and selling their own CDs at these shows. They released two indie releases in 2004-2005, their self-titled and the *Sora Colorful* EP. This garnered enough attention to be picked up by the Sony Music label, and immediately with their first major label release, *Snowkel Snorkel*, they were a hit. The single [Namikaze Satellite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcMps_mpAb8) was used as an opening theme to the anime *Naruto*. It also spawned singles [Tabibito Beginner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UprELeECMQI) and [Ooki na Mizutamari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8or6mfC7Y0c). 

In 2006 they released the single [Solar Wind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2XWh5Y5Vo) which would appear on their sophomore release *EQ*. It was also used as an ending theme for the anime *Kiba*. That same year they did the festival circuit in Japan, and *EQ* would also spawn a following single [kiseki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73kVXCjX8pg) which was used as an ending theme for the anime *Gintama.*

And that was that. They announced a hiatus soon after, which was briefly disrupted only by a Best Of release, though they still didn't tour. In 2010 they officially announced a disbandment with a farewell tour.

HOWEVER, unbeknownst to me, and thanks to this write-up, I have learned that they reunited to take the stage in December of 2014, and announced that they have resumed band activities. They've apparently been touring Japan, and this year even did a tour of Latin America. They have a scheduled release this December entitled *EYE*. I'm super excited!

**PERSONAL THOUGHTS** 

I found these guys through the Namikaze Satellite music video, randomly on Youtube and immediately loved their sound. I imported Snorkel which was the only album they had out at the time and fell in love with it. They have a really great sound, and as a guitarist I really admire Nishi's work, he has a lot of great sounding chord progressions. Their singles are all really good, but a lot of lesser known songs are good as well. I'd recommend [100,000 HP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlPajbTM_GA), [Pantomime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJeSTGFEmZM), and [62](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SfibmyE-64).

Kenji Watanabe|everything|

Suneohair is the stage name of multi-instrumentalist Kenji Watanabe. Watanabe began touring and sending demos to labels in 1998 after graduating college, and the following year he was picked up by an independent label and released his debut *SU!NEO!AIR*. He released two more EPs and two singles with this label, but in 2002 he was picked up by Sony Music's sub-label EPIC Records and released his first major label release, *Sunestyle*, which spawned a hit with the single [Ivory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cOd2j2Ly50). 

He has a pretty broad discography with a steady output of almost an album a year...he may be best known outside of Japan for his endings to the anime Honey and Clover, [Waltz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ltDlYxo59A) and [Split](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTYLmDv4Hq4).

I really enjoy most of what he does, but my favorite album would have to be *a watercolor*, with the standout tracks [Uguisu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNWFhG_v5ZU) and [Pinto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYLDSsyWmaM).

**Formation**

noodles, stylized as such, always lowercase and without a ""the"", formed in 1991 when the four young women met at a part-time job in Yokohama. They had never played instruments before, but thought it'd be fun and all picked up their respective instruments and started to play together. Their early years were marked by live shows, mainly in Yokohama, and later all around Japan.

**Debut**

 Gaining recognition, in 1994 they were signed to the independent Benten record label. They released their first album *The Gravity Thief* a year later. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQQ3A31TFb4) the title track. In this year, they also wrote a moderately successful song for a Coke commercial, which became popular on the radio. 

Their early years were mostly unremarkable as far as major successes are concerned. They released a number of albums and EPs with Benten throughout the 90s, but none garnered too much critical acclaim. These albums, starting with *Slow Coaster* all had a much girlier theme, reflected by the album covers and songs themselves, which was a noticable shift from their debut. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtW4bNgVCbs) a clip from the title track of that one.

**Major Label Recognition**

In 1999, Delicious Label, owned by pillows' frontman Sawao Yamanaka, signed noodles, which became their turning point. From here, they really found their sound and started writing straight up catchy rock songs, a la their influences Weezer, the Breeders, and the Pixies. From here they focused much more heavily on putting out records and touring Japan. 

2001's Long Long Chain was a breakout album for them, and they really started gaining a following, thanks to hit singles [Hush Bell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv7AoGzISYY) and [Booster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLN6q4RElDA). They continue touring and gaining fans, aided by their next album *God Cable*, and the single [She, Her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrWN9cvk5o0). In that same year, they opened for the Breeders in Japan, and underwent their first tour in the United States, broadening their fanbase. 

2004 saw the release of the *Fuzz Hill* EP. However, soon afterwards, lead guitarist Junko decided to step away from the band citing personal reasons. This left the trio that is still making music today, with Yoko taking full guitar duties. 

noodles toured the U.S. on the NAP Utatane tour with the pillows in 2005, which was documented on DVD. They also released their first album as a trio was Ivy, which had the single [Lemon Grass Foo Foo](
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4abo24WOuM). It received mixed reviews, which worried some about their direction following the departure of Junko, but the following year, they release [Cover Me Shakespeare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1Bclkkuhc), get their own radio show, and provide music for the film *Love My Life*. They wrote two songs specifically for the film, as well as a bunch of other tracks being used in the movie. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVJ0LBZhFf4) is the title track of the film of the same name.

Their next album, Metropolis, was pretty popular and increased their prominence with [Glasgow Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF2Ud8BC2ZM) being used as the title them for TV show *Battlefield of a Girl's Life*. The same show used a cover of their song [mellow metallica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dix0ERWODFM) for the ending theme.

Their following releases were somewhat unregarded. They toured the US again in '09, this time only the West Coast, and recorded a couple tracks in San Francisco while they were over here. They also released their Best Of album, which features two ""remix"" tracks done by the pillows' Sawao Yamanaka and Yoshiaki Manabe. 2010, saw the release of Explorer, again, somewhat glanced over critically. *Mellow Metallica* was again used in a TV show though, this time, the ending theme for anime *Mutant Girls Squad*. 

The following year they celebrated their 20th anniversary with a show at Shibuya's famous CLUB QUATTRO, which resulted in a special DVD release of the show. They also released *Funtime*, which had the single [We Are Noodles From Sentimental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xT2RCjsCjcc), finally getting back into the spotlight after a few dull releases. 

2013 saw the release of a special cover album entitled *Make Up to Break Up*, which featured a collection of covers including Weezer's *Photograph* and Green Day's *Macy's Day Parade*, as well as a solid cover of *Wave of Mutilation* (a popular cover song for J-Rock bands it seems!). Yoko also did a handful of solo acoustic shows, doing a few solo tracks as well as stripped down versions of noodles songs. 

Their latest release, *Loafers on the Japantown* gave us a single in [Bootleg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3d6JRi9XGo). The girls are still going strong to this day, coming up on their 25th anniversary as a band!

**FORMATION**

Ellegarden was formed in December of 1998 when Shinichi Ubukata came to Takeshi Hosomi looking for a vocalist for his new project he was writing music for. Hosomi was, at the time, working as a computer engineer, and welcomed the opportunity, as he was working on material himself at the time. Having a strong background in English (I've heard it attributed to a foreign roommate, being in a cover band and playing English language songs, or his time spent working in California), he often found himself writing in that language. This gave them a distinction out of many other similar bands. Hosomi would go on to write most of Ellegarden's music and lyrics throughout their career. Their early years would be full of mostly touring, playing small clubs around Japan.

**SIGNING TO DYNAMORD**

In 2001, Ellegarden signed to the Dynamord label and started actually releasing material, their first release being a self-titled EP and the single [Bare Foot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2vTuB7w3mU). Their first full length album would follow in 2002, and they'd go on to release an album a year throughout their career. Notable track: [Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWsva6lLlxs)

2003's release *Bring Your Board!!* would see the release of hit single [Jitterbug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzUEhfeI0cA), but it wasn't until 2005's *Riot on the Grill* that the band really launched to stardom. Selling more than a quarter of a million copies, and reaching number 3 on the Oricon charts, *Riot on the Grill* featured tracks [Marry Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJoG3phbpvw) (chose a live cut since it's pretty close to the studio version, and you get a sense of their live show) and hit single [Missing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3pt5W_XzA). In 2004, however (noting this just because I'm a huge pillows fan), they added a cover of [Funny Bunny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmFipnTgMac) to the pillows tribute album *Synchronized Rockers*.

**CONTINUED SUCCESS**

2006's *Eleven Fire Crackers* also topped the charts, this time hitting number 1 and selling more than 100k copies more than *Riot on the Grill*. *Eleven Fire Crackers* was also their first North American release on the Nettwerk label, and is undeniably their strongest album. Their punchy, fast-paced punk rock had been refined and hit a high point. Key tracks: [Firecracker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6ht8aySJw) and [Space Sonic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGxpdF-pqpI).

 Following this huge success, Ellegarden played through the summer festival circuit in Japan, appearing at Fuji Fest, Summer Sonic, Nano Mugen Fest, and the Rising Sun Rock Festival. They shared stages with the Foo Fighters and Sum 41, and continued extensive touring. They played a small, 7 city tour in North America, including a successful SXSW appearance which garnered an encore from the enthusiastic audience. 

In late 2007, they started working on a new album. It isn't known if they were able to get anything down, but in May 2008, this message was posted on their website: 

&gt; Ellegarden has been in the process of creating a new album since last year, however, during the band’s activities, there arose a difference in opinion regarding the motivation for creating a new album. We no longer feel we are able to create an album that we would be satisfied with, and after much discussion we arrived at the conclusion to end the creation of the album and suspend the band’s activities indefinitely. All previously decided shows (including shows not yet announced) up until early September 2008 will still be performed. We want to thank everyone who has supported Ellegarden from the bottom of our hearts. In order to once again create new music as Ellegarden, each of us wants to work on our own personal growth and development. Thank you for everything."" -Ellegarden leader, Shinichi Ubukata

However, the band continued to perform live, and would release their Greatest Hits album as a send-off, consisting of 21 songs spanning their career. They continued the festival circuit in the summer of 2008, and culminated with 2 shows at Zepp Osaka, and 2 shows at Shinkiba Studio Coast in early September, 2008. These were the last performances of Ellegarden to date. 

**POST-ELLEGARDEN PROJECTS**

The fact that they are ""indefinite hiatus"" leaves many fans wondering. They never officially disbanded, and the message on their website said they wanted to expand individually as musicians, which they have all done. Who knows if we will see Ellegarden play together again...

* Vocalist Takeshi Hosomi formed the group *The Hiatus* with other musicians who were on hiatus at the time, Ichiyo Izawa from Tokyo Jihen, Takashi Kashikura of toe, and Koji Ueno of Thee Machine Gun Elephant. Their debut album, *Trash We'd Love* reached number 1 on the Oricon charts. My favorite track is [Ghost in the Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIIwMtYuXP8)

* Guitarist Shinichi Ubukata formed *Nothing's Carved in Stone,* a similar rock/punk outfit. Their debut album, *Parallel Lives* hit number 11 on the Oricon charts in 2009. Key track: [Around the Clock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8JsilVZnv8)

* Bassist Yuichi Takada is now apart of the band *Meaning* Not too familiar with them to be honest...but here's a track. Considerably heavier than Ellegarden's catalog! [The Unbroken Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayZ-2j0vtKc)

* Drummer Hirotaka Takahashi formed the band *Scars Borough* Here's track [セマシャンブル](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOFmITRldcI&amp;list=PLfx45SFSoZB7YN3whZE_WM3WVgYNmVKcq&amp;index=3). Takahashi also drums for the side project of Sawao Yamanaka of *the pillows* fame. Their band is called *The Predators*, and also features Jiro, bassist of *GLAY*. Takahashi replaced the original drummer, Shinpei Nakakyama, of *Straightener* fame. Key track: [Nightless City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIzbvVue8dY)

**RELATED BANDS**

It seems Takeshi has an even newer band, called MONOEYES, as early as this year. Hadn't heard about them, but now we know!

Also, Straightener is a pretty solid alternative rock outfit who might be enjoyed by Ellegarden fans.

**HISTORY**
Bloodthirsty Butchers was formed in 1986 by the 3 core members listed above. Not much is known of their early years, though I'd classify them as an underground hit. Their albums *birdy* and *kocorono* have received the most critical acclaim. Notable tracks: Jack Nicholson (no link), [story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvaDjp5XcPs) They even released a couple tracks on compilations put out by Washington state-based ""Yoyo"" label.

In 2003, Hisako Tabuchi of Number Girl fame joined the band as a second guitarist. She remained with them until 2013 when vocalist Hideki Yoshimura suddenly and tragically passed away at age 46. The band decided to stop touring following his death, but there were 2 post-humous releases of new and unreleased tracks. Looking at their site now, it appears they have re-released many albums as well.



**Musical Style**

Bloodthirsty Butchers is a combination of alternative rock, punk, and noise rock, in my opinion. Some of their stuff is very melodic and traditional alternative/indie rock sounding, but they also have heavier, fast paced songs with punk-like vocals. They also have a number of instrumentals with heavy fuzzed out guitars. To liken them to a Western band, I'd say they remind me a lot of Dinosaur Jr. or Sonic Youth.



**RELATED ACTS**

[toddle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Euem1rEdQaE): Band created by member Hisako Tabuchi, similar tonally, but with female vocals. Really great stuff.

After they disbanded, she joined Bloodthirsty Butchers, and finally created Toddle. Her guitar work is very much a staple of all these bands.

[Eastern Youth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClmSjxj7mdE): Playing more to BTB's punk sensibilities, Eastern Youth is a straight up punk rock band which is really fun to listen to.

Honorable mention:

*Lama* (another group featuring Hisako Tabuchi. This one's a collaborative project, a ""supergroup"" if you will, also featuring members of Supercar and agraph.)

*+/-* (Did a split album with BTB entitled ""Bloodthirsty Butchers vs. +/-""



**Personal Thoughts**

So to round this post out, I'd just like to stay that I really dig these guys. It honestly took me a while to get into them, because I'm big on melody, and at times, it just sounded like noise to me. But the more I listened, Yoshimura's voice really resonated with me, and the guitar work is awesome. The one thing I had to get used to was that I feel BTB has a real punk sensibility. They are not perfect, but they like that. A lot of their guitar work can be sloppy even, but it works for the sound they make, and it becomes endearing. They're all very talented musicians. The post-humous releases showed that if Yoshimura had not sadly passed away, they would still be making awesome music to this day!

And finally, sorry, but Youtube really butchered (pun intended) the discog of BTB, I couldn't link to most of my faves due to their new region coding of videos, but if your curiosity is piqued, youtube them yourself, it's worth it!",japanesemusic,"[Discussion] 30 Days of J-Rock: Day 3, Bloodthirsty Butchers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/japanesemusic/comments/3rf9ov/discussion_30_days_of_jrock_day_3_bloodthirsty/

First, 2 pedals whose wiring is a little iffy. They both work, but the signal gets fuzzy/crackly on the phaser, and with the trem, if you don't slam on the switch, the signal cuts out. Both should be easy wiring issues and I think these would be great projects for people, and if they get them up and running, they get two cool pedals on the cheap. The phase in particular sounds really good.

BYOC phaser...I have a small stone nano and I really don't phase all that much, so the second phaser should go...has a rate and depth knob, cool sound. The wiring is a little iffy, idk who built it but the pots are scratchy. As such, selling cheap, but would probably be a cheap fix....45$

Also have a BYOC tremolo, also would ask 45$ or both for 75$ the trem has a faulty switch, you have to really stomp on it to engage or else it cuts out. Again, an easy fix, so selling cheap.

Monoprice Fuzz mini pedal 30$ shipped (pretty sweet fuzz with clean blend, can get thick and gated or thin and zippery...like new CIB)

Turn on, works normally except the left joystick is broken. Doesn't respond and sometimes sticks left. Selling cheap, would be good for light gaming/netflix/whatever, could use directionals for most games if you want to ignore the joystick issue.

I also did a quick search and saw they sell replacement joysticks and there is a video on youtube for how to replace it. I'm not handy, but if you are, give it a shot. No guarantees though.

EdIT: so after playing with it a bit this AM, the joystick is stuck up not left. When I went to the ps store, it read as if I was holding the joystick up, which was a pain to navigate, but possible by going down further than what you want to select and let it scroll up for you and time it right to get what you want lol... Furthermore, I tried out ""ninja gaiden 2 Sigma Plus"" on it, and it was unplayable due to the fact that the directional had different functions than motion, so you couldn't move the character. So idk what games will work and what wont, but like I said it can be a Netflix machine, portable media device, etc. Just fine. I used it exclusively for remote play via an alternative account so I could use the dual shock 4 with it. Worked great.

Asking 80 shipped for the system, case, 8GB memory card, and charger...will throw in some games if you want, we can discuss pricing.

Solidgold FX If 6 Was 9 - I always loved the look of this pedal and still do, but it is also the exact kind of fuzz facey fuzz I've been looking for. Versatile as hell, with the bias to the left, the fuzz is fat and gated, even velcro like and zippery at times, to use fuzzy terms. To the right, it's brighter and has a pleasant high end without being shrill. It's nailing that vintage FF tone for me, I love rocking Hendrix licks through it.

Barber Gain Changer - again, super versatile which I love. I've had this od for a few months now and still haven't fully unearthed all the sounds out of it, between the two 3 way switches on top I can dial in a plethora of tones, and my favorite thing is dynamics. It's what I look for in an overdrive, wth my strat at 6 I get light bluesy breakup, and up at 10 on the volume knob I get heavy rocking overdrive.

EHX Superego - waited out til the price was right and found a good deal on this and it blows me away. The glis knob is awesome. I used to have a freeze pedal I loved, but the additions on this baby is worth it for me. I love turning the effect sound up and cutting the dry, it's like im not even playing guitar anymore. If you're on the fence about pulling the trigger on this one, do it. I'm sure you won't regret it.
