You ~~should WAIT.~~ shouldn't wait.

I played SWGOH for a long time, I quit because I was tired of slow releases and some balance issues, but I can say that I knew people who spends thousands on the game when Force Awakens cam out.

**The money you spend on this game helps contribute to its life.** If you love it and want to see it succeed then spend 100 dollars on it, but spend it on time limited promotions and what you want.

The packs available are mostly random so you really gamble with heroes that you cant power up OUTSIDE of spending money right now.

So spend it on more reliable characters and shards for heroes you like in the store and be patient!

Refreshes are the best thing to spend your yellow essence i would say, so go ahead and buy the big pack. 

* DC related = popularity

* Proven deals with films for film version characters

* A lot of stuff is locked behind money (good and bad thing)

* Model is 95% the same as SWGOH which is top 20 on the itunes store in grossing

The game's success is COMPLETELY dictated by how much money and well promoted it is until next year.

13,"The model is the same as SWGOH.

In fact, I would confidently say it was a clone and a ripoff considering one is by EA and the other is by WB and I'm curious if they will sew. 

That being said, I think the success lies within the characters released, and the deals made with movies and shows (Like Suicide Squad, BMVSSM, Young Justice, the new Justice League 52). 

For example SWGOH was projected to actually come close to failing a few months after release, but with Star Wars: The Force Awakens their industry boomed by released a few simple characters from the film: Kylo Ren, Rey, Finn, etc. 

The game now has people who spend tens of thousands of games on it. 

I think the early stages of this game will tell if it will be cancelled or not, and I would wait also, but I think it will actually work out even if it isn't the biggest success. ",2016-11-21 01:54:22+00:00,da8y3k8,2.0,t1_da8x62d,1385.0,DCComicsLegendsGame

18,"I'm going to have to disagree with some of your points. 

Parry talents are the weakest talent by far right now. They aren't ONLY viable for the tank build as they will absorb just as much damage if you are squishy or not, it blocks the same auto attacks. 

It compliments tank varian MORE because damage talents scale LESS with tank Varian. 

Also I think you are very ill informed on Varian's abilities. I don't know why you think Parry only lasts .75 seconds and increases to 0.9 with Live by the Sword...

Parry by default lasts 1.25 seconds and is increased to 1.5 seconds when talented.

Not exactly sure where you are getting your data from... So this ""simple change"" already exists. Have you played Varian? If you are suggesting a change outside of paper and the LIVE 1.25 isn't enough, you are actually proposing something higher than that making your argument invalid..

26,"I agree. It was a good concept attempting to round out what a Warcraft warrior can do depending. Varian being the King of Stormwind and memory loss and split personality warrior all coming into one just goes to show how truly thematic the king warrior is. 

It's weird there is only 1 talent for. And the Quest Talent isn't even that amazing. I just feel like the level 4 talents are so powerful that even though there is space for a q, i would hard to make it compete. Maybe even make it so Lion's Maw deals bonus damage to shields with the Shield Breaker talent in addition to auto attacks. 

The small iteration i had above made Warbringer reduce the cooldown by 50% (8 seconds) instead of 10, so we are definitely on the same page there.

28,"Haha yeah. 

So for Colossus Smash you are vulnerable too when you all in, so you need to be smart or hope your front line is with you. You still get the big damage. 

By removing the 10% health reduction, it helps other health % talents but more importantly helps a Varian who gets caught out and has no way to run away. It's a tradeoff, but overall, he is squishier.

25% vuln is technically 25% health lost if you were bursted down in the duration. 

2nd wind should be nerfed overall, which I wrote. I really want to compliment the tank build, i think a 3rd charge of parry with shield wall and the heal option at 7 to absorb auto attacks which synergizes further with taunt is what will make Varian a great tank option. 

I think a thorns option would be very cool. In this case, by moving overpower to taunt (forcing auto attacks, healing from parry) you'd get a refresh on heroic strike, and with 3 charges of live by the sword you get some really good damage.

I would LOVE a thorn option, I'm curious as to why blizz hasn't implemented that too much yet. You would think anubarak would have it...",2016-11-19 23:32:48+00:00,da7j1vy,2.0,t1_da7i6fv,1383.0,heroesofthestorm
29,"&gt; I too think that the synergy between the two talents (Second Wind and Twin Blades) is too exclusive. They work insanely well together, but if you aren't going to take both, you should probably take neither.

Yeah, I feel that after doing the math, they ATTEMPTED to balance it by making it scale by attack damage, speed, AND health which each build specifies in, but it didn't work out that way :/ I hope by reducing 2nd wind's healing overall, you cant afk heal, it would bring back the combo pick up to 50%, and the other heal options could work for other builds but 2nd wind wouldn't be HORRIBLE. 

&gt; Smash doubles attack damage. What if it also doubled the effectiveness of on-hit effects? It's kind of a lazy hack, but it would at least address the weak synergy between Smash and SW.

Smash is bad when healthy (above 50% health) with second wind, but does wonders when below 50% health (kind of like Artanis). thought it's actually +75% attack damage, doubling on-hit effects means it gets the benefits for TBOF minus the damage, but the +75% outclasses the -25% (but again twice the attack speed). This would make it so TBOF should only be picked for the movement speed boost and a reduction to heroic strike's cooldown. The REAL dangerous implications of doing that is that leeching plasma and cloud serpent would be stupidly strong. 


&gt; Maybe Taunt shouldn't reduce attack speed as much. This is the main tank role, and other main tanks are allowed to have decent damage. Perhaps Tank Varian doesn't need the attack speed penalty.
I dunno, my solutions are pretty short sighted. It does bother me how SW and Twin Blades are just so all or nothing. Both or neither. I think there's probably a good way to make SW compelling and useful in cases where you aren't committed to taking Twin Blades.

Others are saying the same. It's so clunky to move from a standard smooth 1.25 attack speed and have the chopped by a quarter. If the damage is too high if they removed it, give him an attack damage penalty instead of attack speed, and my overpower passive onto taunt would work fine with it. He'd still do good damage as a tank like others, and not be clunky hindered by an attack speed 

  I think people still take 2nd wind over victory rush with colossus smash.

&gt; Why does the player have no control over the weapon the Riven mod is for? You would think the mod would be for whatever weapon you use to unveil it.

Every single mod in the game bar the ones you buy with syndicate standing is random. The player doesn't have control over what mods work with what. Why doesn't firestorm work with my silva and aegis wtf?!?! It's called RNG and drops in any game would be ruined  if everything was filtered down to being bought with. We don't know what it's like to play a game without RNG but I can tell you now it's part of the thrill, the hunt, and the happy grind. 

&gt; Why are there Riven mods for brand new strong weapons (such as the Synoid Simulor) when DE originally promised to introduce a system to make old weapons as viable as the newer ones? Now the newer ones are stronger than ever, and the gap has become an uncrossable chasm.

DE never said that this was the system to make old weapons viable. Why are you assuming this? This system creates mods that really pack a punch, yes. They never stated this was intended to make old weapons viable. In addition to this they could easily tune each mod so a certain weapon that is weaker, has higher potential with a riven mod (say karak which isn't top tier can reach +300% slash damage where a soma can only reach 200%). 

Why is there a limit of only 15 riven mods per account? Thats pretty much FORCING everyone to risk getting banned by making alt accounts to hold excess mods. There should be no limit to how many you can own.

If you are going to make an alternate account and invest the time to go through every single one of the quests required while having strong enough parts to unlock the sedna node all the while risk getting caught just to hold 15 riven mods with a daily trade limit. Be my fucking guest lmao. 


&gt; Why does the kuva reroll cost increase exponentially? It should just be a set price.

It's to increase the risk. Stop asking stupid questions

&gt; Why do the mods become reveiled after a reroll? Nobody likes doing these insane tasks.

Get good. We've been complaining for YEARS that this game was far too fucking easy. Now we have something that not only takes skill but makes us think and be careful in certain missions. You people just can't be please can you?

&gt; Why can people trade reveiled crap mods, or even unveiled mods that have been rerolled so many times that its impossible for the new owner to do so now due to exponential kuva cost? There is no warning or indication of how many rerolls the mod had - such as a counter similar to formaed weapons.

The system came out late friday and it's monday afternoon. Chill. 

&gt; Why are these mods tradeable at all? These mods should be account locked to prevent exploiting with multiple accounts, and tilting warframe toward the slippery slope of P2W RNG upgrades obtainable 99% through plat trades only.

There's no such thing as P2W in this game because it's PVE. Who are you competing with?! You can't use these in PVE. Platinum trades already let people P2W in this game because they can buy fully primed mods and dont have to grind for anything. What's new bro?

&gt; Why are there such gamebreakingly overpowered stats on some, such as this mod - credit to /u/Apopho , and yet others are so underpowered, downright useless (crit damage on non crit weapons, zoom, etc) , or even negative (such as -120% damage)?? This is complete BULLSHIT and favors those lucky few lottery winners or plat P2W buyers, while punishing the majority of normal players. At this point I think we would rather have standardized stats for each weapon-unique Riven mod, as thats the only fair and balanced design.

It's for true end-game. It's not bullshit you need to grow up and realize that this game is still better than destiny's grind and i sincerely doubt you're willing to get outside of your comfort zone and stop being lazy and work for a super corrupted mod.

&gt; How can DE do anything to fix these mods now that heavy plat deals have been made? If they were account locked to begin with, DE couldve easily tweaked them or offered legendary cores. Now I fear its way too late. DE has broken warframe PVE and trading so badly with these mods. When harder content arrives they will be a necessity that many players simply wont have, and will suffer because of it.

DE can do what they want. It's not the first time they have buffed or nerfed something. Vengeful Revenant used to cost hundreds of plat but they multiplied it's drop chance by about 133 times. Did that crash the market?! no...",2016-11-14 20:55:24+00:00,da0b44l,1.0,t3_5csob3,78749.0,Warframe

159,"**TL;DR**

* Need more than one Lion Maw Talent

* Need another Level 4 talent

* Colossus Smash should not have a health penalty (making him squishier than twin blades) and should reduce heroic strike cd to 9 seconds otherwise it will only be up every 10 auto attacks which is depressing.

* Attack animation is too good. Cancelling it seems TOO rewarding. I know that sounds dumb, but it makes me uneasy. 

* Glory to the Alliance should increase shields too

-------------------------------------------------

Hi there, from a GM point of view I have some concerns.

* **Lion's Maw** only has one talent at Level 1... where are its other talents? It's a simple, straightforward Q ability and the talent quest is boring it just increases the effectiveness overall. 

* **He needs another Tier 4 Talent**. My suggestion: Simba's Jaw - Using Lion's Maw increases Varian's next auto attack by 150% minus 25% for each enemy unit hit beyond the first. This would synergize with Colossus Smash, but not well with the others. Still it enhances his dueling and skirmish potential. **Other Suggestion:** Lo'Gash Tactics: Varian's first auto attack against a slowed, stunned, rooted target deals +100% bonus damage. 

* **Colossus Smash** should have the health reduction removed. Second Wind seems to only be viable with Twin Blades of Fury since it's per hit, aka twin blades getting double the amount of healing in. Colossus Smash Heroic should be the line between Tank and Assassin, it should be the Warrior pick. I really like the active component of Colossus Smash but having LESS health than Twin Blades of Fury just doesn't make sense to me. Colossus Smash should also reduce the cooldown of Heroic Strike to 9 seconds. With an 18 second cooldown Heroic Strike's uptime is every 10 auto attacks when in battle as opposed to every other second with Twin Blades. This change would make it every 6th auto attack which seems fair considering what giant killer does. 

* **His attack animation is *TOO* good**. The wide swing of the sword deals the damage in the first third, if not quarter of the animation, meaning stutter stepping with him is SOO powerful. In my opinion, hard to do, BUT, too powerful. I don't think making the damage occur later would be a horrible nerf.

* **Glory to the Alliance** should also increase the effectiveness of Shields. I would like Shielding supports to be more of a thing. Sure health is solid and doesn't wear off, but Tassadar and Storm Shield are very important in this game. This talent favors healers a little too much but would be really comforting for a support to help out if they specialized in more shields than just healing. I am secretly Artanis bias.

* Expert missions are super bugged, giant ape ki blasts falling outside the map, can't be shot at from a proper angle with a ki attack, can't lock onto allies that need to be freed fast enough even with a mouse scroll (which is inconsistent)

* I don't know if it's intended, but Ultimates like Super Kamehameha, and Final Flash, even if they land, the entire damage doesn't go through because the person hit gets free invincibility frames and ""falls"" out of the rest of the beam, meaning tons of damage is wasted...

2. Grubby, chu8, heck even rich in an interview had stated they WANT Artanis to be more viable, but he isn't. He lacks an escape, so basically you have to fight or die, and have no way to disengage for yourself, you NEED a falstad knockback or medivh portal. 

other characters who don't have an innate escape like say, Johanna, have plenty of other means to survive and run away and hinder the opponent's assault.

Artanis HAS to keep fighting to stay alive. 

The saddest part is, I'm an Artanis main in the master level and am no means the best player here on this subreddit, but everyone seems to think the Blade Dash + Prism Sphere change will fix him and it WON'T. It's just going to be another ""niche"" change that will make him be ignored and see no changes for an entire other year. 

The best thing to do for him is make Blade Dash's cooldown 22 seconds (from 10) and make it so you can dash just half way, but if you choose to dash back to refund half the cooldown.

A 22 second gap closer isn't op because of it's massive down time (2 times per suppression pulse) when there are plenty other warriors with a mobility move on HALF the cooldown. ",2016-10-31 20:30:19+00:00,d9fvgcf,1.0,t3_5abacv,40690.0,heroesofthestorm

304,"I don't think we need a LOT more Warriors, just buffs to ones not used as much.

For example, **Diablo** might have one of the highest healths in the game, but has only 1 damage resistance talent in his kit. He has good single target initiation, but what is Shadow Charge compared to aoe Powerslide? Fire Stomp being very unreliable, and Diablo having no escape since Shadow Charge is targetted. 

**Artanis**, also lacks an escape. People think the upcoming test for Prism Sphere+Blade Dash is going to be so cool, but in reality, it fixes nothing about his kit's weaknesses that just prevents them from being viable in the high tiers. Which is, the lack of escape, weak initiation, and having to continually auto attack the closest things (which makes him very vulnerable to ANY crowd control) no means to overcome that crowd control, i can go on. Artanis I love, and many people may disagree, but the best thing to do is double his Q cooldown, + 2 seconds on top of that, and make it so you can cancel half way. If you choose to NOT cancel and go back, half the cooldown is refunded. 

This will keep him the same, but slightly weaker with 1 more second on Blade Dash, but if he chooses, he will have a high mobility dash on a massive 22 second cooldown. (two dashes per supression pulse). 

**Arthas** is probably the most immobile warrior in the game, though, thematic, it is somewhat compensated for the amount of crowd control he can bring to a fight. Usually you need extra cc to close that gap even more, which means usually a second warrior, which means they need to opt for heavier damage talents to compensate for the 2W-2A-1S team comp.

* Movement speed in this game is not healthy right now just imo. I don't really understand how all heroes could have the same baseline speed and be balanced based on kits. It sucks that a valla can technically infinitely kite a diablo until his charge is up and that bothers me which is why I'm scared of movement speed auras because it's a severe advantage where you will always catch up, or will always be able to disengage AND get to objectives faster. I think movement needs to be different based on the hero played in general but i digress

* I think Lucio would be a great candidate for something that Taliyah has from LoL. What it is is, after running alongside a wall you will get a movement speed buff. Lucio in this case would ""parkour run"" it and maybe get a damage resistance buff and movement speed buff while running along walls

337,"* Regen Globe/marksman quests need to be worked on for sure as the average game length is around 20 minutes. I suggest to passively gain 1 stack per minute on top of whatever you collect. That and make it so even if regen globes are collected, they will linger for say, 10 seconds so you can pick them up for your quest (even if it doesn't heal you). 

* All Block talents imo are severely overrated and underpowered. The number of auto attacks that happen in a fight and your talent was wasted on two of them from their Brightwing. I agree on the duration change, but it should also have a toggle like Spellshield. This way you can use it timely against things like Thrall's Windfury, Frostmourne, Butcher's Brand, Twin Blades, Samuro's crit etc. It will add a skill cap to it that is rewarding. 

* I really like the quest + range on punish for chasing, but doesn't her W bring them in anyways and you almost always follow up with Q? I know Blizzard doesn't want Joh to do damage and that she should be peeling for her back line while blinding the enemy raynor/lunara/tychus etc. I just wish Q did % health damage to be a threat to tanks but no more of a threat already to squishies.

338,"Three most important things to me to play Illidan **in order from least important to most important.**

1. Don't play him unless you are at least Platinum so you actually **have a basic understanding of the game.** I hate to say it but playing Illidan means you need to absolutely understand what the enemy can do and what you can do against them. You need to know every ability in the game, and their cooldowns, and how you can dodge them. A lot of skill shots fire forward and Dive puts you behind the enemy, but the time it takes to get behind them means you are vulnerable from the front, Metamorphosis can be used to dodge most any ability in the game. Pyroblast about to hit you? time it to dodge it, Chromie used Temporal Loop? time it right before you shift back to avoid damage (you will still be moved fyi), fighting alarak and he activates Counter Strike? well I hope you dove behind him or sweeped to the side but if not use metam. You 

2. **Know your limits**. Sweeping Strike does the most damage and empowers your autos, but it is also of free movement so you might want to dive in and sweeping strike out. Your extreme mobility means you can dive in, then get out and bait enemy abilities and cooldowns on you because they think you are committing. Time your evasion to dodge important auto attack moments like Artanis's Twin Blades, Thrall's Windfury, Butcher's Brand, Arthas's Frostmourne attack, and Tyrael's autos. JK Tyrael's autos suck it's a wetnoodle. 

3. **Practice your stutter stepping.** He has a really really fast attack speed, but using animation cancelling on your auto attacks is absolutely vital to maximize mobility, dps, and your passive for shorter cooldowns. I can't stress enough how much this separates a good Illidan with mechanics and a bad Illidan. Auto attacks heal you, reduce the cooldown of ALL your abilities, and stutter stepping means you can walk with your opponent and eliminate excess waste of animations and standing still. You can shuffle around merc camps and prevent them from getting off attacks and actually take them down in record time.",2016-10-25 12:00:41+00:00,d96wgtp,1.0,t3_594z2h,75340.0,heroesofthestorm
339,"* **Resurrect** Reduce cooldown to 60 seconds from 90, reduce channel time from 3 seconds to 1.5 seconds, increase heal to 75%. 

* **Adaptation** Rework completely. Make it last say 10 seconds, % damage reduction upon taking that type of attack (autos and ability) stacking 5% per hit up to a cap. 

* **Mark for the Kill** Marked target has 50% reduced healing and shields applied to them. 

* **Water Elemental** Reduce cooldown to 60 seconds, increase the size by a good amount and make the water elemental like a temporary misha that can tank and body block. Command it like normal, but it will fire its own independent separate auto attack at anything you auto attack. 

* **Ultralisk** Rework ability to Zerg Swarm. Similar to Unleash the Boars on Rexxar, but a zerg swarm of banelings mutalisks an ultralisk and other stuff. For chasing, and damage, also siege burst option.

* **Water Dragon** Water Dragon slows attack speed by half as much as well, bigger splash area. Level 20 Dragon will bounce to enemies not hit yet primarily. 

* **Medivac** Let it brings minions, mercs, bosses and have them re-aggro depending on location. 

* **Haymaker** If you think about it, this is a harder to aim sunder (when lining it up) but you can target a sole person and launch them back into your team. I'd say just slow the primary target after they stop flying back. It's not that Haymaker is bad, it's just that Avatar is really good. Other thing to add is to make it like lee sins kick from LoL, enemies hit by the launched hero take % health damage (so it is good against tanks indirectly)

* **Raynor's Raiders** Have them have aoe reveal. Revealing brush targets, invisible targets, make it so they can only be attacked by ranged auto attacks and no abilities. 3 charges. 1 charge = 1 ship. 30 seconds per ship. 

* **Bloodlust** if you compare this to lt. Morales's stim pack... it's not that bad at all. 75% AS 25% MS vs 40% AS 30% MS --- So 5% more ms, but 35% less as, BUT Bloodlust is AoE... it's not that bad at all. I'd say reduce bloodlust attack speed by a bit, maybe make it 25% attack speed 25% movement speed, but add a heal on hit so it's thematic to ""bloodlust"".

* **Earthquake** Many things you can do here. You could make it do a tiny bit of damage so the pulses heal Thrall, you could make it so it prevents dashes completely, or you could rework the ability to a Fire element attack since Thrall doesn't use fire in this game for some reason. Random idea: **Spirit Fire** Whenever Thrall uses an ability, he will unleash a cone of fire in front of him dealing damage over 3 seconds. Each hit of Windfury will also unleash a cone. This fire reduces healing on the enemies by 50% for the duration. ",2016-10-25 11:51:10+00:00,d96w8c2,1.0,t3_59a7b2,7145.0,heroesofthestorm

2. The map. Abathur excels in some ways because he can sit safely behind a gate, still soak experience, and just use some mini zerglings and a symbiote hat to keep the lane alive. That's not really viable in some maps like two lane maps stacked against you, or if someone can get over the wall and kill you and get out.

* Dealing damage to non-players (like like Torbjorn's turrets or Symmetra's teleporter), no longer charges ultimate abilities

Now, there is a much smaller incentive to constantly snipe that turret from far away for a safer engage for your allies. You are essentially almost wasting your time shooting it now as it has minimal down time. You'll be better off trying to shoot an actual enemy. Torb's hammer just got a speed buff so there is even LESS down time. No point in shooting them turrets. It's a waste of time. 

* Pulse Rifle -Bullet damage increased from 17 to 20, Maximum bullet spread Increased from 2.2 to 2.4

Okay. We all know Soldier 76 needed a buff. But the bullet spread is stupid, why? McCree will still out damage a Soldier 76. The spread just increases that gap. Did you know if there was no spread at all, McCree could still out dps S76 with bullets in burst?

Riot has multiple teams working on different skins at the same time and when push comes to shove some thing's have their time table moved.

The World breaker skins are still far off, so yes they have 9 REVEALED and are soon ready to test, but probably have dozens if not hundreds in development. 

Heroes of the Storm works the same way, but what you forget is that they throw ""chromas"" in too, and the heroes of the storm models are much more in-depth and harder to make skins for when it comes to animation. They have many more effects than LoL characters do, a lot of models are similar but the combat animations and rag dolling are what separate the two.

The only pokemon that has seen any real meta play that is lower than marowak is Azumarill, who is actually an exception since its ability doubles its attack stat therefore technically having a higher total than marowak. 

Other pokemon nearby include emolga who fits a very particular move set exploit, and sneasel who has less defense but boasts a nearby triple the speed and a higher attack stat with dangerous stab.

449,"I think Bloodlust is heavily underrated.

Why?

Well for context, Lieutenant Morales Stim Drone:

Grant **a single** allied Hero 75% Attack Speed and 25% Movement Speed for 10 seconds.

Rehgar's Bloodlust:

Grant **nearby allied Heroes** 40% Attack Speed and 30% Movement Speed. Lasts for 10 seconds.

So it's 5% more movement speed, and a good 35% less attack speed, but it's for the WHOLE party. 

Like others have suggested, it pretty much tells your own team to ""let's just disengage so they wasted that cooldown"". 

In an all out brawl with auto attackers, Bloodlust is amazing, but in organized play giving your tank (or anyone for that matter) a second life can really turn the tide.",2016-10-16 23:40:05+00:00,d8uzrrv,1.0,t3_57tlwh,9284.0,heroesofthestorm

454,"Level 1

* Immolation is ""standard"" it's like an early temporary burning rage that is permanent in combat if you can get autos out like you should be. 

* Battered Assault relies too much on hitting two enemies, if changed to one enemy it would be extremely powerful

* Seasoned marksmen is picked on pros and certain maps over immolation pretty much all the time in korea where illidan isn't countered to where he cant stay in a fight too long

-----------------

Level 4

* Rapid Chase is actually higher in DPS as if you stutter step properly on Illidan you can get out a lot more autos. For context, mounts are 20% movement speed bonus, rapid chase is 15% movement speed bonus. 

* Friend or Foe is standard, the range increase means initiating from mount is almost guarenteed if safe, and obviously you can jump back and forth between enemy and ally. the downside is it relies on allied positioning which you can't control in unorganized play. 

* I like Unbound on large maps where i'm not always with allies and i'm trying to sneak a lone warhead or objective or splitpushing sylvannas. Very good on tomb of the spider queen. You don't need to rely on having an enemy or ally to jump to with dive, you can spam sweeping strike to get away. It's actually a better escape when alone or near walls than the reliance of friend or foe. 

-----------------------------------------------------

Level 7

* Only one here not really viable is Hunter's Onslaught health on using abilities. Though technically you could heal more since you cant get a lot of autos in than you would with thirsting blade, if you have an abathur or morales boost or are soloing bosses, thirsting blade is the way to go. 

* Reflexive Block is the one that is picked because of the power of auto attacks. If they have only one auto attacker and you already have evasion which should be good enough, you actually don't need to pick this. 

-----------------------------------------------------------

Level 13

* Like you said this one is flexible. Resistance covers EVERYTHING even if it's only 25% damage reduction which is still very good. 

* If the enemy happened to have almost or no auto attacks, you would ditch the earlier reflexive block and ditch elusive strike and Sixth Sense is much better than Nimble Defender. The enemy can pop this with weaker spells however like Malfurion's moon starcall thingy majigger. 

* If the enemy happened to have almost or no casters, the cooldown reduction from elusive strike makes you super tanky and untouchable against auto attackers. **I don't know/think immolation counts as damaging an enemy for elusive strike**. Also keep in mind most people dive in with sweeping strike before turning evasion on. It makes this talent much weaker as you need to auto attack to get sweeping strike back up to damage, to use evasion again, which isn't a problem because of illidan's trait but it's hard to maximize correctly and you would do Dive-Evasion-Sweeping Strike instead of Dive-Sweeping Strike-Evasion

----------------------------------------------

Level 16

* Marked for Death is VERY good. HOWEVER. Since tanks are in most team compositions even with double warriors like Chen and E.T.C, AND you need to acknowledge the fact that friend and foe does NOT synergize with marked for death, Fiery Brand is actually the go to pick especially if you are seasoned and can land those auto attacks in a more auto attack build (enemy has less blinds/cc).

* Blades of Azzinoth sounds nice, and is actually really strong. It's hard to activate cause you have to ""poke"" with Sweeping Strike to get stacks, and then commit to an all in to make use of it. Poking with a melee illidan at level 16 is.. well. Almost suicidal. I think this talent needs to be changed for tradeoffs and i wouldn't recommend to anyone in any situation. **However technically it's really easy to use off of upcoming Samuro**

510,"Hey there! Thanks for the comment :)

&gt; This introduces denial as a mechanic, something LoL learned a while ago is a shitty gameplay feature and had to remove it. Your effectively removing XP and globes from play with no possible counter from the enemy team.

Mal'Ganis sacrifices his only wave clear ability, that is on a long 25 second cooldown. (Heck, Alarak's Counterstrike is on a 30 second cooldown). Which is about once per wave. Yes, you can deny a SINGLE minion in your wave, and make the regen globe drop for contention, but you also give up your wave clear on an entire wave. While denial mechanics can be scary, I think a 25s cooldown is enough to cap its power no?

&gt; That R1 looks kinda broke. Its like an Uber Mind Control, and if he's more of a melee hero, the super long range doesn't make a ton of sense with the rest of his kit.

Definitely, I can't disagree here. This is the part of the kit that I'm most torn on due to its power, however ""manipulation"" and turning your foes against each other is a very hard thing to do in this game. To remove the theme completely, sure. But I feel that it is almost ""too"" iconic to that of a Dreadlord, especially Mal'Ganis. Not sure what tuning could be done, Syl's mind control is 2.5 seconds of movement of your choosing effectively walk/channeling someone to their death. Mal'Ganis would also channel rendering him useless for the duration, though it doesn't walk into your team it could be worse, by having the unit be hostile to their own team. I think I was far too spoiling in the cooldown and it should be tuned to something like, 100s cooldown with a 3 second duration. 

Anyways, I'm hitting a slump because again the dark manipulation is so thematic to the character, I don't know how it could be implemented without it being op. 

&gt; Sleep being another untapped mechanic that could be fun, though I see it being a lot more dangerous in the early game landing phase as opposed to slugfest team fights. That CD is hella short for its utility though.

I agree I probably spoiled him with a low cooldown on this ability. I'm hoping that the stasis makes it so your team doesn't wake him up too early, but if caught in AOE and such would wake them up. I think it's great for setups and it's a nice skillshot to land. It's weaker than a stun since you can't really damage the enemy for the full duration, but is still dangerous nontheless.

520,"Hi there,

I've played video games my whole life and was born into toxicity from League of Legends.

Even though HotS isn't as bad, it's still there. 

I want you to know that first of all, it's not your fault. It happens to all of us and we want to be competitive. We are being FORCED to not only cooperate, but completely rely on 4 strangers to win a game.

Not only that, HotS is so intensely team based, you need every member of your team to do an optimal job. It is rare when one person can just ""carry"". 

My first suggestion?

Take a break from the game. Just for a few days. I know i know it's hard, but if you can binge watch one of the million tv shows that have come back, the marvel netflix series, or just find another game (preferably one you are new to) I think it will help.

I find that Duelyst and Hearthstone really clear my mind. I don't care about the competitive ladder there, it helps me think but also take a break from hots. 

My second suggestion:

Do some QM with heroes you like NEVER play. Maybe 5 or so games. Help freshen up your mind or mechanics

Last: 

Admit you aren't always right. And admit to yourself you are trying to carry animals that even noah couldn't save. Yelling and raging, doesn't help, everyone is too stubborn. By yelling and raging, you actually are promoting and pushing them to not listen to you EVEN MORE. To make fun of you back, and intentionally throw. You raging actually in no scenario helps you win.

EVEN IF YOU ARE RIGHT!!!

Crazy I know. The best thing to do is be confident, and encourage the team to go do what you think is right.

If you die and make a mistake, just say sorry! Even if they call you noob. ",2016-10-06 23:34:35+00:00,d8h5zak,1.0,t3_566ad5,25052.0,heroesofthestorm

526,"I don't think this is very well thought.

While I agree making talents baseline or combining them then nerfing the ability altogether works sometimes, you are missing some things. 

+50% damage is the highest most any ability gets. Yes Johanna doesn't do a lot of damage but this does add a ton of damage to her if you think you need it. It doesn't have a high winrate because people are probably using it wrong. 

NO Burning Rage talent is at 7. They are all at 13 because of the massive impact they have in battle bar illidan. That's just dumb!

Johanna is in an AMAZING spot. She is at the top of every tier list and has a great winrate even if some have fallen below 50% it's not like they are doing horrible.

**There are literally at least 100+ talents that have a lower winrate then theones you are talking about**

Jo's hitbox being small is both thematic, but also made up for for being the tankiest character in the game hands down. 

If Johanna is ignored, she isn't playing the role properly.

I think you are wanting Johanna to do damage to fufill your fantasy of a damage dealing crusader from Diablo and trust me I feel the same way about Tyrael lacking damage but Johanna is amazing at tanking and disruption and I disagree with your post.

536,"This is great insight on the complicated mechanics of ""projectiles"" in Heroes of the Storm.

I guess in our fantasy, it would work. I'd like to think if League of Legends can do it, so can we. 

For starters, It isn't accurately stated, but Reinhardt would NOT be able to turn with his shield on. It would face one direction and would have to be re-toggled to rotate. It doesn't fulfill the perfect fantasy of Reinhardt being translated over from Overwatch but it provides real counterplay to a ""heavy shield"". 

Funnily enough, in Overwatch Reinhardt players can move their mouse all over the [screen crazily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkC4Li1bsTk)

However I don't think this would be good for Heroes. 

If worst comes to worst and it just can't happen where a Reinhardt shield exists to block damage, another solution if executed properly is to use a system that pinpoints the enemy attacker, and the target's ""hit"" and redirect the damage to the shield. 

Raynor = A, --&gt; = Raynor auto attack, Shield = | , Reinhardt = B, Nazeebo =C

A --&gt; |B  C

Any damage A does to B or C, is reduced/blocked and portions of it are dealt to the shield.

Aside from such, I agree with your HoT idea. He seems to be a night elf that revolves around nurturing his team and using nature against his foes, over burst heal which other characters can fill.

My suggested changes:

* Make Regrowth have a smaller initial heal, but have his heal work similar to Misha's Mend. A large over time. For more uniqueness, healing a low hp ally but keeping them alive will be rewarded and semi bait the enemy. To do this, make his heal ramp up over time but start off small. 

* More Treants. From WC3 I personally feel like this was his main move. He used it all the time in the cutscenes and in game and I'm upset there aren't more. In fact I expected him to have a move similar to Nazeebo's that is treants instead. 

* Allow him to cast Innervate on himself

* Increase cost of Moonfire, and add a delay, but buff the damage and utility gained in return. (increases skill cap but rewards players more) By increasing the cost people may have to invest in more mana talents but he can now innervate himself.

* Tranquility is too much like Juggle of 1,000 cups. The latter will help the weakest, while Malf's is simply AoE but I would like to see something like: All allies have 30% increased healing. This means synergy of characters that can heal and heal themselves (like a tyrande on a team that already has a malf) or say two semi suppots on a team, can help each other out.

Animation cancelling is a very important part of video games. You name it, whether it's Overwatch, a MOBA, or Starcraft, it exists.

I think a prime example of this is stutterstepping. This is where your auto attack has an animation where you start swinging your sword, when in the animation your attack does damage (sword hits opponent) and then the follow through swing afterwards (sword keeps slashing air after cutting opponent). 

HOWEVER. In video games, if you cancel that follow through by moving your character, you can save precious time and get another auto attack in. 

Say the frame for an attack is 1 second. The slashing through air BEFORE hitting someone takes .4 seconds, then the damage happens, you then waste an entire .6 seconds of ""follow through swinging through the air"" that you could have cancelled to move your character instead.

----------------------------

Blinking is similar. You can't cast all of Kael'thas's abilities at the same time because they all have an animation, you have to do one after the other. If you are seasoned however, there are many abilities that have an animation you DON'T have to complete and can finish early by moving and still getting the spell off. 

I think with a character like Li-ming, these animations are very short and/or easy to cancel so you can fire off everything right after each other in a short time.

Now **Bolt of the Storm** does NOT have an animation. It simply relocates your character in an instant. Hence the name, and the intent. So what happens is the Blink relocates your character mid animation, so Sunder is still playing while your blink. 

This is why pro players opt for Bolt of the Storm and is not popular among pubs and solo queue. It's power is determined by the player to use flashy plays that are so quick the opponent may not have time to react. ",2016-09-29 03:13:58+00:00,d86gh92,4.0,t1_d86e43y,3588.0,heroesofthestorm

HotS is a different game than an FPS. Otherwise we should see Diablo one-shotting people and the Spear of Adun melting everything on the map, but it's tuned to our game fantasy of balance.

I think it should really come down to the individual character. I think Zarya should be able to AA and move, even if at half speed, and in the perfect world I think Tychus should be able to too. 

I would definitely go against saying ""Zarya has zero reason to be able to move while shooting her AA"" that's kind of stupid. Why can Valla use Strafe and move? hardly seems fair by your logic. 

I think when it comes down to it, a character's design is a character's design. If they want Zarya to move while shooting to body block, maneuver, or realign her laser, that seems perfectly fine to me. ",2016-09-29 00:12:31+00:00,d869gkj,1.0,t3_54ywsl,7982.0,heroesofthestorm

Though not the same game, you can do the same thing in LoL.

What it is is, the Sunder animation is still going off (before the Sunder actually is created doing damage and stunning). During that animation, you are re positioning your character with Bolt of the Storm.

Sunder then casts from your new location. Which makes sense if you did it mid-animation.

Another example, let's say you as a person, have a sword, and are going to cut someone down. Let's say that person is 20 feet in front of you, you can begin to slash your sword downward, and ""while slashing"" you teleport to them, the sword will cut them but you technically started the slash before moving.

They NEED to nerf his ultimate cooldown. I know I know, we all love making saves bot lane but it hurts his laning phase so much. 

I would definitely trade dueling power in exchange for a longer Ult cd.

Shen has historically always gone absolute full tank. Maybe 1 in every 1,000 games there is someone who build titanic hydra or triforce on him.

My suggestion for Shen:

* Increase Ult cooldown

* Change Q damage from Next 3 auto attacks --&gt; every auto attack over a duration (say 3 seconds)

* Make Spirit's Refuge's protective zone give 25% damage reduction from AoE Spells. This makes it like Jax's counter strike, except it will have no stun, and it will be in one area (you can't move it).

As strong of a disable as silence is, the W-Q combo is really only for poking if you are by yourself. You will never be able to full right kill someone with it.

If you are allied, the W-Q is like any other CC chain. 

But like I said, without the talents you can still do the combo and come out with the same damage. You won't get a kill without someone else's help so I personally neglect the extra silence. 

Finally, I think Kerrigan does everything Alarak does but better. Her combo hits harder, stuns (which is stronger than silence) and she has a point click gap closer damaging ability to finish off fleeing foes.

The biggest difference to me is Alarak has E poke sustain, and different heroics. The former of which isn't a big deal because you will likely have a healer and lining up shots just really isn't a thing you strategically do yet, while his heroics suffer from being cancelled by cc, or heck minion attacks.

Every other cancelled ability either gets it's cooldown refunded, or brought to a default 10 like Artanis's Purifier Beam. I think they should look over his heroics and tweak them a bit. It's too high of a risk for what you get out of it. 

5. I think Kerrigan is a great comparison. She does what he does, but gets a shield and an actual gap closer for it. They both of a pull into cc but Stun &gt; Silence even if it's harder to hit. I couldn't have said it better, Kerrigan does his job better even though they do have their own unique points. 

6. I would love it if Lightning Surge had half the benefit on the primary target and the full benefit on targets in between. Or full benefits on everyone IF a hero was also hit by the center. Like this: ""Reduces the damage bonus of Sadism by 10%, but Lightning Surge slows enemies hit between you and the victim by 70% for 1.5 seconds.""  you don't even slow the primary target. You only get a slow if you can hit someone far away and line up a shot...

All in all, you bring up some really good points, especially on Kerrigan. I just wonder what the best approach to making him more ""viable"" would be. ",2016-09-22 09:23:56+00:00,d7x8tps,2.0,t1_d7x8fcm,1543.0,heroesofthestorm

625,"Yeah

1. Wave clear isn't a problem. All of his skills are aoe and he has decent basic attacks. He just has no sustain without enemy heroes to poke and thus will die to a jungle camp which is...well sad.

2. Yeah :( most heroes you learn the hitboxes by playing with or against them. For it to be drawn on the battlefield for you is.. well the equivalent of me telling you i'm going to go for your head at this angle at this height. Just fyi lol

3. Last Laugh is my least used for sure, but is why I would like to see it changed. Say you keep building Sadism for having your allies die (or a new talent that grants it for maintaining a killing spree), last laugh could be really good. I'd like the option of that, over Hasty Bargain + Pure Malice. 

4. I'm fine with him being focused on hero killing. It makes it so he is picked to fill a specific role. For that to be ruined by lane minions but yet the minions dont trigger counter strike is... well a hole i think that needs to be filled :p

I agree on the same tier as pure malice. I don't think the other talents are a good pick. Some people argue Telekinesis damage is good but, Discord Strike does MORE than triple the damage of it already..",2016-09-22 08:29:06+00:00,d7x7y86,2.0,t1_d7x7r2k,727.0,heroesofthestorm

My biggest problem with Ultralisk is not that it was just a clone of another ability in the game, but making it a single target temporary misha without a stun is just underwhelming.

I think he is very viable, he just has a really high skill cap so people haven't figured him out yet.

Couple things:

* His Q and Counterstrike hitboxes are triangles, so the farther the enemy the harder it is to land

* Comboing telekinesis into discord strike requires really quick mechanics

* Advanced techniques with telekinesis, moving enemies in and out of skill shots, using it to push yourself, using it to push yourself AND enemies in the same push etc. 

* Counterstrike only works when attacked, but can't be cc'd, deadly charge only works when not attacked, but does less damage, but closes a massive gap

697,"Yasuo

EDIT:

**Passive 1:** Can only bring melee weapons to a mission but bypasses mission restrictions. Channeling damage is increased by 50% and channeling costs no energy (but Yasuo must have energy)

**Passive 2:** Any and all movement restore shields based on distance traveled. 

**Ability 1:** Steel Tempest - 25 energy - Does not interrupt movement (similar to iron jab but can move) - Yasuo lunges forward with a windblade, dealing massive puncture/slash damage  to all enemies struck in a close cone in front of him. The 3rd consecutive Steel Tempest within x amount of seconds will fire a tornado dealing Impact damage and knocking up all enemies in a long line in the air. This move benefits off of melee mods and has 100% status chance. 

Strength: Increases damage

Duration: Increases 3 consecutive hit combo time and duration of knock up

Range: Increases range of Steel Tempest, range of 3rd strike tornado, and circle Steel Tempest (see Sweeping Blade, 3rd ability). 


**Ability 2: Windwall** - 50 Energy - Yasuo slashes a wall of wind forward, blocking and destroying all projectiles. Melee attacks through the wall increase its duration and size.

Strength: Does nothing

Duration: Increases Duration

Range: Increases Size

**Ability 3: Sweeping Blade** - 25 Energy - Yasuo dashes towards your target reticule a set distance dealing Impact damage to all enemies struck. Yasuo cleanses himself of all debuffs and brings a Windwall with him. Casting Steel Tempest within 1 second after a Sweeping Blade will cause it to attack all enemies in a circle around Yasuo. 

Strength: Increases damage

Duration: Increases Steel Tempest circle attack synergy ""combo"" time

Range: Increases dash distance

**Ability 4: Last Breath** - 100 Energy - Yasuo gathers the wind and jumps into the air bringing in all enemies who have Physical Debuffs, Crowd Control, or in the air to his location within a certain distance. He will then slice through all enemies (similar to Ash Blade Storm) cutting them down with Finisher Damage. 

Strength: Increases damage

Duration: Increases time spent in air/Enemies sucked in

Range: Increases range of suck in radius

* **Rylais and Frozen Mallet** grants heavy ""perma"" cc slows to champions who technically shouldn't have that extra cc in their kit to begin with (Perma chase and kite Gnar who can still top against bruisers, non hard cc vladimir)

* **Shen** was in my opinion horribly designed. He is still a top laner who is only picked for his ultimate, builds full tank as a ninja but is given a non-scaling damage kit that only works against tanks aka top lane, absolutely 0 build diversity

* **Ekko** Meta since release whether it be AP, tank Ekko, or new triforce Ekko, this champion is stupidly broken in every patch of competitive play

* **ADCs** What happened to Graves, Kog'maw, Jinx, Twitch, Varus, Vayne, Kalista, Ezreal, Miss Fortune, Corki, Quinn, Draven? All i see these days are Jhin and Ashe, Sivir for 3rd pick/speed running comps, and then dl's pocket lucian. Literally no one else. 

* **Rek'sai** 9 consecutive nerfs and 0 buffs since release and she is still top tier and ""broken"". Hopefully recent nerfs will change that, but I hope she stays balanced and not under/overpowered. Though I guess we wish that for everyone

For me, the best thing to see this season was mid lane and supports. The mage rework did wonders, and though people say vlad and malz are broken op, they don't work without the right team as we saw in TSM's first game with Vlad. Regardless, we still see Viktor, Syndra came back, A-sol is a great wonder pick, and i think the nerfing of azir did this. I think Azir needs some complimentary buffs before worlds along with kassadin, ahri, maybe even zed, but it's so dangerous to make changes right now.

Whether losing lane or not, Vlad thrives in surviving, not having his healing reduced and being able to roll out sustained damage.

In addition to this, most of his ""team fight"" comes from damage amp on his ultimate since he offers 0 hard crowd control or pick potential. 

The team comp can't capitalize on the Vlad damage bonus. What, a tank Ekko Q gets damage amped? maybe his passive proc? Jhin gets an auto MAYBE 2 autos and a Q? the rest are tanks...

It just doesn't make sense.

To top it off Vlad can TRY and kit Shen and Rek'sai, but that task is hard enough, slap on Cass and Ashe chase potential? Vlad can't stay at a safe distance to sustain against C9's tanky front line.

775,"&gt; Disclaimer : not an extremely serious comment.

Thanks for the ""feedback"" :) I just want to point out that I probably wasn't nearly specific enough, but was trying to at least be more specific than what we currently have as augments :)

Penetrating Sequence - Opticor
+10 Punchthrough, +1 Sequence
&gt;""Whoops, I killed your friend 3 rooms behind you."" Approved.

Maybe 10 is much, my brainstorming of this one was when you fire it into a hallway of 20 people coming during an excavation on Triton, I thought it was funny that the giant kamehameha freedom gundam beam of charging death only killed the first person.

Armoured Sequence - Glaxion
Cold procs increase armor by 10% for 6 seconds, +1 Sequence
&gt; Be it 10% total armor, or 10% base armor, it's still really low. Even with Valkyr's insane 1530 armor fully modded (~83.6% reduction), you would gain at best 153 armor (total of ~84.9% reduction). Nothing noticeable. But as it's DE, it would scale from base armor, giving you a poor 60 armor (total of ~84,1% reduction).
Maybe make it stackable ?

Absolutely meant to be stackable! It will promote you using the Glaxion as a crowd control gun over a damage one, sit in the front line and tank and cc people like you are mr. freeze. 

Purity Guard - Destreza
+100% Counter Chance, +1 Purity
&gt; Idea is nice, but counterattacks only work on melee enemies. It's not useless, but only fits a really specific niche (a full melee alert like One Thousand Cuts maybe ?).

I think has many things that need to be addressed. Though this is less useful in the meta, I'm hoping this is something that will last a while. I honestly think we need melee 2.5, but i hope this is at least thematic.

Purity Barrage - Attica
+100% Multishot, +1 Purity
Twin Grattica.
&gt; Spew bullets bolts everywhere (except what you aim at).

They should rename it ""Atti___i mean zeus launcher"" Intended for the Thunderbolt mod

Burning Blight - Silva and Aegis
Attacks against burning targets always critically strike, +1 Blight
Too bad it has a 1.5x crit multiplier. With 2x it would be really nice.

Rapid Blight - Cerata
+100% Charge Attack speed, +1 Blight
&gt; ... Is there really anything that affects throwing melees and gunblades charge attack speed in game ? Because that would be nice.

if I'm not mistaken, there used to be something that directly affected charge attack speed

Fatal Justice - Miter
Headshots deal finisher damage, +1 Justice
&gt; Ow.



Powered Truth - Dakra Prime
+100% Channeling Efficiency +100% Channeling Damage, +1 Truth
&gt; You can't reach 100% channeling efficiency. It's hardcoded to cap at 80% (or 1 energy/hit). But I guess it's kinda nice.

It's meant to be +100% not... er 100%. Like maxed life strike is -140% so this would be -40% with a maxed life strike. 

Soaring Truth - Daikyu
Status Procs remove 70% armor, +1 Truth
&gt; Total or current armor ?

Same as Ash augment shurikens

Entropy Pulse - Staticor
Increased charge attack velocity, +1 Entropy
I've almost never seen people using the charge attack. Spamming seems more efficient.
Not sure that more velocity would compensate.

&gt; I think it'd be useful for mobs. 

Entropy Blow - Prova
+50% chance for status proc, +1 Entropy
Nice try, but it's still the Prova. You can't make it good.
Anyway, I really hope it's a flat 50% before mods. A flat 50% after mods is still good, but status mods would still be useless on the Prova (like the Supra augment).
A regular 50% from base chance would be plain trash... which somewhat fits the Prova.",2016-08-23 20:12:06+00:00,d6tpr5y,2.0,t1_d6t5ina,26433.0,Warframe

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**On Spellbinding** - The point of **cast times** is that you trade damage you would have done/standing still to take damage, in order to use an ability. It's a fair trade off and prevents spamming of abilities which... well let's face it. We do and we abuse. 

Although Spellbind has a very short range for an ability at max rank, it has an absurd duration compared to many crowd control abilities at 16 seconds. What this tells me is, that they want you to Mod Titania and have tradeoffs through all of her abilities. AKA, by modding you can favor some abilities over others, but she is the first frame in a long while, in my opinion where i plan on using ALL of her abilities.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**On Tribute** - An ability with actual gameplay. Just personally, most abilities in the game you use and an effect happens and it's simple. These are usually straight damage, or a straight buff, and are no brainers because you should have them up at all times. We need to keep in mind that Titania is a good attempt at a support caster frame which means you should be casting a lot more than you should be shooting, to support your team. 

Of course, we jump to maximizing all buffs and trying to get them all up at once ""easily"" but it isn't supposed to be easy, that's the whole point. These buffs are MASSIVE and some scale with mods.. to have all of them on once from a single ability is essentially god mode. BECAUSE they are all percentage based, they scale infinitely into the late game. People I think underestimate how powerful of an ability is. It has ramp up time, yes, but the rewards and buffs are exponential when they stack. 

bar the companion buff, 25% movement slow (mini nova/frost).. 25% damage REFLECT (sorry electric chroma), AND a dodge that stacks up to 50%? that's 50% EHP from any and all attacks which means it doubles your health and shields. Yes it takes time to stack, but if you want to take advantage of that you bring duration. I don't think she was designed to ""easily"" get all the buffs up, but instead decide depending on the available enemy pool, to bring a certain buff to the table. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**On Lantern** I love this ability but have to agree with you here. Enemies seem to have a priority when it comes to aggro. Which realistically, makes sense. I'm picking something shiny vs something I'm supposed to blow up otherwise i die or lose my job. I think it would be overpowered to work in a lot of defense missions though considering how strong that crowd control really is... we can already disable so many enemies in the game with a wide variety of crowd control, I'm happy to see something new. What's more is, this allows enemy grouping, which means if you want to pilfering swam/ivara pickpocket/atlast ore gaze/nekros desecrate/focus farm one big group, it's really really really useful for getting 
that burst of affinity or loot. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**On Razorwing** - I'll try and keep this one short because we can all agree she is really slow and I'm pretty sure DE will buff this. What I'd like to see is more ""elegance"". See, they took her 4 straight from archwing which means if you crash into something it's the end of the world. They need to add more fluffyness and less bouncyness and forgive our spastic flying natures. We are fairies! we should fly with grace. 

I'd like to see a big buff to her melee, as it stands there is no real reason to use it vs the guns, and it's hard to hit multiple foes to cleave with it anyways.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**On Her base stats** - I know you all complain about base stats and we've been spoiled with prime variants but guys... look. If you INCLUDE Primes, she has the same energy pool as half the warframes in the game (which is standard). Even though she is a caster frame, I think it promotes less spamming and more ""how am i going to mod Titania efficiently"". Same energy pool as other casters, Zephyr, Mag, Nekros, Mesa, Oberon, both frosts, hydroid. Comon guys, just use primed flow...

As for her tankiness. Fairies are meant to be squishy. They are essentially one step up from a butterfly. Do you know where her tankiness comes from? her abilities. Don't just judge by base stats. 4 (which we can all mod to last for.. well pretty much forever right) is a straight up 50% damage reduction. You know what that means? she is automatically tankier than most warframes in the game. It just doubles her health and shields technically. On top of that she can get a stacking evasion bonus (the ability scales with mods but i don't think power strength can increase it, maybe it can) of up to 50% evasion. So... multiplicative, but, 50% damage reduction on top of 50% evasion on top of having a smaller hitbox on top of 25% damage reflect on top of two powerful crowd control abilities?

If you die cause she is squishy, you SHOULD die, it should be a normal thing of a non-tank frame. If you die because you were not abusing all the utility she has to offer, then practice playing her! No one gets it right off the bat.

If you kill him you punish that big dead bomb going off too :/

If you buff the damage talents he never ever ever uses, it doesn't buff the utility tier tyrael we already have AND it would give people an incentive to consider taking him down as a threat to your team while he may peel for his backline or even dive the enemies with judgement.

When it comes to shurikens, Genji definitely has the upper hand in sustained dps though i think Zed's shurikens are much bigger in size, and more deadly. 

A very interesting skill matchup as although Genji can reflect projectles, he can only reflect them from the front. If Zed is able to manipulate his shadows properly, he can fire shurikens from multiple directions. 

Zed also has the ability to outplay Genji's dash and dodge it with his shadow, but Genji in turn as the ability to outplay even that by predicting the shadow switch and slash dashing to a shadow. 

On a slightly more realistic stand point, Zed too being a ninja, i don't think a double jump or wall climbing is beyond him, it simply isn't a game mechanic that the game he is from has.

Interestingly, if Genji could fire the spread shuriken, I wonder if he could technically fire at the different shadows as well, sacrificing burst fire for almost guaranteed hits depending on zed's blocking and dodging abilities and Genji's aim. 

I agree though, Zed would win even if it came to a melee matchup. Although dragonblade holds immense power, Zed's ability to kite an enemy and have potentially multiple gap closers (3 vs Genji's 2) along with multiple angle shurikens to outplay genji's deflect, Zed would win. Just for the icing on the cake, zed's weapons are designed to combat swords, they have the ability to ""catch"" a long blade between his own, and with sufficient force, even break a blade similar to a sai.",2016-08-16 13:41:20+00:00,d6jntlj,2.0,t1_d6jjhtd,9235.0,leagueoflegends

While in some cases it works, I think it is unhealthy since you will ALWAYS have mixed damage along with his E. With guinsoos, he would become a mixed damage monster and I think it would be overkill.

3. That's a really good idea.

To your suggestions:

1. Right now I don't think it can be cancelled, the CC will just apply to him upon landing. I think untargettable is too easy, the swerve could dodge skinny skill shots but not fat ones and has a live dodge time of like, 0.4 seconds.

2. Although this sounds really good, I think it would be overpowered. It's already 8 seconds of a very deadly Aatrox, to prolong that if successfully killing his target is dangerous as he'd be an overtuned hypercarry. In addition, if you happened to kill a lane opponent they would be punished afterwards with massive waveclear and turret damage. I don't know...

3. I'd like to think the ult works like Vi's ult. Auto attacks cant be cleansed in this aspect and the taunt is unique in being a ""debuff"" on Aatrox. I think QSSing Aatrox's ult should NOT be a thing simply due to consistency issues and counterplay. So yeah, definitely should not be able to QSS it. 

4. too awesome

To your compliments

1. Exactly! I thought having Aatrox inspire minions in battle would be a great idea. I had an idea of making enemies hit by his Q, aggro your own minions on to them but that would be absurdly strong early game. The purpose of the max rank bonus is so that it doesn't screw up your laning phase :)

2. Thank you for the kind words!

987,"My suggested changes to Genji

* Dragon Blade Damage - 120 --&gt; 110. Why the odd number? Most characters die in the standard, double blade + Slash Dash of 290 damage. This is over kill. By making it 110, it would be 270 damage. Although 100 damage would be a good place too to make it exactly 200/250 damage in his combo, the extra 10 is because there is always Lucio healing going about, and it sucks when you would land a dragonblade just to kill someone with 7 hp.

* Shuriken Damage - 28 --&gt; 25 - Now falls off at 35 - 55 meters, same as Soldier 76. 

* Slash Dash Cooldown - 8 Seconds -- 10 Seconds

* Deflect Duration - 2 seconds -- 1.8 seconds

* Quick Melee damage - 30 --&gt; 50

The last thing we want in a character is to make them more clunky. The smoothness of characters without it being overpowered is what we love about one when we master them. Though animation cancelling is a part of the game, it it where genjis burst comes from and I'm scared of getting rid of that.

The damage nerfs are pretty severe, but I think damage fall off is the healthiest thing to do about his kit. The fact that he can abuse snipers and turrets from infinite range as well as have the ability, dueling potential, and safety deflect, is just too much. In turn, flanking is stronger if you manage your quick melee better, which again depends on your skill level. ",2016-08-07 01:13:59+00:00,d67am74,1.0,t3_4whkll,17655.0,Overwatch

Technically, the more skilled you are at Genji, the more op you are compared to other characters that you can ""master"".

Regardless, from professional player's mouths, McCree is an amazing counter that people seem to overlook.

On top of that, very few teams run Genji constantly as he is a high risk high reward character.

HOWEVER. I think this is because Genji is much better in disorganized play as a team in practice and communication can easily take one down.

Similar to Zed in LoL, went through a thousand changes in the game due to solo queue, yet wasn't a huge problem competitively.

1018,"I'm sorry, but Mei is perfectly balanced if not obnoxiously annoying on the strong side.

Very few characters in the game have denial power like Mei, she can stop most ultimates in the game without having to be absurdly skilled (like Genji's deflect).

You never here in pro talk how they think Mei is bad or needs buffs, everyone in the ""higher tier"" (sorry guys) can agree that she excels as one of the best duelists in the game, and a great disabler

She is an ameizing 6th pick character. The absolute only reason she may be lacking in the meta is because all competitive teams are made up of 2 tanks, 2 healers, and 2 damage dealers (weather they be snipers, junk rat, or offensive heroes).

Because Mei doesn't fit those categories teams opt not to pick her.

That doesn't mean she's in a bad spot. Her win rate is fantastic, she's just not popular because she is extremely frustrating to play against.

I don't want to see any Mei buffs, I'm sorry. But being able to out duel anyone with freeze and a head shot (not on a cooldown like mcree) with her jacket have a shoot through hit box, 250 health, a self invulnerable zhonya heal, with the ability to weave ice wall cooldowns in between that, and stop pretty much every ultimate in the game...

she is fine. just not popular. 

If you end up asking for Mei to be buffed she will be, then she'll be overpowered, then see a part of her kit you DO like, be nerfed and we don't want to see that.

1171,"**Best: Zed** - TBH, many people will disagree here since he has seen so many changes. But I think he is actually healthy as an assassin. 

He runs very smoothly and avoids some clunkiness like other champs (despite changes). I really like him because he has to fulfill 5 things to be successful. Though if you compare his basic abilities side by side with other characters, he actually really sucks when it comes to numbers! It's the fluidity of his kit that all comes together that is rounded out by his ultimate, is what makes him such a force to be reckoned with.

You see all these posts about ""make a custom champ with anyone's qwer and passive"" but you will almost never see Zed there because he won't work without his whole kit. 

As Zed you need to be able to

* Position - When to ult, when to switch shadows, you are squishy and your ""tankiness"" comes from being slippery with mobility

* Land your shurikens - main source of damage, main reason why laning is powerful and safe, and without it, you'd have to be really fed for your E+Autos to take out a target

* Predict and outplay - Zed is so powerful because he has the power to outplay many situations in the game. If you are successful, you are rewarded. Some other champ designs (like the one i will mention is the worst below) are so stupidly faceroll with very rarely a time where you were like ""oh i totally outplayed that guy so hard""

-----------------------------------------------------

**Worst**: Akali

Seriously. Two targetted abilities, the ult is a targetted gap closer, and an E that can be spammed for aoe cleave every second if you wana risk the energy. Her W is the only interesting thing about her kit since the hybrid stats are just a build gunblade and then ap. W is interesting due to mind games, that's it. 

She is so dumb, I'm sorry but you just press all the buttons while holding your mouse over someone and if you are ahead, they die, if you are not ahead, they don't die and hope your team gives you a reset. There are very very few moments when an Akali outplays their opponent and that is by dashing to a minion to dodge something...

1 is if his own team is able to land any sort of crowd control and body block the skill shots (hence why a front line is so important) for Talon to go in.

1174,"I disagree, I think Talon should be reworked.

As of now, other than obvious things like positioning, there are two things you can do about a talon as the prey.

1. Hope your teammates don't feed him

2. Somehow dodge his W.

You and I both know that a ""good"" talon shouldn't ever miss the cone of a W, while all the other parts of his damage are really easy to pull off.

I personally would like to see a rework of talon that would reward engaging on an opponent properly that gives room for the ""prey"" to position themselves out of harm given the right circumstances, an opportunity to avoid the currently unavoidable burst, and most importantly give talon's ultimate a way for each blade to deal some damage, so talons who can position themselves for every blade to hit THEN stealth/ms boost out of combat. 

That in my opinion would be a way to add some skill to the champion and reward him with both damage and an escape if he could land things properly.

As it stands, as long as you can manage to get in range to E a target, the rest of your spells will/should hit 99% of the time. 

If the Talon is fed? well then you pretty much die every single time.

It's not fun being a squishy and dying to the talon burst just because he happened to do well in lane.",2016-07-28 22:53:30+00:00,d5v4fbo,3.0,t1_d5v3cl2,1546.0,leagueoflegends

If I were a developer, reddit would look like a chaotic place where I was being sent  to be slaughtered. There are a few posts that have constructive feedback, but the rest are filled with insults.

The game deves ARE seeking feedback, and have a forum that filters such in THEIR way. If one bothered to make an account there and discuss, then it really gives the devs an incentive to read what they have to say because going out of their way to talk there I think shows a lot more than coming to reddit and the flock of doves here. 

It is not fair to say reddit is almost an official feedback website for any game. That is really wrong to say. Giant titles like League of Legends have rioters on reddit, but it took many many years for them to make that devision. Overwatch, Blizzard's big new title that has been out for a couple months, has maybe one dev response a week. And World of Warcraft? the developers chose to stay away from reddit 99% of the time.

I'm going to have to disagree with your opinion harshly here. In comparison to other titles, we don't have the right to say what they should and shouldn't do we just expect similar treatment for some unknown reason.

2. That's not true. You can search an unlimited area if you click scan and click in many areas. Pokevision is just one of many applications that can reveal things, there is no limit. 

The difference is, you see a charizard at the dead end of a block that no one goes to, and you drive straight for it in the under 15 minutes you have.

Others? and before pokevision and the bug? You will be within a certain distance (not a 15 minute drive which is up to like 20 miles) but 300 meters instead. Pokevision pin points a pokemon of your choice from the comfy seat at your house, up to 20 miles away.

I think another reason would be if Symmetra users decide to put it up to defend a Torbjorn turret or bastion, it just denies a sniper's ability to take it out by denying more than an entire shot's worth where specific down times let you work around it.

The reason I'd like 50 is so that your average character could survive two fully charged body shots from widowmaker (120 each, 240 total, 200 Health + 50 shields).

With 30 shields, it would be a fully charged shot, plus a 66% charged shot. With Symmetra shields it becomes a 84% charged shot, and with a 30 shield buff it would require a 92% charged shot. Just an example. 

There aren't very many situations where that 5 shield would save you, but with armor added on on certain characters or with a torbjorn, the average character could survive some pretty nasty things. ",2016-07-22 01:21:50+00:00,d5lri6c,2.0,t1_d5lqz2w,871.0,Overwatch

Vaporeon for some reason has a higher CP multiplier when evolved.

Second, Vaporeon in history has been known as a high hp pokemon (like many water pokemon) with average attack but the ability to learn acid armor.

I think vaporeon should revolve around a tanky-like water pokemon with hard hitting but slower attacks, while jolteon could focus on speed (multiple attacks) and dodging, while flareon would be more about raw power.

1567,"I think it should be **Azir.**

After most of the bug fixes and constant nerfs/changes this champions kit and mechanical skill ceiling alone is what makes him both powerful, unique, and challenging.

He only fits in certain team comps but is a great peeler, initiator, laner, and scales greatly. Any popular mid laner you know, whether it be faker, bjerg, fenix, you name it have made notorious plays with Azir.

His biggest downside is being counter picked by the likes of Zed who, has seen a slew of nerfs.

I think it took a while for people to both learn him, get his bugs fixed, and balance him properly before showing why Azir fits so well in both the meta, and any meta to come. 

A greatly designed champion (eventually) Azir isn't overpowered, but is up to the player to master positioning, peeling, engaging, laning, poking, auto attacking, playing a control mage, and using mechanical tricks like the shurima shuffle to outplay his opponents. 

Azir deserves this years I believe by a good margin. 

-------------------------------------------------

Other notable champions that have good winrates or have succeeded in the competitive are only because riot failed to balance them properly and they abused power.

**For example:**

**Ryze** - Been stated multiple times, a fail of a rework. It is even said in the insight on Ryze's update again this year (being updated last year and even before that) that he is a champion who many considered faceroll on the keyboard easy, yet mastery of champion was very difficult but the most rewarding. He was a monster, of course Faker picking him up, regardless the first ""victim"" who i don't think is worthy of the skin simply due to riots failure in balancing him.

**Ekko/Fizz** - Same section because they are both extremely mobile and slippery ap based champions who had %health ratios off the chart as well as extreme base damages that allowed them to build near full tank and start this tank meta. Again, riots failure in balancing both abusive champions and itemization. Hardly due to kit or strategic picks, these champs succeeded through an abuse of power.

---------------------------------------

**Honorable Mentions**

**Lucian** - Obviously a powerhouse since release, this ""spellslinger"" has been prince of the adc meta for forever. Always either being too strong or too weak. Range nerfs across the board since release, a change to his ultimate, and animation cancelling with cd reducing power on his multiple auto attacks makes this champion someone that can fit any team comp and be in any team composition being extremely powerful at all stages of the game, safe with a low cd dash if you can sling your autos, and output the dps your team needs to win a fight. The reason I don't think Lucian should get the skin is simply because Riot again fails to balance the champion. Although not abusive like the tank meta ekko and fizz, Lucian still either trumps too hard, or isn't picked at all depending on his changes and item changes. I hope he gets reworked a little bit to be honest because he is a champ that i think both fluctuates in and out of control and has never seen a balanced spot. 

**Nidalee** - Firstly. Fuck Nidalee. I don't care what anyone says about her lack of team fighting potential, Nidalee personally will always be a champion i fucking hate because fuck Nidalee. I think she's always been overpowered. Maybe that's just me. She abuses heavy damage, heavy execute, and it's debatable as to if she is the most mobile champ in the game. Her prowling through the jungle is insane, vision game with traps, going in for the kill or heavy damage while abusing both melee and ranged forms, a self massive heal, attack speed buff, low cd jump that can go over walls, only one skill shot, animation cancels for burst, traps for vision damage and marks, it's crazy and i think overloaded but whatever. 

Nidalee has been good in the competitive scene both before and after her rework and her biggest weakness is the lack of team fighting she has. I'm so happy she can't split push but I think she is unmatched in what she can do for her team .",2016-06-20 15:57:01+00:00,d4gr2gr,1.0,t3_4oxo5t,28316.0,leagueoflegends

They have a monopoly with the ongoing disney/avengers films and fans will ALWAYS flock to the games themed like that.

But friend, you need to understand that there are many more things influencing the game than just mechanical skill, communication, team composition, team work. 

There is a hidden 5th element in all PVP games that have a social system, one that was removed in HotS to prevent toxicity.

It is called [TILT](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Tilting) from the highly commended multiple award winning urban dictionary.

Now many things influence this ""tilt"". Not only can you constantly ""pick"" on an enemy and beat them down, you can do so verbally to demoralize the enemy.

Now while this is a mean tactic, and makes you a horrible person, it WORKS.

Science has shown, that by tilting an enemy player you are able to make them struggle and actually perform much worse than usual. What this does is hinder and effectively mentally and psychologically cripple your opponent towards an easier victory the following match.

There is the ""Server""

and there are the ""Heroes""

Server doesn't mean story, because story will stay the same unless you run your own boosts. Server applies to things ""on the server"" as in patrols, boxes, and event stuff. Think of the Story as separate and more linked to your account. 

Heroes however mean everything and anything on that hero. Thus why it's better. So if there was no event, or anniversary event, story mode quest exp will be the same. The boosts is for midtown and such.

Therefore, now is not the best time to level heroes since story mode is always the best way to do that and there is no bonus hero exp. BUT, it's a good time to cosmic prestige because you can't JUST do story to get to 60, you need to fill major gaps with other leveling methods. These methods are part of the server and thus that nice 163% bonus applies :) 

Combined with midtown boxes (which give more exp) cosmic prestige is good!

1643,"I'm going off of the list of when the last competitive patch was live. I could be wrong but pretty sure Hanzo was at the very bottom at the time. 

I'm hoping to use your last paragraph to counteract the 2nd, Hanzo NEEDS something and a reason to be picked of Widowmaker.

Aside from damage, the one thing that distinguishes them is the difference of ""charging"" and the fact that Hanzo's arrows have travel time and arc.

You can't buff travel time because then it's not a bow an arrow really, but what you CAN manipulate is the arc that an arrow has vs a rifle. EX: you can fire over walls, or with my idea, around walls. 

I agree with you that you should not be able to hit someone who is JUST around the corner with Hanzo's current hitbox. But there's a reason we don't use the bow and arrow in a lot of modern warfare today and that's because it's obviously harder to land than a gun and the reward of a heavier projectile isn't worth it.

But in the realm of gaming you can manipulate all of that.

I'm actually a fan of the ""bigger hitbox"" but am completely against hitting people that you shouldn't be able to, like in your example. It's a way of balance.

Other things that would be looked at are damage, charge speed, cooldowns, maybe even an advantage in cqc compared to Widow, similar to when Hanzo fought Genji in the cinematic using the bow as a sword of staff.

1667,"I used to main Shen back from SII until his rework hovering in high diamond.

I didn't mind and was actually excited about his rework regardless.

I disagree with most of the Shen mains, his old Q was stupid free ranged damage targetted no skill use off cooldown get sustain and had no gameplay to it.

W was an instant shield that wouldn't scale like everything else cause you don't build ap on Shen.

His E and R is what was kept and I agree on that notion.
 
If he pushed fast, he would be way overpowered. He can still push well with sunfire+titanic hydra though.

My problems are

1. He is a weaker duelist - Being one of the **ONLY** remaining champions in the game who don't use their scaling ratios at all, I think this hurts a fed Shen as they generally have to go full tank. In addition to this, his Q cannot increase in damage outside of rank. This means support Shen does as much damage as laning Shen. Because of his weak dueling, his splitpushing isn't actually that strong because he isn't a threat OR a fast pusher, he simply CAN split push just because he has a ""free"" teleport which doesn't help since Top laners carry teles anyways and 90% of them can outduel a Shen. Even in this ""tank"" meta, Shen loses. 

2. They put too much power into his ultimate - with a low cooldown, Shen pretty much automatically begins to lose any and all trades in the laning phase due to a lack of an ultimate in lane. Think of all the ultimates top laners have as an advantage. Shen would benefit greatly from a level 6 passive similar to other tanks with mobility ultimates, like Rek'Sai and Tahm Kench both of whom have increased auto attack benefits when hitting 6 in addition to the teleports across the map. Making his ultimate have such a low cooldown means power from the rest of his kit has to be toned down and therefore he relies on constantly making plays across the map which brings me to my next point.

3. Shen is one of the champions in the game who relies on coordination to make plays. In solo queue, you can't always bait a Shen ult cause you can't rely on your teammates like that, it's almost luck based unless you are a premade. That being said, you wouldn't make the same plays/moves you would while coordinated 
because of the risks involved and whether or not you should fight or flight. 

**Conclusion/TL;DR** I would gladly give up a longer cooldown on Shen's ultimate for more dueling prowess/scaling we can use. I like that i can build him as a tank but would love to build him as a damage threat fighter as well just like a real ninja. I understand why his weakness is that he has to be a slow split pusher (even if it's supplemented by core hydra and sunfire) but the fact that he automatically loses all 1v1s due to a lack of ultimate makes him a sad laner. Lastly, Q is his only real damage which doesn't scale. Support Shen Q does the same damage as Top lane Shen Q and it's not like we have any nice auto attack based itemization that Shen can use. Nashors on paper sounds good but is better for chars who can build more ap on top of that.

1703,"So my theory is they may not be MAGICALLY imbued but can work off of pure science.

For your Darius theory, you are assuming he is indeed a human just like our humans.

However runeterra, or noxus could be the home to a very different territory where the genetic template or even gravity could differ form our own world.

Think of Darius like Captain America, what if he had really good genes/even without a ""serum"" simply the human species in Runeterra is physically superior to our own. Nothing to do with magic.

------------------------------------------------------

As for Draven's axes,

I imagine that the ""handles"" to his axes are circular iron cast designs that have inserts for an axe to be inputted. This Axe can fold atop another, but also project on either end through a rotary gear allowing for free spinning motion.

Draven doesn't actually spin his axes, these handles mechanically spin them for him, BUT it would probably require immense strength to maintain the constant pulling of a spinning axe since the swing, velocity and momentum is always approaching ""outward"" when something spins while the metal handle or disk is keeping it in place.

Regardless, my best guess, if it ISN'T magic is it actually work just like Captain America's Shield! (another marvel reference). 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX4zrcSKP3A&amp;t=2m40s

Similarly, Draven's handles would have magnetic grips that would allow Draven's axes to come back to him.

**HOWEVER** this is probably not true due to the directional nature of the axes, where after hitting the target they ""ricochet"" or bounce UPWARD and the arc towards a location meaning the point of impact allowed a release of energy (damage) but the inaccurate energy function of increased momentum is what causes the axe to not continue forward and when making contact (ex hitting a champion) bounce into the air.

That being said, we can assume that Draven is actually catching his axe with the handles without assistance, but physics-wise how could a sharpened axe, bounce off a target?

[Draven axe](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/soli-5TEijQ/maxresdefault.jpg) 

See here how the axe is impaled into its victim?  it did not bounce, and in no part of the game do they stop on the target unless it's NOT a spinning axe.

SO? 

we come to the conclusion that an axe that is NOT spinning hits the target, and then doesn't do anything (like in the picture, perhaps remaining impaled) whereas a SPINNING axe will ricochet. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

To conclude, this means that physics doesn't (obviously) apply to League of Legends.

I believe in League of Legends instead of the character always being PHYSICALLY injured, they instead have a kind of ""aura"" or spirit that is surrounding them which is injured in battle instead, keeping the character alive.

I'm sure this is contradicted in many aspects of the game, but when Draven's spinning axe hits someone, it doesn't impale because it hits their ""aura"" or physical ""spirit"" or say, psionic armor, which holds a physical nature that allows the axe to actually ricochet off of a champion much like it would against a solid object.

What if Blizzard wanted to buff a weapon by simply buffing the weapons hit box rather than sticking to ""realism"". 

In that case we just imagine the arrow to be bigger than shown. As long as the arrow is visually accurate and not deceiving, then a buff to the hitbox to keep Hanzo into viability is actually okay.

You can change the size of Reinhardt's fireball all you want because it's a fireball.

He is definitely all-game viable but with late game raids you may have trouble with survivability.

That being said, even if you run a defense uru, and even switch out a BiS artifact for a more defensive on you may struggle.

Things you can do to solve it:

* Move points from abilities into his defensive power. (Some builds require 20 points in 3 different kind of bombs, or DoT/Vuln layering are situational and don't need to be maxed)

* Sacrifice damage in omegas for defense

* Use the movement builds. Movement = dodging/hard to hit/enemy will switch targets. 

**Couple personal opinions for him to be perfect**

* Maybe make the Goblin Formula and Strength Over Sanity one ability, but you can change and lean the balance of dosage to one side or another. What I mean is when you are closer to 100% health, Strength Over Sanity's stats go up, while Goblin Formula's stats go down, and vice versa when closer to 100% health. Hopefully though the stat shift can occur every 0.1 seconds so you don't get one shot. This also makes the heal and cleanse share a cooldown and frees up about 9 power points for utility or something else. 

* His movement build is cheesy right now. You typically avoid three whole movement powers in the movement tree and go for something else. I think it's good to have pros and cons of each of those abilities but even in a movement build there are better moves to pick, i would like this to change.

* A non green goblin green goblin costume. I know there is a 99.9999% chance we won't get Harry Osborn James Franco New Goblin. But he looked really badass. I'm not a fan of the ""low tech comicbook like"" glider he has in-game right now. Still comparing to the movies, those gliders looked a lot more high-tech, dark, and well... cool!

Thanks for your montages.

I don't know if it has been said, but I don't like your montages because of the textbook Yasuo outplays that we've seen in every Yasuo outplay montage.

1799,"This item actually derived from Shen, contradictory to some of tanks not supposed to be doing damage.

Shen, with landing all three empowered autos (assuming you land your Q), does a total of 21% of that target's max health.

Doing this 5 times on a tank is hard, but it's still a ton of damage against them.

A 3,000 health target means Shen's Q did 630 damage without building any damage.

Against an 1800 ADC however (Cait's health at 18) it would only be 378, about 1/3rd of an auto attack from a crit or EASILY less damage than your average spell. 

The idea behind this is for tanks to help kill tanks faster in the front line, more specifically juggernauts who are kited appropriately (and should be).

What this does is makes it so you can't ignore tanks and go for the back line, in some scenarios you will want to cut down the enemy's front line to get to the back. 

While I agree champs with high base damage can be absurd, this would be extremely inefficient for a tank to use against squishies. But is an alternative to Black Cleaver when the enemy's neglect armor for health. A health tank with 100 armor, only gets shredded 5 measly armor from each stack of Black Cleaver? Does that mean I should rely on raw ad? 

I think something i failed to mention is that any tank/bruiser/juggy who can be auto based (Trundle, Warwick, Shyvanna, Olaf, Xin Zhao) have the option of Blade of the Ruined King. They have the appropriate steroids that other champs in their class to make use of it and shred tanks while building full tank otherwise.

AD Casters on the other hand have a similar item in the form of Black Cleaver, but this is insufficient against high health less armor targets.

One can argue that bork people lack the armor penetration, but there is no reason they can't pick up black cleaver either, resort to on-hit magic damage, OR pick up a last whisper.

The AD Casters that are tanky, have no such thing.

1812,"Hi i've written countless reviews on Mace Windu.

I **DO** consider myself an expert on him

Here is my short version:

* One of the Tankier Jedi, can take hits. Can take more hits due to protection. Will heal MINORLY if left below 50% health and he is allowed to basic attack

* His basic attack hits pretty hard. I would say, above average. 

* He is SLOW but he is currently BUGGED. He will ALWAYS gain turn meter on attacks, not just when attacking exposed targets. That being said, after turn 1, he essentially has a 22% increase in speed.

* Smite is a bad ability. It not only just received a 12% damage nerf, but its damage is slightly below other special type attacks. In fact, considering his Basic's passive, I would use his basic over his special in every circumstance except when attempting to bypass high armor, OR removing buffs

* Shatterpoint is non-reliable. Explained more below

Shatterpoint is victim to every version of RNG that exists in the game.

* % Chance of it being applied at the start of every Mace turn

* % chance of it being RESISTED by Tenacity

* % chance with it being on a RANDOM target

* % chance that your attack against that target, will MISS

That being said, although Exposed is a powerful debuff, it is about 30% weaker than it was with the release of protection. Protection, until maxed is usually slightly less than health, but Exposed damage still works off of health, not protection. 

To conclude? I wouldn't bother. 

Mace brings 1 utility to the team. That is the removal of buffs that can still miss, has a long cd, and can be resisted, all while doing less than mediocre damage.

Mace brings average damage output. Hindered by his low speed stat, but supplemented by a **BUG**

Mace Windu has no buff application, and an rng debuff application that only HE can used that got nerfed.

Although his base stats are good, he is not the Jack of all trades, he is more like a 7.

I think it would be better to farm ANY other Jedi other than Jedi Knight Guardian, or Plo Koon. Mace's basic does about the same damage as Jedi Knight Guardian's basic WITH his 50% damage bonus. Without it, it is very weak ",2016-04-21 03:17:10+00:00,d2b9jvn,1.0,t3_4fqzp2,2136.0,SWGalaxyOfHeroes
1813,"I don't understand why that's the case in comparison to Exalted Blade.

Wukong, as a Warframe, has an entire other toggle ability that he must rely on for energy consumption.

The comparison?

* Wukong has another toggle for energy consumption

* EB has 2.5e/p/s vs PF has 3e/p/s

* Exalted Blade's damage is 33% of each phys type vs 85% impact, 15% puncture, NO slash

* EB Auto Blocks vs PF has 60% block from the front if blocking (trumphed by heavy swords, hammers, machetes, nikanas, polearms, rapier, scythes, and sword and shields) 

* EB has a free radial blind on slide attacks

* EB has a higher status chance (25% vs 10%)

* EB Fires energy waves

* PF gets increased range based on combo counter (not effect by body count) up to a maximum of 200%.+ Primed reach. So 365% range. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

So the conclusion? a Bo with a range that (is currently bugged) to be able to reach about 2m LESS than Orthos Prime on primed reach AT MAX combo counter, effected by range mods, combo counter wears off after 5 seconds.

VERSUS

Less energy consumption, Slash damage scales late game, Auto Block, Free radial Blind, Higher status chance, **ENERGY WAVES**, and not to be picky but EB's stances don't hinder your movement or animation lock you, you can free run while performing any and all of them.

* Bait out his Q, it will force push the wave for you. 

* If you plan on fighting, you want to get in his Q range so it deals reduced damage and doesn't get a bleed stack. You also want to time your W with his W+Q for reduced damage

* Running up and Qing a Darius (When his baited Q is on cooldown or if you think you can dodge it) then leaving will out trade him 10/10 times since he's silenced

Not to be a hater, but it seems you went back on a few things? 

Positive feedback too

* Brand's E was said to ""glue his kit together"" and that combos would still be a thing. Why does he do less damage to single targets now? Also why does his passive do Shen's Q damage x1,000. Seems Shen keeps getting beat like a dead horse. 

* Vel'koz was said that his W was brainless wave clear with no gameplay. But it stayed? Also nothing on ""researched"" targets is explained. I'm confused. There was supposed to be added ""analysis"" or ""think about"" added to his kit much like the geometry in his Q.

* Loving the Malzahar changes. I think this one was very well thought out. You will actively stack your little minions. The Void Shift is also a neat feature that will keep Malzy safe. 

* What's keeping Vladimir (and probably in the future Aatrox) from still being a crazy monster sustain toxic champ? 

* Zyra like Malzahar I think was well done. You didn't change anything drastically for Zyra players to hate but she definitely has more control over the map with the random seed spawning. She will be able to zone of parts of the map near her making enemies think twice. 

* Cass changes are interesting. I'm guessing E has a low cd no matter what? I'm a little scared of the zoning miasma brings.. it's like there is no running from her. 

* Lastly, these ""mini"" updates don't say alot. What does ""mauling"" entail? I thought Swain was getting a full rework, is this a pity move?

1830,"In my opinion Anakin needs a look at.

He isn't in a good spot and got nerfed even after being determined to be in a bad spot.

The problem is his power comes from gaining an Offense Up (that doesn't stack with other Offense Ups mind you) and a full turn meter, when your ally dies.

Sure it sounds cool, and if Anakin is left for last, that can happen 4 times in a fight.

And sure if you are running taunting tanks like RG you are guarenteed for it to happen.

But what is Anakin to do in the mean time? his kit is lack luster and doesn't really fit into a team well. His damage without the passive is mediocre at best.

Lastly, although he can apply some nasty debuffs, Healing immunity is LESS useful now that protection is out, while Buff Blocker remains to be very useful, the fact that it has a low chance of procing means you can't actually plan on it being reliable in any decision making.

On the up side he has good speed, and if he is left for last he can do some nice damage, but keep in mind this damage is the same as any Geo Soldier on his average turn.

I also don't think your synergy logic of lore applies because in no world, leader synergy or not, will Darth Sidious be fighting along a Yoda. 

Also Sith work in pairs, I think the reasoning behind Count Dooku's leader ability is due to the fact that he was the person who pretty much started the Clone Wars and was the secret leader of the entire Confederacy/Separatist forces. His experience of a battlefield commander is almost unrivaled, and thus his leader ability is actually thematic in not just effecting Sith, regardless of his disciples and masters.

If the leader ability were to be limited, i think a better fit would be for Dooku's leader ability to only apply to ""DARK SIDE"" characters. This would be more in line as the only Sith in the game are Sid, Dooku, Vader, Maul, and Savage. You'd have to be using all 5 of them to get the effect, one of witch is a chromium exclusive while another will take until the end of the year or more to reliably and honestly 7 star.

If anything (while keeping dodge) they should implement the following

* An accuracy stat and mechanic. Everything in this game has a check and balance. Offense to Defense, Speed up to Speed down, Tenacity to Potency. Evasion is the only current exception. This would mean that you can literally build a team, or strategy to counter Evasion, as opposed to praying to the gods.

* Make a leader more valuable by eliminating their Leadership field buff upon defeat. It would draw more attention to them and create more decision making options in battle. ",2016-04-19 01:57:52+00:00,d28cmnf,1.0,t3_4feczv,13660.0,SWGalaxyOfHeroes

1848,"Just my opinion:

**Phasma -&gt; S-tier** AoE slow down means the opponent will be taking their turns at HALF the rate they used to. This was always the case and a strength of Phasma without her being a leader. Her leader will always be viable. Advantage got a big buff. Armor, though I'm not sure of the calculation now, by no means is a 50% damage reduction in comparison to an auto crit for 50% extra damage. The enhanced synergy of this with characters like Savage make it more devastating and now Phasma's basic is a real threat. This all goes along with her already having a health pool on top of protection. 

**Barris -&gt; Viable** An extended match means on a taunt team, different characters will be focused down to low health. Barriss stalls that in all forms. 

**Jedi Knight Guardian -&gt; Viable** She has an aoe ability block just like Boba Fett. She lacks his revive but is a lot tankier and can apply offense down on her basic. Not to mention her passive makes her even harder to take down as a tank. Though she can be ignored, she did get 20% damage buffs so there is no reason she shouldn't be in the same tier as Boba but I think both are bad.

**poggle: viable -&gt; good** Droid teams suffered from being outsped, and therefore oneshotted. Since that's no longer the cause they are now ""good"" again and so is poggle who fixes the speed issue somewhat.

**yoda: viable -&gt; good** He saw very nasty nerfs that I hope really are bugged/unintended. Regardless, already being hard to take down with Foresight, doubly so with protection. A longer match means more time for a Yoda to buff up his team and use all his abilities. Team comp on both sides matter for yoda's strength but I think he should be in at least good. 

**dooku: good -&gt; S** Definitely S, no doubt about it. leader or not if utility really is still the meta, as long as jedi are strong, Dooku will be too. Sure he isn't nearly as tanky as Fives, but the counters are more reliable and his utility in many cases trumph speed down. 

**Sid: viable -&gt; good** I think he is still good. He doesn't hit hard, but 35% evasion against jedi on top of protection is doubly annoying. By the time you bring him low he can heal off of deaths. Really it DOES come down to situation and his AoE application is kinda bugged, but the DoT he has is % based and his basic can ignore the new armor so in my opinion he is at least good. 

**Luminara: Viable -&gt; good** Again, team comps vary, but with the *strongest* heal in the game for your STH or RG Luminara should at LEAST be in the good tier. She still does on par damage with anyone but those insane multi critters like Rey. 


**Side note** It's hard to always place characters into tiers, especially if synergy+ becomes more of a thing.

With protection, his Basic will deal the bonus damage more often, and exposed is less valuble (since it doesn't effect protection).

Smite is weaker now, I would ONLY use it to remove buffs and not for damage. Thought on the flip side it's one of the few ways to remove taunts in this game.

Mace Windu is STILL bugged, he is always gaining turn meter when he lands a hit, as opposed to only hitting an exposed character so he is actually quite fast!

Mace Windu is bad because he doesn't do anything better than other characters. His Exposed application is far too unreliable to be anything useful and Smite is outclassed by other abilities and Jedi most notably Qui-gon.

He is healthy now, more so with protection. If Shatterpoint see's some love, and Smite has a reason to be used outside of buff removal (esp since the damage nerf) I think Mace can be in a good spot.

* JKG didn't do any damage to begin with. 20% increase is still laughable but I have her at 5 star so i can mess around a bit.

* Phasma got buffed. I think advantage is better than before, some may disagree. I almost have her at 7, will try her out for sure now.

* Tarkin, Rex, FOTP, Shaman, Grievous are mainly pay to play so I can't comment on these. FOTP got massive changes and a big nerf on the flipside so it's hard to analyze but you can expect FO teams with the advantage change. 

* Magnaguard is in a similar position to JKG, but the droid version. I've never encountered one, but I imagine his damage is not that good with that low speed too. I think he needs another damage buff.

* Asajj's move already hit pretty hard when she has the offense up and 2x crit. This won't one shot but see it take away protection quite easily. 

* Ahsoka is better by a bit! I'm happy. Though her base stats overall don't look that good they are supplemented by her passive. She snuck by quite well off this patch!

The best comparison is that of JC and Luminara.

You say JC is a healer, isn't Luminara among the same standard? Labled as an attacker, her heal is actually stronger. 

* Their health are about the same at max rank, 14.5k and 14.5k

* JC's heal is 40% of his max health, Luminaras is 45%

* JC's heal has 3 rounds of cooldown, Luminara is 4 round cooldown

* Luminara ALSO heals 20% over next two turns (total of 85%)

* Lumi's basic is slightly stronger. JC: 3.4-3.8k vs 3.7-4.1k

* Lumi's special is MUCH stronger: 3k-3.3k vs 5.4k - 6k 

* Lumi's special also has 2 round cd vs JC's 3 round

----------------------------------------

By using the FACTS stated on both damage vs cooldown, it is VERY clear that Luminara is a superior damage threat, and healer. 

If he is doing far too much damage, then Luminara should be well be an even more extreme candidate for your accusation of roles being a healer, not an attacker. 

-------------------------------------------------------------

I did notice a trend of AoE attacks to be nerfed. 

1st of all I don't own Asajj so I feel like talking about a character without a drastic number is almost unfair to rate without trying it for myself.

However, my problem with Anakin's aoe being nerfed is because there is no justification. It was already a weak ability. In comparison to other aoe abilities it is NOT weak, but attempting an execution with the ability was difficult since aoe abilities are weaker than single target basic and specials. There was also no reward or incentive to execute multiple foes so the ONLY scenario you'd find yourself effectively using Smite's execute was to get past a taunt. I think that's bad design resorting to an aoe to get past taunts but that's a different conversation.

The popular opinion is that Anakin already struggled, and is thus why people don't opt to farm for him, even with being released into the Cantina it was said that people would go for Royal Guard, or Ima-gun-di and for good reason.

The nerf simply builds upon the blindness that had gone into this balancing because I can tell you now it's OBVIOUS that they didn't look at each individual character and make these decisions.

Why?

Because again Anakin was already ""bad"" BUT. He had a high speed stat, and by their words they said Speedy characters would see a damage nerf but what about the speedy chars that DIDN'T need a damage nerf? I thought GS was way up higher on the list than Anakin yet I see no change.

High inconsistency and clear non thought out balance changes is what happened here today. A formula was made that calculated utlity vs damage vs speed vs health, and thus these decimal % nerfs were made. It was NOT made by design or the characters current performance or need.

I think Rey being exclusive to hard mode is what's keeping any statistics people have of her say, win % or damage. Just because she is ""rare"".

I still think she is quite off the chart, but I guess time will tell.

See my problem is that everyone is running Dooku cause of the evasion, not cause of his moves. To pick a character based on cheesey leader abilities regardless of their moveset is non sensible. As long as Dooku has a scary rng leader ability, people will continue to use him. I think Hindering Press nerf was okay since protection means Dooku will have more counters, but it's hard to say why someone would bother using force lightning against a non jedi when a follow up attack would now result in much more damage. 

Royal Guard will break the game, and is debatably the strongest character in the game right now. Similar to Rey, he is hard to farm up until people reach 77 for cantina, then hopefully SOMEONE will realize how strong he is. ",2016-04-14 23:08:24+00:00,d239qag,2.0,t1_d239kdd,255.0,SWGalaxyOfHeroes

1974,"I agree with most of your post but I have some other suggestions for this.

* Wit's End. An item that's been ignored plenty since it is severely outclassed by things like Devourer, needs some love. it may not be the attack speed item you are looking for but I think it could work wonders in extended duels. Hopefully there is a way to buff this item without making champs like Yi and Jax too powerful.

* Shen. May be bias here, but what's sad is Shen has worse tank stats than half the mages in the game (fact) but more importantly, his damage is only good against tanks. Which is silly. You do more damage to tanks than you do to someone who builds no health? Not that Shen needs higher base damages, but the % damage on his Q means landing your Q and getting three autos against an adc, means only ONE FIFTH. 1/5. of their maximum health. That's useful against tanks, but sad against squishies. 

* I personally have no problem with Darius's laning phase. My absolute biggest issue is that his bleed stacks wear off too much. Darius is prone (and should be as a juggernaut) to being kited. Being kited for 5+ seconds means all his efforts of gap closing were wasted and he has to start from scratch. I think the duration should be extended to about, 8 seconds, even if the damage is spread out to compensate. 

* There needs to be a bruiser variant of % damage like Botrk and Liandries. 

* Aatrox like Vlad suffers from fear of regenning too much off of lane minions. I think they should have it reduced against minions but increased against champs. Also I would like to see more outplay potential in Aatrox, making his Q work like a Diana Q/Ekko E/Shurima Shuffle could make for some really nice out plays.

* Lastly, some item changes aren't the solution since ad and assassins may benefit from them. Sometimes, the bruiser class in general needs help.",2016-04-08 02:59:50+00:00,d1ugvdb,1.0,t3_4dtdem,18376.0,leagueoflegends

I always felt not having to reload was one of the great tradeoffs of risking being out in the open.

1993,"Damage mods in my opinion are filler must haves. There is no reason to not have them on any weapon even status weapons will use them because it currently and has always triumphs any mod that has come into play. 

It is literally filler.

99% of the reason people put Toxic + Electric mods on for the Corrosive damage is because of the 90% damage boost it gives. That 1% is for the element itself. 

If you had a 100% physical damage mod (like spoiled strike without the attack speed slow) it would give more damage than a 90% elemental.

By removing damage mods and modding for thoughtful elemental combinations it would give a reason to pick what elements you want on your weapon rather than ""I'm doing this because damage"". 

dps is and always has been king. The only exception to this is utility &gt; power strength when it comes to Warframe abilities late game.

I agree, this should be done for guns too cause you won't find a rifle that's not using serration or a secondary not using hornet strike. They are just so mandatory that it creates filler content that doesn't build upon any thoughtful modding.

In fact we waste our time starting out, finding these mandatory damage mods, leveling them, then slapping the staple mods on every single weapon when technically it should be innate.

If something is going to be used 100% of the time, why make people have to manually apply it?

I agree too. At the very least, short term, archwing like mid air combat would really help taking down pesky ospreys or other aerial units. The idea for combos is more of a long term thing.

I think another good argument is the unpopularity of sniper rifles in this game, usually it just isn't worth one massively powerful bullet per kill until later in the game because you tend to overkill things resulting in a loss of kill rate even if dps is high.

**Automatics:** less reliable aiming, less damage, more room for failure in the form of large magazines and ammo

**Semi-automatics:** More reliable aiming, more damage, less room for failure in the form of smaller magazines and good spacing between shots

**Sniper:** Most reliable aiming, most damage, least room for failure in the form of smallest magazines and most spacing between shots 

So you're asking for what, a high-damage automatic with 20 bullets in the magazine?

There's a reason why few of those exist in games AND real life and that's because they just aren't practical. 

The closest thing people came up with is something like the Burston, where you maintain the automatic feel, while remaining more accurate but not blowing all your ammo.

* When he dies your team gets a stupid massive buff
* He is tanky as fuk
* He is more tanky with evasion
* His special is one of the strongest specials in the entire game. offense down, turn meter yanking, and ability block. The shut down power is ridiculous

Cons

* He can be saved for last. Chances are he is going to get his special out and you have to deal with it then. Only a nuisance if he gets it out again

* He does no damage. Not an offensive threat at all meaning you can prioritize differently and make him ""left for last""

* He's a Jedi. 

* Kind of slow 


In conclusion, his special is the reason you'd put him on your team. Unfortunately his dying passive is far too unreliable to consciously put him on your team except MAYBE in a General Grievous comp where he can make Ben taunt. Getting off the special once is most likely going to happen, you only have to worry about a second special if his team is still alive and well.

2130,"Sorry I'm a little confused with your suggestion. 

By making Shatterpoint AoE, your turn on Mace Windu will start and you can think carefully about who you want to attack.

Let's say for example, that the enemy team consists of Sidious, Luminara, Kylo Ren, Phasma, and Geo Soldier.

This is a common team in the high tiers of the game. 

The team consists of 3 cannons, a ""support"" and a dangerous tank.

Naturally you would want to leave Kylo Ren for last, and Phasma isn't a threat either.

Sidious heals and gains turn meter as people fall, Luminara has a massive heal, and Geo Soldier can get out a MASSIVE attack just about every other turn.

For priority sake, always depending on the situation given, you would most likely prioritize Geo/Sid --&gt; Luminara --&gt; Kylo/Phasma.

When your turn starts, if my change was implemented, an average of TWO characters would be exposed. This is with the rank 45% chance, on top of say average tenacity.

High tenacity exist with Poe, Luke, and Yoda. Against chromium whales we would add Rex, and Aayla to this list.

It however is also worth noting that Geo, Sid, and Dooku have decent tenacity stats. 

With an average of two characters being exposed it would leave you with a decision.

Given Mace's slow speed, you most likely during the battle have been focusing geo or sid, while keeping Luminara stunned to prevent her heals or powerful special. 

This lets you decide between 2 things.

1. Should I attack an Exposed target for 22% turn meter, and bonus damage. 

2. Should I attack a higher priority target even if they are not exposed. Perhaps Smite someone with dangerous buffs

If both 1. and 2. factors exist at the same time, that would be your most likely target. Otherwise it's up to you.

The current shatterpoint suffers from rng but by making it aoe, you, during your turn, are given an array of options to choose from. From there, you know the risks of a dodge and the reward of turn meter and damage. Maybe you shouldn't attack a sid who has 35% dodge, geo has a good health pool so exposed does more damage, etc. ",2016-03-16 05:56:18+00:00,d11ob4u,2.0,t1_d11nbn1,2362.0,SWGalaxyOfHeroes

2158,"&gt; I'm torn about this. I feel it's only partially true. It's not that most of the kills come from ""spam e"" combos, but rather I'd say that most stances have a single combo that stands over the rest and people will spam it over and over. In the case of something like Defiled Snapdragon or Cleaving Whirlwind, it's usually the pause combo; in the case of Blind Justice or Erupting Vulcan Seismic Palm, most people just hold RMB.

This is still considered spam E. You are still spamming E while holding the rmb right?

&gt; I agree that having varying degrees of berserker stacks can be pretty annoying but I don't find pause/hold combos impractical. They just are a bit harder to do. For example, I use Tranquil Cleave's pause and hold combos significantly more than its RMB combo and I run with berserker all the time. I admit that I had a few troubles with Tranquil Cleave's hold combo at first but, after a while, I got it down to a science and I've never looked back after that.

It's still impractical. You'd achieve just as much success with spamming E. There are very few combos worth using unless it is late game and you really need those damage multipliers. I guess my response to this was in my last bullet. 


&gt;At first I hated the new Charge Attacks, it made some hold combos really hard to do in comparison to days before it. I mentioned that I had a few issues with Tranquil Cleave's hold combo a bit back and that was, mostly, because I often got a charge attack instead of the hold combo, it was pretty infuriating. Regardless, now I actually like them, I use them to Life Strike health back and I also just let them slide into my combos once in a while, when fighting heavies/eximus.

But even if people use them and they are cool, there is no scenario where they are actually better, where it's worth using/risking/aiming/timing etc. It's like choosing between Intensify and Natural Talent on an Radial Javelin build where energy isn't a problem.

You picked tranquil cleave, while good in some aspects is actually outperformed by Blind Justice.

Reasoning?

* High damage multipliers of 150% across the board

* Multi-hit strikes allowing for more hits in a smaller amount of time without loss of damage, allowing procs to happen more frequiently

* The most mobility of all the stances. Guiding Light, Heeding Call, and Destined Path all cover a great amount of distance

What they should of done is not increase damage but just aoe vertically. 

Lastly why are the new mods a bad thing? It's new content and more options. The argument for having ""new mods to level"" exists in every single game. You can't have new content without having to work to use the new content? I'm confused.

2205,"This isn't true though.

On the average weapon it takes 4+ CHANNELED hits to kill someone.

With the 20% attack speed on hit that takes about 2.5 seconds to kill someone IF you close the gap. 

Now what people don't realize is you can die as fast at range from a gun.

You also need to consider that with parkour 2.0 you can stay off the ground 99% of the time. There is no reason to be on the ground and get hit by melee.

Air melee has the worst hit box of anything and everything in the entire game.

Also, melee puts you in animation lock. When you use melee you are put at a slower movement speed than standard sprinting.

That's not counting how easily you can JUST JUMP to avoid any and ALL melee damage in the game. 

---------------------------------------------

When it comes to melee damage, it means that per-hit melee users 

* sacrifice energy on channeling

* we sacrifice the use of warframe abilites 

* we sacrifice the elemental mobility mods

Versus guns users, who are free to use energy as they please without it compromising gunplay at all.

When parkour 2.0 came out, melee got left in the dust. We lost directional melee and got NOTHING in return. Technically we lost coptering too.

BUT

With guns? you can shoot at any and all times in this game and be off the ground at any and all times in this game.

So how is melee viable? 

We aren't mashing E because someone can just jump out of it.

In this crazy mobility meta where the floor is lava we have to CONSTANTLY gap close non ending, but the person evading always has the advantage because they choose where to go and you have to follow if you want anything accomplished.

To reward skill, you must reward air melee targetting and gap closing.

If we are able to close the gap, and with the loss of stagger only get one attack off when it requires 4+ attacks? We have to gap close THAT MANY TIMES just to kill ONE PERSON?! 

Combos lock us in animation. Making it so standard sprinting or jumping of any kind will mean we never get a 2nd hit off. So combos are useless. ",2016-03-04 21:02:18+00:00,d0nsttx,2.0,t1_d0nshcx,492.0,Warframe

I think it should be noted that Mace Windu is BUGGED. He actually ALWAYS gains turn meter on hit, not just when attacking an exposed enemy. 

This means he has higher speed, after the first round, as long as he can attack. Technically. 22% more speed. Which isn't horrible.

2233,"I'm tired of only seeing high-speed characters being the only viable ones.

In my opinion they could make Ahsoka and Darth Maul viable by having different situational turn meter gain instead of just a straight speed buff.

The fact of the matter is, some characters will always be the slowest in the game, and those characters will always be asked to have their speed buffed until Count Dooku becomes the slowest in the game.

Just make her leader ability a Unique Passive:  Quick Steps – Ahsoka gains ~~14~~ 21% Evasion. Ahsoka Tano gains 25% Turn Meter whenever she Evades an attack.

Boom.

Now you have a character who isn't fast, but if she's attacked she can evade and gain turn meter. It's similar to speed but more situational.

I for one am not a fan of this because it causes a lot of inconsistencies with the game which is unhealthy. Mainly because Ahsoka will be getting this attention not cause she's necessarily bad, but simply because she has a fan base and just happens to be slow.

2235,"The problem is some weapons may have higher range on one side, the another, or the stance combos change this.

For example, Nikana MIGHT have say, 4 meter range. But the blind justice stance may shorten it, especially with combos that include punching the grineer with the hilt of the nikana other than the blade.

Another good example of this is the Tipedo, one side is longer than the other yet both sides are used to hit enemies. But it depends I guess from how much you are extending your arm, to where you are holding the Tipedo, then the extension from there on the handle form which you are holding. On top of all that, one side has a blade. You can't hold it by the blade, but on the other side you can hold the furthest most part of the handle.

Lastly, one other example was the Dakra Prime part that was mentioned on the forums and was apparently ""fixed"" though I doubt it, where reach/primed reach was making the hit box for the weapon ""bigger"" but not just the length of the blade, but also the width, and for some stupid reason the size of the handle.

This resulted in actual less overall range.

People look at his kit and the message above and instantly think it's uneducated but let's compare simply his abilities side by side with Count Dookus.

------------------------------------------------------------------

**Basic** 

Lightsaber Mastery - Deal Physical damage to target enemy with a 30% chance to attack again.

So basically 30% chance to attack again. 

Hindering Press -  Deal Physical damage to target enemy with a 50% chance to attack again. If the target is a Jedi, these attacks have a 35% chance to Stun for 1 turn and a 35% chance to inflict Ability Block for 1 turn.

So basically 50% chance to attack again AND 35% chance to stun jedi AND 35% chance to inflict ability block. 

**Verdict**: Dooku has 20% attack again chance on top of him, and bonuses against Jedi in the form of an ability block and or stun. 

----------------------------------------------------------

**Special*

**Turn the Tide** - Deal Physical damage to all enemies with a 55% chance to grant all allies Potency Up for 2 Turns.

Does minor aoe special damage with half chance for potency. This is really situational if your team needs to apply debuffs. 

** Lightning** – Deal Special damage to target enemy with a 40% chance to Stun for 1 turn, and a 40% chance to stun a random target. The chance of Stun on the primary target is increased to 90% if the primary target is a Jedi.

Does very high damage (but low crit) special damage with 90% chance to stun jedi. 40% to stun neutral enemies and 40% chance to stun a second target. 

**Verdict** : Situational. If you team relies on debuffs, like you have a Ben, Vader, Sid, etc. Then potency is actually pretty good. But I think Dooku's massive damage stun trumphs it here

----------------------------------------------------------

The leader ability is also unique. I leave it up to everyone to decide. They are both good.

But I would take 15% evasion over 25 defense

and offense up on dodge over some tenacity

----------------------------------------------------------

**Unique Passive**

**Superior Bladework** - Kit Fisto has 35% Counter Chance and +15% Offense.


Small but good offense boost and 35% counter chance

**Flawless Riposte** – Count Dooku has a 100% Counter Chance. In addition, he deals 15% more damage and has a 25% chance to gain 40% Turn Meter whenever he attacks outside of his turn.


THREE TIMES THE COUNTER CHANCE of Kit Fisto. These attacks do 15% more damage (which is comparatively actually a little worse than 15% offense up since offense applies to all attacks not just counter) but Dooku also gets turn meter/speed when attacking.

**Verdict**: Dooku with 3x the chance to counter. 

-----------------------------------------------------------

**Conclusion** : Dooku is better than Kit in just about every way aside from the very rare scenario where you need potency up for the team (50% chance) over a special damage nuke with high stun chance. 

Dooku has higher follow up attack chance with chance to cc jedi

Dooku has 100% counter chance vs 35% counter chance.

What this does is that she can speed up if people target her.

1. **Clunkiness on Q** I think Shen's Q should either be an auto attack reset, something that's very healthy and common in the game regarding empowered autos. 

2. Since he ""loses"" a lot of duels post-6 simply to not having an ultimate vs his lane opponent. He has to ditch lane and play safe in order to ulti to another lane and hope they win. This sucks. Idea on that below

3. He can't carry. Suffering just like the old Shen it's hard to carry a game with him. Sometimes you hope your ult gets cancelled just so you aren't sitting around channeling your shield to save the 0/7 ezreal that fed bot lane. 

**PROS**

1. Great trading pre-6. As long as you land your Q on the opponent you will see good damage output. There is plenty of skill revolving around dodging the q, timing the blind/using the zone appropriately, and landing a taunt. Multiple things to keep track of for both laners to get an advantage and win a trade.

2. Titanic Hydra + Sunfire cape works wonders for him. he can now do damage and not be that tank that's COMPLETELY ignored after the taunt wears off. He remains a threat and can engage or peel. 

3. Highly skilled Shens can pull off multiple instances of his shield late game. He is super tanky.

**Comparisons**

* He lost sustain but gained more powerful shields and damage

* He scales now. Lol. Before he had an ap ratio on his q, w, e, AND r and never built AP.

* Takes skill and has gameplay rather than a point click nuke, press for shield, one auto attack kind of deal. 

-------------------------------------

Suggestions:

* Give him a post-6 passive like Rek'sai, Jax, Gnar, Olaf, Tahm Kench. 
 - Rek'sai gets attack speed
 - Jax gets a third empowered
 - Gnar's gives cd reduction on boomerang catch
 - Olaf gets armor and magic resist
 - Tahm Kench gets % health damage on autos

People want sustain on Shen. I think a good way to go about it is to have a grasp of the undying like effect on every third auto with **champion empowered qs**. That would help him win trades if he plays it well and take on people post-6 without having an actual ultimate to use in the 1 v 1.

If they are going to avoid sustain completely, I think stealing stats is another good example for an extended 1 v 1 scenario.

2272,"TL;DR / Conclusion


Mace Windu is now mid-tier. For the Free to play player, he can fit nicely as your 5th priority jedi behind Luminara, Qui-gon Jinn, Bariss, and Ahsoka. For the Pay to play player, don't bother with him unless you are a collector. There are much better options in Jedi. 

Basic Attack - better than before overall, changed from unreliable move with strong damage gain if lucky, to a move that does more damage when you are healthy, and heals you instead when you are weak. Making it so you should burst Windu down or suffer high damage from his basic for the match. The goal of the designers was this. 

Smite - Okay move since it removes debuffs, low damage and low chance to crit, 10x worse than Qui-gon's Humbling Blow. 

Vaapad - Overall happy with it. Situational. i think there are tons better leader abilities available to jedi like QGJ's speed boost but if you want raw damage can't go wrong here.

Shatterpoint - RNG/Luck based. Luck that it triggers, luck that it targets who you want, luck that it applies and is not resisted, and luck that they don't dodge it. All in all, completely unreliable ability that only does OKAY when used to its fullest. Nothing special.

Conclusion:  I think Mace's Smite needs a severe buff as it is one of the weakest specials in the game. Shatterpoint needs to be less rng focused as gambling is unattractive and it's considered high risk, low reward since it's not amazingly good nor ever game changing. Mid tier, 5th slot jedi for FTP, no space for the pay to play

2273,"**Smite** Mace Windu

So **Smite** is an interesting ability. It has the ability to remove debuffs from a single character, as well as deal special damage to that character. The ability to remove buffs is situational but can be useful in a variety of instances. The most popular is probably removing the 'Taunt' buff from an opponent's tank so that their team is open up to attacks and you don't have to wait a turn. Other benefits include taking down an Offense Up, Advantage, or anything can make that character dangerous.

As nice as it sounds on paper however, buffs usually expire as fast anyways. The benefit is small, but can be noticeable. I don't see a huge problem in the ability and feature itself, as future characters and strategies may revolve around having many buffs. Immediate thoughts include removing any Master Yoda buffs before he can apply it to his team. 

Now the ability however is flawed in some aspects. One example is against a target with 'Retribution' (Kylo Ren) you remove the buff, but you still get countered. See the buff removal must happen in a sequence AFTER a counter attack is triggered.

Similarly, you can't get extra benefit of use of the attack against a target against Foresight. You will still miss, thus removing Foresight anyways, but because the attack itself missed you aren't removing any additional buffs that character may have. 

I'd love for this to be changed but it probably wont. 

**Comparison**

So another Jedi in the game who is considered top tier right now has an ability very similar to Smite. It is however, superior in every way. This is a problem for me because I believe in most scenarios, one character takes up one slot, and therefore should be on similar grounds with other characters who take up the same amount of space. 

The only exception to this, is for synergistic reasons. For example, a Storm Trooper may not be very useful compared to 4 dozen other characters you could use to take its place, but if you were to build an Empire team with Vader as the leader granting 30% Offense to everyone, then maybe simply due to the Empire tag he suddenly becomes viable. 

Anyways, for those of you don't know, Qui-gon Jinn in the game also has an ability like Smite that removes all buffs from the target and deals special damage.

Here's the thing, you can use the move more than smite. Also, if you successfully remove a buff from the enemy you grant OFFENSE UP to your entire team for 2 turns! That's like a Poggle! Although it's more difficult to pull off, the fact of the matter is, is that Humbling Blow is superior to Smite in every way shape and form. I don't think that's healthy for the game, to have one character literally blatantly have an ability that's superior in every single way. In no situation is Smite better than Humbling Blow unless you prefer one Jedi to the other. Qui-gon also is much faster of a character which further increases the uptime of Humbling Blow.

SO why is this? Is this not flaw in design? there's no reason to pick Smite of Humbling Blow. The only argument that exists is if you want Mace Windu over Qui-gon.

Still, there are few to no other abilities in the game that step by step are a straight upgrade/downgrade to each other.

To end my point, one might argue that leveling Smite doesn't grant more up time, or the Offense Up feature, but gets more straight damage in place of it. While this remains true, comparatively, the damage difference is Mace Windu: 3844 * 1.65 = 6342 Special damage. Where as Qui-gon is 4812 * 1.25 = 6015. A difference in about 330 damage. Not only is this difference negligible, one needs to keep in mind that 330 damage difference is nothing compared to **50%** INCREASED OFFENSE for your ENTIRE  team for TWO TURNS. 

To conclude, Smite needs something that makes it special, and comparable. A solid reason for you to pick Mace over Qui-gon needs to exist, if you are looking for someone specifically to remove buffs. 10 times out of 10, you go with Qui-gon Jinn. Personally, I think Smite should double as an execute move, tribute to the decapitation of Jango Fett, the mechanic coming from the new Savage Opress, where it does more damage to low health targets. My other idea is unfortunately making it more like Anakin again, but is to remove buffs, then apply buff immunity. This would effectively lockdown and safely prevent a specific character from gaining buffs.

Recommended change:  

Smite:  Deal Special damage to target enemy and remove all positive status effects. If the target has 25% health or below, this attack deals massive damage and can't be evaded.

or

Smite:  Deal Special damage to target enemy and remove all positive status effects and a 50% chance to apply Buff Immunity.

**Vaapad**

So with the release of Yoda, it seems the name of Lightsaber forms will vary from character to character in what they do. Lightsaber forms are ""stances"" of what a lightsaber user would practice and hone their skills in, each with it's own strengths and weaknesses. Ataru, Yoda's aerial based lightsaber form is the name of his Basic Attack whereas Mace's is the name of his Leader ability. Strange that the latter isn't exclusive to him but it's just a game right?

Anyways I'm overall happy with Vaapad as a leader ability. It is less high risk high reward than Darth Sid's leader ability but more reliable. Keep in mind, 20% offense ALSO means 30% crit damage, since when you crit it's 150% of the damage. With a 20% base offense boost, your attacks already do 120% damage, so 50% more of that makes it 180%. The downside is Vaapad only grants 9% crit chance whereas Sid's grants 14%. So you will crit more often with Sid, but get no damage boost whatesoever if you don't crit. For Mace, you do more damage overall, if you crit, the damage is even stronger, but the chances of critting are 5% lower than sids. 

I think they are the best comparison, the major difference is Mace Windu's being exclusive to Jedi and Sid's being for everyone. I think Sid being only for Sith would bring a big but healthy meta shift. 

Instead of changing Vaapad, I think they should change Anakin's Lead from the Front. It's far too similar with simply a flat 24% offense boost.

------------------------------------------------------------------
I won't give a history lesson, but if you are curious the TL;DR of the forms is here: 

Form I Shii-Cho is wild, raw, basic, simple, what everyone starts off with and is derived from swordfighting and transitioning into lightsabers. Form II Makashi is almost identical to our modern fencing, combining all three weapons however the epee, foil, and saber, noted as the best of the duelist forms. Form III Soresu is what Obi-wan mainly used after defeating Darth Maul, most defensive in the forms specializing in deflecting blaster fire, usually used to tire out an opponent in battle instead of actually hurting someone. Form IV is Ataru, is what both Yoda and Qui-gon use. Multiple jumps, spins, highly exhausting physically but can use the force to make  it easier, it's very ""aerial"" based. Form V is Shien, or Djem So. Modified versions of previous lightsaber forms. The former similar to Soresu was for redirecting blaster fire to the opponent, it's variations from Soresu were more combat focused rather than 100% defense, they needed something else to win the fight. Djem So was revolved around lightsaber combat, utilizing power and attacks - counter attacks for dueling or fighting multiple foes with lightsabers, though Makashi is the best dueling form, Djem So is known to beat it since it has more power which makes it hard for Makashi users to deflect. Form VI is Niman, mainly for Jedi Consulars who studied mysteries of the force or did more diplomatic missions than fighting ones. Utilizing basic attacks from the previous forms, combined with force attacks weaved into the mix. Thought to be the jack of all trades but master of none. Lastly Vaapad, the most violent, darkside, purely offensively powered of the forms combining the thrill of battle and aggression to win.

2274,"**Recommended fixes:**

Remove some or all of the RNG factors mentioned above. 

**If the first RNG factor was removed**, thus granting Mace Windu a 100% chance of applying exposed on a RANDOM target is not actually overpowered if you think about it. Mace Windu's damage would be on par with normal characters in the game. With an extremely low Basic Damage stat, exposed would bring him to average while the Basic attack bonus would bring him to above average but nothing drastic. Think about how many rounds you have in the average match. How many times would an exposed debuff occur? 

**If the 2nd RNG factor was removed**, thus allowing the player to strategically decide who he wants to damage/take down first, it would make Mace Windu an ideal pick but not a must have. Since he usually moves last in meta lineups, it wouldn't actually be ideal to use to finish off a target due to the exposed buff being more effective against healthy targets. It would be to wittle down a new target or begin wittling a tank. Unlike Poe, the debuff would only be on one target and still have numerous RNG factors to occur. On top of that, Mace Windu has a speed stat of only 109 so the exposed debuff would happen much later in the first round. 

**If the 3rd RNG factor was removed**, thus making the attack irresistible. Similar to Darth Vader's Basic Attack,  it would be an extremely minor change. If this factor was removed I think it should go hand in hand with removing the first rng factor. This makes it more reliable, without it being blantantly overpowered. It would be on par with normal attackers focus firing a target instead of it being random. You can attempt to calculate how much damage you need in a fight without crossing your fingers really hard or hope for a game changing crit. It would make a weak attack, strong, but reliable without having any traits that would allow the mechanicto be abused or exploited. 

**If the 4th RNG factor was removed**, thus making an attack against an Exposed target, unmissable, it would bring Mace Windu to a point where he reliably hits dodgey targets. You wouldn't have to worry about Darth Sid's 35% dodge chance against Jedi, or Lumi/Dooku's evasion leader abilities. Most importantly, this would be thematic to one of Mace Windu's signature moves from the non-canon series called ""Tempered Aggresion"" where Mace Windu would sacrifice strength and speed in a attack, in order absolutely guarantee a landing blow.
**Another Idea** - Have it apply to all enemies. That way Mace Windu can still only attack one target, and will still risk the dodge, but can make a real conscious decision when it’s his turn on what move to make rather than cross your fingers for some bonus damage. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
I would personally, if a developer, pick either removing the 1st and 3rd RNG factor weakness from the kit, or the 2nd and 4th.

**If the 1st and 3rd were removed**, Mace would expose a target every turn. Simple as that. The target would be random and dodge factors would still occur but you would simply be guaranteed 1 exposed target at the beginning of Mace Windu's turn. What this will ultimately accomplish is a state where Mace Windu would take his turn, and communicate to the player, do I want to attack an IDEAL target for damage, Remove a debuff with Smite, AND/OR deal MORE damage to a random target and gain some turn meter. It would be a conscious decision as to if the Mace Windu user should risk keeping a priority target alive and risk them being more healthy, or deal more damage to a separate non chosen target, granting Mace Windu turn meter for his next move to come up sooner. 


**If the 2nd and 4th were removed**, Mace Windu would have a % chance of choosing a target to expose for that turn. This increases priority and strategic focus fire in a match as the player can deliberately choose who they want to deal bonus damage to. The player would be informed at the beginning of Mace Windu's turn if an exposed debuff application is available. It would still risk being resisted, but still allows the player to choose exactly who they want to take down first. A common win method in battles today is to focus one character down at a time. If you don't, you risk the enemy team healing, but more importantly you maximize the total life span of each enemy character, thus allowing them to take more turns. This is bad, as a low health character deals as much damage or can cast abilities just like a full health character. This is also why Bariss Offee is decent because she maximizes her team's life span by helping them share the damage. But I digress. Lastly, the target WILL TAKE THE DAMAGE. You choose who you want to expose and they cannot and will not damage. You have a reliable, hard hitting move statistically every other turn (50% chance of applying exposed.) This would make the Passive Ability a reliable tank chipper/initial damage to a healthy character, but doubles as a finisher in reliability so that Sidious doesn't dodge your last attack before he decimates your team and heals himself. 

All in all I'd be happy with either of the two above changes.

**The Basic Attack**

Now to start off, Mace Windu is definitely in a better place. His first ability was very odd, requiring ramp up for a damage boost. Defense Up contradicted his lightsaber style of Vaapad. 

**Old Basic:**

Defense Up and Armor is already flawed in the game as it is not % base. Mace Windu, maxed out, has an armor rating of 163. With a defense up this becomes 245. 

What this means is he would take 245 damage less from attacks. Yep, pretty stupid I know. Only 245. That means that normal 4000 damage luminara blast is USED to be reduced to 3837 damage (lol) and then with Defense Up it became 3765 damage. (lol)

I know, not a big difference at all, absolutely miniscule. It went from 4% damage reduction, to 6%.

**New Basic:**

The change made it so that his Basic Attack deals bonus damage when above 50% hp, and heals him when below 50% hp. 

This was overall, a better change. Although the bonus damage was reduced from 75% to 50%, the requirement from needing defense up, changed to simply being healthy made it so that this bonus damage is much more reliable. The heal when low on health I believe is the real buff here. People overlook it, but HALF the damage you deal, you heal for. In a 1 for 1 trade this makes Mace Windu 50% more effective and this change VASTLY outweighs any defense buff he could have gotten.

**Conclusion:**

A much needed change that satisfies requirements for just about any basic ability. It contributes to the designer's goals of having him be a tank without taunt, tanking damage by remaining a threat. If not bursted down, he will sustain and damage you dealt to him back up. This was a good change.

------------------------------------------------

**The New Passive**

So the old Mace Windu had an ability that granted massive turn meter to his allies while brought down to low health or eventually falling in battle. While this was powerful on paper, it was easy for an AI or real person to simply ignore Mace Windu as he posed no threat on the battlefield. Thus, this passive was never used and probably very rarely (if ever) determined the outcome in any battle. 

**Old Passive** 

Heroic Sacrifice – Each ally gains 40% Turn Meter the first time Mace Windu is reduced to 50% Health, 75% Turn Meter the first time MaIce Windu is defeated. 

Not horrible, but way too unreliable. In total, he'd grant his team 1 full turn which is very powerful. The problem is, it never happened/would happen

**New Passive**

At the start of each of his turns, Mace has a 50%(?) chance to expose a random enemy until the end of his turn. In addition Mace gains 25% Turn meter whenever he attacks an exposed enemy.

Now this is the meat of the rework. They replaced a passive that was actually useless due to it triggering a total of.. oh maybe 3 times in history for the entire playerbase combined (sarcasm). Regardless, this is the passive that everyone was debating on whether it was good or not. My immediate answer is, it's definitely better, but it still sucks.
od
Here's why. 

Shatterpoint is i believe, THE MOST RNG BASED ability in the game. It is revolved around luck and is flawed in design. It's early in the battle capabilities contradict it's strengths in a last man standing battle.

-RNG factor #1:  You have a ?% chance of applying exposed. It's not 100%, Mace is 19th slowest character in the game. What this means is you will not be triggering this often. Coin flip for turn one

-RNG factor #2:  You have a 1 in 5 chance (diminishing as opponents fall) that the exposed buff will actually land on a character you want it to. It's completely random. If you bypass the 50% chance roll, you have to gamble with a 20% that it will even be useful.

-RNG factor #3:  There is a chance that even if the Exposed debuff is being applied, it can be resisted by Tenacity. Yep, it counts as applying a debuff. You will often find in battle, when Mace takes a turn, that a random enemy might show ""resisted"". That means the exposed debuff was GOING to be applied, but ultimately was a failure. This varies with Tenacity and Potency. The average Tenacity you will face is 35.34%. This is a mean of all character's tenacity levels (NOT INCLUDING ABILITIES). So Tenacity Up, Poe Dameron, Aayla, Ackbar, JKG, Kit Fisto, Lobot and Luke increase this variation. The median is 37% tenacity. For comparison, the highest Potency character is Count Dooku with 220% potency. Where Darth Sidious and Luminara strangely enough have it at 0%. Mace Windu is at 47%.

-RNG factor #4:  That you actually land your attack. Dodging in this game is very common. There are numerous ways to increase it and actually no ways to decrease it. If I'm not mistaken, even if you are stunned you can dodge an attack. Even if you happen to expose a target, it does not guarantee the blow lands. 


Other notes of Mace Windu's Shatterpoint:

-Exposed deals 20% of the target's CURRENT health. If they have 10,000 hp, procing the debuff will trigger it and deal 2,000 damage. If the target has 1,000 health, the debuff when triggered will only deal 200 damage. 

-The Exposed proc takes place BEFORE the attacks damage. This is a good thing. if it was the other way around, if your actual attack didn't kill the enemy, exposed never could!

-For Mace, only he can proc it. The debuff goes away when his turn ends

-Despite healing when below 50% hp, exposed procing does not benefit from health gain or life steal

-Offense up also doesn't work with the exposed debuff as the damage is fixed


**Conclusion:** The passive is based on luck. You will find that it will trigger 0-3 times in your average battle. Think about how many rounds Mace Windu would take (he moves last usually since he has low speed). Take those rounds, and add on the 50% chance for exposed. (i think it's 60% if you fully level the ability). Now factor in the fact that you can't choose your target. It could exposed a target who was going to die anyways, one who was going to heal all the damage anyways, or target an enemy who can be hit since their friend has a taunt up, or they have stealth up. Now on top of that factor in the Potency vs Tenacity where Tenacity averages hover around 37% of resisting the effect. Lastly, include any dodge factors. 

This makes the ability bad. It's extremely unreliable, and even with it's unreliability it is rarely a game changer. The randomness of the move is where it fails, but if supplemented is where the move can reliably succeed.

2329,"Haha it's somewhat of a joke he made but also very true. 

I think when one breaks down the fight between Obi-wan and Count Dooku, you need to analyze why one might be stronger than the other.

Firstly, Obi-wan's master was Qui-gon. Wanna know who Qui-gon's master was? Count Dooku. 

Secondly, dark side is more powerful, no doubt about it. With half a century of force knowledge on his side, I'd hope Dooku would win.

Thirdly, Makashi. Count Dooku is by far the top 3 light saber practitioners at the time. Even at 93 years old he's taking on anyone. Back when he was a jedi, he did not hold his own against yoda and windu, he actually beat them occasionally. Makashi is a direct counter to Soresu, the former was designed to win lightsaber combat while the latter though as defensive as it it, deliberately loses to Makashi like water vs fire. 

Obi-wan throughout the clone wars fought General Grievous, who learned form dooku, was cybernetic, had 2-4 lightsabers, killed dozens of jedi, and yet Obi-wan held his own and eventually beat him. Obi-wan would also face Asajj, Darth Maul AND Savage Opress at the same time (even causing them to retreat), and of course was the first Jedi to beat a sith in 1,000 years. 

I think Sith are overall stronger than Jedi when it comes to lore. But if you had to pick anyone other than yoda to face them, my bet will always be on Obi-wan. ",2016-02-19 22:17:41+00:00,d06eh0q,2.0,t1_d068y56,7948.0,SWGalaxyOfHeroes

2331,"That's true, it would have the cooldowns of all allies, but it's when they use their basic abilities. Yes they would probably use them anyways, but realistically this comes down to speed, turn meter, and crowd control and how many basic attacks you can get out.

On top of that one needs to think about how many times they actually get their special abilities out in a match. You will see 2-3 Dooku lightnings, 1 aoe sid, 1 lumi heal, 2 assists from Qui-gon.

The cd reduction doesn't really HALF these, it would be Lumi's 5 round heal - 4 round cd, QGJ's Assist from 2 round - 1 round. 

I think it would have more benefit on some chars than others. 

I think the big thing to think about here is how much of a leader ability you are sacrificing. The turn meter is exclusive to clones and jedi, and you'd be replacing QGJ's speed boost which is very meta, sid's offensive power, dooku's utilitty, phasma leaders, etc. for this one. Leader abilities SHOULD be impactful. If i asked you if you would rather have 20% assist chance for your whole team (40% with First order), or have all your jedi go first, or have increased crit chance and damage, or a 15% chance to dodge, I don't think Obi-wan's leader ability is a no brainer. 

As for Soresu, thanks! I'm a big fan of lightsaber forms. Actually the reason I went with Soresu off of buffs and not debuffs were cause of two things.

1. It means that attacking obi-wan and inflicting debuffs would be punished. Which is fine in some scenarios but it would mean you couldn't ""defeat"" obi-wan and is in my opinion overkill. 

2. Design wise, his major weakness is intended to be the start of the match. He doesn't get defense up, health up, counter attacks, or reduced damage WITHOUT BUFFS on him. What this means is, when a match starts, since he ISN'T fast, the opponent should make the decision of focusing Obi-wan down before he does get his benefits up. At the start of a match, NONE of his abilities do ANYTHING unless you had a leader who applied actual buffs round 1. This is the time to strike, or risk a struggle later in the match (where Obi-wan excels with his special execute, massive tank stats and dangers of counters). Without any buffs on Obi-wan, his unique passive pretty much goes away. It makes the removal of buffs, as well as buff immunity very strong vs Obi-wan.

2333,"You bring up good points like others on this thread.

He has ""fives"" syndrome without the Count Dooku threat. 

I wanted to stray from having Soresu benefit his whole team because just personally, a lightsaber form shouldn't benefit a team. Not that he doesn't use it to protect his allies, he does ALOT. 

I think switching the passive and unique would be far too powerful. Party-wide counter attacks that thematically are bound to reflecting blaster fire from a lightsaber doesn't really fit.

BUTTT I TOTALLY understand what your intentions are. It would give Obi-wan a reason to be focused and would promote a theme of him standing in the front defending everyone else. 

On the Health Up part, that's far too overpowered. Barriss's leader ability grants 20% max health to ONLY JEDI. Health Up is equivalent to 40% of maximum health. Without even being a leader. I think Defense Up, though bad, is thematic. I don't think a character should be balanced around the meta and what is currently good or bad in the game design when the game is still young. A lot of characters are strong in the game and have Defense Up (Imagundi, Savage Opress). Like said in one of my notes, just pretend that Defense Up is as good as Offense Up but in reverse.

My original incentive for him to be focused was from two things.

1. You said in your point give him high speed so he gets the survivability off the bat. This was actually intended to be his weakness, the start of the match. He doesn't get defense up, health up, counter attacks, or reduced damage WITHOUT BUFFS on him. What this means is, when a match starts, since he ISN'T fast, the opponent should make the decision of focusing Obi-wan down before he does get his benefits up. At the start of a match, NONE of his abilities do ANYTHING unless you had a leader who applied actual buffs round 1. 

2. The special. I said in the post above I pictured his special as a dangerous execute like Savage Opress. Weaker in terms of capacity and damage, but it exists with great uptime due to cooldown reduction. I think a good idea of HOW much damage his special does in terms of threat is a good way to deem Obi-wan a threat.



Not that i disagree with your points. They are absolutely viable and should definitely be things that are considered if fantasy wise this character was released into the game.",2016-02-19 22:01:19+00:00,d06du0h,3.0,t1_d063jdl,14496.0,SWGalaxyOfHeroes
2334,"Thank you much! I think the Jango one didn't really catch unfortunately :p

Ahh that's right. It's pretty funny because, you describe him as EXACTLY how Soresu is supposed to be. Maybe I went too far with it? Like others mentioned in this post, he suffers from not being prioritized, nor even dangerous and can be saved for last.

I do not disagree and I think this can definitely be one of his major weaknesses. Every character SHOULD have a weakness however, but I'm not sure that not being a threat and being saved for last is a good weakness for him to have.

I guess my idea behind Kenobi is to live really long, and though his Special has a 4 round cooldown, his basic attacks reduce that cooldown. It has an execute mechanic but I didn't want the move to one shot people like Rey does considering all the other defensive benefits Obi-wan has.

I think the big question then would be, how *reduced* IS reduced damage on the Special?? Would improving its power to be a successful execute against someone say at, 35% hp be good? the three hits would hopefully do at least 20% of their health from that point, triggering the execute. But three attacks doing 20% of someone's health is VERY weak and I think I picture his special being much stronger than that in my head. 

I think I'd have to crunch some numbers to figure out how much his special should do, but do you believe my friend that buffing the special would make Obi-wan a threat similar to Savage Opress?

Lastly, I wrote another comment below this.


I'll paste my point here:

My original incentive for him to be focused was from two things.

1. His intended weakness: **the start of the match**. Due to his speed, He doesn't get defense up, health up, counter attacks, or reduced damage WITHOUT BUFFS on him.

By making this a passive, she now has it innately and doesn't require you to sacrifice a leader ability just for her. Her low speed is made up for when evading. She should have low speed because if she was the fastest, she would be healing allies from turn 1 who haven't even taken damage.

It's fine if you are passionate about Ahsoka but I think you might be playing her wrong if your suggestions are what is required for her to be successful . ",2016-02-18 22:27:30+00:00,d053sru,1.0,t3_46gp9c,8150.0,SWGalaxyOfHeroes
2350,"His movement cannot be stopped and is like the popular game ""snake"" except is not limited to 90 degree turns, the first part of his body hit takes damage from projectiles. It looks like his model in-game is really big, and long (that's what she said)
Ao Shin the Storm Dragon
An ancient deity of Ionia long lost and forgotten. A storm does not always dictate disaster, but is key in the balance of nature.
Ao Shin is highly complex control mage who relies on strange snake-like maneuvers to evade damage, while zoning out key positions in the battlefield. He is designed to play an ability power role in the mid lane, or a bot lane support who can roam.
Passive: Ouroboros
Ao Shin has movement that can not be stopped and he will follow the direction of your mouse when holding the left mouse button down.. Ao Shin takes greatly reduced damage when his scales are hit by enemies, but increased damage at the head. In addition to this, Ao Shin ignores non-player made obstacles. Ao Shin can not recall, but activating the ability allows Ao Shin to gain a burst of movement speed for 4/6/8/10 seconds (Levels 1, 6, 11, 16). Ao Shin's auto attacks are sparks that will fire from a random part of his body that are converted into magic damage.
Q - Storm Crafting
Active: Ao Shin releases a barrage of clouds in target direction. They gain exponential speed over time and its rain leaves behind a healing area for all allies in its path. Activating the ability again will freeze the clouds in place, stopping the rain and starting hail and lightning, slowing enemies in range while dealing three bursts of damage every second for 3 seconds.
W - Wind Waker
Passive - Ao Shin gathers Wind Guard stacks as he moves. Upon reaching maximum stacks, Ao Shin will grant a shield to himself that will block the next enemy ability. If there are nearby allies, Ao Shin's movements will begin to build up a shield for nearby allies that will block the next enemy ability. Allies who leave the area near Ao Shin will lose the shield. If Ao Shin takes damage to his head, this shield is lost.
Active - Ao Shin releases a gust of wind in a cone with massive power towards any direction, dealing damage and knocking back all enemies and removing all Wind Guard stacks and Shields from Ao Shin and nearby allies. The gust of wind deals more damage, has a larger cone, and a larger knock back depending on how many Wind Guards were spent.
E - Shock and Awe
Active Ao Shin begins to breathe lightning in a cone in front of him for 5 seconds, leaving a path of dangerous electricity in his wake on the ground for 5 seconds. Enemies hit by the breath or who run into the electrified path are feared for 1 second.
R - Hurricane summoner1 (I was told the name of the hurricane is your username. I don't know if this is true but I feel like it's unlikely and don't know why they would do that) Range is Less than Twisted Fate Ultimate, can't measure real range.
Ao Shin channels the ultimate power of an ancient dragon for 3 seconds. Afterwards, Ao Shin will fly into the air, becoming invulnerable Ao Shin can then click a target on the ground to land on. Upon arrival, Ao Shin begins to muster a massive Hurricane.
Ao Shin's scales have double damage reduction, and Ao Shin gains increasing movement speed over 10 seconds, Ao Shin's movement cannot be controlled during this time and Ao Shin will continue to circle clockwise creating a Hurricane. All crowd control will slow Ao Shin instead by a certain amount.
This Hurricane does a number of things
-Prevents dashes -Slows enemy movement speed going through it by 79/89/99% -Every time Ao Shin completes a rotation, the Hurricane will deal magic damage to all enemy's in the hurricane equal to a percentage of the enemy's health -Ao Shin can complete more rotations with higher movement speed -Enemies have blurred vision when inside the Hurricane",2016-02-18 21:48:39+00:00,d0522wt,1.0,t3_46gby9,10121.0,leagueoflegends
2351,"So my problem with Anakin is three things.

His debuff chance is very low, so it's more like a ""nice"" thing rather than reliable.

Second, his Smite does PITIFUL damage. For an aoe finisher, it is kind of sad how much damage it does. You will pretty much never find yourself in a kind situation where you can use smite to finish an enemy for the offense buff unless you deliberately go out of your way to save someone for a last hit by anakin before they are healed. 

Which brings me to my third point. He relies on teammates dying for massive power. His unique passive is what separates him from other jedi. IF and ONLY IF he is the last man standing, he will get 4 procs of his unique passive. But if he is focused it will never happen. This is far too unreliable in a match. But you need this power to reliably last hit with smite for Offense up? a buff you can get from qui-gon easily and even poggle.

Conc: Anakin is an offensive based jedi who can play clean up if your team deals initial damage than hopefully dies for Anakin to mop up. In today's game, this scenario shows up by luck really, and can only be controlled with the use of taunts. A buff that Jedis don't have in their kits currently. 

 Anakin does decent damage, and huge damage if he is lucky to crit with his other buffs. With everything active, your attacks go from 100% damage, to 224% (50% from offense up, 50% from passive, 24% for offense) which in reality, IS strong. But compare that to any assist attack in the game and it's the same without the requirements of buffs.

I think another good example is the Empire. Snowtrooper, Stormtrooper, etc. suck. But if you have a Vader with a 30% offense gain on his leader ability? suddenly your squad hits mad hard but it's exclusive.

2389,"First of all, I don't think class tagging is that important. Mainly because, a tank should be able to soak up damage for their team, and be a focus. Darth Sidious isn't a tank, but people usually focus him down first since he can heal when people die, apply healing immunity, and do good damage. This becomes annoying to focus for Jedi however due to the MASSIVE dodge change. 

I think with Defense changes Tanks will have a place in the game.

They lack burst, and sometimes speed, but the variations of tanks I think are being applied to the game properly like said.

A tank in this game can tank damage by

-Having Taunt

-Being a threat

-Becoming stronger as the match goes on

-Simply outlasting the opponent

-Having powerful Specials that maybe are okay the first time around, but another cast would just be too much (example, what if Poe got his special off twice in a fight)

-Utility


**taunt** So obviously having taunt is the absolute direct reason for being someone to tank damage. You force the enemy to attack you, as simple as that.

**Being a threat** I think defines the goal for Mace Windu. He hits hard with a 50% damage multiplier off the bat, as well as the Shatterpoint ability. This essentially means he will kill anything that is at 40% health or below as long as he is healthy. If you hurt him so he doesn't get the damage bonus, he can heal. Another example is Savage Opress, really tanky, offense up AND defense up now when he gets hit, and has an execute ability that makes him really dangerous. But focusing him can be a bad idea, since he has a huge health pool AND the defense up bonus.

**Becoming stronger as the match goes on:  I don't think there is a tank for this, but Darth Sidious and Darth Maul are good examples of kits that CAN be on a tank. In their own way they ""tank"" by evading attacks. They also fit the Being a Threat theme. Darth Sidious will heal as the fight goes on and will also consistently apply healing immunity to your team making him a priority. Darth Maul gets stupid strong if left unchecked with Power of Hatred. Again, these aren't tanks but are good examples of what a tank can have.

**Simply outlasting the opponent** There is a hard mode mission with Chewbacca, who has high tenacity and takes double turns. His basic attack takes turn meter away, he is really hard to apply healing immunity to, and will heal up usually more than you can throw at him if you aren't fully geared. I think this is a great example of a stall tank who could work in arena for defense teams who are trying to run the clock down. 

**Having powerful Specials** Ben Kenobi is one of the tankiest characters in the game. In addition to this, the Jedi Mind Trick is devastatingly powerful. Regardless, due to his evasion and low damage, as well as the huge bonuses he gives to the team, he is left last for battle. Now this is the ""counter"" to him as he can go down last, but what makes him a threat is if you built a proper team around Ben, he could get multiple Jedi Mind Tricks off which really just wrecks and disables teams. Offense Down (reverse poggle), turn meter reduc, AND ability block? doesn't get any better than that. Another example would be at lower levels, JC, who isn't a tank but if left unchecked can get many small heals in, similar to Bariss. They aren't problems right now in the meta and can be left for last, but say they were more ""powerful"" people may consider focusing them with tradeoffs. 

**Utility** this is where I thin fives fits in. See Tanks are supposed to have counterplay just like any other game. The counterplay to Fives is to simply ignore him until last so he doesn't get many counter attacks in! But the longer you keep him alive, the longer he slows your team. Even though the damage is small, if you can't take down his TEAM fast enough, and leave him for last, it makes it so ALL your remaining members will be countered in the end and slowed, some characters can't afford that, others can.

**Conclusion** love the post. I wouldn't be opposed to an ALTERNATE game mode with formations, i think it'd make them game extremely strategic and fun. At the same time however i really enjoy the game now and how the changes to Savage and Mace are good steps towards making tanks able to soak damage without taunt by being dangerous when left unchecked.

-Qui-gon Jinn- Leader - Highest damage dealing Jedi due to 3 attacks, 1 with turn meter, 1 with remove buffs+offense up, 1 with 175% assist and a leader with speed boost that let's you rival the meta and pretty much always go first with Jedi. 

-Ben Kenobi - One of if not the Tankiest character in the game base stat wise. EHP wise he is the tankiest. Mind Trick pretty much wins you the match alone. It has the massive turn meter reduction, with less chance than Poe but up to 3x effectiveness. It also has Ability Block, so your enemy, when they eventually take that turn, can't use any specials, they have to wait an entire other turn and then on top of that have Offense Down which means your enemy literally does half damage. It's like if you got a poggle buff but in reverse. The fact that you are doing half damage means your opponents technically have double health. Now the threat of Mind Trick is real, but if you don't want it cast a 2nd time you have to kill Ben? bad idea, he's the tankiest in the game along with an evasion bonus and you pretty much give your enemy a free win if you kill Ben since he grants MASSIVE MASSIVE buffs to his team. The only con of Ben is his average average damage on his Basic Attack.

-Luminara - Debatebly the best character in the game. People always see Sid, Dooku, Poe, etc. But people overlook the fact that they all have Lumi too. Lumi has the best heal in the game. No arguing. It simply is. 85% total heal. On top of this, she is an ATTACKER. She does huge damage, especially when landing a crit. I think her Force Blast is near the top of the list of the ability that has the most one shots. Oh it also guarantees an ability block? Just to wrap it all up she gets evasion on her heavy hitting basic. Speed is her only flaw

-Grand Master Yoda - he's yoda. I think it's early to tell if his kit is good or not, but i can tell you off the bat that he is top tier. He has average health, is the fastest Jedi in the game (4th fastest char behind Dooku, Sid, and Leia). He already has 3k+ basic attack, which is ranked #17, which also grants Foresight meaning he's nigh invincible in a 1 v 1. His team can resist debuffs with tenacity, and he can steal buffs from the enemy and give them to his whole team. it's hard to attack him because he has foresight alot, but if you don't attack him and use an entire 1/5 attacks on him per round, you risk giving his whole team foresight. Lastly, I already said it, he's so fast. SO FAST. 151.

-Aayla Secura - Now unlike the previous 4 spots this isn't a no brainer. She had some competition. I think Aayla is the 5th best Jedi in the game. Reason being is her stats are well above average across the board, but her kit allows her to be the Jedi version of Count Dooku. 

-Ima-gun-di can be good as a leader, but the main reason I kept him off the list is because he is good all around stat wise but his kit provides nothing that will win the match for you.
h-Ahsoka Tano did not make the list simply due to the Jedi having no way to keep a specific member a alive in the form of a taunt. I believe she can make the top 5, but REQUIRES QGJ, Ben, Lumi, and Bariss next to her. Withought QGJ she is slow as a tree, without Ben she doesn't have the massive turn denial to start dealing damage, without Lumi and Bariss she will die round 1. 

-Mace Windu did not make the list for obvious reasons mentioned above. He is a solid character, but does nothing special and will not win you a match. He is more like a ""filler"" if you can't figure out who to add to your squad

-Kit Fisto is overrated. His % chances are far too low while not providing anything significant to his team. His basic has a small 30% chance to follow up. A straight up comparison to Dooku is that Dooku has a 50% chance to attack again, and can also stun and ability block. Another comparison to Dooku is their passives. Kit has 15% more offense, but only a 35% counter. Dooku gets +15% damage on his counters, but has a 100% counter chance + turn meter. Lastly, Kit Fisto's potency buff is GOOD. But there is no place in a Jedi team for it. There aren't enough debuffs that Jedi can apply that NEED potency. It would only supplement a Ben who Mind Trick already has an extremely high success rate. The comparison is too real, in fact in this scenario you'd only pick Kit over Dooku for the leader bonus of your jedi.

My best guess is, he's a support. Supports cant be too tanky? *shrugs*

2402,"Yeah I considered that, that's a good point for sure. 

Her passive does give her hp but that's also why I mentioned her being good as a late game scale but bad early game.

If you are choosing between Ahsoka and Mace Windu in the **long run**, I would go with Ahsoka. 

If you just got her recently, and she has for example only 2,000 health. Her passive MAXED OUT means that she would end up with about 2,900 health. A gain in about only about 900 hp.

But if you have her scaled and geared, all the way up to her 8698 stat, Her passive MAXED OUT means that she would end up with about 12612 health. A gain in 3914 health! that's FOUR TIMES the gain. 

See the difference? the gain is a difference of 3k hp. That's a TON but is only comparison of an early game Ahsoka vs a Late game Ahsoka. You don't see this scaling in other characters.

In addition to this scaling, crit scales late game too. Not as drastically, but realistically you crit more often later in the game than early in the game because your crit chance starts out at a low % chance but scales higher. Ahsoka doesn't have great damage by herself, it's the fact that she will crit very often is what makes her a hard hitter.

2403,"I think factors other than ""armor"" come into play here. Old Ben specializes in the elegant Soresu form which literally revolves around staying alive. The most defensive lightsaber form developed to wear down an opponent by deflecting blow and blaster fire.

In fact one can argue the Anakin Obi-wan fight showed this perfectly. Obi-wan was backing away the entire time, defending and defending, rarely if ever going on the offense. Anakin's form is based off of counter attacking and two handed power swings. Obi-wan countered him for sure with the defensive form, tiring him out and leading to the end of the fight we all know",2016-02-12 17:22:20+00:00,czxhvb0,2.0,t1_czxe4wh,5195.0,SWGalaxyOfHeroes

2406,"Thank you! 

Her being easier to farm does play a factor in the comparison.

I think in a Jedi team it depends what you are looking for.

Ahsoka after the patch now has a whopping 35% lifesteal, on top of her damaging abilities already healing her. On top of that, she already healed her allies whilst having the highest critical chance in the game.

She is so squishy though. Here's the thing, she is the character with the LOWEST health pool and the THIRD slowest character in the game. These are the MAIN reasons she would not be a good pick. The reason she could work in a Jedi line up is if you can keep her healthy and alive along side a Bariss, Luminara, and a Qui-gon Jinn. The former two keep her alive in a battle, where as Qui-gon's speed will make her not abysmally slow.

If you are looking for a ""filler"" who just kind of does stuff but nothing crazily impactful, Mace Windu is decent. He stays alive and does consistent damage throughout the match. That's just about it, he isn't anything special and won't help you win or lose a match he is just kind of there :/

If you are still starring up, Windu will have a better time surviving, but Ahsoka is a late game scaling character. When you have her fully geared and leveled she becomes scary because she won't be one shot anymore, will hit harder than a truck, all the while your Jedi team will have high sustain.

2408,"So the problem with Mace here is this

-% chance of Exposed occurring

-1/5 chance it's the target you want

-% chance of debuff not being resisted by tenacity

-% chance of enemy dodging the attack


Now in addition to this, moving slower is a universal thing and sure it's supplemented by turn meter gain. Exposed however does 20% of the target's CURRENT health, so someone at 10% hp, really only loses 2% max hp, whereas someone at 100% hp loses 20% hp. This makes it more effective against healther targets. With a 50% or so chance of applying exposed, you will get 1 exposed every 2 rounds, on a random target, who you may or may not be able to hit, on top of tenacity. 

It's based way too much on luck.

I own Mace Windu, played him in about 15 arena battles today, I think i attacked a target with exposed only twice. Maybe that's bad luck, but if you say that that's exactly it, the skill is revolved around luck. You can't build a strategy, or a tactic around it. You have to just hope you get a bonus maybe.

Yes Mace is good for Jedi challenge cause there's only one enemy to expose! just make sure you remove tenacity up cause it stops his expose. Your points are perfect on the jedi challenge, maybe ill add that to the end. 

Running Barriss is the best sustain option. The massive bonus health she grants is the equivalent of 1 bariss meatbag on top of your team + 3 heals over time. The downside is she doesn't do good damage, you'll be lucky if she can be the one to pop foresight. 

If you are having trouble surviving the Jedi Challenge, I'd refresh the battle until they glitch out and have a 1 star anakin, or until he teams up with bariss. If the yoda has bariss, you can just hurt bariss and she will steal hp from yoda. ",2016-02-12 08:54:20+00:00,czx4k88,2.0,t1_czx439d,1743.0,SWGalaxyOfHeroes

I think you also forgot Ben Kenobi.

Aayla and Eeth are the only Jedi with turn denial in the form of stuns, which is very strong. 

Whenever Aayla crits, she stuns. That makes Mace Windu's leader a little more attractive.

2466,"Hey there!

Thanks for the long inspiring response. Don't be concerned about being critical at all! If this post has 50 downvotes but comments to back them up I'd be satisfied for sure.

I'm glad you love the character and have shared more ideas on him, it means alot.

I want to start off by saying your first paragraph and last (on sacrificing droids) is why I decided to give him Stealth. By having Stealth in a droid lineup, he will ALWAYS be left for last. There is no way around it unless the enemy has Plo Koon. I think that's the best way I could make him sacrifice droids and have no regard for them other than for his own needs. I'm thinking about reducing the turn meter gain, but making it so HE gains the turn meter when DROIDS take damage. What do you think?

On the special damage vulnerability, I may have been too harsh. It's thematic for sure, but the only heavy special damage hitters that I can think of off the top of my head are QGJ, Luminara, Eeth Koth and Count Dooku. The rest are AoE which means Exposed will be applied, but they won't do a lot of damage. These are direct counters, and if you tried to take him down by any other means, it would be extremely difficult, especially if he was on a droid team. It's his one clear weakness in the game. With his decent hp pool I think a single target special attack will indeed bring him to at least half hp (before exposed) but I think that's how it should be. Like Sidious vs a healing team, the healing team will definitely want to take him down so he can't apply the healing debuff. In a Grievous team you will definitely want to take down the characters with a Special attack first. Thus you may want droids and Grievous as a leader, or characters with ability block which are common. I think the weakness is clear, but isn't overdone. It can make or break Grievous by itself, but in a team fight I think the struggle between trying to take Grievous down or not will be interesting for sure. 

On bonuses against Jedi, I totally agree and overlooked this. To be honest though, if I had it my way I'd have two versions of Grievous in the game. In the ROTS game, he actually has a blaster, counters force push by clawing into the ground and can melee enemies with his limbs too. Unfortunately not all character's capabilities can be in the game. 

I originally thought about having Grievous start the battle with one lightsaber, and if he took down a Jedi he would take their lightsaber and have two, etc. effectively snowballing a match. While this sounded cool and was true to his theme, it was much too narrow minded and rare of an instance. 

If you look at Jedi in the game, their strengths lie mainly in healing (Luminara, Ahsoka, Bariss, JC) and extra attacks (Aayla, QGJ, Ima-Gun-Di, Kit Fisto. I supplemented countering them in an indirect way but didn't want to specifically have that feature against Jedi as the game has many characters. It does however counter a good number of the current Jedi in game. I think Healing Immunity is a good debuff against Jedi, one that only Sid, Kylo, and IG-88 hold and i think that would be a great thing to add to my current iteration of Grievous, perhaps at rank 8 and onwards. I hope that his high resistance against physical attacks and additional attacks will do enough justice against Jedi. If you have any other ideas on Anti-Jedi please let me know, I'm all ears!

Lastly, droid sacrificing like I mentioned earlier is built into his Stealth leadership ability. It makes it so he has to be the leader, and in the presence of droids. They HAVE to die first since he is stealthed, thus being sacrificed. I don't think he should regen off of their death because he doesn't take their parts and attach them to himself :p but there are alot of crazy things in the game so who knows.

To conclude, thanks for your comment I'd love to discuss further. I think I did not do him enough anti-jedi justice but hope the rest of my counter arguments are accurate.

As for Whirling Blades it could be granting Retribution, but countering with a different attack. Not sure.

On the taunt vs stealth, both work very differently. Stealth is attributed to him running away a lot or staying hidden during the Clone Wars, but more importantly it makes him selfish on the battlefield. 

Stealth means he will be saved for last no matter what. Taunt means that one droid (at random, rip ig-86) will have to die before he is attacked, then maybe another taunt would trigger.

2488,"Teebo has guaranteed hit and I don't see him as being too strong. I have to disagree with your opinion here, thematically the guaranteed hit is true to the nature of the attack from the lore. He doesn't reduce evasion and foresight characters to nothing, he alone, and his basic attack by itself, will reliably hit them. It doesn't outright destroy them in one shot reducing them to nothing. That's a dramatic accusation. 

I don't understand how Defensive Stats are useless right now. Where is that coming from? high-damage characters usually have low armor, vice versa for tanks. Advantage yet with the First Order holds extra perks for having the buff but i don't think revolving Mace Windu around these buffs makes sense as it would force him into synergy with the First Order to be at all viable. The Advantage buff is to be seen as a simple, he can reliably cut down an evasive target/tank now. Your first turn you'd use your special, your second you would use your basic and MAYBE get advantage. That's only 1 out of 3 times. If you get the buff the first time you can't actually use the advantage buff until your THIRD turn. Again, to revolve his kit around this would actually make him weaker.

A solo taunt just doesn't make sense to me. No leadership ability specifically promotes the user by label. It's meant to benefit the team. I think that would fit a tank more. MY idea behind the SHARED taunt is that Jedi would protect wounded allies. Having each other's back. If Windu gets the taunt he will surely die first and an offensive character isn't ideal for the focal point victim of an attack.

2490,"Greetings,

I am your Sith Lord reddit, Darth Forizen of Korriban.


I'm here on a serious note and would finally like to share my story. Not tying myself to the title I mentioned, I would like to share a darker perspective of both petty regret, but also vengeance. 


I'm Asian, and grew up moving all around the world. I've experienced most every culture and thus find myself one of the most tolerant people on the planet when it comes to diversity. Regardless of this, some people come from broken homes, whether it be nature versus nurture, I know a lot of people can come from a sad, dark background which in turn has them lash out towards the world. What i mean, is bullies.

I was bullied, a lot. Genetics and puberty wern't kind to me and being the outsider wherever I moved was not healthy. I found myself going ""emo"" and into depression at an extremely young age. I refused help and would often lie and even attempt to manipulate therapists. 

I later learned however that these bullies, don't ALWAYS choose to be that way, they come from places where they themselves are mistreated or lust for power that is lost at home. Whether it be abuse or misfortune, a lot of the time it's NOT their fault. 

I found myself escaping the world through video games. Like many others, what better to do with your life if society seems to hate you? go home and craft a permanent virtual mask and live to be whoever you want. 

When I stumbled upon the popular League of Legends 5 years ago I thought it was the old DOTA, a MOBA on the move and like others I fell in love.

I however gave into something that pretty much lines up perfectly with the Sith Code. 

*Peace is a lie, there is only passion.
Through passion, I gain strength.
Through strength, I gain power.
Through power, I gain victory.
Through victory, my chains are broken.
The Force shall free me.*

As I played the game, even then I was bullied virtually for my skill or lack there of. Forced to team up with 4 strangers over the internet who bloodlusted for a win, it did not help when you were new or made mistakes that impacted the game and directed hate towards you.

It was these emotions that I decided to stop fighting, and instead embrace.

League of Legends has given me a place to absorb all the hate, the toxicity, the sadness in our world and has allowed me to channel it into the game. I don't play your supports, your tanks, your utility champions. I play the assassins, the kill stealers, the glory hog, the selfish player but I remain NON TOXIC.

I realize that the dark path some of these ragers have stumbled upon blind themselves with rage and ultimately they will of course burn in elo hell. Others who are more talented may strive higher and I like them can embrace this chaos and let off steam through pure mechanical skill. Exploiting the enemy weakness is my game. Whenever I come home from a rough day of school I go straight into league, I've accepted the fact that some people are horrible and the nice people aren't worth knowing deeming them too good to be true. 

Sometimes they will have to learn their lessons the hard way and I've brought it upon myself to exploit the flaws in these and kill them in game, over and over I'll find myself realizing that I am too messed up to turn good and help others naturally. If I make someone angry enough.. sad enough.. toxic enough with no words but simply outplaying the opponent, they will eventually realize the person they have become and make a turn for the better, a luxury I lack.

I feel my talk has become vague, but all you need to know is that I feel like I'm a lost cause to the light, I'm a strong believer in purging the world of its evils but through the method of cleansing. Bringing down the enemy, fueling their fury until they ultimately are their own undoing. From the ashes they will rise and hatch anew, hopefully the second chance that I will never have. 

League of Legends has inspired me to compete 100% behind an unknown mask. At Diamond I it is my job, my duty.. no my passion to make sure that every player I encounter needs to learn that if you choose to be nasty, toxic, horrible, that there is a reason for that and that you need to choose if you want to be that person just to win, or if you are willing to make a change for the better.

2495,"Great ideas,

Though from a design perspective my idea behind the basic attack was to guarantee a hit by default. That is the unique part of the basic ability, a reliable attack that will always land (in line with it's name and actual reason why the attack was designed in the book). 

Advantage is a weird buff. It grants armor ignore (essentially 100% armor penetration) but can be removed upon taking damage twice. Along with a special attack to use, and a low speed, as well as no way to bring on additional attacks by himself, Advantage would really never be used.

My chance of gaining Advantage is so the opponent knows that Mace Windu now deals more damage! even to your tanky characters! do you want to attack him to remove the buff? 

On your Unstoppable Force idea, without a secondary way of gaining advantage it's most likely that it won't last to use your Special with Advantage on. Reason being is you in most cases would want to use your Special off cooldown since it's all around better (aside from reliability). Since Advantage is easily removed, it's hard to keep it on when using Unstoppable Force, the scenario in which you'd pull it off is next to miniscule without say, a Phasma.

I'm a big fan of Tenacity, but there are already 2+ jedi who have the Leader ability that grants Tenacity. This is contrary to the Anakin/Windu comparison since theirs are very similar already. Usually leader abilities apply to the team as a whole, not usually the actual character. IN FACT, Ahsoka is the only character in the game right now who's leadership ability solely gives bonuses to her and not the whole squad. 

Lastly, the main point of Vaapad in my eyes was that it is only his Lightsaber Form. He alone uses it, wields it, and is capable of it. It doesn't make sense that allies would benefit from his own lightsaber form, especially a form that has no defensive qualities.

2500,"Thanks much for the compliment friend. 

That's right, the buffs and debuffs are strictly linked to risk, thematic to Vaapad, but in addition to that the gained Potency in Vaapad actually makes it so if you do in fact land a debuff, you have a very good chance of it NOT being resisted. As opposed to say Sidious's first ability which has a ""100%"" chance to inflict healing immunity, unless they resist it. 

Yes the design is specifically for the exposed proc, but also since he can no longer remove buffs like Smite does currently, you can remove Advantage (since it's two hits) the first hit can remove foresight allowing the second to land, and i'm sure other thing in the future. The downside of the ability (since with Mace it should be a double-edged sword) you risk getting countered.

Someone else mentioned that and I don't think Advantage is really themed to the First Order. I don't know if that was actually stated somewhere, but in my mind I feel like it's simply a NEW buff that was added in the Force Awakens update. That being said, only Characters from the Force Awakens onward would be viable candidates for the Advantage buff. 

Yeah it was fun to write! The only thing I ask for is that they agree that Mace Windu needs to be changed. ",2016-02-03 02:25:01+00:00,czlsn0n,2.0,t1_czlrl89,1660.0,SWGalaxyOfHeroes
2501,"Tempered Aggression - If you want to count Finn as First Order since he used to be a Stormtrooper, sure :p . Though I think Advantage is simply a new mechanic that was introduced in the Force Awakens update. Therefore, characters before the Force Awakens will not have Advantage since the buff didn't ""exist"" yet. I don't see any rule that says it is exclusive to the First Order.



Unstoppable Force - The same target. The double strike is designed to not only inflict ""mixed"" damage, but if you are lucky the second strike would proc the exposed from the first strike. Other scenarios would be say, to destroy foresight, but get a bit of damage in on the second strike since it only dodges the first attack. Off the top of my head, I'm thinking each attack should do 75% of a normal attack (totaling 150%) for a special.


I think the Foresight was not explained in my post. It's supposed to be whenever it's Mace Windu's turn. In PVP for example, he will probably get only 3-5 turns in the average match of impact. That's 1.5-2.5 Foresights. As for the Taunt I know the chance may seem absurd, but it's taking place of a leader ability. We as players need to make conscious decisions, by picking Mace's leader ability you forfeit ones like Phasma, Ima-gun-di, Sidious, Luminara, etc.

His laning phase right now is really strong.


**1.** Ward, taunt+Q at level 2 and get three autos then disengage in brush, play safe til 3 and bait out the enemy's harass that is in the form of abilities/auto attacks with your W which will grant you a blind+shield. As soon as they burn that, go in for a taunt+q and kill them. 

Supporting works a lot like Braum, with taunt you can cc and focus attention on you and is best used as an interruption instead of an all out engage, think counter gank. 

You can save your W for enemy harass like stepping on a trap and using your dodge to stop it.

Q does the same damage in the support role as the top lane role if the top doesn't build damage. It scales with ap which no one builds and levels.

2. Q has a low cooldown. Farm like normal, 2 hits on melee 1 hit on  mage then tower, then one hit on mage. You can use q early as its walking towards your tower and you can actually one time auto after each mage is hit once by the tower, or use it to clear melees with obscure health.

Right now I'm still playing out matchups as ranged opponents are still rare for me, i've been playing him more top than support, but i can tell you this, he lacks poke or threat, even a bit like a Braum would for example. 

Against ranged champs my best method is to happily cs with your sword next to you, time a dodge for when they use an ability/auto to negate the damage. That's when I'd look for a full on engage with taunt + q thus winning the trade.

This has worked out really well for me actually as the dodge auto harass combined with shield blocks out an important ability for them in a trade.

My reasoning behind the passive on the ult is of course in line with other champs like him like i mentioned, tahm and reksai who have the ulti passive.

You don't see them split push much though as their kits and roles are fitted for pick potential instead.

I don't think the passive would make Shen win duals at all. The amount of healing over the course of a few autos is very minimal.

I added the heal because 1. Some people miss the old Shen and complain he has no sustain, he doesn't build lifesteal on the kit and all the popular champs these days have some sort of sustain. and 2. it's not really to win the dual, like i said earlier the heal is very small. What it does though is it gives him enough time and survivability to disengage from an opponent during a split push and stall (a part of split pushing is stalling that one opponent because it's time away from their team). 


I like the damage early game because i feel so powerful, combined with the shields though it's just an easy win. I'd rather trade early game q power for late game q power.

I just recall it comes down to outplaying though,

If you taunt through her while she winds up her Q, she misses it and you land a ""free"" taunt that is timed rather than aimed.

You time your blind on her empowered auto attack? damn she misses out on that too.

2547,"Old Shen 

*It's not a dagger, it's meant to be a sword, yeah you throw a sword that is point click free magic damage + a heal. No gameplay outside of casting it. How is that versatile lol It's as basic as an ability gets outside of Reksais missile launcher. 

*W instant shield with no scaling. Yep you press it, it shields. 

*Ki strike is an empowered auto that comes up more often if they don't break your shield. 

New Shen

*Completely opinion based, his sounds and visuals are UHMAZING. He looks like his splashes, looks like a heavily armored ninja, and plenty of ninjas use two handed swords. Notice both his swords are different now. I think it needs more clarity in when it hits an enemy, but having a spirit sword really links the ninja to techniques in LoL that him and Zed learned from their master. Manipulating an object at a distance for power through ki.  You need to keep Q near you, not just let it drag along, the cooldown is super short anyways. 

*Yes he lost sustain. How is it less interesting that you actually have to think and time a shield? before you press the button and it happens, no scaling no nothing. You literally press a button, and there's a shield. NOW you get it for casting ANY of your basic abilities. It now scales off of health, and it's cooldown is dropped if you hit a champion rewarding you with more tankiness. You don't taunt+W in anymore, taunt gives you a shield. You land it? good you drag your Q with you, by the time it hits the enemy champion you have another shield. If you want the damage faster keep Q closer. He has a blind that wins tons of trades now. 1.75 second aoe dodge is no joke. It works for allies? you want to stop Riven AA burst, Darius W, Master Yi, Garen Q, autos from an adc, Yasuo Q, Jax W+ult third strike, i mean that's a ton of damage your opponent ""throws away"" if you time it right. 

*There is a lot more you can do with Q. If you run to the side of your minions front line and place your q there, every time your opponent goes to last hit they risk colliding with the Q and giving your bonus damage. You zone an entire path, you don't have to keep it behind you. You can put it anywhere. You don't have to be on the otherside, your Q can too. It actually created an amazing gameplay pattern where top lane you have to think about your surroundings. Before it was UH DERP, his Q off cooldown, ow i got hurt, ow he autod me he did more damage, let me trade back, oops instant shield its okay it doesnt scale. Now you have to think, can he land his Q on me? should i run if slowed? when should i use my empowered auto since he hasnt used blind yet, i need to juke the taunt, he needs 3 autos maybe i can get my attacks off then escape the trade. 


I think all of your points are perspectives and opinions that don't seem very valid. There is no way you can tell me a champ who had some of the most basic, braindead abilities had more gameplay and thinkaround than the new Shen.

That was the intention though,

Before you taunt shield q auto in,

then you sit there until your cooldowns come back up autoing people and running around.

That's it.

-----------------

Now you want to strategically land your Q for a chasing or peeling slow, taunt is one of the strongest crowd controls in the game, now with a longer cooldown but longer range you have to use it more intuitively. 

W isn't instant, but you can pretty much infinitely get shields if you space out your abilities, Q is pretty spammable later without CDR anyways. 

You do more damage over a prolonged fight now, granted it's less burst.

People love burst, because it looks and feels good and gives the opponent less time to react, but the number reality is Shen does do more damage over time, especially against tanks.

You also have a longer taunt cd but lower ult cd so you need to be smarter with your taunt decisions and need better map awareness.

I think he's a little strong but as a Shen main I'm not complaining.

2628,"Jarvan V 25 years ago assaulted a Noxian fortress, home of General Du'Couteau. 

The battle was vicious as a master general of the blade versus the great golden aegis Demacia has ever known.

Taking place of a crater thought made by a meteor shower, blades and armor clashed...

In the end, Jarvan V was missing his left arm while the general lay bleeding on the ground, a single lung pierced by the grand lance of Demacia.

Refusing to retreat, it was none other than a middle aged Swain who pulled the general out of battle, seeing him as a great asset to the empire. 

Jarvan the fifth then stormed the fortress, letting two little red headed girls go... there was a sound however, a cry.. of a baby, a child!..

Jarvan the 5th took the boy into his arms.. brought him home to his son Jarvan the 4th.. and told the boy that this was his new little brother.

Always living in the shadow of his older brother, the adopted warrior had no clue of his true origins. 

He tried the shield, the lance, the axe, the mace, the spear, the shortsword, the dagger, the hammer.. but no weapon seemed to amuse the boy. He wanted to rival his brother, he needed to train.. become strong, enough to face Jarvan.. Prince of Demacia, to prove to his country and father he was something of worth.

One day Jarvan IV came home.. different, changed.. no longer the self-righteous cocky spoiled prince who was only victorious through birthright courage and gold... 

the battle against Noxus changed him.. his captors were strong and created the new Jarvan IV we know today.. dropping a cataclysm against his foes.

The Noxians were ruthless and Jarvan IV had to resort to a darker side of him to become a foe evil fears..

If only I... could do the same.. perhaps Noxus was the key...

2640,"To start off, his Primal Fury is bugged. It's his 4th ability that's like Exalted Blade form Excalibur, except its a staff and no energy waves. The nice thing is that it grows longer every time it hits an enemy but right now isn't scaling properly off of power range.


Other than that, Iron Jab is pretty lack luster. It's pretty slow unfortunately, it does good damage but is a 1 power. Ragdoll/knock back. The neat thing about him in my opinion are his 2nd and 3rd abilities.


2nd: Defy. This is pretty much Quick Thinking (the mod) to where, if you were to take fatal damage and ""die"" you instead absorb Energy to stay alive and gain health back and heal. You have to toggle it on though, and the more times you take fatal damage, the less it heals so make sure you toggle it off then on to reset it.

Defy is what makes him Tanky and pretty much unkillable. The 'Rage' mod is core and key on Wukong, as when you take health damage, you get energy! so when you take fatal health damage, you use the energy to essentially gained to never ever ever die. 

3rd ability Cloud Walker is kind of like Limbo, you are untargettable and can't hit anything. You can move freely in every direction but move kind of slow. Activating and turning it off will stagger nearby enemies opening them up to finishers. This is a great ability to use as a panic button and get out a sticky situation without relying on defy and is pretty much a freebie in Spy vaults. 


To conclude, i'm going to wait until they fix Primal Fury cause it really bothers me. I also wish they switched the right click combo with the pause or hold combo because the right click or just spam e combos end with attacks that can only hit 1-2 enemies which defeats the purpose of a super long range weapon. Defy makes Wukong literally unkillable as long as you have energy. Cloud Walker is becoming invincible slow moving smoke.",2015-12-18 10:25:49+00:00,cy39ork,1.0,t3_3xbmg6,7362.0,Warframe

2676,"I think snipers just don't have a very good place in the game. 


Bows are popular due to innate punchthrough and similar damage to that of a sniper rifle, but that's because they have much better handling.


In my opinion, snipers should only be used to take our priority targets, not mobs. There is no scenario where a sniper is good at taking out mobs.


Therefore it's okay to give them very high damage, maybe a guarenteed crit on headshots, and some other things but even if you gave snipers 99999 damage people wouldn't be happy.


If stronger bulky enemies that were similar to sentients in that, they took less damage per hit (stacking) as opposed to resisting damage type at 50%, then snipers would be used to take out these main priority targets.


They should also do huge damage to bosses if you are able to hit one since alot are mobile",2015-12-12 19:56:17+00:00,cxwq09q,1.0,t3_3wj6ao,10520.0,Warframe

1. Instead of random rewards. Have it so you can PICK a better idea of what you want. 


For example, say you want fusion cores for some odd reason.  When you select fusion cores as your goal, every day the sorties reward will be 10, 25, 50, or 1 legendary core (random. Or let's say I want to build a weapon, (some people don't because they already have all the weapons that are on the rewards table) then they can try their chances at weapon part, or if people are going for lenses etc.


This narrows down the prizes people can get. People end up wasting tons of time farming weapon parts for weapons they already have, that are cheap on the market since everyone can and will get them.


2. Make them harder. I don't know about you, but the spy and corpus missions are a joke. Mag of course is a one trick wonder, but i'd like to see the sorties scale. So the first has one ""nightmare"" thingy like bows only, then they stack and are themed. SO the second is bow, and elemental resistance. Then the third is bow, elemental resistance, and magnetic damage. The long missions are boring, not tough, just long. Throw at us more roller skaters or something, less ancients. 


Also since it's already high level, let's get some bursas and nightwatch in there!!! 


3. More rewards. This ""season"" is hardly unique outside of weapon parts. It should appeal to everyone. I think rare weapon stances (vengeful revenant hehe), gaia's tragedy etc. We could also see a sortie specific weapon, maybe the new rapier or double sided dark sword.

2703,"My design of the passive it to promote thematically balance in both offense and defense. In addition to this, i don't think of it as Jayce, Elise, Nidalee, and Gnar, but more along the lines of say Full AD Rengar vs Tanky/Bruiser Rengar, Full ad Renekton vs Tanky/Bruiser Renekton, Full AP Fizz/Ekko vs Tanky/Bruiser Fizz/Ekko. 

Both builds are for the most part ""viable"" and ""meta"" for these respective champions depending on if you want a tankier or damaging role. 

Similarly Nautilus, who can fufill a top tank role, a jungle gank tank role, or the support role, still has ap ratios that are properly utilized in the form of roa or abyssal.

These champions however have abilities and scalings and kits that work with both full damage, or tankier builds.

Shen however in his current state cannot fufill a damage role properly as his ratios are scarcely used.


I have no comment on the Bright Shadow being too assassiny because that is truly opinion. Yes Shen doesn't currently possess something like that but what is wrong with adding it? Shen has a shorter gap closer compared to Irelia and Jax, and I can continue to compare. The gap closer is to do exactly that, gap closer onto a desired target as taunt is limited in range and fits specifically for a peeling/team engage role. Which it still can.

Chaos Order is definitely weaker against more fragile comps, or when the enemy front line is down but it's not meant to be good at all things at all times (balance xD) like for example BorK.. it's good against tanks and when the enemy has high hp but this damage does fall off as you wear down an opponent. Similarly Chaos Order is great when Shen is alive and can wear down opponent's slowly and shield his allies but towards the end of the fight this DOES become less effective. I won't deny it.  The reason it's a shield over health is because shields are temporary and wear off. Another example is Olaf, whose passive is essentially useless unless he's at low hp, is situational to him needing to take hits to have his attack speed be effective. This is bad early in an engagement but stronger later especially in a duel. 

On Mark of Twilight the ability names are definitely not set in stone :) on my old idea it did mark them actually I think I just carried the name over. 

The shield breaking idea in my opinion is for chasing opponent's who are greedy, to miscalculate damage and perhaps let Shen get away. I disagree with the bad by design as if you compare this to a Zilean ultimate, Kindred Ultimate, or Tryndamere ultimate (death defying abilities) or for example chasing down a Morgana, smart players will play around the shield waiting for it to wear off as opposed to wasting abilities to break it UNLESS you think you can secure the kill. 

I think all shields ""want"" to be broken, otherwise the shield was cast for less purpose. If you shield a Viktor laser you traded your shield for that lasers cooldown, mana cost, and of course damage. If you shield and he doesn't laser, you wasted your shield. 

Casting a shield is specifically designed to block damage, by mis casting it you risk your shield on cooldown, but casting it properly to get to block damage. Maybe elaborate on what you mean here?

I think of all the moves in Shen's kit, the things people are most happy with are the Taunt and Ultimate. One of the two taunts in the game, it may seem meh on paper but in practice it has turned fights around. To add on, most of the design in this post is truly a big buff to Shen, I wanted to stray from adding too much power by keeping Taunt as it is especially with a potential second gap closer in the mix. 

The Stand United for self came from Johanna from Heroes of the Storm. yes they are two different games and characters etc etc but the true purpose of the idea was to ELIMINATE the post-6 auto lose top lane to win bot lane. If a top laner plays aggressively then they may not kill Shen but they save their bot lane from a turn around. At the same time if they don't manage to do that then they use their own ultimate for nothing top lane and Shen can still go bot. Yes, like Tryndamere you may have to wait it out, maybe this does need more tweaking.

Thanks for the comment, i take your suggestions to heart and would be glad to further discuss. I don't disagree the awesome will always be upvoted, but overpowered needs to be tuned.

You ult in lane you risk interruption, and damage etc.

2753,"Irelia flair checks out.
  
  
As far as I'm concerned, Irelia and Jax were high elo competitive picks.. ALWAYS. Guinsoos has made them go out of control as opposed to other champs.

But you can't nerf Jax and Irelia because of this because in doing so it would mean they are too reliant on Guiinsoos Rageblade.

People can argue ""just hard cc them"" well that is a stupid argument considering you can say that for anyone in the game, Jax has a AA dodge/spell damage reduction, and Irelia has boosted tenacity.

The reason this item is so devastating on Jax and Irelia are because they are hybrid ad/ap auto attack reliant mega gap closing characters that can go full damage and aren't considered glass cannons. A 3 item Jax with guinsoos can one-shot a Tryndamere without being ahead. As soon as Jax is in midair you have to ult as a Tryndamere.

What people also don't realize is the comparison of the item before, to the item now as well, with a cheaper price AND higher stats, something is wrong.

The ONLY stat Guinsoos doesn't give is tankiness and movementspeed. Both of which are ireliavent when Jax gets tankiness for building ap ad and Irelia has insane health gain from attacking that is amped up by guinsoos. 

~It heals~, it gives you damage, it gives you attack speed, it gives you more ad, it gives you more ap, it gives you more life on hit regen through both attacks and spells.

Tell me, any champ that CAN'T take advantage of this, how are they supposed to win ANY duel stats wise against a guinsoos? you pick ANY first item in the entire game REGARDLESS of its cost, and guinsoos will always always always put you on top.",2015-11-17 16:33:31+00:00,cx3eqj0,1.0,t3_3t5jk6,11727.0,leagueoflegends

2815,"I feel like stating that Zealot Charge is mandatory and Artanis needing an AA range buff is contradictory. With Zealot Charge, you gap close and hit them anyways regardless of your AA range. AA range matters in follow up or when Zealot Charge is not up, which people are complaining about anyways.


  
  
The fact of the matter is, post-16 you are never auto attacking someone unless they are melee hitting you, or cc'd. You are always simply using Zealot Charge when off cooldown because it is a point click gap closer with tons of damage. Even if you are a ranged character it's hard to kite him since his gap close is just about that of anyone's attack range adding regards to stutter stepping requirements.


  
  
In my opinion, the best fix for this, now read the whole thing first please, is to make Zealot Charge innate BUT make its range scale with level. That way level 1-4 you won't really see a change, but as the game goes on you will see the power of Zealot Charge rising, you free up that talent choice at 16 for other picks, and this may not help his AA range directly, but every 4 seconds you are in range for your W AND for some additional autos with stutter stepping.


  
  
In addition to this, i think it'd be a good idea to give Artanis innate movement speed OR Relentless while his shields are up. It will give him the mobility he needs to fight and fits him thematically.


  
  
An AA Range buff will not fix Artanis because 1. It won't prevent people from picking Zealot Charge (nothing REALLY wrong with that but) once you have Zealot Charge your AA Range means a whole lot less, and 2. he is big slow as it is, you might get off one.. MAYBE two more autos in a fight but without Prism Sphere you aren't landing any more attacks than normal, he needs to not be a stick in the ground that hits things that are nearby, as a warrior he needs to move, peel, and most importantly fight. Your AA range doesn't help you against crowdcontrol as much as relentless will.

2830,"Hello all,
  
  
First timer here new to everything.
  
  
Here is [Haxorus BREAK](http://imgur.com/1scFiQE)
  
  
HP: 190
  
  
Ability:  If Haxorus BREAK knocks out one of your opponent's pokemon with it's attack and dealt more damage to the opponent's pokemon than their remaining hp, choose one of your opponent's pokemon and deal the remainder of this attack's damage to that pokemon. If another pokemon is knocked out in this way and there is still remaining damage from Haxorus BREAK's attack, choose another one of your opponent's pokemon and deal the remainder of the attack's damage to that pokemon.
  
  
Cosmetics:  
  
  
So for starters, I'm terrible at photoshop but did my best. Image from Pinterest and is for public use. I just photoshopped it in MS Paint to make him golden. Colored the horn and nails, then just scribbled the backdrop.
  
  
Ability:
  
  
Now the read is long but I wanted to be clear with my intention. The TL;DR is, if you overkill an enemy pokemon with your attack, any remainder of damage can be carried over to an opponent's pokemon of your choose. 
  
  
For ex: if the defending pokemon has 50 hp left, and your attack does 100 damage, you knock out the defending pokemon and have 50 damage  left that you can use on one of your opponent's remaining pokemon. 
  
  
Another ex: The defending pokemon is a Lapras with 60/110 hp, and your opponent has a Zubat 50/50 hp on the bench and a Pikachu with 20/60 HP on their bench and an entei with 70/130 hp on their bench.. Say Haxorus's attack does 130 damage (Dragon Pulse from BreakTHROUGH), Lapras would be knocked out using the 60 damage from the 130, you have 70 left. You can spend 50 out of the 70 you have left to knockout zubat, and then 20 to knockout pikachu, or knockout entei with the 70 left, etc. 
  
  
With the new Haxorus in BreakTHROUGH, he has the ability Dragondance, where after using, all further attacks do 100 more damage as long as haxorus remains your active pokemon. That means his other abilities Slash (60) and Dragon Pulse (130) are enhanced to 160 and 230 respectively. With the Mold Breaker ability you are able to knockout your target and not have to worry about overkilling them as you can use the remaining damage.

There's no reason it wouldn't be good.
  
  
Personally, due to the fact that it can run any energy, i think the strongest way to set it up is actually through a fairy type deck that people might despise. With Xerneas and Aromatisse you can quickly powerup a Mega Mewtwo Y EX until it is ready to one-shot anything it runs into. 
  
  
The best way to shut Mega Mewtwo Y EX down is probably disabling it's energy or shutting it down with it's psychic type weakness. ",2015-11-11 08:22:24+00:00,cwwc6ru,1.0,t3_3scc11,30410.0,ptcgo

If you are new to him, spec into the Rending Cleave that deals 50% bonus damage over time, and not double bombs starting out. Practice your W ability in games and then you can spec into double bombs when you are confident, it's a nice skill shot but kind of skinny and hard to land. 
  
  
Blink is an escape until you spec into wormhole. Rewind is very powerful on Zeratul as you can double cast your basic abilities, however if you spec into Wormhole you can't double blink away, unfortunately you have to go back to your original location before blinking again.

2901,"I completely agree. In my opinion he would need a new q altogether. 
  
  
Reason being is, like Valla, and Zagara and a few others, there is a ""caster"" build, and an ""auto attack"" build. 
  
  
I think it would be awesome if Tychus had a unique auto attack, which was basically his Q, but you just use the ""A"" or right click button and it will do the aoe over kill effect. 
  
  
For example, the Caster Valla build would usually go with Strafe, because while your spells are on cooldown you can use Strafe. Whereas if you used Strafe with the auto attack build, your auto attack talents are wasted during that heroic duration because you cannot auto attack.
  
  
Similar to Tychus, if you went Auto attack, you would MOST LIKELY pick the lazor because in Odin form you are usually casting spells more and re positioning (you can still auto attack) vice versa with the laser. Valla's Rain of vengeance works with both caster and auto attack builds but doesn't hinder either necessarily. 
  
  
Move ""Overkill"" to the A button but make it work the same as his current q minus the mana cost and adding the permanent cast time (rearrange talents and damage) then you can add a new Q ability that would throw in talents under the First Aid and Stone Skin tree so you aren't forced to pick those if you want to play risky. 
  
**Proposed Q ability:**  
  
  
**Q - Lock and Load - Toggle** -  Tychus can switch weapons with the Q ability (like Jinx from LoL) Choosing between his Minigun/Chaingun and a SR-16 Obliterator Shotgun rifle. 
  
**Auto attacks from Tychus's chaingun** would work exactly how over kill does now, right click/press a and click on the target desired and Tychus will fire his chaingun at the target while moving dealing damage to them and anyone in the aoe cone. 
  
**Auto attacks from Tychus's shotgun** work just like any other character, move and shoot, move and shoot, but the closer the enemy is the more damage it does. It would aoe in front of him stopping at the first enemy hit, but a close enemy could be hit by more than one pellet.

My conception of a tank isn't a tanky character who can take alot of hits. Because that doesn't help your team other than you, yourself are alive longer/can take bullets while reviving allies.

You can't ""take a bullet"" for your friend or even Frontline the masses outside of a hallway.

The fact of the matter is, an ult was cast and thus the opponent AND allies assume the ult is being cast and the following effect will take place, thus certain reactions take place, for that to mean nothing during an event seems awkward, do i know if his ult went on cd? or did it not go on cd? how come purifier beam which is TARGETTED should get refunded the cd, but if I went the other ult, JUST BECAUSE it isn't a target ability, it still casts? Shouldn't I be refunded the cd if it doesn't hit anything? 
  
There is a lot of back and forth in opinion and intention here. Blizzard only knows of course, but my best argument is that thoughtful casting + reaction to visuals should = the ult going on cooldown as it did something, even if not damage, and the player took that risk/meant to use the ultimate ability.

Wizard - unknown
  
But with the MASSIVE build variation in Diablo III as a game itself, there's no reason there can't be 1 more in each class (maybe one of each gender).
  
Sonya uses dual swords, the other would probably use a 2 hander, Sonya focuses on the grappling hook think, spin attacks, and the jump slam, the other can focus more on cleaving, summoning the ancients, throwing spears, etc.
  
Johanna is a flail and shield, the other Crusader could easily wield a 2 handed sword, flail, or sword and shield, other moves Johanna doesn't use are the notable 'Avatar' = Akarat's Champion, Phalanx, bringing out the armour horsey, Fist of Heaven, perhaps more of an aura based tank with cleave, etc.

Thanks for the feedback. Can I be honest? I wanna steal your ideas xD

Bladestorm right now doesn't kill late game, its damage falls off and is a press 4 to win ability. It's good late game only because you are invincible.  This is the main reason why I came up with the change before DE removes it anyways just like they change Radial Javelin, Mesa change, the Saryn rework, etc. 

On the Shuriken changes you are right, all I thought about was number of Shuriken increase and not the damage itself.  I like the augment idea, it will grant Shuriken a use late game while still easy to dumpster mods by press the 1 button 5 times.  I just realized to reach the 5 shuriken it would cost 100 energy.. should change that.  
  
Well maybe have it have an increased default range? I don't think people should get it for free. I think it's definitely a coordinated move not a free bonus move when you want it to be aoe.  
  
For Teleport, yes it's fine because of daggers but what if people don't use daggers? is that a mandatory thing on Ash for his damage to be viable? Any melee weapon ASIDE from daggers can be use competently in late game, daggers aren't nearly as good up front which I believe is the reason behind cover lethality. My problem with the ability now is that level 100 bombard? teleport and use a finisher while... getting gunned down by the rest? I guess you would clean up with Blade Storm first? 

  To be honest i never find myself able to use Teleport late game because it puts you in the middle of danger when you are trying to kill a heavy. 

&gt;Your idea sounds decent but could make more sense by making Ash partially see through but covered in smoke, thus reducing enemy accuracy by a lot. On top of this yes he should get a lot increased movement speed and casting speed and I think that it should be a toggle ability, an interactive way it could work with Teleport is that it could work like the current bladestorm, you quickly teleport and kill targets automatically, but a lot fewer targets, like 3 per teleport.  

^ Let's do this. it would solve the spam 4 issue, you can focus a bombard, but take care of any sidelings that get in the way
  
I haven't thought a lot about the energy cost like I mentioned, I know it eliminates the point of Primed Flow but to me the 4 ability proposed is too powerful to have the ability to stay on all the time. I Fear the micromanaging on always toggling it on and off as you desire is strong but unattractive. People would ALWAYS use 4 unless too lazy to, I view 4 as a more: I NEED DAMAGE PANIC BUTTON NAO!.  I don't disagree with this, I'm sure many people will like the toggle idea. LET THE COMMUNITY DECIDE!",2015-10-03 19:04:52+00:00,cvmzx95,2.0,t1_cvmz7qp,1128.0,Warframe

3004,"1.  Combos. All combos should have 4 ""movements"". Whenever doing a combo, either have it available when moving back, standing still, walking forward, or sprinting forward  

2. Jump attacks should have a homing mechanism against airborne targets similar to archwing melee.   

3. More damage overall. Melee should not fall off late game and should reward a player for being close and risking heavy damage tanking, rather than punished. (Talking to you conclave too..)

4. Mention the range of all melee weapons under stats, so we know how much a Reach mod effects it and what you like.. for example, a sword you increase the range from the tip onwards, but on a double bladed orthos it should extend both sides, what about the Kronen though? there are sharp edges on each tip BUT the sides have blades too so shouldnt range increase the length AND width from hilt? We will never know... 

5.  Stances should be re balanced to have all stances viable, showing the damage multipliers and damage type conversions.  i think it's utterly stupid and irresponsible that there are hidden damage bonuses in the game and we have no idea what we are putting out. Why do we have to rely on the wiki and their testing? Dakra Prime IS NOT THAT STRONG. Crimson Dervish is.   

6. Blocking needs to be reworked, again, players going sword alone should be rewarded for risking themselves out in the open not punished. I suggest taking % reduction from enemies in front of you scaling up high if your target reticle is right on the enemy, but down further to the sides. Also Orthos Prime is unique as an example of being able to parry a 60-70% radius in front of you because of the weapon type.   

7.  Channeling mods should be completely reworked and allow someone to go sword alone with Channeling constantly in exchange for less power usage due to energy consumption.  Channeling should cost more for slower weapons, and less for faster weapons. It only makes sense.   

8. Remove Pressure Point and add the damage to all melee weapons to free us up a slot. It's mandatory on all melee weapons so just have it added anyways. If you dont want to give newbies that kind of damage, then have weapons have higher damage as you rank it up.     

9.  Add an exilus slot to melee weapons so we have room for channeling efficiency, range, or other of those mods we never use   

10. Reward Tenno in the very much long term for mastering a weapon even as simple as the skana. Similar to mod energy and Forma, maybe when you fully forma the weapon you can combine stances or choose which combos to bring to battle or a mission for a thousand different combinations of fighting styles that FIT YOU.

Ideally with an afk, the match should be restarted/re queued but that could take FOREVER.

Players have 60 minutes, 5 player Queue.

During these 60 minutes all enemies start at the 60 minute level but start spawning slowly which exponentially increases throughout the mission.

During this time, you have to complete 10 Orokin-like Spy vaults (you can only fail 3 of them), 10 Extractors, 10 Waves of Interception (5 points) which each have an Orokin pod that needs to be defended and kept alive, also there will be a capture target every 5 minutes who will run from one end of the map to the other escorted by each of the types of eximus who can now sprint, and Life support will also be required to stay alive while Vor spawns every 15 minutes along with a newly corrupted Juggernaut, Maniac, and Bursa.  at the 20 minute mark a door will open and the timer will freeze until a Sabotage mission is completed. There are no vaults but you can send however many Tenno as you want to fight the two Grineer sub bosses. This will happen again at the 40 minute mark but instead will have Corpus themed bosses. 

Failure of any of the above will result in the ending of the mission.

At the 60 Minute mark, another door opens to the boss fight which is the Neural sentry who is like a sentinel from the x-man and has a zillion 
lasers to dodge that can't be destroyed and moving orokin orbs that stomp you to the ground. The Sentry will spawn 3 Corrupted Tenno (with advanced AI) who will be chosen at random who have fully equipped prime weapons, parkour, and Warframe powers (depending on the frame)

While fighting the sentry, in order to bring down his shields someone must complete a simple hack+deception, halfway through the boss fight a random player is knocked out of the arena and forced to rescue a target who has a ton of wardens and orokin traps around.

When the Sentry is destroyed everyone must have good parkour skills cause the entire ship starts to fall apart and the WHOLE team must make it and parkour through the collapsing ship and reach their lisets, on the way out the neural sentry sends out its last command as 100 orokin ships fly out that you must destroy with Archwing but defend your Lisets that were damaged.

You don't see top or support mains there. ADC is dominant and it takes high skill to fully utilize them, glass cannon sustained damage. Of course people want to kill them first.

**CLG:**  They are told that everyone but the special you is trash. Therefore their self esteem is boosted to a ""golden"" time but when it came to performing in the bed, they just keep losing and can't ""go solo mid"" . They try using other more flexible methods but just end up with injured fingers. Maybe one day.. one day you two will have a holiday overseas together but chances are not this year. 


**TSM:**  When you first started dating things were great! every night felt like a win. Your new european boyfriend is extremely aggressive when it comes down to going ""solo mid"" but mechanically great. Unfortunately, the only thing missing is that he doesn't gank you up top. Most girls find that a chore but you are one who actually enjoys it.. when it happens. As of now you aren't sure about the long range carry held down below but that can be substituted. 



**TL:** Been Stood up multiple times. But when they do show up they shine. Strong all around but boy oh boy when it comes to the lane down mid they really know what they are doing. You are unsure what yelling the word ""Shurima"" is but go along with it because it makes him feel powerful. So good you feel like he can handle 4 parts of you at the same time, in the end finishing on the third. 


**TiP:** you do some funky stuff in bed and it works great half the time, but the other half ends with you getting kicked out with your pants down. Same for the other side. Although he constantly talks about his bosses issues and lies, what matters is if you perform well you keep the girl. He seems to be good with the sword and will blow you away then knock you up 5 times.


**T8:**  Desperate. If you can tell your friends you're with an NA pro in the LCS then you are set and will settle for less.

**Dignitas**  Things will never be the same without your little cutie pie.. it really left scars. Your Kiwikid isn't going anywhere, though and you've got a great chef for you! There are moments where it looks like you have a really good streak! unfortunately just bound to be broken as no streak lasts

**Gravity:**  Easy going and fun at first, but you are not sure if things are going to be taken to the next level. There seems to be some inconsistency.

**NME:** You are that senior cheerleader who is settling for a freshmen who happens to be starting on the varsity football team. More like the best of the worst but too soon tot ell.

**TDK:**   No comment.

**C9:**  The truest heartbreak since chaos and gorilla from your past relationship.  This one seemed horrible and just left you with low self esteem. You miss the days when confidence and performance was hai. Nothing will fill that void in your heart.  You remember when they could climb that ""korean solo ladder"" and pleasure you in ways like never before. Always confident, always faithful, that first true love serious relationship that eventually.. just wasn't work out. The love was there, the spark was there but it just wasn't quite good enough. Nothing will fill that void in your heart. So many memories of vitories and triumph, when life gives you lemons you conquer a nation, with a big set of balls you use your sneaky instincts to meteor down on anything that gets in the way of life. In the end though, when the romantic hai wears off, you come to reality and things just aren't so great. Nothing will fill that void in your heart.

Noun

Cheese is a food derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. During production, the milk is usually acidified, and adding the enzyme rennet causes coagulation. The solids are separated and pressed into final form. Some cheeses have molds on the rind or throughout. Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature.

He got fbd so early in the game and is playing Eve, a champ with no hard cc.

Sure she has damage, but Koggy mid was getting zoned by an azir who could probably 2 v 1 them and TSM made the call to 3 man both the bot lane and top lane turrets to effectively ""end"" the laning/gank phase where wards that spot out Eve are harder to come by and her early game damage with red buff is extremely high. 

Also they prioritized the top side of TSM's jungle where there is overall less presence, getting the red buff LATE by invading blue side blue jungle meaning by then the bottom tower was already gone and top already shoved.

Cho'gath - innate awesome double sustain with targons and passive. Aoe knock up and silence which is amazing for helping your jungler to stop the opponent from escaping during an escape. They may be hard to land but are perfect for follow up cc and delaying the enemy's cc/escape spell. Ult for free tanky health while you take hits for your team


Jax - AoE stun that dodges all auto attcks.  Free stats that scale into late game, if your game goes long enough you will eventually be another top laner hypercarry/split pusher. 


Jinx - Massive poke with W, max Snares first to block enemy paths.   Helps with early game DPS or snipes from far away (Ult scales regardless of damage built)


Karthus - Ultimate kill stealer + assists to get gold from all lanes. Think an even all-in 1 v 1? whenever karthus ults his lane buddies can go HAM in an even matchup and come out on top. Wall of pain creates massive slow, with rylais you can slow and damage after death.  in 2 v 2s in the bot lane, die first so you can dps for another 10 sec and win it.


Mordekaiser - can help the shove lane but more importantly, even with no cc you can shield your buddy and move faster, free MR/Armor and damage, ult someone to tell your team to focus them down so you get free ghost. Can also help jungler clear or 3-4 man a lane and proxy it


Sejuani - Massive CC massive bulk scales some with hp gain.  What's not to love? the crowd control power with another jungler? guarenteed follow up.


Tryndamere - Max mocking shout to win any adc trade, you can also use it when they are trying to last hit so they don't end up doing enough damage.  Q can heal for free even without fury and bait your enemies into focusing you cause you have ult. Has an escape unlike many supports, can go ap for mass heal.


Vi - Armor shred helps in lane, double cc, can harrass with aoe. Ultimate means free kill pretty much


Vladimir - resourceless and scales into late game regardless. Spell vamp op doesn't need alot of health to be annoying and tank for the team. Health = damage anyways. Damage amp for team is flat %

Santorin is severely underrated. 

Severely. 

He may not pull off the flashiest of plays or seen as a high pressure high priority jungle, but people always overlook the fact that TSM's playstyle revolves around Bjergsen carrying and gettin fed 90% of the time with a roaming annie/alistar support.

How could you get a hyper aggro top mechanical mid laner to lose lane when he has 2 people helping him with vision and pressure for the whole laning phase?

The jokes on him not ganking top aren't for him to be blamed. I guarentee you Santorin just follows orders and rarely (if even EVER) makes mistakes! In my eyes he is flawless and does what he is asked to. Nothing less, he will fit into the teams needs.

His popular Rek'sai pick uses the echo sense to the absolute MAX and is key to TSM's skrimishes and objectives fighting. He can peel, he can initiate, and is always forced into a tanky front liner.

Santorin is Challenger +500 LP, don't be ridiculous. 

Again it's like how it comes to certain champs/players who you won't find montages on. People will watch Vayne, Riven, Zed, Yasuo montages but how often do you see a Malzahar montage, or a Tryndamere montage, or a Garen?

You don't need flashy plays NOR do you need to be a carry-esque jungler. He is a ""support"" jungler and fufills all of TSMs needs. 

If you watch this entire summer lcs split you will find that if wildturtle is caught out (which is common) it means the Bjergsen is the ONLY damage on TSM's team other than a Rumble ultimate or reinitiation tele homeguard from Dyrus after a lost fight.

3187,"He can still close range assassin due to his self peel, the Q and pulling the spear out auto attack reset on the Q grants massive damage. The execute relies on using the heartseeker passive being moved. 

The spear steals ms, so you can gap close, if you are close enough you can save your stun for AFTER pulling the spear out and getting the extra auto. 

For example, when ganking a lane you want to land your Q, if you do you get a nice (mini chilling smite) on the opponent so you can gap close. When the initial follow up isn't enough you still have your stun.

Varus i believe was meant to be a low mobile high cc/utility adc who could shred tanks with the Blight stacks. That W though is highly out scaled and Varus is literally picked for his ultimate and poke potential. Not for his tank shredding.

If W were to be an exponential growth on damage output i could see runaans being viable, I think Riot just needs to give runaans another look. I think they gave Ashe a chance with it but turns out it wasn't good.

Comparing to Kalista, who is debatebly the only ADC where runaans is core, it's because she has her own kind of stacks that can stack and proc all of them with refresh! I think if Riot could rethink or implement a new mechanic runaans would be a neat pickup on Varus!

3240,"I think Yasuo is fine because he uses the longest type of ""samurai"" sword there is, by how he wields it too his style revolves around sweeping and slashing at the max range. The only time you see him double hand it is during his ultimate. 

Fizz's should be nerfed for both realistic and gameplay purposes that fuker already ignores unit collision and has stupidly high mobility.

Although Wukong doesn't hold the staff at the end, keep in mine it can extend but Wukong's fighting stance impores him to lean forward thus granting extra reach, normally this style costs the fighter a loss in balance but this is supplemented by the fact that he is a monkey with a tail. 

For a spear to be effective you actually can't hold it at its tip in a prolonged fight, Pantheon's style isn't a frontline pikeman who pokes at the enemies and stops their calvary, he is a ""spartan"" and thus to get full use of a spear's power without it breaking, and to use it one handed, you have to hold the spear closer to the middle which is why it can be clarified as less range. 

Similarly to the above, Darius does not always hold the axe by where a ""true"" handle is. The war axe he uses is fashioned to be held at the middle for balance and true power, he uses the edge to pull enemies in and during his Q spin (for obvious reasons) but i think he should remain in the 125 category, don't think of the big axe itself but where Darius HOLDS it.

I think tryn should get that attack range increase, even if it takes power from the rest of his kit. Hoping for him to be less toxic and auto reliant and more of a Barbarian War King from the north.

Yi i disagree with only because 1. yes hit kit means he doesn't need it but 2. visually Yi swipes with both hands, and this actually decreases range as when you move your sword to one side of your body, that sides arm cannot be fully extended losing out on range. 

Jayce and Garen is the same thing, two handed hammer, visually if he wielded it with one hand (you need super strength) then yes but because it is two handed the answer is no. Garen does run carrying it with one hand, but one would severely wreck their shoulder swiping a sword that big with one arm.

Lastly on Trundle as much as i want to agree, the club does not have a blade, for ""normal"" damage to come out from a realistic degree you need to hit the opponent as a ""sweet spot"" of the club to get any real meaning out of it.
