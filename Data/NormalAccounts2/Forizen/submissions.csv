The problem with Varian seems to be that his Tanky build is far too weak, TBOF is way too strong with Second Wind, Warbringer is a talent too strong for it's tier.

---------------------------

**Second Wind**

First of all, I believe it's the synergy between Second Wind and Twin Blades of Fury which makes it so powerful. Second Wind scales with 3 things. **Attack Speed** (as it's on-hit), **maximum health** (as it is a % of your maximum health) and lastly, 50% of your **attack damage** when you are low on health. 

Funnily enough, each one of things scalings change depending on the heroic you choose with Varian, so in comparison to his ""base form"" before choosing a heroic: 

* Twin Blades of Fury grants **100%** attack speed, effectively doubling the RATE of healing. However, due to a 25% attack damage loss, the rate of healing from basic attacks when below 50% health ignoring the passive 1% regen, is reduced by 25% (50% of basic attack damage minus 25% for TBOF)

* Taunt grants 50% more maximum health, BUT 25% less attack speed. So the AMOUNT of healing is increased by 50%, but the RATE of healing is reduced by 25%. 

* Colossus Smash grants 75% more attack damage, but 10% less health. So the AMOUNT of healing is decreased by 10%, the RATE of healing stays the same as attack speed has not been changed, BUT when below 50% health, your attacks are healing for 75% more (50% of damage dealt * 1.75). 

So how much healing does each build give?

-------------------------------------------------

**Stats At level 10**

**Attack Damage**

Base Varian Attack Damage: 123

TBOF Attack Damage: 92

Taunt Varian Attack Damage: 123

ColSMA Varian Attack Damage: 215

**Health Pool**

Base Varian Health Pool: 2889

TBOF Health Pool: 2889

Taunt Varian Health Pool: 4334

ColSMA Varian Health Pool: 2600

**Attack Speed**

Base Varian Attack Speed: 1.25

TBOF Varian Attack Speed: 2.5

Taunt Varian Attack Speed: 0.9375

ColSMA Varian Attack Speed: 1.25

-------------------------------------------

*note: Healing is 1.17% of maximum health on hit to be exact*

*note: Heroic Strike's bonus damage/healing listed below further*

Twin Blades of Fury + Second Wind = 84.52 Health per second (+ 115.05 When below 50% health  = 199.57 Healing Per Second) we can round that to 200. 

Taunt + Second Wind = 47.54 Health per second (+ 57.53 When below 50% health = 105.07 Healing Per Second) 

Colossus Smash + Second Wind = 38.03 Health per second (+134.23 When below 50% health = 172.26 Healing Per Second)

**SO**

When healthy (above 50% health), Twin Blades of Fury takes the lead by a strong 84.52 health per second, almost double Taunt's and more than double Colossus Smash. 

When not healthy (below 50% health), Colossus Smash actually gets the most healing at 134ish, due to the high attack damage, where Twin Blades of Fury is almost caught up at 115.05, and Taunt coming last in this regard at a small 57.53. 

HOWEVER.

These stats do not include Heroic Strike. As Second Wind clearly states, when below 50% health, also heal for 50% of the **damage dealt**. Heroic Strike counts as an empowered basic attack and thus the bonus damage will heal as well. With TBOF's fast attack speed, it should be no surprise that it grants an ADDITIONAL 82.28 healing (to the above number of 199.57) per second for a total of a rounded **282 healing per second**. For context, Uther's Q at level 10 heals for 623 health. So Varian pretty much gets a free Uther heal every 2.2 seconds. Yep. 

Colossus Smash's total of 172.26 + Heroic strike's 61.71 is a big **233.97.**

Taunt falls last with a total of 105.07 + 46.29 falls to **151.36**

For further context, Victory Rush which is available every 60 seconds (-15 per minion slain while on cooldown) is 582.4 healing... per ""minute"". BUT can be healed for that amount at full hp, regardless of the heroic chosen.

So we need to ask ourselves, yes Twin Blades of Fury is very strong with Second Wind, but SHOULD the other heroics grant ""just as much healing"" as Twin Blades of Fury?

If you think about it, TBOF gives up an active ability (vs Taunt and Colossus Smash). In addition, Colossus Smash grants the user a LOT of burst, and with the 25% vulnerability you TECHNICALLY heal more when hurt since you are doing more damage. But winrate numbers don't lie and I think Varian needs some tweaking.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

*each change will have a description as to why I think this would be a good change*

**The changes**

* **Live by the Sword** moved to level 1 - QUEST: Increase the duration of Parry by 20%. After parrying 50 auto attacks, Parry gains an extra charge. (Can only happen once) ~~If you block at least 2 Hero Basic Attacks with a single Parry, its cooldown is reduced by 3 seconds.~~

*Overpower has been moved as for a level 1 talent, that extra Heroic Strike isn't really ""gamebreaking"" in the laning phase. Live by the Sword is now a quest that grants an extra charge. This helps it synergize much better with Varian's weak tank build. Comboing Parry Talents and forcing the enemy to attack you with Taunt will make Varian a much better tank.*

* Warbringer - Charge now stuns the target for 1 second instead of slowing them, and its cooldown is reduced by 50% ~~10 seconds.~~

*Basically the cooldown is now 8 seconds with this talent instead of 6. 2 seconds is a considerable extra amount of time to get out, and or live, or risk Varian's staying on you.* 

* New Level 7 talent - Shalamayne's Battlecry - While Parry is active, enemy auto attacks heal you instead of dealing damage. 

*Built to rival the other healing talents in this category, this talent favors smart Parry users. With extra duration and charges from Live by the Sword, and forced attacks (and therefore healing) from Taunt, this would be an option for health restoration through defense.* 

* **Victory Rush** Every 60 seconds, Varian's next basic attack will heal him for **100% of the damage dealt** + 877 (416 + 4% per level) Health. When a nearby enemy minion **or mercenary** dies, the cooldown is reduced by 15 seconds. If a nearby hero dies, the cooldown is completely reduced. 

*A buff to Victory Rush, favoring Colossus Smash more due to the auto attack being included and the higher potential to kill someone. Second Wind will still be the long-fight sustain talent, Victory Rush however benefits from mercenaries dying so you can still tank merc camps, but also is thematic to the name where if an enemy hero falls in battle, the cooldown will be reduced. It's the ""rush"" you get from a victory, snowballing the fight with a big self heal if your team can manage to score a kill*

* **Second Wind** - Basic Attacks heal Varian for 1~~.17~~% of his maximum Health. While below 50% Health, they also heal him for ~~50%~~ 33% of the damage dealt. 

*A slight nerf to Second Wind overall. It's still the most healing for TBOF, and still the best for the other heroics in a long term sustain fight that lacks burst. It's also still the best for taking merc camps and soloing bosses, but this means Varian can't afk fight a boss, he will have to dodge stuns or maybe even cancel backswing animations.*

* **Taunt** Cooldown: 16 seconds - Force the target Hero to attack Varian for 1.25 seconds. **Passive: When you Parry a Hero's Basic Attack, Heroic Strike's cooldown is refreshed. Can only occur once per cast.** Passive: Maximum Health increased by 50%. Passive: Attack Speed reduced by 25%.

*Overpower talent has been moved to taunt since it has a pitiful 35% winrate. Varian needs help as a tank, and with the Taunt ability synergizing with overpower's refresh, it makes sense to add it here as a passive and give it to Tank Varian for free. It doesn't hurt the other builds because they always took High-King's Quest for more damage than heroic strike in the first place.*

* **Colossus Smash** - Cooldown: 20 seconds
Smash a target enemy, dealing 410 (195 + 4% per level) damage and making them **and Varian** Vulnerable for 3 seconds. Passive: Base Attack Damage increased by 75%. ~~Passive: Maximum Health reduced by 10%.~~

*A change to Colossus Smash making it a double edged sword. This will make Varian vulnerable too when he jumps in for his assassination burst, but helps him if he is caught out by removing the 10% health reduction.*

* **Mortal Strike** - Heroes hit by ~~Heroic Strike~~ basic attacks receive ~~40~~ 50% reduced healing for ~~4~~ 2 seconds.

*Heroic Strike has low up time with builds that DON'T include Twin Blades of Fury. The change to basic attacks means it is consistent, but to prevent you from stacking this on every single enemy you run into, the duration has been reduced. Healing reduction improved a bit to make it a little more attractive than Juggernaut*

-----------------------------------

**TL;DR**

* Post shows math on Second Wind. 

* Live by the sword moved to 1, and is quest for 1 additional charge after blocking 50 attacks. No more cooldown reduction. 

* Overpower moved to Taunt as passive

* New level 7 talent: Parrying auto attacks heal you for the same amount. (Tanky version to heal vs other healing talents) 

* Warbringer cd 6 --&gt; 8 second cooldown now

* Victory Rush heals for 100% of basic attack damage, cooldown reduced by mercs, refreshed by hero kills. 

* Second Wind healing nerfed a bit (1.17% --&gt; 1%, 50% damage dealt --&gt; 33%) 

* Taunt now has Overpower as a passive

* Colossus Smash no longer reduces health by 10%, but now makes both you and target vulnerable. 

* Mortal Strike now works off of basic attacks, 50% healing reduction, but lower duration. 

------------------------------------------

I'm looking for discussion over anything else. I think Varian's tank build is extremely weak right now and the changes above would REALLY strengthen them. TBOF build is slightly nerfed through Second Wind alone, while Colossus Smash has been tweaked to hurt you a little more if you fight stupidly, but save you more if you get caught out.

With most every other character in the game, point blank AoE moves are on the W key while more skill-shot based skills are on the E key.

Ragnaros however is switched, a target meteor that rolls forward is on W, and a Point blank AoE is on E

**Examples of Skill shot AoE abilities that fire in a line on E**

* Cho's Runic Bomb

* Zagara's Infested Drop

* Gul'dan's Corruption

**Examples of point blank AoE abilities on W**

* Cho's Consuming Blaze

* Johanna's Condemn 

* Dehaka's Dark Swarm

* Muradin's Thunderclap

* Rehgar's Lightning Shield

**However**

I'll also play devil's advocate and try to justify why it's okay, just personally i think more important to aim skill shots should be on E

* Gall's Dread Orb is on W, instead of E, but I think this is because E has to synergize with Runic Bomb and share the same key. 

* Arthas E - Though this is a toggle, so it may be important to turn it on and off quickly

* Alarak W - Not the same, but similar, a much harder move to use than lightning surge

**To Conclude**

I really think, because it's where our index finger sits, that E should have more ""skill shot based"" skill and W should remain with more utility or less thinking skills. I think things like Varian's W, Artanis's W, Tyrael's W, are more about timing than aiming, but there are still things like Kerrigan and Zeratul where that is not the case. Regardless, I know this is extremely minor for some people, but I personally would really like Ragnaros's E to be the meteor, and W to be the explosion.

So the question is,

Do you think it would be healthy and balanced if Gul'Dans corruption also had Vector Targetting? 

Things you could do 

* Fire it sideways/diagonal depending on the escape path of your opponents
* Have it start away from you and fire towards you for people pursuing you instead of running away
* Perfectly line it up in the path of someone who has just been feared by your heroic

* Upon collecting 20 regeneration globes, and attacking heroes 20 times, increase Uther's mana regeneration by a further .5 and increase his maximum mana by 100. 

------------------------------

Right now, Uther seems to me, to be in an okay spot. He is the burst healer, and anti burst Hero support. 

The problem is, he has to compete with healing that seems endless, both Auriel and Brightwing who are top 3 along with Malfurion have no mana to run out of. Malfurion on the other hand just seems overtuned.

Now looking at Uther, it's funny, because his Single-Target heal costs 30% more than Rehgars, and is only about 100 points stronger. This isn't including the other two heroes Rehgar heals with this same, cheaper AND shorter cooldown ability. 

But Uther has more healing because of healing wave, the problem is, it costs like double the mana!

I know I'm not the only one who has the constant voice of ""I need more mana"" in Uther's voice. 

Other than the fact that I think Uther could lean more towards a hybrid warrior role (just a little bit more, maybe tankiness and extra damage on his auto attacks) I think what would do wonders for Uther is to combine his mana talents at level 1.

Why?

Because we are all in a ""drought"" of regeneration globe quests where they were nerfed and people have trouble completing it until have 12 minutes. This is common for more dry battlegrounds as well like BoE. 

In the past, MANY talents have been made baseline or combined, similar to Varian's multi requirement quest, I think this would be a great candidate for Uther players:

If you can spare the time, I think this might be a good read.

Decided to write a rework and add new races to the game for funs.

TL;DR: 

Story is Time Patrollers are at civil war because interrupting the timeline (even saving it changed it because of involvement) caused the Gods from all universes to get angry and threaten destruction.

Every race is bound to a certain ""army"" in the civil war, eventually post-game is the war on the gods. 

* **Earthlings** ""perfect"" techniques and add additional strikes to strike supers, ki supers can be customized (Choose kamehameha, bend it, kame it, burst it, kaioken pack it, you name it.) Can Kaioken, Nimbus, Unlock Potential and absorb spirit bomb. (Mentors include 

* **Androids** generate ki passively, absorb ki from attacks, can perfect guard until damaged, less damage from melee attacks. Can absorb androids or fuse to achieve more perfect forms. 

* **Demons** are heavily offensive, attack grows as they take damage, can breathe fire, realm jump, use sword techniques from janemba and dabura, Gets stronger from slaying foes, transform into more demonic forms like Demigra (kind of like zarbon, who is an alien though), or transform like Janemba. 

* **Frieza Race** Born warriors from King Cold (who was a mutation apparently). Further kin means more power. Very fast, powerful transformations, additional strikes and balance with tails, one free ki ultimate per match. 5th (Cooler) transformation grants height, muscle, armor, or you can golden form with enhanced ki abilities and speed. 

* **Majins** still heavily defensive, can regenerate upon death, can customize stretchy punches, inflated kicks into your combos for less dense, but more range/area attacks. Can transform into a taller, muscular super buu version of yourself through turning enemies into candy then eating it. Eating candy afterwards gains the enemy's clothes and copies some of their moves.

* **Namekians** High health, Great stamina regeneration, heal over time and has unique regeneration move, items are more effective. Can stretch punch and ki attacks ignore guard. Transformations include fusing with a chosen elder, or giant form. 

* **Saiyans** Almost extinct warrior race that is being adopted by earth/space. High attack, low health. Stronger with every defeat in battle. SSJ12 and SV12 transformations now generate ki instead of lower it. Favors strike or ki depending on what you pick. Both can SSJ3 which enhances stats greatly but drains ki really fast then leaves you exhausted. Can also Power Biased (muscular trunks, muscular vegeta)/Legendary Super Saiyan transform for bulk and power, but very slow in speed and no blocking.

------------------------------------------------------------

The Gods and Immortals among us are not happy. 

Even when we thought we were repairing the timeline, our interference has caused rifts in every part of the different universes. 

With the threat of destruction upon Toki Toki city, the Time Patrollers wrought out a civil war, where many died, and the sanctuary once meant to maintain peace is now the battlegrounds for those who remain.

Unusual and uneasy alliances have been formed, and you will pick a side. While we war with each other, over the years it seems we have forgotten the real threats.. the Gods. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

In Xenoverse 3, you will start out by picking your Race from a set of ""New Origin"" classifications. 

Each New Origin has different races that have come together to fight the war, choose wisely, as each New Origin restricts you to certain classes and a certain story and campaign mode that will test you and put you to battle with the other New Origin factions. The threat of the Gods still looms over time and the universe itself, through training, combat, and warping through time and space it's up to you to save... everything.

-------------------------------------

**The New Origins**

Earth

* Earthlings
* Saiyans
* Androids

The Demon Realm

------------------------------------------------------------

**Earthlings** - The original race of Earth, Earthlings have mastered old techniques and fighting styles and are responsible for many of the abilities that are used among everyone today. This includes the infamous, Kamehameha technique. Because of this, they have perfected many skills other races haven't, granting them considerable bonuses when pulling the technique off.

Androids are perfect in form, show no emotion in battle, and are analytic in their approach and combat. With permanent ki generation, ki absorption abilities, and combat analyzing to improve performance, Androids are very dangerous as they learn from battle and become better and better. Heroes include Reformed #16, 17, 18, Cell, Dr. Gero, Super Android 13, and in some people's opinions even Mira. 

* Through Absorption or Upgrades: Perfect Form, Super Android

---------------------------------------------------------

**Demons** - Hailing from the Demon World, Dabura, Towa, and Demigra have opening up a portal into our world unleashing hell upon the universe. Through demonic might, trickery, and the power of darkness, demons bring hatred from thousands of years in a burning jail. Through it, they thrive with rage and in battle. Heroes include Dabura, Towa, Demigra, and Zanemba

* Transformations include: True Demon Form, Reborn Form

* Super Saiyan 3 can only be used at maximum ki, then drains it fast when transforming (5 ki bars = 25 seconds) . During this time, ki supers and ultimates are free and you have massively increased power. When the ki runs out, time runs out and you revert to your normal form and are overheated, exhausted, and take extra damage for a short duration. 

* Super Trunks (Very much like and replacing the A Power Biased Transformation Z-soul) is [the form Trunks used when taking on Cell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhN0z2t4Zm0) This form is very similar to Broly's Legendary Super Saiyan. Takes longer to transform, seals your guard, lowers your speed, but increases your attack damage by a large amount, reduces the damage you take by a large amount, and you won't flinch at the first attacks of a combination. Your ki generates passively and can overflow. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example of Earthling Customization:**

Access to Wolf Fang Fist, Justice Combination 1 and 2, Custom Justice Combination, Tri-beams

Access to Sword and Power Pole (Ki does not regenerate, more stamina used when using weapon)

**Example of Demon Customization:**

Access to unique Fire Breathing techniques that can reduce healing, leave an area dangerous, burn away armor over time

Access to realm jumping which is very similar to vanishing but can go through walls and boundaries, dodge attacks and appear at awkward angled locations

Choose your Sword, you can equip or unequip it for battle and customize it. 
Not using a sword generates Ki, Using a sword depletes additional stamina

Different armor pieces and spikes can

* Increase attack damage
* Increase or decrease damage taken
* Influence speed
* Deal damage with spiky armor when guarding against attackers
* Increased benefits that break off when brought to certain health level

**Example of Majin Customization**

Dissect each and every one of your punches and kicks, and increase the size, or range of them. 

* More range = less speed
* More area = less damage

Different candy attacks hit differently. Some are evasive moves, some are supers. Some can be thin beams, large beam, hits the immediate area at an arc in front of you, hits above and below you, etc. Candy beam doesn't actually do damage, candy enemy can still move and dodge at fixed speed.  

Choose the color of the candy beam and candy eaten

Red restores health

Yellow restores ki

Green restores stamina

4th successful candy beam will turn enemy into rainbow candy, if you can catch it and eat it, turn into a ""super buu"" version of yourself. 

Super Buu's candy beam turns them into cookies or chocolate and steals their clothes. Cookies steal a super, chocolate steals and ultimate.

**Example of Namekian Customizations**

Can lock onto allies

Access to Healing moves and ki blasts and other ""support"" moves

Healing ____

* Beam - Accurate, quick, spastic small heals
* Ray - Short range, area big heal (like new tri beam)
* Wave - Heal over time, but less, covers an area

Ki blast attacks deal extra damage to guarding enemies 

Can choose which attacks will stretch, which will not

Can carry more items

**Example of Saiyan Customizations**

9,000 hair styles to choose from including contribution from the Steam Workshop. How this works (it is a live ""mod"" for other games like Warframe). Fans can design their own hairstyles and submit them to the Steam Workshop. The top picks are implemented into the game.

Saiyans can freely choose to pump additional Ki into any of their Supers and Ultimates when using, increasing the damage and number of hits. 

Saiyans can also by default, make super and ultimates during customization, to cost more ki or even stamina for a wide variety of effects. 

* Homing 
* Extra Flinch
* Less/more hits
* Target enemy's stamina or ki instead of health
* Increase the area and range of an ability

Saiyans can also combine moves like Final Kamehameha, Big Bang Kamehameha, Galick Beam Cannon

Saiyans can use an ""Ancestral"" attack, which will allow you to pick your family tree and what technique would be used by you and a spirit version of your parent who joins in on the attack. This attack can only be used when both players are on their last bar of health, it forces a Ki Blast Clash between both players. The Saiyan has a significant advantage, but doesn't always win. Winner of a clash is determined by: Rapid but specific key inputs, rapid but specific COMBINATION of ki inputs, and who has the most ki in the tank.

I've been spamming Varian on the PTR today, can't say I've gotten in more than 25 games so far but my first impression is that some talents to me, just seem too weak compared to others in their tier.

Other big turn offs are very situational talents that require very particular circumstances to occur to take full advantage of the talent, which isn't an option in a lot of battlefields. 

Anyways, enough chit chat, please just let me know what you think in the comment section below if these changes were to happen.

Thanks!

-----------------------------------------------------

**New Level 4 Talent - Prey of the Pride**

Lion Maw deals 200% damage to minions and mercenaries and refreshes Heroic Strike's cooldown if it hits at least one enemy hero AND a minion or mercenary.  

*Varian only has two talents at level 4 which is.. well unique. Not there is something wrong with that, however I also noticed Lion's Maw only has ONE talent at level 1. Since Varian relies on auto attacks and has no sense of cleave, he lacks power against clearing waves, but is very powerful against things like bosses. That being said, this talent helps wave clear, but also rewards Varian in lane for trading damage if fighting in a minion wave. It's also useful in skirmishes contesting over a mercenary camp.*

**Victory Rush**

Every 60 seconds, Varian's next first Basic Attack against an enemy will heal him for 877 (416 + 4% per level) Health. When a nearby enemy minion **or hero** dies, the cooldown is reduced by 15 seconds, and **60 seconds for a hero.**

*Victory Rush is good, don't get me wrong. But it's highly outclassed by Second Wind. Even when NOT opting for Twin Blades of Fury, Second Wind has better overall healing by a LARGE margin. One can argue that because it is burst healing it is stronger, but my biggest problem is that you can't rely on minions being nearby to die and reduce the cooldown. This means it is only really useful when fighting an enemy team in a minion wave, and hoping that wave isn't completely nuked so you can can an extra charge out of this. This talent as of now, seems to just be for one heal per fight (which is useless if you initiate and waste, you will have to take poke first) or for lane sustain without a healer. This change makes it useful in team fights, by a small margin, if you kill a hero, snowball your lead and heal.*

**Juggernaut**

Charge deals bonus damage to Heroes equal to 6% of their maximum Health and **reduces the duration of Stuns, Roots, and Slows are reduced by 25% for 3 seconds.**

*This talent has to compete with Shattering Throw and Mortal Strike which honestly, will still be picked even with this buff. This gives Varian some resistance to crowd control on top of the tank chipping power.*

**Taunt**

40 Mana Cooldown: 25 seconds

Force ~~the target Hero~~ all enemy heroes next to Varian, to attack him for 1.25 seconds.

Passive: Maximum Health increased by 50%.
Passive: Attack Speed reduced by 25%.

*Taunt seems underwhelming for many. Sure, a range increase would be nice, but a point click ""stun"" that lets the enemy auto attack doesn't seem to have a lot of gameplay. Compared to another Warrior/Tank like ETC, I think keeping taunts really small range, but making it AoE would be good. It would be much smaller than Mosh Pit, but would be an AMAZING peeling tool when melees and tanks on the enemy team try and stack and dogpile your back line.*

**Colossus Smash**

40 Mana Cooldown: 20 seconds

Smash a target enemy, dealing 410 (195 + 4% per level) damage and making them **and Varian** Vulnerable for 3 seconds.

Passive: Base Attack Damage increased by 75%.

~~Passive: Maximum Health reduced by 10%.~~

*The general consensus to those I've talked to seems to be that Colossus Smash is indeed the strongest talent. However it punishes Varian if he gets caught out, very hard, because it does not help him escape and he dies 10% faster. I think being ""reckless"" and ironically a double-edged sword on Colossus Smash would actually be very interesting. Vulnerable temporarily, vs a permanent 10% loss in maximum health*",heroesofthestorm,My list of hopeful Varian changes before his release,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5bxwry/my_list_of_hopeful_varian_changes_before_his/

Stealth

* Abilities that reveal Stealthed/Cloaked Heroes will no longer remove the Stealth/Cloak effect, but will instead temporarily reveal the cloaked Hero.

Basically, reveals like Tassadar's Oracle no longer remove the benefits Samuro has when stealthed. It reveals him, but he maintains the speed buff and bonus damage from being stealthed after the reveal wears off instead of having to refresh it with Windwalk.

Samuro is still at a massive **63% winrate** with a **97% pick/ban in GRANDMASTER**, and EVERYWHERE.

**in fuck hasn't he been nerfed on the PTR yet either?**

The **PTR is supposed to dictate what changes will most likely come next week** and Samuro has run rampant for so long?

Why is Blizzard **working on other hero changes** who shouldn't be a **priority** this is ridiculous.

**Quick Match** has been butchered for far too long and JUST when I was falling unconditionally in love with Blizzard they pull shit like Samuro.

See you when he gets nerfed next year I guess, I'm out.

Other than the thousands of color blind implications involved in the skin, changing forms during a match gives Lux a ""mechanic"" she isn't supposed to have.

When the match is starting you look at the enemy team, you are aware of who is in your lane, who might gank, and who is laning in the other lanes that you may face in objectives.

They are champions to look out for.

A lot of our mind uses the size, model, and importantly, color to distinguish who it is coming out of that brush.

Our reactions are FASTER when we relate them in a match to a certain color or shape, much faster than exploring the details that make up a champion's look.

With the ability to change colors and textures at will, I'm scared that you might think the dark purple lux coming out of the brush looks too much like a leblanc or a fiora, where as a whitish lux might throw you off as a janna and so on and so forth.

I think the skin is cool, amazing, I'm bothered a bit by the theme because how can an earth fairy fire lazers but whatever.

* Reaper's two guns now fire independently on left click and right click. Even together! but then the next is delayed by an equal amount. Higher risk, higher reward!

* Let Soldier 76 put his healing thing ON someone like a sticky bomb, but healing so they can heal people around them while moving.

* Have the option of Bastion in sentry mode to take away his armor, and turn it into a mini reinhardt shield like in beta in front of him. Disadvantage is he wont have armor for reduced damage, advantage is the shield will independently tank for him so he doesn't lose actual health.

With the introduction of the Overwatch universe to our happy Blizzard family, and thus, Heroes of the Storm, we all know that eventually each of these heroes will join the nexus.

That is, hopefully, if this game stays alive, which I sincerely hope it will.

We already have 3 characters from Overwatch. Unique heroes Tracer and Zarya who fit their themes and carry over the ""proper"" abilities, then we have Nova, who, a lot of people agree AND disagree with.

They are both snipers, yes, but unfortunately the iconic grappling hook, widow mine, and infrared site are gone.

It also means we won't see an actual perching Widowmaker in the game unless the skin changes to say, a Talon operative Nova skin. 

---------------------------------

Now I was thinking, if Soldier 76 were in the game he would need:

* Movement speed boost

* Auto attack/assault rifle like attacks

* A heal

* helix rocket

* Tactical visor

When it comes to Raynor's kit, I could see some real similarities.

* Both are auto attack reliant, with an assault rifle

* Both have a movement speed boost in the form of Inspire (i guess mounting counts as Sprinting too)

* Both have a heal - Adrenaline Rush on Raynor

Now there are distinct differences, and it scares me because the differences do not overshadow those of Nova/Widowmaker, and thus increases my fear of them being the same hero. 

Shotgun Blast could easily be a helix rocket, or simply an augmented pulse rifle of s76s

Tactical Visor could be removed I guess,

and then Raynor has some starcraft ships in his heroics. 

------------------------------------------------

If S76 was his own hero, 

* I think maybe having a quick-mount Sprint instead of actually mounting could work, similar to Ghost Wolf.

* He could put down an AoE heal like Healing Ward, but maybe more dense, not destroyable?

* Helix Rocket would be a normal skill shot nuke

* Tactical Visor could be his trait, where auto attacks can't be blocked or miss? 

I honestly don't have any idea for any heroics. If he isn't running solo I guess he could run a tactical squad. My other idea is a heroic like lucian or like Gall's Shadowbolt Volley, except replace it with bullet and rockets so S76 can stay on the move while shooting.

Namekians got overnerfed, Majins aren't popular due to their weaknesses, and I have no clue about Earthlings using the Nimbus Power Pole mode without the specific Super Armor Super Soul. 

**Super Saiyan 3 currently takes 91 attacks to generate a single bar of ki** THIS SHOULD CHANGE.

You can skip down to **The Changes** below which is what I would patch into the game if I could.

First of all, I want to mention that there are 2 ""perks"" that come with going Super Saiyan outside of simple number changes, which distinguishes it from all other transformations including Unlock Potential.

* ""blink/instant transmission"" at the beginning of a combo (when at medium range)

* ""blink/instant transmission"" after the firing of a Charge Super (like Kamehameha, or Galick Gun)

However, comparatively, SSJ and SSJ3 for example have reduced Ki Regeneration through the standard form of Basic Attacks. 

[This chart](http://imgur.com/a/6rYzn) by /u/zkDredrick who has done the initial research we are all hoping for, since it's not specific in these games, shows what transformations do state wise. 

-------------------------

Now there has been a lot of arguments as to which is the best transformation.

Although Unlock Potential seems to be the general king, it does not have the 2 blink perks that SSJ forms to mentioned above, which to me can be a real game changer. 

It does however not have the immense reduced Ki Regeneration through basic attacks. 

* Base Form - 9 hits of basic attacks for 1 bar of Ki

* SSJ - 21 hits of basic attacks for 1 bar of ki

* SSJ - 91 hits of basic attacks for 1 bar of ki.

So you might ask yourself, why would I want to have to dish out 10x the amount of basic attacks just to generate the same amount of Ki for 10-20% damage and damage reduction? 

The improved stat is very strong, but is 1/10th the ki a good tradeoff? is SSJ3 bad?!

It's important to mention that Maximum Charge is a way to ""bypass"" this, or even turning off the form to generate Ki, then transforming for a super, however simply in my opinion (you are free to disagree) in a competitive environment I never find myself the time to charge Ki reliably through Maximum Charge, meaning basic attacks are the way to go. 

That being said, I think the transformations could use adjustments and I think some of my ideas will alleviate any confusion or debate as to what form is best and why things may seem ""horrible"".

The biggest change is to Super Saiyan 3, which was stated by Goku ""It drains a massive amount of Ki, instead of generating it"".

Basically, the other super saiyan forms gave the user massive amounts of ki, say, ""automatically"" charging it, while Super Saiyan 3 did the opposite and drained it.

Because of this, I wanted to stick to the theme and scale the power. 

**Super Saiyan 3 currently takes 91 attacks to generate a single bar of ki** THIS SHOULD CHANGE.

I really don't want to resort to Unlock Potential for all our builds.

-------------------------------------------------------

**The Changes** 

**Golden Form (Ultimate Evolution)**

* Frieza Race Exclusive

* Damage bonus to Ki Attacks: 100% --&gt; 130%

* NEW: Standard Ki Blasts fire, and charge twice as fast.

**Cooler Form (Super Evolution)**

* Frieza Race Exclusive - New form, makes you big, tall, armored like Cooler (not an issue in game as selecting your appearance effects your model hit boxes, speed, and damage like-wise, simply a scaling change so definitely possible and easily implemented)

* Stamina regeneration increased by 50%

---------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------

*note, all current forms of SSJ have the blink into combos and charge supers. This will remain unchanged*

**Base Form | Super Saiyan | Super Saiyan 2**

* Ki passively generates at 5 | 10 per second

* Ki required to activate 300 | 400

**Base Form | Super Saiyan 3**

* Ki and Stamina do NOT regenerate in this form from Basic Attacks or Resting. (You can turn off the form but will be tired for a moment)

* Damage on all Supers and Ultimates: 100% --&gt; 150%

* Damage on all Basic Attacks: 100% --&gt; 125%

* Damage Reduction vs all damage: 100% --&gt; 80%

* Cost of Stamina Vanish: 2 bars --&gt; 1 bar

* Cost of Supers and Ultimates +1 additional bar of Ki

* Ki is drained at 20 per second (100 is one full bar of ki)

-------------------------------------------------------------

**Conclusion**

To be honest I haven't played around with Namekians, Majins, or Earthlings hence why they aren't included even if they do need changes. Namekians got overnerfed, Majins aren't popular due to their weaknesses, and I have no clue about Earthlings using the Nimbus Power Pole mode without the specific Super Armor Super Soul. 

**MY GOAL** was to make all transformations viable with tradeoffs. 

Unfortunately, Golden Form favors ki blast users, and not strike ones. One shouldn't automatically opt for a Ki based build just because you are Frieza race character. Thus the introduction of the Cooler Form, a transformation Frieza never accomplished outside of certain games. 

Thematically, **Super Saiyan 2** is a literal upgrade from Super Saiyan 1 as it is ""perfecting"" the form with minor trade offs, though it's harder to reach the 400 ki to activate. 

Thematically, **Super Saiyan 3** is a very hard to use transformation that takes a MASSIVE toll on one's body and ki consumption is increased at a massive rate. **It was stated that Super Saiyan increases your ki generation, while Super Saiyan 3 did the opposite and drained it** Because of this, the change to Super Saiyan 3 is meant to be a ""temporary"" one as you cannot regenerate ki and stamina with it. During battle you will want to use it as an important power spike in a match and turn it off to ""rest"" while still being able to use the other Super Saiyan transformations. It's for more opportune moments and wouldn't be used every match. Super Saiyan 3 has a massive 50% boost to your supers and ultimates, but make them cost one additional bar. Keep in mind you cannot regenerate Ki and Stamina in this form..Vanishing however costs 1 less bar of Stamina. 

Lastly, Unlocked Potential has a distinct advantage over Super Saiyan 2. It has 15% damage reduction all around (instead of specific) and 20% damage increase all around (again, instead of being specific to SSJ2 or SSV2). The reason you would use SSJ2 over Unlocked Potential is for less stats, but minor ki regeneration and blinks

**TL;DR The major changes are:**

* Golden Form fires basic ki blasts faster and at a higher rate

* New Cooler form for more melee-preferred Frieza Race characters increases physical attacks and has increased stamina regeneration

* Unlocked Potential buffed in general for all races

* SSJ forms no longer have reduced ki regeneration via basic attacks and generate a small amount passively

* SSJ 1 and 2 and SV 1 and 2 have scaling adjusted and are mirrors when it comes to ki vs strike supers

* SSJ3 is unique and is meant to be a temporary form that consumes a massive amount of ki. Is brought much more inline thematically to where it is supposed to drain ki instead of generate it like the lower forms. Supers do 50% more damage, cost one more bar. Stamina vanish costs 1 bar. Ki and Stamina do NOT regenerate in this form.

I actually have no fucking clue what an open letter is.

All i know is i was bronze 4 with a whopping 37% winrate in all my matches and that all changed when the blademasters attacked

With my highly skilled mechanics in the form of navigating my bladestorm, to almost no down time to two additional blademasters that in total equal a literal other samuro in stats (100% of the damage and 100% if the health split in two) i can now right click enemies for 200% hero damage, critically strike 6 times in a row, have two fake mes tank 100% of the damage i was supposed to, and they have a life span of 18 seconds on an 18 second cooldown!

I can also blink away with mount-speed+25% more from cutting fools and my invisibility wont break!!

I am now at a 60% winrate and feel that i was always good at this game i just needed my main to come out.

Now i can show all my friends that i am a pro and belong in grabdmaser because my auto attacks now hit as hard as theirs!!

**Mount - From the Shadows**

When Diablo enters a brush or is out of combat for 1.5 second, he will begin to stride on all fours, gaining movement speed up to 30% over 3 seconds or instantly whenever he enters brush. Taking damage, attacking, or casting an ability dismounts Diablo and rapidly decays his movement speed over 1 second. *Casting Apocalypse will not dismount Diablo*

**Explanation for changes:** Other than the embarrassing fact that it takes diablo three entire seconds to get on all fours just like my wife, this makes Diablo a scarier rampant ganking force, similar to Ghost Wolf from Rehgar, but delayed and ramping up. 

**Trait - Black Soulstone**

Gain 10 Souls per Hero killed, or 1 per Minion, **5 per Mercenary**. For each Soul, gain .20% maximum Health. Upon dying, **you can optionally spend your current souls to reduce your death timer at 3 souls per 1 second (maximum 100 souls for 33 seconds).**

----------------------------------------------------

**Q - Shadow Charge**

60 Mana Cooldown: 12 seconds

Charge an enemy, knocking them back, dealing 206 (98 + 4% per level) damage, and then stunning them for **1 second**. If the enemy collides with terrain, **the damage and stun are dealt again.**

**Explanation for changes:** The stun increased from 0.5 seconds to 1, and if they hit terrain it's 2 seconds and the damage is dealt again. My basic justification is because of the ""nerf/removal"" where Diablo wouldn't dash towards his knocked back target for a guaranteed Overpower. If the Shadow Charged enemy has any higher movement speed than Diablo at the time, they can run away from Overpower. Also, ETC has an aoe dash stun for 1.25 seconds... Diablo's is single target only. Same cooldown. Goes to show how weak Shadow Charge is currently. 

---------------------------------------------------------

**W - Fire Stomp**

40 Mana Cooldown: 6 seconds

Stomp on the ground dealing 233 (111 + 4% per level) damage in the immediate area around you, then unleashes fire waves in ~~all~~ **7 directions** (it is currently 8, just clarifying) that deal 233 (111 + 4% per level) damage each. 

**Explanation:** Essentially guaranteed damage at melee range to kill minions since it currently can weave between them. Also to hit enemies in melee range, then damage again from the fire waves. One less fire wave because there are 7 ""evils"" and 7 deadly sins so it's thematic and a slight compensation nerf. 

---------------------------------------------------------

**E - Overpower**

60 Mana Cooldown: 12 seconds

Grabs the target and slams it behind Diablo, dealing 160 (76 + 4% per level) damage and stunning for 0.25 seconds. **Now has vector aim option, default cast will work like current live version**

**Explanation: You can aim this like Alarak's Telekinesis. I think if you want, you'd have the option to disable this. Basically this let's you Overpower a target and throw them wherever you want, instead of always behind you so you can throw people in your allies spells in stuff or line up a terrain shot.

-------------------------------------------------------------

**R - Heroics**

* Apocalypse/Lightning Breath cooldown: 66 seconds

* Apocalypse will no longer dismont you

* Lightning Breath has a faster tick rate and will now burn enemies causing them to still take damage for 0.5 seconds after leaving the area. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

**Level 1 Talents - Black Soulstone Talents**

* QUEST: Permanent Keeper All souls are lost upon death. Upon reaching 100 souls without dying, Black Soul Stone's health bonus is permanent regardless of souls spent for Resurrection. 

* Ripe Souls Regeneration Globes grant 6 souls. Increases the amount of Health gained from Black Soulstone by 66%.

* Power of the Black Abyss Souls no longer grant health but can be exchanged to resurrect at a 1 soul for 1 second ratio. 

**Level 4 Talents - Basic Ability Talents**

* Overwhelming Force - Increases the range and knockback of Shadow Charge by 25%.

* Fire Devil - Fire Stomp also surrounds you in flames that deal 23 damage every second for 6 seconds.

* Demonic Strength - Overpower destroys and prevents shields for 3 seconds. Once Overpower's stun expires, the target is slowed by 25% for 2 seconds.

**Level 7 Talents - Generic Utility Talents**

* Diabolical Momentum - Basic Attacks reduce your Ability cooldowns by 0.66 seconds.

* Prime Greed - All heroes near Diablo have their healing reduced by 10% and are given to Diablo instead. 

* Demonic Repair - Activate to heal yourself for 1% maximum health for every 3 souls over 6 seconds.  

* Juggernaut - Being mounted and Shadow Charge reduces the duration of silences, stuns, slows, and roots against you by 50% for 6 seconds.

**Level 13 Talents - Generic Defensive Talents**

* Armored Demonhide - Activate - For 3 seconds, basic attacks against Diablo deal 50% less damage. 20 second cooldown.

* Dark Demonhide - Activate - For 3 seconds, abilities against Diablo deal 50% less damage. 30 second cooldown. 

* Thorned Demonhide - Passive - Basic attacks and abilities against Diablo deal 15% of the damage back to the attacker. 

**Level 16 Talents - Offense or Defense Talents**

* Rampaging Storm - Fire Stomp mounts Diablo and fire waves now return to you dealing damage again. 

* Domination - Overpower can store 2 charges and reduces the cooldown of Shadow Charge by 10 seconds.

* Fear Master - Activate to cause Diablo to fear all nearby enemies for 1 second. 30 second cooldown. 

* Imposing Presence - Heroes that attack you have their Attack Speed slowed by 20% for 2.5 seconds. Activate to Slow the Attack Speed of nearby Heroes and Summons by 50% and Slow their Movement Speed by 20% for 2.5 seconds.

**Level 20 Talents**

**Hellstorm** - Lightning Breath lasts and reaches 50% longer.  

**Diablo's Return** - Apocalypse is cast for free when you die and respawn. 

**Spectral Leech** - Basic Attacks against enemy Heroes deal bonus damage equal to 5% of the Hero's maximum Health and heal you for the same amount.

**Lord of Terror** - Activate to steal 10% of the maximum Health of nearby enemy Heroes.

**Prime Evil** - Diablo becomes the prime evil, changing her form to one that has 25% increased size, attack range, damage reduction, and a 10% movement speed bonus. Diablo's basic attacks cleave an area in front of her and execute targets below 8% health.

To put it kindly, we ALL said that Pokemon Go's success completely relied on how well the updates were and... I feel like they had one job and failed at it despite how great of a launch it was.

I feel like other companies would not take the resources for granted.

This fact aside, my real problem with Samuro is that he has **no downtime to anything**

* He is resourceless

* He can use windwalk and engage, to have wind walk up again when he needs to escape

* He can cleanse himself with Mirror Images wasting many enemy abilities including ultimates

* Windwalk allows him to move at mount speed, and his passive allows him to run only 5% slower than mount speed

Samuro is far too slippery for the damage he can output. Sure he doesn't have sustain, and sure he doesn't bring any actual crowd control to the team but his images and windwalk make it so i wouldn't be surprised if he technically tanked more than most warriors in this game when it comes to soaking damage. 

**The changes**

I can't put my finger on what needs to be changed on him, but for starters his windwalk needs to have a real, reliable down time to play around, and the non-breaking from stealth for 1 second needs to be tied to a talent. 

I think mirror images should keep some damage but i disagree in part because it contradicts the original Blademaster. 

Lastly, I think the best thing to do is either remove his passive criticals, or the active component, and tie that to a talent as well to help delay his power and also make it so he has to choose it over something else.

* Dealing damage to non-players (like like Torbjorn's turrets or Symmetra's teleporter), no longer charges ultimate abilities

Now, there is a much smaller incentive to constantly snipe that turret from far away for a safer engage for your allies. You are essentially almost wasting your time shooting it now as it has minimal down time. You'll be better off trying to shoot an actual enemy. Torb's hammer just got a speed buff so there is even LESS down time. No point in shooting them turrets. It's a waste of time.

Jokes aside there are probably a lot of people who play him he's just fell out of the meta a bit despite an okay win rate.

I feel like a lot of the clunkiness was removed from Greymane luckily and he feels really smooth to play morphing between forms. 

However I feel like after the cocktail nerfs he was simply forgotten about.

Unfortunately there just seems to be some missing factors from his kit that I think would round him out very well.

I like the Cocktail build that is somewhat hard to land but feel his Worgen form is just too much weaker as a melee. I think these mentioned buffs would do wonders for Greymain without throwing him over the edge. 

Let me know what you think!

------------------------------------------

**Level 4 Talents**

* **Eyes in the Dark** Disengage grants Stealth for 4 seconds. **New: Damage will not break stealth for 1 second.**

This is pretty much the Samuro treatment which I think was well though out. Though this talent is good, an auto attack in mid flight or damage from other sources just break the stealth too soon for it to matter as often as it should. 

* **Insatiable** - Inner Beast causes Basic Attacks to restore ~~10 Mana, up to 140.~~ **New 20% of the damage dealt in health. This is doubled in Worgen Form.**

This talent is weaker than Tyrael's never picked Vigorous Strikes, however is stronger when used in Worgen Form. I think an optional form of sustain is very thematic to a worgen, and you would really have to chosoe wisely/sacrifice Block charges, a stealthed disengage, or increased explosion length on the cocktail to pick up this talent. However when the healers aren't always reliant, this could be really useful. 

**Level 7 Talent**

* **Wizened Duelist** - Hero takedowns increase Basic Attack damage by ~~3%~~ **2.5%, to a maximum of 25%. New** ~~This bonus is lost on death.~~

It's very very rare for anyone to never die in a match and concurrently make use of this. Teams know that if you pick up this talent, to just focus down the Greymane. Same goes for Medivh, Kael'thas, and Butcher when they are stacking. However, although they lose temporary stacks on death, upon successfully completing the quest they keep the bonuses PERMANENTLY. I think Greymane needs this bad as no talent at this level helps his Worgen form in the slightest. 

**Level 13 Talent** 

* **Running Wild** - Increases Darkflight and Disengage's range by 35%. **New** Darkflight can be used on Allies.

Very similar but a level 13 later talent to Illidan's Friend or Foe talent which does wonders for him. Again, I think this is a fair  change that allows a Worgen to be slippery too and not just the human form and they share the same ability slot. 

-----------------------------------------------------------

All in all, these are some pretty neat buffs to Greymane but I sincerely doubt any of them will warrant a dangerous winrate increase.

In fact, the suggestions to these talents are good and may have them be picked up more, but are still heavily rivaled by other talents in their own respective tiers to where they aren't must haves. 

Please let me know what you think about these changes!

These problems are similar to what Artanis has. No escape, having to stay in a fight to stay alive.

The fact of the matter is, massive healing (which is permanent health) &gt; temporary shields that only exist at below 50% health.

I know you can't really compare their kits but when it comes down to numbers the fact of the matter is, Artanis just comes out weaker.

There are a few concerns however when it comes to talent diversity and ""clunkiness"" that I think should be addressed.

Since Diablo isn't top tier, I think more diversity would be interesting over just the fire stomp build (which funnily enough is so unreliable of an ability.)

**Idea of changes**

[Fire Stomp: Now spreads in a full AOE area, instead of random streak of fire:](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMf4NFK8Tig&amp;t=0m44s) 

This is quite a ""buff"" but it removes the awkward randomness of if this ability does damage or not. One may argue that enemy players that ""dodge"" them can avoid the damage, but Diablo actually has no way of manually aiming these reliably. 

Whether it's clearing minion waves or actually trying to damage a foe, a reliable means of this ability I think should be more appropriate even if the damage is slightly nerfed in turn. 


-----------------------------------------------

Level 1: 

* Devil's Due ~~Reduces Black Soulstone's resurrection cost to 60 Souls.~~ --&gt; When Diablo is slain his respawn time is reduced by the number of souls he has and they are consumed. 

* ~~Block~~ --&gt; Demonhide - Using a basic ability grants a charge of block, reducing the damage of the next basic attack against diablo by 75%. 

* Overwhelming Force combined with From the Shadows --&gt; Increases the range and knockback of Shadow Charge by 25%, and the stun duration by 33%. 

Explanations: 

**Devil's Due** Dying is always a thing you want to avoid in a match. However, this talent would allow you to efficiently respawn depending on ""how long you lived to collect souls"". Technically, it's trade off is you always lose bonus health as you die instead of keeping it until you cap at 100, but it's something to think about.

**Demonhide** is the equivalent of Johanna's block. Not that Diablo's is weak, but I think this helps it scale later better. 

**Overwhelming Force** has always been problematic because it actually decreases the window of time you have in reaching your target hero and overpowering them. There used to be a small movement speed sprint diablo would have after using shadow charge but it was removed. This talent currently hurts diablo's combo more than it helps. By increasing the stun duration to be marginal with the distance changed, the talent takes the never-picked from the shadows stun duration increase, and helps round out the clunkiness and missed opportunities from nerfing your own Q with Overwhelming Force.


-----------------------------------------------

Level 7:

From the Shadows --&gt; Diablo is stealthed for 1 second after leaving brush

Explanation: This is simply thematic to the name but also adds a sneaky gank element to Diablo. It's not out of character as he has the ability to shroud himself, and it would make overpower initiating combos much more powerful for higher skilled diablos. 

-----------------------------------------------

Level 13: 

* Leech Life ---&gt; Basic Attacks against enemy Heroes deal bonus damage equal to 1% of the Hero's maximum Health and heal you for ~~the same amount.~~ 1% of your maximum health. 

* Siphon the Dead 15.6% max health ---&gt; 20% max health over 4 seconds

Explanation: 

**Slight buff to Leech Life** since Diablo has one of the highest health pools in the game, this is a form of sustain worth considering. Although 1% isn't alot, it can save Diablo's healer a very small amount if he is able to auto attack a target. The damage is still weak against squishies but the healing will be consistent and not dependent upon your target enemy. 

**Siphon the Dead**

I have absolutely no clue why Johanna's Laws of Hope is better in every single way than diablo's heal. Johanna can access it at level 4, it grants passive regeneration, and actually heals MORE. Absurdness aside, Muradin has a level 16 talent that heals twice as much, over 10 seconds. Diablo just gets the short stick too many times. Even WITH this buff it would be weaker and only later available for Diablo compared to Johanna, but with the health bonus he has I think it's okay. Honestly probably wouldn't be picked up still but you never know.

Level 16: 

* Rampage: Fire Stomp increases Diablo's Movement Speed by 20% and Basic Attack ~~damage~~ speed by 50% for 2 seconds.

Explanation:

This is for synergy with demonhide, diabolical momentum, and leech life in case you were leaning towards an auto attack build which i think can be really interesting. Trade 50% crits for faster attack speed. 

--------------------------------------------------------

To conclude, these aren't massive buffs to Diablo but I think help the quality of his Fire Stomp ability, and patches up the never picked/useless talents. It offers him a slight auto attack build if you think autoing other warriors might come in handy, gives a small 1 second stealth option upon leaving brushes for trickery and ganking which is thematic to diablo, and lastly gives some of diablo's never picked health related talents, some power to be more on par with other warrior tanks in his class.

I just wanted to lay down some buffs for the dakra prime to distinguish it but make it a viable competitor against the Broken War.

Pretty simple:

* Channeling Damage 1.5 --&gt; 1.8

* Status Chance 10% --&gt; 20%

New effect: Attacks against Bleeding Targets restore a small amount of health and energy. (Let's say 25 or something and scaling) 

The Dakra Prime would still have a lower base damage of 60 vs 90, but if one could use a channeling build (that needs a rework in general but that's another topic) without having to use life strike, it would make the Dakra Prime a more sustainable weapon with higher status chance, but 2/3 of the base damage.

I'm a GM Melee character main. I know that sounds odd, I usually lean towards warriors in my hero pool but also play Illidan, Zeratul, Alarak, and Thrall. They are higher risk, higher reward and usually serve different roles from a warrior.

With Samuro coming up, I noticed his skill cap is... well severely high. I believe becoming a mirror image master to compliment and take advantage of using clones to tank in place of a lack of sustain is extremely appealing me.

On top of that, stutter stepping and auto attack cancelling towards animations intrigues me and is something I've tried very hard to develop in terms of playing characters like Illidan and old tychus.

I wanted to ask, those of you who play the Three Vikings, is Samuro's mirror image controlling upon taking up that heroic the same/similar?

I play rexxar, but misha is pretty controllable with the 1 key and kiting with rexxar himself. 

Having to control 3 separate units that are vital however makes me nervous in learning.

Basically I wanted to know what tips you guys have (no matter what tier) for controlling multiple characters like the three vikings.

As a big fan of the original WC3 and a lot of WoW, I'm really wanting a Dreadlord in Heroes of the Storm. Though they are devastating vampire/demon like warriors, they usually use their cunning and dark manipulation to cause enemies to fight and turn on each other.

Hopefully the kit isn't super overtuned, but it probably is, i wanted to fill the Dreadlord fantasy role of being on a battlefield. 

Description from WoW wiki: http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Mal'Ganis

Mal'Ganis was one of the [nathrezim](http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Nathrezim) sent by Archimonde as a jailor of the Lich King. He was chosen to head up the plot to turn Prince Arthas to darkness, and make him the Lich King's greatest champion.

--------------------------------------------

**Warcraft - Specialist**

Mal'Ganis is a unique immortal Specialist Dreadlord who excels at both leading an army, and taking out foes with forceful might. 

Utilize your talents to specialize in wave pushing, mercenary slaying, or hero fighting. 

**Abilities**

* If it is an allied minion, heal yourself for 50% of the minions health over 2 seconds. 

  
  


**E - Sleep/Vampiric Spirit** - 8s Cooldown - Fire a dark spell that travels a medium range until hitting a hero. 

* If it is an enemy, they go into stasis for .25 seconds, then go to Sleep for 2.75 seconds. Enemies who are under Sleep will wake up upon taking damage, but otherwise cannot make any actions until the duration is up. 

* If cast on an ally, increase their attack speed by 20% and cause their basic attacks to steal 1% of the target's health for 3 seconds. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Heroics**

R -  Dark Betrayal - Cooldown: 30s - Long range: Channel for 4 seconds, and cause a target enemy hero to view your team as allies, and their own team as enemies. During this time, they will basic attack the closest ""enemy"" hero and cast all of their basic abilities off of cooldown at random targets and locations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Talents**

These aren't all the talents, just one's I wanted to include:

* Q - Deadly Maul - Quest:  Using Dread Maul on an enemy hero gains a stack of Maul. Upon reaching 30 stacks, permanently increase the damage of Dread Maul to 6% health steal. 

* Q - Quick Maul - Basic attacks reduce the cooldown of Dread Maul by 0.5 seconds.

I've played a lot of games recently and BoE doesn't really come up that often in the rotation.

However, when it does I feel like going for the Immortal is almost a waste of time and doesn't reward your team for the investment they put into attacking the immortal, defending yours, and fighting the enemy team. 

You can go a game with 6 immortals in a row, and the enemy has 0 specialists, and somehow they get as many keeps as you.

One of the reasons this can happen is by splitting with a siege camp, sure.

Another is because fighting to defend YOUR immortal is stupid. It will mostly be a poke dance where you get 0 damage off of their immortal, and they can poke your team AND the immortal, winning the trade with no downsides. 

The biggest victim here is the sheer weakness of the immortals.

Compared to every other objective ""boss"" in the game, the Immortals seem to complete the least pushing, and are taken down quite easily. They are next to 0 threat to enemy heroes as it's easy to dodge their abilities and just chuck away or stay the enemy immortal with their long wind up times. 

**Solution**

Let Immortals have a ""Basic attack"".

This way they will always be a threat for the enemy team and give a defending team an advantage instead of having an Immortals race or, whoever fights by the enemy's immortal gets free damage on it. 

I think the delay on the damage it deals, choreographed attacks, and stopping for one minion to do a 6 second wind up to an explosion that can be dodged is a waste of time.

I wanted to give my shot at it and see what you all think! Open to any and all suggestions and remarks. Please don't downvote as I'm seeking discussion!

Couple notes:

* Charge is named Steel Charge and is a heroic. Although it's slower than Diablo's Q, adding a pin duration, running over enemies and knocking them away, and massive damage I think makes it better suited as a heroic. Otherwise Tyrael players will just complain it's a Judgement heroic except you have to aim it. 

* Does not have innate cleave but can talent it

* Rock Hammer is similar to Leoric's Q, except it has vector aiming like Alarak's Telekinesis. This is so you can shove enemies left or right with it depending on if you aim it to swing left or right.

* The basic combo is to Rock Hammer a group of enemies to one side, effectively ""lining them up"". Then follow up with a Flame Strike to hit many heroes at once.

""Reinhardt is a heavily armored warrior hailing from a group known as the Crusaders: a group of modern knights during the [Omnic Crisis](http://overwatch.gamepedia.com/Omnic_Crisis).""

-------------------------------------------

**Abilities** 

Trait - Crusader Armor - Health on Reinhardt that is above 80% is converted into and counted as Armor. Armor takes damage first and reduces damage taken from all sources by half. 

Q - **Rock Hammer** - Cooldown: 8 seconds - Reinhardt swings his hammer in an arc in front of him, dealing damage to all enemies and knocking them aside. (Vector aim similar to Alarak to decide which way to swing your hammer, thus knocking enemies to the left or right) 

W - **Barrier Field** - Cooldown: 1 second Toggle - Reinhardt loses 50% movement speed and activates his shield in the target direction, creating a barrier that intercepts incoming damage. This shield has 200% of Reinhardt's health. 

*Upon breaking, or toggling off, the shield will go on cooldown until it has recharged to at least half health. Recharge rate is 5% per second (20 seconds to fully charge)* 

E - **Fire Strike** - Cooldown: 8 seconds - After a 0.5 second delay, Reinhardt unleashes a long range fireball towards target direction dealing 8% max health damage to all targets hit. This attack ignores shields. 

-----------------------------------------

**Heroics**

R - **Earth Shatter** - Cooldown: 60 seconds - After a short delay, Reinhardt slams his hammer into the ground, creating a cone of force that damages and stuns enemies who are hit by it for 1.5 seconds. Enemies stunned by this become vulnerable for the duration, increase the damage they take by 25%. 

R - **Steel Charge** - Cooldown: 30 seconds - After a short delay, Reinhardt activates his armor's boosters and charges in a target direction ramping up speed over 1 second, instantly killing all non-hero targets he runs over. If Reinhardt connect with an enemy hero, he will carry them with him for 4 seconds and will knock aside any additional heroes in his path causing minor damage. If Reinhardt brings them to a wall, they take massive damage and are stunned for 2 seconds.

*The player can steer Steel Charge slightly (at a delay) with their mouse. Similar to Li-ming's Disintegrate, but with less handling* 

-------------------------------------

MFPallytime brings up many good points in his disappointments of Zarya. Outside of Bodyblocking, you can pretty much ignore Zarya completely. 

Her Graviton Surge seems to be outclasses by Gazlowe's Gravity Bomb which actually does damage and covers a bigger area, the difference being you could probably escape the latter before it goes off. Graviton Surge does 0 damage.

Expulsion Zone is nice, but it's hardly better than Holy Ground. It blocks an area, but Expulsion does damage! Well, it will really only do damage if you push people into it which... well Zarya can't do.

Funnily enough, if she could use both heroics in the same place it would be pretty deadly.

------------------------------------------------------------

**Buffing numbers won't do anything**

Zarya has a shield, an aoe low damage auto attack, and an aoe grenade that deals low damage. No slows, no silences, not movement speed buffs, no stuns, no roots, no polymorphs, no blinds, no nothing. 

Adding utility and the power of GRAVITY thematically can bring her back into the game.

------------------------------------------------------------

**My ideas**

* **Extra Trait** Zarya emits a constant gravitational pull, causing Regeneration Globes to be attracted to her from a short distance. 

*This is because Zarya has two regen globe quest talents. This will both promote her theme, and help her and her allies gather them without being heavily harassed. Zarya can rotate lanes and have a slightly easier time grabbing that last second regen globe*


------------------------------------------------------------

**Abilities**

* Q - Particle Grenade: **Pinpoint Accuracy now innate:** Particle Grenade deals 40% more damage to enemies hit by the center of the blast.

* Personal Barrier renamed - **Protective Barrier**. Can now be cast on Zarya OR an ally, but **cannot stack shields. Now has 2 charges.**

* ~~Shield Ally~~ **Gravity Press** - Costs XX energy: Zarya fires a specialized grenade that emits a radial gravitational pulse that increases the gravity for all enemies caught, increasing their current basic ability cooldowns by 1% and slowing their movement speed  by 1% for 4 seconds for each **2** Energy Points spent at a maximum of 30% (60 energy). Cooldown: 20 seconds

*This gives Zarya utility. It's Imposing Presence that has an active component. The gravity is thematic, think Gravity training chamber from dbz, where they move slower, attack slower. See talents for this ability below* 

* **Graviton Surge** Damage from Heroic 20 talent now innate.

------------------------------------------------------------

**Talents** - Note that all talents effecting Shield Ally now effect Protective Barrier

**Removed**

* **~~Pinpoint Accuracy~~ Now Innate:** Particle Grenade deals 40% more damage to enemies hit by the center of the blast.

*This rewards skilled players who land precise skillshots with more damage, it also goes well with Graviton Surge*

**Moved/Combined**

* Level 4: I Am The Strongest + Give Me Twenty

*Since both shields are now combined, this quest and buff makes sense*

* Level 13: Unstoppable Competitor + Level 16: Cleansing Shield (Combined at Level 13) 

*Isn't making someone unstoppable, cleansing them anyways?* 

**New**

* Level 4: Heavy Weights: Gravity Press now also slows enemy attack speeds. 

*Poor Yamcha*

* Level 16: Weighed Down: If Zarya auto attacks an enemy in Gravity Press's pulse non-stop for 2 seconds, they are stunned by 1 second

*Dangerous Crowd Control talent. If you and your allies can position, combine the enemy forces, and crowd control them, Zarya (like Alarak) Will be heavily rewarded for lining up her auto attack against enemies.

* Level 20 **Gravity Kills** - Damage from Heroic 20 talent now innate. Level 20 now increases radius by 50%, and duration by 1 second. 

* Level 20 **Clear Out** - Enemies hit by Expulsion Zone become Vulnerable, increasing damage taken by 25% for 2 seconds.

Make Q empower autos for a duration, rather than just the next 3 (to help damage/attack speed builds), round out W, and give ult a passive like Tahm and Rek'sai, in this case ninja movement speed. 

Hi all, 

https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/54s9ch/some_thoughts_on_shen_by_lead_gameplay_designer/?st=itmg4rgz&amp;sh=89538585

Meddler said that Shen is a little on the weak side. They probably wanted him to not be a pick or ban during worlds. I don't think he would have been, but maybe had too much presence.

What really gets me is, not only is Riot so strict on making Shen always build full tank, but ever since his rework they refuse to nerf the cooldown on his ultimate in exchange for some laning and dueling power. I know he is plenty strong and can win trades, but after the first couple items he is a meatbag that is only good against tanks. 

I have a few suggestions and wanted to know what you think. This would make it so people may consider a damage item or two on Shen on top of tank items, so he is closer to say Jax and Irelia, but nerf his ultimate cooldown in exchange.

Lastly, other ""non damage ultimate"" on a tank or heck the one's that travel also have some passive slapped on. Rek'sai, Tahm Kench, 

**Suggestions**

* Ultimate Cooldown from 180/150/120 ---&gt; 200/160/120

* Ultimate Passive: Shen gains bonus movement speed: 20/40/60

* Q - Twilight Assault: Shen empowers his ~~next 3 basic attacks within 8 seconds~~ auto attacks for 4 seconds to gain bonus range and bonus magic damage.

* W - Spirit's Refuge: Shen primes his Spirit Blade for 2 seconds, causing it to project a protective zone around it for ~~1.75~~ 2 seconds if he or an allied champion move nearby, causing allies in the zone to dodge attacks.  (Kind of weird that it says he primes it for 2 seconds, but it only lasts 1.75. Whatsup with that?) 

This nerfs his ultimate cooldown at early levels, but gives him a ninja like movement speed when he ranks his ultimate. His Q is changed, so that you may land less or more autos depending on your play. Right now, you have 8 seconds for 3 empowered autos, then you would usually back off and try and land q again. With this change, all your autos are empowered but for HALF the duration. This makes positioning, cc and slows, and a stutter stepping Shen or those who build a damage item like trin force, get more autos in for more reward. Lastly, the W change is just my OCD. 

Thoughts?

Does anyone know which shields are damaged first if say an allied Tassadar, Zarya, put shields on a low hp Artanis who is taking damage?

Is it the first shield applied that takes damage first? Or is it the newest shield that takes damage first? Or is it the one that will expire soonest? Or are they evenly splitting damage?

This is a very important mechanic that im not sure about because of tassadars shield is damaged last, 50% could stay when talented, with zarya you might want hers damages first so she gets energy from it, but what if it is prioritized last? It would severely weaken shielded hero synergy in the game.

Not that he should technically be good at taking bruiser camps, but it turns out that he is the worst at it. He has a really good basic attack, that he uses literally about 5% of the time against enemy heroes since he has no reliant ways to land them. 

I think his triangle hit boxes really separate the good from the bad, while Discord Strike and both of Alarak's heroics hit really really hard. 

Discord strike is the only silence ability in the game that isn't tied to a heroic. If you can land it, it's a powerful disable linked with heavy damage. 

The main concern for Alarak seems to be his Heroics being cancelled fairly easy, whether Deadly Charge by minions, or Counter Strike by every cc in the game.

From his voice, to his thematic kit, it all comes together to something beautiful.

But when I've got him up to level 9 now, and there are just some things that absolutely bewilder me when it comes to design and counterplay.

1. **He can't solo the Bruiser camp in the diablo themed maps.** Now you can fight the minions first, but they are resummoned by the leader. If you try and solo the camp, using all abilities to hit all enemies off of cooldown, you lose. This was at level 16 so maybe it scaled too hard. Talents picked have no impact on the result of this

2. **He's one of the only heroes in the game that shows where his skill shot will hit** I'm fine with Q being hard to land with it's triangle shaped skill shot, making distant targets hard to hit with the tip. Heck I'm find with Counter strike being stopped by cc. **But why the heck does it show the opponent the triangle to walk out of?** it doesn't make ANY sense. Granted there are a few abilities that show this, Jaina's Blizzard for example. But that's not even channeled, and it seems that there is a massive inconsistency in hero design. Falstad's Hinderland Blast doesn't show the skill shot hit box. It shows a lightning bolt, but not technically a ""safe"" zone. The fact that it shows the enemy the skill shot hit box is just showing the enemy where it's going to hit and no other ability does that. That's like laying out a clear ""red"" path of Li-ming's arcane Orb in a wide cone so you know how big it will grow and where it will hit you and where it will end. 

3. **Last ditch spells can hit you after using Last Laugh** I guess they are still in animation or chase Alarak? maybe this is a bug but I think Alarak should have more like... 1% health instead of 1 actual health. 

4. **Minions stop deadly charge** this one is just frustrating. You have to rely on the wonky aggro of enemy lane minions as to if deadly charge can be used in lane or not. If you have the opponent on the run and know they wont hit you, it's all luck as to when the enemy minion wave comes in and if they are still looking for someone to hit. This should be changed to hero damage cancelling it, not pesky puny minions.

5. **His kit is really for heroes only** Well yeah he's an assassin, and sadism is for killing. So he fills a very niche role where you want kills to get ahead of the game and contest objectives. But when it comes to actually taking objectives like merc camps or the monsters in the maps, it's luck with which map you get to play, if your team can actually get you kills too. The problem Alarak has is he has no sustain with merc camps or minions. I just wish his Lightning Surge would heal him from mercs and minions. It wouldn't break him if it did it's a great ability. 

6. **Lightning Surge has some real potential** when it comes to talent picking, but there are just no ideal scenarios where you can really make use of the ""center beam"". I like the unique creativity behind it but it just doesn't work, even against groups. People will try the lightning surge talents out once but will immediately go back Telekinesis and Discord Strike talents. No reason not to.

Lastly, the trade off of Sadism for utility is really cool. I would like to see slightly more risk vs reward when it comes down to it but I'm pretty satisfied. I would like to see another way to gain it other than relying on allies to die. Alarak is in the run for most deaths, even against a Murky, due to his risky nature of fighting and I think he should be rewarded for going on a killing streak with permanent sadism.

**Tassadar - the Savior of the Templar**

~~Support~~ --&gt; Specialist

The shift in role is by no means a way of saying Tassadar cannot support. Like Medivh, they both have parts in their kit that revolve around protecting their allies and offer utility. Both have variants of shields, a damage spell, and scouting tools. By adding the theme of some of Tassadar's void-learnt powers I hope to make it so Tassadar is definitely more of a Specialist than a support without taking away real power from his shield ability. 

Buffing his abilities outright might be too much in my opinion. His talents are what need work and diversity so those are mainly what are being touched here. 

I think Archon is lacking and thus Forcewall was moved. Though risky, I want to know your thoughts.

Just keep in mind a lot of talents are very strong, but I believe none are a must pick nor heavily favor a single ability too much.

So I just moved into my new place and pay a good amount of money for my wifi.

When I hopped into HotS the other day though, I would experience severe lag spikes despite a ping of 16ms. 

I went through the usual shin dig of opening the command prompt, pinging the hots server, clearing out my dns, making sure hots was fine through fire wall, my drivers were updated (I'm running wireless by the way).

I just couldn't figure it out. I decided to open up task manager and close the usual useless background crap like icloud storage, nvidia something something doing nothing, razer stats manager, you name it.

I did a test game with AI, but no luck. 

 Then I noticed the battlenet desktop app taking up only about 170k+ or so on task manager. I closed it, and voila. 

12 games now and my internet has been smooth as hell. I think if there are some people out there with issues they don't know how to solve, they should see a professional. But if you mean hots connection, try closing the battlenet desktop app.

Maiming Strike has a bonus while **SLIDE ATTACKING**

These are two **different** things.

A ""spin"" attack (along with the damage of Spin attacks on a weapon's stat page) can be accomplished by crouching, sliding, and melee attacking.

HOWEVER.

A ""slide"" attack only counts if you are still sliding during the attack, aka holding crouch while the melee attack is going off.

The best way to test this is to bring a low crit chance weapon with Maiming Strike, maybe berserker if you can't spot the numbers easily, and comparing proc chances of the mentioned above ""spin"" attack against the above mentioned ""slide"" attacks.

Spin attacks should have the same, low critical chance of the weapon but still do the full spin attack stat damage, while slide attacks will crit 90%+ of the time and still deal the spin attack damage as well. 

**TL;DR**:  ""Spin"" attacks are different from ""Slide"" attacks. Spin attacks are - sprinting-crouch-melee attack (you can let go of sprint/crouch one the melee attack starts).

[From Overwatch](http://overwatch.gamepedia.com/Hanzo#Dragons) 

Hi all, I'm one of those obnoxious Shimada Bros finatics and I also play HotS. My concept of Hanzo has many cool talents that I think you'll love, with a samurai jack reference. 

Please note my number might be absurd.

There is a ""caster/poke"" variant of Hanzo, and an auto attack variant depending on talents and such. 

Health: 1337

Attack Speed: 1.0

Attack Range: 6.5

#**Abilities** 
------------------------------------------------

**Trait**: Baku Ten

Hanzo sweeps his bow as a weapon in an arc in front of him, dealing (100+3% per level) minor damage. If an enemy is hit, Hanzo will then perform a back flip creating distance between himself, and enemies hit. Cooldown: 6 Seconds

--------------------------------------------------

**Q**: Storm Bow

Hanzo pulls back an arrow, slowing his movement speed by 50% while charging an arrow. Charging increases range and damage of the arrow. 150 - 300 + 4% per level. Takes 2 seconds to fully charge. 6 second cooldown. Stops at first hero hit or at end of range. 

**Readies an arrow: Hanzo's W and E: specialized arrows are queued using his other abilities but have to be fired with Q but do NOT use Q's cooldown**. 

--------------------------------------------------

**W**: Sonic Arrow

Hanzo **readies** a Sonic Arrow that deals (100+4% per level) minor damage. When the arrow reaches its destination it reveals the area for 6 seconds. If it hits a hero, vision of that hero and anything within a short distance is revealed. Cooldown 12 seconds. 

--------------------------------------------------

**E**: Scatter Arrow - See the graphic --&gt;  [High detailed in game graphic 3d render model version moba Scatter Arrow Hanzo 935810935571](http://imgur.com/a/fVuOO) 

Hanzo **readies** a Scatter Arrow that deals (200+4% per level) damage upon impact with an enemy hero or surface. When the arrow reaches its destination or hits an enemy hero, it will shatter, firing off 6 fragmented arrows that deal (100+3% per level) damage. These arrows will continue to travel until hitting a surface twice, or upon dealing damage to a hero/minion/mercenary. Cooldown 8 Seconds.

* Hitting an enemy or surface will cause the fragments to fan out AWAY from the hit target depending on the angle.

* Firing the arrow and causing it to reach its max range without hitting an enemy hero will cause the arrow to explode and fire a fan of the scattered arrows forward in a cone

* Firing the arrow and causing it to hit a surface will fragment and fire a smaller cone of arrows at the same angle the original arrow hit the wall. 

--------------------------------------------------

#**Heroics** 

**R**: 

Option 1: Dragon Strike 

Hanzo readies a Dragon Strike Arrow. When fired, Hanzo summons a Spirit Dragon which travels through the air in a line. It passes through walls in its way, devouring any enemies it encounters dealing 10% of an enemy's current hp per second. This ability deals no damage to structures and will continue towards the edge of the map.

* This massively powerful ability can shred through tanks, but moves very slowly across the battlefield. Try and combo this with your ally's crowd control or to clear an area of enemies. 

Option 2: Well of Ozric

Hanzo empowers himself with the Dragon for 6 seconds, causing Storm Bow to no longer need charging, have a 2 second cooldown, fire 2 extra duplicate arrows in a 30 degree cone of Hanzo's original shot (With 50% of the damage). In addition, Hanzo's basic attacks will also fire 2 additional arrows at the closest two enemy targets (prioritizing heroes) with 50% of the damage. 

* Cause arrows to blot out the sun and rain down on your opponents. All arrows Hanzo fires will launch 2 more nearby with 50% effectiveness. 

----------------------------------------------------

#**Talents**

This ability deals no damage to structures and will continue towards the edge of the map. 60 second cooldown

* **Well of Ozric** Hanzo empowers himself with the Dragon for 8 seconds, causing Storm Bow to no longer need charging, have a 2 second cooldown, and fire 2 extra duplicate arrows within 15 degrees of Hanzo's original shot (in a cone, with 50% of the damage). In addition, Hanzo's basic attacks will also fire 2 additional arrows at the closest two enemy targets (prioritizing heroes) with 50% of the damage. 60 second cooldown

**Level 16:** 

* Q - Headshot: Deals +100% damage if the arrow hits nothing else before hitting an enemy hero and they are below 50% health.

* W - Curving Arrows: After firing Sonic Arrow, pressing W up to 3 times will fire an arrow towards your mouse that will curve towards Sonic Arrow's location when halfway traveled. The first enemy hit by this arrow will take damage equal to 5% of their maximum health.

* E - Riddled: Consecutive Arrow fragments deal 10% additional damage to the same target. 

  

**Level 20:** 
  
* Dragonstrike: Sated Dragon: Basic attacks reduce the cooldown of Dragonstrike by 0.5 seconds. Tripled against heroes

* Well of Ozric: Blotting out the sun: Hanzo can no longer move during the heroic's duration (6s).

During the arrow's flight, enemy vision is reduced by 10% per second for 3 seconds until at 30%. Enemies regain full vision after 3 more seconds.

* Ninja Training: Baku Ten gains an extra charge and the cooldown is refunded if Hanzo jumps over a wall with it. 

* Lucky Shot: Reduces the cooldown of Storm Bow to 3 seconds.

All of his augments are useful in their own right. Nekros kit is unique, useful, and thematic, and every Nekros you run into can be unique unlike our melee weapons these days that consists of the same: Primed Pressure Point/Blood Rush/Body Count/Berserker/Organ Shatter/Lifestrike/2 elemental mods and if you don't use that build you are a plebe. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the recent Nekros Prime release and changes, more and more people are falling to him and playing him.

I for one am having a blast.

But there are a few things that I'd like to point out as to why I think he is very successful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**All his abilities are used** 

* Whether you need to launch a heavy or corrupted ancient away for **peel**, or **revive** an ally from a distance during the panels in a raid, **Soul Punch** is a great example of a simple 1 ability that serves its purpose.

* **Crowd Control** is king in this game due to power strength falling off in the very very end-game (before fashion frame of course). This is because no matter what level you are at, **crowd control effectively disables enemies**. On top of that, health isn't as much as a concern as armor which mitigates damage. **Terrify** Is a massive crowd control ability that is more unique than a stun at it actually makes enemies run in fear. This is more useful than a stun in some ways as it **repositions** enemies and can be used to send a flock AWAY from a point you need to defend. The slight downside is that moving targets are sometimes harder to hit. To top it off, Terrify offers stacking armor reduction which again, scales infinitely.

* I grew up in the city, but Warframe and ""the grind"" made me realize why **farming** is so important. We all want to strive and gather those resources to build the next best thing and progress. **Desecrate** rewards out kill count with more spoils of war. Nekros can now effectively continue to battle, swing, and shoot during Desecrate now, while the broken pieces are ashed into the air for **additional loot**. As a side note, anyone notice that Tigris and Galantine Prime wasn't just power creep of the most popular weapons, but slash based for extra body parts? talk about **synergy**

* We are all parkouring mighty space ninjas with an unlimited unique arsenal to slay millions of foes. We are a one man army. But what's better than a one man army? A one man army that can summon his own army from killing the enemy army for them to serve you. Not only does **Shadows of the Dead** grant you summons to fight for you, they serve as **bodyguards** by taking up **aggro**, soaking up **damage** and even grant further **damage mitigation** with the **Shield of Shadows augment** which brings me to my next point.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**His augments are useful and fit into staple/serious play**

Many augments just don't cut it. They don't fit into the exilus slot, and 99% of the time it is better to fit a mod that grants stats to your abilities instead of ""features"". Nekros however is an exemplary product of how augments should be. Non-mandatory, but extremely viable.

* Something that was changed this year was a new **revive** system. Simultaneous revival sped things up, a focus tree granted instant revival, and bleedout mods were still useless but we got cool things like Inaros. What if however, you were say, in a LoR raid and someone standing on a button **died** but didn't step off the button so everything was still intact? You can't however revive the guy because you will get shocked, ruin the whole thing, and cause a chain reaction of **dying**. This is cheesy, but **Soul Survivor** let's you soul punch an ally back to 30% health at the cost of your remaining energy. But when you are swarmed by enemies sometimes you don't have enough time to or the tankiness to **resurrect** everyone while mobs beat at you. Look no further as you can revive someone from range!

* **Tankiness** is awesome. Whether you are a cold clad dragon knight frame, or the iconic iron skinned rhino, running around like a juggernaut and taking thousands of bullets and lasers to the face is nice when it **barely tickles** as you unload weapons and go berserk with a hammer. It's optional, but you get your own group of **bodyguards** if you play Nekros. Why tank the bullets for yourself and mess up your gorgeous **skeletal** figure and hair? those beautifully fashion frame viably colored tarsels and facepaint, i mean common! You ain't got armor to cover that up. Well then take a look at **Shield of Shadows**. This sucker scales with **power strength** and makes them bodyguards soak up even MORE damage for you. You are a walking zombie horde leader where all the zombies take 90% of the damage and bullets while you kill things then replace your now dead zombies with fresh ones. TALK ABOUT **RECYCLING**.

* I feel as if Nekros was really well thought out. Some abilities lack **unique** builds or depth like Loki only going radiating disarm with massive duration. But with frames like Nova and Trinity with different ideas is awesome! **Desecrate** is an ability that allows you to loot hordes of enemies for double rewards (it works 50% of the time, alllll the time). However, with so many enemies dying, Nekros tends to run dry on energy. With **Despoil** you can sell part of your... evil but not so existent soul instead of energy to loot bodies. This starts a huge **recycling** trend where health is spent to loot bodies that give you back health and energy that can be used for more and more abilities. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Recycling and builds that don't revolve around raw stat improvements**

If you haven't seen [Mogamu's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glKdPDHsyAs) on Nekros yet. I highly recommend you come check it out as it inspired a good amount of this post. Despite him being a horribly punny black dude, I love Mogamu. 

Nekros is one of if not the only frames that can stray from your standard power strength/range/duration mods and actually use MODIFICATIONS not IMPROVEMENTS to be absolutely effective.

I won't rant on this but, pressure point, hornet strike, and serration are stupid. Sure if you play the game long enough and bother to rank up these mods you are rewarded more damage than the guy next to you, **but these are staple mods that HAVE to be seen on every single fucking weapon in the game**. When something has to be everywhere, **it should just be innate, standard, and ingrained by default.** If weapon's damage scaled with rank, it would free up a slot of **MODIFICATIONS and not **raw power**, which is what mods should be:  Making your own unique weapon that functions differently from your neighbors who has the same make and model. 

**This is what makes Nekros so great**. You CAN opt for range, strength, and/or duration. They are all effective and have a great impact on his abilities for your own unique playstyle. This is also why I love **Corrupted** mods because there is a trade off which makes your frame unique. You can improve the range, but if you want to improve it further, you need to sacrifice strength. If you want an ability to be more stronger or potent, you can! but if you want to push it to its limit it will cost you some additional energy, or even some endurance on that abilities duration. **HOWEVER**

With Nekros, you can avoid these mods completely. With mogamu's video, he has shown that with the power of **RECYCLING** you can use the health/energy conversion mods, Nekros's augments, and other modifications to make a really unique build that not only works, but is  STRONG and scales well. His reworked kit, thought behind the augments, and this idea of being able to choose between energy or health to cast despoil, then using that ability's drops to recycle and feed back into each other for **actual** efficiency is absolutely beautiful. I love it, and it's why I love Nekros.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**While I think a lot of frames are in a good spot (oberon, chroma's 1/4, hydroid, mag, you suck). I love to see this fresh unique playstyle, different unique builds and mods in a Warframe. My only hope is that we can get the same for weapons (craft your own unique sword with mods not just raw stats).**",Warframe,Nekros is a Warframe with a kit that all others should strive to match when it comes to diversity and depth - A review - I love recycling,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/509667/nekros_is_a_warframe_with_a_kit_that_all_others/

I just wrote a post on LoL's yasuo and on a purely paper perspective of this PTR patch of HotS it is everything I ever dreamed of what LoL had and HotS didn't.

Heroes of the Fucking Storm has come a long way and I love this game so much I might uninstall LoL for it after this patch for two simple reasons.

1. More, faster, newer content making me salivate and consume and enjoy it. Sure LoL has been around a longer time with a bigger roster, and I will never stop watching its E-Sports scene. But the updates roll out slower and while the game might have more depth, i will be present for HotS's continued growth and it feels fun, amazing, and great. NEW FUCKING MAPS. 

2. They are finally fixing very vague and misleading information in the game. It's confusing in a game to have to look at everyone's picked talent every few levels to watch out for something. Some of these like spell shield, block, and slows are hard to notice. Heroes have weird shared talents that are only picked when strangely overpowered or lack of a better option and never unique. This patch completely changes that and I'm falling more and more in love with HotS.

This elimination of lack of clarity and changes that make me understand whether one ability should be unstoppable or not, or why he's tanky after i cc him are much more understandable now. 

That is all!

**Conclusion/TL;DR** : As a Yasuo player I'm happy with these changes. Unworthy Tank yasuos will no longer be a thing. It's a slight nerf overall but I will gladly carry the extra ""burden"" if it means fire will stay off Yasuo's back. My biggest fear is the number of bugs that will crawl in through the void after these changes. I don't want to play another buggy yasuo for another 2 years. 

**YAYY**

I'm not a Yasuo one-trick but he is my most played champion.

I was concerned because I was convinced that after bug fixes, Yasuo was finally in a good and healthy spot!

However... remnants from the tank meta struck. Like the venom symbiote they went from one champion to the next, remnants of THAT remained on Ekko.. but he is for another day.

It spread and spread and eventually our beloved glass cannons of high risk and high reward eventually saw play and success through builds that abused base damages while having the ability to build tanky.

We love build diversity in league of legends, but when one overshadows the other (especially without the original build being originally intended.. we have a problem).

Now there is back and forth on the armor pen items and what state they are in since a top tier adc like Jhin doesn't even build crit anymore.

But on the meta, Yasuo's base damages were a problem as a tank, yet not as a ""glass fighter"". 

If you nerfed his base Q, it would hurt crit yasuo builds. If you hurt the ad scaling, Yasuo wouldn't even build ad until his second item it was tough.

We were scared of Attack speed nerfs due to the massive massive clunkiness that comes about them (like the Zed attack speed nerf) but alas, Riot found a solution.

**PBE attack speed changes** 

* Attack speed per level lowered to 2.5 from 3.2
* Base attack speed also increased to [0.67] from [0.658].
* Attack delay to  -0.067 from -0.05


By increasing the Base Attack Speed, but reducing the one per level, BUILDING attack speed still feels great and does not change the.. *cough* flow of the Q cooldown scaling at certain stages of the game. However because of the current growth, tanks could abuse the low cooldown spam of Q and tanky chasing potential of Frozen Mallet with nothing but a phantom dancer or Trinity Force.

This change makes building attack speed stronger on Yasuo, but straying from it in your build path weaker.

HOWEVER, I am scared what the ""delay"" is as resetting your autos may feel slightly different...

**Last Breath change**

The final change, that I'm all for, is the Ult armor/mr penetration change.

For those of you who don't know:

* Last Breath (R) - secondary effect of increased bonus armor pen now **only applies to Yasuo's critical strikes rather than all attacks.**

Off the bat, this is a nerf to Yasuo's E magic damage. It's hard to argue because at first, people say yay and don't worry it's only a slight nerf since E does no damage.

To people who know Yasuo though, E is important for mixed damage, and if you stack it it chunks nicely. I won't cheer or complain on it, it is what it is and is a nerf to Yasuo's overall damage output. 

**on the only crit change**

This was against directed at the high base damage tank version of Yasuo who got free penetration (Yasuo doesn't REALLY need last whisper but it isn't horrible on him because the name matches.) Now only Yasuo's crits gain the bonus penetration which is good!

It means you want to reach that shiv item then get a cloak of agility, then you are almost at today's yasuo power curve.

I think these changes are healthy, not over dramatic, and as a Yasuo player I'd accept them.

**HOWEVER**

They sound nice on paper, my biggest, biggest concern is that the number of bugs that may/will arise from these changes are.... well exponential. I just really really hope Riot is very delicate with implementing these changes code-wise as I would hate to go another 2 years with a bugged out Yasuo that isn't fun and has a worse reliance on success than a 1% critical chance.

http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Enemy_Level_Scaling

Enemies are essentially meatshields so we can see giant numbers pop up on the screen when we shoot them. When they shoot us, it's a small portion reduced by armor that lowers our &lt;1k shields and &lt;1k health (for the most part).

Now this works, and allows the game to empower the player, but there are certain mechanics to where this doesn't balance out some other strengths most namely having enemies do damage vs enemies.

Enemy damage is tuned to take down a Warframe, and enemy health is tuned to take damage from a warframe.

We are essentially glass cannons except enemies are armored meatbags that use noodles to hit us, so when we are trying to redirect enemy attacks to have them fight against themselves, they are armored meatbags hitting other armoured meatbags. 

Balancing all this scaling will probably be difficult, it's not as simple as multiplying all our survivability by 10 or 100, then multiplying the enemy's damage by the same so they actually HURT each other, but I feel like damage reflection and enemies fighting enemies in this game is extremely underwhelming.

**VERY IMPORTANT | PLEASE READ** I have spent countless hours 3d rendering, modeling, designing, and programming these high-definition models that match the game's graphics and settings to attempt to give you all an accurate visual representation of what these ramps and bridges would look like. Please see them here:

143,2016-08-22 21:06:49+00:00,self.heroesofthestorm,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/4z2sg1/an_artanis_rework/,False,"Hi all. Now I know a lot of here on this sub are back and forth on Artanis, and if he is good or not. Many people believe he is fine and love playing him/his kit, while others seem to look at the raw stats where his winrate his fine, his competitive scene is non existent, yet the stronger arguments I have read are that his kit just ""doesn't make sense"". 

I think he is GOOD. But I do not think he is GREAT. I think there is plenty of room to make his kit healthier and logical, as his stats on paper and on the scoreboard remain true, I do not believe that his design is as good as it could have been.

I'm not trying to bash Blizzard and say his kit was half-assed, but compared to other heroes we've had around his release date up to now, he was half-assed.

He relies on auto attacks, to both do damage and lower the cooldown of his shield. Yet his Q and E have no synergy with auto attacks whatsoever. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**No other hero in this game, has had abilities complained about as much, or has had their flaws pointed out as much as Artanis**.

There are very few characters with **tradeoffs and punishment**s to using their abilities and I feel Artanis just **isn't rewarded with the risks he takes with this kit.**

Examples of higher damage on Blade Dash on the way back, or a boost in attack speed after landing a Phase Prism are examples of what abilities should have for taking the risk, yet these are tied into talents meaning the basic ability itself is actually not worth using except in the most extreme situations!

Artanis is the ONLY character where you have to choose whether you want to use an ability or not. Other characters, it doesn't hurt bar the cooldown/saving it but are essentially risk free outside of that. Artanis's abilities are so situational that he is not rewarding to play.

While this does serve as an interesting design and being unique, it is realistically not effective. 

I however acknowledge their multiple attempts to balance him and I'm actually partial on the innate Zealot Charge change. However, leaving that intact, my goal in this idea is to solve these various ""problems' 

* Shield Overload - This ability has **anti-synergy with healing.** In order for him to tank, he wants to be unhealthy in a fight, yet not die. This is hard for a healer/support to not want to keep him topped off, yet having to prioritize him when he IS low to survive. While this is interesting, it will never EVER fit the meta and thus I think needs to be changed if we want to see Artanis on the competitive scene. 

* Blade Dash - I know I know, some people want to have it to be cancellable, others are happy with it, there are other ideas. My problem with Blade Dash is that 1. it does less damage, and is less useful, and less safe than Falstad's Q Hammerang, despite doing the ""same thing"". and 2. **Artanis is punished for using the ability much more than he is rewarded for using it**.  As a side note, LoL's Warwick rework was going to have a similar ability, but was ultimately scrapped due to the exact same reason this ability is complained about. 

* Phase Prism - While switching positions with an enemy is nice, I find it kind of odd that such an ability has such a cooldown, travels slowly, and ultimately is a ""less effective"" Stitches hook. Now it may not be fair to compare one heroes abilities to another since other parts of their kit influences the others, but you could easily replace Phase Prism with a dozen other ideas and no one would miss it. 

* Lastly, I think Artanis's Heroics are great abilities.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My proposed changes, usually in **bold**

* **Shield Overload**

- Cooldown: 20 seconds

- Healing from allies is half as effective when Artanis is over 50% health. If you take damage ~~while below 50% Health~~, gain a ((467 + 4% per level ) Shield is fully effective at &lt;50% health, Shield is half as effective at &lt;75% health, and a quarter as effective at above 75% health. ) point Shield for ~~5~~ 4 seconds. Your Basic Attacks lower the cooldown of Shield Overload by 4 seconds.

**Explanation:** Shield duration down by 1 second for balance. Shield now activates **whenever** Artanis takes damage, the shield however is now much WEAKER when Artanis has high health, but retains its strength at lower health levels. Healing is weaker from allies (not sippy cups) when Artanis is already healthy to balance the Shield Overload skill. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **Blade Dash**

- ~~65~~ 80 Mana 

- Cooldown: ~~10~~ 16 seconds

Dash forward and deal (60 + 4% per level) damage to enemies.

**If you continue to hold the ability down, you will then return** and deal 375 (~~178~~ 200 + 4% per level) damage, refunding half the mana and cooldown. 

**Explanation:** Artanis will now dash forward dealing damage. If you hold it down, he will dash back but this is now OPTIONAL. This will give Artanis some immense mobility. HOWEVER. The cooldown is now **16** seconds if you choose to dash. That is **6 seconds longer and 15 more mana.** Half of the cooldown and mana is refunded if you choose to dash back, and the base damage on the way back is higher as well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **Twin Blades** Unchanged

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **Phase Prism**

- 70 Mana 

- Cooldown: 14 seconds

Artanis fires a Phase Prism ~~that deals 145 (69 + 4% per level) damage to Heroes~~ and swaps your position with theirs. **If Phase Prism does not connect, the prism will remain on the ground for 3 seconds. Artanis can recast Phase Prism during this time to swap positions with the closest friend or foe.**

**Explanation:** Thematic to Artanis's warping ability, this ability is similar to Chromie's Time Trap but is not invisible. Artanis will teleport to where Phase Prism has landed no matter how far he has traveled during the 3 second duration. If someone is near the prism at the time, they will switch places with Artanis. This trades the original damage it provided, for Phase Prism with new zoning power to create some awesome jukes. Similar but weaker to Zeratul, this prism will only allow Artanis to travel to that location if he is successfully swapping places with somebody. What this really does is it lets Artanis place a prism down and dive into the fight, but jump back to peel if someone decides to engage on his team's backline. It also allows Artanis to threaten the enemy without committing completely. To balance this new effect, the damage from Prism Sphere has been removed. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Talent Changes**

I believe his talents are okay. People think that bruiser Artanis is okay, but Tank isn't, then others argue even that. Many people say Artanis isn't good because he has to fully commit to a fight and can't run from it. Hopefully the new Phase Prism and Blade Dash changes that, but hampers his rewards by using them in a strategic fashion over an aggressive one. 

* Reactive Parry - Stores 2 charges instead of storing up to 2 charges

* Chrono Surge - ~~Hitting an enemy Hero with Phase Prism grants 40% bonus Attack Speed for 4 seconds.~~ Refreshes Twin Blades

* Templar's Zeal - Keep in mind the cooldown is 16 seconds for using Blade Dash, 8 if you decide to return (down from 10 overall). With Templar's Zeal, when below 50% health, the normal dash is now 8 seconds, but should still be 8 seconds if you decide to return. 4 seconds would be OP

* ~~Follow Through~~ Century Strike - After using an ability, your next **two** Basic Attack within ~~6~~ 3 seconds deals 40% additional damage.

* Phase Bulwark - Keep in mind this activates with Shield Overload now, making it a much stronger talent since it's not only when below 50% health. Unchanged. When Shield Overload activates, you take 50% less damage from Abilities for 4 seconds.

* Zealot Charge - Now warps to the enemy instead of dashes

* Titan Killer - 2.5% --&gt; 3%

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Conclusion** I don't think my changes are perfect, but my goal was to remove the punishment and clunkiness from Artanis's weird kit, but improve the reward for taking risks. 

**TL;DR** Healing is less effective if Artanis is healthy. Shield Overload activates at any health now from taking damage, but is much much weaker at high health, and still strong at low health. Blade Dash doensn't force you to return, but has a much higher cooldown of 16 (as opposed to 10 seconds). This cooldown is halved if you choose to return with Blade Dash. Prism Sphere will now stay on the ground if you miss it, allowing you to recast it if someone is near it and swap with them opening up interesting juking and peel.

Something interesting though, is that War is the undisputed champion in melee dps. HOWEVER. Fragor Prime still works due to trading some speed, and range, in exchange for crit stats and a channeling damage bonus.

SO instead of free quest weapons being stronger than prime variants, why not go along the same path and make Dakra Prime have some different unique stats, even if it maintains a lower base damage.

Shoutouts to Aatrox, Karthus, Galio, Mordekaiser, Azir, Kled, and Ryze!

Yorick and Warwick, I love you. See you soon.

Pretty sure I'll just get downvoted but I guess I'll try and hope for the best.

So yeah everybody already knows that Nunu, Azir, Kled, and Ryze are some of the worst, if not the worst champions in the game right now. But let me just back it up with some stats:


|  Play rate = ~~1.15%~~ &lt;0.3%  

This means these guys are found in less than 1/300 games!

|  Win rate = ~~43.9%~~ Nunu has an abysmal 35.7% winrate and Azir's is lower than Kalistas. Ryze and Kled are new so I guess they get a pass?   

So what does this mean? Even for a ~~hard to play champion this is actually terrible~~ Stupid faceroll easy to play champion like Nunu, he is terrible. (Also since when did hard to play champs means they should do more damage and be stronger? that's stupid logic at it's finest.)

|  DMG Dealt per game = 12,765 - [Nunu](http://champion.gg/champion/Nunu/Jungle). [Azir](http://champion.gg/champion/Azir/Middle) - lowest winrate of his role. 
 
Many ppl actually discount this stat but I take it quite seriously. That's the lowest of any ~~adc~~ jungler it the game!  

* So yeah I know that stat sites are usually ruined by the one tricks and first timers but u have to consider that his playrate is so low so only mains actually do play hime (I was one of them but had to drop her off because she is the worst champion in the game IMO). So being played only by the mains and having 43% winrate? I think that is really fuckin terrible, awful, disgusting...

* | Let me make this clear, I know riot had to do something about him so he doesn't keep being played in competitive games and counter jungling everyone in the game, I got it and it is justified! His concept of being able to instantly kill a whole team from a bush and eat/out smite every single one of your jungle monsters makes his team feel safe and do what they want since their jungler will be so far behind, he can perma slow and provide decent dmg and being a huge threat for the enemy team and the most important of all - being an objective control ~~queen~~!!! you can't beat consume+smite you just can't! just made him broken in coordination with his teammates which is really easy to abuse in competitive but is not that broken for soloq.

* Lemme know what do u all guys think of a jungler with the lowest winrate and the lowest dmg dealt per game of all the junglers and second lowest playrate(I don't need to count anyone else because Nunu is the worse)

* I don't really know what was riot thinking about but they could just make his consume not work on monsters and his ult seen in brushes, something like Aurelion Sol.. Instead of making him do no dmg and make him get rekt by any kind of anything. (for those who don't know, every other champ in the game shits on nunu).

Constantly at the bottom of every tier list.

It has been 10 months since his release and he has seen minimal competitive play, and even then suffers a horrible win rate and has only worked with very specific focused team comps.

Other warriors will always outperform Artanis in every way unless there was a straight up, no moving, stand still auto attack duel between two foes. 

---------------------------------------------------------

This isn't the Artanis we know and love from Starcraft. Leader of the Protoss, and the Hierarch of the Daelaam, Artanis was a VERY mobile warrior who relied on his psi-blades, shield, and later on the ability to blink to cut down his foes.

The Artanis we have is infinitely kited in this game, has no form of sustain, and his tankiness is non existent unless he is at an inconveniently low amount of health.

-------------------------------------------------------

I feel as long as his Blade Dash is more of a punishment, than a reward for both damage and being a target (unless you manage to dodge something) he will not see high-tier play as it is only good for very few things.

I feel as long as his Shield Overload is an ability that can't protect him from any poke or harassment, his label as a tank only exists in all-in engagements. 

------------------------------------------------------------

From what I've seen, Alarak looks amazing. His theme is perfect, and his abilities WORK and have no signs of clunkiness or lack of rewards.

I think it's best to go back and rework Artanis with the same mindset of recent heroes.

**TL;DR** Artanis is only a tank when below 50% health and thus is ""useless"" in his role except during all-in engagements since he has no way to beat out poke and harassment. His Blade Dash is only used to dodge abilities, and finish off foes, both of which are very rare moments while Artanis is punished by taking harass (that isn't tanked) for using it to wave clear or do damage. **Artanis needs to be looked at and reworked despite being kind of young.

They grant crowd control to characters who were not supposed to have it in the first place. 

------------------------------------------------------

I don't want to digress here too much but: The tank meta is due to champions base stats not being unique enough letting any character with high base damages/mobility to abuse the items and still deal proportional damage. For Ekko and say Yasuo, sure you can nerf their base damages and buff the scaling, but let's say you nerf the damage on Yasuo's Q, you end up nerfing Yasuo's ""normal' damage high risk high reward build, just to nerf the tank base damage one. If you buff his ad scaling, it still nerfs his standard kit because he doesn't even build ad until his second item (PD/Shiv grant 0 ad).

I feel like the reason juggernauts aren't viable is because of this super speed kite meta with sivir, karma, hecarim and you won't see the likes of darius, garen, heck mordekaiser has rylais as a core item to simply counteract the kite meta.

I won't go into detail about how much I love Aatrox, thanks Key and Peele.  I simply want to throw some ideas out there to help build upon the theme of Aatrox as a war-like god on the battlefield who both dives the enemy team and inspires bloodlust. 

Explanation on the ability changes are at the bottom!

**TL;DR** Erm, i suggest you read the post, sry, but basically health cost is removed, W is more % based to help tank aatrox and fighting tank aatrox, E rewards hitting people with both blades and will inspire minions later in the game for splitpushing. Ultimate will make Aatrox go berserk and go after a single target, sweeping enemies in his path aside instead of a ""different"" master yi ult that... well just gave a buttload of attack speed. No gameplay to that!

Let me know what you think!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Passive** Blood Well - For each % of damage nearby enemy champions AND Aatrox take, blood well will fill up by the same percentage. Blood Well will also fill by 1% whenever Aatrox deals damage to minions per minion. 

Whenever Aatrox takes fatal damage, he is cleansed of all debuffs and is restored up to 33%/66%/100% of his maximum health based on how full his blood well was upon death. 

Blood Well will decay 1% every second, after being out of combat with enemy champions for 12 seconds. 

**Cooldown:** 200/170/140/110

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Q - Dark Flight**

Changes: 

**COST:** 5% of Blood Well

* The player can now ""swerve"" their cursor left or right of the path, to change the trajectory of Dark Flight's path. This can be used to dodge skill shots during the very brief half second while Aatrox is in flight. (Think Diana Q/Alpha strike dodge)

* Rank 5: Cooldown refreshed upon dying.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**W - Blood Thirst/Blood Price**

Every third auto: 

* Blood Thirst:  When attacking minions, remains unchanged. When attacking champions: Steals 0.4/0/8/1.2/1.6/2% of the enemy champion's current health. Doubled when Aatrox is below 50% health. AD Ratio included. 

* Blood Price: Keeps base damage against minions, removes current cost. Against champions, now consumes 1% of Aatrox's current health to deal 5% of the target's current health as damage. Inflict Grievous Wounds for 2 seconds. AD Ratio included. 

**Passive:** Aatrox gains 8/16/24/32/40% bonus attack speed. (Moved from passive Blood Well, now permanent based on rank, but slightly nerfed as opposed to old max blood well Aatrox). 

* Rank 5: Life steal that Aatrox builds is converted into restore for damage dealt (now applies to damage, not just auto attacks)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**E - Blades of Torment**

* Cost: 5% of Blood Well

* Removed ap ratio

* Slow duration across all ranks + .25 seconds

* Enemies who are hit by both blades take 50% more damage from the ability and the slow lasts 50% longer

* At rank 5: Allied minions hit by Blades of Torment gain 10/20/30/40/50% movement and attack speed for 3 seconds. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**R - Massacre**

This is where I write the big change. People asked for Sion's ult, or buff Aatrox's in stuff, but I think that would just make him a different Master Yi... this may contradict that but read the ability and let me know what you think!

**Massacre:** Aatrox unlocks his blood fueled lust for War and target's an enemy champion. 

* Retains bonus attack range

* Aatrox will become taunted by the target enemy champion for 6/7/8 seconds and cannot cancel it. 

* Aatrox becomes immune to crowd control, but not slows

* Enemy champions and minions standing in between Aatrox and target will cause Aatrox to pause for an auto attack and cleave them aside dealing auto attack aoe damage to them before Aatrox resumes his flight

* Aatrox has a 20/30/40% movement speed bonus for 6/7/8 seconds. 

* Aatrox's Blood Thirst and Blood Price will now apply on **every** auto attack and the attack speed will be doubled. 

* Deals 150/225/300 magic damage around him upon casting

* Fills his Blood Well by 20% per champion hit by initial cast

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just to end off, my idea/goal for Aatrox was to obviously buff him but also make him more interesting as a **team fighter**, **dueler**, and **split pusher**. 

**The Passive Change:** I wasn't a big fan of his double-edged sword design because there was no gameplay to it. It was just a kind of consequence for... doing things which made him unattractive to me. Because of this, health costs were removed and to build upon his war theme, he instead fills his blood well by simply making enemies bleed, and being in battle. Inconsistent attack speed buff is no longer tied to bloodwell, and is instead passive when ranking W. 

**The Dark Flight change:** Minor, but useful. This is for more skilled players who want to clutch dodge that morgana binding. Dark Flight only lasts a split second, so the change will rarely change games but when it does, it looks cool! Think diana q, for dodging skillshots. 

**The Blood Thirst/Price change:**  Same against minions, against champions it is % based to shred tanks, but still scales off bonus ad. All in all same ability slightly buffed, but shreds tanks better. Blood Thirst will steal hp too now though. 

**The Blades of Torment Change:** Again, overall the same. AP ratio removed to compensate for buff. Now rewards players for landing the convergence of blades. Rank 5 buff is so that it will not hurt Aatrox's laning phase, but when split pushing later it will buff his lane minions to push harder and ""inspire war and blood lust"" to his army. 

**Massacre Change:** If you look at it, all Aatrox's ultimate does right now is a bit of magic damage, a fill of the blood well, and a butt load of attack speed. Essentially a kayle E without the cleave. I don't think his ultimate felt very impact as it was nothing but a steroid which didn't make him unique and just built upon him being another master yi/right clicker. 

This change is so that in a team fight or duel, both teams know that Aatrox is going after a single target and will cut down anyone who gets in his way. The enemy team will need to either protect their target by slowing Aatrox, or killing him, but be careful to not waste their hard crowd control on him. Everyone will know who he is after and the player them self are taunted during this time. 

This brings both fear and inspiration across the battlefield making it an exciting team fight and a duration where people need to be careful. Allies of the marked enemy, can stand in the way of Aatrox's assault, temporarily slowing him down as he would have to pause and cleave them aside. 

The Counterplay to his ultimate

* Slow Aatrox - Immune to crowd control but not slows, you can hinder the unrelenting war juggernaut in his assault. Use slows! and maybe tell your ashe to run. 

* Kill Aatrox - Simply blow him up! As a diver, an Aatrox player might be happy with this as his team will most likely be following up with his ultimate anyways. Aatrox will die, resurrect in the midst of a team fight and... well fight!

* Stand in the way of Aatrox - resulting in being cleaved aside, ""wasting"" one of his autos that he intended for another target and draining the duration of his ultimate.

I could have sword that when the game was first released, a roadhog would have to land a hook, shoot you, and if he landed enough pellets he could melee you to take down your average 200hp character.

* Player interactive - This base would be invisible on the map, but if anyone else were to walk within its vicinity and HAPPEN to tap onto the location of your secret base, they would be able to spin a stop of standard rewards, catch copies of the pokemon lured that day, but ONLY IF:

* They defeat your secret base guardian in 1 on 1 combat - You would put one of your favorite pokemon there to guard your base from any intruders. The wandered would be unable to access the invisible goodies if they cannot beat your pokemon

This is mainly so that third parties cannot sell their goods for real money.

This is mainly bad because it means that rich people can simply buy the progress instead of putting in the work like Pokemon Go was meant to. 

I think the purchasing of pokemon is immoral and should be discouraged, though some may disagree.

--------------------------------------------------------

I believe the BEST way to prevent this, is to make it so that the two pokemon being traded are within a certain range of CP. 

PEOPLE AT FIRST WILL HATE THIS. They would gladly give up their 400 pidgey for a 12 dratini if they are collecting! However this is probably the method that is best for trainers are there are only so many restrictions that can be implemented in the game without ruining the experience. 

This will prevent players from simply paying to win, they would have to trade something of similar CP value. 

Perhaps the range difference could be 10 cp per level. So at level 25, you can trade pokemon that are as far as 250 cp from one another, so you would still have to give up something somewhat ""valuable"" for what you are getting. 

This won't of course dissolve the purchasing of pokemon altogether, but I think it's a great first step as there is absolutely ** NO** way to prevent third party websites, apps, groups, etc. from selling their pokemon go earnings for real life money.

**TL;DR** Make blade dash cancellable, trading the second half of massive damage, for mobility. 
Make shield activate at 100% health, but be really weak at 100% health and get stronger as it approaches 1% health. 

----------------------------------------------------------------

**For his Q**, you can stop it with crowd control, he can still get shot for full damage, it can be interrupted so it's as if you were hooked into the enemy team, yet you can't interrupt it yourself...

Now I know since his release we FINALLY got some love for him, but I just feel like his kit design wasn't well flushed out. 

I know we all beg for Blade Dash to have the ability to be cancelled, or to grant him SOME sort of tankiness so he isn't doing miniscule damage on the way out, takes a butt load of poke, then most likely doesn't get the returning damage. If it were cancellable, we would miss out on the extra damage in exchange of mobility and I think that's perfectly fair. 

----------------------------------------------------------------

**The Shield** Sure Artanis thrives and can survive at low health if he is constantly attacking people, but it's not a strategy or real mechanic that you can rely upon to win a game or say ""I picked Artanis for this reason and it was a good pick.""

As for his shield? make it scale as he gets lower in health, but let it activate at full health. This will HELP him mitigate poke (aka going in with blade dash to help wave clear) but to balance it out, make the shield weak when he is at a high health level, and stronger in more urgent situations. 

I think a change similar to the ones I mentioned would do wonders for Artanis and we might see him picked competitively.

I know I know, you are an Artanis main and have no problems with him and are Rank 1 i get it. You can say that about legit, every hero in the game.

The fact of the matter is, even if his winrate LOOKS fine, he has no reason to be picked over other warriors right now. 

Thoughts? 

**PS:** Can we get an artanis who is injured with cracked armor, no khala, and zeratuls blade please?

I'm one of the burnt out players who has the ""top tier gear"" and formad my butt off to be in a happy late game state.

The game however grew stale over the months, as I only come back for big updates that contribute to the story, or new weapons/enemies that are fun to use and fight.

This update? 

Very confusing at first, but after learning about the systems and realizing all of it would be refined over the next couple weeks, the game really is better guys. 

I'm sure exp gains and void trace drops are low right now and people may complain, but the grind is not only more exciting, but you have to be active! You can't just sprint to the end of a mission anymore for prime parts. 

Random nullies can be annoying, but seriously? it's not only a fun challenge but if they spawn on you, it means you are in the bubble, one shot from a pistol and they are dead. Literally that easy, not sure what people are complaining about. 

I for one came back to the game with features that I begged for a year ago, wandering kubrow, holster placements, searchable market, (takes 5 minutes to browse through each section to see if anything is new) forma packs for 35 plat, tennogen workshop updates, non boring void, junctions to complete as a self accomplishment feature.

Again the game was boring for me since i got through all the content, this is refreshing and new and fun. We will always look at the down side of things because they are obstacles in our adrenaline endorphin filled fits of what is great about the game. 

Literally just the day before the update hit people were raving about how great the game is! Then people are upset with an update that is ALMOST bug free, with tons of new features and things to do and accomplish?

* Animations

* Voiceovers

Now with other games, it's an almost clear case as to what you are paying for. The more you spend the better you get. 

The problem in Overwatch is that when it comes to Legendaries, you can buy the badass dark looking Reinhardt skin, yet he still is a giant lovable goofball who is in love with justice. 

Whereas if you pick say, Mercy, one of her skins has the addition in ""Heroes never die! *for a price* "" 

Yet they cost the same.

This is obviously a very minor example, another one would be the wolf-themed Hanzo skins that transform the spirit dragons, to wolves, and even change the voiceline.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Goals:

* Improve Magneto's survivability by enhancing his thematic powers that have been iconic to his character since issue #1 while adding a specialization to his ""Electromagnetic Field"" power that will allow him to have a multitude of options on the battlefield. 

* Build upon his mastery of magnetism and manipulation of metal by adding bonuses against robots and projectiles (aka guns) and i guess technically swords?

* Make Polarity Surge and Magnetic Eruption viably powerful abilities almost like ""mini signatures"" similar to Juggernaut's intended Elbow Drop, or a bigger ""Optic Devastation"" from cyclops. They currently aren't in any optimal build due to both undertuning, and lack of the ability to reach rank 50. 

* Make Magneto have some unique playstyles rewarding skill rotations and risk taking similar to SS's EMF, and fix up some clunky stuff like throwing dem sentinel parts.

* Have a ton of versatile specializations. I know some people may be sick of them, but I really think it adds a true, custom fit to your playstyle. You don't have to follow the optimal builds or what everyone else is sticking to. You make it YOUR playstyle and how YOU want to play your very own Magneto. 

* **I want to ask you what you think about stance dancing. **I think it's unique and adds a ""mechanical skill effort"" to Magneto, yet others may disagree and say it's just another non optimal ability that is a hassle to dance especially with the lack of a second skill bar. It could be a passive or a toggle. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Uniques**

I find Magneto's Slot 2-4 still BiS for him. While they could use some tuning work to reach more updated heroes, I will not go over that. 

Instead I wanted to touch upon more ""important"" changes to his iconic but lesser used uniques. 

* **The Sins of Magnus** Unique has been updated with the following:

+8 Ranks to Polarity Surge

+8 Ranks to Magnetic Eruption

+10% Reflect chance

+10% damage against Robots

+10% damage reduction against Robots

+10% chance when you are hit by a melee attack, to imprison that enemy for 2 seconds dealing bleed damage twice a second. 

Explanation:  Instead of giving Magneto an advantage against robots in his innate kit, I think tying all or at least most of it to a unique will give players the chance and thought to bring this unique not only in all/most situations, but particularly those where Magneto will strive against both robotic lifeforms, and pesky homo sapien guns. In addition, this will add the much needed power points to both Polarity Surge and Magnetic Eruption to help them reach maximum power. 

* **Age of Apocalypse Helmet** has been updated with the following:  

+6 Ranks to God Among Insects

+6 Ranks to Superiority

Intelligence 1 --&gt; 2

Chance to ignore Mental attacks 5% --&gt; 10%

Damage reduction from Mental attacks 5% --&gt; 10%

Explanation:  Also easily replaced by other uniques, which is fine, these changes are aimed towards giving Magneto a buff to his survivability thematically against mental attacks which are rare but still useful. This also gives him ranks to his toggle/stance in case players are unable to max them out as well (which they shouldn't be able to.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Electromagnetic Field** 

Curent Rank: 50

* Enables ""Shields"" 

**Passive Effect:**

Defense Rating: +3,186

Total Defense Rating: +20% 

Deflect Rating: +3,186 

Total Deflect Rating: +20% 

Projectile Reflection Chance: 10% 

Restore 12 Spirit when you deflect or reflect a projectile 

**Active Effect:**

Stun Duration: 2.5s (irresistible) 

Stops all nearby missiles and projectiles for 5s 

NEW: Reflects the next boss projectile back in the direction it came from 

Cooldown: 20s

**Shields**

* Half of Magneto's health is now converted into ""shields"". Cosmetically, this will look like Dr. Doom's resource bar, but on the health side, split with red and purple/blue accordingly. 

* Shield is separate from health, it does not gain any benefits from healing in any way, and doesn't benefit from Dodge rating, but has 50% increased Defense and Deflect rating. 

* Shield is equal to 50% of Magneto's total health.

* Shield is damaged before health.

* Shield makes Magneto immune to Damage over time abilities as long as Shield is up.

* Shield makes Magneto immune to crowd control as long as the Shield is up.

* If any single instance of damage were to destroy Magneto's remaining Shield, the excess damage is prevented. (Magneto can not be one shot, it will take away all his shields). 

* Shield regenerates after not taking damage for **3** seconds at 20% per second. 

**PROS**

* Shield can take more hits than health due to increased defense/deflect rating. 

* Shield cannot take damage from damage over time and makes him immune to crowd control (poisons and fire in stuff) 

* Shield will prevent excess damage from ""one-shots""

* Will regenerate on its own

**CONS**

* Shield cannot be healed through med packs, life on hit, or other means of ""healing"". 

* Shield does not benefit from dodge rating

* Shields can only be replenished after not taking damage for a few seconds. This can be accomplished by not taking damage due to leaving combat, any enemies stop attacking magneto due to a taunt, Magneto going invulnerable, Magneto going invisible etc. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Electromagnetic Field Specializations**

Three specializations that one can opt for changing the above resource Shields.

**Scrap Shield** - Magneto no longer has a Shield but instead has armor. (Reduces damage by 25% while active, similar to Colossus)

* Excess Debris regenerates Magneto's Scrap Shield

* Electromagnetic cosmetic is gone, instead Magneto uses the debris as physical shields

* Bonus deflect rating and % rating reduced to 0 from this ability

* Bonus defense rating and % rating is doubled (6,372) and 40% increase

* Reflect chance of 10% is gone

* Deflect chance of 20% is increased to 30%

* 10% chance for enemies to take bleed damage twice per second for 2 seconds when they attack Magneto or his allies with a melee attack. 


**Repelling Bastille** - Magneto **no longer** has shields equal to 50% of his health. 

* Every 3 seconds Magneto sends out a magnetic pulse that knocks back all enemies a set distance away from Magneto

* Magneto gains boss-tag Missle Shield

* Bonus defense rating and % rating reduced to 0 from this ability

* Bonus deflect rating and % rating is doubled (6,372) and 40% increase


**Mutantkind Shield** - Magneto's shields are reduced to 10% of his maximum health (90% health, 10% shields) and all nearby **allies in your party** have 10% of their health converted into shields. 

* Max meat grinders = 4

* Allies and Magneto in Meat Grinder and Storm of Steel have +15% Deflect Rating

* Meat Grinder and Storm of Steel have a 10% chance to reflect projectiles

* Non-boss enemies cannot enter the area of Meat Grinder/Storm of Steel 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Debris**

Now I want to touch on debris a bit. It's an interesting secondary resource with a simple 25/50/75/100 gameplay to it and the creation of debris through abilities as well as destruction.

At first, it was a little silly to me that Magneto gains a great amount of sustained dps depending on his actual surroundings in game (and therefore a lack of in situations like raids). But it makes sense, thematically. 

Regardless, I think debris could use some touching up, most specifically in the option of debris creating powers, as well as the hindrance of having to manually pick them up with movement. 

* Hero Synergy - Orb pickup radius ~~10%~~ --&gt; 100% 

10% is nothing. Think of how close you have to be to pick up an exp orb. 10% is nothing, while 100% is double (which is still really next to nothing). I think this change however will be very useful if one has trouble viewing and picking up debris. Another option is for players to use certain powers to pick them up which at this time isn' t dps optimal but changes can be made. 

* Unused Abilities

Other than 'Magnetic Attraction' which is very useful for leveling and AoE, many of Magnus's abilities are not picking yet have very nice utility attached to them. 

The best thing to do is steal their utility (due to a lack of one pointer) and add them onto others while making room for more abilities that Magneto needs, while not filling up more than one power bar. 

As for basic abilities, I think are fine to keep for a Hero, but they need to be implemented into late game kits better.

The abilities not used by most players (aka 99% of the ones that know what they are doing)

Are:

* Metal Tempest

* Magnetic Distortion ( a basic)

* Magnetic Vortex

* Compressed Shrapnel

* On a lesser extent, Magnetic Attraction (i used it for leveling and cosmic prestiging Magneto, but don't use it otherwise.)

My solution to these are to like mentioned before, steal their utility and add it to other abilities. I will do this by adding a specialization to Waste Not to clear up his basic abilities without stealing a power bar, while tempest , vortex, and compressed shrapnel will be specializations of Meat Grinder.

This will be seen in the abilities section. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Powers/Abilities**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Superiority/God Among Insects** - Earlier I asked what you as the community wants. Should we keep stance dancing? should we just make it a toggle to save 20 power points? should it be a passive that activates by itself? What do you think?

[spoiler]

My current ideas are.

1. Keep stance dancing. Find a way to make room for it on the power bar and have players manually toggle to add some ""hard to play"" to Magneto

2. Make it a toggle. Same as stance dancing but it will be combined into one ability to free up 20 power points. Players would toggle it depending on their power rotation. 

3. Make it a passive. Simply, when you have many debris, the game assumes you are going to spend it and thus God Among Insects will take effect giving you damage rating for spending powers. Whereas, if you are low on debris, the game assumes you are going to generate some and gives you the damage bonus to debris generating powers. HOWEVER, isn't this just the same as adding a flat damage rating to Magneto in general? well NO! The difference would, you can ""stack"" the damage rating IF you are able to both spend AND build the debris fast enough. If you have an abundance of debris and are generating them too often, it wouldn't be efficient. Vice versa, if you are spending them too much and aren't generating enough, you are both losing out on optimal dps in hard hitting debris spending abilities, as well as a damage bonus from generating them.

**Personally, I like #3.** I don't think adding/pressing one button in a skill rotation is a skill cap because you would press it the same in most rotations. It would still reward players for properly managing debris with stacking damage rating, without taking up a slot on the power bar, and 20 power points. We would still need to mentally keep the bonus alive, we just wouldn't have to manually input it. 

* God Among Insects/Superiority are now a single ability

[/spoiler]

------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Indomitable** 

[spoiler]

* NEW:  Spirit cost reduction stat increases the damage of Debris spending powers by an equal amount.

* NEW:  After debris reach 0, 1 second before any debris can be picked up (this will help Polarity Surge and Magnetic Eruption, see powers below) 

Explanation:  Debris are a unique resource not effected by spirit management. Magneto has next to no spirit issues, yet in his gear and the inefficiency of the **Energy** stat, I thought making it so any reduce in spirit cost also contributed to the damage in debris. This is a damage buff for Magneto that may actually solve a lot of his DPS without actually manually tuning a good amount of the numbers.

[/spoiler]

------------------------------------------------------------------

**Waste Not**

[spoiler]

This ability is a staple for non-impaler users. It is a no brainer ability toggle that while fire debris that you have at nearby enemies. This ability has really good dps for Magneto, but compared to other characters in the game it does lack power.

I'm not here to estimate proper tuning in what damage buff it may need, that is obviously in the developer's hands. However I do have some ideas in both adding a Specialization to Waste Not, as well as personal customization depending on how YOU want to play Magneto. 

**Firstly, toggle the cost!**

You may now toggle a sliding bar with Waste Not. This bar can be at either 0, 25, or 50. 

This number will represent at what level of debris you want your Waste Not to **STOP firing.**

**Explanation on to why this is important for your custom mag:**

If you want it to unload debris at will until you are out of ammo, have it at 0. If you want to keep 25 debris on hand at all times for say, a Meat Grinder, slide it to 25. If you somehow use a hybrid build with Spike Impale and wish to disregard a second Spike Impale or the immediate on-hand usage of Meat Grinder, slid it to 50. if you want to have a Spike Impale and Meat Grinder on hand, but spend SOME debris, then slide it to 75. 

**Specialization**

Instead of ""throwing away"" the three Basic Powers Magneto has, I thought it would be a really neat idea to simply tie them in with Waste Not! (pun intended!!!!)

Thus, I thought, why not make Waste Not fire off ranks of one of your basic powers? that way you don't miss out on the animation and people can choose how they want their debris!

So, Waste Not Specializations

* Scrap Shot - Magneto's Waste Not will fire ranks of Scrap Shot at opponents. Use this for **close range encounters**, as the three ""shotgun"" spread can land all instances at close range targets, but only one at ranged targets that aren't that big in model size.

* Wrecking Ball - Magneto's Waste Not will fire ranks of Wrecking Ball at opponents. Use this for **heavier** debris generating power. It does more single target damage to enemies and will home in at evasive ones (auto aim with Waste Not). 

* Magnetic Distortion - Magneto's Waste Not will fire ranks of Magnetic Distortion at opponents. Use this for **faster** debris generating power. Although Wrecking Ball generates more debris, you still need to pick them up by moving! Magnetic Distortion will boomerang and pick up those loose Debris for you. 

* Additional note: Waste Not, will attempt to spend to reach 0/25/50 debris. This is to help have ""less debris"" when using Polarity Surge/Magnetic Eruption. See these two powers below, they will do more damage when you have no debris. 

**Explanation**

Further customize your Magneto's Waste Not by not wasting his basic abilities!!! **Scrap Shot** can land all three projectiles at close range or big enemies, resulting in high damage! **Wrecking Ball** while slow, can home in on very dodgey enemies as well as generate the most debris! **Magnetic Distortion** is for the lazy, it will boomerang and pick up debris so you don't have to !

[/spoiler]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Blunt Instrument**

[spoiler]

This ability is the true staple of Magneto's debris generating powers. I think it is okay as is, it can hit hard and generates the Debris Magneto needs when dry.

However some small ideas:

* Blunt Instrument has a lower cast time (cut in half)

* Cooldown reduced to 3 seconds (from 4)

* Blunt Instrument generates 10 debris, increased by 1 per 5 ranks. (Rank 50 = 20 debris) 

* Blunt Instrument will also pick up 1 nearby throwable object for extra damage: Cars, benches, trash cans, logs, you name it. 

* Blunt Instrument can spawn random sentinel parts, I-bars, scrapped satellites, tanks, etc for cosmetic effect. 

[/spoiler]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Shrapnel Barrage**

Rant: 

[spoiler]

This is the move that people use with Waste Not. It deals damage, costs debris, is a spirit filler when you aren't damage layering and so it feeds the ammo for Waste Not.

You don't really use this with Spike Impale though you can, just not very optimally. 

Now Shrapnel Barrage is great, it works just like any other filler move and gives you the debris you need for your other abilities and does damage while you are done layering.

However, this and Blunt Instrument is the only place you spend Spirit right now, CRAZY RIGHT?!

I mean Polarity Surge and Magnetic Eruption need to be reworked, and my ideas on them are explained below but...

I think this means we can buff Shrapnel Barrage, by making its spirit cost higher since Magneto has that extra reserve and will be building Spirit Cost and Energy to increase his damage overall!

TALK ABOUT RECYCLED SYNERGY! &lt;3

Then I saw the Apocolypse film and thought how cool it was how Magneto was able to fire all that debris at Apocolypse. Could we bring that in-game?!?!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwpsT0veDlc

How could we make Shrapnel Barrage, grow and do heavy hits like in the film, increase its spirit, and make it the ""same"" ability. 

Could we... steal a power from Silver Surfer?!

Silver Surfer - Electromagnetic Flux:

This ability is a channel, that does more damage the longer it is held and not cancelled. While I don't want to carbon copy it, I think this could be the same for Magneto.

You start off with the barrage, and after a few seconds, other swirls of shrapnel come and join in to make a giant horizontal cyclone of metally death! 

[/spoiler]

Power Change: 

[spoiler]

* Shrapnel Barrage Damage, debris generating, and spirit cost increase by 20% per second for up to 5 seconds where it caps. 

* At max, visually, 3 ""horizontal vortexes"" of shrapnel also come from way off screen behind magneto to hit his target (similar to x-men apocalypse film). 

[/spoiler]


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Spike Impale**

[spoiler]

The ability we know and love that @Frostacus made famous!

An already devastating power, obviously tuning is in order, but I think an execute mechanic would make this ability very attractive.

* Executes Elites and below enemies who are below 10% health (at rank 50). Will execute bosses at 2.5% health or below.

[/spoiler] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Polarity Surge/Magnetic Eruption - Magnetic Attraction/Magnetic Vortex**

[spoiler]

These powers are not in the Magneto builds we see today. Of the 4 or 5 Magneto players in the game (whatsup guys!) none of them use these.

Why? 

Because they aren't optimal. 

Now we can just buff the damage alot or... make them mini-sigs that would be activated at opportune moments for max damage!

Here are the changes:

* Magnetic Attraction and Magnetic Vortex are kept as abilities in-game, but are kept at rank 1, don't need/use power points, and scale with your level instead of rank. 

**Polarity Surge**

* Now casts **Magnetic Vortex** where your cursor is. This will bring all enemies together before blasting them to oblivion with this massive off-screen Polarity Surge hyper beam kamehameha. 

* Cooldown now 30 seconds (mini-signature)

* Damage tuned appropriately to cooldown.

* Damage increased by 1% per 1 debris **MISSING.**

* Damage increased by spirit cost reduction stat of hero

* Debris generation increased by 100% for 3 seconds after firing

* Visually, the straight line hit by the beam has slow-mo debris hovering in the air matrix style. 

* Exclusive with Magnetic Eruption

**Magnetic Eruption** 

* Now casts the first part **Magnetic Attraction** where your cursor is. This will bring all enemies to you before blasting them to oblivion like vegeta's sacrifice final explosion. 

* Cooldown now 30 seconds (mini-signature) 

* Damage tuned appropriately to cooldown

* Damage increased by 1% per 1 debris **MISSING.**

* Damage increased by spirit cost reduction stat of hero

* Debris generation increased by 100% for 3 seconds after firing

* Visually, after the explosion everything around Magneto has slow-mo debris hover in the air matrix style. 

* Exclusive with Magnetic Eruption

**Explanation**

These abilities are now long-cooldown mini-signatures that can hit REALLY hard.

You will want to use this AFTER spending all your available debris, and before generating more. This will reward players who fit it into their rotation after efficiently spending all available debris with ""no leftovers"". 

[/spoiler]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Compressed Shrapnel/Metal Tempest**

Rant: 

[spoiler]

Some people may get iffy on this subject because of the say, 4 or 5 magneto players out there, 1 of you I think may like these abilities. 

Optimal builds suggest these aren't use at all however, and so I was thinking what could be done with them? Even if they were used in a build, there is actually no room for it on the power bar of 8 slots, that gaz wants to keep. You have: 1. Movement power 2. Vulnerable Application (imprison) 3. DoT layer (meat grinder) 4. Blunt Instrument 5. Signature 6. Polarity Surge/Magnetic Eruption 7. Spike Impale/Shrapnel Barrage 8. a choice between stance toggling, travel power, crowd control immune, or electromagnetic field's stun.

But it's OKAY to have abilities that aren't used right? or should we try and avoid that and make everything an option?

This is where I'm stumped guys, because if you have debris you are using Spike Impale or Waste Not is using the ammo, but if you lack debris you are busy generating it, so where would these abilities fit in? Compressed Shrapnel doesn't meat the damage of Waste Not OR Spike Impale but is aoe, is there something there? should it be a 3rd option for debris spending dps? Metal Tempest is simply a slow and spirit spender that deals okay damage, 40% attack speed is actually pretty damn good!

I think the best thing to do is take a risk and actually make it a third option as a debris spender but combine the abilities. 

You can fire 4 bursts of Compressed Shrapnel before running out of debris.

[/spoiler]

Power change: 

[spoiler]

**SO here's what I suggest.**

* The abilities are combined. When you are OUT of Debris it will act as Metal Tempest, slowing movement AND attack speeds by 40%. When you HAVE debris, it will act as Compressed Shrapnel. 

* It will serve as the hybrid dps option. Shrapnel Barrage generates debris and does damage. Spike Impale spends debris and does damage. This ability will spend debris but do a different kind of ability when you have no debris on hand. 

I think it needs some kinks worked out like maybe making Compressed Shrapnel ALWAYS crit while Spike Impale hits harder with the standard CHANCE to crit. 

All in all this one isn't flushed out yet but I think combining the ability and making it act differently depending on your debris on hand is a cool idea instead of choosing ONLY between Spike Impale and Shrapnel barrage as your dps ""filler"" when you are not busy layering. 

[/spoiler]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Storm of Steel/Fall of Man

[spoiler]

Last, but certainly not least. Magneto's signature ability, Storm of Steel, is very powerful. it is almost a screen-wide aoe ability that deals MASSIVE damage. The strength in this ability really lies in the fact that Power Duration effects it. This is rare among signatures since they aren't usually duration based, or specify that the power does not benefit off of the power duration stat. 

Then we have Fall of Man, while thematically cool, it does very bad damage on top of a really lame aftermath (where you throw the sentinel parts manually).

Now I think the Signature is fine, but the Ultimate? there are so many problems. It of course lacks damage, but it also hinders you because you are intended to throw the sentinel parts for massive damage yet they don't do that much damage. You are much better using your own powers than bothering to throw anything just like in-game with the environment. Considering this is an ultimate ability this should change... it's hard enough to find the parts on the floor and click on them with everything going on on screen.

My solution?

Combine them. 

Magneto's new signature could be that he drops the Sentinels for burst damage, THEN starts Storm of Steel (damage tuned appropriately obviously). Then, with Blunt Instrument's new mechanic (it will auto-pickup a nearby object, aka sentinel part in this case) and throw it upon the next cast. 

Perhaps make it so Magneto can interact with throwable objects during his Storm of Steel channel?

---------------------------------------------------------------

SO that leaves us with his ultimate. 

My idea?

Brotherhood of mutants. 

Make Magneto's ultimate a summon, like a midtown madness boss fight.

*Magneto calls upon his brotherhood of mutants, aiding him in battle to ultimately bring down the soon to be extinct species of homo sapien*

* Blob will alternate between punches, body slamming across the battlefield for stuns, and taunting enemies

* Toad will attack from both melee and range, with jump kicks and tongue lashes. He will also look to ensnare and squeeze the life of nearby bosses and elites. 

* Pyro will do his thing and light everything on fire. Everything. 

* Avalanche will knock enemies down and disrupt enemies on the battlefield by keeping them crowd controlled while also dropping nearby debris on enemies. 


[/spoiler]


**TL;DR** 

* Half of max health is converted to shields, which can't be healed but has more defense and deflect rating, cc immunity and dot immunity

* 3 of his basic attacks can be specialized choices that will be fired along with waste not

* Spirit cost reduction = damage on his debris spending abilities (similar to spiderman's dodge and emma's defense equating to damage) Energy works

*  Polarity Surge/Magnetic Eruption have a 30s cd with massive damage that does more when you have less debris. They also cast a version of magnetic vortex/attraction 

* superiority/god among insects are now one ability

* blunt instrument throws nearby car with it

* uniques grant power points that allow other abilities to reach rank 50 that were not possible before. ",marvelheroes,Magneto Rework v2,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelheroes/comments/4p1rll/magneto_rework_v2/

* They fucked up the Volt rework. Sorry, i had to say it.

It is easier to max out and collect heroes, at a trade off. You compare this to other games, Future Fight? grind for days to max out a character and ""brainless brawling"". Contest of champions? you can't pick WHO you want to unlock 99% of the time just like MAA2, HOWEVER, you get your favorite character? too bad he's at 1/2 stars FOREVER. No way to upgrade him. MAA2? once you have a hero you are not limited to maxing out that character. 

* This patch brought a lot of ""ninja"" things yes. I'm not sure if this losing stats on leveling up is a bug, but in my eyes it might actually be a balance change to try and put heroes in a more diverse place. I think if we saw BW or Wasp leveling up and not getting as much evasion, it would be a clear indicator of attempts at balance as opposed to bugs. Though this level 1 shard thing is a pretty severe bug. I'm just trying to be optimistic. 

* Keep in mind, yes the game crashes a lot. However, there aren't that many bugs. Yes you can state the major bugs going on now, but if you compare this to the drastic amount in other mobile games, MAA2 actually is one of the few games that puts quality before quantity and I'm trying to enjoy it.

While we do have ""need healing"" and ""group up"" some people want to point out a Widowmaker they have spotted in a far corner of the map, or that they have spotted a Reaper coming from a certain direction so you want to notify them of the danger.

Some of honest have even come forth admitting that they just lob arrows in a general direction and cross their fingers and that's fine!

Also some people are upset about the hitbox of his arrows not being spot on. My answer to this is that, say Hanzo IS underpowered (reason why he isn't picked in competitive most likely), now what if they wanted to buff the arrows hitbox? well it would look weird if Hanzo suddenly shot giant titan arrows and thus for balancing purposes, sure the hitbox is a little bigger than the arrow shows.

-------------------------------------------------

Anyways, after watching the [Dragons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ09xdxzIJQ&amp;t=3m22s) and thought it was REALLY cool how Hanzo could curve his arrows to shoot people from an unexpected angle.

Geometry of the sorts.

So my idea was, what if after landing Hanzo's arrows would ""lock on"" to his Sonic Arrow?

After placing it, it would not only grant Hanzo vision, but his arrows would ""attempt"" to curve towards the target location of the Sonic Arrow, similar to tracer rounds. 

Maybe even cap it to the next 3 arrows or something.

I think this would not only be a neat buff for Hanzo, but would build upon his very unique playstyle of being able to hit enemies from around corners and without direct line of sight (already existing in both Scatter Shot and his ultimate).

Other champs in the game can build mana and cooldown reduction and end up with the same result without a blue buff.

Similarly, ad champs had the red pot option before death's dance came out as an item that does it too.

The POINT of energy is that you don't need to build mana items, yes, but it also means you have to be wary about spamming your abilities, aka, you will run out of energy.

but let's not lie to ourselves. 99% of the time they are dead and or ignored. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My idea for Magneto is to fulfill a few things

1. **Electromagnetic Field/Shield** - Buffing it and turning it into an actual shield mechanic that is both thematic to Magneto (in my opinion is most iconic, only second to lifting metal) as well as the key to Magneto's survivability. 

2. **Turn Polarity Surge and Magnetic Eruption into viable mini-sigs** - These two abilities were supposed to be long, 8/10 second cooldown abilities that offered Magneto a large burst of damage. Because of their hindered tuning, it's actually more optimal to lay down DoT's and simply fire from Waste Not, and Shrapnel Barrage and sometimes even Spike Impale. These abilities need to become exclusive AND more powerful and have Magneto's abilities revolve around them. 

3. **Diversity** Like all heroes, there is usually one straight build that everyone opts for with little variation. The exception are characters like Spiderman, Gambit, Doctor Doom, Juggernaut, Iron Fist, and heck maybe even Venom and Black Panther. But there are ""viable"" characters in the game that will pretty much go for one build, like Cap, Cyclops, War Machine, etc. For some characters I think that's fine, but others like Bucky should have access to more abilities and not be exclusive to a single damage type. **In Magneto's case** most of his shrapnel abilities are picked, rather than his magnetism ones. I hope to change that. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Electromagnetic Field/Shield**

The idea behind this is to not change the ability, but add a Shield mechanic to Magneto. Overall, number tuning needs to be buffed sure, you could imagine both a Defense and Deflect rating buff but that's known and easy to do they just have to go about doing it.

But raw numbers to facetank abilities shouldn't be the only thing in game.

Shields historically in video games differ from health in a few ways. Usually, obviously health restore/life on hit/potions/med packs don't effect them at all. Shields work independently and are usually depleted before health can be depleted. Lastly, they recharge by themselves at an enhanced rate and may even have different damage resistances than actual health. 

I think this is a mechanic that can exist on many characters in the Marvel universe, like Iron Man, Cable and Nova, but also a variant of ""Armor"" that would work on Colossus, Moon Knight, and War Machine.

Similar to the game Overwatch if anyone knows of it.

**Shields**

Character has a shield equal to 150* the level. (level 60 = 9,000 point shield).

Character's base health is reduced by 25%

* Shield's uniques effects stop working when depleted 

* Shields prevents all damage and effects from damage over time

* Shields have double your character's Defense and Deflect rating

* Shields only regenerate when ~~out of combat~~ not taking damage for 5 seconds ( at 10% per second)

SO?

The advantages are obviously a massive add on of a health pool that mitigates damage really well.

The downside? in prolonged engagements Shield does nothing after being worn down. One would have to ""tactically"" retreat to recharge shields before returning to the fray. 

The character can do this by crowd controlling the opponent and leaving the damage area, becoming invisible, invulnerable, simply not taking damage. This is different from being out of combat. 

I think adding shields would heavily bolster the defenses needed of many characters but still punish ranged characters for wanting to face tank for too long without recharging. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Electromagnetic Field Specializations**

Three specializations that one can opt for. 

1. Scrap Shield - Magneto's Shield instead acts as Armor. This shield instead has 100 points. One instance of damage from Bosses will deal 10 points max per attack. One instance of damage from Elites will deal 5 points max per attack. Normal enemies can deal a max of 1 point of damage per attack. 

Excess Debris regenerates Magneto's Scrap Shield

Electromagnetic *cosmetic* is gone, instead Magneto uses the debris as physical shields

2. Electromagnetic Shield - Magneto's Shield converts all Deflection rating into Reflection. The shield has 75 points per level instead of 150. Every time Magneto's shield takes damage, it gains a 1% damage reduction for 10 seconds stacking up to 50 times. 

Dealing energy damage can restore Magneto's shield by 400 per hit capped per second

Electromagnetic *cosmetic* is a permanently aura sphere around Magneto

3. Mutantkind Shield - Magneto no longer has shields himself. Instead, Magneto's Meat Grinders gain double Magneto's deflection rating and all deflections are turned into reflections

Meat Grinders cannot stack against projectiles but can be dispersed throughout the battlefield

Electromagnetic *cosmetic* is gone


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Polarity Surge and Magnetic Eruption**

So as I said earlier these abilities are currently not optimal to invest in.

They should act like any other 8-10 second damage ability like Captain America, or Cyclops have that you expect to wipe the floor with enemies elites or not, but don't want to use your signature on them.

My idea for these abilities is to make them semi-sig nukes, increasing their damage but in turn their cooldown.

That's not enough though, both abilities are linear skill shots that simply do. damage. 

Let's make them have a ""unique"" mechanic. 

**Polarity Surge**

Cooldown = 20 seconds (15 if you have God Among Insects) 

+100% damage (double the cooldown from before so doubling the damage balances that out)

Deals +10% damage for each enemy hit up to +100% damage

Defeats enemies under 10% health who are non-bosses

Deals 25% bonus damage to enemies who are vulnerable

Deals 25% bonus damage to enemies who are weakened

Counts as a Debris spender

Restores Debris to 100

So the idea behind this ability is to make you do more damage if you are going to hit more enemies. What's special about this is that a Magneto player may want to actually use Magnetic Vortex in your build. 

By using Imprison, AND Magnetic Vortex before a Polarity Surge, Magneto players would gain a damage bonus from Vulnerable units (via imprison), damage bonus from Weakened units (via Magnetic Vortex) and bonus damage for each enemy hit (Magnetic Vortex pulls enemies in one place, Imprison keeps them there, Polarity Surge finishes them off.)

**Magnetic Eruption**

Cooldown = 20 seconds (15 if you have Superiority)

+100% damage (double the cooldown form before so doubling the damage balances that out)

Each Magnetic Eruption does more damage than the last up to +100% damage

Enemies recently hit by Magnetic Eruption will be targeted by Waste Not, and Waste Not becomes a pass through ability when hitting them.

Spike Impale will hit everyone surrounding the target who has been hit by Magnetic Eruption in the past 5 seconds

Counts as Debris generator

Restores Debris to 100

So the idea behind this ability is to instead reward positioning and lining up Magneto himself, rather than having to group his enemies. A Magneto player would want to memorize the range of his Magnetic Eruption, know that the last burst will do the most damage. In addition to this, both Waste Not and Spike Impale users will have greater benefit post-Magnetic Eruption to clean up any mess and dish out the remaining DPS.

**Comparisons**

Polarity Surge does more, ""easy"" damage overall. If you combo the Magnetic Vortex --&gt; Imprison --&gt; Polarity Surge you will pretty much guarantee anything that is not a boss, will die. 

Magnetic Eruption does less damage at the beginning building up to a burst at the end. The advantage this has over Polarity Surge is after using the ability, your Waste Not and Spike Impale pretty much become AoE. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Waste Not**

This ability now has 3 specializations to pick from.

1. Waste Not fires your rank of Wrecking Ball for free (Generates more debris and essentially recycles them for Waste Not)

2. Waste Not fires your rank of Compressed Shrapnel for free (Increased damage overall since Compressed Shrapnel has crit damage)

3. Waste Not fires your rank of for free (Utility/defensive that slows enemy's movement AND attack speed)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Spike Impale** 

Ability now has 10% execution against non-bosses (if enemy is brought below 10% health AFTER Spike Impale deals damage, they will be defeated)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Magnetic Distortion**

Can now ""feed"" Meat Grinder, making it bigger in radius and increasing its duration. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Fall of Man/Storm of Steel** 

During Storm of Steel, Magneto can freely throw Sentinel parts from Fall of Man and can cast Blunt Instrument. 

Choosing to not throw Sentinel parts will rebuild the Sentinel at the end, providing Magneto with a Mega-Sentinel of his own (Similar to Red Skull Cosmic).

All these PBE changes are going to make Viktor so... CLUNKY. 

What I think they need to do...

* Remove the standstill to cast. It is counter intuitive to his augment which gives him movement speed for landing it. Then makes the next auto attack laser the enemy over 3 seconds (a leash). As long as vik stays in range. This will be more damage overall, but less burst (which seemed to be his problem). This would work on towers too.

* Make W ground enemies like the new Cass does. It's a gravity field so it makes sense. Maybe nerf the slow slightly, that way you can still walk out of it but need to instantly decide which direction you are walking out of. Rylais on Viktor would improve the chances of slowing them with his other spells to keep them in the W.

* His new E is just turning it into a differently aimed Vel'koz W with no 2nd charge. I get that making a delay, means you are delaying burst but it's a lame idea. Instead make a single target take more damage as opposed to a group. Move some of the initial damage to a burn. 

* His R, like Annie's should be, should be tossed, not instant. Instant silences have historically always been bad for the game. It would be a small but noticeable delay for counter play. Increase the range, the storm damage, but lower the initial.

The idea is to simply give the Exalted Weapons a duration, and a cooldown. This will allow you to only use them in dangerous, opportune moments. In exchange, we can buff the weapons exceptionally number wise. 

-----------------------------------------------------

Duration: 60 seconds 

Cooldown: 60 seconds

Adding duration would increase both the duration of the ability AND its cooldown. So be careful when modding. 

Unpopular opinion, but I honestly think the Exalted Blade is stupidly overpowered.

Valkyr is already invincible and i love her so don't hate me. But that 500 armor rating could be 1, or 1,000 it doesn't matter. This means using the ability is like being wolverine without a healing factor (or his fighting style regardless) where you actually put yourself at risk. Use it smartly, and make sure you clear the room.

Excalibur. Auto block from the front, I guarantee you 99% of Exalted Blade kills are from the energy waves, NOT the blade. 

Wukong. Okay he honestly sucks. Let's double/triple the range of his Bo Staff so it actually does something and isn't outclassed by excalibro. 

---------------------------------------------------------

**The changes?**

Firstly, since Body Count doesn't work on them. Body Count is now innate. Cause fuck the flawed system in the first place. 

Secondly, 50% increased channeling efficiency. I think the mechanic is flawed and outdated so consider it a bandaid until melee 2.5/3.0

Lastly, increased movement speed/slide. Trust me, it does wonders. 

---------------------------------------------------------

**Valkyr**

* Since she is already invincible, let's add some risk. Hysteria brings you to 1 health. You will want to regenerate this through the duration or you... die. 

* One-shot nulli bubbles because fuck you nulli bubbles. If i carefully slash at the bubble with my cat claws (at that range) i deserve some credit. 

* Convert damage type to mainly if not all slash. **When channeling:** Increase base status chance to 50%. Lastly, add an indicator above an enemies heads that will tell you if the current bleed will kill the target. That way you can slash your way through a room and if everyone has the symbol you can leave the stragglers to bleed out and heal yourself. 

* Charge attacks perform a finisher. 

-------------------------------------------------------------

**Excalibur**

* Exalted Blade/Melee attacks restore energy.

* Energy waves now **only occur when channeling.** or for charge attacks. 

* The other combos nobody uses, that have more wind up and variant slashes, have increased damage multipliers that also apply to the energy waves.

* Slash Dash still fires energy waves

* Radial Javelin during Exalted Blade, will leave enemies impaled. If you melee attack or slash dash impaled enemies you will remove the javelin for extra damage

--------------------------------------------------------

**Wukong**

* Primal Fury's maximum range is now effected by range mods. Max changed from 200% - 300% by default. So with stretch it can be increased to 400%. 

* Will also attempt to block enemies depending on range of weapon, not just bullets targetted at you (diminishes in effectiveness greatly but expect to hit that straying bombard rocket if you are flurrying enough)

* Channeled slam attacks will cause Wukong to bounce and carry momentum. AKA Radial Pogo Stick. 

* Charge attacks hit home runs. 

----------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion:

By making these exalted weapons duration based, then with a cooldown, it makes the abilities have more meaning and powerful up times. Right now people just whip them out with max energy efficiency and duration, then spam melee all day with no gameplay. 

This change will make it so you actually use your other weapons and save your exalted for when the moment really calls for it. 

In exchange, massive power can be added to these abilities both strength, utility, and feature wise since they will have less up time.

**Passives**

(It is stated in the Riot Code of Champion Design that all champions must possess a multi-functional passive during conception post 2015. This includes any and all reworks. See chapter 1337, section sw18, paragraph 4, line 3). 

**Passive 1 - Runic Armor**

Galio gains bonus ability power equal to 30% of his magic resistance.

Galio gains bonus flat magic/armor penetration equal to 30% of his armor.

**Passive 2 - Goyle Gauntlet** 

**Every other** one of Galio's basic attacks knock his target back. These attacks grant 3% damage reduction for 5 seconds, stacking a maximum of 5 times. (max 15%, continuing attacks refresh the duration) 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Resolute Smite**

**Passive** (you thought they were done.)

Galio's basic attacks against *out of range* targets under 10% health, gain 300 range, turning the damage into magic damage + 5% of Galio's ap. 

**Active**

RANGE: 900 / 235 

MANA COST: 60 / 65 / 70 / 75 / 80 

COOLDOWN: 7 Seconds

Galio fires a concussive blast at the target area, dealing magic damage to enemies hit slowing them for 2.5 seconds.

MAGIC DAMAGE: 80 / 120 / 160 / 200 / 240 (+ 60% AP). 

*If Resolute Smite is cast along a Righteous Gust its range, damage and speed are increased by 30%.* 

SLOW: 24 / 28 / 32 / 36 / 40%

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Protector's Bulwark**

RANGE: 800 

COST: 60 MANA

COOLDOWN: 18/17/16/15/14 Seconds

ACTIVE: Galio grants himself or an allied unit 30 / 45 / 60 / 75 / 90 bonus armor and magic resistance for 4 seconds, and heals ~~himself~~ them every time Bulwark's target takes damage, up to a maximum of 3 times. 

This cooldown is halved if cast on Galio himself and all 3 heals were made. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Righteous Gust**

RANGE: 1100

MANA COST: 60 / 65 / 70 / 75 / 80

COOLDOWN: 13 / 12 / 11 / 10 / 9

ACTIVE: Galio charges for **up to** 4 seconds, halving his movement speed while charge, then unleashing a gust of wind in the target direction, dealing magic damage to enemies hits, and leaving behind a directional draft for 4 seconds which grants allies bonus movement speed when they pass through it.

If Galio charged the gust for the full duration, he alone will immediately being to travel with the wind to its end point. 

MAGIC DAMAGE: 60 / 100 / 140 / 180 / 220 (+ 50% AP)

BONUS MOVEMENT SPEED: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40%

----------------------------------------------------

**Idol of Durand**

RANGE: 600 / 575 

MANA COST: 100  

COOLDOWN: 150 / 120 / 90

MINIMUM MAGIC DAMAGE: 200 / 300 / 400 (+ 60% AP)

BONUS MAGIC DAMAGE PER HIT: 20 / 30 / 40 (+ 6% AP)

ACTIVE: Galio turns into a statue and channels for 2 seconds, ~~halving incoming damage and~~ taunting nearby enemies for the duration, which they cannot mitigate with crowd control reduction. Idol of Durand can't be cancelled by movement commands for the first 0.25 seconds of its duration if it strikes at least one enemy champion.

When the channel ends, Galio bursts out of his statue form and deals magic damage to nearby enemies, increased by 10% for each basic attack he received while channeling, up to a maximum 80% increase. If the channel is canceled or interrupted, Galio deals magic damage in a smaller radius.

Galio will cast Bulwark onto himself automatically, this will put the ability on cooldown. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TL;DR/Conclusion/Explanation:**

* Nerf to MR passive, and basic spell base damages.

* New passive: armor gives some penetration

* Every other melee punch knocks ppl back like gravesy making gal a bit tankier. (For attk speed cheese galio)

* Q - Small range nerf. Lower base damage overall. Gives passive which lets you range basic attack low health targets (aka minions for last hitting) with laser eyes. Now works like Jayce range Q can be accelerated with E.

* W - much longer early level cooldown. Heal isn't mitigated but can only occur 3 times. Half cooldown if Gal put on himself and all 5 heals were proc'd. 

* E - Lower base damage, small range nerf, 1s duration nerf, 10% movement speed nerf. Can now be charged like Xerath Q, if charged to full Galio will travel along the wind and flies

* R - Lower cooldown later in game. no longer takes half damage but auto casts bulwark putting it on cooldown. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TL;DR explanation:**

Nerfs to mr passive, damage numbers across the board, and miniscule range nerfs in exchange for:

1. armor gives penetration, melee attacks knock back target and gives small resistance stacks. 

2. Q passive lets you last hit from range

3. less cd on W when used on itself and hit. Heal no longer reduced but capped at 3 times. 

4. E lets you fly over terrain (big buff) also Q along an E accelerates it like Jayce

After Nagato uses all his charges OR activates the Ultimate again, he will pull in all hooked targets, then gains 100% attack speed to his attacks for 5 seconds. Breaking line of sight with Nagato will remove the chain.

**Story**

*Long ago there were three dragons of Jade, Sapphire, and Ruby. Worshiped by three corners of Japan, they lived in harmony until one of the dragons grew jealous of the other's powers. Defeated by a lone warrior and the other dragons, Ruby was cast out, and imprisoned. It was then when the dragons decided to depart our world, leaving behind the power of dragons for this warrior who would pass this power secretly, until now* 

One of the last practitioners of the [Kusarigama](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/32/62/98/3262988b88de6433c6a6db1390587de5.jpg), Nagato has plans for the world that can only succeed with the downfall of Overwatch and its members. 

The forgotten middle child of the Shimada clan family, Nagato was the result of the clan's leader's secret lover. To protect his legacy, Nagato and his mother were assassinated through the use of poisons. Nagato was found by a rogue ninja clan known as the Narazumono, who believed he would not survive an infamous venom that there was no coming back from. Somehow, the castaway survived and was taught lost and forbidden arts stolen from the Shimada clan and put into use by the Narazumono.

Under confrontation between the two clans, the Narazumono were slaughtered left and right, with only Nagato remaining. Hope was lost and the young ninja's life was on edge, until an unknown fire grew within the boy. A red dragon rose from his skin, empowering him, allowing him to overcome the attacking ninja. With his Kusarigama, Nagato slayed 37 ninja that day, whose last member told him that the dragon power the boy harnessed only existed within the blood of a Shimada. 

Bent on taking revenge, and his rightful place in the Shimada clan, Nagato surprisingly discovered that his apparent father had just died, his younger sibling dead, and his older sibling abandoning the clan. In the clan's ashes, Nagato told all that he was meant to rule, showing off the dragon power that all of the Shimada clan bowed to. 

To secure the bloodline, Nagato seeks to eliminate his lost brother Hanzo.

So I know a lot of people are complaining about tanks building Iceborn Gauntlet + Sunfire cape to wreck just about anything squishy. 

This item isn't for that.

This is an item designed for Juggernauts who want to fight in the front lines vs other high health targets.

This is because even though armor, is a good counter to any ad champs (The juggernauts being Garen, Darius, Illaoi, Skarner, and on a lesser note maybe even Skarner), health is an even better counter a lot of the times since these champs tend you build Black Cleaver, and can get many ticks down to shred that. This is also true for Darius's innate armor penetration, and both his and Garen's ult not excelling against health but ""going through"" armor. 

----------------------------------------------------------------

Items that excel against **health** tanks are the following:

* Blade of the Ruined King - % Health damage

* Lord Dominik's Regards

* Liandry's Torment

Unfortunately, unless you are an AP champion, **Blade of the Ruined King** doesn't really help Juggernauts since they are not auto attack based and don't get many opportunities to land that many auto attacks. This is an item that excels with attack speed which bruisers don't really build.'

As for **Lord Dominik's Regard**, as Juggernaut yourself, you won't be seeing much use for this since your health pool will most likely be on par with other tanks, so it's not really gold efficient. This item is more for low health champions who want to damage high health champions.

**Liandry's** torment is really only good on champions with ap ratios. Although it grants health which helps, the Juggernauts are mainly AD. 

That being said, we have an auto attack based item that excels against high health targets, an item for low health targets to excel against high health targets, and an ap item that shreds health. 

What we don't have is something for tanks to build that would help in wet noodle fights, but won't see much benefit against squishies. 

----------------------------------------------------------------

**The White Titan**

Builds out of **Phage** + **Giant Slayer** 

**Combine Cost:** 1250 

**Total Cost:** 3500

+ 25% Bonus Health

+40 Attack Damage

+20% Cooldown Reduction

UNIQUE – RAGE: Dealing physical damage grants 20 movement speed for 2 seconds. Assists on Cleaved enemy champions or kills on any unit grant 60 movement speed for 2 seconds instead. This movement speed bonus is halved for ranged champions.

UNIQUE -  Dealing Physical Damage to an enemy champions applies a stack of Maim. Upon reaching 5 stacks, your next basic attack against that champion 12% of their maximum health + 12% of your maximum health minus **THREE TIMES** the difference in physical damage. Cooldown: 8 seconds in general. Refreshes upon kill/assist.

----------------------------------------------------------------

**Examples:**

* Tank vs Tank

3,000 Health Darius vs 3,000 health Garen = 360 damage (12% of max health) + 360 damage (12% of max health) - 0 (the difference) = 720 physical damage. 

Therefore it would be good in a tank vs tank matchup of health. 

* Squishy vs Tank

2,000 health Caitlyn vs 3,000 health Darius = 240 damage (12% of max health) + 360 damage (+12% of max health) - 360 (three times the difference) = 240 physical damage

* Squishy vs Squishy

2,000 health Caitlyn vs 2,000 health Jinx = 240 damage (12% of max health) + 240 damage (12% of max health) - 0 = 480 damage.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Now obviously the item isn't good for squishies to buy against tanks. So it solves the problem if one wanted an ""op"" item to shred tanks with. You can see that Darius vs Caitlyn, both having the items, the attack would only do 240 damage. Whereas a Darius vs a Garen would do a big 720 damage. 

In a tank vs tank matchup, it would be good for them to have something that supplements their wet noodles

In a tank vs squishy matchup, that damage is the same vice versa, not being very efficient due to the triple multiplier damage reduction if a health difference occurs. 

Generally in a match, there would be a greater health difference due to item builds. ADCs wouldn't really build health, While almost every item Darius would build would grant health. 

**The main reason an ADC won't buy this item is the other stats are bad for them and it has a cooldown**

**NOT CG.**

[I'm just kidding.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH5oRJKTWuc)

In all seriousness, 

I just finished dinner and am taking a break from my studies and wanted to write this little post. 

To get down to the jist (&lt;--- HOW DO YOU SPELL DAT, IS IT LIKE CIT?) of if, I'm not here to talk about BALANCE persay, I already raged about that and I'm sure the company will have rotations of power, times when some characters fit the meta and others that fall out to nerfs that's fine, I've come to accept that that just might be the case even WHEN lacking justification.

**TL;DR** : Implement **Accuracy** stat into the game to counter evasion. This would exist in innate statistics like tenacity, on certain reworked skills, and even leader abilities. The biggest/only downside is that accuracy would serve little purpose against a non-evasive foe. All other stats in this game smartly have a counter which I commend, Tenacity VS Potency, Armor vs Armor penetration, Offense vs Defense. Evasion should too so we can build smart team compositions to specifically counter evasion teams when the time calls for it. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now,

I'm here to re propose this idea behind a stat that could be implemented called ""Accuracy"".

ACCURACY?! WHAT IS THAT?

To be honest? gimme a sec. 

[here](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=accuracy+definition)

We will be using the technical term variation of it:

**technical**

*the degree to which the result of a measurement, calculation, or specification conforms to the correct value or a standard.*

FORIZEN, I DON'T CARE, I HATE YO GUTS AND YO POSTS AND YO BORING CWAP LIKE CONCEPTS AND ANALYSIS AND BAD CHAR CONCEPTS. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SAY

Well I think the game could see a lot of health in a new innate statistic that would follow Accuracy.

This is pretty much the balance, and counteraction of the all frustrating EVASION that has become a real threat now ever since the Count Dooku leader fix. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So? oops. I forgot I was Forizen, I like to use bullets when not appropriate so here you go.

**What is Evasion?**

* All characters apparently posses an innate Evasion stats. What this is? I don't know, but every character has a chance to *completely avoid damage from an attack, including any effects that may be applied*

* Many leader abilities, and buffs, can improve these evasion chances. Whether they are additive or multiplicative, i do not know

* Evasion is simply a % chance that a character can avoid the attack. There is currently no way to manipulate a counteraction to this aside from one or two abilities that become unavoidable under the correct circumstances (Savage Opress against a low health target, and one of the lil furry shits, all their names are the same to me)

Now my problem isn't the ""bs"" that people complain about Evasion itself, but the fact that similarly to crit, it is all about luck! 

A very minimum amount of strategy comes into play when regarding a character's chance to dodge. GRANTED, technically we are all on the same playing field when it comes to RNG, but I like many are in denial and think that's bull shit (Boba dies and doesn't revive at all, or he revives 7 times in a row. There is no in between)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now the **Balance** I'm talking about isn't to keep things from being overpowered ,or underpowered, but rather a balance in nature of the game.

What I mean is, like the dark and light side of the force, like any force in general, there is always a counteraction, a reverse, and anti, you name it.

In this game?

* Offense vs Defense (Offense up, vs Defense up)

* Armor vs Armor Penetration (For the purposes of Physical Damage)

* Resistance Penetration vs Resistance (For the purposes of Physical Damage) 

* Tenacity vs Potency

* Speed up vs Speed down

* Critical Chance up vs Critical Chance down (Only in grievous though)

* Critical Damage up vs Critical Damage down (Only in grievous though)

* Technically crit damage is effected by armor and defense for the purposes of damage mitigation

HOWEVER.

There is one pesky lil [rebel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPCma8ZqZME)lious fuck of a stat that stands out and has no counter measures. PS [long live the empire, i hate rebellious fucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J92l3YQ18Fw)

DODGE RATING. Like Kylo Ren, he has a nickname and is also known as EVASION.

SO what must we do to restore balance to the force?

We must implement Accuracy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Now, another list!**


* A controlled, stat, or buff, that can be chosen (by character or skill) and be applied in a match actively picking accuracy to hinder and counteract the chances of evasion

* A new stat for everyone, yay! more unique gear, and character choices depending!

* Probably a leader which would directly counteract Dooku! (Wedge - Pilot's Aim: All allies gain 22% accuracy and have a 25% chance to gain 25% turn meter when successfully damaging an enemy) 

* More team comps, one's that revolve around evasion risk being countered by accuracy. However, an accuracy comp would have little benefit against a NON evasion comp as accuracy over 100% doesn't change much

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So how would one go about making these changes??

Well just pulling this one out of... the air, but here **for example.**

**Darth Sidious with Count Dooku lead**

Evasion = 10% innate evasion + 15% from Count Dooku leader ability (+35% when attacked by Jedi).

When facing Jedi: 

It is NOT 6 in 10 attacks will miss,

It is in every attack from a jedi there is a 60% chance that the attack will do nothing.

**Jedi Knight Anakin w/ new leader just as example** 

**Lead from the Front**

All Jedi Allies gain 18% accuracy and have a 20% chance to gain Offense up when landing an attack on an enemy, and 20% chance to gain Defense Up when taking damage from an enemy. 

Accuracy = Innate 23% (from some gear) + 18% accuracy = 41% accuracy

So against a Darth Sidious, you would have a 19% chance of landing an attack.

**BUT**

Say you have, Ahsoka, who for some reason doesn't have good accuracy but good speed and or damage, she might have:

Accuracy = 3% (from gear) + 18% accuracy = 21% accuracy and a 39% chance of landing an attack.

**SO**

On Offense, when going up against a team who is running an Evasion lead, you could pick up Anakin, or Wedge, but would think twice about the benefits of Ahsoka.

-------------------------------------------------------------

To conclude, not sure the examples were necessary but I hope you get the idea.

Some games have removed Dodge completely but I think it's a real neat stat that thematically fits star wars and can be in a much more healthy state if balanced properly. 

Again, all stats have countermeasures, Dodge rating seems to have **cough cough** *evaded* this.

To top it off, although his ultimate is very powerful, again it can't be controlled because it does bits of damage over time making you lose a lot of cs in the mean time.

My reasoning for the Sienar Holo projector drop is that not only is it the most common purple gear NEEDED (yet not easily obtained, limited through normal mission nodes) but it's required in later gear levels and in multiple instances for multiple characters!

The list? according to http://swgoh.gg/db/gear/

**Mk4 Stun Gun** - 31 characters need it

**mk-3-sienar-holo-projector** - 53 characters need it

Not a HUGE difference but a notable one right? 

But these pieces are also components of further gear upgrades.

-----------------------------------------------

**How many Mk4 Stun Guns?**

Mk4 Stun Guns by themselves needed = 31 characters

Mk4 Stun Guns turned into Mk 7 BioTech Implant = 14 characters

Mk4 Stun Guns turned into Mk 5 Nubian Design Tech = 26 characters

**Mk4Stun Guns Total characters needed for:  71 characters.**

Quite alot right?

---------------------------------------------------------

Let's look at the Mk 3 Sienar Holo Projectors:

Mk 3 Sienar Holo Projectors by themselves = 53 characters needed

Mk 3 Sienar Holo Projectors turn into Mk 7 TaggeCo Holo Lens = 33 characters

Mk 3 Sienar Holo Projectors turn into Mk 5 CEC Fusion Furnace = 64 characters

**Mk 3 Sienar Holo Projectors total characters: 150**

------------------------------------------------------

Not only is that DOUBLE the characters, it's also that many more actual pieces of gear, since they are bundled in groups of 20.

I don't know *WHY* Mk8 Neuro Binoculars are dropped. Maybe challenges shouldn't drop the most abundant amounts of gear, 

but you can't tell me it takes 3,000 Mk 3 Sienar Holo Projectors to gear up our characters and we ONLY get them from normal missions?

-------------------------------------------------------

Thoughts?

You agree or disagree?

are you using the gear you get from tank challenges still or is there an abundance? 

Is it unique to the player?

Kylo and Mace got nerfed more despite being slow, and not that good already, hypocritical to CG's said goals of slow characters hitting harder. Most justified nerf was Sid's aoe damage. Biggest fails were Kylo, Mace, and Anakin. I have no idea why Ben's damage got nerfed. 

EDIT 1: ty Slipperyroo, http://swgoh.gg/, danpaulson, and others! even you mods for my crazy posts &lt;3 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are a list of all the ""big"" nerfs pointed out by http://swgoh.gg/abilities/rebalance/.

Level 80 stats

Now, this company stated that they ""wanted to aim for fast characters hitting for less, and slow characters hitting harder"" in order to balance speed. (Obviously the wording isn't exact).

While some of the below nerfs may be justified due to these characters indeed being fast, others are very questionable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Now in a game like SWGOH, especially if you don't spend money, you REALLY REALLY have to plan AHEAD OF TIME what character you want to far for.

It's a long term investment that takes months to max out a character.

So naturally watching your beloved characters getting nerfed, will hurt, because it's not like you can revert your resources. You worked hard to achieve something that just isn't good anymore!

But i digress.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The below are the outstanding nerfs that I read on swgoh.gg

If they are indeed correct, there are many of these nerfs that frankly, I'm laughing really hard about. 

Protection is now in the game so I want to also have people consider this when reading this list.

* QGJ - Humbling Blow - -17.6% damage

* QGJ - Harmonious Assault - -17.6%

* Count Dooku - Force Lightning - -24.5%

* Count Dooku - Hindering Press - -15.4%

* Mace Windu - Smite - -12.1% damage

* Savage Opress - Overpower - -10.0%

* Savage Opress - Staggering Blow - -10.0%

* Eeth Koth - Force Push -14.4% 

* Resistance Pilot - Hip fire - -34.2%

* FOTP - Double Tap - -30.5%

* Yoda - Unstoppable Force - -33.8% 

* Yoda - Masterstroke - **-69.9%**

* Obi-wan - Elegant Form - -20.1%

* Jedi Consular - Attack as Defense - -16.3%

* Jedi Knight Anakin - Smite - -17.8%

* Darth Sidious - Demoralizing Blows - -13.4%

* Kylo Ren - Lash Out - -14..8%

* Kylo Ren - Ragged Cut - -14.8%

So going through, of course you are keeping in mind your most beloved characters and how they might suck right now.

Also, you know when you are ranking up your abilities with mats and see that glorious +15% damage buff? That list above pretty much reverses that across the board. 

Well, let's go from top to bottom and see how justified these really were.

* Qui-gon Jinn - So you get a chromium exclusive character that people spend thousands of dollars on, then make him cantina available and a monstrous hard hitting lead who is very squishy like a bubble. Sure he will cause tons of problems because he is beginning to one shot people with an assist, and grants his team offense up. Personally? I think these QGJ changes make sense. Since he'll maintain his speed and has added protection, 17% damage loss on his specials is A. LOT. But personally? i think justified quite well. QGJ Went from a very fast, very squishy, very hard hitting character, to overall just a really fast character **worth** having on your team. **I rate the ""nerf"" 2/3 stars, the nerfs being quite justified but a bit too  harsh.**

* Count Dooku - Dooku got hit HARD with his nerfs. So much in fact that you probably may not play him anymore. Hindering Press got nerfed to where, that bonus damage you got from leveling the ability up with mats?  is essentially gone. Force Lightning on the other hand had a VERY low crit chance. It did good damage but basically never crit. The stun factor is what made this ability so good. Right now if you still use Dooku, keep in mind it will be for the utlity, NOT the damage. To conclude this, I still think this was the wrong thing to nerf because people aren't abusing Dooku in the meta due to his abilities and stuns nor damage, but mainly because of this rng based (bullshit) leader ability that grants 15% evasion. Because of the leader ability being the main problem and not Dooku's kit, I think he was overlooked, **I'm going to rate this nerf 1/3 stars.** PS if you disagree, well, not only is the 15% evasion still in effect, but all characters with protection have DOUBLE the effective health they used to which in turn DOUBLED the effectiveness of Dooku's leader ability. 

* Mace Windu - Now if you've been on this subreddit for a while, this is where i feel like i make my name. On numerous occasions I've made in-depth analysis and justified threads on the state of Mace Windu and the lack of Justice he has. I won't rant about that here. What you need to know is that apparently, 1. CG Hates him for some reason. 2. He got nerfed again. I'm literally laugh crying at this but sighing at the same time. He shares the name of the ability Smite with Anakin, though both doing completely different things, Mace's does less damage now. When using Mace, opt for his Basic unless you REALLY need to remove a buff. His basic will always perform better at this point. Keep in mind, not sure how Exposed interacts with Protection right now and if it even overrides it. If it doesn't apply damage before protection is down, Mace got fukd in the ass again (sorry for the language). Regardless, the debuff appears 1-2 times a match so it's neglible. **0/3 stars** . Sorry I have to say it. Idiots. 

* Savage Opress - Now I'm not going to lie. I hover in the top 10 of my arena and run a Savage. I like him. Usually the enemy sid will aoe my team, having dooku counter that attack, while Savage gained turn meter and can execute the enemy sid right after. It's a strat that worked 90% of the time for me. I'll try not to be bias. Savage is one of the much tankier, slower characters in the game. Despite being labled as an attacker, i thought CG's intentions were to make the slow characters hit harder and fast ones hit lighter. Savage got reworked+buffed, then nerfed. You lose 10% of damage on both basic and special. On top of this nerf, Savage just dropped down the tier ladder. Why? Well because everyone has protection now. So basically if enemy's can now take DOUBLE the damage they did before, the range of total effective health your opponent needs to have for a guaranteed execute just got cut in HALF. On the other hand, Savage is even tankier, so more up time for hitting people. Honestly? I'm fine with the damage nerfs, but overpower's execute should have been buffed to say, 30 or 35% to compensate for protection. Savage was never a problem, he was in a very good and balanced spot. **2/3 stars cause I used him and he felt a lil strong. I would rate this 1/3 but this post isn't about protection per say.**

* Eeth Koth - Lol. This was the ""anti-droid"" Jedi that everyone farmed since he was easy to max out with arena tokens. People opted for him as fodder, simply to get Grandmaster Yoda fast. There has been lots of discussion, but all in all? Eeth is bad. And is still bad. And just got worse. His damage is only on par with other characters when attacking droids. Even then, it's nothing more impressive than your typical speedy attacker. In my opinion he should have received General Grievous's current leader ability but that's not what we are here to talk about. Eeth's ONLY good move. In fact the only good thing about him aside from being easy to farm, got nerfed. That +15% damage ability you spent mats on? consider it reversed. Don't know why this was done. He needed a buff and kit change, not a nerf. **0/3 stars**

* Resistance Pilot - Now I didn't farm for this kid, but I feel REALLY bad for some of my friends who have been farming this guy due to his massive offensive power in the late game (reaching level 80). He ends up getting massive turn meter, exposed chance, crit chance. Now his special does 2/3rds the damage it used to. Now I never used him myself, so I can't really rate this fairly. But many people invested a lot of time into this ability and... all i got to say is ouch, that's gotta hurt. Probably justified though considering the datamine. **3/3 stars - Catching a problem before it becomes a problem?** 

* FOTP - This one is iffy since Advantage DID get reworked. What's funny is, crits mean 150% damage. But a follow up attack is 200% damage. So technically, with the old FOTP, do you want a crit? or a follow up? You want a follow up. NOW however, advantage grants crit on the next attack so you obviously opt for the follow up even more. But his special was reworked to apply offense down so there's a utility aspect. FOTP was one-shotting people and I think his power was overlooked due to the difficulty in farming him. I think with the advantage buff and FO comps this change was necessary before it became a problem. **3/3 stars**

* Yoda - OHHH MAN. SO BABY, you spent HOW MUCH MONEY, and TIME, and RESOURCES on HOW MANY 7-starred JEDI?? just to get this guy? L.O.L. Well all you Yoda lovers, I think he can be good in the right circumstance and is all in all, a good balanced character. But I guess the devs thought he was too fast for what he could do so guess what. Unstoppable Force? ONE THIRD OF THE DAMAGE IS GONE. That's two ability level ups of Damage + 15%. But guess what? Yoda only got a +20% damage increase from leveling your ability. Know what that means? EVERYONE'S UNSTOPPABLE FORCE NOW DOES LESS DAMAGE THAN A LEVEL 1 UNSTOPPABLE FORCE. I'm laughing at this but was it justified? What do you think? Should it be more of a utility special damage move than a raw dps one? Yoda is the fastest Jedi after all. Don't forget the stun is now half as reliable since everyone has protection now, so less part of the match is spent with the enemy under 50% health. **Now then** I didn't even get to his other nerf. Masterstroke now does 1/3 of the damage it used to. Still laughing. Sorry Yoda users!!! Really am! Yoda is more like Dooku now, high evasion, great utility, and pitiful pitiful damage. Don't worry though, I'm sure the tenacity and buff sharing will pay off. Maybe. **Damage went from about 7k --&gt; 2k. Biggest nerf in the game** ||||||||  **My rating? 1/3. Damn that's harsh.** it's not like he was dominating the meta and existing in every top 10 squad. *cough royal guard, cough dooku leaders*

* Obi-wan Elegant Form. Well then, Obi-wan is notorious for being slow, but among the tankiest character in the game. Combined with innate evasion on both his basic and leader ability (which too bad is bugged), he also had one of the most powerful specials in the game; Mind Trick. Although slow, it could apply ability block, offense down, and remove turn meter making it one of the most devastating tide turning toolbox abilities in the game. However, Obi-wan is usually a character completely ignored when on defense due to the buffs he could grant. Not to mention the Yoda stealing. Because of him being one of those tanks you could save for last, he wasn't seen much with the useless passive. I guess this really just made Old-Ben go from doing no damage, to almost negative damage. 4k --&gt; 3k damage. **Gona rate this 1/3 because it contradicts CG's goals of having a slow character do more damage.** Now Ben can be EVEN MORE ignored after a damage nerfs and protection added. He i just going to be ignored more and more! BUT. Let me say this to defend that accusation really quick, you might be able to get a second mind trick out in a fight. 

* Jedi Consular - Ummm. an already slow healer, that did negligible damage, does less damage now. Okay. Soo again contradicting a slow character who is supposed to get a damage buff. Mk. **0/3**

* Jedi Knight Anakin - Honestly? Anakin needs a rework. I don't mind his kit snowballing off of fallen allies, and him being an attacker, but the offense ups don't stack. He is fast, but the debuffs are non reliable, even more unreliable since they are based on strategic timing, but combined with a 40% application chance it just isn't useful. Anakin before had Smite which was aoe physical damage, that was.... well pitiful. You'd be lucky to get an execute off, especially against a healer team, even if you did land a critical hit. Smite now does about 3k damage when maxed. Keep in mind it's much harder to get an execute off (that isn't worth lasting) now that protection is live. **0/3 stars**  -  You did say you would nerf fast characters, i get it i get it. But one's that already sucks is the equivalent of lighting a burnt person on fire. (Ha get it? it's Anakin) 

* Darth Sidious - Probably the most justified nerf. People almost never used Demoralizing Blows because his Basic applied healing immunity, did more damage, and could ignore defense. The point of DoTs in this game is that they do % health damage, so they can wittle down tanky characters. The weakness of aoe however is that an enemy team is still working at 100% efficiency whether at full health or 1 health. Killing an enemy takes them out of a fight to snowball any leader. Sid has been a menace, he used to be everyone's leader before Phasma and obviously before the dooku fix. I think he is still viable on crit based teams and I still see two people running him in my top 10 server. (FYI My server has: Rex, Dooku, Dooku, Phasma, Phasma, one of the fukn ewoks, Sid, Sid, QGJ, QGJ.)  The nerf, is understandable. However I don't think it was a problem in the first place. He needs his evasion toned down by about 10%. **3/3 stars**  nerfing a fast annoying character in one way or another. 

* Kylo Ren - You thought he had no synergy with the First Order? People complained he lacked a leader ability, he's too slow, his healing immunity doesn't apply enough blah blah blah. Well yeah, Kylo, ALREADY being slow, now comes with less damage. YAYYYYY. Another hypocritical event. Kylo, although not terribly slow, usually is the last character to move in any given arena team. Being slow helps when you have a counter buff, so the counter buff lasts longer, but Kylo gets his moves refreshed when taking damage anyways. Regardless of these forces working against each other, Kylo's damage was BALANCED. I think he was a good example of how a tank should be as if not attacked, he would remain a damage threat, but if attacked, he would counter, if weakened he could hit hard with Ragged Cut. Personally, both design strength wise and thematically? Kylo Ren is a great character in the game who could have used a little bit of love due to his lack of synergy and being alone in the game. Literally doesn't synergize with anyone but Phasma's leader ability. Too bad. Now Kylo comes with less damage despite being slow. Why? I don't know. Maybe CG is targetting my favorite characters so I quit the game and stop writing these lame reviews. **0/3 stars. Unjustified and contrary to your goals CG**. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To conclude, This isn't a salt thread. I'll be continuing to play this game that I've invested time and money into as I love star wars and the characters within it. I think there are a lot of questionable design and balance decisions that the team makes but I've given up trying to compete with them and their idea of a real balanced competitive meta. I will continue to cheese my way and remain in the top 10 by exploiting the balance flaws of the game. 

I play the game for what CG does right:

* Beautiful art and animations

* It being Star Wars

* The non pressure, timed based, routine grind to do in your free time

* being mobile

But will stop taking the game seriously due to 

* Balance decisions

* Some vital inaccuracies in theme (I feel like there is no middleground, they do some things like Kylo Ren, Yoda and Dooku thematically perfectly, but fail at other points like with Mace Windu, Darth Maul, and Vader). 

* Lack of QoL despite the begging since release

This never went through.

Anyone else think they are too big/this change was supposed to happen?

I think some of the excal helms are really cool but simply since they are not size right, people will stray away from them. 

EDIT: Some of you said Rebecca said it's a matter of personal preference and that they won't be changing them. That is really sad and i hate to say it, pathetic coming from a developer because it completely goes against the point of tennogen. Artists make these, put effort and time, and get paid to do them. But when DE decides to take full control of the situation and probably goofed up the actual size as opposed to what it was SUPPOSED to look like and what was VOTED for, they end up selling something that 1. Doesn't belong to them and 2. is manipulated in a bad way from the original intended product.

But what are your thoughts for those of you picking IMGD or JKA?

I've collected most of the ""decent"" Jedi right now, I've chosen to steer clear of Barriss, Eeth Koth, and Plo Koon. 

Aayla is chromium exclusive.

--------------------------------------------------

So the short version is,

Ima-gun-di


* highest/one of the highest base stats late game of all characters

* Bonus damage on basic vs droids

* Defense will become more valuable, so aoe Defense Up is better now

* 35% counter chance to jedis (as a leader)

* Heal over time upon receiving critical hit.

So I think the Base stats is in my opinion, the biggest reason to get him. As the game goes on, scaling WILL matter, and Ima-gun-di will be near the top of the hill. 

The bonus damage vs droids is there but in my opinion neglible and almost a turn off that this kind of power on his basic attack is so narrow minded. 

As for the Defense Up, it's hard to say HOW valuable it will be with the changes. 

The counter chance is the main reason people would pick him up. It turns everyone into a mini dooku. Though this stat is MUCH more powerful synergy wise with Aayla and Kit (due to innate counters, follow ups, and join ins). I don't know if I WOULD use it in a Jedi team though, there are other valuable stats to pick from!:  QGJ for speed, Lumi for heal+evasion (evasion is same as Dookus but only for Jedi), Mace's offense up + crit chance, Ahsoka's evasion+turn meter (evasion same as dooku's, turn meter = speed) etc. Though the counter chance looks amazing on paper and you can get cool dogpiles, IS it more powerful and worth having on your team?

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Jedi Knight Anakin

* FAF - Fast as fuck. Not stupidly like Yoda, but he's up there with QGJ.

* Basic has 40% chance for healing immunity, and buff blocker

* Offense up for 2 turns on an aoe physical finisher. Damage is LOW 

* Leader ability of a flat 24% offense (basically a constant, non removable HALF of an offense up)

* Almost full turn meter + damage boost on next attack upon ally falling.

Speed is important in the meta right now. If you move first you can effectively begin removing your opponent's team from a fight FIRST, even before they can act. 
HOWEVER, whether or not balancing speed = less damage will be successful (unless tanks are grossly overpowered I think speed will remain king) is a question for sure. 
Regardless, Anakin has notable speed, so he isn't too much of a punching bag.

I REALLY like the 40% chance for healing immunity/buff blocker. But my problem is of course rng and the lack of reliability. 40% on top of tenacity is not very much. My main criticism for this ability is that the debuffs are not only situational, but require strategic timing to be placed on which enemy and when. With a 40% application chance, this is not very reliable in the clutch situations you need it to happen. Regardless, it can serve useful against healing chars, and ones that use buff ups like Savage and Asajj.

I think Anakin's special is what is lacking. It just deals pitiful aoe damage. Not to mention it is physical, being easier to reduce. The offense up boost on an execute is nice, but it's hard to make it specifically Anakin's turn, when the opponent is at a low enough health for this to execute someone. The chances of this happening in a match are pretty darn low, and is even more difficult to pull off if you have counter characters or the enemy has healers. This ability to me is more like a situational bonus that CAN be powerful but I would more rely on QGJ's offense up boost. Regardless, Jedis don't have much offensive boosts for the team outside of this so it's worth considering.

Leader ability, not much to talk about. Straight raw damage, always a good thing. The best part is it can't be removed or blocked, your characters will be dealing a consistent 24%+ increased damage across the board. Again, being a leader ability you would sacrifice others like QGJ's speed, Lumi/ahsoka evasion +heal/turn meter, or even yoda. 

Righteous Fury is probably one the most interesting and the actual reason you'd be adding Anakin to your squad. You get rewarded with revenge as your allies fall. Now this can be REALLY powerful in the right hands. If anakin is running his leader, and one of your chars fall, your can really see Anakin shine by killing anything at 50% health at that point. Unfortunately this doesn't increase by having offense up because if I'm not mistaken, offense up and Righteous Fury's bonus DO NOT STACK. If they do, great, but I'm pretty sure they don't. If it were to stack would it be a must have though? Is the situation not too reliant on a specific event?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All in all, who are YOU farming with the cantina release. Are you going to continue the dooku grind before he gets nerfed? are you going for Royal Guard? maybe Bariss for Galactic War? or are you also having trouble picking between these two jedi??

I guess my biggest fear is if I DO end up farming them, i feel like I'll never actually end up using them on my roster as I have more reliable jedi.

* In GW it's been slow. That random shard at the end doesn't help very much. We did however just get Magmatrooper as a winnable to spend GW tokens on!

* Arena, I'm not sure of the history. To be honest, no one has been released for 1/3rd of the year (since before december im guessing).

NOW.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When it comes to number of characters however, you'd think Arena is fine.

**Cantina** has **11** characters and ability mats you can win. 

**Galactic War** has **11** characters you can win.

**Arena** has **12** characters you can win

BUT. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

on a ""normal"" day, you would achieve about 

* 400 Cantina tokens (5 shards)

* 1200 Galactic War Tokens (15 shards)

* Honestly anywhere from 200ish --&gt; 1,000 depending on how good you are (1-10 shards)

Thus we see an imbalance.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**I would personally justify Cantina shipments, with the fact that they can**

* Be refreshed

* Offer shards of another character while earning tokens

* Many cantina characters can be farmed in hard mode

**As for Galactic War, is bolsters a good 15 shards a day!**

* Some of these characters have hard nodes like Luminara, Poggle,a nd others

**As for Arena**

* It depends on your ranking

* Arena chars are chromium/arena exclusive, no nodes you can farm them

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My top votes, considering the new cantina shards, for an Arena character would be

* Darth Maul - Cause we all love him. his kit is ACTUALLY KIND OF BAD. He needs attention similar to Ahsoka, being Squishy and Slow

* Aayla Secura - Cause we all want her. She is the ""Dooku"" of jedi, with a built in counter attack, extra damage on it, and stunning on crits

* General Kenobi - Not released yet but i can dream

* Rex - Again, since Arena chars are exclusive to having no farm spot, I guess Rex could fit

* Grand Moff Tarkin - I want to farm this guy and build an empire team. He is a chromium exclusive who you will see no where because maybe he sucks and no one who whales has found use for him.

It was a gladiatorial event with a cruel twist: as a fighter won matches, his number of opponents (generally prisoners of war) fought simultaneously would increase. This meant eventual death for every contender, but with unparalleled glory. Xin Zhao, known then as Viscero, was slated to face 300 soldiers, nearly six times the previous record. This was clearly meant to be his final match.* 

From Alistar's Lore: *Only the intervention of some of Noxus's most skilled summoners checked Alistar's rage. Brought in chains to Noxus, Alistar spent the intervening years as a gladiator in the Fleshing, pitted in endless battle for the entertainment of Noxus's wealthy leaders.*

* **Elemental Ward is now a passive.** There's no reason to not have it turned on as long as you have the energy. This lacks gameplay. Therefore by making it a passive while above 25% energy, frees up an ability slot without being overpowered.

* **1st Power: Spectral Scream** - 10e + 3/s energy. Decreased cast time. Pelt elemental breath. If away from Chroma, will fire towards players target reticule.. No longer hinders movement, 30 meter range (3x the old range, ignis is 40m in fact think of this power as an elemental ignis). 150/200/250/300 dps. Hold the button down to recast without interruption. Will kill anything exposed to 20+ consecutive ticks of Spectral Scream.

* **Draconian Strafe** - 50 e Pelt/Chroma glides 30 meters, breathing the elements that stays on the ground dealing damage to enemies but providing buffs to allies standing in it. Like Oberon carpet, adds elemental damage and energy instead of armor and status immunity. Chroma can fly now yay. Bonuses vary on element. Allows redirecting of Effigy.

* **Vex Armor** - 75 e Same as current except damage that Effigy and Chroma take, will benefit both the Effigy and Chroma. 

* **Effigy** -  No more energy drain. Pelt comes off and shoots stuff like normal but with more default range (30m)  Costs 100 energy to cast, no more drain Lasts 40 s. Casting 1, will make pelt aim at what you are aiming instead of you using the ability freeing up you to do what you want. Using 2 will redirect the Effigy to your target/aimer and do the strafe attack on the way there. Vex armor has less power when not wearing pelt. **THIS IS THE NEW PART. YOU CAN JUMP ON THE EFFIGY SIMILAR TO ZIPLINE, BUT INSTEAD OF RUNNING ALONG THE ZIPLINE, YOU ""RIDE"" THE EFFIGY AROUND LIKE THE GLIDER FROM GREEN GOBLIN. CAN CAST ALL ABILITIES AND SHOOT WHILE STANDING ON EFFIGY**

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi all, I won't go into too much detail on speech.

My notion is that Chroma is supposed to be a dragon-like frame who like many modern frames, should have both synergy, alternate builds, proper theme, and late game viability.

Right now Chroma is suffering from some lack of all of the above.

* Ele ward and Vex armor only synergize because they both add to tankiness. They have 0 gameplay other than just activating them for a damage/tank buff then running and gunning. 

* The 1 and 4 have no synergy with the rest of his kit

* Most people opt for a duration+strength build, neglecting range and running the ele ward/vex armor then running and gunning. 1 and 4 are mostly ignored due to sacrificing range. No one uses 1. They just don't, it's never worth using. 4 only for defense missions or for immediate *bad* crowd control

* Dragons, though tanky with scales, and breathing the elements, shouldn't be run and gun frames. That shouldn't be out of the question considering what the game is, but Chroma is very similar to rhino in that, 1 does damage but chromas has no scaling. Their 2 and 3 adds tankiness and damage. 4 for crowd control. Now Don't downvote me for this bad comparison but it's just an idea of it. 

* Chroma seems to be lost between a tank rhino like frame, with these weak power strength breath abilities, and an effigy that serves as a turret kind of thing? 

* Power strength doesn't scale well late unless properly synergized with armor shred, other abilities, or weapon mods. Thus chroma falls off.

I hope to address these issues, make Chroma thematic, unique, and late game scaling. But of course, fun, because right now we just all 2/3 run and shoot things. 

I hope to not bore you with the addressing of these issues too much and instead wish to delve right into my ideas.

----------------------------------------------------------------

My idea for Chroma is to fufill his role as the ""Dragon"" frame but synergize his kit more alongside Effigy.

Bear with me, it's kind of strange. He isn't totally the dragon himself, but kind of is.

My idea for a rework for Chroma revolves more around a **Trainer and his Dragon**. Working together to conquer the battlefield. 

**There is a TL;DR/Explanation in bold at the end of each ability description.**

------------------------------------------------------------------

**Passive 1 :** Elemental Alignment - Chroma's energy color will determine one of four elements, Fire, Ice, Toxic, Electric, each having their own impact on Chromas other abilities

**Passive 2 :** Elemental Ward - As long as Chroma has above 25% energy, his pelt will emit an aura that infuses himself and nearby allies with elemental energy as long as they remain within 6 / 8 / 10 / 12 meters, providing both offensive and defensive buffs. 

Elemental Ward exhibits different effects depending on Chroma's current elemental alignment, determined by Chroma's energy color.

* **Heat** - Generates a flame aura around Chroma and affected allies that increases base health by 50% / 75% / 100% / 200% and inflicts 25 / 50 / 75 / 100 Heat damage per second within a radius of 5 meters with a 10% / 25% / 35% / 50% status chance. **Heat status damage will heal Chroma.**

* **Electric** - Infuses Chroma and affected allies with an electric current that increases base shields by 50% / 65% / 75% / 100% and converts incoming damage into arc discharges. An arc discharge inflicts 250% / 300% / 500% / 1000% incoming damage as Electricity to a single target within 5 / 6 / 8 / 10 meters with a 10% / 15% / 20% / 25% status chance. Arc discharges will inflict a minimum of 50 / 60 / 100 / 200 Electricity damage.

* **Toxic** - Emits an aura of noxious fumes around Chroma and affected allies that increases base reload speed by 15% / 25% / 30% / 35% and holster rate by 15% / 25% / 30% / 35%. Within a radius of 5 meters, the noxious fumes also have a 25% / 35% / 40% / 50% chance per second to deal 5% of an enemy's maximum health as Toxin damage with a 100% status chance.

* **Cold** - Encases Chroma and affected allies in a layer of frost that increases base armor by 25% / 75% / 100% / 150% and creates an ice shield that reflects incoming fire back to their source. Reflected damage is increased by 150% / 200% / 250% / 300% and has a 10% / 15% / 20% / 25% status chance.

**Explanation/TL;DR** - Elemental Ward is passive. This is a big buff to Chroma, technically. That is, if energy was EVER a problem for you in this game. One of the first problems we will tackle with Chroma is that there is no reason not to have Elemental Ward/Vex Armor going. They aren't toggle, yet you cast them off cooldown for the improved stats. This makes it so HALF of Chroma's abilities have no gameplay whatsoever, they are just an on switch.

Thus, this change makes it so Elemental Ward is a PASSIVE. As long as you have above 25% of your energy (aka if you are drained it won't work). As much as this is a ""buff' or wow that's op, it was essentially free anyways, this just makes it so you don't have to turn it on. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Power 1 :** Spectral Scream - 25 energy - Chroma/Effigy unleashes a continuous stream of elemental energy in a cone 12 / 18 / 24 / 30 meters long that inflicts 150 / 200 / 250 / 300 damage per second with a 40% / 45% / 50% / 60% status chance for 5 seconds. Hold the button down to recast without interruption. **Enemies exposed to 10 consecutive ticks of Spectral Scream will begin to take 10% of their maximum health in damage per tick.**

**Augment: ~~Afterburn~~ Spitfire** - Casting Spectral Scream will cause Chroma to spit a fireball before the elemental stream that has a various effects.

* Grineer suffer a corrosive proc

* Corpus suffer a magnetic proc

* Will disarm Heavy Grineer forcing them into melee

* Will pop Nullifier Bubbles with a single fireball

**Explanation/TL;DR** - Spectral Scream won't make you walk anymore, you can run around as if you had a gun and has range similar to the ignis. (30m range, ignis has 40m range). This is 3x the range on the live version with much faster response time. Toggle on for elemental scream. Damage is up. Don't forget, Effigy shoots it, so if you have Effigy out, the stream will come from a different angle (That's what she said).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Power 2:** Draconian Strafe - 50 energy - 8 second duration. Chroma/Effigy briefly takes flight towards target location, breathing down a layer of elemental power dealing 100/200/300/400 damage. Enemies caught in the remaining energy, will suffer a status proc based on Chroma's element that refreshes so long as they stay in the area. Allies standing in the area will gain 20/30/40/50% elemental damage to their attacks based on Chroma's element. In addition, all allies standing in the area will generate 5% of their maximum energy per second.  

**Explanation/TL;DR** - Replacing the now innate Elemental Ward, Draconian is a more utility based nuke that does less damage than Spectral Scream, but imbues allied weapons with elemental damage in addition to energy restoration.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Power 3:** Vex Armor - Mostly unchanged except Chroma and his Pelt both have Vex Armor, therefore either one of them can be damage, benefiting the other's armor and damage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Power 4:** Effigy - 100 Energy - 40s duration - Chroma sheds his outer pelt, imbuing it with elemental energy to sprout wings and converting it into a stationary floating sentry with 1000 / 2000 / 4000 / 8000 health. The sentry will attack all enemies within 30 meters with a continuous stream of elemental energy, dealing 100 / 200 / 300 / 400 damage per tick. The sentry is capable of unleashing a radial attack that inflicts 200 damage to enemies within 5 meters, pushing them back 10m. The sentry can also unleash a radial roar to temporarily stun enemies within 30 meters. 

When Chroma's pelt is shed, Chroma's abilities will come from the Effigy instead. Both him and his Effigy can benefit from taking damage and providing bonuses for the other. 

Chroma can ""mount' his Pelt similar to a Zipline where Chroma will ride Effigy like a glider. Please see image at beginning of post for visual interpretation.

**Explanation/TL;DR** - Effigy's biggest changes are that it's not longer an energy drain, it's radial attack knocks back enemies, and you can now glide/ride on Effigy. Effigy overall has more utility and gameplay since the Pelt itself will be casting the abilities while Chroma is not wearing his pelt

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just to conclude, I really really feel like people are running Chroma as a run and gun frame by only using his 2nd and 3rd abilities. I wanted to make 1 and 4 more usable by amping up their damage and range, while removing an ongoing energy cost for Effigy. 

* Spectral Scream will now kill anything if used on a target for 20+ seconds, rewarding the player for an ongoing stream to scale into late game. 

* Draconian Strafe is for Chroma players to not completely neglect their team, by offering them additional bonuses outside of Elemental Ward. This also redirects Effigy without having to uncast, run over, and recast Effigy.

* Vex Armour remains mostly the same but has more synergy between Chroma and his effigy as both benefit from damage and bonuses when tanking.

* Effigy is no longer a drain, simply a energy cost ---&gt; duration. Effigy will occasionally knock back enemies for peel. You can ride Effigy across the map like the glider from spiderman.

**TL;DR:**

 Make Blocking innate/default at all times. Because it rewards you for pressing a button down that you should be pressing down at all times anyways. Parrying will be blocking before attack hits. Make it so more blocking when facing target, less when away (reverse/inverse of mesa's peacemaker). We all want to be like jedi/ryan reynolds, reflect bullet coming from one direction and make it hit someone someone else.

Make combos cancellable and have variation/incentive to use different combos to create different needs and effects. Tell us stance multipliers and have video and show us painted hit boxes like on wiki. 

Remove damage mods, make up for base damage on each weapon. For ex: pp + 2 elemental = 400% damage. Remove pp and 2 elemental, and make weapon by rank 30 400% damage anyways. We free up mod space and have more modifications and less mandatory boring damage mods

Make channeling cheaper for weaker fast weapons so it's balanced with heavy weapons. Rework all mods.

OR

Make channeling energy drain based. What this means is you won't lose your energy really fast when blocking 100 bullets, but will also make all weapon types regardless of hits per second use the same energy with the same damage bonus. 

Make air attacks magnetic/lock on based. Long term make them do aerial combos and juggling and launching like DMC

**Blocking/Counter Attacks/Finishers**

The reason I want to start with this topic is because when i talk about combos and hitboxes, blocking takes hold of a portion of an idea i have for combos. I think it's therefore fitting to start with this topic. In addition to this, I think Blocking is among the ""Easier"" things to fix in the game resulting in a shorter and more straightforward post. 

Blocking is an interesting topic that has been touched upon many times. Some say it's useless and never use it, others say it is amazing and the damage reduction it grants is nothing to scoff at. 

My view of blocking, is that I think it has some real potential. 

Sword Alone Tenno risk being more vulnerable and taking more damage by being in the front lines and getting up close and personal. This is because at a range you are harder to hit, and can hide behind walls to prevent being fired upon. If you need to fight up close, you allow yourself to be focused down, and being ""open"" to being shot. To compensate, defensive capabilities should exist to promote a Tenno's safety.

I believe this safety resides in a blocking system. 

Now whenever I talk to people about blocking, whether it's good or not, I always bring up for the damage reduction.

Different weapons can grant different damage reduction, but to give you an idea, Nikanas, Sword and Shield weapons, polearms, scythers, and others can grant you a massive 85% damage reduction. That's right, 85%. 

So to the people who say it's useless, it's simply a fact that you are wrong because 85% damage reduction means you live 85% longer and can take 85% harder hits before going down.

Now this is where I agree with the people who say it's useless because a lot of us are thinking this: 

Ain't nobody got time for dat

And you are right!! It's a simple right mouse button click to do it, so why not do it? 

It's because it ""Feels like"" blocking is slowing you down. People would rather bullet jump and go full speed to chop down their target then actually walk straight at them while blocking and then cut them down. 

My solution (skip to bold for actual solution)

For Blocking? it's quite simple. REALLY simple actually. The game right now is making it so if you forget/are too lazy to block, you don't get damage reduction, if you remember/aren't too lazy to hold down a mouse button, you GET the damage reduction.

Where's the gameplay in that? 

What DE should do is make blocking innate. Your Tenno, while doing ""nothing"" as in, while walking, running, jumping (not bullet jumping), they should be blocking by DEFAULT. It's silly that holding down a button is what dictates a simple damage reduction because if you as a player wanted maximum results, we'd all hold down the mouse button. 

Now you might be saying now ""Who da fuk is dis guy. Nooo i want to press my block button cause it feels cool dat im choosing to block and choosing when to run around with my sword around not defending me""

I GET YOU MAN!. ME TOO! In real life, there is no way you and I would put down our swords and NOT be blocking bullets, that S#&amp;amp;&amp;#036; hurts! But how can we run around all coolsies without blocking but still block?

We can change/fix/make blocking a thing pretty easy with these three bullets (no pun intended)

Blocking should be default damage reduction. Where when incoming damage is coming at you, your Warframe will automatically attempt to block a percentage of the damage. 
Blocking damage reduction should be INCREASED when you are targetting/facing the enemy attacking you, and damage reduction should be DECREASED if your back is to them or if you aren't aiming at them. This makes it so your blocking amount/prowess is up at all times, but it's up to the player to choose from which direction damage is important to block from. 
Actively blocking/pressing the right click button/block button should deflect and reflect the attacks in that instance/burst back at the opponent. This makes it so when arrow, scorpian grapple, bombard missile, lazor beam is coming at you, you can actively use real life reflexes to slam that baby right click button down right before it hits and make dem attacks fly back at the enemy! In fact, if you get shot from the right side, but are aiming to the left, the damage you parried from the right, should hit the guy on the left! Now we can all be like Ryan Reynolds

Against melee attacks, this is the same. By default you would attempt to block the attack depending on where you are facing.

To parry and stagger a melee enemy, you should press the right click/block button right before they hit you, should initiate the frontal finisher. 

Now to those of you who are like ""but dat damage reduction is too op!"" well no, because we have the option to block and get that damage reduction already. People just don't actively do it. That's like saying, we should have to pick up energy and health orbs with the use key. It's something we'd get anyways, but some people just don't press the button. 

that's okay, there are times where innate block is NOT active. 

Bullet jumps (because you are dodging/twirling through the air)

Wall running (busy parkouring g2g)

When attacking (you can't block with your sword if you are busy swinging it)

If you aren't facing them (I wish we were like daredevil where we knew what was going on around us)

To conclude/TL;DR: Blocking should be innate because right now, damage reduction is good, and technically there should NEVER be a time when you SHOULDN'T be blocking! This however is only existent on enemies you are actually facing. Parrying, and reflecting attacks should be done on a timing basis where you would press the block button right before an oncoming attack to redirect it back towards an enemy or cause melee enemies to stagger. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Combos and Hitboxes, Clarity**

As you all know, every melee weapon has a variety of ""Stance"" mods that one can earn and equip to their melee weapon specific to its type. 

Different weapon types have different stances available. 

Sword Stances cannot be used on Hammers, Hammer stances cannot be used on Daggers, Dagger stances cannot be used on swords, etc. 

**The Pros:** 

* Cool looking attacks
* Variation of uses for different combos
* Extra mod energy
* Damage multipliers and effects
* Personal ""Feel"" and custom playstyle

**The Cons:**

* Animation lock disables you from cancelling the attack, stop attacking, stop moving, and makes you ""stuck"" while swinging
* Hitboxes are ""guessed"" by the player and visual queues rather than actual ones
* Combo multipliers and effects exist but are not displayed nor do they inform the player that they exist
* Some are hard to earn
* Rarely is there an incentive to use a ""harder"" combo over an easier
* For the most part, I'm pretty happy with stances and combos. You have a ton of options to choose from and they give melee the damage umph it needs. There are also some neat mobility effects, and status effects that can occur. Not to mention pulls, trips, finishers. 

**What I'm not happy about that I think can be fixed quite ""easily"" are three things**

1. Lack of clarity on what combos do and what their hitboxes are

2. An incentive/easy way for someone to pull off a more difficult combo over a harder one. (Higher skill should = higher reward for the most part, but some combos should be situational)

3. Animation lock, making you swing at air while ""walking"" towards someone.

**My suggested solutions:**

**1. The clarity on combos and hitboxes shouldn't be too difficult to ""fix""**. Simply have an additional weapon, next to the stance, that states exactly which attack in which part of the combo does how much damage or has what effect. Also have a short replaying video of the combo in action. Almost just like our very own wiki! 

As for hitboxes, I think we should be given the option to perhaps when in the simulacrum, have an invisible warframe perform the combo that we select in the loadout menu, but have it's swings leave behind an energy paint in the air that will dictate and inform us of exactly where these hitboxes are at each instance in the combo. 

A lot of people may say hitboxes don't really matter, you can assume it will hit what's in front of you, that may be true for the most part, but keep in mind there are some combos that can hit aerial enemies, more enemies to the left, to the right, or even behind you. These hit boxes are very important depending on what you are trying to achieve. 

**2. I think the combos system could use a slight readjustment**. Right now, it's based on pause combos and holding a button or direction down. While some of these combos work out well for the game and make sense, others do not. For example, combos that i think are healthy with this kind of system are ones that require you to hold down forward or backward. This is because those combos are designed to help you achieve something in a forward and backward motion. This is confusing, but let's just say combos that require you to run forward, are more aggressive, while ones that make you run backward are/should be more defense. 

Now i think the best way to do this is to remap melee controls for starters. Second, have every stance feature a standard attack, and special attack, a mobile attack, and a defensive attack (at the very least).

On the remapping controls bit, I don't know what it is for consoles but on PC melee attacks are in the E key. R and your left-mouse button (shoot) DON'T DO ANYTHING during this time!

I think melee attacks should be remapped to the left click button by default. This not only maximizes control and priority onto the right hand, but it also means that you can melee attack while strafing right. What i mean by that is if you are using the E button to attack, you can't press D to run right because that finger is busy doing something else! (same goes for running forward if you use your middle finger to press E). 

People have suggested that these now, free E and R keys can be used for other things like say heavy attacks, in place of right click/pause/hold combos, slam attacks, etc. 

I am not opposed to that. 

Now on the topic of combos, this would require a ton of work and I'm sure many exceptions can be made, but they should include an incentive for each Stance combo. 

Say each stance had at least 4 of the following: Standard, Special Attack, Mobile Attack, Defensive Attack.

Each of these would be unique. 

Your standard attack is what you'd call today's E spam combos. They are the very basic attack and combo that each stance and weapon can perform naturally with certain damage modifiers.

Next would be your Special Attack. This would be what's unique to the stance, whether it has guarenteed procs, a slam finish, an execution/finisher at the end, a whip grap, a bullet shot, throwing your shield, throwing your tonfas, you name it. This combo would be harder to pull off than the standard and would have things you may not want in a standard combo. My best example of this would be comparing the two Iron Phoenix combos on the Sword Stance. Your first combo, Wings and Break, is your standard combo. It has a mobility stab at the end with an impact damage proc. Taking Flight however has more hits involved, different hitboxes, and a slam at the end. The incentive to pick between them is basically, 2 attacks then a stab (impact) OR 4 attacks then a slam. This would give people a reason to pick one over the other in a standard situation when selecting a Special combo or a Standard.

Next would be your mobile combo. This would obviously be a combo which would cover a good distance. My best example of this would be many combos from the Blind Justice stance. All the combos except the default, cover a great amount of distance. A combo like this one should exist in most all stances but should not be mandatory. This would give players a reason to use a combo that covers more distance, rather than one of raw power or special effect. 

Lastly would be a defensive combos. I stated earlier how Blocking should be by default. While attacking however, you are not blocking, and therefore do not have the innate damage reduction of the weapon. A defensive combo will allow you to retain part of that damage reduction at the cost of attack power. The defensive combo would be one that deals moderate damage and in exchange for the and a lack of ""special effect"" or mobility, you get damage reduction. The incentive and reason to use a defensive combo is if you are scared of taking damage during a time, therefore opting to choose this one over another. 

I just want to reiterate, this isn't mandatory, but i think many stances should have at least the above 4 options of Standard, Special, Mobile, and Defensive combos but ALL stances are unique and a mix and match and variation of any is JUST FINE. As long as these two things happen, 1. we have the option to choose what we want and 2. there is an incentive to not just e-spam your way out of the thousand cut challenge. 

**3. Animation cancelling.** This is a very important feature that I would love to have in melee in warframe. This is because things tend to often put you in animation lock, and it adds clunkiness to combat. You find yourself cutting down foes but the enemy already died and a half of your combo is still finishing its silly animation striking the air in front of you while a gunner 10m away is mowing you down.

For those of you who don't play mobas, animation cancelling is important because it causes you to stop what you are doing and ""take back"" what you were going to do. 

To make this more simple, imagine you have a sword in hand and are striking across your body at the air in front of you. about 33% of that motion is having the sword over your head/shoulder, and bringing it in front of you mid slash. The next 33% would be actually cutting through the air/dummy/imaginary enemy in front of you. Now there is another 33% of the attack that isn't as important and it's the follow through. The first 33% got you momentum, the second 33% did the damage, but the last 33% does nothing! It's just air!

I'm not saying that that is totally unhealthy for a game like warframe. I'm more concerned about being mid combo and wanting to stop and dying because it didn't work out. Or you are running towards an enemy who for some reason runs just as fast as you, you think you are close enough to hit them but when you start the attack you miss, they keep running, and you are busy doing some silly blade dance in mid-air.

Animation cancelling I think is very important to complex mechanics in the game and would serve as no actual power advantage for the player. It's more closer to quality of like and smoothness of play.
 

**My solution:**

Give us the ability to stop what we are doing at any given time by either 

1. Rolling

2. Jumping

3. Pressing the block (now parry) button.

This makes it so the reason we want to stop attacking, is to move out of the way or defend ourselves.

See that missile coming in from the left? I would totally roll out of the way, but I'm busy spinning around in my crimson dervish attack and it's so slow that I'm just a sitting duck :( 

See that orokin laser rotating around about to hit me? Damn I wish i could jump over it but I'm busy doing my dizzy spin of shattering storm with this heavy slow mace. My b.

See that scorpion about to fire her grappling hook? Damn it'd be badasss if i parried that S#&amp;amp;&amp;#036; and then did a finisher on them. Too bad I'm in the middle of my tekko combo, BOOM BABY gaias tradgedy! let me throw out 50 punches in front of me while bullets are raining from the incoming enemies on my flanks. 

Animation cancelling would not even come close to breaking the game and would easily make fighting with Sword Alone, much easier and smooth.

With guns, if you roll while shooting, bullet jump while shooting, etc. it already does it for you! Just asking for the same love here.

**Damage/Crit/Status/Mods/Operation Shadow Debt mods**

Now I'm going to be honest. Steve tweeter that Damage 3.0 was being discussed. I don't know when that will come to life, but it will probably be towards the end of the year if anything.

My goal here is to hopefully ""bandaid"" some of the current, obvious problems with melee at the moment. 

It can be fixed easily, and in a game like Warframe, would absolutely not tip the balance by any means at all. 

Damage itself, for starters, is not the problem with melee. We can all kill enemies pretty well with what we have at the moment I think. Regardless of gun dps vs melee, I believe melee, if this post's suggestions are taken into effect, would make it on par with guns and make up for any lack in dps with the ability to hit multiple opponents, keep them ""staggered"", grant us damage reduction, and even finishers (since they scale). 

I think damage will be supplemented in melee 3.0. That's what I have confidence in.

**Two big problems with melee **

1. How crit-based weapons make up 99% of the ""viable"" melees due to berserker, organ shatter, etc. and in turn the unviability of status weapons or those that cannot benefit from crit 

2. How mod space is limited where we are forced to sacrifice (hardly choose between) damage mods, for utility, or vice versa. 

Many people say that Operation Shadow Debt's mods were good for melee. I agree with you for the most part. It added a lot of benefit to the current iteration of melee and allowed them to ""scale"" into late game very well. They are among the strongest mods you can get and are so useful that when used in combination with another, are more worth it than a 90% damage elemental mod. 

**On crit**

Crit builds went from PP, LS, Organ Shatter, True Steel, berserker then three elemental damage mods, maybe a primed reach if viable, to taking out True Steel, and an elemental in exchange for a mod that extended our combo multiplier to about a dozen seconds and another that just guaranteed our crits. 

Whether this was a healthy change or not, it pretty much made it so that melee could scale into late game as long as you were ""on a rampage"" and kept hitting things. It would make your damage ramp up as you were hitting enemies rather than have a constant damage across the board. 

I can't think of the math off the top of my head but the Shadow Debt mods are what made crit weapons amazing. So much so that it put status weapons further into the dump. 

People can argue that status weapons are good!! they'll go on to convince others that they can cc lock, and viral takes away % health, corrosive can take down armor, sure. But like most things in this game, the utility just doesn't cut it over damage. We have warframe abilities for that.

The ol joke in many games are ""The best type of crowd control in any game is death"". or ""why stun them when you can kill them?""

I think this holds true for melee in warframe.

The problem doesn't reside in nerfing critical attacks, but instead buffing the effects of status. Each status proc should be a meaningful one in itself.

This all has to do with scaling, something that will probably only exist in damage 3.0. There's no real point in putting cold status, fire status, electricity status, toxic status etc. on your weapons. The utility in these elements are rare. Status weapons need procs across the board to bring uniqueness to status weapons.

Crit weapons can remain the damage threats, dealing as much dps as possible and picking your element to match the enemy's weakness. 

Status weapons should have utility, disabling the opponent, making up for dps in other ways. Whether it's % health against tanky/late game targets, corroding their armor, freezing them, and these means exist, but not to the extent where they'd be worth picking over damage. 

**The Solution**

The solution to making status weapons on par with crit weapons is simply enhance the effect of statuses and bring more gameplay design where statusing an enemy in certain situations would be much more beneficial than simply damaging them. 

This solution resides in most likely damage 3.0 or something like that where status procs are changed to a viable setting. 

**Slide Attacks vs Spin Attacks**

Spin attacks (which are the animation in which you spin and perform in attack) and there are also slide attacks (which are spin attacks done while remaining in a sliding position). 

There is a difference between them. The difference is that the spin attack is the animation of an attack that can be done on ground or air. The Slide attack is done while still sliding.

This is important because although the Shadow Debt mod Maiming Strike, adds a flat 90% crit chance to any weapon (flat as in, it will crit 90% of the time.) when using a Slide attack, it does not increase the critical strike chance of a Spin attack. 

To fix this, these two should be considered the same as it is deceptive and an unclear mechanic in the game that I'm sure throws many people off who are performing spin attacks consecutively for critical strikes, where as they aren't actually registering as a Slide attack for its specific uses. 

**Mod Space**

Just off the bat. The Shadow Debt mods should have been innate in the melee system. 

The combo system was flawed from the beginning, requiring only 3 seconds between attacks before the counter completely resets.

The combo counter is the only thing that keeps melee weapon's damage into go scaling alongside other weapons. 

The + a dozen seconds on the combo counter, as well as the status/crit chance depending on the combo counter should be innate, if not just bumped up to say 8 seconds. This is the healthiest thing to do for melee weapons and I'm actually upset that they made them into mods over by default.  

 
----------------------------------

Next, I want to point out, we use mod space for one thing. DPS. The only exception is Reach and Life Strike. 

I think this should change. That the mods we use should modify and customize a weapon rather than simply increase it's DPS. 

I've thought of a good change across melee mods in order to actually make these mods useful, but utility wise over damage.

**My Solution**

Please read all of the following before jumping to conclusions:

* Pressure Point - Removed
* Damage from all elemental/physical improving mods - Removed
* Damage of all Melee weapons, increased by 400%. (If Sword has 10 impact, 10 puncture, 80 slash, 100 total, it's now 40 impact, 40 puncture and 320 slash, 400 total). 
* Damage of all melee weapons scale according to rank. At Rank 0, at 25% power. Rank 10, 50% power. Rank 20, 75% power. Rank 30, 100% power. 
* I think Pressure point and damage mods are ""must-haves"" that make modding a weapon extremely boring. They are mandatory mods that will go on every single weapon to increase their damage and type. 

**By removing mandatory mods and simply making the damage innate,** it will not only free up mod space but make it so these ""must have"" mods don't exist! Things that are mandatory should just be granted by default. It's silly that they aren't as there is no gameplay, decision making, or logical choice in the matter. It brings about a factual interference where you have to have it or it's not good.

Now one may argue that by removing the damage mods, you now make it so anyone can run around with a rank 0 weapon since it'll have the same damage as a rank 30 even without the utility.

This isn't true, as one of my bullets state that weapon damage scales per rank, so as you level the weapon, it reaches it's maximum damage potential. 

Now you might be asking yourself, how do i add different elements to my weapon then?

Well the mod will still exist it just wouldn't add damage.

Similar to some conclave mods, I think these should simply convert the damage type of your default weapon, by a percentage towards an element allowing for great customization. 

**For example.** Say Nikana Prime has a total base damage of 100 right now in today's game. 

90 Slash, 5 impact, and 5 puncture.

Because of the damage multipliers being removed from the mod, at rank 30, the Nikana Prime would instead have 400% the base damage to make up for the loss of pressure point and two elementals. (120% for pressure point, 90% for each elemental, adding up to 300% + 100% base damge.) People may argue that they had more than 300% bonus damage on your weapons, and that may be true if you use MORE than two elemental mods or Primed Heavy Trauma. Just keep in mind these mods, although granting a 120% boost, only effected the ""primary"" physical type of that weapon. So a Buzz Kill would only improve the Slash, not the puncture and impact of a weapon, where as an elemental mod increased the entire  base damage of the weapon.

Still though, this ""loss of situational damage"" is not only miniscule, but is more than made up for through the extra mod space, crit mods, utility, and potential channeling rework mods that can take its place. 

Elemental Mods for example would be changed to the following:

Shocking Touch = +90% Electricity Damage.  25% of damage is converted into Electricity Damage.

What this does is, before with two elemental mods and Pressure point, your Nikana Prime would have 100 base damage, with 120% from pressurepoint and 180% damage from the two elemental mods.

This would total up to 400% damage. 90% of that 400% would be electricity. 

Therefore, with a 100 base damage Nikana, * 1.2 from Pressure Point which is 220 total damage, plus 90 from an elemental is 310, plus another 90 is 400. 

90 of that damage would be electricity. 

In my change, where the Nikana Prime would already have a base damage of 400, 1/4th of that (25%) would be 100 damage converted into electricity. 

This is about the same conversion so all in all what is happening is you are freeing up a pressure point slot while still getting the same damage and effect. 

There would need to be some sort of compensation for mods like Primed Heavy Trauma but in the end I think it could work out. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Channeling**

On Channeling, i will not be talking about the mods.

I think the mods are 50% of what channeling is, and needs a complete overhaul.

There have been dozens of great ideas on channeling mods in the community and I don't feel the need to share my own ideas of their rework with you.

For now, there are only two channeling mods that people would consider. 

**1. Using Life Strike** is one of the channeling mods people use, as it's a heal. Unfortunately it's hard to Life Strike/Channel all the time due to the expensive energy costs. 

**2. Killing Blow.** Although Killing Blow adds 120% channeling damage (aka 1.5x damage to 2.1x damage) it comes AFTER adding an elemental mod. So if you argue killing blow only adds 60% damage, don't forget that with a weapon of 100 base damage, channeling being 150 damage, killing blow being 210 damage, putting an elemental weapon in place of that would be 190 base damage, channeling makes it 285 damage. 

But Killing Blow will outscale an elemental mod if you opt for more of the base damage mods.

**For example,**

* (one mod slots) 1 elemental is better than 1 Killing Blow, 285  vs 210. (100 + 90 = 190 * 1.5 = 285 vs 100 * 2.1 = 210)

* (two mod slots) 2 elemental is better than 1 Killing Blow and 1 Elemental, 420 vs 399 (100 + 90 + 90 = 280 * 1.5 = 420 vs 100 +90 * 2.1 = 399.) 

BUT

* (three available mod slots) 3 Elemental is worse than 1 Killing Blow and 2 Elemental, 555 vs 567  (100 + 90 + 90 + 90 = 370 * 1.5 = 555 damage vs 100 + 90 + 90 = 270 *2.1 = 567 damage) 

And you can assume the rest from there.

I hope my math is correct..

BUT keep in mind this is only when Channeling! Killing Blow has no effect if you don't have enough energy to use it. 

 

**Long Term:**

In the long run, channeling mods need a complete overhaul. Most of them are not any good nor worth putting on your warframe, nor spending energy to actually do damage. We only use it for healing really. 

**Shot Term:**

We need Channeling to do 2 things in the short run. 

**1.** Some people say that channeling cost should vary depending on the weapon. Faster weapons less energy, heavy weapons more.

Weapons should scale with varying energy costs due to the variation of ""damage per hit"". thus being adjusted accordingly.

This can be supplemented quickly for an example like:

**Channeling base costs:**

1 Energy: Dual Daggers, Nunchaku, Sparring, Fists

2 Energy: Daggers, Fists,Claws

3 Energy: Dual Swords, Sword and Shield, Nikana, Tonfa, Whip

4 Energy: Swords, Rapier, Blade and Whip, Machete (lol) Polearms, Staves, Glaives

5 Energy: Heavy Blades, Hammers, Scythes, Gunblades, Glaives. 

BUT. 

Some may disagree with some of these but it's just a general idea of how it should be since more # of hits to reach same amount of damage means more energy cost for same result, meaning the heaviest, higher dps and slowest of weapons benefit the most from channeling since i believe it being per swing and not per enemy hit. 

**ANOTHER SOLUTION**

Another idea, is to make Channeling a toggle energy drain.

What this means is you can choose when to channel or not at will, but all attacks will gain the channel bonus damage during the duration, REGARDLESS of weapon type. Regardless of multi-hit factors. 

This will solve all the inconsistency problems between weapon types and channeling.

What this ALSO does is channeled blocking, won't take your 800 energy bar down to 0 when blocking a single machine gun.

It will have the channeling block effects for the duration of your energy pool drop!

This makes it so you can almost channel whenever you want at the cost of maybe uptime of warframe abilities. Putting more corrupted channeling mods would mean that you have more decisive ""power spikes"" when channeling and when not opening up more builds. 

**2.**Give us a reason to use energy on melee weapons over warframe abilities. I don't know if the 50% damage increase is enough, or it's the fact that we lose a massive amount of efficiency on life strike, but something needs to be done about it. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Air Melee, Mobility and Manuevers**

One of the biggest problems with Melee 2.0 is the fact that it lost many features when parkour 2.0 came out and these were never supplemented nor made for.

 

Now I know coptering may have been ""toxic"" or unhealthy, or glitchy, or not intended, whatever you want to call it.

That's fine, it's gone, slide attacks of less momentum and there is a static cooldown between each one i get it i get it.

 

But we lost directional melee too.

 

And the only reason it was removed was not due to it being abusive (hi tipedo :)) but because they wanted to replace it with Bullet Jump and double jump. 

That's FINE. We can now still be mobile in the air thank you.

 

But you know my problem with it? 

have you tried taking down a mod of ospreys without running a primed reach on your orthos??

IT'S A NIGHTMARE.

 

* Collision boxes are horrid, you collide with the air below them. 
* Air attack sucks and makes you stand still so if they sway even a bit you miss
* melee attack hit boxes suck in general, air melee is the worse
* Only a few weapons have good air melee, namely hammer and scythers
* They just don't register, aiming and positioning is not granted nor rewarded
 

**Short Term Goals:**

Maybe directional melee should return? i don't know.

But you know what I'd love even more?

Archwing Lock on ONLY when both you and the target are close to each other AND in mid-air.

I think this would solve a ton of aerial issues that people have in PVE.

Allow us to lock onto targets, as long as we meet the following requirements;

* We are within X meter of the target
* We are airborne (jump attacks only) 
* We are aiming at the target
* When these conditions are met, I think lock on is very appropriate for all stages in the game and it still requires you to position and time yourself accordingly, but not come out with petty non sensible rewards.

**Long Term Goals:**

I think Warframe should introduce Aerial combos.

For those of you who don't play Devil May Cry, or perhaps don't know street fighter air combos or whatever, what this is is specific unique combos in the air. 

How DMC does it, is there is a certain melee button you press to ""launch"" the target in the air, kind of like an uppercut with a sword.

This button is separate from your normal attack. 

After launching your opponent in the air, instead of waiting for them you can jump in the air too and strike them multiple times.

If you perform correct button inputs, you'll actually do a pretty neat combo while both in the air!

I think this would be very cool, and very useful for Warframe. 
I think the only argument against this is that people may not need it against weaker foes, and you are totally right. But if you want to kill that bombard, but maybe keep them off the ground for extra crowd control or other enemies, give us the ability to launch them in the air and attack them then while we are isolated. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWAKIG7Gt8

Now I don't think it should be exactly like this, nor should you be able to float infinitely, but I don't think it's out of the question considering all the physical capabilities warframes can perform so far. 

This change would open up SO MANY THINGS for Sword Alone in Warframe and would attract people from all around to play the game because you can't find it in any other mmo! (except you Blade and Soul, i'm keeping an eye on you.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lastly, I just wanted to bring up something else.

Charge attacks.

Now I'm not sure what the solution for this should be, whether the % charge time outweighs spamming E, but another problem I have that would be solved with the alternate key, is the fact that you are unable to pull off a charge attack if the stance you are using has a pause combo at the beginning.

For example, the most recent devstream mentioned an Arbiters of Hexis augment for the Silva and Aegis, where blocking damage would be absorbed and that gained damage could be released with a charge attack (much like equinox). 

While this is still possible with Final Harbringer, you'd be forced to use the charge attack during mid combo not at the beginning, because attempting a charge attack would make you do the Dark Light combo.

So should one opt for 11th storm? or keep the skill cap of using the charge attack during a combo and not ""when you want on demand""? 

All in all alternate key bindings would solve this.

Arthas's model is outdated, and while his kit is good it doesn't fit gameplay today.

Arthas suffers from not being able to 1 v 1 well.. anyone! Which is sad considering he beat Illidan in the lore.

--------------------------------------------

As for Tyrael, we have his mana problems. I think his heroic abilities are very useful and fine, I also like the idea behind his Q, where you can choose to teleport or not. I also don't like his lack of dueling potential considering who he is. 

I'm also a fan of the team shield though wish there was more impactful gameplay. Perhaps a flat shield amount, spread between your team, but if you are by yourself the shield will stack at 50% efficiency for you. (EX 1,000 damage shield between 5 ppl (200 each) 250 shield if 4 ppl around around, 300 shield if 3 people are around, 400 shield if 2 people, 500 if one.)

His E is ""good"" but also is not very impactful. I remember when I first picked up the Archangel of Justice I was like, okay Q is cool, W could be useful, but when I used his E I was like: ""That's it?!"" what? did it even do anything? i just see some glowing tattoo on the ground. I think this is the ability that needs to be changed the most, or moved to his trait on every 3 autos or something.

Lastly, his trait. It promotes dying. Which i guess in some cases is fine for a Warrior but it doesn't feel good, rewarding, or even useful in a game where you aren't dying, which you technically shouldn't be dying.

Other frames ALWAYS benefit from Power Efficiency. What if, the more energy volt spent, the more powerful the ability. This would make people opt for strength/high energy pool builds over efficient ones and make him unique. Right now, I personally am tired of always seeing a streamline of some sort on every frame. If Primed Streamline came out it would be a staple, where as the only other staple mods in the game are Serration/Primed Point Blank/Pressure Point. 

The idea was to have a passive that made it so the more energy you spent, the more you would get out of an ability. 

Basically, every. single. frame. in the game will benefit from Power Efficiency. Some frames like Loki, don't need Power Strength, some Frost builds vary between Strength, Range, and Duration, Excalibur can build for damage, or late game cc in the form of a Blind, where Chroma's effigy/breath isn't good enough to bother with range mods and instead strength and duration is the way to go for Elemental Ward and Vex Armor.

My point is all frames will benefit from Power Efficiency, but what if Volt could be the outlier?

----------------------------------------------

Passive 1 : Static Shuffle:  Moving between attacks builds up static charges that are released on your next attack doing bonus electricity damage. (Basically the one that will be going live per devstream)

Passive 2 : Arc Core :  Volt's abilities scale with Power Strength, but will also scale with the amount of Energy spent on the ability. 1% per 1 energy spent.

Passive 3: Recharge Reactor: Electricity procs restore 1% of Volt's maximum energy.

--------------------------------------------

FOR EXAMPLE.

Volt, with max power strength,

 using **Shock:**  Volt releases an arc discharge at a specified location that can chain to enemies within 7 / 10 / 12 / 15 meters of each point of contact. The arc can chain a maximum of 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 times and inflicts 75 / 100 / 125 / 200  Electricity damage with a 100% status chance to each enemy.

At max power strenght Shock can deal up to 618 damage! 

but what if this ability did 1% more damage for 1% more energy spent?

-------------------------------------

Say you have 100% Power Efficiency (the default) and Shock costs 25 energy. The Shock would deal 200 damage. 

Say you have 50% Power Efficiency (Half of the default) and Shock now costs 50 energy. The shock would deal 400 damage.


-----------------------------------------

Since Volt Prime has a very large energy pool I think this could work. People would opt for Primed Flow in place of a mod like Streamline. People could still use both, but on a Strength build this would make Volt scale harder in a single cast of an ability.

My goal for Arthas is to allow players to focus on two - three kinds of playstyles

* A damage Warrior

* A tank Warrior

* An ""Army Leader"" type warrior.

I think all of the above are viable versions for Arthas, as he is a Deathknight, heavily armoured, and extremely dangerous at close range. In addition, being the Lich King means he has powers over both Frost and the Undead.

----------------------------------------------------------

**Frostmourne Hungers**

Cooldown: 12 

NEW: Frostmourne hungers cannot miss. 

NEW:  Every third attack against the same target will do 50% increased damage and restore 20 mana. 

NEW:  Every hero kill will permanently increase the damage bonus by 5%. (Max 50%) 

Activate to make your next Basic Attack strike immediately, do 100% increased damage, and restore ~~30~~ 40 Mana.

*Explanation* Overall, a big buff to Frostmourne hungers. The idea behind this is to have him passively do great damage in extended duals, while still having the option to instantly activate the ability.

----------------------------------------------------------

**Death Coil**

~~50~~ 80 Mana 

Cooldown: ~~9~~ 8 seconds

NEW:  This ability deals double damage to non-heroic enemies.

Deals 360 (171 + 4% per level) damage or 8% of the target's health (higher of both.)

Can be self-cast to heal for 522 (248 + 4% per level) Health.

------------------------------------------------------------

**Howling Blast**

~~70~~ 100 Mana 

Cooldown: ~~12~~ 10 seconds

NEW: Frostmourne Hungers will refresh its cooldown if used on an enemy rooted by Howling Blast.

Root enemies within the target area for 1.5 seconds and deals 149 (71 + 4% per level) damage.

--------------------------------------------------------------

~~Frozen Tempest~~ Plate of the Damned

Cooldown: ~~1~~ 12 seconds

Mana: ~~15~~ 100

Basic attacks, damaging abilities, and minion attacks against Arthas will cause his armor to retaliate, dealing 106 (50 + 4% per level) damage to nearby enemies and slowing them by 6% of 3 seconds. This slow can stack up to 30%. (1 second cooldown per cold retaliation) 

NEW: Arthas can activate this ability to have his armor expel the blasts of cold for 6 seconds. During this time, no single attack or spell can deal more than 20% of Arthas's maximum health. 

This ability does nothing when on cooldown. 

**Explanation:** Instead of a mana drain aoe, this armor will proc every time Arthas is damage. This makes it better for Arthas when he is taking damage. If foes choose not to attack and just run, Arthas can still manually active the armor for 6 seconds.

**Passive** Nearby fallen minions have a 30% chance to respawn as a Ghoul to fight for Arthas. These Ghouls have 10% of Arthas's attack and health and will only continue down the lane they were summoned until death. 

When a Ghoul dies, Arthas is healed for 586 (278 + 4% per level) Health. 

** Active** Summons 5 Ghouls that will follow and fight for Arthas that last 15 seconds. 

Pressing R again will redirect the target Ghouls should attack. They will attempt to surround the enemy.

**Explanation:** Instead of spamming R to heal you, Ghouls will automatically heal you when they die. This creates counterplay in exchange for the passive buff Arthas will be receiving. Enemy's can choose to avoid the ghouls and just kill Arthas, but is hard to do with aoe in the game. Or they can choose to kill all the ghouls first, that way Arthas who may already be at full health, has ""wasted"" heals.

**Frostbrood Rider**

Sindragosa flies twice as far.

Arthas then summons a Frostbrood to ride for 80 seconds. This grants Arthas permanent mount speed when not in combat, and the ability to travel across the map with a brief delay on a 30 second cooldown. 

The Frostbrood will passively attack nearby enemies, prioritizing Heroes--Structures--Then minions. This attack deals small aoe damage equal to 30% of Arthas's basic attacks, slowing them by 30%.

The difference is the bonuses when evading, as well as the synergy required. 

* Ahsoka

* Luminara

* Talia

* Old Ben

* Cad Bane

* Darth Maul 

So before people cry for a Dooku nerf, who I think, is well designed and is a good standard for what all characters in the game should achieve (power utility wise), keep in mind that his leader could be replaced with the above.

The DIFFERENCE is that only he, and Old Ben apply this evasion to all allies regardless of class, as well as Offense Up which is very powerful. 

-----------------------------------------------

Personally, if I had it my way, accuracy should be a stat/buff.

It would open a lot more strategic synergy, strategies, statistics, and gameplay as everything else SHOULD have a counter (Offense vs Defense, Speed vs tanky, crit vs anti crit)

Evasion seems to be the only stat that doesn't have this counter.

In the mean time, if Dooku's leader really creates a problem, which it shouldn't because EVERYONE has a leader that ""takes"" the meta, it was Sid, it then became Phasma, QGJ, and now it's Dooku, then I think the solution would be to make it so only Dark Side allies gain the bonus.

This prevents hybrid teams from becoming too powerful and would put the leader ability on par with the other % evasion ones.

HOWEVER.

Dooku thematically is probably one of the best tactical leaders of his time... I can't think of anyone superior to him considering his inclusion in the  Clone Wars

These master skins are very similar to the base standard skins of the character, but with certain updates.

Regardless, with good mechanics one can have a pretty decent laning phase along with powerful sustain during team fights on top of good initiation.

This power revolves around surviving burst.

What if Aatrox's Q, maybe with slightly increased delay, could curve while he is in flight before hitting the ground?

I think this would be a minor buff, but would give Aatrox the ability to outplay a lot of things in the game.

Same goes for his heroic, Adaptation. Gain damage reduction and heal?

I'm sure it's STRONG in game, but it's hardly thematic. 

In my mind, Dehaka should actually evolve, both ability/gameplay wise as well as cosmetically.


-----------------------------------------------

Quoting Dehaka, he states that if the enemy's weapons grow stronger, he will grow armor. If they grow defenses, he will grow claws. Or some variant of that.

I think Dehaka should do exactly that and have a much more interesting Trait. 

In addition to this, Heroes of the Storm's version of evolving and adapting seems to just be healing.

That's lame if you ask me.

-----------------------------------------------

Essence Collection - Enemies will drop essence when they die. 2 for minions, 10 for heroes. 

Upon reaching 100 Essence, Dehaka can consume this to permanently evolve one of his attributes for the remainder of the match. 

* Evolve Claws - Increased basic attack range, damage, and every attack will apply a debuff amplifying further damage to that target by 10% max 5 stacks. 

* Evolve Armor - Permanent 15% damage reduction. +1% the first time he takes damage, +2% the second time he takes damage,+3% the third time he takes damage. Decays after 10 seconds of not receiving damage. Max 40% damage reduction.

* Evolve Flesh - Permanent bonus 20% Health. Increases all regeneration effects by 20%. 

------------------------------------------------

Heroic - Adaptation - Dehaka temporarily transforms to fit the situation's need in order for him to thrive and survive. 

* When activated below 15% health, gain a 50% shield, and crowd control immunity for 5 seconds.

* When activated near an enemy tower or fortress, gain 100% increased damage to them for 5 seconds

Adaptation Level 20 

Depending on the last enemy you attacked:

* Against assassin's gain 25% movement speed and block the next spell against you

* Against tanks, gain Giant Slayer dealing a % of their maximum health

* Against supports, attack will apply heal block preventing them from healing themselves and allies. 

---------------------------------------

Conclusion: I think instead of essence and adapting and evolving just being ""regenerate health"" there could be better decision making in WHAT to evolve when the scenario calls for it.

I think this would thematically more fit a Primal Zerg.

Right now he just licks his wounds when he has essence, he doesn't really evolve.  ",heroesofthestorm,Why is the HotS translation of Evolving and Adaptation = Healing.

**Shot Bio**

[Quinlin Vos](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/f/f9/QuinlanHS.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150727050605) was a Jedi Master through the Clone Wars who was known as being somewhat of a maverick and rebellious throughout his life. 

He was the padawan to Jedi Master Tholme, and the Master to Aayla Secura during her padawan years.

He had the unique ability of psychometric reading. Psychometry was the Force ability of deducing information about people or events associated with an object solely by touching it. Whoever used that ability received input from sight, sound, and emotions.

*""That touchy-feely stuff you do with things does come in handy.""
""It's called psychometry, thank you very much.""*

―Akar-Deshu and Quinlan Vos


This made him an excellent tracker, and thus most of his missions prior and during the Clone Wars revolved around combating the criminal underworld. 

Later during the Clone Wars, he was given the task to assassinate Count Dooku. The Jedi council determined that he was too dangerous to be kept alive despite Jedi beliefs of compassion. Because of this, and other factors such as a partnership with Asajj Ventress, Dooku's former apprentice, Quinlan Vos slow succumbed to the dark side. He was convinced that the only way of defeating a Sith Lord such as Dooku would require such. 

Later during the Clone Wars Quinlan was captured and tortured by Count Dooku. Eventually, through dark side manipulation he was brought over to the dark side itself and became an agent of the separatist. Think, Winter Soldier variant from Marvel of Star Wars. 

*""We lost our way. We lost it when we decided to use assassination, a practice so clearly of the dark side, for our own ends... All that has happened since—Vos succumbing to the dark side, the deaths he has directly and directly caused, the secrets leaked, the worlds place in jeopardy—all of this can be traced back to that single decision. Masters, I submit to you that Vos' fall was of our making...""*

―Obi-Wan Kenobi speaking up for Vos in a Jedi Council hearing



Towards the end of the Clone Wars he had the opportunity of killing Dooku but stopped himself in order to embrace Asajj one last time before her death after she took a fatal blow from Dooku's Force Lightning. 

He then was allowed back into the Jedi Council, though they were hesitant in this decision he continued a path towards redemption.

It is unknown if Quinlan Vos survived Order 66. He was on Kashykk during that time. In Legends it says he survived and married another Jedi. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Powers and Abilities

* Psychometric reading - The ability to reveal and see memories by coming close to or in physical contact with an individual, or object. This allowed him to track down most anyone, as well as ""relive"" events or experience visions depending. This allowed him to technically read minds, or better yet, lies would not phase him. Any effect on the environment could be read by touching an object that was involved. 

* Lightsaber Duelist - Renown as one of the best Lightsaber duelists. Taking on Mace Windu, and Count Dooku alike. He originally learned Ataru, from his master while training as a Jedi. Later, Vaapad techniques were passed down from Mace Windu and Sora Bulq. Under tutelage by Count Dooku, he was taught aspects of Makashi that he weaved into his own fighting style making use of graceful parries but still being able to pull off aggressive, aerial maneuvers as well. It should be noted that he bested Sora Bulq himself, one of the best Jedi Swordsman of the era who was specifically chosen to help develop Vaapad alongside Mace Windu. Lastly, Quinlan Vos also practiced Shien, in the reverse grip form. 

* Force Cloak - Passed down from his master, Tholme, Quinlan Vos possessed the ability to Force Cloak. He also passed this down to his own padawan Aayla Secura. This is a technique that used the force to manipulate light and sound waves to become ""invisible"". 

* Force Lightning - In the legends iteration of Star Wars, Quinlan Vos was successfully able to use Force Lightning after learning the technique from Count Dooku. 

* Force Choke - Originally learning the ability from Asajj Ventress, Quinlan used this power multiple times against his foes. 

* Espionage and Counter Intelligence - Since most of his Jedi missions revolved around fighting the criminal underworld, Quinlan Vos developed amazing knowledge and skill when it came to spying. This was further shown in his tracking of Count Dooku, as well as during his brief betrayal to the republic where he influenced many battles in favor of the Confederacy by using his own knowledge of his former allies against them.

*""Well, since you're suddenly so interested in my tracking abilities, they went this way."" ""I never doubted you.""*

―Quinlan Vos and Obi-Wan Kenobi, while on the hunt for Ziro


------------------------------------------------

**My Goal for the character**

My goal for an iteration of Quinlan Vos in the Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes game is for him to be a somewhat, different and rebellious Jedi. I want to compliment his theme of being a radical in his own way. In addition to this I want to include dark side elements as his switching between the two sides of the force is very thematic to his character development and his personal struggles. Another important aspect is his skills in, to put it short, being a spy. He fought the Criminal Underworld for most of his ""career"". This mainly involved fighting off scoundrels, bounty hunters, and hutt dealings. Lastly, I think his versatile Lightsaber skills should influence his kit. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Cosmetic**

Quinlan Vos will use a standard two handed grip when attacking Tanks. A one-handed grip when attacking Attackers. A reverse grip when attacking Supports. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**The Stats**

I won't go too in-depth here on specifics. I'll just mention the more important stats. I picture him as a tank/attacker. Squishier than Savage Opress, but with dangerous damage similar to Aayla Secura. His Speed I think should be mediocre. His raw power will come from extended trades.

Assume these values are for a level 70 max geared character in today's game. 

Health:  13,500 Health

Speed:  130

Potency:  125%

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Abilities**

Quinlan Vos is a powerful rebellious Jedi who can inflict statuses that hinder character classes, apply debuffs to targets across the board, and counters stealth and scoundrels alike behind the front lines.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Basic Ability - Insurgent Strike** - Quinlan Vos strikes with his Lightsaber, dealing physical damage. This attack has different effects which are determined by the type of enemy he is attacking.

* When attacking a Support or Healer - 30% chance to apply Ability Block for 1 turn.

* When attacking an Attacker - 30% chance to apply Offense Down for 1 turn.

* When attacking a Tank - 30% chance to Health Down for 1 turn. 


Rank 2: +5% Status chance

Rank 3: +5% Damage

Rank 4: +10% Status Chance 

Rank 5: +10% Damage

Rank 6: +15% Status Chance

Rank 7: +15% Damage

**Explanation**: In tribute towards his lightsaber capabilities, this basic attack is designed to counter specific classes. The debuff only lasts 1 round and the damage is normal but solid. At max rank the chance to apply the debuff is at 60%. 


--------------------------------------------------------------

**Special Ability - Maverick Blow** - Quinlan Vos deals Special Damage to all enemies. Enemies that are above 50% health after taking damage, have a Damage Over Time applied to them for 3 turns. Enemies that have below 50% health after taking damage, have Healing Immunity applied to them for 2 turns.. - 4 Round Cooldown

Rank 2: +5% Damage

Rank 3: +10% Damage

Rank 4: -1 Cooldown

Rank 5: +5% Damage

Rank 6: +10% Damage

Rank 7: Removes all debuffs from Quinlan Vos and applies them to the enemy. 

**Explanation**: The idea here is to make him one of the few Jedi with an aoe damage ability. Since he usually ""flies solo"" Quinlan Vos has been able to combat multiple foes at the same time. The ability is designed to whittle down the enemy with damage over time at the beginning of the match. Then keep them down later in the match by preventing healing. Lastly, at Rank 7, Quinlan will take any debuffs applied to him and apply them to his enemies. Kind of like a reverse-yoda but less reliable. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------

**Unique Passive - Psychometry** - Quinlan Vos can attack units under Stealth and ignores the effects of Taunt.  

Rank 2: +25% turn meter when attacking an enemy under stealth, or an enemy whose ally is taunting for them. 

Rank 3: +10% turn meter gain

Rank 4: +15% turn meter gain

Rank 5: +50% chance to apply Speed Down to enemies under stealth, or an enemy whose ally is taunting for them. 

Rank 6: Stealth and enemies behind Taunt cannot dodge attacks.

Rank 7: Whenever an enemy who has Stealth, or Taunt, attacks or is attacked, +50% chance to attack them.  

**Explanation**: This ability let's Quinlan sense the sound, light, and emotion in the area by associating himself with the events that have taken place there by simply interacting with an object. For the game, I thought it would make sense that his Tracking prowess would let him bypass and punish characters trying to evade him and under the effects of stealth. Taunt is also thrown in there as his tracking is almost perfect and cannot be thrown off or distracted.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------

**Unique Passive - Criminal Counter** - Scoundrel Enemies have 10% reduced Critical Chance when attacking Quinlan Vos. 

Rank 2:  -5% Critical Chance for Scoundrel Enemies

Rank 3:  -5% Critical Chance for Scoundrel Enemies

Rank 4: -10% Critical Damage for Scoundrel Enemies

Rank 5: -10 % Critical Damage for Scoundrel Enemies

Rank 6: Quinlan Vos gains 25% Offense and 25% Defense for the rest of the battle whenever he defeats a Scoundrel. 

Rank 7: Scoundrel enemies cannot evade or resist the damage and effects of Quinlan Vos's attacks. 

**Explanation**: Kind of like Bounty Hunter bane on the side of the Jedi, Quinlan Vos was renown for combating the Criminal Underworld throughout the galaxy. Thus, his skill of spying, espionage, counter-intelligence, and tracking grant Quinlan anti-scoundrel capabilities in the game.

----------------------------------------------------------------- 

**Gameplay:**

Quinlan Vos is very versatile, even when facing enemies who are not scoundrels, characters who do not have stealth, and team comps who utilize the taunt ability. 

Even without these bonuses, his attacks inflict good damage and important debuffs that counter the strengths of an enemy during the situation at hand. 

A reliable Jedi for your squad, Quinlan can adapt, track, and overcome a variety of enemies as he has experienced the life of a Jedi, studied the works of the criminal underworld, and has felt and utilized both the Light side of the Force, and the Dark. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

**Conclusion** Quinlan Vos Character Concept revolves around a Jedi who is reliable in inflicting useful debuffs against the enemy, specific to their class strengths. In addition to this, Quinlan Vos can take out sneaky back line cannons that need protection and setup, all the while fighting off scoundrels and criminals for a living.

This is often seen when using Mace or QGJ to remove buffs from an enemy, where 2 or so buffs get removed but for some reason one still remains. 

I'm sure you can think of the examples off the top of your head but unfortunately i right now haven't been keeping track.

--------------------------------------

The reason this is more important than ever is because of Ahsoka's new passive.

You can't really see if she has the bonus health or speed, you have to keep track and calculate and memorize in your mind if a crit actually took away a buff and plan accordingly.

Now the first solution people might come up with is, well hey let's make it a visible green box buff.

But that's the problem,

It isn't a buff you can remove normally with certain abilities. It's only removed on a critical hit.

--------------------------------------------

**In every game, one of the most frustrating things is lack of clarity. I fear this is evolving and needs to be handled.**

-----------------------------------------------

* Another example of this is having to keep an eye on turn meter gain (Can be supplemented with maybe colored font that says +/- # turn meter!)

* Another example of this is not knowing the cooldown of certain abilities. Sure you can memorize that Lumi's heal has 4 rounds left since you just used it, but there is no way to know if your Jedi Consular successfully got a cd reduction when landing his basic. 

* Another example of lack of clarity is Yoda's Tenacity up. Few people know that it's a 99% chance to resist debuffs. At first, you might think the chances of applying something is small but by no means is that small. (that's what she said)

* Another example of this is simply, what does Armor actually do???

* Another example of this is how much exactly is Evasion Up, Health Up, Defense Up, etc. It doesn't state it. ",SWGalaxyOfHeroes,"As the game evolves, there seems to be a great lack of clarity. There needs to be a better indication of buffs in the game now.

I believe the following will make Mace Windu a balanced, appropriate, yet powerful character worth farming.

------------------------------------------------

**Smite**

One of the most basic, straightforward Specials in the game. It does Special Damage and will remove all buffs applied to that character.

Although it gets neat damage boosts from ranking it up, it is by no means on par with a similar Jedi, Qui-gon Jinn.

QGJ's Humbling Blow does something similar, but upon successful removal it grants your entire team Offense Up. This is an AMAZING buff for your whole team, essentially meaning you do not need Poggle the Lesser if you can pull this ability off. 

**My Suggestion:**  Smite should have the ability to not miss. This will compliment his ""reliable?"" kit very well and will give the player ideal decision making prowess. You don't have to worry about missing if you wish to really finish/remove buffs from someone. This can happen at say rank 7 or something. I think by making Smite unmissable/undodgable it will have a healthy play pattern that is strong against dodge characters, but otherwise negligible.

Other than that, I think its name should be changed. it's weird that Mace and Anakin share so much in this game.  

-------------------------------------------------------

**Shatterpoint**

This ability has been discussed through the ages.

The short version of my explanation is this.

Shatterpoint relies SO MUCH (too much in my opinion) on RNG. (Random Number Generator) aka ""statistical luck""

Firstly, Shatterpoint has a 45% chance of applying Shatterpoint. For arguments sake let's say this is half the time. Keep in mind Mace Windu is very slow, so the chance that this comes up will be towards the end of the first round during Mace's turn. If successful, he gains turn meter and admirable damage.

Second, the target chosen is COMPLETELY RANDOM. It can go on the stealthed leia, it can avoid a taunter, it can go on the high-tenacity characters and fail etc. 

Thirdly, your attack actually has to land. If there are any dodge factors, your attack can miss effectively wasting Shatterpoint. Dodge is common, and accuracy is not a stat. 

Fourth, Tenacity can resist the Potency of Shatterpoint resulting in a chance of Shatterpoint failing. What this means is even if you are lucky to get the 45% roll for Shatterpoint to happen, and even if it goes on that random character you maybe can hit, and even if you supposedly will land your attack on them, they STILL have a chance to resist the application of the debuff. 

To conclude this explanation, the turn meter gain of Mace Windu is **ACTUALLY BUGGED** . In a good way.
Right now if you attack in general, Mace Windu gains turn meter. This is what is keeping him viable! This bug makes him, AFTER the first round, pretty fast since he only has to gain 78% turn meter instead of 100% turn meter as long as he can attack. 

**My Suggestion:** Shatterpoint should apply to all enemies. Now hear me out, people might cry OMG THIS IS OP IT'S LIKE POE but it's not. Please read first.
The exposed debuff only lasts for the duration of Mace Windu's turn. That means, that turn, only ONE exposed debuff can be procd. Only one character is going to be attacked that turn. The debuff can still not be applied, due to the 45% chance hindrance, the targets it successfully lands on will still be random, the attack still has to actually land, and the debuff can still be resisted by tenacity.

If the devs are dead set on Mace Windu having to rely on praying to rngesus every hour of the day, so be it. This change will at least give him the opportunity to make a strong, informed decision during gameplay.

My other suggestion would be to remove one of the other RNG factors completely. Whether it be that the debuff cannot be resisted, exposed is 100%, you can choose your target, or the enemy can't dodge the attack. 

My original suggestion slightly dampens the other rng factors in exchange for actually removing one.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TL;DR/Conclusion: Shatterpoint is bugged, always giving mace turn meter but he still sucks. Make his smite undodgeble so it is a reliable special. Change Shatterpoint's RNG reliance and you will have a happy healthy mace windu.

They do this often with things like, Mag when Greedy Pull was the most used ability. 

I know in PVE it is ""fine"" and got a lot of utility from the recent Shadow Debt event.

I also know that it is currently in a very unhealthy state in PVP.

But regardless, anyone whose played this game for a while can most likely agree with the following points on melee: 

* How 99% of the kills are ""spam e"" kills

* How often/impratical/no time for some pause, and hold button combos are as they require timing which in turn is also impractical when running something like berserker

* How air melee is non existant, it's a jump attack that holds 0 momentum, you jump and slash the air in front of you with no carry (bar scythes and heavy weapons)

* How the new Charge Attacks are extremely inefficient. One would never find a time to use them unless, looking for a large chunk of damage for a singular attack. If there were an enemy who only exposed themselves to one instance of damage before closing up, it is the ONLY time a charge attack would be optimal. currently it isn't

* How many weapons are left in the dust. Whether it be the Silva and Aegis's sad 35 heat damage, the no further tweaks on nunchaku, how many people are just using Orthos + primed reach, or the nikana and war/broken war. 

* How channeling needs a rework, for the only corrupted channeling mod people use is life strike, and only channel to heal up instead of as a sacrifice in warframe abilities for sword alone DPS

* How Blocking is inefficient as blocking currently slows down your mobility, and in turn any damage you might block you could have instead gap closed to the enemy and kill them

* Mentioned a bit in an earlier point, but how stances lock you in an UNCANCELLABLE animation that also makes you for the most part, stationary as opposed to mobile (bar a few attacks like Guiding Light from the Blind Justice stance, Final Harbringer, or the Glaive combos)

It would also give an incentive to play conclave for mods to use OUTSIDE of conclave so it isn't hindered by the ""Archwing"" effect.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd7FixvoKBw

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So as you may know, Riot somewhat admitted that Aatrox needs work / didn't work out as intended.

Aatrox had a problem for a while of being too strong or too weak and hard to balance. 

His kit wasn't overly complicated.

He was a hyped champ for a long time but I think was missing some key elements that I hope are addressed in my idea for a rework

* He has wings. He should use them. I'm not saying let him fly over stuff, but a war demon with wings should be flying across the battlefield with a massive sword swinging at mobs of enemies in a blur of rage.

* His lore says he ""provoked"" wars or induced soldiers with a kind of bloodlust, causing them to enjoy the thrill of battle, to crave war, and go HAM on their enemies. 

* He is supposed to dive in, and be a threat enough to take down to absorb spells and let his team follow up OR risk him being alive and thriving in long engaged combat/war. 

* Auto attack based champs are balanced around either crit, or on-hit effects. The former of which shares a lot of itemization with adcs and requires either tanky juggernauts to thrive over a long period of time letting them take on 5 opponents by sacrificing mobility, or being a mobile assassin like auto attack based champ like yi, tryndamere, or technically xin zhao. Unfortunately they all fell prey to Devourer which has been tough to balance and is seeing more nerfs. Alongside feral flare and wriggles lantern it has always been a problem balancing these on-hit junglers. 

* Aatrox should not rely on autos but should be an AD caster who can use autos in his kit but doesn't rely on them. He is not a juggernaut cause he isn't supposed to be immobile or immortally tanky. But he isn't an ad assassin because he doesn't go in and out of battle. He is supposed to be a fighter with high sustain.

All in all, I hope this Aatrox rework does promote 3 things which will tie him together as a champion.

1. His lore - Promoting war, bloodlust, and battle. Being the mysterious ancient darkin warrior behind many conflicts, winning them, then disappearing into legend.

2. His kit - Sustained fighter: Massive sustain in the form of blood and reviving, weak when poked down or bursted down, but thriving in long fights

3. His species/character - Tall demon/darkin champion with massive sword or flies around crushing armies with a massive triple edged sword.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TL;DR:**   

* Abilities cost blood well meter instead of health

* Passive still has blood well revive, but charges with attacks, minions dying, and full restore on champs dying, instead of spending health for abilities. No more attack speed

* Q is the same but will aggro your lane minions to attack the enemy champion. Unaggro if enemy minions attack you or your minions

* W now grants 30% bonus to on-hit effects. (EX: Bork is 8% instead of 6% of current health on hit). Also, toggle now increases damage while doing damage to self on all abilities and attacks, or heals you on all abilities and attacks like death's dance.

* E same but can be aimed like Viktor laser for multiple angles (giggity)

* R gives attack speed and range. restores well to max but drains it over time. Ability ends when blood well is drained. Also, next three abilities have no cd but cost blood well still. (So if you use abilities too much massacre ends). Overlapping cc is less effective. It means Aatrox can dark flight 3 times around battle field, blades of torment more than once around the battlefield, etc. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chit Chat**

Hey there reddit. I know these reworks don't usually pan out. I just passed my midterm and it's spring break and my queue time is over 50 minutes now so I'm brainstorming here on Aatrox. 

As many of you know Aatrox was one of the most hyped champions in the history of League of Legends. He had an awesome mysterious lore build up where a shadowy silhouette would appear behind some ""violent"" champion's splash arts.

Aatrox is a Darkin, a mysterious ancient race known to be nothing but myths and legends. Aatrox in paticular has been known to change the tides of war, feeding off the bloodlust during battle for unknown reasons.

He's also apparently connected to Tryndamere, where he mentions that Tryndamere is his ""greatest creation"".

Anywho, to cut the chatter I just want to say that **My vision of Aatrox is to be an attack damage champion who thrives the longer a fight goes on through massive sustain and blood lust. Because he's tall, got awesome wings, and a giant unique ""living"" sword I envision him more as a terror in a sky of red. Think, gundam vs mobs, or sauron with wings.**

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Kit**

*Please know that i suck at math cause I'm not asian.* 

*Also he has more than one passive cause he wouldn't be a LoL champ if he didn't.*

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Passive: Blood Well** 

**1.** Aatrox empowers himself with the bloodlust in the air and the scent of war.  

Aatrox has many ways of gaining Blood Well stacks. 

* Max 100 charges. 

* Every time a minion within 1,000 range of Aatrox is brought below 50% health or dies, Aatrox stores 5 charges in his Bloodwell. This is capped at 10 charges per minion's lifespan.

* 5 charges per auto attack. Doubled against champions

* Nearby champion and allied deaths will grant Aatrox max charges. 

* Bloodwell charges decay 1 per second after not being in combat for 8 seconds.

* Recalling freezes the decay timer for 30 seconds

**2.** When Aatrox takes fatal damage, he is cleansed of all debuffs, fear nearby units for 1 second and go into stasis for 3 seconds. Aatrox regenerates **0.5/0.75/1%** of his maximum health for every 1 charge he had stored in his bloodwell upon taking the fatal damage. Minimum **20%** of max health. 

**Explanation:** Right now, Aatrox has to spend his health to build his blood well. In addition to this, it decays really fast. Being zoned out or recalling makes you return to lane extremely weak, becoming exposed to an all in. My idea is for Aatrox to passively gain charges in his Bloodwell while in lane, but can build it up faster when given the opportunity to attack. Lastly, the decay for recalling is extended. To balance the gain in strength, the bonus attack speed was removed due to immense inconsistencies with its bonus. Your attack animation would change a dozen times depending on its level, making microing Aatrox more difficult. Although Aatrox benefits from auto attacks just like any AD champion, I want him to be more of a caster rather than just another Yi/Jax/Xin Zhao etc. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Q - Basic Ability - Dark Flight**

**Cost:** 25 Bloodwell charges

**Cooldown:** 16/15/14/13/12

**PHYSICAL DAMAGE:** 70 / 120 / 170 / 220 / 270 (+ 50% bonus AD and + 80% AP Ratio)

**Bloodlust Duration: 2/3/4/5/6 Seconds

**Dash Range:** 650

**Area of Damage Radius:** 225

**Area of Knock up Radius:** 75

**ACTIVE:** Aatrox dashes to the target area after a brief delay, dealing physical damage to nearby units upon landing and knocking up all units in the epicenter for 1 second. Nearby allied minions will gain Bloodlust causing them to aggro onto the next target Aatrox attacks. If Aatrox is attacked by enemy minions for the next **3** seconds all nearby minions will ignore champion aggro and will attack each other. 

**Explanation: ** Almost identical to the current Dark Flight. I like the wind up for counterplay, as well as the impact Dark Flight plays in a fight. The difference here is the ability is very powerful in lane or when allied minions are nearby but by no means relies on them. It will aggro your creeps to the enemy, helping you win a trade by fueling their bloodlust. However if the enemy champion has minions too, the minions will go back to fighting each other making minion damage next to negligible in your duel. If the enemy minions are non-existent or cleared however, you have a small blood frenzied war lusting army of minions to help you fight. I want to reiterate, it can make a difference but the Dark Flight is not weaker than the current one if you don't have minions around. I changed the base damage to go up a bit, added an ap ratio for guinsoo's rageblade.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**W - Basic Ability - Darkin Warblade** 

*Ares is this Darkin's ancient weapon. In another world, it is the name for their God of War.*

-
-

**Passive: Ares** Due to the legendary nature of Ares crafting, this living sword has **10/15/20/25/30%** increased benefit for on hit effects. (explanation below)

-
-

**Toggle: Blood Thirst/Blood Price** 

**Cooldown:** 4 seconds *unchanged*

**Cost:** None

* When toggled with Blood Thirst, Aatrox will heal himself for **4/6/8/10/12%** of *all* damage dealt. 

* When toggled with Blood Price, Aatrox will increase his damage by **4/6/8/10/12%** of *all* damage but will inflict half that damage to himself. 

-
-


**Explanation:** So for starters, I named the sword Ares cause it didn't have a name :( . Aatrox's sword apparently talks, and even dances! I named it Ares cause it sounds cute but really means War. Next, Aatrox has increased benefit from on-hit effects. (Actual auto attack damage from ad is unchanged). Info on some numbers below this. As for the toggle, instead of relying on every 3rd auto attack, Aatrox will simply have the ability to choose to have greater sustain when dealing damage, or simply more damage at the cost of health. There is a static cooldown of 4 seconds, so it gives some room for everyone to be aware what Aatrox chose for the next few seconds. This let's you choose between bursting him down quick if he chose damage, or thinking twice since it looks like he's going to heal. 

**On-hit effects Ares enhancement numbers** 

That means at max rank: 

* Blade of the Ruined King will do 8% of the target's current health instead of 6%. 

* Frozen Mallet's slow will go from 40% to 53.3%, and it's duration from 1.5 seconds to 2 seconds

* Ravenous Hydra's cleave damage will go from 20-60% --&gt; 27-80%

* Spellblade will go from 200% of your base attack damage --&gt; 260% of your base attack damage

* Wit's End's 40 magic damage on-hit will be increased to 53 damage

* etc. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**E - Basic Ability - Blades of Torment**

**Cost:** 25 Bloodwell Charges

**Cooldown:** 12/11/10/9/8

**Range:** 500

**Slow Duration:**  1.75/2/2.25/2.5/2.75

ACTIVE: Aatrox unleashes two converging energy waves **down a target path**, dealing **75/110/145/180/205 (+60% Bonus AD and +60% AP)** magic damage to all units hit and slowing them by **40%.**

**Explanation:** I love the current version of this on Aatrox. It's a magic damage move that scales with hybrid ratios so you have a nice wave clear helping/good harass move that makes it a little difficult for people to build resistances against early. Now the move for the most part is the same, as I think it offers great damage and utility for a typical basic ability. My change here however is to make it like a Rumble ultimate or Viktor laser, in that you can aim it down a target path, rather than a straight line from Aatrox to origin point. This gives it more range (thus why i changed the stat range from 1,000 to 500) but you can have it fly in different directions. This is also sensible in a ""physics"" sense since Aatrox seems to cut the air/ground with his sword making invisible-liek wind cuts to create the marks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**R - Ultimate Ability - Massacre**

**Cooldown:** 80/70/60

**Attack Speed Bonus:** 60%

**Slow Resistance:** 20/30/40%

**Attack Range Total:** 350

ACTIVE: Aatrox maxes out his Blood Well, gains increased attack speed, attack range, as well as **1/2/3** charges of *""War""*. Massacre will drain 10 Blood Well charges per second and will end when reaching 0 Blood Well charges. Each charge of ""War"" allows Aatrox to cast his **next one/two/three Basic Abilities without cooldown** though they still cost 25 Blood Well charges eaech. However crowd control against the same champion is 50% as effective. 

**Explanation:** I expect this is where I will get the most criticism. My idea is to give Aatrox an attack speed and attack range boost like he already does, but also make it so he also resists slows so that it's harder to slow down his attacks or movement during this time. Massacre also will only stay up as long as Aatrox can keep his Blood Well up. This means consecutive attacks and champions dying will keep Massacre up. That means if 9 people died in a fight, about 10 seconds apart, Aatrox could have Massacre up for a minute and a half!!! But that scenario would probably not happen as deaths are hard to rely on. Lastly, I wanted him to have multiple charges on his basics. The reasoning for this is if you imagine Aatrox flying at high speed flying down to smash the enemies, flying away for another attack and swooping back in. The 3 charges will not be as effective with the crowd control, so you can't knock the same person up for 3 seconds (1 second apart) but you can use 3 Dark Flights to knock someone up for 1.75 seconds total. You can also use the triple Dark Flight for massive mobility. Or if you choose to use consecutive Blades of Torment you can deal strong aoe damage. Or use a mix and match!. Just remember! The next 3 basic abilities will have no cooldown, but still cost Blood Well charges. So if you use three spells right away, you will have about 2.5 seconds before your Blood Well runs dry and Massacre ends, so use them wisely and keep on fighting!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Conclusion** These changes are to make Aatrox still a damage/cc threat with a revive. He can dive in, die, and keep fighting. His kit is now more thematic around blood lust and war. His passive well charges as war rages on, his Q will invoke enemies to fight like in the lore, his W is about his ancient sword, instead of 3 hits something happens yous imply choose between more damage but her yourself, or sustain yourself. The ultimate allows Aatrox to dart around the battle, or cast many blades of torment. It still gives him attack speed and attack range, and this buff will last until his well runs dry.

Now a lot of people may disagree with this. Saying ""oh people just won't attack them then. Well hey! it's a win win.

**TL;DR** I think speed is stupid and shouldn't determine who is good and bad. Instead of straight buffing the slow chars, what about turn meter when attacked (like savage).

**New Game Mode: Duel of Fates**

Players will engage in 1 v 1 combat. Bring your best characters to earn shards for exclusive duelists!


**Available characters gained through dueling:**

* General Kenobi (Obi-wan Kenobi)

* Kit Fisto - Reworked

* Darth Maul - Buffed

---------------------------------------------------------

**Notes**

* You can fight ONE of the exclusive characters ONCE per day. You only have ONE chance. Winning the battle will grant you 5 shards of that character, while losing the battle will grant you none.

* This means it will take you a little over TWO MONTHS to 7-star ONE character. (5 shards a day if you win and play every day) 

* The BIGGEST thing to remember though is, you have one chance. Retreating, force-closing, etc. results in a loss and no rewards for that day. Bring your best character, and try for a win. 

* These fights aren't JUST fighting a 7-star variant. There are mini-challenges throughout the fight that may help you. You will choose between these, or simply attacking your opponent for success. 

--------------------------------------------------

**The Duels:**

-----------------------------------------------------------

1. ***General Kenobi Fight (See Character concept below for his kit)*** - General Kenobi is a very powerful defensive based duelist who thrives when buffed. Although he does low damage, he excels in prolonged fights. Fight his allies to help aid you in battle.

* General Kenobi will not have his leader ability for this fight

* General Kenobi will have 75% of the speed of your character. So every 4 turns you take he will only take 3. 

* Every 2 turns, a random Senator/Ambassador will spawn next to Kenobi. They have 50% chance evasion. They have 10 hp. Successfully killing them will remove all current buffs from General Kenobi. 

* Every 5th turn in a battle, General Kenobi will spawn 2 clone troopers. They deal very little damage, but one will apply offense down, the other will apply speed down. They are tanky as well, so you must choose between attacking them to prevent debuffs, or continue attacking General Kenobi for damage as he has no self form of sustain.

* Killing 2 senators at the **same time** will put Buff immunity on General Kenobi for 3 turns. 

-----------------------------------------------------------

2. **Kit Fisto Fight** - Kit Fisto is a Shii-cho master. The most basic of lightsaber forms. Dueling him requires **memorization** in his battle pattern.
 
* At the start of the battle, 3 large symbols will spawn ONE AT A TIME above Kit Fisto's head in a completely random and shuffled order A **Blaster**, a **Lightsaber** and **A hand using the force**. 

* For example, they will show ONCE at the start of the battle as:  blaster blaster lightsaber blaster force blaster lightsaber blaster force lightsaber blaster blaster

* The duel will go on as a normal 1 v 1 fight, but with a rock paper scissor game that will HELP influence the outcome of a fight but not determine it.

* Kit Fisto will secretly bare one of the symbols in the order shown as a hidden buff for that turn. Picking the right counter-symbol will enhance your attacks and your defense. 

* Blaster &lt; Lightsaber &lt; The Force &lt; Blaster

* For example:  Kit on turn one will have the Blaster buff (but it is hidden). If you memorized the pattern at the beginning of the battle, you will know this. Thus you will want to pick the Lightsaber buff at the beginning of your turn. After this, the turn plays out as normal, but if you picked his counter buff, you will deal 25% more damage, and Kit Fisto will deal 25% less damage for that turn. If you picked the weaker buff, he will do 25% more damage and you will deal 25% less damage. If you picked the same, the fight continues are normal.

----------------------------------------------------------

3. **Darth Maul Fight** - Darth Maul is a highly skilled assassin who is able to take on TWO foes at once. Bring your two best combatants, and try to keep them both alive!

* Darth Maul plays out as a normal character for this match with highly increased health

* The goal of the fight is to prevent one of your characters from falling. If they do, Darth Maul will gain ALL of his ""Power of Hated"" unique passive benefits, making the remainder of the fight very difficult. 

* The player will have 3 options throughout the fight, at the beginning of your turn, to apply TAUNT and HEALING IMMUNITY to **one character for one turn**. Be careful who you pick, as the taunter takes damage and cannot be healed for that turn.

------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------

**Character Balancing/Reworks**

----------------------------------------------------------

**Admiral Ackbar**

* Fixed multiple bugs, mainly including abilities not doing what was said in tooltip

* Tactical Genius now grants Advantage instead of Defense Penetration

* Tactical Genius turn meter will now overlap. If someone has 50% turn meter, they will gain a turn, then gain 50% turn meter afterwards.

--------------------------------------------------------

**Ahsoka Tano**

Ahsoka is currently a high crit/damage Jedi who can heal her team based on the damage dealt. Her main problem is her low health pool and very low speed. We decided to move a part of her leader ability, to her passive. This makes it so although she is innately slow, evading attacks will speed her up.

* **Quick Steps** – Jedi and Nightsister allies gain 14% Evasion. ~~Ahsoka Tano gains 25% Turn Meter whenever she Evades an attack.~~

* **Daring Padawan** – Ahsoka Tano gains 9% Max health for each living ally. In addition, she gains Evasion Up for 3 turns whenever an enemy is defeated. **NEW/MOVED: Ahsoka gains 25% Turn Meter whenever she Evades an attack.**

--------------------------------------------------------

**Boba Fett**

Boba is currently underwhelming in the damage department. He is squishy, but tanks by having a chance to revive. His ability block utility is great but he is still someone who can be ignored and left for last. We also want to make use of his flamethrower. We've added a new ability to gear up for that will make Boba deal aoe damage to enemies when his allies fall, that will make people think twice about saving him for last. On top of this it synergies with his leader ability.

* **NEW Unique Ability** - Flame Spitter: Whenever an ally falls in battle, Boba Fett will deal **very minor** special damage to all enemies, applying a Damage over time for 2 turns. **This damage overtime can critically hit**.

--------------------------------------------------------

**Cad Bane**

Cad Bane currently fills a high damage role with a supporting stun. He is squishy though and often finds himself dying before making a move. While we would like to make it so he gains speed and survivability through his Leader ability, we want to make it optional.

* Max health increased from 9303 - 11808

--------------------------------------------------------

**CT-7567 Rex**

While we're very happy with adding a Clone Support to the game, we found it unusual too that Rex has the lowest armor in the game despite his wardrobe. Instead of waiting for the Defense changes to pan out, we decided to give him some love in the mean time
Armor increased from 116 --&gt; 200 (Sorry Qui-gon)

--------------------------------------------------------

**Darth Maul**

We are overall happy with the snowballing potential Darth Maul has. But similar to Ahsoka, we don't want to abysmally slow Darth maul to rely on a leader ability to be fast in the game. We decided to raise his speed, but also grant an even faster Maul if using him as a leader.

Speed up from 93 -- &gt; 113

**~~Leader Ability~~ Unique Passive:  Dancing Shadows** – ~~All Sith allies~~ Darth Maul gains 17.5% Evasion and add +15% Turn Meter on Evade. **This effect is doubled when facing Jedi.** 

--------------------------------------------------------

**Darth Vader**

Although Darth is hard to farm until 7, feedback and scaling suggests even then he won't be that strong. We've decided to add a thematic move to the Sith Lord that will help promote his power against Jedi.

* **NEW Unique Ability - Force Choke:** Whenever an enemy uses a non-damaging ability, there is a 25-45% chance that the target will suffer minor special damage and be stunned instead. This chance is doubled against Jedi.

-------------------------------------------

**Eeth Koth**

Meant to be our anti-droid Jedi, Eeth suffers across the board from simply not being impactful regardless of facing droids or not. Since droids are very much crit based, we decided to change him into an anti-crit jedi when chosen to be the leader.

* **Stalwart Jedi Defender** – Jedi allies gain 25 Defense. Jedi allies who are attacked by droids have a 35% chance to inflict offense down and reflect 35% of the damage taken back to the droid. 

------------------------------------------------------

**Geonosian Soldier**

We are happy that glass cannons can exist in the game. But when the glass cannon is really a rock cannon that can fly really fast, it really begs the question, what can't Geo do other than utility?


Health reduced from 12323 --&gt; 10323



Armor reduced from 188 --&gt; 138

-----------------------------------------------------

**Grandmaster Yoda**

Yoda came out to be a great success as a utility master without the typical crowd control being mandatory. We are mostly happy with what he has to offer, but wanted to add a little more ""umph"" to his attack.

* **Masterstroke** - Deal Special damage to all enemies. In addition, for each positive status effect an enemy has, this attack deals 5 - 10% more damage and Yoda gains that effect for 3 turns. 

--------------------------------------------------

**Greedo**

Greedo hits hard for sure, but the 2 turn delay seemed to make people avoid using Thermal Detonator altogether. The gamble of gaining turn meter was too great, so we want to try and give you a ""free"" attack when the bomb goes off. In addition to this, his leader ability was almost identical to Boba Fetts, but worse. So we gave him a new one that helps debuff teams. 

* **Thermal Detonator** – Place Thermal Detonators on all enemies that explode after 2 Turns dealing Special damage and granting Greedo Critical Chance Up. Greedo gains 20% turn meter for each explosion. 

* **Leader Ability:  ~~Ambuscade~~ NEW: Dastardly** - Scoundrel's basic attacks against enemies will proc, and add +1 duration to debuffs. 

----------------------------------------------

**Jedi Knight Anakin**

Anakin is under debate for the main character of the Star Wars series. Making appearances in every film. We wanted to make Anakin an offensive based Jedi who thrived with anger as his allies fell. Since three of his four abilities already improve his offensive capabilities, we feel the need to help his crowd control and debuff prowess instead. In addition to this, we wanted to give Smite, the Savage Opress treatment to help snowball his damage.

* **Deft Bladework** - Deal Physical damage to target enemy with a 40% chance to inflict Healing and Buff Immunity for 2 turns. **NEW This chance is increased by 10% for every 10% health the enemy is missing after damage is dealt.**

* **Smite** - Deal Physical damage to all enemies and grant allies Offense Up for 2 turns if an enemy is killed. If the target has 20% Health or below, this attack deals massive damage and can't be Evaded (instakill).

------------------------------------------

**Jedi Knight Guardian**

Her utility chances are low, and although she can take a good amount of damage, the Jedi Knight Guardian lacks any REASON to take damage. Like many tanks, she is left for last. We think it's appropriate that as a guardian, she should protect her allies

* **Defend the Order** - While below 50% Health, Jedi Knight Guardian has +20% Tenacity and recovers 15% of her Max Health at the start of each of her turns. **NEW - When a Jedi Ally falls below 50% Health, Jedi Knight Guardian has a 35-50% chance to gain Taunt for 2 turns)

-----------------------------------------

**Kit Fisto Rework**

So to straight up give you an idea of Kit Fisto's strength. Compare him side-by-side with Count Dooku and he gets outmatched at every turn. The Kit Fisto changes will revolve around the Shii-Cho form, making him a Jedi who is renown for taking on multiple foes but overall just making him stronger across the board. 

**Basic: ~~Lightsaber Mastery~~ Superior Bladework** - Deal Physical damage to target enemy with a 30% chance to attack again. *Note Name change to be in-line with Anakin's move so both are called Bladewwork instead of one being an attack the other a passive*

Rank 2: + 5% Damage

Rank 3: + 10% Multi-attack chance

Rank 4: +  ~~+5~~ 10% Damage

Rank 5: + 10% Multi-attack chance

Rank 6: +  ~~+5~~ 15% Damage

Rank 7: ~~+5% Damage~~  Add 50% chance to gain 15% Turn Meter on hit

Rank 8: **NEW** Add 30% of damage is dealt to a random enemy. 

**Special Attack: Turn the Tide** - Deal Physical damage to all enemies with a 55% chance to grant all allies Potency Up for 2 Turns.

Rank 2: +5% Damage

Rank 3: +15% Bonus Effect Chance

Rank 4: ~~+5~~ +10% Damage

Rank 5: +15% Bonus Effect Chance

Rank 6: +5% Damage

Rank 7: ~~+5~~ +10% Damage

Rank 8: Bonus Effect Duration +1

**Jedi Protector** - ~~All allies gain 25% Tenacity and~~ All allies gain +25 Defense and +20% damage reduction from Area attacks

Rank 2: +5% Damage reduction

Rank 3: +10% Damage Reduction

Rank 4: +10 Defense

Rank 5: +5% Damage reduction 

Rank 6: +10% Damage Reduction

Rank 7: +15 Defense

Rank 8: Debuffs have -1 duration (cannot be dropped below 1). 

** ~~Superior Bladework~~ Shii-Cho** - Kit Fisto has a 35% counter chance and takes 20% reduced damage from bonus attacks. *Note: Bonus attacks include follow up attacks, assist attacks, and follow-up attacks.

Rank 2: +5% Damage reduction

Rank 3: +10% Damage Reduction

Rank 4: + 5% Counter Chance

Rank 5: +5% Damage reduction 

Rank 6: +10% Damage Reduction

Rank 7: +10% Counter chance

Rank 8: Every time Kit Fisto takes damage, he gains a stack of *Determination*. Each stack of Determination reduces damage he takes by 20%. All stacks are lost at the beginning of his turn. 

----------------------------------------------------------

**Mace Windu**
We are overall happy with the Mace Windu changes. We found two problems that we want to address but think Mace Windu will finally be in a spot he deserves. Smite was a decent ability that was simply outclassed by better version of it, while Exposed suffered from too much ""chance for it to happen"".


* ~~Smite~~ - Renamed **Tempered Aggresion** - Deal Special damage to target enemy and remove all positive status effects. This attack has 50% increased Critical Damage. (200% damage when it crits instead of 150%) and cannot miss.



* **Shatterpoint - At the start of each of his turns, Mace has a 40 - 60% chance to Expose **ALL** enemies until the end of his turn. In addition, Mace gains 25% Turn Meter and cannot miss whenever he attacks an Exposed enemy. (please keep in mind he can still only attack one enemy and exposed goes away after his turn is made! this just gives him options). - Thanks person i can't remember for the idea.

-------------------------------------------------------
**Obi-Wan Kenobi (Old Ben)**

His description is wrong in-game so that has been fixed. In addition, we think Obi-Wan has become the new Poe in competitive matches, meaning the one who went first won it for his team. This is due to Jedi Mind Trick and it's impact on matches combined with a Qui-gon Jinn. We want to slightly reduce the impact of this ability but to compensate, give it more up time so that opponents may want to risk focusing Ben Kenobi and his unique passive to go off.
* Fixed in-game description Stun-focused controller with a self revive and high Defense. Jedi with high defense and survival who excels in debuffing the enemy.

* Potency down 50% --&gt; 40%

-------------------------------------------------------

**Plo Koon**
Our idea for Plo Koon was to originally counter stealth comps and help clones. Right now, this isn't very useful. For the time being we want to give Plo Koon some additional power regarding his theme and story. Thus improving his lightsaber skills and tactical foresight.


**Quelling Blow** – Deal Physical damage to target enemy and dispel a random positive status effect on them. If an effect is dispelled, Plo Koon gains Defense up for 3 turns NEW Dispel a random debuff on Plo Koon. If an effect is dispelled, Plo Koon gains Offense up for 3 turns.


**Force Judgment** – Deal Special damage to all enemies with a 55% chance to inflict Offense Down for 2 Turns. NEW This attack permanently deals 25% more damage for each Ally defeat. This bonus is doubled if an ally Clone falls


**Overwatch** – The enemy cannot Stealth and Clone Allied attacks cannot miss, and ignore Taunt. Each ally has a 50% chance to remove Stealth from each enemy at the start of their turn. If they dispel any enemies, they gain Offense Up for 1 Turn.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**His basic** inflict defense down on droids. They have low defense to begin with, not to mention the stat right now is not useful. You won't see a damage increase late game of more than a couple hundred.

**His Special** while being a variant of Lumi's special, does about half the damage. The ability block seems kind of silly since you for the most part are relying on the 75% stun chance. Regardless, probably the only ability making him ""okay"".

**His Unique Passive** gives him bonus crit against droids. This is always welcome right? Well the problem is he has low offensive stats to begin with so this doesn't really synergize well. Even when against droids, you'll never ever be in a situation where you say to yourself ""wow Eeth's passive won me that fight, or got that droid down. Couldn't have done it without him!""

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Leader** now here's my big problem. This leader ability is so overused. +defense to allies? 

Let's name them off

* Chewy

* Fives

* Ima-gun-di

* Savage Opress

* Old Daka

* Kit Fisto

* URoRRuR'R'R

* Finn

* Han

So you're telling me a fifth of the leader abilities they came up with are Defense Up? Seriously?

-----------------------------------------------

Now let's say he had the leader ability Grievous got, EVEN IF IT WAS EXCLUSIVE TO DROIDS.

All enemies have -17.5% Critical Chance and -20% Critical Damage.

Wouldn't that fit? Droids rely and work off of high damage and crit. This would be a perfect leader ability for him!

I think the only thing missing from Jedi in the game right now kit-wise is deflecting blaster fire.

Now, Mace gets *bonus turn meter* WHENEVER HE ATTACKS.

It does NOT have to be an exposed target. 

Now you may ask to yourself, why is this sad? that's awesome!

Well as it stands, it's cause he still sucks.

------------------------------

I think they should make Shatterpoint apply to all enemies (He can still only attack one obviously, as exposed is ONLY for his turn), it's still at a low, 45% chance, still can get resisted by tenacity, and he can STILL miss the attack on top of all of that.

**TL;DR** What if we could bring multiple copies of no-named characters like the Magnaguard/IG-100. Normally they would barely be viable for a spot in a squad, but if they had special synergies say, perma taunt when on a team with General Grievous, they could be useful. 
----------------------------------------

We are speculating that General Grievous is being released in the shard shop which got me thinking.

We have this reworked Magnaguard coming out who.. might be good? Probably not in my mind.

Regardless, what if you could have two, three, or FOUR Magnaguards on your squad? I don't think no-named characters are overpowered.

 There are a few in the game that are worthy of taking a ""main"" characters spot, like JC, FOTP, etc. 

But for the most part, you look at the top people in arena and know that named characters, just aren't as good!

Maybe the idea of having multiple of the same character wouldn't be helpful at all. But what if additionally they had even MORE synergy.

EX:  Grievous has stealth/cannot be attacked/ Magnaguards have taunt as long as Grievous is alive. 

This MIGHT work in a squad, depending on how good Grievous is, and if it would be worth keeping him alive.

In most every other situation, Magnaguard on your squad wouldn't be worth it, let alone 2. 

But in this situation it could create some really interesting teams and lineups, as well as increase diversity, synergy, and strategy.

Thoughts?

Forizen here again.

Whether you are a fan or hater of my Mace Windu, General Grievous, Jango Fett, or Fake Patch Notes posts, I'm back again writing a concept for a highly wanted character, Obi-wan Kenobi.

--------------------------------------------------

**EXTREME TL;DR** Defensive tank Jedi with Clone AND Jedi synergies allowing them to benefit each other for clone/jedi squads. He sacrifices a lot of offensive power for HUGE defensive power with his Form III Soresu form, can REFLECT damage, and fight off SITH. 

Please note that this is for General Kenobi. At this time, he had already been dubbed a Jedi Master and was one of the many Jedi Generals of the Clone Wars.

This is not Old Ben, this is not Padawan Kenobi, this is not Jedi Knight Kenobi.

--------------------------------------------------

Some notes:

* Master was Yoda (as a youngling) then taken in to be Qui-gon Jinn's Padawan.

* Padawans commonly follow their Masters, in their teachings of the force, diplomacy, and lightsaber combat. 

* Obi-wan ORIGINALLY followed Qui-gon and studied the [Ataru Lightsaber form](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Form_IV/Legends) from his master. Form IV. This is the same form that Yoda uses and revolves around aerial combat, spins, flips, and rolls.

* After Darth Maul defeated his master, he decided to switch to [Form III, Soresu](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Form_III/Legends), the most defensive of Lightsaber forms.

* Obi-wan faced off against many dark siders and their masters, including Asajj Ventress, Darth Maul, Savage Opress, General Grievous and Count Dooku. The only known Sith at the time / learned from a Sith in lightsaber combat that he never faced was Darth Sidious.  

* Nicknamed ""The Negotiator"" during the clone wars for both his diplomatic prowess, as well as for his lethal abilities with a lightsaber. 

*  Hopefully armor and defense is reworked in a nice way. I was thinking 300 armor = 30% damage reduction etc. with a cap and diminishing returns. But just pretend for now Defense Up is as useful as Offense Up in reverse.

**Explanation on Obi-wan and Abilities** 


Obi-wan is a highly defensive tank who is really hard to take down, really good at dueling, but does low damage. 

**His Basic ability** is what makes him stupidly hard to take down, granting him 40% of his max health and Defense Up. It also gives him evasion when he is low on hp. Thematically, this contributes to his defensive fighting style where he would rather survive a fight and tire the opponent down rather than be the aggressor. 

**His Special** is where his damage comes from, although it deals reduced damage the multiple hits equate to about an attack and a half (see stats below). The biggy is the rank 7 finisher, which is weaker than Savage Opress (25%) with only defeating enemies below 15% health, but it's still useful. Thematically, this is where people know Obi-wan to be *""As wise as Master Yoda, but as powerful as Master Windu"" - Anakin Skywalker* It is an adaptation of an Ataru he learned from Qui-gon Jinn, and is the famous jump attack he used against Darth maul, and what Anakin tried to use against him.

**His Leader ability** is what bridges the gap between synergy for Jedi AND Clones, allowing highly diverse squads that are a mix of Clones and Jedi. The bonuses revolve around your team's basic attacks, reducing their special ability cooldowns, and also in increasing a gap of turn meter between you and your opponents. Thematically, his nickname was the Negotiator in the Clone Wars. He led many Jedi and Clones alike during the war. 

**His first unique passive** is his defensive lightsaber form. It PREVENTS Obi-wan from landing critical hits, and also reduces his counter attack damage. In return however, if Obi-wan has buffs, he takes even more reduced damage, can counter attack (with reduced damage), apply Offense down to attackers, and can also reflect some of the damage he takes back to the enemy. This damage reflection is calculated BEFORE Obi-wan's personal reductions. Thematically this is deflecting a blow or reflecting blaster bolts.

**His second unique passive** is what makes Obi-wan the first counter to Sith. He is equipped with tenacity to counter their nasty debuffs, crit damage resistance to help mitigate their high damage, as well as increased damage against them that cannot miss. Though the numbers are minuscule, every bit counts. 

-------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------

**Base Stats:**

In comparison to http://www.swgohcantina.com/character-max-stats/


At 7*

* Strength +7

* Agility +7

* Intelligence +5

* Health: 16,450

* Speed: 118

* Armor: 340

* Physical Damage: 2000

* Physical Critical Ratin: 0

* Special Damage: 2000

* Special Critical Rating: 0

* Armor Penetration: 0

* Resistance Penetration: 0

* Potency: 105%

* Resistance: 200

* Tenacity: 48%

* Health Steal: 10%

-----------------------------------------------------

So as you can see his base stats are similar to his older self. The biggest difference is due to his powerful kit, he has reduced damage and can't critically hit. Keep in mind that that health pool has a 40% gain when he has his Health Up passive on effectively giving him 23100 health. The third highest in the game behind Bariss and Chewbacca (considering Bariss has her leader). He is also pretty slow, but hopefully makes up for it with turn meter gain on counter attacks/basic attacks. Lastly, his health steal is minimal, but it's mainly there as average sustain for any fight. 

**Conclusion** 

Hopefully his kit isn't overloaded. I think Obi-wan is one of if not the most popular and most important characters in the Star Wars series. He is a Jedi, true to the code who wishes to protect the innocent and sentient life. With his Soresu form, he is an extremely defensive based fighter who is one of the best lightsaber duelists in the galaxy. His kit in the game grants him massive tank stats by sacrificing high damage output. He supports his team as a leader with creating turn meter gaps between himself and the enemy, as well as improves utility by reducing the cooldown on his ally's specials if they use basic attacks similar to Jedi Consular's basic. Obi-wan is also equipped with weaker counter attacks that can apply offense down, as well as the ability to reflect damage. This powerful character is topped off with anti-sith capabilities since he was after all the first Jedi to take down and face a Sith lord in over a millennium, taking on all 5 of the lightsaber baddies of the time except Darth Sidious himself.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Characters**

-------------------------------------------------------------

**Admiral Ackbar**

* Fixed multiple bugs

* Tactical Genius now grants Advantage instead of Defense 

------------------------------------------------------------

**Ahsoka Tano**

Ahsoka is currently a high crit/damage Jedi who can heal her team based on the damage dealt. Her main problem is her low health pool and very low speed. We decided to move a part of her leader ability, to her passive. This makes it so although she is innately slow, evading attacks will speed her up.

* Quick Steps – Jedi and Nightsister allies gain 14% Evasion. ~~Ahsoka Tano gains 25% Turn Meter whenever she Evades an attack.~~

* Daring Padawan – Ahsoka Tano gains 9% Max health for each living ally. In addition, she gains Evasion Up for 3 turns whenever an enemy is defeated. **Ahsoka gains 25% Turn Meter whenever she Evades an attack.**

------------------------------------------------------------

**Boba Fett**

Boba is currently underwhelming in the damage department. He is squishy, but tanks by having a chance to revive. His ability block utility is great but he is still someone who can be ignored and left for last. We also want to make use of his flamethrower. We've added a new ability to gear up for that will make Boba deal aoe damage to enemies when his allies fall, that will make people think twice about saving him for last. On top of this it synergies with his leader ability. 

* **NEW Unique Ability - Flame Spitter:**  Whenever an ally falls in battle, Boba Fett will deal *minor* special damage to all enemies, applying a Damage over time for 2 turns. This damage overtime can critically hit. 

--------------------------------------------------------------

**Cad Bane**

Cad Bane currently fills a high damage role with a supporting stun. He is squishy though and often finds himself dying before making a move. While we would like to make it so he gains speed and survivability through his Leader ability, we want to make it optional

* Max health increased from 9303 - 11808

--------------------------------------------------------- 

**CT-7567 Rex**

While we're very happy with adding a Clone Support to the game, we found it unusual too that Rex has the lowest armor in the game despite his wardrobe. Instead of waiting for the Defense changes to pan out, we decided to give him some love in the mean time

* Armor increased from 116 --&gt; 200 (Sorry Qui-gon)

--------------------------------------------------------

**Darth Maul**

We are overall happy with the snowballing potential Darth Maul has. But similar to Ahsoka, we don't want to abysmally slow Darth maul to rely on a leader ability to be fast in the game. We decided to raise his speed, but also grant an even faster Maul if using him as a leader. 

* Speed up from 93 -- &gt; 113

* Dancing Shadows –  + 15% turn meter on evade --&gt; double for Darth Maul. 

---------------------------------------------------------

**Darth Vader**

Although Darth is hard to farm until 7, feedback and scaling suggests even then he won't be that strong. We've decided to add a thematic move to the Sith Lord that will help promote his power against Jedi.

* **NEW Unique Ability - Force Choke:**  Whenever an enemy uses a non-damaging ability, there is a 25-45% chance that the target will suffer minor special damage and be stunned instead. This chance is doubled against Jedi. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Eeth Koth**

Meant to be our anti-droid Jedi, Eeth suffers across the board from simply not being impactful regardless of facing droids or not. Since droids are very much crit based, we decided to change him into an anti-crit jedi when chosen to be the leader.

Stalwart Jedi Defender – ~~Jedi allies gain 55 Defense.~~ All allies take 20 - 40% reduced damage from Critical hits. Jedi allies who suffer a critical hit have a 20 - 40% chance of reflecting the reduced damage they take from critical hits, back to the attacker. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

**Geonosian Soldier**

We are happy that glass cannons can exist in the game. But when the glass cannon is really a rock cannon that can fly really fast, it really begs the question, what can't Geo do other than utility? 

* Health reduced from 12323 --&gt; 10323

* Armor reduced from 188 --&gt; 138

--------------------------------------------------------------------

**Grandmaster Yoda**

Yoda came out to be a great success as a utility master without the typical crowd control being mandatory. We are mostly happy with what he has to offer, but wanted to add a little more ""umph"" to his attack.

* Masterstroke - Deal Special damage to all enemies. In addition, for each positive status effect an enemy has, this attacks deals 5-15% more damage and Yoda gains that effect for 3 turns. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------

**Greedo**

Greedo hits hard for sure, but the 2 turn delay seemed to make people avoid using Thermal Detonator altogether. The gamble of gaining turn meter was too great, so we want to try and give you a ""free"" attack when the bomb goes off

* Thermal Detonator – Place Thermal Detonators on all enemies that explode after 2 Turns. Greedo gains 20% turn meter for each explosion. ~~25% chance for Greedo to gain 25% Turn Meter.~~

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Jedi Knight Anakin**

Anakin is under debate for the main character of the Star Wars series. Making appearances in every film. We wanted to make Anakin an offensive based Jedi who thrived with anger as his allies fell. Since three of his four abilities already improve his offensive capabilities, we feel the need to help his crowd control and debuff prowess instead. In addition to this, we wanted to give Smite, the Savage Opress treatment to help snowball his damage. 

* Deft Bladework - Deal Physical damage to target enemy with a 40% chance to inflict Healing and Buff Immunity for 2 turns. ** NEW This chance is increased by 10% for every 10% health the enemy is missing after damage is dealt.** 

* Smite - If the target has 20% Health or below, this attack deals massive damage and can't be Evaded (instakill)

---------------------------------

**Jedi Knight Guardian**

Her utility chances are low, and although she can take a good amount of damage, the Jedi Knight Guardian lacks any REASON to take damage. Like many tanks, she is left for last. We think it's appropriate that as a guardian, she should protect her allies

* Defend the Order - While below 50% Health, Jedi Knight Guardian has +20% Tenacity and recovers 15% of her Max Health at the start of each of her turns. **NEW - When a Jedi Ally falls below 50% Health, Jedi Knight Guardian has a 35-50% chance to gain Taunt for 2 turns)

----------------------------------------------------------

**Mace Windu**

We are overall happy with the Mace Windu changes. We found two problems that we want to address but think Mace Windu will finally be in a spot he deserves. Smite was a decent ability that was simply outclassed by better version of it, while Exposed suffered from too much ""chance for it to happen"".

Smite - Renamed ""Tempered Aggresion"" -  Deal Special damage to target enemy and remove all positive status effects. This attack has 50% increased Critical Damage. (200% damage when it crits instead of 150%).

Shatterpoint - At the start of each of his turns, Mace has a **~~40-60~~ --&gt; 60-80%** chance to Expose a random enemy until the end of his turn. In addition, Mace gains 25% Turn Meter **and cannot miss** whenever he attacks an Exposed enemy.

---------------------------------------------------------

**Obi-Wan Kenobi (Old Ben)**

His description is wrong in-game so that has been fixed. In addition, we think Obi-Wan has become the new Poe in competitive matches, meaning the one who went first won it for his team. This is due to Jedi Mind Trick and it's impact on matches combined with a Qui-gon Jinn. We want to slightly reduce the impact of this ability but to compensate, give it more up time so that opponents may want to risk focusing Ben Kenobi and his unique passive to go off. 

* Fixed in-game description ~~Stun-focused controller with a self revive and high Defense.~~ Jedi with high defense and survival who excels in debuffing the enemy. 

* Mind Tricks – Inflict Ability Block on all enemies for 1 turn and Offense Down for ~~2~~ --&gt; 1 turn~~s~~, with a 65% chance to remove 60% Turn Meter.  Cooldown 5 turns --&gt; 4 turns

* Potency down 50% --&gt; 30%

--------------------------------------------------------------

**Plo Koon**

Our idea for Plo Koon was to originally counter stealth comps and help clones. Right now, this isn't very useful. For the time being we want to give Plo Koon some additional power regarding his theme and story. Thus improving his lightsaber skills and tactical foresight.

* Quelling Blow – Deal Physical damage to target enemy and dispel a random positive status effect on them. If an effect is dispelled, Plo Koon gains Defense up for 3 turns **NEW Dispel a random debuff on Plo Koon. If an effect is dispelled, Plo Koon gains Offense up for 3 turns.**

* Force Judgment – Deal Special damage to all enemies with a 55% chance to inflict Offense Down for 2 Turns. **NEW This attack permanently deals 25% more damage for each Ally defeat. This bonus is doubled if an ally Clone falls**

* Overwatch – The enemy cannot Stealth and Clone Allied attacks cannot miss, and ignore Taunt. ~~Each ally has a 50% chance to remove Stealth from each enemy at the start of their turn. If they dispel any enemies, they gain Offense Up for 1 Turn.~~

The reason armor is an important addition that is needed however is so that raw hp isn't the only way to go. It not only brings a lack of diversity and calculation, but balancing abilities around % based health when they are ""naked"" eliminates variation.

What I mean here is, Talia's basic for example, will always heal her for the same against any target with no armor but at any health.

But if armor had a clear role, it would reduce this damage but would vary for every character she faces.

----------------------------------------------

As it goes now, the armor stat reduces damage taken by the number shown in armor. Since everyone late game hits for thousands of damage, the highest armor rating of 371 isn't that good since it will only reduce the damage, by 371.

My idea is to change armor to % based, simply also by a multiplier of .10.

------------------------------------------------
What if it was just % based by a multiplier of .10.

300 armor = 30% physical damage reduction.

100 armor = 10% physical damage reduction. 

371 armor = 37% physical damage reduction = Old Ben

293 armor = 29% physical damage reduction = Fives

116 armor = 12% damage reduction = Rex.

--------------------------------------------

This would mean that any **flat additions** of armor, from Chewbacca for example, would increase damage reduction by a still flat amount. 50 Defense from him would always raise damage reduction by 5% without diminishing returns. 

However, with buffs like **Defense Up**, they would be more beneficial on high-armored targets over low-armored since it's percentage based (50%). A 100 armor target having 10% damage reduction would now have 150 armor with 15% damage reduction. A 50 armor character however, having 5% damage reduction would only see a gain in 2.5% damage reduction.

**Advantage** would of course ignore this stat making it more effective at taking down heavily armored targets but less useful against low armored targets. 

-Against a Ben Kenobi, who normally has 37% damage reduction, you would see a raise in damage by 37% against him since you are ignoring the armor. Hitting the average target for example, would deal 1,000 damage. With Ben's armor that damage would be reduced to about 630 damage. With advantage it would be 1000 damage again seeing a gain of 370 damage.

-Against a Rex, who normally has 12% damage reduction (rounded up btw), you would see a raise in damage by only 12% against him since you are ignoring the armor. Hitting the average target for example would deal 1,000 damage. With Rex's armor that damage would be reduced to about 880 damage. With advantage it would be 1000 damage again seeing a gain of 120 damage. 

--------------------------------------------

This change would obviously not see MASSIVE meta shifts, but would definitely make one-shotting in the meta harder to do. Battles would last slightly longer with tanks seeing more viability against attackers hopefully more leveling the playing field. 

Advantage would actually be dangerously useful against tanks, right now it doesn't help much.

Defense up would be a great buff for your team, you would see great benefit in it and it can situationally become as powerful as Offense Up. 

--------------------------------------------

Now this is a pretty simple method of adding armor in the game by making current numbers a % multiplier of .10 and making it based off of percentage damage reduction rather than flat so that this will scale infinitely like damage does.

Now I do not foresee anything dangerous about this change except a meta shift from 1 support and 4 attackers, to maybe 1 support, 2 attackers, 2 tanks, or something like that.

Another Mace Windu post, in case you remember my post on him last week:  https://www.reddit.com/r/SWGalaxyOfHeroes/comments/43xfw7/mace_windu_needs_a_rework_both_kit_wise_but_more/

So as a community we semi succeeded. 

We managed to practically convince the developers to rework a character altogether by delivering solid evidence as to why Mace Windu's old kit should be revamped. As a game so young, I think this is a major step in the right direction for characters that do not meet viability or theme whether in the meta or not.

I want to take a short moment to praise you all as I think player feedback is being taken intelligently.

The Developers go into putting things in a game, not really blindly, but without mind reading. It is our job as players who want to see the game succeed, to give constructive feedback so that they may implement good changes.

------------------------------

FYI = For your information.

FYI, RNG means Random number generator. What this is is, in gaming and math terms, whenever there is a % chance of something occuring, the computer will calculate a random number depending on the statistic. Say there is a 30% chance for something to occur, it would most likely roll a number between 1 and 100. If that number is between 1 and 30, the effect will occur. If the number is between 31 and 100, it will fail. This is just a very basic example.

-The Basic Attack


-The New Passive


-Anakin/Mace Windu overlap


-Smite


-Vaapad


-TL;DR

-TL;DR of the TL;DR - Mid tier, not top tier not for pvp. top 5 jedi for FTP not including yoda and hard to farms like imagundi. Better choices for pay to play.  Too rng based passive (chance to happen, chance to target right person, chance to be resisted, chance to dodge). Smite sucks compared to QGJ. Mace Windu is SLOW. Damage is nothing Special. Leader is awesome if you don't have speed.

----------------------------------------------------

**The Basic Attack**

Now to start off, Mace Windu is definitely in a better place. His first ability was very odd, requiring ramp up for a damage boost. Defense Up contradicted his lightsaber style of Vaapad. 

**Old Basic:**

Defense Up and Armor is already flawed in the game as it is not % base. Mace Windu, maxed out, has an armor rating of 163. With a defense up this becomes 245. 

What this means is he would take 245 damage less from attacks. Yep, pretty stupid I know. Only 245. That means that normal 4000 damage luminara blast is USED to be reduced to 3837 damage (lol) and then with Defense Up it became 3765 damage. (lol)

I know, not a big difference at all, absolutely miniscule. It went from 4% damage reduction, to 6%.

**New Basic:**

The change made it so that his Basic Attack deals bonus damage when above 50% hp, and heals him when below 50% hp. 

This was overall, a better change. Although the bonus damage was reduced from 75% to 50%, the requirement from needing defense up, changed to simply being healthy made it so that this bonus damage is much more reliable. The heal when low on health I believe is the real buff here. People overlook it, but HALF the damage you deal, you heal for. In a 1 for 1 trade this makes Mace Windu 50% more effective and this change VASTLY outweighs any defense buff he could have gotten.

**Conclusion:**

A much needed change that satisfies requirements for just about any basic ability. It contributes to the designer's goals of having him be a tank without taunt, tanking damage by remaining a threat. If not bursted down, he will sustain and damage you dealt to him back up. This was a good change.

------------------------------------------------

**The New Passive**

So the old Mace Windu had an ability that granted massive turn meter to his allies while brought down to low health or eventually falling in battle. While this was powerful on paper, it was easy for an AI or real person to simply ignore Mace Windu as he posed no threat on the battlefield. Thus, this passive was never used and probably very rarely (if ever) determined the outcome in any battle. 

**Old Passive** 

Heroic Sacrifice – Each ally gains 40% Turn Meter the first time Mace Windu is reduced to 50% Health, 75% Turn Meter the first time MaIce Windu is defeated. 

Not horrible, but way too unreliable. In total, he'd grant his team 1 full turn which is very powerful. The problem is, it never happened/would happen

**New Passive**

At the start of each of his turns, Mace has a 50%(?) chance to expose a random enemy until the end of his turn. In addition Mace gains 25% Turn meter whenever he attacks an exposed enemy.

Now this is the meat of the rework. They replaced a passive that was actually useless due to it triggering a total of.. oh maybe 3 times in history for the entire playerbase combined (sarcasm). Regardless, this is the passive that everyone was debating on whether it was good or not. My immediate answer is, it's definitely better, but it still sucks.
od
Here's why. 

Shatterpoint is i believe, THE MOST RNG BASED ability in the game. It is revolved around luck and is flawed in design. It's early in the battle capabilities contradict it's strengths in a last man standing battle.

-RNG factor #1:  You have a ?% chance of applying exposed. It's not 100%, Mace is 19th slowest character in the game. What this means is you will not be triggering this often. Coin flip for turn one

-RNG factor #2:  You have a 1 in 5 chance (diminishing as opponents fall) that the exposed buff will actually land on a character you want it to. It's completely random. If you bypass the 50% chance roll, you have to gamble with a 20% that it will even be useful.

-RNG factor #3:  There is a chance that even if the Exposed debuff is being applied, it can be resisted by Tenacity. Yep, it counts as applying a debuff. You will often find in battle, when Mace takes a turn, that a random enemy might show ""resisted"". That means the exposed debuff was GOING to be applied, but ultimately was a failure. This varies with Tenacity and Potency. The average Tenacity you will face is 35.34%. This is a mean of all character's tenacity levels (NOT INCLUDING ABILITIES). So Tenacity Up, Poe Dameron, Aayla, Ackbar, JKG, Kit Fisto, Lobot and Luke increase this variation. The median is 37% tenacity. For comparison, the highest Potency character is Count Dooku with 220% potency. Where Darth Sidious and Luminara strangely enough have it at 0%. Mace Windu is at 47%.

-RNG factor #4:  That you actually land your attack. Dodging in this game is very common. There are numerous ways to increase it and actually no ways to decrease it. If I'm not mistaken, even if you are stunned you can dodge an attack. Even if you happen to expose a target, it does not guarantee the blow lands. 


Other notes of Mace Windu's Shatterpoint:

-Exposed deals 20% of the target's CURRENT health. If they have 10,000 hp, procing the debuff will trigger it and deal 2,000 damage. If the target has 1,000 health, the debuff when triggered will only deal 200 damage. 

-The Exposed proc takes place BEFORE the attacks damage. This is a good thing. if it was the other way around, if your actual attack didn't kill the enemy, exposed never could!

-For Mace, only he can proc it. The debuff goes away when his turn ends

-Despite healing when below 50% hp, exposed procing does not benefit from health gain or life steal

-Offense up also doesn't work with the exposed debuff as the damage is fixed


**Conclusion:** The passive is based on luck. You will find that it will trigger 0-3 times in your average battle. Think about how many rounds Mace Windu would take (he moves last usually since he has low speed). Take those rounds, and add on the 50% chance for exposed. (i think it's 60% if you fully level the ability). Now factor in the fact that you can't choose your target. It could exposed a target who was going to die anyways, one who was going to heal all the damage anyways, or target an enemy who can be hit since their friend has a taunt up, or they have stealth up. Now on top of that factor in the Potency vs Tenacity where Tenacity averages hover around 37% of resisting the effect. Lastly, include any dodge factors. 

This makes the ability bad. It's extremely unreliable, and even with it's unreliability it is rarely a game changer. The randomness of the move is where it fails, but if supplemented is where the move can reliably succeed. 

**Recommended fixes:**

Remove some or all of the RNG factors mentioned above. 

**If the first RNG factor was removed**, thus granting Mace Windu a 100% chance of applying exposed on a RANDOM target is not actually overpowered if you think about it. Mace Windu's damage would be on par with normal characters in the game. With an extremely low Basic Damage stat, exposed would bring him to average while the Basic attack bonus would bring him to above average but nothing drastic. Think about how many rounds you have in the average match. How many times would an exposed debuff occur? 

**If the 2nd RNG factor was removed**, thus allowing the player to strategically decide who he wants to damage/take down first, it would make Mace Windu an ideal pick but not a must have. Since he usually moves last in meta lineups, it wouldn't actually be ideal to use to finish off a target due to the exposed buff being more effective against healthy targets. It would be to wittle down a new target or begin wittling a tank. Unlike Poe, the debuff would only be on one target and still have numerous RNG factors to occur. On top of that, Mace Windu has a speed stat of only 109 so the exposed debuff would happen much later in the first round. 

**If the 3rd RNG factor was removed**, thus making the attack irresistible. Similar to Darth Vader's Basic Attack,  it would be an extremely minor change. If this factor was removed I think it should go hand in hand with removing the first rng factor. This makes it more reliable, without it being blantantly overpowered. It would be on par with normal attackers focus firing a target instead of it being random. You can attempt to calculate how much damage you need in a fight without crossing your fingers really hard or hope for a game changing crit. It would make a weak attack, strong, but reliable without having any traits that would allow the mechanicto be abused or exploited. 

**If the 4th RNG factor was removed**, thus making an attack against an Exposed target, unmissable, it would bring Mace Windu to a point where he reliably hits dodgey targets. You wouldn't have to worry about Darth Sid's 35% dodge chance against Jedi, or Lumi/Dooku's evasion leader abilities. Most importantly, this would be thematic to one of Mace Windu's signature moves from the non-canon series called ""Tempered Aggresion"" where Mace Windu would sacrifice strength and speed in a attack, in order absolutely guarantee a landing blow.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
I would personally, if a developer, pick either removing the 1st and 3rd RNG factor weakness from the kit, or the 2nd and 4th.

**If the 1st and 3rd were removed**, Mace would expose a target every turn. Simple as that. The target would be random and dodge factors would still occur but you would simply be guaranteed 1 exposed target at the beginning of Mace Windu's turn. What this will ultimately accomplish is a state where Mace Windu would take his turn, and communicate to the player, do I want to attack an IDEAL target for damage, Remove a debuff with Smite, AND/OR deal MORE damage to a random target and gain some turn meter. It would be a conscious decision as to if the Mace Windu user should risk keeping a priority target alive and risk them being more healthy, or deal more damage to a separate non chosen target, granting Mace Windu turn meter for his next move to come up sooner. 


**If the 2nd and 4th were removed**, Mace Windu would have a % chance of choosing a target to expose for that turn. This increases priority and strategic focus fire in a match as the player can deliberately choose who they want to deal bonus damage to. The player would be informed at the beginning of Mace Windu's turn if an exposed debuff application is available. It would still risk being resisted, but still allows the player to choose exactly who they want to take down first. A common win method in battles today is to focus one character down at a time. If you don't, you risk the enemy team healing, but more importantly you maximize the total life span of each enemy character, thus allowing them to take more turns. This is bad, as a low health character deals as much damage or can cast abilities just like a full health character. This is also why Bariss Offee is decent because she maximizes her team's life span by helping them share the damage. But I digress. Lastly, the target WILL TAKE THE DAMAGE. You choose who you want to expose and they cannot and will not damage. You have a reliable, hard hitting move statistically every other turn (50% chance of applying exposed.) This would make the Passive Ability a reliable tank chipper/initial damage to a healthy character, but doubles as a finisher in reliability so that Sidious doesn't dodge your last attack before he decimates your team and heals himself. 

All in all I'd be happy with either of the two above changes.

----------------------------------------------

**Anakin/Mace Windu overlap**


I want to quickly write a mini rant on this. Anakin and Mace share a special ability name, called Smite. This is sad. They are unique characters with separate fighting styles and abilities. I can't believe creativity was put to a halt or an overlook was made. 

In addition to this, their leader abilities are so similar! Mace: 20% Offense 9% crit. Anakin: 24% offense. Both apply only to Jedi allies.

I have no idea why these two characters have these similarities. It's quite strange actually because no other characters in the same section have this. 

You can argue that both Ackbar and QGJ give speed to allies, but one is for rebels and one is for jedi.

These are both for Jedi. It's strange that the similarities of the Leader abilities exist, I feel like either could have been easily varied for more diversity in the game.

--------------------------------------------

**Smite** Mace Windu

So **Smite** is an interesting ability. It has the ability to remove debuffs from a single character, as well as deal special damage to that character. The ability to remove buffs is situational but can be useful in a variety of instances. The most popular is probably removing the 'Taunt' buff from an opponent's tank so that their team is open up to attacks and you don't have to wait a turn. Other benefits include taking down an Offense Up, Advantage, or anything can make that character dangerous.

As nice as it sounds on paper however, buffs usually expire as fast anyways. The benefit is small, but can be noticeable. I don't see a huge problem in the ability and feature itself, as future characters and strategies may revolve around having many buffs. Immediate thoughts include removing any Master Yoda buffs before he can apply it to his team. 

Now the ability however is flawed in some aspects. One example is against a target with 'Retribution' (Kylo Ren) you remove the buff, but you still get countered. See the buff removal must happen in a sequence AFTER a counter attack is triggered.

Similarly, you can't get extra benefit of use of the attack against a target against Foresight. You will still miss, thus removing Foresight anyways, but because the attack itself missed you aren't removing any additional buffs that character may have. 

I'd love for this to be changed but it probably wont. 

**Comparison**

So another Jedi in the game who is considered top tier right now has an ability very similar to Smite. It is however, superior in every way. This is a problem for me because I believe in most scenarios, one character takes up one slot, and therefore should be on similar grounds with other characters who take up the same amount of space. 

The only exception to this, is for synergistic reasons. For example, a Storm Trooper may not be very useful compared to 4 dozen other characters you could use to take its place, but if you were to build an Empire team with Vader as the leader granting 30% Offense to everyone, then maybe simply due to the Empire tag he suddenly becomes viable. 

Anyways, for those of you don't know, Qui-gon Jinn in the game also has an ability like Smite that removes all buffs from the target and deals special damage.

Here's the thing, you can use the move more than smite. Also, if you successfully remove a buff from the enemy you grant OFFENSE UP to your entire team for 2 turns! That's like a Poggle! Although it's more difficult to pull off, the fact of the matter is, is that Humbling Blow is superior to Smite in every way shape and form. I don't think that's healthy for the game, to have one character literally blatantly have an ability that's superior in every single way. In no situation is Smite better than Humbling Blow unless you prefer one Jedi to the other. Qui-gon also is much faster of a character which further increases the uptime of Humbling Blow.

SO why is this? Is this not flaw in design? there's no reason to pick Smite of Humbling Blow. The only argument that exists is if you want Mace Windu over Qui-gon.

Still, there are few to no other abilities in the game that step by step are a straight upgrade/downgrade to each other.

To end my point, one might argue that leveling Smite doesn't grant more up time, or the Offense Up feature, but gets more straight damage in place of it. While this remains true, comparatively, the damage difference is Mace Windu: 3844 * 1.65 = 6342 Special damage. Where as Qui-gon is 4812 * 1.25 = 6015. A difference in about 330 damage. Not only is this difference negligible, one needs to keep in mind that 330 damage difference is nothing compared to **50%** INCREASED OFFENSE for your ENTIRE  team for TWO TURNS. 

To conclude, Smite needs something that makes it special, and comparable. A solid reason for you to pick Mace over Qui-gon needs to exist, if you are looking for someone specifically to remove buffs. 10 times out of 10, you go with Qui-gon Jinn. Personally, I think Smite should double as an execute move, tribute to the decapitation of Jango Fett, the mechanic coming from the new Savage Opress, where it does more damage to low health targets. My other idea is unfortunately making it more like Anakin again, but is to remove buffs, then apply buff immunity. This would effectively lockdown and safely prevent a specific character from gaining buffs.

Recommended change:  

Smite:  Deal Special damage to target enemy and remove all positive status effects. If the target has 25% health or below, this attack deals massive damage and can't be evaded.

or

Smite:  Deal Special damage to target enemy and remove all positive status effects and a 50% chance to apply Buff Immunity.


----------------------------------------------------------

**Vaapad**

So with the release of Yoda, it seems the name of Lightsaber forms will vary from character to character in what they do. Lightsaber forms are ""stances"" of what a lightsaber user would practice and hone their skills in, each with it's own strengths and weaknesses. Ataru, Yoda's aerial based lightsaber form is the name of his Basic Attack whereas Mace's is the name of his Leader ability. Strange that the latter isn't exclusive to him but it's just a game right?

Anyways I'm overall happy with Vaapad as a leader ability. It is less high risk high reward than Darth Sid's leader ability but more reliable. Keep in mind, 20% offense ALSO means 30% crit damage, since when you crit it's 150% of the damage. With a 20% base offense boost, your attacks already do 120% damage, so 50% more of that makes it 180%. The downside is Vaapad only grants 9% crit chance whereas Sid's grants 14%. So you will crit more often with Sid, but get no damage boost whatesoever if you don't crit. For Mace, you do more damage overall, if you crit, the damage is even stronger, but the chances of critting are 5% lower than sids. 

I think they are the best comparison, the major difference is Mace Windu's being exclusive to Jedi and Sid's being for everyone. I think Sid being only for Sith would bring a big but healthy meta shift. 

Instead of changing Vaapad, I think they should change Anakin's Lead from the Front. It's far too similar with simply a flat 24% offense boost.

------------------------------------------------------------------
I won't give a history lesson, but if you are curious the TL;DR of the forms is here: 

Form I Shii-Cho is wild, raw, basic, simple, what everyone starts off with and is derived from swordfighting and transitioning into lightsabers. Form II Makashi is almost identical to our modern fencing, combining all three weapons however the epee, foil, and saber, noted as the best of the duelist forms. Form III Soresu is what Obi-wan mainly used after defeating Darth Maul, most defensive in the forms specializing in deflecting blaster fire, usually used to tire out an opponent in battle instead of actually hurting someone. Form IV is Ataru, is what both Yoda and Qui-gon use. Multiple jumps, spins, highly exhausting physically but can use the force to make  it easier, it's very ""aerial"" based. Form V is Shien, or Djem So. Modified versions of previous lightsaber forms. The former similar to Soresu was for redirecting blaster fire to the opponent, it's variations from Soresu were more combat focused rather than 100% defense, they needed something else to win the fight. Djem So was revolved around lightsaber combat, utilizing power and attacks - counter attacks for dueling or fighting multiple foes with lightsabers, though Makashi is the best dueling form, Djem So is known to beat it since it has more power which makes it hard for Makashi users to deflect. Form VI is Niman, mainly for Jedi Consulars who studied mysteries of the force or did more diplomatic missions than fighting ones. Utilizing basic attacks from the previous forms, combined with force attacks weaved into the mix. Thought to be the jack of all trades but master of none. Lastly Vaapad, the most violent, darkside, purely offensively powered of the forms combining the thrill of battle and aggression to win. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

TL;DR / Conclusion


Mace Windu is now mid-tier. For the Free to play player, he can fit nicely as your 5th priority jedi behind Luminara, Qui-gon Jinn, Bariss, and Ahsoka. For the Pay to play player, don't bother with him unless you are a collector. There are much better options in Jedi. 

Basic Attack - better than before overall, changed from unreliable move with strong damage gain if lucky, to a move that does more damage when you are healthy, and heals you instead when you are weak. Making it so you should burst Windu down or suffer high damage from his basic for the match. The goal of the designers was this. 

Smite - Okay move since it removes debuffs, low damage and low chance to crit, 10x worse than Qui-gon's Humbling Blow. 

Vaapad - Overall happy with it. Situational. i think there are tons better leader abilities available to jedi like QGJ's speed boost but if you want raw damage can't go wrong here.

Shatterpoint - RNG/Luck based. Luck that it triggers, luck that it targets who you want, luck that it applies and is not resisted, and luck that they don't dodge it. All in all, completely unreliable ability that only does OKAY when used to its fullest. Nothing special.

Conclusion:  I think Mace's Smite needs a severe buff as it is one of the weakest specials in the game. Shatterpoint needs to be less rng focused as gambling is unattractive and it's considered high risk, low reward since it's not amazingly good nor ever game changing. Mid tier, 5th slot jedi for FTP, no space for the pay to play

The latter suggestion is one Xerath I believe used to have, back when he was ""overpowered"". Right now I think Xerath isn't in the greatest spot due to all of his abilities relying on skill shooting, the higher mobility of champs/items these days, and more weakness in poke comps.

So I was talking on the discord with some peeps on how long it would take to technically 7 star the Shard Shop exclusive character.

Pardon if I'm doing the math incorrectly. 


-----------------------------------

But let's start off by saying, the character shows up in the shard shop every day (highly unlikely but let's just say for argument sake). That's 2 shards every day.

330 shards to get a 7 star character, 2 shards a day means at MINIMUM. It would take you 165 days to 7 star the shard shop character.

-------------------------------------

So the math from here is pretty easy. Since you can only get 2 shards a day, you only need 300 shard shop coins a day. That means you only need 20 dupes a day! Whether this is 15 from GW, 10 from Arena, 10 from Cantina Shipments (with a refresh), or other means, that's what it will take. 

-------------------------------------

This requires immense investment, for almost half a year just to 7 star the shard shop exclusive character.

Of course all of this is irrelevant if they are obtainable through different means, such as purchasable every day in bundles of 5, or something like that. ",SWGalaxyOfHeroes,[Math] Shard Shop Character,https://www.reddit.com/r/SWGalaxyOfHeroes/comments/450x6s/math_shard_shop_character/

How come they don't remove the animation cancelling bug on Riven, stutter stepping, Rengar, Kha'zix mid air, ravenous hydra, Yasuo etc?

I'm FINE with champs being nerfed when they are too strong or having a ""feature"" removed, but calling it a bug but not clearly stating it as a mechanic on other champs/items is messed up

It's created a double standard of false clarity, any champion at any moment with ""unique"" techniques are subject to becoming a victim at ANY time. You can spend hours practicing something and they just take it away?

At least admit mistakes, unintended and intended features, and respond to the criticism instead of using bugs as an excuse. It's pathetic and sad for such a dominant game.

----------------------------------------------------------------

**Special: Bounty Hunter Contract:** -

Cooldown: 5 Rounds

Rank 1: Does not deal damage. Applies Exposed to a target enemy that is below 50% health. Calls in a random ally to attack the target dealing 25% bonus damage. If the ally is a Scoundrel the damage bonus is doubled.

Rank 4: Bounty is collected on kill, refreshing this ability's cooldown.

Rank 5: Bonus Damage +5%

**Special: Wrist-Mounted Flamethrower:** - 

Cooldown: 3 Rounds

Rank 1: Jango Fett takes to the air with his jetpack gaining Foresight for one turn, then deals **minor** Special damage to all enemies, applying a Damage Over Time for 1 turn. 

Rank 2: Damage over time duration +1 turn

Rank 3: Damage +5%

Rank 4: 50% Chance to inflict Healing Immunity

Rank 2: +25% counter chance against Jedi

Rank 3: An attack cannot deal more than 40% of his maximum health.

Rank 5: +25% counter chance against Jedi

Rank 6: An attack cannot deal more than 30% of his maximum health. 

Rank 7: Jango Fett cannot be damaged below 1% for the first time

-----------------------------------------------------------

That's it here.

I hope the kit isn't too complicated. 



**The short version list:**

-His basic grants Extra attacks against *healthy* targets

-His first special is a high cooldown execute ability. Later ranks will refresh the ability 

-His Second Special is an area of effect with damage overtime application, similar to Sidious but less damage. Later ranks grant additional damage overtime and a chance for heal blocking.

-His passive makes it so that he cannot be one-shot and it will take 3-5 hits at the least to take him down. Later ranks also grant counter chances against Jedi.

**Lore:**

Some things to keep in mind:

-Mandalorians were a nomadic group of clan-based people consisting of members from multiple species and multiple genders, all bound by a common culture.

-Jango Fett held the title Mand'alor for a time (leader)

-He killed 6 Jedi once, with his bare hands

-He has pistols, wrist rocket, jetpack, flamethrower, etc.

-As a Bounty hunter, when hired, he would sometimes hire someone else to do the work, paying them less than what he would get paid. This is to prevent leads and loose ends from reach him.



**Conclusion**: I hope my iteration of Jange Fett isn't overtuned. The only stat that really stands out is his Speed, Armor Penetration, and Potency. He has very low health, one of the lowest in the game, but is supplemented by his passive.  His basic is made for wittling down healthy targets, setting them up for an execute which is his first Special Ability. His other Special is simply for some AoE damage and burn over time, perhaps preventing a heal if you are lucky and geared him that far. Lastly, his passive makes him very tanky. You cannot one shot him, it will take 5 or so attacks at max rank to take him down, this makes him an ideal tank. He is also threatening enough as a tank to take our priority targets so opposing players will have to decide what resources they wish to expend on him. He also 

Thematically, his first ability revolves around his signature pistols, with sharp aim he is even able to take down Jedi who usually are competent in deflecting blaster fire. His second ability relates to how he would often subtract other bounty hunters to try and prevent loose ends. His third is his wrist mounted flamethrower to wreck havok on the battlefield, while his last shows how tough he is overall, as well as his experience in slaying Jedi.

General Grievous

""High health, high armoured, multi attack based tank who is very vulnerable to Special Damage and grows weaker as lowered in health""

0 Special Attack and Special Crit Chance (Not special damage in kit)

0 Physical Critical Chance

---------------------------------------------------------------

**Basic: Cybernetic Saber Strike** - 


Rank 1: Strikes with his lightsabers dealing physical damage

Rank 2: +5% damage

Rank 3: 75% chance to strike a second time (deactivated when brought down to 25% health for the first time)

Rank 4: +5% damage

Rank 5: 50% chance to strike a third time (deactivated when brought down to 50% health for the first time)

Rank 6: + 5% damage

Rank 7: 25% chance to strike a fourth time (deactivated when brought down to 75% health for the first time)

----------------------------------------------------

Explanation:  The idea here is that although he has low attack damage, he has a chance for extra attacks up to four. When brought down in health at 25% increments he loses a limb and thus, an extra attack. 

Lore: In the series and movies, Grievous would wield up to four lightsabers. These were stolen from fallen Jedi that he defeated in battle. His cybernetic enhancements allowed him to split two of his limbs to become four-armed. In the final battle between General Grievous and Obi-wan, the jedi was able to cut off two of Grievous's limbs thus having less lightsabers to use. 

--------------------------------------------------------------

**Passive: More Machine Than Alive:** 

Rank 1: General Grievous cannot critically strike and cannot evade Special Damage. When taking Special Damage, Grievous has the Exposed debuff applied to him. 

Rank 2: At the beginning of every turn, Grievous has a 25% chance to gain one random buff for one turn:  Offense Up, Defense Up, Speed Up, Evasion Up. (Chance lowered by 10% when reaching 75%, 50%, and 25% health.)

Rank 3: Chance +5%

Rank 4: Chance +5%

Rank 5: Chance +10%

Rank 6: Increased duration of buff +1

Rank 7: Chance +10%

----------------------------------------------------
Explanation: Vulnerable to special damage true to theme (see lore below). Grants chance to gain random buff at the beginning of every turn. This represents the cybernetic advantages over sentient life. 


Lore: Despite not being Force Sensitive, General Grievous proved in the Clone Wars that after being taught by Count Dooku, he could not be beaten. With a great lightsaber master, combined with droid strength, speed, and calculation he proved to be unbeatable with a lightsaber. Mace Windu however was able to Force Crush his chasis, severely wounding him.

**Special: Whirling Storm** 


Cooldown: 3 Rounds


Rank 1: Grevious gains Taunt for one turn. If Grievous is attacked, Taunt is removed and physical damage is dealt to all enemies. Receiving Special Damage will remove Taunt without provoking a counter attack.

Rank 2: Physical damage applies a Damage Over Time

Rank 3: Damage increased 5%

Rank 4: Damage increased 5%

Rank 5: Applies Foresight for one turn

Rank 6: Damage increased 10%

Rank 7: Cooldown -1 

----------------------------------------------------

Explanation: Somewhat of a gamble, Grievous spins his lightsabers trying to prompt his enemies into attacking him, if they do he'll deal area of effect damage with a damage over time. Taking Special Damage removes this.

---------------------------------------------------------------

**Passive: Multiple Limbs, Multiple Lightsabers:** 

Rank 1: General Grevious takes 20% reduced damage from additional attacks, enemy assist attacks and counter attacks. (-10% every time he reaches 75%, 50%, 25% health for the first time) 

Rank 2: +5% damage on additional attacks

Rank 3: +10% Damage reduction

Rank 4: +5% damage on additional attacks

Rank 5: +5% damage on additional attacks

Rank 6: +10% Damage reduction

Rank 7: +15% Damage reduction


---------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation: Since Grievous is able to combat multiple opponents at once with four limbs and four lightsabers, I thought it would make sense that he would take reduced damage from additional attacks of all forms. This would be the first ""resistance/counter"" against characters like Count Dooku, Phasma, QGJ, Geo Soldier, IG-86, Aayla, etc. 



Lore: Not much to say here. Throughout the Clone Wars he was able to take on multiple Jedi at the same time.


---------------------------------------------------------------

**Leader: Supreme Commander of the Droid Army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems:**


Rank 1: General Grievous and Droid Allies have a 25% chance to gain 25% turn meter whenever they are attacked. 

Rank 2: As long as an allied Droid is alive, General Grievous has Stealth.

Rank 3: +5% turn meter chance

Rank 4: +5% turn meter gain

Rank 5: +10% turn meter chance

Rank 6: +10% turn meter gain

----------------------------------------------------

Explanation: Optional Droid synergy. Since Grievous isn't a droid himself, I made sure in the description he is mentioned. Since he is a commander, I was trying to compare it to other character commanders. Dooku grants his team evasion and offense up through master tactics, while Phasma grants allies additional assisting attacks. I was thinking for Grievous, to give his allies more turn meter, essentially ""mobilizing"" them. Lastly, one might argue Grievous is not ""stealthy"" and that is fine. My idea behind Stealth was to instead divert attention to him last, without really using the Taunt ability. 


Lore: General Grievous sacrificed droids alot to get the upper hand in multiple battles as their commander. He was also known for running away in battle using the droids as distraction. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


Explanation: Visually, he will lose a limb in battle so you can keep track of how powerful/damaged he is. So obviously a ""boss"" like character who loses limbs as his health is lowered. He starts off very strong, with all four limbs and multiple attacks with buff gains through the battle. As his health is lowered in battle however, he loses a limb and some of his benefit, making him weaker. This is to compensate for his massive power starting out and is also thematic to having his limbs chopped off.

HI TRUFFLE!
----------------------------------------------------------

EA did not do him justice in this game. Just to start off, really quick, this is the lightsaber style Mace Windu uses, and has mastered. It is almost exclusive to him:

http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Form_VII


""The form focuses on offense, and has no defensive qualities. However, this is compensated by the speed of the wielder or their blade being double-sided.""
So why the heck is Mace Windu slow, a tank, and has Defense Up in this game?!?!

------------------------------------------------------------


Anyways, Mace Windu. #2 in the Jedi Order during the Clone Wars. For those of you who don't know he is pretty much the guy who is 2nd to only Yoda, and technically the only one in the Star Wars universe who beat Darth Sidious in a 1 v 1 for realz (unless it was just Palpatine's plan and he could have won easily but wanted to have Anakin to betray Windu yadee yadee ya).
Mace Windu was ready to deliver the killing blow if Anakin didn't stop him.


Mace Windu is not only powerful in the force, but he is actually renown as one of, if not the very best Lightsaber Duelist in the entire Star Wars universe. It is said that of the top 3 lightsaber dueslists of that iteration of the Jedi Order at the time, he, Count Dooku, and Yoda are the very very best.


Mace Windu is also in charge of the Jedi Council, Yoda appointed him this as he was Grandmaster himself.


Mace Windu was also designated the head of the Jedi Assault Team during the clone wars.


EA did not do him justice in this game.
First of all, Mace Windu in the game is currently in the 'Tank' Role. While I'm sure he is tough as a nail and can hold his own, he is not known as a defensive fighter at all. All of his unique capabilities and mastered fighting style revolve around risky, and highly aggressive and offensive sword play. Defense ups have nothing to do with this.


The reason being he is technically the only Jedi to have mastered a new iteration 7th form of lightsaber combat renamed Vaapad. This is a lightsaber style that was initially banned from teachings in the Jedi Order due to the dangers of it bringing Jedi closer to the dark side. They had to ""enjoy"" the fight and stir and channel emotions on the inside, without showing them on the out. They say that the style was like dancing on the edge of the dark side, as well as being able to use an opponent's dark side against them.


The Vaapad style was named after and based on a species with many tentacles due to the nature of the attacks to be lightning fast, offensive, too many to count, and unpredictable. The downside is, the character was as much at risk to injure himself, then he was to the opponent. You could not count a Vaapad's legs unless they were standing completely still.
""Six there were for generations of Jedi. The seventh, is not well-known. Powerful form it is. Deadliest of all. But dangerous it is, for its master as well as its opponent. Few have studied. One student alone, to mastery has risen.""
―Yoda

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think Mace Windu in the game was not served proper justice.

His first ability, grants Defense Up. It also grants a damage buff if he has Defense Up. While this isn't a TERRIBLE basic ability, it's nothing special, and most of all not thematic. Though Invincible Assault sounds very likely a name of one of his signature attacks, it isn't an invincible assault because he is tanky and can't be shot down, it's because he had such strong, fast, accurate blows that the opponent in fact did not get a chance to attack as they were busy trying to survive. This is why he was deemed invincible.

His second ability, is nice, but why is his a straight up worse version of Qui-gon-jinn's?
SURELY he should have different variation.

QGJ's gives all allies TWO TURNS of Offense up if it removes a buff. That's a Poggle 2nd ability built in!
While Mace has a base version without the bonus? tsk tsk. You literally made another character have an ability exactly the same, but with a huge bonus added.

You can also argue that Mace's has more damage bonuses to make up for it, but a 5% damage bonus, or heck a 40% damage bonus on a SINGLE COOLDOWN MOVE doesn't make up for ALL ALLIES GAINING 50% OFFENSE.

See the problem?

------------------------------------------------------------------------
His third ability is explained a little down further on, so i skipped to his passive here for a moment


There is no Heroic Sacrifice that he made in his stories, none that even inspired since when he died he was betrayed, the last man standing, and the only jedi with him turned to the dark side 10 seconds later. Heroic Sacrifice doesn't make sense as an ability thematically at all.


His third ability, shouldn't be a leader ability. Vaapad is his almost personal lightsaber combat style and should not be a leader skill. It is personal. He should not be a tank he should be an attacker as shown in every piece of canon and non-canon text of him.


""Vaapad was explained as being a state of mind rather than just a fighting style, allowing the wielder to channel his own inner darkness into the duel, and accept the fury of the opponent.""
""It should be noted that while the sequences and maneuvers of Form VII could be practiced and drilled, a duelist would not be truly executing the style unless they allowed the excitement and passion of battle to color their actions""


Though this seems contradictory to the Jedi Code, the reason why Mace Windu was able to use the form was because he WAS Jedi and followed the code mostly likely so perfectly, that the dangers and hindrances of the dangerous 7th form could never overtake him. He was so aligned with the light side of the force, he was able to harness a darker side of it without falling prey to actually turning. He is the only Jedi to have used this form and not turn.


I think the ideas behind some of his moves can be moved to other characters like a Jedi Guardian character who guarded the temple, but I feel like the designers just threw random **** into his kit and sold him for 40 bucks. I of course don't pay to play the game, but overlook his shards as much as I do Ewok Scout. (apologies to you Ewok lovers).


Now people will argue he has bonus damage on his basic ability and his hero trait is what gives him his offense, but he's still labeled as a tank due to that defense up and his base stats.
I'm afraid his Leader ability is much too similar to Anakin's:


Level 6 - Lead from the Front - Jedi allies gain 24% Offense.

and Windu's

Level 7 - Vapaad – Jedi Allies gain 20% Offense and 9% Critical Chance.

It should instead recognize him, as a leader, of either the Jedi Council, or the Jedi Assault Team as he held the leading role for both of these groups, the most powerful of the Jedi groups, alone holding the title.

----------------------------------------------------


**ABILITIES**


To end my post off, I have a kit idea that I think is balanced, powerful, and great to fulfill Mace Windu both thematically, and into the meta.


**Tempered Aggression** - (Basic) Deal physical damage to a target enemy. This attack cannot miss and Mace Windu has a 35% chance of gaining advantage.


**Unstoppable Force** - (3 round cooldown) Strikes twice, each attack deals reduced damage. The first hit deals Physical Damage with a 45% chance of applying Exposed, the second hit deals Special Damage with a 45% chance of applying Ability Block.


**Leader - Jedi Council Leader** - At the beginning of every turn, a random Jedi Ally has a 45% chance of gaining Foresight. Whenever a Jedi is attacked, there is a 25% chance that the highest health Jedi Ally gains Taunt for 1 turn.


**Passive - Vaapad** Mace Windu has 15% increased Offense and 50% Potency. This chance is doubled when attacking a Sith.


**Base Stats**

*Health - 14554
*Speed - 122
*Physical Damage - 3440
*Special Damage - 3844
*Physical Crit - 500
*Special Crit - 25
*Armor - 180
*Armor Penetration - 12
*Resist - 150
*Resist Penetration - 20

-----------------------------------------------

His Basic and Special are both named after actual writings and novelizations of both Mace Windu and his dangerous 7th form. The leader ability is named to recognize him as the leader of the Jedi other than Grandmaster Yoda who led the Jedi Order. Windu leading the Council, and the Assault Team during the Clone Wars. 

**Tempered Aggression** is actually a move that specifically stated it sacrificed power and even speed, to simply absolutely guarantee a landing blow on the enemy. Variations of the strike are known to be used in most combinations of form 7 to wittle down and eventually destroy an opponent's defenses with raw aggression. Hence the advantage chance.

**Unstoppable Force** was also named Swift Strike at one point. Though they sound different, it was a power based variation of an Ataru move (form IV, aerial/jumping attacks, Yoda and Qui-gon Jinn). Thus I thought it would be a good idea to make it two strikes.

**The Jedi Council** stood as a room of the most wise jedi who would often meditate and discuss issues and decisions of the Jedi order. They would rally to plan next moves or even foresee the future. Thus, I thought Foresight was an excellent choice thematically. The taunt idea is coming from the Battle of Geonosis. Where when the Jedi Strike team was dropped into the arena, back to back in a circle defending each other. Similar to a phalanx, one was responsible for guarding the person on their left and right. Jedi were about defending sentient life.

Lastly **Vaapad** is an offensive based lightsaber form with sheer aggression. Because it channeled the user AND the opponent's darkness into a weapon to redirect it at them, I thought it was appropriate to make Mace Windu have bonuses against Dark Force users, the Sith. Being more unique however by keeping staple parts in his kit that are all around useful, Mace Windu's debuff application is doubled when striking Sith, in the form of Potency. 

**Conclusion:** Mace Windu is known and unique for his redevelopment of the Form VII lightsaber style. The original was abandoned and not taught since it brought the user closer to the dark side. It is purely an offensive style that put the user at risk both physically, and towards the darker side of the force. One had to enjoy the thrill and could turn the darkness and fury of the opponent back against themselves. A high risk, high reward style that only Mace Windu mastered per Yoda's words.


EA made Mace Windu a Tank, with a Heroic Sacrifice passive that makes 0 sense on the character thematically and should go to a Jedi who fell valiantly and as a sacrifice, not one in Windu's situation.


My idea changes him almost completely, making him a true attacker and leader, utilizing the theme of Vaapad's darkness reflection to counter Sith, and no longer a contradiction to his theme and lore.",SWGalaxyOfHeroes,"Mace Windu needs a rework both kit wise but more importantly, theme wise. - In depth long texy post",https://www.reddit.com/r/SWGalaxyOfHeroes/comments/43xfw7/mace_windu_needs_a_rework_both_kit_wise_but_more/
444,2016-02-02 08:18:52+00:00,self.leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/43tcp8/now_that_shens_been_out_for_a_week_i_wanted_to/,False,"Now to start off, the main description for Shen from the Pros recently is that Shen can't carry. He is a supportish tank who at level 6, loses all ins in lane in order to win another lane with his own ultimate. 


Something else to consider is that I think his dueling power is great early game, he out trades a lot of matchups and am happy about the new gameplay he requires to try and win a trade. 

Though you can only get 1-2 shields off early game while trading, later you can keep a shield up all all times granted you can keep your energy topped off by staying in a fight. This along with a dodge makes him really hard to take down. 

-----------------------------------

In comparison to the old Shen, who had a point click damage ability that gave sustain, and then a shield without scaling that was a simple button press, one of the simplest abilities in the game, the new Shen requires some geometry in lining up and timing to land your Q to pass through enemies, a player needs to time a dodge, but the taunt and ultimate are very much the same.

I think a problem before is that Shen would taunt into a fight, q someone and auto attack them to survive until taunt was up again. Nothing outside of that other than body blocking. 

His shields are much stronger, but can be delayed as it requires you to land your spells and be near your spirit sword. Taunt is the exception to this, but you would most likely taunt AND Q to land both, thus ""wasting"" the cooldown on stacking shields.

You would want to delay the Q a bit for a double shield, then save your dodge for an opportune moment or a third.

-----------------------------------

Right now I think Shen is a little too strong, this is because he will still win most trades by landing a taunt, but even if you miss your Q you will still out trade the opponent. You don't even need to time a dodge, simply save it for a shield when disengaging. 


Other than that, I think he's a little on the lackluster side, a lot of old problems Shen had before still exist, like remaining a threat in a fight and not being saved for last. 


Playing him top, i've found as soon as the enemy hits 6, you will pretty much auto-lose fights unless way ahead. The meta top laners and just ones with ultimate is a power spike Shen can't compete with due to the lack of an ultimate that can be used in the lonely lane at top. Darius, Garen, Jax, Fiora, Irelia, Riven, Mundo, you name it. Since teleport is almost a must on Shen, despite being a tank shredder, it's hard for him to deal with champs like Mundo or Tahm too without a grievous wounds option.


I'm going to go ahead and write below what I think would be some neat, non overpowered changes for Shen that will hopefully bring back some old love that people miss while solving some problems he may have right now whether it be him too strong or too weak. 

------------------------------------------------

**Q - Twilight Assault**

Magic Damage for each auto attack:

**Without landing Q:**


Live:  3/3.5/4.0/4.5/5.0%    
Suggested Change:  2/3/4/5/6% 


**With landing Q:**

Live:  5/5.5/6/6.5/7%
Suggested Change:  6/6.5/7/7.5/8%

-----------------------------------------------

**W - Spirit's Refuge**

Dodge Duration:

Live: 1.75 seconds

Suggested Change:

1/1.25/1.5/1.75/2.0 seconds

EDIT:  People said this hits his early game jungle! I've only been laning so I'm sorry.

Still brainstorming here, let me know if you have any ideas of increasing dodge duration but maybe moving power somewhere.

Right now this ability is lack luster because only it's cooldown is lowered per rank making it max last always and no real base power gain when skilling it.

----------------------------------------------

**E - Shadow Dash**

No change. I think the ability is good. Its hitbox is a little buggy right now but I like the mixed damage change, health scaling, and overall different distance. It LOOKS good but feels clunky, something is off but I'm sure it will be discovered and addressed soon, flash taunt has a weird hit box and seems harder to land.

----------------------------------------------

**R - Stand United**

So my idea here is to add an ultimate passive. My reason for this was, I was looking at two other tank champs in the game who are competitive and strong, Tahm Kench and Rek'sai.

Both of these champion's ultimate abilities is a method of transport to go across the map. Shen's of course is more powerful, but looking at the passive component these champions give up an actual combat ultimate, for a utility one but get a passive in return.

My idea for Shen is to also have a passive here to help him compete with all ins in the top lane post 6 or when split pushing. In my opinion, it's very very awkward for a split pusher to not have the ability to duel someone or the threat or taking someone down. Shen is meant to have iffy wave clear and tower damage, but taking away kill potential really makes splitpushing unattractive on a split pushing champ.

Lastly, I think the ultimate cooldown at later levels is too short. I'm a Shen main and love turning the tide and would never really ask for nerfs for my favorite champion just like all of you, but I care even more about having him in a healthy state. Every game I've played, people have complained how short a 2 minute global teleport shield tide turning ultimate is absolutely bullshit. I'm not as vulgar but I think it's way too short and contradicts many patches of the old Shen's tuning.

Here is my suggested change that hopefully will make old Shen players who missed sustain, come back, as well as making Shen a little bit more of a threat when splitpushing, so you can't just send ANYONE to go top and wave clear and deal with him. 


**Cooldown:**

Live:  180 / 150 / 120

SC:   180/160/140

**New** Passive:  10/12.5/15% of the damage dealt from Shen's empowered auto attacks will heal him

This will only apply to his empowered auto attacks. 

At level 7 Against a 2,000 hp target, if you **DON'T** land your Q, but auto attack the enemy champion, 3 auto attacks would heal around 55 health.. 


At level 16 against a 2,000 hp target, if you **DO** land your Q, but auto attack the enemy champion, 3 autos would heal about 120 health. 

---------------------------------------------------

I probably did the math wrong on the ultimate, but I think that's about the same healing he used to get for attacking someone with your Q.

This is akin to the old Q, where when you land it you auto attack that champion to get health back. The biggest difference here is that it doesn't give it to Shen's allies, which can be a turn off but I think his team fighting would be on par with balanced with the above changes. 

To conclude, bring on the hate or whatever, share with me your thoughts on the new Shen and what you'd like to see. 

-----------------------------------

Additional Note: Just something to consider. Support Shen doesn't do less damage than lane Shen since you don't really build AP on him to increase the power of Q. Top lane Shen would do more damage simply due to having more gold for more health for a more hard hitting taunt. 

Lane Shen (or jungle Shen) do damage due to Titanic Hydra or Trinity Force since they can afford it.

This is why Support Shen is strong because the Q damage is comparable to Lane/Jungle Shen.

Since I didn't see Warwick on the updated Champion Rework Schedule I thought I'd spend a late night snowed in writing an idea on a Warwick rework.

TL;DR At bottom

My goals:

-Make him a high sustain champion in prolonged attacks


-Make him very fast, like a true half man, half wolf (werewolf)


-Hunter aspects, thematically true to his character


-A great Jungler and counter jungler


-Maintain an impactful ultimate 


-Riot mentioned an idea of leaping in a circle, (in dragon pit then out) so i wanted to bring that kind of option back for great steals and jungle mobility. 



-------------------------------------------
Warwick will maintain most of his base stats, but something to note is he has a lower base Attack Damage but a  higher Attack Speed.

Attack Damage ~~62 - 120~~  ---&gt; 41 - 90

Attack Speed ~~0.679 + 2.88%~~ ---&gt; 0.979 + 3%

New running animation: Warwick runs on all 4s when movement speed is increased

-------------------------------------------

**Passive:**

Eternal Thirst:  Warwick heals himself for 6/8/10% of non-true non-DoT damage over 6 seconds. This stacks to a maximum of 10 stacks. 

Half Wolf:  Warwick gains 15/20/25% movement speed when moving through the jungle. 

--------------------------------------------

**Q - Hungering Strike** 


**Active:**


Range: 200

Cooldown: 10 seconds


*Warwick's swipes at the enemy, dealing 60/90/120/150/180 magic damage (+.9 AP Ratio) exposing the target enemy, slowing them by 3/6/9/12/15% for 2 seconds and causing Warwick's auto attacks to shred the enemy's armor and magic resistance by 2/4/6/8/10 up to a maximum of 10 stacks. An exposed enemy dying refreshes the cooldown of Hungering Strike.*





**W - Blood Scent/Hunter's Call** 


Range: 2000/2500/3000/3500/4000 


Cooldown: 30 Seconds


**Passive**


*Champions below 30/35/40/45/50% health within range of Warwick will leave a blood trail behind only visible to Warwick, and any champions behind him. Warwick gains Half Wolf's bonus movement speed when following a blood trail and 10/15/20/25/30% bonus attack speed against bleeding targets.*


**Active** 


*Warwick howls, sending out a vocal shockwave that  spreads out from Warwick's original location, revealing all units, visible wards, minions, monsters, and BLEEDING Champions for 6/7/8/9/10 seconds. Defeating a Large or Epic monster refreshes this cooldown. Enemies can only see the point where Warwick originally cast the howl, when the vocal shockwave reaches them.*



**E - Moon Stalk**

Cooldown: 1/0.9/0.8/0.7/0.6 second between casts

Range: 450

Knock back range: 

Maximum Charges: 1/1/2/2/3

**Passive**

Moving builds up stacks up to 100. Reaching 100 stacks will store one charge of Moon Stalk. Killing an enemy champion, or Jungle Monster also grants 1 charge.

**Active**

Warwick swiftly leaps a fixed distance, becoming untargettable for 0.25 seconds. Upon landing, Warwick inflicts a bleed in a small area around him to all enemies hit that deals (2% of current health over 2/3/4/5/6 seconds +.5% per 100 ap) magic damage over time. Damage against small monsters instead bleed for 50% of their maximum hp over 2 seconds. 


**R - Infinite Duress**


Cooldown:  90/75/60

Range:  900

Speed: 2800

**Skill shot**

**Active**

Warwick lunges forward, taking down the first champion he collides with, sinking his teeth in and suppressing them for 1.5 seconds and dealing magic damage 5 times in 0.3 seconds intervals. Each hit deals 8% of the target's current health in magic damage and applies on hit effects.

-Warwick can cast Moon Stalk during the suppression, keeping his foe in jaws and moving them (even over a wall)

-Can Q during suppression
 
-Warwick can cast Infinite Duress on Large Jungle Monsters also, refunding 60 seconds of the cooldown.  

---------------------------------------------------------

**Mechanics:** 

**Basic:** Warwick has high attack speed, high movement speed, but lower attack damage. This makes on-hit items more useful on him. 

Passive:**  Warwick heals based off of all damage dealt, over a longer period of time. Think of it as a version of Death's Dance, who heals him over time instead of immediately (much like the bleed in reverse.

Also, Warwick has increased movement speed in the jungle, to help navigate to hunt down his next prey.

**His Q** ability is a resistance shredder with magic damage on it. You can poke with it in lane especially if going ap, but is better used to open up a target to further attacks. 

**His W** A reworked blood scent. Now, you can passively always track enemies and their blood trails when they are low, without revealing yourself. If you are leading the hunt, your allies will see the trail too. The active component will now actually reveal the enemies, giving off a sound to enemies in range after a delay (when the sound hits them). This will not only reveal weakened enemies, but visible wards, and jungle monsters too to help counter jungle or defend your own. 

**His E** A modified version of Nidalee's Pounce, a MASTER Warwick can use the quarter of a second timed leaps to dodge spells. You can leap over the walls in the jungle to reach camps faster or chase down foes from unexpected jungle routes. 

**His R** Instead of a point click blink, Warwick has to lunge at his target. Enemies can body block it, but the speed of the lunge is 2800 (Caitlyn bullet ult is 3200) and without a guideline, so you can sneak it by if you are good at timing. You can use Moon Stalk to pick up your prey during the short duration to move them a big out of the way. Lastly, you can use this on large jungle monsters, explained below. 

-------------------------------------------

**Jungling:**

Warwick is primarily a jungler now. With massively increased movement speed in the jungle, and a heal over time based on damage dealt, he can move from one camp to another swiftly and sustain as if you had a potion running the whole time.


**His Q** ability deals good magic damage, but consecutive auto attacks against that target will shred their resistances to help take downt he big jungle monsters.


**His W** is used to gank and find low health enemies, but the active component can reveal jungle monsters to see if the enemy countered you, or if you want to invade a camp that your opposing jungler hasn't taken yet. 


**His E** is a leap that can close the distance with charges. The leap has a .25 second untargettable duration (One THIRD of Fizz's E). This is used to dodge spells when chasing your target down. The leap is also to jump jungle camp walls so you don't have to run around them, making his clear speed insanely fast. Lastly, you can use it when suppressing with your ultimate. 


**His R** To start off, you can ult a Large Jungle monster, reducing the ultimate's cooldown. This might sound silly, like you may not need the damage, but the neat mechanic here is that you can steal someone's buff by leaping away. You can use Moon Stalk (his leaping E) WHILE suppressing the Jungle Monster. You see the enemy jungler doing their red? ult in, snagging their jungle monster, then leap out and finish the buff off then run away. Still an ultimate ganking tool, now a super speedy skill shot tackle, stronger than before with farther range, but risks being body block. It's almost as fast as Caitlyn's ultimate fly speed. 

----------------------------------------

**In lane**

Mostly suited for top lane because of melee matchups, Warwick has great sustain when pushing a wave due to a slow over time heal for attacking things. He has bonus movement speed in river and jungle if he wants to roam or clear a camp when you already pushed your lane. Q is great for extended trades for it's resistance shred. W can help you see weak junglers straying near, and E helps you leap away too! With the E charge system, you can leap in, attack someone, then leap out. Similar to Renekton. 

--------------------------------------

**Conclusion:**  Warwick is a ways off, but I wanted to meet my stated goals and keep Warwick very similar to what people know him as. 

**What's the same:**  You heal off of attacks, more heal with consecutive attacks stacking, Q magic damage poke still exists, tracking down targets low on health exists, bonus movement speed exists, suppression in ult exists with on-hit effects. 

**What's new:**  Q shreds resistances for follow up attacks, less resistance = more damage = more healing, Warwick moves faster in the jungle, Blood Scent tracks blood trails and leads the ""pack"" for a hunt, revealing only happens with active howl, Warwick has short dashes that if timed masterly, can dodge spells, Ult is skill shot, can cast dash during ult, ult can steal buffs. 



**TL;DR**:  Made for counter jungling, Warwick moves faster in jungle, Q shreds resistance, Blood Scent leaves trail of blood and can reveal jungle monsters, E is now dash that can dodge spells (.2 second times vs fizz .75) and jump walls with charge system, ult is now very very fast skill shot (almost as fast as Cait bullet ult) that suppresses but you can also leap a bit with target in jaws. Ult can be cast on large jungle monsters:  suppress monster, jump over wall, kill monster.

First, Cassiopeia.

He's perfect and should be the number 1 on this fucking list. He's an immobile mage. Yes a tank but also a mage, if not the tanky anti-mage. He suffers from a lot of old champion designs where i think simplicity is fine but being outdated until you are op and toxic isn't.

He fires two aoe spells then runs away, then fire two aoe spells before he flash in and ults a team. You can shield yourself or allies so they are tanky.

Some great gameplay that is. I'll tell you now I don't need any brain power nor have as much fun on him that I do with oh I don't know... 130 other champions in the game.

Why isn't he on this list, why do you hate Galio.

Seriously, you neglected him and said you'd buff him for like 3 years saying he'd get an actual passive and just have the mr built into his spells.

WHERE IS THAT. THAT WAS THREE YEARS AGO.

His movement cannot be stopped and is like the popular game ""snake"" except is not limited to 90 degree turns, the first part of his body hit takes damage from projectiles. It looks like his model in-game is really big, and long (that's what she said)

-----------------------------

**Ao Shin the Storm Dragon**

An ancient deity of Ionia long lost and forgotten. A storm does not always dictate disaster, but is key in the balance of nature. 

Ao Shin is highly complex control mage who relies on strange snake-like maneuvers to evade damage, while zoning out key positions in the battlefield. He is designed to play an ability power role in the mid lane, or a bot lane support who can roam.


**Passive: Ouroboros**

Ao Shin has movement that can not be stopped and he will follow the direction of your mouse when holding the left mouse button down.. Ao Shin takes greatly reduced damage when his scales are hit by enemies, but increased damage at the head. In addition to this, Ao Shin ignores non-player made obstacles. Ao Shin can not recall, but activating the ability allows Ao Shin to gain a burst of movement speed for 4/6/8/10 seconds (Levels 1, 6, 11, 16). Ao Shin's auto attacks are sparks that will fire from a random part of his body that are converted into magic damage. 

--------------------------------

**Q - Storm Crafting**

Active: Ao Shin releases a barrage of clouds in target direction. They gain exponential speed over time and its rain leaves behind a healing area for all allies in its path. Activating the ability again will freeze the clouds in place, stopping the rain and starting hail and lightning, slowing enemies in range while dealing three bursts of damage every second for 3 seconds. 

--------------------------------

**W - Wind Waker**

Passive - Ao Shin gathers Wind Guard stacks as he moves. Upon reaching maximum stacks, Ao Shin will grant a shield to himself that will block the next enemy ability. If there are nearby allies, Ao Shin's movements will begin to build up a shield for nearby allies that will block the next enemy ability. Allies who leave the area near Ao Shin will lose the shield. If Ao Shin takes damage to his head, this shield is lost. 

Active - Ao Shin releases a gust of wind in a cone with massive power towards any direction, dealing damage and knocking back all enemies and removing all Wind Guard stacks and Shields from Ao Shin and nearby allies. The gust of wind deals more damage, has a larger cone, and a larger knock back depending on how many Wind Guards were spent. 

----------------------------------

**E - Shock and Awe**

Active Ao Shin begins to breathe lightning in a cone in front of him for 5 seconds, leaving a path of dangerous electricity in his wake on the ground for 5 seconds. Enemies hit by the breath or who run into the electrified path are feared for 1 second.

----------------------------------

**R - Hurricane summoner1** (I was told the name of the hurricane is your username. I don't know if this is true but I feel like it's unlikely and don't know why they would do that) Range is Less than Twisted Fate Ultimate, can't measure real range. 


Ao Shin channels the ultimate power of an ancient dragon for 3 seconds. Afterwards, Ao Shin will fly into the air, becoming invulnerable  Ao Shin can then click a target on the ground to land on. Upon arrival, Ao Shin begins to muster a massive Hurricane.

Ao Shin's scales have double damage reduction, and Ao Shin gains increasing movement speed over 10 seconds, Ao Shin's movement cannot be controlled during this time and Ao Shin will continue to circle clockwise creating a Hurricane. All crowd control will slow Ao Shin instead by a certain amount. 

------------------------------

This Hurricane does a number of things

-Prevents dashes
-Slows enemy movement speed going through it by 79/89/99%
-Every time Ao Shin completes a rotation, the Hurricane will deal magic damage to all enemy's in the hurricane equal to a percentage of the enemy's health
-Ao Shin can complete more rotations with higher movement speed
-Enemies have blurred vision when inside the Hurricane

These are shown in the videos below, but the major idea is that a shadowy silhouette of the champion is shown briefly ""popping"" out of champion as if they moved really fast to dodge something.

The first video is from HotS. It's from the Sylvannas Q. She can use Q without stopping her movement and it's basically a basic attack that will target the closest unit without hindering her movement.


The animation shows a shadowy version of her firing the arrow while her ACTUAL model is unchanged.

I think this would be REALLY cool and CLEAR to champions dodging basic attacks/

Another example, from Marvel Heroes 2015. This is Gambit's ultimate, I know it's a different game but just watch the speedy animation. There is an animation where gambit dodges too which would show this more appropriately I'll see if i can find it but the short video below should give you a basic idea.

I love the changes they gave him, and although they took away reliable last hitting under turret, sustain, took away the shield that was reliable against poke, and a few other things,

The pros somewhat outweigh that. With an interesting AoE blind that helps duke it out with other fighters in top lane, and much needed health scaling on his taunt and shield (before all ap ratios that wern't used).

Now the ap scaling still isn't good on Shen's Q and R, and that's all fine and dandy, don't go AP Shen.

My only problem is after his 3 autos, he will always ALWAYS get outraded. The sustained DPS isn't enough with the Q cooldown on top of the skill needed to use it compared to other champions who can point and click or toggle enhanced autos in the top lane.

Even if you reliably land your Q over and over you are only ON PAR with other top laners DPS wise. 

With the enemy being able to outplay Q, it's either Q lands and the trade goes even, or Q doesn't land and the trade is lost.

This is the same for Shen's taunt, he will always lose a trade if he doesn't use/land his taunt and gets punished hard if he misses.

Shen's Taunt NO LONGER REDUCES DAMAGE FROM AUTOS. This is supplemented with the blind somewhat but you are put into a bad position since you don't have poke and sustain anymore.



It's more wet noodle fights top lane where Shen lost last hitting under turrets, sustain, and poke.

On top of that Shen AUTOMATICALLY loses a 1 v 1 top since he can't ult himself.



My only suggestion for Shen is to change Q from the next 3 autos - Auto attacks for say, 3 seconds.

This makes duelist/damage building Shen VIABLE.

And makes it so he scales better.

they post an image of Shen's update skin models on his update page.



**TL;DR **While I'm really happy this is finally being done, the splashes now have immense inaccuracy along the lines with the models shown. 

New model splash [image](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OXQ4LNsFBm8/VpafJx52zAI/AAAAAAAA2pk/TYC5rZBZLTs/s1600/4534534343.png)


**For example 1**, [Warlord Shen](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/lolph/images/3/33/Splash_Warlord_Shen.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120827115738)

While the new look is great, it seems his helmet is no longer a traditional armoured samurai helmet (like shredder from TMNT) but is instead similar to blood moon shen, with a red demon mask. 

Also the horns are much bigger than the splash, to me this is just a different skin they should have done like shogun shen.

To top it off, the shoulder armor is different. One has the pointed shouldered armor which i really like, while the current

**Next,** [Yellow Jacket Shen](http://duoqueue.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Yellow-Jacket-Shen.jpg) and [Frozen Shen](http://www.contegrator.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Frozen-Shen-Ch2.jpg)   [Frozen Shen 2](http://img2.leaguecraft.com/lol-splash-art/asset/wallpaper_760px_3512.jpg)

I've combined these.

I actually like this model update. It looks badass as hell and really shows the mortal combat likeness and inspirations in these models. The splashes however suck. It doesn't match the splash. It seems he has magically grown a helmet on top of his mask, gained a vest, gain a massive cloth for waist coverage, and is no longer the slim looking ninja in the picture. 

I mean, literally 100% of it is different except MAYBE the shoes, i can't really tell.

It's not accurate. 


**3rd observation**


[Blood Moon Shen](http://static.mnium.org/images/contenu/actus/LOL/Shen/lol_champion_Shen_skin_Bloodmoon_hd.jpg)

Last but not least, This skin like the rest seems to have changed since Shen is now much more heavily armoured. I'm a fan but hope splashes are being redone as well as they can be for a completely different ninja and we wouldn't know. 

We didn't/are not paying for what we see AT ALL.

Again, literally 100% of the model does not match the splash, not the blades, not the armor, not the mask, nadda. Not even the toesies.

As you can see Blood Moon is wearing sandles, seperated by something.

He also has knee pads, is slimmer, and has specific blades protruding from the forearms. The horns on his helmet curve like reverse eye brows off to the side.

Although I'm a big fan of the model and prefer the change, it's not accurate.

The horns go up, the knee pads are gone and replaced with a similarly (recolored like chroma) tattered loincloth.

The only similarity i could find is his read scarf thing.

--------------------------------------

Anyways, in conclusion we spend rl money on these skins and 95% of the people probably buy it based off the badass splash art hoping to see an accurate representation of it in-game.

This is not the fact however, and I hope before Shen's updated release they change this otherwise I'll probably refund the Warlord skin myself.

Thoughts?

I think a lot of people liked it. There were some people who disagreed and that's fine.






I plan on brainstorming on these topics and expanding them further for discussion, and wanted to start with perhaps the biggest, channeling.






My idea isn't for a complete rework, more of a large bandaid.





Anywho let me know what you guys and gals think. 





Right now Channeling is pretty simple, it's 5 energy per enemy actually hit, while dealing 50% additional damage. There are some additional stuff like the 'Counterattack' where when blocking, if you channel right before taking a melee attack you will stagger the enemy opening them up for a finisher, as well as channeling mods, which no one uses outside of life strike.




I'm going to separate these into 3 small sections so that each one is easily referenced. Channeling costs, Channeled Blocking, Mods.





**1. Energy Channeling cost**. Aside from the fact that guns use NO energy and energy is required for powers, channeling is unattractive to many players who would rather reserve the power for something else. This means channeling needs to be buffed to be on par with usefulness per energy spent. 




Change the 5 energy per enemy hit. This is inconsistent among many weapons since heavy weapons that do a lot of damage, are slow but consume only 5 energy per slash. Whereas daggers consume the same amount of energy for many low damage fast attacks. In addition to this, energy costs should be consumed on-hit per ATTACK not per enemy hit. Right now if you slash 5 enemies, that costs 25 energy, i suggest this be changed to energy cost per swing. This balances small fast weapons who won't hit multiple enemies as much, and bigger weapons that hit many enemies. 




Here are my recommended changes




2 energy per hit  -  Dual Daggers, Daggers, Dual Swords, Fists, Sparring, Tonfas, Nunchaku, Claws



4 energy per hit - Swords, Nikanas, Staffs, Polearms, Sword and Shield, Whip, Blade and Whip, Machete, Glaive



6 energy per hit - Heavy Blade, Hammers, Gunblade.



Slight nerf to heavy weapons, but since you can slash 10 people with your new War, it will only cost 6 energy instead of 60. That's a huge buff considering daggers can't do the same thing. 




**2. Channeled Blocking**




So right now this is... well non-existent. It's rarely worth bothering trying to counterattack someone by putting the effort focus and concentration combined with reflexes to pay attention to a single choreographed melee attack on you so that you can risk taking damage or performing a finisher. The absolute only time I think this is useful right now is 1 v 1 with a level 500 Butcher where you risk being one-shot in exchange for actually doing okay damage.




My suggested change for Sword Alone peeps, is to gain energy when blocking attacks! Make this however, only when NOT channeling so that there is meaning between channeling and not channeling. This sounds straight forward, and not overpowered at all. This promotes defensive use as well as going Sword Alone. Also, instead of timing when to CHANNEL when BLOCKING to perform a finisher, I think channeling should be changed permanently to a toggle. This makes it so you aren't holding down a button just to get life strike, but to choose when to channel or not. The difference would be do you want to spend energy on your attacks, or gain energy for blocking. 



It would be energy gained depending on how well you ""aimed"" your block as well as how well you timed the block as well as the damage taken. Lasers and machine guns obviously gain energy in bits at a fast rate, where as slow strong attacks would grant a burst of energy. 




What this means from now on, to counterattack an enemy, all you have to do is BLOCK right before someone hits you. Simple, yet effective, and in line with many melee interactive games like Assassin's Creed and the Arkham series. 






To add on to reflecting damage, if you choose to block WHILE channeling and also have your aim sight on the opponent damaging you, attacks blocked should have a chance to be reflected back at them like lasers and lightsabers in star wars. This means those pesky far away enemies or firing ospreys can take bullets back to the face. 




To conclude this section, a melee vs melee dual would be very interesting. Although what I mention is mainly PVE, in PVP You risk a stagger when blindly attacking an opponent since they can time a block and then open up the opponent to attacks instead of finishers. Therefore you won't blindly sprint to your enemy and spam melee attacks hoping your combo outdamages and maneuvers the enemies. You now have to be conscious and balance offense and defense. Choosing when to block, and when to attack. Again similar to star wars or assassin's creed games. 




**3.  Mods**




Now this is the iffy part. My ideas aren't for a whole rework, just a fix for now until ""melee 3.0"".




To quickly start off, all melee weapons should have 2 ""exilus"" like melee slots that can only be unlocked with 'Mastery' over the weapon.





This is quite ridiculous, but it's so people grow attached to their weapon. 





I think it's appropriately balanced, as these slots will only be available to Channeling mods. This makes it so Life Strike doesn't take up a precious spot for other mods like berserker, or crit mods. 





Right now, no one uses channeling mods at all, since damage is king. An extra two ""channeling only"" slots would limit the player to deciding what they want. You might think Killing Blow is mandatory on all builds but I will explain my idea for mod changes below so that they are more meaningful. 





Lastly, since we get free energy on our melee weapons and don't have to forma them more than 2 slots, these extra Exilus slot are locked and unlocked with formaing your weapon, thus mastering it and using it more!






Instead of talking much here, I just want to lay out my ideas for the different channeling mods and leave it up to whoever might read this to like it or not!

+20% Life Steal

-140% Channeling Efficiency

*Suggested Change*

Now alot of these mods sound good on paper, and with two exilus like slots it won't mess with people's builds, makes Sword alone more viable, as well as helps players choose what they want to bring the battlefield! DPS may sound king at first, but where will you put the life strike that is innate? Do you need high end finisher damage to kill late game mobs with Killing Blow? Are you one to go berserk and endure through a never ending fight? then pickup Second Wind. If you want to be more defensive and survive longer in fights, then go with Parry and or Warrior's Grip! 





To conclude, this post is just a quick mock up I wrote when bored and finding out how none of my 47 socks have any matching pairs. 





I think channeling has been largely ignored and is used exclusively for conclave and life strike which is sad since it's such a cool concept, and makes your Warframe look badass as hell. 




These changes increase channeling efficiency across the board, letting Sword Alone Tenno not have to worry about saving energy specifically for powers, when they can now mix and match both properly. Dueling and block is a ton more meaningful instead of just some inconsistent non reliable damage reduction, and longer fights, combos, and counterattacks will become a core part of melee outside of running at your opponent while blocking then just spamming e until they or you die while toggling channel on only only only to get some health back.

My wish for Umbras were for them to be Darker variants of Warframes that would often duel or run into the ""good"" ones we use. 


TL; DR Dark version of Excal, Slash Dash can absorb damage then be cast again to release it, Eclipse is the same but makes debuffs on excal umbra cleansed then applied to enemies, Radial Javelin takes projectiles in a cone in front then fires them off back, Energy waves of Exalted blade do less damage, push back, destroy mid air projectiles. 

1. Revenge  -  Excalibur Umbra blocks with his shadow/exalted blade absorbing all damage for up to 2 seconds or when activated again. Afterwards Excalibur Umbra dashes between enemies within a cone 6 / 8 / 10 / 12 meters long and cuts them down with his Shadow/Exalted Blade. Each strike inflicts 100 / 140 / 180 / 220 base damage + power strength + amount of damage absorbed. 


2. Eclipse  -  Excalibur summons and raises his Shadow/Exalted Blade, releasing a burst of darkness that affects enemies within 8 / 11 / 14 / 17 meters and blinds them for 6 / 8 / 10 / 12 seconds. (Everything turns dark but you can still see outlines of the terrain, enemies can be seen with ""heatseeking"" vision in the color of red/your energy color. Exposes them to finisher damage etc. etc. If Eclipse is cast while under the effect of crowd control, Excalibur Umbra is cleansed and purged of the debuff and applies that debuff to enemies around him.


3. Piercing Shadow  -  Excalibur Umbra stops all projectiles in a cone in front of him for the next 1/1/2/2/3 seconds then disperses them in the form of Shadow Spears launched in a cone behind him. (Player can turn around to fire wherever they want but can't exactly see EXACTLY where they are aiming, it's just behind them. 


4. Imposing Blade  -  Excalibur Umbra draws an ethereal longsword of pure darkness and wields it as his melee weapon. Same as Exalted Blade except his energy waves will destroy projectiles, do less damage, but can push back enemies. 



Now he may ""counter"" excalibur in each ability BUT it requires high skill/precise timing to do so. Since PVP isn't for everyone this is just for the theme. 

Excalibur can still Slash Dash you but if you are fast enough you can absorb the blow then return your own Slash Dash.

Eclipse will remove Radial Blind from you and then of course cast its on version in a different light (or lack there of)

Piercing Shadow is really hard to use and time but if you see the other Excal hypothetically then you can take the javelins then fire them off with a delay in a cone behind you. If you do a badass 180 then fire them behind you it's like a power rangers finisher explosion scene. 

Imposing Blade has push back like the Stalkers. Love to see an Excal and Excal Umbra duel. 

I wrote this up cause I found out Excalibur Umbra has the same abilities and didn't like it..

Now I personally would have paid about 1000 or so plat if it had these additional things, which I really thing it should have. 



1. Stalker helm. Now I don't know about you but I'd love to cosplay the stalker. I kind of understand why they didn't since it might be excal exclusive but I would have changed helms in a ~~heart~~ transferencebeat.


2. I want the sash/loin cloth. Now the chestpiece if you guys didn't notice, is upside down. I don't know why that is or if it's intended but they fucked it up. Regardless, I want the loincloth. I feel naked sometimes and always wanted a ""belt"" or sash of some sort, like waist armor. I dunno, it's the one thing missing from his armor and it bothers me. It's one thing having a syndanna, but it looks badass paladin/templar like when you got double protection for your bad boy downstairs.

3. Vengeful Revenant. There have been stances part of a pack in the past. In fact there are almost none of these new rare stances NOT in these packs! Huntress/Ivara has deviled snapdragon. Gunslinger/Mesa has Highnoon, Mirage pack has eleventh storm, Equinox has Final Harbringer. It's a super rare stance as probably identifies with the Stalker more than anything due to it's name, and the names of its combos, of course the description: Hate, Dread, Despair.

Run Plate-Earth (Crossfire)

Run through killing things. After 20-50 enemies screen will blink blue, keep moving forward a tile or so until you see Scanning Blue Oculysts, shoot them or let them scan you. They will detect you then screen blinks blue again then they spawn.


If Conculysts dont spawn then restart mission or restart when all Conculysts are dead and mod did not drop for maximum time efficiency. 


Only Conculysts can drop the stance


**Frames:**  Equinox, Ivara, Hydroid, Nekros


**Equinox** Strength/range build (range kind of optional) kills everything. Massive slash damage means a pure damage type means if you were able to store enough, you can bring an sentient down to half while they don't resist anything BUT slash. I don't think you can cut them in half for multiple bodies 


**Ivara** Duration/Efficiency build. Pickpocket the Conculysts for a drop, when done waypoint that conculyst so your team and Hydroid know that it can be killed.


**Hydroid**  Ever since the change, the tentacles do not have to deal the killing blow, they just have to be tangled/damaging them. No mod specifics but if you are hesitant in targetting, build more range, if you are worried about timing it to when the Conculysts will die, build more duration, if you need more killing power go Strength. Just equip Pilfering Swam and cast it to a near - dead Conculyst (should be marked by Ivara with waypoint to signal they have been pickpocketed)


**Nekros** Efficiency + low duration + cast speed - When a Conculyst dies, Desecrate. After you are done desecrating you can wait til the other Conculysts are dead then desecrate them. Regardless, after they are all dead, use your 4th power to bring them back to life because after the duration wears off, you can desecrate them AGAIN.

Around the time that Leoric was released, i was on a losing streak.  Not the best player in HoTs, I was placed in rank 22 and managed to make it to 16 before being dropped to the high 30s. I was feeling how the dark side gained ground around me. I felt the anger..  the frustration... the hate. I despised lower class saiyans with all my heart, my pride grasped my throat slowly making every fresh breath of air.. of hope in others.. in team work escape me. 

Every time one of my allies died at level 3, I wrote GG jokingly.. but later I stopped joking. I realized that this early in the game, if someone made such a petty mistake (it had nothing to do with the enemy making a smart play, obviously, cause I'm the best at this game and would have made an even better player even sooner) then that meant they would be doomed to repeat or make more mistakes thus resulting in a difficult game to win. 

I stayed away from Nova.. a character too many people played. I learned how to counter her as a warrior main and did really well for myself but the games just wern't showing signs of victory...

Then I saw similar patterns in the enemy Zeratuls.. these characters exploited the weaknesses, carelessness and noobiness of the other players on my team.

So after training on a foreign planet.. my ship was destroyed, a meteor shower was decimating a planet that was doomed to die and rebuild itself through debris. The only thing was, this time it was different, because I was on it. I had no idea how a lower class saiyan like kakorot (my feeder friend) reached rank 1 and I was stuck at rank 37.. It didn't make sense. It should have been me... I'm just unlucky...

But then it happened. I unleashed my anger in hero select and let the darkness overwhelm me and consume me. My friend reached rank 1 because he was pure of heart, I could not achieve such a thing knowing my shadow wished to cut the throats of all my allies... so i gave in and realized that a pure heart of evil would suffice.

Thus I resorted to toxicity, calling people names, putting them down, yelling at them with sophisticated words and superior vocabulary (english student). I pointed out their moves, mistakes or not, and lectured how they should have been better and that they suck and should uninstall and die.

I was horrible.. but it worked. Slowly but surely my rage fueled my skills by spamming nova, zeratul, and greedy kill monguls like Sonya. 

I now find myself at rank 1 and do not regret my dark path, i may be muted and can only communicate with friends, but it was well worth the beautiful leaves outlining my rank 1 sign... my mmr rising towards and beyond 3000 (9000 :p).

**Passive:**  The Path of Twilight
 
Upon entering the Nexus, the player can choose which path of discipline the player wishes Shen to use during the match! They can only choose *one* of the *two* paths and each defines Shen's intended role throughout the game. As a Ninja who is known for saving his allies and taking hits, Shen can choose between becoming a saving Tank, or the warrior duelist every ninja should be.

**1: Bright Shadow (Duelist option)**

Every 9/8/7 Seconds, Shen's next auto attack against a champion or large monster has **450** range, allowing Shen to instantly close in behind his target by blinking through the shadows and then makes Shen strike 4 times at max attack speed. Each strike in this way **ignores and destroys** shields deals **30%** of Shen's attack damage and on hit effects that would apply to the first auto attack, apply to all four auto attacks at **33%** efficiency. If Shen is below 50% hp, Auto attacks against champions reduce the cooldown of this passive buff by 1 second. If Shen is below 50% energy, auto attacks grant 10 energy (40 when using passive). Bright Shadow will always trigger on minions below 15% hp without putting it on cooldown.

**OR**

**2: Chaos Order (Team Player Tank option)**

Every 9/8/7 Seconds, Shen's next auto attack against a champion or large monster will **steal 4/5/6%** of the target's maximum hp in magic damage, Shen and nearby allies are then granted a shield, equal to the amount stolen. (Shield range is 500) If Shen is below 50% hp, Auto attacks against champions reduce the cooldown of this passive buff by 1 second. If Shen is below 50% energy, auto attacks grant 10 energy. Chaos Order will always trigger on minions below 15% hp without putting it on cooldown but heals Shen at a reduced rate.




**Q: Mark of Twilight**



COOLDOWN:  12/11/10/9/8 seconds 



Energy Cost:  60 



Range:  450 



Width:  300



MAGIC DAMAGE: 60 / 90 / 120 / 150 / 180 (+40% of bonus AD and 40% AP)
**ACTIVE: **  Shen can use this ability under the effects of crowd control (but not stasis)  Shen slashes the air with his katanas in quick fashion dealing magic damage in a small area in front of him. This slash can destroy the next spell within .5 seconds that were to hit him *AND* blocks the next incoming auto attack for 1 seconds. If an auto attack or spell is blocked in this way, Shen's passive is refreshed and this ability refunds half the cooldown and energy cost. 



**W: Safeguard** 



COOLDOWN:  6 Seconds



Energy Cost:  60



**ACTIVE:**  Shen turns invisible for 1s and gains a shield that absorbs 40/80/120/160/200 damage + 5% of Shen's Maximum Health. If Shen attacks, the stealth is broken. The shield dissipates after 3 seconds if not already destroyed. (The first second overlapping with the invisibility). If the shield is broken while Shen is invisible, he is refunded 30 energy. Safeguard will not turn Shen invisible if taunted enemies are attacking him.




**Shadow Dash: ** 



COOLDOWN: 16 / 14 / 12 / 10 / 8



Energy Cost: 100



ACTIVE:  Shen dashes in the target direction, dealing magic damage to all enemy champions he hits, taunting them for 1.5 seconds and restoring 40 energy per target hit. 

EDIT:  Shen takes half damage from taunted enemies for the duration. 

MAGIC DAMAGE: 50 / 85 / 120 / 155 / 190 (+ 50% AP)



**R: Stand United**



Sworn to protect the innocent, Shen accesses the Eye of Twilight's ancient secret. Shen channels for 3 seconds, granting the ally his Safeguard (putting it on cooldown) and tripling its shield amount. This shield dissapates after 5 seconds if not destroyed already. After the channel is finished, Shen will appear in front of your ally if they are facing an enemy, or behind your ally if they are facing away from an enemy. If Shen is to take fatal damage, Shen consumes all energy and puts Stand United on cooldown, then shield him instead. 





**Gameplay and Notes:**



Now to start things off, Shen may look severely overpowered with this loaded complicated kit. This would only be truly proved in actual gameplay. My justification for the rework and buffs is to consider how much some recent champion reworks have gone. For example, Darius and Garen. Both of these champions were already strong, but did need work to be truly truly viable. Darius as an example, lost movement speed on his passive, it became physical damage, and his Q gained a delay. In return however he gained Noxian Might upon reaching 5 bleeds stacks, a massive heal on his Q, and permanent reset on his ultimate later in the game. This was the trade for power weighing heavily in the rework's favor. For Garen, they reduced the armor and magic resistance bonus from his W, and instead added a small flat amount for farming. They upped his damage on his E by making it tick more and added the Justice/Villian system which allowed Garen to deal much more true damage to enemy's on certain killing sprees. Again, heavily weighing the rework's favor. 



In Shen's case, he is giving up health sustain on his Q, and ultimately innate sustain altogether if he chooses Bright Shadow. Shen's only heal lies in Chaos Order  which acts like the Grasp of the Undying keystone.  The burst energy gain is gone from his passive as well, and auto attacks only reduce the cooldown of his passive if Shen is low on health. In addition to this the energy cost to his now buffed shield is slightly higher, require more energy overall to push Shen users to even smarter and more complicated energy management. Shen instead restores a low amount of energy, 10, when below 50% energy. This makes Shen users have access to very strong abilities, but clear downtimes in the form of energy and not just cooldown. Lastly, Stand United now scales with Shen's W and health, so tankier builders will have a stronger shield. But for the duelist split pusher in you, Stand United will save Shen from fatal damage himself.



My dream for my main champion, Shen, is to revive him in a way to be a ninja who is known to protect and lead the Kinkou order. One who can duel the likes of opponent's he faces like his Nemesis Zed but only when using proper techniques. Hence the high skill cap. To add on to his lore, he still saves allies with precision taunts, and his teleporting ultimate and shields. Also, as of now Akali is 1 of 4 ninja who can turn invisible. That's a little silly. Thus Shen has a mere 1 second invisibility on the first second of his W shield ability for some fun jukes and plays, just like the ninja he should be. 



**Notes on the passive:**  
Maintaining a path of balance allows players to pick between a passive for destroying, or saving, as there must be balance in everything.



 If you wish to take a more damage, assassination, fighter, or duelist approach, you as a Shen player will want to go with Bright Shadow. This passive will make you have a Jayce-like gap closing blink hyper charge on your next auto attack. This has high downtime but is your main approach to sticking to a target and dishing out good damage. The attacks early game do very small damage as Shen has low ad, but as you build on-hit effect items, these effects work at a lower efficiency but with 4 immediate hits. This means your sheen/triforce proc will benefit at 133% efficiency, the Bork you build will deal 8% instead of 6% in the form of 4 autos, and guinsoos rageblade will stack insanely fast making it core on a split pushing duelist Shen. 



The blink on the auto attack is to resemble the second part of Ekko's E ability. To where you can pull of some amazing plays, dodges, etc. with this passive. It resembles Zed's Death mark as well, instantly closing in on your target. This version is slightly less forbidden ;) . 



If you are more of a team fighter and plan on saving your allies or peeling during a fight, you will want to go with Chaos Order. This passive allows your next auto attacks to steal a percentage of maximum hp from your target, then shield each and every ally for the full bonus damage dealt while healing Shen. This makes Shen support or front line tanky Shen, keep himself sustained in a fight. He can whack the enemy tank for a small, but useful shield for his team!! In long team fights, if you can get in range to slash at someone this is truly a fight helper. 



While playing support or the front line, just hit the enemy Mundo and see a nice shield granted to your allies as well as a healthy chunk against their tank, keeping you and your allies alive longer.





**Notes on the Q, Mark of Twilight**



My original idea of this resembled Fiora's now E ALOT. This was before her rework. This version is much like a fatter wider Yasuo Q (that's what she said). Instead of slowing or stunning your opponent however, this ability simply stops the attack BUT refreshes your passive.



 As an offensive diver, you can hop onto the enemy target with your passive, then, while they use their own escape if they make the mistake of hitting you with a spell or auto you can get a reduced cooldown and continue the chase, or have your passive refreshed on Bright Shadow for another gap closer!!! Sticky as heck but relies on IMMENSE reflexes as the slash is over .5 seconds (2/3ds of Fiora's E) AS WELL AS your opponent making a risky/vital mistake. 



As a team fighter and/or peeler, this ability with proper use and perfect timing, can stop that Ashe Arrow from hitting your ADC, or that fatal mundo cleaver, Bard Q, Syndra Stun, you name it! Save this for stopping that vital spell for your team, then refresh your passive and shield them!



When below 50% health, this Passive Cooldown is halved so Shen can use it move often, whether it mean stick to your enemy target more often in a duel or assassination when low, or shield and health yourself when low. When below 50% energy (below 100) Shen's auto attacks can retrieve 10 energy. This sounds decent, but is a much weaker version of Lee Sin's restore and Shen's current burst restore. This is compensation for the mass amount of power his Passive provides.




**Notes on the W, Safeguard**



Now I renamed this Safeguard because the definition of Feint is false and doesn't make sense for a shield ability: *Noun 1. a deceptive or pretended blow, thrust, or other movement, especially in boxing or fencing.
""a brief feint at the opponent's face""*



Safeguard is slightly weaker shield than Feint is now in regards to a removal of AP ratio, lower base shield amount, and slightly higher energy cost (energy cost is up by a whopping 20%). In exchange it now scales with bonus health for tanky Shens, and grants 1 second of invisibility upon casting. This seems very powerful and definitely worth the trade. The invisibility is meaningless however if you wish to deal damage, but can stop the opponent from casting a spell if done right due to them losing vision. You can also pull some sick nasty juking between top or bot lane brushes, just like 1/3rd of a charge of Kha'zix's ultimate!



Ultimately, you can use this, then engage with a scarier more unforeseen Taunt, juke an opponent out by changing directions, or some other nifty things like that invisible body block. Just keep in mind it's only for one second. 



**Notes on E, Shadow Dash**



This ability all in all is pretty much the same. It is core to the Shen we know and love and may look weak on paper but really really does have its uses.  With the new Q Shen has, landing a taunt means you can almost guarantee the Q block which is really nice and powerful synergy. All in all though the energy cost is at a permanent premium high of 100. 



**Notes on R, Stand United**



Shen players now suffer from an unusable non-existent AP ratio. You only use it for the small benefits from a maybe Tri-force or when you are cheesing with AP Shen. Every other champion in the game with pure ap ratios have a use for it one way or another except Shen. That's simply because he's outdated! No problem we removed it. Stand United now scales with triple your Safeguard amount. So tankier Shen's grant a stronger shield. 



Shen players also cannot split push due to no wave clear, and immediately losing any duel or trade due to not being able to use his ultimate in a 1 v 1. 
Well no more! Shen's may still lack waveclear until a sunfire or guinsoos, but when you 1 v 1 that Jax, Irelia, or Riven top lane, you are not without an ultimate! If you are to receive fatal damage (that would kill you basically) Stand United will go on cooldown and shield you. But in return, you will have 0 energy. This is to win that really close duel where their ultimate would have made a clear difference since you can't use yours in a fight. It makes Shen very hard to finish off. Lastly, now you can make your teammate invisible for 1 second too!!!




**Gameplay Notes**



You will pick one of your two disciplines/passives upon entering the game. This cannot be changed for the rest of the match so choose wisely. Bright Shadow is for sticking to a target, doing more damage, and to help last hitting under tower. Most suitable for the dangerous, duel intensive, farm heavy top laners. Chaos Order can be picked as well and does wonders in trading with the life drain and shield however so both suit top lane well. What Chaos Order does in team fights is better in some ways however since you can shield Allies as well! Pick wisely.



In the top lane, you will want to last hit with Bright Shadow's innate effect, or Chaos Order 's innate effect. This helps with finishing off minions since Shen has low attack damage and lost Ki Strike for last hitting under towers. Similarly to Gangplank, you will want to attack the opponent and trade smartly but efficiently when you have your passive. Bright Shadow is not strong damage wise early game but can blink and gap closer to dodge a spell and stick to your target. Chaos Order instead is safer as you get a heal and shield for hitting your opponent and resembles current Shen's Q-Ki strike today. Pick fights you think you can win but keep in mind that winning a duel most likely relies on trickery with 1 second invisibility, and the stopping of an ability or auto attack from your opponent that was key to winning the fight with your .5 second Q. High risk = high reward but play safe if you are not confident in outplaying your opponent. They would be fools to tower dive you when you have your ultimate up, which you can still use to win a fight bot lane. Keep in mind Shen's ultimate is only useful for all-in duels in the top lane as wearing Shen down with harassment will put him at a disadvantage.  



If you jungle, both passive options are viable as well. The gap closer isn't reliable outside of juking in the jungle, but the on hit effects are enhanced with Bright Shadow making jungling Shen more useful. Chaos Order heals and Shields Shen offering him very strong sustain against the dangerous jungle monsters. Shen also has a Shield, and semi-good ganks with a taunt. Also using his passive to gap close or turn a fight. If an unexpected battle happens in a lane anywhere on the map, Shen's level 6 presence is available to turn the tide of any skirmish. Smart opponents will be aware of this and will either try to bait out the cooldown, or play around it. 



You can still and also support with Shen! here you will most likely take Chaos Order for the heal and shield, while grabbing a targons. Save your ally with a taunt, body block and stay alive with your shield, and block Thresh hooks and Blitz hooks with a perfectly timed Twilight Slash. Then you can save and support any ally on the map with Stand United. 




**Dueling**


Shen is designed to be able to duel Champions like Jax, Irelia, Zed, Riven and Yasuo. All those high skill cap champs with high damage, assassination potential etc. 



In the laning phase, with proper timing you can dodge and block Zed's Q harass with your own Q. If he throws his shadow out, you can gapclose with your passive to auto attack the enemy since it's non-dodgeble and will follow him to his shadow. If he takes the auto attack and re positions you can attempt to land your taunt. When Zed ults you, you can turn invisible for a second making it harder for him to land his spells, and if Death Mark truly does finish you off, you can survive with Stand United. The downside is your Stand United has about twice the cooldown of a Zed ult so fight wisely.



With Irelia, your Bright Shadow passive against minions and her refreshing q on minions are very similar. Dashing around the battle field is key! She will out duel you in a stand still so you need to land your taunt smartly and play around her stun. You have your shield as well to mitigate damage and go invisible if it's unfavorable trade.



With Jax you will not want to use Bright Shadow when he has his E up as you will get hurt bad by his stun. You want to dodge it with your invisibility from your shield and time your taunt to where maybe he can't empower his Q yet or to dash away from his Q+E. A fun matchup as well.



Shen's Bright Shadow destroys and negates Shields for a time. Timing this properly is one of the keys to defeating Riven. You can also attempt to interrupt her Qs, or her Stun with your own Q if you feel confident enough, and taunt her to stop her from using her abilities. Her ultimate execute is countered by your own ultimate, but like the matchup with Zed it has a much higher cooldown. 



Against Yasuo you guys will be dashing back and forth. You will want to block his tornados similar to his own Windwall and taunt him out of his dash or q. 



To conclude all matchups are skill based due to his timing on his passive and very very hard to use Q but are all winnable in the right hands. 
My dream for Shen is to have the option as a lifesaver tank, OR a duelist, as well as a true ninja. 



Hope you enjoy or like my rework!




EDIT:  MichaelDeucalion suggested you have the swords perma unsheathed if you go offense, and sheated most of the time if you go defense. I love this idea as the support kind can use ""ki"" more and tank shots rather than always using swords. I personally love the idea xD

Not getting what we pay for. Inaccurate and either laziness, or lack of communication between design and art team. No other game has clear errors like this. 

https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202294884-Champion-Update-Schedule

Now I know it's alot of extra work updating a Champion's visuals. It also may be less motivating for the designers to do that for a champion whose lore most likely won't change. Also Shen's model isn't the worse, but...


The [Splashart](http://lol.esportspedia.com/w/images/0/0a/Shen_Splash_0.jpg) is ridiculously inaccurate to his [model](http://www.lolking.net/models?champion=98&amp;skin=0) in-game. 


What I see when I'm in the riot store, looking to purchase a champion, is this super badass Ninja of Twilight. Glowing eyes, dark blue themed, double sworded ninja with sweet looking armor.


But when I walk into game.. it's nothing like what I expected!!!


You're telling me that I don't do damage and am a tank with low mobility?! but I'm a ninja...


*sigh*


This post isn't about that, it's about the visuals though.. the advertisement splash for shen is NOT what we get in game. 



Now people might say well it's like that for alot of champions, but the accuracy is completely off. The whole point of riot redoing old splashes for certain skins is to justify what people PAY FOR with their currency. You should get what you see or AT LEAST DON'T FALSELY ADVERTISE IT. 



Please refer to the model from lolking and shen splash linked above.



**Exhibit A**:  [Splashart](http://lol.esportspedia.com/w/images/0/0a/Shen_Splash_0.jpg) Badass spiked wrist gauntlets of thornmail like tankiness. I don't know what they are called in the ninja world but these things look awesome and armored as hell! I feel like I could tank some hits blocking with this and if a sword came my way it would get stuck on the wristguard for sures!


But I get into game and the [model](http://www.lolking.net/models?champion=98&amp;skin=0)... it looks like a piece of knight armor was cut off with a can opener then painted blue. Completely smooth, no spikes, no multilayering wrist armor with belt straps, in fact he's wearing freakin gloves in the splash art yet is barehanded (with awkwardly big hands at that, but hey I can dig it) in the model! What the heck bro.


**Exhibit B**:  The Mask. Now the face of a champion is literally how people identify them. Whether it be by the portrait, or just human nature. You recognize an individual by their face. Now in this case, even though they are distinctly different, you know that's shen by first looking at the splash. But as a new player you can see some clear differences!! Now in Shen's [Splashart](http://lol.esportspedia.com/w/images/0/0a/Shen_Splash_0.jpg) He has this awesome mysterious, scary but badass visage of ninjaness. He clearly has the ""Eye of Twilight"" kind of eyes, and the neat forehead crown identifying him. Also though, that mask, it's not your typical cloth mask that covers his face! no.. this ninja is out to fight Zed. He needs armor, and boy does that kind of ninja helmet look awesome or what!!! It's like ninja gaiden in LoL I love it! 


Derp. [model](http://www.lolking.net/models?champion=98&amp;skin=0) Nope. It's just a cloth mask in the model! OOPS. Why did we do this splash? cause it looks awesome, is it an accurate representation of the champion? kinda not really. Maybe this should be a new skin called ""Armored Shen"" yeah... Shen in the model has a clear non-armored cloth like mask, with something covering his mouth. Surely it could be metal, but this plate doesn't exist in the splash art... he has something different.


**Exhibit C**:  The Shoulder armor.  Now in Shen's current [Splashart](http://lol.esportspedia.com/w/images/0/0a/Shen_Splash_0.jpg) he has some nice looking armor! it's got nice detail and swirl to it, slightly climbing and curving upwards towards his face, which is appropriate for avoiding decapitation. Along the end it's also has a little spike. Nothing super fancy, just good old nice looking Shoulder armor. But wait! Let's look at his [model](http://www.lolking.net/models?champion=98&amp;skin=0)  Uh.. nope. These here are some studded shoulder pads that were put on his shoulders. Now I'm not criticizing his current look necessarily but again, as a customer, I'm not getting what I pay for. The art looks way different than the model. Maybe riot should show the in-game model of champs clearly instead.. cause Shen just doesn't look nearly as cool. Now according to his [Original Splash](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120130034416/leagueoflegends/images/archive/b/b9/20141013221135!Shen_OriginalSkin.jpg)   It's more accurate, but yet, still wrong. Here, Shen's shoulder pads are clear, distinct ""rhombus"" like shapes, with spikes, and clear gilding! (Which is important cause, runescape) yet in his model.. it lacks the point, the spikes, the alternate lighter blue tint.. it's different, it's wrong. 


**Exhibit D**:  The Belt and Chest. Once again, this cool looking armored sash belt looks way different than the splash. The former looks cool, plain, but workable yet the model in game has this different kind of buckle with a serpent looking design on it. I mean I won't rant here, it's a clear distinction. On to the chest, this one is a little more discrete because you need to be a lot more nit (knit?) picky and really analyze the picture, but as you can see [Splashart](http://lol.esportspedia.com/w/images/0/0a/Shen_Splash_0.jpg) He has armor sitting above his belt, looking like it covers his chest. It looks pretty cool, in fact I hope that it is similar if not identical to [Zed1](http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Zed_0.jpg)      [Zed2](http://pre06.deviantart.net/d640/th/pre/i/2013/037/a/6/zed_with_botrk___lol_digi_art_throwdown_entry__ip__by_ltldigitalart-d5u1h76.png)   [Zed3](http://img14.deviantart.net/8d06/i/2013/221/d/a/zed_s_living_shadows_by_kiremeister-d6hc5c0.jpg)       since they are from the same clan or whatever.  The current model looks like he is wearing a sort of kevlar, or leather armor. Looks cool, fit, mobile, but it just doesn't fit the splash!



**Conclusion**:  I can continue my rant about his swords but its hard to see. I just want to say, that in every game you never see clear inaccurate discrepancies like this. Literally every game shows this unless it's an error because there is proper communication with the design/creative team, and the art team.


Riot said that they changed/updated a lot of the splash arts because they inaccurately described the Champion correctly. Thus the product you are ""selling"" is not necessarily what the player gets. This should also/may cause problems on refund issues. As a customer in any way, you should get what you paid for. No more no less, it's common customary customer satisfaction.

1. Combos. All combos should have 4 ""movements"". Whenever doing a combo, either have it available when moving back, standing still, walking forward, or sprinting forward


2. Jump attacks should have a homing mechanism against airborne targets similar to archwing melee.


2. More damage overall. Melee should not fall off late game and should reward a player for being close and risking heavy damage tanking, rather than punished.


3. Mention the range of all melee weapons under stats, so we know how much a Reach mod effects it and what you like.. for example, a sword you increase the range from the tip onwards, but on a double bladed orthos it should extend both sides, what about the Kronen though? there are sharp edges on each tip BUT the sides have blades too so shouldnt range increase the length AND width from hilt? We will never know...


4. Stances should be re balanced to have all stances viable, showing the damage multipliers and damage type conversions. i think it's utterly stupid and irresponsible that there are hidden damage bonuses in the game and we have no idea what we are putting out. Why do we have to rely on the wiki and their testing? Dakra Prime IS NOT THAT STRONG. Crimson Dervish is.


5. Blocking needs to be reworked, again, players going sword alone should be rewarded for risking themselves out in the open not punished. I suggest taking % reduction from enemies in front of you scaling up high if your target reticle is right on the enemy, but down further to the sides. Also Orthos Prime is unique as an example of being able to parry a 60-70% radius in front of you because of the long weapon type, where as shield weapons are much more reliable in blocking, but say a whip doesn't block everything but blocks a large area 


6. Channeling should be completely reworked and allow someone to go sword alone with Channeling constantly in exchange for less power usage due to energy consumption. Channeling should cost more for slower weapons, and less for faster weapons. It only makes sense. The fact that we don't have to use energy to maximize damage output for our guns, but do for our swords (but never ever having it worth it) is just wrong. I think channeling thorugh our guns or bows would be awesome and badass as hell just make it viable..


7. Remove Pressure Point and add the damage to all melee weapons to free us up a slot. It's mandatory on all melee weapons so just have it added anyways. If you dont want to give newbies that kind of damage, then have weapons have higher damage as you rank it up.


8. Add an exilus slot to melee weapons so we have room for channeling efficiency, range, or other of those mods we never use


9. Reward Tenno in the very much long term for mastering a weapon even as simple as the skana. Similar to mod energy and Forma, maybe when you fully forma the weapon you can combine stances or choose which combos to bring to battle or a mission for a thousand different combinations of fighting styles that FIT YOU. (See mastery and Stance customization below)


**Bonus Stuff/Suggestions from others**

- Sword alone dueling system, like lightsaber fights, where blocking will make your warframe's animations block the others (i know super complicated), strafing, attacking, etc. 


- Mastery - Maybe a special Sugatra, warframe skin, sigil or something to show mastery over a weapon. Maybe receive it when you fully forma a weapon and have x amount of kills with each stance. 


- Stance customization - Combine the heavy slow spinning hits of Crimson Dervish, and switch out some of the combos for the faster gap closing ones of Iron Phoenix for your own stance, with the number of stances AND combos in the game the customization will be endless..


- Buff Silva and Aegis


-Release Dual Nikanas (Please Tenshin)

It falls prey to fast start up decks, but over time you can lay down plenty of damage mixed with a bag of tricks to take multiple prize cards at once. 
  
  
Here's the deck:  
  
  
**Pokemon**  (19)


* 2 Gastly (BREAKthrough 58)
* 2 Gengar (BREAKthrough 60)
* 2 Bronzor (BREAKthrough 95) 
* 2 Bronzong (BREAKthrough 96) 
* 3 Zubat (Phantom Forces 31) 
* 3 Golbat (Phantom Forces 32) 
* 3 Crobat (Phantom Forces 33) 
* 2 Wobbuffet (Phantom Forces 36)

  

**Trainers** (29)

* 4 Head Ringer (Phantom Forces 97)
* 1 Xerosic (Phantom Forces 110)
* 2 Team Flare Grunt (XY 129)
* 2 Enhanced Hammer
* 2 Professor Sycamore
* 2 Lysandre
* 2 AZ
* 1 Pokemon Fan Club
* 3 Dimension Valley
* 2 Rare Candy
* 2 Professor's Letter
* 4 VS Seeker
* 2 Ultra Ball
  
  
**Energy** (12)
  
* 2 Double Colorless
* 4 Mystery
* 6 Psychic Energy
  
  
I'm still tweaking this deck, not 100% sure if I want to run the energy stall/trickster deck. I find it extremely useful in shutting down your opponent's pokemon's energy gains. 
  
  
The deck uses very few energy on the Pokemon themselves, especially with Dimension Valley in play ALL of your pokemon will have abilities that are free, or one psychic energy bar Bronzong, who the double colorless is for.
  
  
The idea behind this deck is to lay down as many damage counters as possible on your opponent's pokemon using Zubat, Golbat, and Crobat, as well as AZ to pick them back up for re-use. In addition to this, the new BreakTHROUGH Gengar has an amazing move that puts on damage counter on all opponent's benched pokemon, as well as poisoning their active. This is the perfect set up for the next part of the deck, in comes Bronzong. The BreakTHROUGH Bronzong has a move similar to Gallade-EX's, in which he deals 30 damage to all pokemon who already has damage counters on it (though you miss out on the 110 to the active). With Gengar BreakTHROUGH and Bats respectively, it's easy to get at least 1 damage counter on all your opponent's pokemon as Bronzong starts to hit the entire field. Lastly, the deck is wrapped up with the Wobbuffet from Phantom Forces, who negates abilities but is also perfect for finishing off pokemon with damage counters on them. Gengar's second ability does something similar, and in some cases more hard hitting since if the opponent's defending pokemon already has 3 damage counters or more on them, they are automatically K.O.'d.
  
  
To conclude, the trainer cards revolve around finding cards in your deck, and the cheapest attacks around with Dimension Valley. But the core of the trainer cards reside in shutting down your opponent's ability to set-up and stack energy. There are 9 trainer cards in this deck (almost 1/6th of the deck) dedicated to doing this job, as well as 4 VS Seekers for you to reuse any supporters you want.

I do believe though that unlike most heroes in the game even upon release, he feels clunky, slow, and just a little off or just missing a little something. 
  
  
What change would you make straight up in the patch notes to solve this problem.
  
  
Here are mine:  
  
  
**Abilities:**  
  
  
**Blade Dash:**  Artanis takes 25% less damage while using Blade Dash.
  
I wanted to make it unstoppable like many people wanted, but realized it is good counterplay to his kit. You can't safely deal aoe damage to a minion wave with the consequence of harass just like any other melee warrior. There should be tradeoffs. 
  
  
**Twin Blades**:  Cooldown ~~4~~ 5 seconds,  *Zealot Charge* effect is now innate. 
  
  
**Talents:** 
  
  
**Level 13:**  Graviton Vortex removed, replaced with **Space Flux** : the Range and Speed of Prism Sphere is increased by 30%
  
  
**Level 16**:  Zealot Charge removed, replaced with **Reflex Dash**:  The return attack of Blade dash can be redirected and aimed within 45 degrees behind Artanis. 
  
  
**Explanations on suggested changes below:** 
  
  
First change makes Artanis more resistant to damage during Blade Dash, which isn't too much of a buff since he can use it to dodge alot of skills anyways, but won't be punished as much for laning or poking. (You can now use it for poking, before it wasn't ideal).
    
Zealot charge should be innate on Artanis as with his already extremely low attack speed and low mobility in today's game/meta, it makes him feel like you have very little impact on the game pre-16, to compensate for it being too much sticking power, Twin Blades would have its cooldown increased to 5 seconds. 
  
  
Next, Prism Sphere already has extremely pitiful range and speed, you would have to be absolutely clumped in a melee brawl with multiple foes and even then would be lucky/find Graviton Vortex useful. The replacement talent would make it more appealing to pick and use for picks and initiations or snazzy plays, in place of the still powerful Phase Bulwark (50% damage from abilities for 3 seconds), Triple Strike, and Burning Rage. This makes Artanis gain a considerable but situational power spike at 13. 
  
  
Lastly, the Reflex Dash talent I thought of is to pull of sick nasty jukes and plays with your repositioning, as well as help hit targets who may otherwise have avoid the extra damage. This talent would still compete with Shield Surge (50% extra shield decaying over 3 seconds ), Titan Killer (2.5% damage per attack on Twin Blades)  and Psionic Wound (Twin Blades applies Vulnerable).  
  
  
To conclude, I think having a low attack range makes sense with the look of Artanis's weapons though many can disagree due to Monk for example. By having Zealot Charge innate, but on a higher cooldown, Artanis would actually have a more reliable gap closer, yet not be unescapable, as well as less clunky so you can hit that Arthas back after the root wears off. Blade Dash grants some resistance to those pesky turret hits you take when innocently trying to wave clear or poke, with a level 16 talent that brings unique diversity and interesting gameplay/mobility to the predictable Blade Dash ability. Lastly, the slow boring short ranged unreliable Prism Sphere remains, but its ""hitting two targets"" (please send me a vid of that ever happening in a real game) has been replaced with higher ranged and faster speed. 
  
  
**What is everyone's thoughts on this? Is this change good for Artanis? do you agree or disagree? will he be broken op with innate Zealot Charge on his W ability?**

**3. Battle Roar** - Makes all enemies nearby focus Rhino with their attacks and grants all nearby Warframes increased damage for a short duration.  
  
  

Rhino lets out a forceful roar, causing Rhino to take 10% reduced damage (brutallama had the idea of making this scale with # of enemies hit instead)  and causing all enemies within 15/20/22/25 meters to attack and focus fire him. The roar also increases the damage output of his allies within 15 / 20 / 22 / 25 meters. Affected allies will gain 10% / 15% / 25% / 50% damage to all sources over a duration of 30 seconds.

**Notes** : 
I want to note again this is just some ideas I threw on top of what DE proposed on their Devstream while the Rhino rework is a WIP. 
  
  
Thank you to the amazing Warframe Wiki for being the database that you are. I found most of my information from you guys. 
  
See my rant under 'Roar' where I talk about Rhino's description from the Lotus.
  
  

Rhino has a huge massive armor buff on my proposed change. Maybe he doesn't need it. Half the population laughs that he is the heavy tank frame and has pitiful armor, the other half argue that it's because he has Iron Skin. I say screw that, he should be the tankiest. It doesn't make sense that skinny Valkyr with a power that makes her nigh invincible, should also have a whopping 600 armor while buff stocky Rhino has less than a third of her armor. Also, I added the Hammer weapons bonus for funsies and it fits him thematically. 

  
*On Rhino Charge:*  

  
Personally I think it'd be stupid if they made Rhino Charge like Landslide because they would become exactly the same ability aside from damage type. Not unique. 
Therefore, my version of Charge is one like from many iterations of Juggernaut from any marvel games. You toggle the ability on and slowly charge forward building momentum and dealing damage with reduced steering, running everything over or sending them flying etc. Toggle off to stop charging. You can't take any action aside from steering. 
  
  
*On Iron Skin* 
  
  
I started off with that pesky cosmetic change everyone has been begging for so their Warframe doesn't look like it's covered with a poor man's condom/tin foil (same thing, golden if you are rich you primers). I think you should be able to change the color of Iron Skin. Secondly, for those of you who don't want the look of your frame covered, you can choose between Mild, Standard, and Heavy for how you want your frame to look while Iron Skin is active all changeable in the foundry for near maximum charismatic and cosmetic capabilities. Basically you can choose to have little bits of armor covering few parts of your frame, or keep it like it is and go all heavy duty. 
  
Functionally, Iron Skin like mentioned in the Dev Stream, the idea is to have it scale off enemy level so you can scale well in high level missions. You still get bonus for Power Strength and I added you get more bang for your buck if you stuck your steel fiber and that other rare mod that adds armor I can't remember its name. Secondly, I made it so you can actually choose between Ferrite or Alloy Armor depending on the color of the Iron Skin. Choose wisely. I think most people will pick Alloy.. but Ferrite has its advantages too. 
  
  
*On Roar*
  
  
Pretty simple, new crowd control ability, aoe taunt so Rhino can actually tank like he's supposed to. It literally says in his original description above, this is from DE/the Lotus in game:   Rhino is a heavily-armored Warframe (Heavily armored is 190.. what is Valkyr's 600?) with the strength and fortitude of his reckless, stampeding namesake (He might lift more but that isn't in-game, also stampede requires you to actually move and run things over. He can't do that right now, but with my change he can). Rhino trades speed for power and is designed to fill the tank role in a cell (How do you tank in a game where enemy's just shoot he first thing they see, there is no control over tanking for your team at all), with the capability to charge into the fray, draw enemy fire (can't draw enemy fire right now..), and bend the battlefield to his will through sheer brute force. Anyways, same power gain from Roar with added Taunt effect so he can actually do what he's supposed to. The only way you can draw fire in this game is if you're with 3 other lokis. 
  
  
*On Rhino Stomp*
  
  
Not many changes here, added bonus damage per armor and like mentioned in the Dev Stream, bonus damage on charge to enemies in the air. Oh, I also added armor shred so you don't HAVEEEE to run 4 CPs. 
  
  
**Conclusion**
  
  
All in all i'm bored on a sunday night writing about Rhino. People may not like the changes I put here but I think the idea of a truly heavily armoured juggernaut actually running and stampeding is pretty badass. Also he will be more useful and reclaim his place on the throne. Oh yeah.. and fill that tank role that doesn't exist in the game. 
  
  





",Warframe,[Rhino Rework],https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/3r5qc4/rhino_rework/
533,2015-11-02 00:34:36+00:00,self.heroesofthestorm,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/3r5d94/idea_for_thrall_buffs/,False,"So I've been playing Thrall recently and am really liking him. I think he's in a decent spot but by no means is top tier due to burst/lockdown on him = no hope ever. I'm having tons of fun but its really 50 50 depending on the team comp, if you are the main target even for a second you are dead. 

 I was wondering what you all think he might need?


  
  
But being able to constantly land damage keeps your health up nicely in bursts. It's really neat.
  
  


I've ran into a few problems though.. that I think should be addressed.
  
  


1. Chain Lightning. I'm loving the spell, it does decent damage has crazy far range and can proc the nice heal you need. What I DON'T like about it is how freakn random it is! I will target a minion and it will shoot out and choose to chain to the two ""useless"" walls next to the enemy's tower. Then, when I'm chasing down Valla for that last hit, I want to chain lightning her buddy and make the lightning hit her.. but no, it went for the murky bomb and Zagara minion instead. 
  
I would like for this to prioritize heroes, and then actually hit the closest two enemies not hit already. 


  
2. Mana issues. Now this would be on any character and since 2/3 Thrall's basic abilities should be used when off cooldown I understand why he shouldn't be too spammy. My problem goes back to Chain Lightning. If like most people, you spec'd into it at level 1 and 4, you can spend 40 mana using Chain Lightning and get 50 back if you play the stupid mini game of, auto attack the minion that has a blue orby thing on it. And wam bam you get a measly 10 mana yay!. Honestly, I think the talent that grants 15 mana when you proc Frostwolf Resilience should be innate, even if it costs a little bit of the hp heal for it. Thrall's waveclear forces him to use his Q AND his W just to take the wave down to 1-2 autos which is kind of sad.
  
  

3. Earthquake. Now I've picked up this ability for fun recently and got raged at. People say it sucks and it is never picked and that totally makes sense to me. It's a massive massive aoe slow, but it does not damage. It doesn't feel impactful unless you have purifier beams and phoenixs to keep your enemies in for consistent damage but why on earth (hehe) would you pick Earthquake over Sunder!. For those of you who don't know, Earthquake lasts 10 second, it pulses 3 times during this time period. Now.. what would make people pick Earthquake over Sunder when you want the damage, the stacking of his Trait, the massive aoe displacement and stun for Thrall to run up and smack people. How could earthquake be a more ideal pick? I'm not sure.. Some ideas I came up with is granting all your allies Relentless while in the slow, which would be really cool and unique yet.. maybe not that impactful and doesn't really make much sense. I don't think it should deal damage and 3 pulses wouldn't help that much for procing your trait. Any thoughts?
  
  


Just to conclude, as a Shaman of the elements, he has lightning, earth, and wind. It's debatable whether or not ""frost"" wolf counts as ice but there seems to be no fire! Maybe, since one of his Heroics is already an earth themed move, his other should be fire themed.",heroesofthestorm,Idea for Thrall Buffs?,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/3r5d94/idea_for_thrall_buffs/

[Eye Candy Imperius2] 
(http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/diablo/images/1/1a/ImperiusIngame.png/revision/latest?cb=20140918081623)
  
Hi there Reddit. This is my idea for Imperius, from the Diablo III games. He's kind of the hot headed head honcho of the Angiris Council. He made Tyrael quit and go back to ""earth"" and all this other stuff like killing 500,000,000,000,000,000+ Demons, Killing Diablo, etc etc. What you need to know is that he's the motha fukn Archangel of Valor! Best warrior there is, highest kill count known to Blizzard, been killing Demons since before everything and he's the best at it. Massive Golden Armor shining and burns the #(&amp;%# out of everything with his awesome Spear:  Solarion. Mjolnir's brother. Cause like, they were both forged in a dying star and some shit. Anyways when you play this guys he's going to be flying everywhere cause he has high as fuck movement speed cause of his wings and like he will be slashing and spearing everything he sees while everyone's eyes burn from all the bright fire he shits out of every crevice of his armor and spear in stuff. 
  
But really he's a Warrior with tons of damage. You have to be careful though, if he stays in battle too long he loses control and might start killing off the people on your team... he can go tanky for sure since that beautiful golden scion like armor makes him take less damage as he gets lower on health. When he's at 10% hp, he has a whopping 45% damage reduction! how baller is that. 
  
  
Anyways, here you go,
  
""Imperius, the archangel of Valor, is the greatest warrior in all of creation. He revels in war and combat and has led the hosts of Heaven to innumerable victories. With Malthael's absence, it is Imperius who now rules over the Angiris Council, seeking always to defend the High Heavens from any foe.""
— Selathiel, writing on Imperius
    
**Class:**  Warrior  
  
Able to take on a high damage/bruiser role, or a tankier defensive role
  
**Travel:**  Imperius is unable to mount, instead he can fly across the battlefield (3 second channeling time, 30 second cooldown). 
  
**Trait:**  *Prideful Rage*:  Imperius has no mana but instead has Rage. This is gained by dealing damage to enemy heroes. Imperius gains 1% attack speed per 1/100 rage and his basic attacks will cleave to nearby enemies (1 additional enemy per 20 rage). Rage decays over time while out of combat with enemy heroes. 
  
Upon reaching 100 rage, Imperius's trait turns into '*Hatred for Demon Blood*', entering an uncontrollable state doubling Prideful Rage's effect but Imperius will only attack the closest unit (Friend or Foe), he is unable to cast any abilities while his Rage drains down to 0 over 4 seconds. 
    
  
  
  


**Q - Solarion** - Cooldown 10 Seconds - Imperius throws his spear ahead of him, dealing moderate damage in a line and impaling the ground. Imperius can then cast Q again, if your mouse/cursor is closer to Solarion, he dash to it doing a little more damage and knocking dem peeps up for a split second.  If the mouse/cursor is closer to Imperius, he will bring the spear back to him doing some damage back. While Solarion is on the ground, Imperius has slightly reduced attack range (uses his fists). 


  
  
  
**W - Angelic Armor** - Cooldown - 12 Seconds - For every 2% of missing health, Imperius takes 1% less damage from all sources. Activate this ability to set your Armor ablaze, dealing Holy Fire damage around you for 4 seconds. 


  
  
  
**E - Wings of Valor** - Cooldown - 9 Seconds - Imperius flies forward wings ablaze and deals moderate damage in an area in front of him leaving Holy Fire on the ground dealing damage overtime and slowing enemies who walk over it, then Imperius becomes briefly untargettable and flies back to his original location. 


  
  
  
**R - Holy Fire from a Dying Star** - Cooldown: 60 Seconds - Imperius channels for one second with Solarion, then emits a massive burst of holy flame in a long cone in front of him. Imperius can be rotated slowly while casting this. This ability ignores all damage mitigation from talents and abilities. (ex: Spellshield, Hardened Shield)


  
  
  
**R - The Diamond Gates** - Cooldown: 80 Seconds - Imperius summons a version of the Diamond gates walling out any foes but allowing allies to pass through the gate.  The gate will remain until recast or destroyed. (Same hp as Tier 1 gate and wall). 


  
  
  
  


  
The idea behind Imperius is a Warrior who gets stronger and stronger as he is in battle for a longer time through his passive, though upon reaching 100 it can be dangerous to anyone around him. This promotes his theme of having a rage that Diablo points out, saying that it makes him powerful but questionable in the eyes of other Angels. In addition to this, massive gold, massive holy fire, and tons of attacks from his spear. [Eye Candy Imperius3](http://diablo.wikia.com/wiki/File:ImperiusandSolarian.png)  Holy Fire is used for a damage build in team fights where as Diamond Gates is a stronger version of Forcewall but with more than double the cooldown. 
  
**Talents:**


  
**Level 1** 
  
- *Block:*  Periodically reduces the damage received from Hero Basic Attacks by 50%. Stores up to 2 charges.  
- *Lead the Charge:*  Imperius has 3% increased movement speed for every ally hero nearby, heroes behind Imperius are granted half this bonus  
- *Seasoned Marksmen:*  For every 6 enemy Minion or captured Mercenary kills near your Hero, gain 1 Basic Attack damage. Hero Takedowns count as 3 Minion kills.  
- *Blinding Spear:* Solarion while in the ground blinds all nearby enemies.   
  
**Level 4**
  
- *Focused Assault:*  Every 10 seconds, your next Basic Attack makes you dash to the opponent and deals 75% additional damage. Basic Attacks reduce this cooldown by 1 second.  
- *Trail of Fire:*  Solarion leaves behind a line of Holy Fire dealing damage to enemies.   
- *Breakfree:*  Upon casting Angelic Armor, remove all Stuns, Roots, Blinds, Silences, and Slows from Imperius
- *Superiority:*  Reduce damage taken from Minions, Structures, and Mercenaries by 50%.  
  
**Level 7**
  
- *Battle Momentum:* Basic Attacks reduce Ability cooldowns by 0.5 seconds.  
- *Runetap:*  Every 3rd Basic Attack heals you for 3.12% of your max Health.  
- *Golden Armor:*  Angelic Armor's cooldown is reduced by 4 seconds. When Angelic Armor is on, basic attacks against Imperius during this time will set targets ablaze with Holy Fire dealing damage over 4 seconds.   
- *Wings of Light:*  Wings of Valor gains a 2nd charge.   

  
**Level 10**
  
*R - Holy Fire from a Dying Star* - Cooldown: 60 Seconds - Imperius channels for one second with Solarion, then emits a massive burst of holy flame in a long cone in front of him. Imperius can be rotated slowly while casting this. This ability ignores all damage mitigation from talents and abilities. (ex: Spellshield, Hardened Shield) lasts for 4 seconds. Can be interrupted.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLNb0Jd4_ws&amp;t=0m50s
  
*R - The Diamond Gates* - Cooldown: 80 Seconds - Imperius summons a version of the Diamond gates walling out any foes but allowing allies to pass through the gate.  The gate will remain until recast or destroyed. (Same hp as Tier 1 gate and wall).   
  
**Level 13:**  
  
- *Solarion Execution:*  Solarion does an additional 8% of the enemy's maximum health in damage to enemies hit. 
- *Burning Rage/Holy Fire:*  Deal XX damage per second to nearby enemies.  
- *Relentless Wings:*  Upon reaching the end range of Wings of Valor, Imperius can basic attack an opponent instead of flying back to his original position.   
- *Spell Shield:*  Upon taking Ability Damage, reduce that damage and further Ability Damage by 50% for 3 seconds. Can only trigger once every 30 seconds.  
  
**Level 16:**
  
- *Spear of Valor:*  After teleporting or retrieving Solarion, your next 3 Basic Attacks within 5 seconds deal 75% more damage.  
- *Holy Forged:*  All Holy Fire Imperius emits, slows enemies and does 30% more damage.   
- *Stoneskin:*  Activate to gain 30% of your maximum Health as a Shield for 5 seconds.  
- *Blood for Blood:*  Activate to deal 10% of target enemy Hero's Max Health and heal for twice that amount.  
  
**Level 20:**  
  
- *Until Ashes:*  If an enemy hero dies and was recently hit by Holy Fire from a Dying Star, 4 seconds of duration and 30% width and range are added to the casting of the ability (up to 20 seconds, 150% increased width and range) 
- *Thall Shall Not Pass:*  Diamond Gates now have the durability of a Tier 3 Gate and Wall and also spawns 2 turrets. 
- *Rivers of Blood:*  Imperius heals himself for 10% of all damage he deals. 
- *Heavenly Blades:*  Basic attacks deal 20% more damage and steal 5% movement speed. 
- *Hardened Shield:*  Activate to reduce damage taken by 75% for 4 seconds.
  
  
**-------------Now there will be tons of criticism or tons of likes. I have no idea! He may sound completely overpowered but I want to know your thoughts and feedback. **
  
**Builds**
  
  
*Auto Attack:*  Imperius can go for an Auto Attack heavy focused build, with Seasoned Marksmen, along with the Focused Assault ability which is a gap closer version of Focused Attack for sticking power,  specing into Rune Tap for sustain, or Battle Momentum for lowered cooldowns, Relentless Wings adds an additional gap closer for Auto attack builds with the level 16 Talent identical to Tyrael's, granting increased attack damage after using the Q ability. Lastly, Heavenly Blades is much like Nexus Blades but instead steals movement speed. The dangers of this build is reaching 100 Rage where you will kill everything... including your friends with no control.


  
*Tank:*  The tanky or utility build focuses around either the Level 1 Block Talent, or Lead the Charge help your team's mobility when sticking together or ganking in groups.  You will then want to head towards anything that helps Angelic Armor, then typical tanky talents like Stone Skin and Spell Shield, as well as Hardened Shield at rank 20. You will want to take the Diamond Gates ability to peel for your team or trap the enemy, similar to forcewall but with a much higher cooldown. 


  
*Holy Fire:*  I heard you liked Holy Fire? I gave you Holy Fire and added some extra Holy Fire with Holy Fire on the side.  Lastly, there is the Holy Fire build. Holy fire all stacks. This focuses on the Damage overtime effects that Imperius has and gains throughout the course of the game. While being in the thick of battles, your holy fire will always damage enemies around you. The activation of his W and E ability will start hurt enemies with Holy Fire, at Level 4 you have the option of Solarion putting down more Holy Fire, Rank 7 enemies that attack you when Angelic Armor is on will cast Holy Fire.  Rank 10, you will obviously want to take the massive flamethrower Heroic to lay down more Holy Fire then at 13 get the innate ""Burning Rage"" passive but in this case, Uther's Holy Fire passive. (Same thing pretty much). At Rank 16, your true power spike occurs causing all this Holy Fire to hit harder and even slow enemies a bit. To top it off, you'll want to choose the Until Ashes Talent. What this does is that massive fiery Holy Flamethrower you are shooting, now increases range, width, and duration if any enemies die while under the effects of Holy Fire. This makes it so that Flamethrower will grow and grow and grow as you watch Sanctuary burn.

**Wall of Text**
  
I think he needs some attention, as other frames like Excalibur, Frost, Saryin, Valkyr, etc are getting really nice changes/buffs.  
 
I want to let you know I've gone through thinking maybe a dozen different sets that REALLY varied Ash's kit, and some ways that kept most of his kit but added some neat things.   

I wanted to keep the favorite things about Ash, but also fix his gameplay, clunkiness, lack of a fun ultimate power, etc.   

My idea has settled on a rework between the Frost, and and Excal rework on terms of scale.  I believe, like DE has mentioned, that they would like all frames to be end game viable in one way or another.  Ash can fight late game, but his damage DOES fall off just like most Power Strength reliant abilities.   

Please know that like my other posts, I am very open to large amounts of criticism if you really wish. 
  

For starters, I believe we want a real Ninja frame, iconic to the theme. Secondly we would like him to scale late game. Third we would like Ash to be more fun! Not a SPAM 4 FRAME! Fourth. Hopefully Loki won't keep overshadowing Ash with superior late game aoe cc (though less damage than Blade Storm) but a much stronger invisibility.   


**Ash, lethal and elusive.**  

**can remain unseen, but his effects on the battlefield can be felt by all. Keep an eye out, Tenno.**  
  
**Health:**  150 - 150 - I believe 150 is a very nice health pool (450 at rank 30) no changes here!  
**Shield:**  100 - 100 - Same as above! healthy amount of standard tankiness  
**Armour:**  65 - 100 - I am aware the Prime version has 150. I think this can go up a little bit more, but considering he is a Ninja, perhaps not! My recommended change is for standard Ash.   
**Unique Passive:  Like a Ninja (like Frost's chance to freeze, or Excalibur's bonus damage on swords)**:  [Parkour Parkour!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GHz2bU92So)  +20% Bullet Jump, +20% Aim Glide, +20% Wall Latch.    
  
    
**Abilities**
  
   
**Shuriken**  
 
  
Ash throws 1 / 2 /3 / 4/ 5 shurikens that seek out enemies, each dealing 100 / 200 / 300 / 400 Slash damage with a 100% status chance.  Each consecutive cast will increase energy cost and shuriken amountnumber for a short period up to 5.  Thrown weapons (Kunai, Spira, Hikou, etc.) will home in on enemies recently hit by Shuriken. 

*Cost:* 10 Energy, 20, 30, 40, 50 

  
-Mostly the same when it comes to damage, bleed, pinning enemies, there are two big differences.  First, instead of two shuriken, Ash will throw 1, 2, 3, 4, then to a max of 5 Shuriken when the ability is cast in succession within 1 second.  If 5 Shuriken are thrown, the ability goes on a 5 second cooldown.  Keep in mind, Ash can use Shurikens when doing just about anything! It looks really cool when jumping or wall latching. Secondly, if a Shuriken hits an enemy who is under 5% of their maximum hp, they automatically die (not on bosses, bleed ticks cannot trigger this effect). This can be increased with Power Strength. This change is obviously for scaling, but also for hitting multiple targets. The energy cost can be hefty though but it's a very powerful ability when stacked. 
  
  
*Power Strength:*  Increased Damage
*Power Range:*  Distance of Shurikens  
*Power Duration:*  Length of time of cooldown between the 5 Shuriken toss and a recast is lowered  
  
  
  
**Smokescreen**  
  
Ash throws down a smoke bomb that staggers enemies for a short duration within a radius of 10 meters. Ash becomes untargetable for 2 / 4 / 6 / 8 seconds while nearby allies become untargetable for 1/2/3/4 seconds.   
   
*50 Energy*  
  
-So this is obviously the ability that is overshadowed by Loki due to them doing mostly the same thing but Loki's having 33% more duration (8% vs 12%). HOWEVER, Ash's staggers enemies for a brief period making sure you don't die while going invisible. There is also an augment that allows Ash to cloak his allies. My proposed change is to remove the augment and have it already a part of Ash's kit. This may sound overpowered, so to compensate I think the allies should only receive half the duration. Personally, like Shuriken I am mostly happy with this ability but it is rarely used like Lokis and is for a brief period of stealth for that one objective you need. This change will allow Ash to sup port his team in repositioning, while also freeing up the augment/mod slot.
  
  
*Power Strength:*  Nothing  
*Power Range:*  Increased distance of Smokescreen for Allies and stagger against enemies  
*Power Duration:*  Increases Duraction  
    
~~Teleport~~ **Assassinate**   
  
~~Ash teleports to a target within 20 / 45 / 45 / 60 meters.~~
  
  
*50 Energy*
  

  Ash Teleports to a target enemy within 20/35/50/65 meters and automatically performs a finisher with his custom gauntlets/daggars/katar thingys. This deals 300/600/900/1200 Finisher damage with 100% Bleed Status Chance.  This power is effected by your equipped melee weapon's mods both strength and speed wise, you can also lifestrike with the expense of energy. Enemies with less than 5% of their maximum health after the damage is dealt, are automatically executed. Works on most bosses as reduced effectiveness. Hold the 3 button down to teleport back to your original location once the finisher is completed. 

-This is basically a hybrid of the Teleport ability Ash pretty much never uses, and his Blade Storm.  The idea behind this is to automatically do the finisher to a target, lower base damage, higher scaling. The ability is still ""spammable"" but is not a press 4 to win as it is single target, and has to be aimed. Many people will disagree with this change but I think it's needed, Ash will have invincibility frames during the majority of the animation and will be able to assassinate priority targets and not just randomly teleport buggy across the battlefield. Thematically this promotes his ninja assassin theme. In terms of LoL, Loki is Evelynn and Ash is Rengar or Zed. 
  
  
*Power Strength:*  Increases Damage, Increases % health execution
*Power Range:*  Increases target range 
*Power Duration:*  Nothing
  
  
**Ultimate:  Blade Storm**
  
*Cost:* 100 or 50% of Ash's MAXIMUM Energy (Whichever cost is HIGHER)
  
For the next 3/6/9/12 Seconds, Ash activates his Warframe Ability briefly enhancing his massive and lethal killing potential.  He has increased mobility and casting speed, while his other abilities can be cast for free for the duration.  
  
Grants:  20% Bullet Jump and Bullet Jump speed, 30% movement speed, 2x faster free Handspring, 50% increased Casting Speed, (multiplicative with Natural Talent so it'd be 75%?)  and has heatseeking vision so that he can see, and target enemies with Assassinate.  Shuriken has no 5 second cooldown after hitting the cap, reaching the 5 shuriken cap will reset it to 1.  
  
So for starters, maybe this ability isn't scaled right? for the energy cost I wanted lower level people, or those with a small energy reserve to still have to spent a good amount of energy, but still make it so Primed Flow won't be exploited. The target area for Blade Storm is much bigger during this so you don't have to aim it perfectly while this ability is active.  The idea is to still be a storm of blades but you having to be hyperactive during this power spiked time period. Spamming 1 while bullet jump and running and between your assassinates, you want to hit as many people as possible. This will be a very high skill cap ability because you will be given a small time frame to do as many things as possible, you may move faster than you can handle, and you aren't invincible! But you will definitely be a storm of blades with shurikens flying from every direction like a smokey tornado while you dart and bullet jump across the battlefield looking who to cast assassinate on.  
  
I think this ability will retain the sort of Blade Storm feel but forces the player to be more involved.  You will be hitting less targets since Assassinate is single target, but the spamming of free 12345 shurikens should make up for this, while the late game scaling damage does as well. The idea is to Bladestorm/Smokescreen, then bullet jump and spam the 1 button while aiming with the 3 button. 
  
*Power Strength:*  Increases Casting Speed and all Animation speeds
*Power Duration:*  Increases Duration
*Power Range:*  Increases Heatseeking sight range
*Power Efficiency:*  Lowers Energy cost


  
 
  
To conclude, i wanted Ash to be a more fun, ninja like, scaling Warframe who still dashes across the battlefield killing things, but not a press 4 to win frame.

Hopefully it will more match the theme of each Syndicate though I am personally opposed to the Boltace for the Arbiters of Hexuis, mainly due to the fact that their sigil and all their sigils are swords not tonfa..

Include the other ""syndicates"" that need rep like Simarus and Tehshin and.. well maybe even Darvo even though he doesn't have rep.

Here are mine:

Other Stuff (special effects, note all weapons can now kit multiple targets :

Rakta Kronen: Much more range, Bleeds do 50% more damage

Telos Dark Sword: Slam Attack can be charged mid air (like air glide kinda) increasing damage and radius (very long ending animation, to pull sword out of ground) when sword is pulled out, aoe is done once again for half damage (same status)

Synoid Plasma Sword: Destroying an enemy's shields will do that damage to nearby enemies (much like a single target Mag Shield Polarize) Blocking will steal shields from opponents

Vaykor Jat Kittag: Note, has added blast element for blast procs yay!, attacking with jump will super launch player cause rocket engines, Slam attack converts 100% of damage to Blast

Santi Kestrel: What's better than one boomerang? two boomerangs?? NOPE. You now have THREE BOOMERANGS. Hence the ""decrease"" in attack speed. (Almost like Draven from LoL, only two boomerangs can be in flight at any given time so the third, mounted on your lower back will be used as a melee weapon while the others are flying)

Secura Lecta: Half the damage, double the attack speed, massively increased range (farther than orthos) bodies hit by the Secura Lecta basically turn the bodies into Shock Traps until the body decays

Dual Nikana: Can someone say berserker???!!! probably a custom stance, movement is not hindered with any combos.

1. Do stance multiplies exist for Melee? ex:  Crimson Dervish attacks do 300% damage? or is every stroke of the sword?

3. How much damage do some abilities do? It says on the wiki Ash's bladestorm can only be used with 10m in PVP, but it says nothing about the damage. APPARENTLY it's the damage for a rank 0 frame but that would still be 780 Finisher damage (insta one hit on anyone) in PVP but i know for a fact this isn't the case..



4. Do arcanes work? i heard things like warmth work against Frost's freeze in PVP.. 



5. It says on the wiki slide attacks do the same damage as the weapon, what about slam and jump attacks? 



6. It seems to be Puncture damage is favored since all Tenno have Armor. But since there is NO armor shred in the game, doesn't that mean Slash is the worst considering you will never ACTUALLY hit FLESH? Impact being good against high Shielded targets like frost? all these damage converter mods and I just don't see the point in using slash at all.

Anyways I was fiddling with Pantheon ideas since I love the idea of a Greek-like soldier who can be identified similarly to Spartans. Not quite a gladiator, but not all heavy on the armor.
 
**Here’s my rework! **
 
 
Pantheon:

*Stats*

 
Attack Range:  150 - 175

*Passive:  ***Determination of Targon**
 
**Description**

Pantheon has been trained in the art of war, not letting any maim hinder his movement.  Crowd Control effects against Pantheon happen at a delayed time applying any debuffs to Pantheon .25/.5/.75/1 second later. (This does not work for CC that cannot be reduced by Tenacity.) During this one second Pantheon gains 30% movement speed that quickly decays over 1 second.
 
*Passive: (cause one isn’t enough) Certain Death:
 
Pantheon has a 100% crit chance with all attacks and abilities against opponents under 15% maximum health.
 
 
*Q  -  ****Spear Shot***


*Stats*


Cooldown:  4 seconds
 Range – 800/900/1000/1100/1200
Damage:  60/110/160/210/260 + 150% of Bonus AD + Shreds 6/7/8/9/10% of the enemy's armor for 5 seconds. *can stack*
Skill shot (area)
 
**Description**

Pantheon hurls a spear to target location dealing physical damage to all enemies in 225 range (25 smaller than a Leona epicenter ult, NOT a passthrough, just a mini aoe, think karthus q with travel time).  If this hits an enemy champion, the spear will reside in them for 2.5 seconds, stealing 3/6/9/12/15% movement speed over time.  Pantheon’s next auto attack against that target has 125 range, if he auto attacks his enemy champion during this movement steal time his auto attack animation is reset and the next auto attack will have 175 range (regaining his spear), the cooldown to Spear Shot will also be reduced by 1 second. 
 
 
*W – ****Shield Bash/Targon Kick***


 *Stats*


Cooldown 13 seconds
Range – 600 (Shield Bash:  enemy is 300-600 range away. Targon Kick: enemy is 0-300 range away)  
Damage – 75/125/175/225/275 + 50% of Pantheon’s armor as physical damage.
Targetted (point and click)
Stun duration - .6/.7/.8/.9/1 second

***Description**
 
Pantheon leaps toward target opponent bashing them with his shield stunning him and dealing physical damage that hits harder depending on Pantheon’s armor.  If the target is too close, he will instead kick his opponent stunning them and kicking them away 450 range. 


*E - ***Fight in the Shade***

*Stats*


Cooldown - 2 seconds
Damage Reduction - 4/7/10/13/16%
Damage Reduction - 4/8/12/16/20 damage from auto attacks 


***Description**

Pantheon repositions his shield in target direction, reducing damage from targets the shield is facing. (this aims like a short short ranged skill shot, pantheon will keep his shield in the direction cast according to his model/the way he is facing and takes reduced damage from that direction, like Braum Shield. Fight in the Shade has a 4 second cooldown if Pantheon has recently taken damage from an enemy champion. 

*R - ****Grand Sky Fall***


Same as live, deals true damage to monsters. 



**Gameplay/The kit**


For starters, I didn't want to make Pantheon a point and click champ with that 0 counterplay spear in the top lane.  I wanted him to still fall off late game and switch roles to a tankier role, but I wanted to maintain his assassination potential early - mid on to help carry his team to success. 


*Passive* 

His passive is something I really like, it lets Pantheon the chance to maybe get one last spear in or move just a little bit further before any crowd control takes place. Just for clarification, what his passive does is if he is crowd controlled (soft not hard, that's what she said) the crowd control will take place 1 second later than intended.  So if you get Alistar knocked up, or knocked back, the effect is the same no changes, however if it is a Slow, a Stun, a Silence, a Snare, a Blind (etc. things that can be reduced by tenacity) it will be delayed. For example, if you are chasing a Morgana down and she throws her snare out, for one whole second you won't be snared, then you'll be snared for the full duration of her Dark Binding. However, Alistar's Headbutt does technically stun Pantheon during the knock back, so Pantheon will still gain the burst of movement speed he needs to chase targets down.

*Q* 

I changed this so he is more of a spear launching champion who can poke and harass but only if have the skill. None of this point click stuff (cause I'm riot ya) So to start off, the Nidalee spear range is 1500, the spear range goes from 700 - 1100 depending on the rank. Allowing him to transition through the laning phase with safer last hitting if fallen behind but also poke potential.  For comparison sake, Nidalee Spear is 1500, Jayce Q is 1050/1470. The difference is it can't be minion blocked, but has travel time and the ""aoe"" range of almost a Leona ult. So attacking non-moving targets is easy, letting last hitting from a range give him safety, but to harass his opponent Pantheon players need to aim their spear well very similarly to a Karthus Q. For comparison sake, it is between a Karthus Q and Leona aoe range, at 225. The hard thing to pull off is it's not nearly as spammable as the Karthus Q, and it also has travel time, but it deals a very good amount of damage. This of course separates the good Pantheon players from the great. More counterplay, higher risk, more damage, higher reward. Also during sieges and skirmishes it grants Pantheon the ability to poke. Travel time varies depending on range.

Now I wanted to keep Shield Bash and increase its damage if Pantheon builds armor. In return it has a lower stun duration until rank 5, but also has a much higher cooldown. The addition is to supplement Pantheon's peel potential in case he wishes to not dive the back lines and instead help his ADC ""fight in the shade"". I added the Targon Kick (spin on Spartan Kick) for a knockback. For comparison sake, Alistar W is 650 range, Targon kick is 450 range (still less than adc range) but good enough. Overall probably a buff to the damage/utility, but with much less up time. 13/12/11/10/9 second cooldown on live, 13 second flat on change. If you kick them into a wall (almost!) then it's similar to the Alistar Headbutt where they still consider traveling farther. Some random neat thing you can do if the opponent IS against the wall (that's what she said) you can kick them over sometimes...

This is the biggest change I think to Pantheon's kit though you can debate on the Q change.  As a tradeoff for losing an entire damage spell (heartseeker strike) as well as the free auto attack block every once in a while, Pantheon instead has damage reduction.  This isn't a raw buff however as the trick to using this spell is aiming it in the right direction. With Braum, if he casts it in the wrong direction then he still takes full damage from attacks when his Shield is up.  Pantheon's shield is much smaller than this but can be cast in 8+ directions! if you place it right though you can take a TON of reduced damage. Engaging on an opponent? obviously shield up front, but remember if you change your mind you can't move your shield to your back and run right away! in the laning phase running back and forth means you will expose yourself to harass from your opponent, so place your shield correctly and click in the right direction before taking damage, to mitigate that as much as possible. On paper, the stat damage reduction is massive, but it has play around that i think is meaningful in and outside the laning phase. but yes! it works on turrets!

The only change to this is to enhance his Baron/Dragon steal potential as it changes it to true damage so if timed properly, you can compete with Smite, Cho'gath, Nunu, etc.
