175,"Jep. You can continue the pattern like this.
You have to change the numbers.
Just change the number at the end of the line to the following number. And the last line must continue to the first line.
It's actually pretty simple.

Example:

    alias Tag1 ""cl_clanid #####; alias TagBind Tag2;""
    alias Tag2 ""cl_clanid #####; alias TagBind Tag3;""
    [...]
    alias Tag1000 ""cl_clanid #####; alias TagBind Tag1001;""
    [...]
    alias Tag8999 ""cl_clanid #####; alias TagBind Tag9000;""
    alias Tag9000 ""cl_clanid #####; alias TagBind Tag9001;""
    alias Tag9001 ""cl_clanid #####; alias TagBind Tag1;""

The **FAT** text at the end of the line must match the beginning of the next line.      
                                
alias Tag8999 ""cl_clanid #####; alias TagBind **Tag9000**;""

alias **Tag9000** ""cl_clanid #####; alias TagBind Tag9001;""
