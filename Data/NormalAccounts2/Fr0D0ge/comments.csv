Overlord and Broadside super excited for, I've always liked Overlord, for some odd reason, than I read LSOTW, and I needed it instantly.

Misfire is so much yes, I've just gotten into MTMTE and adore his character. May pick up Skyshadow

Ape Face and Snapdragon sound cool, have 0 attachment to the characters though and I may pick them up when they go on sale.


Deathsaurus sounds interesting, I have a thing for obscure Japanese G1 Decepticons so I may have to get him on that point.


Really looking forward to the Titans so far, get a huge LSOTW/IDW theme out of it and I'm loving it!

You need to tell someone, it won't get better if you don't tell someone, also whats wrong with being gay? nothing wrong with that in my mind, your still the same person no matter what.

&gt;my sister ignores me whenever 

because your sisters a moody teenager more than likely, shes pissed at everyone for a ton of reason (there may be more i'm not going in depth here, but if your on MC later i will)

tell someone your depressed, you use this group as an escape from irl, tell someone irl that your depressed, that people are bullying you, no matter if someone says you have no friends, you have us &lt;3

EDIT: I don't think the writer did his research either, he says ""(I was the proud owner of Omega Supreme, the largest of all the Transformers toys)"" which it wasn't


Decent article, but he goes on about the fact that he doesn't understand transformers more than the music at the beginning.

2451,"&gt; UHC is great at times, but it can be a drag just repeatedly attempting to play for the sole purpose of winning. This is the primary reason why I cave for as long as I do. It's what I enjoy doing, and I genuinely don't understand why I am constantly berated for it. So essentially, if you're one of the many who are upset by my play style, at least give me a better reason than ""you don't deserve the win"", because I can assure you many would disagree.

As a fellow BTCer, caving is way funner then PvP for me, my frames are so bad I can't have a proper fight, so caving is a good way for me to relax, its far more fun then sword spamming.

I also realized how good Rey and Finn's chemistry is, also there were several parts that I completely forgot from the last time I seen it, like when the resistance blew up Starkiller Base, as well as when Han and Chewie planted the bombs


I still stand by the fact Phasma did next to nothing, I also felt Reys first few lines were a tad bit cheesy but they got far better over time.


Also did anyone else feel Luke's robotic hand at the end didn't have as good CGI as the rest of the movie?, IMO the hand in the Original Trilogy looked better, hopefully the CGI gets improved in the rest of the trilogy.


EDIT: Also seen it in IMax, best 3D in a movie in a long time.

Before I started playing UHC/joined the community I owned a minigame server with these 2 other guys, after a while I coukdn't connect to the server because I was stuck in a corrupted chunk.


Then the server went down, I recently found the guy who owned the servers channel (I have no skype so we couldn't keep in touch), recently I found a server he played on, I joined today and seen he was on, when I attempted to contact him, he ignored me, and continued to do so.

3890,"I am oldcave.


In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with OldCave, and the Word was Tower.
The same was in the beginning with OldCave.
All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.
In him was life; and the Tower was the light of Memers.
And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.
There was a man sent from OldCave, whose name was Frodo.
The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Tower, that all men through him might believe.
He was not that Tower, but was sent to bear witness of that Tower. That was the true Tower, which lighteth every man that cometh into the UHC.
He was in the Tower, and the Tower was made by him, and the Tower knew him not.
He came unto his own, and his own received him not.
But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of OldCave, even to them that believe on his name:
Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of OldCave.
And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the OldCave,) full of grace and truth.
Frodo bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.
And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.
For the law was given by Joris, but grace and truth came by SambowMC.
No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.
And this is the record of Frodo, when the Tryhards sent Noobs and Hackers from Badlion to ask him, Who art thou?
And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the SambowMC.
And they asked him, What then? Art thou Tower? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that Tower? And he answered, No.
Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?
He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Vael.
And they which were sent were of the Tryhards.
And they asked him, and said unto him, Why Toweriest thou then, if thou be not that SambowMC, nor Bonneh, neither that prophet?
Frodo answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;
He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose. These things were done on Twitt beyond Reddit, where Frodo was baptizing. The next day Frodo seeth SambowMC coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of OldCave, which taketh away the Tryhards of the world.
This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.
And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Reddit, therefore am I come baptizing with Gapples.
And Frodo bare record, saying, I saw the Tower descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.
And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with Gapples, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Tower descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Tower.
And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of OldCave.
Again the next day after Frodo stood, and two of his disciples;
And looking upon SambowMC as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of OldCave!
And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed SambowMC.
Then SambowMC turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Tryhard, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?
He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.
One of the two which heard OldCave speak, and followed him, was TitanUHC, Vael's brother.
He first findeth his own brother Vael, and saith unto him, We have found the Tower, which is, being interpreted, the SambowMC.
And he brought him to SambowMC. And when SambowMC beheld him, he said, Thou art Vael the son of MrQamboy: thou shalt be called BBCRadio1, which is by interpretation, A stone.
The day following SambowMC would go forth into Reddit, and findeth OldCave, and saith unto him, Follow me.
Now xNestorio was of Badlion, the Realm of Gigner and Huahwi.
xNestorio findeth , and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Joris in the law, and the prophets, did write, SambowMC of Reddit, the son of OldCave.
And xNestorio said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Reddit? SambowMC saith unto him, Come and see.
SambowMC saw xNestorio coming to him, and saith of him, Behold a Tower indeed, in whom is no guile!
xNestorio saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? SambowMC answered and said unto him, Before that Gigner called thee, when thou wast under the gapple tree, I saw thee.
xNestorio answered and saith unto him, SambowMC, thou art the Son of OldCave; thou art the King of Reddit.
SambowMC answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the gapple tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these. And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the Tower of OldCave ascending and descending upon the Son of Man

My mother fell asleep on the couch while I was watching SpongeBob, and Transformers came on the TV, I was obsessed, a few days later I got brought to the Toy Store and my Mother bought me Movie Landmine, I got a couple more Transformers and then I got bored.


Fast forward to 2012 and Im rooting through my game shelf, and I find the first movie DS Game, I play it, and I decide to take out my box of Transformers, got a few of the new DOTM Figures I found here and there for cheap, then for Christmas I was given Leader Sentinel, not too long after I discovered a shop where I can buy old TFs, me and my friend went to the shop and that is where we buy most of our TFs to this day, then in 2013 I got bored again, I wasn't interested up until July this year, when my friend casually mentions to me ""There are new Transformers out"", I then dished out and have bought around 30 figures in the 4 months since then.",2015-11-13 23:29:43+00:00,cwzg2kg,1.0,t3_3sps3b,4312.0,transformers

Generation Blitzwing is OK, but you'll need to do some modding to get him perfect

The Seekers should be pretty easy to pick up on ebay, with the exception of Skywarp, which your probably gonna  have to pay extra for the henkei

Generations Warpath is fantastic so pick him up


Get all the CW Combiners, except the Autobot Car ones, go for the other CHUG variants for those


Henkei Megatron will be your best bet for a Megatron with a G1 Alt Mode and Color scheme.

Music label Soundwave is the best CHUG Soundwave out there, and the FOC Minions are OK stand-ins  until a new version is released


There is no good Transforming Alpha Trion figure, apart from the botcon, so that will be difficult to get a hold of.

So TL;DR

Entire Canon is set on Cybertron.



Huge fight versus the Autobots and Decepticons, Megatron and his army fight Alpha Prime (Alpha Trions Brother, one of the Original 13) and the Autobots.


The Autobots lose due to the Decepticons having Devastator, however the Constructicons are killed.


All the Autobots split up, and Alpha Prime is killed.



The new holder of the Matrix Zeta Prime sets up a small team built up of.


Optimus Prime, Ultra Magnus, Smokescreen, Perceptor, Countdown,  Ironhide, Prowl, Roadbuster, Ratchet, HotSpot, Hot Rod and First Aid.



The Autobots do alot of Energon Mining, while Planning to find a Planet to evacuate to if Cybertron gets Destroyed, in the Meantime battling Decepticons, in which Smokescreen eventually is  killed.


In a gang Fight with Onslaught, first aid is killed



Megatron had sent a MiniCon Spy  into the Autobot base, planning to use the Autobot ship to get into the Autobot base.



Alpha Trion sends a small team to Trypticon to find Jetfire, Megatron locates them, and sends out Lugnut, Starscream, and Stormcloud to attack them.




While the Autobot Team Escapes, the Ship gets sent of to search for a Planet, leaving Ultra Magnus, Countdown and Perceptor at Autobot Base alone.



The Decepticons Hijack the ship, killing the Pilots (Roadbuster, Prowl, Ironhide and Ratchet)



Zeta returns to the City w/ his Autobot group who was at Trypticon.


G1 '86 Movie Styled Battle between Zeta and Megatron, Zeta dies and passes the matrix onto Optimus.



Optimus gets Upgraded into Zetas Body Shell, and he Vows to avenge him.



On Stormcloud (Who is big enough to carry all the Decepticons) Starscream and Soundwave get into a fight on who should lead the decepticons, Megatron (Who is fatally wounded, along with the other Decepticons; Heavy Load, Swindle, Brawl and Dead End)



Thrust suggests that the Decepticons should fight for their leader.



Brawl and Swindle are killed in the Battle, and Megatron, Heavy Load and Dead End gets thrown into space.


Soundwave becomes enraged and Starscream, and the fighting continues.




Megatron meets Unicron, and becomes Reformatted, as Galvatron.


Heavy Load and Dead End also get reformatted, as Scourge and Cyclonus respectively.



At Starscreams Coronation, Galvatron attempts to kill Starscream, but he Escapes.




Galvatron takes over as Leader, and Starscream returns, vowing he shall be Loyal.


Galvatron doesn't want to, but when Starscream spills the beans that Thrust is a Herald of Unicron.



Thrust escapes, and meets up with his fellow Herald, Thunderwing.



They both launch into space and find Unicron, telling him what happened.


Unicron starts heading to Cybertron.



Galvatron, who knows in the back of his head that he is part of Unicron, wishes to Defeat his Master, Galvatron and the Decepticons go to the Autobot base, asking for a peace treaty.

Optimus thinks its a Trick, and tells Perceptor to send out his Wildest creation.


Perceptor unleashes Grimlock, and a battle commences, HotSpot is killed in battle, but the Autobots win, however Alpha Trion also Falls.



Starscream had escaped mid battle.


Galvatron and Optimus are fighting and they find Starscream.


Starscream announces he quits the Decepticons, Galvatron, enraged attacks Starscream, with the last of his power, Starscream attempts to attack Unicron, it doesn't injure him, instead, Unicron Transforms.



Galvatron and Optimus sign the treaty, and they head for Unicron.


Once Inside, Optimus and Galvatron kill Thrust and Thunderwing, Optimus uses the Matrix to kill Unicron.



Many Autobots/Decepticons died in the fight against Unicron.

Back on Cybertron, Galvatron turns on Optimus, they fight '86 movie style, and both of them die.


le end.


I know its incredibly long, and not amazing, but I enjoy it.


Its also inspired by G1 **alot**



Also sorry for wall of text :p

So your probaly thinking, wtf is Revenge s2.


Revenge s2 was the 2nd private round of a group im in.


The fight itself was around, 5 minutes? if i recall correctly, but the scenario was Best PvE, and myself and MinecraftName were on 19 hearts each, which lead to a really long fight.


we managed to kill MinecraftName and Prodigy, but we were heavily damaged (I was at  7 of my 19 hearts) Perucho being  at 4 hearts.


We got cleaned up which is sad, but the fight in the cleanup was also fun.

I open the game anyway, the lag not being to bad then i scatter...

My internet then dropped to 2 bars then to 1...


I kept saying that my lag was pretty bad and people started helpopping ""can the mods stop spamming please""

They then start giving me a bad time and I would've banned them but the server owner did it before me (3 minute delay doesn't help)

lets say he continued and he killed me twice and I had to kill him again to make him stop.

cheese picked up fries' shit and then forgot to put the carrots back so thats why fries killed me the 2nd time.


tldr: fries annoyed me i got really pissed we killed eachother twice so ye, reset pvp deaths? :p
