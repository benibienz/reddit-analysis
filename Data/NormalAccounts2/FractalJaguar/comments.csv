MMA might well be more appealing to 'casuals' if they see it as a credible sport and not just a money grabbing business. It'll probably never change due to the virtue of the promoter controlling the matchups, but regarding McGregor vs Alvarez.. i just think it is terrible. I feel for Aldo. It wouldn't be so frustrating if it weren't for bloody Dana White and his lies!!

More than anything, I want MMA to grow as a sport and become more mainstream. So I certainly take your point. I just don't firmly agree that you get long term gain for the sport by constantly focusing on short term gain for the business. And that is what is tricky to predict or analyse.

Decades from now I think MMA could replace boxing as the main combat sport; the one that everyone is aware of outside of Asia, basically, where Muay Thai, kungfu, etc are of course very well known. But even in Asia/Indonesia, boxing is well known. Pacquiao would be a prime example of a popular fighter there.

Imagine MMA in the Olympics? Imagine seeing MMA results on the back of the newspaper instead of tucked in pages behind, if indeed the  event is reported as well.

Can I watch the VOD on Twitch? I'll have a look. At the end of teh day though, don't sweat it - just having someone stream and cast these tournaments is a big thing. Nobody's expecting professional quality stuff, and you'll get better at it if you put in some time and take on board feedback. I got a lot of positive feedback and suggestions, and I'm trying to practise those.

Also, if you have an hour or three to stream, just go on Twitch and put 'Casting random duels' or 'Casting 2v2 games' as the title, shout about it in Discord/forums/subreddit, and have at it. Even if people aren't watching, just pretend like they are. A few people might well tune in anyway.

That's what I intend to do anyway, as soon as I get a suitable time slot.

129,"I'm not advocating - upon first reading Ramagan's post I thought 'yes, makes a lot of sense', and replied. Then i checked the comments here and noticed others were disagreeing, and i thought about it some more, realised there pros and cons and that it wasn't a simple issue. Things change. So far the only thing I've truly advocated or asked for (in the forums) is an experimental ruleset to try out some changes.

And I think that 'casuals' would make up the vast majority of the playerbase. Hence why the devs might want to cater to that kind of player, rather than the minority who duel competitively. Of course you don't design a game around a small minority of players. You try and appeal to the masses. The devs might be able to cater to and satisfy both casual players who just want to FFA, and those who want to 1v1 and compete and put a lot of hours into it. I hope they do!

I'm pretty sure a lot of people would infer the same kind of tone from your words as I have done. You made a few assumptions about me. I'll happily talk about game design and weapon balance for hours and we'll probably disagree on various points and that's all good man. There's a difference between disagreeing about something, and making assumptions and condescending remarks (""This is good example why people without deep understanding of game mechanics and vast experience in FPS games should not even think about balancing something as complex as weapon balance"") whilst discussing/arguing ab out something.

But whatever dude, it's all good. You set up two FFA servers which I greatly appreciate, and have told you as much in-game. You did that for the good of the community, and I respect that. I too, have set up a gameserver and when I figure out how to set up multiple gameservers on the same box, there'll be a few more!",2016-08-04 21:04:28+00:00,d64gx7q,7.0,t1_d64fmg4,1661.0,reflex
130,"Jesus dude, it feels like you're being kinda hostile. I'm not advocating one way or the other really, I'm just discussing it. I've made points (both here, and in the forums), arguing both ways. You quoted me saying it is fun to one shot people with a hammer, and then say ""you want to get rid of it"", which I did not say.

And for the record, I played a lot of Q2 &amp; Q3. Fun times. Not played Warsow. So, be careful with your assumptions...

I'm not saying I have a deep understanding of game mechanics, but I have a fair bit of experience, and I'm reasonably intelligent, and I've actually studied game design and write code etc. I'm aware that weapon balance is a complicated issue regarding game design. Changing it is not to be done lightly, but that's not to say it shouldn't be done. Especially in early access. Get it 'right' now, to the satisfaction of all types of player, and that's the end of it.

It strikes me that the devs will have to make a decision as to who they want to cater to - competitive players, or casuals. It may be too much work for them to cater to both, although rulesets should help a lot. It has got to be fun. But satisfying competitive players would be good for the competitive scene and that in of itself could get positive exposure for the game.

169,"* Do not enter a confrontation that you are not likely to win, but balance that with not running away and conveying that you are low on health and armour and thus an easy kill. I've read elsewhere that you should deal damage at every opportunity. But perhaps don't do that, if it is especially risky. I would argue that you should move and jump around to make the odds more in your favour. Get positional advantage, like in chess or an RTS game. If you do not have armour, and particularly if you know the item control situation so you know what armour they are likely to have, do not engage. Evade, by stealthy, try and win the red armour when it respawns. Or go for yellow. Don't go for armour or megahealth without a weapon.

* Practice movement and aim. Learn the maps, including the jumps and the key routes.

* Try and chill, relax, enjoy it. Don't get tense, it will ruin your enjoyment of the game and hold you back. Pro athletes are normally quite relaxed when doing their thing. Get comfy!

* Be unpredictable. This is a big one. Mix it up. Surprise them with aggression, then evade them with stealth.

I think in an FFA game, a map that is too small for that number of players is a bad thing. Maps should be designed for a purpose and if it doesn't have enough spawn points, enough weapons, enough health packs, it is just a frustrating experience for most and it basically boils down to whoever spawns next to the best weapons and armour will probably win, or at least it will randomise the skill levels too much. Too much random chance, I don't like that.

197,"I feel pretty powerful when I pick up the RL in Reflex, probably the weapon I am most effective with. And yes, it /is/ part of the game, I understand that. The random element and fast pace will dictate that that happens. I think the reason it seems to be happening a lot is simply due to the maps (e.g. not enough large FFA maps designed for 8+ players). So, I'm very confident more maps will come out and by the time the game is released, it will be in a great state. Frankly, to me, it already is in a great state.

I have thought that the weapons in Reflex are perhaps, across the bar, a bit too powerful. Dropping the damage 10% on all weapons might help. The weapon stats will probably be tweaked over time anyway. I think they're going for 'each weapon has a best case use scenario, and if used that way, is as powerful as the other weapons'. If you've got great aim and tracking the ion cannon is your friend, if you've got great flick shots you can railgun/bolt rifle for days, if you're great at movement and getting in close and hopping out unpredictable you'll probably be great with the shotgun/melee, etc.

What are bskins? And what do you want to be 'fixed' regarding weapons?",2016-07-26 22:38:48+00:00,d5s5n3i,2.0,t1_d5rwx22,10639.0,reflex

We're talking genius, or at least, exceptional skill, on a level that incredibly few people will possess. It is hard to explain why a mathematical problem is hard because you'll need to understand all of the layers of mathematics just to get a grip on the problem.

&gt;* Include config options or break up your mods into more parts so pack makers can pick and choose what they &gt;like. Don't impose your vision on a whole modpack unless you're Greg or Reika and can really offer enough &gt;content &gt;to justify it to a core userbase.
&gt;* Add downsides and obstacles to your mod, and ways to overcome them. Minecraft has some key obstacles like &gt;needing food, needing to smelt ores, limited item durability, etc that define it as a game. I think people overlook &gt;that. Many mods only seek to overcome these, without adding anything new of their own. If you look at the best mods, they all create new obstacles.

Certainly when I trained in judo, there was more focus on the throwing and grappling than submissions. Which reminds me of another difference, in judo you can also win by pinning your opponent down for about 7 seconds or so (maybe 10?). Which again detracts from the value of submissions in judo.

The key difference I think is that an MMA fighter trained in judo will be very quick and instinctively capitalise on opportunities for a takedown.

Once you've got that down load/make a palette, and do basic iteration based escape value to pick a colour from the palette.

Then use SDL or some other API to render to a window instead of a file.

I cannot emphasise enough how much I appreciate it when a mod author implements documentation in the form of an in-game book. It makes learning the mod so much easier and far more immersive.

I cannot stand trawling the web for wikis, tutorials, guides, and videos in order to learn a mod. It completely destroys the immersion and the gameplay, imho. I still do it, as often it is the only way to learn a mod that is well worth learning.

362,"I don't know whether she is or not, it is just a guess/hunch. My reasons for thinking she might be done compared to other champions coming off a loss:

* plenty of evidence of her being emotionally unstable
* sticking with Edmond/gym
* and thus not training with other champions (look at Jackson-Winklejohn for instance)
* film career commitments interfering with her training
* she couldn't eat an apple for 3-6months after Holm's kick to her head. That isn't just a regular loss, that's a massive shake-up to her confidence and self-belief.. you've got to have a very strong character to survive that and bounce back. GSP did it. I don't think Rousey is that calibre.
* Perhaps the most dominant female MMA fighter so far but I'm not sure about GOAT..

I /want/ her to bounce back and I want to see her throw women around the Octagon with her excellent judo and armbar her opponents left right and centre. It was spectactular to watch. But I also don't want her spouting ridiculous trash talk like before, case in point: ""I believe I can beat anyone in my division with one hand.""

Conor won the belt from Aldo without fighting Edgar (who I don't know well but was considered the #1 or #2 contender, I think). So that needs to happen, but....

Aldo was perhaps the most dominant champ the UFC has ever had. The pound for pound king, perhaps shared with JBJ and MM. 10 years undefeated, lost because he threw an overly aggressive cross (probably because he was emotional from the trash talking!). He needs an instant rematch for that; as soon as he is ready to fight again (he was KO'd, I don't know when he was medically advised to train and fight again. I should look that up).

407,"I enjoy training in MMA because of the sound that I make when I hit the pads or the bag juuuust right. I love hearing my coach praise me, even if he just says ""good"" after landing a good combo doing padwork. I love light sparring when I try a technique and land it, like when I was in the clinch the other day and I jumped to get my feet into a tai-otoshi (judo throw) stance and took the guy down to the ground. I love the sound of throwing someone square onto their back onto the mats, and occasionally seeing their stunned expression.

And I love the camaraderie of the people in my club, the laughter, the jokes. Discussing the last UFC fight. The social side of it is a big part of why I train, I think.

And I enjoy the mental and emotional aspects. Being calm whilst fighting, strategy, countering someone's style, the science of fighting is deep and fascinating to me.

And watching MMA? I love the fighters and how hard they train. I think they're some of the most elite athletes from any sport. I love the personalities, even the ones I hate. Characters like Conor McGregor, GSP, Johnson, Jones. They're all different. I love that Johnson streams gameplay on Twitch! I love it when Bruce Buffer shouts ""IT. IS. TIIIIIIIIME."" I love the walkouts, the hat stealing, the intro music, the coaches advice between rounds.

I love the purity of one on one combat. It's the same as chess or go. The strategy and the physicality combined. The execution of a perfect gameplan like Holm vs Rousey.

I think the side kick is a highly under used weapon in MMA, but Wonderboy telegraphs it by bouncing around in that extremely side-on stance. So his opponent knows it is coming, but Wonderboy seems to kick fast enough for them to not be able to defend. Effective lateral movement could be a good counter to it, but I think if you [pivoted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5rtp8guIZo) quickly (when you see them moving to one side) you could defend.

Although arguably in the side on stance your putting your weight on (mostly) your back foot, pivoting would require (most of) your weight on your front foot. But probably easy enough to shift it.

I am going to experiment!

414,"Aldo absolutely deserves an instant rematch, considering his absolutely amazing record. Lately I have felt frustrated with the UFC operating first and foremost as a company and not as a champion of the sport of mixed martial arts. They make so many decisions as a business and although that is understandable, of course (they ARE a business), I really feel that it holds back the sport.

Correct me if I'm wrong but you don't get this kind of nonsense in other sports. Soccer, football, basketball, baseball, tennis. You win, you progress to the next round. There's an entire system dictating what happens next.

The UFC always had issues with Aldo, particularly Dana White I think, so it seems like they just threw Aldo away after his loss to McGregor and focused all their attention in turning McGregor into the next cash cow.

Conor McGregor is paving his path into the future and he deserves it - he's on a winning streak, he's quite the character, and he's focusing a lot of attention onto MMA as a whole. Besides that, he is bringing new fans to the sport. A whole country, almost!

I want to see a Rousey v Holm rematch but I was very glad that they gave Holly the fight against Miesha. The fact that they were even considering holding her back until Rousey could fight again was shocking and is further evidence that the UFC is holding back the sport. Rousey will probably come back and when she does, it will be fascinating to see if she has come back better than ever, or if Holm just wrecks her again. My money is on the latter outcome.

JJ definitely deserves his rematch, and Cruz imho is a superior fighter to Dillashaw, so you have my full agreement there!",2016-02-05 13:25:43+00:00,czorr32,2.0,t1_cznq80z,72508.0,MMA

Most of it takes care of itself and we've found that adding certain mods can help solve any compatibility issues.

The trade system in particular, coupled with the Vending mod, is very nice indeed. Some sort of economy system to make it harder would be really neat. At the moment I've planted about 200 TiC slimetrees and periodically harvest the slime, craft to slimeballs, and sell the slimeballs to the silly, silly merchants. Profit! Then to the vending machines!

It is tough but I'm sure you can do it. Get the help that is available to you (psychological therapy, perhaps medication), find a good gym/coach, and try and attend regularly. If you skip a session don't beat yourself up about it. Set a schedule that you think you can easily manage, like one session a week. If you go twice one week, that's awesome. Don't give yourself a hard time, you'll probably spiral downwards. This is very hard to do! But you must try.

Be sure to watch your diet and drink enough water, too.

My brother in arms and best friend, the Almighty /u/Pegasus_Epsilon, is a master programmer (I think he must be close to 10,000 hours spent writing code now...) and the most intelligent and knowledgeable person I know! I've been witnessing the fruits of his most recent furious coding sessions as he works on this project for you, and the results are already magnificent.

Years ago, when I first met Peg, I introduced him to a fractal called the Herter-Heighway Dragon, sometimes referred to as the '[dragon curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve)'. I was in university, studying programming/software development. I had written a very crude renderer using OpenGL and GLUT in C. I asked Peg to look at my code and how to optimise the algorithm.

It didn't take him long to figure out a much, much, muuuuch better algorithm, which he swifly implemented and rendered. It serendipitously led to a lovely shading method as well! This was one of my first glimpses at his programming prowess.

A while later, and I've written a program in C to render the [Mandelbrot Set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set). I share the code with Peg and that started a journey that would last years. He wrote his own renderer whilst I worked on my own, we talked at length about our code, shared, collaborated, and we eventually split paths. Pegasus focused on a command-line renderer. I focused on an explorer, much like what he is developing for you now. My main goal was to zoom around the edges of the Set, looking for 'pretty' :) Peg's goal was to be write the best, most accurate, fastest Mandelbrot renderer ever.

In the last year or so, iirc, Peg finished his magnum opus, threadedfractals. He shoved it up on github, satisfied with his latest and greatest work, and then went back to chilling out and relaxin' all cool and such.

I cannot emphasise enough how much time, thought, effort, blood, sweat, and tears, Pegasus has poured into his Mandelbrot/Julia renderers. He has produced renders of unrivalled quality and has implemented algorithms that very few have done well, particularly cross-trap/orbital-trap sampling.

In the meantime I've been tinkering with my own projects, and have in fact just picked up my latest fractal orientated project again, which is fact going to be a GUI for a small program Peg wrote for palette generation.

Anyway. I've written all of this because:

a) you seem like a really cool teacher, and the world needs more people like you
b) I type fast
c) Peg's awesome and I like talking about him to anyone who will listen
d) he's my best friend
e) he's now drawing on years of accumulated knowledge and learning to write software for you, for free, simply because that is how he rolls. I wanted to try and draw some attention to that :)

I'm sure you will enjoy it when Peg finishes it! Be sure to let us know how your students react to your class :)

She was actually ranked 8th, as I recall, before she beat Holm and shot up the list. Some people have said that this was her game plan all along, that she knew she would be pitted against Rousey sooner rather than later (due to there not being many other options), so she tried to hide her skills to make it more surprising. This argument doesn't hold much water considering in a fight, you're never really going to want to hold back. You're in it to win it. But it does make you wonder...

So yeah, she did kinda come out of nowhere especially from the perspective of a more casual fan.

487,"That was my very first TL;DR, thanks!

I'm sure when she was first starting in MMA and particularly in the UFC, she wasn't as arrogant as she was before her fight against Holm. She had beef with Miesha Tate but otherwise she was quite respectful to her opponents. After the nonsense in the weigh-ins with Holm though, you could argue that by the time they're in the Octagon about to fight, there is absolutely no other reason to not touch gloves unless you are actually that emotionally involved with the fight. So perhaps she really did dislike Holm at that moment in time. Maybe she got caught up in the whole thing. She always seemed to be an emotional fighter, which I think hindered her.

I do hope she comes back though. I would love to see her combine that beautiful judo with wrestling/shooting and great striking. That would be amazing to watch. She has the opportunity to learn humility here, just like GSP did when he lost to Matt Serra. He came back from that, learnt from that, and became one of the greatest of all time. He was the epitomé of a humble fighter (to me, at least), and I see a lot of him in Holly Holm.",2015-11-25 13:19:57+00:00,cxcj8o9,3.0,t1_cxchxt5,4145.0,explainlikeimfive
488,"It is easy to like a dominant fighter, and Ronda Rousey used her Olympic level judo to beat all of her opponents to great effect. The statistics speak for themselves. She won her first three amateur fights by armbar in the first round. Then she proceeded to win her first seven professional fights in the exact same fashion; an armbar in the first round. I haven't checked, but I'm 99.99% sure that no other fighter has dominated in such a way (same technique, same round).

Then she fought Miesha Tate for the second time, who managed to make it to the third round with Ronda, but still lost by armbar. Her next four fights she won in the first round with a variety of finishes (KO (punches), another armbar, KO (punch), and a knee to the body).

She was always a rather fierce character, as you might expect from an elite fighter. She didn't mince words, she was outspoken, brash, etc. And all this time, she was really paving the way for women in MMA. She was a big draw. I for one, as a former judoka, loved seeing such high level judo in MMA. It was awesome to watch.

Now to the casual observer, this is amazing to watch and read about. A fighter, dominating in such a way, with 75% of her victories with an armbar and 92% of them in the first round. That kind of prowess attracts attention in any sport.

And thus a hype machine was born. The UFC promoted her more than almost any other fighter at the time. Due to being paid proportionally to how much money she brought in to the UFC (revenue at the gate and in PPV buys), she was the highest paid fighter in the UFC. She was a Big Deal.

But to the more hardcore fans, such as those of us in /r/mma, there were aspects that went largely unnoticed. Chief amongst them: her division (bantamweight) was weak. The combined record of her opponents at one point was something like 1-7. Most champions will fight fighters coming off a winning streak, with mostly wins on their record. But there simply weren't (and still aren't) many female mixed martial artists at a high level at the time. Rousey was an Olympian, with a strong work ethic and a desire to win, and she climbed to the top, but arguably it was a relatively shallow climb.

As for why she is facing such a backlash now, in the last year or two she was getting extremely arrogant. All elite fighters have confidence in spades and the mental aspect of combat sports is paramount. You have to believe you're going to win. But there is a very fine line between confidence and arrogance, and Rousey went deep into arrogance. She got too big for her boots, was apparently surrounded by yes men, was told that she had 'elite boxing skills' to go along with her judo... people got swept up in the hype around her and I think she did too. She was in movies, countless interviews on television, etc etc... it must be hard not to let all of that get to you.

So by the time she fought Holly Holm, she was saying things like ""I believe I can beat anyone in my division with one hand"". Arrogance. And yes, you can argue she's just talking smack and trying to hype the fight to get more buys... but personally, I don't think so. I think she got swept up in the hype. Being told your boxing skills are elite when you're about to fight perhaps the best female boxer ever..! Some of the video footage of her shadow boxing in particular drew great criticism. On the pads she looked a bit sharper and faster, but in the Octagon it was never crisp and clean. Her win against Bethe Correia (supposedly a hard hitter who frequently won by punches), was essentially just her charging Correia down, eating a few punches, pinning her to the cage wall, and overwhelming her. There was no finesse, no head movement, no neat footwork or evasion. Bethe wasn't actually a hard hitter, and Ronda just ate those punches, apparently because she wanted to prove that she wasn't just a one trick pony. Not exactly champion level tactics.

I don't think people 'hated her all along'. I for one liked watching her fight at the start. But as her personality started to show and her arrogance grew, it was harder and harder to like her. It was also hard to hear people talk about her like she was some kind of god, when under the surface you could see that she wasn't as great as she was being made out to be. And it was oh so satisfying to see such a masterful fighter like Holm dominate her completely and knock her out in such a spectacular fashion, ending her reign and proving just that.

TL;DR everyone loves to see arrogance fall off their high horse.",2015-11-24 23:20:17+00:00,cxbzar2,1.0,t3_3u4r2q,6322.0,explainlikeimfive

510,"Robin Walker explains the reasoning in the last paragraph in this [article](http://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=1656):


&gt;Like many additions of hidden complexity, this was a solution to a problem we observed in playtesting. Early on, the medigun only had a single base healing rate of 24 health per second. One behavior we saw players exhibit was that of retreating away from the front line to get healed by a Medic, before returning to combat. Over time, we saw players stop doing this, when they realized that the time it took to be healed back there wasn't worth it. They could have kept fighting at the front line, died, and respawned in much the same amount of time. We wanted to encourage that retreat-for-healing behavior, so we needed to reduce the time it took. We didn't want to affect the healing rate 'in combat' though, so we added this ramp. By using the time since the target was last hurt as a measure of how much combat the target is in, we could essentially tune two different healing speeds independently. The base amount is the rate of healing 'in combat', and the fully ramped amount is the healing rate for resting 'out of combat'.

511,"Yeah I guess I'm nitpicking a bit, its just phrasing it like that doesn't make any sense to me. If you're not taking damage then a faster healing rate is utterly redudant to you. The point is that if you're on the frontlines taking damage and come back, you'll get healed faster.

As I recall, Valve implemented it to encourage people to attack. Before it people were constantly falling back to get healed/find healthpacks.

Anyway, no biggie! :)",2015-10-12 13:43:03+00:00,cvww1lk,6.0,t1_cvwvfiy,1406.0,tf2
512,"He is saying 'when they don't take damage for a certain amount of time'.

I'm saying what the wiki is saying. The qualifying factor for healing at a faster rate is 'I took damage over 10 seconds ago'. Which is different from 'not taking damage over a certain period of time'. If you continued to take damage, you'd still qualify.",2015-10-12 12:44:07+00:00,cvwum5l,4.0,t1_cvwmkoj,28701.0,tf2
513,"Regarding 'crit heals' at [28s](https://youtu.be/5lf0jWCYNOM?t=28) he phrases it as ""...when they don't take damage for a certain amount of time"", which isn't true. You get crit heals after a certain amount of time has elapsed since you've taken damage.

From the [wiki](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Healing#Healing_and_.C3.9CberCharge_rates):

""The healing rate is linearly based upon how long ago the target was last damaged. If the target was damaged less than 10 seconds ago, then they are healed at the normal rate of 24 health per second. From 10 to 15 seconds, this rate increases linearly from 24 up to a maximum of 72 health per second""
