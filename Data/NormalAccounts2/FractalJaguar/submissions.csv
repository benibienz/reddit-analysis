I got another Pi, same type, in case that was at fault - also faulty. I tried a battery/powerbank thing as well.

Apparently it requires 5V @ 2.5A, and that is what is stated on the power supplies. The last one I ordered actually says it is 5.1V @ 2.5A.

I am stumped, and mildly annoyed! I don't want to order more and more power adapters until I can figure this out. I am worried that the two Pis I have might be damaged, possibly from not having enough power in the first place?

I asked some questions about [2 months](https://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/4j2mlq/questions_from_a_de_noob_your_answers_and_advice/) later, and now I have another one

What is the best way to prep again between passes? I've tried rinsing again with cold water, and then hot water, and then lathering up again (brush still has a lather on it, so that's easy enough - I'm still using the shaving cream) - but it feels like I 'dry out' quickly, making it not so pleasant towards the end. I've also tried just rinsing again with warm water. I know cold water closes the pores (although not sure why that is important after a shave), but I don't know if that is necessary between passes.

So far I mostly just do one pass, WTG of course, if I just want to banish the stubble, and two passes, WTG &amp; ATG, if I really want to be smooth. Quite satisfying when it goes well; my lady has been impressed! I experimented a bit with WTG -&gt; XTG, but found it to be tricky for some reason. Maybe I'll give it another go.

I still get some nics now and then, and I have a bump near my chin that I have to be careful around. The chin in particular is quite hard, as I'm sure is the case for most guys. Straight blade, basically spherical surface, right?!

My aim I think really suffers due to the very high sensitivity I use. I'm seriously considering putting in the time to get used to a lower sensitivity but we're talking about undoing a 20 year old habit. For some reason that is how I first started playing, and now I'm extremely familiar with just a light 'claw' grip and flicking my mouse about using my fingers. I don't really move my wrist at all.

At the moment I'm using about 6cm/360°. It was about 5cm/360° a few days ago, I dropped it a bit and it seemed to help with movement, getting the right speed for bunny hopping in particular.

Ultimately I think I need something approaching 'correct form' in order to get better. I can see the really good player and how they can track extremely well, e.g. with the IC, and flick shots with the bolt rifle etc. I can do those things, but not consistently. I feel like I have built up a bad habit.

I''m thinking if I approach 10-15cm/360°, that might help a lot. One guy in game told me he uses 60cm/360° which blows my mind. I'd need an extra desk for the mousepad! I'm always going to be on the high sensitivity scale but I feel like what I have grown used to over the years is a little extreme. I started with Quake 2 about 19 years ago, that was my first online multiplayer game. I probably didn't have much space for my mouse back then and that was how I started!

I'd be curious to see what you all use and how you settled on that sensitivity. Have any of you switched from low to high, or high to low? What was your experience? I'd really appreciate your help.

I'm not a complete noob but very much a 'casual' player, but this doesn't seem to be a skill thing, more of a map design and game mode thing. Some maps don't seem to have enough spawn points and only a few are designed for 8 players (and still a good map). Three players were telefragged when a game started the other day!

AFFA is a nice alternative as you start with weapons so you have a fighting chance - but it is a round by round basis so if you die early you get bored waiting, and you tend to wait a long time because the game lends itself to cautious, camping play.

So I'm wondering if there is a halfway point that would be fun? Perhaps starting with all weapons, but limited ammo. Armour would still be on the map and you'd need ammo pretty quickly, but otherwise standard FFA.

I'm getting a closer shave (as confirmed by my lady, just by looking at my face, not to mention feeling the smoothness), and I'm looking forward to saving all that money. And learning a new skill and enjoying the process of shaving after many years. But I have some questions!

* I opted for shaving cream instead of soap. Do I still need to whip up a lather in a bowl? I thought you had to lather soap, but cream is ready to go, but now I'm not so sure.
* Regarding the angle of approach, so to speak, should you basically hold the razor perpendicular to your skin, and then slowly change the angle until you can hear the hair being cut? And then perhaps a little bit more until it tugs, and the ease up a bit?
* Are there significant advantages to using soap instead of cream? My impression so far is that it is harder to get lather with a soap, but worth the effort?
* I've tried Wilkinson Sword and Lord blades so far. I got a great shave the other day after using the Lord one for a while, but the next shaving wasn't so good. No doubt due to still learning technique. The Wilkinson ones I used to start with, about three or four shaves, and they were good too. Should I still try other blades (I bought a sample pack)?
* Is blade choice really that subjective, depending on skin type, type of razor...?
* Can't think of anything else!",wicked_edge,Questions from a DE noob - your answers and advice would be greatly appreciated!,https://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/4j2mlq/questions_from_a_de_noob_your_answers_and_advice/

I have some suggestions, tweaks, etc, for the mod which I will list soon and post, rather than try and remember them all now!

One question though, are the developers looking to keep RSMC as a standalone mod? E.g. designed to be played on its own, or are you looking to make it integrate nicely with other mods? Obviously  you can't debug crash reports  and so on from huge modpacks with no concrete information, but I've noticed as I've played that some little tweaks to make it play nicely with other mods would be most welcome, although could probably be developed separately. NEI &amp; Waila integration, for one thing, would be nice - although I really like the guides and crafting tooltips from the skills menu, that's a fantastic feature.

I know a lot of people use client-side map mods such as Journey Map, but I prefer not to and I know others prefer not to as well.

Currently in TFC you need the vanilla recipe for maps (4 iron, 1 redstone), and redstone in particular seems to be particularly rare, only occuring in a few types of stone. I'm not actually sure if you can map vanilla maps in TFC even though they show up in NEI, i need to test that in a creative world.

I think making them cheaper would be nice, maybe just requiring reeds for paper (perhaps a slightly more involved process) and perhaps some simple dyes. You could even have a tiered system: simple black and white maps to begin with and as you get more dyes, you can colour them in (not explore the same area again though, you'd have used numbers for the different colours, hah!).

Just an idea anyway, I'm curious what other people think. The key thing for me is that TFC emphasises exploration greatly, and when you're travelling early on finding seeds and prospecting, it would be lovely to be able to map your progress and make a nice map wall at your base :)",TerraFirmaCraft,Would you like cheaper in-game maps?
