However some nuclear power plants lasted more than 60 years. 
New generations are getting better and are expected to last even longer. 

Solar panels aren't cheap, a solar power plant is more expensive than a nuclear power plant. In Germany, generating electricity from a nuclear power plant cost 7 cents for 1kWh which is 5 times less than what is generated with solar power plants.

The problem is that nuclear energy is still has to evolve and be better. The ideal nuclear power plant should not cause any pollution and should be entirely safe. 

In my opinion, there is still a need of major breakthrough whether it is for nuclear or solar power. Because to this day, there isn't any ideal solution for generating power.

* The fact that you needed your professions while leveling. You could make good gear with it that you would use. Today maxing a profession is not as useful in leveling and it feels almost like a chore to level it up.

* I prefer that leveling is a little bit harder/longer. I don't mean dumb chain quest ""bring me 3 rocks from place x"" not in that sens but today you can solo anything in few days, it's also becoming a chore instead of fun and social. It also used to be a big thing having just 2 level 60. Today it's becoming like a street fighter game where you choose your character and you're ready to go. 

* I prefer the lack of transmog. Because your look represent your game experience. That's a good RPG feature. You could see people with stuff from a certain raid and say to your friend: ""wow look at this dude, he has this weapon...""

* You don't count copper and silver anymore. And there is a serious problem with ""infinite money"" in WoW. It's too easy to get gold and too hard to get rid of it. In Vanilla it was hard to get gold but too easy to spend. 

* Everyone has now a repair robot thanks to the mounts. You don't need to move in order to repair. Btw everyone has 100 different mounts. It used to be a thing just having a mount from another faction. 

* LFG tool is great but the tool for queuing in dungeons and being teleported is awful. It kills the RPG side of the game where you had to walk to the dungeons and kill a hundred of mobs before entering in. 

* Spells that needed to be learn with quest or spells that required a object in order to cast.

163,"I had to make a simple side scroller game in assembly x86 masm syntax. 


In assembly, in order to draw on screen, you have to first draw in a video memory buffer. Then, when the screen is refreshing, you copy the buffer on the screen. This is done in order to avoid screen tearing. This is  technique is called ""double buffering"" (if I remember well).


Things went wrong because it was one of my first time as game dev in the assembly programming world. The double buffering did not work very well and I still had lot of screen tearing. To  make things more fun: importing sprites did not work at all.


I had only 2 days left to finish the game. The game had to work. So I worked the whole night and day. The solution for avoiding screen tearing was to draw with the bios function ""int 10h"" and not ""int 21h"". The difference between the two functions is that int 21h is the correct one. It is fast and don't take a lot of the CPU compared to draw with ""int 10h"".The ""int 10h"" function takes a lot of the CPU and it is very slow, people would laugh at you if you use ""int 10h"" for game dev. But because ""int 10h"" is slow it did magically solve my screen tearing problem. 
And the solution for the sprite problem? I did draw every pixel of the game manually.

Thermal shock happens mainly because of fast changes in temperatures. And this happens every time when you start your computer, for example: some chips go from 20°c to 85°c in less than 30 minutes. The same thing happens when you power off the computer. 
The only real solution to avoid thermal shock is to keep you computer constantly at the same temperature. Which is impossible because sometimes you play games, sometimes you browse Facebook, ...

Check Wikipedia for more information. 
You will know everything you will need. 

My girlfriend tried all kind of treatments but no one worked. She lived 3 years long with this disease. After 3 years I don't know why but it did go away for no reason. Luckily for us. 

I hope that you don't have vulvodynia but if you have it: be strong. The most important thing is finding the right doctor that understand this disease. Try most of the treatments, it may work for you. Keep masturbating to maintain the sex drive. Pain will be worse over time so chances are that sex drive will be nearly no existent if you don't keep up with masturbating (our doctor advice).

The r9 m370x should play WoW at medium/high but would consume a lot more your battery.  

You don't need 16gb of ram. 12 or 8 is fine. Even 4gb is fine if you don't game and just produce. 
Again if you don't game or do something else you also don't need the r9 m370x. 

In fact your actual laptop is fine and shouldn't be slow even if you have a first gen i5 or not. Try cleaning your whole laptop (not just a simple reinstallation).
And if you really want a ssd try replacing your hdd.

It's like a fps you need ammo to shoot. Yes it's sucks, sometimes you don't really play the game because you're looking around for ammo during 5 minutes. 
Worst, sometimes it can be the reason why you die. But hey that's part of the game and it isn't real gameplay.
And I understand your opinion. Maybe your right and it was a bit too hard (never had a demo) but they could at least improve this and find a good balance instead of removing it.

Some people can handle it some not. I tried for almost 2 years to accept it and to change my perspective about it but I couldn't. I thought that it would be better over time but it even get worse. 
So I broke up.

It's up to you but don't waste your time. You have to know if you can accept it or not. How longer you will wait how more difficult it will be to broke up.

And changing your perspective isn't easy. You lived your whole life thinking in a certain way. That way of thinking is made with experiences, culture, friends, family,... You can't change that 25 years long way of thinking with some simple reddit comments.

230,"I personally would never do my life with someone that has such a high number when being only 20. 
Some people can. I can't. The reason is simple: culture and vision about this. 

For me sex is the biggest personal gift that someone can give. 
And like any other personal gift: the gift will lose all value if 50 people that weren't important to you received the same gift. It wouldn't be special anymore. 

Now that vision depends on culture and it is very hard to change that. I lived my whole life thinking that way and almost everyone around me here thinks that way. 

Don't lie about your number because otherwise he will find out and be very upset. If you find someone make sure he has no problem with it.
