Almost two weeks ago I watercooled my computer. 

I didn't thought of it but... on which pin of the mobo does the pump and radiator fan go on? There are chances that I did it wrong. I didn't found a clear answer on the internet.  

Right now I have 2 sorts of pins on my mobo: 

- **CPUfan** (two of them)

- **SYSfan** (three of them) 

I attached my pump to the **CPUfan1** and the fans of the radiator on **CPUfan2** (with a fanhub). 
In the BIOS I modified the curve so that the minimum fan speed is a little higher than before in order to keep the pump always on. 

Is this right? Or should I set the fans on **SYSfan** so they can go faster since they don't share the same pin as the pump?

How did you do it for your system?

I was wondering if the Raijintek Triton (combined to the waterblock) would do the job to cool my gpu? 

It is, for me, a very cheap solution while being very simple to install compared to a full custom waterloop installation.



Would that work? Is it a good idea? Or is it better to choose a kraken G10 despite the fact that it does not cool the VRMs?
