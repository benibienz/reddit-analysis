2.Pacific Time Zone and i am available pretty much all day the only thing i have is school which is form 8:00-2:50 and sleep                     
3.None but i have seen how you mods have been running this place. Also i helped people out with the Gogeta dokkan fight for global so i have team team building experience                                   
4.Well I'm a very big dbz fan and started watching it in 3rd grade then lost interest and then i played SuperSonic Warriors for the GameBoy Advance and now i love DBZ again. Have read a good chunk of the manga so i know what i'm talking about. Also I am a HUGE MGS fan. And the rest is history. Hoping i can get a good position on this sub.
