What would you do is you would gamble dragon stones and if you win you get yours and your opponents and if you lose you lose your stones and your opponent gets them. Now here's the hard part how would the battling work well how i could see is you take turn fighting each other (kinda like pokemon). Most likely to settle who goes first they can do something like a coin flip or rock paper scissors you know something luck based.So when your battling your opponent here's how i imagine it. the chracters it would be like WT with WAAAAAAAAYYYYYY buffer health bars (to prevent AOE opponents from being OP). The thing is with PVP there is a lot of rage quitters who quit when there gonna lose. So to counter it what they could is if someone doesn't make a move in 30 seconds or quits the match then it's a forfeit and the other person gets to keep their stones.
