* You bubble people before they actually start taking damage. Try to check if an enemy is firing on you or an ally, and bubble _when_ they're firing, not before. 
* If you have a clear view on a Support you're going to want to target them in most situations. The only time where I'd say it's less of a priority than focusing down somebody else is if it's a Lucio, as his healing isn't enough to keep someone alive and he doesn't have enough DPS to cause too much trouble for you.

100,"I haven't actually tried Ana out in comp, and I'm mostly just practicing her since I've only played her 6 hours so far, so I'm not too sure on any ""proper strategy"" unfortunately.

If a tank is really injured I usually use my nade on them so I can heal them a lot faster, same goes for a group of my teammates that are damaged (ie: graviton surge). 

If there's an enemy Pharah I usually try to prioritize taking them out, and then enemy supports such as Mercy or Zen. Nading an enemy Roadhog is good as well, or nading enemies when Zen is ulting so they can't be healed.

This is really great when a friendly Zarya ults, the enemy Zen ults, then with one grenade you nullify Zen's ult completely.

Trying to counter-snipe a Hanzo or Widow is usually a death sentence unless they're not very good, so I usually just stay out of line-of-sight.

* **Always use full cover if you can help it.** I can't stress this enough. ESPECIALLY if playing on harder difficulties. It makes the aliens 40% less likely to hit you, which is *huge*.
* **Use all of your blue moves before using any yellow moves.** You don't want to Overwatch a soldier only to find out a smoke could've saved you a death.  
* **Never uncover more ground on your last turns**. You don't want to encounter an alien pod with your last soldier and be caught with your pants down because you moved all of your soldiers and now can't retaliate.  
* **Have a B team.** You don't want your A team to be taken out of commission because they're all wounded only to have a terror mission and have to send out rookies.

OW can keep an enemy in the same spot instead of moving to flank you or something similar. It's not guaranteed though. It also can give you a better chance to hit, as if the alien moves out of cover you might get a better shot.",2015-12-17 14:11:32+00:00,cy27fz9,5.0,t1_cy27b5f,288,Xcom

995,"[](/fluffysit)I'm finding it very enjoyable, even when on the Rebel side in Walker Assault. It's pretty epic (to me at least) fighting against an obviously superior force, with TIE Fighters bombarding your position and shots pinging against the ground near you while you sprint to the next trench for cover. To me, it felt like an authentic Star Wars game.

I find it satisfying even when I lose in that mode. It's definitely not something many will like though, which is why I'm surprised they did it in the first place, even if it does make sense (empire being the more numerable and powerful force).

I'm one of those people you talk about with the Jump Jet and a DLT-19 rifle, but to be fair each weapon has their strengths and weaknesses (though the DLT-19 should be less accurate than it is). 

I love the Cycler Rifle as it recharges pretty fast and allows everyone to have a more balanced long range weapon that's reusable. Having it one-shot on body would make it a lot more OP, everyone would just sit back and keep using it instead, with the Sharpshooter perk giving them extra recharge. Plus, it's very satisfying on Hoth to pull off a headshot at long-range on an Imperial who's out in the open.

Overall, I'm very happy with the game so far, aside from a lack of variety in gamemodes in the beta. And survival is, like you said, way too easy right now.",2015-10-11 15:45:20+00:00,cvvvdpt,1.0,t3_3oc5lt,1971,MLPLounge
