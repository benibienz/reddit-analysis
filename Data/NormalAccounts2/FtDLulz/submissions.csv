* While I'm pretty confident this build will do what I need, there wasn't much feedback on the build I chose in /r/buildmeapc, so I decided to make a post here and see what you thought of this final list before I pulled the trigger. I'll give this post a day or so to get some feedback. I really appreciate it!

* If I can somehow get a 1080 in here instead that would be great as well!

* I'm purchasing from B&amp;H, OutletPC, Amazon, and Newegg only, so the list price reflects that.

While I might know more about them than the average person, I don't have enough confidence in myself to be able to get the most out of my money, especially when it's _this_ much. So thank you!

Now, on to the questions...  


&gt;**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

* Gaming: GTA V, Overwatch, ARMA 3 (all preferably maxed out at 1080p/1440p)
* Simple editors such as GIMP or possibly Photoshop, After Effects
* Programming with Visual Studio and other IDEs
* Virtual reality with an HTC Vive

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

* $1700. Ouch, my wallet will kill me. I can go to $1800 if absolutely necessary.

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

* ~A week.

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\)** 

* I need pretty much everything that's not a keyboard, mouse, headset or OS.

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

* United States, no Microcenter.

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

* Reusing a Logitech G710+ Mechanical Keyboard and a Logitech M705 Wireless Mouse. Headset is a HyperX Cloud II. OS is Windows 10 Home. Second monitor is a Dell with a 1280x1024 60Hz resolution.

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

* Possibly in the future, both?

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

* An SSD ~250-500GB as a boot drive, and a 2-3TB HDD for storage. Games are huge, man.

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* I prefer simplistic cases, in tones of black/white. My current case is the [NZXT Source 210](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811146075), so something similar to that style would be wonderful!

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

* No, already have a Windows 10 Home key.

&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**  

* I'd love to get a monitor that's 120-144Hz and 1080p or 1440p. I was[ looking at this monitor](https://smile.amazon.com/Dell-Gaming-S2716DG-LED-Lit-Monitor/dp/B0149QBOF0?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=pcpapi-20) and it looked good, but if you can find a better one that's fine by me!
* I'd like to stick to an Intel CPU and NVidia GTX 1070 or 1080 if possible.
* RAM should preferably be DDR4-2133 or better.
* I'll need some thermal paste, was looking at [Arctic Silver 5](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835100007&amp;nm_mc=AFC-C8Junction&amp;cm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-PCPartPicker,%20LLC-_-na-_-na-_-na&amp;cm_sp=&amp;AID=10446076&amp;PID=3938566&amp;SID=) but whatever you guys think is best will do!
* A network card is pretty much necessary. [I had my eye on this one](http://www.outletpc.com/jw4213-gigabyte-bluetooth-wifi-pcie-adapter.html?utm_source=jw4213-gigabyte-bluetooth-wifi-pcie-adapter&amp;utm_medium=shopping%2Bengine&amp;utm_campaign=pcpartpicker&amp;utm_content=Gigabyte%2B-%2BNetworking%20%3E%20Network%20Cards%20%2D%20Wireless%20%28PCI%2DExpress%29) as it has bluetooth as well, but BT's not a deal-breaker at all. It should support dual-band b/g/n at least, though.
* I'd prefer to order from only one or two places at a time such as Amazon &amp; Newegg, but I know it's hard to do that and make a decent build considering price differences, so unless you can do it and meet my other requirements, then don't worry about it.
* I have a monitor that will be used as a second monitor, but it's an old Dell with a 1280x1024 60Hz resolution. It does only support VGA, but I do have a VGA-DVI adapter that I'm currently using.
* I do not have any DisplayPort cables, so include one if the included cables are bad/low quality/less than 6 ft. long.
* I don't really want to deal with watercooling, and a build of this level shouldn't need it either. Keep it cool (with air), please! :3


I know I have a lot of specifics, but I want to make sure I have everything I want out of this huge amount of money. I did actually [modify a build on pcpartpicker, so if you want to make any suggestions on that one](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/FtDLulz/saved/xjBD3C) instead of putting together an entirely new list, then go right ahead!

Our school has Homecoming week, and on Thursday of that week, we have a video game tournament, seeing who can win the trophy that my teacher makes up using various tools such as a laser printer or the wood mill.

Each class (Freshmen, Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors) have four players each. We play a match, where teams are designated by color, as in Halo CE you can't have more than two teams, and then the next match is the actual tournament free-for-all.

I won in my Freshmen year when we all played Unreal Tournament 2004(?) and then I've won the rest of them on Halo CE. There's a joke that if you see me you'd have better luck running, so everyone said it was sort of expected that I'd win.

I feel guilty that I didn't give my senior friends a chance to win any of the tournaments because I played, which seems like a silly thing to worry about. Just by saying that it feels like I'm bragging. They all wanted me to play anyway since they said it wouldn't feel like they won if I didn't.

Whew. Anyway, needed to get that out there. What would you have done in this situation, Plounge? Not played in the tournament? Played, but not really tried? Or would you have just done what I did and played anyway?

Budget is the lowest you can get it, but around $300, give or take a few dollars, should be the max if at all possible.

Monitor, keyboard, and mouse are all taken care of, so these are the things I need:

* Memory (preferably at least 4 GB)  
* Storage (I'd prefer a SSD, even one that was only around 120 GB, but a cheap hard drive is fine)  
* Case (preferably a smaller one, like a Micro ATX?)  
* Operating System (should be Windows 7 or Windows 10)

No microcenter in my area. For the RAM, I'd prefer 1x4GB for possible future upgrade space.

There wasn't a stadium. Instead, we were in a tall box (just tall, it was probably 20 feet across from each side) that had netting all around. A huge TV was in the corner, and on the other two sides were the seats we were sitting in.

The seats were at the top, so you had to slide down plastic foam-covered poles to get down and climb up these raised plastic platforms, almost like a kid's playhouse. There was always the danger of falling to your death, even with the netting, but no one seemed to care. 

Then, my name popped up on the screen, and said 6 Million to One! (Apparently my chance of someone else having my name in the area.) I had apparently won something, and got Oreo crust. No cake, just the crust. 

After that, my teachers (wat) came over to congratulate me. After that huge thing was over, I found myself in a basement, with four completely open ways to the outside, and sliding wooden doors to block those entrances. It was complete by being almost pitch dark sans the creepy flickering lights. 

That's all that happened. Then I woke up at 8:40. Four hours after my usual time I like to wake up at.
