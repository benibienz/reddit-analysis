4,"Ghost is pretty cool. I listened to their Infestissumam album, I liked it a lot. They have a really vintage sound, to me, but not as heavy as other bands out there. I think they make up for it though with those cool melodies and vocal harmonies. I think the vocal melodies give a more ""pop"" element to their sound, but not in a bad way, in a ""people will dig this because it's catchy"" kind of way :)

As far as suggestions, I would say definitely check out Belzebong and Saint Vitus and Elder too! Really heavy stuff!",2016-11-09 22:20:17+00:00,d9th6rq,2.0,t1_d9rvnvy,80162.0,doommetal

7,"Thanks a lot! Yeah, I'm always excited when music I like gets discovered and is considered awesome by new people. I'm definitely sharing all the doom songs I come across with my friends and family as well as posting them online. I agree with you, growth within a specific music community (especially metal) should always be seen as a good thing. With so much pop music and rap music dominating mainstream culture, it's good to see metal still thriving and keeping it's hold on the underground scene. I make Industrial Metal music, and for a while I was only interested in Industrial bands and that's it, but I quickly realized that venturing out to different branches of this awesome Metal tree is actually pretty beneficial because it introduces you to new sounds, new ways of playing music and amazing new people who love the music just as much as you do. I appreciate your comment, and I'll for sure be posting more cool songs here.

8,"The ""Hellrasier"" movies were a big inspiration for me when creating this track. The dark atmosphere of the films, the cyber-goth aesthetic of Pinhead and the sadomasochistic undertones of Hellraiser overall inspired me to write a sort of theme song for the character of Pinhead. The idea was to capture the heavy darkness and aggression of Hellraiser and translate that into music that would convey that same type of energy and power.

The sadomasochistic themes in the Hellraiser films also played a role in the artwork design for the track. Displaying horrific pain and brutality without death was my goal when creating the artwork. The idea of being completely destroyed, but unable to die, thus forced to endure the pain and torture is truly terrifying, and that's what I wanted the art to portray.

9,"**Funeral Casket** [Greenville, DE / USA] 

I make Industrial Metal, emphasizing heavy riffs and industrial rhythms using a slightly slower tempo than most Industrial Metal of the 90's and 2000's. I play, program, and produce all the music myself as well as design the artwork, which I feel allows me to really give each track I create it's own individual feel and aesthetic.

My plan for my music is to take Industrial Metal in a bit more heavier, slower, and MORE ""metal"" direction, away from the predominantly Electronic / Industrial Dance type of sound. I use elements of Electronic music and Noise in my  tracks, but I tend to stay away from synthesizer breakdowns and leads and electronic dance music elements and instead use synthesizers to enhance the guitar and Industrial aspects of my music.

You can check out my music on my Bandcamp: http://funeralcasket.bandcamp.com

The track overall really reminds me of the Mick Gordon ""DOOM"" soundtrack style of production, but without all the electronic breakdowns and IDM stuff happening. 

My only critique would be that I couldn't hardly hear any bass in the track. The low end sounds hollow. Like it's missing bass synths or bass guitars. Maybe the kick drum and distortion on the mid's washed out the bass, or maybe it's because the track is a bit low, as far as volume, but I hear the kick drum and the melody of the guitars VERY CLEARLY, and it seems like there is some bass being created by the combination of the kick drum and the low end of the guitar frequencies, instead of an actual bass layer. I don't know, maybe it's just the way I'm hearing the track.

It's amazing how a lot of the different sounds and melodies came together to create these strange grooves and harmonies that I would have never thought would work well with each other, but they sound perfectly balanced and very cohesive.

My favorite track is definitely ""Another Time, Another Place"". It captures a very cool groove and heavy sound that sounds very abstract and at times even off beat, but it works so well. The melodic structure of the track is also very dark, especially the piano melody, which sounds incredibly sad at times, and the other percussion sounds seem to add to this dark atmosphere and create an almost harsh/noise sounding harmony. At 4:52, when the track seems to really explode, is very cool. The dark vibe increases and the eerie string/synth panning in the background along with this faint static fx just makes it all sound like the perfect soundtrack tune to a horror game. Very awesome!

86,"Wow! This track captures the atmosphere of the film almost perfectly! With the distressing scenes and broken memories and overall nightmarishly confusing visions of the city, the song seems to flow effortlessly with it all. If I hadn't known, I'd assume the song was released with the video and was an actual soundtrack tune.

The melodic aspect of the track is what seems to instantly pull you in when you're listening. It has such a hard edge, but keeps up such a great melodic vibe without getting too aggressive just for the sake of being aggressive because it's GTA. 

The mix of the track is also very well done. The percussion, surprisingly, cuts through the mix very cleanly. Usually the kick drum gets lost in a lot of rock mixes, unless of course, you use a drum machine. But the percussion on this mix sounds heavy and full as you'd expect it to sound live, instead of having really ""clicky"" sounding, dull drums. It's really awesome!

The guitars and vocals do not clash, even at the more higher points of the track. I didn't hear any distortion during the song at all. Even the solo at 2:44 sounds very clean the whole time without any distortion in the high end. Very well done!

Overall, I think this is an amazing track you guys did and an amazing idea to pair it with such an awesome video, which conveys the emotion of both the track and the impact of the video that I'm sure GTA was going for.

Anyway, Unterschicht is one of the few Industrial-Dance bands that I enjoy solely due to their ability to keep the music extremely heavy and dark!

93,"The melody on this track is amazingly catchy! Seriously, it's incredible! I also really enjoy the screaming elements with the vocals from time to time, it adds a different level of emotion to the track.

The track, even though it seems like a more rock driven type of track, it actually sounds like an alternative R&amp;B song at times. Like, if you replace the guitars with additional synths, it would be an alternative R&amp;B/Pop song almost instantly. To me, that's actually a good thing because it allows the song to connect with all kinds of music fans and break out beyond just the rock crowd.

The production is extremely smooth, and allows for the more melodic aspects of the track to really shine through, setting the guitars a little farther back in the mix than a traditional rock song and allowing the vocals to drive the track, which gives the track a great dance vibe. The drums also sound pretty smoothed out and almost sound like a drum machine at times, which again works perfectly on a melodic track like this.

Overall, this song is a perfect example of how to mix certain elements of other genres and still create a very fresh and accessible sound without alienating fans of one particular genre. Great work! Thanks for posting!

94,"This is really creative, and extremely atmospheric for such a trap/hiphop styled track. The synths used on this are the kind I'd expect to be used on an ambient album, or even an experimental/industrial project, but not on a hiphop track. It works well though, and actually adds a really calm, almost vaporwave vibe to the track, very cool!

My only critique would be the fact that after the wolf howling comes in at the 1:00 mark, the track never changes from that point. No breaks, no movement of the instruments, no other elements added, other than the occasional sound fx, but the beat stays the same for the most part. I think a little change up in the pattern, at least, would really make this track stand out as being something incredibly experimental and fresh.

Overall, I really like the concept of mixing the elements of ambient/minimal production with a trap sound, it's definitely really cool to listen to. Thanks for sharing!

It has a very hard driving, almost 8-bit electro styled beat with wild video game inspired synths giving the track an amazing amount of energy! The track also utilizes a few hiphop style breaks, especially right before the drop which features a pulsing, arpeggio bass synth that gives the track an endless groove and slightly dark atmosphere.

Definitely something that fans of Electro producers like Dyro, Wolfgang Gartner, and Far Too Loud will love.

I don't know, but fore me it just doesn't sound like a ""machine"" as I'm used to most industrial sounding. It does have very obvious IDM and ambient parts and moments in it, but it literally does sound like a legit metal track with no electronics at all, except, like I said for a few parts like from 4:20 to 5:47 which sounds very much inspired by Aphex Twin.

Overall it's pretty awesome, just giving my feedback on it :)

I have a rather aggressive approach to the way I make music, but I like to think that my music gets people really pumped and energized and just feeling badass!

The distortion and static fx are used quite well on this track.

This track actually reminds me a bit of Marilyn Manson's track ""Born Again"", with the spacious, machine-like drums and the distortion and static fx throughout the track. It's really awesome!

Godflesh
Nine Inch Nails

It creates a sense of familiarity to anyone who understand the power of any familial, or personal relationship and it speaks directly to the consciousness in regards to how positive melodies and positive memories go hand in hand.

I really like the subtle vocal buildup to the really dramatic melodic drum beat, which is very good btw. The arrangement is excellent, although I think the mix is a little muddy and doesn't really allow for that part of track to have as big of an impact as I think I could have. That could probably be fixed with a little widening and high end EQ of the overall mix and a bit of compression on the low end, but it doesn't make the track any less good with it being how it is right now.

The whole thing kind of reminds me of a spoken word piece set to really great music and I think it's really creative!

131,"The message behind this is actually pretty legit. The aggression is very understandable, especially now seeing what many of these so-called ""celebrities"" stand for and the blatant hypocritical actions that they all seem to display, to try to get sympathy and support from the people.

I guess Testament sees both Kanye and Jay Z not as brothers in arms, but actually the enemy in disguise. I have to agree to an extent. They are either REALLY good actors, making the establishment believe that they are all about pushing the agenda, or they are literally the enemy and assume that the people are absolute idiots who will never realize that their playing both sides when necessary.

That being said, maybe the few downvotes are because it's hard for some people to see rappers as apart of the establishment because they're portrayed as rebels who stand for the people, but in today's industry, the rappers are literally more corrupt than most politicians, and the fact that they most of the time come from the same struggles that the people still face today, the establishment uses that to their advantage and uses their image, music, products to lead the people to believe that they are for them and their success is all because they stood up against the powers that be and blazed their own path, and that somehow is supposed to translate into the people supporting them more.

It's all a bit confusing and at the same time obviously a scam and an attempt to pacify people, or at least keep them so focused on these fake ""heroes"" that they never really take any real action, until their so called ""leaders"", in this case, Kanye and/or Jay Z tell them to act. Jay Z rarely takes action on anything, at least not publicly, and Kanye...well, Kanye is someone I don't bother to understand.

135,"No problem man, I like giving feedback on different music, especially speaking directly with the artist.

Well, it kinda depends on the type of program/equipment you use, from there you can better judge what in the mix is dominating and causing the low end to be muddy. Sometimes it's a reverb issue, with the reverb tail just hanging on for too long and interfering with other notes.

If you use plugins, it's a matter of cutting some low end frequency, or maybe just sidechaining the low end to allow for more room for any other instruments that have a low frequency. If you're using a mixing desk/board, it's a matter of doing sort of the same thing but using a bit of panning, which can be done with plugins as well, and allowing space and then doing the frequency cutting if necessary. 

I use plugins and I try to mix all the low end instruments first, as that's usually what muddies up a mix, and then slowly add top end width just for stereo purpose, but not so much so that we cause another problem at the top end. Personally, I use A LOT of distortion so it's usually just a matter of not letting the mix get too wide or the distortion will sound like a freaking buzz saw cutting through your ear drum.

In your case, you just want the guitars to cut through that heavy wall of sound, which in my opinion is just a thick mid range, so if you open up the middle of the track a bit, you'll have room for the guitars to sit comfortable and then add distortion as needed until the top end sounds too bright and then pull back from there. That's what it sounds like to me, a mid-range issue, just lots of sounds hitting the middle with very little room to ""breathe"". 

Opening up/widening the mid's should do the trick.",2016-09-26 22:03:43+00:00,d838xto,3.0,t1_d837ox9,1749.0,ratemyband

139,"Very, very, very creative sound! Sounds Jazz influenced, especially on Albatross, which by the way, is my favorite of the 3 tracks.

The sounds reminds me a bit of what Pink Floyd used to do in their early days with the whole progressive, experimental, extremely long song structure type of thing. These songs aren't anywhere near as long, but they are definitely every bit as experimental with the tempo changes, the strange melodies clashing against each other and the very thick wall of sound.

That brings me to my next point...the mix of the tracks is pretty thick, once all the sounds get going and come into full effect. I'm not sure if this was purposefully done or if it was a mistake during the mixing process, but it really gives the track a heavily atmospheric feel as it feels like only a few sounds are able to cut through the mix and usually they are the experimental glitches and click sounds. I like that aspect of the music, it gives it a bit of an IDM feel. Although, maybe widening the mix wouldn't be a bad idea, just so the sounds don't attack each other as they sometimes seem to do during the climax of the tracks. It's most noticable on In/Sight, but not to the point where it damages the quality of the song, just sort of makes the mix a bit muddy.

As I mentioned earlier in the post, Albatross is my favorite. It sounds very much like an anthem or a beginning to some epic event about to unfold right before me, especially the intro. The buildup and arrangement of the track is very well done, and the melody is amazingly relaxing and yet feels like your being taken on a journey at the same time! Very cool.

I like the use of guitars, but they seem to get pushed down into the mix a bit too far sometimes, and start to sound like synths with heavy static and less like guitars with distortion. That's my only critique and it's not a major one, just something I thought you may want to be aware of moving forward with producing.

Overall, very cool sound and very creative approach to making music. I can't wait to hear more from you.

141,"This is really a good collection of songs. They sound really lo-fi, but in a very creative kind of way. The melodies on just about all of the songs are extremely catchy and I think the vocal style of the singer is very unique and actually quite nice.

My favorite in the track list is definitely ""Bedpost"". The constant changes in the groove are very ear grabbing and keeps you really engrossed in the song as it plays along. I especially like the way it starts out, with that very ambient and acoustic-jam session style, and then at 0:46 it just explodes into an upbeat almost pop rock sounding melody that's almost impossible not to tap your foot to, it's great!

I think the use of piano along with the acoustic guitar was a good choice, because it works well with the singers style. The vocals sometimes are a bit off key, but with the piano and acoustic aspect of it the track, it still sounds great and actually adds much more emotion to the songs and gives a slightly ""live-recording"" kind of feel, if that makes sense.

Great work man, and awesome songs!

142,"This is very, very cool. Sounds really inspired by the blues and a bit of funk. That slow, almost sludge-like groove just barely moving along is awesome! It has sort of a hiphop vibe, but much more free in the playing, and not as rigid and tight. 

This actually reminds me a lot of one of those slow 70's psychedelic rock jams that you'd probably hear playing from some random apartment at the end of the block, mid-day, with a bunch of people inside tripping on acid lol. It's pretty cool.

The bass is definitely king on this track. When the bass guitar comes in at 0:32, it's like a giant groove machine starting up and bulldozing forward destroying everything in it's way and allowing the guitars to just cover everything else in beautiful distortion! The best part is definitely the bass &amp; drum solo from 2:00 onward. That vibe is filthy and edgy as fuck!

I actually wish this track was a bit longer, maybe allowing for the guitars to have their moment to shine and play a few badass riffs before breaking down into that bass/drum solo, but the track is still cool nonetheless.

Very creative, especially to have such few and repetitive lyrics. I think that's what makes the track stand out so much. It's simple, but still so good.

143,"The melody on this is incredible! The arrangement sounds like something I'd hear on an awesome synthpop track with the very tight groove and wide harmonies throughout the track. It's very cool to hear a melodic structure like this in alternative rock. I think it creates an opportunity for more people to get into the music, because it appeals to both the alt rock community and the more pop oriented fans as well.

The bass guitar quietly holds the melody together and helps to create that strong dance-style rhythm, but doesn't overpower the mix to the point where it sounds like a wannabe funk song. The bass also fits extremely well with the drums, as they seem to work together and push the record with a really strong groove, which I love. It's really well done, from a mixing standpoint, as far as the bass and drums are concerned.

My only critique would be the vocals. Not they way they're recorded, but more so, the vocal's position in the mix. At times it seems to fall under the groove and fade into the background making it a bit hard to understand the lyrics. At first I thought it may be an issue with the bass and drum groove getting in the way, but I think it's just the vocal being a bit too low in the mix and as the harmony builds over the course of the song, the vocals get a bit lost in it all. On the other hand, it does add a real indie quality to the recording and the vocals actually start to act as a synth filling out the melody even more, but the singers voice sounds pretty good, so I'm sure you'd want the lyrics to be heard nice and clear. Maybe turning the vocals up a bit may help.

The flow and arrangement of the track is my favorite for sure. I like the tempo changes and the highs and lows of the vocals working with the strong and quiet parts of the melody. It creates a sense of real emotion and allows the listener to really get into the song and feel driven by the music, instead of feeling like they've just listened to a typical digital, heavily compressed, and overplayed radio single. Very nice work on putting together an arrangement that feels genuine and sounds very dynamic.

Overall, this is an amazingly well written piece of music, with an extremely catchy melody and great dance vibe, which as I said before, is awesome for an alternative rock track.

Great work! Thanks for sharing!

157,"This sounds so classic. From the kick drum to that snap/clap sounding snare. It sounds like the kind of beat that you could just turn on and play on repeat while driving down the highway at night.

I don't listen to much hiphop personally, but I could hear someone like Nas maybe rapping on this, or even Mac Miller. They both have pretty laid back flow styles and would fit perfectly on a beat like this, in my opinion.

The mix is very well done, and really has a warm retro feel. I think the thing that makes it sound so cool, is the way the rhodes/electric piano pans back and forth from left to right, giving it that classic vinyl stereo feel. Also the timing of the groove with the kick drum doubling up on the back beat is really creative and gives it that head nod quality. I'm literally nodding my head while typing this lol, very cool!

I don't know if you put a filter on the snare/clap/snap but if so, that was a great idea. It helps the snare fit snug down into the groove instead of it trying to balance out the groove if it were actually hitting hard and riding on top of the mix like most instrumental tracks.

The only critique I have, would be maybe to turn down the crowd/vocal fx a bit. At times they seem to overpower the groove and get in the way a little bit, but not so much that it ruins the track overall, they just break up the groove sometimes, and without lyrics you want that groove to flow smoothly the whole time.

Overall, very solid and catchy track. Thanks for sharing, it's very dope!

That lead synth sliding up and down against the breakbeat groove is pretty cool too. Adding the filter work on top of that, and it gives the track a real 8-bit character and video game feel to it. I'm not sure if this is a collection of different tracks or just an epic long track ""Planisphere"" by Justice, but that 17:09 beat is my favorite part of the whole thing. It has the most energy and seems to really disply Orangy's ability to create a solid dance groove without it sounding like a typcial cheesy EDM looped beat.

The bands I like, Anthrax, Slayer, Megadeth, Slipknot, Korn, Marilyn Manson, Nine Inch Nails, Pantera and most 90's metal bands all site Judas Priest's British Steel as a huge influence because it was a solid, full on Metal album, compared to their more Classic Rock styled earlier work. Those are just the bands I like though, it doesn't mean that mine is the definitive answer, just the answer that those whom I admire have given.

Some people consider Venom a legendary metal band, but I don't, but that doesn't mean they didn't push music forward stylistically and changed the face of Thrash Metal forever. That's just the truth.

170,"Being a metal head, I often like to pretend that ""Grunge"" never happened. Also being born in 91', I don't have as much of a connection with that era as other people. I was raised on Nu-Metal and Electronic music, yes it's true lol. Most Grunge bands don't even consider themselves apart of the metal family tree, but rather connect more with Punk Rock, which I can understand. Both styles are quite aggressive and never stood out as far as virtuosity was considered. Grunge seemed more of a way to ""fight back"" for frustrated 90's teens. Nonetheless, I think Kurt Cobain's image is what keeps Nirvana afloat all these years later.

Kurt, Like Tupac, was seen as the physical embodiment of the ""anti-establishment"" mentality. He was like an actual face being put to the feeling people had been feeling since the 60's/70's Punk movement. By ""people"" I mean, teens, but people all the same. Kurt never seemed to embrace fame the way most other bands, like Pantera, Anthrax, and Slayer did. So in a lot of people's eyes, Kurt was a sort of hero for the underdog. I think this idea is what makes people keep bumping up the ""legend"" of Nevermind and Nirvana as a whole. 

I'm not saying Nevermind isn't a good album, with very creative and strong lyrical content, but sometimes I think people put Nevermind in the same category, and by ""category"", I mean calling it a ""Great Album"", as albums like British Steel, or Paranoid, or Back in Black, or even Holy Wood (Yes, Marilyn Manson's best album in my opinion). 

I think a lot of our focus should be on reflecting on Kurt Cobain as an artist and individual more so than Nirvana as a band, because I doubt Nirvana would have been the same band without Kurt's personality, and affect on kids of the time. I mean, remove Kurt from Nirvana and you just have to very amazing musicians left, but no real ""image"" for kids to connect with.

That being said, I'm glad we're even reflecting on Kurt's art, but this is just my opinion on the whole ""Nevermind"" was the greatest album ever tag line that many people use today.

Then it seems to incorporate a lot of dubstep styled growls into that fast/upbeat pace, which is pretty cool. I think the thing that throws me off is the constant changes, not in melody, but in style. It starts to sound like mix of several different songs wrapped into one and you forget it's supposed to be one central idea. Maybe I'm thinking of this in a song format and structure and not in a video game sense, where the environment is constantly changing. Even then, I would think some similarity in sound would be appreciated, right? Maybe not. I'd actually like to try my hand at remixing this track, but for fear of not doing it enough justice, I probably won't. DOOM is legendary and that's the way I want to remember it.

The vocals almost sound like a quieter version of Jim Morrison, a more tame version, but still the same tone in many ways. The atmosphere of the track also seems a bit like darkwave, or a bit of goth inspired synthpop. That could be because of the way the vocal delivery creates a sort of sad emotion or painful inspiration. Reminds me of how the Pet Shop Boys used to deliver vocals on some of their tracks.

This is the type of track that keeps a perfect balance between bright and dark moments on a single track. It's uplifting, but in a very heavy and powerful way, which I'm sure has a lot to do with K.K. and Glenn blending those crushing guitars, creating that sound wall of awesomeness!

The guitars sounds really clean and extremely clear and almost have a stadium rock sound, which I like a lot, because it's easy to hear the very intricate riffs and solo moments of the guitar at different points in the song.

180,"This is REALLY awesome! First off, the guitars are extremely clean and give off a real dance style vibe, it's great! The groove of the track is incredible. It literally sits in this strong, almost blues type of groove for the entire track which is nearly impossible not to dance to! The melody is pretty dark, and creates a slight sense of aggression, not in a ""I wanna smash shit up"" kind of way, but more of an edgy late night type of way.

The vocals are my absolute favorite! The singers voice completely melts with the bass and guitar to make this wall of melody that seems to enhance the power of the track like 10x more! I don't know if it's the tone that she's singing in, or if it's the way it was recorded, but her voice has a heaviness to it that sounds amazing with that bass line. I like it a lot.

Overall, this track is very, very cool and incredibly catchy. I can imagine people losing their minds to this and just raging out at a dance club when this comes on. Great work!

Great post, thanks for sharing!

181,"Legendary! Hard rock at it's finest. Great to see these guys still rocking audiences as usual. I'm more into metal, but you can't deny a classic pioneer group like AC/DC and the Angus' short's never get old lol. Now, that I think about it, quite a few of my favorite metal bands were influenced by AC/DC because even though their rock, their riffs were pretty hard and dramatic on the low end, so I can see how they could spawn a generation of ""mud tone"" loving freaks such as myself.

184,"I've loved Ghost from the first time I heard Infestissumam. The thing that attracts me to their sound, is the way they seem to capture that vintage rock sound on every single record. Ghost just sounds like a band that was in a time that we all missed, but can still enjoy the classic records that they left behind. They sound like the kind of band that would have toured with Alice Cooper and Black Sabbath and Motorhead and would have totally ripped stadiums apart back in the 70's. Papa's vocals are literal perfection with his melodic and creepy delivery on most of the tracks. It's like Satanic Gospel music...if that could actually be a thing lol.

It's weird, because they capture that feeling of nostalgia so well, even though they're literally a band of this day and age. Maybe it's the way they record, or maybe it's their playing style, but whatever it is, I freaking love them for it.

That constant static/white noise in the background is really cool also. It makes the song feel like it's playing on some really old radio that just won't quite ever come in clear and I'm forced to listen to this awesomeness in lo-fi, but it's still so cool.

The ominous music, the atmospheric quality of the video, the strange plasma like energy covering the body of the humanoid creature in the video, that dramatic leap off of a cliff...a freaking leap off of a cliff...OFF OF A FUCKING CLIFF!!! WHOA! Maybe it's because I love experimental art like this, or it's just plain awesome, but this is so good.

The windmills in the beginning give this strange land a very industrial, machine-like, cold atmosphere. It's as if the humanoid creature is running towards a source of ""feeling"", a source of ""being"", some type of energy that makes you ""feel"" again, in what seems to be a dying world. As I watch it again and again, the emotion of the video starts to literally unfold before me and make me read a bit deeper into what it all means. I think that's the best part about this animation, is it's ability to get you thinking about what it all means to YOU. 

Butterfly is such a befitting title as well...it speaks to those of us who feel trapped, or slightly lost in life and hope that in the end, we emerge as something better, more developed and able to adapt to our ever changing world instead of feeling like a slave to it.

The distortion adds another aspect to what probably is simply an interview or something, but with the glitch, it feels like some sort of propaganda video made by some cyber terror group to infiltrate the minds of the masses through creepy messages and strange rules. 

It reminds me of something that would be in one of those futuristic, end of the world as we know it, kind of movies.

The beat is very light and almost folk/acoustic sounding at times. I think with such a strong message, you should compliment it with an equally strong beat.

Other than that, the melody, and recording is very well done. The mix is very clean and very clear which is a plus because the lyrics carry such a strong message, so great job with that!

At times, the guitar almost seems to be wailing in pain and despair and paired with that slow, almost sludge-like bass, it creates a really heavy and hopeless atmosphere. 

The lyrics are also very well done. They make it sound as if the singer just regrets ever getting himself into this situation at all and almost seems to wish he could just sleep off this darkness, but it doesn't seem to let up, which makes for a very interesting and emotionally charged song.

195,"This has to be one of the cleanest drum sounds I've heard in a while on a track that's classified as Nu-Metal. Especially one that doesn't use a drum machine in addition to the live drums. Usually the kick drum on a lot of metal records gets lost in the low end, but this track maintains that strong kick. Although the low end on this track isn't that heavy, it still has a power in the low end that you would think would bury the kick drum, but it doesn't. 

It's a great track though, I would have loved for the vocals to be a bit more harsh or lower like on some of Mastodon's tracks, but the higher vocal doesn't make it sound bad, just a bit emo lol.

The rolling arp bassline really makes the track fall into that heavy groove. I think if a standard bass was used, the groove wouldn't feel as constant or flow as smoothly as it does now using that arp style bass. Very creative.

The use of the different percussion setups from 0:44 onward is definitely an experimental choice that I wouldn't have thought to go with, but it works very well with adding a sense of movement and progression in the track.

I like the vocals a lot too, they sound a bit close, or maybe a bit loud, but that's an easy fix. The structure of the track is very cool and the breakdowns and build up is also very good.

The melodic aspect of the track is amazing, in my opinion. It really has a strong melody, especially with having such harsh vocals, the melody makes this track extremely easy to listen to. I've listened to it quite a few times already. 

From 2:52 onward is epic, that full melody and those growling vocals and what seems to be a background chorus effect is incredibly catchy and very haunting at the same time. It creates a really dark and powerful atmosphere that makes you have to keep listening and then hit replay lol.

The rubber, bouncey style bass really keeps the track moving forward and gives it that legit glitch hop low end groove. Those gurgle sounding synths are really creepy and cool at the same time lol.

So I totally understand your initial apprehension about the term ""Electro Metal"" lol. I'm glad you found it cool and enjoyed it. That means a lot, especially since I truly love metal and I don't wish to bring any shame to or gimmicky quality to the genre as a whole. I mainly listen to Nu-Metal/Alt Metal style bands though, and lots of 70's heavy metal, so my style has a bit of a vintage, groove quality to it. I like the death metal stuff too, but mainly for the heaviness and dark sound. I guess the electronic aspect comes in with my love of Glitch music and experimental/industrial stuff.

I never thought about using vocals, although I probably wouldn't because then it would actually sound like the cringe worthy ""garbage"" you mentioned in your comment lol. Maybe if I got the opportunity to produce an actual metal band using their own instruments, but having me arrange the music, that would be really cool and it wouldn't come off sounding like an electronic wannabe metal tune.

I think it's because we're spirits just occupying these physical bodies until we feel we're done experiencing this particular time and place and then we move on to the next. That's the reason I think we connect with things like this on a spiritual level, and probably why the ""intelligent mind"" cannot comprehend our attachment to such things.

It's no meant to be understood by ""intelligence"", you either understand it, or you don't. There's really no way to convince someone that it's real, until they've experienced it themselves, just like you and I.

208,"Thanks a lot for checking out my work. I really appreciate that!

Honestly, my tracks start with a riff. It helps build the track much faster. Once I lay down the riff, I build the drum around the guitar. Usually, the heavier the guitar riff, the more I stack the drums. Usually 3 snares, and 2 bass drums (1 just for attack) is what I like to use and then some live kick drums for low end. Once the drums and the guitars/bass are set, I just build from there. For Ghost Town, I just used 3 snares + a clap (for width) and 3 Bass drums (1 for attack), and a live double bass. 

The stacking creates impact depending on your attack, or top kick.",2016-09-19 03:01:48+00:00,d7sobwp,3.0,t1_d7slx4q,3571.0,ratemyband
209,"This is really, really cool! The thing that stands out the most to me on this track is the melodic aspect of it. It's literally drowning in melody from start to finish. It's not to the extent of a pop song, that's jammed packed with melody on every single beat, breakdown, and hook. The melody on this isn't so much that it takes away from the hard edge of the song, but it does tend to soften the song at certain points which make it sound a bit indie-rock, but still cool.

The vocals are also really clean and harmonize really well with the guitars and bass, which even keeps it's own melody at different times.

The mix of the track is REALLY impressive. The guitars are front in center, but the vocals pierce through without any trouble at all, and are extremely clear, even during the screams and growls. It sounds awesome! The only thing I would have liked to hear is the drums a bit louder and heavier. That kick drum sounds like just an attack for the bass guitar which makes the bass sound awesome, but it makes the kick sound flat. The snare drum sounds a bit muffled as well, which could be a recording issue or maybe it was purposefully tucked back into the mix, i don't know. Other than that, the track is amazing!

It's more than just an admiration for a particular time period, but it's more like the feeling you get when you move away from your childhood home and you're looking out of the car window at the only house you've really every known as you drive away. Eventually, you adjust to your new home, but one day, when you're older, you drive past your childhood home, and you can't help but feel that sense of nostalgia rushing back again. You feel complete when you see your old house and you begin to remember all the good things and bad things that happened there. Someone else probably lives there now, or maybe the city is preparing to tear the neighborhood down, either way you know you can't go backwards, but NOTHING can stop you from connecting emotionally to that place. It's just apart of you, and always will be.

Long explanation, but that's how it feels for me. I've been there before, I know it, and even if I can't return now, there's still comfort in knowing that it's apart of me and always will be.

213,"I don't listen to much hiphop, so I can't really compare this to anything, but production wise I can talk all day lol. 

I really enjoy the vintage quality of the drum sample used, if it is in fact a sample. You managed to keep the quality of the track sounding very raw and classic and extremely warm, extremely warm sounding! I don't know if it's the bass or the rhodes styled keys, but something about the overall mix of the track really keeps that vintage, vinyl sound, as if I'm listening to a jazz record and not a hiphop instrumental. That brings me to my next point. The jazz influences on this track are amazing. The rapid drumming and slight changes in time with the percussion make this thing sound awesome! It creates an almost nostalgic vibe, as if it is the theme song to some memory that I sit and think back on fondly. Very cool.

The mix, which is very good, just seems to be a little bit harsh to the keys. The highs in the keys are pretty distorted, but if this is the desired effect, than great job on that. It keeps the vintage aesthetic, as I mentioned earlier. 

Another thing I was wondering about is the drums. Have they been compressed? I think the track would have a much heavier impact if the drums stood out more prominent in the mix. I notice with a lot of hiphop instrumentals on reddit and soundcloud that have a more vintage sound, the drums on the track are never really heavy. I think maybe it's the style the producers are going for, but when making rhythm tracks, such as this, I would think you would want the drums to be very upfront in the mix. For example, when I listen to a track by Skrillex, his drums are massive and VERY in your face. They almost dominate the track and make you feel like every time the drums hit, something is exploding in your ears. I know that is electronic music, but the similarities between electronic music and hiphop aren't really that different and I never understood why a lot of the newer hiphop producers shy away from really heavy drum sounds. Not like the typical 808 sound, because to me, the 808 is not just a hiphop drum and can be used by practically anyone to give their track a perceived heaviness when really there's nothing more than a sub bass and 808 just carrying an already lackluster beat.

Anyway, other than the drum issue, I think this is a really solid instrumental and captures an extremely chill vibe. I've listened to this thing about 17 times now, so you definitely have a cool track here. I'll be replaying it more lol. It's very cool.

214,"I love the jangly, metallic sounding guitar. It gives such a raw energy to the track and makes the intro much more impactful (not sure if that's a word), to me.

The vocals seemed to be mixed very far back in the mix. I'm not sure if this was a stylistic choice or done unintentionally. It adds a bit of an odd atmosphere to the music, almost a haunting quality, and an eerie tone. If it was done unintentionally, then I probably would bring the vocals up a bit more in the mix and maybe take some of the highs off, because bringing it further forward in the mix may cause some distortion because I can already tell that the vocals were recorded really loud. Personally, I like the vibe that the vocals have being buried in the mix, but like I said, if you wish to fix that, then it should be an easy fix.

The melodic structure of the track, especially the vocal harmonies, give the music a real pop sound. I know that's probably blasphemy, with this being labeled as indie rock, but the harmony is really prominent at the 2:00 mark. It's really cool especially with such a dark sounding melody, to have that kind of strong melody and vocal blends going on.

The bass seems to also be mixed pretty low in this mix, but it's nothing that really throws off the sound. It's just that during the course of the song, without that low end, the high end takes a toll on your ears because it never lets up. Even when the guitars aren't working in the high end, the vocal is extremely at home in the high end of the mix and a bit more low end would take the strain off of the ears. As i mentioned before, if the lo-fi sound is the sound you're going for, I myself am a fan of the lo-fi sound, then please continue in this musical direction because it's awesome!

Overall, the track is really, really good and easy to listen to while doing other work without being distracted at all. Great post! Thanks for sharing!

For those to be drum samples and cuts/loops it sounds really fluid and very realistic! Keep up the great work, you definitely have great production/arranging skills.

Wow, thanks a lot for the compliment! Making music for video games is like my ultimate goal, and DOOM is so badass, so I really appreciate you saying that. I listen to A LOT of metal and experimental electronic music, so the two sounds just seem to come together in my music.

218,"The intro sounds very industrial, and extremely dark and heavy. Not heavy in the metal music sense, but like a heavy atmosphere. It makes me think of a vast dark forest, with black clouds swirling overhead and a thick fog rolling through, surrounding everything, making visibility almost impossible. There's laughter coming from your right, and shadows moving on your left, and you feel like the end is near. It's all so cool!

As the track progresses, the feelings of intensity increase and almost turn into panic when the snare drum starts to hit at such a machine like, but inconsistent tempo, it's all very creepy and yet totally engaging. The melodic structure of the track, which sounds more like a harmonic drone from hell, really sounds wide and very atmospheric and metallic. The melodic drone gives off a feeling of cold metal, almost like some metal cage locking you into a nightmare that you actually enjoy. It never lets up and literally feels like it's holding everything else in the track in place and keeping control over the situation. I think that's due to it being mixed very wide in the track and sounding as if it's coming at you from all sides (both left and right channels), along with what sounds like extremely heavy reverb, very awesome!

Overall, I think the tone, tempo, structure and arrangement of the sounds in this track are perfect! It creates the atmosphere that I believe it was made to create. My only negative comment is that I feel the cover art doesn't match the vibe of the track. I mean, when I see an abandoned house I instantly think about an Eminem song, or some hiphop gangster track. I think a more abstract, or even occult styled art piece would be better suited for this track, but that's just a small aesthetic issue, and nothing affecting the music. 

Great track, thanks for posting!

219,"I think the thing that makes this track sound as if it's muddy, is the fact that there isn't any variation to the melody. The constant groove, which is very good, never let's up or breaks in any way at all. So the sounds begin to blend together, making the mix sound incomplete, or like a demo.

Another thing would be the mix of the drums. Had this been an 8-bit track, the drums would be perfect! But seeing as this sounds more like a jazz/dance inspired tune, the kick drum sounds extremely flat, crushed, and almost non-existent. The same with the snare drum, it lacks any punch, so the track sounds more ambient and lo-fi, which is great if that's the sound you were going for, but not so great if it wasn't the sound you intended.

Mixing, in my opinion, won't solve anything because the sound selection itself is a bit off. If anything, re-mixing the track may well just enhance the flaws in the track. I would try choosing a different percussion setup first, and then getting that mix with the bass. Once you have that drum and bass groove, you'll almost automatically began to hear where the rest of the instruments, such as the piano and the synth harmonies are supposed to go, as far as left/right panning is concerned. Some things, like the high hats, need to be delayed and inverted to be heard on both the left and right channels, this will create a serious percussive groove that will get people dancing. Maybe adding a bit of bongos behind the bass and riding the rhythm of the piano would create a solid bounce. I think the piano should be added last and much of the low end on the piano needs to be cut, so it doesn't bleed with the bass, as it seems to be doing now.

Overall, I think the idea behind this track is very cool, and very jazz sounding, especially that bass line. Don't forget that, when producing, it all starts with picking the right sounds BEFORE you mix anything. Mixing is supposed to enhance an already great sound, but mixing doesn't make an ""ok"" song better.

I guess I can say it's good that you've at least found a way to deal with your mom, and still keep on your path.

I have to agree with you about feeling a bit darker though. I think that feeling comes from being aware of the darkness that is already around us, but as we do things in life to keep us happy, even if that happiness is synthetic, we almost forget that darkness is very active in our lives at all times. 

I think, maybe your encounter opened you up to the reality of what's real, sort of like pulling a veil from over your eyes. Just my opinion.

224,"This is incredible! The vocal, the almost grunge sound, but with an acoustic vibe, it's too good!

I think the thing that makes it stand out so much is the audible emotion in the vocal. The voice almost starts to melt with the guitar and create this swirling melody that sticks in your mind almost instantly. The drums are probably my second favorite thing about this track. They sound so loose and almost free form, unlike a lot of rock tracks today with the drumming sounding so computerized and compressed. The drumming reminds me a bit of Meg White's drum style during the White Stripes reign of rock awesomeness!

The mix of the track is also very well done. Nothing in the track sounds too low, too compressed, too distorted, or out of place and that's a great thing! Many songs I listen to either have very prominent drums burying the guitars and squashing the vocals, or very clear vocals and drums that sound like nothing more than clicks in the background. This, in my opinion is the perfect mix and perfect vibe.

Great track! Thanks for posting!

225,"That synth at 0:15 is just my style! Crunchy, raw, heavy, and distorted. I liked the track from the minute I heard it. I like the bounce of the track, it has an almost Big Room House bounce, reminds me of something Deorro might produce. Very cool. 

The mix of the track is very clean. Each synth can be heard extremely well, and that's why I think at times the track sounds a bit cluttered, because you can hear each part starting to move in it's own direction. For instance around 2:18, everything is happening, but it doesn't really sound cohesive. It sounds more like each instrument is fighting for a chance to play solo. It doesn't take away from the vibe of the track, as far as the bounce, but the melody is a little hard to follow, and with everything being about melody these days, some people may find it a bit frustrating.

Other than the mix sounding a bit cluttered in the middle half, the production is really, really cool. The bounce and dance vibe of the track turns into a full on march at the 3:35 mark, which is one my favorite parts. It's almost impossible not to nod your head, because the groove is so strong. It sounds like a march of victory lol. 

Overall, I really like your sound. You can definitely hear the ambient influences in your work with the BIG reverb soaked synths and the wide mix, allowing the track to sound larger than life and extremely vast and endless.

226,"I don't think the theory is stupid at all. It would actually explain a lot of our behaviors as humans, especially our reactions to certain aesthetics, and people as you mentioned. Lots of people connect with certain times (era's), certain types of people, even certain places in the world that they happen to visit, and I personally think it has a lot to do with your ""theory"". 

I myself am extremely attracted to the dark side of the 19th century, funeral fashion, horror, poetry and especially the occult side of things during that time. There have been instances where I've had strange dreams that took place in the 19th century, particularly the 1840's (during the Victorian era) and that has affected me, mostly in the way I dress. I connect so much with that time, as if I've literally lived during the period, and have a deep longing to return.

A lot of people write it off as being simply goth and liking the funeral attire of that time, but for me, it has a lot to do with your theory. I guess I've explained all of this just to simply say that, in my opinion, the idea of pasts lives is more than just a theory, but an actual possibility. I mean, it would explain a lot of confusion and difficulty some people have with connecting to their current life, trends, family situations, and overall understanding of the time in which they live in now.

228,"The groove on this is unreal! Very, very funky! That bassline is heavy and literally drives this entire track forward. I also like the 80's pop snare drum fills every couple of bars. The track also has a bit of an 80's electro (hiphop) bounce to it. Kind of like that song ""Planet Rock"" with the way it sort of bounces along in a classic funk inspired way. 

The disco vibes are pretty strong on this track too. With the bass guitar acting like more of a percussion instrument along with the kick drum, the song has that solid ""stomp"" type of groove that most classic disco records have, using the four on the floor technique and this emulates that perfectly, even without using that exact technique.

I think the mid range vocal adds a bit of uniqueness to the track. At first I didn't think it would fit, but I think a much higher pitched vocal would have made the track sound a bit gimmicky and less serious, which would have ruined the song, in my opinion. So i actually prefer the mid-range vocal. Especially the slight whisper on the back end of the voice. It conveys the emotion necessary to give the song that legit late night funk vibe. Very cool!

Overall, solid track, incredible mix, and very awesome vibes. Thanks for sharing!

231,"That intro is amazing. It has such a vintage sequencer feel, and it's thick as fuck! The track actually has a very retro vibe overall, accept for that snare drum. It sounds really crisp and the attack is so punchy. The way that lead synth moves around the track makes it feel like you're traveling through a tunnel made of light, like a scene straight out of TRON.

I really like the atmospheric vibe of the track also. It plays even more on the vintage feel and sound of the track and the spaced out, almost psychedelic tone of the music. 4:22 sounds like an intro to a deadmau5 track and then it drops into that hard techno sounding beat with the sequencer fading in and taking over, wow, it's all so cool!

The mix of the track is also very well done. It has a squashed, compressed quality about it, but maintains that wide and sort of ambient aesthetic, which could be because of the use of those lo-fi sounding synths, but i think it has a lot to do with the way the melody is structured. It seems to call for various other sounds and synth lines to give it that driving sound. The track takes an almost 8-bit sound quality around the 5:17 mark, but it doesn't lose the techno vibe, really great work with that.

This is definitely a very creative and very well produced track. Thanks for sharing. Great post!

232,"Wow! This track has such a dark, and slow atmosphere. It almost sounds like the beat is moving through some sort of thick, heavy toxic sludge, barely keeping time. At 1:13 that snare drum sounds like a splash of acid hitting the pavement on some industrial cyberpunk construction site in the future. It's really cool. 

The melody is extremely creepy and oddly emotional, and really adds to the aesthetic of the video and strange mood that it has. Some elements of the mix remind me a bit of noise music and ambient. I'd have to say, my favorite part of the track is 3:40 when everything falls into mono. The stereo image of the track seems to fall into some deep, dark, black hole of confusion and eerie atmosphere and the mono signal creates an extreme sense of suspense in the track. Very cool!

Overall, I think this is one of the best experimental tracks I've heard in quite some time. It has elements from bands like Ulver, and Kraftwerk in regards to noise, but keeps a strong synthpop tone and great vibe. Thanks for sharing. Awesome post!

233,"This is really a groovy instrumental track, especially with the bells added into the melody. It reminds me a lot of an old Shalamar record, or one of those mid 70's disco smash hits. That melodic structure is very uplifting sounding and almost nostalgic at times. The mix is also very warm sounding, it may be due to the particular sounds you chose to use, but I think it's more of a mixing thing. The mix sounds quite thick, as if it was mixed on an analogue desk and not on a computer. Very cool sound. 

My only critique with this beat is the fact that the kick drum is so flat. It doesn't seem to have any body, or power behind it. I mean, the sub bass picks up the slack at times during the track, but at some points in the beat, it's pretty obvious that the kick isn't heavy enough to stand alone without that sub bass. I just think the track would have much, much more impact and ""bounce"" if that kick drum hit harder and heavier. It may be just a sidechain issue though. Maybe if you sidechain a bit harder, something I usually never suggest lol, but in this case it may help a lot. I think that breakdown at 1:19 would sound awesome if that kick was more powerful, and the mix wouldn't sound so drowned out by the sub bass, which I assume is only happening because of the kick drums lack of attack and sustain.

Overall, this is a very, very, very cool beat and sounds basically ready for someone to rap over it. The mix sounds vintage, and warm, the melodic structure is solid, and the vibe of the track is very cool. Thanks for sharing!

234,"Sorry for such a late reply. i've been pretty busy working on various different tracks myself. It seems to eat away at the hours of my days pretty quickly, anyway, here i am lol.

I've listened to the new mix of Behemoth a few times and i can definitely hear quite a difference, or what i perceive as a difference. 

At the 1:00 mark, the track feels a lot more compact and tighter and quite a bit heavier. It really sounds great! that bass synth sounds a bit grittier as well, almost slightly distorted. the same with the intro synth at the 0:15 mark. Did you add a distortion effect, or was this the result of more compression? That seems to add some distortion often times when the compression is heavily applied. Either way, it really gives the track a much, much harder edge. with a title like ""Behemoth"" you'd want the track to sound almost angry, and monstrous, which is really does.

That outro melody at 3:19 is massive! now that REALLY sounds like a gigantic Behemoth stomping down the street tearing shit up! lol very cool.

Overall, i think you did an excellent job with the slight changes made. It's funny how compression and just a little bit of effects can turn a track around so quickly. The track was already amazing to begin with, but now it just has more ""bite"" to it. awesome track man. Thanks again for sharing!

235,"that intro synth is so awesome! the entire intro up until 0:30 reminds me of something out of a zelda game.

that bass is hardcore trap for sure. it rolls along so incredibly and almost seems to add an entirely different vibe to the main melody. the noise effects are definitely my favorite. it reminds me of a lot of beats made by Arca (FKA Twigs producer). he uses a lot of different sound effects to create certain atmospheres and aesthetics on a track.

the mix on this is also incredibly well done. the bass sits solid in the middle, but drifts left as well, creating this sense of motion as the other sounds pan in and out from left to right. a lot of people don't utilize effects on the bass, but this is a great example of how well effects can improve the sound of a certain type of track.

236,"i really like the melody on this track, and the 80's pop style drum fills. the way the track is arranged is sort of like a trap song, turned into a dance-pop track and loaded with a bunch of lo-fi synths, it's really cool. the crunchy lead synth reminds me of something that The Weeknd would sing on, and the track also has that slight darkness atmosphere that a lot of The Weeknd's track's tend to have. the mix of the track is cloudy, and really mystical in the way it sounds, which adds a lot of emotion to it. to me, it gives me the feeling of walking in the rain at night with nowhere to go, just walking.

i think the only thing that stops me from loving the track is the fact that the sidechain is so aggressive. i know sidechain is necessary especially when using heavier bass kicks, but this sidechain is so aggressive that it seems to dip well beyond the range of the kick drum and sounds like someone is just playing with the volume knob at times. other than that, it's a really great melody and a great vibe captured in this track.

the vibe kind of reminds me of porter robinson's earlier work. like his spitfire EP, but this seems to have a lot more 8-bit influences and sounds though, which i think is really awesome. 8-bit Electro needs a bit more light shined on it, because it's a really cool sound.

243,"that kick drum at 1:00 is epic! the low end is relentless on your ears and instantly gives the track a very heavy and powerful feel. it sounds as if, at first, this could have easily been a Big Room track, especially with the amount of room left in the mix. the mix of the drums against the synths sounds very wide, which is always a great thing, but since you were going for a more electro sound, you may want to bring the mix a little closer together with a little gluing maybe. i think adding more sounds would just muddy up the mix and make an already great sounding collection of sounds start to sound like a random group of nonsense. 

the atmosphere of the track is top notch! it has a real metallic quality, kind of machine, or industrial sounding. that may be because of the more aggressive bass synths you chose to use, or it could be that almost air-horn sounding lead melody. either way, you managed to create a really strong, upbeat, party-like atmosphere with this track, which you should be proud of. a lot of producers tend to want there tracks to sounds a certain way, so they name it something wild sounding and try to use big sounding leads and harsh kicks to create an atmosphere that just isn't ever really there, causing their tracks to sound flat, but this track is very well produced.

my only criticism, as i mentioned before, is the width of the mix and maybe the compression/fx on the sounds you chose. you are definitely going for that Electro sound, so you want a more aggressive sounding, slightly squashed mix that sounds really tight, and almost robotic. this mix sounds so clean and wide, that it would make someone think that somethings off about it, especially if it's supposed to be Electro.

overall, very great track, and very, very well mixed/produced sound. thanks for sharing!

244,"wow! this is truly amazing! the lyrics are literal art! ""...i'm reading you a letter, i hope you hear"" is such a great line!

your voice is very reminiscent of the guys from the band America. especially with your ability to blend your vocals perfectly with the softness of the acoustic guitar and the light electric sounds. your voice has a bit of a whisper when you sing, it may be just because you chose to sing a bit softer with this track, but even during the moments of the song where you show your power and vocal range, your voice maintains a very gentle, comforting, and extremely confident quality as you express the words with true intent. very, very cool.

the thing, to me, that makes the song really shine is the time signature and the almost start/stop feel of the song as it moves along. the change in pace really adds the emotion of the track and allows certain lyrics to really hit home and stick in your mind. like around 1:47 when you say ""don't tear down churches, fill em true, good as new"", that line will probably forever be stuck in my mind because the tempo literally slows down just to highlight this part of the song, making it's impact on the listener that much more powerful. a lot of musicians don't understand the importance of tempo or tempo change when writing music, and how something so simple as slowing down a portion of a song, or speeding up another portion of a song could be the difference between an ok demo track and an unbelievably epic sounding song, such as this.

there's a true emotional journey going on throughout this entire track and the melodic structure, percussion style, and tempo all work together to make that story shine amazingly bright through the lyrics.

please continue to make music, you have true talent.

245,"i really like this melody! the quality of the recording actually adds to the sound, in my opinion. the melody has a really sad vibe to it while still maintaining a pleasant overall groove. it kind of reminds me of a person who is extremely depressed, but they just continue smiling as they go about their everyday life, in order to not appear beaten up by the world and their life's circumstances. 

the change in tempo and the intensity with which you begin to play, as the melody moves forward, really gives off a sense of stress and anxiousness. it begins to sound as if this will be the last melody you'll every play...it's really cool how a simple melody can reveal so much, well, at least to me anyway.

you should really think about making instrumental/acoustic music tracks. you definitely seem to have the ability to capture the emotion necessary to keep the music interesting, and very dynamic. thanks for sharing this :)

247,"i think the video adds to the creepy, yet emotional atmosphere of this song. it's like a nightmare, set to a really beautiful piece of soundtrack music meant to evoke a sense of desperation and hopelessness inside of you and almost scare you to death. 

the pain and suffering displayed in the video is literally expressed equally as heavy in the haunting melody that sweeps across most of the track. the melody sounds like it almost wants to began to sound uplifting, but then immediately takes a turn back downwards and pulls you back into the hell that you're destined to live through as you listen to the song. very disturbing, yet very cool aesthetic.

the singers voice is also equally haunting. moving in and out and barely audible at times, leaving you left with simple melodic whispers and words increasing the feeling of emptiness.

really great piece of music and an even greater piece of art when paired with the video. thanks for sharing!

the digital drums, the fully synth setup, and rises and falls in the track, even the buildups, it all screams pre-electro house. very cool. the only thing it's missing is the really heavy, thick saw wave synth and a riser fx lol.

250,"even though this track is titled ""heaven sent"", it has a real dark quality about it. the melody gets really dark at some points in the track and really captures the mood of the artwork, with a real nocturnal vibe against an upbeat groove.

i really like the way the synths have an 80's keytar sound and use almost a van halen inspired playing style with the quick notes in secession. the vocals are also pretty cool. the singers lower range adds to the night-time vibe and darker edge of the track. the use of the auto-tune helps keep the vibe very electro, almost robotic instead of going in a more pop direction, which could have easily happened had the auto-tune effect not been used. also, at times it sounds like the vocal is used as an additional synth to blend with the melody, which a very awesome production technique.

overall, this is a very cool track, even with the downtempo aspect of it, i could hear it being played in a club for sure. great work! thanks for sharing!

251,"maybe i stand alone with this statement, but i've never taken beatport seriously as a place to find good music. i've always viewed the site as a sort of ""pissing contest"" for major label artists to show how many times they can rig the system to gain a ""number 1"" spot. i guess if one aspires to be respected by the current ""EDM"" gatekeepers and ghost produced, button pressing dj's, than one should take beatport as a serious source of quality music.

then again, i've always preferred discovering music naturally rather then having some top 10's list tell me what i should be listening to. kind of reminds me of the way the radio works nowadays. play some shit 400 times a day, get it stuck in peoples head and convince them it's awesome...viola!...hit song!

253,"wow! ""Lorn"" is a pretty awesome track! at times it sounded like a cross between thrash and metal, especially 1:14 to 1:23. it's extremely energetic.

the vocals are also very interesting. the singer reminds me a bit of Jonathan Davis with his ability to go from an absolutely insane scream to an amazingly controlled melodic vocal almost instantly, it's very cool.

the mix of the guitars is probably my favorite part. they sound really low and aggressive yet flow extremely will with the melodic aspects of the track and seem to wrap around the singers voice perfectly, giving the vocal an even more haunting and painful quality to it. the way the guitars sound actually make me imagine a massive wall made out of broken glass suddenly collapsing onto a crowd and ripping everyone to shreds leaving a pile of bloody awesomeness!

256,"whoa!!! this is incredible!!! it has such a nightmarish, horror, hauntingly beautiful quality about it. it reminds me a lot of an Arca production. especially with all the noise and the extremely low bass tones.

the sweeping snare dragging along and feeling like it's drowning in toxic sludge, barely able to keep up, but continuing to crawl along the track with this slow and heavy stomp is absolutely amazing! the random gurgles and growls moving across the left and right channels create this sense that you're surrounded by some disgusting extraterrestrials ready to pounce and kill you at any moment, it's so creepy and yet so engaging!

my absolute favorite part is the series of lo-fi static at 1:36-1:46 along with that barely audible whisper. it feels like the end of the hellish nightmare, that you actually want to have again lol. 

the fact that the track never really gets going melodically is really a big plus, because it adds the noise aspect of the track and gives the random fx and odd percussion techniques a chance to really shine and show just how amazingly well produced this track really is.

259,"after listening to these set of tracks, i have to say that your sound is really solid as a singer-songwriter. in my opinion, you shine much brighter on the acoustic tracks. you have a really strong voice that pairs extremely well with the guitar, especially since your voice has a slight bass sound and not the typical high pitched falsetto that many singer-songwriters try to go for these days. your approach reminds me a lot of bob dylan as far as the tone of your voice with the guitar. 

you seem to have a really good ear for matching a warmer sound and set of chords with your voice. i think this is really showcased on your track ""18 Hours in Madrid"". the entire track feels like a sunny afternoon, relaxing out on the balcony watching the ocean. well, that's how it makes me feel. the chords and arrangement on this track seems a lot more full and a bit heavier on the low end, and your voice sits right on top of the melody creating this sort of 'wall of sound' effect, even thought it's just you and the guitar. it doesn't sound flat, like a lot of typical acoustic performances tend to do.

as far as songwriting, i think you have a really good ability to tell a great story through music. your songs don't seem to be kept afloat with a bunch of ""filler"" lines and lyrics just to keep a song going. again, i have to refer to ""18 Hours in Madrid"", when you sang the line ""i'm forced to fight, things i can't understand"". that line hits home for me and probably many other people, i'm sure. that's the kind of intimate lyrics that make great songs, so i don't think you have an issue when it comes to songwriting.

i think the songs where you use a full band, such as the track ""Pain"", are cool, but your voice tends to get lost in the sounds of the other instruments and the uptempo/dance vibe doesn't seem to display the full ability of your voice, in my opinion. many times it just felt like you were just keeping up with the tempo and not really giving any real emotion to the lyrics compared to tracks like ""18 Hours in Madrid"" and Calico, which is also a very, very cool song!

overall, i think you're really talented, and it's just a matter of music style moving forward with your sound, because the ability to make great music and perform is already something you have. maybe if i heard a studio version of one of your uptempo tracks, i could get a better sense of how that style fits you.

thanks for sharing. the music is awesome!

it's not often that songs with such a minimalist approach sound this full and wide, but the mix of this song sounds huge and yet still gives you the feeling of being in an empty room all alone. it really is an extremely emotional sounding track. very cool and very well performed and produced. thanks for sharing!

261,"first of all, you're awesome for wanting to do this for your friend. a lot of people need small things like that, to keep them motivated to keep creating. i understand you not wanting them to know it's you, as that may feel like a pity purchase, but the act of kindness may override that initial emotion. 

maybe if you create a new account, as the poster before me mentioned earlier, you could be more anonymous. the only thing attached to their receipt would be your email as long as you DO NOT add your first or last name anytime during the purchase or if you sign up to receive alerts for future releases from your friend, just put in the new email that you've created and you'll be fine.

something as awesome as this gesture would really be a boost to your friend, in my opinion. as i said before, being an indie musician is not only hard financially, but mentally you can often question yourself about continuing on such an uncertain and often times reward-less path, so even if 1 person supports what you do, in any way, that alone could be the very act of kindness that pushes you to move forward with your career. as an indie musician, i know that feeling all too well. 

anyway, let me know how it goes if you decide to do this. you're definitely one awesome friend :)

262,"i immediately fell in love with that kick drum. the slight low end rumble on it is so cool. the groove on this track is also very infectious. reminds me a lot of the kind of grooves that Yuksek creates.

the synths are very heavy and warm sounding. almost like hot metal moving in a factory to a very strict rhythm, never missing a beat, it sounds amazing! as the track progresses, it has a bit of a ghetto house feel. the pitched down vocals add a real club aspect to the track which i think gives it a harder edge and effect, as you listen through it.

the mix of the track is also very well done, especially the way the sounds move across the both the left and right channels, creating this slight sense of confusion and disorientation as if you're just spinning wildy in the club, dancing to this track. that's what i like most about the track.

i would love to have heard some various synths in the track along with the arp sounding synth, to add some dynamics and change up the pace a bit, but the driving force behind the main portion is quite enough to keep you interested, especially with that time signature.

my favorite part of this is definitely 3:30 and beyond. the complex cuts between sounds and the way some of the synths act as percussion instruments as well is totally cool!

the singers voice is really relaxing as well, and sounds almost like a soft sensual whisper with loads of passion. her voice really fits the track perfectly! it literally melts with the atmosphere of the track and makes it feel like a real nocturnal, doom inspired, gothic anthem with hiphop flavor. 

i was unsure how i would like the strings on the track, but as the track builds the strings are an amazing addition to the already highly eclectic sound. the strings also add a bit of class, making it feel less like a standard pop song and more like a soundtrack piece of music for a really intense night scene in a movie. i like it a lot.

 the mix of the track is also really cool. the various sounds move around and pan very well, giving the track a very spacious feel. even though there's a lot going on, instrument wise, the track still feels really atmospheric and almost stripped down to barely nothing. that's definitely due to the mix being so wide.

i'm also really a fan of the mixing work on this track, overall. the track seems to be really well spread out, allowing it to sound BIG. especially during the rises and falls in the track. it allows every aspect and small detail of the track to be heard clearly.

my only complaint with the track would be the drums. they seem to be mixed pretty low and don't really have a strong impact. this may be due to a side-chaining issue though and not the drum mixing at all, or maybe it's that 808 bass that isn't side-chained at all, or at least sounds like it's not, i don't know. but i think if the drums were a little louder, they would have a real impact on the energy of the track and make it a real floor banger.

283,"superrrrrrr groovy!!!!! wow! i wasn't expecting this much bounce from a pop-rock song. the track actually has A LOT of pop appeal. i could see a lot of people singing this track, it's very, very catchy! the mix of the track is extremely well done and very clear. the acoustic guitar doesn't get lost in the track at all. i often hear a lot of tracks that use an acoustic guitar as a lead and by the time the song gets really going, the acoustic isn't even there anymore, but this track keeps the acoustic loud and proud right up front which almost gives it a folk quality.

the percussion is very funky, to use that term, as well. it really makes you nod your head with the heavy use of the bass drum creating that almost jazz inspired groove. i really, really like it.

i know this is a demo, but it sounds really clean and almost radio ready as is. i can't wait to hear the finished version, let me know when you release it, i need this track!

thanks for posting, very great work!

284,"""heavy"" is the first word that comes to mind when i listen to this project. not in the heavy metal sense, but a heavier punk sound. not as light and unfocused as standard punk, but heavier and with much more intent and lots of skill. especially those drums, wow! the lyrical content and the melodic structure of the project just takes on a dark tone at many points on the project, which i find quite enjoyable.

it seems like no matter what's being played, there's an emphasis on making it sound harder than expected and i think a lot of people will enjoy that in your music. the vocals sounds slightly pained and sad, and full of emotion which i really like. it adds a lot of character to the music and makes the stories really hit home with the listener. a lot of times, singers tend to want to show off their ability to hit certain notes or display their vocal range and forget that the song should have some rawness and some heart within it, but these tracks are literally jam packed with emotion and dramatic playing.

my favorite track is definitely ""deathbed"". it sounds so raw and really angry and it reflects in the playing style as well. another part of the track that i really like is the change in tempo which really makes the track feel like it's dying, or running out of steam and completely about to give out. this, accompanied with the singers vocals becoming more stressed and strained and desperate, just make the track so awesome! it's been a while since i've heard a track with that much heart. it reminds me of the way Ozzy sang on ""Hand of Doom"" as he described a drug overdose in such detail and with such pain that it pulls you in. along with the changes in tempo. very cool!

overall i like this project a lot. at first i wanted to question the mix and recording quality of the project, but as you listen more and more to it. the distortion and lo-fi quality of the project just enhances the power of the songs and adds another layer of darkness to the already very dark tone of the music.

very awesome work! thanks for sharing!

285,"after listening to the project, i'm really hooked! the vocals are really cool and relaxing. the singer reminds me a lot of Billie Joe Armstrong, especially on the track ""Piece"", which is my favorite track btw. but i'll talk about that later.

melodically, the album seems to flow perfectly from track to track. consistently delivering light, breezy, almost nostalgic melodies and chord progressions. i think that's the thing that makes 'More Excuses' so infectious. it sounds like an album that you're already comfortable listening to, as if you've heard it before. it may be due the extremely relaxing tone of the album overall, or just the way the singer effortlessly delivers line after line of perfect harmonies. the vocals and the music almost melt together at times and it's really cool.

""Piece"" is definitely my favorite track on the album, by far! maybe it's just me, but it sounds as if it's the most well mixed and produced of all the songs. it sounds like everything came together perfectly on that track. from the vocals, and the drum mix to the guitar harmonies. all are very, very clear and sound really balanced. being a producer, i listen for balance in almost all of the music i hear these days, just a habit i guess. anyway, the balance is amazing. the track mix literally feels like it's wrapping around you, especially when you listen with headphones. it has a warm sound to it, slightly vintage sounding as well and the lyrics are great! i think the musicianship overall on the project is top notch, but ""Piece"" feels as if everyone just relaxed and said ""let's make a great song"", well, that's the vibe i get from it. the vocals sit amazingly in the middle of the track and sound extremely clear and powerful, all the while keeping a very mellow presence in the song.

i really enjoy the project as a whole, especially the melodic flow of it. which is pretty rare to get from bands today as they seem to approach albums like a mixed bag of singles with completely different styles and sounds and barely no cohesion at all.

http://funeralcasket.bandcamp.com

**This is my latest release titled *""Rusty Razor""*. I've posted here in the melting pot a few times before, but for those of you who are unfamiliar with my music, my style is *Electro Metal* wit a bit of Glitch. It's mainly a style that was inspired by my love of metal and goth rock and electronic music. as far as metal, my biggest influence is black sabbath and Justice was literally the reason i started making electronic music in the first place and probably what inspired my ""chopping""/glitch technique. this is my 8th release so far, and i have much more music coming!**

**i would love to know what you guys think of it. my friend *Masanori* helps me out a lot with recording guitar riffs. a lot of the riffs i write require some skill beyond my own lol. they usually start after playing around with a few chords and building from there. i tend to write darker riffs that sit in the mid range. i like how the mid's sound with distortion so most of my riffs sit in that pocket. anyway, let me know what you guys think and i'll be sure to check out your music as well and give some feedback in the mean time.**

290,"such an awesome quote!! honestly music should be viewed that simply by everyone. 

thanks a lot! Justice was literally the reason i started producing music. after i heard their ""Cross"" album i knew i wanted to do that. before that i mainly listened to metal and goth rock/punk. black sabbath, motorhead, iron maiden, and a lot of siouxsie and the banshees, velvet underground, the cure, joy division, lou reed and a little bit of soft cell. i always wanted to combine the 3 sounds (goth, metal, electronic) into something i loved. that's were the whole ""electro metal"" idea came from, for me. 

btw, after listening to your song ""This Day"", i'm sure your genre should be Pop/Folk. that song is incredibly well written and amazingly performed. you guys use acoustic guitar perfectly in my opinion. it's as if you use the acoustic guitar along with the voice to set the emotional tone for a song and it allows the percussion to pull you into the groove but not too aggressively. in ""This Day"" i really enjoy how the drums follow the melodic structure which creates this smooth wall of sound behind the voice. it feels like the music on this particular song is floating, the way it's mixed and arranged. sorry if i'm going to deep into the music, but as a producer, i really love when sounds are well mixed and structured in a certain way to evoke certain emotions. anyway, the song reminds me a lot of some vintage Crosby, Still, and Nash, and even a little bit of America. especially their song ""Sister Golden Hair"". Do you write the songs? or do you all write them as a group? now that i think about it, i never asked you what instrument you play in the band, or even your name? my apologies. I don't hear too many songs these days that tell really well thought out stories accompanied by deeply emotional music. that's probably why all of my musical influences come from older artists lol. There just seems to be a certain aesthetic that artists from back in the day seemed to be able to capture in the music and lyrics, and spread to everyone without using a certain ""look"" or gimmick to rope people in. nothing against my gothic rock/industrial hero's (whom i adore), but many of the artists looked like normal guys from the neighborhood who just so happened to be extremely talented.

also, i'm going to follow you guys on twitter because i'd really like to keep up with you all. i seriously am a fan :)

296,"hey, thanks for sharing your work. i was really excited to take a listen, as i'm always looking to hear new music from new artists.

Gold Clouds is really cool. it reminds me a lot of something that would have landed on the Hotline Miami soundtrack. it has a real 8-bit, video game quality about it. even down to the way you mixed it. it sounds really crunchy and dark at times and really mechanical. i guess i could say borderline dark electro, but with less harsh noise and distortion. the structure of the track also really cool as well. the ""drop"" happens so far into the song that it gives the flow of the track a great dynamic and really allows things to sound as if they're building on each other. i think the only other person i've known to drop tracks at 1:30 and make it sound good was Porter Robinson on his Spitfire EP, before the whole ""Worlds"" stuff started happening. Anyway this sound that you have on this track, even it was by accident, is very cool and it's something i would explore moving forward. The Synthwave/Retrowave style may be a perfect fit for you.

Diamond Eclipse is very awesome! the intro is extremely groovy and well thought out. the bassline starts off very fat and wide but leaves just enough room for the drums and clap to pound through and get you dancing. it reminds me a lot of the club style from the 90's, but again with a more 8-bit, video game sound to it. i'm not sure if it's the drums you use or the compression or the way you mix everything, but the sound is really distinct and very retro/vintage. the mix is significantly wider on this track than the on Gold Clouds, and that's very good because the dynamics of the track can be heard much more clearly, including the attack (pop) on the lead synth, which i really like. overall the track seems to go in a very Bass House direction, and slightly Big Room, but with a lot less reverb. are the sounds you're using presets? or are you designing these sounds yourself? either way, it's pretty cool.

Thoughts definitely sounds Progressive House to me, out of the 3. instantly, you can hear the clear mix of the electro style piano keys. the synth that comes in at 0:30 is a bit muddy though, maybe it's not sidechained? it kind of sounds a bit loud and ""stuck"" in the center. it never falls under the beat like i assume you would have wanted it to. so it kind of drowns out the drums, but i like the sound itself, just probably needs to be turned down a bit and maybe sidechained? the breakdown at 2:15 is incredible. that melody is infectious! great work on that. the reverb and width of the synths is also perfect on this track compared to the other 2 tracks. like i said before, the only thing i would suggest is making the bass fit more ""snug"" into your tracks so the low end can fill out the track and really make it sound like a club banger.

overall, i like you production style, and once you get a few more mixing techniques down, you'll be on your way man. great work!

297,"i suppose you're right. it just seems awfully strange how the two simply mimic each others production style instead of moving forward towards a fresh sound and slightly implementing sounds inspired by each other. i, myself, don't work too closely with other producers, so i'm not sure if working in close quarters or even on a few collaborative projects would be enough to make one producer take on the style and melodic structure of another, but maybe it's possible. 

Justice, who was influenced by Daft Punk, being under the same manager (busy p) as them at one time, simply built on the groove structures that Daft Punk made popular with their album Discovery, but Justice went in a more downgraded, distorted, almost unmixed, and much more aggressive direction. The influence of Daft Punk was totally obvious, but the sound was all their own. I'm referring more to their debut album ""Cross"", as their more recent stuff is almost a complete copy of what Daft Punk is doing these days, in my opinion. Their new track ""Safe and Sound"" literally sounds like it could have been on Random Access Memories, aside from the signature Justice style vocal on the track.

Once again, i believe you're correct, but i'm still confused as to what would be deemed ""inspired by"" and what should be labeled as ""copying""...i don't know.

298,"i see what you mean when you say some people think it's uncool. i think it's only because a lot of people think that ""pop"" means less effort, time or thought was put into the process of making the song. almost like popcorn music, or bubblegum music. i agree with you, pop just means it's popular and connects with everyone, but with music becoming so accessible these days, it's like more and more serious bands and artists are going for more a niche market with true supporters and fans so they can develop a solid following and in their minds give meaning to what they're doing. i understand both sides.

302,"really, really, really, really sounds like madeon, but lo-fi, sort of like a madeon demo or something. it's really strange how much it sounds like a madeon demo. i'd have to say, maybe the producer is influenced by madeon a little?

the mix is really edgy, the lo-fi/demo quality is a nice touch, especially if it was the desired effect. the vocals are a bit bright though. the high's of the singers voice gets to be harsh at certain points in the song. almost sounds distorted during the chorus section of the track. i think it may not be a mixing issue, but maybe a mastering issue when the overall loudness was increased. the vocals just needed to be lowered a bit.

the bass/low end of the track is amazingly mixed though. it sits squarely in the center of the track and just punishes you with every kick drum slam. i also really like how the distorted synth fits with the percussion. it gave the intro a real video game sound.

i'd love to hear this track without vocals and see how the tone of it changes. it sounds as if it would have went into a darker direction, especially with all the aggressive synth melodies, but the vocal took the track in a more ""pop"" direction. i enjoy it, but i'm just interested in how it would sound without the vocal.

overall, great track and really solid melodic work.

304,"almost immediately it sounds like a cross between folk and country. i think the really jingly guitars add to the country aesthetic to be honest. the rhythm is pretty folk, to me, but the tempo and the vocal inflections are really pop. almost like alanis morrissette, or jewel. i guess using those 2 as reference, this would be alternative rock/indie.

305,"this track literally feels like a journey. everything happens so insidiously and the mix of the track feels like it's in constant motion all around you. especially if you listen to it with headphones. i like the ""muted"" drum sounds around 1:10. it adds to the dreamlike atmosphere of the track, but also gives it a solid feel. the percussion does a good job of evoking a sense of coldness and rigidness to the otherwise airy and very free flowing vibe of the track. it kind of breaks everything up and makes it feel unfinished, which i really like.

the massive wall of melody that comes in around 3:13 is really great. it's like the perfect finale to this unsettling journey through sound, and it feels like it's closing in around you as the bass just stomps down the middle and the ambient synth sounds drift and fade away.

very cool production. great post!

307,"sorry if my feedback isn't detailed on this particular set of tracks. i don't listen to a lot of trap so i really have nothing to compare it to, and can only speak about what i personally like about the music.

the best one, to me, is the team instinct (spark mix). it has a really eerie quality about it. almost jumbled up and confused and bordering experimental ambient with the atmosphere, very cool!

the bass is really nice as well, although it sounds a bit bouncy, sort of rubbery on each beat switch up, if that makes sense. i don't know if that was the desired effect, but that's what i hear. it's cool, to me. 

that blast beat ball of confusion beat (the only words i can use to describe it), that comes in at 2:29 is incredible and very ear grabbing. it's total chaos, but produced in a really cool way. it's actually one of my favorite parts of the mix! my other favorite moment is definitely 9:16. that beat is so strange and creepy and sort of industrial. it just sounds like something that you'd hear in a mental institution and the way it's gets all messy around 10:00 is crazy!

oddly enough, had i not known that dada life made this track, i would have thought it to be a tiesto production. the progressive house feels are really thick on this one lol.

**as far as the mix, everything seems to sit in the center for the most part. it gives it a really cool lo-fi feel, but i think if you spread the mix out a bit it would really give the track a much bigger feel and would definitely bring out the awesomeness of that dreamscape sound that you have going around 2:17.**

**great track though, thanks for sharing!**

314,"So i've been listening to your track this morning and i have to say the atmosphere of it really has an affect on getting this done. i mean, i was doing a few things around the house and the driving sound of the track felt like it was literally pushing me forward to finish my tasks. very cool!

the intro has a really steampunk/industrial feel to it. almost like a giant gothic train preparing to roll out of the station and embark on a deadly trip down a track full of evil obstacles. around the 0:44 mark it reminds me of a machine clicking and starting up, most likely the gothic train engine.

1:13 literally feels like a launch. seriously, the way it just drives forward with that lead synth relentlessly buzzing is really bad ass. the wide claps at 1:55 just add more to the massive machine that's already in motion, giving it a feeling of being something that's simply unstoppable. 

i like the vocal sample as well, it breaks up the track a bit, but not so much that it sounds like we've started on a completely different journey, but more so feels like this evil train ride that we're on is beginning to calm a bit, perhaps going through a twisted tunnel of complete darkness. the change in pace around 2:57 makes the track feel like it's spiraling downwards into almost complete chaos. the samples are spread very wide across the mix which really creates a sense of confusion, for me at least, and i enjoy that kind of tension and uncertainty in a track. the samples are literally swirling around your head, but they're not to punchy in the ear. they actually add to the hectic atmosphere. i honestly don't think this part of the track would be this dynamic had you not used the vocal samples. 

the 4:00 mark is incredible! the distortion is perfect, but not too heavy as to mess up the flow of the track. and you use the vocals in the center which i think was a good choice rather than spreading them out and making this part of the track sound amateur and most likely muddy up the mix. it really sounds well done, and well thought out, especially with the amount of distortion and placement of the samples at this point. as the track moves on, it starts to transform into a real industrial/ebm sounding monster that keeps growing with every passing beat.

percussion wise, i was surprised that you chose not to get too crazy with the drums. i was expecting, because of the aggressive sound of the track, that you would try to ""spice"" it up by going crazy with the drums. i think it was a good choice to stick with a more simple drum pattern, using simple breaks/fills, because it allowed the melodic and technical side of the track to really shine. you definitely seem to have a really great grasp on not only placement of sound, but how to create tension and a sense of ""motion"" in a track. a lot of producers think their tracks are automatic floor bangers that will get people moving, but usually it's just a collection of sounds that end up confusing people rather than making them dance. this track is truly one that will make you tap your foot and nod your head. it's infectious!

great work man! love it!

316,"lol thanks. that's probably because i produce music myself, so i really like to listen and get a feeling for everything...yes i'll check it out tonight and digest it, and give you my honest answer.",2016-08-29 06:43:45+00:00,d70xesi,3.0,t1_d70wmuc,2197.0,electronicmusic
317,"**Well, hopefully my reply isn't too long, but i really want to help answer all of your questions...**

**You asked about where do we feel the track is going? Honestly, it's an amazing story, i get the sense, from the song writing, that it's the beginning to a deeper story. A chance meeting with a rather beautiful woman who turned to be a little more than just an average woman. There's a sense of entering into some sort of danger as i listen to the song. As if you know you've entered into something very wrong, but the temptation is too great to turn away, but you're also unsure if you're prepared for the twists and turns and potential evil that lies ahead in this relationship. i'm almost left hanging on, wondering what's going to happen next when the song ends. i literally was waiting for another video to come on and continue on with the story about how rocky and stressful and dangerous being in a relationship with such a risky woman is and what kind of pain it caused you. the song is very captivating in that way, to be honest.**

**you then asked if this was my song what i would do differently? well, first i'd make a part 2 lol. as simple as it sounds, a song with such a deep storyline seems almost aching for a second half. production wise, i would have slowed the tempo down a little bit. the song is meant to evoke a sense of despair and fear and a bit of suspense on the listener. i think during the verses, having a slower, almost droning melody, paired with a simple kick drum to create a real sense of tension and longing to released...make it sound as if all you want is to be released from the hell that has been brought upon you since meeting this woman.** 

**honestly, i'd love the opportunity to remix this song for you guys. i make electronic music. my sound is dark, and very aggressive. i like to call it Electropunk. here's a link to my work if you would like to check it out &gt;&gt;&gt; *http://funeralcasket.bandcamp.com* i just released a new track *""Dirty Corpses""* 2 days ago. i'd really love to work with you guys especially hearing how tight and slightly gothic your sound is, i love that. but yes, i'd definitely slow the tempo and during the verses and build the tension through the melody and percussion, giving the track a slight rise until the climax of the chorus where there would just be an explosion of emotion, almost pleading to be released from the hold of this evil woman.**

**your next question was ""what emotions does the track evoke?"" well, i'm a bit of an emotional person in regards to music, i really listen with my heart to a lot of songs which is why i think i look so deeply in almost everything i listen to. for me, the track instantly sounds like regret and fear all mixed into one. the vocals have a bit of a pleading quality, as if to almost be asking ""why did this happen to me"", very emotional. i connect with it almost instantly and i think that's why i keep listening to it now. most people can relate to making a wrong decision at some point in there lives and wondering ""where did this go wrong?"" so for me, the emotion is that of regret, as i mentioned before.**

**as for what i ""dislike"" seeing in a music video? i don't watch a lot of music videos, i've always been a fan of imagining a story in my mind and coming up with my own conclusion based of great writing and very well arranged music. music that tells a story on it's own, without visuals, is the best kind. for example one of my favorite songs is ""Black Sabbath"" by Black Sabbath...Ozzy delivers such an emotional plea for his soul through this story that you can almost imagine the black figure standing before him summoning him to hell. and as for what i ""like"" seeing in a video? well i like subtlety, foreshadowing, innuendo, and not directly letting the audience in on the secret. always leaving the viewer, or listener in the dark about the threat that lurks around the corner or in the shadows. the movie ""The Blair Witch"" project, did this perfectly. it caused so much panic, fear, and confusion in the viewer without ever showing an actual ghost, demon, or monster. it's one of my favorite movies, besides ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", the 1974 version, which is simply epic! if i were directing videos for you guys i'd go in a more brooding and haunting direction, giving you guys a much more powerful quality to your music, and a much more dark and everlasting impression on the viewer and listener. Marilyn Manson is great example, the way his image is portrayed to the public, overtime, caused us to almost instantly believe every single blood drinking, or rib removing, or satanic church owning rumor about him. every aspect of him visually is meant to be part of some grand story creating a character of immense power and otherworldly ability. you guys have that same quality to me, but it seems like your leaning a little more towards the ""pop"" side of things, which is not bad in regards of crossover success but it makes some bands just seem accessible, instead of memorable.**

**your final question is my favorite, without the context of the video, what images does the music give me in my mind? one word, tragedy. a very dark, complicated, deeply rooted, twisting and turning tragedy. as i mentioned before, it feels apart of a bigger story that i'm really interested in hearing. maybe it's the producer in me, but i would just like to extend this story into something epic, but what you guys have done is really, really awesome!** 

**i hope i've helped answer some of your questions. i really like you guys' music and if you want to take me up on my offer to remix the track, i definitely think we could create something epic! keep up the great work guys, you guys are headed to the top! thanks for sharing the video. here's my twitter if you guys want to find me &gt;&gt; *http://twitter.com/funeralcasket*  if you guys have twitter let me know so we can keep in touch with each other.**

325,"the vocals are amazing! they seem to literally soar over the beat effortlessly. very strong delivery and yet packed with so much emotion. a lot of times, singers substitute actual emotion for screaming in an effort to show strength and vocal range, but this vocal performance is very, very focused and controlled and extremely passionate.

the production, as far as percussion, is very crisp and mixed very well, especially with the panning of the claps to make the clap hits sound wide and give space to the drums. the kick almost sounds distorted and filtered, slightly distant, which works perfectly with the piano melody. the pianos are strong, but i think having too aggressive of a kick drum would have destroyed the vibe of the track overall. the melody is very uplifting, but somehow sad. gives me an impression of someone running from something, reluctantly, but still running nonetheless. 

overall, the track is very cool and the space in the mix is absolutely amazing. it feels like more instruments could be added, but that would definitely disturb the stripped down quality and appeal of the song. i like this a lot. thanks for posting!

329,"i don't listen to much rap, so forgive me if my review seems more focused on the production of the track.

i like the melody. sounds really Asian influenced. the sub bass is sort of distorted though, and sounds a bit shifted towards the right instead of sitting right in the middle of the mix. i guess this is good as far as letting the vocals be heard very clearly, but it feels like a mix that would sound extremely muddy and hard to hear if played live. 

the lyrics, i really didn't understand to well. i mean, i heard certain references to gyms and flexing and a whole lot of bitches lol, and a few of the guys sounded as if they were literally reading their words from a piece of paper. the first guy had a pretty good presence on the song and seemed really comfortable with rapping.

overall, the beat is pretty cool, it sounds like it's in mono which would be perfect for a club setting, but listening on headphones it would sound off when whoever listening switches to another song by a different artist. i really like the cover art! those guys look pretty fresh lol.

330,"the soul vibes on this track are very, very real. it sounds like the backing track to the perfect slow jam. almost like alternative R&amp;B. something that the weeknd might even sing on. very smooth. 

i like how the bass sits up front in the mix, sort of like a lead instrument steering the track. usually the bass is used to carry a track, but this mix has it right out front leading the way. the percussion is also pretty cool. especially the bongos. they give it an almost tribal feel, and make it less like traditional trap, which usually lacks personality in my opinion. 

overall, i really like this. it seems like a new spin on trap music. a mix between chill and deep house influences, with a very creative drum style. great post!

331,"the intro has a very vintage country western vibe to it. very cool. at 0:48 when that drum hits, you know something awesome is coming. I really like how the guitars sound. they sound warmer than i expected them to sound, especially on a song with this much energy. a lot of times bands, and even myself, choose to go with a heavier, more distorted guitar that almost rips your ears off, but the guitars on this track are extremely tame and warm sounding. very pleasant at almost any volume, i really like that. was that done intentionally? and if not, did you record the guitars in a certain way that would take off some of the high end, or muffle it somehow?

anyway, the vocals are incredibly clean, which is really cool. the singers voice reminds me a lot of Serj Tankian, with the very calm, but extremely emotional pitch and delivery, and can quickly go in and out of screams with ease.

overall, i think this is a very solid track, with lots of energy and extremely well produced! thanks for sharing!

332,"wow! just wow! that intro is the creepiest thing i've heard in such a long time. it reminds me of the x-files or some dark scene from a horror film. the soft bass hit is very powerful, not meaning the intensity with which it hits, but it's presence overall in the track is like some brooding monstrous hand grabbing your brain and reminding you who's in control here. 

the bells keep the tension perfectly...i mean, it literally feels like something is going happen any minute with the suspense of every sound, but the tension never subsides and the suspense only increases as the track moves along.

the mix of the overall track is probably my favorite part. it's spread out so wide, that it often feels like you're surrounded by the music, and trapped in some sick, twisted toy box horror chamber awaiting your fate. very dramatic, very spooky, very experimental, very awesome! thanks for posting this!

333,"i enjoy this track, but that snare in the beginning half is so lo-fi that it throws off the beat. it sounds really ""demo quality"" for the first half of the track, but at 1:36 it hits and sounds really good. like a traditional house track with a semi-electro style bass synth. the groove isn't so much NuDisco, to me, as it is straight French House, or Funk House. I'm not sure of the genre but the track is really warm sounding and has a very deep groove, which seems to make you automatically start nodding your head as you listen.

the only downside i hear is that sampled snare drum in the beginning, if someone didn't listen long enough they may get turned off just because of that. anyway, very cool track! thanks for sharing :)",2016-08-28 18:02:39+00:00,d706mpi,1.0,t3_4zzrgs,10322.0,electronicmusic
334,"Really, well until today i had no clue who this person was. I clicked the link to listen to the track because the title caught my attention, and now reading your comment, I can only assume he must be quite popular.to answer your question, the mix sounds clean because it seems he cut the low end of every synth and instead of adding an actual bass synth and sub combo, he seems to have just went with an arp synth with it's own built in FX (the rolling sound). Most synthwave doesn't have low end, and what I mean is a club/banger style low end. Like dubstep or electro. The low end is softer, so all you have to do is distort the low end harmonics to add a bit of ""bite"", or ""sizzle"" to the low end and pair it with a fat sounding kick and the listener, especially on headphones and computer speakers will think your track is monstrous! Until, of course, they hear it live against something like skrillex, or bassnectar, then your track will sound almost quiet compared to the ones played before or after it. I guess the point though, with synthwave, isn't to tear a club to pieces, but more so mimic the sound, feel, and atmosphere of the 80's.

337,"the attack on that kick drum is pretty crisp, i had to say that first. i'm not the biggest fan of synthwave, although i've messed around with the sound a few times. it seems like the genre more so focuses on nostalgia rather than production techniques and tricks or experimentation, but i still respect it as part of the electronic scene.

this track sounds a bit industrial, to me, especially with that constant rolling bass synth driving in the background. the drums aren't so much industrial, but that metal sounding bass synth is heavy and dark like an industrial/dark electro track. i think the mix is very good. the entire thing sounds thick and heavy like it's just rolling along smashing everything in it's way, but the synth's don't block eachother to the point where it adds crazy phasing and makes things sound too muddy.

it sounds like the perfect action movie intro song, as the hero is driving down the highway on his way to destroy some bad guys chop shop. maybe even something out of the movie Escape From L.A. very cool track. thanks for sharing!",2016-08-27 23:07:06+00:00,d6zbu5g,1.0,t3_4zvi5s,16810.0,electronicmusic

the percussion samples are awesome also, it adds a kind of hiphop quality to the track and almost a gritty quality too. like a cold, bitter yet beautiful night.

the vocals are what really make the track. the vocals sounds extremely distant and almost ""ghost-like"", like the voice is drifting slowly away, and you can only hear the echo of the words spoken. the atmosphere of the entire track is very emotional, which i'm sure was the intent, but the emotion is heavy and dark at times, but still very gentle to listen to. perfect song to relax to!

345,"the retro vibes in this track are very real! the mix has a real original house quality to it. i know it's electro, but it sounds warmer like a house track from the mid 90's. it's very cool, especially that epic climax at 2:39!

i could definitely hear this being played in a massive dance club while everyone just freaks out and starts losing their shit and dancing. the lead synth during the climax part is mixed extremely well. i hear that synth on quite a few hardcore style tracks and it always seems too loud or harsh and doesn't sit well in the mix, but you mixed it very well into this track.

great work! great post!

346,"whoa! this is so cool! the atmosphere is amazing on this project. especially on ""moth"", which is my fav track. it sounds the ending to an epic battle, but even if the battle was won, the track still carries an incredible sadness, almost like regret for the whole thing. 

as i listen to the project, i keep being drawn back to ""moth"". i don't know why, but maybe it's because it actually evokes emotion. the mix is amazing as well, the entire track sounds incredibly wide as the sounds kind of float in and out of range from left to right and fade in nothingness, it's really good.

I'm a huge fan of Darius, my favorite track is probably ""Falling In Love"", the disco-soul vibes of that track are very cool. this track captures that same vibe, but with a sharper dance twist. it's like the perfect lounge track.

the vocals are pretty cool too, i like how they almost seem to get lost in the track and become almost part of the beat itself, rather than punching forward to drive home the point that's there's a singer present. the vocals sound a bit washed and slightly muffled which i thinks adds a lot of character to the track overall.

354,"really cool! this has such an 80's new wave vibe, but slightly darker. that intro is massive, literally, i had to turn the volume down. it sounds like an intro to a vintage horror movie, it's awesome! the subtle beat change at 2:16 on ""Landing on Mars"" is my favorite part, it hits harder and reminds me a lot of EBM, or a dark industrial track.

the mix is pretty good as well, i like how the string sample, i think that's what it is, is wide and you let the bass synth and that bad ass snare sit squarely in the middle. i mean, i know that's production 101 basics, but it just sounds cool in this mix. and that snare is pretty bad ass too. sounds a lot like a retro 808 drum machine snare.

when you get a chance, if you haven't already, check out Justice ""Planisphere"" it's structured kind of like this 3 track setup you have here, and it's awesome!

the production is very dreamy with the heavy reverb and the synth sounds all seeming to melt together into one giant cloud of melodic goodness. it seems like synthwave, or retrowave is produced not so much with a focus on dynamics and production tricks, but more with a focus on feeling and emotion, and it does it well. i'm sure people who remember the 80's are huge fans of this genre which is probably why i see it everywhere lol.

strange as it may sound, the vocals are actually relaxing, i've listened to this a few times and noticed myself being able to do other work while this plays in the background. i think that's what i like most about it. the gothic style and atmosphere, but the beauty behind the way it's all put together. i almost want to say it's a delicate mix. not saying that it lacks punch or impact, but it delivers both in a very ""easy on the ears"" kind of way.

my only complaint would be that bass seemed to lessen the impact of the drum slightly, i don't know if that's more of a sidechain issue or just the fact that the bass is purely demonic and just wants to rule the entire mix lol.

i like the fact that the mix is so toned down and almost feels as if it's moving away from you instead of trying to smash your head in with bass. speaking of bass, the sub bass in this track is mixed in perfectly, it has a solid spot in the middle of the mix that gives it a real presence without being over dramatic and trying to mimic a hip hop or trap style bass. the bass in this mix almost acts like a vessel carrying you through the adventure that is the song.

375,"the intro is very cool. it's really dark, almost gothic in some places. i think the use of the piano and synth together is what makes it sound so huge and wide, and it's a combo i rarely hear in complextro. 

that drop is pretty bad ass as well. i thought it was going to drop into some bass madness, but instead it kept the groove going and dropped into an almost NuDisco style melodic bounce. to me, it sounds like a much wider version of a Madeon track. Madeon's tracks are very melodic, and with pop melodies you want to hear how all the instruments work with eachother, but some of his tracks sound really close together and the harmonies almost bleed into one another, this mix sounds really spacious and you're able to hear every single aspect of every instrument. very well done!

i think prefekt would be an amazing electropop producer. the mixes are so clean, they're perfect for vocals.

i don't know if it's a synth, or digital saxophone sound, but whatever it is, the melody that comes in at 1:59 is my favorite. it reminds me of a guitar, but it has a real sax feel to it.

the production is really, really clean, which is different for justice, but i guess that's the direction they're going in now. guess we may have to get used it, although it's a bit hard :/",2016-08-20 16:37:04+00:00,d6piupr,,t1_d5mqya0,,frenchelectro

1:28 is a blast from the past with that classic house drop, if i can use the word ""drop"". the sub bass is a nice touch as well, it holds the low end perfectly allowing the main melody to really have a strong impact.

another thing i really like about the track is the simplicity of it. it doesn't use that many sounds as far as melody, but more so uses the percussive sounds to give it that bouncy, moving along vibe. kind of reminds of jackin' house with it's infectious groove.

the actual drum pattern is interesting. it's experimental, but at the same time very industrial sounding, and oddly trap sounding as well. although it may sound trap due to the slow tempo. i really like the effects added to the drums as well. it makes them sound really mechanical and almost like a bunch of machines buzzing and clicking and moving all at once.

after a while, the strings kinda just float into the background and it starts to sound really eerie, and cold especially around 2:24 when everything seems to just melt into one another.

the james brown sample makes it sound a bit more hip hop than i personally like, but it keeps the energy up. around 2:29 the beat sounds really retro house with that funky bass synth. i don't know why, but that vocal saying ""end of the world"" is a bit creepy and kind of gets annoying after a while, and it reminds me A LOT of the vocal Porter Robinson used in ""Sad Machine""...i don't know, it just sounds similar.

389,"wow! this has a really heavy 60's psychedelic vibe to it! especially the vocals. the vocal sounds sad, almost in pain, and slightly angry, almost like a punk rock vocal but more controlled. the vocal effects are amazing too. my favorite is the vocal effect around 1:38, it sounds like a broken, mid 50's p.a. system in a high school gym.

the mix of the track is pretty solid as well, especially with all the distortion and effects. you'd think at some points it would be too much on the ears, but the track never gets too bright on the high's or muddy on the lows. my only complaint would be that the bass guitar is very low. a little too low at times, i mean it adds a really vintage aesthetic to the track, but hearing the bass guitar a bit louder would be great too.

the percussion mix is also well done. a lot of beatles songs that used this similar dance-pop drum style would have a really faint sounding or washed out drum sound and really overdone guitars. this track uses that same drum style, but really allows the drums to be heard and actually gives the drums room to move around and add cool fills that can actually be heard rather than sounding like distant mistakes or skips in the drum track.

overall, really great track. i think i'm bias though, i love anything with distortion and that sounds vintage :)

and the extra ""yeah...wooh!"" at the very end was awesome lol. ",2016-08-19 01:13:15+00:00,d6ng8op,1.0,t3_4x77x1,660922.0,ratemyband
390,"i actually enjoyed this more than i thought i would, seeing as i don't listen to a lot of hip hop music. the rhodes sound really pulls you in. reminds me of a lot of early 90's R&amp;B soul. 

i think, maybe, the bass is sitting a little too far back into the mix, it doesn't really dominate the way you'd expect it too, which kind of leaves the keys/rhodes to sound really loud almost overtaking the mix. i think maybe if the bass guitar was turned up and the keys turned down slightly it would sound ""thicker"" overall, like more lush.

my favorite part of the track is definitely the drums, they sound very, very clean. especially that snare drum. the attack on the snare drum is super crispy!  and you mixed the high hat, and shaker perfectly! they both sound as if they're being played by hand, with just the right amount of velocity.

overall, this is really awesome and really chill. if someone were to sing over it, i would hope they would do a light harmony, sort of like a vocal warmup, rather than just flat out sing, i think lyrics may actually hurt the vibe of the track, but a light vocal floating in the background would be perfect!",2016-08-19 01:02:10+00:00,d6nfs5d,1.0,t3_4swmtq,3024740.0,ratemyband
391,"that riff at 0:50 is amazing. just the right amount of fuzz and distortion gives it a real gritty feel, but still very melodic sounding all while being heavy! the black sabbath comparison is pretty spot on in my opinion, especially the way the guitar and bass melt together to create that ""wall of sound"" effect. it's like one giant dark cloud of melodic death hovering overhead, very cool. 

as for the vocals, the vocal style reminds me a lot of Geddy Lee, with the higher upper register. it really cuts through the sound, but doesn't sound to overdone or forced. the mix of the entire song is excellent as well, i don't hear too many rock style songs mixed as well as an electronic music track. this track is really mixed extremely well, with the guitars separated to allow that percussion to slam down the middle, great work, and very, very cool song!",2016-08-19 00:49:46+00:00,d6nf9ng,1.0,t3_4xm2mi,429219.0,ratemyband
392,"i've never heard of hudson mohawke until this post, i like this a lot. it's really a creative way to use sounds not so much in a straight melodic way, but more just matching tones and creating a very awkward, wonky style melody. very cool. it reminds me a lot of hot sugar and the work he does with sounds. he uses actual sounds like birds chirping and water running and fireworks popping, but he structures his tracks in the same way to create these wonky, off beat style melodies, it's really dope.

my only negative comment would be the heavy sidechaining around 2:03. it sounds like this is supposed to be a main part, like a climax in the track, but he sidechain is so heavy that it seems to lessen the impact of that portion of the track. unless, of course, this was your goal. sometimes people purposefully apply lots of sidechain to give a ""pumping"" effect which is cool as well. if that's what you were going for.

442,"wow! this is seriously amazing! the vibes in this track very real. it's like nu disco and electro all mixed into one amazingly sweet track. my favorite thing about the track is how well the vocals blend in with every single sound. it's like the voice wraps around the synths perfectly and literally fuses with the beat to become one solid melody. the vocalist has a terrific pitch and ability to glide over the melody effortlessly. the pianos that play in the background are very, very well mixed in. they're not too loud, or overpowering and really add a subtle touch of maturity to the beat. a lot of upbeat dance music has a really cheesy cliche teenage vibe to it, but this really sounds like a dance track for adults. like something that would be played at a really fancy party, at night on a boat. excellent post!",2016-07-22 20:50:41+00:00,d5mut87,1.0,t3_4st8t1,717779.0,Complextro

i have to say, my favorite track on the project is ""lonely place"". the acoustic guitar and slightly off beat drum pattern is really relaxing, and it feels really atmospheric and wide. the string solo/melody at 2:45 that ends the track literally makes you feel as if you're floating. my only critique would be, i'd like to hear the vocals a little more clearly. a lot of the tracks are so full with production elements that the vocals seem to get drowned out and the lyrics are a bit hard to understand because the music is slightly louder. other than that, great project. thanks for sharing :)",2016-07-19 04:56:01+00:00,d5hstzo,1.0,t3_4tfqfz,48246.0,independentmusic

471,"3 things i'm slightly concerned with if this were to ever be considered here in america. 1st: the possibility of individual armies, resistance, or large gangs challenging one of these ""meta-governments"", or simply bribing politicians and/or law enforcement to gain control of one of these regions. with the reduced size of the country now being individual city states. a takeover would be of greater possibility, and these small governments/politicians have no real threat of punishment for their corrupt behavior. 

2nd: traveling. how would traveling work? would one need a passport to simply cross from virginia into georgia? what about people who commute into different cities/states every day for work? would they still be allowed to do that? how would it work? 

3rd: would simple shipping/distribution of goods around what was once a single country now be looked at as importing/exporting? therefore resulting in higher costs for the public on these goods? some countries (former states) could just start charging outrageous prices on everything because that particular crop/service is only available in their region. beef from texas could very easily go up to $560 per lb, just because texas feels they have the market cornered and control over the best cuts of beef and livestock.

502,"Father: Daft Punk - Something About Us (2001)

Son: Kavinsky - Night Call (2011)

Anyone who understands electronic music on even the slightest level, knows that daft punk influences everyone, but this particular example is very subtle in it's approach, yet almost screams ""hey daft punk, this is for you dad's!"". 

""Something About Us"" was driven by it's funky bass groove. and every other melody was built around that to add fullness to the overall song. the entire vibe of the track creates a night time atmosphere. from the hazy, psychedelic electric guitars, to the slow, seductive tempo and robotic vocals sounding as if they're being whispered and sang at the exact same time! you could almost classify daft punk's track as R&amp;B or at least an extension of the genre in a more electronic direction. people could argue that Zapp &amp; Roger influenced daft punk, but in this particular instance, daft punk abandoned their typical upbeat, dance party vibes for a more dark, and slightly romantic, yet creepy, electronic love ballad. the production on this track was a mixture of electronic and live instruments to create a really vintage ""funk band"" quality and i think that added to the aesthetic of the track. i mean, it's meant to give you the feeling of being in a hazy club listening to a funk band play the last song as you prepare to go home at 3 am. (or that's how i feel when i listen to it)

Fast forward 10 years later and Kavinsky creates his own exotic sounding night time banger with almost the exact same formula, including the heavily distorted and breathy robotic vocals. aside from the songs title ""Night Call"", the vibe of the song sets the atmosphere of a night drive through the back roads while thinking of your lover. ""Night Call"" takes the dark, melodic vibes that were in daft punk's track and drags them deeper into darkness, all the while maintaining that sweet, catchy groove. it's a love song, just like daft punk's track, but it has a more resistant quality to it. as if the love is forbidden. Kavinsky's production isn't as live sounding, outside of the snare drum. but even with the very evident digital sound quality of the track, it captures the essence of the original daft punk track with is sweeping slow melodies.

both tracks were highly successful singles and proved to be huge points in both artists careers. daft punk returned to that slow funky groove sound with their album R.A.M and i believe Kavinsky produced with Kanye West a few times, adding his very heavy digital sound to hiphop music. 

to me, there wouldn't have been a ""Night Call"" if there wasn't a ""Something About Us"" first. the daft punk track seemed to literally open the doors, and people's ears, to wanting to hear more dark electronic driven ""love"" songs, especially one's that resulted in this much success.",2016-07-03 05:03:24+00:00,d4xdqez,1.0,t3_4qvrds,88793.0,popheads

555,"recently i've been listening to SebastiAn really heavy. his album ""Total"" is my absolute favorite. his other work is awesome as well, but ""Total"" features a really diverse mix of retro electro and experimental tracks. his track ""Jack Wire"" inspired my own track ""Amplified Noise"". the use of heavy guitar riffs/chops and the repetitive groove reminds me of a dirtier, lo-fi version of a daft punk track.

i guess i would explain SebastiAn's style as Justice meets Ulver. it's a really dirty/experimental style of electro, with a bit of house influences. he's signed to Ed Banger Records btw (so are Justice), so maybe they share musical ideas, idk. honestly if you're into Electronic music, you need to listen to this album. it's waaaaaay different from the current EDM scene...although i look at EDM as it's own thing outside of straight Electro...yeah i know it's all electronic music, but the EDM scene exists as it's own culture nowadays, so it just feels like a separate entity, but hey, that's just me.

Slipknot had a few cool dvd's about concerts and life on the road during tours, but as far as the recent string of dvd releases goes, nothing like what you're describing i don't think. it would be awesome though to get a high quality dvd from Ghost or Behemoth, so yeah, i guess to answer your question, i DO miss that type of media. i believe elton john just recently did a concert dvd, or it might of been just a special for tv.
