Whenever stories appear in the news of innocent, helpless children who suffer abuse, family dysfunction, neglect etc, I don't think it's particularly controversial to blame the parents who failed to provide the safe and nurturing home environment. But I'll go a step further, with the exception of cases of rape, I believe the female parent bears root responsibility for bringing children into unstable, unsafe, unloving home situations. 

Women as a political lobby and powerful voting block have largely fought for and won the right to have sovereign control over their bodies. Women get to decide, via a plethora birth control options, if/when they want to conceive a child, and further, they have largely won the right to abortions in the case of the 1% of situations where birth control, when properly used, fails. 

Considering these options, there is no excuse to bring children into a situation where the woman and the man aren't committed to each other. Or where a stable home environment hasn't been established. 

""My body, my right"" also means ""my body, my responsibility"". Women need to take responsibility for the circumstances under which they bring children in to the world ",offmychest,Mothers are responsible for the conditions into which children are born,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/4g96ev/mothers_are_responsible_for_the_conditions_into/
