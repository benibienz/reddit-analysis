0,"I wanna make a comment, if I may. 

I attended the protest downtown, both standing outside of city hall and the marches through campus and downtown.  The media is only concentrating on the flag burning, I'm not sure when this happened exactly because I left after we had walked through campus, but it happened way late in the night.   I wouldn't be surprised if most of the crowd had already dispersed when it happened. 

I absolutely support one's right to burn the flag, it's just not my deal, even as someone who adamantly dislikes Trump.  I think it's in pretty bad taste.  I attended the protest, mostly, to put myself forth as an ally to racial and sexual minorities who may feel marginalized by the outcome of this election, I don't want to perpetuate hate by doing something that enrages the vast majority of the population.   I've deleted any photos of myself or any evidence (that I can) of me being at the protest just because I'm embarrassed that it took a turn in that direction.

My college roommate and I got them done together and her experience was almost completely painless.  I don't know, I've always been sensitive there and stuff, maybe that's it.

I kept those suckers in for two years, and I was hypersensitive the whole time to the point where I couldn't do nipple play.

67,"I attended NAU for 5 years, attempted to move away, and ended up coming back to Flagstaff after moving all the way across the country simple because I like it here so much.  

Your mileage may vary, but I find there's a ton of outdoorsy stuff to do here, I really love the people here... there's a great sense of community in the town and it's easy to integrate yourself into it.  I never really have a dull day here, if you immerse yourself there's a countless amount of things to do. 

As for winters, probably nothing too bad compared to Michigan.  Flagstaff is the first snowy place I've ever lived, but in my experience... we'll have a couple of snowy days here and there, it hardly ever blizzards for days on end, snow will hang out on the ground for a lil while and life goes on.  I think the coldest I've ever seen it get down to was -18, and that was at 4am in the morning when I head into work, and that was an anomaly, it's usually very tolerable. 

The cost of living here is pretty high, with it being a college town.  I've always lived in two bedroomed apartments with a roommate, they've pretty much always ran in the region of $1200... split with another person (or a couple if you're lucky!), it's doable.

143,"I tried out therapy for little over half a year to help me deal with a traumatic experience that happened my freshman year of college.  I didn't seek it out immediately, but two years later after I'd found myself fixating on the issue. 

The first guy I went to, I just didn't... click with.  I didn't realize how important it is to *click* with your therapist, because I didn't view them as a friend, moreso a professional who's supposed to fix my problems (note: not a good mentality to have).  

The second guy I visited was fantastic.  I felt very comfortable with him and it didn't feel clinical.  He helped me develop some very good coping mechanisms, and it felt like I could just organically unload on him and I never felt like he was dissecting my thoughts (although, he probably was... after all, that's his job, but it didn't seem like it, that's the important part to me).

I found it really important to WANT to help myself.  I had a few sessions where I was just down on the world and didn't give a shit, and I took nothing from those sessions consequently.
