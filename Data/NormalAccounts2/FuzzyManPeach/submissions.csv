It happens in a variety of places, sometimes on the highway, sometimes when just cruising down the street, but it's *usually* in stop and go traffic.

I've replaced the thermostat, and when the radiator cap is popped (I flushed the coolant recently), I can see the coolant circulating... so I don't think it's my water pump? (Could be? I'm an amateur).  It's not leaking coolant.  My oil looks fine and it's not spitting out white smoke or anything. 

It's my radiator... right?  I'm just confused because it doesn't consistently overheat.  Whenever I take it to the shop they can't get it to overheat.  It's lousy because I can't trust my car enough to go out of town, I'd love to know what's causing all of this.  

Thanks in advance guys!

Apartment does not have in unit laundry but the laundry room is real close to this particular unit. There's a hot tub and fire pit and a really small work out room.

I'm really laid back and I don't really care what you do in the apartment if you're relatively clean and don't throw ragers every weekend (too oooooold for that shit).   All I ask is that you're punctual with rent, and I'd also ask that you stay until the lease is up at the apartment (June, renewing is an option, too). 

I have two kitties, they're really friendly indoor cats. This is the allowed limit of pets in the apartment, but we can examine your pet situation on a case to case basis.  I'll consider living with a couple if you're not batshit and argue all the time (it would drive our rent down, yay!) 

Other than that, it's a standard apartment. Normal sized room. You have your own bathroom.

I just moved across the country, started a new job, and I don't know if I like it yet.  It's making me insanely anxious and I only just realized that I've been on edge for about... a whole month now.

It's was my first time doing this in longer than I care to remember, it was so, so pleasant.  For the first time in weeks, I wasn't worrying about what the hell I'm doing, why I'm here, whether or not I should move back, nothing.  My heart wasn't pounding, I was just lost in this story, it was nothing amazing, it's just that I haven't felt this way in so long that it amplified just how pleasant it was.  

That being said, I'm not sure if I have a SUREFIRE way to relax -- something I can do even when I'm very stressed and will know it will bring instant relief.  Do any of you?
