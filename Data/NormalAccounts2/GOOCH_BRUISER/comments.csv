106,"Here's the thing. You said a ""candiru is a piranha.""

Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is a scientist who studies candiru, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls candiru 
piranhas. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""candiru family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from guppies to grouper to sea bass.

So your reasoning for calling a candiru a piranha is because random people ""call the fiesty ones candiru?"" Let's get gar and swordfish in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A candiru is a candir and a member of the fish family. But that's not what you said. You said a candiru is a piranha, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the fish family piranhas, which means you'd call gar, bass, and other fish piranhas, too. Which you said you don't.
