Make a dwarf or gnome ranged class. Log in and check if one of the current invasions are taking place nearby in dun murogh. If not log back in when they change (currently every 2 hours) and check again. Run there attack every enemy demon you see once with a spell to get xp for their deaths.

EDIT: I just realized I used heirlooms items when leveling my character that increase XP gained that new players wouldn't have so it may take a brand new player around 40-60 mins I 'd imagine. 

Still significantly faster with the legion invasion event happening.",hearthstone,Helpful tip: If you haven't leveled a WoW character to 20 for the pally hero portrait it is now incredibly fast with legion invasion events.,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/4z2bw5/helpful_tip_if_you_havent_leveled_a_wow_character/
