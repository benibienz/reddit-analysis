0,"This what they are talking about, polarization has led to people like you (based on your statement)  being unable understand that many Republicans legitimately have problems with Obama's ACA, race baiting, disappointing economic policy,corruption and more.   In turn many Republicans can't understand that Dems have legitimate qualms about Gerrymandering, Repub fiscal policy and their attitude toward minorities. Before the 2000s it wasn't a guarantee that Texas would go red or California blue, most states could be swing states as evidenced by Johnson, Nixon and Regan! They voted based on the candidate, not party.  Both sides can't understand each other  anymore which in turn leads to hate. And it seems to be spreading to other western democracies as well.

51,"IMO 2 and 5 are baseless, he wants to get rid of abortion in planned parenthood but wants to keep the rest and yes, trump wants conservative judges but has said nothing on repealing gay marriage, in fact he has been the most pro gay Repub. Point 1 has merit but he wants to replace it with something that doesn't increase in price. I disagree that the tax plans will add that much debt if Trump is able to maintain good long term growth, which I think is better than a short term stock decline. Don't know enough to comment on 4, and I totally agree with you on 6, his opposition to net neutrality is extremely disappointing. What industry do you work in?

Here is what will harm me if Hillary wins:

1. NAFTA and TPP will in my view hurt the economy long term as more jobs leave the west. I want to go into the legal field, and less people with jobs means less business for me, less money, etc.  

2. Corruption is bad for everyone, leads to bad policy, bad services etc.

1. It was an innocent remark saying that he legit wanted to hear his wife. He also stated he wanted to hear Bernie's wife speak.

2. He wants his statement to cause a media storm for anti-islam undertones, and then explain that his remark was innocent, again highlighting similar remarks to Sander's wife. This could damage the media more than Trump.

3. Could of said it to highlight the cultural issues Muslims have so it doesn't look like he is picking on an innocent/flawless demographic. 

My money's on 2, 3 is just too risky and out of character this point in the election, and undo everything Trump has done since May.

Mr. Trump want to double down on offensive content(just look at their draw muhammad page, there is a lot of 18+ content there).
