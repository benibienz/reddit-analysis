At an event I sat down with someone I knew from a long time and eventually we got on the topic of the American election (I didn’t bring it up but I’m always happy to discuss). Let’s call this guy Gerry.  Now, I figured this guy wasn’t a Trump supporter, but I figured that he kept up a decent amount of politics because he considers himself “extreme”. I could not imagine the things he said to me. He said that he hated Trump because he wants to put women back in the kitchen. I asked him where he heard that in his speeches, and of course he dodged the question. I told him that Trump has never even hinted at that at any of his rallies or speeches and he ignored that. Now I’m not angry that he doesn’t support trump but I was very distraught that someone I respect and who claims to know politics could be so ignorant on the situation. So basically what I did was drop it, he didn’t attack me or anything so sometimes it’s best to show that a Trump Supporter is not easily riled, and there are other things to discuss) plus even though I didn’t say it I think he understood I liked Trump.  On a side note when I asked who he supported he wanted Obama to run a third term. 

On a more positive note at the same event (a day later) I had a very positive conversation with a Bernie supporter. He didn’t spout any of the common anti trump lines just that he thought socialism was achievable and desirable and he didn’t like the way Trump held himself. And that was that, we had a good conversation, no attacks no false facts. So he was really different to other Bernie supporters I met who earn the name Bernout, although this guy was a lot older than most Bernie supporters I’ve met.

If you haven’t read it you can view it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpLivesMatter/comments/4kf2jf/gabes_guide_to_antitrump_fallacies_1_ad_hominem/). Quick Recap: A fallacy is an argument based on poor logic. This section will cover the most common fallacies I see used when debating politics with people, whether they be left wing or right wing. Of course candidates like Trump have made the left retort to bad arguments. These are, Red Herring, Strawman and Slippery Slope. Before we begin I just wanted to say that it’s never a good idea to force your opinions on others. This guide is best used as a tool to be used in genuine discussions or on the defence as many Trump supporters I know are asked who they support and promptly attacked with these fallacies.  Let’s begin. 

**Red Herring**

Now, both Red herring and Strawman  are part of a collection of fallacies called, “irrelevant conclusions,” where an arguer avoids addressing the issue at hand, and is insanely popular with average Joes and Politicians alike.  Red Herring is the most obvious, the name comes from an urban myth where hunters would throw smelly and tasty fish when dogs were chasing game in order to distract them.  Same with the argument, it is made to throw you of track. In politics a popular red herring are “wedge issues” like gay marriage, abortion etc. **Model: Person A argues B. Person C introduces argument D, argument A is forgotten.** Ex. Trump supporter argues that he is justified in voting for Trump because he is against the current trade deals, Hillary supporter says that Trump is against abortion, both start yelling at each other for 20 minutes over abortion. 

From my experience strong Red Herring’s (such as abortion, trannies etc.) is the hardest Fallacy to counter and the easiest to fall for.  The best way to counter the red herring is to steer back to the original argument “It doesn’t matter what Trump think on Abortion,”  This may not work as you may go back and forth arguing about its importance. If this doesn’t work simply call them out on this distraction, “People are tired about hiring these issues!”  If THIS doesn’t work and you fell that the person is deserves it’s time for the nuclear option; Personal attack them by saying they NEED the red herring because they would lose anyway. Such as, “You always bring up B.S, issues like this because you don’t know jack about real ones,” This may legitimately offend them, so be prepared for a strong response. You may not want to use this not a friend as they may not want to be friends any more so use cautiously.

**Strawman**

Have you ever started talking to a person you see at the corner of your eye, and turn around to see that it’s really a mannequin /scarecrow? No? Well, in a way I’m not alone because people do it in arguments all the time. A strawman is when a person distorts someone else's arguments in order to make them easier to disprove. This happens in elections all the time. **Model: Person A argues B. Person C distorts argument A into Argument D. Person C attacks D. Person C concludes that argument B is wrong.** Example: Trump supporter says that we should temporarily ban Muslims for Security. Bernie supporter can’t believe that you want to deport all Muslims, concludes that there should not be a temporary bans. 

You and trump obviously never said that all Muslims should be deported but your views are distorted by the left and MS all the time. The best way to counter this is to simply call the person out by telling them you never said that or the distorted argument is not what you are arguing.  If they refuse begin to abandon their strawman you should make one too, “Oh so Bernie wants to outlaw banks?” See how they like it! Hopefully they will abandon the strawman and start having an honest argument.  

That’s about it for false conclusions. Stay tuned for some more anti-Trump Fallacy Guides!",TrumpLivesMatter,Gabe’s Guide to Anti-Trump Fallacies #2: False Conclusions,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpLivesMatter/comments/4kkguu/gabes_guide_to_antitrump_fallacies_2_false/

Some of you may have engaged in an argument with a non-trump supporter either because you wanted to convince them to support Trump or you were simply defending your beliefs when questioned. When this happens you or they may be committing logical fallacies, or an argument based on poor logic. Technically a fallacy can totally destroy an argument but many people (especially in politics can) use bad arguments as an offensive tactic in an effort to win.  This guide will seek to educate you on the different fallacies so that you can defend against them, thus and so you can train yourself a better persuader. This section will specifically focus on Ad Hominem and its most popular variants (relating to Trump).  Note: I am not a prof or anything so don’t take my word as law. 

**Generic Ad Hominem.**
	
This one is the most basic and the most popular, it means “to the person” This is an attack on the personal traits or motives of a person. **Model: X is a bad person, thus X’s argument Y should be rejected.** Ex. A trump supporters are stupid, therefore we reject their arguments.  (I’ve hear these arguments from people I highly respect, and no they weren’t joking. Let’s prove them wrong!) Another Stronger one, “You are a conservative, therefore you are wrong. 

**Circumstantial Ad Hominem** 

This Ad Hominem is more complex, and more convincing. This is when a person attacks an argument because of the motives or circumstances of a person. **Model: Person X argues Y, but person X is Z, thus we cannot support Y.**  Ex. Donald Trump argues to lower taxes, but Trump is a billionaire therefore the argument of lower taxes cannot be accepted.
 
(Just an example but believe me, I’ve seen university professors argue this.) This fallacy is more effective than the other as we always (or should always) question the motives of a politician.  However this argument does not address WHY taxes shouldn’t be lowered and it insinuates that the reason why Trumps running is to simply lower taxes for himself. A good way to counter this argument is to again, ask the person to further explain themselves and their reasoning, why does someone’s circumstances affect their argument. Unlike Generic Ad, Hominem Circumstantial AD Hominem is not used to provoke a response as often. 

**Tu Quoque** 

This Ad Hominem variant means , “You too!” This is when a person accuses another of doing something contrary to what they are arguing for. **Model: Person X argues Y, but X does Z, therefore Y is false.** Ex. Donald Trump says that companies shouldn’t hire illegal immigrants, but Trump’s company has employed illegal immigrants in the past, therefore Trump’s claim is false.  
	
Has the Trump been stumped? No, not exactly. This argument doesn’t provide any solid evidence explain WHY we should reject the arguer’s claim, hypocrites supporting it is not enough reason to reject an argument (or else many good laws would not be passed).  Nonetheless this argument/ fallacy is extremely powerful, people don’t like Hypocrites and being one, especially one in power means that you should be stripped of your power (Cough… Hillary-Cough.)  So that means that you must prove that you are not a hypocrite. So is Trump a hypocrite? Based on evidence, it was found that it was not his company itself that employed the illegal’s but a contractor building one of his buildings, so it is plausible that he had no idea, and thus is not a hypocrite. 

**Poisoning the Well** 
	
This is a sensitive one, especially during elections and online.  Poisoning the well means you try to discredit someone even before they make an argument. Model: Person X is Z, thus we can’t believe anything Person X says. Example Online: You are a concern troll, thus we can’t take anything you say seriously.  Example IRL: I know you are a pro-Trump radical but please explain yourself. 

Both these examples are often used in very public environment in an effort to discredit everything else we say. On the surface they appear very effective because often the thing you are being accused of a=is a very real threat. Concern trolls are proven to exist and to be funded by special interests and radical Trump supporters (like any other type of supporter) exist and do harm. In your case however you may not be any of these things and poisoning the well is often used so much that people become immune to it and listen to your argument anyways. Nonetheless it is still in your best interest to counter it. As said before the best way is to make the accuser explain themselves, what makes you a concern troll or a radical? 

**The Most Powerful Counter:** 

This is it for the ad Hominem, there are many more but this is the ones that are used the most. A final note on dealing with them, especially on Generic and Poisoning the Well. Perhaps the most powerful (and most risky) way of volunteering these arguments is to simply walk away. Walking away, in the right circumstances such as when the arguers refuse to listen and make constant attacks against you is  a powerful act and severely hurt the prestige and feelings of your accusers, it’s a horrible feeling (but then again they may deserve it. You are the better person because you refused to play their game.  If you walk away wrongly, like when you are loosing or offended by a legit criticism, you will look bad and potentially hurt your reputation and confidence. It’s like a rare pepe. Use wisely.
