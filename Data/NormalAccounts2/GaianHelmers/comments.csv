25,"I think that it could be good to do but it's VERY important how you are stern. I think the most important thing is that people often read into your words and then in cases of people with personal image disorders skew it into something negative about themselves. 

What you need to do is solidly with 100% confidence tell her exactly what you are worried about and why you want her to take a break. Do it as if you're confiding in someone unrelated, even though it's her. (it makes things less accusative) 
Then totally level with her. Tell her that she needs to trust that you are being completely transparent and if she doesn't feel that way to voice her concerns to you instead of going straight to trying to pleasure you again.  Make it a team effort. 

Of course you need to do it your own way but making things as clear and level is essential for getting on the same page. 

Edit: Also, I find bj's to be nice but I rarely find them to be intensely pleasurable. What I like about it is the view, the sensation and the gesture itself. It seems like she doesn't want to enjoy the process, or atleast isn't thinking about it.
I'd imagine the best thing to do after levelling with her is to ease into it in a way that is more gentle... Atleast for a while.",2016-08-06 19:28:42+00:00,d66yx1u,3.0,t1_d66v7mb,6193.0,sex

27,"The idea would be that I am making a custom post type for large projects, basically compartmentalizing each project into it's own post type. In each post type would be any number of custom fields that allow me to post whatever I need to post in said project.

The idea is then that I would differentiate the types of project posts via tags and then just extract the data I know is there based on the tags, such as album art or comic thumbnails.

If I were to be posting a comic in a project that houses a lot more than comics I'd leave all the album art, game data, forum posts, etc fields empty and just fill the comic data.

Then I query &lt;project&gt;, &lt;comic tag&gt; to get the comic image, knowing that the only data in that post would be the comic data.

46,"I find it's all about recognizing the 'dream' logic in front of you.

Like I had mentioned initially, willfully letting the infinite chase nightmares get you is a great way to liberate you from the illusion. That was my first step into being more lucid in dreams. It's an incredible tool to be able to calmly shut down any nightmares that get too intense... really for me I don't have nightmares anymore.

Next is to start recognizing recurring dreamscapes. They may not look the same each time but they usually house a similar aesthetic theme and you know in your chest at the time that you are where you are.
For me I have a recurring downtown, West Edmonton Mall, Bus terminal area, roadway across the river valley in Edmonton... and a handful more.

Then there are things you can notice to tip you off. As far as I've ever observed, when you ask for the time, your dream denizens cannot answer you. They either ignore you or veer the conversation away.

All that being said, I still fall for the illusion a lot, I have an abnormally frequent number of vivid dreams and in the end often I just know. I'll be in a dream, completely captivated by it and then think to myself ""this is a really cool dream..."" and then continue to be completely captivated by it... So I can't fully claim that I have it all figured out.

Once you have figured out you're in a dream it helps to show people in your dream... yeah it gains them nothing because they are just imaginary but it gives you a reason to show off your dream-ness. Just focus on making something happen in your dream and push it into reality like you'd imagine magic to be... y'know like willing something in the pit of your chest and then like... clenching to push it into reality. I'm sure that's not ""the trick"" to lucid dreaming but doing a grand very thorough gesture will really indicate that you want to change the dream.",2016-07-19 21:38:10+00:00,d5ipv14,7.0,t1_d5hyx1q,41272.0,AskReddit

87,"Thank you for writing me! I'm somewhat at odds in regards to how to respond to such an eloquently written reply. 

I was blown away by the red of my lips in this video too. I'm glad it was well received. I assure you they are completely unaltered. 

Yeah, this was a request and I was really happy how it turned out. I knew of a 'porn' site that would just have models masturbate in bed but only show a bust shot. Exactly what I did. At the time I was advised by the idea but didn't think much of it. I can definitely see the allure now that I've tried it and people have responded so well. I guess part of it is that it's just so sincere. It also goes to show how many cues we get during arousal and intercourse that have nothing to do with the genitals. Definitely the whole package is way better than a few pieces of the whole. 

I feel you're probably wrong. O faces are o faces. They don't feel particularly flattering because you're so out of control and you just wiggle and clench... But that's all I did and it turned out great. You just need to set up the lighting, use a tripod, and try to just feel good regardless of the camera and bright light in your face! :P

Lastly it helps to be aroused all day from all the attention online and having sexy conversations with a friend. Then there is no reservations at the end of the day. ",2016-06-19 18:41:04+00:00,d4fmdsq,2.0,t1_d4fhezx,8339.0,ladybonersgw

When you got started did you feel that you had a... sort of clarity that if you kept doing what you were doing that you'd find success? A confidence if you will?

How long did it take till you felt that you were solidly received enough to begin shifting towards developing an advanced website, short animations and the cartoon series?

Do you find that you enjoy the production work, design and development of your larger projects (the cartoon) or is it more the satisfaction of completing the project and getting it out that you enjoy?

Was the success you guys eventually received for C&amp;H due to your working on it or was it a complete luck of how it was received? I understand that everything has an element of luck to it but I'm thinking more like how things sometimes EXPLODE with popularity due to a lucky circumstance.

190,"#151,600 dead people, all the people that died today, appear in front of me.

I'm in my bedroom which means that probably before I even know it happened I'm crushed. 

On the news it is reported that a condo in my town has exploded releasing hundreds of thousands of bodies of every ethnicity on earth into the streets, adults and children. At least 2 of the 5 people in my household are dead and the world is shaken by the horrible anomaly that had occurred. 

Many people fall into hysteria claiming that this is an omen of death onto the human race. How could it be that a handful of English speaking celebrities have died and now all the world's dead for the day have somehow magically appeared in one location. 

Murders and chaos erupt, radiating in intensity out from the morbid origin point. A new era of pagan religion sprouts all over the world all differing from one another but all focus around appeasing the God of death. The radical nature of these new faiths have quickly wrangled in adopters and left skeptics in silence over fear of the repercussions of non believers.

Meanwhile the richest groups on earth are either crushed by the sudden state of the world or see the immense opportunity available to them. All efforts to preserve the state of earth fall off the table and industry takes over completely unrestrained.

The efforts to clean out hundreds upon hundreds of pounds of rotting human flesh fall apart as everyone involved fall into an unnatural emotional low. The city is completely wrapped in a miasma of darkness as people succumb to their darkest primal instincts and desires. Unknown to anyone the sheer amount of death condensed into one place has actually caused a seemingly supernatural phenomenon. North America is slowly uniformly becoming wrought with the same miasma of darkness that the city has already fully befallen. 

All contact from Edmonton, Canada is cut off from the rest of the planet but it takes a couple weeks for news media to clue in.

Meanwhile murder rates across North America skyrocket and western Europe, Eastern Asia and South America are starting to feel the emotional vacancy and the primal call. Denial is thick among the populace. 

In Edmonton the sky is blotted out by a thick overcast reflecting the red of the city lights back into the city washing the entire area in a red hue. The entire city is in a state of anarchy however the 'good' people are simply those who won't kill their family or close friends but doesn't exempt them from the nearly orgasmic pleasure of brutally murdering others. At this point guns have long stopped being fired despite the prevalence of ammunition available. The only ones who continue their use are gun fetishists who definitely do not use their guns for execution... Most start from the toes and work their way up. 

The rest of the world has since been overcome by the miasma and factories continue to pump pollution into the atmosphere shrouding the planet ever further into a black endless cloud. The ultimately wealthy are the last to feel the results of this anomaly as their subordinates lose the last of their desire to follow behind their wealth and now instead of being protected in a fortress full of servants they are now imprisoned to be subject to their will until their last breath... Which will not come swiftly. 

In the final days madness overcomes the remaining survivors which forces them into starvation and self mutilation.

No one ever made sense of the anomaly and nothing beyond a strange sense of dread and doom caused humans to act in the way they did... But they are no more and further more the earth will not recover from what they brought in their final days.

Finally the earth becomes a dead planet. However it will continue to revolve around the sun for eternia onward.

One day I decide that I want to make a penis device for women to be able to stand an pee and sculpted... well... basically a penis shaped [Go-Girl](http://go-girl.com/) out of that crayola magic foam.

That night I took the now dry foam thing and wanted to try it but of course was not a woman and could not do anything about it... so instead I just decided I'd see if it fit around me, thus being accurately penis shaped.

Well I could only fit partially in but I was certain that there was a way to get it in. After various tugging and pushing and shoving and whatnot I had an orgasm. It was intense and was shockingly painful... but in a way that immediately after it happened I wasn't afraid of what that was and instead was deeply fascinated and wanted it again.

250,"My 2 friends and I had just eaten pot cookies and I had bought one of those marble toys where you build the big structures and drop the marbles in the top and they go careening down the structure you made.

We decided to sit out in the grass outside of the mall I had just purchased the toy from and start playing with it.

As we're sitting there this random guy around our age (early 20's) comes over to us and asks if he can sit with us while he waited for his sparring partner.
We have no real reason to say no so we invite him to sit and try figuring out how to put this thing together.

As he's sitting with us he doesn't really touch the toy and just starts trying to relate with us about how he's really pent up and just wishes they'd make anatomical dummies that like... replicate being alive with blood and stuff and he just wants to stab and murder the thing.

At this point the pot cookies have kicked in and we're all thinking the same thing: ""This guy probably wont do anything here... but if we excuse ourselves and head home.. we better not be followed.""

I take on the duty of trying to deviate the murder fantasizing with 3 absolute strangers into self improvement either through taking the martial arts seriously to vent off excess energy and anger or getting therapy or other kinds of productive means to vent those feelings. He instead assures me that none of that stuff works or matters and it'd just be so satisfying to snuff out this dummies lives.

Finally my one friends friend who came to meet us on the hill arrives and we use that opportunity to excuse ourselves. Of course the guy has no reason to be on the hill with us anymore so he comes along. Fortunately the friend of my friend see's the strangers sparring equipment and starts talking to him about sparring. We use their connection to excuse ourselves because we gotta get home, walk exactly the opposite direction from my house and then as they fall out of range of us run around and away so we can escape that very, very fucked up situation.",2015-10-16 04:13:41+00:00,cw1in04,1.0,t3_3ow6nv,32273.0,AskReddit

254,"It's a tough one. I've slowly amassed a bit of a hypothesis of what sexy male underwear is. 

First of all one needs to define what sexy underwear is. So many times I see threads asking women what sexy underwear they like on men and so far it is always deviated to stating that they prefer a man in a well cut suit or in some other clothes... This however isn't answering the actual question so it's up to men to be the ones to define it. 

**So what is sexy underwear?** 

-It is a design of underwear that deviates from the base minimum / standard design of underwear.
 
-It is meant to accent the parts of the body that it covers (think about how bras hold the breasts up). 

-It's is something that should cause the wearer to be reminded that they are wearing it throughout the day.

And lastly 

-The results of the 3 above points should give the wearer an air of confidence and/or the feeling of having a sexy secret.

There are certainly things that can contend the last point such as only wearing sexy underwear and getting so used to it it doesn't feel exciting anymore but I feel that's an exception to the rules and can't really argue the point when at some point or another that person did feel sexy when they first started wearing sexy underwear. 

So then what does that mean for men who for the most part have next to no real cultural foundation or access to articles of vanity such as that? 

**There are some options.** 

First of all there's the very basic level of sexy underwear. Designer boxers, briefs and boxer-briefs are usually designed to fit better and give that accenting of the genitalia, they also have the designer name on them which outwardly suggests they are classier and more expensive. Though this definitely is an improvement I think one should dive deeper into the sexy underwear spectrum than this. 

Then there are the unconventional designer underwear. For example there is ""James Tudor"" brand, I own two of their designs. These designs are unconventional; classy; they hold your penis up and push it out to get a much more prominent bulge; are really well made and are quite sophisticated. Their form fitting cuts also remind you throughout your day that you're wearing them. I usually wear boxers that are basically loose cloth that flaps freely around so a nice firm brief is very different and reminds you you're wearing your sexy underwear. 

Then there's the more speculative clothing that I feel could be made into an incredible range of male lingerie if the right designer took on the task. Such garments include the sarong, the kilt and the loincloth. Most of those garments have been used by men in tribal times and their often rugged/utilitarian elements definitely present a masculine aura to them. If you were to find it or someone were to design those types of garments with the same modern sophisticated aspects of the James Tudor line you could definitely have an incredible range of sexy male underwear. 

Then finally there's the scantily underwear. This one is a tough one as there's a very fine line between scantily and effeminate. I will defend any man who wants to wear effeminate underwear. There's nothing wrong with doing so, however this is a more broad reaching topic towards even men who don't want to stimulate their feminine side. These include low cut briefs, thongs, panties, those over shoulder V shaped... things, banana hammocks, those tubes you put over your penis and those one strap on the side thong like things. 

The scantily range doesn't have to be seen as bad and I think that's where finding just the right garment shines. If you find a scantily low cut brief that makes your dick look great, puts pressure on all the right places to make you feel like you're wearing sexy clothes and it is just so tantalizing how much it covers when it's showing off so much then you're going to be wearing the kind of underwear we as men just love to see in women.

I just ordered 3 pairs of scantily underwear earlier this week and am hoping for the best. I got them from some online Chinese store thing called Sammy's something rather. There's one boxer-brief that has a really interesting cut where the crotch is cut like briefs but the sides flair out into a more boxer like cut. It reminds me of the Roman armoured kilts with the pauldron things on the side. You'd be right in assuming I got those. 

Anyways this is something I've stewed on for a couple years now as I personally feel so let down when ladies get all the fun in wearing sexy underwear. Pass on the information to other men, maybe we can start getting our own styles of sexy underwear. 

**tldr: Sexy Male Underwear® It can be a thing.™**

Self improvement and introspection is a great thing to be doing always in any situation but use it to figure out how you can be at ease with who you are, how you are.
From there as you socialize here and there reflect on it and see what parts of it are comforting to have seen, someone stammering or mistaking something is perfect proof that even social veterans are still prone to saying something weird or not being perfectly suave at all times.

266,"Yeah many of the large nav buttons don't do anything as they need multiple comics to actually be able to work, I plan to build the functionality in during and or after this next episode (starting in the next week or two)

Alternatively though, you are able to navigate the comics with your keyboard arrows, which is somewhat standard in many webcomics. I just don't know how to notify people of that function aside from... I guess having a cookie that checks if its their first time using the site and blatantly telling them then.

If you use Questionable Content I've used some of their design ideas for navigation. If you try to navigate further than is possible with the arrows it tells you you've hit the last page in a message prompt. I guess I can change it to only do it when you've used the keyboard to try and navigate and just make the next button do nothing otherwise.
