--------------------
&gt; Man here. What exactly qualifies as sexy underwear? Because I'm pretty sure I don't have any if I have no idea what it is.. 


It's a tough one. I've slowly amassed a bit of a hypothesis of what sexy male underwear is. 

First of all one needs to define what sexy underwear is. So many times I see threads asking women what sexy underwear they like on men and so far it is always deviated to stating that they prefer a man in a well cut suit or in some other clothes... This however isn't answering the actual question so it's up to men to be the ones to define it. 

**So what is sexy underwear?** 

-It is a design of underwear that deviates from the base minimum / standard design of underwear.
 
-It is meant to accent the parts of the body that it covers (think about how bras hold the breasts up). 

-It's is something that should cause the wearer to be reminded that they are wearing it throughout the day.

And lastly 

-The results of the 3 above points should give the wearer an air of confidence and/or the feeling of having a sexy secret.

There are certainly things that can contend the last point such as only wearing sexy underwear and getting so used to it it doesn't feel exciting anymore but I feel that's an exception to the rules and can't really argue the point when at some point or another that person did feel sexy when they first started wearing sexy underwear. 

So then what does that mean for men who for the most part have next to no real cultural foundation or access to articles of vanity such as that? 

**There are some options.** 

First of all there's the very basic level of sexy underwear. Designer boxers, briefs and boxer-briefs are usually designed to fit better and give that accenting of the genitalia, they also have the designer name on them which outwardly suggests they are classier and more expensive. Though this definitely is an improvement I think one should dive deeper into the sexy underwear spectrum than this. 

Then there are the unconventional designer underwear. For example there is ""James Tudor"" brand, I own two of their designs. These designs are unconventional; classy; they hold your penis up and push it out to get a much more prominent bulge; are really well made and are quite sophisticated. Their form fitting cuts also remind you throughout your day that you're wearing them. I usually wear boxers that are basically loose cloth that flaps freely around so a nice firm brief is very different and reminds you you're wearing your sexy underwear. 

Then there's the more speculative clothing that I feel could be made into an incredible range of male lingerie if the right designer took on the task. Such garments include the sarong, the kilt and the loincloth. Most of those garments have been used by men in tribal times and their often rugged/utilitarian elements definitely present a masculine aura to them. If you were to find it or someone were to design those types of garments with the same modern sophisticated aspects of the James Tudor line you could definitely have an incredible range of sexy male underwear. 

Then finally there's the scantily underwear. This one is a tough one as there's a very fine line between scantily and effeminate. I will defend any man who wants to wear effeminate underwear. There's nothing wrong with doing so, however this is a more broad reaching topic towards even men who don't want to stimulate their feminine side. These include low cut briefs, thongs, panties, those over shoulder V shaped... things, banana hammocks, those tubes you put over your penis and those one strap on the side thong like things. 

The scantily range doesn't have to be seen as bad and I think that's where finding just the right garment shines. If you find a scantily low cut brief that makes your dick look great, puts pressure on all the right places to make you feel like you're wearing sexy clothes and it is just so tantalizing how much it covers when it's showing off so much then you're going to be wearing the kind of underwear we as men just love to see in women.

I just ordered 3 pairs of scantily underwear earlier this week and am hoping for the best. I got them from some online Chinese store thing called Sammy's something rather. There's one boxer-brief that has a really interesting cut where the crotch is cut like briefs but the sides flair out into a more boxer like cut. It reminds me of the Roman armoured kilts with the pauldron things on the side. You'd be right in assuming I got those. 

Anyways this is something I've stewed on for a couple years now as I personally feel so let down when ladies get all the fun in wearing sexy underwear. Pass on the information to other men, maybe we can start getting our own styles of sexy underwear. 

**tldr: Sexy Male Underwear® It can be a thing.™**
