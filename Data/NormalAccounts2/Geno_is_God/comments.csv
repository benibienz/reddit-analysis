89,"Yeah, I haven’t cared so much about songwriting as right now. I’m not trying to put out a record, I’m trying to do something no one’s done before. I wrote just under 50 songs for Home Sweet Home and it’s whittled down, and the new NOFX record, and I just keep writing like crazy. I read something about Stephen King where he said he writes every day. And the problem with this is, and this is personal too, this is the first record I’ve ever done while drinking and using drugs. I always get sober to do our records. This time, I’ve been drinking and doing coke and I’ve got to places that I wouldn’t have got to if I didn’t do that. And that’s how I can do ten hours in the studio then go home and write for five hours. And, maybe I’m fucked, maybe the record isn’t very good and I’m just fooling myself [laughs]. You never know how good a record is until about six months to a year. [But] all I can tell people is that I peeled off my skin.
