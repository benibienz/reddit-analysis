26,"So tired of doing the right thing and having it bite me in the ass. Three major life events starting from 2000 I was run over by a car. The lady that mowed me down was a single mother of 4 kids, so I didn't sue her even though I was left with 250 grand in medical bills (long story madr short) she only had 25 grand of insurance after lawyer fees i was left with 14,800 which my family promptly ""borrowed "" most of it. 

 Second big event two years later my mother stole my check book and cleared out my bank account with her knowing i had written a check for 900 dollars which was the last of my long term disability check. This nearly ended up with me in jail for writing bad checks...only way i could get the money back was to sign an affidavit staing she forged my signature...which would have ended her going to jail..so of course i did the right thing and did not send her up the river.

Third event just recently told my good for nothing in laws that they could move in with the wife and myself after they got kicked out of their apartment for lieing about all the animals they had at the time (6 dogs 3 cats and 4 birds) this was suppose to be a short term thing a year and a half they are still here and sucking us dry of money...oh forgot to mention we had to bail them out money wise from some screw ups of theirs costing us a bit over 45 grand...cant kick them out do to inlaws wife is end stage kidney failure and i am too nice of a guy to put a dying woman out on the street no matter how much i want to...and no they are not paying rent to us on a regular bases and when they do they seem to think 400 a month is way more then they should have to pay...that wouldn't even get you a room here in Sydney Australia!!!

68,"I will use myself as an example here to make a small point about the bankruptcy as well as on medical bills in general. In 2000 I was living in Georgia (usa) and was walking home when some twit of a woman ran me over with her car while she was doing 65mph.  I got screwed all the way around. My left leg was shattered in 12 places, right knee blown out, thrown though a barbed wire fence that cut me in the middle of my head...bruised lung and kidney, major circulation damage to my legs. 

 I now have two rods in my left leg, a large pin in my left hip, a steel plate in my right knee and I did suffer some brain damage, long term and short term memory has some big holes in it, and a few other odd things such as I can not jump any more...I technically know how to jump but when I try the brain just says nope don't know how to do it.

Now none of this was my fault, and the lady that hit me only had basic insurance. At the time that was 25,000 dollars. I did have blue cross blue shield health insurance though work. Now here is where the kicker is. It cost some where around  250,000 US dollars to put me back together again. Now Blue cross blue shield paid only 50 grand of the total hospital bill then fought me for two years on getting back that 50 grand because they said since it was not my fault they should not have to pay.

I did not sue the lady that ran me over as it would have been useless and oddly enough wrong in my eyes because at the time of the accident she was a single mother of 4 young kids. And I like to sleep at night with out my over active conscience bugging me. My pond scum lawyers took 40% of that 25k(never type when you are tired added an extra 0 to that doh...wish it had been 250k but nope only got 25k as a settlement never ever get run over in Georgia you will get screwed!!!).  By the time everything was said and done I was left with about 14,800 in settlement money...and ALL yes you read that right ALL medical bills left to pay because they were in my name. 

I lost my job 3 days after the accident as Georgia is a no fault state, (which means that the factory could fire me for any reason and the reason  they used and I quote ""he can no longer physically do the job) they even had to life flight old humpty dumpty to South Carolina where at the time you could not declare bankruptcy due to medical bills in that state. Yep see that is the kicker some states will not let you declare bankruptcy to avoid medical bills.

after 10 years it actually disappers off your credit history, 7 years it goes off but its still under written for 3 years after that. Medical bills can actually play a huge role in if you get say a car or house loan. So what  John Oliver  did for those people was take a huge load off them not only from getting hassled and trust me debt collectors really do hassle you but he gave them something that is very hard to get back...piece of mind.

For YEARS (10 to be exact) I still had debt collectors calling me and trying to get back money that the hostpital had already written off",2016-06-07 08:26:32+00:00,d3z7zfh,10.0,t1_d3yquit,31950.0,explainlikeimfive

90,The reason its better is that MOST people that hand stitch leather will use a saddle stitch. (depending on the thickness of the leather some times the really thin stuff you can not use a saddle stitch)  its also called the double needle stitch. What makes it actually better then a normal machine stitch is that the thread is doubled though each hole so that if the unlike the lock-stitch the thread should break the whole project will not suddenly start to unravel as you pull at that one little piece of string sticking out. ,2016-04-25 19:55:19+00:00,d2gytjd,2.0,t1_d2ghqcz,22943.0,BuyItForLife
91,As for the fraying at the end of the stitch were you A: using a waxed thread and b: did you cut as close to the leather that you could and C: did you melt the thread once you cut it to stop it from fraying. you could have accidently punched though the thread with the needle if you did it by hand. Which will weaken the thread and cause it to break or frey,2016-04-25 19:51:51+00:00,d2gynr5,3.0,t1_d2gl4hk,17489.0,BuyItForLife
92,"Correct that the saddle stitch, which is what I use for all products is actually stronger then a lock-stitch that a sewing machine uses. As for how long the stitching will last that particular bag I have made in the past for a friend, and after 4 years the stitching still is holding up. The other reason that I do everything by hand is a matter of choice, yes there are special (and you need a special one) sewing machine for leather but for some projects you simply can not use a machine as it will not bend the curves right, for straight sections yeah you could but once again it will only use a lock-stitch",2016-04-25 19:50:35+00:00,d2gylmu,3.0,t1_d2gpjmn,11691.0,BuyItForLife

As for lining I always actualy make the liner the same size as the piease and yes I do line each individual piece the reason I make them the same size is that I can then simply hand stitch (I do all stitching by hand) the pieces to gethere this way I do not rely sololly on glue to keep the linner in place.

IF you do something similar to this bag with out bending the gusset to a 90 degree to give you a lip to glue to the back and front, take your gusset it line the top of it with the back (or front your choice) First then start punching your holes. 

What I did was laid the gusset down even with the front first, smacked used a wing divider then groved the line to help protect the stitching and to give a straight line for the pricking iron to follow. I then first drove the pricking iron into the front, then lined slide the pricking iron over to the gusset lined it up and then punched the holes, then went back to the front, punched holes, then over to the gusset going back and forth like the for the whole length of the front (keeping the gusset flat not trying to curve it)

Yes Etsy,Ebay and all those sites have customers but they can cost you a pretty penny just to try and drive customers to your store. Where as if you run your own social media  you can drive people to your store, and most social media sites are free, even if you run some ads on say facebook. Personally I am starting my own business and using these accounts. Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, Pinetrest. It does take a while to drive customers to your websites but in all honest it might take you 30 minutes out of your day do run the gambit of social media websites.
