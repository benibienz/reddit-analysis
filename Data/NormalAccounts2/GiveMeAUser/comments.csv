79,"Yes, good point. Thing is that I'm creating a classification based on respondents' answers to several survey items, not just one. Let's say I want them to clarify as A, B or C. However, the survey didn't ask them ""Are you A, B or C?"" It asked ""How much of A are you?"" A separate item asked ""How much of B are you?"" And one more item asked about C. So now I have people in the dataset that have, for example, 4 (""strongly agree"") on A, 4 (""strongly agree"") on B, and 2 (""disagree"") on C. Now, I can assign this person to either group A or B, but group B has way too few people, so in order to make the categories of the classification ""more balanced"" I put them in group B. See my problem? I need a justification for that decision. I know I know, it's a questionable thing to do, and there are other ways to deal with this problem (e.g., make this group ""mixed A and B""), but for the purpose of my study it'll work (I.e. all subsequent analyses work well on the resulting classification).

81,"Hi, I'm trying to finish my dissertation with a five-month old, and just like you I have no help, and we don't wanna hire a babysitter, etc. I completely understand what you're going though. I, too, can only work when she's napping. Here's what I think you may wanna do:

- Commit to absolutely protecting the time when she's napping, and only devote it to studying. Everything else can be done when baby's awake. Hell, I even work out in front of mine when she's on a playmat. If I need to talk on the phone, I take baby out for a walk, as she likes being outside, and is always quiet, thus letting me enjoy my conversations. Etc. Etc.

- You didn't say anything about this, but if you haven't, consider sleep training. Saves a lot of time too.

- Husband and I do a big cook on Sundays for the week. I learned about it on Reddit, actually (r/mealprep or something like that). We plan a menu of lunches and dinners (our breakfasts are like cereal or toast) for the week, buy all the groceries we need, make those meals, pack them, and put them on the fridge. And then obviously eat them during the week. Saves a lot of time and energy during the week. Most importantly for me is it saves a lot of mental energy for me: I don't think about what to cook, and whether I have all ingredients I need, and whether it's worth running to the store for that one ingredient I don't have, etc. Etc. Seriously, it's a life saver (and money saver too. And headache saver!!).

- Lastly, look into the resources your school may have for students who are parents. For example, I know a couple of my friends qualified for cheap (or maybe even no-cost) university-run daycare. Perhaps, there's something else. Some scholarship maybe or something? Or some group of student parents that babysit for each other? I'd start with your advisor, and/or email the Dean of students or Dean of your school or someone like that. Tell them, I'm so and so, how can the university help me given me my circumstances? 

- Also, work with your professors if you're failing. Ask for an extended deadline, or maybe even an incomplete at the end of the semester, but don't abuse these options. Only use them in extreme circumstances. You don't wanna end up with a bunch of incompletes come Christmas.

95,"Hey, so I'm female, and I remember a guy who was great on a dating site and texting, including pictures, but when I hung out with him on the first (and only) date, I knew it wasn't gonna work. I remember he wore an ill-fitting cheap ass shirt, which was very off-putting to me. Superficial of me? Maybe. But when I saw what he was wearing, I immediately regretted the time I had spent in front of the mirror, putting makeup on and trying on different outfits, trying to look my best for him. Sure, for each his own, but it was a sign that we were worlds apart as far as personal appearance goes. Then he mentioned that he wanted to move to a small town, and tired of living in the city, whereas all I wanted was to move to an even bigger city. Also his career aspirations and activities with friends were not aligned with mine. So it was very clear (to me) like maybe 30 minutes into the date that we weren't gonna click, ever, whereas he seemed like he had no clue. When I said I wanted to leave, he seemed to be taken aback. If I had to explain to him why, I would've said ""incompatible lifestyles and aspirations"". I think it's related to people's socioeconomic status too, how people were raised and socialized, so maybe that could be your answer. 

In any case, the encouragement I have for you is that you're still very young, and you're trying to figure this whole dating thing out, and you'll get better at it with time. It'll be painful sometimes but it's part of the game. It's absolutely normal.",2016-07-31 01:01:56+00:00,d5xsncq,1.0,t3_4vcdrs,36217.0,offmychest

If you needed a drug for health reasons, why did your family doctor (presumably American, since you reside in the US) prescribe something that wasn't approved by the FDA?

All this in order to become president one day, but here she was, nodding helplessly and gratefully to her rival's words, who came to her rescue out of his own goodness, humanity and decency.

421,"Thanks, this was informative. However, this is a different situation altogether from the one I described in my previous comment, because the donor in question 1) contributed the maximum permissible contribution, which, as I said before, campaigns need to disclose information about to FEC; and 2) did not self-certify as a US citizen/permanent resident, and yet his contributions were processed. Clearly, a violation. So, no questions here. 

Again, to reiterate my original question: What if the donor: 1) contributes less than the amount that needs to be disclosed to FEC (whatever that number is, I'm not sure on this); and 2) lies on the self-certification page (i.e., falsely claims that he/she is a US citizen/perm. resident).

422,"Well, I'm not sure. First of all, when you go on a donation page, you're asked to confirm that you are a US citizen or permanent resident. So, if you clicked yes, then is the lie on you? Are you the one who's at fault here or is it the campaign? I'm guessing it's not required by law to verify that all the donors meet this criterion, maybe the campaign is not at fault. Second, as far as I understand, campaigns are not required to disclose any information about the donors, if the donations are under a certain amount ($2,700 or something like that). So if you're donating just a little bit, and you're clicking on ""yes, I'm a US citizen"", who's ever going to find out that the campaign accepted donations from non-US citizens?",2016-01-09 02:07:07+00:00,cyrdbgc,3.0,t1_cyrbftq,3527.0,SandersForPresident

453,"From ""The Idiot"" by Dostoevsky (who himself stood before a death penalty squad but was pardoned by the Tsar at the last minute. The Tsar liked to make death row inmates believe that they'd be executed, while he knew all along that he'd pardon them):

“This is not my own fantastical opinion—many people have thought the same; but I feel it so deeply that I’ll tell you what I think. I believe that to execute a man for murder is to punish him immeasurably more dreadfully than is equivalent to his crime. A murder by sentence is far more dreadful than a murder committed by a criminal. The man who is attacked by robbers at night, in a dark wood, or anywhere, undoubtedly hopes and hopes that he may yet escape until the very moment of his death. There are plenty of instances of a man running away, or imploring for mercy—at all events hoping on in some degree—even after his throat was cut. But in the case of an execution, that last hope—having which it is so immeasurably less dreadful to die,—is taken away from the wretch and *certainty* substituted in its place! There is his sentence, and with it that terrible certainty that he cannot possibly escape death—which, I consider, must be the most dreadful anguish in the world. You may place a soldier before a cannon’s mouth in battle, and fire upon him—and he will still hope. But read to that same soldier his death-sentence, and he will either go mad or burst into tears. Who dares to say that any man can suffer this without going mad? No, no! it is an abuse, a shame, it is unnecessary—why should such a thing exist? Doubtless there may be men who have been sentenced, who have suffered this mental anguish for a while and then have been reprieved; perhaps such men may have been able to relate their feelings afterwards. Our Lord Christ spoke of this anguish and dread. No! no! no! No man should be treated so, no man, no man!”",2015-12-17 18:05:15+00:00,cy2g1dz,1.0,t3_3x7rnp,14206.0,SandersForPresident

So? It doesn't matter who you are, you still can post a lousy column. 

As for cultural insensitivity: he's the one who wrote ""Tomorrow in the final Pennetta will play for a bowl of pasta"", which is like, come on. How effing old and tired is this to write about Italians in terms of Italian food? Whenever there's talk about Kazakh players, he's like ""BORAAAAT"". That's just such a low kind of humor, and there's been numerous other examples of this, I just can't remember them all right now. Just pay attention, you'll see them again. He said on two separate occasions that the capital of Qatar was Dubai. That's the Executive Editor and Senior Writer we're talking about, with a Yale degree at that. I actually pointed this out to him, and he wrote back ""I'm thoroughly embarrassed, I don't know how I made this mistake"". Well, probably because you never knew, and never bothered to check. And these are not some random locales - both Dubai and Qatar host major tennis tournaments, and as a Senior freaking tennis Writer you're supposed to know your tennis geography.

Oh, and all those typos in his columns. There hasn't been a single column without some gaping typos. Not a big deal, sure, but very unprofessional. Especially for the Executive Editor and Senior Writer, lol.

""Although the hidden curriculum conveys a great deal of knowledge to its students, the inequality promoted through its disparities among classes and social statuses often invokes a negative connotation. For example, Pierre Bourdieu asserts that education-related capital must be accessible to promote academic achievement. The effectiveness of schools becomes limited when these forms of capital are unequally distributed.[7] Since the hidden curriculum is considered to be a form of education-related capital, it promotes this ineffectiveness of schools as a result of its unequal distribution. As a means of social control, the hidden curriculum promotes the acceptance of a social destiny without promoting rational and reflective consideration.[8] According to Elizabeth Vallance, the functions of hidden curriculum include “the inculcation of values, political socialization, training in obedience and docility, the perpetuation of traditional class structure-functions that may be characterized generally as social control.”[9] Hidden curriculum can also be associated with the reinforcement of social inequality, as evidenced by the development of different relationships to capital based on the types of work and work-related activities assigned to students varying by social class.[10]""

565,"&gt; I would say that its just as sexist and ""bullshit"" to have gender disappointment over not having a girl because you wanted to dress her up in pink and bows as it is to have gender disappointment over not having a boy because you wanted him to carry on your last name.

No, it's not the same thing. Forgive me for going fully feministic-ballistic on you - I know a lot of people have an aversion to that, and sadly, some of those people are women themselves, - but the truth is that passing on the name is a symbol of legal, economic, social, and political privilege of men in a traditional society: with the name a son inherits whatever else his father is giving him - money, land, slaves... the estate. Daughters were not even worth the investment of education - because they were not supposed to carry the family name and inherit the family's fortune the way sons were. So passing on the name remains a symbol of that preferential treatment of male heirs. It is no accident that women changed their family name to that of the husband's (and still many do, obviously): this indicates who the woman belonged to - first, to her father, then to her husband. She did not have any economic power, and therefore had to ""belong"" to a man. So while wanting to dress up your daughter in pink is culturally sexist, it is markedly different from wanting/continuing to exercise an *institutionalized* kind of sexism, one that promotes (or at least used to promote) economic (and with it - social, legal, political, and ultimately cultural) inequality between women and men. Symbols are powerful things. Not only do they indicate ""how things are"", they also reinforce the idea of ""how things should be"", which in many cases means maintaining the status quo (i.e., no change). If you think about how even now the default option is for a child to carry the father's name, and how because of that *women do not even develop the expectation of passing on their name*, OP's ""grief"" over his ""lost name"" seems a little presumptuous. It's like, dude, women don't even get to think about that, so you know, maybe you should get over losing this entitlement. 

&gt;I also think its a little presumptuous to assume that it's all egotistical and due to unwarranted self important that a man wants his son to carry on his last name? 

It's egotistical, I think, because - and you may not like to hear this either - because ultimately, no matter how you look at it, no matter how you spin this, but ultimately **no one in the world gives a shit whether your name lives or dies. No one.** Just you (or OP, in this case) and maybe your son/s, if you raise them in that same tradition. Ask yourself, why should the world care? Who do you think you are that you think that this is somehow an important issue to anybody else? Some last names have already died out, so what? The people who had those names are long gone, and that's it. Think of your own last name: say, one of your ancestor whose last name you inherited lived in 18th or whatever number'th century. Does it matter to you? Does it matter to them that you live and have their last name? Obviously, I'm talking in absurd terms here, but that's why hopefully it should be clear that this whole obsession (or a milder version of it) with ""passing on my last name"" is absurd. It just doesn't make sense. And it's egotistical/self-celebratory because it's based on an assumption that the world will lose something valuable if your last name dies out, which is a laughable idea, really. What's that? You don't care about the world? You only care about how you feel about it? Q.E.D.",2015-09-22 01:49:40+00:00,cv9qbbs,5.0,t1_cv9jbrn,11760.0,predaddit
566,"OK, here's what I think to be clearer.

I'm not saying people shouldn't have gender disappointment. There are different reasons for wanting a certain gender for your baby. Some parents envision playing sports with their sons, or doing braids for their daughters, or what have you, and then they experience gender disappointment and need to adjust their expectations, and I have no problem with that. But wanting a son because of your name, to pass your name down, as one of the commentators noted on here, is patriarchal bullshit. To me this ""reason"" is all about the man's ego and unwarranted sense of self importance. And it is something that women do not experience really, just because the society at one point decided that it's men's names that will be passed down, not women's.

I think my comments can be helpful for OP to perhaps see why his disappointment is unwarranted and possibly help him overcome it (OK, I could have used this word instead of ""ridiculous"", but really it doesn't change my point).",2015-09-21 21:40:44+00:00,cv9hegr,5.0,t1_cv9gv6z,852.0,predaddit

603,"Actually, maybe not so much anymore, since it's pretty clear to everyone and himself that Novak is just a superior player now. But when he was still no 1, he just couldn't take Novak's success, for example. Just refused to acknowledge that Novak was a quality player. One example comes to mind - when they played a US Open semi-final, and Novak played lights out shots on Federer's match points (the ones that Novak later described as ""I just closed my eyes and went for it""), Federer was asked about those matchpoints, and Federer said something to the tune of ""Are you kidding me? Any junior can hit those shots"". And that he just for the longest time couldn't come to grips that Djokovic was actually a real champion. He was okay with Rafa challenging him, but couldn't accept Novak as another worthy challenger. ~~But he ate shit in the end~~

Or when he was losing the 2009 US Open final to Del Potro, and had an argument with an umpire (which he rarely does), and he acted like an entitled little brat, saying stuff like ""Don't tell me what to do, okay?"" And you could just tell that he was mightily annoyed that someone dared to challenge him in the match, and he was losing control of the match, and the US Open title was slipping away. He just could not believe it was happening, it seemed.

Or, the Aussie Open final 2009, when he lost to Nadal, and let those famous waterfalls out. That's when I realized that he wasn't such a humble guy actually, because instead of giving the spotlight to the worthy winner, he grabbed all that spotlight with his floods of tears. LIke, he was completely comfortable standing on the stage in front of a mike, and fucking crying to the whole world. Hey, give the stage to the winner! Noooo, I wanna cry and make everybody (including the winner) sorry that I lost ~~and because someone took my toy away~~. Like he made it all about himself, when he should have been Nadal's shadow in the trophy ceremony.

So it was also both exciting and terrifying for me. And whenever I gave in to the worries, my husband always had the most reassuring words, even though I'm sure he's been equally terrified. He'd just say with so much conviction ""don't worry, everything will be fine"", that it immediately had a calming effect on me. Made me feel very secure and at peace with everything.

723,"Alright, let's do this.

&gt;You talk about my value judgements, yet that is almost entirely what the author bases her article on
 
&gt;Whether his comment is sexist, is down to opinion.

There's opinion, and there's expert evaluation. You can have an opinion, say, about a painting but an arts scholar/expert will be able to explain in far more detail why a painting is good/bad. You can insist on saying that you like/dislike the painting, and your opinion may go against that of the scholar's but it will remain just that - your opinion, whereas the scholar will be able to defend his/her points simply because he/she studied art history for years. His/her opinion is just much better informed. Similarly, there's an entire field of gender studies which studies gender relations and construction of gender in the society/culture, and there's a big community of scholars who agree on what constitutes sexism. The author of the article is consistent with that school of thought. You can disagree all you want, but they collectively have devoted a great deal of time and effort into thinking about these problems. Reality is that some opinions are just more valuable than others. I find it ironic that you call the article ""full of itself"" when you're the one who's full of him/herself, unknowingly displaying your ignorance.

&gt;I think it's ridiculous to look at it that closely

Ok, thank you for your opinion. :) 

&gt;to the point of analysing Stan's response (the actual victim) and turning the finger towards him...

The finger in the article is pointed towards sexism inherent in the comment (by NK) and the response (by SW). The author is not making serious accusations of SW, in fact, she says ""sexims affects us all"", and ""the Swiss unintentionally endorses this set of assumptions"". She understands that Stan did not mean to be sexist, but that sexism is simply present in the situation. Man, this is just plain reading and comprehension skills. Do I have to do everything for you?

&gt;they aren't wrong points, I just don't think they are necessary.

Well, why the hell not? Why are they not necessary, especially, considering that, you know, they aren't wrong? :) Who are you to say that they are not necessary? Not necessary for you or what? Or where? Or when? What do you mean by that? 

&gt;You seem to be offended by the caricature thing.

Of course not, don't be silly. 

&gt;it tells you how to think and insults several people along the way.

Again, ironic, since in a previous paragraph you gave me plenty of advice on how to act. :) And I don't share your belief that the article insults anyone.

I also don't want to offend you but you are just ignorant, and on top of that don't make good arguments at all. Fortunately, there are ways to fix that (e.g., read more on the topic and study formal logic, perhaps). Have a good day too! ",2015-08-19 00:26:38+00:00,cu7p44o,14.0,t1_cu7hyr7,11969.0,tennis
724,"Ok, here we go.

&gt;not the easy way out of blocking your ears

I wasn't blocking my ears. I read what you wrote, and saw so many poorly constructed arguments that I decided not to engage further. This has nothing to do with ""blocking my ears"". 

&gt;It's hypocritical to say that I have poor reasoning, when I'm the one willing to understand your side

Why is this hypocritical? See, that's the kind of reasoning that doesn't make sense to me. Are you equating reasoning skills with willingness to listen? Because that's what follows from this sentence.

&gt;You replied to the top comment and said that you're disappointed with the lack of support for this article and your point. Don't mistake that for people being unreasonable or sexist themselves,

I'm not mistaking that for ""people being unreasonable..."" Where did that come from? What makes you think I'm making a judgement mistake here? Again, another weak/confusing logic here. 

&gt;If what he said was truly sexist, it wouldn't take the author of the article an entire essay to tell the reader why

Really? Why is that? Do sexist comments have to be obvious? They can be subtle and/or implicit, which is the case here. Again, I don't know where you pulled this argument from. 

&gt;She's digging so deep into what he said that it becomes ridiculous.

In your assessment - maybe. In mine, it isn't ridiculous. What you think is ridiculous may not necessarily seem ridiculous to other people. This is not even an argument, just your impression. 

&gt;I could easily write an article about why Kyrgios' statement is racist because...

Sure, knock yourself out. I'll be happy to read that for my amusement. 

&gt;He is an asshole for saying that, but it has nothing to do with gender.

On the surface, it doesn't. I agree with you here. But the author is unpacking his comment, and places it in the context of gender attitudes, and that's the whole point of the article. 

&gt;please don't become a caricature

I don't think I am, thank you very much. Again, what seems to be a caricature to you, may not seem so to others. So, again, another value judgement here. 

&gt;Don't take little things and make big things out of them, look at actual sexism and argue/fight about that.

This isn't little or big. It's an analysis of a comment from a particular perspective. And yes, it does communicate ""actual sexism"", as the article explains. Again, sexism can be subtle and deeply embedded in people's attitudes and sometimes they don't even realize that, and it may not be obvious at the first glance. That's what the article does - analyzes why it is sexist. 

&gt;It's a lot easier to listen to someone talk about women's rights when they're reasonable, than when they write essays about a 1 sentence insult. 

Easier for whom? You? Are you the ultimate authority on what's easy and what's not? And even if it is easier, so what? What point are you even trying to make here?

&gt;Don't be that, cause people's opinion of you will instantly drop when people hear that.

Are you saying that I should only tell people what they like/want to here or agree with? And even if people's opinion of me drops, so what? Why should I be concerned with that? 

Conclusion: your ""arguments"" are filled with value-laden opinions that lack validity outside of your own head. If you're gonna come up with the same line of reasoning again, I may run out of patience and simply ignore you.

No, if he wasn't buying this whole sexist cultural ethos, he could have said ""I don't care who bangs whom"" or ""I don't see why this should be insulting to me"" or something to that effect. But he went for the ""I'm offended"" stance. Which is exactly the proof that he agreed with NK that it was insulting. Ask yourself, why should that be insulting? What is so insulting about it? It is only insulting if it's undermining you or your girlfriend. Why is this undermining?  

&gt;obviously there was no ""Serena's a sexist"" outcry (not that there should have been).

Because it wasn't sexist, obviously. Both men and women can have a ""black heart"". However, when it comes to sex, there are double standards at play (see the ""stud vs. slut"" point in the article). In short, it's okay for guys to sleep around, but less so for women. That's why NK's comment was sexist. 

I don't know how many times I can repeat myself or the points from the article for you to understand. If you keep insisting that NK's comment wasn't sexist, I'll just you know, let you be. ",2015-08-17 19:37:48+00:00,cu67oqf,6.0,t1_cu66xli,1113.0,tennis
735,"&gt;Why is it objectification?

So, we have a situation here where a woman's behavior is a cause of concern for men, and is used as an instrument of shaming and undermining a man. These men just showed us that, sadly, women are still, or can be, treated as some kind of extension of men (""property"" in the article). In other words, objectification here is manifest via seeing women through a prism of only having relevance to men's lives rather than seeing women as being independently valuable and deserving merit and respect on their own. From the article: ""Make no mistake: this is all about men and hetero-masculinity"". 

&gt;I don't think NK was so much saying ""you got sloppy seconds"" as much as he is saying ""your girlfriend's last fling was with a 19 yr old."" 

I don't know why you think that that's what NK had in mind when he said that. I don't know why you disagree that NK wasn't implying ""you got sloppy seconds"". Obviously, neither of us has been to NK's head to know exactly what he meant here, but normally that kind of comment implies ""someone else has been there, you're a fool by getting sloppy seconds"". I don't know, maybe your universe is different, but what the article is saying is consistent with what I have experienced in mine.

&gt;He wasn't defending a piece of his property, but defending his friend/someone he cares about

Well, why did he then say ""I wouldn't say this to my worst enemy""? Clearly, he took it personally. There was nothing, literally zero, in his comments about defending someone he cares about. It was all about how he, himself, was insulted, not about how he was insulted for Donna.

Part of that culture is treating women as a commodity/object, that are seen through a prism of only having relevance to men's lives rather than being independently valuable and deserving merit and respect on their own.

Further, it is unclear from Kyrgios' comment whether he was necessarily referring to cuckolding per se. If  Kokkinakis had sex with Vekic while she was already seeing Wawrinka that would imply cuckolding. Otherwise, there's no cuckolding between the three.

Which sucks, and it shouldn't be like this, but these men just showed us that, sadly, women are still, or can be, treated as some kind of extension of men or something. 

It's also interesting to note that Kyrgios didn't choose to get under Wawrinka's skin by telling him that he had cheated on his wife, for example, or that he wasn't a good husband/father, or for leaving his family. No, he chose to hurt him with a comment about how his girlfriend had been ""banged"" by another man (note the derogatory verb here too). Like that was supposed to lower Wawrinka's status, or something to that effect, no?
