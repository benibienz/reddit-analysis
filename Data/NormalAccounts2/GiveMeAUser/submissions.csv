Hoping to get some help from our collective brain here. 

I'm working with some survey data, and I want to create a classification, where respondents are grouped in several distinct groups based on how they responded to certain survey questions. 

I also need to describe the process of how I created the resulting classification. For that, I've been trying to locate some literature about ""principles of creating classifications"" or ""what is a good classification"" or some such. I have not found any good sources (e.g., published in peer-reviewed journals), so I was wondering if any one of you knows of such literature? Most of the stuff I've seen is from the field of computer science, where they discuss ""algorithms"" etc., whereas I'm looking for something along the lines of [this document](http://www.cso.ie/en/surveysandmethodology/classifications/whatisaclassification/), which has this useful little snippet: 

*FEATURES OF A CLASSIFICATION*

*It is generally accepted that a standard classification will usually meet a number of requirements which are outlined below.*

*Exhaustive categories  - All survey responses need to fit into the classification structure somewhere*

*Precise and meaningful descriptors for categories - The content of each category in the classification should be clearly defined*

*Conceptually sound - The classification should have a conceptual basis and a logical structure*

*Statistically balanced - In general, survey responses should not fall heavily into one category and sparsely into the other categories*

*Operationally feasible - There is no point in having a classification that cannot be implemented in practice*

*Statistically robust - The classification should be able to be used for a number of years without revision*

*Internationally comparable - The classification should be comparable with any international standard classification""*

The problem with this source is that it seems a bit random - Ireland's Central Statistics Office? Lol, wut? Shouldn't there be some more ""mainstream"" sources on this - either peer-reviewed or some US Census Office or something? 

So, have anyone of you seen anything like that in more ""appropriate"" literature, or can you recommend some leads maybe? Or maybe this source is ""appropriate"" after all? It seems kind of random to use this citation as a basis for creating a classification for a study that I'm hoping to publish?

Also, could you upvote this for higher visibility so that more people could see and hopefully help me find something? 

Thank you so much!!    ",sociology,"Do you know of any good literature on ""classifications""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/50ig08/do_you_know_of_any_good_literature_on/

The post included this article about Bernie, called [""Bernie Sanders Isn't Electable and Here's Why""](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/01/27/bernie-sanders-isn-t-electable-and-here-s-why.html).

In the comments a couple of people agreed and posted another anti-Bernie piece: [""Democrats Would be Insane To Nominate Bernie Sanders""](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/democrats-would-be-insane-to-nominate-bernie-sanders/2016/01/26/0590e624-c472-11e5-a4aa-f25866ba0dc6_story.html).

In both pieces the authors declare that they love/like Bernie, and/or that Hillary has made mistakes, ""but here's the thing"" (and then blah-blah-blah). Their ""arguments"" are purely speculative and fluffy, and to me this reeks of Clinton. ""It's okay to like Bernie, we know you like Bernie, but here's what's wrong with him"" - is something she, or the media supporting her have said before. 

Then, there's this... I don't even know what to call this piece: [""Hillary Clinton Wants To Talk With You About Love And Kindness""](http://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/hillary-clinton-wants-to-talk-to-you-about-love-and-kindness). 

All these pieces have been published in the past two or three days. I wonder if this:

* is a desperate attempt by the Clinton PR machine to do anything;

* is a sign that they're scared/worried; 

* reflects some kind of possible truth? (Could it be? No! It can't be, can it?);

* a little bit of all of the above? 

Yeah, just curious what you guys might think about all this seemingly concerted effort to make voters have doubts about Bernie, and portray Clinton as this amazing candidate or something. What worries me is that there were a few people actually agreeing with all these sentiments in that Facebook post.
