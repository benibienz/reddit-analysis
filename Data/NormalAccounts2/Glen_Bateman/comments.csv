0,Looking at the juices that do well in the AIO I see they are higher in PG. My Royalty II (70% VG) is a bit like sucking mud; good enough taste but you gotta work it. How does the Subvod perform? It's a bottom filler?,2016-08-19 03:55:24+00:00,d6nmlvr,2,t1_d6m6efq,86376,Canadian_ecigarette
1,"I *love* the eLeaf iJustStart. Very good taste. Airy, good draw. I own 2 of them and they have excellent taste.

I also own 3 Joyetech All In One's. They took time to grow on me. More restricted draw than the eLeaf. The taste seems dampened sometimes; where the eLeaf has more ""high tones"" the Joyetech AIO dampens them. But that turns out to be really nice for higher PG juices. Smoother hit in the throat, different more ""woolly"" taste.

What I love about the Joy's is that I have never had a miss filling them. Open, fill, close, bam - you're on. With the eleaf, even when I take great care, tiny droplets can get in here or there and you find yourself cleaning out anything that can be cleaned with paper towel at least 1 out of 10 parts.

Same when you store them. Put an eleaf atomizer away for a bit, carefully, and still you have may have gurgling and what not.

In the end, for **portable** use, go for the Joy AIO. You can loop-the-loop and still vape.",2016-08-18 01:49:17+00:00,d6m1m0w,1,t3_4y7c25,25694,Canadian_ecigarette

75,"You mean that around a camp fire you want to smoke cigs? Have you tried cigs since vaping? I'm freed from them because they just taste horrible. The only reason I bit through the nastiness was knowing that 1) the hit was good and 2) soon enough you don't taste it anymore and it seems nice. Now that I have another option to get nic, I have no more use for the weekends when the lady is gone :)",2016-05-25 01:29:31+00:00,d3iif62,2,t1_d3h8dxf,82885,Canadian_ecigarette
76,"First time I read a reference about that. 

Yeah wasn't it that smoking cessation guy Alan Carr (something like that) who would give as an example to show how *little* power nicotine has that most people, when faced with a situation where smoking just isn't an option, are very capable to go without nicotine for hours -- like on a long flight.

77,"So so so true. 

Congrats on the quitting!

What made you decide to go down in nicotine?

Switching smoking for vaping: family keeps telling me now that *this* will want me go smoke (again). No, no, no, you don't get it; *this* is delicious and fun - smoking isn't. ",2016-05-25 01:22:18+00:00,d3ii4ii,2,t1_d3hcgf8,75515,Canadian_ecigarette
78,I was thinking about your comment and then realized that *besides* the nicotine I also like the vaping itself. I wouldn't on purpose buy a 0mg (or below 6) juice (anymore) but between being out of nicotine and out of juice -- having no option to vape itself strikes me as more bugging. ,2016-05-25 01:19:36+00:00,d3ii0m6,2,t1_d3hk37j,51342,Canadian_ecigarette
79,"It's a fun hobby. Just playing with the juices already. The picking, the filling. Fun.

80,"On the spot. On. The. Spot.

I'm no expert at all so I can just guess. Maybe that although vaping is inhaling and cigs are, cigs still deliver nicotine in a different way. 

I could easily let this go but with a sadness. Like; ""but *why* can I never drink beer anymore?""

And yes, I learned I like nicotine. And I'm perfectly ok with that, the same way I appreciate caffeine. ",2016-05-25 01:14:40+00:00,d3ihtaw,2,t1_d3i02o4,25243,Canadian_ecigarette

89,"I just wanted something else. Went into a shop here. Asked for tabacco with caramel but the guy couldn't find it. Showed me cards and one of them was from Mr Vape which has a gold line: Mr Vape Or. 

It is so hard from the lyrical descriptions to figure out what tastes like what.... It being summerish I thought Miami Vice sounded good. 

WOW. *WOW*. It is THE taste that is switching me from ""hey, give me a tabacco experience"" to ""give me a great taste experience"". 

It is very light but has a satisfaction anyway. It is sweet on the tongue coming out but not too sweet. Very light on the throat but no so light that you're not consuming anything. 

This is a great summer vape but also a great all day vape. No getting fed up here. It makes me want to try their other gold tastes",2016-05-23 03:53:56+00:00,d3fzqw8,1,t3_4kltt4,4891,Canadian_ecigarette
