I'm vaping only a short time and already have set myself the goal to tone it down when talking with smokers :D

OK, be honest here - half the reason I'm slowing myself down is because of the immense brain-pain it gives me:

- ""hey, you should try vaping! It's sooooo cool! You get to 'smoke' whenever you want to at hardly any of the risk""
- ""Yeah...no...well...maybe...I have to read more about it; I heard it contains chemicals that are bad for you""
- &lt;blinks at the 5000+ chemicals, tar loaded nicotine delivery device the person is using&gt; BRAIN PAIN!

This is especially hilarious when it is about ""popcorn lung""

The whole ritual. And hey, yes, probably the nicotine helps too.

Started smoking again a little over a year ago, on and off. Last couple of months have done 3-5 cigs a day. So enjoyable -- but also so guilt inducing. What am I doing to my body? How do I get rid of the smell before ""they"" find out?

Tried some of those depanneur ecigs from Vapur. Liked the ritual of smoking but there's no nicotine in these things, I think.

About a month ago went into a real vape shop and explained that I want to quit regular smoking and want something as close to smoking as possible.

Guy whipped out the iJustStart+. I took it, bought some Vapeur Express Tabbaco Lux and some Gentleman.

Boy, am I *happy* I did so!

The iJustStart+ is the *perfect* device to start vaping. It's small: you can palm it. It has a nice form too it: a bit like a cigar almost. Right now I'm so at home with this thing, so content, that it's hard to see why I would every buy something else.

The tank is easy to fill. There's not a lot you can do wrong.

Operation is simple: press the button and suck. Like a smoker I do mouth to lung and this device is perfect for it. After having looked at some YouTube videos I did some lung hits too but I can't say I'm a fan of this. It was harder on the throat; next morning I felt raw. Taste was....ehhh. If that's a me thing or an iJustStart+ thing -- dunno.

For unclear reasons I've had some gurgling and crispy sounds. Dry sucking no liquid comes through but clearly some goes somewhere. Cleaning carefully doesn't always help; leaving it alone overnight sometimes does but not always.

I've already bought a *second* one so I can change tastes throughout the day. I still much prefer the Gentleman tabacco for ""smoking"" but the flavored stuff is very nice as a switch. I have some without nicotine and just enjoy the sucking, blowing out vape, tasting. Just fun.

If you like smoking but want to stop using cigarettes, I can and do whole heartedly recommend the iJustStart+. These things set you back no more than CAD $50 and it'll be the best smoking money you'll ever spend.

I'm very happy to be able to continue to smoke in a much, much safer way.

PS: week ago had some time to my self and thought I would smoke some cigarettes. Bought me a pack... Boy, do those things taste aweful! I finished the first one but didn't go for a second, instead throwing my pack away. I much prefer the smooth vanilla taste of my Gentleman!",Canadian_ecigarette,eleaf iJustStart+ review from an iJustQuit newbie,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadian_ecigarette/comments/4k0at2/eleaf_ijuststart_review_from_an_ijustquit_newbie/
