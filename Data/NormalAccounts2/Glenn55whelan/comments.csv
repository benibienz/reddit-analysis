I'm not gonna complain if he comes back, it's just that I'd prefer him to announce his retirement and join quietly in the summer with no media circus on top of all the current media hype.

23,"Gerrard never won the league, the media talk about winning the league would be massive and it would create unnecessary pressure.

Klopp has his way of working and if Gerrard is brought in and doesn't agree how things should be done, who do the players listen to, the manager or the club legend? And if the media hears about this, who will the fans side with? Not that I think Gerrard would create such issues but you never know.

What if Klopp starts underperforming? The calls for him to be sacked would gain traction because there's a club legend with ambitions to be a manager sitting on the bench.

What if he isn't a good coach?

What if old players or managers try to plot behind the scenes and leak things and try to install Gerrard as manager if things start to go wrong like some are suggesting Ferguson and the class of 92 have been doing.

Liverpool bias or not I think it's hard to deny he's been underwhelming for his price. Of course he hasn't been terrible but he's been in no way a 28m (or more) player.

**Forwards**: Kolbeinn Sigþórsson (Nantes), Alfreð Finnbogason (Augsburg), Jón Daði Böðvarsson (Kaiserslautern), **Eiður Smári Guðjohnsen** (Molde)

The 23 man group that will go will be announced in a few minutes, I’ll edit this when it has been announced. If Gudjohnsen isn’t picked there will be riots. I’d like to see Diego Johannesson who is half-Spanish/half-Icelandic go but that’s mostly because of his name. I haven’t seen him at all but supposedly he’s been playing well for Real Oviedo.

I can’t describe how excited I am for this. I think 8% of the nation is going to France and I’ve heard there will even be national holiday celebrations on 17th June in Marseille.

I don’t really care how the results will be, I just want us to show the world that we aren’t out of our depth in these tournaments and make the games hard for the other teams. I’ll think we’ll lose against Portugal but if we play will we might get a point or three against Austria and Hungary. I expect Portugal to finish first, Austria second, but I have no idea if we or Hungary get third.
I think we have a very good starting XI but the biggest problem (or at least what I think it is) is defensive depth. The backups are alright but we struggled in the end of the qualifying group and in the friendlies over the past few months when we had to deal with injuries in defense and when we were experimenting with the backups.

I think why have plenty of good options in midfield and attack and players like Gylfi Þór Sigurðsson, Birkir Bjarnason and Alfreð Finnbogason have all been playing well. Our main striker, Kolbeinn Sigþórsson, has supposedly been shit and there are rumours that the other players in Nantes don’t want to play with him, but he always performs for the NT so that’s alright I guess.

It costs around 10 bucks to go to the doctor between 8:00 AM and 16:00 PM. The problem with that is that often you have to wait for up to a month to get an appointment. If you go to the Læknavakt, which is more common, it costs 25 bucks.

The bigger problem is probably the cost of going to a psychologist. A new bill proposes that an appointment will cost 130 bucks instead of 80 like it is now. That's crazy and with mental issues being one of the biggest reasons why young people don't work and drop out of school, it's so stupid to increase the costs.
