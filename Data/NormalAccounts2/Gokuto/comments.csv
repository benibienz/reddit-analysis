It doesn't make Taylor right. The problem was that Taylor lied about hearing the song. Which wasn't true.. In the phone call video he says ""might have sex"" as well, so I don't see how Taylor is right. 

Let's say Kanye West did play the ""owe me sex"" version instead of the ""might have sex"" how does that make Taylor right?

I'm not trying to take too much away from Johnny because he does have free agents under his belt, but I do think partners matter and I think it's extremely impressive that CT gets so damn far with the deck he gets.

The Challenge voting Rook's in the first few weeks and expecting a little respect is there version of an initiation. The whole ""know your place"" shit was kinda ridiculous though, but there's no stopping it.

306,"Not even close to the same. The WWE Universe was booing Reigns showing that they didn't like Reigns and didn't want him in the main event. Them getting Daniel(the guy they actually wanted) to like and endorse him was just them saying: ""YOUR GUY LIKE'S HIM, SO NOW YOU BETTER LIKE HIM!"" It's like you going to the store and wanting Cheetos, but the store clerk keeping trying to tell you to get Doritos instead because he feels they're better. You say ""No I want Cheetos"", but the Clerk says ""But even the Cheetos creator says that Doritos are better! So you definitely want Doritos now right?"" No.. you wouldn't you would just want your bag of Cheetos.

The AJ/Y2J situation is like you going to the store clerk and asking for Cheetos and the store clerk saying ""Oh ok good choice"". Reason why is because AJ never got booed to begin with.. Plus it's not like AJ Styles is getting pushed hard, while everybody actually want someone else. Honestly it's not the same thing. 

&gt; Every member of the Shield was the most liked at one stage and don't try to pretend otherwise.

That's debatable.. Plus that doesn't matter considering what you're trying to say. Even if that was the case, Roman Reigns character was much different in 2015 then it was in the Shield.

351,"&gt; The ""show for wrestling fans"" ROH trails well behind WWE which markets itself towards kids. Why? If you build it, they will come right?
So I ask you again. How many kids do you see at ROH shows? How many kids in your neighborhood are rocking Jay Lethal T-shirts?

The reason why ROH trails well behind WWE is because it doesn't have nearly the amount of exposure WWE has, that's why you don't see Jay Lethal shirts being rocked by kids. It's honestly not even fair to compare the two. 

Also why does it matter that it was 15 years ago or not? I agree with /u/mariuxpunk, kids will naturally follow shit they find interesting and cool, regardless if it's targeted towards them or not. It's why when Youtubers and Viners that do content they consider for older audiences do meet ups, the majority of people that show up are kids, It's why when you play a game like GTA or Call of Duty(which are adult games)online why the majority of people on there are kids, and it's the same reason why during the attitude era a large amount of the fans were kids.

432,"So I feel that I'm pretty good at finding things on the internet so I gave it a shot.  

Information I've gather so far: 

- CM Punk SES gimmick started from Nov 27, 2009 to Sep 24, 2010


- It seems that there has never been a match between Jimmy Wang Yang and R-truth, or there just isn't a single piece of this match ever happening on the internet..which is weird.

- The only Smackdown episode in 2010 from North Carolina was on June 18, 2010 and the pre-show match was  Dos Caras vs. Jason Stone. R-Truth wasn't even on the show, JTG was, but it wasn't with Cryme Time.

- Jimmy Wang Yang wasn't even signed with WWE in June 2010, he was released in April 2010.
