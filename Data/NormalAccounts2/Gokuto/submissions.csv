If you don't understand why I'm saying this.. here's why. Someone made a [""Dean Ambrose is a boring wrestler post""](https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/4z0re2/ambrose_is_a_boring_wrestler/) which made someone else make [This SquaredCircle ""call out"" post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/4z1myx/this_sub_just_turns_on_everyone_its_toxic/) The person who made the call out post tried to make the point that r/SC just turns on everyone they first like. The problem with this persons argument is the fact that he's generalizing r/SC when if you look at the ""Dean Ambrose boring wrestler"" post it has 550 upvotes, but only 67% upvoted and can be considered controversial. Not only that there are multiple people in the comments DEFENDING Dean and giving there opinion with those responses having over 50,75,100+ upvotes.

On top of that the r/SC call out post only been up for a hour and already has 700+ upvotes(76% upvoted).. which means while more agree there are still some that don't. While there are things you can generalize on this sub. Like r/SC opinion on Kevin Owens, alot others you just can't. Plus it's not like people are saying Dean is a boring wrestler without giving points why they feel that way and it works the same with people ""turning"" on Brock. I personally still like Brock, but I can see why some people ""don't wanna see him again"" because they make a good argument. This place has alot of people on this sub and alot of people have different opinions.

This is Why I wish more subs would do polls so we can get a majority opinion for the sub, instead of just cherry-picking threads and post, so I made an official poll to get a clear view for this sub: [Do you think dean ambrose is a boring wrestler?](http://www.strawpoll.me/11055023) ",SquaredCircle,"Reminder: There are 131,000+ people that are subbed to SquaredCircle",https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/4z298f/reminder_there_are_131000_people_that_are_subbed/

First the amount of bitching people did when someone chose Alien was ridiculous. If you don't like the character and think he's cheap and boring fine, but the obvious response to this is: SO WHAT? This is a competitive tournament with a first place prize of 75k, you really think one of those players isn't going to choose a character like Alien because of your entertainment? If I could speak for them for a second ""Fuck your entertainment."" I find Kung Jin to be boring, but if a players' best character is Kung Jin, USE KUNG JIN. At the end of the day it's about two players going against each other with their best and if both of their best is Alien, USE ALIEN.

The other thing people bitched about was ""spamming"". What is spamming?  I believe it's using the same thing over and over right? Well then technically basically every pro player in MKX spams. Because most players only use one combo, maybe two. Even if you're right and they are ""spamming"" 75k is on the line, so once again..SO WHAT? If they can't get out of the move, KEEP DOING THE MOVE. The lamest part about the chat is that they didn't complain about spamming until their guy lost, which is so ridiculous. Everyone bitched about SonicFox ""spamming""(even though it was zoning), but when Scar used like 5 grenades in a row everyone loved it. I don't get the logic, is it because it's a more fancy combo? Spamming is spamming it's doesn't matter imo.

It's so crazy that pro playing has been going on for so long, yet people still don't know the rules of competitive gaming, that there are no rules.",MortalKombat,About fans bitching....,https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/4nom17/about_fans_bitching/

Fortunately /u/batmanforhire confirmed that it was real and told the [source](http://www.mtv.ca/shows/the-challenge/video/the-challenge-extras/the-challenge-battle-of-the-exes-aftershow-ep5/1679688/0/6), but sadly it's on MTV Canada, which most people can't see(**Hola isn't safe**), so while I couldn't get the video, I did manage to get the audio. 

So for the people that wanted to hear it: https://streamable.com/0qrd
