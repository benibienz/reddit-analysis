3,"I always feel like people are sort of missing the point when they hate on that show's ending. Was it rushed? Yes, but the overall point is solid. It's not that he should have been with Robin all along, because she's obviously The One. Or, that he shouldn't have been with Robin after the fact because it lessens his devotion to The Mother. He clearly loved plenty of other people before meeting The Mother, Victoria, That Doctor Lady From House, That Doctor Lady From Scrubs, none of them lessen the ending do they? Ted didn't find his One and lose her, nor was it Robin all along. The overarching theme of the show is this: love is a journey, not a destination. It's cliched, but HIMYM was a pretty cliched show (I still loved it). I think it's unfair to judge the ending too harshly, I think they did a pretty good job.

8,"It's not about difficulty in counting it's about discreet vs. indiscreet things. 
This glass has *less* water, therefore there are *fewer* molecules of water in it.  It's difficult, if not impossible, to exactly count the molecules in a glass but it doesn't matter because you're talking about individual things and not a general concept of ""water""

As another example if you went to a party and said ""there were less people than I expected"" you'd be wrong because we wouldn't know what you meant without context clues. Were they skinnier than you thought they would be? All missing limbs? Mentally deficient? The only things we know for certain is that you AREN'T talking about the countable number of people, because then you wouldn't have used fewer.

You want to force them to engage you, and unless it's only a one level difference (and even then be cautious, and if it's a talent level, treat it as 2 levels) you need to be avoiding teamfights like the plague. Your goal is to bait someone into getting greedy so you can get a pick, and then most importantly, disengage, and continue to climb out of your hole. I've so many good plays go bad because the team thinks they can turn 1 kill into 5.
