Seducers set crafted heavy

You can group up with friends and do world bosses and dolmens and delves and quests with this build.

Is it that you want to be able to do trials with these builds? Because these are the end game content specifically designed for the hardcore min maxers. The only content I think you couldn't do this with is literally vet trials and that's it. You can play the game this way in any other capacity that you want.

I believe that if you are so inclined, you could throw on heavy armor and cost redux and magicka recovery and pull out your 2h and BoL your way through vet cradle of shadows (you might have to pull out the resto staff for vet ruins of Mazzatun).

I run 5/1/1 L/M/H for the undaunted bonuses and 5L for the extra spell pen and light armor passives

With my current setup I have 0 problems staying alive unless I do something stupid. I also got the time trial achievement for vMsA with this build and I can consistently get a competitive score. Like I said I don't see a need to take an execute, I guess I could be ""doing it wrong"" but this setup works so well for me as is. 

I don't see a need for a damage shield because I have never needed one. If I ever do die it's because I messed up on my positioning and the damage could have been easily avoided.

I find without area of effect I have no problems single target bursting everything down as soon as it spawns. If AE is absolutely necessary then soul tether + blockade + path is there for infinity damage.

It may depend on the differences in our play styles.

But I'm willing to give your suggestions a try and see how it goes.

5x Julianos
2x Kena
3x WP

You don't need inner light on both bars, just your primary dps bar

You don't need resto back bar unless you NEED it, run 2x destro, run refreshing path and swallow soul or w/e the healing received morph is, and that's your sustain.

I also run mirage on back bar but that's a flex spot I haven't figured out what to do with it. With mirage and refreshing path you have both minor and major ward buffs AND 20% dodge chance at all times. I mean it feels a bit OP. Not to mention refreshing path is also crit healing me for 2-3k every tick

I run entropy just for shits (also major sorcery and the max health and extra mages guild magicka). This lets you get rid of Sap essence which imo is not needed for vMA, as you can single target burst anything down faster and more reliably

I use soul tether on my back bar, but honestly I think this is a crutch. It is literally an oh shit kill everything also make me invincible for 6-8 seconds button.

If you have the money to blow then go for it, also you can go farm mats in Craglorn or Wrothgar for a few hours and probably pull enough materials this way if you are efficient and dedicated.

You can also put together a pretty decent temporary build just buying all of your items with shitty traits off of the guild traders all CP160 for somewhere between 10-20k if you know what you are looking for and actually be just fine until you decide on a set to build.

IMO, this is most easily achieved by:
Go all out magicka.
Get a set of light armor like Julianos/Seducers.
AoE + DoT is the king of speed solo farming

Acquire a Destro flame staff, use destro skill wall of elements at the beginning of every fight and reapply as needed to keep dot up.

Use the following class abilities:
Templar: 
Puncturing strikes &lt; Puncturing Sweep
Spear Shards &lt; Blazing Spear
Sun Fire &lt; Reflective Light
There are other abilities you can use which also do aoe damage but these are probably your bread and butter and may even be overkill. Puncturing sweeps will keep you at full health, seducers will keep you at full magicka, for 0 downtime. honestly probably wouldn't have trouble with julianos either.

Sorc:
Lightning Form &lt; Boundless Storm
Lightning Splash &lt; Liquid Lightning
Surge &lt; Power Surge
?? Win ??
You can add other abilities that you want, maybe a spammable aoe like pulsar? Surge will keep you at 100% health.

Dragon knight:
Fiery Breath &lt; Engulfing Flames
Spiked Armor &lt; Volatile Armor
Dark Talons &lt; Burning Talons
Inhale &lt; Draw Essence
Inhale will keep you 100% health, use your dragons heart self heal before you unlock inhale if you need healing. Probably good to run self heal anyway for + heal effect applied to inhale

Nightblade: this one is a little more tricky I guess but becomes super easy with sap essence
Path of Darkness &lt; Either Morph
Soul Shred Ult &lt; Soul Tether this ability is fking awesome
Use Strife &lt; Swallow Soul for single target dps that you can do forever while staying at 100% health. Weave with light/medium attacks, pair with Siphoning Strikes
Drain Power &lt; Sap Essence *once you unlock this you can use this + Soul Tether ult to kill any group of enemies you can find no matter how many, even if it's 100 mobs

With any of these classes you can pick a spammable cheap AoE ult or destro ult and use it when it's up. Enjoy.

Usually I will use a single target bar and an aoe bar, aoe bar takes care of 80-99% of situations you will encounter, but single target is definitely important for boss fights (can still apply dots from aoe bar)

You can go to any zone you want to, don't think of them as a linear I must go here then here etc. unless you like that and then just continue following the main story line that will take you through the linear story. I personally play on AD but was more intrigued by the DC zones. Before all of this 1T stuff I had to first play through my alliance, then play through all of EP, and THEN get to play through the DC zones. Now I can go anywhere and do anything and feel rewarded, monsters are more of a challenge than before, rewards and set items are more interesting than before, experience, gear etc is scaled to my level. 

I guess TLDR of this post is, if you don't want to jump around zones, then don't? If you're having trouble killing things then try acquiring some of the new set gear and put together some sets which will really help you out.

There are builds that will make leveling and questing fast and easy, but you should still be able to play whatever way you want and not have a crazy hard time killing stuff no matter how oddball your build is.

So it's good that you come into this with an open mind.

The outlook on it that I take is to always always be conscious of your role as a healer and be acutely aware of the times when your primary role is needed. I go in to it with the mentality that if someone dies it's my fault, and how can I predict what is going to happen before it happens to make sure they don't die. Then I can try to see between those moments when I can fit in max dps while still being able to anticipate when my heals and buffs are needed to ensure that everyone is functioning to their full capacity with max uptime.

I also am a firm believer that there can be such a thing as TOO much regen and TOO many resources. If you're constantly fine on magicka and sitting topped off then there is something else can you be doing to contribute to the group. You need to find that fine line between order and chaos, grip those reins, and ride that beast to victory. This may mean changing up your sets a bit. If you have too much recovery, try adding some spell damage etc. Try to hit that point where you're maximizing your contribution to your group with both your time and resources.

Good thing I did, because when he transforms he goes on a rampage and throws his bed and cabinet and door across the room. When he transforms back into a dwarf he looks ashamed of himself and I have him set all of his things back up in their proper place for him to have something to destroy and throw next time he transforms",2016-07-18 19:21:53+00:00,d5h63cy,2,t1_d5gxier,11613,dwarffortress

102,"The PvE side of ESO is heavily dungeon based. There are three alliances (realms/factions) in the game to choose from. Each alliance has its own unique zones (~5-6 zones per alliance I think??).

Each zone has ~4 public dungeons called Delves. Each delve has an associated quest and named ""mini boss"". These delves can be completed solo.

Each zone also has 1 unique public dungeon, with a special in depth fully written and voice acted quest line and several different mini bosses. These public dungeons can be completed with a smaller group or solo if you are experienced.

Each alliance also has several unique instanced group dungeons, these are long instances for a group of 4 players to complete with fully written and voice acted quest lines, mini bosses, and an end dungeon main boss.  The best part about these group dungeons is that many (but not all) can be played on both a normal and an unlocked ""veteran"" version. The quests for both versions are unique but  tell a story that links the normal version to the veteran version. The bosses/mechanics/monsters to fight are different between the normal and veteran version.

Once you reach a certain level, you can start doing pledges, where a faction in the game will give you daily pledges to go complete a specific dungeon on a specific setting for extra loot/xp, sometimes with optional special mechanics on the last boss for increased loot quality/rarity.

I do the pledges with a group of friends on multiple characters daily, there is a lot of variety in the dungeons and mechanics and I still enjoy.

Oh, if that isn't enough, there is a RvRvR PvP zone that also has many unique delves and you can potentially run into players from other alliances there for some interestingly spicy PvPvE action.

Let me know if you have any questions

Edit: I forgot to mention that there are also ""endgame"" dungeons that require more people to complete, have harder content, and greater loot rewards (but not such that you have to do these to remain competitive)

There is also a huge solo ""dungeon"" experience called maelstrom arena that is very challenging and rewarding.",2016-06-03 19:29:46+00:00,d3uv8re,1,t3_4mduh7,9019,MMORPG

Severe latency and crashing issues are starting to bleed into my 4 man dungeon runs as well. It seems to be getting worse with every patch or additional content, although I admit I have not solid metrics to support this other than the knowledge of how the game is supposed to operate at full performance compared to how it is currently and has been operating for a while now.

As far as I know this issue has not been directly addressed and has been downplayed or skirted using excuses similar to what you have been told. I am worried at this point that there is a possibility that there is no intention to fix, and that performance will continue to degrade. It may be that there is some issue with the main code of the game that would be  virtually impossible to fix now but I can only grasp at intangibles.

I run dark flare for single target and regularly crit for 32-38k depending on what group buffs are out. I have ~60% crit chance so this is occurring very often. For group pull damage I run jabs which also contributes a significant amount of damage. Also proxy det and purifying light can add some good damage for your group. 
The best thing about Templar imo is that you can contribute significant damage and also do your job as a healer especially with BoL a click away for oh shit moments.

The jump from 30 to being able to complete one challenger mission to being able to fully gear yourself is like a +inf exponential with gearpower on the y and time invested on the X compared to the rest of the game.

Maybe it's just because we are a solid group and are used to working together so we are efficient, whereas others may not have this opportunity. But the posts I'm talking about are 1000+ like posts with hundreds of comments of excited players who are like right where myself and my group were right before the power spike hit or right at the upturn in the growth curve.

He's pleasant to deal with, very organized, pays amazing attention to detail, and will work with you to figure out what you need and how to get it to you in a way that is convenient for you.

I've had nothing but good experiences with orders placed with Rusty, and the amount of time he is willing to spend to make sure the customer gets exactly what they want as soon as possible is astonishing. It's rare to find someone who is as dedicated to this as Rusty, please use him if you need anything crafted, it's money well spent to support such a welcoming and upstanding pillar of this community.

When we do get in games there's a 50% chance someone in our party gets kicked from the game at some point during the match. So yeah..
