I have read about the high early PC rates and current PC roaming boss farms, but I have not participated in either and still managed to earn enough PC to acquire all the available high end gear that I wanted for my build.

My group was pretty excited to see what new high end stock would come on Friday when that ever present count down reset timer finally hit 00:00.   When I got off work today I was disappointed to see a message from one of my buddies about the stock not rotating even though the timer had gone through a full reset cycle.  Man.  If that wasn't the biggest bag over the head punch in the dick...

It was then that I realized that there is currently nothing left for me to do in this game.  This game that has so much potential just feels sort of empty to me now.  There is nothing for me to work towards.

My group has run the challenging missions enough to know all of the spawn locations and enemy types/counts.  We have double digit clears on all of the dark zone encounters in all zones.

I enjoy playing the game but there is really nothing for me to DO anymore, short of making another character and doing it all again, which I don't really personally find fulfilling.

So what could change to fix this?

Missions-
Add more group missions (raids?) with a variety of mechanics. Most of the available missions fall into the category of sprint here and kill these baddies and push this button to unlock this door or call this elevator to sprint here and kill these baddies to... 
Challenger difficulty kicked our ass at first and was awesome but after a couple of completions we had all the necessary gear and knowledge to breeze through. The first couple run through a of a mission on challenger was fun to figure out but now it just feels stale when you know exactly what to expect every single time.
Open up all of the missions to challenger difficulty and don't stop there, keep introducing new missions to give us some actual new and rotating content please!  There are so few options for challenger difficulty missions that they quickly become stale and ""hard"" is simply a joke:

Dark Zone - 
So much potential that was just not capitalized on. There are so many posts out there about what is wrong with the dark zone and how it can be fixed that I don't think I need to touch on it here much at all.  So what do I have to say here?
The dark zone currently offers nothing for end game except more pve grind, and this needs to change.
This is a multiplayer tactical squad based shooter. Give. Us. PVP. Seriously, how does this awesome game with awesome mechanics and awesome multiplayer capability with potentially awesome ""open PVP"" manage to have virtually 0 PvP short of cheese and ganks??? 
I would love to have some, any pvp. Give me a platform to use my hard earned gear. I put in the time to hone my skills and learn your engine and its quirks. Give me a challenge that AI can never offer and let me compete against other players.

You could simply add a zone or section of the map that is just truly open world pvp with no consequences. If you are someone who doesn't care for pvp, don't go to this zone.

You could add structured squad based pvp deathmatch and/or objectives modes.

This would give us something to do other than running the same missions over and over or running the same dz farm route (but why even farm DZ when it's not really worth it?).  The best part about pvp is that it is dynamic. PVP adds infinitely more content than you could ever script into any AI or pve missions (don't get me wrong, I love pve too and still want more of these as well). All you have to do is provide the battleground. You are so close. This game, as great as it is, has so much more potential. Please don't sell us and yourselves short.


Following the progression of posts on this Reddit it looks to me like the majority of the player base is rapidly coming up on this same point in the game right about now or will very soon. Maybe this will naturally cause changes in the current mood of the dark zone, but only time will tell. In the mean time there isn't much for me to do but wait and see and hope for the best.


tldr; reached endgame and completed all content, nothing left for me to do and only 10 days after release. Please add more missions and fix dz and/or implement pvp.  This game is awesome and has so much potential but there is basically nothing fulfilling or dynamic left for me to do in the game.
