At this point, I feel like I'm heading for success. I feel the story is so interesting that my book will definitely sell. At the same time, my gut tells me to be careful of being naive. I saw you mentioning that it took you eight years to publish! :O So, my question, do you have any tips on how I can tweak the first stages of finding an agent and getting news about my book out there?
