I already have a druid I just leveled to 100

I'm a tier 1 noob, but I will learn quickly (I want to do everything: arena, BG, RBG, world PVP). On my druid I will try both feral and resto. So, will it be redundant to choose another class that can heal?

Here are my thoughts so far. Please add anything you can/want

Paladin looks fun and I don't see why people say it's boring. I'd roll holy and be able to do many different comps with my friend(s). i could even do insane burst dmg (apparently)

Warrior looks insanely fun! And having fun while I do pvp is a must! Admittedly, i like wtching Bajheera smash fools in his streams. But surely he makes it look fun because it really is? Also, i see A LOT of warriors in the arena rankings so it seems you ca really take this class far

Shadow priest, again, looks like a spec that would yield amazing results if one sticks to it and practices it. But apparently then I'll only be rolling god comp? Of course, I can also roll disc and do 2v2 with my friend's hunter.

Lastly, lock. I'd roll affliction and just run around melting face. Seems fun enough (but all in all I don't know much about locks)

I left out rogues, monks, mages, shamans etc because I've played them before and I'm looking for a new experiene

Another thing is that I'll be playing with my good friend (social aspect is where its at for me)
My friend always plays horde, so I'll probably be doing the same.
He has some level 100's on Ghostlands. So I've started leveling some toons there, but the realm looks a bit small and I don't imagine there'll be any big world pvp events.

So I've also read up on Defias Brotherhood, which is apparently really nice. Then there's the whole ""go alliance and play outlands or sylvanas"" vibe, but if that'll mean long queues all the time, I don't want in.

Another option: Twilight's Hammer. Apparently there's a South African (my nationality) guild there called ""pap en vleis"". Playing with some other South African peeps would also be great.

My friend would recreate a character with me on any realm. And then we'd like to try our hand at pvp.
