0,"He didn't ""predict"" it per say, but he did place a bet on it with Kevin preseason. So take that as you will. Chris doubled down today and said he thinks Trent should come in at LG when he comes back. 

I just think it's something the team shouldn't totally write off. Trent is such an elite athlete that it's worth considering. ",2016-11-22 00:54:07+00:00,daabngx,4.0,t1_da9cmfe,53399.0,Redskins
1,Chris Cooley predicted Trent to start at LG in the pre-season on ESPN980. I think when Trent comes back they need to take a long look at this lineup and really think about it. They ended the Giants game in week 3 like this and Trent played great at LG.,2016-11-21 08:43:49+00:00,da9bada,2.0,t1_da98fm2,8068.0,Redskins

The replies never directly answered your question. Did you end up getting Red Zone and trying this? Can you watch on your laptop? I'm also in the same situation.",2016-10-25 21:01:42+00:00,d97kn6e,,t1_d6wat39,,PS4

6,"For a 4-team play off, where the championship is 2 weeks, (weeks 15 &amp; 16), the first round of the playoffs start in week 14. But the current settings don't allow for this. 

How do I manually start the playoffs for 4 teams in week 14?",2016-08-15 08:00:03+00:00,d6i2lc9,2.0,t1_d6h0nx9,66846.0,fantasyfootball
7,"I was there from 5pm-9pm today (7/27) and saw about 10, and walked away with about 8 or so. Charmander seemed to appear more near Cupid's Span, and around the Epic steak house.

Cupid's Span all the way up to the Ferry Building is a great area for catching Pokemon. Tons of Dratini, Magikarp, Tentacool and Pysduck. Most of the Pokestops (I think there are like, 15 between Cupid and the Ferry Building) were lured up for the entire 4 hours as well. 

Crowds and Pokemon frequency started to die around 8:30. I have a hunch that Pokemon appearances is affected by user activity.

Hope this helps, happy hunting!",2016-07-28 08:48:06+00:00,d5u7h38,1.0,t3_4ux2of,40856.0,pokemongoSF

12,"I don't think people are taking into account what OP would have done if he knew going into Monday that he was down. He would have started someone if he KNEW he was going to lose otherwise. You can't predict stat corrections. I hear what everyone is saying about tie-breaker points, but wins are more important than points, which is why record counts first.
