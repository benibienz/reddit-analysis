I believe this is a common setting on ESPN.

I'm setting up my league now, and it looks like they removed this feature? [Screenshot here](https://scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13939316_10207576137141490_4232739955821854817_n.jpg?oh=6eb0b24b87d678853698fda334d55b7a&amp;oe=584FBD67)

Has anyone else noticed this? Am I crazy, or did they actually take this away? I know that [basketball](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybball/comments/40q5is/yahoo_is_unable_to_offer_2_week_championships/) experienced a similar issue earlier this year, but it looks like Yahoo has removed this feature for football as well?
