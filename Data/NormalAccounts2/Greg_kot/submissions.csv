I've heard people say this isn't possible but I've been doing it for a while; in Sanctuary I have trip wires set up that, when activated, release ghouls to attack the intruders. It also powers on turrets too. I linked up 4 cages but, frankly, 4 charred ghouls were slaughtering the intruders and causing more settlement damage than the initial intruders (a few raiders here and there) ever would have done. So I cut it back to 2 cages.

It's difficult to explain in text so I've also made a youtube vid to demonstrate it (also my first real video!!). there's a short version and a longer version that has an intro and you see it in action... when Preston, the twat, sets it off by accident.

Short version: https://youtu.be/oo843t3d9qA
Long (Twat Preston) version: https://youtu.be/mctpiZFIu6c

Does it make sense? I'd be interested to see what people then create based on this!",falloutsettlements,I made trip wires that release ghouls from cages :-),https://www.reddit.com/r/falloutsettlements/comments/4j9kgs/i_made_trip_wires_that_release_ghouls_from_cages/
