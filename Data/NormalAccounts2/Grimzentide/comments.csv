&gt; When you installing pyirsdk you also got irsdk.exe script in X:\Python33\Scripts directory, which you can use for:
&gt; 
&gt; Dump current iRacing state to binary file irsdk.exe --dump data.bin
&gt; 
&gt; Parse dumped binary file to txt file irsdk.exe --test data.bin --parse data.txt
&gt; 
&gt; Parse current iRacing state to readable txt file irsdk.exe --parse data.txt
&gt; 
&gt; Now, when you write your own scripts, for test purposes you can pass binary file to irsdk, instead of keep iRacing simulator always running
&gt;

&gt; import irsdk
&gt; ir = irsdk.IRSDK()

You can start on the python side without spending any money.  Install python, yaml and the iRacing SDK and start getting data out of iRacing.  Quick, easy and documented at the [Python iRacing SDK GitHub](https://github.com/kutu/pyirsdk).

You can make the exact same program but print it to a console instead of sending it to an arduino.  This is exactly what I did before I even started looking at directing the output to another device.

35,"I thought I would share a little project I have been working on and seek some advice on what else to include in it. 

Recently I have been working on an Arduino based TFT device that can help me with pit strategies. A python program runs in the background and updates the Arduino Uno via USB serial port and displays the information on a small touch screen. 

So far I have implemented: 

* session laps 
* laps completed 
* laps remaining 
* fuel remaining 
* laps until I run out of fuel 
* how much fuel I will require at the next stop 
* which lap I should pit on 
* 5 lap average fuel burn 
* race fuel burn 

 

I am thinking of using the blank box in the to show information such as current flag (I'm colorblind and find it somewhat difficult), incident count, and what ever this thread can come up with? 

I still have a lot of coding to do to make it work for timed races, practice sessions, exception handling, optimization of the code and GUI alignment.
