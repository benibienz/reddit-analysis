The hardware costs about $13 for the 2 parts on eBay and the software I developed for it is free and open source.

^^^^^.

The iRacing Arduino Pit Board is an Arduino based device that can help with pit strategies by giving you live up to date information about your fuel requirements in any session online or offline, including those races that require one or more pit stops. An executable program runs in the background on your computer and reads the live telemetry data coming out of any iRacing session and calculates when you should and/or need to stop and how much fuel you need to add to finish. The application then sends updates to the Arduino Uno via the USB serial port and displays the information on a small touch screen.

^^^^^.

Here is v0.9 in action (current version is v1.4):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrubmpEYgn8

^^^^^.

Features: 

* session laps / time 
* laps completed 
* laps / time remaining 
* fuel remaining 
* laps until you run out of fuel 
* how much fuel you will need to add at the next stop 
* imperial and metric fuel calculations 
* 5 lap average fuel burn 
* race fuel burn 
* which lap you should pit on 
* pit windows to make it to the end with only one more stop 
* weather and session information 
* Information on when your last stop was 
* shows the amount that should be in your tank when you leave the pits 
* target burn rate if you need a splash and dash for less than 1 lap worth of fuel 
* warning flashes to help inform the driver that something critical needs attention (eg box this lap)

^^^^^.

**Note:** The calculations for required fuel automatically includes an extra half of a lap to ensure you can cross the finish line. The half lap fuel figure is calculated using half of the current 5 lap average fuel burn rate.

Which track(s) would you purchase if iRacing were to lazer scan and then release? 

^^^^.

The form asks you to answer two (2) simple questions. 

1) Select where in the world the circuit/track is located? 

2) Select the name of the circuit/track from the list? 

^^^^.

I have tried to capture as many oval, road and street circuits from around the world as I can, but if you have one that is not listed, feel free to add it in the form. 

^^^^.

Feel free to make multiple submissions and I will post the results every few days.
