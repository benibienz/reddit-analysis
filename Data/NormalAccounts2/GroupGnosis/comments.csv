Your assumptions and options look correct. 

There is potentially a way to extend the marketplace. In our proposal to create DAO_yes/no and Eth_yes/no tokens, a mechanism could also be included to implement the proposal with the greater exchange rate, or this could be factored into the greater voting process.

A prediction market can be more meaningful particularly when conditional markets are used. For example ""what will the DAO token value be if this proposal is implemented"".

Here's how it would work. You exchange your one DAO token for a ""DAO_proposalyes"" and a ""DAO_proposalno"" token. Each token returns either nothing or one DAO token depending on the corresponding decision. 

If you do not like the proposal you would first vote ""no"". You would then exchange your DAO token for both tokens. You would keep the ""DAO_proposalno"" token and you would trade your ""DAO_proposalyes"" token for a (or a fraction of a) ""Eth_proposalyes"" token (done on an open market). 

If the proposal is not accepted, then your ""DAO_proposalno"" token is then redeemable for a DAO token. If the proposal is accepted, then your ""Eth_proposalyes"" token is redeemable for an Eth. 

If there are no counterparties willing to buy the ""DAO_proposalyes"" token then that would be an issue, however if there are enough votes to approve the proposal then this would be unlikely!",2016-05-16 20:58:55+00:00,d37ykjv,2.0,t1_d37xvn3,945.0,TheDao

92,"Hey Housemobile,

Our markets are on GroupGnosis.com - please note that you currently need a local Geth node to place bets. We are currently tweaking and testing a remote node + wallet. 

EDIT: The main difference between Gnosis and Augur is the way how our event resolving works. Augur uses its reputation token system. Anyone who owns REP can participate in the voting process to select the right outcome. Those who vote for the finally selected outcome are rewarded.  In contrast Gnosis can work with any kind of oracle. We are starting with our own oracle ""Fact server"", which relys on Gnosis as third party to resolve events. But our contracts allow to work with any kind of oracle. In theory we could even use Augurs results, as soon as they are written on the chain. To create a market on Augur or on Gnosis a Market Maker has to provide some funding to fund the automated market maker. The only compensation for this investment are fees collected from users betting on those markets. The downside of Augur's system is that market makers have to split the collected fees with the people participating in the voting process. Unlike Gnosis, where market makers pay nothing for the Fact server information.",2015-09-15 15:14:08+00:00,cv2e5ke,2.0,t1_cv1mwld,61967.0,ethereum

97,"Thank you christianlundkvist for clearing up misconceptions.

We thank the community for bringing up these valid concerns and want to foster clarity around these issues. We did our own investigation and tested go-node settings in our network to make sure they actually work.

So far we can confirm that NOT setting the --rpcaddr option will prevent geth from accepting connections from other computers. The default setting for --rpcaddr is 127.0.0.1, which means that only local connections are accepted. 

If you start your go-node with the settings requested by groupgnosis (geth --rpc --rpccorsdomain ""http://groupgnosis.com"" --unlock &lt;YourAccount&gt; '&lt;Password&gt;') your accounts are not vulnerable to this particular attack. Only the groupgnosis dApp can access your unlocked account.

99,"We apologize for the lack of communication. That is something we are going to change. We will be posting a full FAQ this coming week as well as updating the site with more information and markets. 

The best solution for using Gnosis at the moment is to open a geth rpc node with a coinbase that only contains as much as you are willing to lose. Do not unlock the account until right before you make a purchase. In your rpc terminal (if you don't have one running use &gt;geth attach) type;
     personal.unlockAccount(eth.coinbase, ‘Password’, 30)
Then place your bet within 30 seconds. This is not the best solution but we are working on a better one. Stay tuned for more updates!",2015-08-29 02:39:12+00:00,cujdc4g,6.0,t1_cujb1yw,4723.0,ethereum
