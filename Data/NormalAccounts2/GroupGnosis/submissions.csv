We want to make the best possible product and you are helping us get there! Now the updates:

**1. Remote Ethereum Node:** you no longer need to be running a local ethereum client to use Gnosis. This means that Gnosis is now accessible from anywhere regardless of your local machine.

**2. LightWallet browser integration:** The LightWallet allows you to have control over your private keys without having to run a local Ethereum node. The private keys are created from the seed and encrypted in the browser. You can then sign transactions in the browser and send the signed transaction to a remote (or local!) node. Gnosis does not hold any of the funds in your wallet.

**3. Bitcoin deposit:** No we have not yet solved cross chain exchanges but we have enabled Shapeshift.io for making deposits in ETH even easier.

**4. New Markets:** Who will win the MLB National League Division Series?... Who will be the next GOP candidate to drop out of the US presidential race? … Will the Patriots go 4-0 in week 4? .. Check GroupGnosis.com for all current markets !

Please let us know what you think!

We strive to bring you the best product but it is worth noting that Gnosis is still in ALPHA and there may be bugs. While we think it is a safe platform please note that you are using Gnosis at your own risk.

So far the difficulty market is way more popular with &gt;70 trades in the last 24h. - Our first thoughts are that it resovles sooner (the next 6 hours) and it might be easier to understand the payouts (0 or 1) compared to the long/short share. (and the graph is nicer :))

Anyway, we are thinking about what market  to add next. We would like to make a „dependent“ market - so something in the form of: What is the likelihood of X if A happens before. And: ""What is the likelihood of X if B happens before.“ And also  a market for A vs. B.

A future example would be: What is the likelihood of the democrats winning the 2016 election as X.  And A and B are: Trump becomes the Republican  candidate, Trump does  not become the Republican. candidate.

Another example (for a long term resolvement)  would be price of Bitcoin based on  the condition if block size limit increase vs. the price of Bitcoin with no block limit increase.

We are really looking forward to creating those markets but currently we need something more short term (2-14 days)  
  
**TL;DR**: We want to hear from our users! Any ideas for a new market that can end in the next 2-14 days? Or any other suggestions for markets to get Gnosis started? ~We acknowledge that unlocking an RPC node is a vulnerability. *Please do not play (or open an RPC node)  with more than you are willing to lose.*  
  
EDIT:  
**PLEASE READ: remember we are in ALPHA**
  
The best solution for using Gnosis at the moment is to open a geth rpc node with a coinbase that only contains as much as you are willing to lose. Do not unlock the account until right before you make a purchase. In your RPC terminal (if you don't have one running use  `geth attach` ) type; 

     personal.unlockAccount(eth.coinbase, ‘Password’, 30) 

Then place your bet within 30 seconds. This is not the best solution but we are working on a better one. Stay tuned for more updates!",ethereum,What markets should we add next to Gnosis?,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3is508/what_markets_should_we_add_next_to_gnosis/
