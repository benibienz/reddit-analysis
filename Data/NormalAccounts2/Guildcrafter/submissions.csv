I want these to be run only when a player rightclicked a carrot on a stick. I have a scoreboard called click of type stat.useItem.minecraft.carrot_on_a_stick
Currently my setup is like this:

    1.CMD, repeating: /scoreboard players tag @a[score_click_min=1] add 1_0_shoot {SelectedItem{id:""minecraft:carrot_on_a_stick"",Count:1b}}

(this one gives the error message ""commands.scoreboard.players.tag.tagError"")

    2.CMD, chain: /testfor @a[tag=1_0_shoot]

    3.CMD, chain, conditional: /say test

(only to see is a player is found and to filter the impulses so the following commands only get executed when a player is found)

    4.CMD, chain: The commands generated by the filter, all unconditional

    5.CMD, chain: /scoreboard players tag @a remove 1_0_shoot

    6.CMD, chain: /scoreboard players set @a click 0

Is this the right order, and if yes, what is the problem with the first commandblock?

So I set up the scoreboard DropBook (stat.drop.minecraft.written_book) and wanted to constantly give every dropped written book the tag ""AdminBook"", execute a teleport command by the book and finally kill the book with these commands written in three repeating commandblocks (and yes, all of them point towards the next, are set to unconditional and always active):

* /scoreboard players tag @e[type=Item] add AdminBook {Item:{id:minecraft:written_book}}
* /execute @e[tag=AdminBook] ~ ~ ~ /tp @e[score_DropBook_min=1,r=5] @e[name=205]
* /kill @e[tag=AdminBook]

When I then drop the book - nothing happens.
I have to execute the first command manually or with an impuls cmd-block, then I get teleported and the Item gets killed. Now I am wondering whether this is a bug or a security precaution (for a to me unknown reason).",Minecraft,Some commands don't get executed by repeating commandblocks in 15w36d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/3juvwb/some_commands_dont_get_executed_by_repeating/

When you are on level 0 whlie not flying you can not fall deeper, can't jump and slide like on ice, both in creative and survival. When you fly below you are able to fly normaly, but when you stop flying you are stuck on the heightlevel you stopped, you can neither go up nor down. To get out, just fly.

After a bit of testing I realized, this only applys for players: every single entity falls down as it used to.
