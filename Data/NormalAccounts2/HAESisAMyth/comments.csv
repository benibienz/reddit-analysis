I've heard (but don't know) that they have RNC hacked emails.  But yet they focused on the DNC emails.  To them, there can't be a ""put politics aside"" discussion when, if true, the holding back of RNC emails would be an overtly political strategy to hurt Clinton/Support Trump.  

Separating the actual motive and the motives outcome is hard. Attacking Clinton isn't supporting Trump, but sometimes it sure seems so.

Jack Daniel's is not a bourbon - it's a Tennessee Whiskey. Jack Daniel's is dripped slowly - drop-by-drop - through ten feet of firmly packed charcoal (made from hard sugar maple) before going into new charred oak barrels for maturing. This special process gives Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey its rare smoothness. It's this extra step - charcoal mellowing – that makes Jack Daniel's a Tennessee Whiskey.

&gt; Based on concrete evidence, Election Justice USA surmises that, unlike Alba’s case, the majority of the registration tampering could only have been carried out by computer hackers: in many cases, the changes to voter registrations are provably back-dated in official electronic records. Other forms of direct voter suppression, however, were carried out by partisan elections officials in states like New York and California. In Brooklyn alone, 121,000 voters were wrongly or even illegally purged from voter rolls leading up to New York's vote. The Brooklyn voter purge disproportionately affected Hispanic voters.

And it's not always a bad thing...It is simply how conversation works now... She'll be on a mini-rant and I'll interject a quick tidbit of relative commentary, she does the same to me.

There are times when the interruptions get too frequent, and it really changes the way we communicate, usually for an hour or two... Instead of an organic, flowing conversation, it'll be one person ""lecturing"" for a period of time, awkward pause, rebuttal ""lecture"".

The longer any speaker is allowed to talk, the less it is still a ""conversation"", and skews towards ""lecture"".

I think a lot of people interrupt because they think they're being lectured, when in actuality, their attention span is too short to engage in a conversation in which they don't speak every 14 seconds.

1366,"""My name is William Thompson. I am a Senior Scientist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where I have worked since 1998.

I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics. The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased risk for autism. Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected, and I believe that the final study protocol was not followed.

I want to be absolutely clear that I believe vaccines have saved and continue to save countless lives. I would never suggest that any parent avoid vaccinating children of any race. Vaccines prevent serious diseases, and the risks associated with their administration are vastly outweighed by their individual and societal benefits.

My concern has been the decision to omit relevant findings in a particular study for a particular sub­ group for a particular vaccine. There have always been recognized risks for vaccination and I believe it is the responsibility of the CDC to properly convey the risks associated with receipt of those vaccines.

I have had many discussions with Dr. Brian Hooker over the last 10 months regarding studies the CDC has carried out regarding vaccines and neurodevelopmental outcomes including autism spectrum disorders. I share his belief that CDC decision-making and analyses should be transparent. I was not, however, aware that he was recording any of our conversations, nor was I given any choice regarding whether my name would be made public or my voice would be put on the Internet.

I am grateful for the many supportive e-mails that I have received over the last several days.

I will not be answering further questions at this time. I am providing information to Congressman William Posey, and of course will continue to cooperate with Congress. I have also offered to assist with reanalysis of the study data or development of further studies. For the time being, however, I am focused on my job and my family.

Reasonable scientists can and do differ in their interpretation of information. I will do everything I can to assist any unbiased and objective scientists inside or outside the CDC to analyze data collected by the CDC or other public organizations for the purpose of understanding whether vaccines are associated with an increased risk of autism. There are still more questions than answers, and I appreciate that so many families are looking for answers from the scientific community.

My colleagues and supervisors at the CDC have been entirely professional since this matter became public. In fact, I received a performance-based award after this story came out. I have experienced no pressure or retaliation and certainly was not escorted from the building, as some have stated.""

&gt; A related misconception is that flammable liquids alone are sufficient to destroy a body.

""That's enough to cause localised burns, but not enough that the skin will split and the body fat gets involved."" The body needs to be exposed to fire for about 5 minutes for that to happen

-------

&gt; Wiesel substantially rewrote the work between editions — suggesting that the strident and vengeful tone of the Yiddish original was converted into a continental, angst-ridden existentialism more fitting to Wiesel’s emerging role as an ambassador of culture and conscience. 

-------

&gt; He cited Wiesel as declaring to the New York Times that Night “is not a novel at all. All the people I describe were with me there. I object angrily if someone mentions it as a novel.” And yet, Silow Carroll went on, “in the past, Wiesel hasn’t helped matters in this regard. In 1972, Hill &amp; Wang packaged Night with two other books, Dawn and Day (previously titled The Accident), which Wiesel clearly identified as novels

-------

&gt; 
Then, once he had the prize he so fiercely pursued, Wiesel gradually, but consistently ­ so Pfefferkorn stresses ­ “alienated himself from the survivors”.

I disagree. Those are simply tools, or part of a tool, used to fish.  You don't have to eat or kill the fish.

&gt; Perhaps he is a Pokemon in this analogy.

First off, you're interpreting everything beneficially towards women.  A man catches a woman? Predator. A woman catches a man? Benevolent trainer/owner... But let's explore this Pokemon analogy...

The woman hunts, and then traps the man... She then keeps him in an inescapable prison, only releasing him to fight other men for her benefit. Not ideal.

&gt; But why don't you ask the fish?

At this point we'd moved on to baseball, but I'll use both. The fish doesn't want caught, and the batter doesn't want to strike out.

Both analogies misrepresent the relationship between men and women, as yes, women want to ""be caught"" or ""strike out"", that is, be with the/a man, and real life isn't the ""one party satisfied, the other dissappointed"" that is represented in these metaphors.

Kini's designs are usually more full coverage than other designers, and this is an aspect I believe lesbians prefer more than heterosexual women.  They probably don't liked to be looked at by men, so they cover up more.

Kini's designs also skew older, and I think more older women are comforable admitting they are lesbians to others/themselves, so they would be more of his clientele vs Siriano who designs very Junior clothing.

Kini also rarely uses bright color is his design, and I associate more demure colors with a lesbian's wardrobe.

She knows she has to stop this somehow. Communication doesn't seem strong, so her unconscious mind has taken over in an attempt to fix the problem. Now he knows about the dream, her dream actions, and waking actions. This will most likely delay or completely stop their advancement into an open relationship.

2196,"Yes, I have had that exact thought many times. Immediately followed by the thought ""Why does wearing nice clothes (btw nice clothes and sexual clothes can be different) make someone feel good?""  There can be a few explanations... High quality textiles that fit your body and are in fashion are an affirmation of security... You have to money to buy these clothes, store them, keep them clean, and have enough clothes that you have choices every morning on what you will wear... This is a stark contrast to the homeless person who wakes up in their only set of clothes, dirty, and out of fashion.

So, first explanation is ""nice clothes"" are an indication to the self of economic prosperity.  But like I parenthesized, nice clothes are not sexual clothes. A full coverage cashmere sweater is nice, but not sexually revealing in anyway.

So the next motivation we have to look at is: why wear sexually revealing clothes? We can focus on the self again, and see that a woman might wear a top that reveals considerable cleavage to affirm her physical attributes... She is young and her body is beautiful, and she likes to remind herself of this by showcasing her best features... Maybe a skirt that shows her gorgeous legs, or jean shorts that reveal how magnificent her ass is, but, sexual worth ~~is~~ is not determined by the self in the same way that ecomonic stability is... A person can feel good about economic stability without anyone else to accept or deny it, it just is... Sexual worth, on the other hand, requires validation by another party...""Is this top too revealing? Does my ass look good in this? Am I showing too much leg?""  So one is for yourself, and the other is for not yourself.

I feel like I've explained the difference enough/rambled long enough... If you have any questions/rebuttals I'd be happy to explain/respond/defend my position.

2250,"&gt; Calling something ""retarded"" is absolutely a reinforcement of treating people with disabilities as less than.

They are. Less than. Not that a person with Downs can't learn most/all the things an intelligent healthy person can, but they are less able. Or disabled.

Calling something retarded may draw attention to a retarded person that the speaker holds disdain, but not his animosity.  Disdain is a dislike or lack of respect... Animosity is dislike or hatred.  I don't hate retarded people, but I would value their literary interpretation of ""Infinite Jest"" less, and I would be insulted to have to be in the same class as them.  They would rightfully then hold disdain, perhaps animosity towards me for my biased beliefs.  They could prove me wrong. I am not such a monster that I would dismiss them out-of-hand, and, if they did, I would be forced to reevaluate my biases.

2251,"Well, I explained my justification for the use of words, and I heard you out when you explained why you thought it was inappropriate.

You seem to think your word (lame) is ok to use because you don't have a specific memory or story of it being used in a hateful way.

Other people's words (specifically faggot), you are extremely defensive about because you have a memory/story.

Any word used with enough vitriol becomes a bad word... What matters is context and tone.  Of course it is wrong to call someone a faggot as you're raping them, but that doesn't mean that the word is off-limits forever. Should we exercise more judgement when using the word? Sure. But not off limits.

Retarded is becoming ""The R-word"", which I find retarded, by which I mean ""slow or limited in intellectual or emotional developnent or academic process""... When Joe Flacco said an outdoor Superbowl in New York was retarded he was correct... But the PC police made him apologize.

Retarded is easier for me to defend than faggot, but as you pointed out, looking at the roots of the word, ""faggot"" was first used as a near synonym to ""contemptuous"", was turned into a slur against homosexual men, but now has reverted back to contemptuous.

You steal. You do drugs to ""prove to your perfectionist self you can get addicted.

You're spiraling... Hard... On purpose

You're emotionally weak through the whole story, and X knows this, and seems to be manipulating you for sex.

Stay away from him, stay away from drugs, get a new hobby, and get some new friends.

When you're having a panic attack ask yourself,""Did anyone die? Did anything burn down?""  If the answer is no; then calm down.

You really need to work on yourself right now and X and A and FG1 do not seem beneficial towards that goal.

I think our depth is as good or better than anyone but Spurs or Dubs.  Kirk is a great backup PG with balls of steel and plenty of experience. AB is a great offensive spark although a defensive liability. Assuming Dunleavy is healthy for playoffs Dougie and Snell are fantastic off/def subs who can go give 5 breakneck minutes.  Niko is a game changing 3/4 when he has his head in the game, and I think Portis will suprise us all come playoffs. Stacey says it all the time: guy plays with no fear.  Our only weakness is no real backup to Pau, Jo's injury hurts us a lot more than people realize, but with the small ball trend we can usually get away with Taj at the 5.

Our team is built for the postseason (instead of the reg season) because we rely heavily on a 35 year old post player... It doesn't make sense for us to grind him into the ground fighting for the 1 seed if he'll be useless by the time games matter.

We have a lot of depth (especially if we have healthy Mike Jr.), which means we can play lineups based on matchups instead of having one ""maximized"" lineup we rely on.  We can play big or small.

&gt; Detoxification or detoxication (detox for short)[1] is the physiological or medicinal removal of toxic substances from a living organism, including the human body, which is mainly carried out by the liver. Additionally, it can refer to the period of withdrawal during which an organism returns to homeostasis after long-term use of an addictive substance.[2][3] In medicine, detoxification can be achieved by decontamination of poison ingestion and the use of antidotes as well as techniques such as dialysis and (in a limited number of cases) chelation therapy.[4]

Evans may be shooting 40% from three this year, but on only 29 attempts, and I haven't watched enough of the games to, but I assume he's wide open because the scouting report says he can't shoot.

If Tyreke continues this percentage and defenders have to start honoring his shot: great. But I don't think that's what will happen... I think his numbers will regress back towards his career average, or he'll stop shooting them.

3434,"""The first clear use of the term Palestine to refer to the entire area between Phoenicia and Egypt was in 5th century BC Ancient Greece,[7][8] when Herodotus wrote of a 'district of Syria, called Palaistinê"" in The Histories, which included the Judean mountains and the Jordan Rift Valley.[9][ii] Approximately a century later, Aristotle used a similar definition for the region in Meteorology, in which he included the Dead Sea.[11] Later Greek writers such as Polemon and Pausanias also used the term to refer to the same region, which was followed by Roman writers such as Ovid, Tibullus, Pomponius Mela, Pliny the Elder, Dio Chrysostom, Statius, Plutarch as well as Roman Judean writers Philo of Alexandria and Josephus.[12]""

Do other animals not have genetic defects?

1:50 primates have 48 chromosones, homo sapiens 46. Is there no way to explain this loss?  Ok its a fusion, not sure of difficulty

Ive watched lots of Ancient Aliens, and have been a skeptic for a long time.... But.... This video has convinced me of:

E2: ""It is, however, not too difficult for dishonest doctors and health officials to provide plausible “explanations” as to what may have caused these cancers. They can just claim it was due to “asbestos”, “toxic fumes”, “toxic dust particles”, etc. However, when it comes to bone marrow damage, these deceivers are caught right in their tracks because bone marrow damage can only be caused by ionizing radiation.

Bone marrow cancer is smoking gun for Nuclear detonation? As well as slipped ""ground zero"", which I did not know means the site of a nuclear detonation.

Why didn't I know that? I'm smart enough and ask questions and seek my own knowledge. How did that slip past?

E3: ""During my military service in the abovementioned organization at the end of the ‘80s, it came to my knowledge that there was a so-called “emergency nuclear demolition schema” built into the World Trade Center Twin Towers in New York. The actual nuclear demolition schema was based on huge thermo-nuclear charges (about 150 kilotons in TNT yield) which were positioned about 50 meters below the lowest underground foundations of each of the Towers. It was strange to me by then and, to be honest; it was hard to believe that US authorities would be crazy enough to demolish buildings in the middle of a populated city using underground nuclear explosions.""

Wow. Never heard this either. Can this be verified by blueprints or anything like that?

E4: ""So, despite this common misconception, it is not possible to demolish a steel-frame building using any conventional controlled demolition (implosion) schema.""

This hurts the standard demolition argument

3884,"&gt; do you think it's a good idea to charge someone more for car insurance based purely on their gender?

Honestly I do.

Teenage males are way more into driving fast, car culture, drinking and driving, racing, making bad decisions, more prone to anger/agression, etc

I'm not saying teenage girls are good drivers, I fucking hate them

But from an insurance company's perspective, it is riskier and costlier to insure men under 24 or 25, and because of this the entire gender (specifically that age group) pay higher insurance rates.

If I owned/worked at an insurance company, this is a policy I would uphold, and have no qualms about doing so

What I don't want you to think is that someone who makes/uses generalizations is ignorant or bigoted; it's simply a shortcut

Once a young male driver goes a certain amount of time without a moving violation/traffic citation and no insurance claims for the car, his premium will go down because he, AS AN INDIVIDUAL, disproved the generalization

3996,"If there existed a similar culture to ours with a reduced (very heavily, perhaps removed) focus on sexuality and gender, I believe gender identity would still arise from the physical observations of genitalia and the size dimorphism present in humans.

Focusing on these two physical traits, since emotional/cultural/religious bias and characteristics don't exist in this parallel universe, I believe there would still be a gender gray area; people with multiple or neither genitalia, people who defy the size dimorphism and who have normal genitalia for their sex, but because of pubic hair or other elements, could not be distinguished as ""male"" or ""female"" right away.

I think this gender gray area would be much smaller based on physical traits alone, and that the underlying issue within the Trans movement is either a mental issue, an emotional issue, or a combination of both.

I assume SRS means ""sexual reconstructive surgery"", and I would question the use of this as a physical cure for a mental issue.

Hibbert is good at what he does, and at his size one of the best, but without the prevalence of dominant big men that ruled Mutumbo's era, his skill set isn't as valuable or in such demand as it was back then.

4084,"Thank you for the well thought out response, and new information

I don't have a strong science background, so everything know is either based on my own layman observations or information I've seen somewhere, which you pointed out, usually has an agenda.

To answer your question, ""what do I consider a race?"" I'd have to say what I can easily observe.

The NFL and NBA have an insanely high proportion of Black players.  Is this because they work harder than Whites, Hispanics, or Asians?

Or do their bodies have characteristics that gives them a higher chance to succeed in these physical contests?

Skin color is a characteristic that most people use to determine race, as well as eye shape, and hair type.

All of these characteristics can be manipulated (by genetic mutations or personal modifications), but they are our main indicators.

The other indicators you mentioned (lactase persistence and sickle cell) added to the ones I've mentioned would probably give you a very high success rate at guessing race.

With more information it seems like it would become easier and easier to make distinctions.

The makeup of our DNA, how much Neanderthal/cro-magnon/homo habilis or whatever, can be determined (I think, I don't know)
