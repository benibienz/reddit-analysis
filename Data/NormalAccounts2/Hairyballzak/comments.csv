124,"Video description for everyone to read in the meantime:

Part III of the undercover Project Veritas Action investigation dives further into the back room dealings of Democratic politics. It exposes prohibited communications between Hillary Clinton’s campaign, the DNC and the non-profit organization Americans United for Change. And, it’s all disguised as a duck. In this video, several Project Veritas Action undercover journalists catch Democracy Partners founder directly implicating Hillary Clinton in FEC violations. “In the end, it was the candidate, Hillary Clinton, the future president of the United States, who wanted ducks on the ground,” says Creamer in one of several exchanges. “So, by God, we would get ducks on the ground.” It is made clear that high-level DNC operative Creamer realized that this direct coordination between Democracy Partners and the campaign would be damning when he said: “Don’t repeat that to anybody.” The first video explained the dark secrets and the hidden connections and organizations the Clinton campaign uses to incite violence at Trump rallies. The second video exposed a diabolical step-by-step voter fraud strategy discussed by top Democratic operatives and showed one key operative admitting that the Democrats have been rigging elections for fifty years. This latest video takes this investigation even further.

287,"In cryptography, a commitment scheme allows one to commit to a chosen value (or chosen statement) while keeping it hidden to others, with the ability to reveal the committed value later.

A way to visualize a commitment scheme is to think of a sender as putting a message in a locked box, and giving the box to a receiver. The message in the box is hidden from the receiver, who cannot open the lock themselves. Since the receiver has the box, the message inside cannot be changed—merely revealed if the sender chooses to give them the key at some later time.

Just because a model uses math doesn't mean it has a lot of merit. Models all operate based on some underlying assumptions and these assumptions will always contain bias or simplifications that affect how they work. 

There is a famous quote any good statistics 101 course will begin with: ""all models are wrong, but some are useful"". 

I spoke with a mathematician and he says he has been able to tweak data and his models to fit whatever narrative he's trying to get across in a paper he's writing (this was while he was still in school). You can decide to remove ""outliers"", you can tweak parameters, you can partition the data set so that your end result says exactly what you wanted to, all using sound mathematical reasoning.

705,"That wasn't my education for a masters. I never learned to nor do I hate white males, of males, or white people at all. 
I never learned to hate Christians or kiss Muslims ass nor do I hate Christians and kiss ass to Muslims. 

I view Muhammad in the same respect as Jesus, a prophet of God.  
And if you look at Jesus, he did quite a few things as well:
- Abandon your home in the name of Jesus: Matthew 19:29, Mark 10:29-30, Luke 18:29-30
- Discouraging marriage: Luke 20:35
- Cut off your dick and balls: Matthew 19:12
- Implying that all Jews were going to Hell: Matthew 8:12
- Creating cult following with everyone else as enemies: Matthew 12:30 and Luke 11:230
- Threatens to kill Children: Revelation 2:16

And yet still, Jesus and Muhammad are prophets of God. 

So let's go down your list of things you say further down the line:
Agreed, US is not compatible with Islamic laws such as Sharia or culture. 
Agreed that 99% athiests and 1% Muslims = freedom of speech
Agreed that 99% muslims and 1% athiests = no freedom of speech, but not necessarily Sharia law because Muslim countries like Turkey and Bangladesh do not have Sharia, but I see your point. 
I disagree that we are moving towards Sharia because we are at a time when Trump can stop immigration from those Muslim countries where people want to have Sharia. 
I DO NOT WANT SHARIA LAW IN AMERICA. I LOVE MY FREEDOM
I DO NOT support child rape
Agreed that we're at a crossroads and that Hillary would bring about Sharia law in to America and agreed that we need to elect Trump. 
I disagree that we need to kick Muslim ass (unless it's of Daesh or migrants/immigrants/refugees who want to impose Sharia. 
Again, I DO NOT SUPPORT CHILD RAPE or rape of any kind for that matter. 

Modern education has taught me to look at things in more than just black and white and to understand that there are many dynamics of forming an argument instead of simply relying on a single thing such as a child rapist. Modern education has also taught me that although you have your views about Muslims, that it doesn't reflect the views of all Trump supports, the same way that your views about Muslims in America is not reflective of all Muslims in America.

Some will say that because America was pretty much founded on a fuck England platform, that Trump inviting Farage to speak is anti-American, but I think this is a very very tiny amount of people. The conservatives obviously see this as a huge morale boost for momentum, though it might be too early to make an effect in November. Hopefully, Farage can speak at more Trump Rallies and speak to vote for him more going forward. As for Liberals, I would suspect they are seeing this as foreign leaders meddling in American politics again (so negative) and mention how Farage left once the party accomplished its mission to vote for Brexit.
