That's the eye cup. If you remove that from the camera you can then cover the viewfinder with the cap, which is a rubber piece that fits where the eye cup was. It might be on your strap, if you got one with the camera. Don't worry too much about that, just cover the viewfinder.

Live view shows you what the sensor sees. The mirror is flipped up, the viewfinder goes dark and you see pretty much what the photo will look like on the screen. Perfect for manual focus.

151,"There are some pretty nice shots there. I especially like the last one of the moon.

You have some star trials where your shutter was open for too long. You should keep your shutter speed faster than about 500/effective focal length (500/18*1.6=17 seconds). Of course, if your aperture doesn't go very wide that'll be hard.

A couple of them look a little shaken up. I'd wager you weren't using the tripod. Are you using mirror lockup? You should enable mirro lockup and use a 10 second timer. When you press the shutter release, the mirror flips up and 10 seconds later, the shutter opens. That way you're not touching the camera and the mirror isn't shaking it.

There's one with quite a bit of detail, mixed in with a bit of noise. If you use Long Exposure Noise Reduction, your camera will take a second shot, with the same settings, but with the shutter closed to capture a dark frame. This frame shows only constant noise and is then subtracted from your actual shot. To keep your shoot faster, you can also shoot a manual dark frame and subtract it in post.

For this type of work, you'll want to use manual focus in live view. Don't forget to cap your viewfinder so light doesn't spill in through there. In live view you can press the magnifying button the zoom in on your subject, which would be the brightest star, and then focus manually. No eye strain or lack of precision to worry about. If you can't do that with your camera, I'd say that's a serious bottleneck. Other wise, if you're using a lens with a focus distance windows, just focus at infinity.

The T6i is actually borrows a lot from the 70D as far as the sensor and auto focus system go. It's a really nice camera. The extra pixels (24.2M - more than twice what you have now) would come in handy for cropping and getting better details.

I've heard good things about Canon's macro lenses, in general. I know much less about macro than I do about other things, but, as far as I do know, you really can't go wrong with them. The 60 mm will also be a nice portrait lens. The aperture is also nice for astro, even if the focal length isn't. Maybe you can get some interesting compositions.

A lot of manufacturers make lenses for Canon and Nikon. They have the right mount and software to work with the cameras. Sigma barely makes cameras at all. Check this out: https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/882235-REG/Tokina_atx116prodxc_ii_AT_X_116_PRO_DX_II.html.

154,"What I know about astrophotography (researching, because I'd like to get into it myself) is that you'll want a wide field of view and a lot of light sensitivity. With your lenses, you'd be using 18 mm at f/3.5. that's a fairly wide field of view, but not that big of an aperture.

I'm in the same boat on that end, so I'm gonna see what I can do. I'll likely find myself stacking multiple shots to get more light.

I've also seen some cool shots of distant mountains through telephoto lenses. Of course, at the long end of yours, you'll be at f/5.6. 

My advice is try working with what you have and try different things. If you take a whole night and can't get shots of the stars you're happy with, at least get a few of the moon so you don't go back home empty handed.

Once you find yourself limited by your gear, look into a fast wide lens.

______

As for your body, once again, switch if it's limiting you.

The T6i is a big upgrade. Much nearer, of course, much higher resolution and quality sensor, HD video, much better autofocus, higher burst rate, Wi-Fi for remote shooting and file transfer, rotating screen...

It's a better camera, hands down. It's up to you if you need it. Do you find you need more detail in your pictures? Is it slow or awkward to focus? Do you want to get into video?

Most folks will tell you your money will go a longer way if you use it lenses, rather than on a body. Something like a Sigma 17-50 2.8 could be right to your alley, fit example. Or a wide Tokina for astrophotography. Or an L series 300 mm for sports and wildlife.

613,"Zoom is how much bigger the maximum focal length is compared to the minimum. Your current lens has  about 3x zoom and the bigger one has about 4x zoom. Doesn't sound like much right?

What you have to do is compare focal lengths to a common point that you'll assume is close to normal human vision. On your kind of sensor that would be about 35 mm. So 55 mm is just under twice that and 300 is about 10 times. That sounds more interesting right?

So, comparing to a point and shoot, you can currently zoom in about 2x closer *than normal vision* and the 70-300 will zoom about 10x closer *than normal vision*.

As far as quality of the lens, the first thing to consider is the aperture that shrinks as you zoom. Pictures will get darker and darker. You'll have to lower your shutter speed, but that will cause motion blur, so you'll increase your ISO, which will cause noise.

If you're taking pictures for National Geographic you won't want to use anything worse than a 70-300 f/2.8. If you're taking holiday pictures, you might be OK with some extra ISO noise or some forced ""action shots.""",2016-09-02 08:00:46+00:00,d76ip01,2.0,t1_d76i828,1601.0,photography

I set up my camera on manual and overexposed the first shot as far as I dare, to preserve the highlights.  I captured one shot every two minutes for an hour or so. As time passed, the shots got progressively underexposed until there was very little detail and it was all a dark mess.

Should I overexpose the first shot further? Should I change exposure settings throughout the shoot? What I read about time-lapses (and I think makes sense) is that you should keep constant exposure, white balance, focus and, usually, composition.

Reddit uses markdown notation which is, at times, very eccentric. It replaces any number followed by a period, at the start of a paragraph, with a number in a list, starting at 1. That's why the comment starts with ""1."" instead of the intended ""1974."" and why my first edit mentions markdown.

1411,"The leftist government conducted intense negotiations with the European authorities, in an attempt to restructure the national debt and reduce austerity measures, but were unsuccessful. A new agreement was proposed that worsened austerity.

The government held a referendum on whether to accept this new agreement or not, risking the possibility of being kicked out of the eurozone. The popular vote was to ~~accept~~ reject the new agreement.

The leftmost sectors of the government left and it is now dependent on the support of a right-wing party.

They have implemented new unpopular austerity measures and are faced with protests and demonstrations. I'm not sure how well these new measures are working, but at least EU money seems to be following.

At the same time, most of the refugees coming to Europe are arriving in Greece and Italy, so they have a big card to play ""we need your money to keep the refugees under check and they'll all flow uncontrollably if you don't help finance the necessary infrastructure."" The rest of Europe is probably more worried about this than Greece's economic situation.

The reason for that boils down to the formulas having very different meanings. /u/ViskerRatio's explanation is very good.

When you add resistance (series) you make it harder for current to flow. When you add conductance (parallel) you make it easier for current to flow. That's what each formula does.

Of course in the end you have R_parallel = 1 / ( 1/R_1 + 1/R_2 + + ... + 1/R_n), where you get a resistance as your final result.",2016-03-11 12:39:30+00:00,d0vw35m,3.0,t1_d0vvhxb,1803.0,explainlikeimfive

If your friends are walking behind you they'll also take very long, because they have to wait for you. If there are other paths, parallel to yours, they can go faster because they don't have to wait for you.

Conductance measures how easy it is to walk through a path. If there are several parallel passes it's easier for the whole group in the end.

TL;DR:

&gt; Dragon Ball (ドラゴンボール Doragon Bōru) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Akira Toriyama. With the ending of Dragon Ball, Toei Animation quickly released a second anime television series, Dragon Ball Z. In the 28th episode titled “Goku’s Arrival,” the main protagonist character Goku returns to the Earth after intense training in the Other World to square off against Saiyan warriors Vegeta and Nappa, who had killed his friend Piccolo right before his arrival. As Goku powers up in rage, Vegeta senses an explosive increase in his power level through his scouter and yells: “It’s over nine thousand!”

Ten Thousand - xkcd comic transcript:

&gt; I try not to make fun of people for admitting they don't know things.

&gt; Because for each thing ""everyone"" knows by the time they're adults"", every day there are, on average, 10,000 people in the US hearing about it for the first time.

&gt; Fraction who have heard of it at birth = 0%

&gt; Fraction who have heard of it by 30 ≈ 100%

&gt; US birth rate ≈ 4,000,000/year

&gt; Number hearing about it for the first time ≈ 10,000/day

&gt; If I make fun of people, I train them not to tell me when they have those moments. And I miss out on the fun.

&gt; Megan: ""Diet Coke and Mentos thing""? What's that?

http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2012/12/16/gun_control_after_connecticut_shooting_could_australia_s_laws_provide_a.html

&gt; homicides by firearm plunged 59 percent between 1995 and 2006, with no corresponding increase in non-firearm-related homicides. The drop in suicides by gun was even steeper: 65 percent.

&gt; In the decade before the Port Arthur massacre, there had been 11 mass shootings in the country. There hasn’t been a single one in Australia since.

Let's face it: Killing people and killing yourself is *hard*, without guns. Punching people to death takes time and prowess. Shooting people takes a certain level of skill, but isn't all that hard. We humans are very lazy and need to very highly motivated to do anything that takes hard work.

As I said, I'm not suggesting that all the firearms be taken from American civilians. You just can't do that. What I'm saying is there are solutions out there that have to be considered. Maybe it's stricter regulations, maybe it's improving mental healthcare and education, but there's no justifiable reason for things to stay the same.

T think your next step might be talking to a therapist or counselor. You shouldn't be taking medication for something you don't have, but since you're already (I assume) seeing a psychologist or psychiatrist, you can start by talking to them.

3894,"Their first album is pretty heavy, but barely any one knows that one.

Ignition has LAPD, which I'd wager has to do with the LA riots, having been released in '92, which is kinda intense. It also includes Dirty Magic, which is a lot slower and calmer.

Smash (the best selling independent album ever) has Genocide, but also What Happened To You?, a surprisingly up-beat song about a friend who's gone too far with his drugs.

I'd say their work is fairly diverse, including quick, intense punk songs, but also fun, laid-back stuff. They're pretty cool, but I really wouldn't call them metal.

Anyway, go out and listen to Smash.
