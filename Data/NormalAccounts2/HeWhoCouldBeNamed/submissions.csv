Today, I got a call from the consulting firm saying that they have a new opportunity and that they have my contact details, but not my CV. The guy asked if I remembered giving them my info at an event. Could I please send them my CV? He didn't even ask if I was still interested.

Still, I hope you enjoy my story.

Christmas is fast approaching, the weather isn't getting any nicer and my cousin decides this is the right time to move. Almost everything is already set up, except for the kitchen appliances and the gas for heating and cooking - and 90% of the furniture.

Last Friday, I arrive at this bare-bones operation to install some ceiling lights and the such. The first thing I need is internet access on my phone to look up some wiring diagrams, so I set up the network through WPS.

Hours later, my cousin wants to show me this adorable cat video, so we move to the study, already set up with her laptop hooked up to an external monitor and keyboard and mouse. The only problem is the internet isn't working.

&gt; Cousin: They installed it today and it was working just fine!

So I start troubleshooting:

1. The computer can see other networks;

2. Both my phone and hers can connect to her network.

So... it's not the laptop and it's not the network either?

&gt; Me: Did it work, *in this room*?

&gt; Cousin: It did, just fine...

So is this one of those bizarre Windows 10 update bugs I keep hearing about? I open up my laptop and it connects just fine - what gives? I start looking up WiFi bugs related to this laptop model and Windows 10 - nothing.

By this point I've turned everything off and on again a few times. I decide to pick up her computer and carry it the router - they haven't known each other for very long, so this might help, right? It does help! The connection is perfect.

I take it back to the study and plug everything back in put in down on the desk and close the lid - let's look at cute kitties! Or not, because the video stopped loading - it's not connected anymore.

At this point I'm a bit annoyed. Let's just unplug all the peripherals and see what happens - I unplug the monitor, open the lid, so I can see the screen, unplug the keyboard and *the video is playing? Why? Wait...*  I plug in the screen and the keyboard and it's still playing. I close the lid and... no internet.

I check my phone and notice the signal isn't very strong. It was just strong enough for the laptop to pick it up, but by closing the lid, my cousin was lowering the antena. The solution? Settings -&gt; Display -&gt; Expand these displays.

TL;DR: Layer 1 is bigger than it seems, kitties stepped on the invisible wire and more screens = more internet.",talesfromtechsupport,The cute kitties stepped on the invisible wire,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3xhyfc/the_cute_kitties_stepped_on_the_invisible_wire/
