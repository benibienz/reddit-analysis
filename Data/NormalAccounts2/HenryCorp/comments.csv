149,"Subject Line: Please pardon Edward Snowden

Dear President Obama,

I am writing to ask you to use your presidential authority to pardon Edward Snowden, an American whistleblower who acted on the conviction that the public had a right and need to know about a global mass surveillance system that exceeded the limits of the Constitution.

Snowden’s actions, and the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting that followed, set in motion the most important debate about government surveillance in decades, and brought about reforms that continue to benefit our security and democracy.

Last year, Congress reined in the government’s surveillance authority for the first time in nearly four decades, after a federal appeals court struck down as illegal the NSA’s mass call-tracking program. A blue-ribbon commission you convened recommended 46 sweeping changes to our surveillance and security practices. And technology companies around the world have been newly invigorated to protect their customers and strengthen our communications infrastructure.

None of these reforms would have occurred without Snowden’s actions. Former Attorney General Eric Holder believes that Snowden “performed a public service by raising the debate that we engaged in and by the changes that we made.” You have also expressed confidence that the debate about surveillance and democracy he helped launch “will make us stronger.”

Snowden should not be threatened with serious felony convictions and prolonged confinement under World War One-era laws that treat him like a spy who sold secrets for profit.

Winston Churchill once wrote, “Men occasionally stumble over the truth, but most of them pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing ever happened.” Not so with Edward Snowden.

It is clear that America’s democracy has benefited from Snowden’s actions, and I am confident he will be remembered as a whistleblower and patriot. I urge you to use the powers granted to you under Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution to pardon Edward Snowden.

Sincerely,

A Concerned Citizen

586,"The TLDR version is:  be prepared to occupy your caucus.  Be there early and be ready to stay all night if needed.  The mindset is more important than the likelihood that it will happen. Also, from a Minnesotan, where water is plenty and the weather is chilly with virtually no need for bringing in water,  I've never been to a caucus where I've needed or wanted water.

My corrected list, mainly for Minnesota but applicable to most caucuses:

1. Do not just show, vote, and leave. **Don't leave until the vote is announced and agreed upon.**  In addition, you can become a delegate.  The more Bernie delegates, the better.  Don't trust somebody else with following the delegate rules at the Senate District and State Conventions, which seems to be the priority 1 message of this thread.  Also, those ballots need to be counted and observed and then possibly redone or ties dealt with, which brings us to:

2. Contact your Senate District Contact or Precinct Chair in advance and offer to volunteer for setting up and registering voters.  The more people there are registering voters, the faster they get in and the less likely you are lose them to time constraints.

3.  Pre-caucus, don't say anything about who you support other than keeping Republicans out of office.  Don't give away anything about your support until you show up at the caucus with buttons, hats, or flyers for the caucus-goers.

4.  Caucuses are run by the people at the caucus, so if there's a problem the best time to take care of it is by getting other people involved and asking it be voted on and resolved in simple proposition and second format.  Typically, there's a co-chair, one man and one woman.  Pre-ballot counting, find someone who supports having 1 chair for each candidate to second you so it can be voted on and a biased chair can be effectively neutralized.  Don't expect biased chairs to announce themselves, just assume it and eliminate the problem.

5. Even if you don't get a response to your volunteer offering, show up early ready to help.  Showing up 5 hours early is not good.  Use that time to call or door-knock for Bernie and get there no more than an hour early unless specifically requested.

6.  Be ready to move and flyer/register at the same time.  Those long lines can also be dealt with by walking the lines.  There's no rule that says the registers have to stay seated.

7.  While you're registering, and you notice fellow supporters, offer them flyers to pass out.  More hands, less work, less wait.

8.  The rules are there are no rules for endorsing.  The caucus defines the rules for itself when it comes to the endorsement, so you can vote on no endorsement rather than using a coin toss, card picking, or other superficial way to force an endorsement.",2016-02-29 04:04:34+00:00,d0ho5cz,1.0,t3_484fil,35172.0,SandersForPresident

As for your unsourced NPR article on ""resources of about $26M"", that can easily mean they earn $1M, have $1M in savings, $1M in retirement, and are able to get bank loans to pay for the rest.
