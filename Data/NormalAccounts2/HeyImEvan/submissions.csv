They can add a new cinematic career mode that makes it less repetitive and reduces the ability for it to get boring, in which you can use the same pro online against others (much like NBA 2K's MyPark) where people can 1.choose to spend money on currency (fifa points) that can make your pros attributes better and also be used for ultimate team packs, or 2. grind in the player career and online mode to earn stat points and upgrade their player with those points. By suggesting this, I'm also implying that they should scrap ""accomplishments"" because lets face it, nobody enjoys them. I think if they did this ea could potentially profit off of it, and the players could enjoy this mode much more than they do now, which would make everyone happy.",FifaCareers,"How EA can make player career better, while making profit.",http://www.reddit.com/r/FifaCareers/comments/3feh2w/how_ea_can_make_player_career_better_while_making/
