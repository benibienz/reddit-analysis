4,"I used nitrous oxide as pain relief when I was in labor with my son! This was at York Hospital, ME. It just made me really, really dizzy and spacey, and only took the edge off of the contraction. I got it because I am allergic to lidocaine and couldn't have the epidural.",2015-11-09 04:04:30+00:00,cwtpksa,1,t3_3s2xmd,6892,BabyBumps

6,"What's worse is when you see the baby, the heartbeat, and you're holding your breath til they can do another U/S or hear the heartbeat. I did it with my firstborn as well -- I am terrified of a MMC. ",2015-10-23 12:53:57+00:00,cw9z7iu,1,t3_3pvxa4,12865,BabyBumps

9,"I'm more concerned about the preservatives in the flu shot, and the actual effectiveness of the vaccine, than actually getting the flu. I am 7+5 with baby #2. And absolutely no live shots or sprays. I haven't had the flu since I was last vaccinated in 2010, my sons never been sick (but he got my spring/summer time allergies of course) and is not vaccinated. That's just my feelings on the matter, but I appreciate and respect every parent doing what feels right to them! :)",2015-10-22 12:52:00+00:00,cw8rkgz,1,t3_3prg53,3749,BabyBumps
10,"For me, the best thing that's happened (so far) with my 1 year old son, is when he runs up and hugs me or gives me a kiss (more like he's mushing his open mouth on me but you know...). But lately he's been really great at listening to me when I tell him to stop doing something or to come here to mama, even when he's tired and grumpy, because ordinarily he is a tiny tyrannical dictator who thinks he will ALWAYS get his way. Probably won't last until the new baby's born or beyond that, but for now, it's just fucking awesome.",2015-10-21 21:52:09+00:00,cw84u1w,1,t3_3pmeup,35907,BabyBumps
11,"I took all these tests because with my first pregnancy I immediately knew I was pregnant. Like within a week or two after intercourse. 

I noticed I was 3 days late (totally normal for me to be early/late up to 5 days) and took a cheapie test I had in the back of my bathroom cabinet on a whim because I wanted to drink a whole bottle of wine to my face after dropping Terror Child off at his grandmas for the evening. Boom. 

POSITIVE.

So here I am, 7 tests later, due June 1st!",2015-10-12 01:28:38+00:00,cvwgbut,2,t1_cvvt2ec,39938,BabyBumps
