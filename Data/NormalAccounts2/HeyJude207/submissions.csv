I wanted something zippy and Irish (or British) to pair with my first son, Jude Oliver Doyle. Jude and Finn! 

Weeeeeeeellll I found out it's a girl and I am still stuck on the 'Fin' name. I really like Finley, but everybody is telling me it's a boys name. I'm shocked because it sounds very unisex to me! What do you all think?

I'm also having a hard time deciding on a middle name. My mother is pushing for me to pass on our middle name, Louise, since this is my last child, but I'm not quite sure.

First time using this sub because I knew from conception that I was naming my boy Jude. His full name is Jude Oliver Doyle (I am 2nd gen. Irish for reference and strongly prefer Irish names, but Jude has held a spot in my heart since childhood!)

I am due with #2 June 1st 2016. I find out in less than a month what I am having and am CLUELESS on names. I really love Finnegan Jack for a boy, Finn for short. So Finn &amp; Jude. I was thinking Saoirse Louise for a girl (Louise runs in the family as a middle name, I have to keep it), but it feels too drawn out to pair well with Jude. 

Bonus points if it is Scottish/Irish/British in origin!

My son will be 20 months when the new baby is here, I literally cannot have another cesarean. I will be doing this alone, very unexpectedly. I know it gets worse with labor, but I would be physically incapable of taking care of both children if I had another cesarean

I now have a beautiful 11 month old named Jude Oliver. He'll be turning 1 on October 16th. He was 13 days late and an emergency C section after 44 hours of unmedicated back labor due to his posterior positioning. 

So I just figured out a couple days ago my period is (dangerously) late. I still nurse part time and am on birth control so I thought nothing of it... Until the texture of avocado made me vomit. That's how I knew lol. My sons dad and I broke up about 4 months ago, after I ended a fling with a guy I was briefly seeing, we decided to make things work again by going to couples therapy and having a trial move in, aaaaand boom! I'm pregnant! Shit-- I MEAN... Yay?

5 weeks 2 days, I'm due June 1st 2016. My moms birthday!! We are freaking out because this is horrible timing for a pregnancy in our lives but we are excited. 

When I asked him what he thought, he shrugged, smiled and said ""well, everything happens for a reason... Including you getting pregnant on birth control while nursing Jude. Who knows, maybe this baby's supposed to happen... Maybe we'll finally get a girl. Life's insane. So let's do this shit."" Haha!!

So I have questions!! Any advice on what to expect with a 19-20 month old and a newborn? Is 2 under 2 as tricky as everyone makes it seem? What's the bond with your 2 kids under 2 like?? Anybody here have a VBAC with a story to tell? Any subreddits about VBACS or TOLAC? ",BabyBumps,I guess I'm back!,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/3n7742/i_guess_im_back/
