6,"I just watched the movie for the very first time. 

I went in with 0 expectations because of the mediocre reception it got. I also thought it wouldn't be that bad, people tend to overreact a lot. But man, this movie was such a dissapointment. This is the second DCEU film that put me to sleep. I'm not hating or trying to start a fight. I literally fell asleep again, just like during my first BvS viewing. 

I think my main problem with Suicide Squad is that I just didn't care about the characters. They were so poorly set-up and so poorly developed. I just didn't give a fuck about the story during the whole movie. I feel like so many of them were mishandeld. The movie was written badly. The whole flood of text on the screen in the beginning of the flashback opening of a half an hour also didn't help. You were getting flooded with information about the characters. Information that should've been shown instead, we get a wall of text because these characters and these DCEU movies aren't getting the propper set-up.

I also felt that the music was a bit too much. I've never seen a movie that uses so many songs after each other. It was a bit excessive and it felt really forced. Lot's about this movie felt forced imo. I feel like that's the type of guy David Ayer is. 

I was simply not enjoying myself and I fell asleep during the final half hour. I watched the final part today and I was amazed at lines from Diable calling the Squad his family and them suddenly bonded in the few hours they were walking in the city. It really felt forced how they suddenly had a bond. 

The animated Suicide Squad movie was honestly better. I wouldn't have mind it if they made a live action version out of that one. It wasn't my favorite animated DC movie, but it's still miles ahead this one.

So far I just like The Man of Steel movie in the DCEU. I didn't think it was amazing, but it had some great moments and those moments make that movie. BvS just felt like a mess. The editing was all over the place and there were some bad choices made storywise. And now with SS it just feels like they made lots of mistakes again. 

I love the DC universe but this is starting to feel really iffy. I'm not sure how Justice League is going to turn out. I'm worried about this movie universe. Maybe with Geoff Johns things will get better, but I guess I'll just have to wait and see. ",2016-11-20 13:33:51+00:00,da84r2u,1.0,t3_5d0lw3,465382.0,DC_Cinematic

10,"I don't get why so many people love the Gohan vs. Cell fight. It wasn't that good choreographed like many of the other fights. It wasn't as well animated as the other fights. It was just Gohan dominating Cell. It wasn't even a real fight. Gohan was just toying with him and after that there was a beam struggle, one of the best beam struggles in DB history. But it's not the best fight imo.

The Goku vs. Freeza fight is the most iconic one. It has so much moments. Goku first starting out with lots of confidence. His power boost after waking up in the healing chamber. Vegeta's tears, grave and Goku's respect for him. Vegeta's ruthlessness. The choreography of the fight. The way Freeza moved. So elegant and yet so intimidating. Goku going all out. He struggled like crazy. Goku realizing Freeza is a too strong of a foe. Goku shooting the water Kamehameha's. Goku drowning! Goku's vision. Goku's Kaio Ken! The spirit bomb! Freeza is alive! Shocking twist!! Krillins death!! Goku's rage!! SSJ!!! Goku torturing Freeza. The epic battle on a dying planet. Behind the scenes planning of a Kami and a Kai. The great wish and the great escape. Freeza is cut by his own attack.. Goku sparing Freeza. Freeza is a fool!! Goku counters!! PLANET GOES BOOM!!

The Atom is just changed into a poor mans Blue Beetle because Arrow couldn't use Blue Beetle. The suit looks like a toy. 

The Supergirl costume is decent, but it would've looked great without those leggings underneath the skirt. They totally added that to keep the actress warm during shooting.

Alchemy has equivalent exchange. Ichigo can't hold the or control the Hollow form for too long. 

And now Vegito has a time limit. That's fine with me. Much better than a OP super mega god that can easily defeat every single foe. They can't rely on fusion because how much more power they use the shorter they can use it. Now they just have to focus on becoming stronger individually.

Vegito having a timelimit actually makes sense. It was never really fully explained why they defused in Buu's body. A time limit is great because this means Vegito isn't OP anymore.

LoT is REALLY fun but also REALLY dumb at the same time. I've gotten used to this level of writing since the Smallville days. The superhero CW shows just don't make any sense most of the time.

Last season had Rip talking every plothole straight while introducing a new plothole while doing so. This show is crazy. Just like the examples you've just mentioned. One episode they say to each other they can't change stuff in the past because it would have crazy consequences and an episode later Ray flies through the chest of a guy in the wild west. Them being in a different timeline is change enough. Them talking to someone is change enough. Them freaking blowing through the white house windows and even participating in a white house tour is change enough. But they also even kill people everywhere. I really don't get how they just ignore that. 

Killing is so much debated on Arrow. Oliver has struggled with it every time and they just can't leave that plotpoint alone. 1 time he's okay with it, an other time he's not. Then he's got a reason why he can't kill and then he's got an other reason why he should.

I wouldn't have made it public knowledge that he was the dark archer in season 1. I also wouldn't made every one believe he died.
This is how I woukd have done it: Oliver stabs Merlyn fatally just like how it happened in the show. He leaves with Diggle and they think he's dead. They leave and a shot after that only shows a pool of blood. Merlyn has vanished. 

It's explained in season 2 that he has lazarus pit water on him. His ties to the league will be more explored through that water and the lazarus eater will be linked to the mirikuru drug. the mirikuru will be made through the lazarus water. The island will also have a lazarus pit.
The deathstroke storyline happens like it did and merlyn pops up again towards the end and it's revealed that he was in business with slade.
Merlyn returns to his company and oliver has no proof that he's the dark archer. He can't out him in jail or anything and he has sworn he won't kill anymore and merlyn is a formidable foe still.
Next season in season 3 its merlyn industries vs. Queen consolidated and dark archer vs. Green arrow vs. The league. Merlyn and oliver will be forced to team up. Oliver won't like it one bit and they turn against each other. This ra's is actually a great ra's and wont die. He instead kills merlyn after a great merlyn arc. He dies in Oliver's arms after a monologue about his wife and tommy. He wants to say something about tommy but he dies before letting it out. He wanted to say that tommy was still alive. This is the step uo for prometheus in season 4.  Ra's stays a factor. He will be more of a neutral evil. Oliver will even go to him for help. Like making a deal with the devil type thing.

164,"I couldn't stand the original Japanese version when I was a teenager. The funimation dub was everything to me. Years later I started to see scenes of the Japanese version on youtube. Moments like Trunks cutting Freeza in half and Gohan going SSJ2 were handled so much better. The music and the feeling of those scenes seemed different. Many scenes  also suddenly started to make scenes, like 18 actually being an artificial human instead of an andriod. I realized that the English version was heavily mistranslated. The Kai version of the show began and I fully watched that in Japanese. I suddenly started falling in love with the Japanese voice actors.

The Krillin voice, the Vegeta voice etc. were done so much better. I started to compare it with the English version and I noticed how much more emotion and how better acted the Japanese version was. Than the Z Kai dub happened. I was really glad with that one because it brought the show to an even higher level for the dub. The performances were so much better than the old funi dubs. The old funi dubs  started to sound amateurish, which isn't weird because for many VA's like Schemmel the funi dub was their first gig. 

Now I just enjoy them both. I'm not whiny about it. I learned to accept Goku's voice in Japanese. I get what they were  doing with it. I still don't fully love it but the cast around Goku is amazing. I do however really love the Goku VA work on Goku Black. She's really hitting it out of the park with that. 

Sabat tends to overact with his performances. Many of his voices sound forced to me now. When I was younger I loved them and I didn't notice how forced it was. His original Vegeta sound like a fake british accent. he was trying to emulate the elegant version of the ocean dub and he went with a terrible route with it. His piccolo sounded constipated. It wasn't as horrible as his Kuwabara though. That one is really forced and terribly growly. At least he has toned it down a bit for the most recent dubs. 

I'm not a person that worships one dub. All of them have their strenghts and weaknesses. ",2016-11-10 14:22:00+00:00,d9ubozi,1.0,t3_5c6s9l,22142.0,dbz

Finally catching up with Europe. Healthcare is a constitutional right. Democratic socialism made America great again and Sanders' approval rating is okay. The democrats also won the House and the Senate. So Sanders got lots of shit done. His own party had elements that were working against him but he preserved and came out on top. There was a scandal that was about Sanders allegedly groping a female aid, but it was quickly proven to be false. 
Sanders kept his word and did most things he promised. He has had fierce battles with big money, but they couldn't touch him that much because he wasn't backed by them. He has put in new environment laws, big oil can't stop him, he has reformed the financial system in regards to the banks and he has created a new social security system for those in need. Employment is skyrocketing. The one negative thing are the terrorist attacks on Star City during every may since he has been in office. He failed to protect that city. 

However!!!!!!!!! Jesse Quick got bored, went back in time and banged it. Barry was proud. It caused a Flash Point and Trump became president. 8 years later: Donald Luthor Trump shoots a nuke towards the moon. He believes that it's the only way to stop the coming threat of the Saiyans. 

Shocking turn of events: the destruction of the moon doesn't do much. But in the center of it there's something humanity wouldn't even throught possible. It's a spacecraft. The moon was formed over it. Trump knew this and it was his aim all this time. It seems that Trump is an alien and he simply just wants to return home. His whole rise as a billionaire and becoming president had this as his goal. The world falls in love with sad Trump and he gets a heroes goodbye.

HOWEVER. Trump wasn't actually Trump. He was a robot thinking he was Trump. His whole life was a lie and he can't handle it anymore. He tries to selfdestruct but Jesse turns back time again.

This time Harry becomes president and he puts a Big Belly Burger in the Black House (the earth 2 white house ofcourse). ",2016-11-09 19:30:58+00:00,d9t8r06,1.0,t3_5c0uqg,24630.0,FlashTV

If Felicity had died, which would've made sense. She had an arc building up to that death and it would've given Oliver a legit reason to go nuts. No, they saved her, put her in a wheelchair for no reason and built tons of melodrama around it AND killed Laurel for no reason at all. While also increasing Darhk's powers. Felicity should've died at the end of the midseason finale AFTER Darhk was defeated. Have the villain for season 4.5 be the one that orders her kill and link that villain to Darhk. Have it be someone mysterious that we don't know and reveal his ID towards the end of the season. Reveal that it's Ra's al Ghul and give him an incredible comeback where he makes it clear that you can't just easily kill him. This fixed the poor Ra's storyline from season 3 and it also ties into Malcolm being Ra's because the real Ra's will come for his head. He'll cut Merlyn's hand off and he puts him in a dungeon. Have him sit there until we need a Merlyn storyline in season 5 again. Have him pay a bit for his crimes. Jump into season 5. Enter: legion of doom. Have Ra's be a part of it and let Eobard be the one that talks Ra's into using Merlyn too because he needs him for certain contacts. Have them join forces.

240,"That's one of the weirdest parts of the show. Starr labs is still in ruins. Caitlin and Cisco somehow still work there. No idea how they sell their job to the outside world. Eobard Wells left Barry money because of plotreasons but they never really explained how Starr labs still is a thing.

I would've liked it if they got a new owner in season 2. That would've been a fun new thing to explore in the first episodes of season 2.

Have their new boss stopp all the operations with the flash. Have him be against him and all meta's. Have him donate money to the police and have him create tools for the police to stop meta's. Let something happen where Zoom battle's Flash and Flash saves him or the new owner sees how the flash sacrifices himself. Have the new owner start thinking differently about the flash from that moment on.

When the new owner comes in Cisco and Caitlin keep working for him. There are also other employees in the freaking building. They work with Flash in a different hide-out. Some old warehouse Starr Labs hasn't used for years and is off the grid. They discover something Eobard Wells hid there. A file that tracks meta's and during the first half of the season Barry uses this file to save them and/or fight them or he helps them. One of the meta's will turn out being Hunter Zolomon of earth 1. Through him the whole Zoom thing starts rolling. Wells from earth 2 shows up too. There is no ridiculous plot where the villain is someone the team knows already. Lets keep Eobard Wells unique and lets not have a formula each season with a villain that's a 'mystery'. When Zoom shows up they'll figure out quickly it's the hunter zolomon counterpart of their Hunter. The season goes on and Zoom from earth 2 corrupts Hunter from earth 1. He'll betray team flash by giving Zoom save passage to earth 1 because zoom promised earth 1 hunter to heal him. This is how barry found earth 1 hunter. He's a meta but his meta powers are unusable and they are killing him. Caitlin doesn't have a romance with him btw. Ronnie died and he was the love of her life. Lets not through her in a new relationship directly. 

The season progresses and the new star labs owner helps flash and he discovers the warehouse. Flash starts liking the guy and befriends him. He learns about Barry. He's apart of the team now and.... he dies. Zoom kills the new star labs boss. Starr labs goes out of bussines. Nobody wants that company anymore after all the drama. However... Oliver Queen buys the lab. He's currently having his best season ever on Arrow season 3. Fun and better written Felicity will oversee Star Labs in season 3 of Flash. It will be a recurring role, not a main role. She'll also have a recurring role on Arrow. Too much felicity on 1show isn't a good thing.

Dark Archer;

Reverse Flash;

Darhk;

Deathstroke;

Ra's al Ghul;

And I would've loved Captain Cold on this team if they kept him a straight up baddy. Or they could do a storyline where the viewers think he's an old version of Cold being a baddy again while in fact he's just playing them all. 

Ra's al Ghul provides an army and [putties] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_zXJ9BQZLU) for the heroes to kick and hit.

Darhk and Ra's have bad blood and that can cause tension within their group. 

I could totally see Merlyn and Eobard becoming buddies. Ra's is the silent one. Darhk is the annoying one and the joker of the group. Cold is the one that challenges everyone and comes with the greatest cheesy cold puns. Eobard is also the idea man. Ra's and Darhk provide for their resources. Merlyn provides the contacts and the entrances. Cold is their tactician but also their mole.

I feel that funi takes away from a lot of the subtle things. I think it's interesting that in the original version people have Ki that feel evil or good. Or a ki that gives a lot of presure or feels really powerful or calm. While in the english version characters just keep shouting that they never felt a powerlevel like this before.

The type of people that make whole calculations of powerlevels to figure out how strong characters are, are probably the funniest of the bunch.

370,"I actually like how Vegeta actually has had some character development and didn't stay a one-not evil guy. He was a one-note evil baddy when he was first introduced. Learned that there was more to him on Namek. We saw how far his pride stretched when he stayed on earth and fought the Andriod as a challenge to prove that he was better than Kakarot. Than he fell in love with an earth woman, he didn't know how to showcase that and he knocked her up. He was more of a chaotic neutral that didn't care for his family. His future son learned him how to care and he went crazy when he was killed infront of his eyes. He fought for someone else for the first time in his life when he attacked Cell all out. 
In the Buu arc he couldn't cope with the person he had become. He someone thought that having love around him was making him weak. He tasted the evil side again but he realized that he only wanted to use it for it's power. He gave his life and repented for his sins. He died while honouring his son, wife and even his greatest rival. From that moment on he made a HUGE change. He wasn't like the old Vegeta anymore. He would still have his pride but he would also protect his family.

He got his life back and he did everything in his power to stop Buu. He even merged his body with his greatest rival. He even set his pride aside for the greater good. Adriod and Cell arc Vegeta would've never done that. Goku defeated Buu and Vegeta finally admitted that his greatest rival was better than him. He's always 1 step ahead, a true fighting genius and Vegeta accepted it. When Goku left with Uub he called him a friend. This Vegeta is a different Vegeta. He was a developed Vegeta.


So people that are saying that Super and the BoG/RoF movies ruined him are possibly extremely stupid or 12 years old. Vegeta got development and his character progressed to the point where he is now. He defends his family, he even shows his son that he cares through though love but he still kills badguys when it's needed. Ginyu is dead by his hands. Freeza was going to get killed by his hands and he's currently after the head of Black and Zamasu while saving the future of his son because he cares.

The new showrunners are called Guggenheim and Mericle and they ruined certain characters and have no idea what to do with certain storylines. So watch that show with this risk.

LoT is fun, but a really really really dumb show. It's not very well written and characters tend to act like really really really dumb people. It's still fun though. 

You can also watch Supergirl. It's also in the same multiverse. It starts out very rough with a lot of forced feminism because a CBS exec wanted to see that.

One where Goku never died from a heart disease, where the Cyborgs weren't pure evil and Cell showed up. But that timeline gave him the skills to go back to his own timeline and save it. If he hadn't done it his world would've been destroyed. Zamasu sees that as a sin because he fucked with the natural order of things, something a 'god' should only be able to do. In the end Trunks did it for mankind and he actually saved his world (until Zamasu showed up). But there wouldn't be a world to show up on if Trunks hadn't taken out the Cyborgs and Cell. 

Meanwhile Barry is selfish and wanted his mom back...... but the thing is that he was actually restoring the natural order of things. So I don't get why Barry gets so much shit.

I had no idea who Goku was and who Krillin/Gohan/Piccolo etc. were waiting on. It was a huge suprise to me when he showed up. A legendary warrior showed up that I heard about through stories of Gohan. It made his entrance to the battlefield even more epic. I remember hating Vegeta alot. He was so evil and easy to hate. Such a stuck up royal. Tien losing an arm also made a huge impact on me. 

A few weeks after this reruns started and I got to see the beginning of Z and everything started to fit better. After that the episodes came back and I kept watching it like crazy. I would also watch the reruns at nights and in the weekends. I've watched DBZ so many times now it's crazy. ",2016-10-02 20:18:45+00:00,d8b7dp4,1.0,t3_55ixid,13932.0,dbz

539,"I love this idea. It gives the forms much more meaning than just an upgrade in power. I'd love to see Trunks transform and they are suprised his hair goes Purple. Than Whis or someone else drops some knowledge about how their forms are fulled by different things. Blue by willpower. Goku and Vegeta wanting to break barriers of power to improve themselves and Trunks by hope. 

It would also be fitting if Trunks and Vegeta take Black out together while Goku gets Zamasu. Trunks gets his vengance and saves his world. While Vegeta also honours future Bulma's death. Have them both blast Black away with final flashes. Or have them both badly injured and they stand side by side firing a ki blast together. Mirroring Gohan/Goku vs. Cell a bit where Goku cheered Gohan on from other world. 

Or have them finish Zamasu off while Goku gets his mirror image. 

It can work both ways. Vegeta and Trunks can hold Zamasu accountable for Black and everything else while Goku gets to finish off his mirror image. Maybe Goku will get a peak into something he could've been himself. Have Black seed a thought in Goku's head and have that thought stick with Goku in the next arc... this would probably never happen but I'm just here rambling my fantasies.

By killing a big chunk of the population to rebuild again. The death of his wife and his descend into crazyness will make him do this. He'll slowly grow crazier. 

However the Skrulls will fuck him over first and this will cause him to team up with heroes. He'll be on the good side for a while untill he his next step. 

First: Norman Osborn. The former glory of the science world suddenly makes a comeback. He never stopped being a genius but after the death of his wife his company went down the drain because he let it slowly die. But now he's back and determined to make something amazing out of it. He claims that he's doing it for the memory of his wife and for his son. 

Norman even aides Tony Stark. Everyone trusts Norman. He donates money to politican candidates. He does work for charities and he's loved by the geek world online. 

Norman slowly starts to show his true colors. He isn't that good. The money for the candidates are for questionable reasons, the money for the charities have an other motive. He's basically Frank Underwooding everyone. 

He's a viscious businessman with a great image to the outside world. A bit like Steve Jobs.

More gets revealed over the and through multiple movies.

This Norman Osborn will bascally be the Lex Luthor we needed in the DCEU but more Frank Underwoodish mixed with a bit of Heisenberg and a dash of Raylan because he'll be a charming motherfucker played by Timothy Olyphant. (he was once up for the Tony Stark role). ",2016-09-17 23:15:14+00:00,d7r3wkq,1.0,t3_5396kr,7254.0,marvelstudios

593,"Vegeta being the big hero in a franchise where Goku is the prime protagonist?

Here's an ending I'd like:

Vegeta's ending:
The ruler of planet Sadala gets killed during an epic last arc of Super. At the end of this arc Vegeta takes his whole family and goes to planet Sadala to rule it. Bulma is the one that pushes him to go. Prince Vegeta finally becomes King Vegeta.

Goku's ending:
He basically becomes stronger than the strongest being in the universes but Krillin or Master Roshi reminds him that there are always bigger fish out there. This is one of the biggest themes of DB and it would be fitting if Roshi or Krillin would say this to Goku. Roshi always tried to learn them that. The main reason why he participated in the Tenkaichi Budokai as Jackie Chun.

Gohan's ending:
The last arc had him back in full force protecting his family and reaching new levels of power. He had a few wins but he died and was brought back to life. His last scene is him running late for a conference because he is training crazy hard. He'll be always running late. One of Videl's last sentences will be about Gohan always being late. Shadowing the thing Goku was famous for. 

Piccolo's ending:
The guy becomes a Kai. Yeah, from evil demon king to freaking Kai. He'll get a mini arc in the second to last arc of Super where he discovers ancient Namekian secrets that make him more powerfull and Goku will have to point someone out to make a Kai out of. Zeno will ask Goku to pick someone. Goku will tell Zeno he knows exactly who he'll pick.

Krillin's ending:
Still banging 18.

Tien's ending:
Finally together again with Launch. 

Yamcha's ending: 
He'll get in business with Mr. Satan and Mr. Buu. They will open a gym franchise together.

Bulma's ending:
So she'll go with Vegeta to the new Planet Vegeta and she'll be like a happy kid in a candy store because their tech will be much more advanced. She'll be living her dream. 

The Super Dragon Ball's ending:
They get destroyed at the end of the final arc to save every universe, otherworld and even hell.

Gowasu turns out being the real threat the whole time, having a connection to the future. Present Zamasu prevents the Super Dragon Ball wish. Beerus kills him. Gowasu appears as the real threat. Trunks comes out of the RoSaT. Gohan takes Gowasu out. Trunks returns to his time with Gohan to face Black and Zamasu. Gohan will have to face his father's face while his real father is really dead. The Super DB's can't bring him back anymore through Present day's zamasu's tricks. Trunks and Gohan get the upperhand but then..... Zamasu plays with Gohan's and Trunks' feelings and tells them that there's an other way to bring Vegeta and Goku back. Trunks knows it's a trap to let Black and Zamasu get away. Gohan pulls a Vegeta and lets it happen. Zamasu brings Goku and Vegeta back and tries to capture them all into space and time. (remember how Zamasu revealed himself through the clouds. That's a special way of him transporting himself. He will use that to trick them all). Trunks realizes what is happening and throws himself into the line of fire and rescues Vegeta, Goku and Gohan. Trunks gets injured very badly. Gohan now hates himself. Gohan goes in reckless. Goku tells him to wait. Gohan gets beaten down by Black who everyone thought just died. He had a fatal injury. He now fatally wounds Gohan too. So Trunks and Gohan are down. Black and Zamasu now fuse. The immortal fusion. 

Goku and Vegeta trained in other world. They will know fight together after their promise to never fight together again. They won't fuse but they will help each other in the fight against Blacksu. Trunks being injured saw what Black and Zamasu did with their rings and he now remembers what Kaioshin once said to him. Kaioshin gave him the potara earrings and told him that one day he should use them if he found a suitable partner. Trunks didn't know what it meant then. BOOM. Injured Trunks and Gohan fuse and their injuries are gone after the fusion. It's 3 against 1 now. Blacksu is  that strong. It's an epic fight. Blacksu even gets to the point of power where he destroyes the fusion between Gohan and Trunks. All hope is lost. Goku is heavily beaten and lies on the ground. Vegeta too but he is still standing. Blacksu flies into the sky and is ready to blow them all up.... Goku pushes the Zeno button.

A casual viewer wouldn't even notice it was the same voice actor. 

So what I'm saying is that I'm glad that Black isn't just a 'dark Goku'. He truly believes what he is doing is justified. He has his own personality. Really loving the character. He is quickly becoming (together with Zamasu) one of my favorite DB antagonists. I never expected that.

Reese and Finch are both Batman. Think about it. The hate for guns. The badassery. The billions. The dark past. The inner pain. Vigilantes.

Carter is Gordon. The cop that first wants to stop the man in a suit and then works togeter with him.

Fusco is Bullock. The corrupt cop turned good and changed his ways.

Root is Catwoman. When from evil to an anti-hero to good. Has attitude. Is strong. 

Shaw is a Robin or Nightwing. A sidekick but also a hero in her own right.

John Greer is clearly Ras al Ghul. The man behind the scenes with a vision for the world. An extreme vision thats crazy. He wants the vigilantes on his side. They don't want to work with him though. 

Decima tech/Samaritan is The League of Assasins. A secrect group that's led by Greer. Bunch of hitmen.

Bear is Ace the wonderhound.

The subway or the library is their Batcave.

The Machine is their Oracle.

Elias is the underground genius mobster. He is The Pinguin.

740,"Dragon Ball Kai made me a fan of the Japanese dub.

I grew up loving the Funi dub and hating the original dub.

I hated the Goku voice. I hated how they screamed. I hated the music. I hated the silence.

But I grew up and my tastes changed (probably got more refined) and I gave DB Kai a chance. Finally something 'new' DB related. So I watched Kai, hated how they restored some of the animation. It looked worse imo but I really fell in love with the voice acting and script. I finally realized how inferior the English dubbing was. I also went back and watched the original Japanese version and I was sold. 
The music, use of silence and soundeffects, script and voice acting are way superior. 

The thing I started to  dislike about the Faulconer OST was that Funi didn't make use of silence. The OST kept going and going. An example of this is during the Cell saga. You hear an epic Cell theme and it instantly crosses over into a goofy Hercule theme. That really collided with eachother imo. Just like how Goku was turning SSJ3 for the first time, the epic SSJ3 theme played but the scene cuts over to Hercule falling down in his gym but it interupts the theme with a goofy hercule theme again. The soundtrack just wasn't placed or paced very well.

Now I love the voice for Goku too. I started nothing how well the voice actress changed her voice while playing Gohan, Goku and Goten and kid Goku. When a DB Super preview happens at the end of the episode and Gohan talks you really hear that it's Gohan and not Goku. That's really incredible imo. 

I do prefer the Nozawa voice more for Kid Goku and Goten though. But the Japanese voices for Krillin, Vegeta, Piccolo etc. are better in Japanese imo. Sabat forces his voice too much. 

The English dub has become better however, all because of DBZ Kai and the recent movies. The English voice actors have stepped up their game like crazy. There's a big difference now with the first Funi dub. The first funi dub tried to copy the Ocean Dub. Sabat sounds seriously HORRIBLE as Vegeta while faking a fake British accent. It's just bad. And you can clearly hear that it's Schemmels first acting gig. He sounds so bad. The second funi dub was a step up. The third is the one most people still watch I think and they totally forgot about the first one, which they watched as a kid. ",2016-08-27 14:41:59+00:00,d6ytme7,1.0,t3_4zrjad,54885.0,dbz
741,"They won't change the score. Funimation is a legit dubbing studio now. They aren't going to change the original that much. The script will also be more faithfull than the horrible changes Funimation and Ocean/Blue Water made back in the day. 


The only change will be the voice acting and minor script changes so that the voices match the lipflaps. 


I don't want to jerk myself off but when Super came out I said here that it was going to take at least a year or 2 for Funimation to dub Super. They did BoG and RoF immediatly but those movies were being distrubuted by Fox. It made it somehow faster for Funimation to dub because Fox wanted to release the movie as quickly as possible. With the Tarble special, Bardock episode and Super we still haven't gotten an English dub because it seems like Toei and Funimation don't work that quickly together. Funimation would want to dub it as fast as possible, so it's possible Toei that has a different plan with their property. The reason why it has taken longer than a year for an English dub. 

I also think it's funny that the Japanese version sounds way better in the example you've posted. The Japanese version seems more intense. The silence helps. It builds up tension. The US version always has a soundtrack going on to convince the audience that there's something going on. I love how the Japanese ost is used. There's also more attention to the soundeffects because of the silent moments here and there. They really pop. I grew up loving the Faulconer OST. I hated the Japanese, but growing older and watching the original I started to get why people loved it and I also started loving it. When I go back to the English dub with Faulconer music I now feel there's something missing. The orginal score really captures the tone of DB imo.

An other funny thing about Faulconer is that he hasn't made any noteworthy OST since Dragon Ball Z. His employees have also come out and said that they did most of the work and created most of the soundtracks. 

This guy is one of them. Just listen to this track and how much it sounds like a Faulconer track... because he made them for Faulconer! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62ez3682Qe8
Edit: this track wasn't used in the anime and I presume this guy created it after working with Faulconer.

765,"I was just thinking about how dark I made it with Goku raping. I'm taking that out of there. It's a bit too much. I also thought about Goku and Chi Chi still falling in love.

I'd do it this way:

Goku meets Ox King. He battles him and Chi Chi interupts the fight and asks for mercy for her father. Up until this point we haven't seen Goku giving any mercy. He lays eyes on her and right at that moment he falls in love with her. He tells Ox King that he will let him live and that he has his daughter to thank for it. 

Years later he comes across Chi Chi again. Goku has conquered more of earth now. Chi Chi is drawn to Goku and she sticks by his side for a while. The whole dynamic about how he's evil and how could she possibly love him is explored. Chi Chi doesn't turn Goku good, but she has an influence on him.
Out of their love a child is born: Gohan. A few months after his birth Chi Chi gets killed by Goku himself. Goku wants to attack a city and tells Chi Chi to stay behind. Chi Chi however convices Goku to have mercy on that city... Goku agrees with her, he wants to change his approach. Goku leaves for the city and Chi Chi learns through a radio (secretly listening to red ribbon channels) that they've got a new weapon that's rumored to stop Goku. She heads out to warn him. Goku fires off ki blasts and Chi Chi is caught by it.
He didn't meant to kill her. Now she's dead in his arms. Goku goes crazy. He doesn't care for the mercy anymore and he slaughters everyone. The rumored new weapon does nothing to him.

767,"''Do you wanna know how I got this scar?''

Alternate reality DB:

Goku lands on earth. Is found by Gohan. Goku doesn't bump his head. Because of his strength Gohan tries to control Goku, but Goku keeps growing stronger and kills Gohan at a certain age. 

Goku heads into the world. Comes acros the tenkaichi budokai. He decides to compete for shits and giggles. He ends up killing Krillin who is trained by Master Roshi. Master Roshi wants revenge and fights Goku in the final as Jackie Chun. He participated as Jackie Chun to test Krillin.

Goku's and Roshi's fight ends in a draw after he destroys the moon.

Goku heals and gets a zenkai. He's found by King Piccolo and trained by him. Piccolo will try to use him but Goku betrays him and kills him. Goku learns about the dragon balls through Piccolo and he first makes a wish before killing piccolo. He wishes for immortality. Piccolo is dead now and the Dragon Balls and Kami are gone.

There's nothing to stop Goku. 

Roshi finds out about some talented young fighters and trains them to stop Goku. He himself won't be enough. Yamcha and Tien are these fighters. Tien was being trained by Master Shen but even Shen saw the danger of Goku and he teamed up with Roshi. 

Goku is on a rampage through the world. There is no moon anymore, so no more Oozaru. He kills lots of people. Destroys the Red Ribbon Army that actually tries to stop him. 

Shen and Roshi lead Chiaozu, Tien and Yamcha into battle. They team up against him and they find out he's immortal. He kills Master Shen, Chiaozu, Tien goes crazy and almost dies himself after using his tri beam. Yamcha and Roshi survive and take Tien to safety. 

Now they now Goku is immortal so they come up with the plan to use the evil containment wave. 

Goku keeps fucking up the earth and comes acros chi chi. Now I can really make it dark. He could rape chi chi (yikes) and Gohan can be born out of this (yikes) (I feel uncomfortable typing this). 

Goku keeps his rampage up. Tien is healing for months, there are no senzu's. Goku never met Korin. Yamcha heads out to stop Goku  himself. Roshi warns him not to do anything stupid. You can' take him alone Yamcha... but we all know Yamcha.

Yamcha goes and confronts Goku. Goku laughs his ass off. Kicks Yamcha's ass into pulp but he lets him live. Goku is so evil, says he needs his playtoys on earth to keep his power up until his brothers from space come and join him. Goku is basically making the planet ready to sell off. Goku remembers his past. 

Yamcha survives and tells Roshi what Goku told him. 

Roshi and Bulma have met but in a different way without Goku. Bulma was in search of the balls and this is how she got involved when Goku made the wish for immortality. Bulma starts to investigate spacy stuff with her dad. Mr. Popo approaches them and points them towards Kami's ship. This will be Bulma's, Tien's and Yamcha's way to Namek to get the dragon balls and wish Goku's immortality away so that they can have a fighting chance. 

Goku keeps killing.

Bulma, Yamcha head to Namek. Tien refuses to go. He'll keep watch over earth. Roshi tells him that he'll has to visit Korin for training because he can't teach him anything else. Tien goes to Korin. Senzu beans get introduced. Tien trains at the lookout with Popo and Korin. He'll grow to at least Raditz level over there. His same level as in the Saiyan Saga. 

Goku is a teen now btw. We are on the same time period pre saiyan saga.

Bulma and Yamcha find the dragon balls easily on Namek. There is no Freeza or Vegeta ofcourse.

They meet Nail. 

They try to wish goku's immortality away but this doesn't work. Porunga tells them he can't cancel the wish of an other dragon. So they make the wish to get Shenron back so they wish Kami and King Piccolo back. King Piccolo will now join the Z-fighters, he sees what danger Goku is. Kami tries to presuade him to merge again but King Piccolo is to proud to do that. 

With the second Namekian wish Krillin gets wished back alive.

We will find out that Krillin kept his body in other world and kept his training up. He made the trip to King Kai's planet and trained there. He doesn't know Kaio-Ken or the spirit bomb. Goku (in the original story) only learned those techniques so fast because he's a prodigy, a freak of nature. Krillin isn't so it wouldn't make any sense. Krilling keeping his body and going to King Kai does make sense. He was a hero, so keeping his body was possible and Kami pulled on some strings in other world to give Krillin the possibility to travel snake way. 

Krillin won't be on Goku Saiyan saga level but he has grown in strength and could at least hold his ground against this Goku. Teaming up with Tien and Yamcha could give them a chance (if Goku wasn't immortal). 

There is 1 Namekian wish left and Bulma/Yamcha will use that wish to teleport themselves back to Earth. They will take Nail with them. Guru will order Nail to join them.

Now we got Nail, Yamcha, Krillin, Tien and King Piccolo

Goku senses something has happened. He knows the dragon has been brought back to life because the sky turned dark. When he killed King Piccolo the dragon was still active. Goku knows z-fighters will try to take his immortality away. So he has his guard up. 

All the z-fighters head out to find the dragon balls but they can't find 1. Turns out Goku has it. It's the four star.

The only way to get it is to take it from him. 

So the plan is to battle Goku. Take the dragon ball during battle, have someone leave the battlefield, go to the other balls and make the wish.. meanwhile they still need to kill Goku. They don't even know they are strong enough to kill him. 

(Nail isn't as strong yet btw as during the Namek saga. He'll get stronger over time. I'd guess he was weaker and younger during the king piccolo/saiyan saga). 

So... the Z-fighters team up against Goku.... It will be a long and crazy fight. And something unexpected will happen... Raditz will arrive during this fight. 

Goku was about to lose but he gets back up. The Z fighters get their plan done btw. They take the 4 star away from goku after a sneaky solar flare. They wish the immortality away. When they almost have Goku dead Raditz appears. King Piccolo merges with Nail and the new Nail takes Raditz out.

Goku escapes.

He takes Raditz' ship. Super angry he'll head back into Freeza territory. 

He just found out through Raditz his planet has been blown up and that he serves Prince Vegeta/Freeza. Goku will meet Vegeta in space. Vegeta will be suspecious of Goku. He's too strong for his taste. But Vegeta will learn about the dragon balls. He'll tell nappa and Goku that Freeza's reign is over. The Dragon Balls are his and they will take Freeza out.

So after this Goku, Vegeta and Nappa will head out to earth.

Earth fighters: Nail, Yamcha, Tien, Krillin and baby Gohan. (yeah that super dark bit is back) Gohan is 5 years old now just like during the Saiyan Saga. He isn't evil like his dad. The explaination of this will be the human side. Gohan still will have anger issues and the explaination for that will be his saiyan side. 

Nail/King Piccolo trains Gohan.

Krillin, Tien and Yamcha train with King Kai. They are alive but they get the dragon balls to bring them to King Kai's planet. So everyone will be a bit stronger than in the original Saiyan arc.

Goku tells Vegeta and Nappa that the fighters on earth are strong and they bring back up. Few of freeza's henchmen that have no idea what they are getting themselfs into.

Btw. King Piccolo and Nail merging doesn't mean the balls don't work anymore. Kami is still alive and King Piccolo  is alive within Nail. 

Back to the story. Gohan gets trained by Nail and isn't a scared kid. This Gohan will be more like original kid Goku. He grew up training with the Z-fighters.

Okay so Vegeta, Nappa, Goku and the henchmen arrive on earth.

Nappa battles Tien and Krillin.
Gohan fights the henchmen with Yamcha.
Goku fights Naillo and Vegeta watches the fight. 

Nappa kills Tien. Krillin avenges his death and kills Nappa. 
Gohan fights against the henchmen easily and Yamcha has trouble with them. Gohan has his back however. Yamcha is amazed and afraid how much ease Gohan has with them.

Nail has a lot of trouble against Goku and Gohan will eventually join his master and stand against his father. Gohan doesn't know btw that Goku is his father. There will be a great darth vader moment here. NO. I AM YOUR FATHER!

Gohan will be shocked and disgusted. But this will prevent him killing his own father. Vegeta escapes after fighting Gohan, Nail and Krillin. Krillin cut his arm off. Nail dies and Gohan goes into super rage and almost kills Oozaru Vegeta after going Oozaru himself. Goku doesn't have a tail anymore btw. When he was immortal he cut it off, saying he didn't need it anymore. 'I evolved'.

So Vegeta escapes earth and leaves Goku to die. Gohan  however doesn't have it in him to kill him off. Krillin takes his destructo sword to his  throat but Krillin doesn't have it in him, seeing Gohan there. Goku laughs and tells him he's weak. Krillin thinks, okay fuck you and he cuts his throat. Goku gasps for air.... he dies. 

Vegeta heads out to Namek. Freeza too.

The earth dragonballs are gone again without Naillo and Kami. The space ship is on Namek because Bulma and Yamcha teleported back through the dragon. But they will be able to make a new ship from the henchmen ship vegeta brought with him. Just a few fixes and they can take it into space. Dr. Briefs also makes a gravity chamber in it.

850,"Some more rambling.

Merlyn dissapears and the prison on the island is empty. Season 5 will show that Merlyn broke Slade and Boomerang out. Boomerang went his own way and Slade teamed up with Merlyn. Slade first wanted to kill him but he learned they shared a common enemy. During season 2 of LoT Slade will make his appearance alongside Merlyn and the previous Ra's and they will form the legion of doom. 
They will be the reason why Oliver will team up with LoT for an arc. in season 5. This arc will be tied in with the new season 5 mysterious villain. 

It's a character that hides his face. He is doing what Oliver was doing in season 1. He steals from the rich, even if they aren't bad and he helps the poor. He's an extreme robin hood that leaves bodies everywhere. He's a skilled fighter and not magical. He'll act extremely intelligent and the fun thing about him will be that he won't have bad intentions. He thinks he's doing the right thing, even if it means killing innocent people. But slowly it will be shown that there's something wrong with this villain. He starts getting crazier and crazier. It will be revealed that it's Tommy. He is the result of Merlyn's plans which are connected to LoT. This is where the LoT comes in. He isn't raised back by the lazarus pit. He's a result of time travel. He'll basically be a mix between Zoom/RF/Arrow.

This season will have Oliver's old demons come back to hunt him. Slade, Tommy, Merlyn, all the people that he's lost. ",2016-08-17 22:23:16+00:00,d6lt8gp,1.0,t3_4y6jnt,21515.0,arrow

949,"I've suffered from panic attacks too. 

They are freaking horrible. The feeling that you can't breathe. That there's something wrong with you. You try so much to get control over your body again but your body doesn't let you. You grasp for air but you just can't breathe anymore, it's like you've forgotten how to breathe. It's really terrifying.

But the thing is that you can CURE it. I've done it myself. I haven't had panic attacks for over a year now and I can say for sure that's a thing of the past for me. I've learned what my symptoms are if a panic attack wants to sneak up on me. I've learned to calm the fuck down and to control my body. Now when I feel something coming I just tell myself allright, this is a symptom. Come on, try to fuck me up I'm not afraid. When you do this, when you actually don't give a shit anymore the panic goes away (in my case). This is what I found out about myself. I just accept it and it goes away. I haven't gotten one for over a whole year, but I felt a few coming up but I now recognize them and they don't do my any harm. This is the key to my panic attacks. I can really control them now and I'm not afraid of them anymore. That's also the thing, because you are afraid you just make them worse for yourself. 

My steps for curing/controlling them: Know what causes them. Recognize the symptoms when they pop up and don't fight it. Accept it and don't be afraid. It's just panic, there's nothing really wrong with you. It  will fade away when you accept this.

Have the arc start lighthearted. Have them somehow have to make that journey to that realm.Give them an adventure there. Have them discover a conspiracy or something.

Nice start off for a DC CU.

After this movie come in with Batman 1 directed by Nolan with a few adjustments to make it fit in the Superman verse. Connect it in that world and go on with the DC CU from there.

1071,"People compare Broly to Hulk, but these people make 1 huge mistake. Hulk is actually interesting. The whole Bruce Banner/Hulk thing dives into the psychological aspect of the character. Meanwhile Broly is just a one-note character that just screams Kakarot because he's angry Goku cried a lot as a baby. Such a dumb motivation. Toei was really lazy creating that character. 


Broly is basically a filler character. Like every pre BoG movie . 

What more do you need from a DB villain? The DB villains are more than simple like you are saying. Freeza was heavily connected to the history of the Saiyans. He had a huge part in Vegeta's life. He killed Goku's best friend. He was an interesting villain seeing how  powerful he was acros the universe. He was something we hadn't seen before in DB. 

Cell's obsession with perfection and the way he was built up was also done very well. He was introduced as a very scary and mysterious villain. He was a gamechanger. 

Black wants to take out mortal beings because he sees them as a failure. A waste of space. He has solid motivations.

Dr. Gero wanted revenge on Goku. It was personal. He created Cyborgs and Andriods for that purpose. 

King Piccolo had also more to him than freaking Broly. He was one side of a coin. The evil side of Kami. He was an ancient menace. 

Emperor Pilaf was a hilarious villain. The fool with a god complex. Thinking that he's so though while he basically just wants a hug. He's funny. 

Tao was a badass assasin.

Vegeta, the ruthless elite and prince of all Saiyans. Interesting character that went to evil. To anti-hero to hero. Great development. 

Broly is nothing compared to these guys. Such a simple brute. Even Nappa is more interesting. He was loyal and looked up to Vegeta and in the end he got betrayed by him. That's a more interesting arc than Broly ever had. ",2016-08-01 15:56:49+00:00,d5zpxb6,1.0,t3_4vi6zn,78836.0,dbz

People think he was a teen during the Cell arc because the English version of the anime mistranslated a lot of stuff. But he was actually never called a teen in the english dub, the video games did. Just like giving him the ''mystic'' or ''ultimate'' name. Those names were never given by him in the manga or anime. Elder Supreme Kai only unlocked his raw power that was always lying deep inside of him. That form never got a name.

Goku wasn't fighting for fighting? He spared Vegeta's life? 

The only reason Goku let Vegeta go in the original series is because he wanted to fight Vegeta again. Not because he did that out of the goodness of his heart. He asked Krillin to answer his selfish request so that he could fight Vegeta again because their fight ignited his love for fighting again. 

Goku always loved to fight and always wanted to test his own strength against stronger opponents. King Kai told him to stay away from Freeza. He ignored that hard. 

Goku also ignored what Bulma said, to locate Dr. Gero with the Dragon Balls. Goku and Vegeta both wanted a challenge. They wanted to fight.

I also went back and watched it with the original Kikuchi music and I started to understand how horrible placed most of Bruce Faulconer's music was. I still LOVE a lot of his themes, but I don't like how epic Cell music directly goes into goofy Mr. Satan music without any use of silence. The US funi dub just goes on and on with the music.

1271,"Also this.

Gohan ALWAYS fucking hated to fight. 

1. He was shitting his pants as a kid while Piccolo was training him. He fucked up everything during their fight against the Saiyans. Toriyama made it clear from the beginning that he was different from his father. Goku LOVED to fight since he was little. Gohan didn't.

2. Same thing on Namek. He become more of a fighter but he still wasn't jumping around wanting to fight. They didn't expect to fight badguys on Namek and when the shit hit the fan Gohan was shitting his pants. Sure he stepped up and fought Freeza too. But he only did that because there wasn't any other reason. Goku on the other hand LOVED the idea to fight Freeza. King Kai told him to stay away and that gave Goku a raging boner to fight Freeza. Gohan isn't like that.

3. During the Cell/Cyborg arc Gohan did train but he left the fighting over to his dad. His dad was the one that faced Andriod 19 first. Gohan wasn't even participating in the fight.

4. Goku had to force Gohan into fighting Cell. Gohan didn't even believe in himself. He didn't even want to kill Cell. Freaking Cell! He did when he saw Andriod 16 being destroyed before his eyes. That was a turning point, he fought Cell to protect the world and his family and friends. But he still didn't love to fight.

5. So it was perfectly logical that Gohan became soft in peacetime after the Cell arc. Trunks' future was prevented and they didn't expect something like Buu to pop up. He did help Supreme Kai because he had to. AGAIN only stepping up when he's really needed because he doesn't love fighting like his dad. He isn't the same character like his dad. So just give up again your dreams about this super badass Gohan that loves to fight or future one handed Gohan. That's a future that's prevented. 

GET OVER IT. And try to understand that Gohan being 'soft' is apart of his character. Toriyama gave Gohan contrast. He's a soft and loving person with a rage deep inside of him that only comes out when it's really needed. And he doesn't love that side. He'd rather spend time with his family and doing what he loves: being a scolar than fighting. AGAIN. Gohan is not Goku.

1393,"I'll just keep telling you people that Yamcha is more than meets the eye. He's an ancient Saiyan in disguise.


Yamcha came from Universe 6 many ages ago. He was the most evil Saiyan in U6. They are goodguys there so he really stood out. He was planning to take over the universe. He was in a fierce battle with their very own legendary Super Saiyan God. Yamcha however was so strong and had such a huge pride that he battled this Saiyan God in his baseform. That's how strong he is! His baseform was just as strong as the Saiyan God. He didn't want to go all out because the Saiyan God was beneath him. Yamcha however let his guard down and got knocked in the head very hard. The next thing he remembers is waking up in the desert on U7 earth. A magical being from U6 planted new memories in his mind and they left him on earth because his body was too powerfull to destroy. The destruction of his body could've also caused the destruction of the entire universe... all universes. The energy within his body is at least a trillion times the energy of a big bang.


Yamcha is the endgame. He'll be the final villain of the whole DB story. And in the end he will win and enslave everyone. EVERYONE! The omni king will bow down to him.


The last DB arc:
The story of the previous arc ends and there are peaceful times yet again. During the previous arc Yamcha got hit really hard in the head again and he's been feeling different since then. He has been having these nightmares of a different life. He just doesn't understand them.... yet. The arc begins with Yamcha in bed, sweating his ass off and having a nightmare. We get a glimpse of his nightmare. He's killing powerful beings one by one with ease. We see his late wife and kids who he had when he was still in U6. Yamcha wakes up and doesn't understand what's happening yet...

Bulma is having a party again and he meets up with Krillin and Tien and they head out together. Tien is with Launch, Krillin still with 18 and their kid and Yamcha feels like a loser. All alone. During the party they are all making fun of him and he really feels like a loser. Goku shows up during the party and all the attention goes to him. Yamcha starts feeling this jealousy and resentment towards him. The party continues and Goku starts sparring with Krillin. Vegeta challenges Goku to a fight. Everyone gathers around and they battle it out. During this fight Yamcha starts to feel something awakening inside of him. Everyone is now sparring with Goku, they are all trying to fight him because Goku will be that strong at the end of the story. Yamcha suddenly bursts with power, flies in a fraction of a second towards Goku, flies right by him mid air... everyone is looking shocked.. something drips from Yamcha onto Chi Chi who is looking into the sky.... it's blood. Everyone is looking disgusted.... Yamcha is holding Goku's heart! And it's still beating! Yamcha gets the most evil smile and takes a bite out of it.... Yamcha: ''ugh... Universe 7 Saiyan heart tastes even worse''. 

Goku falls down onto the ground. And the fight with Yamcha beings! Gohan is enraged and has gotten God level powers during the previous arc. He is on a new level. Vegeta also has incredible power. Bulma has given Tien and Krillin power ups through her very own super soldier serum. Everyone is at their peaks. Yamcha kills them all except Pan. She's 8 or 9 now and all alone. He tells her to get strong and come and get revenge. He destroys the earth dragon balls after wishing for immortality and he collects the Super dragon balls for himself with his super instant transmission. 

Meanwhile in other world Goku is going on a other worldly journey to get stronger and to find a way to stop Yamcha. Pan leaves earth with Bra and they will try to find the Super Dragon Balls. 

But in the end, the highly intelligent Yamcha will see through everything. He'll invade other world, get Omniking to his knees and destroys Goku's other world body.

1409,"Here's how to bring the Fantastic Four into the MCU movies:

Thanos is kicking everyones ass with his army and undead villains that he raised back to life with his gauntlet. The Avengers are losing the battle and then in a moment of dispair they hear the voice of Phil Coulson over their coms. He's back and he's brought some friends. In an epic montage you'll see DareDevil, The Punisher, Quake, Agents of Shield, Iron Fist, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Mr. Fantastic, Jonny Storm, Sue Storm and Thing kicking ass. It won't even be explained who those 4 are. They will just have a cameo. After this phase they'll get a movie to start off the new phase that won't tell their origin story. That movie will recap their origins quickly in a natural manner by just referencing what happened to them and the movie goes on to the rest of the story. We will discover that they have been active for halve a year or something. 



How to introduce the X-Men: during the second phase after the new era of MCU has started. Mutants are started to be discovered. Just put mutant characters in different movies here and there and then bring them together in an X-Men movie. ",2016-06-26 17:09:21+00:00,d4orws1,1.0,t3_4pwmyu,37067.0,comicbookmovies

1433,"I think Tony Stark dealing with panic attacks and Scott Lang having to change his life for daughter is more real than Superman being compared to God (including visuals that hammer that down).


The whole MCU started out in this world that was based on realism. With characters acting and talking like real people with real people problems. That's Spider-Man's whole deal. It's a world where strange things started to happen but the characters in that world still deal with it in a real manner. Like Tony Stark's PTSD or Rocket Raccoon's traumatic past. Characters being funny also doesn't mean they can't be realistic. In our real world even soldier who see the most horrible things during their duty still make jokes all the day to deal with the horrible stuff they see. So I can't get the criticism of people when they say that jokes take the stakes out of a movie. That's bullshit imo. You can still have a balance, like in the real world. 

Being dark and brooding in a gritty setting all the time isn't realistic. Not even soldiers act that way in real life. They still make jokes even in combat. ",2016-06-24 14:30:28+00:00,d4m9iik,1.0,t3_4plfrs,29472.0,DC_Cinematic

Season 5 will most likely feature Felicity getting pregnant. This makes sense because they need a melodramatic storyline for the next season! So Felicity gets pregnant and doesn't tell Oliver...... lol


They won't be together but they will hook up one night and decide that it will be a one time thing only. After this Felicity discovers she's pregnant and doesn't tell Oliver for a while. Then there will be something dramatic going down where Oliver wants to go on a suicide mission and then she comes clean in a Tumblr quote type of manner.

Oliver looks WTF suprised and walks to Felicity and kisses her. He immediately forgives her that she lied to him for weeks.

Everybody was like, oh well... crazy Felicity again and they ignored it. 


I shouldn't have written this. If this finds it's way to Meriheim/Guggencle I'm sure we're going to see it. 


Edit: or do you know what's even more ORGANIC^TM ?! They found the pregnancy test in the loft and Felicity told the gang that it is Donna's.

I seriously was feeling tension for the first time while watching Vegeta escape Freeza's ship with the Dragon Balls after causing a diversion. I also loved how Krillin was  the main character at times. Leading the expedition on Namek and being the guardian of Gohan. Loved the interaction between Gohan, Krillin and Bulma. Loved how evil Freeza was and how he was the ultimate baddy. Loved how he was connected to Vegeta's and Goku's past. Loved how Vegeta reached an emotional climax with his arc. I'll never forget his tears. He went from a ruthless killer on earth during the Saiyan arc to somebody you felt sympathy for when he was dying. I loved how well Toriyama built the universe of Dragon Ball. The technology of Freeza's empire is iconic. The suits. Their style. Their weapons. The ships. Everything is stylized to well. I loved Namek, such an original planet. I loved the Namekians. Piccolo finally coming home was also done very well. 

The Namek/Freeza arc is just done so very well and will always be my favorite DB arc. Everything was executed so amazingly well and it was the arc that really sparked my eternal love for DBZ. I was glued to my seat like crazy. The fight between Freeza and Goku felt like a long heavyweight championship boxing match that went on for too many rounds. It was something I had never seen before. Destruction on such a huge scale and you still cared for the characters. That's the charm of DB. So much fighting and epicness and you still care about the characters. 

Freeza was also the best villain imo.

A U6 backround is the new animation in the opening where Black stands before a U6 backround. The same animation that was used when Whis was explaning U6 and U7. You can see the same yellow galaxies that are apart of U6.


The kai is related to the U6 Kai's because they are all green. The U7 Kai's are light purple.

This is all obvious and already spoonfed to the viewers.

I still think it was a fun movie. Sure, I would've loved an intimidating Ben Kingsley Mandarin but I don't hate the twist. It was an intelligent movie and I thought it was an interesting risk they took. And the risk with the Mandarin worked imo. I also really loved how it showed that Tony is a hero without the suit. It really developed his character much further. The whole PTSD thing was done very well. I know a lot about panic attacks and it was portrayed very well. Also loved the humor throughout the serious tones the movie had and the action was great. Especially the big suits everywhere end battle. The dialogue was good, the writing was good, the direction, editing, cinematography is good, the music was good.. I can get if people don't like the twist.

Goten from an other timeline lost Chi Chi, Goku AND Gohan. In this timeline he gets influenced by Freeza who killed Goten's family and kept Goten to remind everyone who's the winner. Goten grows up and becomes even stronger than his father and takes Freeza out. Goten returns to earth and wrecks havoc. The Kai's have to step in because he has caused a trail of destruction before coming back to earth. Buu level destruction. Goten knows IT. He kills a Kai and takes his potara earring. Goten finds a timemachine at Capsule Corp after taking on Vegeta and Trunks and killing them. He takes it and discovers the other timelines. Forms a plan to kill the people who let him down in his own timeline. Growing up thinking that Goku failed with protecting them, hating his father fueled by Freeza's hate. 

Goten travels to Future Trunks' timeline and that's were the arc begins. 

In the end, he'll get defeated by 'our' own Goten and Trunks. After training for a few years in the time chamber and perfecting fusion. Reaching godly levels of power. While they are training Goku and Vegeta fight him. He defeats them. Kills them both. Meanwhile Krillin and other z fighters leave earth to find the super dragon balls to stop Black Goten. They will find them eventually but their wish to take Black Goten out won't work. Black Goten IT's to them and kills them all. Right at the moment Black Goten wants to make a wish Gotenks emerges out of the timechamber. Does crazy super speed traveling through the time chamer and pops up right at the side of Black Goten and their fight begins within the Super Dragon. No Piccolo, Goku or Vegeta anymore to keep them in check or anything. Gotenks gets serious for the very first time. A teen Gotenks fighting adult black Goten after years of time chamber training.

It has a Quicksilver speedster scene again. And there's Katstique returning again. 

The way Singer comes up with excuses to keep Beast and Mystique out of their blue forms is also laughable. This isn't Beast anymore. It's a Hulk knockoff. I also never liked Hault in the role. Really bland. Same goes for Katniss as Mystique. 

I really enjoyed the movie for what it was. It's nothing special. I'd say it's better than BvS (not hard to pull off) but not as good as Civil War.

1762,"How would a Arrow/DareDevil cross-over work?

Strong and powerful Felicity creates a breach to earth-marvel. She does this by hacking time and space. 

Matt senses an evil danger approaching through an interdimensional portal and he goes to stop it. He already has met Dr. Strange and he thinks it's Dormammu. So Matt and Dr. Strange team-up to go to the portal to stop the evil from entering their world.

When they come close to the portal Dr. Strange is starting to chant his magic while DD is on the look-out. Suddenly they hear crying through the portal. 

It's Felicity that's nagging at Oliver's soul. Dr. Strange can't handle the negative energy and he passes out. It's now up to DD to stop this evil. He only has 1 option. He has to go through the portal and stop the evil in that dimension so that it can never hurt anything again.

DareDevil goes through the portal and ends up in the Arrow HQ. He finds the door unlocked and he walks right in. 

Felicity is making Oliver scrubbing the floor while she is resting her legs on his back. 

DareDevil works swiftly and he attacks. While Oliver is on the floor Matt strikes at Felicity and kills her. He set his no kill code aside for pure evil. Evil that can't be redeemed. Elektra thought him how to sense pure evil.

Oliver can't believe what just happened. He breaks down and starts crying. They are tears of relief. He jumps at DD's feet and starts kissing them. He thanks DD for his help.

Oliver is now finally free from the evil magic spell Felicity had put on him. He had to act all in love with her and she made him change who he really was. Since he walked into her office in s1 he was a changed man. Trapped in his own body, witnessing the horrible acts he commited: dumping laurel and going with felicity etc. etc.

Oliver and Matt form a friendship and DD goes back to his earth.

He finds Dr. Strange finally awake again.... but there's something off......everyone is starting to act differently in his universe.... he discovers that a part of felicty came through the portal and she started to replicate. The whole MCU will now have over the top melodramatic romances that make no sense, are really forced and take the focus away from the main plot...

1845,"I already think S2 of Flash is a step back from S1. S2 is basically a rehash of S1.

Zoom, evil speedster villain that wanted Barry to get faster.He's got a variation of the Flash costume. He's from a different place in time and space. He was Jay and Hunter. Just like Wells and Eobard.

One was from the future, the other from earth 2. One wanted Barry to get faster. The other one to, to steal his speed. Eobard was pretending to be Wells. Hunter was pretending to be Jay.

The way they killed Ronnie off in the S2 premiere was Sara Lance level of weird. 

Barry getting his ass kicked by slow ass thugs is just as dumb as Oliver getting his ass beaten by thugs. 

The way they wrote Henry Allen out of the show at the beginning of the season was so freaking dumb. Barry was traumatized since he was a little kid. Lost his mom, she died and he lost his dad, he went to jail after being wrongfully accued for her death. Barry had to miss his dead all of his life, so he made it his lives work to bring his father home and what does Henry do at the moment he gets out of jail?? BYE! I'm going to fish. I'd just hold you back being the Flash. Huh? Wait! Why?? Makes 0 sense. That would be like saying Joe holds Barry back being the Flash. No because of father figure Joe, Barry gets the help he needs. So that's a bullshit reason the writers came up with to write the actor out of the show for a moment.

Jay being Zoom was so forced into the plot like Laurel being the one in the grave. It just didn't work for me. The whole time remnant thing is so convoluted. People say they planned on making Jay into Zoom. I don't believe that for a moment. These types of shows don't plan everything out beforehand.

Very afraid that Flash could lose more of it's quality in S3 if they start shuffeling the writers even more. I suspect that this is the case this season. Arrow felt better during it's first halve this season, the second halve has been way worse. While I would say Flash has become a bit better in it's second halve. LoT also came back stronger after the midseason break. It's like writers were shuffled.

Totally brings me back to IM1 and 2. Ramin Djawadi is a great freaking composer. Kinda sad they changed him with Bryan Tyler, but his score for IM3 was still good. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ido-a1W8sN8 It got stuck for days in my head.

The The Avengers theme is pretty epic and iconic. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VGJGXMUhmc

The AoU theme is also great, with different MCU themes mixed together. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIhX1OAI5XM

And if the Ant-Man theme doesn't get stuck in your head, I don't know what will. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_5NwVy8L5M

The The Winter Soldier theme is also freaking amazing and heroic. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgZ_0msKRAE

I don't get the critique many Marvel theme's get. I think they are overall solid. I just don't like that they changed the Iron Man themes, but I can live with that. 

Or just listen to this compilation of all the great MCU themes. I think they are quite enjoyable. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHiQSpaYSLM

1894,"How I'd do this.

Cancel all the DC CW episodes of a certain week. So no Supergirl, Arrow, Flash and Legends of Tomorrow episodes for 1 week. Take the budget of all of those episode and make 1 tv event out of it. A tv movie. Promote the shit out of it and use the tv movie to bring more viewers to The CW. 

These series probably have a budget around 2 mil per episode. This would mean a 8 million budget. At least. 

Have Grodd as the mean villain with back up of other villains from this universe. Have a team up of villains be the reason why the heroes also team up. Grodd returns from Earth 2 with a master plan. His plans will cause different earth's to merge. This is how you put Supergirl in the Earth 1 universe, without having to travel between the earth's all the time.

And because of the higher budget you can pull off Grodd for a longer period of time during this tv movie. Grodd gets Eobard Reverse Flash somehow, a villain from Supergirl and a supernatural villain Oliver has run into before.

Make this the CW DC roster: Flash, Arrow, Supergirl, Constantine, Vixen, Black Canary (reformed Black Siren, she's a wildcard, an  anti-hero) and maybe even Martian Manhunter instead of Constantine if it's impossible to bring him in. 

Superman will probably be impossible to get. Seeing how even Supergirl can't use him. They should find something to fix that on Supergirl. Maybe have him missing for good, or kill him off and make Supergirl the main super kryptonian of the CW universe. Because why even matter having a Superman if you can't even use him? So just kill the guy off. Maybe the tv movie could start off with the death of Superman because of the villain' plans, causing that to bring all the heroes together.

2010,"Felicity was a minor character at first back in season 1 of Arrow. The writers wanted to bring a character in to help Oliver Queen with technical situations. So if he needed to hack something he went to her.


The producers noticed that fans liked the character and they gave her a recurring role in season 1. She was fun. Great comedic relief in a serious series and she had this awkwardness that somehow contrasted Oliver's seriousness very well..


Moving along to season 2. She became a series regular. Still no problem there. Felicity was still funny but she wasn't in your face all the time. Other more important characters got their deserved screentime. Meanwhile the tumblr fangirls were going nuts online and started to ''ship'' Oliver with Felicity and called them Olicity. The actors had no chemistry and Oliver had other love interests. The writers tried to put some romance between them but you could notice that the writers abandoned that plotline very quickly because there was no chemistry.


Season 3: Flash season 1 started and the showrunner of Arrow moved to Flash and took lots of writers with him. This is where the horror began. The new writers and showrunner: Marc Guggenheim started to write the shit out of Felicity. They made her a bigger character. Made her more dramatic and less funny. She started to become whiney, illogical, hypocritical and just plain insane. Her charm, goofyness and humor was gone. They made her into a ''Mary Sue'' character that could do no wrong. And the hardcore fans started to get annoyed like crazy by her. 

Writer Wendy Mercile wrote lots of stories for her in season 3 and she wrote Oliver and Felicity together after a horrible will they, won't they arc that made no sense at all. Ra's al Ghul eventually brought them together, I'm not shitting you... The tumblr fangirls left wet spots all over the place and Wendy Mericle got promoted in season 4 and became co-showrunner. Meanwhile Mericle and Guggenheim are running the show into shit. 


Edit: The reason you probably liked Felicity on Flash is because the writers that know to handle her are currently working for Flash. ",2016-05-14 21:20:01+00:00,d35mwre,2.0,t1_d35m1t9,1532.0,DC_Cinematic

2014,"She didn't sign onto a comedy. She signed on to do a dramatic action comicbook show. First she was used as comedic relief and they started to ask more dramatic stuff from her. If you call yourself an actor and sign yourself up for a drama, you'll need to back it up with some acting.

Guggenheim is to blame for the horribly written show. But EBR is also to blame for her horrible performances. Stephen Amell also gets shit material but the guy still holds his own. Same goes for the guy that plays Lance. They are good actors. EBR is not. And it isn't an excuse that she only joined to do comedic bits.

Like how all the people were fancasting Mark Strong and Bryan Cranston as Luthor because they are or were bald. Sure, they are great actors that would pull it off but other actors with hair can easily shave it off. 


Just like how this fancasting goes for Charlie Hunnam because he had a goatee once.

2120,"The Batman (No origin story. It's Batman in a Die Hard esque situation in Arkham Asylum. It will explore Bruce's pshyce, inner rage, non-killing code and his relationship with The Joker. It will also set-up supernatural elements within the DC world. Guys like Killer Croc aren't that natural. But aliens will still be something the world hasn't seen. And even with the supernatural elements this world is grounded in realism). 


The Last Son of Krypton (Superman is revealed to the world. It explores how uneasy Clark is at the beginning and it will work towards a hopeful message at the end of the movie. Kal El's main foe will be Brainiac, connecting him to the destruction of Krypton. An intimidating, non goofy Lex Luthor will be constrasting Superman during this movie. He'll be the voice of fear and in some way also reason towards Superman. It will portray Lex as a good guy with legitimate fears during most of the movie. The audience will really have to think about who's side they are on. But it will reveal towards the end that Luthor has some hidden agenda when he collects or has Brainiac' tech. He'll be a figure that walks the thin line between right and wrong. The ending of the movie will have Wonder Woman approaching Superman). 


Wonder Woman (Diana sets out into the world for the first time. Not in our recent times but long ago. It will work towards present day. She'll be a figure that's always been there in the backround). 


The Flash (Barry Allen gets his powers. Still is learning more about what he can do. Professor Zoom is being set-up as his arch nemesis. He'll be from the future. The ending of this movie has Flash vanishing into time by accident. This movie will have a Batman guest appearence). 


World's Finest (Batman, Superman AND Wonder Woman will star in this movie. They've all been set-up in their own movies first. This movie will have them battle a common threat they've got. And it will also give them the idea for the Justice League. Bat's would've gotten The Flash to help but he vanished at the end of his own movie). 


Green Lantern: Hunt of the Martian ( Green Lantern is already active for a while and Martian Manhunter will be his foe during this movie. This movie will explore Mars's destruction, white Marsians, racism etc. With MM doing something which he thinks is right. Green Lantern doesn't agree with this and they stand on opposite sides. Towards the end they understand each other, get a common goal and team up. MM will start of pretty villainous but he'll get developed into an anti-hero/hero. He'll redeem himself in a great way. Superman will approach GA and MM at the end of this movie. ). 


Justice League (The very first Justice League movie. Flash pop's up again. His return will cause the trinity to form The Justice League because of a threat coming that they all need to handle together. Darkseid is coming). 



Man of Steel (This movie will have Superman being the full on Superman we all know and love. Because of Brainiac's tech Lex Luthor will be a force to be reckoned with. But he'll stay this morally grey character that sets into a descent of crazyness. This movie will have an other main villain. A new modern take on Mxyzptlk. It won't be a goofy or campy character. He will be more mysterious and he'll challange Supes in different ways. He'll have reality warping powers and he'll challenge Supes to use his brains. It will dive more into how genius Superman actually is).

I'm fucking in love with the MCU, but that trilogy is imo just as solid or maybe slightly better than the Cap trilogy. Batman Begins handled Bruce Wayne's origins so well. It was an overal solid movie. Just as First Avenger was. But I would say Batman Begins is a better crafted movie. The Winter Soldier was amazing. It had most definatly better action than The Dark Knight. But the story and performances in The Dark Knight make that movie win. The Dark Knight Rises is a great movie too imo. Bane is so quotable and I don't have the problems with it like many sheeple do. But I do think Civil War is way better than TDKR. So I guess it's 2 against 1. With The Batman movies winning. The Winter Soldier does come really close to TDK though. And it's certainly better than Batman Begins and TDKR. 


And to compare CW with BvS.... CW shits all over that movie. BvS doesn't even come close to the Nolan batman movies or the Cap movies. BvS is more in the The Amazing Spider-Man 2 corner.

2173,"''Even Nolan'' still had lightheartedness in his Batman movies. With Bruce cracking some jokes here and there with Alfred, Fox or having dinner with Harvey Dent and some models. I feel like Snyder is taking it too much over the top with making Superman brooding a lot. Lex Luthor reffered to Superman as day and Batman as night, like how they are sometimes called in the comics. But that doesn't make any sense in this movie universe. It's more night vs. night. 

I don't think this is a DC problem but a Snyder problem. He has said he only thinks comics are interesting if there's murder and sex in them. DC needs directors that get these characters and not one that will try to force them into something totally different. This is what Marvel understands. They keep it as close as they can to the source material and they change stuff to make it fit in a live action environment. Like Visions costume or not making the event that started Civil War of a reality show. 


You can still make a serious movie about Superman and also still make him a hopeful character. Just look what Marvel did with Cap. The Winter Soldier was a serious movie. It had high stakes and it even changed a lot in the MCU. It made Cap into an interesting character after years of people thinking he was boring. The same criticism Superman gets. They say he's a boyscout and not interesting. DC could've given him the Cap treatment and make him interesting that way. He doesn't need to be brooding all the time. Make him someone that stands for what he believes, have him smile a few times, it wouldn't hurt to crack a joke once or twice in his movie. Even Bruce Wayne did it in The Dark Knight. And you could still give him badass moments. Not every single superhero has to be dark.

Batman dark? Okay that fits.
Superman dark? That doesn't fit imo because it goes against so much what Superman is about. He should be the light in the darkness. I'm not saying make him campy or super lighthearted. He can still be a serious character. Dark and serious are 2 different things. ",2016-05-07 13:55:50+00:00,d2wc6a7,1.0,t3_4i7xtz,47753.0,DC_Cinematic

I thought he was a sad character because of losing everyone. And he actually succeeded with putting the Avengers against each other.


This is the universe where Black Widow disguised herself as a totally different woman and infiltrated a meeting while acting like her.

Flash suffers too much of filler throwaway villains and a rehashed plot. Season 1 was way better. Season 2 has brought more illogical plot and behavior of some characters. I blame Berlanti doing too much shows. 


But I would still put DareDevil above AoS though. 


My ranking:

1. DareDevil (Best overal writing, acting, plot, logic. Negative: that would be nitpicking).

2. AoS (Solid. Great characters. Storylines. Amazing strong villain. Great performances. Brett Dalton as Ward and Hive is great. Negative: scope could be bigger).

3. Jessica Jones (Solid neo noir detective crime drama. Love it's original flavor. Amazing villain. Interesting complex main character. Negative: 1 side character could've been better).

4. The Flash. (Why it isn't higher: Too much throwaway villain of the week episodes. Too much illogical Berlanti verse behavior. This seasons villain is too much like the season 1 villain. Some actors tend to overact really over the top).

Same shit was being said about superhero movies and look at them now. 


It has to take someone with a solid vision and a studios behind it that understands the property. Fox will only skull fuck it. Just like how they have no clue how to handle Marvel movies without Bryan Singer or Ryan Reynolds.


Some people say that DBE was horrible because it didn't copy the manga or anime 1 on 1. I also don't agree with that. You can still change stuff if and when it makes the overal story better on the big screen. Marvel has changed lots of stuff for the better or they mix certain storylines together and make something new out of it.

2329,"Season 5 episode 1. 

First scene: Oliver is talking to someone over the coms and the audience assumes it's with Felicity. He arrives at a crime scene and he gets attacked by a gang. There are too many of them and he needs back up. He is still having a banter over the coms... and then his back up arrives. The audience doesn't see who this is.. kicks some ass and a Canary Cry happens. It's The Black Canary. It's Dinah Laurel Lance. This is now revealed to the audience and the audience gets that he was having the banter with her because they resume what they were talking about. They are kicking ass side by side...

After this it will be explained that something happened to the timeline when Vandal Savage got stopped in LoT. Oliver and Laurel are together. Black Canary is epic. In her Black Siren outfit from Flash earth 2) which suits Katie Cassidy much better, judging from the leaked pics. Thea is currently traveling the world. Diggle is working with Argus together with Leyla who's the head of Argus and Roy is back as Oliver's sidekick but with an mechanical arm. 

The team will find out that something happened to the timeline during this seasons arc and they will fix it with somebody that's a remnant from the ''original'' timeline. It's Felicity. They meet with her and befriend her. She's act all apart of the team and she convinces them to work to change the timeline back. BUT they soon find out that Laurel is dead in the other timeline and that a lot of good things didn't happen. Long story short. Because of Felcity's deception and her wanting the old timeline back and the influence from her father she'll become the real villain of the season. 

At the end of the season she'll be put in the island prison with Slade, Merlyn and Darhk who all ended up in there. But they will all escape and Felicity will convince them to unite and all go after Oliver together. But she'll end up dead in season 6. The audience will despise Felicity like how they hated Joffrey in Game of Thrones. She's become that type of villain. People already hate her. So why not use that hate and turn it into something good storywise! Make her a villain!! It would be really fitting and super organic.

Meanwhile this new timeline stays in place. Green Arrow and Black Canary are together. Diggle has a place at Argus. Roy is back and it's a three 'man' team with Green Arrow, Black Canary and Arsenal. Roy will even get his mechanical arm. 

Thea will return as an anti-hero. She'll have elements from Artemis in her character. She'll be Roy's nemesis at first but they soon find out each other's id's. They'll be the mister and misses smith of the series. Thea eventually joins the team when Roy actually dies because of all the villains teaming up. This will cause Green Arrow really wanting to take the fuckers down. And it'll keep the team small with 3 members and Diggle still with Argus who works with them from time to time. Not every freaking episode. He'll be developed in episodes which are more centric around his character. Same goes for Black Canary and the sidekicks.

Because they stayed true to Colossus's character for example, his outfit and look were on point and they used him in a way that's close to the comicbook. That tone should always stay in the X-Men movies but Fox doesn't seem to get that. That's why I'd rather see the X-Men at Marvel too,  seeing how they just know how to handle these characters. And that isn't so weird, seeing how Marvel Studios is specialized in just Marvel movies while Fox also has different movies to give their attention too. They aren't specialized. 


It took Ryan Reynolds' dedication to get Deadpool right and Colossus too. While other Marvel Fox movies have been quite bad if Singer wasn't involved and the Singer X-Men movies are okay, but not great imo. 

People say that a Wolverine costume that would honor the comicbooks would be too goofy. Oh, seriously? So does Vision look goofy? Thor? Cap? They all have extreme outfits in the comics but Marvel Studios knows how to adapt them, make the modern and fitting on the big screen. I'm sure Marvel would find a way to make Wolverine look great in a variation of one of his comicbook suits. Him wearing the suit is also a sign of loyalty towards the X-Men. The Fox Logan misses a lot of elements that make Wolverine really great. They rely a lot on Hugh Jackman's charm to make the character work atm.

Carter is clearly their detective Gordon while Fusco is clearly their Bullock. The corrupt cop that turns good.


Decima tech. is their league of assasins with John Greer as it's Ra's al Ghul. Both have a twisted vision for the world and both have organizations underneath them with assasins. 


Elias is the Pinguin. The big mobster in town. 


Root is Catwoman. First a villain, than the ant-hero and now the hero.


Shaw is a Robin type character or Nightwing. A sidekick but also a hero in her own way. Now it seems like she's become a Red Hood. ''Dying'' and becoming evil? 


Not Batman related but Bear is their Krypto. 


I wasn't suprised to find out that Jonathan Nolan is the showrunner for PoI. He basically wrote all the Batman movies with his brother and he probably did tons of research on Batman which he also used for PoI.

In Africa, Asia, Europe, everywhere. Same goes for Spider-Man and Hulk but Superman has a bigger history seeing how he's the first. His popularity also had a longer time to spread all over the world). 

2. Spider-Man. (Spider-Man is such an iconic figure. Cartoons from way back helped make him more populair. But there's something about him that made everyone around the world knew about him). 

3. Batman. (Due to the movies since the 80s and the live action tv show way back everyone knew Batman). 

4. Hulk. (Everybody around the world knew Hulk. If you call a strong person a Hulk everyone knows what you mean around the world. There's a Brazilian football player that changed his name to Hulk. This was before the MCU movies.


5. Wolverine. (Wolverine was always iconic in his yellow suit and his claws. The 90s X-Men cartoon helped with his popularity with my generation but the older generation also knew about the image of this character).

The only way WB can compete against this is by making truelly great movies. But my expectations have gone to 0 with the Snyder movies. So I'm not expecting anything anymore from that guy. I'm just hoping other DC directors will make great movies. It's just too bad Snyder is doing Justice League. He totally doesn't get it. His comments on superheroes talking in their costumes and naming them just shows how he lacks the vision to make these things works. 


Snyder thinks that everything has to be dead serious after TDK movies. But the funny thing is that the TDK movies actually were quite hopeful. With Bruce trying to make his city a better place and standing for an ideal by being a symbol. It also had Bat's talking alot in costume and it also had the superhero naming himself. So how is that goofy in Snyders mind? 


But about the iconic thing. A character like Iron Man has truelly become iconic after bing a b-lister. I knew about him during my youth, but I never thought he would become this big. His movies make more money than movies that have Batman and Superman in them. I think that Iron Man is the character Marvel has made truelly iconic these past years.

This is the only way:


Cancel the show immediately and start a new show called ''Green Arrow 2046''. Have the actor that played Connor Hawke as the lead actor and Stephen Amell as old man Oliver as a supporting character. Don't do any flashbacks. Be about a city that's gone totally to shit. It's like a post-apocalyptic mad max setting where crime is the rule and not the exception. 


Make it dark but also have dark humor. Let Oliver be like old Bruce Wayne from Batman Beyond but also a bit more active. A mix between Bruce Wayne from Batman Beyond and Oliver Queen from The Dark Knight returns. ",2016-04-24 01:15:29+00:00,d2evqrw,1.0,t3_4g52bb,18239.0,arrow

2. DB. Because of my huge love for DBZ I went back and watched DB after the dissapointment GT was. I fell in love with the series again. It's much better than DBZ storywise and it's also fun to see how everyone met. 
3. Super. It's just a huge blast from the past and it's so amazing that we are finally getting a continuation of the story. I'm enjoying it like crazy. 
4. GT. It was a huge dissapointment. Probably because I was expecting it to be like DBZ. But maybe I should go back and rewatch it. 


But DB and DBZ should actually be seen as 1 series. Seeing how the manga went from the moment Goku met Bulma until he left with Uub. There isn't a DBZ in the manga. It's all apart of the Dragon Ball story. So DB and DBZ are my favorite but I just love how the stakes became crazy since the King Piccolo arc.

This is also the most logical way to name the heroes. All of their names come from different origins. Some are named by the public, some by the media, some are an alterego or codename, while Thor is an actual name. 


Superman should be named by the public. Seeing how he has a big S on his costume. This was always the case in the comics too if I'm correct.

2598,"It comes down to Hit jumping forward in time each time he uses time leap. This caused Goku to predict Hit's movements. Hit fought Vegeta first and this gave Goku a chance to study Hit's movements. After this he fought Hit himself and he started to learn patterns Hit was making so he could predict his attacks. 


But Hit also has a different ability he can adapt himself mid-battle and become even faster. So his time-leap went even faster against Goku. He went even quicker forward in time causing Goku to use his trump card: the Kaio-Ken technique during his Super Saiyan God Blue state. Kaio-Ken increases power AND speed and that's just what Goku needed. More speed. He stopped using Kaio-Ken because it was a too big of a strain on his body as a Super Saiyan. But that strain is gone because he's reached Super Saiyan Blue which has less of a negative impact on his body.  This causes him to be able to use Kaio-Ken and making himself even faster..


It's also noteworthy that he hasn't even reached the full potential yet of Kaio-Ken as a super Saiyan Blue. He's still mastering it but even then he's much faster than someone that is moving foward in time in a super speed way. 


So Hit isn't literally stopping time. It feels for the people around him that Hit just moved forward in time, while he's just going super fast. During that moment it's like his opponent is just standing still. ",2016-04-17 19:54:26+00:00,d26ng6d,6.0,t1_d26n5qh,433.0,FlashTV

2602,"Thanks for the answer!


But does that mean that Wally is faster than time itself? Because Goku moved when time was stopped, he moved when Hit was leaping forward in time. Goku doesn't move in 0.5 sec. It's Hit that basically stops time for 0.5 sec while he's moving super fast. For everything around him it feels like 0.5 has passed while for him he's just going really fast.

See you soon xoxo


Guggie: Uuuh, about that. We thought it would be more organic to develop Felicity first. She'll have a BEEutiful nemessis instead, she'll be strong and powerfull. I feel like that's really organic to the story we are currently creating. But for everything to be organic your character has to die. Don't worry though, you can still be on The Flash as earth-2 Laurel.

I know how happy you must feel about how we're creating the most strongest and powerfull female character ever on tv. Your death will be the catalyst to Felicity's rise to hero hood. Felicity will be the key to everything and you will have an important part to play. You won't get an arc though, we'll just kill you suddenly because we had no idea who to put in the grave. 


Yours sinceriously,

Years have past on earth since Trunks defeated Cell and the andriods. The earth has been rebuilt or is almost done rebuilding and Trunks has kept up with training. He reached SSJ2 just like his father did in the main timeline.

Buu will still show up on his earth because Babidi sensed Trunks' presence and he wants to tap his energy to revive Buu. But Babidi won't succeed. Trunks is far more direct with taking out his enemies. The guy doesn't take any shit. He destroys the two henchmen babidi sends after him with ease. He also desposes with Dabura fairly easy. This will cause Babidi to flee. He'll go to different planets to collect the ki to revive Buu and he succeeds years after. Meanwhile Trunks has stil been training and he has surpassed the limits of a SSJ2. He didn't go SSJ2 but he perfected the form just like how Goku and Gohan perfected the SSJ1 form. He can  stay in that state for a long while with ease, he doesn't lose stamina or lots of Ki and he puts out just as much power as a SSJ3. 

So Babidi revives Buu and he starts wrecking havoc on different planets. This is where Supreme Kai gets Trunks to take Buu out. Kabito takes Trunks to the planet where he's currently fucking shit up and an epic battle will begin between the 2. Trunks will learn very quickly that Buu can absorb people so he will be defending himself against that. After a long and hard battle Trunks finishes Buu finally after Buu split himself up and became pure evil. Mr. Buu joined him and aided him. Evil Buu is dead and Mr. Buu joins Trunks on earth as a new ally. Meanwhile Trunks has made some new friends on earth too. Humans that can control ki, they've risen up during the whole andriod terror era. They are around the same level of power as Krillin and Tien were during the King Piccolo arc. Trunks and Mr. Buu are the strongest fighters on earth.

So Beerus will wake up. After having his SSJG dream and he'll find Trunks. The problem here is that Trunks can't summon the Dragon to ask about SSJG. But Supreme Kai and Kabito will show up after following the events with Beerus from a distance. They tell Trunks that Kabito collected the Namekian dragon balls after Buu's terror to restore certain planets. They currently have all dragon balls on namek stored away. Supreme Kai contacts a young man op Namek named Dende to make the following wish: who is the SSJG and how does one become a SSJG... So Trunks won't be able to transform into one seeing there aren't any saiyans around anymore. BUT this is where Universe 6 will be introduced. Beerus will give Trunks the time to go to Universe 6 to collect saiyans so that they can help him to become a SSJG.

Yeah it's taking inspirations from the comics. But it's not a literal copy from the comics. Marvel Studios ADAPTS the source material. They take it and change it and make it into something different for the movie universe. There are many changes within the MCU when you compare it with the comics. Wasp isn't a founding member for example. Thor isn't wearing his helmet all the time. The X-Men and Fantastic Four have no role in this version of Civil War, nor will it start of because of some sort of superhero reality show. 


How would it be bad storytelling if you haven't even seen the story unfold yet? You don't know how they would lead up to his death during the movie. It could make perfect sense and close up Bucky's arc within the MCU.

Iron Man 1 was a huge risk. RDJ was just coming back as an actor. It was the first Marvel Studios movie, if that movie failed MS would shut down directly. The Incredible Hulk was a huge risk. Nobody ever made a good Hulk movie until that moment. Iron Man 2 was a risk. That movie wasn't as good as IM 1 or TIH but it made just enough money to keep making MCU movies. Thor was next. Nobody every made a movie like Thor. Everyone was saying it was too goofy and wouldn't fit on the big screen. Until Marvel proved them wrong. Cap followed after this. Same stuff was said about Cap. He was  an old relic, too goofy for today. People bashed the wings on the helmet  etc. Then Marvel made it all work. Then the Avengers came. Everybody was saying they couldn't pull off a movie with so many characters. It was too much. It would fail. But what did Marvel do? They made a good movie again. 

Almost every movie, especially during phase 1 people were doubting Marvel at every step they took. It seems like people have a short ass memory. The only movies people didn't say it was a risk were IM3, Thor 2, Cap 3, AoU because these were sequels and their previous movies had shown that it could be done. But GoTH and Ant-Man were also being doubted a lot and they also are big risks seeing how they aren't even b-list. Iron Man wasn't even a-list when Iron Man 1 came out. It was a B-list character. Hulk was basically the only A-list character they had left over because of the rights selling. 


Everybody in 2007, all over the world knew Hulk, Wolverine and Spider-Man. These were the most well known characters. Wolverine was even big before the Singer movies. These 3 always were the big Marvel characters towards the general public. Most people had never heard of Iron Man or even Thor as a Marvel character. Sure people knew the ''God'' Thor, but not the comicbook character. Cap also wasn't known at all around the world. 

Marvel built this MCU with B and C listers. So I don't get how that isn't a risk. WB has Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman etc. How can't you make a bigger box office than a movie about Iron Man? Maybe it has to do about the quality of the movie. I wonder if these dc fanboys ever think of that.

I'm btw no fanboy. I love DC just as much as  I love Marvel. I just can't stand fanboyish behavior. ",2016-04-10 20:40:39+00:00,d1xnmwc,1.0,t3_4e6dt1,15639.0,marvelstudios

He basically created the blueprints for other mangaka after him to add onto what he had created himself. Toriyama created a whole world with unique characters, arcs and a whole system of powers that grew into the whole manga. 

DB gets underestimated a lot because of manga and anime nowadays doing it better. That's because they are all building upon what Toriyama had created. Sure, Toriyama didn't invent all of it himself there were also other manga that inspired Toriyama too like fist of the north star but what Toriyama did is creating his own original ideas (that have become clichés nowadays because they were that good and other creators took that over) and adding more onto it. 

Saying he isn't much creative in terms of powers is saying that Star Wars has a really basic plot and crap acting.

While WB isn't. It isn't a DC studios. WB does more than just DC. 

This is why the Nolan movies were masterpieces. Nolan is a masterpiece movie creator. Snyder tries to be, fails but makes visually appealing movies. MoS and BvS is in line with the quality of movies he always makes. He tries to be deep, fails, he tries to make it visually amazing, wins. 

David Ayer has made good movies like End of Watch. But he also made Sabotage. So it's waiting what he'll do with Suicide Squad. It could go either way.

DareDevil. The greatest superhero show atm. It's basically what Arrow wanted to be in season 1.

If you like history with a sci fi twist watch the man in the high castle.

Watch Better call saul if you liked Breaking Bad. But don't expect Breaking Bad level of action.

Watch The Wire if you like realism. If you like stories about crime and real life struggles.

Watch The Shield if a corrupt gang of cops sounds interesting to your ears. The whole show is about a group of a taskforce that are corrupt.

Watch The Sopranos if you are into mobster movies and series and you don't mind digging deep into the mind of a mobster that's likable in a strange way while he's a violent and dangerous thug. And you'd like a complex depressed character.

same goes for boardwalk empire but this takes place in the 20s during the bootlegger era. 

Watch Firefly if you like things set in space, sci fi and if you enjoy anime like  Cowboy Beebop.

Watch Fargo if you liked the Fargo movie. And if you liked Breaking Bad. The Fargo series is even better than the Coen bros. movie imo.

Watch Arrested Development if you want to laugh and marvel at the clever jokes that are hidden everywhere.

Watch OZ if you like a gritty show about a 90s prison. With JK simmons as a nazi gangleader.

Watch Battlestar Galactica if you like the terminator, sci fi, space opera's.

He made Tony to promise to keep his identity a secret while Tony gave Peter the resources to build his own Spidey suit. So Peter still built his own suit but Tony gave him the resources, that will explain the high tech eyes and perfect looking suit. Peter is a genius afterall.


So, Peter is loyal to Tony because of this. Now Civil War happens. Peter is a big Cap fan but he backs Tony even if he has some doubts about Tony's views about the whole thing. Midway into the movie Peter makes a switch after something happens between them. Peter betray's Tony and Tony beats the shit out of Peter. Peter ends up in Hells Kitchen and The Punisher finds him.

2898,"This show needs less characters, not more. Killing one off should've done that. 


Arrow has a problem with providing all characters enough screen-time. This isn't just because the writers don't know how to write an ensemble cast, they have an other or actually 2 big problems. The flashbacks and Felicity. The flashbacks don't bring anything extra to the show, they should be just get told if there's actually something to tell. And they take too much screentime. Instead of having a flashback where Oliver is walking through a cave you could've written a scene for Diggle of Laurel actually doing something or learning something. The second problem is Felicity. They give her way too much screentime and even if she isn't on screen the other characters are talking about her instead of getting their own character development.

Last episode Felicity was mentioned 17 times and Oliver/Green Arrow 6. Yes, I counted. 

Ways to fix this: Stop with the flashbacks, only do them when you have to tell a story from the island so that it can connect with something in the present. Like showing that Oliver went through something similar in the past, making his actions in the present understandable, as an example. And cut it out with the Felicity crap. If you fix these things it's possible to handle an ensemble cast way better. Diggle, Laurel and Thea deserve better storylines. Stop making Diggle an Olicity cheerleader, stop the talks between Laurel and Oliver about freaking Felicity and stop Thea talking to Felicity about Laurel all the time. Give them their own arc instead. ",2016-04-05 10:18:34+00:00,d1qijsm,1.0,t3_4dcsuh,51848.0,arrow

2936,"I'm not even a big Gohan fan. Goku is and always will be one of my most favorite characters ever. I just thought this would be an epic idea to bring Gohan back into the mix. And you don't have to tell me that Gohan doesn't love to fight, I know the character. But he does step up when he's needed. He also went back to training, as seen after the RoF with Piccolo. 


I said it was a fantasy. You want a way for Gohan to travel all the way to the tournament? This is Dragon Ball we are speaking about, the possibilities are endless. Dende could help him by sending him to King Kai, he could wish to be sent to the nameless planet, he could develop a version of the IT technique himself, he could learn a version of the travel technique Whis uses, he could come up with a totally different way to travel really fast, he could use a super space ship dr. briefs has made, he could use Mr. Popo's flying carpet which uses IT, he could die go to other world and be sent to the nameless planet by using King Kai's help, he could become a holy spirit and suddenly end up on the nameless planet, he could fart really intense and the fart will lift him off really fast into space. 

Gohan didn't defeat Cell with the help of Goku's spirit. Gohan defeated Cell on his own while remembering his father and drawing strength from that. His father ''standing behind him'' was just in his mind. Goku was being scolded at by King Kai in the meantime after he reached out to Gohan. 

Gohan also didn't go mystic. Mystic isn't a form. Elder Kai released Gohan's potential. That wasn't a form. ",2016-04-03 22:05:45+00:00,d1ok3fb,2.0,t1_d1ogyqv,4920.0,dbz

So Monaka should be the one after Goku to take Hitt on but Beerus reveals in a comedic scene that Monaka isn't strong afterall. He just used him to motivate goku and vegeta... Beerus reveals this while Goku gets the shit beaten out of him. Hitt punches or ki blasts Goku out of the ring. Goku lost. But Hitt doesn't stop.

An example: movies like Transformers are quite crap but they make tons of money. People go and watch them, so they keep making them because they make money. But they still are crap. The actors in them even know that. They just do it for the paycheck and years after they can honestly say what kind of shit they were in. Clooney still makes fun of his Batman movie until this day. Ben Affleck knows DD sucked balls. Halle Berry won't defend Catwoman. Sandra Bullock went to the Razzies and admitted how horrible Speed 2 was. These actors can all admit mistakes were made.

2997,"Arrow's hopes and dreams died in season 3 with Sara's original death.


I was seriously confused with that death. It came out of nowhere, the character didn't get any resolve, the character didn't get any development.. it just happened. I don't mind characters to die in tv shows. Many deaths of characters are done very well BUT after the character concluded an arc or made a big impact on the story. Sara was gone, came back and boom dead. And then they did the whole plottwist after plotwist about her killer. It was done so badly.


That's where I start questioning wtf was going on with Arrow. Did some research and found out that showrunners and writers got switched out because of The Flash. That's where it all began. All hopes and dreams for Arrow were dead and burried.

They tried to bring those hopes and dreams back. ''Lighter tone more fun comicbook Oliver esque, more greenish suit, the name Green Arrow and Sara's back.'' Lighthearted Oliver was around for 1 episode, the suit got a horrible effects filter, Sara's return was also handled badly and she was gone just as fast as her the resolve of her ressurection.. So much dissapointments. 


Oh well. We still got our angel Felicity and our great ship Olicity.


Edit:
Examples of great death's on Arrow: Robert Queen's sacrifice. It was shocking but it fitted the situation they were in. His death opened a whole arc for Oliver that was focussed it also let the viewer learn more about Robert's motivations and the list. Moira's death was also done well. Her character got some resolve with Oliver, that talk before her death was really nicely done and it gave Oliver a reason to really hate Slade. 


Badly done death's: Sara, Amanda Waller and Deadshot. These were truelly horrible and all post season 2. ",2016-04-01 23:06:32+00:00,d1me9z6,1.0,t3_4cx3yu,17557.0,arrow

3033,"One of the failures of the show is making the team too big. Team Arrow would've been cool if it was like this in season 3/4: Black Canary, Diggle and Green Arrow. And have Felicity as the season 1 and 2 Felicity being their ''Oracle''. Thea's arc should've gone into the villain direction. Come up with a motivation for her to turn against her brother and join Merlyn. That would've made her character way more interesting. And no Roy. Diggle would take his place as Oliver's 'side kick/alfred' in this version of GA. 


So in the field: Oliver, Diggle and Sara. Romance plotline between Oliver and BC. Felicity stays at HC as their overwatch. Meanwhile Thea is acting all evil around town becoming a ninja. 


Team Arrow is just too big atm. I would've also kept Laurel as DA during season 3 and 4 and make her BC later on in a more developed way. During season 3 and 4 she'd find out about Sara and Oliver. And during those seasons she gets inspired and starts training. Sara is against it, she wants her sis to be save. Laurel calls her a hypocrite wants to be able to defend herself. Oliver trains her instead. Sara and Oliver have a falling out. Meanwhile Oliver and Laurel romance is being developed. Sara dies somewhere in season 4 or 5. But it will be done well, not like the Guggenheim death at the beginning of season 3. She'll actually get an arc before her death. She'll infiltrate the league, trying to get close to Ra's, he'll be a mysterious figure. But then she dies while doing this. The whole season will let you think that Sara and Oliver hate each other. But they agreed to fool everyone that they've fallen out with each other and that Sara joined the league again to fight against Oliver but it was all a set up to get Sara closer to Ra's. But she dies and Oliver will blame himself. Meanwhile Laurel is going to pick up the mantle of BC after being developed into her since season 3. (it's the end of season 4 now).


Laurel becomes BC but still without her scream. This will be added into the mix like this: Laurel gets a nemisses. She gets her asskicked, her throat will get slit. Laurel will be in a critical condition. Barry Allen pays Star City a visit. Tells them that they can help Laurel in central city. They operate on Laurel and Cisco puts tech in her throat that can make her speak again AND emit high frequency sound waves. From the outside her throat looks normal but from the inside it's highly advanced. They'll use Pied Piper tech.

Laurel makes a come back and kicks her nemisses' ass with her cry. And that nemisses will be the one that killed Sara within the league on orders or Ra's. Ra's new along she was planted into his organisation to find out about him.


This would've been imo a much better way to go for these previous seasons. Season 3: introduce the thought of Laurel becoming BC, just training first to defend herself. The thought becomes stronger in season 4 while Laurel experience things that the law can't control. She starts feeling like what her sister is doing is the right way... At the end of season 4 she takes up the mantle of her dead sister honoring her memory..

It should have a big build up and it should really mean something when it happens. 

Meanwhile thea's storyline will be about Merlyn and ties to another mystical organisation. The thing merlyn wears around his neck will come into play with this. This storyline will also be ofcourse linked to Oliver. And Diggle's storyline will be about his brother and hive. And no his brother won't be alive. Diggle will uncover a conspiracy that has gone on for ages. Linking the league, hive and that mystical organisation merlyn is tied to together. 

Felicity's storylines: comic relief. Interacting with characters from other shows. Popping up here and there with references, but also a story with some subtance about her father. Her father will be linked to the island and turn out to be someone oliver met years ago on the island.

3048,"Atheism. I can get people doubting religion, but I can't get people who think that it isn't possible a highly evolved being can exist.


We are currently seeing our own technology evolving. We are even trying to re-grow limbs and clone organs. It could be possible in a few hunderd years to create AI, robots that look human etc. After that it could be possible to make humans immortal by curing disease and figuring out how to stop the aging proces And technology can keep evolving. So why is it far fetched to think there could be a being that's so highly evolved, immortal and powerful that could create universes or multuple universe. For all we know our own universe could be tiny compared to this being that's been around for billions, and billions and billions of years. 


Maybe it sounds ridiculous, but see it from this perspective: If you would go back in time and try to explain to a caveman what an iPhone is and that man can create it, what a tv is, how heart transplants can be done etc. He won't understand the concepts, he won't think it's even impossible if he even could understand the concepts. Maybe we are just like cavemen relatively speaking. Not able to grasp how such a highly advanced being could create all of this. 


This is why I can't get people who don't believe there could be something all powerfull out there that created all of this seeing how our own technology keeps advancing. 


Our own planet seems so huge. But comparing it to many other planets is so tiny. What if your universe is so tiny compared to this being? I really can't rule out a God existing. We know nothing yet relatively speaking about this universe. We aren't even done yet discovering things about this planet. So how can I be so sure of myself to dispel the thought that it could be possible that a higher power could be possible?

Superman is in an incident in his own universe and gets trapped into a singularity. That breach sends him into the Dragon Ball universe. Goku immediatly feels his prescense. It doesn't feel evil, he goes and checks it out because he'd like to fight him. He finds him while his power is being drained on a planet with a red sun. Goku saves him and takes him back to earth. Where he heals up and Goku notices his ki rising while on earth, being impressed how it keeps going up, wondering where his limits are. Goku tells Supes about the Super Dragon Balls and that they could wish him back to his own universe.... but first he wants a fight with him. Supes agrees.


The fight begins. Whis takes them into the hyperbolic universe to keep the real universe safe. But he'll provide a yellow sun within the chamber because he knows it's Supes's source of power.


Goku begins in his base form. Supes in impressed with Goku's technique and form. Supes fights back but Goku realizes he isn't putting up a serious fight. Goku starts becoming more serious while the fight goes on. He starts pushing supes back in his base form. Supes is totally suprised how strong Goku is and starts fighting back using his full power. Goku gets overwhelmed and becomes the legendary Super Saiyan. Supes can't stand the sheer power that's pushing from Goku. Now the fight really begins. 


Goku wins in his SSJ1 form. No need for SSJ2, 3 or G.

Have Robert put tons of secrets and mysteries in that list insuring that only Oliver could unravel them. That would've made for more intelligent storylines with Oliver having to think about the steps he as to take. 


Person of Interest and DareDevil are the best shows to watch to replace Arrow with. These shows are what Arrow wants to be but fails at. And I've figured out why PoI feels so much like a comicbook show. It's created and run by Christopher Nolan's brother and co-writer Jonathan Nolan. He has also written for The Dark Knight movies. I'm guessing he did tons of research for the movies, seeing how many elements feel Batmanish.


Finch and Reese are both Batman. 2 sides of 1 coin. Reese is the one with the anger issues and overall playboy badass. While Finch is the genius with a dislikes for guns. They've got their own Batcave: the library first and the subway station later on. They've got a cop helping them like Gordon. Carter = Gordon and Fusco is the corrupt cop who redeems himself: Bullock. 

Meanwhile Shaw is a Robin/Nightwing type character. She even was presumed dead and the last time we saw her it seemed like she turned bad like Jason Todd. 


Root is Catwoman. First starting out as a baddy, then being an anti-hero and now a hero.


John Greer is Ra's al Ghul. The guy with a vision for the world and an organisation under his rule (that even assasinates people), decima = the league of assasins.

Felicity is gone with her mother on a trip to a different DC city to train her legs.


Laurel gets more development now Felicity is gone. Diggle stops cheerleading for Felicity and tells Oliver how he has to stop following something that actually doesn't make him happy. That the thought about her, the idea makes him happy but when he's with her he puts his defenses up. Oliver slowly starts to realize that Felicity isn't the way to go.


They only talk about this at the beginning of the episode to resolve the dumb shit that happened in the last. From this moment on it's all about Darkh. The trail gets more attention. Darhk has set a plan in motion to get him out of there. His organisation will extract him. The whole city will know how evil the guy is when his agents shoot everyone in the courthouse. He only lets the vigilante's life. He'll reveal he knows their id's. He will rub it in their faces that they couldn't save all of those people and he's out of there. Taking joy in the team's defeat. He'll let them life because he wants them to suffer. 


The team wants to strike back but there's an old 'friend' back in town. Someone who was under Argus's watch but got out of prison. Cup... SLADE WILSON is back. But the guy seems sane and it seems like he wants to be BFF's with Oliver again. Oliver doesn't trust him. Something must be going on.... secretly Slade is working with Darhk.

3140,"And now you are contradicting yourself.


''Lol. You really know nothing about this topic. It's not up for debate at all. Before Cruyff was even born Michels played under Jack Reynolds at Ajax who laid the foundation for that type football.''


vs


''Lol, you really don't understand ""Total football"" at all. It's about using interchanging players to exploit space. No one played like that before Michels. ''


So Jack Reynolds laid the foundation for Totaal Voetbal according to you while you are also saying that nobody else played like that before Michels. Make up your mind my  friend.


And the Dutch didn't play the Totaal Voetbal way during 88. They played with 2 strikers instead of 3: Van Basten and Gullit. Totaal Voetball is based on a 4-3-3 formation. Cruijff was the one that really followed that ideology. Seeing how he implemented it in Barca also. Spain and Barca are playing now the Cruijff way. During 88 ''Oranje'' made more goals from counterattacks than from Totaal Voetbal style of football.


No one points the finger to Cruijff? Well I guess you'll have to look up Dutch interviews with his former teammates and journalists who had good connections with him. 




Edit:

A part of an article from a Dutch newspaper about 88:



It basically says that the Dutch weren't playing totaal voetbal in 88 and that Michels was enjoying their style of play. They weren't playing pressing or totaalvoetbal. The goals came out of counter attacks and Michels enjoyed it a lot. 


''Het meest fascinerende en unieke aan het Nederlandse spel in 1974 was niet het 'totale' ervan geweest, maar de zogenaamde pressing. Als in ijshockey had Nederland tot ver op de helft van de tegenstander jacht gemaakt op de bal. Geen elftal in de geschiedenis is bereid - en in staat - geweest dat zo consequent - en trouwens ook zo agressief - te doen als Nederland in 1974. En de almaar pratende en wijzende Johan Cruijff was er de leider van. In 1988, toen Cruijff trainer werd in Barcelona, was geen sprake van pressing of totaalvoetbal.

De meeste goals kwamen tot stand uit bijna het tegendeel, uit snelle tegenaanvallen. En Michels genoot volop. Hij vond het gouden elftal van Gullit 'als team' beter dan het zilveren WK-elftal van Cruijff. Wat een nette bewoording was voor zijn verlossing van de zelfzuchtige straatvechters van 1974.''

Actors like The Rock and Channing Tatum had to fail first in many different movies before they became really good after being a wrestler and a dancer. They took acting lessions and it took them a while to become better. Gadot could've been a good WW after a while. She's just a wrong fit atm. I wonder how the director of this movie will handle her.

She starts out in a selfmade outfit fighting thugs and getting her ass kicked. She gets trained by Oliver but he doesn't know that she's going out on her own... but then he starts noticing the bruises. She refuses to train her anymore. Laurel leaves Star City to go to look for Sara who is meanwhile infiltrating into the high ranks of the league. She's trying to get close to Ra's because he's a mystery but she needs to take him out with Oliver. They made a plan to put Sara back in the league to get close to Ra's. Everyone thinks Oliver and Sara had a falling out but that was a part of the plan. Making the league think Sara doesn't have any ties to the Arrow anymore... So Laurel is training with the league....

A whole while later Laurel returns to Star City and has made an arch  enemy when she was with the league. This enemy is still too strong for Laurel. She follows Laurel back to Star and she kicks laurels ass. She cuts her throat right open. Laurel is in a critcal condition. But she'll survive. But her throat is all fucked up. She can't talk anymore.. Cisco drops by and tells Laurel they've got a way back in Central City to fix her all up.... She goes to Central. They  operate on her throat. It looks normal from the outside but from the inside there are enhancements made. The canary cry is born!

Laurel meets up with this enemy again and the Cry helps her out defeating her. Boom great arc for Laurel completed! Starting out as an amateur. Going through hardships, training, falling and getting back up.

Season 3 was the season of the depature of showrunner Kreisberg and the begining of showrunner Guggenheim.


The showrunner decides the tone and overall direction of the show. Blame Greg Berlanti for doing too much DC shows and blame WB for doing to much DC shows with Berlanti's company. Berlanti doesn't have the resources to make 4 good shows. During season 3 Kreisberg left Arrow and went to Flash. Flash became good while Arrow was left rotting with Guggenheim. 

A showrunner is the most important part of a tv show. Look what happened with The Office, Dexter and Community when the showrunners left. A decline in quality and overal writing/direction. I heard that the same happened with The Walking Dead (I don't watch that show so I don't know myself). But it seems that everytime a showrunner leaves a show that show gets terrible and the hardcore fans start hating the direction the show takes.


It isn't a coincidence that we, as hardcore fans, started to notice some horrible things about it since season 3. 


So blame the writing and the showrunner who's responsible for the writing. Good direction in writing could've put Malcolm in a different direction for example. If Kreisberg stayed we probably wouldn't have had ''Olicity'' or he could've handled it better.

3370,"I've never seen a show that didn't go downhill after the showrunner got changed. The Office, Dexter and Community are great examples for this. The Office was a solid sitcom. Every episode had absurd and hilarious moments.. then the showrunners left and you could just notice a decline in quality. Short after that Steve Carell left. But that's an other element on it's own. 

Now look at Dexter. The showrunner left and the series took a turn. It just didn't feel like the same show. The feeling just changed.


Community had the biggest impact. Showrunner Dan Harmon was the heart of the show. All the main characters have traits of him in them. The overall tone changed drastically in the season that he was absent. And when he returned the quality went straight back up again.


So this is the moment where season 3 went downhill: The pre season prep. of season 3 where you didn't have Kreisberg anymore as the showrunner and Guggenheim took over. I don't blame Guggenheim for the decline of the show. It's all because of WB and Berlanti's production company. They just can't handle 4 shows under the same production company. It's too much and resources have to be split. Kreisberg went over to the Flash and you could just feel how the Flash profited from that. Kreisberg seems to have a better vision for these shows. Biggest reason why Arrow post season 2 is a lesser show. It doesn't have the man with the vision from season 1 and 2. He decides what tone the show has and what direction the writing will take. 


Edit: the showrunners of The Office moved on and created Parks and Rec. That show had the humour while The Office was just going downhill. I'm saying it again: the showrunner is just too damn important. ",2016-03-08 21:35:27+00:00,d0sjw10,1.0,t3_49kknb,1797.0,arrow

There are numbers on the board, the aim is to get as much points as possible with every 3 throws. Every player has to throw 3 darts at each turn. The score they get from that goes of off the 501. This 9  darter means that he went from 501 to 0 in a perfect streak scoring the max. amount of point in each round. 


The outer ring of the board gives you double the points and the second ring gives you triple the points. The aim is to get 180  points each time with the triple points.

To steal speed weed, defeat the Flash and bang Caitlin Snow I have to gather all the Jay's on all the earth's. To do this, I must prevent other complications. I must become Zoom. 


Or 


In 2016 a really fast evil speedster named Zoom conquered earth two, kicked earth one's Flash' ass and killed me while being me. I had assembled evil Meta's to hunt The Flash throughout earth-one to steal his speed. Unfortunately there's a complication now. I put a hole through my own damn chest. On earth two I may be Zoom, but the dummies on earth one will always remember me as Jay Garrick.


Or 

When I was a Garrick, my earth was experiencing peace. After a breach opened I was sent to earth one to steal Barry Allen's speed. But my metal hat got knocked off my head and by the time I got here, my brain damage was so severe that I forgot that I was actually Zoom. And so I hid my powers until recently when a complication forced me to reveal myself to the audience of WB's DC's CW's hit tv show The Flash. To most people I'm a The Flash. But in secret, I work with my Jay Garrick's for the speed weed to protect my addiction from the other speedsters and anyone else that means to cause it harm. I am Superzoom.


Or



My name is Hunter Zolomon, and I'm the fastest man alive. When I was a Jay Garrick, I saw one of my other Garrick brothers killed by something impossible. Another Garrick went to prison for his murder. Then an accident made me the impossible. To the outside world, I'm just an ordinary scientist, but secretly I use my speed to get more speed and find others like me, and one day I'll find The Flash and steal all of his speed. I am the ZOOM.

Maybe he joins the patrol because he wants to get trained by somebody and that person gave him the task to join the patrol first and gain knowledge about the universe. Or his time with the patrol could serve as a form of training. Maybe Goku will enter a dark side of the universe everyone has abandoned and he finds new and strong opponents over there to fight. Aliens that have been left alone by frieza and they left freeza alone, accepting him to rule the universe while they themselfs are actually stronger than him. But they just don't care. But now Goku opened pandora's box by actually finding them.

People keep saying Goku isn't a hero. Yeah. I know he doesn't wear a cape and goes around the city fighting crime. But he does answer to the call if he's needed. When people are being attacked he steps in. If he learns about a strong tyrant waging war somewhere he would 1. want to go and fight him because fighting is fun. 2. he would want to stop him because he is destroying innocent lives. Goku loves fighting but he also has a moral compas. People need to stop acting like he's one-dimensional. He has shown many times that he cares about saving people.

3412,"'' So you're comparing tv shows to theatrical movies? Seems fair. Why not mention BvS, Suicide Squad, or the universe DC is trying to build with the movies. ''


I'm just comparing comicbook adaptations with each other. It doesn't matter that they are movies. I'm talking about the way the plot is being set-up. Both movies and tv shows have a plot.


''Granted theyre not out yet''. You answered it yourself. 


And why would I compare the DC movies to the Marvel movies? The DCEU has just 1 movie in and I'm talking about the DC CW tv shows. Not the movies. I'm not even talking about Gotham or iZombie.


I could've also used DD and JJ. DD is a law and order type show. But gritty and really violent. While JJ is a film noir detective style show. While the DC CW shows still have lots of soap opera elements. Just watch Arrow. The Olicity dynamic is straight up soap opera'y. Even when Malcolm enters a room out of nowhere at the right time or a villain pops up dramaticly in STAR Labs reminds me a lot of soap opera's. That's badly written forced over the top drama.

Hidan is an immortal baddy who was 'impossible' to stop. Until Shikamaru fought him after Hidan killed his sensei. Shikamaru trapped him and planned to cut him up in pieces and than he burried him deep under the ground, it was impossible for Hidan  to get out of that situation.


So they could easily just defeat Savage in a fight when they team up. Cut him up in pieces and burry him somewhere or scatter his remains in space. I doubt he would be able to come back from that. ",2016-03-05 17:04:04+00:00,d0onebm,6.0,t1_d0oivfu,9033.0,arrow

Only his second in command, daughters, a few loyal fighters and a few 'business partners' should've ever seen him. 


That could've set up an infiltration arc just like on Young Justice when Aqua lad went into Black Manta's group. Have it seem like Oliver and Sara had a falling out. Let Sara rejoin the league and have her try to get close to Ra's during the whole season. That could've provided an intense and suspensefull arc for Sara. Learning more about her state of mind, the hard decisions she has to make within the league and how it reflects on her loved ones.

Have Ra's really be this incredible scary character that would make Sara and Oliver totally shit their pants. The whole team should really think that Sara turned against them while Oliver knows what she's up to.

But don't have Ra's as the main villain. Let the focus be on someone else. 


And don't do dumb Hong Kong flashbacks. Have Oliver stay on the island. Let his bread grow bigger and his hair longer. Have him meet all kinds of DC characters on that island. Make that island something that attracks interesting and dangerous people. But don't focus too much on the flashbacks. Only do flashbacks when there's a story to tell. You don't need flashbacks every episodes. By skipping more flashbacks there will be more time to develop characters like Laurel a bit better. Don't have her become BC in this season. Let her find out about Oliver, let her help the team but as her function as the DA. Hint here and there that Oliver gives her special 'self defense' training. And let Olicity slowly die away. Let Felicity and Oliver find out that they aren't suited for each other. That Oliver has demon's that Felicity can't handle (Laurel will be able to handle it a few seasons later). 

And have a villain that challenges Oliver on an intellectual level. ",2016-03-04 18:33:23+00:00,d0nmdrz,1.0,t3_48vnni,53284.0,arrow

Bring back the logic, fights and writing back from season 1 and 2. Stop pandering to Olicity fangirls. 


The show never had real world logic. Goofy stuff and unrealistic stuff always happened BUT they were believable within that world. Now it has just gotten to shit. 

Like Oliver leaving Roy behind after getting zapped by a metahuman. First of all how did Roy survive that? And they seriously just let Oliver leave him there. That was one of the moments of season 3 that had me like WTF just happened here. 
Also let Oliver stop using grappling Arrow's in thin air. He shoots them in nothingness. Or healing Oliver with tea after his deadly battle with Ra's and dropping him off a mountain? Seriously? While you could've easily written something in about the lazarus pit. Everything pointed towards the pit and you went with tea and a bit of rest. A week later he was running around in Starling City again. Telling the city how he would never leave them again... next episode: he left them. He went to the island with Thea.


Also stop with the inconsistencies. Letting a character say one thing this week and have them make a 180 an other week. It happens so much. 


Also stop with the really dumb logic. Like Oliver helping a madman like Malcolm with a bullshit reason: ''he's the father of my sister. She deserves him in her life. I don't want to take that away from her''. First of all. She hates him. Second of all he's a freaking madman!!! If you want what's good for her than protect her from him! He's insane!


The Felicity over the top soap opera bullshit drama is the worst of all things within the show nowadays. Felicity acts like a spoiled teenage brat. Nothing about her behavior towards Oliver is adult or 'strong'. Her storylines have nothing to do with the main plot. It feels like I'm watching a felicity spin off within Arrow.

Every show seems to have a geeky hacker who makes popculture references: Felicity, Cisco, Winn. 

They all have the useless love interest. Laurel (season 1) and then Felicity. Iris. Jimmy Olsen. 

They all have an antagonist that the main character knew beforehand and had an emotional connection to. Merlyn, Astra, Harrison Wells (Thawne). 

They all have a mentor or 2. Diggle/Slade, Wells/Joe, Hank (MM), Alex. 
And they all work in teams and can't get the job done on their own. Team Arrow: Speedy, BC, Overwatch, Spartan. Team Flash: Vibe, Caitlin Snow, Wells, West. Team Supergirl: Toyman Jr. Handsom Olsen, Alex and Marsian Manhunter.

They also work with secret organisations: DEO, Argus and Starr Labs secretly works with The Flash.

They all start with monologues at the beginning of an episode. 



Berlanti's production company and producers are just mass producing these shows now. Big reason why they all have the same quality issues atm. So I wouldn't just blame Guggenheim. WB and Berlanti's company are to blame. Too much shows for 1 company to produce. ",2016-03-01 22:28:33+00:00,d0jxls3,1.0,t3_48c1ck,95750.0,arrow

The show should be built more surrounding the DEO than Cat's company. I'd like it if they'd introduce more agents from the DEO onto the show. Winn has already shown that he's the best computer geek in town. So just let him quit her current job and make him an agent there. Write Jimmy out, she's quite an uninteresting character or just have him as a recurring role once in a while. And use Cat as an antagonist.

3534,"This is how my season 3 would go:

Season starts with Slade in the prison. Montage: Slade trains, meditates and plans to escape. The prison gets raided. Guards leave their post. You can hear them being slaughterd outside. Slade gets out of his cell and walks towards the door... a person walks in...... it's badass Ra's al Ghul. He's come for Slade and something on the island. Mirikuru and the lazarus pit will be connected. Mirikuru has been made with water from the pit. It will be connected and Ra's will need Slade's help. 

But this will be plot b. Ra's and Slade will be doing their thing in the backround, they will be setting stuff up for a pay-off later up in the season. While Oliver has to deal with a mysterious new villain in Star city. He'll be ruthless. A ninja like killer with no remorse. His reveal: It's tommy. He's been brought back to life by Merlyn. This will tie in with Slade's and Ra's story with the Lazarus pit. 


Tommy will be the main focus of all the villains. With Malcom at his side as his mentor. While Ra's stays a mysterious powerfull figure in the shadows who is pulling on all kinds of strings and has a master plan. And Slade turns into a second in command type of character of him, they will develop a bond but Slade will eventually turn against him and team up with Oliver. That will show how crazy intimidating Ra's is. Slade will be scared of him.


This season won't kill Sara off. She'll stay the black canary. Team Arrow: Oliver, Felicity, Diggle and Roy. Roy will get killed off by Tommy. In season 4 it will be revealed that Merlyn has taken his body and experimented on him. Enter roy with a mechanical arm. Sara won't be apart of team arrow. She'll be kinda a rogue character. Doing some anti-villain things. She'll be with the league. Oliver won't be happy about this. But it will be revealed that Sara was actually infiltrating the league. Oliver and Sara are the only ones who knew about this. Felity and Diggle really thought that Sara and Oliver had a falling out. Sara is trying to learn more about Ra's. She hasn't met him yet. He'll stay mysterious. 

So when Roy dies is when Thea finds out about Oliver. She'll blame him and she can't cope with being in Star city anymore and she'll leave. Malcom will track her down. The reveal will be made that she's his daughter and he still trains her in this season. But thea will be in a very dark place. This season will develop her more. She won't be in a hero suit yet.

Meanwhile Laurel is doing her district attorney thing. She helps Green Arrow out, not knowing he's Oliver. But she'll find out through detective work. She'll be as smart as she can in this season. She won't be black canary yet. Remember.. Sara is the black canary. Laurel will find out about team arrow, she'll keep helping them but she won't be wearing any suit during season 3. 

And Felicity will stay the comic relief character. No bullshit Olicity forced drama. She'll be the fun character that's used in small doses like in season 1. ",2016-02-27 15:04:03+00:00,d0ft772,1.0,t3_47tvm4,27715.0,arrow

Many other shows do amazing jobs with writing really strong women.   Agent Carter is a good example if I have to stick with hero shows. ",2016-02-26 17:43:05+00:00,d0esv17,2.0,t1_d0e5o31,51930.0,arrow

3576,"The real source of the problems Arrow has these past seasons: Greg Berlanti. His production company just took too much work on. They are doing Arrow, Flash, LoT and Supergirl. I predicted that the level of quality would go down drastictly but people called me a negative nancy. But just look at all these shows right now. They all suffer from the same things. Badly written characters, illogical behavior from characters and really uninteresting subplots geared towards fangirls. 


They hit a peak with Arrow season 2. That's the level of quality these shows should be. Then they started with Flash season 1. That season also was really solid. But Arrow season 3 suffered in the meantime because they relocated resources towards Flash season 1. The best writers were put on that show and Arrow was left with scraps. After that season LoT and Supergirl started. That's were the quality dropped even more because the resources are spread even more thin. I also don't enjoy Flash season 2 as much I did with Flash season 1. All because the good writers have been spread over all of these shows. Now all of these shows have inconsistent things going on and eye rolling moments. 


Arrow never was 100% realistic and season 1 and 2 also had their illogical moments. But those moments still fitted in the world they created. Now it has just become really dumb and it feels like the writers aren't trying anymore. Shows like Young Justice and Batman TAS had better writing and those were animated shows. They shit all over these live action shows. I enjoyed the DC shows more than the Marvel shows during season 2 of Arrow and season 1 of Flash but now the Marvel shows have picked up steam. AoS has been solid, just like Agent Carter. Agent Carter shows us how you write interesting love stories. They feel more realistic and adult than the Olicity over the top drama bullshit. It isn't annoying to watch Peggy and Souza's relationship unfold. DareDevil and Jessica Jones also have superior writing and overall solid quality. The DC shows are starting to feel like a parody of themselfs. I also don't get the praise LoT is getting. There are so many illogical and dumb inconsistencies happening on that show. The next episode has lots of potential with the 2046 Oliver Queen. But I've got low expectations now, It'll probably be a preticable story.

Season 2 really grew into something good. But then The Flash started and resources were started being spread. Flash season 1 became the better show.

William changed his name to Connor Hawke because he wants to break away from his past and became the new Deathstroke later on, after Slade reached out to William. Connor/William hates Diggle's son too, seeing how Oliver did raise him as his own since he was a baby when he never was there for him when he was little.

3842,"Krillin would've been dead since Tambourine killed him. Goku would've lived on without his best friend. Raditz arrives and Goku dies while stopping him. Piccolo trains Gohan. Tien, Yamcha and Chiauzu show up to fight the Saiyans. Chiauzu dies, Yamcha dies and Tien dies. Piccolo sacrifices himself to save Gohan..... this is where gohan's rage goes into overdrive. His father is dead, his mentor is dead and he couldn't do a thing about it. He saw the friends of his father die infront of his eyes and he's only got his mother and grandfather left to protect... gohan goes nuts and  goes SUPER SAIYAN! He fucks Nappa and Vegeta up. They both die and Gohan survives with crazy injuries. Gohan is the star of the show now. 


Popo won't tell Gohan about Namek because death is permanent so he doesn't need to go Namek to wish everyone back. Gohan starts to train more to honor his father and to keep in shape to protect the world if needed. He knows now that there could come more threats out of space. Gohan will enter some tenkaichi budokai's and he'll win easily. 


Meanwhile on Namek Freeza becomes immortal because he learned through Vegeta's communications about Piccolo, Namek and the Dragon Balls. He wiped Namek completly out and Gohan will never meet Dende.


But Gohan will make new friends on earth. The people he'll meet during the tournaments he participates in and also the people in school. Because of him they'll train even harder. He'll inspire them just like how Goku inspired his friends. 


A few years after Freeza's army shows up on earth. He knows Vegeta, Nappa and Raditz died there but he doesn't know about the young super saiyan. So he sends Zarbon and Doddoria with some troops to take the planet. Gohan fucks them up. After this the Ginyu force gets sent to earth. Freeza nows now that there is a super saiyan but he underestimates it. Freeza doesn't know it but he's actually making Gohan stronger. He keeps training to defeat all the threats. The Ginyu force gets destroyed. Ginyu tries to swap bodies but he'll  fail and he'll get turned into a frog instead. 

And now Freeza goes to earth and he's a bit of a challenge for Gohan but Gohan is stronger eventually. But Freeza is immortal and also no threat to Gohan anymore. Freeza wants to leave earth but Gohan won't let this happen. He captures him. Popo gives Gohan the idea to trap Freeza in the Hyperbolic timechamber. The entrance gets destoyed and freeza is stuck there. But... freeza will start training and he'll reach Golden Freeza form. But he'll have no way of escape. 
After these events Popo will reach out to Gohan to become the new Guardian. Gohan accepts and he gets even more badass. 

After this Future Bulma will come to the present timeline. There is no trunks because vegeta died ages ago. Bulma tells Gohan about the andriods. Gero still made them because he didn't know about Goku's death. After this Cell will also show up. He'll go Super Saiyan 2 against Cell without Hyperbolic training. During all the years he's been training himself he got used to the SSJ form and it became easier for him to reach SSJ2. Cell dies and after this Buu shows up ofcourse. Gohan will almost be killed by Buu but Supreme Kai saves him and elder kai will unlock his true potential. Enter Mystic Gohan: he defeats Buu.


Years after this Beerus wakes up and goes to earth to find the Saiyan God. He can't become SSJG because there aren't  5 saiyans to perform the ritual. But Gohan will manage to make a deal with Beerus, Gohan is smart give him some credit. He'll promise Beerus food or something. He'll go into training to unlock SSJG. Gohan will enter the hyperbolic timechamber for the first time. (Popo has an other way in. Popo fixes everything). He's a mystic and he kept training like crazy after the fight with Buu. He trained in Dr. Briefs' gravity machine... He'll enter the timechamber and he'll find a Golden Freeza waiting for him. The perfect sparing partner. Golden Freeza will bring Gohan to his limits and he'll Go SSJMysticBluesomethingomega saiyan. Freeza will be defeated again and now he's ready for beerus. 


There could also be an alternate way. Whis could see some potential in Gohan and he prevents Beerus from destroying Earth and trains Gohan while Beerus gets some yummy food. Whis then puts Gohan in the Hyperbolic universe and he comes across Golden Freeza as a 'sparring partner'.

Years later, my tastes changed and my love for DB was becoming everlasting so I decided to give Dragon Ball Kai a try. And I fell in love with the Japanese voice actors. I also fell in love with the 'original' translation of the story. Then I also rewatched Dragon Ball Z Kai in English and I really noticed how much Funimation evolved since the first Funi dub.

They also finally made Cap a badass within the MCU. I really couldn't care for him that much in his first movie and in The Avengers. I also wasn't that impressed with his powers. But they got his powers right in TWS. He kicked tons of ass and the action was GOOD. TWS has the best action out of all the MCU movies. No crazy shakey cam, or an insane amout of cuts. Lots of the action actually looks GOOD. That's something most mainstream blockbusters can't get right. Really impressed by how the Russo's balanced the movie. The pace was good, the action was good, the humour that it had was the right amount (looking at you AoU/Whedon) and the story actually was interesting. There actually was some depth to the story. I also enjoyed he villains of the movie. Alexander Pierce and The Winter Soldier himself. 


And James Gunn usually isn't a marketing bullsitter. So I got high hopes for this and I'm so glad The Russo's are going to directed Infinity War and the writers for TWS and Civil War will also be back for that movie. I got a bit Whedon tired after AoU.

I'd start the DB movie universe out with a movie surrounding a tournament. Introduce all the characters there and introduce the quest for the dragon balls. The second movie introduces the Saiyans and Freeza's empire. The third one will  have Cell. I'd change stuff around and save Freeza as the last villain in this movie series.

From their perspective they've built a total utopia and they don't want it to be disturbed. Their realm has peace, they fear the negativity of the living realm. Every x billions of years they reset the universe out of the fear of an other race reaching their level. 
So they insure that there is a certain balance in the universe. ",2015-12-23 12:10:06+00:00,cy8uxvw,3.0,t1_cy8p02i,21460.0,dbz
3960,"Before there were Kai's, there was an even more powerful race. Beings who've ascended to a higher plane of existence. They don't apply to the Dragon Ball rules of heaven and hell. It will be revealed that the Namekians are descendants of this race. It will also be explained that the eternal dragons are actually pets of these ascended beings. The Namekians somehow found a way to summon these pets through the mystic powers of their predecessors. 
These beings will be the antagonists of this arc. 

They will be basically worried about how strong people have become and how this is dangerous for the balance in the universe. It will be revealed that these beings reset the universe every x billion of years. Everytime they reset the universe there has been 1 thing that was constant though. And that's the Namekians. But it has never happened before that the Dragon Balls have been used that much. Together with the crazy powerfull people like Goku and the overuse of the Dragon Balls they need to step in.

This arc won't be just fighting. The series would go back a bit to its roots. It would be more adventure based with fights mixed in ofcourse. There also will be an intergalactic tournament held at the beginning of this arc. That's how the arc starts. It jumps right in. It also won't just rely on Goku to save the day. Multiple characters will be given a mission. It'll be an all out war against this race. The living realm vs. the ascended realm.

3965,"Okay, as a big Super defender I now need to say that this sucked big time. Super feels lackluster because of it's fighting choreography and fighting animation in certain episodes. The fighting choreography just sucks with characters just punching each others fists and blasting ki barages at each other. DB and DBZ used to have well thought out fights. Making use of the envirnments and there was skill shown into the fights. The story is already very thin, then at least give us some good fights. Even that's too much to ask nowadays. This episode also had very little humor. So that's also something it lacked.


I just keep saying that Super should've been more story based if they didn't have the budget for long fights. And just keep the fights short just like in Hunter X Hunter. Have an adventure so you don't have to rely on the power of all the characters. Have them go through the different universes to find the super dragon balls or something. Make it more storydriven. Have fights but don't make them too long. The longest fight could be 1 episode long. But just make them short so you can spend your budget more wisely.

1. Kilgrave (Very scary, well written, not a stereotype baddy).
2. Kingpin (You could say the same for Kingpin).
3. Eobard Thawne (Cavanagh did a great job playing 2 characters in 1).
4. Damian Darhk (Intimidating, yet very fun. I just find him really mysterious atm).
5. Malcolm Merlyn (John Barrowman has just so much fun playing him. Twisted and resourceful).
6. Slade Wilson (Manu Bennet can do no wrong. Crixus, the champion of Capua is just too epic).
7. Grant Ward (AoS has built him into something very special. His character arc is impressive). 
8. Captain Cold (Again a villain that's played by an actor that has so much fun with it. Intelligent villain, and just fun).
9. Calvin Zabo (Same could go for with this guy).
10. Zoom (Lots of potential, 1 good moment so far. He could become the arrow season 3 Ra's al Ghul. I just have to wait and see). 

Honorable mentions: 
Trickster (Just love how much Joker he's got in him. I want to see more of him!!) 
Lash, Dr. Ivchenko and John Garret. 

No Ra's al Ghul btw, he was really wasted in Arrow season 3. He had one great moment: stabbing Oliver and throwing him of the mountain. But that doesn't make up for how badly written he was.

I just think that Van Gaal found a too big shit show left behind by Moyes. The final years of Sir Alex also weren't built towards the future. United had a rule against buying players of 27+ but RVP was a exception. While other players like Ferdinand and Scholes were reaching their final days. Moyes had to rebuild, he failed with that and Van Gaal had to take over that failure. It takes time to rebuild. But at a club like United you don't have the time. 

The football Van Gaal wants to play can be effective. It can tire the opponent like crazy and his team can dominate. The Football culture in England is just different. In the PL people want to see running players and individual actions while most Dutch managers nowadays are more set on dominating the game, making the opponent tired and playing a possesion game.
I'm more a fan of dynamic football with a lot of movement. But United knew what they were bringing in with Van Gaal. A coach that builds a team and plays in a specific way. If you wanted a coach that would play the United way, then get a coach that plays that way.

- Vegeta wanted a challenge. Goku too. They even told  Bulma not to go searching for the Dragon Balls because they wanted to fight the andriods themselfs. It's the Saiyan fighting spirit. It makes sense for them

Letting him get away when they had him cornered. 

- They didn't just let him get away. He used a distraction by attacking them while Bulma took all of their attention away while flying in. 


Krillin not shutting off android 18 when he had the chance cause she kissed him. 

- The andriods of his timeline didn't kill anyone yet. So why would Krillin take 18 out? He didn't just like her because of the kiss. He just fell instantly in love with her. But that wasn't the only reason for him to not destroy her. Like I said, she hadn't done anything really terrible. She didn't kill anyone or caused worldwide panic. So why would he kill her off? 


Vegeta letting cell reach his perfect form.

- Vegeta letting Cell reach his perfect form also made sense. Vegeta was cocky, arrogant, had a big ego. Mix that with his saiyan fighting spirit and pride. He wanted a challenge. Just beating Cell around wasn't enough for him. He wanted Cell at his best. Vegeta also wasn't just fighting Cell to save the world. Vegeta couldn't care less about the world. He was just fighting Cell because he wanted a challenge. Just like how he didn't want Bulma to find the dragonballs to prevent the andriods from being activated. (what Goku also didn't want to happen).

Example of something stupid in season 3: The way Oliver kept returning and leaving and every time saying he would stay for good. And at the end of the season he left again.

Making them shorter could also mean a bigger animation quality and better fights. Hunter X Hunter 2011 perfected the shonen formula imo. Each arc is different and it's story driven. There are great fights but they don't go on for too long. Anime like HxH were inspired a lot by DBZ. They took the DB shonen formula and they built upon that.

I agree with the first Supergirl trailer being terrible but hate on the show itself is too much. The Supergirl pilot episode is on par with the Arrow and The Flash pilot episodes. They are all made by the same production company of Greg Berlanti. The same producers are behind then and even the same writers. You can clearly see plotpoints from the Flash and Arrow pilots within the Supergirl pilot. Both shows also began mediocre but they grew out being entertaining.

It should be a cast with a good mix. A mix with unkown/upcoming actors and some well known actors. It should also be a diverse cast. With actors from different diversities. Seeing how the earth in Dragon Ball has no countries and is 1 cohesive society. A mix of white, black, 'middle-eastern', asian, african actors.

Make the Saiyans white. Mix the humans up. Krillin is a monk so he should be Asian, make Yamcha 'middle eastern', make  Tien mixed, halve white and halve asian. Let Piccolo be played by a black actor. I just keep seeing Djimon Hounsou as Piccolo. That would be perfect casting imo. Or the actor playing him should at least be a type like that. 

The Saiyans are aliens so I always don't get why lots of fans want Goku to be played by an Asian actor. That isn't necasary. The DB characters all have ambiguous backrounds because of how the dragon world is set-up. You see black, white, asian, middle eastern, etc. all mixed on the streets.

Funimation became a lot better along the years and they redid the dub once or twice and they also recorded a new dub for ZKai. The Funi Zkai dub is by far the best English dub. It has the best performances and every VA is on his/her a-game.


But I also got to learn to love the Japanese dub. I loved the faulconer music back in the day but I figured out why I hated Hercule and Boo so much. It's because of the music. The faullconer music keeps going and has no pauzes. It goes from epic cell music to goofy hercule music in an instant. It just sounds  disracting. The music never shuts up. Everything has a sound effect. The Japanese dub has a much more subtle ost and the silent moments are great for tension building. THe Japanese dub also has a more western feeling to it. It suits the standoffs way better than the faulconer music. I still love a lot of the faulconer music. There are soundtracks that are amazing and nostalgic to me.

The thought behind the Z was that it was meant to be the ending to the series. But the series kept going on. Sources say that Toriyama (or he said it himself, I don't know for sure) wanted to stop the manga after the Freeza arc. But the manga kept going because it was populair.

4511,"I was arround 10 years old and kids at school and on the street were all talking about this new cartoon. It was called Dragon Ball Z and it was supposed to be awesome. I ignored all the hype up until the moment I really became curious. Litterally everyone that was playing outside went inside to watch it and I decided to give it a try.


The first scene I saw was young Gohan in training on his own. He hit a giant boulder and he kept walking. When he walked away it broke off into many pieces. As a little kid I was like WOW that's amazing! Go much powerrrrr! From that moment on I was hooked.


I kept thinking Yamcha was Goku and Goku was Yamcha. I didn't get all the Goku hype at first. Why are they waiting for this Goku guy? Is he really that incredible? To me it was a cartoon about Gohan up until Goku arrived from Other World. Then everything got flipped upside down and I  loved it. 


When I came home from school or when I was playing outside I would rush home to watch an episode. It was amazing following the battles for weeks and weeks. You could go insane if they would air an rerun or if the dub suddenly changed. I was like HUH? Why are the voices suddenly so different. They changed the Ocean Dub to the Funimation DUb and during the Andriod arc they went back for a bit to the Ocean Dub. 

The biggest hype for me was during the Namek arc. I just loved how Vegeta was handeling things on Namek and how Goku became the legendary Super Saiyan. Trunks showing up was also a WTF moment. Especially when he turned Super Saiyan and killed Freeza with ease. Cell absorbing people also was disturbing and mindblowing. ",2015-08-23 16:25:07+00:00,cucwptw,1.0,t3_3i3a38,1086.0,dbz

It is something iconic that stands the test of time because of the core themes of the show and the over te top action is just fun to watch. The way the powers are used is inventive as fuck.

So I'd rather would want to see different  Japanese manga about the Dragon Ball universe like Jaco. Then they could also make anime out of that. It should stay a Japanese thing. But the movies should go to a studio like Marvel (what most likely won't ever happen) but that's the only studio I would trust right now to make a Dragon Ball live action movie. Fox currently has the rights and they just generally suck with comicbook adaptations. They've made so much bad comicbook movies in the past like DareDevil. And they still don't have the hang of it like with Fant Four Stic. 

The only good Fox comicbook adaptations are made by Bryan Singer. Directed or produced. All the other ones are mediocre or just bad. Fox has issues.

While the Bruce music is a bit over the top for today's standards. There's a weird pacing to the music. There are no silent moments and goofy soundtracks go into epic soundtracks in an instant. It's really annoying during the cell and buu saga. Going from goofy Mr. Satan too serious Cell music in an instant. I think that's one of the reasons I disliked Mr. Satan at first.

It's like saying how Naruto or Ichigo shouldn't be the main focus in their manga/anime but secondary characters should save the day. And I just don't get how you could call Gohan a pussy. So somebody who is trying to educate himself is a pussy? He's still one of the strongest people in the universe. Why does everything have to be about fighting of these fans? Why can't characters have other things to do?Just like how people are hating on Super because they spend time on building the characters in different aspects than just fighting. And Gohan also is a different character to Goku. Goku LOVES fighting. Gohan DOESN'T. Freaking accept that. Not every character is the same.

The reaction about the animation in episode 5 of Super is also really over the top and annoying. 1 episode of bad animation and people are freaking losing their minds. There have been tons of anime with an episode or two with  bad animation but it then picked up. And if the animation stays that way, then I'll understand if people have a problem with it. 

There are also people who try to bring TFS logic to DBZ. Some of them even only know DBZ through TFS and have no idea what they are talking about if it's about DBZ. 

And I also get really annoyed at people who try to make perfect sense of DBZ. DBZ never made sense and that also made it fun. People are nitpicking a lot when it's about DBZ and DBZ is a typical show you just can't nitpick. Just accept that it doesn't make any sense and that there are inconsistencies. Because it has always been like that. 

There are still many other things that annoy me but I'll save that for now.

Not much is known about him and he's super mysterious. We get his motivations but we still know very little about him and the scope of his power.


Being one of the first, or first villain introduced to the series also sets him up as a sort of arch nemisses for Gon. Gon taking away his number patch and returning it to him in the Heavens Arena arc was an amazing pay off. 

But I also wouldn't call him a straight up villain because he has also worked with Gon. Maybe for selfish reasons. He is a really ambiguous character that just keeps it really interesting. You just don't know what he's going to do next. I wouldn't call him a straight up villain but he's for sure an antagonist that also does villainous stuff. He's a really complex character and I like that about the character. 


Meruem had an incredible arc and character development but there's just something about Hisoka that keeps it really interesting. Meruem's arc was done and there wasn't any other way to handle his character except killing him off. His story was just done. With Hisoka there's just still too much story to tell because he's so mysterious. That makes him  the most interesting villain of this manga/anime.

They should've taken a comicbook Apocalypse look and make it more fitting for the big screen. Lose the big A, make him bald and have the stripes going from his mouth. That can be make up. And give him a suit inspired  by ancient Egypt but with a modern flavor to it. The movie takes places in the 80s but Apocalyps has always been ahead of his time. He should look out of place.

Fox and Singer just lack vision. Just look what Marvel Studios does with suits for characters like Thor. You would think Thor could look goofy on the big screen but he looks amazing in the movies.

Red Skull should've made a comeback in The Winter Soldier instead of Zola. Alexandre Pierce should've been Red Skull using that face changer thing to hide his face. 


The Mandarin was handled poorly. He was set up into being a great threat but he was turned into a joke. The same happend with Ultron. ULtron would've been a great villain if he was a threatening robot instead a more human robot. Vision should've been his contrast. More humans and life like. While Ultron should've been more logical. 

Ronan should've also been fleshed out more. They should've cut Thanos out of GoTG and give Ronan more development. They should've made his story more personal. He should've lost someone he loved because of the nova corps. And that should've motivated him to take on the nova corps. From his point of view he should have been thinking he was doing the right thing. Thanos should've been just a reference through Nebula and Gamorra. They should've talked about him and referenced his power. 


Obediah from IM1 also should've stayed alive. He should've gone to jail and Tony should've visited him in prison in IM2. IM2 should've skipped the whiplash storyline and should've just focussed on Justin Hammer and linked his story through Obediah. 


Malekith was just meh all the way through. I have no idea how he would've been more interesting. He probably is one of the most bland Marvel villains in the movies. Maybe they should've introduced enchantress in  that movie and linked it with Loki's capturing storyline. They could've made enchantres the first great female MCU villain.

4780,"Summary:
My story would be set in 3 different places. 1. the main storyline would be about Vegeta vs. the remnants of Freeza's empire. 2. Goku's side story while training on Yardrat and learning the instant transmission. 3. everyday life of the z fighters, adapting to peaceful times. Until the shit hits the fan again with Vegeta's battle coming to earth (but the z fighters never meet up with vegeta. They will feel him fighting on earth but they willl be occupied with henchmen of the villain vegeta is fighting). So storyline 1 and 3 will be connected that way and Goku will stay as a sidestory with a bit of connection of the main plot. Because Goku will meet with an elder on Yardrat and that elder will tell him an important stoy that connects to what Vegeta is going through with the remnants of Freeza's empire.


The story:
The battle with Freeza is over and the dead Z fighters are being wished back. Goku refuses to come back because of 'important training'. Vegeta's gets mad and leaves earth. For the rest of the z fighters everday normal life returns. 


Then the story continues with a pissed off Vegeta in his space ship. He's having a classic Vegeta inner monologue about how he has to push himself to his limits. He then sets course to a remote Freeza planet.
Meanwhile Goku is on Yardrat going through some unsual training and Goku is wondering what benefit it will have. Their food is also unsual but he likes it in a classic Goku style. The people on Yardrat are even amazed he can eat some stuff they find even hard to swallow.
Back on earth Gohan is being harrased by his mother into studying. Krillin is trying the dating game but he has no luck. Every girl he comes across thinks he's a pervert. Tien and Chiautzu are training deep in the mountains. Yamcha is failing in life but he stops a robbery, but afterwards  Bulma is mad at him because of missing their date (the first cracks of their break up lol).


There is a powerstruggle going on in Freeza's empire. The squad next in line to the ginyu force tried to take over but a mysterious person took them out. It's freeza's brother Cooler. Cooler has always been looked down upon by freeza. He's weaker than freeza but a lot to handle for Vegeta. This is the big baddy Vegeta will have to handle during this arc. Cooler will eventually go for the dragon balls on earth and vegeta will try to stop him. And this will show how Vegeta became Super Saiyan. He will go through a rollercoaster of emotions and his past will come up. Some flashbacks will be involved. Vegeta will push himself because of Goku being better than him. Goku will learn about planet Vegeta too because of that Yardrat elder. 


When Cooler is fighting Vegeta Goku will sense that and urge his trainers to hurry up with the instant transmission because his space ship is still broken. But in the end vegeta will handle everything and leave earth again.

While Vegeta is fighting on earth Coolers own ginyu force type squad will take on Piccolo, Tien, Krillin, Yamcha and Gohan. Each of them will shine in their battles. Piccolo will be his old badass self and take his opponent out himself. Tien will do the same. Krillin and Yamcha will team-up.  Gohan will be overclassed but his rage will come out and fuck people up. 


Throughout other stuff will happen ofcourse. We will learn more about Freeza's empire. About Vegeta and Yardrat. It will also give us some slice of life moments on earth during a bit of peace. Launch would also make a return.

4852,"DB, DB Kai, Yo Goku and his friends return, Battle of Gods, Resurection F and now DB Super are all canon.


Akira Toriyama wrote the Dragon Ball manga. That was adapted into the Dragon Ball anime and the Dragon Ball Z anime. Akira Toriyama never called his series Dragon Ball Z after Raditz arrived. It was still Dragon Ball. After this Toei made Dragon Ball GT without Toriyama. Toriyama only drew some characters. But to him the GT storyline isn't canon. Just like with Cooler. He drew Cooler but he didn't write him. To him Freeza doesn't have Cooler as a brother. 


A few years ago he wrote the special Yo Goku and his friends return. In this special Vegeta's younger brother Tarble was introduced and 2 villains who came to earth, Abo and Cado who merged together. This special is canon because Toriyama has written it AND the character Bulma has mentioned Tarble in the Battle of Gods movie that took place after the Boo saga. Now Resurection F is the sequel to that movie that takes place after that. 


DB Super also takes place after the Boo saga but before BoG and RoF. Those 2 movies will most likely be recapped or told from a different perspective than the movies within the series while progressing the storyline.


An other special was released a while ago called Episode of Bardock that featured Bardock going back in time and turning into a Super Saiyan isn't canon. It wasn't written by Akira Toriyama. So it isn't apart of his DB universe. 


Turles, Lord Slug, Cooler, Janemba, Garlic Jr, Super Andriod 13, Bojack,  Broly, Gogeta and the Dragon Fist all aren't canon. Those movies were made without Toriyama.  The Garlic Jr arc in DBZ and Prinses Snake were also filler and not canon. Just like the Ginyu Force showing up at King Kai's place and fighting Yamcha, Piccolo, Chiautzu and Tien and General Tao showing up again.

4869,I don't think it's possible to keep something like that a suprise. Something would've leaked. If he was just a day on a closed set it could be pulled off. But if he's there for a longer period of filming it's almost impossible to keep it a secret. ,2015-06-25 02:55:45+00:00,cshu9ed,2.0,t1_cshedbv,26922.0,movies
4870,"He's still on hiatus right? I also love HxH a lot. I would just love to see his take on DBZ. He took a lot of inspiration for his work from DBZ. HxH is basicly DB but with a deeper storyline and characters and a more variety of powers. 


In my ideal dream Toghasi writes DB Super and makes it a bit more story driven. The epic fights stay and characters like TIen and Krillin get more to do.

The English dub also is nice: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0xvYlZM49Q


This rap opening is just horrible (and I like hip hop, this is just horrible): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XR46WbmYFyQ This one was mainly aired lmao.

I only cared for Assasins Creed 1 and 2. When they started making AC games with subtitels like :Brotherhood I stopped caring and I knew  it was way too fast for that game to come out. Now they are bringing them out every year. ",2015-06-23 13:43:08+00:00,csfv9x6,1.0,t3_3ati10,7981.0,gaming
