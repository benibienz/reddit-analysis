Humans in that world don't react like the humans in this world. That world isn't set in reality like the superhero shows and movies of today. Those shows and movies want to make you believe that those heroes could be real people and that those events could happen in the real world. Tony Stark flies around real world LA, lives in real world Malibu, Luke Cage is active in real world Harlem.. Meanwhile the DC movies are trying to be in a gritty realistic world. DB takes places on earth, but it's nothing like our world. You got flying cars, dino's, different continents, a dog world king. The people also don't react like normal people. They are more like gag characters. They witness the most incredible things in tournaments and they forget about them a few years later. It isn't logical, but it is funny. It's intended to be like that because Toriyama is a gag writer. DB has no intention to follow real life logic. It's a world of it's own with it's own logic. So people are a bit too harsh on DB imo. I can accept Goku forgetting a seal or him biting Buu midbattle during a fight for the universe. These aren't intended to be real people. With all the 'realism' based entertainment people tend to forget that some things just aren't meant to be taken so seriously. This is a part of DB's beauty imo. 

Another thing why people are too harsh on DB. Just watch the DCTV shows. Many of them intended to be based in realistic worlds. Meanwhile you got 30+ year old super scientist genius Ray Palmer doing the dumbest things possible. In that regard DB is written much better imo. DB even handles aspects like time travel much better. Ever seen the convoluted way of how they handle time travel on LoT and Flash? Toriyama had a much better grasp on it imo. Toriyama's approach was simple but it also allowed for a bit of complexity with the different timelines.


The Dragon Ball franchise gets much shit, but I think many of it isn't justified. I'm not saying there aren't moments of bad writing, I'm saying that people overreact about them and most of the time it fits within the universe. 


Meanwhile Barry Allen gives his speedforce to Zoom while he's faster than Zoom and Zoom has no leverage anymore because he let his hostage go. At least Vegeta let Cell get stronger because he was too pridefull. It was a character flaw, not bad writing. Vegeta wanted it. Barry Allen just said fuck it. We need more episodes of Zoom in it.

It could also be a way to bring Cold back. Have Eobard get a version of Cold before he joined the Legends. Have him also been in the legion. However he betrays them along the way and rejoins the Legends.

I could see Eobard, Darhk and Merlyn getting along. While Darhk and Ra's hate each other. That dynamic could create tension. If it's a version of Ra's that hasn't met Merlyn hate he wouldn't have a reason wanting to kill Merlyn. Meanwhile Cold is the one that's always standing on the side, leaning against a wall and calling them all idiots. He would be their tactician. Eobard is the brains. Merlyn has the contacts.

Maybe he could be brought back through Malcolm screwing around with Eobard and the timeline. Or we could finally get a reveal about what Malcolm is carrying around his neck. Maybe it had some sort of Lazarus Pit fluid in it that took it's time to revive Tommy. Or Merlyn doesn't know Tommy is alive and someone entirely different brought him back to life. I would love it if they changed the formula of this season. Reveal who Prometheus really is during the midseason finale and introduce the person who's behind his resurection in the second half of the season and have that person be the biggest villain of the season with Prometheus as his soldier. They could also do a storyline where they have a falling out. Maybe Prometheus even teams up with Oliver to take the big baddy out and after that they are enemies again. I'd Digg(le) that.

[This one] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzFqVqv-DJg) was used during the Beerus v. Goku fight in the BoG movie. I think it's a nice fight theme. Maybe it would play well during a sparring session or a training scene. Or during a moment where a protagonist has the upper hand. I could totally hear it during a tournament fight. At the beginning Gohan powers up and the group realizes he is back at a strong level. The opponent attacks and Gohan is having fun with it. He's dogging and not lifting a finger. At the end of the track he deflects a big ki blast and the fight scene ends. 

[This] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMYebVBnLoA) sounds the same like the first one but it's more slower. Maybe it would fit when Vegito finally defeats Zamasu. He's giving a monologue or something and is caring out the final attack.

This is just an innocent fan story idea. Something I think would've been cool after Cell. This replaces Buu, or adds a whole different spin on it. I don't know if I will do a part II. These are just ideas in my dumb head. It isn't even written very well, I know. I was just bored and thought it was fun. 



7 years have past since Cell's defeat and Son-Goku's death. The Earth is peacefull yet again and everyone has gone back to  normal lifes, relatively speaking ofcourse. Krillin has a kid with 18, Bulma and Vegeta's bond has become a bit stronger, Kid Trunks is a bit older now, Tien is still training somewhere in the mountains, Piccolo is standing in corners with his eyes closed, Yamcha has given up martial arts and Mr. Satan is being seen at the world greatest hopeful figure. He defeated Cell afterall. This day is Mr. Satan day. Everyone in the world is celebrating it. It's a big party and Mr. Satan is being honoured.


After the narration about how peace is returned and a scene with Mr. Satan being praised and seen as a hero + the introduction of Mr. Satan day we see Chi Chi at home looking for someone. This certain someone is Goten. It is revealed that Chi Chi had an other kid after Goku passed away. She is looking for Goten because they are late. They are heading off to a gathering with all the Z-fighters and their loved ones. This will be the first time they will see Goten. It will be a throwback to the time they met Gohan. When Chi Chi arrives Piccolo asks where Gohan is. And now we cut to Gohan.


He is busy studying at school. He's trying to adapt to normal life and he is having trouble with it. It seems like trouble is following everywhere he goes and he also steps in and helps people. He does that by going SSJ and using his super speed, so that nobody can see him. Gohan is already a few weeks at school and he already met Videl and he made some friends at school. We'll get to meet them during the first episode of this arc. A quick introduction to learn how their personalities are and we quickly learn that Videl is a ballbuster just like his mom. She's a strong and though chick and it's revealed that she's Mr. Satan's daughter, but she's ashamed about it and she hides it. Especially during Mr. Satan day. She's embarred by his behavior and how people are worshipping him. 
Meanwhile Gohan gets interupted by having to save people again. Videl follows him because she senses there's something off with him. She discovers he's the rumored hero and she confronts him with it. She'll inspire Gohan to wear a disguise if he doesn't want to be seen. 


Meanwhile Chi Chi and the rest are still waiting on Gohan. Chi Chi is afraid he won't come at all. It will be revealed why she's thinking this. She tells Bulma he hasn't been himself all week and she's afraid there's something wrong with him.

After Videl finding out Gohan's secret Gohan will find out about Videls. How Mr. Satan is her dad. Gohan tells her she shouldn't be ashamed of him and that she should be happy about still having her father because he can clearly see he loves her. Even if he's a total faker. Videl asks about Gohan's dad and this is where Gohan turns sad. This is going to be the big reveal of the premier episode that will give you the feels. Gohan will tell Videl that his dad died exactly 7 years ago and  that on this day his family and friends are honour him (the gathering), but he's too afraid to acknowledge it and this is also a reason why he still hasn't gone to the gathering. This is why Chi Chi was sensing there was something wrong with Gohan the whole week. He was dreading the aniversary of this fathers death. His fathers death on Mr. Satan day.  Videl says something to Gohan to inspire him. (He is still wearing the Saiyaman costume btw and he just knocked a thief out). Gohan gets motivated by this and wants to celebrate his fathers life. He realizes his father made a sacrifice to give him a chance to live. Gohan heads to the gathering in his Saiyaman outfit. Gohan calls himself Great Saiyaman btw to honour his father. He came up with the name after the talk with Videl. Goku was a great Saiyan man afterall (wink wink). 


The premier episode ends with some feels and hope for the future. Krillin will say something about Trunks and hope. How Trunks is the hope for his world and how Gohan is the hope of theirs. (This will be epic forshadowing for the coming arc). This first episode will show some struggle of Gohan's daily life, some comedy with the thiefs and Great Saiyaman's introduction and also a lot of freaking feels. 


After this first episode the arc will slowly develop into something different. After this episode a gangster group will be introduced. They will be a fun throwback to the Red Ribbon Army. Let's call them the Orange Star Crooks. The RRA members had colours and the OSC's will have numbers. Orange Star tattoos on their bodies with numbers in it. These numbers represent their importance within the group. They also won't have names but they'll call each other by their numbers. They will basically serve as comic relief while also doing some nasty stuff. Towards normal humans they are a huge threat, but Gohan will take them on with ease and defeat them very fast. They will only be there for 1 episode. Gohan will go through them with ease and this will get the attention of the public. Great Saiyaman will start to get some love. Some people are even starting to compare him with Mr. Satan. 


The presence of the Orange Star Crooks will however set something very important in motion. Gohan stopped them from stealing an ancient artifact linked to the past of the Dragon Balls but while doing this the artifact gets broken. This will cause to signal the big baddy of the arc off. This big baddy is a Makaioshin! The Makaioshin basically are the demon version of Kai's and they rule over the Demon Realm at the outer reaches of the universe.  


A whole new part of the DB universe will be introduced in this arc and it will slowly become more serious. The artifact signals the Makaioshin off, he realizes the signal comes from earth. Earth wasn't on his radar at all but now his plans will be set in motion. Finally no boredom for him anymore! This baddy has ambition and it will be revealed what that ambition is. This reveal will come slowly in during this arc. There will be a nice build-up. Gohan deals with the past and learns to deal with his new life, he makes friends, finds inner peace, there is comedy and he fights crime, we get cool action moments and also heartfelt moments. A bit of slice of life and also learning more about Gohan's will to be a hero. Goku loved to fight, but Gohan actually wants to save people. Cell thought him that. After settling in the baddy appears and the shit hits the fan, in a great DB fashion.


The demon realm will be explored a bit. We will also learn more about the Makaioshin. He feeds of the evil in peoples hearts. If there's lots of evil in a world he gets stronger. He sees the earth as a great playground because there's a lot of evil in the world. So he feeds off it and he becomes a strong opponent for Gohan. This is how his strenght will be explained. 
This Makaioshin will have a plan for earth. He wants to take the hope away from the people, this will give him even more power to reach his real goal. He wants to be the supreme, grand, ultra, CEO Makaioshin. He has enough of the status quo, he's bored with it and his aim is to wipe all the Kai's out. It's time for his 'rightful' place on his throne. His vision will be realized. So fucking the earth over, taking their hope away by taking down a figure that gives them the most hope (great saiyaman) will help him to achieve his goals. Mr. Satan will be caught in his crossfires. He's the one that defeated Cell afterall. The biggest hero on earth. Gohan will have to step in and save him. Videl will have a role in this arc too. During the more peacefull episode at the beginning of the arc she'll get training from Gohan. Ki will be explained like in the Buu arc.
Videl will get an opponent on her level and she'll get to shine a bit. The Makaioshin won't come alone. He'll have a group of servants. These servants will be the opponents of the other Z-fighters. 


So the Makaioshin arrives on earth. He gathers the artifact first and he gives a piece of it to his servants. It was broken when the Orange Star Crooks tried to steal it. It will be later on revealed what the importance of this is. The Makaioshin is happy he is on earth. So much hate everywhere. He launches an attack. This attack will signal the Z-fighters off. They sense such a terrible Ki. It's something they never felt before. It feels even more sinister than Freeza. 


The closest one to the attack is Piccolo. The Makaioshin stands in the backround and all the servants attack at once. Piccolo has a very difficult time but the Makaioshin sees how skilled Piccolo is. He also senses the evil deep inside of Piccolo. There's very little of it left. He can also sense the ki of a kami. He finds Piccolo interesting and orders his men to stand down. Don't kill him he says. Piccolo was holding his own but they are teaming up on him like crazy and they knock him out. Before knocking him out The Makaioshin tells Piccolo he should be happy because he just met a real demon king. Piccolo is shocked by this. How does this person know about the King Piccolo calling himself a demon king thing... The Makaioshin smirks and one of his men knocks Piccolo out.


Meanwhile Gohan is flying towards the fight and he encounters Vegeta midair. He hasn't seen him since the fight with Cell. Vegeta asks if he has kept up with his training. Gohan tells him ashamed that he hasn't. Vegeta is pissed. 
Krillin, Tien and 18 also join them midair and they fly together. 


They reach the battle ground and find Piccolo on the ground. Gohan fears the worst, but Krillin tells him he still senses his ki. Piccolo gets up  and he tells them what happened. He explains about the Demon Realm. This will also fix some consistency. We'll get an explanation on how King Piccolo was a demon king. King Piccolo encountered a makaioshin ages ago and he took that name from him to put fear into people. Kami also knows a bit about the demon realm and Piccolo explains how dangerous this opponent is. Vegeta's pride suddenly kicks in and he tells the Z-fighters to go home. He'll handle this and he flies away. His inner monologue also kicks in and he tells himself how he's going to step out of Kakarot's shadow. He will kill the makaioshin and word of that will travel all over the universe and also the other world. Vegeta will take whatever the Makioshin wants for himself and he'll destroy it or he will do whatever he pleases, because he's royalty afterall. It's time for people to respect him again. 



Gohan tells Goten and Trunks to fly Piccolo to the lookout to let Dende heal him. Goten and Trunks also flew to the battlefield btw. Gohan tells them it's too dangerous for them so he puts them on medic duty. They fly off with Piccolo. Gohan, Krillin and 18 follow Vegeta. 


Meanwhile The Makaioshin is amazed by the earth. He wants to learn more about the people. He heads into a village and he starts getting looks from people. He observes the people and he sees they are afraid of him. It's a family, a farmer, his wife and their kid. He Meruem's the kid's head off to see how the parents will react. He'll let them live to feed of their grief and fear for him. He punishes them in the most horrible way possible. Even Vegeta is shocked when he arrives and sees what just happened. 


Makaioshin is suddenly alarmed. He feels a lot of evil within Vegeta. Even more than in Piccolo. This is where something similar happens like during the Majin Vegeta thing. Makaioshin will grant Vegeta more power if he joins him. Vegeta will do this and turn against Gohan, Krillin and 18. They arrive and they all fight side by side against the servants. Suddenly Vegeta turns against them, a big suprise for them!


A few servants die btw. 2 survive. There are 3 of them with Vegeta now. Gohan is shocked that Vegeta could do such a thing. Betraying them like that. What about his Saiyan pride Gohan asks? 18 gets killed during this fight and Krillin goes nuts. Krillin gets hurt badly and gets knocked out. Gohan also has lots of injuries and is almost going to fall. BUT THEN. A mysterious force steps in. He flashes onto the battlefield. He counters the finishing ki blast that 1 of the servants fires off towards Gohan and bounces it back. This servant is the strongest servant. His power is on par with Perfect Cell... showing how Gohan's power didn't increase and even got a bit lower because of the lack of training. Vegeta sees Gohan as a weakling. But this mysterious figure bounces it back. Grabs Gohan and Krillin and he teleports away. The Makaioshin reacts really suprised because he saw who the mysterious figure was. 


This mysterious figure brings Gohan and Krillin to safety. It's revealed that the mysterious figure has partner. It's Supreme Kai and Kibito!


This arc will not only introduce the demon realm but also the Supreme Kai's! Yes, Kai's! There are 5 of them and all alive. Kaioshin is the youngest of them and he defied orders by coming to earth. He had to step in and he did. He however doesn't want to interfere too much because it can set the balance of things way off. It's already bad that Makaioshin is stepping out of his boundaries. Kaioshin however couldn't just sit back. He had to do at least something.


Kibito heals Gohan and Krillin up. Shin and Kibito explain to them what is happening. Gohan also tells Krillin that they will get revenge for 18 and that they will use the dragon balls to get her back and everyone that they lost today. Krillin is still in grief. He saw the  woman he loves being wiped away. He got into rage Krillin mode like after Yamcha's death and he killed 1 strong ass servant. 


So Gohan is wondering how Supreme Kai is going to help them if he can't fight Makaioshin himself. Supreme Kai tells him he's going to train him. They take Gohan with them to the world of the Kai's. 


Meanwhile on earth it will be revealed that Vegeta actually has a plan. Makaioshin gave Vegeta a way to become even stronger and when the time is right Vegeta will strike. He wants to learn about Makaioshin more first. Vegeta is calculating and being tactical again like on Namek. He actually hasn't turned fully evil again. He's doing this to infiltrate the enemy and the evil he still had in his heart is a great cover. Makaioshin doesn't expect Vegeta's rebellion because of that. All of his servants have the same evil in their hearts. That's how he controls them. He didn't realize Vegeta's mind was too powerful to control. 

Piccolo is all healed up and he realizes what Vegeta is doing. He explains this to Krillin. Krillin was really pissed at Vegeta but now there is some more hope. Trunks' and Goten's next mission will be given to them by Piccolo. They will need the Dragon Balls soon and they will have to collect them. However, the Makaioshin will learn about the earth's dragon balls and he will go after them too. This will cause Vegeta to stand opposite Trunks. The Makaioshin will give a kill order and Vegeta won't do it ofcourse. Vegeta's plan will fail right here. He'll have to confront the Makaioshin. Vegeta gets his ass handed to him and almost beaten to death. Trunks and Goten save him by causing a diversion. But Makaioshin will let them go because he has the Dragon Balls now.


Dende won't be able to heal Vegeta. Because of what Makaioshin did to Vegeta Dende's magic doesn't work on him anymore. So Vegeta will wait for his body to heal, the Senzu's are all out. Yajirobe ate them all again. 


Meanwhile Gohan is having a though time on the planet of the kai's. The other kai's found out he is on their planet. Gohan however amazes them with his power and they sense something in him. A potential of becoming a kai. Gohan tells them he doesn't want that job, he just wants to save his home. He also schools them about being so powerful and not stepping in to save people. 


Meanwhile back on earth Makaioshin is going to make a wish. He's going to bring someone back. Someone that was lost ages ago. He first wishes for the artifact to be fixed. His second wish is to return the artifact to it's original state. The Dragon Balls scatter over the earth again. Makaioshin will now release Majin Buu. Not Mr. Fat Majin Buu. But a more menacing one. Like the one that was formed after evil buu transformed. He will be  a mindless monster. It will fit much better in this setting because Makaioshin will keep control over him and he's the man with the plan. Buu won't be stronger than Makaioshin, there's one thing that Buu can do what Makaioshin can't. KILL ALL THE KAI'S. There's a universal rule that Makaioshin and Kai's can't kill eachother. Buu was a loophole created ages ago. A force of nature that goes against everything that nature stands for. The artifact was always a way for makaioshin to get rid of the Kai's.

So Vegeta's is almost dying on the lookout. Kid Trunks is handling Vegeta's darkness. Goten is wondering about his father because of Krillin reminding them about him. Krillin is still in grief and in anger. Piccolo feels hopeless and is thinking about how Gohan is their last hope. Bulma is arriving at the lookout and reveals that she has been working on a stasis pod. She gets it out of a capsule and puts Vegeta in it. It will keep Vegeta at least alive. He won't heal anytime soon. 


Meanwhile on the planet of the Kai's. Gohan is getting training. The Kai's have okay'd it after seeing Gohan's resolve and his speech about them doing nothing. They finally are going to do something. They will tell Gohan a way to stop Makaioshin, seeing how they themselves can't kill him. They know a weakness. 


At this moment Majin Buu gets set loose by Makaioshin and he appears on the planet of the kai's. He kills them all! Only Gohan and Supreme Kai survive. Even Kibito gets killed. Gohan gets pissed and he unleashes his new powers. Buu gets beaten into a pulp. Supreme Kai and Gohan leave the planet of the kai's after supreme kai explaining he still isn't strong enough to face Makaioshin. The answer to a way to stop him can only be found in the demon realm.


Meanwhile on earth. The servants find the lookout. Piccolo and Krillin will face them. Makaioshin heads out to the planet of the Kai's to see what happened to buu. He doesn't know IT but he does travel super fast through space. But this will take a while. He eventually arrives and smirks while seeing the dead bodies of the Kai's.

When Slade killed Moira Oliver went through a rite of passage. He let Slade live. He had a great talk with Slade at the end of season 2 where he made clear that not killing Slade is what made him strong. He honoured his dead mother by being someone she would want him to be. 

Laurel also was against killing and she always had a great sense of justice. Killing for her would also be a huge NO. So what does Oliver do to honour Laurel? He goes killing again. 

Guggenheim really likes to skullfuck the characters on this show so much. Sure, you could make Oliver a killer again.

That would mean they would be in future other world. Their story could've gone on to figure out what really happened with Zamasu in the future timeline. Meanwhile Trunks returns to the past and his father is gone, Goku is gone with no way to bring them  back from the dead because of the lack of Dragon Balls in the future.

This will lead to Whis training Trunks and telling him about the Super Dragon Balls. That even the Super Dragon Balls from the present timeline can grant wishes that extend time and space. 

So Trunks trains for a while and Bulma tracks the Super Dragon Balls down with Beerus, Trunks and Goten. Meanwhile present day Zamasu is tracking them to like we saw in the previous episode preview. This will give us Gotenks vs. Zamasu. Beerus stays in the backround. Gotenks thinks he's got the upper hand for a while. Gets cocky like always and gets tricked by Zamasu. Zamasu goes in for the finishing blow and Beerus the destroyer destroys him. 

Goku and Vegeta find out who Black really is during their stay in other world. This future timeline other world is different. They will also meet the Z-warriors that fell against the andriods. 


So Zamasu is dead in the present day timeline but something happens with Gowasu in the present. His true colors will be revealed when Beerus and Whis summon the Super Dragon once again.

The series finale gave us a bit of closure with Oliver finally, really becoming a hero by making a really though decision facing Slade and locking him up instead of killing him. Great character moment! His mother also wouldn't have wanted for him to drown in vengance.


I wonder where the Thea storyline is going with Merlyn. Merlyn is SUCH a great character. One of the best on this show. Glad he's back. Felicity is also so great. I want to see more of her. They also need to bring Sara back next season! I know she left and rejoined the league. I'm hoping for a Sara storyline within The League. They need to show Ra's al Ghul! Maybe she can go on a quest to find out who he really is and take him down from within. The writers on this show were so amazing. I'm sure they can come up with something great.

I know most of the writers and showrunner are currently doing The Flash but Netflix should hire Marc Guggenheim to run a third season. He already was working really close with Andrew Kreisberg and Greg Berlanti on season 1 and 2. He's an experienced writer and he has also written comics. (his wife ran Agent Carter!)


I think he could handle Arrow season 3 very well seeing how involved he already was. He could finally show us his vision for the show. Having a comicbook backround is also nice. I'm sure he'll stay close to the source material. He's a comicbook geek afterall haha. He also has a law backround. Can come in handy for Laurel Lance storylines! It's the perfect pick! 

Come on Netflix!

I actually enjoyed the first part of season 4. It wasn't amazing, but it was still an improvement over season 3 and it felt they could be heading into the right direction if they made the right choices for the second part of the season. But they made a huge mistake by pandering to the Olicity crowd.

I have nothing against EBR, think she's cool, I also have nothing against season 1 and 2 Felicity. I have the opinion that Felicity can still be redeemed by writing her better and giving her less screentime... but for the story it would've been much better if she died in the midseason finale when she got shot. 

That scene was really dramatic and quite good. The only thing that ruined it was that Felicity survived. Her death would've been more earned than Laurel's out of nowhere death. 

This is how season 4.5 should've gone:

Felicity is dead. Oliver wants to see Darhk blood for it. His friends try to control Oliver because they see how it's eating him up. He doesn't care and goes on. Because of his actions Diggle, Thea or Laurel almost get killed because he was so much focussed on revenge. A speech from Laurel gets him to calm down a bit and she reminds him how Felicity wouldn't want this path for him. Remind him how he has his friends and sister. Remind him that he's a different person now. 

Oliver calms down a bit but they still want to stop Darhk.

Meanwhile Darhk doesn't get even more OP. His powers were already OP as fuck. Merlyn is still Ra's al Ghul, but this season 3 mistake will be fixed. Darhk's Hive will get into an all out war with the league of Assasins. This will lead into a flashback centered episode of Damian Darhk and the former Ra's al Ghul, showing the backstory of Darhk  and the league tying into the present day. 

The league/hive war will be the main arc of the season and Star City will be the place where they battle it out. They aren't trying to destroy the world or Star City, they are fighting to take each other out and to get something that's hidden in star city. It's the season long mystery instead of the grave. Nobody knows it but the thing they are looking for and sent them to Star City is a magical tattoo on Oliver's body. Oliver has no idea what it is and how to use it but it will turn out being the key to the hive/league rivalry.  The tattoo will be connected back with Flashbacks to give the flashbacks a real purpose and it will connect to Oliver's rage over Felicity's death. There won't be any loose plotlines in this story. No Donna all season. Captain Lance will be the one running of Mayor and he'll get targeted by Hive. Black Canary stays alive and she'll have a new costume this season... the Black Siren costume (which looks freaking more badass). Diggle's arc will also be tied to Hive and his brother. But his brother is actually dead. For real. He'll find out what happened to him and it will reveal something about Darhk. His brother died because he found out something about Darhk. This will give his death some meaning and a reason why it was covered up. 

His brother arc won't be huge. Felicity is dead. Laurel has an arc tied to her father's campaign. Showing her as the DA and as Black Canary as support to Oliver and fighting against Hive/the league. She'll be there to pick Oliver up when he's down, kicking ass and also fighting against her own nemisis that will be introduced at the beginning of the season. This person is an agent of Hive that will be revealed to have her own hidden agenda. Laurel and this enemy will cross paths multiple times and she'll be the reason why laurel is going to keep improving this season. After one encounter this enemy will cut laurel's throat. Sending laurel into the hospital, damaging her vocal cords. This will give the story a way to give her an actual canary cry. Cisco will step in with Pied Piper tech and enhance her vocal cords. No need for a gadget anymore. Laurel will dust herself off and return with her new powers after getting stronger and face her enemy again. The real black canary will be born in this season..

Thea's arc will be about finally getting Merlyn out of her life. She won't tolerate him anymore. (duh, he treatend moira in the past, caused robert to die, tommy to die, used her to kill sara)... 

So at the end of the season Hive and The League get stopped. Merlyn dissapears and Darhk dies. Lance is mayor. Diggle finds out the truth about his brother. Felicity is dead. laurel is the DC. Thea quits and leaves and Donna is never to be seen (okay, only during the Felicity funeral scene).

This seriously was the best Super episode so far and probably one of the best Dragon Ball episodes ever. It was one of the most solid and cohesive episodes.

The RoSaT flashback, the Matrix esque Kai space with Gowasu and Zamasu going 1000 years into the future to see the future of that alien race, the Trunks/Vegeta relationship, the Beerus/Goku banter, Beerus telling the Omni King to call back later and then breaking that table with his head like it's nothing, loved how Image Training making a comeback.

This Black arc is already ranked above the Buu arc for me. If it keeps up going this way it can become one of my most favourite ones ever. The only thing lacking (for the moment) is action, but I'm sure there's a lot of that to come when the battle starts and mysteries are revealed.

I also must not forget that face Vegeta was giving Trunks while he was eating. The funny thing about that was that Trunks was thinking how strong Goku must have become. It's like Vegeta was reading his mind.

I just have to say that PoI is the best (super)hero show we've had. I don't think any of the CW superhero shows come close to the quality of PoT. Same goes for the Marvel ABC shows. There is an argument to be made for the Marvel Netflix shows, but the thing is that PoI really knew how to balance humour with stakes and serious plot. Like many comics that I love also do. That sets it above the rest for me. PoI was well balanced, it actually was set in New York and not infront of a green screen and the show has loads of heart because of that and the incredible writing which I do find the best out of all of those superhero shows. PoI is a quality show and I'm happy that we've gotten a great ending. CBS canceled prematurely but I actually don't mind that. 5 seasons is more than enough, it got a great ending and it didn't overstay it's welcome. It went out on a high note. It didn't stay on the air until it became a parody of itself. 


And another thing. The Batman influences are so strong and the way how characters interact just feel so comicbooky. With many characters having an inner monologue. 


People have said this probably before but Reese and Finch were Batman. Both of them. 1 of them was the asskicker side of Batman and the other one was the genius side. Carter was Gordon (the cop helping the vigilante), Fusco was Bullock (the corrupt cop that redeemed himself), Shaw was a Robin, Batgirl or Nightwing, Root was Catwoman (first a villain, than an anti-hero and than a hero), Bear was Ace the Batdog, Greer/Samaritan was Ra's al Ghul (or you could say Samaritan was his Lazarus Pit of sorts), Decima tech. was his League of Assasins, we also had Elias as The Pinguin (the big bad smart mobster of the town).


The creator of the show, Jonathan Nolan, co-wrote many of his brothers scripts (Christopher Nolan). I'm sure many of his research about Batman stuck and it influenced his own show.


We even had 2 Batcaves on this show. The Library and The Subway. Finch also hated violence and lived by a set of rules. Like Batman also doesn't want to cross a certain line.

The mangaka of Hunter X Hunter also made Yu Yu Hakusho and both are influenced by Dragon Ball. Especially Hunter X Hunter. It has Toriyama influences BUT it mostly stands on it's own and it's a masterpiece of an anime in it's own right. The animation is also really beautiful, it's done by Madhouse.


Short summary: Hunter X Hunter is set in an incredible world where you got these people called Hunters. The main character Gon was abandoned by his father as a baby to become a hunter. Gon sets out into the world to become a Hunter himself, to find his own father and to figure out why his father left him to become a hunter. On his journey Gon will make friends, enemy's and also learn a lot about life. HxH isn't a predictable anime. It takes twists and turns and it's just really entertaining and full of heart. It's got lots of action too and it's done amazingly with interesting powers. 


Give it a shot!

And to the people who've already watched it. Does anyone have videos with Hunter X Hunter 2011 music added to Dragon Ball Z scenes? Someone posted something like that a while back but I can't find it anymore. HxH has such a great score and it fits amazingly well with Dragon Ball Z scenes.

''I have the strength to let you live''. That's what he told Slade. Whole season 2 was about Oliver becoming something else, someone else to honor his friends memory. ''You helped me to become a hero Slade, thank you''. This just shows how much Oliver had grown. He went from a ruthless killer to a hero that didn't kill his mother's killer because he wanted to honor his friends memory that he had let down.

2 seasons later: Sure Darhk, I'll kill you. Character growth? Nah. Fuck that shit. Laurel wouldn't even like this, seeing how she had a strong moral sense. The reason why she went into law afterall. She always tried to help me to do the right thing. But fuck Laurel and Tommy. Fuck my growth during season 2 when I really became a hero. I'll kill you now because it's the most easy thing to do. Coming up with a why to take your powers away (again) and to put you in jail is too hard. I got this prison on the island. But fuck that too, I won't use it.

The writers could've just come up with a way to take Darhk's powers away (again) and put him on the island argus prison because a regular prison couldn't handle him. Put him next to Slade and Boomerang. Let the season 5 villain also end up there or also put some villain of the week villains in there and do a supermax storyline in season 6. With Oliver being back again on the island, all alone, having to battle all of his former enemies. Have them uncover some mystery on the island and make that the main point of the season. You could also have Diggle drop in eventually or Thea/Roy. Or give them a storyline next to the island storyline that would connect both plots to eachother. Do that instead of flashbacks. 

I started to lose track of my rambling... so Oliver's character development is crap. 


Edit: and if you really have to kill off Darhk, come up with a better way. Have some other force take him out. Like how Flash did with the time wraits. Or have an other member of the team kill off Darhk while saving Oliver. Or have give Merlyn a decent storyline for a change that builds up to the death of Darhk.

Enjoyed it from start to finish. The Russo's clearly know what they are doing. The Winter Soldier wasn't a coincidence. They know how to balance so many characters and how to handle them all. 


First of all, I really like how the Russo's make use of humor. Even Tony was toned down in a way. He was the most mature I've ever seen him in the MCU. He was the futurist like I know him. Liked how Hawkeye actually called him that (sarcastically). Not that Tony wasn't funny at all. He had great lines. He's still a very funny character but they mixed it well with serious elements. 


I went into the movie as a team Cap supporter but Tony really made me neutral. I can get why the UN would want to oversee the Avengers. How someone could keep them in check. But I also get how Cap is weary of that. What if the UN won't let them go into action when it's really needed? The UN isn't really the most effective organisation we've got in this world. I could also see why Cap wouldn't trust governments anymore after the events in TWS. 

I loved the dynamic between Tony and Steve. 


Secondly, Black Panther was just AWESOME. T'Challa's accent, his look, the fighting style, the claws. It was just a perfect Black Panther adaptation. Loved the Wakanda accents in this movie. Far better than the over the top and clearly fake German and Eastern-European accents in previous MCU movies and tv shows. This movie actually made an effort to make them sound believable. Sure, Wakanda isn't a real country. But these characters sounded believable. I didn't believe for a single moment that Maximoff's were from Sokovia. I also noticed that Wanda toned her accent down. I wonder if Elizabeth Olsen decided that or the Russo's gave her that direction.
Can't wait for the Black Panther movie though. His royal highness was badass and I got a Batman vibe from him when he was in his jet, following Tony. His arc was done very well. From wanting revenge and going to preventing Zemo's death.


That leads me to Zemo. I honestly thought he was a great villain, one of the best MCU villains so far. I believed his motivations, his backstory and why he did the things he did. Sure, you  could say his plan was  over the top to make the Avengers take each other out. But it wasn't executed in a over the top fashion. I could believe his plan in this movie. I've seen Bond movies in recent years with Bond villains that had much more convoluted plans filled with holes in them  and many reviewers and fans still hail them as amazing villains. I'd say Zemo was Bond  villain esque and I liked him better than most Bond villains of recent years. 


The Winter Soldier was brutal. Liked how they linked him to Howard's death. Loved how brutal he was and how they made use of his arm. I want to see more of him in the future. It's a great character with lots of turmoil and inner struggle. The Russo's have done him justice in these past movies. 


Spider-Man was iconic Spidey. Being all witty, using his smarts. His Star Wars reference was hilarious and effective. He was truelly our friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man. Loved how Tony commented on how hot his aunt was. Something every fan said when they announced Marissa Tomei as Aunt May.


And damn... Scott freaking Lang. Ever single line that guy had was golden. From calling Steve ''Captain America'' (fully) to his amazing Giant-Man showcase. It was all golden. 


Vision, Wanda, Falcon, Rhodey, Natasha and Clint also had their moments with Vision and Wanda being the most interesting. Their relationship is something I'd love to see more about. Also loved Falcon's interactions with Bucky. Everything Bucky did annoyed the shit out of him. 

This movie was such an Avengers movie. I don't care what people say. This was the best Avengers movie so far. It had all the Avengers. It gave them all a good amount of screen-time and the action was superb. Probably the best action I've seen in a comicbook movie. The Winter Soldier already showed how good the Russo's are with action. This built further upon that. This was an Avengers movie with Cap and Tony as the main characters. 


I loved this movie overall. It met all my childhood comicbook needs. Great fun, high stakes, huge scale, hilarious, heartwrenching and also heartwarming. 


The Avengers are safe with The Russo's. I'd let them direct every single Marvel movie if that was possible and realistic. The action alone is worthy of your ticket prices. Can't wait for epic African badass T'Challa in his own movie. Spidey in his own movie and Giant-Man and the Wasp. 


I probably sound like a mindless hyped up fanboy. I'm actually somebody that tends not to overrate comicbook movies and shows.

If so, than damn that's epic. He was walking with that hat around during the whole series while the viewer didn't know he took the hat from a criminal that he killed. (Or am I too slow and was this already explained?)

Disclaimer: I'm not a DC hater. I'm a DC fan, Marvel fan, sci-fi fan, anything cool fan. I just didn't enjoy BvS that much and I can't see why some people think it's a masterpiece. I understand the concepts, the theme's and the messages behind the movie. They are just executed really poorly. The first halve of the movie feels like a string of scenes that don't really fit together. It's like certain scenes were just written to excist on their own and don't fit really well together. This could just be an editing problem that occured. 


I fear for the future of the DCEU with Snyder at the helm of things with creative control. I loved 300 as a balls to the wall action movie. Didn't care for it's story. It was just badass with over the top visuals. Watchmen was fine. But that didn't blow me away also. I did enjoy Man of Steel but that was also more due to the action. I'm a huge Dragon Ball fan and that movie catered more to my Dragon Ball action side of excitement. That movie did nothing for me to excite me about the character of Superman. 

Snyder isn't a subtle or an intelligent director like certain people make him out to be. He's totally in your face with his symbolism. Like the crosses during the Superman death scene at the end of BvS. Or the constant devil and hell talk from Luthor. Or the not so subtle foreshadowing and the forced future scenes in Bruce' 'nightmares'. 

I think there was an okay script. Some good ideas but that Snyder made a mess out of it. Because there really are some elements in BvS that I really like. But I feel like it wasn't utilized to it's full potential. 


And don't feel offended please. This is just an opinion. If you honestly think that Snyder is a genius and BvS was a masterpiece, than that's fine by me. I've noticed that some people can get really upset if you honestly point out what you thought about this movie that wasn't positive. This is just my opinion that I formed after watching the movie.

Everybody is dealing with the Black Canary grief in their own way. Diggle is going after Darhk's wife, Thea is out clubbing sniffing 900 kilo's of cocaine while Felicity is blaming herself for Laurel's death. All because they lost Laurel due to a lack of ''overwatch''.  


This montage is being dubbed over with a monologue of Oliver talking about grief and losing important people while a tragic instrumental version of Imagine Dragon's [''Radioactive''] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrhzgna2DLU) is playing. When Oliver says the words ''important people'' the scene cuts to Felicity's part of the montage with Felicity shedding a tear while sitting behind her Palmer tech. desk. The montage won't transistion into the epic Arrow music. It will be a subtle new Blake Neely track remixed with ''Radioactive'' while the Arrow logo on screen will be black.


After this opening montage the focus will go all to Felicity. Oliver is checking up on her because he knows how hard she's been hit by the death of her great friend Dinah Laurel Lance. He knows that she's going through rough times, seeing how she recently stopped being a ''hero'' because of everything becoming too much for her. Oliver walks in and has an awkward interaction with Curtis, who's in the room with Felicity at Palmer tech. Curtis says he's sorry to hear the sad news..... about Oliver and Felicity breaking up, and Black Canary dying.


Oliver and Felicity will have a long talk after this. It'll be about loss (their relationship), lies and not keeping secrets from each other anymore (this will refer to the promise Oliver made to Laurel. This promise will cause friction between Oliver and Felicity in the future. Basically the same thing like with the William secret. These writers love to repeat plot, so we will repeat the whole plot again).


The scene after this is Thea waking up from her heavy hangover. She opens her eyes and Malcom mysteriously pops up from underneath her bed. She jumps on him and attempts to stab him with her heroin needle. Malcolm blocks it with his new hand nobody mentioned last time. He tells Thea he's sorry how Laurel died, says that he really means it but he also says something sarcastic about BC. Malcolm explains how he's there to save Thea from Genysysys. This will be the only scene where Felicity won't be mentioned. Thea looks at him and doesn't say a word, and doesn't ask a thing and the scene ends unanswered in that special CW kind of way.


Next scene is Diggle returning with Ruvé as his prisoner. He puts her in Andy's old cell filled with piss and poop, seeing how Andy didn't have a toilet in there. Oliver is like WTF dude, why did you kidnap her? They are having this talk without their masks on in an area next to that cage but they act like Ruvé can't hear them. The conversation will quickly change to a Felicity centric convo. Diggle asks if he already asked Felicity to rejoin the team. Diggle gives a pep talk about Leyla and himself, something about looking at baby Sara and smiling and something about how Oliver and Felicity should have a kid too (I bet Olicity shippers would want this). Oliver ends this scene smiling and the camera pans from his smile into flashback mode to Oliver on the island frowning.


That badguy on the island, I forgot his name, gets out of the rubble somehow. It isn't explained how he has popped up again. He'll have a monologue about power and Oliver looks confused as fuck. Whoosh, loud transition back to the present.


Darhk is standing before that weird box thingy they introduced episodes ago that the writers forgot about and didn't know what to do with it. Now it's back and it gets a half assed explaination. It basically is a map, because the writers saw this theory online, the map will lead to a save place for people to hide from genysysysyshrk. That's where Malcolm wants in.

Darhk mentions BC and how happy he is finding out Oliver is GA. He then mentions how he should visit his charming fiancee. He will mention how he's impressed that she's walking again and he'll have look to into that. At the end of this scene Darhk gets the message from Andy that Diggle took Ruvé.


Next scene is Felicity again. Now with Donna. Donna finds out about Laurel being BC. And gives an inspirational speech how Felicity already is a hero herself and doesn't need a mask. She'll also say something about light and dark. They love this words during this season. Felicity will say how afraid she is that she'll end up like Laurel, but Donna will remind her she's more light than dark or something like that.  The ending of this scene is Felicity crying with snot coming out of her nose while hugging her mom and looking at the BC costume in the backround (this is the set-up to Felicity becoming Black Canary, without a mask... because why would they hide such an incredible face of such a strong woman?!). 


Whoosh into the loud flashback transistion from the BC costume to that badguy on the island handing a shovel to Oliver. He tells him to digg and doesn't explain why. The badguy is holding that girl hostage in a force choke. So Oliver diggs.. Whoosh transistion.
The episode goes back to Diggle interrogating Ruvé. Ruvé knows about all their ID's too and she ignores Diggle and talks to Oliver about Felicity. Oliver is standing in the backround. She threatens Felicity if something would happen to her. 

Felicity will be targeted now because Ruvé has been taken away by team Arrow. Oliver goes into action to save Felicity!!!!


Everyone will head to Palmer tech for the episode showdown. But Felicity won't need any saving! She'll use some of Curtis' tools and her wits to outsmart the ghosts and Darhk who are coming for her. Oliver won't have to shoot an arrow. He sees this happening and is impressed. But now the enemies see GA and attack him too. Diggle shows up as back-up and kills some fuckers in cold blood while Oliver is getting his ass kicked by the ghosts. Felicity sees this happening while she's being confronted by Darhk. He has her in a force choke.... but then... Felicity reaches out to Darhk's heart. She'll talk about Ruvé and true love and how she found it with Oliver. Oliver meanwhile overhears this while getting the shit kicked out of him.

Darhk loses his grip on Felicity during her emotional monologue about loss and grief. Returning the episode back to the monologue but now really hammering it down to the loss of her relationship and how life is too short and that she realizes that she has to accept Oliver for who he is. Seeing how Ruvé did the same with Darhk... so Darhk loses his grip for a fraction of a second. In this second Diggle shoots Darhk. But he stops the bullet midair and loses his focus on Felicity. She breaks a chair and hits him on the back with it. Darhk has gone KO. Nobody is going to finish him off (because it isn't the finale yet) and they all run out of the building.


Second to last scene: Thea is back. Tells them about the escape plan Malcolm has. But the grand reveal will happen after this moment. Queen Felicity walks in at just the right moment, she couldn't have heard what Thea was saying but she makes a witty remark about Malcolm's sanity. Everybody is glad she's back. She sits behind her computer and says how glad that this loss (her going away) has been fixed and how she couldn't imagine life without team Arrow and Arrow himself while holding Oliver's hand.


Last scene: Lance is still crying by himself... camera zooms on a tear and the Arrow logo appears (it's not black anymore. Yeah the loss is resolved!!)



Next episode promo: It's Felicity getting superpowers! The whole team is getting the shit kicked out of it and Felicity is the only one that can save them. But how?! Felicity thinks of a genius idea. She gets Curtis to adjust the chip in her spine to give her superpowers! This genius Felicity idea will make her into someone else, into something else. Felicity is the key to all of this!

The Kaio-Ken also isn't always animated. Like when Goku was fighting Freeza. Gohan mentioned how Goku could still use his Kaio-Ken. Piccolo explained to him that Goku was using the Kaio-Ken all along. So we could assume all the ''Z-Fighters'' can use the Kaio-Ken, or at least a variation of it, after Piccolo's remarks on this learning to amplify energy in small bursts.

I truelly dislike that relationship on this show but it isn't the fault of the pairing of the 2 characters nor is it the fault of the actors.


The problem lies with the showrunner. The decline of quality started at the beginning of season 3. That season felt directionless, it was a mess with really dumb plottwists and misdirection and also really bad storytelling surrounding ''Olicity''. But why did the show start going downhill in that season? The answer is simple: The showrunner Kreisberg left after season 2 and went on to do The Flash. While The Flash became a good show Arrow's decline started with Guggenheim. There isn't a single tv show that I've seen that kept it's quality with a showrunner change. Just go watch The Office, Dexter and Community (I hear the same happened with TWD, haven't seen it). But when those shows got a new man in charge: a new showrunner, they all went downhill from that point forward. 


The main problem is Greg Berlanti's company doing too much DC shows without the right resources. You strip a good show of it's showrunner and let it slowly die. While you put your best resources on the new show: The Flash.

The Flash profited greatly with Kreisberg's vision while Arrow got plottwists that made no sense for Sara's death, bad build up for that death, senseless trips to Nanda Parbat, cringeworthy interaction between Oliver and Felicity like you were suddenly watching a different show: a soap opera, making Malcolm Ra's al Ghul, having Oliver saying that he wants Malcolm to be in Thea's life even if he's a psycho who would do more harm than good to Thea's life, this season with no clear direction for the villain, the cringeworthy Felicity storylines, putting her in a wheelchaire to only take her out of it 3 episodes later while walking out on her ''love of her life'' while he was just breaking down infront of her,  making Felicity a holy spirit, a mary sue who can do no wrong etc. etc. etc. It's just a clusterfuck that just goes on and on and on.

[Jay Garrick]

May I have your attention please?

May I have your attention please?

Will the real Jay Garrick please stand up?

I repeat, will the real Jay Garrick please stand up?

Well, this is a complication here..



Y'all act like you never seen a speedster before

Jaws all on the floor like Killer Frost and Deathstorm just burst in the door

And started whooping ass worse than before

They first were a couple on Earth-1, Ronnie died (Ah!)

It's the return of Zoo... ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding,

He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""

And Dr. Wells said... nothing, you idiots!

Jesse Quick's dead, she's locked in the dam prison! (Ha-ha!)

Ice cold women love Jay Garrick

[*vocal turntable: zipp zipp zipp*]


[Caitlin Snow]

""Jay Garrick I'm sick of him

Look at him, running around in his you-know-what

Kidnapping the you-know-who."" ""Yeah, but he's so fast though!""


[Jay Garrick]

Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose

But no worse, than what's going on in your stepsister Iris' bedroom

Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't

But it's cool for Barry Allen to waste Earth-Two fools


That arm went through my chest, That arm went through my chest

And that was a plottwist, it really was the best 

And that's the message that we deliver to little Earth-One

And expect them not to know what a big Jay Garrick is

Of course they gonna know what a Garrick is

By the time they ask that Zolomon dude

They got S.T.A.R Labs, don't they?

""We ain't nothing but Meta's.."" Well, some of us speedsters

Who cut other people open like cantaloupes [Zoom]

But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes

Then there's no reason that a masked man and another masked man can't dope

[*Wait what?!*] But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote

Velocity prick your artery, sing the chorus and it goes


[Chorus – Jay Garrick (repeat 2x):]

'Cause I'm Jay Garrick, yes I'm the real Garrick

All you other Jay Garrick's are just imitating

So won't the real Jay Garrick please stand up,

Please stand up, please stand up?


[Jay Garrick]

Allen don't gotta feed off the speedforce to stay alive;

Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!

You think I give a damn about a Flash?

Half of you Flash's can't even stomach me, let alone stand me

""But Garrick, what if you kill 'm all, wouldn't it be weird?

Why? So those speedsters could just fight me to get the spotlight?

So you can, put me next to Wally West?

Yo Shit, Bart Allen better switch me chairs

So I can sit next to Eobard and Eddie Thawne

And hear 'em argue over who hates the Flash more

Little bitch, put me on blast on Channel 52

""Yeah, he's fast, but I think he's dating Caitlin Snow, hee-hee!""

I should read her research on Velocity-9

And show the whole world how you gave Garrick VD (Velocity Disease) [AHHH!]

I'm sick of you little vigilante's and hero groups, all you do is annoy me

So I have been sent here to destroy you [bzzzt]

And there's a million of us just like me

Who run like me; who just don't give a fuck like me

Who look like me; walk, talk and act like me

It just might be the next best thing but not quite me!


[Chorus]


[Jay Garrick]

I´m like a head trip to run after, who´s Zoom? Who's Garrick?

The things you theorize about with your friends on the internet

The only difference is I got the fast balls to do it

In front of y'all but I was false and sugarcoated it all

But now I just get in my suit and kill it

And whether you like to admit it [*ERR*] I'm the fastest never forget it

Better than ninety percent of you speedsters out there

Then you wonder how can kids eat up these action figures like Velocity 

It's funny; 'cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty

I'll be the only person in the nursing home speeding

Pinching nurses asses when I'm jacking off with Velocity 

And I'm jerking but this whole bag of Velocity isn't working

And every single person is a Jay Garrick lurking

He could be working at Big Belly Burger spitting on your onion rings

[*HACH*] Or in the S.T.A.R Labs parking lot, circling

Screaming ""I don't give a fuck!""

With his Flash suit on and his metal hat up

So, will the real Jay please stand up?

And put one of those pointy fingers on each hand up?

And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control

And one more time, fast as you can, how does it go?


[Chorus 4X]


[Jay Garrick]


Ha ha

Guess there's a Jay Garrick in all of us

Fuck it, let's all stand up

The thing that bugs me the most isn't the story or the animation. It's the sound effects and the feeling of the punches and kicks. Back in the day a punch would feel powerful. Like the whole earth could shake. Now it feels like they are hitting punching bags with boxing gloves. Dragon Ball had iconic soundeffects. With characters powering up, landing, jumping, using super speed etc. They seem to have changed all the sound effects for super. Which is a shame imo. 


And an other thing that bugs me is the fighting choreography. It just seems like the creators don't put any thought behind the fights. Next to that they are also badly animated. Look back at the classic Dragon Ball fights. They were crafted very well. Fighters moved a certain way. This was even still the case with DBZ. Goku doing backflips, using after images, martial arts etc. Now they are just punching each others fists the whole time. Or when they really run out of their budget they just use the 'oh they are too fast to follow with our eyes' animation. 


I'm still greatfull that this series exist. I still hope it'll pick up with the Universe 6 tournament arc. I really hope we'll get good fights.

Almost like how Future Trunks created new timelines in Dragon Ball Z. He went back in time to prevent something horrible but when he went back to his own time, everything was was still in ruins. But the timeline he visited turned out differently. Because of this a new timeline was created. A different earth with different outcomes. 


So once there could've been 1 earth. Then someone decided to go back in time. Because of this, new outcomes became possible and a parallel earth got created. This parallel earth became earth 2. With earth 2 being totally different because of a butterfly effect the time traveller created. Same thing happened when other time travellers did the same thing, causing multiple earth to be created.

Shouldn't he have to answer about his past crimes? 

I personally think this could make a good storyline. Somekind of universal police or a kai specialized in these matters come to earth to bring Vegeta to trial.

*Warning. Long read.*


Raditz shows up on earth and is looking for Kakarot (Goku). Raditz finds him but Goku doesn't want to join him. Raditz threatens the earth and kidnaps Gohan. Goku goes to face him and fight him. Goku finds out that Raditz is just too strong for him and decides to make a deal with Raditz. Goku joins Raditz but the earth and Gohan have to be left alone.


Goku leaves with Raditz, it's all dramatic. Krillin doesn't agree with what Goku is doing. Goku says he has no other choice. Everyone is shocked and Goku is gone. 


It turns out that there are only a dozen of Saiyans still alive. Raditz, Nappa, Vegeta, a few female Saiyans and a kid or two/three and a few other male warriors. Vegeta is their leader and a great tactician. Him being a great tactician would be shown through the way how he approaches battles. And they are on the run for Freeza. They are still concoring planets, not for Freeza but to survive. They are selling the planets to the highest bidder and they are staying ahead of Freeza. Freeza hates the Saiyans, destroyed their home world and he's scared to death of them. Only a dozen of them are ruining his plans and he is determined to find them and kill them all. Freeza will be slowly built up as the big bad villain of the series.


Goku learns about all of this when he's with them and he tries to change their ways. They don't have to kill and conquer planets. They just have to stand up against Freeza and take him out. They call Goku foolish. Even if they wanted to take him out, he's just too strong. And they tell Goku that Freeza isn't the one that made them turn evil world conquers, they tell Goku that they were like that way before Freeza showed up. And we will get some backstory about the Saiyans


So there are some moments that show that the Saiyans are having difficult times. Here and there we see some good sides of them. But they still are merciless killers. They are killers but we also see a  more human side of them. It should be a fish out of water story. The audience should learn about the Saiyans through Goku. 


After a few months a new target comes in and they want to go and conquer it. During this time Goku is training with the Saiyans and becoming stronger. Vegeta is impressed and is worried about Goku's rapid growth. Goku is terrified and he doesn't want them to go through with conquering that planet. This turns into a battle between Goku and Raditz. Goku has now surpassed Raditz and Goku defeats him (Raditz isn't killed) but Goku almost dies during the battle. This will give him a zenkai boost. Goku heals up but then the Saiyans decide to bring Goku to trial in Saiyan fashion. Because Goku rebelled they are canceling the deal with they made with him and they are heading towards Earth. They also learn about the Dragon Balls because Goku let it slip in a classic Goku manner being all naieve and silly. Vegeta wants the Dragon Balls to wish planet Vegeta back. But Raditz has other secret plans. He wants them for selfish gain (immortality). It will be established that Raditz is batshit crazy. The total opposite of Goku. While Vegeta is level headed, a tactician and also ruthless. While Nappa is loyal and follows orders and has great pride of being a Saiyan just like his prince. 


This will turn out into an all-out battle between the earth fighters and the Saiyans. Piccolo trained Gohan in the meantime because after Goku left Piccolo saw his chance to hurt Goku and took Gohan to train him as his apprentice, to turn him against his father. This will backfire in the end, Gohan won't turn on his dad and Piccolo ends up sacrifycing himself for Goku during the battle against the Saiyans. Because of the bond he created with Gohan he didn't want to see his dad die, even if he hated his guts. At this moment Piccolo wil redeem himself. Krillin, Tien, Chiauzu and Yamcha also all kept training because with Goku gone they needed to be stronger. And they are worried about alien threats after Raditz showed up.


It's an all-out battle on earth. All the fighters will get great fights and showcase new moves they learned during their training. Krillin, Yamcha, Tien and Chiauzu will face off against the less powerfull Saiyans while Piccolo, Gohan and Goku are fighting against Vegeta, Nappa and Raditz. So no Saibamen.


In the end Goku still tries to convince Vegeta to give up on his bad ways and join him to go fight Freeza. Vegeta declines again. Some of the other Saiyans don't see Vegeta anymore as a fitting leader and are tired of  being opressed by Freeza. They decide to leave earth and find Freeza themselfs. Goku urges them to stay and join him but they don't see Goku as someone fit to follow because he has a good heart and is too gentle. 


Nappa dies, Piccolo dies, Chiauzu dies and some of the Saiyan warriors die. Raditz is still alive and retreats  with Vegeta. They will head to Namek after being healed to find the Dragon Balls because they failed on earth. 


The fighters of Earth will also go to Namek to wish Piccolo and Chiauzu  back. 

It would also be cool if the events on Namek would play out differently. Not having Freeza as the big baddy there but Cell. Cell? But how could Cell be on Namek? He would be written differently. Instead of being created by Dr. Gero be could be created by a scientist of Freeza. Collecting DNA samples from the Saiyans and other power aliens. He would still try to become perfect. 


Raditz would be together with Vegeta on Namek taking out the Namekians. Raditz will betray Vegeta on Namek while collecting the Dragon Balls. Cell will show up. He will become perfect after absorbing the strongest Namekian. Namekian dna would be the last piece to his puzzle. 


And then Freeza could be saved as the main event and the last villain of the series. Showing up on earth erradicating the population and having an amazing all out battle and Goku turning into the legendary Super Saiyan. 


After that the show should be ended.
