When I have the atomizer attached to the ecig it starts to fire without the button being pressed.

I've already opened it up to clean it up in case there was just some juice in there that dripped through, but it still has the same problem.",electronic_cigarette,IPV2S firing problem,https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/4j2yfv/ipv2s_firing_problem/

He had to many men for just me and my vassals to fight so I hired a tribal with all the prestige that I had. But when I clicked the button on the intrigue menu no army appeared in my capital. The army hadn't spawned anywhere in my territory but I had lost the prestige for them. Then I saw them on the army list on the right side of the screen. I clicked on them and they were in southern Bulgaria in the enemies land.

I looked at the intrigue option and it said they would spawn there if I hired more but I was wondering if there is a reason behind this or if it was a bug.",CrusaderKings,Strange spawning of tribal armies.,http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/3cv3ni/strange_spawning_of_tribal_armies/
