Always get washable, might not be as nice as dry clean, but you'll save money on cleaning etc. (Can't go to work with a coffee or yoghurt stain on your trousers).

Mix it up with either black or brown shoes depending on trouser colour. I've only got like 1 pair of each that I wear to the bone lol, but make sure to polish them.

Shirts- I love grey/dark shirts, white as well (although tattoos can show through them which is an issue for me). Get lots of neutral colours (grey/black/white/light blue/light pink).
Non iron shirts as well will be a bonus.

Ties, I stick to single colours or stripes. I find ties the hardest part for me to buy :(

It agains depends on which manager you bring in. If we were to bring in a new manager, this manager would want to bring in his own players/different players into the pool. I don't see a new manager sticking with the same players JK plays. Right now when we're in the middle of WCQ and changing the helmsman and possibly a good part of the crew will help in this situation.

What I feel is, that unlike teams in Europe, we tend to operate much more on a 4 year cycle. Don't get me wrong, the gold cup IS important, there is no disputing that at all. 

But it doesn't hold the same clout that the European Cup does (I live in England and all of my friends focus on the fact that we have a 2 year cycle.) I'm not necessarily sure how big the European Cup is in USA, but the gold cup is non-existent here. The teams in the European Cup are much bigger than the teams in the gold cup (from my experience).

Since we operate on that 4 year cycle, more so, right now we're just at the start of a cycle so to say. I feel it is acceptable to have these different ideas being tried and tested within the first year of this cycle, even if they do fall flat on their face. 


Next year I imagine a very different lineup and young/new call ups, however we can't predict Klinsmann's decisions right now. I think more so he's been trying to determine who will still be playing for the MNT next year.

""I keep sailing off to find myself and coming up short"" links into how a person might take up a hobby (like starting a band) and giving it up because it became too tricky/had other (not necessarily important) priorities (like earning money to pay for bills, whilst they should be pursuing what they want).

Possibly referencing how someone doesn't want another to make the same mistakes they did ""but look at your body, you could still race this I see you there and it's killing me"".
