How should I go about approaching a form/tutor group, as they can be different to a class.

The first time I meet them, I have an hour with them before 'normal' lessons begin. My idea for this hour was first:-

Lay down my rules and expectations. Show them what it is I expect from a class (even if it is my form). Quiet when I'm talking etc. I can then remind them of these expectations when doing the next two activities.

Second, get them to create card name-tags for their desk (I'm doing this with all my classes, so I can learn their names easier). They get to write their name in some sort of creative way they can re-use and can add in some things they like. It also allows me to float round, put names to faces and get to chat to some of them.

The final part idea (for after the name tags) is to give them a simple questionnaire so I can learn about them. Questions include:-
What hobbies do you like/What things do you dislike/Favourite school subject/dream job/plans for the future/favourite book or music/Subject choices for GCSE.

Current Year 11 group have GCSE's, they've had 2 separate teachers in year 10 and are currently behind on a module in history. I am their 3rd teacher (first year professionally teaching) and am currently steaming through content to try (at request of my HoD).

They haven't taken to well to Russia and we're nearly through it. Pupils have been more angsty with me and unfortunately that's had an effect on them with me. We kinda knuckled through it for a bit, however recently:-

I asked a teacher friend (she is technically sick cover from the beginning of the year until easter, whilst I'm a temporary NQT teacher for the year) to come and sit in my lessons, she ended up doing some writing for me on the whiteboard as my board writing is terrible. However this eventually turned into a constant thing (with me actually asking her if she was going to be in). 


Unfortunately for me my year 11 set have suddenly begun taking a liking to her/preferring her as a teacher (we kind of did a bit of team teaching). Today's lesson went a badly (as I focused on my observation instead of this class) and I got completely undermined by my teaching friend in front of my class.

My question is, how do I go back to regaining control with that class?

My normal idea would be the sledgehammer approach (""Here's the line you are now going to tow it"", 3 warnings etc. things that I didn't actually do with my year 11's when I started as I felt they could be more mature about it). However I'm not 100% sure re-taking power by fear/tyranny would work with the set.

I realise I've dug myself into a hole here, any alternative suggestions (other than tyranny) for getting out of it? (I don't want to really my mentor for advice, as I am 100% going to get slated for it, as it was only too late that I realised this was a poor idea.)


I could really do with some help with this, as I'm quite concerned about going back in after a really bollocks lesson where my class have looked to an alternative.


EDIT:- My first idea was to not have her in my class, but I feel that might kick things off too much. Possibly have her in only to do writing, but don't have her suggest ideas.
Also, prepare much more for my lessons.


EDIT 2:- I do realise I've opened myself to a whole bunch of crap. I can't necessarily go in hard and heavy as kids can complain to their parents about me as a teacher and if the parents do care enough, they are probably more then happy to go above me and speak to my HoD, who won't have much to help me.

""2015 has been an eventful year to say the least.
Above all else, I have been welcomed into a family of individuals who are more caring, inspiring, cooperative, and more supportive than I could’ve ever imagined. I started working with The Used in January on a temporary basis and, in a nutshell, it has turned into something more serious. Their new guitar player, I am. I couldn’t be more excited or feel more fortunate to travel and write music with this group of guys. Over the past year of touring, fans of The Used have treated me with an incredible amount of respect and love. It was truly touching and I really can’t thank you enough for the welcome thus far. As far as Jeph, Dan, Bert, and I, in addition to an incredible year of shows, we’ve been working on new music and putting together a bunch of ideas that I think are going surprise you in the best way possible.
In light of this news, after years of writing and waiting to produce a new record, some of the members of Saosin have decided to end our 13 year relationship for questionable reasons. This was a shock to me. Even though all of this happened a few months ago, I’m still processing it. I’m sure I’ll discuss this in greater detail at a later time. One thing I can be sure of is that I could not and would not have done anything differently over the past years. The shows were some of the best we have ever played. It truly seemed as if everyone was happy and positivity was at an all-time high. I was proud of the new music we were creating and to be turned away right before we tracked the record that we had spent years writing and our entire career working towards is saddening at best and angering at worst.
If anyone’s heart or commitment to Saosin could have possibly been in question, it certainly wasn’t mine, ever.
C’est la vie.
To all of the fans that have seen Saosin play, listened to our music, shared in the emotions, supported us or in any way—shared the ride, thank you. Thank you for everything.
Experiences: some joyful, some tragic, some trivial, and some life-changing. Saosin has taught me a lot, Thank you.

The way I read this, is that now Justin is a full-time member of the Used, members of Saosin have decided to move on without him, and that this happened a couple of months ago.

If this is the case I'm not entirely sure what to make of this. Justin was a key member of saosin and their sound.

I'm an NQT in the first year of a job at a new school. It's an inner city school with kids from a poor background. I'm struggling particularly with my year 9 classes (I know year 9 are terrible for new teachers, as they know the school/don't want to do the subject and are dropping it etc.).

My school has little to no behaviour policy. I used to be on placement in a school with a B4L policy (consequence system, 1, 2, 3 etc.)
Here we don't have one. I operate a simple 3 warning policy in my room.
1) Name on the board
2) 15 minute break detention
3) 1 hour after school and a referral

However I feel that its not actually working on my year 9 classes, almost as though they don't care about it.

How can I work on being tougher in class. Making my warnings actually have some grounding too them? Just seems to be water off a ducks back really, rather than an actual threat....

As bad as this might sound, I want the feeling of ""I'm not locked in here with you, you're locked in here with me. And right now I don't feel like that at all.

I'm a former Yugioh player, and current MTG player, although my MTG playing friends are few and far between, so I'm thinking about taking this up to continue my card playing escapades.
 

I've read through the beginners guide (found it a little confusing personally, didn't really help me) and watched a couple of the anime episodes (found them a little dire, but in the same vein of all card game animes, so I have nothing to complain about really). I'm planning on going into my LGS and asking for a beginner session/similar next weekend. But in the meantime I feel that I could pick this game up quicker/easier, if I actually had some cards in my hand in front of me, to read over and look through.


So I was wondering, where do I begin with buying cards? I imagine a trial deck is the best idea, but I'd rather not buy one and find out that I can't use those cards in tournaments (like MTG's card rotation/blocks). 


The idea of the clans/subtypes also confused me a little, as I don't truly understand the idea behind them (again, I'm used to things like Control/Aggro/Ramp etc., are there any parallels to draw?), I'd rather not buy a trial deck of one clan/subtype and realise I don't like that playstyle.

I just want to know what exactly about Suicide Season was such a big step up from their first album. Their first album is has very muddy mix. All the guitars seem very dull and lack a crispness. Whereas with Suicide Season it seems much crisper and polished.


I remember Frederick Nordstrom saying that originally he didn't think much of BMTH after their first album, but when he heard what they'd been working on in his studio at night (after the day sessions) he properly got on board with it. That notion just seems to really confuse me....

Here's their post from Facebook


Friends, family, fans -

We’ve come to the collective decision that it is time to bring I, the Breather’s 6-year career to a close.

After performing on three different continents, participating in major national tours such as Vans Warped Tour and Rockstar Mayhem Festival, and releasing three albums that bring us immense pride, we have accomplished our goals as a band. Truthfully, we never expected to have been able to do a fraction of these things when we started. We all have goals that we are currently pursuing - some of us will continue to carve out our paths in the music industry and some of us have out our focus elsewhere.

We're happy to announce this farewell run with our friends Chasing Safety &amp; Novelists. We may also have a few other things in the works that we will announce later on. If we've brought any value to you, we’d absolutely love to celebrate I, the Breather’s career with you at the upcoming shows. We've got some surprises planned for a few of the dates in particular.

Thank you to everyone who has shown us support in any way. We couldn’t have done this without you. You have been just as big of a part of I, the Breather as we have. 

Love,

Shawn, Conor, Kyle, Aaron

I looked through the 23 man squad that went to Brazil and a lot of players I don't think will make the cut next world cup.

I'm not trying to provoke any sentiments, I'm just interested in seeing who r/ussoccer think will make it from the previous squad to the next.

For example:-

I don't feel Besler or Cameron would make the cut. I think Besler is a solid CB and a good defender. However he's currently out of favour with JK and also JK seems focused on bringing up Brooks and Alvardo as the new defenders. As much as I love watching Cameron play he is going to be 33 when the 2018 cup kicks round, and a bit older. Depending on how he plays at Stoke over the next couple of years, he might make a feature like DaMarcus did at the last cup, but I could be wrong.

Yedlin will make the cut, he's only getting better. However I feel it is also dependent on him playing slightly more regularly as well, rather then being a bench warmer at Spurs.

If needs be, post a 23 man squad of who you think will go, justifying your choices.",ussoccer,"USMNT 2014 World Cup vs 2018 World Cup, who makes the cut?",http://www.reddit.com/r/ussoccer/comments/3h4cu7/usmnt_2014_world_cup_vs_2018_world_cup_who_makes/
