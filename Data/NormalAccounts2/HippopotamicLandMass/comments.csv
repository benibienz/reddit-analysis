5,"hey, u/GTFErinyes, you're the military/int'l affairs expert explainer redditor! Hi!

To add on, I'd like to mention Korean-American infantry draftee and eventual colonel [Kim Yong-Ok / Young Oak Kim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young-Oak_Kim).  He was assigned to the 100 Bn / 442nd RCT (japanese-american army unit), but was then offered reassignment because Japan and Korea were at war:

&gt; During that tumultuous time, the army assigned one Korean-American officer to the all-Nisei 100th Infantry Batallion. But, because Korea was then under Japanese occupation, Lieutenant Young Oak Kim was offered a reassignment as his superiors were afraid he wouldn’t mix well in an outfit made up almost entirely of Japanese-Americans.

&gt;Kim’s response cuts to the heart of our national identity—of who we are, how we define ourselves, and how we measure our worth. Adamantly refusing the transfer, Lieutenant Kim made and won his case for remaining with his unit, asserting that, **“there [are] no Japanese or Koreans here. We’re all Americans and we’re fighting for the same cause.”** [SOURCE](http://www.va.gov/opa/speeches/2010/10_0526.asp) (ALSO INCLUDES SOME REMARKS ON CPT F. WAI)

9,"That's a good question! 

There were organized efforts to exclude non-Japanese from internment as a matter of policy. Americans tried to distinguish between the ""good orientals"" and the bad ones, although not everyone got the message. The article ""How to Tell Japs from the Chinese"", *Life Magazine*, Dec 22, 1941 [link1](http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/foster/lifemag.htm) [link2](https://artifactsjournal.missouri.edu/2012/03/wwii-propaganda-the-influence-of-racism/) is pretty much [physiognometric pseudoscience](https://deadhomersociety.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/mothersimpson5_thumb.png). 

&gt; The United Korean Committee sent representatives to Washington, D.C. and convinced U.S. officials that Koreans should not be interned with Japanese Americans. The State and Treasury Departments issued a special order stating that Koreans should not be treated as Japanese subjects and enemy aliens but instead should be accorded the same treatment as citizens of allied nations. So Koreans were not interned.

&gt; The United Korean Committee issued ID badges with the Korean flag and urged all Koreans to carry these badges as proof that they were not Japanese. 
Many Koreans also wore buttons saying ""I am Korean."" This was actually 
quite common: Many Asian Americans wore  buttons or put up signs in their 
store windows or living room windows saying things like ""I am Chinese"" or 
""I am Korean."" There are many reports of Koreans and Chinese in the U.S. 
being harassed and attacked by white Americans who mistook them for
Japanese. [SOURCE](https://www.quora.com/Were-there-any-ethnic-Koreans-with-Japanese-nationality-interned-in-the-Japanese-internment-camps-in-the-U-S-during-World-War-II): Ji-Yeon Yuh, 2004.

In a reddit [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2dybm5/when_the_american_japanese_were_put_into_the/) 2 years ago, /u/Cordis_melum wrote that ""the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association printed up insignias, registration certificates, pins and armbands promoting Chinese-American allegiance"", and helpfully linked to [a photo](http://imgzoom.cdlib.org/Fullscreen.ics?ark=ark:/13030/hb1g5003tx/z1&amp;&amp;brand=calisphere) of pins that advertise the wearer is Chinese.

Howard Yip, a Chinese-American welder from Los Angeles, took to wearing a sign on his back every day to work: ""[Me CHINESE PLEASE NO JAP.

Edit to add: (I can't really speak to the korean-american experience in detail, so you can read this pdf, 24 pages https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10524/571/1/JL19199.pdf) Chinese Americans had already experienced a boatload of racism and prejudice in the decades before wwII. They were eager to prove they were real Americans, and they worked in factories on the home front, and they fought in the armed forces. But secondly, they had no love for Japan, given that Empire's invasion and terror in East China. Pan-asian-american solidarity wasn't a thing yet. So they played along with the rest of the Americans, denouncing Japanese-Americans for double the satisfaction.

edit: added pdf of *Unwanted Allies: Koreans as Enemy Aliens in World War II* by Michael E. Macmillan

And one more thing: Japanese-Americans lost jobs and property and businesses when they were rounded up and sent to the internment camps. Chinese-Americans were sometimes complicit in taking over businesses in ethnic neighborhoods, and they also filled agricultural jobs that the Japanese-Americans had worked. But this was due to anti-Japanese sentiment, not acceptance of the Chinese as Americans. Red China and the Cold War ensured that acceptance would take much longer.

Are you thinking of his mother Ann Dunham, not his grandmother Madelyn Dunham? Uterine cancer killed her in 1995 at 52 years old. 

Obama campaigned by retelling his mother's fight with her insurance:

&gt; ""She wasn't thinking about coming to terms with her own mortality,"" he said in Santa Barbara, Calif. ""She had been diagnosed just as she was transitioning between jobs. And she wasn't sure whether insurance was going to cover the medical expenses because they might consider this a pre-existing condition. I remember just being heartbroken, seeing her struggle through the paperwork and the medical bills and the insurance forms. So, I have seen what it's like when somebody you love is suffering because of a broken health-care system. And it's wrong. It's not who we are as a people.""

35,"Found this on the internet; apologies in advance for the text wall: ""[Under direct election, candidates would campaign only in large cities](http://blog.politics.ox.ac.uk/the-electoral-college-debunking-myths-used-in-its-defence/)""

&gt;One often hears that under direct election, candidates would ignore most of the country, campaigning only in large cities.  Yet we know that the electoral college provided incentives for candidates to ignore most of the country, especially rural areas.  Small states could not be worse off than they are now.

&gt;However, in a direct election, every vote would count equally and candidates would have an incentive to appeal to all voters, not just those strategically located in swing states.  Moreover, because the cost of advertising is mainly a function of market size, it does not cost more to reach 10,000 voters in Wyoming than it does to reach 10,000 voters in a neighborhood in Queens or Los Angeles.  Actually, it costs less, and there are more swing voters in the smaller markets than in urban areas.

&gt; Under the electoral college it makes no sense for candidates to allocate scarce resources to states they either cannot win or are certain to win, in which case, the size of their victory is irrelevant.  However, making every vote in every state count toward electing the president under direct election would stimulate state party-building efforts in the weaker party, especially in less competitive states, and encourage both parties to campaign actively.  Increased mobilization would inform voters and increase turnout.  Moreover, people are more likely to vote if they think their vote matters.

36,"first, thanks for replying. second, i didn't mean to conflate those things; i have a lot of anti-EC points (and a problem set to finish today, sigh). I'm against the EC as a whole, but also i'm against winner-takes-all-of-the-state, and i'm against using 'But Federalism!' as an argument-ender, and i'm against using congressional representation to allocate EVs.

In a straight popular vote, everyone's vote does indeed matter. This is something that seems plain as day to me, so I'll try to explain it simply: Any texan's vote would matter as much as any californian's or washingtonian's. 

Candidates would ignore/write-off/take for granted nebraskan voters less than they do now. Instead, they'd try to win Midwest/Great Plains votes as a demographic. Maybe there'd be a rally in DesMoines or Topeka instead, but they'd know that nebraskans can hear farm policy or drug enforcement policy or whatever, even across state lines. Or, for a different demographic, HUD policies to appeal to urban dwellers that can be reported to voters in NY or SF from a Chicago rally. The weirdness of this year's election notwithstanding, candidates routinely ignore the hell out of safe states. Scrapping the EC would fix that (to a lesser degree, proportional EV allocation within a state would kinda also fix that).

Candidates couldn't ignore political minorities like the conservatives of inland California or the liberals in Houston and Austin. They couldn't ignore Vermonters or DC voters, Montanans or Alaskans, because all those people's votes are no longer safe; they're in play. Maybe they'll get 40% of Wisconsin's electorate instead of 0%, and that matters. Hell, Romney got 37% of California, and that's more Repub voters than there were R&amp;D voters in TEN Montanas! On the other side, Obama got 41% of Texas.

Also, if a state loses population between censuses, it doesn't lose EVs. That's not fair either.",2016-10-27 19:41:05+00:00,d9aezbw,5.0,t1_d9ac3mu,3499.0,changemyview

40,"Change MY mind, too.

&gt; As a great senator from a lightly populated state—Montana’s Mike Mansfield—once declared: ‘The principal constitutional safeguards of the federal system” are the House of Representatives, “key to the protection of district interests,” and the Senate, “key to the protection of state interests.” But the presidency, Mansfield argued, has evolved “into the principal political office ... for safeguarding the interests of all the people in all the states.”

* States should not elect the president. PEOPLE should elect the president. Little WY and RI have over-representation in the US Senate, compared to populous CA and TX. They don't need overrepresentaion for the presidential election too. This flies in the face of 1 person, one vote.
* There is no need to protect *state* interests when electing the President. Federal issues do not stop at State lines (except the federal judiciary, but let's not bring Article 3 into the debate).

&gt; The framers expected that the electors would, in effect, nominate a number of prominent
individuals. The delegates believed that many of the presidential electors would vote for
men from their own state and region and that diverse state and regional interests would
usually prevent any one man from usually receiving a majority of electoral votes. At times a
George Washington might be the unanimous electoral choice, but, as George Mason of
Virginia argued in Philadelphia, nineteen times out of twenty, the final choice of president
from the top contenders would be made not by the electoral college itself but by the House
of Representatives, voting by states with one vote per state. 34 In Federalist #66, Hamilton
argues approvingly that it “cannot be doubted” that the House of Representatives, “will
sometimes, if not frequently” select the president, choosing from among the most illustrious
citizens of the Union.”

* Should the will of the Republican-leaning people of Eastern Wash (5th Dist incl Spokane) be ignored? And should the weight of their population be given unto the democratic-leaning victors of the state? The shoe can be on the other foot, too: how about the liberal voters of Austin, whose share of electoral votes are awarded to the other side? Let national republican movements in the rural parts of NY, MN, and CA pool their vote strength. Same goes for democratic coalitions drawing voters from NOVA, Winston-Salem, and Memphis. 
* When people talk about fraud, the only thing that matters is ""stealing"" a state to swing it to the other side. The vote in individual states must be closer than the national vote totals.

47,"&gt; A gifted student can presumably survive and thrive in a regular classroom. **They do not need extra care** or attention to succeed or to develop healthy social relationships

&gt;&gt; **That is true**, but the societal cost is -much- higher for an under-performing gifted student than an under-performing special needs student. Because of it, if we are to have society funded education, it makes sense to prioritize on the ones with the greater societal cost.

I'm going to disagree here. Gifted education is a subset of special-needs education. **ALL** Students need to be educated according to their needs. If any students need a straw-controlled wheelchair and ramp, or a chemistry laboratory, or a sign interpreter, or a therapy dog, or a dedicated mentor, or a special curriculum and a classroom of their peers, whatever, in order to learn appropriately, they should have it. 

Those with unusual learning abilities should not be treated as if they were more-conventional students. Nor should they be cavalierly be stuck into an above/below-grade conventional classroom even if the academic curriculum would be ability-appropriate. Nobody advocates assigning a learning-disabled teenager to an elementary school classroom. Similarly, would a young gifted tween develop her full human potential if she were placed in a class of high-school freshmen? 

It is wrong to short-change gifted students. It is wrong to short-change students with handicaps. Don't set special-ed needs against each other. 

--------------------------------------------

""[T]here is [a mistaken belief that high-ability youngsters will do fine](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/12/gifted-students-have-special-needs-too/266544/), even if the education system makes no special provision for them. This mindset is particularly convenient in a time of budget crunches, when districts feel pressured enough focusing on low-achieving kids at failing schools.""

""[In fact, some researchers in gifted education](http://qz.com/250467/how-gifted-and-talented-programs-are-failing-our-kids/) are attempting to redefine giftedness as a condition of asynchronous development where an individual develops skills unevenly to the extent that the higher the intelligence, the more likely he or she will experience problems of a social nature; the gap between the strengths and weaknesses could be quite large.""

""[R]esearchers concluded that [the profoundly gifted students had experienced roadblocks](https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2014/01/06/gifted-children-study/) along the way that at times prevented them from achieving their full potential. Typical school settings were often unable to accommodate the rapid rate at which they learned and digested complex material. When students entered elementary and high school classrooms on day one having already mastered the course material, teachers often shifted focus away from them to those struggling with the coursework. This resulted in missed learning opportunities, frustration and underachievement, particularly for the exceptionally talented, the researchers suggest. ¶ There’s this idea that gifted students don’t really need any help,” Kell said. “This study shows that’s not the case. These people with very high IQs—what some have called the ‘scary smart’—will do well in regular classrooms, but they still won’t meet their full potential unless they’re given access to accelerated coursework, AP classes and educational programs that place talented students with their intellectual peers like Peabody’s Programs for Talented Youth.”

Of course, an argument against directing resources to gifted programs is that the [resources are too costly](https://rochestersage.org/2011/07/21/is-gifted-education-expensive/),

Or that they're unfairly allocated: ""the curriculum, and specifically, access to a high quality,
rigorous curriculum, has been almost exclusively enjoyed by
White students. [Tracking, honors, and/or gifted programs
and advanced placement courses are but the myriad ways
that schools have essentially been re-segregated](http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ746284.pdf). The formal

When a computer does the redistricting, there are many possible outcomes.

Example: Colorado in 2011 http://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/printable/images/pdf/congdist/pagecgd112_co.pdf and in 2013 http://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/printable/images/pdf/congdist/pagecgd113_co.pdf

Rangevoting.org has a page on computerized splitline districting. Look at Colorado's splitline map: http://rangevoting.org/SSHR/co_final.png.

Here's another Colorado, this time by Brian Olson: http://bdistricting.com/2010/CO_Congress/map.png

Chris Ingraham, this past January:
&gt; Many political scientists are skeptical about the merits of drawing districts based on compactness. Their general argument is that districts are ideally based on communities of interest -- people who share a common demography, culture, class, etc. There's no particular reason, they say, that grouping voters by geographic proximity ensures this coherent community any more than drawing lines according to any other metric. Moreover, algorithms can be biased too.

&gt; It's a point well-taken. But ""community of interest"" is an incredibly squishy term. You can define it pretty much however you want. As I wrote in 2014, if you're a politician in search of a figleaf justification for putting voters from disparate corners of the state into the same congressional district, you can always find one. Communities of interest are a great ideal, but in practice they're so fuzzy that they open the door to all manner of redistricting shenanigans, as we've seen.

&gt; The main obstacles to automated redistricting are legal. For starters, the Voting Rights Act mandates that in some states, race needs to be a factor in redistricting to ensure that minority voters are represented in Congress. Again: a nice idea. But there's a tradeoff: packing all your minority voters into one district diminishes their clout everywhere else. We've seen this in the real world in Florida: the 5th District was originally drawn as a majority-minority district by Democrats. But Republicans saw fit to keep it that way in subsequent years, because it gave black voters less power in the surrounding districts.

&gt; In the end, the prospect of an open, transparent algorithm drawing districts based on population and compactness may be an improvement upon the status quo, where politicians draw the boundaries that best serve their interests. Of course, the chances of this ever becoming reality are slim: doing so would require state legislators to voluntarily cede their redistricting powers to a computer program. And if there's anything lawmakers dislike, it's giving up power.

--------------------------------


Here's one more thing i just remembered: CA went to a nonpartisan https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Citizens_Redistricting_Commission that was supposed to reduce the number of safe seats in Sacramento. There were so many safe seats in the first place because the majority democrats and the minority republicans, accepting the party-power imbalance &amp; wanting to maintain their incumbencies, cooperated to draw the districts that way. http://articles.latimes.com/2002/feb/09/local/me-cong9

70,"Local author Thomas Frank had this to say about white-collar crime and bankruptcy in Johnson County:

&gt; Growing up in Mission Hills, you quickly learn the boundaries and customs of the local notables: the local prep school attended by all the CEOs' kids, the snob colleges they all plan to attend in a few years, the family businesses they stand to inherit, the private police forces they maintain. You also learn that many of your rich friends' dads are in prison. Epidemic white-collar crime is the silent partner of the suburb's contentment, the ugly companion of its tranquil domesticity and the earnest flattery of its courtiers. In addition to disgraced CEOs like Esrey and Green, Mission Hills is the home of numerous smaller-scale thieves, embezzlers, tax evaders, real-estate frauds, and check forgers. The prominence of the criminal element here is likely related to Kansas's unlimited homestead exemption, which allows those declaring bankruptcy to keep their residence. Naturally people preparing to go under wanted the priciest house available, and thus Mission Hills became a magnet for the legally challenged from all across the region. That, plus the borderline criminality of capitalism itself, a condition that has rudely impressed itself on much of the world in the last few years.

72,"I suggest *Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present*, by Christopher I. Beckwith (2009). 

link: http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8882.html

EDIT: some reviews

""Empires of the Silk Road is a major scholarly achievement. This is the first book to provide a comprehensive account of the history of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the present. But it is much more than a simple narrative of events in what is arguably the most important region for the development of civilization during the past four or five millennia. It is an intellectually ambitious undertaking that attempts to account for essential transformations in the cultural, economic, and political life of societies situated both within the Central Eurasian heartland and on its periphery. Beckwith achieves the radical feat of demonstrating how Central Eurasia is actually key for understanding the dynamics of human history and progress throughout antiquity, the medieval period, and the recent past. Above all, and for the first time, he convincingly shows that Central Eurasia was not a sump of poverty-stricken, unremittingly vicious subhumans, but a wellspring of vibrant, energetic, resourceful, enterprising peoples who facilitated communication and change in all directions. In other words, Beckwith turns conventional wisdom on its head and makes Central Eurasia the core of human history, rather than the embarrassing backwater which it is usually portrayed as. Perhaps his greatest contribution is in the powerful, sustained epilogue, where he shatters a whole galaxy of misconceptions about the dreaded 'barbarians.'""--**Victor H. Mair**, University of Pennsylvania

""Christopher I. Beckwith, professor of Central Eurasian studies at Indiana University, suggests in his recent book, Empires of the Silk Road (Princeton University Press), that 'the most crucial element' of societies all through Central Eurasia--including the ones analyzed by this exhibition--was the 'sociopolitical-religious ideal of the heroic lord' and of a 'war band of his friends' that was attached to him and 'sworn to defend him to the death.' This idea, he suggests, affected the organization of early Islam as well as the structure of Tibetan Buddhist devotion. In fact, this 'shared political ideology across Eurasia,' Mr. Beckwith suggests, 'ensured nearly constant warfare.' The region's history is a history of competing empires; trade became part of what was later called the Great Game.""--**Edward Rothstein**, New York Times

""[T]his is no mere survey. Beckwith systematically demolishes the almost universal presumption that the peoples and powers of Inner Asia were typically predatory raiders, and thus supplied themselves by extracting loot and tribute from more settled populations. . . . With his work, there is finally a fitting counterpart to Peter B. Golden's magnificently comprehensive An Introduction to the History of the Turkic Peoples: Ethnogenesis and State Formation in Medieval and Early Modern Eurasia and the Middle East, based on Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Greek, Latin, and European medieval sources. By reading just two books anyone can now sort out Charlemagne's Avar Ring, the Golden Horde, modern Kazakhs and Uzbeks, ancient Scyths, Borodin's Polovtsian dances (they were Cumans), present-day Turks, Seljuks, Ottomans, early Turks, and Bulghars and Bulgarians, among many less familiar states or nations.""--**Edward Luttwak**, New Republic

76,"I'd like to point out that the morality of the colonization was questioned even within the colonial power Spain. The Valladolid debate (1550) was between Sepulveda and Las Casas. 

Sepulveda argued that making war on the Indians was just ""in order to uproot crimes that offend nature"", specifically human sacrifice and cannibalism, and that enslavement was just on the same grounds. He also invoked Aristotle's idea that some peoples were naturally suited to slavery. He also suggested that coercive treatment went hand-in-hand with forced conversion to Christianity.

Las Casas argued that the Indians did not meet Aristotle's definition of the ""barbarian""/natural slave; they were capable of rational thought, and should be persuaded peacefully to convert Christianity. Las Casas also said that the brutal treatment of the Indians was inhumane and unjust. 

Las Casas is a complex figure himself, who himself owned slaves on an encomienda in Cuba until his epiphany in 1514, divestment, and return to Spain. For a while his argument for ending Indian slavery also advocated replacing it with ""acceptable"" African slavery. Then he retracted this position. He also advocated for more-sustainable, less-extractive settlement structures, which werent implemented. He has been criticized for giving fodder to Spain's colonial rivals and the ""Black Legend"" narrative.",2016-09-29 13:48:54+00:00,d86vft6,1.0,t3_54y78w,65257.0,AskHistorians

&gt; cigarette, as defined in Section 104556 of the Health and Safety
&gt; Code, or other tobacco product on the property or in any building or

&gt; or exterior area, or the premises on which it is located, in
&gt; accordance with this article.
&gt; 
&gt;    (b) (1) Every lease or rental agreement entered into on or after
&gt; January 1, 2012, for a residential dwelling unit on property on any
&gt; portion of which the landlord has prohibited the smoking of
&gt; cigarettes or other tobacco products pursuant to this article shall
&gt; include a provision that specifies the areas on the property where
&gt; smoking is prohibited, if the lessee has not previously occupied the
&gt; dwelling unit.

this statute is underpinning u/Linguist208 's point about the landlord's right ""to promote No-Smoking policy"".

Park, Larkspur, Loma Linda, Novato, Pasadena, Pinole, Pleasant Hill, Richmond, Rohnert Park, Sebastopol, South Pasadena, Tiburon, and Union City. Check your city's laws. here's anotehr link: http://www.kpbs.org/news/2012/jan/17/few-protections-against-second-hand-smoke-californ/

But boy, did I learn after. I remember racing to the library to get *Heir*, and then going through every Star Wars book on the shelves, and then waiting for the next book to be released that year. It was *Darksaber*. Yeah. I was excited for *Darksaber*. There was a Jedi who was a vine or some plant thing. Dorsk moved a fleet.

I eventually convinced my mom to take me to Blockbuster and she actually tried to sit through ANH with me to make sure it wasn't too bloody or sexy; she quit watching, got bored when I kept pausing the tape to rattle off every character's backstory from *Tales From the Cantina*... good times.

&gt; Skepticism toward climate change and hostility toward climate policy have been yoked to conservative identity. To reject them is to risk rejecting that identity and harming the social relationships that come with it. And most people have much stronger commitment to their core identity than they do to any individual political issue.

&gt; Once an issue has been yoked to our core identities, we stop reasoning like scientists (gathering evidence, seeing where it leads) and start reasoning like lawyers (start with a conclusion, work backward to build a case). Yale psychologist Dan Kahan calls it ""motivated reasoning""— ""the unconscious tendency of individuals to process information in a manner that suits some end or goal extrinsic to the formation of accurate beliefs."" In this case, the ""end or goal"" is preserving commitments core to identity.

&gt; Studies show that a college education and a self-identified understanding of the issue both tend to raise Democrats’ concern over climate change, but the same factors have no effect, sometimes even a negative effect, on a Republican’s concern. Why? Because Democrats, for basically tribal reasons, are likely to be open to the idea that climate change is a problem. Republicans, for basically tribal reasons, are unlikely to be open to the idea. [A committed Republicans is apt to learn more about climate change in order to bolster the skeptical case.

141,"There is no evidence that I have found that shows the CIA giving materiel support directly to the Castanos' orgamizations: not to the ACCU autodefensas, nor the AUC autodefensas, nor to Los Pepes. 

Giving intel to Los Pepes, though, was a different matter.

The CIA station chief in Bogota at that time was Bill Wagner. First, here's a personal description from *Killing Pablo*, and then another excerpt describing the back-channel to Los Pepes:

&gt; If the hunt was going to turn ugly, the Americans in place knew how to get the job done. CIA chief Wagner was no stranger to the dark underside of South American affairs. He had begun his service in 1967 in Chile, leaving shortly before the agency-backed overthrow of socialist president Salvador Allende by Augusto Pinochet in 1973. Wagner had served in Uruguay battling the sophisticated Tupamaro urban guerrillas, and had then opened a CIA station in Haiti before becoming acting chief of the agency's Miami office, where he'd helped supervise operations in twenty-six nations, including Cuba. During his tenure in Miami, there were bloodless coups in Grenada (1979) and Suriname (1980). He was a reticent but worldly man, an avid gun collector and outdoorsman who didn't look the part, with his pale complexion, glasses, and easy, informal manner. But beneath his laid-back style, there was nothing passive about Wagner. He knew how to play hardball, both in the field and in Washington. He had been assigned to antinarcotics work up at headquarters in Langley, Virginia, back in the early eighties, before the agency got very interested in it, and in a few short years he had shepherded the effort into one of the agency's primary missions. One of his goals in Colombia was to establish a link between cocaine trafficking and the FARC and ELN, links that would justify pushing antinarcotics work from the realm of law enforcement into the realm of war. This was the bigger picture Wagner had had in mind when he arrived in Colombia in January 1991, and Pablo's escape a year and a half later had hastened the transition. Now Wagner had the kind of resources in Colombia needed to wage war against the narcos, and for him the hunt had become a full-time job.

---------------------------------------------------------------

&gt; Supplying intelligence to abet murder, such as the street address of a target who was subsequently killed, certainly appeared to be in violation of Executive Order 12333. Not all of the men in Bogotá were eager to hazard their careers and freedom on the legal opinion authored in 1989 by the Defense Department's legal counsel. So they were careful. Major Steve Jacoby turned his Centra Spike intelligence over to Wagner, and what happened to it after that was officially, as far as he was concerned, none of his business. Wagner passed along to the Colombian government the information he thought would be most helpful, but there was also an unofficial channel. The complete daily intelligence reports were collected in a red book that was left in an area where any official visitors to the embassy could check them out Colombian police officers paid regular visits. Everyone was pleased with the results Los Pepes produced. A DEA memo to Washington in April summed up the official attitude at the embassy:

&gt;&gt;The attacks by Los Pepes further demonstrate their resolve to violently retaliate against Escobar each and every time Escobar commits a terrorist attack against the GOC and/or the innocent citizens of Colombia. Although the actions are not condoned nor approved by the CNP nor the BCO [Bogotá country office, the U.S. embassy] they may persuade Escobar to curb such behavior for fear of losing members of his own family. Too, these types of attacks will seriously cut into those assets owned by Escobar and his associates.",2016-09-06 03:51:08+00:00,d7b3pud,1.0,t3_51cl8f,11225.0,narcos

1995's *Lopez* and 2000's *Morrison* were ""conservative"" opinions that curb-stomped the Gun-Free School Zones Act (not an appropriate use of federal commerce-clause authority) and Violence Against Women Act (ditto on commerce).

In [2005's *Raich*](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/supreme_court_dispatches/2004/11/dude_wheres_my_integrity.html), [O'Connor, Rehnquist](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-1454.ZD.html), and even Thomas ([yes, really](http://web.archive.org/web/20050804174843/http://wid.ap.org/scotus/pdf/03-1454P.ZD1.pdf)!) argued in favor of marijuana based on those two earlier cases. The staunchly anti-drug states of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi filed amicus briefs supporting Raich's right to marijuana free from Federal meddling.

 **Alas, they weren't in the majority, hence this case's non-landmark status.** 
Here's Thomas's separate dissent:

&gt; Respondents Diane Monson and Angel Raich use marijuana that has never been bought or sold, that has never crossed state lines, and that has had no demonstrable effect on the national market for marijuana. If Congress can regulate this under the Commerce Clause, then it can regulate virtually anything—and the Federal Government is no longer one of limited and enumerated powers.

&gt; Respondent's local cultivation and consumption of marijuana is not ""Commerce... among the several States.""

[...]

&gt; Certainly no evidence from the founding suggests that ""commerce"" included the mere possession of a good or some personal activity that did not involve trade or exchange for value. In the early days of the Republic, it would have been unthinkable that Congress could prohibit the local cultivation, possession, and consumption of marijuana.

[...]

&gt; If the Federal Government can regulate growing a half-dozen cannabis plants for personal consumption (not because it is interstate commerce, but because it is inextricably bound up with interstate commerce), then Congress' Article I powers – as expanded by the Necessary and Proper Clause – have no meaningful limits. Whether Congress aims at the possession of drugs, guns, or any number of other items, it may continue to ""appropria[te] state police powers under the guise of regulating commerce.""

[...]

&gt; If the majority is to be taken seriously, the Federal Government may now regulate quilting bees, clothes drives, and potluck suppers throughout the 50 States. This makes a mockery of Madison's assurance to the people of New York that the ""powers delegated"" to the Federal Government are ""few and defined"", while those of the States are ""numerous and indefinite.""",2016-09-01 17:48:44+00:00,d75nzis,1.0,t3_50mafg,31641.0,law

Next, I know you said ""cousin"" instead of ""sibling"", but let's explore the ""family relatives"" idea. You get half your DNA from your mom, and half from your dad. Since not every kid gets the SAME halves from his/her parents (they're mixed up), that's why siblings aren't identical.

[EASY-TO-READ SOURCE](http://genetics.thetech.org/ask/ask166) for the following:

&gt; When scientists say a mouse is 85% the same as we are, they mean that biochemically, we are that alike. Using this measure, siblings are actually 99.95% the same. The 50% refers more to the amount of DNA we get from mom and the amount we get from dad.

&gt; When scientists say we are 85% the same as a mouse, they are referring to the string of letters in a gene. This simply means that on average, if you compare a typical gene from mice to the equivalent gene in a human, 85% of their bases will be the same. Or if the gene was 1000 bases long, 150 bases would be different and 850 would be the same as the other. In other words we are 85% biochemically identical to a mouse.

&gt; How biochemically identical are we to our fellow humans? The **DNA sequence in your genes is on average 99.9% identical to ANY other human being.** Meaning, if you have a gene that is 1000 bases long, on average there will be only 1 base that is different between you.

Of that tiny portion of DNA that is different between humans, THAT is the part people mean when they say you share 50% with a sibling — 50% of 0.1% —, or 25% with an uncle, or 12.5% with a cousin. ",2016-08-15 16:42:23+00:00,d6ih7gm,1.0,t3_4xueht,796.0,explainlikeimfive

1) https://satyagraha.wordpress.com/2015/05/12/third-party-voting-and-kants-categorical-imperative/
&gt; ... voting the lesser evil cannot be moral according to Kant’s categorical imperative.

&gt; What about voting on principle? That would mean voting for the candidate whose platform best conforms to ones authentic beliefs and values, without worrying about who will actually win. If only you vote this way, granted, it may have little practical effect, except, perhaps, to register as dissent to the power elite and your fellow citizens (although these things aren’t trivial). But consider the categorical imperative: what if *everybody* voted this way? .... Without question, voting on principle does satisfy the categorical imperative, and therefore is moral.

&gt; The argument seems pretty clear. A further consideration is that voting itself ought to be regarded as a deeply important and inherently moral duty — something sacred. Our democracy is only as good as the moral conscientiousness of voters. Presidents and parties come and go, but a moral action is forever.

2) http://moralapologetics.com/when-conscience-trumps/
&gt; I’m thinking particularly of conservatives who can’t in good conscience vote for Donald Trump, but they are no less opposed to his competition. Such conservatives are finding themselves under increasing pressure to capitulate and support Trump despite their deep reservations.

&gt; Popular arguments along these lines come from evangelical leaders like Eric Metaxas who sees Trump as “the last best hope of keeping America from sliding into oblivion.” While Metaxas says that Christians “must” vote for Trump, Robert Jeffress does him one better, attributing to pride rather than conscientious principle the motivation for any Christian withholding support for Trump. ....

&gt; Such arguments leave many conservatives who cannot support Trump genuinely perplexed as to what to do. Despite their conviction, do they have an obligation to vote for the one [i.e., Trump] they, or others, consider the lesser of two evils?
....

&gt; They should, to our thinking, follow their conscience, and either refrain from voting or vote for a third candidate. Admittedly, doing so may result in, or at least contribute to, a bad outcome. But allowing that consideration to, well, trump would represent a tacit acceptance of an objectionably consequentialist approach to ethics.

3) http://www.nationalreview.com/article/435992/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-voting-your-conscience

&gt; Self-righteous unseriousness about consequences is one peril to be avoided in bracing moral deliberations. There is another, however. When pressed by fractious political circumstances, we must resist the temptation to bury our moral agency under pragmatic calculations. Virtuous, upright living is not some trivial side project along the path to world domination. It is itself the goal of human existence. ....

&gt; Voting is one example of a moral act. If I vote for Donald Trump, I will have supported Donald Trump. That choice has moral implications that affect my psychology and character, whether or not I willingly acknowledge the fact. Perhaps it is a justifiable choice that can be harmonized with my broader moral commitments. Still, if I re-frame the decision in my mind as nothing more than a strike against Hillary Clinton, I am engaging in self-deception. When we feel compelled to describe our actions in terms of their secondary implications, that’s usually a sign that we’re not acting in good faith.  ....

&gt; When questions of conscience arise in the political realm, we frequently find ourselves in awkward debates about the relative value of a clean conscience as compared to some desirable political goal. Which matters more: your feelings of guilt or a healthy judiciary? ....

&gt; This is presumably why Jonah Goldberg declares that he won’t vote for Trump even though he would, if personally empowered, send Trump rather than Clinton to the White House. Were a single man actually entrusted with presidential king-making, his choice would presumably be heavily focused on the relative merits of the available candidates. That, however, is not how our electoral system works. Goldberg’s actual vote (along with those of the handful of #NeverTrump intellectuals and pundits) is of no real consequence. What others demand of him is help in unifying the party behind “the presumptive nominee.” Helping to shepherd others toward such a deeply objectionable candidate might, for some, constitute an unacceptable attack on their personal integrity. Unless we have lost all regard for their opinions, we should respect fellow conservatives’ considered claim that, for them, it does.

If your conscience tells you that it is wrong to vote for Donald Trump and you vote for him anyway, then you sinned. So unless you can vote for Donald Trump without your conscience condemning you, then you should not vote for him.

&gt; My fond regard for these two good and thoughtful friends [1 will vote for trump, the other for clinton], lifelong conservatives both, is not diminished by our disagreements. And I do disagree with both of them. For my part, my conscience is more important to me than the outcome of this presidential election. I cannot in good conscience vote for either Clinton or Trump. What matters for me is that I cannot bring myself to intend, to will the victory of either of these ludicrously unacceptable presidential candidates. And that is what a vote for one of them would be—an act of willing that Clinton or Trump be president, carry out her or his stated policy aims, and bring his or her fundamentally bad character to the highest office in the land.

&gt; “The purpose of voting is not to express your fidelity to a worldview. It’s not to wave a flag or paint your face in team colors; it’s to produce outcomes,” says Jason Brennan, a philosopher at Georgetown University and author of The Ethics of Voting. “If they’re smart, they’ll vote for the candidate likely to best produce the outcome they want. That might very well be compromising, but if voting for a far-left or far-right candidate means that you’re just going to lose the election, then you’ve brought the world further away from justice rather than closer to it.”

&gt; Let's take a step back. One thing we know from previous elections is that third party voters typically would not vote at all rather than vote for a major party candidate. They are not committed to showing up to vote, period. Rather, they are showing up to vote in order to vote third party. If they weren't going to vote third party, they'd play video games instead.

1.3) Michael LaBossiere, who was also quoted in the QZ article, has more to add:  http://blog.talkingphilosophy.com/?p=9701
&gt; .... As such, she [Hillary Clinton] can be counted on as a competent business as usual politician who will march along with the majority of the population in regards to social policy (such as same sex marriage and gun regulation). Trump has no experience in office and I have no real idea what he would do as president. As such, I am taking the classic approach of choosing the lesser evil and the devil I know. ....

&gt; Perhaps the best known [3rd party candidate] is libertarian Gary Johnson. He received 1% of the popular vote in 2012 and is polling in the double digits in some polls. It is all but certain that he will not win, thus a vote for Johnson merely helps either Trump or Hillary get elected (depending on whether the person would have otherwise voted for one of them). ....

&gt; Like the approach I took in the interview, the argument for voting third party can be based on utilitarian considerations (one can also make a deontological argument based on the notion of a duty to vote one’s conscience). The difference is that the vote for the third party would be justified by the hope of long term consequences. To be specific, the justification would be that voting for a third party candidate could allow the greater evil to win this election. And the next election. And probably several more elections after that. But, eventually, the lockdown on politics by Democrats and Republicans could be broken by a viable third party. ..... There is also the concern about whether any third party candidate is better than a lesser evil.

&gt; The broader lesson to be drawn is not to shy away from confronting the dominance of the political system under the management of the two major parties. Rather, challenges to it need to be issued with a full awareness of their possible consequences. This includes the recognition that far right victories not only impose terrible suffering on the most vulnerable segments of society but also function as a powerful weapon in the hands of the establishment center, which, now in opposition can posture as the “reasonable” alternative. A Trump presidency, should it materialize, will undermine the burgeoning movement centered around the Sanders campaign, particularly if it is perceived as having minimized the dangers posed by the far right.

&gt; A more general conclusion to be derived from this recognition is that this sort of cost/benefit strategic accounting is fundamental to any politics which is serious about radical change. Those on the left who ignore it, or dismiss it as irrelevant are engaging in political fantasy and are an obstacle to, rather than ally of, the movement which now seems to be materializing.

&gt; Imagine an election where the only options are Queen Cersei from Game of Thrones, and Sauron, the Dark Lord from Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings. If Cersei wins, she will kill many innocent people, and oppress others. But she will leave much of the population more or less alone (as long as they don’t openly oppose her or threaten her family in any way). If Sauron wins, he will kill far more innocent people, and make the survivors his slaves.

&gt; You can instead cast a protest vote for a vastly better alternative, such as Gandalf or Daenerys Targaryen. But, by assumption, these are purely symbolic options, because they have zero chance of prevailing. If the protest voter **would otherwise have backed Cersei**, the net effect of his decision to protest is to increase the likelihood of the worst possible outcome: the triumph of Sauron.",2016-08-10 15:15:37+00:00,d6bvqks,2.0,t1_d6bvpsl,29.0,confession

However, you're allowed to disagree. The question you must ask yourself is, What is the reason why am I voting? Is it to (negligibly) influence the outcome of a political process, or is my vote an act of individual moral self-expression?

EDIT: as you can see by the linked excerpts below, there is plenty of room for disagreement. There are left- and right-wing conscience voters, and left- and right-wing pragmatist voters. And there are professional philosophers whose job it is to argue what course to follow, moral or pragmatic. And they can disagree.

EDIT: u/keyilan has a good description of backlash **after** the war, which would probably a better question for OP to have asked.

&gt; Large-scale Vietnamese migration to the United States started as an influx of refugees following the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. Early refugees were part of a U.S.-sponsored evacuation and consisted mainly of military personnel and urban, well-educated professionals associated with the U.S. military or the South Vietnamese government. 

&gt; In contrast, a second wave of Vietnamese refugees, commonly known as “boat people,” arrived in the late 1970s. The majority of these arrivals came from rural areas and were often less educated. Many of the Vietnamese refugees who arrived in the United States between 1983 and 2004 were initially resettled in states with large immigrant populations, including California, Texas, and Washington State—a fact largely reflected by the geographic distribution of Vietnamese immigrants today.

The most publicized anti-Vietnamese incident happened in Seadrift, TX where in 1979 a shrimpboater was killed by another Vietnamese shrimper.

However, when it comes to more general anti-Asian-American bias, there have been health-driven studies ([bibliography at page's end](http://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/treatment/cultural/ptsd-minority-vets.asp)) examining racial stressors contributing to PTSD, in which Vietnam veterans of Asian American/Pacific Islander heritage reported discrimination because they were identified with the enemy. These incidents might occur stateside or deployed in Vietnam. A Japanese-American soldier reported that:

&gt; he didn’t have problems with the men in his unit but often heard slurs from other enlisted Americans. When he was injured, military Medevac personnel assumed he was Vietnamese and nearly delayed his evacuation until all the solders they thought were American had been flown out.

&gt; “I got really upset, I started yelling back, ‘I’m an American. You get my ass out of here now,’” said the San Rafael, Calif., resident.

&gt; SANDERS: Well, first of all, let's look at the facts. The facts that are very simple. Republicans win when there is a low voter turnout, and that is what happened last November.

&gt; Sixty-three percent of the American people didn't vote, Anderson. Eighty percent of young people didn't vote. We are bringing out huge turnouts, and creating excitement all over this country.

&gt; Democrats at the White House on down will win, when there is excitement and a large voter turnout, and that is what this campaign is doing.

Durham in February:

&gt; Republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small voter turnout, which by the way is why they love voter suppression. I believe that our campaign up to now has shown that we can create an enormous amount of enthusiasm from working people, from young people, who will get involved in the political process and which will drive us to a very large voter turnout.

&gt;...SANDERS: I agree with what the secretary [clinton] said. We shouldn't be getting ahead of ourselves [about who will win at the Philly convention]. And as I have said many times, you know, sometimes in these campaigns, things get a little bit out of hand. **I happen to respect the secretary very much, I hope it's mutual. And on our worst days, I think it is fair to say we are 100 times better than any Republican candidate. [applause]**

Actually, reading the democratic debates makes me feel better about this now-constant news of ""shills v busters"" and intra-progressive fighting.

&gt; I am very, very grateful to have been able to be on this stage with this distinguished group of candidates tonight.

&gt; The only window into Trump’s handling of his income taxes came during the 1981 New Jersey gambling commission report.

&gt; Trump had submitted his 1978 and 1979 returns to the regulators as part of an application for a casino license. State records summarizing the returns show that Trump claimed that his combined income during those two years was negative $3.8 million, allowing him to pay no taxes. A few years earlier, he had told the New York Times he was worth more than $200 million.

&gt; So really, if you give it some thought, implying the AK was copied from the StG is like saying the M16 was copied from the FAL. It's ridiculous. **However, the AK was almost certainly inspired by the StG... as many other weapons have been inspired by the AK**. That's how firearms design works, folks; you take something that's good, and you see if you can make it better.

Regarding Schmeisser's contributions:

It does not matter when Avtomat work started, because Rifle R&amp;D — and to a greater extent Soviet tech in general — did not care about the niceties of provenance or intellectual property (it all belonged to the state anyhow). If good new ideas appeared in the last year of development, they would be added, no matter how long the design had been in progress. (See also Bulkin from Tula and Lyuty from Schurovo, whose late-stage contributions were expunged from the official record)


&gt; Schmeisser lived in Izhevsk during pivotal years of the rifle’s refinement. Neither the Soviet Union nor Russia has been forthcoming with details of his work. His contributions, if any, remain a historical question mark.16 A pair of rival views predominates. One says that there could be no explanation for Schmeisser’s presence in Izhevsk, of all places in the Soviet space, except to capitalize on his knowledge of assault rifles and the nuances of their mass production. It could not be a coincidence, in other words, that the preeminent German assault-rifle designer happened to be in the city where the Soviet Union sought to replicate his work. 

&gt; The other view holds that Schmeisser, as a foreigner, was not allowed near the early AK-47, the technical details of which in the late 1940s and early 1950s were still classified. His presence in Izhevsk, in this view, was to work on well-established weapons. Shirayev took this position. “The only thing Schmeisser did in Izhevsk was learn to drink vodka,” he said.17

EDIT: on mobile. Note 16: Personal communication to author in July 2009 from Norbert Moczarski, a German biographer of Schmeisser. Almost twenty years after the end of the Soviet Union, Schmeisser’s activities at the time of the AK-47’s development remain shrouded. There is no question of his presence in Izhevsk during the 1950s. But the Soviet archives have not been opened to allow an examination of how Schmeisser passed his time there and the reasons he had been sent to such a place. His biographers in Germany remain unsure what role, if any, he played in the development of the Kalashnikov prototypes, the fine-tuning and mass production of the AK-47 design, and the tooling of the Izhmash assembly line.

203,"Oh yes. The case is Jordan v. New London (2000 U.S. App. Lexis 26351)


&gt;    On March 16, 1996, plaintiff Robert Jordan and 500 other applicants underwent a written screening process conducted by the Law Enforcement Council of  Southeastern Connecticut, Inc. (“LEC”), a coalition of fourteen cities and towns, for a position as a police officer. That testing process operated as an initial screen for participating police departments. The testing material included the Wonderlic Personnel Test and Scholastic Level Exam (“WPT”), which purports to measure cognitive ability. An accompanying manual listed recommended scores for various professions and cautioned that because overqualified candidates may soon become bored with unchallenging work and quit, “simply hiring the highest scoring employee can be self-defeating.” Jordan scored a 33 on the WPT, above the median for any listed occupation, and well over the normative median of 21 suggested for a police patrol officer.
 

&gt;   In the fall of 1996, Jordan learned that the city of New London was interviewing candidates. Upon further inquiry, however, he learned from assistant city manager Keith Harrigan that he would not be interviewed because he “didn’t fit the profile.” Plaintiff, who was 46 years old, suspected age discrimination and filed an administrative complaint with the Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities. The city responded that it removed Jordan from consideration because he scored a 33 on the WPT, and that to prevent frequent job turnover caused by hiring overqualified applicants the city only interviewed candidates who scored between 20 and 27.

&gt; Jordan, a 49-year-old college graduate, took the [[Wonderlic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonderlic_test)] exam in 1996 and scored 33 points, the equivalent of an IQ of 125. But New London police interviewed only candidates who scored 20 to 27, on the theory that those who scored too high could get bored with police work and leave soon after undergoing costly training.

&gt;The average score nationally for police officers is 21 to 22, the equivalent of an IQ of 104, or just a little above average.

&gt;Jordan alleged his rejection from the police force was discrimination. He sued the city, saying his civil rights were violated because he was denied equal protection under the law.

&gt;But the U.S. District Court found that New London had “shown a rational basis for the policy.” In a ruling dated Aug. 23, the 2nd Circuit agreed. The court said the policy might be unwise but was a rational way to reduce job turnover.

excerpt from the same link that /u/ArundelvalEstar posted: [Compliance Policy Guidance Sec. 230.150 Blood Donor Classification Statement, Paid or Volunteer Donor](http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/ucm122798.htm)


&gt; The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) has reviewed a number of actual donor incentives and describes below its findings on whether the incentive would require the blood to have the ""paid donor"" classification statement. It is important to remember that these conclusions were based on the facts of a particular case and that the facts of a different scenario may result in a different determination of whether the blood should be labeled as collected from a **paid** or **volunteer** donor.
&gt; 
&gt; **Event tickets**
&gt; If the tickets or vouchers are transferable, whether a market for the tickets exists is an important factor. It is well known that a market exists for tickets to many professional and collegiate sports events. The market is usually an easily accessible one, as it is common to see potential sellers and buyers of tickets at the entrance to the sports facility prior to an event. Generally, tickets or vouchers to sporting events would require blood to have a ""paid donor"" label statement.

&gt; Tickets or vouchers for other events may or may not require a paid donor label, depending on whether the tickets or vouchers are transferable, convertible to cash, and whether a market exists for the ticket. Free tickets for movie theaters are generally not readily convertible to cash, so generally may be considered benefits that would not require a ""paid donor"" label. Ticket vouchers for symphony or opera performances may require a ""paid donor"" label to be placed on the products if an accessible market exists for the tickets and they are transferable.",2016-07-12 04:46:04+00:00,d58ucyl,2.0,t1_d5822f1,42578.0,legaladvice

You're thinking of two rules, the Fairness Doctrine and the Equal Time rule.  (nothing to do with public funding rules)

The fairness doctrine applied to holders of broadcast licenses, i.e. legit tv networks. It required airing contrasting views on controversial topics. It was killed in the '80s although it was not formally repealed until 2011.

The equal time rule is about political candidates, and ironically does not require literal equal time. It mandates that broadcasters must give equal opportunity of time and price to competing candidates: your local radio station can't sell ten 90-second ad spots to Bush for one price, and tell Gore that there's only one ad spot left and it'll cost triple what Bush paid.

Furthermore, 

&gt; Now there are another group of crimes called strict liability crimes which do not require any mens rea in order to constitute an offence. That means that you can be found guilty for merely committing the act. Now a typical example of a strict liability crime is drunk driving. A drunk driver can be convicted and punished whatever was or wasn’t on his or her mind. The only thing that must be proved is the actus reus, that you were driving a car while you were under the influence of alcohol.

""In the late 1940s, the United States air force had a serious problem: its pilots could not keep control of their planes. Although this was the dawn of jet-powered aviation and the planes were faster and more complicated to fly, the problems were so frequent and involved so many different aircraft that the air force had an alarming, life-or-death mystery on its hands. “It was a difficult time to be flying,” one retired airman told me. “You never knew if you were going to end up in the dirt.” At its worst point, 17 pilots crashed in a single day.""

&gt; ... Out of 4,063 pilots, not a single airman fit within the average range on all 10 dimensions. One pilot might have a longer-than-average arm length, but a shorter-than-average leg length. Another pilot might have a big chest but small hips. Even more astonishing, Daniels discovered that if you picked out just three of the ten dimensions of size — say, neck circumference, thigh circumference and wrist circumference — less than 3.5 per cent of pilots would be average sized on all three dimensions. Daniels’s findings were clear and incontrovertible. There was no such thing as an average pilot.

Pls correct me...

(EDIT: [found a better explanation](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/the-rise-of-victimhood-culture/404794) of the thing I tried to explain below)

~~First, honor is something to fight for, with violence if need be. Get insulted? Duel! Lose your social standing? Seppuku! Was your daughter raped? Kill her, or Rape the offender's daughter back! Did a girl reject you? Throw acid in her face! As you can see, this is generally repugnant to modern sensibilities.
2. Dignity culture is about individual value and law &amp; order. Call the police if someone hurts your person or property. The offenders will be punished by the state, while you go on with your life. If someone uses insulting words, so what? They're not Sticks and stones. Not real violence.
3. Victimhood culture: hurtful ideas demand retribution again. Crimes are still crimes, but hurtful words are thoughtcrimes. Appeal to your political/geographic/demographic/etc tribe to condemn the person who offended you--you're the victim; you're entitled to life without being offended, but now that you're already hurt, you're entitled to see that horrible person Internet-shamed.~~

---------------------------------------------------------


And here's u/bruceki's excellent comment from last year: 

QUOTE

I can't speak to how it is in other parts of the country, but this is the situation in western washington

Most farmers in the area will cheerfully sell you a whole, half or quarter beef. The price that they offer the beef at is the price that they've agonized over; it's enough to make a profit, but not much of one, and generally speaking they'd appreciate it if you paid that price. if you knock off 5% it doesn't make much difference to you as a consumer but it sure does make a difference at the farm, as that's usually just profit. the costs of raising a steer are fixed. If they give you $20 off it's $20 out of their pocket.

I know you want grain-finished, and that's what I like too, but for those folks who want grass fed, If you want to buy right, I'd suggest buying beef as the seasonal product that it is. That is, talk to a farmer now, but take your beef at the end of the grass growing season after the animal has been on lush green new growth for a few months. buying now, when they're on hay, isn't the best time of year for grass fed. for grain finished it's fine, but I think you'll like the end-of-summer early-fall grass fed better than the end-of-winter early-spring grass (hay) fed.

Supermarkets have given people the impression that beef, chicken, lamb and pork aren't seasonal. they aren't if you're raising them in a feedlot or a building. But if you want great, buy the animal when it's in season, and for beef around here that means between august and october or so.

With grain fed beef, there are lots of small farms that produce them, and they're usually selling to family, friends and existing customers, as their product is pretty small -- think 6 to 10 steers a year, that sort of number. a big operation might have 30 to 50 animals that they sell. Your local craigslist will be a good starting point to find a local farm producing beef, but all producers aren't the same. Some of the best small ranchers in my area are old guys who haven't figured out email yet. how do you find those guys? Drive in rural areas and look for the little signs ""beef, xxx-xxx-xxxx"" or call your local livestock auction and ask the auction staff about people raising beef for sale (sometimes the auction location will have signs on the wall ""josh willis family, quality angus xxx-xxx-xxxx"" ).

So you want to ask about quality, and here's what I'd ask the rancher:
What breed of cattle are you selling? -- I'd want a beef breed, honestly. better yield (more meat, less bone weight) and usually better carcass quality. Holstein (dairy) cattle steers make fine beef, but pound for pound you're better off with a beef breed. angus - red or black, hereford, brahma, limousine, simmental. Not jersey, guernsey, holstein or crossbreds of those. some beef-dairy cross are good; i'm eating a holstein/angus cross myself, but at retail I might as well ask for the best.

how old are they usually at slaughter? Younger is usually more tender. 18-24 months. do you use growth hormones in ear tags, or feed supplements (I would steer clear of optaflex-optiflex/zilmax as they tend to make beef taste like cardboard IMO) whats your cows diet like (some beef folks feed their cows food waste of some sort. I'd prefer a corn silage/hay mostly forage diet, but you might not care) and the final question is to ask them if you can buy a steak and a few pounds of hamburger and a roast (pay retail) to try out the beef. many ranchers will give you a small sample, and if they do eat it before you make a purchase decision. make sure it's what you want. your cow won't be the cow you're eating, but it'll be similar, and it's better than buying in the dark.

All of these questions will take time and effort by the rancher to answer, so back to the price; pay the man for his work and he'll go above-and-beyond for you, too.

excerpt from http://www.vox.com/2015/3/2/8120063/american-democracy-doomed

&gt; The Honduras scenario

&gt; Not all breakdowns of constitutional processes are as violent as the American Civil War.

&gt; For a less catastrophic, more realistic view of the kind of thing that could happen here, it's useful to look to some less-familiar but more-recent events in Honduras. Back in late 2008, left-wing President Manuel Zelaya was locked in persistent conflict with an opposition-controlled congress. With neither side able to prevail within the context of the existing system, Zelaya decided he wanted to add a fourth question to the upcoming November 2009 election. In addition to voting for president, congress, and municipal offices, Zelaya would ask the voters whether they wanted to hold a constituent assembly to re-write the constitution — presumably to allow him to run for re-election.

&gt; Unfortunately for Zelaya, Honduras' existing constitution made no provision for re-writing the constitution by plebiscite. Consequently, in March 2009, Zelaya determined that the solution was to hold another plebiscite. On June 28, Hondurans would go to the polls to vote in a non-binding referendum on whether the constitutional question should be added to the November ballot. This, he hoped, would give him the democratic legitimacy needed to go forward with the constitutional revision.

&gt; Zelaya's opponents in congress, evidently concerned that the president would win, sued. They won a court case enjoining the president against holding the referendum. Zelaya pressed ahead regardless.

&gt; In Honduras, the military typically assists with election logistics, so Zelaya ordered the army to begin distributing ballots. General Romeo Vásquez Velásquez, the chief the Honduran military, refused to comply. On May 24, Zelaya fired the general. Several other commanders quit in solidarity. The Supreme Court ruled that the dismissal was unconstitutional. Throughout June, the constitutional process essentially broke down with protests and counter-protests dominating the capital. On June 28, the military deposed Zelaya in a coup, retroactively justified by a back-dated Supreme Court ruling. Roberto Micheletti, the president of the National Congress, was installed in his stead.

oh you sweet summer child, it is a serious concern LOL

From http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/latin-american-business/el-nino-drought-casts-shadow-over-panama-canal-expansion-opening/article29559669/ April 2016:

&gt; El Nino has caused a drought in the region and reduced water levels in the lake that makes up about half the 77-kilometre water route, forcing the canal’s operators to limit the draft of a ship – the hull’s depth – that can sail the trade route connecting Atlantic and Pacific oceans.

&gt; The restrictions cast a shadow over the opening of the expanded canal, which Panama Canal Authority has pushed back – again – to June.


http://watercrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-21-at-11.28.12-AM.png

From  http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/a1277/4212183/ September 2009:

&gt; Even in a tropical country receiving more than 100 in. of rainfall annually, the biggest challenge facing engineers is the need to save water -- an increasingly scarce resource in Panama. ""The problem isn't rainfall,"" BenÃ­tez notes, ""but storage."" Man-made Gatun Lake is a 166-square-mile reservoir that is replenished during the country's seven-month rainy season. But the canal watershed supplies drinking water to 95 percent of the population around the waterway, and deforestation has affected the quality and quantity of the runoff.

&gt; The biggest tax on the water supply, though, is the canal itself. It requires, on average, more than 2 billion gal. per day to fill the locks for passing ships. An expansion plan that included bigger locks with a traditional design would have doubled water consumption. One way to address the problem -- build dams to create new reservoirs -- was a nonstarter. It would have meant relocating residents, even entire communities, which was politically unpalatable.

&gt; Then, in 1999, canal officials visited the Hohenwarthe Locks on the Elbe River in Germany and saw a solution: locks that recycled some of the water used in transits. ""It was one of those 'Aha!' moments,"" says RaÃºl Brostella, an ACP port captain. ""In effect, you are able to reuse water that would otherwise be flushed out to sea.""

From http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87851345 March 2008:

&gt; Mr. DE LA GUARDIA: Yeah, a transiter, a full transiter going from the Pacific or the Atlantic Oceans, from ocean to ocean will take about 55 million gallons of fresh water.

&gt; HAMILTON: The Panama Canal already consumes three times as much water in a day as the city of Los Angeles. When the new lane for big ships is built, the canal will need even more. The question is, will there be enough? Stanley Heckadon-Moreno works at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama City. He says the lakes that feed the canal are vulnerable to the climate fluctuation known as el Nino.

&gt; HAMILTON: El Ninos in 1997 and 1998 left the canal so short of water that ships had to unload part of their cargo to keep from running aground. It was the worst drought in the canals history and it disrupted shipping around the world. No one really knows whether climate change is going to make el Ninos more frequent, but Heckadon sees some ominous trends.

&gt; Mr. CARLOS VARGAS (Panama Canal Authority, Manager, Meteorological and Hydrographic Branch): It is very important because we all know that the canal depends on water. If it doesn't rain we don't have enough water for the operation of the canal, so we have to take it very seriously.

&gt; HAMILTON: The plan calls for storing more water in lakes, and perhaps using less water to generate electric power. And the most important hedge against a water shortage is the new locks themselves. The ones in the lane for big ships will use a design that recycles 60 percent of the water.

346,"I have to correct you here, because your statement is misleading:

&gt; The lake is fed by rain water so it sort of an unlimited supply of water

Yes, it's renewable by rain, but still not unlimited (this principle applies to all freshwater sources, such as the Colorado river or the San Joaquin). If the volume of canal traffic is high enough, then the lake level drops, lock water is rationed, and canal traffic is restricted until the lake is replenished via rain.

(EDIT TO ADD: The Panama Canal is currently going through an expansion that will upgrade the locks to reuse 60% of the water, YAY! rather than letting it run directly out to the sea; however, these locks upgrades are not finished yet. http://micanaldepanama.com/expansion/faq/)

Hell, there was an announcement only last month:

&gt; The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) announced a second draught restriction for the Canal due to drought caused by the El Niño phenomenon.

&gt; The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) will continue to monitor and manage the water levels. The Panama Canal will eliminate these draught restrictions as soon as Gatun Lake level returns to normal.As always, these are temporary and preventive measures to ensure the continuous and safe operations of the canal. The ACP said it remained fully committed to responsible management of its water resources and the protection of the waterway. [SOURCE](http://www.seatrade-maritime.com/news/americas/panama-canal-announces-second-draught-restriction.html)

&gt; These temporary and preventive measures will be taken due to an anticipated climatic variability event related to El Niño, a climate phenomenon resulting in periodic warming of the tropical Pacific Ocean. When this occurs, El Niño changes the pattern of rainfall in many regions of the planet. In this case, it has triggered a drought in the Canal Watershed, causing the water levels of Gatun and Alhajuela Lakes to fall substantially below their average for this time of year.

We can certainly try to fix the toxic parts of our energy infrastructure, and yes we should!

ABSOLUTELY NOT. Energy is ""produced"" (thermodynamicists, shut up, you know what I mean) because there is a demand for generation. It is foolishness to ignore the demand side and expect improved supply exclusively.

But [the reverse conversion](https://www.ncua.gov/services/Pages/field-of-membership-chartering/conversions.aspx), i.e. from Mesa Verde Bank &amp; Trust to Mesa Credit Union, is bizarre and [as this article points out, extremely rare](http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/blog/banking/2012/11/thrivent-bank-converts-to-credit-union.html) (excerpt below).

So I had thought Paige and Kim were best buds (like study buddies at UNM-Law), but if their relationship isn't as tight as that (see below), then that makes more sense: Kim is willing to have Paige stick her neck out for her, in front of Kevin the bank boss man, to say that ""Yessir, Kim Solo can handle this very complex expansion that a big firm should be doing"" because that would be the **only** work MV has in play. 
Mostly, though, I wonder how much Kim was involved with MV because in ""Bali Hai"" we saw her at a meeting with Paige and Kevin, and also arguing Sandpiper motions in that empty courtroom.

Do you think HHM does all Mesa Verde's legal work, like Labor &amp; employment law, or their tax law, or going after their outstanding debtors?

In that situation, I see far too much business for a solo practitioner. Even the MV expansion into Scottsdale seems like too much for Kim Wexler to handle. Surely Jimmy, when peeking into those files at Chuck's house, would have been aware that she wouldn't perform legal work for the client of the same quality or volume as HHM? 

In her interview with S&amp;C last episode, she talks about a recent divorce case that was ""quite complex"".
It was a litigation in the context of a divorce: Kim's client was ""suing her former company, which she and her ex had split in their settlement."" I'm not sure what the legal issues involved would have been, but apparently she needed to chase case law for weeks. That's not the same as familiarity with regulations, especially in the financial industry (Chuck's humblebrag pitch was very convincing, and I was pleased to hear mention of the banking terms like Community Reinvestment Act, which matters during bank expansion, and [Sarbanes--Oxley](http://i.imgur.com/nido04b.png).) 

She waited to poach a client from Howard until she gave written notice--good for her-- but she shouldn't have tried in the first place. given her understatement from ""Inflatable"": ""It'll be a hard sell to take them with me.""

Is Kimmy slipping?

Did Howard think that forgiving her student debt repayment would guilt her into not poaching MV? I guess if he called the client at MV immediately after, he takes the poaching possibility seriously, which is strange to believe. Why wouldn't she poach smaller clients? Is it because she feels like MV is ""hers"" more than any other clients who are ""HHM's""?

I am not a Lawyer (I just second-guess the lawyers on tv shows).

&gt; One plane had a pair of Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000s mounted under the wings, revealing its United lineage.

&gt; Like the engines, the cabin crews on those planes also cannot be interchanged. While all flight attendants for United wear similar uniforms, those who came from Continental are not allowed to mix with those who worked for pre-merger United. Every flight has either all United or all Continental cabin crews, requiring the now-combined airline to keep several flight attendants from both sides of the arranged corporate marriage on standby to fill in when someone is sick, late or fails to show up.

a reply from askhistorians, copied from [link](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3y7ige/native_american_alcohol_did_it_exist_before/):

&gt;There are plenty of examples of American civilizations preparing and consuming alcoholic beverages before the arrival of Europeans. In Mesoamerica, mezcal and (thanks for the correction u/400-Rabbits ) pulque was an alcoholic beverages made from the agave plant. Admittedly I don't know how far back the history of this drink goes, but I can tell you that it was prepared and consumed long before Europeans arrived. Interestingly enough though, it was produced using a different operational chain than standard beers. Grain - used to make beer - is a complex carbohydrate that will not ferment naturally; an intermediate step is needed to begin the fermentation process, namely malting. In contrast to this, the flower harvested from the agave plant is capable of natural fermentation.

&gt; Certain Andean civilizations brewed chicha, again long before the Europeans arrived. It would be produced by chewing on harvested maize; the enzymes contained within saliva would begin the malting process allowing the maize to ferment. In this way the steps needed to produce chicha resembled those required to manufacture beer more so than mezcal or pulque did as this operational chain uses an intermediary step; maize would not ferment without the addition of saliva. This drink appears to have been quite popular. In fact, archaeologists recently discovered a sizable chicha factory around Cerro Baul, suggesting there was a certain need to produce this beverage on an industrial scale.

446,"If the original movie was made at a time when Hollywood was all white, then it should be different nowadays. For example, during the golden era of Western  filmmaking, all the cowboys are white characters played by white actors. However, there were many black cowboys in actual history (perhaps 1 in 4 Texas Cowboys were black) who are simply absent from depictions of that era—making movies with black actors in ""equal"" roles was a nonstarter back then. But now it should be fine to remake a western with nonwhite actors; it would be more historically accurate that way. Then there's the actors in red face playing Indians, but that's a separate problem...

Another chance was the casting of *Khan Singh* in the recent Star Trek movie. It was too bad that an Indian wasn't cast in the remake; at least in the Original Series they cast a Hispanic actor.

&gt;“Leading 8-0 in a regular season game against the Astros, Maddux threw what he had said he would never throw to Jeff Bagwell-a fastball in. Bagwell did what Maddux wanted him to do: he homered. So two weeks later, when Maddux was facing Bagwell in a close game, Bagwell was looking for a fastball in, and Maddux fanned him on a change-up away.”
 
&gt; This is what I call the “Bagwell gambit,” allowing a batter to get a hit in a lopsided game to get him looking for a certain pitch in a close game later on (and then get him out on some other pitch). Before looking into the question of whether or not Maddux really makes a habit of doing this, I first look at what happened when Bagwell has homered against Maddux and if it led to a key strikeout in a later game.

On page 3, it says teachers are exempt even if they do not meet the ""salary basis test"" of $455 per week, and this includes academic teaching as well as coaching or other extracurricular work. That tells me you are with exemptees whose ""primary duty is teaching, tutoring, instructing or lecturing in the activity of imparting knowledge, and if they are employed and engaged in this activity as a teacher in an educational establishment.""

Next, **[California Minimum Wage](http://www.dir.ca.gov/Iwc/MW-2014.pdf)**:

* Every employer shall pay to each employee wages not less than eight dollars ($8.00) per hour for all hours worked, effective January 1, 2008, 
* not less than nine dollars ($9.00) per hour for all hours worked, effective July 1, 2014, 
* and not less than ten dollars ($10.00) per hour for all hours worked, effective January 1, 2016.

Well, maybe you're non-exempt according to State Law?

[California Labor Code section 515.8](http://law.onecle.com/california/labor/515.8.html), enacted in **2006**, is our guide here. The usual exemptions for teachers, similar to federal (EDIT: but more narrowly-defined than federal) teacher exemptions, are here. But there's this too:
&gt;   (3) The employee earns a monthly salary equivalent to no less than
two times the state minimum wage for full-time employment.

Here's the definition of [full time employment, in 515(c)](http://law.onecle.com/california/labor/515.html):
&gt; (c) For the purposes of subdivision (a), ""full-time employment"" means employment in which an employee is employed for 40 hours per week.

So far, so good. (Now, for the next step to work, you have to work for this school only 10 months of the year, not 12. If they place year-round labor demands on you, check with a lawyer because they should have no business putting you on a 10 month pay period, in the first place.)

Ok, 40 hours per week X 52 weeks per year = 2080 hours per year. That X $10 per hour = $20,800. That X 2 = $41,600 per year, the salary cutoff for being an exempt teacher under state law.

But wait! You're not a employee for 2 months of the year, because work is unavailable in the summer! So we take 10/12 ~~304/365~~ of that salary amount, which is **$34,666.67**. If you make less than that, by my reckoning, you're not exempted by state law.

You are paid approximately $28,000 + $6,000 = $34,000 for approximately 304 days of labor per year, right? If I were the school's HR, I'd just pay the $647 shortfall to preserve your exemption from state minimum wage, and then it'd be back to business as usual.

Check out this link! It seems to ignore my ""unavailability of work"" reasoning based on a 10-month work-year:

[Here's](http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=057521c7-67bc-4bee-9d1f-c3219b6e25b4) a business-oriented essay about it from lexology: 
&gt; On appeal, the divided Ninth Circuit panel distinguished the Woody Woo decision by noting that Woody Woo was decided on the statutory language alone — it contained no discussion of the proper measure of deference to agency regulations because, at the time of the decision, there were no agency regulations. 


(the relevant precedent was Cumbie v Woody Woo, which is summarized [here](http://www.gordonrees.com/publications/2010/restaurant-tip-pool-that-gives-greater-proportion-of-tips-to-kitchen-staff-is-valid-when-employer-does-not-take-tip-credit).)

Finally, the dissenting opinion has a harsh opening line: 
&gt; N.R. SMITH, Circuit Judge, dissenting:
Colleagues, even if you don’t like circuit precedent, you
must follow it. Afterwards, you call the case en banc. You
cannot create your own contrary precedent.1
This case is nothing more than Cumbie II.

482,"Hey, thanks for the update. The decision itself is good news. I'm sorry that my previous comment was so rude. I meant to say that until the most recent decision was handed down, laws against  restaurant redistribution of tips were unenforceable -- and an unenforced law offers as much protection as the sheet of paper it's printed on.

Upon re-read, I wonder what you meant about the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals being the most overturned Court? In the context, because the active appeal was from Oregon District's federal court, I thought at the time you were talking nonsense; the 9th Circuit has a within-normal rate of reversing lower court decisions ([surpassed by the 1st, 7th, and DC circuits](http://www.uscourts.gov/statistics/table/b-5/statistical-tables-federal-judiciary/2015/06/30)).

However, it is commonly known that the Supreme Court reverses the 9th Circuit often enough [link1](http://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/373273/ninth-circuit-leading-pack-most-reversed-jonathan-keim) [link2](http://www.eenews.net/stories/1060031790) [link3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit#Political_liberalism), so maybe that's what you were referencing? ...in which case that's also nonsense because the appeal was TO the 9TH, not FROM it.

In any case, before the plaintiffs appeal from the circuit-level to the supreme court, they can ask for, and be granted, an [en banc hearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_banc), which seems likely, given Circuit Judge N.R. Smith's dissent:

&gt; ...the actress laughed, “It’s been trial and error,"" as far as what she's actually eating. ""We really got it down to something a lot better than it was. It’s agar agar, a coconut kind of gelatin. The weak spot is the hot sauce which we have used V8, tomato juice kind of stuff, vegetable juice.

It was really delicious!”

&gt; She added, “That was the best version. It was the first time I’ve ever eaten a brain on set and been like ‘Hey, this isn’t bad.’ The week before we did a stew that was just appalling. It was like brain mixed in with packet stew sauce, this thick kind of brown gravy.

&gt;  “It’s not the most glorious taste, but it’s fine,” says Naiman, who singles out the “brain carpaccio” from the Meat Cute restaurant as her favorite creation of the season. “We made a brain that was quite tough and dense,” she says with a laugh. “It looked like a big hunk of ham being sliced into beautiful thin wafers.” http://www.tvinsider.com/article/25632/creating-edible-brains-for-izombie/

496,"It was so fast as to be incomprehensible. It was so incomprehensible that a slow man was killed.

William Huskisson was a Member of Parliament from Liverpool, and a railway supporter. And the first publicized railway fatality.

He was also
&gt; [the most accident-prone MP in history](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/oct/13/highereducation.news). As a child he was frequently laid up with chest complaints. Once, rising from his bed to do schoolwork, he fractured his arm. His horse fell on him just before his marriage. He was flattened by the pole of a carriage at the entrance to Horse Guards. When in Scotland at the residence of the Duke of Athol, he tried to leap the moat but missed, savagely spraining his ankle and lacerating the tendons of his foot, the wrench of both permanently altering his gait and ensuring it would be weeks before he was able to travel back to England. A while later he fell from a horse, and again broke his arm. He snapped it again not long after, this time by falling from a carriage.

On [that fateful day in 1830](http://www.branchcollective.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/1LM.jpg), the railway had its grand opening, with many officials, dignitaries, and aristocrats in attendance. Some accounts blame the lack of ladders or the inactivity of bystanders in the Duke's traincar, but it is clear that the unfortunate man [did not clear the tracks in time](http://www.dailykos.com/stories/1082886/full_content).

&gt; The most active of those in peril sprang back into their seats; Lord Wilton saved his life only by rushing behind the Duke's carriage, and Count Matuscenitz had but just leaped into it, with the engine all but touching his heels as he did so; while poor Mr. Huskisson, less active from the effects of age and ill-health, bewildered, too, by the frantic cries of ""Stop the engine! Clear the track!"" that resounded on all sides, completely lost his head, [looked helplessly to the right and left, and was instantaneously prostrated by the fatal machine](http://www.wardsbookofdays.com/15september.htm), which dashed down like a thunderbolt upon him, and passed over his leg, smashing and mangling it in the most horrible way.’

&gt; There was no mechanical failure, and no flaw in the engineering or the materials. Huskisson died because the railway engine operated precisely as planned, traveling at a speed so rapid that it baffled human comprehension and outpaced one man’s motor-response. And that itself was [still a technological triumph, regardless of the human cost.](http://www.onceaprofessor.org/industrialism-as-progress/)

* ""[A Case Against 'The Case Against Bernie Sanders'](https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/blog/case-against-case-against-bernie-sanders)"" by Matthew Boudway. January 18

&gt; If, as Krugman and now Chait have argued, what we need most in the White House is a dependable bulwark against Republican mischief, then we should be voting for a candidate whose record demonstrates consistent opposition to Republican policies. That candidate is Sanders, not Clinton, who has been all over the place on many issues.


* ""[Paul Krugman is wrong: Why his case against Bernie Sanders misses the point](http://www.salon.com/2016/02/19/paul_krugman_is_wrong_how_the_hillary_supporters_attacks_on_bernie_sanders_completely_miss_the_point/)"" by Elias Isquith. Feb 19.

&gt; Good policy does not always make for good politics. There are positive lessons to be learned from the conservative movement’s example. And, right now, it’s politics — not policy — that matters the most. ... It’s about what the progressive movement should be doing right now, today. Krugman recommends a little less aspiration and a little more focus on crafting good policy. His position is not unreasonable or disingenuous; it’s just wrong.

You know how Trump says ""America never wins anymore""? Sometimes it feels like ""the Left never wins anymore,"" even when we won in 2012. If concessions to rabidly opposing interests = rational views of reality, I'm not supporting it this primary election cycle. 

As for the vitriol, it's meant for the political establishment that Clinton embodies, in complement to the economic establishment; both have a playing field that slants their way. /u/turd-polish had a comment somewhere in /r/politics that goes into several examples, but there seems to be (if you'll excuse the expression) a ""vast left-wing conspiracy"" to weaken Sanders and boost Clinton. [Shane Ryan writes](http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/02/the-jonathan-capehart-saga-or-why-progressives-hav.html), regarding the Capehart op-eds: 
&gt; The corporate media is in the bag for Hillary Clinton, lock, stock, and barrel. And while their unrelenting advocacy may not reach the level of nefarious conspiracy, it is transparently corrupt. And if the nation’s center-left wants to understand why progressives seem to have staged a sudden revolt from the Democratic party, and are threatening to abandon Hillary Clinton in the general election, they have to understand this feeling of betrayal.

Ryan gives more examples at the end of his essay, in part 5. And goes on to highlight connections between Clinton and journalists, between Clinton and the Party, which suggest conflicts of interest. Now, you don't get to be First Lady, Senator, Sec of State without making connections in the party apparatus and the media. But that just furthers the buy-in to the Sanders narrative: the game is rigged in favor of the Establishment, the Powerful. The vitriol for Hillary is the vitriol for the Establishment. And when Hillary tries to ask us, ""who's more of an Outsider than the first woman?"", well, we all've seen the responses.

* the neighborly activity: dates &amp; descriptions of work done on the pipeline, description of damage (with photos, if possible), and replacement repair costs.
* What do you want from your neighbor (i mean within reasonable scope, like moving the pipe is a *maybe*, but making him move away is not realistic) and what is a dealbreaker for you?

Summarizing the situation and organizing the facts will make it easier to present your case to your lawyer, (If you don't have a lawyer, it will cost some money; I suggest taking care of the consultation fee up front to avoid surprises.) and it will save on time the lawyer bills while he tries to make sense of your story.

* Social security checks for Alaska residents, and EITC for qualifying Alaska residents
* Annual joint military exercise [Northern Edge](http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=46550)
* Ongoing federal investment in the [Port of Anchorage](http://www.marad.dot.gov/ports/office-of-port-infrastructure-development-and-congestion-mitigation/port-and-terminal-infrastructure-development/anchorage/)
* Indian Health Service grants to social-services organizations for AK residents
* the federal share of DenaliCare
*et cetera.

Anyway, depending on where you get your data, you might not remember to count every dollar of federal money that ends up in Alaska, especially if it isn't explicitly for an Alaskan (for example, a veteran's payment goes to that veteran no matter whether he lives in Alaska or moves to another state) or isn't explicitly for Alaska (for example, the National Interagency Fire Center spends money fighting forest fires; that money goes into Alaska if there are forest fires that year).


Here is a useful website, that roughly classifies spending into four categories: https://www.nationalpriorities.org/smart/alaska/

* Federal dollars in the Alaska budget, which fund public assistance programs.
* Direct benefits from the federal government, paid to individuals.
* Payments to vendors to perform federal contracts.
* Salaries paid to federal employees working in the state.

Check your deed paperwork and your title search paperwork. Is there an easement showing the pipe, and the terms/conditions of access/digging/landscaping? 

If Yes, then that easement language will guide your lawsuit against him for restoring your lawn and hedges, but the pipe will likely remain on your land. I think that rule comes from the case Knuth v. Vogels, 276 Wis. 341 (1954).

But if there is No easement in your papers, then by fighting the trespass, you can stop the 20-year timer. 

However, it also depends on how old this pipe is. For example, if both you and your neighbor moved into the neighborhood recently, but the houses are 60 years old, then the 20 year trigger might have happened long ago (but then it should have been recorded on the paperwork).

510,"&gt; Why do we spend more per student on UA, then we do on the rest of the students?

What do you mean? Are you asking why Rep. Wilson's figures for University of Alaska per-student spending are higher than Anchorage School District's per-student spending? 

Wilson's slideshow argues two points: 1, that the cost per University of Alaska student is much higher than the cost per Anchorage schoolchild, and 2, that UA should cut per-student costs down to what ASD spends.

* University of Alaska “BSA” All Funds: $21,536 
* [ASD k-12] Student Need: $9,142

Well, that's true. But think about the different missions of a municipal school district and a state university system. The logistics are different. The labor needs are different. The infrastructure is different. 

Take as an example the UA’s Fisheries, Seafood and Maritime Initiative. Basically, seafood is a big deal for Alaska, right? So what are some key issues that UA is trying to address?

* UAF, the main Alaska research institution, lacks a oceanography professor to study Alaskan ocean chemistry. 
* UAS needs a fisheries professor to meet increased demand for fisheries degrees in the Southeast. 
* the seafood processing industry identified
nine key priority occupations as hard to fill and needing skilled employees... [and a full-time faculty member is needed for] high demand classes at the Kodiak Seafood and Marine Science Center such as HACCP, Sanitation, and
Ammonia Refrigeration.
* Alaska ports lack highly trained vessel repair technicians.

What does just this initiative cost? (GF: $520.0, NGF: $239.3, Total: $759.3 thousand) 

It's UA's job to try to match up educational programs with the state's forecasted economic needs, unlike ASD's job to make literate, numerate citizens. Of course ASD costs less; a biologist or oceanographer is a more expensive employee than a schoolteacher, and a high school costs less to run than a seafood processor. How can UA spend like ASD and still have such economically vital programs? The answer is, Wilson would cut it because she doesn't believe it's important. 

It's a little like not paying your renter's/homeowner's insurance. You pay that money every month, and your life doesn't seem any different. Your son doesn't have to pay for any of that, either; why shouldn't you learn from his good example? So you stop paying it. Then what happens?

Okay. The other issue, which the author of the ADN opinion wrote, is that the BSA figures are misleading. Spreading all costs per student works better in situations where all students have roughly similar costs, and all costs have roughly similar student benefits. AnchSD programs are fairly similar in size to each other, although a gym and a chemistry lab don't cost the same. But compare the cost for a UAA math major who lives in the city, and a student training in health care who's [placed in the Interior](http://www.interiorahec.org/)? Which student do you think costs more to support?

EDIT: Looking at the graph on Wilson's slideshow (original source here: http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2015/06/federal-and-state-funding-of-higher-education ) it looks like Alaska has almost no revenue from ""self-supporting operations"" like football.

The SS destroyed governments in Eastern Europe, including the Baltic States, Poland, Belarus/BSSR, and UkraineSSR. ~1% of Jews survived in those regions.

""Where states were destroyed, Jews were murdered; where the state remained intact, Jews could find some protection in bureaucracies and passports. It was in the stateless regions of Eastern Europe where the Nazis were able to experiment with and calibrate the Final Solution, which they then tried to export back west."" (Edward Delman reviewing Snyder)

""In Nazi-occupied but technically sovereign Denmark, 99 percent of Jews survived, whereas in Greece and the Netherlands—where a puppet government ruled and where the SS took over domestic policy, respectively—three-quarters of Jews were deported to extermination camps. Only through the production of statelessness external to Germany could Adolf Hitler’s “biological anarchist” worldview find expression. 

""Critics may object that it was precisely a powerful German state that created these stateless zones, but German Jews were still far more likely to survive than Jews in zones of statelessness. Further, the chief murdering institution—the SS—was a Nazi Party organization whose ability to destroy states multiplied once it left the borders of the Reich."" (Timothy Nunan reviewing Snyder)

541,"Okay. the development of the highway system had a number of obstacles to overcome. Some of them were internal to President DDE's development team. Eisenhower himself was seeking a ""`dramatic' plan to get [50 billion dollars worth of **self-liquidating** highways under construction](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/hwyhist07c.cfm),"" and preferred to avoid increasing the national debt to do it.

[Major General JS Bragdon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stewart_Bragdon), a West Point buddy of DDE and veteran military engineer, was appointed to Public Works Planning, within the Council of Economic Advisers. A political noob, he proposed a national highway authority that would strip states of their highway agencies and centralize responsibility for planning, financing, and construction in the Executive. Congressmen did not like this idea. State officials weren't pleased either.

As for financing the cost of massive construction, many competing ideas were put forth. [An old law started in 1916](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aid_Road_Act_of_1916), allowed for federal-state matching funds; why not continue sharing the cost between a state govermnent and the Federal government? [Francis DuPont](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/administrators/fdupont.cfm), the head of the Bureau of Public Roads and past head of the Delaware State Highway Commission, wanted the federal government to foot the whole bill, which would stimulate the economy as well as having longterm social benefits. Meanwhile, Bragdon wanted to pay for the highways with a national system of tolls. 

Well, DDE was going to give a speech to all the governors at a special conference, but a relative died and so [Nixon had to give the speech](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/rw96m.cfm). Here is an excerpt:

&gt; Now, let us look at the highway net as it should be. The President believes that the requirements are these: a grand plan for a properly articulated system that solves the problems of speedy, safe, transcontinental travel -- intercity communication -- access highways -- and farm-to-market movement --metropolitan area congestion -- bottlenecks -- and parking.

&gt; Second, a financing proposal based on self-liquidation of each project, wherever that is possible, through tolls or the assured increase in gas tax revenue, and on Federal help where the national interest demands it.

&gt; And third -- and I would emphasize this, particularly at this Conference, because I know how deeply the President believes in this principle: a cooperative alliance between the Federal government and the States so that local government and the most efficient sort of government in the administration of funds, will be the manager of its own area.

&gt; And the fourth, very probably, a program initiated by the Federal government, with State cooperation, for the planning and construction of a modern State highway system, with the Federal government functions, for example, being to advance funds or guarantee the obligations of localities or States which undertake to construct new, or modernize existing highways.

Notice that the proposal is for roads that generate their own revenue or taxes levied to fund them, and for state-federal partnership in managing the project.

Having publicly called for a national highway system, DDE needed to get the ball rolling faster than his disunited advisory team was doing. So he appointed 2 more teams, one headed and selected by another Army buddy, Lucius Clay. Clay's Presidential Advisory Commmittee on a National Highway Program was",2016-01-26 16:04:37+00:00,czcmraz,1.0,t3_42oqhc,56520.0,AskHistorians

544,"You are right. The PRA is less useful now. My bad for citing it.

&gt; ([SOURCE](http://nittanylaw.com/landlocked-property/)) A recent decision of the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court, “In Re: Kenneth E. Stake”, decided May 14, 2013, demonstrates how the Public Road Act has become a “paper tiger” since the “O’Reilly” holding. ... The Private Road Act appears to now be unavailable in most landlocked situations. Those owners will need to turn to other means of establishing an easement, including an express written easement from the neighbor, an easement by implication, an easement by necessity, and a prescriptive easement.

OP is still in danger of other ways to have an easement forced on him, within the law.

* An easement by prescription requires adverse, open, notorious, continuous and uninterrupted use for at least twenty-one years. Ideally, OP can get a written, notarized statement by the old neighbors saying that they used OP's driveway **with permission**.
* Under Pennsylvania law, if a seller of real estate sells a landlocked parcel of land at a time when the seller has remaining land which could provide the landlocked parcel with access to a public thoroughfare, and if the parties for some reason fail to provide for a driveway across the seller’s remaining lands, the law generally provides the purchaser with an implied easement over the remaining lands of the seller. ¶ Likewise, where the circumstances are reversed, such that the seller has landlocked himself by selling off a parcel between his remaining property and a public road, the law will create an easement in favor of the seller across the lands purchased by the buyer. ¶ OP may need to look at the sales histories of the properties to see if this is the case and an easement by implication has occurred.
* An easement by necessity is distinguished from an easement by implication in that the former easement arises only when ""strictly necessary,"" whereas an implied easement can arise when ""reasonably necessary.""

&gt; The Pennsylvania Courts have described these easements as follows: Distinguished from implied easements from existing use: Implied easements on the grounds of necessity must be distinguished from implied easements from a prior use (also referred to as easements by implied reservation). The two types of easements are often confused by both litigants and the courts because both easements require unity of ownership and subsequent severance. Graff v. Scanlon, 673 A.2d 1028 (Pa. Commonw. 1996). (Citing 11 Am.Jur. Proof of Facts 3d 601, Way of Necessity.) An easement by necessity arises upon a showing that there was a conveyance of a part of a tract of land in such a manner that the part conveyed or the part retained is denied access to a public road. Conversely, an implied easement from a prior use ""[is] based on the theory that continuous use of a permanent right-of-way gives rise to the implication that the parties intended that such use would continue, notwithstanding the absence of necessity for the use."" Id. Requirements: (a) unity of ownership prior to severance by common grantor; (b) severance by conveyance; and c) easement must be ""strictly"" necessary in order for the owner of the dominant tenement to use his land, with the necessity existing both at the time of the severance of title and at the time of the exercise of the easement. Phillipi v. Knotter, 748 A.2d 757, 761 (Pa. Super. 2000)

Other points: 
if you allow a neighbor to use your property because you are on friendly terms, your implied permission is called ""neighborly accommodation.""

546,"Isn't that what implied easements and prescriptive easements are for? The former is for landlocked properties; the latter is for open/flagrant continuous use over a period of 20(?) years. PA, I think, has had plenty of such easements granted in their courts, ever since the Private Road Act.

If the former residents of the foreclosed property ever used the highlighted driveway portion, then OP needs to decide whether to settle it friendly-like in the near future, or battle it out in court (and probably have to give up the easement anyway).

Folks have been saying to check local laws. Here's an excerpt from an informational pdf https://www.atlantawatershed.org/default/?linkServID=B45D2089-F729-4F61-B2CF96325AC0C462&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;showMeta=2&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ext=.pdf

""Q. What manner of redress exists for situations in which runoff from one property creates negative impacts on an adjacent property?A. Section 74‐520 allows the City to require the owner of a stormwater pond to maintain it, even if it was built prior to 2004 when we began the stormwater inspection/maintenance program requirements. Anything regarding redress for property damage is a civil matter between private property owners.""

I think that OP should use the argument that from development thereafter, s/he hasn't changed any landscaping &amp;amp;amp;amp; drainage &amp;amp;amp;amp; runoff etc, and that it was the developer's responsibility to manage stormwater runoff. However, this is assuming that OP's runoff levels are close to natural. If OP's land were heavily paved over (before development of the neighboring subdivision), or funneled water onto the neighbor property, that argument might be trickier.

&gt; http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/neighbor-disputes-over-water-damage-29724.html
three different rules of liability govern situations like this.
**The reasonableness rule**. In a majority of states, when one neighbor alters the land and damage occurs to another, the neighbor is liable for the damage if the alteration was ""unreasonable."" If you sue a neighbor over damage you've suffered, judges will want proof that the neighbor did something unreasonable that altered the natural condition and caused your harm.
**The ""common enemy"" rule**: Lower landowners beware. In the past, many courts treated excessive rainwater as a ""common enemy,"" damaging property at random. Under this theory, you were expected to take measures to protect your own property from water coursing across the land. Even if one neighbor who lived on higher ground diverted water to prevent flooding and deposited it on you, you were expected to protect yourself from the extra water.
**The ""civil law"" rule**: Upper landowners beware. A number of states follow a rule which is, in theory, the opposite of the common enemy rule. The civil law rule holds that if a person alters the natural flow of surface waters in any way that harms the use and enjoyment of another property, that person will be liable for that harm. Unlike the common enemy rule, which requires lower landowners to fend for themselves, the civil law rule holds upper landowners liable for any detrimental changes in runoff patterns.


This is Stuart Teague's Law Blog entry on it: 
&gt; http://www.jstlegal.com/2010/09/defenses-to-claims-of-nuisance-due-to.html  
When persons seek to impose liability on others claiming a nuisance arising from flooding or drainage, it is important to first assess whether the up hill owner or others have done anything to **change the natural flow of water**.  A party seeking to impose liability on an up hill owner for flooding his property must do more than show that the source of the flood waters is from up hill.  All water flows down hill.  
One my favorite quotes stating the principles applicable to land owner liability for flooding comes from a 1977 opinion of the Georgia Supreme Court: 
 
    As sure as night follows the day, water from heaven must go and will go somewhere. Rainfall not entering the soil itself will run off towards lower land in keeping with the indisputable law of gravity. If man diverts the water from its usual course, or causes it to congregate in large quantities on the property of his upper or lower riparian neighbor this could be considered wilful. But, the piling of dirt on defendant's own property in carrying out a legitimate business activity, not abnormally dangerous when supervised under the authority of the law of this state, without more, would not support an allegation of conscious indifference where a portion is washed down natural drains onto another's property.

Atlanta requires developers to have stormwater management plans, but it sounds like the subdivision's developer didn't really think this one through. Too bad the homeowner might lose against the developer, too: 
&gt; http://www.jstlegal.com/2010/10/missing-ditches-and-sinkholes-on.html Literally, everyone in Atlanta could be held accountable for missing ditches if water flowed across their land down hill to the injury of another.

592,"The Constitution was a document that was the product of compromise, written by both sides to have room for interpretation. You are **interpreting** the Constitution in a particular way, and arrogating for yourself the power to determine ""the entire premise of the founding of the country"" while denying that other interpretations are possible (and incidentally, letting your personal biases color your analysis). I think you have a mindset that is hostile to other viewpoints, or you slept through your first semester of Constitutional Law, or I just found Scalia's reddit account :)  

&gt; Every view we may take of the subject, as candid inquirers after truth, will serve to convince us, that it is both unwise and dangerous to deny the federal government an unconfined authority, as to all those objects which are intrusted to its management. It will indeed deserve the most vigilant and careful attention of the people, to see that it be modeled in such a manner as to admit of its being safely vested with the requisite powers. If any plan which has been, or may be, offered to our consideration, should not, upon a dispassionate inspection, be found to answer this description, it ought to be rejected. A government, the constitution of which renders it unfit to be trusted with all the powers which a free people OUGHT TO DELEGATE TO ANY GOVERNMENT, would be an unsafe and improper depositary of the NATIONAL INTERESTS. Wherever THESE can with propriety be confided, the coincident powers may safely accompany them. This is the true result of all just reasoning upon the subject. And the adversaries of the plan promulgated by the convention ought to have confined themselves to showing, that the internal structure of the proposed government was such as to render it unworthy of the confidence of the people. They ought not to have wandered into inflammatory declamations and unmeaning cavils about the extent of the powers. The POWERS are not too extensive for the OBJECTS of federal administration, or, in other words, for the management of our NATIONAL INTERESTS; nor can any satisfactory argument be framed to show that they are chargeable with such an excess. If it be true, as has been insinuated by some of the writers on the other side, that the difficulty arises from the nature of the thing, and that the extent of the country will not permit us to form a government in which such ample powers can safely be reposed, it would prove that we ought to contract our views, and resort to the expedient of separate confederacies, which will move within more practicable spheres. For the absurdity must continually stare us in the face of confiding to a government the direction of the most essential national interests, without daring to trust it to the authorities which are indispensible to their proper and efficient management. Let us not attempt to reconcile contradictions, but firmly embrace a rational alternative. 
*from the Federalist papers #23, A. Hamilton*

------------------------------------

&gt; It will not be denied that the people have a right to change the government when the majority choose it, if not restrained by some existing compact; that they have a right to displace their rulers, and consequently to determine when their measures are reasonable or not; and that they have a right, at any time, to put a stop to those measures they may deem prejudicial to them, by such forms and negatives as they may see fit to provide. From all these, and many other well founded considerations, I need not mention, a question arises, what powers shall there be delegated to the federal head, to insure safety, as well as energy, in the government? I think there is a safe and proper medium pointed out by experience, by reason, and facts. When we have organized the government, we ought to give power to the union, so far only as experience and present circumstances shall direct, with a reasonable regard to time to come. Should future circumstances, contrary to our expectations, require that further powers be transferred to the union, we can do it far more easily, than get back those we may now imprudently give. The system proposed is untried. Candid advocates and opposers admit, that it is in a degree, a mere experiment, and that its organization is weak and imperfect. Surely then, the safe ground is cautiously to vest power in it, and when we are sure we have given enough for ordinary exigencies, to be extremely careful how we delegate powers, which, in common cases, must necessarily be useless or abused, and of very uncertain effect in uncommon ones. By giving the union power to regulate commerce, and to levy and collect taxes by imposts, we give it an extensive authority, and permanent productive funds, I believe quite as adequate to present demands of the union, as excises and direct taxes can be made to the present demands of the separate states.

&gt; http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/ContentPrint.aspx?id=10444Q: I moved out of my apartment a month ago and am having trouble getting my security deposit back. I called the landlord, and he said that since my roommate is still there, he did not have to return my deposit. Do I have to wait until my former roommate moves out before I can get my deposit back? (August 2003)

&gt; No. While it's true that your landlord does not have to return any of the deposit on the apartment until it is vacated, you should get your share of the deposit back from your former roommate, or from a new person taking your place, if there is one. If there is a new tenant, and s/he pays the landlord a security deposit, then you would get your share back from the landlord. If there is no new person or the new person pays your roommate, or does not pay a deposit, your only recourse is to get it from your old roommate. If s/he won't give it to you, you may need to take him/her to small claims court.



If you would prefer to take a free ride at the expense of the guy you replaced, keep his deposit if it doesn't bother your conscience, and if you are prepared to defend yourself in Small Claims from the prior tenant and subsequently the landlord, then go ahead. I personally do not think that it is the smart/right thing to do: if you live in the rental, you should take some responsibility for the condition of the apartment.

EDIT:
&gt; http://www.courts.ca.gov/1049.htm If only 1 roommate is moving out and the person moving out paid the deposit to another roommate, that roommate has to return the deposit. If the person moving out gave the deposit to the landlord, and the landlord has a separate rental agreement with the roommate moving out, the landlord returns the deposit. If, however, the roommates all signed 1 rental agreement for the unit and only 1 of the roommates moves out, the landlord does not have to return the security deposit until all the roommates have left.

608,"It is not easy, because it depends upon the willingness of the other joint owner/owner-in-common to cooperate. If you have to fight it out in court, such as for forced buyout, the expenses will increase the price you pay/decrease the price your brother gets.

When you bought the house, did you split the down payment 50-50? how about the mortgage payments? Even if you paid 90% and he paid 10%, **if** you are joint tenants/owners, then you have equal interests in the house, 50-50.

Joint tenancies are nice for happily-married couples, but less so for almost everyone else. That's why minnesota has that form to turn joint tenancies into tenancies-in-common. In a TIC, your heirs would receive your share of the property when you die. If you died in a JT, your share of the house/mortgage would go to your co-tenants as if you had never existed.

First, be sure that it's a joint tenancy (rather than a tenancy-in-common). Does it meet these four rules?

* Time - the co-owners must acquire the property at the same time. (this fits unless one of you owned the property before the other)
* Title - the co-owners must have the same title to the property. If a condition applies to one owner and not another, there is no unity of title. (unless one brother has a contract like ""the basement is mine exclusively"" then this fits)
* Interest - each co-owner owns an equal share of the property; for example, if three co-owners are on the deed, then each co-owner owns a one-third interest in the property **regardless** of the amount each co-owner contributed to the purchase price
* Possession - the co-owners must have an equal right to possess the whole property (seems like this fits from your posts)

So does Evansville: http://www.codepublishing.com/in/evansville/html/Evansville09/Evansville0920.html  So does Indianapolis.

&gt; To combat crime, Indianapolis officials have wielded nuisance laws, and increasingly lawsuits, like a spiked mace. News reports show the city's legal department, at the behest of code enforcement and police, has filed nuisance lawsuits since 2011 against at least eight apartment complexes, nine hotels and a handful of bars and rental-home landlords. The problem properties typically had racked up hundreds of police runs each over a year or two. They tended to be rife with prostitution, drug-dealing and violent crime. And management seemed unable to get control.




Find out who is in charge of your overzealous local martinet. What is the structure of the community association? Is there a landlord and property manager? is there an elected community board? http://www.courierpress.com/news/local/laws-may-toughen-on-hoa-leaders-ep-443573097-326609521.html

&gt; If the situation cannot be resolved, take a another close look at your HOA covenants and restrictions, and decide whether it's worth your time and expense to fight.

&gt; ""For most of these cases, court is not the way to go,"" said Phil Nicely, a longtime real estate attorney in Indianapolis. ""As a practical matter, the best way to proceed with an overzealous HOA is to get a new board of directors. If they are not doing their job, get the people out that are running the association and vote some new ones in that are more reasonable.""

&gt; Last year, Indiana lawmakers passed a new law that allows Hoosiers to hold their HOAs accountable for acts of mismanagement and fraud.  The law allows the attorney general to file legal action against a HOA and its board members that engaged in illegal or fraudulent activity. The AG may seek injunctions against illegal conduct or seek restitution and civil penalties of up to $5,000 per violation.

&gt; There are a few situations in which it may be okay to use a name that is already in existence -- just be sure that the name your are using is not famous! For example, if the name that you want to use is already being used by another company, but the other company sells a drastically different product than you plan on selling, then you may be able to move forward with using your chosen name. In addition, geographic location can be another factor that can let you use an identical name. If the business that already has your name is far away and serves only a small population, this makes it safer for you to use the name.

it to the Secretary of State to determine when two names are deceptively similar. Under the Secretary of 
State's recently adopted regulations, names are considered to be deceptively similar when a person using

proposed name with an existing name. This leaves open the question whether the mistake must be visual, 
aural or both. The regulations do provide a number of specific examples of when two names will be

For a slightly more detailed writeup of meat colors (knowledge of chemistry will help), try [this PDF](http://www.cfs.purdue.edu/fn/fn453/meat%20color.pdf) on meat proteins &amp; color, [or this PDF article, mostly about cooked beef](http://www.beefresearch.org/CMDocs/BeefResearch/PE_Fact_Sheets/Color_Changes_in_Cooked_Beef.pdf)


EDIT: this is because local grocery stores nowadays don't have butchers who cut sides of beef any more. they are all precut and packaged in a processing plant far away, and on their journey to sit on a supermarket shelf for a week, they turn brown. Unless...
&gt;  In the United
States, nearly three-quarters of meats
found in the meat case are now centrally
processed.
Case-ready packaging technology for
fresh red meats has focused largely on two
things: extending shelf life and preserving
the red color that consumers associate with
freshness. Modified atmosphere packaging, or MAP, is the prevalent format currently
used to achieve these two attributes—processors have invested a great deal in MAP
technologies to support case-ready programs.

 If you are lucky enough to have a real butcher in your town, when he cuts a section off the carcass, the surface that was freshly exposed is exactly that-- *fresh*-- and needs no chemicals to look red. 

TLDR the red is artificial. Refusing to buy meat unless it's bright red is like... like a guy who can't get an erection unless he's watching a porn with ultra-implants and fake orgasm sounds. It's not real.

&gt; This state of affairs forced the Burbage brothers to take drastic action to save their investment. In defiance of the landlord and with the help of their friend and financial backer William Smith, chief carpenter Peter Street and ten or twelve workmen, they dismantled the theatre on the night of 28 December 1598 and moved the structure piecemeal to Street's yard near to Bridewell. With the onset of more favourable weather in the following spring, the material was ferried over the Thames to reconstruct it as The Globe.[15][16] Giles Allen then sued Peter Street in January 1599 for trespassing on the property of the Theatre, stating that Street had no right to dismantle the Theatre and move the supplies.

 &gt; By contrast, periods during which an employee is completely relieved from duty and which are long enough to enable him or her to use the time effectively for his or her own purposes are not considered hours worked.

* http://www.shrm.org/templatestools/hrqa/pages/cms_020208.aspx

 &gt; An example of off-duty status is found at 29 C.F.R. §785.16  in the DOL regulations: “If the truck driver is sent from Washington, D.C., to New York City, leaving at 6:00 a.m. and arriving at 12 noon, and is completely and specifically relieved from all duty until 6 p.m. when he again goes on duty for the return trip the idle time is not working time. He is waiting to be engaged.”

 &gt; On the other hand, when an on-call employee is required to stay at the workplace or is so near the workplace that he or she cannot use his or her time freely, the employee is engaged to wait (on duty). In such cases, the employee must be compensated for this time.

 &gt; A stenographer who reads a book while waiting for dictation, a messenger who works a crossword puzzle while awaiting assignments, fireman who plays checkers while waiting for alarms and a factory worker who talks to his fellow employees while waiting for machinery to be repaired are all working during their periods of inactivity. The rule also applies to employees who work away from the plant. For example, a repair man is working while he waits for his employer’s customer to get the premises in readiness. The time is work time even though the employee is allowed to leave the premises or the job site during such periods of inactivity. The periods during which these occur are unpredictable. They are usually of short duration. In either event the employee is unable to use the time effectively for his own purposes. It belongs to and is controlled by the employer. In all of these cases waiting is an integral part of the job. The employee is engaged to wait. (See: Skidmore v. Swift, 323 U.S. 134, 137 (1944); Wright v. Carrigg, 275 F. 2d 448, 14 W.H. Cases (C.A. 4, 1960); Mitchell v. Wigger, 39 Labor Cases, para. 66,278, 14 W.H. Cases 534 (D.N.M. 1960); Mitchell v. Nicholson, 179 F. Supp, 292,14 W.H. Cases 487 (W.D.N.C. 1959).)

&gt; The Court draws the general rule from the Supreme Court’s holding in Armour and Swift that it “is not whether an employee’s leisure is curtailed at all, but rather whether it is so restricted that it is not spent primarily for the employee’s benefit.” ... Halferty v. Pulse Drug Co., 864 F.2d 1185 (5th Cir. 1989) ...
 Whitten v. City of Easley, 62 Fed.Appx. 477 (4th Cir. 2003)  The Court here applied four factors to come to a conclusion on interference with personal time, including whether the employee may carry a beeper, or leave their home; the frequency of calls and nature of demands; the employees ability to maintain a flexible on-call schedule and trade shifts; and whether the employee actively engaged in personal activities during the on-call times.

&gt; As illustrated by the above cases, the issue of whether employees must receive pay for time spent on call is
highly fact-specific. It hinges on factors such as the amount of time an employee has to respond to a call;
the frequency with which an employee is called to return to work; and the extent to which an employee may
decline a particular request to return to work without facing adverse employment consequences. The
ramifications of employer mistakes in this area are significant. Damages available under the FLSA include
back pay for time that should have been considered hours worked (paid at an overtime rate if such hours
would cause an employee’s total number of hours worked that week to exceed 40); an additional equal
amount as liquidated damages; and payment of the employee’s attorneys’ fees (in addition to the
employer’s own attorneys’ fees, of course). Given the fact-specific nature of the inquiry and the potential
ramifications of mistakes, employers should make sure their on-call policies are reviewed periodically for
continued legal compliance.

&gt; Off duty waiting time or layover time is not hours worked if: 
You are completely relieved from duty;
The periods are long enough to enable you to use the time effectively for your own purposes;
You are definitely told in advance that you may leave the job; and
You are advised of the time that you are required to return to work.

* https://www.adp.com/workforce-management/docs/whitepaper/FLSA_White_Paper.pdf

 &gt; The following are examples of types of hours that may need to be
considered hours worked:
On-call Time: An employee who is required to remain on call on the
employer’s premises or so close thereto that he or she cannot use
the time effectively for his or her own purposes is working while “on
call.” An employee who is not required to remain on the employer’s
premises but is merely required to leave word at his home, or with
the company where he may be reached or even wear a beeper or
carry a cellular phone may not be working while on call. For the
beeper and cellular requirements, distance and mobility would
determine if the employee would be considered working or not.

 &gt; Waiting Time: Time employees spend waiting rather than
performing their principal activities may constitute hours worked
depending on the circumstances. The basic test is whether the
employee is “engaged to wait” or “waiting to be engaged.” “Engaged
to wait” time is compensable time because it is controlled by
the employer. “Waiting to be engaged” time is not compensable
if the employee is duty-free and can use the time for his own
purpose. An example of “Engaged to Wait” is a secretary who
does a crossword puzzle while waiting for a rewrite on a memo.
The rule also applies to employees who work away from the
plant or office. For example, a cable installer is working while he
waits for his employer’s customer to get the premises ready. ",2015-12-09 15:54:22+00:00,cxswech,1.0,t3_3vzp5b,62982.0,legaladvice

&gt; Since meat – especially red meat – is so expensive, the Chinese have devised a clever way of making a little go a long way – by slicing a small piece into small, paper-thin slices, used to flavor a wokful of veggies, beans and sprouts. This technique can turn an inexpensive cut into tender tidbits, not only beef but chicken breasts as well.

&gt; In this more complicated version of the story, Rosa Parks is no mere seamstress tuckered out from pressing pants. She has also been for many years a volunteer for the local chapter of the NAACP. She is, in fact, E.D. Nixon's secretary. She knows all about Claudette Colvin and the other women who have been arrested for refusing to give up their seats. She knows when she gets on that bus that E.D. Nixon is looking for a test case, a case he can take all the way to the Supreme Court. 

&gt; What Rosa doesn't know--not until bus driver James Blake, a man Rosa has despised ever since he threw her off the bus in a similar incident ten years earlier, yells, ""All right, you niggers, I want those seats""--is that she is not going to be a secretary in the case, but the defendant.

&gt; “Her story is almost like the movie ‘Forrest Gump’ in that she ends up taking part in all these historical events,” says Theoharis. “She had this huge political lifespan and yet what we know about her too often focuses on this one day.”
&gt; There’s no doubt Parks is seen as an icon, but if history told a more complete story, Theoharis thinks she would be much more relatable, and useful, to young people.

""Never mind the headlines. We’ve never lived in such peaceful times.""

By Steven Pinker and Andrew Mack

&gt; How can we get a less hyperbolic assessment of the state of the world? Certainly not from daily journalism. News is about things that happen, not things that don’t happen. We never see a reporter saying to the camera, “Here we are, live from a country where a war has not broken out”—or a city that has not been bombed, or a school that has not been shot up. As long as violence has not vanished from the world, there will always be enough incidents to fill the evening news. And since the human mind estimates probability by the ease with which it can recall examples, newsreaders will always perceive that they live in dangerous times. All the more so when billions of smartphones turn a fifth of the world’s population into crime reporters and war correspondents.",2015-11-18 17:53:50+00:00,cx4q0he,1.0,t3_3ta681,23859.0,collapse

692,"&gt; the duty to mitigate damages, in our view, specifically requires the landlord to exercise reasonable diligence to relet the premises.  
[Wilson v. Ruhl, appeals court of maryland, 1976](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2311719/wilson-v-ruhl/?)

here's a discussion of [landlord mitigation in wisconsin](http://petriestocking.com/blog/landlord-tenant/what-is-this-mitigation-of-damages-requirement-that-i-keep-hearing-about) that gives an idea of what ""reasonable"" is. 
&gt; ""Reasonable efforts"" are defined as ""those steps that the landlord would have taken to rent the premises if they had been vacated in due course . . .""  So if you typically advertise your vacancies in the Journal Sentinel then you should advertise the tenant's vacant unit in the Journal-Sentinel also.  If you typically advertise vacancies on Craig's List, then you should do the same for the tenant's vacant's unit.  If you always post a ""For Rent"" sign in the front of the apartment building, then you should do the same here as well.

Have you vacated your apartment yet? 
Do you know what the application process is like at your vacated place? (of course--you did it yourself at least 13 months ago) Try to make an advertisement compatible with that process, including hours that the rental office is open, etc. Also, check to see that the landlord is actually advertising. Otherwise they are not fulfilling duty to mitigate.

Also, $1000 advertising seems high. you may be on the hook only for actual/estimated advetising expenses, not penalty, then you are 

Also, know that Section 8-207 of the Real Property Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland says there is (b) No obligation to lease vacated unit in preference to others. 
&gt; - The provisions of subsection (a) do not impose an obligation to show or lease, the vacated dwelling unit in preference to other available units.

So your ads might not get you off the hook if tenants elect to rent a different unit of the landlord's.

EDIT: regarding the no sub-lease clause,
It does seem like the duty to mitigate and the no sublease clause are in conflict. [Law review article discussing this](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1598448?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).

8-207 again:
&gt; (c)  Sublease of unit where tenant does not take possession or vacates.- If a tenant wrongly fails or refuses to take possession of or vacates the dwelling unit before the end of the tenant's term, the landlord may sublet the dwelling unit without prior notice to the tenant in default. The tenant in default is secondarily liable for rent for the term of the tenant's original agreement in addition to the tenant's liability for consequential damages resulting from the tenant's breach, if the landlord gives the tenant prompt notice of any default by the sublessee. 

&gt; (d)  Waiver prohibited.- No provision in this section may be waived in any lease.

&lt;blah blah about the strict legal requirements for giving notice&gt; After such notice, the tenant may during the period of the landlord’s noncompliance or failure:

(1)Procure reasonable amounts of heat, running water, hot water, electricity, gas or plumbing service, as the case may be and upon presentation to the landlord of paid receipts deduct their cost from the rent; or

(2)Recover damages based on the reduction in the fair rental value of the dwelling unit; or

(3)Procure substitute housing, in which case the tenant is excused from paying rent for the period of the landlord’s noncompliance. The tenant may recover the cost of the reasonable value of the substitute housing up to an amount equal to the monthly rent for each month or portion thereof of noncompliance as prorated.

In addition to the remedies set forth in Section 5-12-110 (f)(1)-(3), the tenant may:

(4)Withhold from the monthly rent an amount that reasonably reflects the reduced value of the premises due to the material noncompliance or failure if the landlord fails to correct the condition within 24 hours after being notified by the tenant; provided, however, that no rent shall be withheld if the failure is due to the inability of the utility provider to provide service; or

&gt; If the tenant proceeds under this subsection (f), he may not proceed under subsection (c) or (d).

&gt; Generally speaking, a landlord is required to provide a tenant with a safe and habitable dwelling. Unfortunately, these terms are open to subjective interpretation. In most situations, ""habitable"" means that the property is protected from the elements (no missing windows or holes in the roof), is free from hazardous situations (such as chemical fumes), and that it has an adequate amount of heat and hot water. Whether a rental unit is ""safe"" is also subject to dispute, particularly for items not located within a common area.

&gt; A landlord may also be responsible for injuries sustained by tenants or their guests. Typically, this includes situations in which a landlord had control over the problem or unsafe condition that caused the injury, an accident was reasonably foreseeable, and fixing the problem or condition would not have been unreasonably expensive or difficult. Of course, it must be also proven that the presence of these factors led to the injury in question. For example, if a tenant slips and falls on an icy patch of sidewalk created by run-off from a broken rain gutter on a building, a landlord could be liable for the tenant's injuries. If, however, a tenant slips and falls on their kitchen floor because of orange juice they spilt, the landlord would not be at fault because the spill was not within the landlord's control.

708,"First of all, if you're selling a house and then buying a house, look into a [Section 1031 Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Code_section_1031).

Second of all, if you and your spouse are Georgia residents, you should know Georgia's rules on equitable distribution, and on marital and separate/nonmarital property.

Most important: Keep the Alaska and Atlanta houses, and the related funds, payments, accounts, *everything* separate from your existing joint accounts and marital assets. Get in the mindset of [wearing a different hat](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wear-another-hat)—the hat of an unmarried man, with no available marital assets or accounts— whenever you even *think* about this property. Otherwise you risk accidentally converting it into a marital proeprty.



&gt;[Courts that use a system](http://family-law.freeadvice.com/family-law/divorce_law/equitable_distribution.htm) of equitable distribution take into account both the marital property and the separate property of the couple going through the divorce proceedings. While both the separate property and the marital property of the spouses will be taken into account, the court will only actually distribute the marital property. The reason that the court considers the separate property of each spouse is that it may have an affect on the distribution of the marital property. For example, if one spouse has an abundance of valuable separate property, and the other spouse has very little, the court may allocate more of the marital property to the spouse with very little separate property.

&gt; [Non-marital property of one spouse](http://www.gadivorceonline.com/gapages/MaritalProperty/prop%20and%20debt%20div.asp) includes gifts and inheritances given just to that spouse, personal injury awards received by that spouse, and the proceeds of a pension that vested (that is, the pensioner became legally entitled to receive it) before marriage. Property purchased with the separate funds of a spouse remain that spouse's separate property. A business owned by one spouse before the marriage remains his or her separate property during the marriage, although a portion of it may be considered Marital property if the business increased in value during the marriage or both spouses worked at it.

&gt; [Property acquired during the marriage](http://hindsonmelton.net/property-division-georgia-divorce/) by either party by gift or inheritance remains the separate property of the party that acquired it unless it is converted into a marital asset by the actions of the recipient spouse.  It is generally not subject to equitable division unless its value was caused by efforts of the other party during the marriage.

&gt; [The right of a spouse](http://mtlawoffice.com/separate-property) to keep his or her separate or non-marital property upon divorce may depend largely on whether that spouse actually kept his or her separate property separate. For example, if a wife came into a marriage with a $30,000 money market account and wanted that account to remain her separate property, she should keep that account in her own name, refrain from depositing any marital funds into the account, and refrain from co-mingling those separate funds with any marital funds. Another example would be if a husband inherited some stock from his father during the marriage and wanted to keep that stock as his own separate property. In order to do so, he should open his own investment account, and he should not use the account for any investments that he and his wife own together.

A landlord can enter the rental unit between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., and only if they have given the tenant 24 hours written notice:

* to make repairs or do work in the unit,
* to carry out an inspection, where reasonable, in order to determine whether repairs are needed,
* to allow a potential mortgagee or insurer of the complex to view the unit,
* to allow a potential purchaser to view the rental unit (note: the Act also allows a registered real estate agent or broker to enter for this purpose if they have written authorization from the landlord),
* to allow an engineer, architect or other similar professional to make an inspection for a proposed conversion under the Condominium Act; or
* for any reasonable purpose allowed by the rental agreement.

The notice must include the reason why the landlord wants to enter the rental unit and must state what time, between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., the landlord will enter the unit. If the landlord gives the tenant the correct notice, the landlord can enter even if the tenant is not at home.

According to the **South Carolina Residential Landlord and Tenant Act**, the new landlord can come in and make necessary repairs. In fact, he is required to by the law:

&gt; SECTION 27-40-440. Landlord to maintain premises.

&gt; (a) A landlord shall:

&gt; (1) comply with the requirements of applicable building and housing codes materially affecting health and safety;

&gt; (2) make all repairs and do whatever is reasonably necessary to put and keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition;

&gt; etc blah blah etc

------------------------------

**However**, the key phrase there is ""reasonably necessary"". 

If the landlord wants to turn your living room into a construction zone, it can't be only because he wants to annoy you. It MUST be because there is something wrong with the chimney. 

If he can't prove that there is something wrong with the chimney in your apartment, tell him to piss off (politely, of course). 

In general, if a landlord wants to majorly renovate or repair and it's not a matter of health/safety/""essential services""/habitation, he has to get the tenant's consent, or wait until the tenant moves out. It sounds like that is the case here.

&gt; SECTION 27-40-530. Access.

I then asked him if he would say the same things he was saying to me to an actual Native American. He replied that he would (it would have been hard for him to have said no at that point), so I offered to introduce him to the AIM protesters, who were about 20 yards away.

&gt; He agreed to meet them, walked over with me, and was immediately confronted by Roche who explained in no uncertain terms that he did not feel “honored” by Rodriguez’s costume. A heated discussion ensued, during which Rodriguez hit on many of the common pro-Wahoo talking points, including Bob Dibiasio’s favorite, “it’s about baseball.”

&gt; At one point during the conversation I showed Rodriguez a copy of Aaron Sechrist’s artwork from the 2012 Scene cover story on the logo depicting a Chief Wahoo bobblehead next to a blackfaced lawn jockey drawn in the same style. I asked him if he’d ever show up at a baseball game in blackface, to which he replied that he wouldn’t. I then asked him why redface was any more excusable and he struggled to come up with an answer. As Allard notes in his piece, Rodriguez could only repeat that “he was an Indians fan.”

&gt; To Rodriguez’s credit, he was much more respectful to the protesters’ point of view than a great number of his fellow Wahoo fans even despite his outrageous costume, and seemed to actually be considering the arguments that were presented to him. Also, he appeared to be perfectly sober, contrary to what some of the media reports have suggested. I heard that he told Goldhammer on the air that he wants to meet me for a beer. Hopefully this happens so that we can continue the conversation, and hopefully the viral reaction to the photos of the Roche/Rodriguez encounter means that we’re getting close to a time where redface is recognized as just as unacceptable as blackface, even in Cleveland.

[This student](http://www.bizpacreview.com/2014/03/23/student-reamed-by-soldiers-for-falsely-wearing-military-uniform-explains-himself-108040) was confronted and threatened by some vets when he wore a 101st uniform to express his interest in the military. 

Does this make sense so far? Sometimes adopting symbols of military culture is fine; maybe because [it's Halloween](http://www.amazon.com/3WISHES-Costume-Marine-Halloween-Costumes/dp/B00804KYN6), or because [it's Weird Al](http://observationdeck.kinja.com/what-is-weird-al-wearing-in-this-mandatory-fun-album-ar-1615073797). But sometimes it disrespectful because there is a trivializing effect. (Let's not split hairs about whether it is tasteless or offensive just yet.) 

How about [this outside a Cleveland ballpark](http://www.clevelandfrowns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Rodriguez3.png), then? It's a trivialized adaptation of a symbolic cultural emblem, the war bonnet ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_bonnet) article). [This guy, for example is not thrilled](http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/sports/2014-04-07/f2432ed0-bea4-11e3-91d0-5b847a710af7_savagesmascottoon2002.jpg) by the adoption.

What do you think? do you agree that there is an analogical situation here?

Next, there's the problem of caricaturizing marginalized cultures. Representations of Indians, like Chief Wahoo of Cleveland, usually aren't accurate. Even Stanford University's [old Indian mascot](http://stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi-bin/stanford?a=d&amp;d=stanford19571122-01.2.73#) who came from the NW California Yurok tribe didn't get it right, [pastiching a Great Plains indian](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/NatNews/conversations/topics/49211) with buckskin and war bonnet. FSU Seminoles notwithstanding, it presents [a stereotype not selected by the group](http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/browbeat/2013/10/10/mascot_hats.jpg.CROP.promovar-mediumlarge.jpg). Furthermore, it's frequently the only thing adopted from the culture: not the history, not the experience, and not the people, just their clothes. 

The process selects cultural things to mock, or mass-produce in overseas factories (which is also kind of demeaning when the craftsmanship is important), while not encouraging any engagement with the people of that culture. When those people live in poverty, or are marginalized in some way, it feels like an additional insult: ""we want to copy your culture, but we don't want *you* or your shitty lives, ugh."" Remember that Stanford mascot guy: [ten years later](http://stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi-bin/stanford?a=d&amp;d=stanford19661116-01.2.7), he realized that 'honoring the culture' didn't do a damn thing to help the people.

&gt; You should have the right to express yourself however you want to – and you do. Nobody can force you to stop taking things from other cultures. The marginalized people whose cultures are appropriated don’t have the institutional power to force you to stop, even if they wanted to.

Obviously there are people on reddit who do try to stop it. There are certainly unhelpful and counterproductive efforts, like calling someone a racist for having a clever costume pun, or mangling a complex idea like I have probably done just now.

I am going to leave these links here in case you are interested in other stuff.

736,"I came here from /r/bestof. 

&gt; You know, of all the fucking stupid internet bullshit I've seen, I think ""cultural appropriation"" makes me the angriest. It's as if the people making the argument are so fucking conceited that they think they have some sort of cultural monopoly based on genetic heritage rather than actually understanding their own fucking customs.

I can see you're angry about it, but I think there are some valid concerns on both sides, which have been drowned out by a multitude of idiots arguing marginal cases like the original OP's pic of a Sioux Chef. 

&gt; Newsflash, no healthy culture is offended by others adopting their customs. The collective swapping of ideas and art is literally at the top of the list of the best things about the human species.

I agree with you entirely about this. What I quibble about, though, is whether the people who are ""adopting their customs"" are actually disrespecting those customs instead. It can be a custom to [wear certain items](http://zap2it.com/2011/03/american-idols-paul-mcdonald-apologizes-for-wearing-military-garb/) as a member of a group, or [after earning rank or merit](http://reagancoalition.com/articles/2013/20130226005-marine-rapper-uniform.html). Those two singers aren't adopting the customs of the Corps; to really do that, they'd have gone through Marine training and they would have avoided so much flak for playing dress-up.

If you didn't earn it, don't wear it. [Not even a paper facsimile](http://globegazette.com/lifestyles/wedding-crashers-web-site-angers-some-veterans-cops/article_b2471c36-9009-552d-ab22-d562d4b392f3.html). Straightforward, right? In fact, there was even a law banning unearned US military medals until it was declared unconstitutional in 2012.

Although it doesn't have the protection of federal law, [Indian headdress](http://www.mtv.com/news/1837578/why-you-should-not-wear-headdresses/) is nevertheless similar to military wear in one important way: it has an important cultural meaning *to the people in the group where the thing comes from.* When that meaning is ignored or [perverted into a caricature](http://www.aistm.org/cartoon.lalo.honoring.you2), the natural instinct for the group members is to defend the thing's symbolism, and to say: ""You don't understand what this means in our culture; [stop using it like that.](http://i0.wp.com/nativeamericacalling.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/043015-Wahoo-credit-Cleveland-Frowns.png)"" [Or this](http://www.homeofheroes.com/herobill/News/weddingcrashers2.jpg).

And I think that is another factor in your criticism of cultural appropriation as stupid internet PCness. Who gets to speak up in a situation like that? Is it only people from the borrowed-culture group, like [this woman](http://nativeappropriations.com/)? Or does that include people not in the group, [but still feel uncomfortable](http://alagarconniere.blogspot.com/2010/04/critical-fashion-lovers-basic-guide-to.html)? If the group is marginalized, is it a duty of others to speak up? Instead, what mostly ends up happening instead is, just as you said, **fucking internet bullshit**.

Ever hear of the protest against the painting *La Japonaise*? It's a goddamn painting at the art museum in Boston [by Claude Monet](http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/la-japonaise-camille-monet-in-japanese-costume-33556). A protest against fucking Monet! Here's a picture perfectly summarizing [the kind of idiocy that you would hate](https://squidmagazine.com/content/images/2015/07/jj.png). Then [this essay](http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/la-japonaise-camille-monet-in-japanese-costume-33556) explains what the hell the protest was all about. My point here is that just because misguided people are fighting against cultural appropriation (and sometimes [even weirder shit](http://www.vice.com/read/nazis-chic-is-asias-offensive-fashion-craze-456)), that doesn't mean that the whole cause is invalidated; only that some supporters are fools. 

I hope that I didn't come across as preachy. I know I didn't really address your point about genetics. But when non-idiots and actual scholars talk about ""Cultural Appropriation"", they're not talking about free and equal sharing of ideas between cultures; they mean the rip-off of a culture's IP without even a hat tip.

738,"&gt; If a culture doesn't constantly take in and adapt new memes it will stagnate.

You're missing the point, or fumbling your own.

Aside from your malapropism (memes spread person-to-person within culture, not from culture to culture), you are right that cultures need new ideas to innovate. 

But just as I need clothes to wear, or answers to my homework, I can't just take them from whomever I want, just because I need them.

And are you distinguishing between borrowing by an entire culture and borrowing by an individual person? And are you distinguishing between borrowing of something permissible and something impermissible?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let me start with borrowing something permissible. The [Nehru Jacket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehru_jacket) is a garment with some (but not a ton) of cultural significance. It was [adopted and popularized](http://static-1.mojvideo.com/foto93276-9020-321407/slika.jpg) in an unobjectionable way. Makes sense, it's a nonreligious, nonoccupational piece of clothing wearable by anyone.

What about something nonpermissible, borrowed by a fetishization subculture? Here's an essay describing Nazi *chic* among youth in Asia.
http://dangerousminds.net/comments/the_inexplicable_world_of_asian_hitler_chic
Obviously, the kids and young adults who dress up in this stuff have no awareness of German militarism or anti-Semitism beyond ""those guys were sharp dressers"". But some people complain. 
&gt; The store’s marketing manager Deborah Cheng told the South China Morning Post: “This is Hong Kong, and Chinese people are not sensitive about Nazism.” She added that “most of the complaints are from foreigners.”

Right. Maybe because the visiting foreigners actually saw the impacts of Nazism firsthand, or their grandparents fought against it, or they learned about it in school, or even via the 1993 film that won 7 Oskars, *Schindler's List*. Anyway, they condemned Asian appropriation of Nazi imagery for marketing purposes, even though nobody was being hurt by it. Like the ambassador from [Israel. And the envoy from Germany](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3791765,00.html), too. 

Let's acknowledge it. Symbols and images have power over people. So do [symbolic acts](http://i.imgur.com/GVUTOB0.png) at any scale: by a popular party, down to an individual protestor.

Continuing with the theme of military attire and national symbols, an American Idol contestant [was criticized for wearing Marine Dress Blues](http://zap2it.com/2011/03/american-idols-paul-mcdonald-apologizes-for-wearing-military-garb/). Among the internet comments: 

&gt; ""“My family member was KIA in Iraq, he was buried in that jacket which is
the United States Marine Corps dress blues. This touches a very
emotional chord in hearts like mine, and I take offense.”

&gt; ""The privilege to wear the Marine Corps Dress Blues Jacket is earned. For Paul to wear it as he did, was an insult.”

The contestant apologized, and said he didn't want to cause offense. He did not try to defend his conduct with an argument about freedom of expression, nor did he say that it was trivial &amp; not worth getting hot under the collar over. It is safe to say that he's not going to do it again.

On the other hand, there's [Gunnery Sergeant Fifty Cent](http://battlerattle.marinecorpstimes.com/2013/02/07/marine-blasts-rapper-50-cent-for-wearing-uniform/), who doesn't give two bits about the etiquette of military uniforms; only their use in fashion.

He's told me, many times, that calls from citizens about bad driving rarely result in much. Generally, a complaint about a bad driver won't result in a ticket for the bad driver unless an officer sees the bad driver in action. That means an officer has to get into position to see the bad driver. It just does not happen that often.

&gt; , you can reduce the number of points by showing up and pleading ""no contest"". You might want to see if this matters for your insurance rates somehow (without accidentally notifying your insurance company of a ticket they were unaware of). 

&gt; Unfortunately, it is rare that they reduce the fine through this course of action- after all, it is all about revenue. If you go up there and plead ""not guilty"" you will have to come up with a reason you are not guilty. If you are going &gt;20 over, this may be pretty difficult too. 

&gt; The court date on your ticket is just a pre-trial hearing, where most tickets are settled. The cop that issued your ticket will not be there, but if you try to dispute it, they will probably set up a specific court hearing that the cop will attend.

Your legal eagle friends also don't tell you that there are court fees. The fees are bigger than the fines sometimes. Basically they told you to take up the court's time by not waiving your hearing, and not taking care of  the fine, and they expect a judge will reduce your fine? Good luck if you don't have a defense or excuse...

&gt; For example, if you received a speeding citation, the minimum forfeiture for this offense is $30. The base forfeiture ($30) and the fees and surcharges ($145.30) total $175.30. This is the amount that the officer is required to write on your ticket, if traveling 1-15 mph above a 55 mph or less legal limit (65 mph limit has a higher minimum). It is the minimum amount that you must pay for a speeding conviction in the above range.

&gt; Why do I have to pay all these fees and surcharges?

&gt; **These fees and surcharges are added to your ticket according to state statute. State statutes require that the officer and the court include these fees and surcharges on your ticket.**

&gt; Where do these fees go?

&gt; On a typical speeding ticket the minimum ticket amount is broken down as follows:

&gt; Forfeiture	$30.00

Court costs	$25.00
Justice information fee	$21.50

756,"Well, you have a provision in there that you believe says you can give notice to terminate your lease, aka break it early, at least 45 days in advance.

There is a state law that says you need to give a sufficient notice to terminate your yearlong lease, aka not renew it, 60 days in advance of expiry. This is so the landlord knows to start looking for a new tenant.

The ambiguous bit here is state law uses termination to mean non-renewal. (And that usage is consistent with, for example, terminating on a month-to-month rental— in that case the legal time is a 30 day notice before moving somewhere else/being kicked out.) This is not what you meant, of course, but that is why contract language is tricky to write and we pay lawyers to draft them.

Simply put, it is possible your landlord or her attorney can convince a judge that the provision DOESNT mean ""OP can walk away from his lease with 45 days notice"", and that it DOES mean ""OP can decide to not renew his lease with only 45 days left instead of 60.""

Is there any part of your lease's added-on provision that says it's about EARLY termination, or BREAKING a lease, or with time remaining? That would deflate your landlord's potential argument about how to interpret the ""45 day"" clause.

EDIT to add:

Instead, you have included this gem: ""1) Should the tenant choose to vacate the property, the tenant will be responsible for the remainder of the lease term."" This other part of the lease supports the landlord's interpretation of the 45-day provision, and is incompatible with your interpretation that it's a lease breaking clause.

At least now we know, finally, you are not month-to-month.

Okay, now that we actually have some facts that make sense, let's get some more. Illinois has laws about not renewing a year lease: a tenant or landlord must give 60 days notice.

&gt;  [\(735 ILCS 5/9-205\) (from Ch. 110, par. 9-205) 
](http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs4.asp?DocName=073500050HArt%2E+IX&amp;ActID=2017&amp;ChapterID=56&amp;SeqStart=65800000&amp;SeqEnd=73500000)    Sec. 9-205. Notice to terminate tenancy from year to year. Except as provided in Section 9-206 and Section 9-207.5 of this Act, in all cases of tenancy from year to year, 60 days' notice, in writing, shall be sufficient to terminate the tenancy at the end of the year. The notice may be given at any time within 4 months preceding the last 60 days of the year. 

Does your lease distinguish between termination as in ""early lease-breaking"" and state law's ""non-renewal of year lease""? I.e. we know there is a 45 day notice for ""termination"". is there anything about notice for non-renewal? or for ""early termination""?",2015-11-03 01:41:18+00:00,cwmcek9,7.0,t1_cwmbm5v,1227.0,legaladvice

&gt; If your lease or rental agreement says nothing about late fees, your landlord may not impose one, no matter how reasonable it is. For example, if you hand your rent check to the landlord two days late and he tells you he will accept it only if you pay an additional $10, you may refuse unless your lease or rental agreement includes a late fee clause.

Copied Straight From the Link in my Comment about Licensing:

&gt; GENERAL LICENSE ISSUES

&gt; Q. When do I need an Illinois real estate license?

&gt; A. A person needs a real estate license if they provide assistance which is in any way intended to result in the sale or lease of real estate. The definition of the word ""broker"" under the Act provides 11 examples of the
types of ""assistance"" that require a real estate license. Included are: representing clients in the negotiation of
real estate sales contracts or leases, and issuing advertisements for the sale, purchase or lease of real estate.

&gt; The assistance must be provided for others. Accordingly, **a person who** buys, sells or **leases real estate as a ""principal"" does not need a real estate license**.

That part applies to your fiancee.

&gt; Compensation is required. Therefore, **a person who provides assistance on a real estate transaction to a friend or relative, without compensation, does not need a license.**

That part would apply to you when you are assisting your fiancee in the process of advertising the property, showing it, accepting rental applications, and closing on the lease.

&gt; The wood cut from the tree (and any falling fruit) still belongs to the owner of the property where the tree is rooted. If the tree owner doesn't claim the wood after a reasonable amount of time, the neighbor who had the branch or branches cut off must dispose of the debris.

&gt; Your neighbor has no responsibility for keeping tree branches from growing past the boundary line, but there are things you can do about it. You can certainly ask him to trim them back, and invite him to enter your yard to do so. (Otherwise he'd be trespassing.) Alternately, you may prune to the line (or hire it done). But you can't give him the trimmings to dispose of. These become your property unless the trees' owner asks for them back. Most towns have ordinances, akin to ""no dumping"" laws, that forbid you from throwing trash on neighboring properties, Merullo says.


Victor Merullo, by the way, has a tree law website. Everything there is pay-to-read, and probably written for lawyers, arborists, surveyors, etc.

829,"TLDR:  the fruit is legally not yours when it is on the tree, unless the trunk intersects the property line.

English common law holds that fruit in particular are the property of the tree owner, whether fallen or as-yet-unpicked.

&gt; English common law for centuries excluded a neighbor's right to pick fruit from overhanging branches. The aim was to discourage theft, said Mr. Merullo. And the doctrine has generally been upheld here. So when a man named Hale harvested 20 bushels of ripe pears from the orchards of a neighbor named Lyman near Hartford in October 1895, the courts concluded that Mr. Hale had no right to the pears even though he was standing on his own land when he picked them. [NYTimes, 1991](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/03/realestate/talking-trees-a-special-branch-of-the-law.html)



Here is a concurring link from a 1922 volume of the [NJ Law Journal](https://books.google.com/books?id=HG1KAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA317&amp;ots=_EVNkS2WcY&amp;dq=nj%20overhang%20fruit&amp;pg=PA317#v=snippet&amp;q=%22the%20owner%20of%20the%20tree%20may%20enter%22&amp;f=false)
&gt; the fruit of a tree overhanging a boundary line has been held to belong to the owner of the tree, and he may maintain trespass against the ad-joining owner if he converts such fruit to his own use; and if fruit on an overhanging tree falls to the ground in the neighboring close, the owner of the tree may enter to gather it. We have our doubts, however...

EDIT: NJLR seems to have plagiarized straight from American and English Annotated Cases, [Vol. Ann. Cas. 1918B]
(https://books.google.com/books?id=JZ5FAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1168&amp;lpg=PA1168&amp;dq=%22overhanging+tree+falls+to+the+ground+in%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=f7JBMWdPLQ&amp;sig=J8LpF4CzBHTEj1NGc6XUPktQGtQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAmoVChMIh9eDibzqyAIVhYI-Ch0ulAaz#v=onepage&amp;q=%22overhanging%20tree%20falls%20to%20the%20ground%20in%22&amp;f=false)

Here's a [2002 PDF article from Bench and Bar of Minnesota](http://www.goldenvalleymn.gov/forestry/pdf/trees-legal-issues.pdf):
&gt; ...The rule of thumb is that if
the tree trunk stands in a neighbor's yard, all of the fruit wherever it is hanging belongs  to the neighbor.10 Picking the fruit may not be so simple. Ownership of the fruit does not
give the neighbor any right to trespass onto your client's property to retrieve the fruit.
Courts would probably weigh the right to keep trespassers out of your client's yard
against the tree owner's right to harvest the fruit of her tree. The orchard owner whose
livelihood depends upon the harvest probably has a stronger claim than an urban
gardener.

&gt; The law is also unclear on the issue of fallen fruit. As a practical matter, it would not be
worthwhile for a neighbor to sue your client for keeping fallen fruit, because it would
have nominal value. The courts would probably hold the tree owner responsible for
making advance arrangements to harvest the fruit if it had sufficient value to bother with.
Your client is probably safe to keep the fallen fruit if his neighbor says nothing about it.
As with most neighbor disputes, the best counsel you can give is to encourage
communication and neighborliness

[Caveat: MN tree law can be an outlier](http://www.presspubs.com/north_oaks/news/article_aa7fbff0-eecc-11e0-8d21-001cc4c002e0.html). link to good article with hypotheticals

Then there's [this PDF article](http://www.amerisurv.com/PDF/TheAmericanSurveyor_Crattie-TreeLawPart2_Vol10No3.pdf) from The American Surveyor.

&gt; ""Products of the tree"" If a coconut falls from your neighbor's tree, straight down and smashes your car windshield, it's your neighbor's coconut. Should a bushel of sweet peaches or apples hang easily within your reach, on your side of the line ... well, no one is looking. If the fruit is on the ground, then it's a no brainer, the blatant trespasses are easily taken care of. 

&gt; Wrong in most cases. In practically all situations the fruit of the tree belongs to the owner of that tree, no matter which side of the line it is on. If the grapefruit tree is a boundary tree, all neighbors share equal bounty in vitamin C. I could find no agreement as to whose fruit it is once it hits the ground. In Georgia, by statute, any pecans falling on a public right of way belong to the tree's owner *until the end of the harvest season*. [emphasis original]

I got this next PDF from [Chapter 7 of the ABA Guide to Home Ownership:
](http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/publiced/practical/books/home_ownership/chapter_7.authcheckdam.pdf)
&gt; What if your neighbor's fruit is a problem for you? If rotting fruit habitually falls from a
neighbor's tree into your yard, notify him. Ask him to clean the fruit from your yard and to trim the
tree to avoid such droppings in the future. If he ignores your request or refuses to comply, your
neighbor may be liable for any damages the errant fruit causes to your grass or garden. (The same
thing goes for the fruit of a neighboring tree that may cause physical injury to you, such as coconut
that falls from a high tree and smacks you on the head.)

&gt;Trees are not strictly private property like barbecue grills. In some instances, neither the
tree owner nor the neighbor has unlimited control over the fate of a tree. One subdivision
overlooking scenic Farmington Valley in Simsbury, Connecticut, has a restrictive covenant in its
deeds bearing homage to trees: Homeowners cannot cut them down, even their own land. They can,
however, trim diseased limbs or branches that block their view of the valley below

-------------------------------------------------------

It would be pretty easy to have the OP's neighbors grant a **usufruct** for fruits. It may encompass all the fruit, or it may only include those in a fallen or picked state, and it may also exclude fruit to one side of the property line.

&gt; The difference in fruits and usufruct as compared to the naked owners and the principal is similar to the talking about the fruits as being different from the tree. The usufructuary does not own the tree but has the full and unfettered right to gather the fruits from the tree. ",2015-10-30 15:01:09+00:00,cwien0j,1.0,t3_3qu0he,7921.0,legaladvice

The town of Postville had an election in 2000 that hinged on To Annex or Not To Annex some land outside city limits —land that had a huge slaughterhouse significant to the local economy. This was Agriprocessors, a kosher meat packing plant owned and operated by Jews. 

Now, just as there are many different types of Christians, there are different types of Jews. Postville's were ultraOrthodox. They were Hasidic, specifically they were Satmar Lubavitcher. (I am not an expert on Judaic sects) Simply, it is as culturally distant from Adam Sandler's ""Hanukkah Song"" as can possibly be. Some of them sacrifice chickens on the sidewalks of Brooklyn in an annual rite. Yes, many of them live in New York and vicinity. Also other countries but I digress.

They moved to Postville to run the plant but didn't try to make friends or fit in with the locals. The locals in turn got steamed over the newcomers' indifference to local people, rules, industrial hygiene, and courtesy.

Eventually the annexation idea became a way for the city government to try to regulate and tax the plant. The Plant management threatened to pull up stakes and leave if that happened.

Here are two links to a book by Stephen Bloom, a San Francisco journalist and unobservant Reform Jew (not orthodox at all) who took a Journalism professorship at U Iowa, got a tip about the town drama, started investigating, and wrote the book on the saga.

**At the time of the indictment—at which point, I will appoint them an attorney.**

&gt; Or is it more likely that native Americans really did use smoke signals, and he was just making a reference?

[Nell Irwin writes](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/01/the-nihilism-of-david-stockman/): ""Stockman and I seem to be direct antagonists on this fundamental question: Should government, in particular central banks, endeavor to corral the ups and downs of capitalism to try to steer their nation toward prosperity? A recurring theme of Stockman’s work is that it is precisely these efforts that have sown the seeds for all that ails the economy."" WaPo 2013

In his tenure as Reagan's OMB director, his office cut taxes and slashed spending (except on Defense) in order to prove supply-side ""voodoo"" economics worked. [The Atlantic, 1981](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1981/12/the-education-of-david-stockman/305760/)

Among others, Krugman and Mankiw were not impressed with the result. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply-side_economics#U.S._monetary_and_fiscal_experience)

I admit there is strong appeal in Stockman's narrative, the sense that bureaucrats and technocratic financiers have perverted an up-and-down unfettered market into an artificial creature subject to political whims of the capital or something. But we don't live in a David Stockman world, any more than we live in a Jack Bauer one.

&gt;Luke stared at the little furnace, as if so doing could hurry the process. Inside, the ingredients for a lightsaber gem cooked at an incredible heat and pressure, hot enough to melt denscris, intense enough to collapse durasteel into a liquid ball. And yet from a meter away, except for the red operating diode, you couldn’t tell the thing was even on. Well, except maybe for a little bit of a smell something like a blaster bolt, a kind of ozone odor.

&gt; The furnace had been working for hours and the little yellow diode had not yet begun to blink, the signal that the process was in the final stage.

&gt; He looked around at the inside of what had been Ben Kenobi’s home. It was a small place on the edge of the Western Dune Sea, made, as so many of the local structures were, of synstone-crushed local rock mixed into a slurry with dissolvants and cast or sprayed onto frames to harden. The resulting buildings were sturdy and proof against the sandstorms. Ben’s house looked almost as if it could have been a natural rock formation, smoothed and rounded by centuries of too-hot-by-day and too-cold-by-night desert weather.

&gt; Ben. Struck down by Vader on the Death Star. The memory was equal parts grief and rage.

&gt; His teacher hadn’t left much behind, not for a man who had once been Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Jedi Knight and a general in the Clone Wars. Perhaps the most valuable thing was the old and intricately carved boawood trunk and its contents, including an ancient leather-bound book. A book that contained all manner of wondrous things for a would-be Jedi, such as plans for building a lightsaber. The thumbprint clasp on the volume had accepted Luke’s right thumb to unlock it, and once it was open, he saw the flashpacket rigged inside the cover. Had anybody tried to force the clasp, the book would have burst into flame.

&gt; Somehow, Ben had known Luke would find this book. Somehow, he had prepared it so that only he could open it safely.

&gt; Amazing.

&gt; According to that book, the best lightsabers used natural jewels, but there weren’t a lot of the kind he needed lying around where he could find them on Tatooine. He’d managed to collect most of the electronic and mechanical parts in Mos Eisley--power cells, controls, a high-energy reflector cup--but he had to make his own focusing jewel. Ideally, the best lightsabers also had three of those, different densities and facets, for a fully adjustable blade, but for his first attempt at building the Jedi weapon, Luke wanted to keep it as simple as possible. Even so, it was trickier than the book made it out. He was pretty sure he had the superconductor tuned right, the amplitude for the length set where it was supposed to be, and the control circuitry boards correctly installed. He couldn’t be positive until the jewel was finished, and the book didn’t mention exactly how long that took. Supposedly the furnace would shut down automatically when it was done.

&gt; If everything went right, he’d be able to cut the jewel, polish and install it, tune the photoharmonics, and then he’d only have to hit the switch to have a working lightsaber. He had followed the instructions to the letter; he was pretty good with tools and it ought to be okay, but there was a small worry that when he switched it on it might not work. That would be embarrassing. Or worse, it might work in a way it wasn’t supposed to. That would be worse than embarrassing: Luke Skywalker, up-and-coming Jedi Knight, a man who had gone one-on-one with Darth Vader and lived to tell of it, vaporized when his faulty lightsaber blew up. So far he’d been very careful constructing the thing, triple-checking each step, and to get this far had taken almost a month. The book said a Jedi Master in a hurry could construct a new lightsaber in a couple of days.

921,"&gt;The history recounted in a recent book on the Constitution’s origins, by Eric Nelson, a political theorist at Harvard, raises that disturbing possibility. In *[The Royalist Revolution](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/10/our-fragile-constitution/403237/)*, Nelson argues that the standard narrative of the American Revolution—overthrowing a tyrannical king and replacing him with a representative democracy—is mistaken. Many leaders of the patriot cause actually wanted George III to intervene in their disputes with parliament, to veto the bills it passed, even to assert that he alone had the right to govern the American colonies. In short, they wanted him to rule like a king. When he declined, they revolted.
 ... 
In this telling, the Constitution created not a radical democracy, but a very traditional mixed monarchy. At its head stood a king—an uncrowned one called a president—with sweeping powers, whose steadying hand would hopefully check the factionalism of the Congress. The two houses of the legislature, elected by the people, would make laws, but the president—whom the Founders regarded as a third branch of the legislature—could veto them. He could also appoint his own Cabinet, command the Army, and make treaties.


------------------------------------------------

&gt; In Federalist No. 51, Madison postulated, ""In republican government, the legislative authority necessarily predominates."" In Madison's original Virginia Plan, the president (or as he called it, the ""National executive"") would have been directly selected by the legislature. While he compromised on an electoral college (on the premise that it would serve more like a nominating committee for Congress to decide), he and his fellow Constitution writers kept the powers of the executive relatively weak... 
[Our system is set up for Congress to predominate](http://www.vox.com/polyarchy/2015/9/11/9310873/decoherence-democracy-doomed). Yet for the last several decades we've seen presidents time after time ignore Congress, pushing the boundaries of executive power to take unilateral action, building policy out of whatever wire and string and glue they can find in existing law, while Congress occasionally legislates in an opposite direction, or at least threatens to.

922,"I'm late to your post, but I wanted to say that there is a lot more *crap* to read and digest than, say, a decade ago. Some of it is sloppy reporting, but some of it is bias and disinformation and [unpropaganda](http://cassandralegacy.blogspot.com/2015/08/why-johnny-cant-understand-climate.html). 
&gt; the public does not lack information, they have too much of it! They are simply unable to make their minds. There follows that we should concentrate on producing high quality information, recognizable as such. It doesn't mean that we should retreat behind the paywall of scientific journals, but that we shouldn't engage in that kind of low level debate typical of troll-infested blog comments. In other words, we shouldn't run after deniers, trying to demonstrate that they are in error. That only generates confusion.

As for GGS, I read that badhistory thread; I also took a class, back when I was a know-it-all, in which GGS was measured up to history's sources and methods. I happen to agree with both of them, and I don't see the problem with that equivocacy. In this case, Diamond's sweeping statements on history are not necessarily incompatible with his errors about, say, deliberate smallpox exposure. However, it is also reasonable to test his claims, and attack his statements if his evidence is flimsy.

938,"Jerry and Beth usually get the B-plots, in contrast to the show's focus on R &amp; M (and sometimes Summer). So he's always had a kind of comic-relief aspect for me, rather than a subject of long-term character development. I believe that the audience sees only snippets of their relationship, and everything unseen is as dysfunctional or affectionate, &amp; as boring or comedic/far-out as we want to imagine. 

Since Jerry's a supporting character, I thought the writers might be [Flanderizing](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization) him (the same way Beth is presented as an alcoholic this season); it's been [discussed elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/rickandmorty/comments/3lbmos/anybody_else_think_beth_jerrys_relationship_is/). Jerry has been written as far more of a butt-monkey in this season. Even his crowning moment of insight at the marriage counseling centre was tainted by his ridiculously craven behavior in the hole-in-the-wall earlier in the episode. I think that's the Jerry being written: mostly a small-time insecure loser, with occasional big victories or redeeming behavior to reaffirm his character's non-worthlessness. 

Look at his story in Meseeks: When his situation inflames to hostages-at-knifepoint, he swings and prevents a catastrophe (of his own making, natch).
Or Rick Potion #9: his insecurities lead him to Beth's vet clinic, where his action-hero shotgunning and crowbarring redeem him. Or Something Ricked, where his insecurity makes him lie to the Plutonians, until he admits the truth.

He started off strong with the Cervine Institute's Cold Stone surprise in this season, but after the Jerryboree and Sleepy Gary stories, he's a buttmonkey. Surprisingly, he was least ridiculous in Get Schwifty, as he and Beth act a bit more like decent parents.

It's easier for Jerry to claim victimhood at Beth's hands than to be more personally responsible. And the more he internalizes that, the more he can reassure himself that it's not his fault/he isn't a worm; his life is difficult because his wife is a monster.

I'm not sure what the writers are going for here, but if there are more Beth &amp; Jerry stories, i'd like them to ""deal with real-life problems, like the ones you face every day"", but I would also ""like to see them do just the opposite — getting into far-out situations involving ~~robots and magic powers~~"" space aliens and exotic technology.

&gt; T.J. Casser of Baltimore suggests that northbound drivers get off I-95 at Exit 109B (Route 279 north) and cross the state line, where 279 becomes Delaware Route 2, turn right onto Delaware Route 2, right onto Delaware Route 896, and then rejoin I-95 North.
&gt; 
&gt; Southbound, he reverses the route in light traffic. But southbound toll backups can extend past the 896 exit during heavy travel, so for this weekend he suggests taking Exit 3 (Delaware Route 273) and jogging north to Delaware Route 4, where you take a left and proceed east until you're back in the Free State.
&gt; 
&gt; The funniest response comes courtesy of Curt Kinder of Green Cove Springs, Fla., who wrote Delaware Gov. Ruth Ann Minner to protest the turnpike's tolls and backups. It wasn't Kinder's vow to ""shun the tollbooth"" that was funny but the fire-breathing response from turnpike spokesman Robert B. King.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I would hasten to point out that deliberate toll evasion within this state, as in most other states, is illegal and subject to enforcement,"" he wrote.
&gt; 
&gt; When called, King attributed that statement to turnpike official P.J. Wilkins, who said he thought taking these toll plaza-avoidance routes could be a ticketable offense. He suggested a call to the Delaware State Police just to make sure. Cpl. Jeff Whitmarsh, a police spokesman, said motorists are free to choose toll bypass routes. ""You're allowed to do that,"" he said.

965,"I will try to explain.

1) 

any YouTube video presented with the line ""&gt; Joe Biden says you need to blast a few rounds off with your double barrel."" MUST link to the appropriate video, of which there has [been only one](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ooPzr1vzmGY), from the folks famous for ""Autotune the News"". I think you disappointed some redditors when you  linked to a video that wasn't *that*. 


It's doubly unfair, because your comment's song video was posted on youtube in Feb 2013, only days after Biden's interview in [Parents ~~30 round~~ Magazine](http://www.parents.com/kids/safety/joe-biden-shotgun-gun-safety/) months before the Autotuned music video was posted in August.



2) 

The blending of piano music and political humor is a style that dates back to [Tom Lehrer](http://www.casualhacker.net/tom.lehrer/jmazner/lehrhtml.html) -- if not farther. As an example, here is Lehrer in 1965 performing ""[National Brotherhood Week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIlJ8ZCs4jY)"". Twenty years later, you have a similar act by Mark Russell. Here's ""[The Line of Death Bar &amp; Grill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZczL-P_5Ps)"" (1986). These kinds of songs combine a lighthearted melody with references to current events and political tensions. It's effective because the political elements of the songs are used in support of the humor and catchyness. In short, it's entertainment first, satire second.
But the musical performer here, [FXHummel1](https://fxhummel1.bandcamp.com/music), reverses that priority. The link is to Tactical Tunes, which showcases his music about governmental and societal disapproval of private firearm ownership. Although he is a skilled musical performer (and there's no disliking a title as funny as ""The Day My Sig Went Sauer""), it's clear that his songs, if you'll forgive the expression, hit only one note. 

So what does this mean about the central question -- why did /u/KaBar42 get the downvotes? Is the song is too far from the social mainstream? Is its appeal limited to an audience of like-minded people who are anti-gov't-regulation? Perhaps it's not political enough in the opposite direction to ""balance"" the song's message--like Lehrer's video linked above, that mocks every faction.


3) 


But then there's the possibility that it emphasizes political points over melodic and lyrical ones. i.e. it's a weak song. Above, I mentioned that this song came out only days after Biden's original remarks. It shows in the quality. Like the lyric (at 0:27), ""I'm one heartbeat away from the presidency"". Is this line necessary, first of all, or is it verbal filler? We all know who Biden is. Then the scansion. These verses follow the general [scansion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Poetry/comments/24h2ko/help_please_help_me_with_scansion/) pattern ˘**/**˘˘˘, **/**˘˘. Of course there are natural variations, such as when an extra syllable needs to be shoehorned in there, and a quarter note is split into two eights (i.e. a crochet is split into two quavers). But the lyrics start to slip: 

""I'll **choose** my words'ev er'so **care**fully"". This causes an awkward stress on the word ""ev**er**"". Try saying it out loud. Now, a song can alter the meter a bit to accommodate this, or change the words. And even then, plenty of hit songs pull this off. ""Dreams"" by Fleetwood Mac: 

""**When** the **rain** wa**shes** you clean, you'll **know**"". Nobody pronounces ""washes"" like that except in song, and it's okay;
it would be NBD, overlookable, if it weren't pervasive like in this song. I literally had to stop for a moment when I heard the line ""I'm **one** heartbeat'a way'from'the pre**si**dency"" just because of the in**tol**erable, **un**for**give**able scansion. Obvious rewrites would have been to remove the line; or append *heart* to *one* and then sing each as eighth notes; or instead of *presidency*, using the term *CINC* pronounced ""Cee in Cee"". Hell, how about ""I'm **one** beat away from being **C**-in-C""? But I don't want to rewrite every line; I just feel that way when I listen to the song.

there. no more edits. old slow mobile sucks.

Personal note: Never heard of FXHummel1 before today. I am certain that some people I fish and shoot with would love his songs, 10/10 with [VX gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rock_\(film\)#Plot). But they would love it because of the song's politics (including Biden's legal advice, which FXH1 correctly pointed out was horrible -- see 2014's Marissa Alexander for proof) which are also FXH's and *their* politics, and because of his obvious performing skills --- not because the song itself is a good song.

975,"Good question. What is cruelty? And what counts as cultural heritage and religious rite?

Are we talking about banning entertainment like bullfighting? Or about rites like Kapparot, which happened recently in Brooklyn: [protest against ritual chicken slaughter](http://www.gothamist.com/2015/09/15/chicken_slaughter_kaporos.php). It's pretty [unsanitary-looking](http://gothamist.com/2015/09/23/kaporos_chicken_videos.php#photo-6) and I was dismayed, but having been on a field trip to an American chicken farm myself, I was not grossed out.

According to the Supreme Court, *""[religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/12/us/supreme-court-excerpts-supreme-court-opinions-ritual-sacrifice-animals.html)""*. Notice that the Court implicitly protects religious exercise along with religious belief. 

Contrast this with the Oregon Peyote case, in which the Court rejected the argument that ""*""prohibiting the free exercise [of religion]"" includes requiring any individual to observe a generally applicable law that requires (or forbids) the performance of an act that his religious belief forbids (or requires).* ""

So, in the USA, we may have to wait until chicken slaughter, like peyote, is blanket-banned. Until then, enjoy your McNuggets!

Probably som of the blame should be shared beyond the architect, to other development firms etc. Anyway, please google, but here are excerpts: (on mobile, sorry for formatting)




Central London’s highest garden opens to the public at some point shortly, depending on which newspaper you read, even though in reality it is less a garden than a waiting area for a nearby restaurant.

www.ianvisits.co.uk/blog/2015/01/04/as-the-walkie-talkie-prepares-to-open-to-the-public/

Your first clue that this isn't a typical park comes when you arrive at reception. Which other parks require you to show photo ID, before passing through airport-style scanners and submitting your bags to be searched? The similarities with an airport do not end there. Initially, the rooftop was billed as the ""hanging gardens of modern Babylon"", with winding walkways passing through themed gardens representing Europe, Africa, Australasia and the Americas. In reality, the architects have created a departure lounge in the sky, with flowerbeds filling the spaces between three restaurants.

Now, in another spate of bad luck, it seems the owners of the skyscraper could be forced to make changes to the Sky Garden after claims that the scheme wasn’t built according to plan.  

In a report published by The City of London Corporation this week, chief planning officer Annie Hampson said the layout of the Sky Garden at 20 Fenchurch Street was different from the plans in the approved Section 106.

www.cityam.com/221232/walkie-talkie-owners-face-fresh-woes-over-sky-garden


A City of London Corporation representative said: ""The garden has fewer trees than were shown in the images. However, for the secretary of state who granted the original permission and for the city, an important feature of the building was that public access to the view and the sky garden was to be provided free of charge to the public.

""This principle is what we have insisted is maintained as set out in a planning agreement. The developers have submitted a visitor management plan to demonstrate how they intend to meet this obligation.

1021,"Okay, so with all that heat in the water, where does it go? Well, warm water is less dense and rises, while cold water sinks. ([demo vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN7E6FCuMbY))

But wait, there's more! Fresh water floats, and salty water sinks, too! Here's a video of cold briny water sinking. [Enjoy some David Attenborough](http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/15835017).

Anyway, getting back to the climate: maybe you've heard of the Gulf Stream? It was [first mapped by Ben Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Stream#History) in the 1760s. It's a major ocean current of warm water that flows along the East Coast of North America before crossing the Atlantic towards Ireland. But it's part of a bigger system, a **much** bigger system called the global ocean conveyor belt. [illustration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation#/media/File:Thermohaline_Circulation_2.png). 


Here's what NOAA's website [says about it](http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/conveyor.html):
&gt; The ocean conveyor gets its “start” in the Norwegian Sea, where warm water from the Gulf Stream heats the atmosphere in the cold northern latitudes. This loss of heat to the atmosphere makes the water cooler and denser, causing it to sink to the bottom of the ocean. As more warm water is transported north, the cooler water sinks and moves south to make room for the incoming warm water. This cold bottom water flows south of the equator all the way down to Antarctica. Eventually, the cold bottom waters returm to the surface through mixing and wind-driven upwelling, continuing the conveyor belt that encircles the globe.

Great. [Here's more explanation](http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=922). (As an unrelated point, here's the (tiny bit of) science behind the movie *The Day After Tomorrow*: if the Great Ocean Conveyor Belt is disrupted by excessive Arctic melt,  the Gulf Stream slows down, starting a cooling event in Western Europe. This is unlikely to happen the way the movie showed, though. Source: ucsb link) 

Also, did you want me to keep it ELI5? Because scientists (a cautious lot, those guys) don't have certainty about the mechanism, but here are three links that suggest how disruptions in the Ocean Conveyor Belt have affected winters.

* A warm patch in the Atlantic subpolar gyre causes a dipole of cold surface temperatures along the east coast of North America: http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2015/03/a-hypothesis-about-the-cold-winter-in-eastern-north-america/

* High temperatures in the West deflect eastward-moving air north; it's cooled by the arctic and blows frigidly on the east. http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/synoptic/201501

* Or it's the Arctic itself that causes the deflection? http://phys.org/news/2015-02-evidence-link-wavy-jet-stream.html

Well, buckle up, here we go!

Anyway, remember that although the sun shines on all 360 degrees of rotating Earth, heat energy is unevenly distributed around the world. Some parts reflect light (like ice) and other parts absorb it. 

Water is very good at absorbing heat, without getting much hotter. You may have seen redditors talking in other subs about fancy water-cooled computers; instead of fans to keep the computers from overheating, they use water, which is more complicated to build, but way more efficient at soaking up heat. ([here's another demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6rb_WkRJoo))

Most of the heat goes into the ocean, [like this](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.climate-skeptic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ocean-heat.gif&amp;imgrefurl=http://hockeyschtick.blogspot.com/2014/09/new-paper-explains-dissipation-of-ocean.html&amp;h=722&amp;w=950&amp;tbnid=qtjZmictcIEl7M:&amp;docid=RH1y4PjHDh_BRM&amp;ei=Kq3zVYHVCYicgwSQtpGIBg&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=0CEAQMygZMBlqFQoTCIGSoqjX8McCFQjOgAodEFsEYQ&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=628).

In fact, [the Nile flooded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flooding_of_the_Nile#The_flooding_cycle) its banks so regularly in the past that the ancient Egyptians developed a calendar system to keep track of it! The annual Nile flood brought rich silty sediments, as /u/MpVpRb points out, which made the lands along the river critical to agriculture.

However, the flooding stopped with the construction of the Aswan High Dam in (i think it was) the 1960s. It is estimated that 4 million acre-feet of water are lost along the Nile valley to aquifer recharge, including a rather complex agricultural drainage system to protect crops from salinization and waterlogging.

1027,"Right. I get what you both are saying about recharge flooding. Of course /u/mynamesyow19 is right; [agricultural runoff is gross and polluting](http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/nps/agriculture_facts.cfm). The way to AVOID RUNOFF is through managing the local 1) topography or 2) peedology.

1: to prevent runoff, dig a trench or pit, and put the water in it, i.e. an artificial pond. Groundwater recharge ponds are a very well-known thing in California, like [this one](http://www.mercurynews.com/campbell/ci_28247340/district-starts-fill-ponds-campbell-and-elsewhere-replenish) that I used to work near, or [this other one](http://www.valleywater.org/services/GrossPondsFishScreen.aspx), both in Santa Clara County.

OR

2: to prevent runoff, make sure the infiltration capacity is high. 
[WIKIPEDIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_\(hydrology\)) says: 
&gt; The soil texture and structure, vegetation types and cover, water content of the soil, soil temperature, and rainfall intensity all play a role in **controlling infiltration rate and capacity**. For example, coarse-grained sandy soils have large spaces between each grain and allow water to infiltrate quickly. Vegetation creates more porous soils by both protecting the soil from raindrop impact, which can close natural gaps between soil particles, and loosening soil through root action.

&gt; * No man-made symbols are present on the satellite imagery in question.

&gt; * The individual who made the initial claim was using technically incompetent techniques to ""analyze"" satellite photography.

&gt; * The retired imagery analyst who initially supported these claims later could not find the symbols that he was so certain were present.

&gt; Before moving on, we do need to tell one more little story. When D [the analyst] came in with his S, E, R story, members of the SSC [senate select committee] asked that he be given some other imagery to see what he could find on it. He was provided with two more  prints. He took them to his office, searched them with his magnifying glass, and returned with both prints covered with red circles. These circles, he said, identified symbols on the ground that resembled the same symbols that are taught to U.S. personnel in SERE training. Then, it was revealed that the imagery he was viewing was satellite photography of Zion Tree National Park in Utah and a surface-to-air missile site in Libya. D had found U.S. MIA distress symbols right here at home. When these facts were revealed, with the C-SPAN cameras rolling, the gallery laughed, certain journalists threw up their pencils in dismay, and D was pissed.",2015-09-11 19:02:14+00:00,cuy84mg,1.0,t3_3kap29,165821.0,todayilearned

~~Edit 2 to add: optional further readings on surfing localism:

As others have commented, surfing localism can get downright uncivil. It's true that if an outsider -- and even a ""[Hawaiian urbanite from Honolulu is considered an outsider on Oahu’s famed North Shore](http://www.authorsden.com/categories/article_top.asp?catid=62&amp;id=45634)"" -- breaches surf etiquette, he's risking vigilante punishment. In an example of what should be considered an *extreme* case, a local admitted to ""beating a non-local surfer so severely that he was taken, critically injured, to a local hospital"". Yikes.

Although such advice seems nearly un-American and against the spirit of free public access, 
&gt;""[you just need to know your place](http://www.unrealhawaii.com/surf/). It’s good to surf at the same spot a lot so you get familiar with people. When you go somewhere new,  if there are local surfers there, respect them. You might be in their backyard. If there are old timers, respect them as well. They could’ve been surfing there for 30 years.""

Similar point of view:
&gt; “It’s kind of a catch-22,” Jaquias said, admitting that foreign surfers travel from afar, spending a lot of money to surf Hawaiian waves. “But at the same time,” he said, “you gotta pay your dues. [You don’t come here and jump right up into the line up and be like you own it, like you’ve always been there](http://www.soc.hawaii.edu/uhtoday/spring2007/j402/Leo/Leo2.html).”

I'd like to think that #NOT ALL LOCALS become violent or dickish when outsiders visit their spots. Nonetheless, there are assholes everywhere there are people, and as /u/lonesurfer posted, sometimes, one of them happens to be a local **[asshole surfer](https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/3h955q/asshole_surfer/)**.

1050,"Short version: It's done locally, not by the state or a higher level of government. (EDIT: according to state law, yes, but not BY the state. Just like someone files for divorce has to follow the laws about divorce-- but obviously the state isn't doing the divorcing.) If a majority of voters want to establish a town, then, if it meets certain rules, then the town is **incorporated**.

Longer version, courtesy of [Dan Engber](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2005/11/how_to_start_your_own_town.html): 
&gt; (It's easiest to start a town from scratch, as opposed to by secession; most upstarts begin as ""unincorporated communities"" within a larger county.) In 2000, Clark hired a surveyor to draw up boundaries for a town that would be a little bigger than a square mile and would include 254 people—of whom only 65 were registered to vote. To found Clark, Texas, he had to convince only a few dozen neighbors it was a good idea.

&gt; To incorporate a town, you'll need a lawyer who can handle the paperwork. Once you've decided on where to put your town, the first step toward You-ville is to get a petition signed by some of the people who live there. In Texas, you'll need 10 percent of the voters. In Arkansas, you need to get 75 signatures, no matter how big your town is going to be.

&gt; An application for forming a town includes the signed petition, a proposed name, and—in some cases—a proposed form of government. There are four basic town governments to choose from—mayor-council, council-manager, commission, or representative town meeting—but some states' laws limit your options depending on the size of your community. Once you complete your application, all you typically need is a ""yes"" vote from your neighbors and the approval of a county judge or state official. In some places, though, a town charter must be granted by vote of the state legislature.

&gt; Depending on where you live, you may face certain restrictions on your right to incorporate. Your proposed town may need to have a minimum number of people, for example, or it may need to be a minimum distance from other towns and cities. The description of where it is should be very specific—for an example, take a look at the charter-specified boundaries of Danbury, Conn. And some states will expect your town to have a unique name, so think again if you wanted to use ""Fairview"" or ""Midway.""

&gt; An unincorporated community gets its services from the county without paying municipal taxes, so frivolous town-founding can be a bad idea. Why might you want to incorporate? First, you could be heading off annexation by a nearby city. The residents of what is now DISH, Texas were afraid of being annexed by Fort Worth. If their land had become part of the city, they'd have faced the high property taxes used to cover social services in less affluent areas. Second, unincorporated communities have very little control over what gets built in the area. But towns can control their own zoning—and thereby protect their property values.

HOWEVER. Your area can also secede from an existing incorporated town, creating a new town that comes with existing infrastructure and stuff. In NJ, where I live now, it's been pretty easy to do that, leading to a lot of little towns instead of big cities (yeah, there are a few). NJ is [ranked #1 in municipalities per area](http://www.njpp.org/blog/november-15-2010-multiple-municipal-madness). That's how you get towns like [Winfield](https://www.google.com/maps?q=winfield,+nj&amp;rlz=1C1CHKZ_enUS434US434&amp;es_sm=122&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAWoVChMIjpqTnu3qxwIVCT8-Ch1RmwHy). 

Because sometimes, out of self-interest, neighborhoods ragequit  their municipalities in order to get better conditions on taxes, transportation, education, anything. 

Or crueler yet, maybe the [secession takes almost all the territory, but leaves the poor veterans' neighborhood behind](https://books.google.com/books?id=o0BmBWloogcC&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;ots=aQY3P3Zhd9&amp;dq=multiple%20municipal%20madness%20red%20bank&amp;pg=PA42#v=snippet&amp;q=drew%20line%20around%20vail&amp;f=false).

EDIT formatting

No you didn't; my bad. Sorry.

The other part of your argument, getting the government out of marriage, is logical, but I have a criticism. Do you feel it better to fight an unfair system (marriage regulations) by attacking its legitimacy and operation, or by marginally improving it &amp; by increasing its fairness?

Let's take two analogies: 

Let's say Dan is opposed to the practice of tipping food servers. (There are SO MANY posts in other subreddits about this; let's not debate it here) So she doesn't tip ever. Sam is also opposed to tipping for the same reasons. Yet he does tip, because it wouldn't be fair to the servers who actually depend on that money.

Let's say Ted disagrees with his organization's leader. He sabotages/obstructs the organization at every opportunity he can, and blames its failures on the leader. Sue also disagrees with the leader, but as the ""loyal opposition "",  does  not object when the leader makes policies that benefit the organization as a whole.

Ted and Dan are letting their ideals lead them into dickishness. Sam and Sue are careful to consider the real world effects.

in this case, (although you're not opposed to equality), you disapprove of a ruling because it kinda entrenches governmental regulation of marriage, even as others here are cheering its benefits to heretofore-marginalized real people. That ideological purism can be pretty unpopular, even with those who agree in principle but not in practice.

1056,"It can also apply to vehicles, such as tanks, planes, or ships.

Simplified:

Think of the ""line of battle"" used by British and French fleets during the Napoleonic wars; all the ships spaced out nose to tail, guns pointing sideways (a ship's sides could fit more guns than the front). If ships broke formation and became positioned side by side, one of them would get in the way of the other's guns.

Or world war 2, when allied bombers over Europe would fly in squad formations, and several  squads formed into bigger formations. This would allow the defensive machine gunners in each bomber to ""cover"" each other from Nazi fighter planes, and also reduce the time over hostile flak cannons. If you fly one at a time over hostile AA, it's gonna be easy to pick you off. If you all fly to the target independently, the lack o f coordination is going to cause a collision. Ergo, fly in a formation.

Back to infantry: you grunts at Waterloo might be facing direct cannon fire, or cavalry charges. Best thing to do in case of cannon is to form a side-by-side skirmish line so that if cannon balls come at you they hit one guy at most. 

But then what if you get charged by bojack horsemen? Each one of you standing unreinforced is going to probably get cut down by a fast-moving cavalry saber. Best thing to do in that case is form a square. That way, no matter what direction the very mobile cavalry charges from, it's repulsed by disciplined musketry.

1061,"Thanks for bringing up **tenancy at sufferance**. I had never heard of this before, I just googled it, and I will bring it up with my dad.



Here's some words about it, strings of which *I don't understand*, (namely a holdover tenancy is and isn't the same thing as at-sufferance?)
from this [PDF at americanbar.org](http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/rpte_ereport/2012/6_december/rp_meislik.authcheckdam.pdf):

&gt; There is great deal of confusion regarding what constitutes a holdover tenancy.
In order to understand what a holdover tenancy is, first you must know what it is not. It
is not a term of years or a tenancy for years; it is not a periodic tenancy; and, it
especially is not a tenancy at sufferance.

&gt; .... A Tenancy at Sufferance is a “wrongful” tenancy. If a tenant overstays its
welcome (meaning it stays in possession after one of the previous three tenancies
ends [i think that means the three types: ""term of years"", ""periodic"", or ""at-will"" --u/HippoLM]), it is a trespasser – it shouldn’t be there; it is wrongfully “holding over.” This is the
true meaning of a holdover tenancy. 

&gt; .... If a lease says that when the tenant remains in the
premises after the term, the tenant becomes a month-to-month tenant (a periodic
tenancy), then the tenant isn’t a “holdover” tenant. Similarly, if a lease says that staying
beyond the term creates a tenancy at will, the tenant isn’t a “holdover” tenant. In each of
these two cases, the tenant would be remaining at the premises with the permission of
the landlord and has the right to be there. That permission remains in force until one
party gives the other proper notice and the notice time has run.
Read your lease form. What does it say? If your lease form provides for a
tenancy at will or a periodic tenancy following the expiration of the term of the lease,
then the lease’s provisions continue in force and the rent is as stated in the lease. A
holdover tenancy is distinct basically because it is wrongful, meaning that a landlord
may be entitled to tort damages for trespass.",2015-09-04 22:38:43+00:00,cuqyplz,2.0,t1_cuqxlrg,2069.0,legaladvice

A good developer also know who's on the commission to approve or deny the plans, and will give them a heads-up so that nobody gets surprised during the actual hearing.

Yes, all of the above, though not in that order.  If it becomes clear that you are trying to evade the zoning rules, they will get very grouchy. They have the power to enter your property:
""I[n order to execute inspections, the staff shall have the right to enter any premises, at any reasonable time, for the purpose of carrying out their duties in the enforcement of the Zoning Ordinanc](http://www.co.clark.in.us/index.php/clark-county-indiana-government/clark-county-indiana-planning-zoning-office)e.

Do you plan on renting a residence(s) out to tenants? What's your plan here? Or is it just one house, for your personal residence?

Keep in mind that if your building plan does not conform to zoning rules, you will have to also skip other steps in the process that require proof of approval.

Excerpt: 'The Invisible Gorilla'
MAY 19, 2010
THE INVISIBLE GORILLA: AND OTHER WAYS OUR INTUITIONS DECEIVE US 
BY CHRISTOPHER CHABRIS AND DANIEL SIMONS

&gt; Chapter 1: ""I think I would have seen that""
&gt; 
&gt; Around two o'clock on the cold, overcast morning of January 25, 1995, a group of four black men left the scene of a shooting at a hamburger restaurant in the Grove Hall section of Boston. As they drove away in a gold Lexus, the police radio erroneously announced that the victim was a cop, leading officers from several districts to join in a ten-mile high-speed chase. In the fifteen to twenty minutes of mayhem that ensued, one police car veered off the road and crashed into a parked van. Eventually the Lexus skidded to a stop in a cul-de-sac on Woodruff Way in the Mattapan neighborhood. The suspects fled the car and ran in different directions.
&gt; 
&gt; One suspect, Robert ""Smut"" Brown III, age twenty-four, wearing a dark leather jacket, exited the back passenger side of the car and sprinted toward a chain-link fence on the side of the cul-de-sac. The first car in pursuit, an unmarked police vehicle, stopped to the left of the Lexus. Michael Cox, a decorated officer from the police antigang unit who'd grown up in the nearby Roxbury area, got out of the passenger seat and took off after Brown. Cox, who also is black, was in plainclothes that night; he wore jeans, a black hoodie, and a parka.
&gt; 
&gt; Cox got to the fence just after Smut Brown. As Brown scrambled over the top, his jacket got stuck on the metal. Cox reached for Brown and tried to pull him back, but Brown managed to fall to the other side. Cox prepared to scale the fence in pursuit, but just as he was starting to climb, his head was struck from behind by a blunt object, perhaps a baton or a flashlight. He fell to the ground. Another police officer had mistaken him for a suspect, and several officers then beat up Cox, kicking him in the head, back, face, and mouth. After a few moments, someone yelled, ""Stop, stop, he's a cop, he's a cop."" At that point, the officers fled, leaving Cox lying unconscious on the ground with facial wounds, a concussion, and kidney damage.
&gt; 
&gt; Meanwhile, the pursuit of the suspects continued as more cops arrived. Early on the scene was Kenny Conley, a large, athletic man from South Boston who had joined the police force four years earlier, not long after graduating from high school. Conley's cruiser came to a stop about forty feet away from the gold Lexus. Conley saw Smut Brown scale the fence, drop to the other side, and run. Conley followed Brown over the fence, chased him on foot for about a mile, and eventually captured him at gunpoint and handcuffed him in a parking lot on River Street. Conley wasn't involved in the assault on Officer Cox, but he began his pursuit of Brown right as Cox was being pulled from the fence, and he scaled the fence right next to where the beating was happening.
&gt; 
&gt; Although the other murder suspects were caught and that case was considered solved, the assault on Officer Cox remained wide open. For the next two years, internal police investigators and a grand jury sought answers about what happened at the cul-de-sac. Which cops beat Cox? Why did they beat him? Did they simply mistake their black colleague for one of the black suspects? If so, why did they flee rather than seek medical help? Little headway was made, and in 1997, the local prosecutors handed the matter over to federal authorities so they could investigate possible civil rights violations.
&gt; 
&gt; Cox named three officers whom he said had attacked him that night, but all of them denied knowing anything about the assault. Initial police reports said that Cox sustained his injuries when he slipped on a patch of ice and fell against the back of one of the police cars. Although many of the nearly sixty cops who were on the scene must have known what happened to Cox, none admitted knowing anything about the beating. Here, for example, is what Kenny Conley, who apprehended Smut Brown, said under oath:
&gt; 
&gt; Q: So your testimony is that you went over the fence within seconds of seeing him go over the fence?
&gt; 
&gt; A: Yeah.
&gt; 
&gt; Q: And in that time, you did not see any black plainclothes police officer chasing him?
&gt; 
&gt; A: No, I did not.
&gt; 
&gt; Q: In fact, no black plainclothes officer was chasing him, according to your testimony?
&gt; 
&gt; A: I did not see any black plainclothes officer chasing him.
&gt; 
&gt; Q: And if he was chasing him, you would have seen it?
&gt; 
&gt; A: I should have.
&gt; 
&gt; Q: And if he was holding the suspect as the suspect was at the top of the fence, he was lunging at him, you would have seen that, too?
&gt; 
&gt; A: I should have.
&gt; 
&gt; When asked directly if he would have seen Cox trying to pull Smut Brown from the fence, he responded, ""I think I would have seen that."" Conley's terse replies suggested a reluctant witness who had been advised by lawyers to stick to yes or no answers and not volunteer information. Since he was the cop who had taken up the chase, he was in an ideal position to know what happened. His persistent refusal to admit to having seen Cox effectively blocked the federal prosecutors' attempt to indict the officers involved in the attack, and no one was ever charged with the assault.
&gt; 
&gt; The only person ever charged with a crime in the case was Kenny Conley himself. He was indicted in 1997 for perjury and obstruction of justice. The prosecutors were convinced that Conley was ""testilying"" — outlandishly claiming, under oath, not to have seen what was going on right before his eyes. According to this theory, just like the officers who filed reports denying any knowledge of the beating, Conley wouldn't rat out his fellow cops. Indeed, shortly after Conley's indictment, prominent Boston-area investigative journalist Dick Lehr wrote that ""the Cox scandal shows a Boston police code of silence … a tight inner circle of officers protecting themselves with false stories.""
&gt; 
&gt; Kenny Conley stuck with his story, and his case went to trial. Smut Brown testified that Conley was the cop who arrested him. He also said that after he dropped over the fence, he looked back and saw a tall white cop standing near the beating. Another police officer also testified that Conley was there. The jurors were incredulous at the notion that Conley could have run to the fence in pursuit of Brown without noticing the beating, or even seeing Officer Cox. After the trial, one juror explained, ""It was hard for me to believe that, even with all the chaos, he didn't see something."" Juror Burgess Nichols said that another juror had told him that his father and uncle had been police officers, and officers are taught ""to observe everything"" because they are ""trained professionals.""
&gt; 
&gt; Unable to reconcile their own expectations — and Conley's — with Conley's testimony that he didn't see Cox, the jury convicted him. Kenny Conley was found guilty of one count each of perjury and obstruction of justice, and he was sentenced to thirty-four months in jail. In 2000, after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear his case, he was fired from the Boston police force. While his lawyers kept him out of jail with new appeals, Conley took up a new career as a carpenter.
&gt; 
&gt; Dick Lehr, the journalist who reported on the Cox case and the ""blue wall of silence,"" never actually met with Kenny Conley until the summer of 2001. After this interview, Lehr began to wonder whether Conley might actually be telling the truth about what he saw and experienced during his pursuit of Smut Brown. That's when Lehr brought the former cop to visit Dan's laboratory at Harvard.",2015-09-02 19:01:10+00:00,cuofshe,1.0,t3_3jb8ny,54358.0,todayilearned

THIS IS JUST AN EXCERPT; click the link to read the whole thing!
&gt; In nationalist scholarship, nationalism traditionally is seen as having two forms, which can be called French and German nationalism (although I don't like these terms). By a nation I'm referring to a group of individuals who identify themselves as part of a larger community, the nation, to which they belong based on possessing characteristics or traits shared by each individual member with each other individual members of that nation. However, ""nationalism"" as a broad concept does not essentially define what those characteristics or traits need be. In fact, this is what makes nationalism such a powerful force in modernity, as the definition of a ""nation"" can change according to the needs of the time, even if this requires blatant contradiction, hypocrisy, or delusion.

&gt; The division of nationalism into its two forms, French and German, comes from a division in the definition of these shared traits. French nationalism, emerging during the French Revolution, was essentially political. Citizens ascribed themselves to the French nation based not on shared ethnic, cultural, or biological traits, but rather by shared ideological beliefs and goals. Freedom, liberty, and democracy defined the Revolutionary nation, and the borders of the nation as we think of it today meant less than the transcendence of these ideals. So much so, in fact, that the French Revolutionaries viewed a Polish revolutionary as a citizen simply because he propagated revolutionary ideologies, despite doing so in a separate country entirely. Having been founded upon principles of universality, French nationalism could do nothing but be free from any innate characteristics--thus ruling out any ethnic, racial, or cultural nationalist sentiments.

&gt; At the same time, nationalism based on ethnic, racial (biological), and cultural characteristics certainly exists. A pure French nationalism could be seen as inclusive by intent--anyone who picks up the rallying cry can be part of the nation--and exclusive in consequence, while a pure ethnocultural (my preferred term over German) nationalism could be seen as the opposite of this--exclusive by intent, based on traits which are possessed only by a specific peoples and which cannot be adopted by any outsiders, such as bloodline or biological traits [OR ideology; dissenters cannot join! -- HLM]. This nation as an inclusive body can only follow from the exclusion of others--a shared trait is only shared among some if it is not shared among others. In this way, ideological nationalist sentiments are dangerous to the nation and cannot stand alone.",2015-09-01 08:48:06+00:00,cumu9cg,6.0,t1_cukqk8e,154326.0,television

1116,"NYC has an excellent water supply, but when it comes to distribution, ""the last mile"" of infrastructure leaves much to be desired, specifically when the water leaves public mains and enters private plumbing. A lot of buildings are old, and their pipes are old, and *then there's the water towers* on the buildings:
&gt; The thousands of tanks that dot the skyline are part of a water system that originates at 19 protected lakes and reservoirs in upstate New York. City officials like to boast that the system provides the finest tap water of any city in the world.
&gt; 
&gt; But the vast system of safeguards protecting the water supply virtually ends at the curb. From that point on, it is up to building owners to ensure that their tanks are cleaned, inspected and tested for bacteria annually, as required by the city’s building and health codes.

1117,"At a busy intersection near me, this situation happens all the time. Rarely do drivers allow gaps for others to turn left into in business driveways so close to the major intersection. However, at unsignaled side streets near the major intersection, there is a sign requiring a gap. Drivers will pass the destined driveway, then use the signed gaps for U-turns, then make right turns into the driveway.

(As an aside, in NJ, even if that Do Not Block [the side street] sign weren't there, law would still require a gap, because [that counts as an intersection, and blocking it is illegal](http://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/2013/title-39/section-39-4-67/), so no pulling forward if you can't get out of the way.)

It seems like, since your encounter was at a driveway instead of at a public side street, (or worse, a real intersection) you were ok. However, as a matter of courtesy, if oncoming had only one lane and no way for other cars to pass Angry Lady, I would have left a gap. 

If I'm mistaken and Angry Lady was turning onto a public street running east and ALSO west, then maybe ""Do Not Block Intersection"" applied and you should have left a gap.

EDIT: I now see that it was a private alleyway, and not a public roadway. She shoulda just turned/continued east on 38th and turned right at the other alley.

TL;DR: You had the right of way despite the red light, since AL was making the left. (Ind. Code § 9-21-8-30 : Indiana Code - Section 9-21-8-30: Intersections; vehicles approaching from opposite directions; yield of right-of-way), ~~UNLESS 1) Indiana has a law like NJ's about blocking intersections that I couldn't find, AND 2) she was turning onto a ""real street"" and not a mere driveway which would make that spot an unsignaled intersection.~~

&gt; Civil rights advocates and some elected officials here trace the tensions to “zero-tolerance policing,” a crime-fighting strategy championed by Martin O’Malley, the former governor and a potential Democratic candidate for president, when he was the mayor of Baltimore from 1999 to 2007. Aides of Mr. O’Malley note that on his watch, the number of annual homicides dropped below 300 per year for the first time in more than a decade, and that violent crime in Baltimore dropped by 41 percent. Steve Kearney, a top aide to Mr. O’Malley when he was the mayor, described the policies as “appropriate for the time.”
&gt; 
&gt; But zero-tolerance policing led to mass arrests of people for small infractions, as well as intense “community frustration,” Ms. Kumar of the A.C.L.U. said. “Countless innocent people,” she added, “were getting caught up in this dragnet style of policing.”
&gt; 
&gt; In 2006, the A.C.L.U and the N.A.A.C.P. sued Baltimore, alleging a broad pattern of abuse. The city settled in 2010 for $870,000 and publicly abandoned zero-tolerance policing. But people here say tensions persist.

&gt; During his first term, O'Malley brought New York City's data-driven CompStat policing model to Baltimore, built it out to CitiStat, and launched, memorably, the ""Believe"" campaign, putting his name into national media spotlight for the first time. The CitiStat efficiency model has since been adopted by cities across the country. ...

&gt;...
Hilliard, who later directed the department's communication section, said CompStat ""put cops on dots."" O'Malley then took the process to other agencies, and linked it to 311 non-emergency calls related to city agencies. ""Using that model and expanding it to other city agencies, holding them accountable, that's probably the most innovative thing he's done. It works,"" says Hilliard, who now directs community services for Harbel, Northeast Baltimore's neighborhood association. Hilliard adds that counter to his folk- rocker alter ego, O'Malley could be ""a holy terror"" in CompStat accountability sessions.

There's a footnote that says 
&gt; (4) Lit. ""inhabited,"" many of the cities of Asia being then as now
    deserted, but the suggestion is clearly at times ""thickly

So one conclusion is that it means **densely populated**.

In other cases, cities are **uninhabited** because they've been evacuated or abandoned. In the above linked section (bk I.ii), the city of Tarsus 
&gt; ""had been deserted by its inhabitants, who had betaken themselves, with Syennesis, to a strong place on the hills.""

---------

Another is that inhabited means simply ""lived in [by X]"". As in, ""Dallas is inhabited by Texans."" OR ""Weirdos inhabit Florida.""

It's tough to give that up. Meat tastes very good (let's not lie to ourselves) and veganism means walking away from that, one hundred percent.

First of all, OP wrote it's the fall that kills ya. Just like someone falling off a twenty-story cruise ship (or jumping off a tall bridge) can break her neck when she hits the sea, a liquid of low vscosity when ht at a high speed, is hard as pavement. If it's a high-viscosity liquid like lava, then the impact speed can be much lower and you'd still break your neck.

Ok, next point. Ever belly flop into the pool? It stings! There is more body surface smacking the water than if youdid a perfect greg louganis dive that barely breaks the surface &amp; hardly causes a ripple. Either way, (unless you have low natural buoyancy like me), you bob back up to the surface.

Now, if it's  viscous lava instead of water, chlrine, and pee, the belly flopper (or the guy who tips over and lands on his back) is barely going to peetrate the surface before floating (&amp; igniting, &amp; dying). Whereas Mr Louganis will get maybe alfway in before he stops getting deeper, and is forced back up to the surface because of isostasy/buoyacy.

finally, when you think of lava, you're probably thinking of that third star wars movie where Anakin/vader is injured by lava. However, a lot of lava flws are *walkable*. this is because the upper part cools off and forms a crust. At hawaii vlcanoes national park the rangers would ave a kiluea trail you could walk on, and it was mostly old lava flows, but in parts between jagged blocks f of black pahoehoe basalt crust you could see thin glowing lines of orange or red! Now, these trails had really thick crust, but as the route approached the freshest, hottest lava, the crust got thinner. Not like paper thin, but it went down to maybe five inches. And those were the areas open to the public. It's not a stretch to envision a thinner crust closer to the vent cracking in two because you stepped on it. And while you wouldn't go deep if you were on your belly, a leg with half your weight on it would punch through.

In an article in Current Biology in February, Dr. Pritchard suggested that a lot of natural selection may take place through what he called soft sweeps.
&gt; 
&gt; Soft sweeps work on traits affected by many genes, like height. Suppose there are a hundred genes that affect height (about 50 are known already, and many more remain to be found). Each gene exists in a version that enhances height and a version that does not. The average person might inherit the height-enhancing version of 50 of these genes, say, and be of average height as a result.
&gt; 
&gt; Suppose this population migrates to a region, like the Upper Nile, where it is an advantage to be very tall. Natural selection need only make the height-enhancing versions of these 100 genes just a little more common in the population, and now the average person will be likely to inherit 55 of them, say, instead of 50, and be taller as a result. Since the height-enhancing versions of the genes already exist, natural selection can go to work right away and the population can adapt quickly to its new home.",2015-08-07 18:08:36+00:00,ctv1pe3,5.0,t1_ctv0yb7,1055.0,explainlikeimfive
1155,"(continued)
&gt; In premodern times, Brace surmises that the main method of eating would have been something he has christened “stuff-and-cut.” As the name suggests, it is not the most elegant way to dine. It goes something like this. First, grasp the food in one of your hands. Then clamp the end of it forcefully between your teeth. Finally, separate the main hunk of food from the piece in your mouth, either with a decisive tug of your hand or by using a cutting implement if you have one at hand, in which case you must be careful not to slice your own lips. This was how our ancestors, armed only with a sharpened flint, or, later, a knife, dealt with chewy food, especially meat. The “stuff-and-cut” school of etiquette continued long after ancient times. Knives changed—from iron to steel, from wood-handled to porcelain-handled—but the method remained.

&gt; The growing adoption of knife-and-fork eating in the late eighteenth century marked the demise of “stuff-and-cut” in the West. We will return to the fork (and the chopstick and the spoon) in Chapter 6. For the moment, all we need to consider is this. From medieval to modern times, the fork went from being a weird thing, a pretentious object of ridicule, to being an indispensable part of civilized dining. Instead of stuffing and cutting, people now ate food by pinning it down with the fork and sawing off little pieces with the table knife, popping pieces into the mouth so small that they hardly required chewing. As knives became blunter, so the morsels generally needed to be softer, reducing the need to chew still further.

&gt; Brace’s data suggest that this revolution in table manners had an immediate impact on teeth. He has argued that the incisors—from the Latin incidere, “to cut”—are misnamed. Their real purpose is not to cut but to clamp food in the mouth—as in the “stuff-and-cut” method of eating. “It is my suspicion,” he wrote, “that if the incisors are used in such a manner several times a day from the time that they first begin to erupt, they will become positioned so that they normally occlude edge to edge.” Once people start cutting their food up very small using a knife and fork, and popping the morsels into their mouths, the clamping function of the incisors ceases, and the incisors continue to erupt until the top layer no longer meets the bottom layer: creating an overbite.

&gt; We generally think that our bodies are fundamental and unchanging, whereas such things as table manners are superficial: we might change our manners from time to time, but we can’t be changed by them. Brace turned this on its head. Our supposedly normal and natural overbite—this seemingly basic aspect of modern human anatomy—is actually a product of how we behave at the table.

&gt; How can we be sure, as Brace is, that it was cutlery that brought about this change in our teeth? The short answer is that we can’t. Brace’s discovery raises as many questions as it answers. Modes of eating were far more varied than his theory makes room for. Stuff-and-cut was not the only way people ate in preindustrial Europe, and not all food required the incisor’s clamp; people also supped soups and potages, nibbled on crumbly pies, spooned up porridge and polenta. Why did these soft foods not change our bite much sooner? Brace’s love of Neanderthals may have blinded him to the extent to which table manners, even before the knife and fork, frowned upon gluttonous stuffing. Posidonius, a Greek historian (born c. 135 BC) complained that the Celts were so rude, they “clutch whole joints and bite,” suggesting that polite Greeks did not. Moreover, just because the overbite occurs at the same time as the knife and fork does not mean that one was caused by the other. Correlation is not cause.

&gt; Yet Brace’s hypothesis does seem the best fit with the available data. When he wrote his original 1977 article on the overbite, Brace himself was forced to admit that the evidence he had so far marshaled was “unsystematic and anecdotal.” He would spend the next three decades hunting out more samples to improve the evidence base.

&gt; For years, Brace was tantalized by the thought that if his thesis was correct, Americans should have retained the edge-to-edge bite for longer than Europeans, because it took several decades longer for knife-and-fork eating to become accepted in America. After years of fruitless searching for dental samples, Brace managed to excavate an unmarked nineteenth-century cemetery in Rochester, New York, housing bodies from the insane asylum, workhouse, and prison. To Brace’s great satisfaction, he found that out of fifteen bodies whose teeth and jaws were intact, ten—two-thirds of the sample—had an edge-to-edge bite.

&gt; What about China, though? “Stuff-and-cut” is entirely alien to the Chinese way of eating: cutting with a [tou](http://www.thekitchn.com/the-only-knife-you-need-the-mu-127724) and eating with chopsticks. The highly chopped style of Chinese food and the corresponding use of chopsticks had become commonplace around nine hundred years before the knife and fork were in normal use in Europe, by the time of the Song dynasty (960-1279 AD), starting with the aristocracy and gradually spreading to the rest of the population. If Brace was correct, then the combination of tou and chopsticks should have left its mark on Chinese teeth much earlier than the European table knife.

&gt; The supporting evidence took a while to show up. On his eternal quest for more samples of teeth, Brace found himself in the Shanghai Natural History Museum. There, he saw the pickled remains of a graduate student from the Song dynasty era, exactly the time when chopsticks became the normal method of transporting food from plate to mouth.

&gt; This fellow was an aristocratic young man, an official, who died, as the label explained, around the time he would have sat for the imperial examinations. Well, there he was, in a vat floating in a pickling fluid with his mouth wide open and looking positively revolting. But there it was: the deep overbite of the modern Chinese!

&gt; Over subsequent years, Brace has analyzed many Chinese teeth and found that—with the exception of peasants, who often retain an edge-to-edge bite well into the twentieth century—the overbite does indeed emerge 800—1,000 years sooner in China than in Europe. The differing attitude to knives in East and West had a graphic impact on the alignment of our jaws.

&gt; The knife as a technology goes beyond sharpness. The way a knife is used matters just as much as how well it slices. The tou that cut this Chinese aristocrat’s food a thousand years ago would not have been significantly sharper or stronger than the carving knives that were cutting the meat of his European counterparts at the time. The greatest difference was what was done with it: cutting raw food into tiny fragments instead of carving cooked food into large pieces. The cause of this difference was cultural, founded on a convention about what implements to use at the table. Its consequences, however, were starkly physical. The tou had left its mark on the Chinese student’s teeth, and it was there for Brace to see.",2015-08-07 18:05:54+00:00,ctv1l6p,4.0,t1_ctv1kiu,27.0,explainlikeimfive
1156,"EDIT: rlx02 is mostly correct. it's the utensil for preparation that does it, not the utensil for dining. (the kitchen knife, not the table fork). However, as Western knife-and-fork custom developed at the table, the effect on dentition became the same, i.e. overbites because of small individual food morsels. Whether it's a Western diner seated at the table in the present day, or it's a Chinese chef in the kitchen from a bygone dynasty who is doing the cutting, the small morsel size is there.

As an anecdotal aside, if your daughter wants to impale her chicken breast on the tines of her fork and take bites out of it as if she's eating a drumstick, don't scold her for it. Rejoice in the possibility that she won't need braces.

/EDIT

From the book* Consider the Fork* (Bee Wilson, 2012, Basic Books), Ch 2: Knife

&gt; Much of the science of modern orthodontics is devoted to creating—through rubber bands, wires, and braces—the perfect “overbite.” An overbite refers to the way our top layer of incisors hangs over the bottom layer, like a lid on a box. This is the ideal human occlusion. The opposite of an overbite is the “edge-to-edge” bite seen in primates such as chimpanzees, where the top incisors clash against the bottom ones, like a guillotine blade.

&gt; What the orthodontists don’t tell you is that the overbite is a very recent aspect of human anatomy and probably results from the way we use our table knives. Based on surviving skeletons, this has only been the “normal” alignment of the human jaw for 200 to 250 years in the Western world. Before that, most human beings had an edge-to-edge bite, comparable to apes. The overbite is not a product of evolution—the time frame is far too short. Rather, it seems likely to be a response to the way we cut our food during our formative years. The person who worked this out is Professor Charles Loring Brace (born 1930), a remarkable American anthropologist whose main intellectual passion was Neanderthal man. Over decades, Brace built up the world’s largest database on the evolution of hominid teeth. He possibly held more ancient human jaws in his hand than anyone else in the twentieth century.

&gt; As early as the 1960s, Brace had been aware that the overbite needed explaining. Initially, he assumed that it went back to the “adoption of agriculture six or seven thousand years ago.” Intuitively, it would make sense if the overbite corresponded to the adoption of grain, because cereal potentially requires a lot less chewing than the grainy meat and fibrous tubers and roots of earlier times. But as his tooth database grew, Brace found that the edge-to-edge bite persisted much longer than anyone had previously assumed. In Western Europe, Brace found, the change to the overbite occurred only in the late eighteenth century, starting with “high status individuals.”

&gt; Why? There was no drastic alteration in the nutritional components of a high-status diet at this time. The rich continued to eat large amounts of protein-rich meat and fish, copious pastries, modest quantities of vegetables, and about the same amount of bread as the poor. Admittedly, the rich in 1800 would expect their meat to come with different seasonings and sauces than in 1500: fewer currants, spices, and sugar, but more butter, herbs, and lemon. Cooking styles certainly evolved. But most of these changes in cuisine long predated the emergence of the overbite. The fresher, lighter nouvelle cuisine that appeared on tables across Europe during the Renaissance goes back at least as far as 1651, with the French cookbook by La Varenne called Le Cuisinier françois; arguably, it goes back still further, to the Italian chef Maestro Martino in the 1460s, whose recipes included herb frittata, venison pie, parmesan custard, and fried sole with orange juice and parsley, all things that would not have looked out of place at wealthy dinners three hundred years later. At the time that aristocratic teeth started to change, the substance of a high-class diet had not radically altered in several hundred years.

&gt; What changed most substantially by the late eighteenth century was not what was eaten but how it was eaten. This marked the time when it became normal in upper- and middle-class circles to eat with a table knife and fork, cutting food into little pieces before it was eaten. This might seem a question of custom rather than of technological change, and to some extent it was. After all, the mechanics of the knife itself were hardly new. Over millennia, people have devised countless artificial cutting implements to make our food easier for our teeth to manage. We have hacked, sawed, carved, minced, tenderized, diced, julienned. The Stone Age mastery of cutting tools seems to have been one of the factors leading to the smaller jaws and teeth of modern man, as compared with our hominid ancestors. But it was only 200 to 250 years ago, with the adoption of the knife and fork at the dining table, that the overbite emerged.
