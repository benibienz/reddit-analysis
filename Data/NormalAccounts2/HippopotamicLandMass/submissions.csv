note this concept might not include compound words like *bookworm* (""neither a book nor a worm""), *firearm*, or *headcheese*... but it might indeed include **eggcream**. I don't know.

I saw this post: http://np.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4b7d6m/san_franciscos_first_automated_restaurant_is_pure/ 
and it got me thinking... nowadays, automation in the service industry cuts on personnel costs, but the idea was conceived so *early* (1897)! (and yet it didn't really catch on) 

Was it for the same payroll-cutting reason? 

Was the equipment sturdy enough to not break down all the time? 

Did people prefer using machines instead of customer service interaction back then?

Alternatively, why didn't the last hundred years see growth and imitation of Automat restaurants? They're a bygone relic now, but automation is still [an industry objective today](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-07/20/15/enhanced/webdr03/edit-15679-1437421012-8.jpg).

That didn't make sense. Why would Major call her Rita if everyone else at the Max Rager office calls her Gilda? So I looked into it.

* In the last 5 minutes of ""Grumpy Old Liv"", we see her, unnamed, in Du Clark's office while he gives Major his zombie-killing order/blackmail, and then in Liv's apartment -- Liv calls her roommate **Gilda**. This is the first time she gets a name.
* Major calls her **Rita** in the morning-after scene from the ""Even Cowgirls Get the Black and Blues"". This is the first instance of the name Rita.
* At the Max Rager company gym, Major's ogling co-worker says something like ""**Rita** is a walking visit from H.R."" (""Love &amp; Basketball"")
* in the Max Rager basement lab, Dr Lockett says, ""The blood sample **Rita** provided us was the key."" (""The Hurt Stalker"")

Conclusion: Leanne Lapp's character was first credited as Gilda because that's the first time we heard anyone say her name.

My dad (who claims to be very smart/smarter than Iam) bought a house, and rented it to a residential tenant on a multi-year lease that ended in May. The tenant didn't move out when the lease was NOT renewed (60 day Notice to Move Out was given). Today, Dad successfully got an Unlawful Detainer judgment so I guess the Tenant will soon be helped out by the Sheriff. 

Meanwhile, Jun/Jul/Aug rents are unpaid, and Dad has to go back to court later, namely to Small Claims, because the judge handling the recent eviction said that was a separate action. Without a lease in force, and with my dad having expressed in writing (the notice) that the Tenancy ended in May, how can the tenant (voicing his reasoned argument) be liable/obligated to pay the unpaid rent? 

My dad says that the tenant has an ""obligation by operation of law"" and is ""obligated to pay reasonable value"". The tenant obviously disagrees. **What common law, case law, or statute can he cite in Small Claims Court to counter the delinquent tenant?** He told me he was gonna use [Ross vs Long Beach](http://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/ross-v-city-long-beach-25741) and [Ellingson v. Walsh, O'Connor &amp; Barneson](http://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/ellingson-v-walsh-oconnor-barneson-25432) but he's not a lawyer and IANAL either. I couldnt really find how those two cases are applicable to his situation and I worry he's gonna screw it up. At least he won't complain about a gold-fringed flag!

There are other tenancy issues at play here that i'm sure youse'll enjoy; will update the post to add in more details an update after i do some chores.

*Edit/Details*: 

The house is a fixer-upper. Dad advertised for a handyman tenant who would [get a reduced rent in exchange for performing an agreed-upon list of improvements](http://codes.findlaw.com/ca/civil-code/civ-sect-1942-1.html). Dad got the tenant, a construction worker, to write and sign documents attesting to handyman skills, equipment, and insurance coverage (in case he cut off his own thumb or something, i guess). If Tenant didn't want to perform the repairs personally, he would have to hire a craftsman on his own. All this was in the lease. Guess what: The tenant didn't do the work! 

About 2.5 years into the lease term, my Dad demanded that Tenant get started on either making repairs or hiring professionals before the lease ended, and Tenant said ""well, [the place has been uninhabitable since I moved in, and I shouldn't even have to pay you rent](http://www.caltenantlaw.com/Habitability.htm); you're lucky I've been paying you at all, etc."" It was around this time that Dad had to start dropping by the house regularly to get the monthly rent, because the rent checks got bouncier than normal (Since he did not enter the apt, the ""24-hr notice before landlord comes to the residence"" rule didnt apply).

*continued:*

In April, Dad showed up in person to give the 60-day notice. (Big surprise, the lease wasn't going to be renewed.) Dad gave the paper to Tenant's adult sister, and also mailed a copy to be sure. Dad also called to set up an inspection walkthrough before moveout, but couldn't get a hold of Tenant. Dad drove to the rental house a few times, but Tenant stopped answering the door. 

The next month, Dad had to respond to a [Civil Harassment temporary restraining order](http://www.courts.ca.gov/1279.htm) that the tenant filed. The tenant accused Dad of threatening behavior/langugae since April: coming to the house and harassing him and his family, threatening to shoot him if he didn't move out, and yelling dirty racial slurs at him. 100% not true, but a judge believed the accusations and Dad couldn't go on the property any more.

*continued some more:*

So, today, (and whip your ~~Justice Boners~~ comeuppance chubbies out.) the Tenant claims in defence of Unlawful Detainer, he never got 60-day notice to move out. Dad says he gave it to Tenant's Sister on such-and-such date in April. Tenant says Liar, nobody was at home then. Dad pulls out the Tenant's Civil Harassment filing, and shows the date that my dad came to the property to allegedly harass Tenant's Sister, exactly 60 days in advance. The judge (not the same one as before) said ""Well?"" and the tenant says, Uhh, who keeps track of dates anyway? 

Then, after that, the tenant raised the issue of habitability, and said to the judge that he wanted his total rent from the entire lease term to be refunded because the house was uninhabitable. The judge said, That's going to have to be a separate action. *denied!*


Not a great gotcha moment in the courtroom, but when all was done, dad got the Writ of Possession.

&gt; **[Kansas city, MS]** A neighbor kid climbed over my fence, entered my kitchen through window and was eating some snacks. My dog was sleeping in my bedroom. He must have heard noise and thought it must be thief. To protect house, he barked and bit the kid. Now, the parents are extorting medical money.

did you see that ""kansas city, MS""? So that was the post I found suspicious. There's been at least one teen redditor openly claiming to submit fakeposts to the legal advice sub, but we tend to treat posts as genuine.

My question is, do any KCers in this sub know of anyone who doesn't know that Missouri = MO? or anyone that uses MS instead of MO? I figure that the expression ""kcmo"" is ubiquitious.
