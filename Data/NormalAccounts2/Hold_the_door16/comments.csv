1,This happened to me as a kid!!  There were a few times in elementary school where time would just speed up and I wouldn't be able to concentrate because everything was too distracting. I never really told anyone since I knew they wouldn't believe me. ,2016-11-01 23:48:46+00:00,d9hlt2u,2,t1_d9gy0tx,28339,AskReddit

24,"I went to hang out with my aunt at her dorm the night before her college graduation when I was 18 years old.  Once be both got pretty drunk, we noticed that it was pouring outside.  We convinced ourselves that the nearby golf course was our own personal slip-n-slide.  Of course this lead to my only clothes that I brought with me not only being soaking wet, but having terrible grass stains on them.  The next thing I knew, it was morning, and I was laying on the couch wearing a dry t-shirt and running shorts, probably given to me by my aunt.  I began to worry about my mom coming to pick me up and noticing that the only graduation appropriate clothes I had were completely soaked.  Fortunately for me, blacked out me had not only washed my filthy clothes, but also dried them, ready for me to wear the next day.
