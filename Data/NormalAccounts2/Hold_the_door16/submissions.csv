It's been detrimental to my running career. Whenever my throat starts croaking it's harder to breathe, which pretty much makes going out for a run impossible.  The croaking is usually set on by eating or drinking, especially carbonated beverages. Even water sets it off.  I've learned to cope with this over the years by simply not eating or drinking anything at least 3-4 hours before running. Unfortunately, this only works ~75% of the time. So at least one of my runs per weeks is absolutely dreadful. Also, I'm usually starving and dehydrated by the time my run starts. I know I could be so much better if I were able to eat and drink closer to running. Anybody have any any solutions? ",noburp,Anyone else here who is a runner?
