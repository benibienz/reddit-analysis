Adults are way less happy, where as teens are generally way happier. The reason being that celebrity culture has given teens the idea that they can have an amazing adult life full of riches and luxury. The downside is that once they become adults, they do no achieve that.

I want in no way mentally or socially prepared to be in a foreign place, living with foreign people, with no friends and away from my family. I think if I had done it after college, it would have gone much better.

In college, I studied abroad in Copenhagen and it was amazing. I was much better equipped to handle making friends/navigating a new city.

175,"As someone in their mid-twenties (a disclaimer because I'm not going to pretend I have a ton of life experience) who asked themself this question literally every day in a fit of terrible depression that lasted about a year here are the answers I've found:

*1. Day dreaming is great. It can take you out of terrible situations and provide some comfort, but if you spend too much time ruminating on a life you're not leading, you will never actually have the motivation to do things that will get you closer to that life. You have to accept where you are in order to find out your options to change.

*2. I don't know how old you are, OP, but one of the most comforting statistics I've read is that people who were asked what the happiest decade of their life was tended to say their 30s. A lot of (I'd guess most) people struggle with this question in their 20s, and for some reason, shit just works out. IF, however, you are older, I hear your 60s can be pretty sweet too.

*3. If I'm being perfectly honest, I think a lot of people just self medicate. Booze, antidepressants, weed, exercise, sex...everyone self medicates in some ways. Some ways are healthier than others. ",2016-07-27 17:43:24+00:00,d5t8o1y,1.0,t3_4uvbck,6577.0,AskReddit

239,"Does anyone have a theory on why the WW were ""awoken"" again after 1000 years in the prologue of the first book? I had a theory that it was because of Jon's birth (as the first child born from ice + fire), which in my mind would fit the timeline (takes them 14 years to make enough wights to make an impact once their magic is reawoken), but that got shot down pretty quickly.

371,"Day 1: 25F, 5'9"", SW 218lbs, GW 160lbs.

I started taking antidepressants about 3 years ago. I immediately gained 60 lbs in 6 months and have been trying to get it off ever since. I finally stopped taking antidepressants (with the help from my doctor) 3 months ago to try and lose the weight and have more energy. It's been hell. The emotional turmoil caused me to gain 5 more lbs.

I'm finally feeling a big more normal and ready to add back in healthy habits. I'm just easily frustrated. I tracked everything I ate for 3 years using MyFitnessPal. It didn't stop me from binge eating. I feel like I don't have time to work out and have a social life and keep my job AND get enough sleep. It's  very emotionally overwhelming.
