We see her at the church digging her own grave, etc. We assume these are memories because the premise of the glitch in the hosts' programming from the first episode is that they were given access to memories in order to make the hosts more lifelike.


* However, this does not make a lot of sense to me in terms of the story arc. Why would she be solving the maze again? How could the circumstances of her becoming conscious be repeated? Isn't the only reason she's able to be off her loop is because she's with a guest?


* I'd like to offer a different explanation in light of the most recent episode. Dolores is remembering due to the update....but only Arnold's instructions on how to solve the maze. She is PROJECTING or IMAGINING herself going to those places Arnold has mentioned. That is the final step to achieving consciousness. This is shown when she overwrites her programming in order to shoot the men attacking William. She said she ""imagined a world where she was not the damsel in distress"" and was able to act upon that.



Edit: Even if I am wrong about her projecting herself into these situations, I don't think the idea of the power of imagination should be easily dismissed. @Jay_Quellin noted that Bernard says to Elsie ""the hosts aren't imagining things, you are,"" indicating that this is something only conscious people can do. Maeve even mentions that she can imagine being whoever the fuck she wants to be.",westworld,"[Spoilers Episode 5] Not memory, but imagination",https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5acegw/spoilers_episode_5_not_memory_but_imagination/

Dolores spoke to Arnold right before he died. Do you think he uploaded his conciousness into her before he killed himself, and the maze is a way for her to ""unlock him,"" not by finding her own conciousness, but his? He knew Ford would stop him from destroying the park, but by secretly giving Dolores the instructions, she'd be much more likely to succeed. The maze is her finding Arnold within herself.

Ford, however, mentioned how technology had increased so much that they could cure virtually any illness. This would make sense considering Delos can seemingly 3D print organs and perhaps do some gene editing.

MiB also has a vested interested in curing people, as that one guest stated that his foundation ""saved his sister's life.""

This raises a few questions:
If technology can cure virtually any illness, why did Bernard's son die? Did the incident occur before the technology existed? Did the incident occur at all? Is the technology related to MiB's foundation? Is the technology limited to Delos? If so, does Bernard hold a grudge against Ford for not releasing that information to be used to help cure people?

I think the ability to use AI technology to cure illness or even prevent death entirely is a prominent theme, and this should be noted.",westworld,Why did Bernard's son die?,https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/59jvys/why_did_bernards_son_die/

What's the first thing you do? Fly.

I lucid dream a lot. It's an amazing feeling when you realize the limitlessness of a world around you that isn't actually real. You can hack the system. You can have sex with who you want, make celebrities appear and disappear, but there's something in our basic human instincts that immediately wants to defy what we understand of physics to fly. 

Elon Musk believes we are living a similar world, a matrix. He has publicly stated this and given very logical reasoning. I'm surprised that no one has written on how this belief could be a huge driving factor in his success. If the world isn't real, and more importantly, if like a lucid dreamer you're one of the few people who can realize this, wouldn't you immediately take advantage of this knowledge to hack the system to succeed? This belief opens up limitless possibilities. You can learn more than you think, sleep less than you need, and push the boundaries of knowledge.

I don't think it's a coisidence SpaceX is making such great leaps to help us fly.
