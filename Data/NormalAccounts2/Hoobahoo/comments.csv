If in the end you lose some friends because you were away doing something great for you, then do you really want people like that in your life? You will make better friends than that and they might even be the ones you meet when you study abroad.

30,"I agree with everything you had to say but for the sake of time I am going to make it into an easy list of things to improve.

-If you are worried about view count, look for topics that are topical with today's society. For instance, currently you could make a video on what Islam really is. Guaranteed views and you get to stick with your educational show. Just a thought, you don't have to go with it.

-Record higher quality audio (this is crucial, sound can make or break a video.) This includes your intro. Rerecord it with higher quality sounds.

-Utilize better lighting (Good lighting grabs the attention) The most recent video on Art Explains, about headaches looked very amateur immediately because of the natural light on one side, and then the room light on the other. 

-Look into getting a higher quality camera to record with. Fixing your light setup might help you out with this, or getting a better camera might fix your light situation. Figure out which is more affordable right now and go for it.

-Really Bill Nye the shit out of your info, love it every word of it and we will love it too.

-Don't push your jokes, and don't make too many of them.

One last thing and this is just another suggestion, but perhaps try an episode where you are stood instead of sat. Or at least record a bit of it and see if you like the look of it better. Right now I feel as if you are tied to a chair and I think this might be due to the fact that you never use your arms. I feel like a fishing line is tied around your torso.

However, maybe once other things have been addressed this won't feel as weird! Best of luck to you man!

If, however, you would only like to be ensemble, get a general feel for the overall musical genre of the show and find a band that embodies that and use a song from them.",2015-06-28 00:35:00+00:00,cskzbgh,1,t3_3bcs7k,1463,Broadway
