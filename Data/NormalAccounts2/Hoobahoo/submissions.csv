So I'm using jquery to fade in some elements on a single page site. When I load up the site from www.example.com, the jquery in a certain section doesn't work on 1 line permanently hiding some content. The console has nothing to say about this.
However, when I load the page to go directly to the parent div of the hidden content: www.example.com/#gallery, that single line works just fine.
The code that I am using to hide and show different galleries. The '.gallerySection' selector is the class for the title pictures of each gallery section, just for some clarity. Click on the gallery section title picture, the gallery should fade in.


        $('.gallerySection').on('click', function(){
            var target = $(this).attr('rel');
            $('#'+target).fadeIn(600);
            $(this).siblings('div').fadeToggle(600);
            $('.hideTop').fadeToggle(600);
        });

The $('#'+target).fadeIn(600); is the line that consistently fails on me if I load the page without #gallery in the url. This is the code I am using to load the #gallery from the url because that whole parent div with the title pictures is hidden from the start.

    if(window.location.href.indexOf(""gallery"") &gt; -1) {
           $('#gallery, #menu, #title').show();
            $(""#enterButton, #tagLine, #homeImg"").hide();
            $(""#title"").animate({
            position:""absolute"",
            margin:""0px auto"",
            marginTop:""0px"",
        },500);

Any clue? Need more of the code? Anything, just ask. I've been racking my brain on this one and have no idea why it won't work.

I've been trying to find the perfect CMS for my very basic needs. Basically something I could just pop on top of my already built stuff, define editable regions and allow my clients (friends who don't pay me anything, just pay for their site to be live) to edit those regions of text or what have you. Services like Perch, Sitecake, and Surreal seemed like the perfect solution.

I tried out the 14 day free trial of Surreal and when I was setting up I realized that it basically goes through my FTP to make the changes. So I am wondering if any of you know of an FTP addon that has a nice WYSIWYG editor that might serve my needs?

I'm trying to avoid a service I have to pay for because as I mentioned above, I'm not making anything from these sites as this is just a hobby of mine right now and I am just making some portfolio sites for friends.

I have recently built a portfolio website for a friend and he has already asked on multiple occasions that I update phrasing or wording in sections of the site. I would like if I could give him a username and password to have so that he could ""log in"" to his own site and edit the simple stuff himself. Hopefully so that it shows up something like this demo from Create.js :

http://createjs.org/demo/hallo/

I don't know much about mySQL and from what I have read, it sounds like this might be something I need to study up a bit more on.

I've also seen a bunch about using a CMS; however, seeing as how I have written the files and uploaded them to my host, I am not sure how this would work. Besides, I really like the idea of my client signing in and navigating through the pages editing at will.

Other than that, what sorts of things should I be looking at when going about achieving this. Even links to (up to date) tutorials would be more than welcome.
