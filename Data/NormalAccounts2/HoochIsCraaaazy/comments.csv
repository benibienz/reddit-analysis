I don't know much about martial arts, but I don't see how the training on its own will help add mass if there isn't any resistance training involved. I'm sure it has plenty of core, balance, and flexibility skills that can be gained, but I don't think you are going to get bigger from it. 

If you want to gain healthy weight you need to eat a surplus of calories combined with some sort of resistance training. That means either lifting weights, or doing some sort of body weight progression calisthenics. If you prefer that over the gym and weights, check out r/bodyweightfitness. 

You should figure out your TDEE and then make sure you are eating in a surplus. This can get you started http://www.iifym.com/tdee-calculator/. ",2016-08-05 08:46:38+00:00,d654p8a,3.0,t1_d654jyc,485.0,Fitness
320,"What are your goals outside of living a healthy lifestyle? You don't mention if you want to lose weight, gain muscle etc., but you state you aren't thin and don't want to go to the gym. 

If you want to lose weight, you need to burn more calories than you consume. Right off the bat I'd say you need to evaluate your meals. Bread for breakfast on it's own is not good. You should try eating oats, fruit, and something with protein. Not necessarily those items every day for breakfast, but that's a very basic guide to get some carbs and protein in. If you like bread buy a high protein bread like Ezekiel and add peanut butter and a banana. That will give you probably 12g of protein plus carbs, fats from the nut butter and fruit. I don't eat eggs but if you do, that's a super high protein food with overall low calories, I use tofu in place of eggs for this. 

Also, do you mean you get dizzy as soon as you get up, as in if you get I too quickly from lying down? If so, that could be normal. If not, I'm no doctor at all, but that doesn't seem normal. I can't think of a single time I've ever gotten out of bed in the morning and got dizzy brushing my teeth or taking a shower.

420,"All of your questions are basically proving my argument. No I have no idea what the parents were like, the animals were surrendered to a shelter. I don't care how the animal's grandparents died, I would bet most people who are getting a dog don't care either, they just want a nice companion or a good pet for their family. I've raised dogs from 8 weeks old and I've adopted dogs at 3-4 years old. They can all be great pets with love and care. It doesn't matter if their great grandfather was a blue ribbon winning blah blah. The majority of people who get dogs aren't getting them to be show dogs, so what does their pedigree actually matter? Also selective breeding has actually caused many breeds to be far cries from what they used to be, which have actually led to health problems. Look at what we have done to pugs as an easy example. 

If you want a specific breed, you can find it from a rescue organization. If you don't, I bet you'll be just as happy with any mutt that you show some love and affection. You can keep saying all of these very specific questions as a way to justify getting a dog from a breeder, but this is irrelevant to the majority of people who just want a good family pet.

By going to a breeder or pet store, you are not choosing to adopt an animal that has a high percentage of being killed in a shelter. 

Also you can get 8 week old puppies from shelters. Look on petfinder.com, and I bet within 100 miles of where you live (unless you are seriously rural and remote) you can find almost any breed or at least a mix containing a preferred breed and many ages. We've adopted puppies and older dogs from shelters, our first puppy was adopted at 8 weeks.

For the most part, zoos are money generating facilities that sell admission and attractions of wild animals and aren't necessarily the best environments for the animals. In general many animals at zoos live in extremely small living conditions and climates that are not favorable for the animals. 

True sanctuaries don't build attractions for the sake of selling tickets, their goal is to protect animal species which are endangered, and typically provide much better living conditions for their animals. Gorillas and other primates should not be in captivity, if this animal was at a true animal sanctuary for gorillas, this death would not have occurred.
