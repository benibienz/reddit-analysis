Any opinions on which would look best?

I was initially very excited that the base model didn't have any leather until I realized I couldn't get all of the safety features in the base model. 

I think it's pretty crappy of a car manufacturer to make safety features an upgraded feature only available in better models, especially when those models add leather. 

At the end of the day my family's safety is more important than anything but it's really annoying to now have leather parts in my car that I didn't want.
