My argument was that these companies could use a placebo effect as a way to state that they have followed the letter of the law. A study showing an effect could be construed to technically meet the standard of ""show it has an effect, or admit is has none"". Then there was argument over whether placebos are real. And what may qualify as a placebo.

My original point: Those selling the snake oil will take *any* loophole they can legally get their hands on to sell. Even if they lose in the end, they'll likely take home millions of dollars before getting shut down (as they have been doing already). So close the loophole.

More argument about what may be a placebo, or how the placebo effect works, or whether it's valid ... is very noisy but doesn't address the fact that this argument would actually be had in front of a jury, not on reddit, and by the time it happens there would be millions in losses.

I didn't read the entire article, and a scan did not provide me with exactly what occurred between them.

If you are a HeeHaw fan, you'll remember this: The patient says ""it hurts when I do this"". The doctor says ""don't do that"".

If your doctor wants you to experience pain to run a test again, when you've already confirmed that the previous solution has caused the pain to lessen greatly ...

Well, maybe it wasn't that blunt. But I bet you're experiencing one of three things, and your doctor is an idiot for not going in this direction (found the blunt):

1) You're not quite gluten free. It's hidden in many things. You're getting cross contamination. You missed a label. Kissed your spouse after a sandwich. Something. *or*

2) You are sensitive to something *other* than gluten (as in ""in addition to""). It's not actually a requirement to be sensitive to one substance at a time. That's not a rule. Anywhere

3) Your diet is leaving something out that your body needs, and it's causing you discomfort. My wife is GlutenFree and has found that she *must* take potassium and magnesium pills to ""maintain"". More exercise = more of these two substances. However: With those pills she's fairly normal. And this was confirmed one day when I took her to the emergency room (almost by force, but not really) and was instantly put on a potassium drip (within minutes of arrival, since she had used the magic words ""chest pain"" and they have a rule ...).

So ... take vitamins (gluten free ones, of course), or vary your diet to see if you can find what's missing. Or go on a Three Day Unflavored Rice and Unflavored Water diet and see if the discomfort fades. That would at least rule out sensitivity to everything else (except ... rice).",2016-11-19 07:18:21+00:00,da6qmu2,1.0,t3_5dnbbk,53120.0,glutenfree

Your statement, not mine. Mine was

If you are a clergy person seeking power, would you choose a religion that offered a simpler-to-get-there method? If your statements are true, then they chose a very good means to their goal.

That being said: Who are we to set the standards for religion or government outside our own countries? 

And if we're talking about inside our own borders, then to say that we (as a group) don't like this religion because it seems to have a higher percentage of fanatics begs the question: Where's the threshold? And who decides where the threshold is?

Answer: Obey the law of the land. If you stay within that law, you're below the threshold as an individual.

That's all we can do. (Well, some groups have been disbanded after having generated too many fanatics, but that's not unique to any one religion either, ask anyone in Waco.)

223,"I note that you did not share any of your overall symptoms. Most people who get tested for gluten-related problems have symptoms that brought them to the doctor.

So, go gluten free for a week and see if those symptoms seems to wear off at all. Be sure to get enough actual nutritional value from what you *do* eat. GF beginners have a tendency to just cut out gluten, but that can leave you with deficiencies. Of course, if you're otherwise healthy a week of GF won't do you any harm even if you have *some* deficiencies, but do be careful. If you don't notice any abatement after a week, you can try this (which I've suggested to several people):

1) Go back to a regular diet until you feel as though you're ""normal"" for a few days.
2) Eat ONLY unflavored Rice and drink ONLY unflavored water for three days. 

If this causes your symptoms to fade, after three days, you have at least identified your problem is related to intake. After that, there's a lot of ways to go, but it's a good start.

If you've been eating well, and are otherwise healthy, three days of rice isn't going to have a notable detrimental effect (except on your brain, which will ""want"" everything else! LOL). But if your symptoms subside, it will have been worth it. If they don't, it's still arguably worth it as you may want to look into other possible causes.

FYI: Qualify=No is not actually a good thing. There are very few circumstances where it's a good idea. 1) If your round trip packets take too long, usually due to QoS, but the audio actually sounds OK: Then the Qualify would kill the call before it started. 2) Some carriers (very few) do not respond to qualify packets. Then the calls never happen even though they would succeed.

So if you have situation 1), you would merely need to increase the qualify time (instead of ""no"", use a number that represents adequate round trip time).

Qualify is specifically designed to disable a carrier if it's offline or round trip packets take to long. Instead of sending the call, waiting for fail, then failing over ... you fail over immediately if the carrier is ""unreachable"" (fails qualify). So turning it off is usually pointless.

Properly done, this could be what finances the restaurant until you can get advertising up and functional.

Think of it this way: A restaurant can put their steak on tin foil and cook it. But without the broiler marks, without the flavoring, and without the tasty side-stuff, this meal may not be as fun as it could be. What if you were to provide gluten-free flavoring for steak that surpassed regular flavoring? Sure the gluten-free steak may cost an extra buck to prepare, but that patron will be astounded at the lack of ""bland"". And if there's also pastry on the table that they can eat or a bread-substance that can be dropped off as an appetizer, another barrier is broken: My wife has to sit and watch us nibble on bread and ""whatever"" while we're all waiting for the first course (ie: salads).

Your loan of a piece of hardware to a friend is arguably risky, but not illegal. Hacking is illegal.

If you file a legal complaint, you loaned the equipment and may have to sue to get it back. But the hacking of the online accounts is still a crime and actionable.

If the account belonged to a rich person, the culprit would already be in jail. Not being rich doesn't change the law, just the amount of pressure you must apply to get the law enforced.

All that being said: If those NSFW images were all of ""legal adults"", you're possibly OK. But if you had those images in a place where a minor would have had access to them, intending that she she them, or at the very outside NOT taking steps to avoid her seeing them, then you may have a problem.

426,"You could also have been building up the headache through lack of sustenance by trying to remove gluten from your diet. Do a little more  studying and remember that just removing gluten isn't really possible. Since gluten is in so many foods, you're possibly removing essential nutrients your body needs in addition to removing gluten.

That being said: 24 hours is ""usually"" not enough to cause a huge issue nutritionally, *if* you were well-nourished before you began.

So start from a well-nourished moment. Eat nothing but unflavored rice for three days (or some other single-item unflavored staple to keep your tummy from freaking out) and of course unflavored water. Be very careful not to cross-contaminate. This means you can't take the rice out of something and then eat it, or cook it in a pot that has not been thoroughly cleaned. No flavoring, no cross contamination.

If at the end of the three days you are hungry but clear headed with many fewer (or hopefully NO) symptoms ... now you just have to experiment by adding single fresh substances to your successful test.

One or two per day while avoiding symptoms. Don't do it for too long, pay attention to your energy levels and clear brain. You have a lifetime to experiment with this IF you don't screw yourself up by over-dieting and hurting your system. ",2016-10-27 05:53:09+00:00,d99nald,1.0,t3_59l600,18734.0,glutenfree

513,"&gt; I told him I was on a gf diet and needed to take it in a month or two after eating gluten to be accurate and he said ""no, we will test for it now. it won't affect the results"". so I got a negative test because I was already on the diet.

1) Your doctor is an idiot. File a complaint against him after researching the fact that this was wrong. Brainstorm for 15-30 minutes a day until you can come up with a new division/department/organization once per day for 30 days to get it pushed through his brain that he's a doctor and it's not acceptable in that position to ""decide"" he knows everything. He's supposed to study and become an expert on these topics or frankly admit he knows nothing and send you to a specialist. Everyone who is in any way involved in this speciality (gluten issues) knows that you must have glutened yourself normally for a full month to take that test AND that false negatives are ""the norm"". They really aren't negatives, they are merely ""not this time"" results.

2) You sound A LOT like my wife. Same scenario. My fault (or I take the credit? LOL). She was not positive it was something she ate, but was pretty sure. I told her to eat White Rice (unflavored) and Water (unflavored) for three days and see if that reduced or rid her of symptoms. We were both very surprised (and relieved) when it actually helped dramatically.

She's still fighting the battle, but with my support and with the kids support. While you don't have us as a family, please consider this your ""we're with you!"" notice and also your ""you're not crazy!"" notice. 8)

One thing she's good at, and it has helped: Continued online research on the topic. Your system is screwed up, there are no longer any rules about how it will work. Part of being screwed up. So you can't rely on any common sense rules, just what you observe and experience. And remember that your body CAN change the rules at will.

My advice: Try supplements to keep your nutrient levels good and your attitude up. We found that she does not properly absorb/generate/whatever potassium and magnesium any more. More exercise, more she needs. She ran a half-marathon and had to pop potassium/magnesium/salt tablets every 15 minutes to avoid cramps and fatigue. We found this out a few months before the marathon when she could barely move (exhaustion) and had chest pains. I took her to the emergency room (almost against her will, but not really, she just didn't want to spend the money or time) and the doctor (which she saw immediately due to the phrase ""chest pains""!) immediately put her on a potassium drip due to stupid-low levels in the blood test. Since then, she has to take the pills differently on different days to avoid cramps, but now she knows.

For those who don't believe you, stop telling them. Get your facts straight (online research) and tell only those involved in cooking/preparing your food. Others don't need to know unless they actually ask. Getting the medical details straight, about how unpredictable this condition is and how many people it affects, is quite useful. Consider this: Why does almost every Disney restaurant and every seriously expensive restaurant now have a gluten-free option? Because NOT having GF was affecting their bottom line because That Many people are affected. WE don't go to restaurants that have no GF options. And if they gluten her when she orders Non Gluten ... we don't go back for a few years.

You don't need other people to ""buy in"" to your medical issues. The world already has. In the 60s everyone smoked and thought nothing of it. Now we have something that is similar ... but only to 5-10% of the population. Odd, but true.

You'll be different, everyone is. But supplements can help you get whatever your body is having problems making or absorbing, and if you keep looking, you should be able to find a doctor who actually knows about this topic.

Point to ponder: A log where you track your eating habits and symptoms could help YOU determine overlaps. Remember that these symptoms are not necessarily immediate, but they can be. ",2016-10-12 00:42:51+00:00,d8o4w2b,1.0,t3_570n09,10156.0,glutenfree

515,"While every person with gluten-problems is different, of course, my wife visited the ER because of exhaustion and heart irregularities (we panicked) and found that she was dangerously low on potassium. They put her on a drip upon arrival (heart problems = immediate facetime with doctor and tests to determine the problem).

Now she takes potassium and magnesium pills to make up for what apparently amounts to her body's ""lack"". Luckily, the trigger is obvious these days: Muscle pain and fatigue = take some. She ran a half-marathon and had to pop those suckers every 15 minutes. But she did finish in the middle of the pack, in her first marathon :)

2) If you do choose to attempt a diagnosis, do your research first. You'll find it necessary to return to a normal ""fully glutened"" diet for at least a month before a diagnosis would be likely to succeed. False negatives are ""the norm"", often several of them before a real diagnosis.

3) Don't bother with a doctor who isn't a specialist in this area. And be wary of those who have a single-diagnosis record (ie: everyone is gluten-intolerant, but no one seems to have Celiac, or vice versa).

You sound like you are describing a physical sensation that could actually be attributed to what's happening to your villi. The theory is that the body reacts to the gluten, but destroys the villi in the process.

I wonder where in the system your villi are compared to where you have this feeling, and if perhaps you are experiencing a burning sensation as your body is reacting to the gluten (burn resulting from attacking immune system?). If that's the case, the villi could be the ""visible"" result of the attack, but technically the attack could be happening everywhere (thus, you feel it everywhere the gluten is being attacked and not just at the villi).

The challenge is that you are using asterisk through FreePBX which is a dummy-interface to make things easy for you. But that comes with a cost of ""you gotta do it our way"". 

To break extension/extension into separate entities, you must understand that it's really ""sip user account context"" / ""username"". And to make all this simple and intuitive for you, FreePBX calls this ""Device and User Mode"" (not Account and User mode, of course ... but if you equate ""Device"" to ""sip context"" ... well, I'm off topic, sorry).

Excerpt:

About Device &amp; User Mode

By default, FreePBX operates in ""Extension Mode."" In Extension Mode, devices (such as phones) and users (people) both use the same identification number, i.e. their extension number. Each Device (Phone) is assigned one User (Extension) and they cannot be changed without accessing the FreePBX User Interface. A single module, entitled ""Extensions"" will manage the device settings and the user settings.",2016-10-08 01:05:26+00:00,d8iod4e,1.0,t3_51rg7i,2545284.0,freepbx

I was about to ask my wife how the heck we were supposed to convey to the servers which kind of punch I wanted, but she shushed me with a serious look on her face. After we got our punch and back to the table was the first time she'd let me talk.

536,"When you want to ""win"" a debate, everyone else's opinion is ""ignorance"". But when the debate is about the opinion of the person you asked, I'd have to wonder which one of us was being ignorant by tossing an insult into a conversation about opinion. Once again, of course, just my opinion.

Changing the timeline from the real one (12 years, not 6 years) to prove your point while quoting an article piece to try to prove it's really useful is a challenge, however. Your wishful thinking that 3 drivers is proof that it's working is of course bolstered by a cutting the timespan in half, but since that's not the real start date it's not changing my opinion.

And let's look at that quote a bit more:

&gt; Into the 2010s, the diversity program's impact appears to be increasing, ...

Promising ... but does say ""appears"" while not offering any understandable proof of this other than quoting an article that ""appears"" to indicate that the biggest progress is: ""Progress is female and minority drivers battling in real, competitive races on their own before they ever audition."" In other words, the progress is NOT in NASCAR, but elsewhere. Wow. Not so promising after all.

And to continue ...
&gt; ... with one of the biggest problems being the continued perception of NASCAR as an all-white and non-inclusive institution...

While offering no reason to believe that perception should be incorrect or changed. This is my point. In my ignorance, my opinion, along with the rest of the world (including the author of your article), is that NASCAR is perceived in this fashion. Not ""was"" but ""is"" (""continued perception""). With nothing worthy of note to demonstrate that this is incorrect or any concrete steps are being taken to change the reality. Just a token program which attempts to change the ""perception"" and fails.

It's 2016. Non-whites are somewhere between 14-38% of the overall population in the US. What percentage of NASCAR drivers are non-white?

While you state that there is ""100% placement"" in service personnel, let's clear that up by skipping the Sale jargon and head over to: What percentage of skilled service personnel are non-whites? If that number is over 7%, I'd be impressed. But I don't see a number. I'm just guessing here that there's a reason I don't see a number. Don't get your socks in a knot, now, this is *my opinion*. LOL

And while I did ask about the percentage for skilled service personnel, I still have to point out that my opinion on those service persons being ""members of the team"" hasn't changed: They are not the primary focus, the Driver is the Star and always has been. One way to solve this (in my opinion): If the Team decided to clean house and fire everyone they did not like after a qualifier, and replace those ""team members"" with different personnel, could they be denied because those new team members were not present for the qualification? (That's a Team, otherwise, they're just service providers ... albeit highly skilled, and likely dirt-stupid to fire them all on the eve of a race.)",2016-10-05 16:36:24+00:00,d8f6zqw,13.0,t1_d8eb2xa,58996.0,SeriousConversation

Please note that many people have different thresholds, and I'm quite certain that knowing the value in each item would suddenly make it possible for a measurable portion of the country to choose foods within their limits.

I equate it to having a dummy light on the dashboard for the battery charge. When the light comes on ... it's too late. But if the value were always shown, you could make you decision to test the battery whenever it was no longer ""normal"" for you vehicle. While this would, in fact, require paying attention to the gauge, I'm pretty sure those who have any form or level of gluten intolerance are already watching the gauge intently. Unfortunately, all that's available is a dummy-light and that's both unreliable and poorly defined in the first place.

...

&gt; Don't have $1,000,000 in sponsorship? Sucks for you. You don't race.

That's the rig. No one says ""whites only"" anywhere, but you've not convinced me that the best drivers are in the races, just the best White drivers. Possibly not even the best there, just the most popular with those in the sport ... But that's the fix. 

That's why it's not so much a sport as a club. If you can't ""be the best"" to rise to the top (without regard for anything other than ""the best""), then it's a good 'ol boy's club.

And unlike the Men Only clubs (with the Suits and Cigars) who were open about this, they are tight-lipped and smart enough to NOT make a written policy, so no one can sue them to fix it.

But if Kanye cared, he'd pop $1M on the best driver he could find and bust it open. But Kanye doesn't care. Can't say I blame him.

The organizations involved are purely White Upper Income. I tried to find a black NASCAR driver as an example for one of my kids a few months back. Couldn't find one. And no matter how hard anyone tries, I can't be convinced that's an accident. Statistically speaking, there's no way that this game isn't rigged (not the outcome of the races, but the inclusion of those allowed to race).

You want the entire country involved in a sport? Involve the entire country. But I strongly suspect any such attempt in the NASCAR arena will be met with sudden ""NON-interest"" by those in charge.

Honestly, I consider it the last bastion of the white-supremacists who are never going to change, but are smart enough to NOT say anything out loud. And of course by ""smart enough"" I refer to the fact that they don't ever slip about blacklisting someone (for any reason, much less skin color).

And to be clear: I have NO evidence of any of this aside from the absolutely whitewashed inclusion list.

Oh: And for me (personally), the challenge would be availability. We have Netflix, Amazon Prime, and a lot of DVDs and a brand new Cinopolis movie theater across the street. But none of those have NASCAR events.

So, in the end, where's the draw? At least football teams will have a stadium in a local place.

Failure of the hardware will still bring it down ... but then again, failure of the hardware will ALWAYS bring it down. LOL

We run all our servers without any Telephony hardware VOIP (SIP) only. Thus if a server dies for any reason, it can be replaced without any special physical equipment being required.

In fact, Grandstream has ""gateways"" that serve this purpose precisely. Many clients in the past have used grandstream gateway to 'virtualize' a physical telephone connection so they could re-route the calls to a centralized server and bounce them to any physical location they like by having agents accessing that centralized server.

Yes, false negatives appear to be the norm. Positive counts, but negative just means ""not this time"". And there are so many subcategories ... best to find out what your body will support and skip the pigeonhole names until you can eat like a normal human (albeit with some missing items) or avoid specific areas/plants/buildings (or whatever it turns out to be).

567,"Not likely gluten withdrawal. But more likely your diet changed so much you were not getting the nutrients your body regularly requires. And you did this long enough to cause your system to be unable to function. While it's a good thought to give up gluten for your son, it's NOT the same as shaving your head in support of a cancer survivor. You don't need hair.

My wife is gluten free because she found that all her pain went away and she no longer had fits (oddly similar to the one you described) randomly during any time of the day after she gave up the gluten. We try to support her by Trying her nasty gluten free food (which has improved immeasurably over the last year as she's found better sources!). But we do not go gluten free ourselves to avoid malnutrition issues.

Since she's gluten free and NOT by choice, she goes out of her way to take supplements. Additionally, she's found that she needs to take salt, magnesium, potassium just to get by on many days.

If all you do is remove gluten, and all the nutrition in all the foods that you usually get with your gluten, you'll likely continue to have these problems. And you're not getting any health benefit from it aside from greatly reducing the likelihood of cross-contamination from Your Gluten into His.

... Which is actually huge, as we've found: My middle daughter grabbed a hamburger bun, then used it to scoop up a patty ... wife got the next patty with her gluten free bun, but the damage was done. In hindsight my wife did not have to spend the rest of the night in pain had she realized what we all did later and NOT grabbed that next patty, but one below that had not had the contact. Or had the daughter just used a fork.

There's a new tester on the market that purports to be capable of actually testing food for gluten-free-ness. I'm seriously thinking of getting it for Christmas. So we can go to a new restaurant and TEST the food instead of ""hoping"". LOL",2016-09-29 17:39:35+00:00,d875yz8,1.0,t3_5536mh,2323.0,glutenfree

576,"There are some very good doctors who ""get it"" spread across the country. You can also order your own tests for the various related conditions. But mostly: Gluten free is hard to manage but ""doable"" and if it removes the pain it's too obvious to overlook.

And while skipping the gluten ... search for that doctor. Then change insurance in January to match the doctor in question. 

But be ready for a multi-year search and some false starts. And mostly: Do your own research. I think of it like the fine print in most service agreements: You're ultimately responsible for this yourself anyway, so having a doctor that is on-topic is great, but until then you have to make life Fun (not just livable) for your offspring. :)

Disney restaurants have gluten free options. Outback is usually pretty good IF the staff and chef are ""on board"".

Next up: Take the advice I gave my wife when she was having this Exact Same Problem (with the addition of serious unexplained fatigue that would last for a few hours). I told her to Test the Theory and put it to rest. Nothing but Rice and Water for three days. While the ""offending substance"" may not be entirely removed from your system in 72 hours, it certainly should become obvious that either the symptoms (aside from craving stuff you like) are pretty much gone, or they are not.

Do not flavor the rice or the water. If there is an allergy to something he ingests (other than rice), it should clear up and make it obvious that this is substance related. If there is an allergy based on location, of course, the symptoms will persist and it's ""white room"" time (but with a pizza? LOL) for the weekend. In the ""truly unlucky"" event that the white room still has no effect ... get a doctor who will chase this to ground! Pain is not something that is a normal part of life. Don't get used to it.

Happy Hunting!

(PS: She thought it was stupid at the time ... but the symptoms were Gone in three days, she's been battling the Gluten Free diet ever since!

Control scripts are written in Perl, php, agi, javascript and AJAX. Challenge: Since this is all very much interactive and environment-specific (not to mention processor intense), a rewrite would be less cost-effective than purchasing a new computer to put Vicidial onto. You can purchase a Vicidial server for $950 (+ shipping), or you can put a few hundred hours into coding to try to port all the applications to windows. I'd go with the purchase option. Or lease a server.

A much less expensive option (free?) is to take whatever computer you have lying around (old desktop system or laptop gathering dust?) and put in the latest Vicibox.com .iso ... and follow the instructions in the PDF from the Vicibox.com site.

But the funny thing was the AmEx was charged twice and the part that hit me as humorous was: *I* do not have the power to hit his AmEx account in the first place. The entire point of Paypal is that the seller does not get access to the purchasers credit cards.

I posted the entire history of the situation (just like you did, as a response to the chargeback) and then decided to wait for the outcome. A couple days before the expected outcome deadline, everything disappeared except the original charge. There is now no record of the chargeback or any of the ensuing comments (except my screen captures cuz I'm like that, and of course all the comments between me and my client in my email history).

In small duplicated transactions here and there, could probably rise to the millions of dollars.

If the paypal chargeback thread is still open, and this situation is really the same as yours (the client initiated the payment), ask in the chargeback thread how *you* could have doublecharged the client without access to the client's CC in the first place.
