Just as the bottom was dropping out of the specific call center industry in which I was employed at the time. I was actually fairly new to the game by comparison to many of those around me.

I was hired by one of two partners that were in the middle of going separate ways, but weren't as open about it as they wanted to be.

The partner that hired me really wanted to keep his call center Straight and Long Term. Build it up, make happy clients. He found ways to get paid on virtually every leg of the deal. Not a lot on all legs, but no holes so he'd have great cash flow and never have to worry about a bottleneck one day choking his revenue stream.

His partner, on the other hand, just wanted to make as much cash as possible as soon as possible since having a lot of cash solves *all* problems, right? Plus, he had no problem at all with lying to make a sale.

So we had a fairly small call center set up and running stable. The partner decides that this is a great model and he wants to improve upon it to seriously increase the cash flow. Since it was working, my boss approved the expansion, expecting we'd hire some more operators and expand slowly using our already proven technique and scripts.

But no: The other partner just cuts a deal with another call center. Of course, there was a reason this other call center was available to cut said deal. Crooks. LOL

Within a couple days, we have three times the seats running. Sales are through the roof. Other partner is beside himself with glee since we're not spending much extra (no new overhead, just sales reps). But he did his best to keep me out of the room, and kept my boss in the executive area. Then I got behind one of the new sales reps and heard the pitch. Lies, crazy stuff. Faked verifications. Of course I reported this, making the other partner a sworn enemy. Now the two partners are battling. The client to whom they are selling is very happy, cuz *sales*.

Then it began. Chargebacks.

My boss took me aside during a free moment and asked my opinion. He knew I was fairly new to the business, but not that new. And I could still see interactions that management couldn't (because I could be in the room and still be ignored, since I was also a technician and blended in nicely).

I told him that the Client would be getting these chargebacks from our room, more so than other places. The ""coolness"" of the sales would then wear off. And that he would likely be called in for a meeting at the client location very soon. And from that meeting, he'd be told that the credit card machine (we had to hand key all charges back then) would be getting recalled. They would likely want to send someone over to get it, or drive him over personally to pick it up. Of course, they wouldn't say ""and bring it with you"", because then we would have control of the device *after* knowing we were losing it.

He wasn't sure what I meant ... so I clarified my ""two point strategy"" to maintain independence.

1) Get a new merchant account of your own Right Freakin' Now and hope it's Live before the client kills this deal.

2) When you get that call *and you will* be sure you notify *me* that you have a meeting, and where. If you don't text ""false alarm"" within 10 minutes of the meeting starting, I'll have the bookkeeper process refunds for *everyone* in the queue.

He said ""but we'll go negative ... they said never to do that"".

I said ""right, never do that ... or we'll cancel this contract."" Which, of course, is what they are going to do. The goal is to get out of it owing the general public as little as possible. After all, they are undoubtedly going to hold your payment, even if you're owed a huge amount, and then discuss you becoming an employee (again) instead of an independent contractor. And if they have all your money *and* you owe a bunch of refunds you can't pay, how could you possibly refuse?

So he applied for two merchant accounts, and two licenses, and opened two corporations. The first merchant account went live in just a few days (not a great deal, but functional, and the second one that went live a week later was much better).

And then I got that call. LOL. I told the bookkeeper to process every refund she could get her hands on. Even ones that hadn't been fully finished paperwork-wise. Just process all of them Right Freakin' Now. If you see the boss walk in the door with some suits, Batch Out!! and then walk away and smile at the boss.

She got a bit lazy, and stopped about $10k short of finish. And it seriously pissed off the client. But they have deep pockets and had made so much money from the sales in the first place that it was mostly the fact that they got played, and lost their hand against the boss that pissed them off. They really wanted him ""in-house"".

Then the partner who still hated me had no choice but to take the deal, though. Since he was the one who promised to pay 2/3 of the work force (all the new ones) and had Zero money. The boss, on the other hand, merely had to give back the company car and walk away. We were selling on the new merchant account the same day they came for the CC machine, and the flow had resumed.

And he never let anyone mess with the scripts, or take chances with chargebacks after that (no lies!).

Unfortunately, the bottom dropped out of the market a couple years later and he lost the whole thing.

It's cool when Suits are predictable, though.",talesfromcallcenters,Call Centers have a Wide Range of Honesty.,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/5drci8/call_centers_have_a_wide_range_of_honesty/

I was working in a Call Center and one of the other call centers in the complex shut down, and dumped ""everything"". In addition to the 8'x4' White Board (which we mounted on a wall in the living room and the kids went Nuts on it every day for several years), I also got three nice glass-walled cubicles that fit our dining room like a charm.

Separating our Dining Room from our Living Room wasn't really the goal, but we had a computer and each of our two daughters had their own computers, but we did not have anywhere in the apartment to make this work out. So this was meant to make this slightly underused space become study cubicles for them and for us, too.

While we were setting them up, which was pretty straightforward since they were snap-in-place simple, the only challenge was getting the desktop to snap in evenly (to avoid tilted desktops, which always seemed to happen the first time). We got to the third one and had the hang of it and she stuck her head under there to get ready to screw it in after the snap and I hit the top of the table just like all the others ... only this time it was not quite seated perfectly. And it popped off. And hit her straight between the eyes. She screamed for a sec ... and then stopped and just sat there silently holding her face/nose area.

I asked, she stayed silent. Eyes closed. Wouldn't move, wouldn't say anything. The kids were screamin' ... I was freaking out, she moved her fingers a little, otherwise I'd have thought she was ""out"". But she flat-out refused to acknowledge the world for what seemed like an hour. In other words, probably about 30 seconds. Maybe a couple minutes. I honestly couldn't tell time at that point. I was certain I'd broken her head.

When she finally said something, it was ""ouch"". Then she moved her hands and I fully expected gushing blood. Broken Nose. Brain matter? Something.

But nope. Nothing visible 'til the next day when she ended up with what looked like two black eyes. Apparently the slightly crooked nose (since childhood) was not going to get fixed today. And AFAIK she didn't lose any memories (which is what happened when she was in a car accident as a teenager, no seat belt).

I was kinda shell-shocked for several weeks. I was scared to death that I'd broken my GF. I mean, I put a lot of work into finding one and I had NO interest in starting all that over again. 

You know, like when you are the winning bidder of the perfect ""whatever"" on eBay, and they tell you after that it's been pre-sold and cancel the bid instead of letting you buy it? And now you have to start the search all over again? Only this time it'd be my own fault! Plus, what do you tell the kids: ""Oh, sorry, I broke Mom. Have some cake, though.""

I still have flashbacks to that moment.
