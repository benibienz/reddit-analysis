This link can explain it better than I can. I'm not sure how long it has been abandoned. The grade is 5.89% and most trains at the time it was built(1841) couldn't climb it or stop at the bottom. This was actually the second attempt at a rail line to the ohio river. The first one was scrapped and never completed, but some half finished rail tunnels are still there in Clifty Falls State Park just a few miles from this line.

We set up the cell to have a simple start/stop procedure that almost anyone can understand and all the have to do is stand at the end of a convery and package the finished part, or in some cases a robot does all the final packaging and quality checks with a vision system. 

The fact is the robot is lower cost than a human, doesn't take a break and doesn't ""forget"" or misplacing a part in the box. You can easily calculate your numbers because a fully automated line makes X parts an hour every hour.

So for a finishing pass you would leave a small amount of material and drop feed by 30-50%. One thing with aluminum is having a condition where you recut chips or throw them into the material and cause nicks, so that may affect surface finish more than the feedrate. Also a worn cutter will leave marks in the finish cut.

When going into corners, you are ramping your cutter engagement up sometimes by 75%, so again reducing feed rate in corners is preferable. Most of the time you run the lowest feed rate required and just deal with the added time to prevent any damage to the cutter. If you have cam software you can progam corner speed reductions in.

59,"I'm asuming 4 flute carbide endmill here.

The general rule for aluminum is that you are only limited by max spindle RPM or how secure your workpiece is.

At 2000rpm and 8.6ipm you are only at .0011"" feed per tooth. That is nowhere near a good speed/feed for aluminum or even stainless steel.

10,000 at 129 is a good conservative number. Still only .0032"" feed per tooth. I'd run 150ipm without hesitation as long as you have the part well secured.

As far as which is better? Well at the lower speed and feed you are going to take more cuts and take much longer to finish the machining operation. Also it will run hotter with smaller chipload, but coolant will keep it from causing any issues. You usually want to run the higher feed with higher chipload and take less cuts in less time. The endmill can handle it no problem and will wear better on top of that. So it's a win win from all aspects.


EDIT: I'm assuming less than 1/2 side cutter engagement on all of this. If you are slotting you will reduce your SFM and run slower feed to compensate for the larger chip load. If the cutter is running into hard corners or pocketing with legacy style tool paths then you have to compensate for that and slow down the feed when the amount of engagement increases.

Some of the machines we sell only have one fan on the spindle that you can check for correct phasing. I see machines phased backwards all the time during install. Even seen them just moved across the shop floor and phased wrong at the new drop.

Your photo has a white blown out sky and black shadows. The human eye can see a much wider dynamic range than the camera is capable of capturing.

82,"I wish it was that easy! It's hard to choose between lower shutter speed and less chance of getting the car in focus but more motion blur or higher shutter, easier to hit focus but less motion. 

I wish I could hit exact focus every time but when I'm moving and the car is moving its a real trial and error process, and sometimes the moment is gone and you don't get another chance. Around 1/30th small bumps, curbs and suspension movements really start to screw with sharpness as you could imagine. I tend to focus on the nose of the car or driver and try to track that.

111,"US Engineer for an automation integrator here.

While this may be true for some cases, most of what I see is huge expansion and increased job growth with automation. There is always a give and take with this, but most companies in the automotive industry that we deal with are expanding rapidly and spending millions on new building expansions and more automation projects. The business is booming right now and it is consumer demand dictating that. If these companies decided not to automate they would need more floor space with more machines and more employees manually loading, unloading and relieving people during lunch to equal to production achieved by robots. So overall cost for the company would go up dramatically and the average wages would drop since net profits would be down as well. 

Automation makes life for the factory workers easier, safer and less labor intensive and allows their wages to increase. Most of these companies are still hiring more workers as they expand, and if it wasn't for automation they wouldn't be competitive or as profitable. So while net workers might be lower the quality of life and average income can be higher for the line workers who are mandatory. I think it is a good trade and will inevitably be the global standard. 

FWIW a production quality robot can be as affordable as $30-40,000 for light duty material handling. So the company can write that off their taxes instead of paying a wage, insurance, income tax on your average line operator for a year and come out with enough money to probably buy 2 or 3 more robots and still be saving.

So many union workers get paid very well and get great benefits working unskilled assembly jobs for the big 3 while temp workers are getting paid $9/hour doing similar work in nonunion companies. In the recession we saw a lot of union workers lose their jobs and factories shut their doors because no one was willing to take a pay cut or lose their pension. Taxpayers paid to keep them working. They always seem to think they have a winning hand and don't want to compromise. That is the failure of unions. They ask for more and more until they are not viable when competitors come in at a lower price point. 

Just use Uber vs the Taxi Unions as an example of inflated prices, red tape and privileged workers being taken down by a better more adaptable competitor.

Now there is something interesting: A door with stairs leading off frame set in the lower left third. Nice lines and contrast. I cropped this 16x9 but would really like more sky and a standard format. You could also do this same crop with the door on the right and ditch the signage, but I figured you wanted in in frame.

By the time you see it you're fucked. Train moving at 30mph covers 100 yards every 7 seconds. You won't outrun it. Now you have to make a decision in the next 10 seconds to save your life. If you try to run and change your mind once you realize you can't make it you'll only have seconds to decided what your alternative options are. Best scenario is you already looked at your exit strategy (climb over the side) before you even see a train or climb on the tracks.

The only addition OP should look into is sealing off the bottom of the bumper to the splitter to keep air from passing between them.

186,"Engineer in the automation industry here, they already are fast and cheap. Most if not all production requires some kind of machine assisted component to create a product. If it's plastic it is made in an injection mold, if it is food it is sorted, baked, packaged and labeled. 

Right now there are still lots of workers who help assist in moving things down a production line between machines. It might be as simple as picking something up and setting it down and hitting a button. A robot can easily do this job and not make a mistake. It can even recognize a bad part and reject it while recording the error. The robot will notice if it has the wrong package and can even recognize if a package is too light or too heavy. While humans can in theory accomplish these things they are usually not 100% reliable and get fatigued, sick, distracted and injured. A robot can easily do the work of 3 people over 3 shifts a day and cost as little as 30-50,000 dollars depending on size and lift capacity. You'll get an easy 10 years or more of reliable service with around $15k for a rebuild after that. Then the robot can be applied to other project and integrated wherever it is needed in the future.

Right now our industry is growing quickly with more orders than we can handle almost. Lots of companies are realizing the benefit and the cost savings. With the fear of minimum wage hikes and union contract negotiations it's no wonder companies would rather replace workers with robots. Especially when the robots don't strike or ask for a raise.

I remember seeing the feet of our dog Lassie standing on the other side. We lived out in the country on a farm and it wasn't uncommon to see deer outside the house quite frequently. So In this particular dream world I see the feet of a deer walk up through the crack and start thinking about how neat it is that the dog made friends with a deer. Then out of nowhere the deer apparently attacks Lassie and all I can see is her feet and mountains of dog hair falling to the ground as the deer tears her to shreds. I woke up and was mortified enough to still remember it ~20 years later.,2015-11-13 18:18:14+00:00,cwz4fdy,1.0,t3_3soji4,4121.0,AskReddit

320,"&gt;What CAM package do you use?

* HSM Works for Solidworks

&gt;How often do you change CAM package, if ever?

* Never so far. It works better than anything I've used before.

&gt;process of getting CAD to finished cut.

* Since it is integrated into Solidworks I writ the toothpaths directly with the model. I even write them WHILE building a model. Then just post to USB and load on the machine.

&gt;Do you trust the toolpaths or run the machine with overridden feed during the first cut of a batch just to be sure it doesn't crash or break the tool etc? 

* Yes. It is so easy to render everything accurately that I hardly ever babysit the machine. We only run single parts anyway so that would be a waste of time.

&gt;How long does it take for the toolpaths of your more complex jobs to calculate? Especially relevant to us if you're using 4+ axis machines.

* Something really serious might take a minute. Most almost instantly.

&gt;Is there anything you wish existed CAMwise to make your day easier?

* WIPS programming but I know that is hard to implement across all different types of probing systems.

&gt;What sucks about CAM in your mind?

* Compared to what? I think using a separate CAM software than your CAD software sucks. I know I will never have problems with models when they share the same one. ",2015-09-23 16:52:03+00:00,cvbiou4,1.0,t3_3m21uu,17212.0,CNC

323,"I just see the term photoshopped as a suggestion that the image is somehow faked. Every detail in the image is what was captured by the photographer. He physically traveled to the end of the earth, hiked for miles and captured the picture at just the right moment when the clouds and lighting was perfect. He could have heavily adjusted the white balance in camera and got a very warm picture but instead started with an accurate white balance and did the adjustment in post. 

I'm not arguing this isn't exactly what the photographer saw, but it is obviously what he took away from the scene. He possibly woke up early in the morning and hiked to this location and as the sun was rising saw the mountain cast in a warm sunrise light but when he got to location the sun had risen and the lighting had changed. 

I'm just speculating, but the point is that photography would be pretty bland if people just took a picture and stopped there. There are so many other elements already at play. We as humans naturally block things out of view. We hide unimportant details in the shadows and ignore things out of frame in our own eyes. A photo freezes time and looks back at the past. When we recall a scene from memory, you are actually only recalling your last memory as the original is always overwritten. Sunsets are remembered to be more vibrant, mountains taller, water clearer. 

So showing an interpretation of a scene in warmer light is not ""photoshopped"" in my eyes. If there were mountains, people, artifacts added that were never there or could never be there in a way that misleads the viewer then I'd consider that photoshopped. Every professional photo you will ever see in today's age has passed through photoshop or lightroom so the term should only be used for obvious manipulation to photos IMO.

329,"This is what a blend line is for. It serves dual purposes:

1: To allow cars exiting the pit lane get back up to race speeds. 

2: To prevent cars exiting the pit lane from impeding other cars on track.

Once you leave the blend line you are racing at racing speed. The pit exit could be designed better but every driver is aware of the layout and know they will be meeting right at corner entry. You are always taught in road racing to ""obey the blend line"" and this goes both ways. Understand that when cars leave the blend line they are racing you and they sure as hell aren't going to yield when entering a live race track. Hulk saw him leaving the pits and made an error thinking he would clear Massa and wasn't even close. While you could argue it was a racing incident there is no way anyone should see it as Massa's fault. 

From a racing perspective as soon as the blend line ends you should see it the same as if they both got to their current positions on a flying lap. Hulk should have gave racing room. He could have easily cleared Massa even with a wide line.  ",2015-09-21 15:36:04+00:00,cv935l3,2.0,t1_cv915yu,3310.0,formula1

That's nearly 3/4 of an inch in diameter needed and the simple answer as to why a 70-200mm f/2.8 is bigger and more expensive than a 70-300mm f/4-5.6 on full frame sensors.

388,"Well to keep it simple I'll mainly address the question you are asking which is about the chemistry behind the basic nuclear(atomic) bomb.

The only element that can cause a nuclear chain reaction that is found naturally in nature is uranium 235, however, the most common form of uranium is 238 which makes up 99.3% of natural uranium. So in order to make a bomb the uranium is enriched. I'm sure most people have heard the terms uranium ""enrichment"" or possibly ""weapons grade"" uranium. This is referring to how much uranium 235 is present. Essentially the uranium 235 is separated from the uranium 238 because it is naturally fissile, which means it can sustain a nuclear reaction. A nuclear weapon can be made at 20% enrichment but weapons grade is usually 80-90% uranium 235.

Once the uranium 235 is enriched it is put together into what is called a critical mass. This is the amount needed to create a suitable chain reaction. Then a couple of methods are can be used to detonate the bomb with the simplest being to just implode it with other explosives focused inward all around two uranium hemispheres separated by a neutron absorbing material to prevent pre detonation.

Now to the actual reaction itself. Uranium is a pretty unstable element. It goes through radioactive decay and spits out protons and electrons, turning into smaller, lighter elements. What makes it fission is a simple addition of one neutron. When this one neutron is added the atom splits into two smaller elements (Krypton 92 and Barium 141) and what you have left over is a little bit of energy and 3 neutrons. The energy release is small by itself but when combined with other atoms it adds up to a massive amount. The extra neutrons fly out and hit other uranium 235 atoms causing them to split and release energy and more neutrons and so on. Nuclear fission.

The simple bombs first created during World War 2 had less than 20% of their critical mass actually undergo fission while the rest was just blown apart. These bombs are miniscule compared to what we are capable of today. The simple concept of a modern thermonuclear (hydrogen) bomb is to use a fission bomb to compress hydrogen atoms into each other until they undergo nuclear fusion and fuse together into heavier elements while also releasing even more energy. This is the basics of how a star works. Luckily no hydrogen bombs have ever been dropped on a populated area but the destruction capable would be far far greater than anything seen in the past. 


TL;DR: Hit an uranium atom with a neutron and it splits, releasing energy and more neutrons which in turn hit other uranium atoms causing a chain reaction. ",2015-09-08 16:01:19+00:00,cuuiqsq,1.0,t3_3k3klh,4925.0,explainlikeimfive

I'm not saying occupying indefinitely wouldn't have possibly made things better(Only at the cost of more american soldier's lives). I'm saying that the war was a bad move to begin with and ended with the region being worse off than when we started. Also countering your fantasy of it being a successful occupation. The war lasted 9 years, WW2 only took 6 years! Blame whoever you want but if you can't stabilize a region within a decade you need to move on. No one wants their kid to spend 20+ years as a soldier in Iraq. Remember when Obama took office we had already been in Iraq for 6 years and the ""Mission Accomplished"" banner had already been raised. 

I really hope for some kind of stability in Iraq but we didn't give it to them. Plenty of innocent people, including americans got wounded and killed during our occupation and you seem to think leaving more soldiers their to die from an IED is the best solution.
Peace and compromise through diplomacy would have went a lot further than a coop ever got us. The whole thing was a mess from beginning to end.

411,"Every other country with rational gun control isn't starting with millions of guns on the streets. Chicago has outlawed handguns yet has the highest gun crime in the country and no innocent citizen can defend themselves against that. Yes in a perfect world if you could just make the guns disappear it would be a great solution but it simply can't happen. Just like prohibition, it will only create a demand on bootlegged guns, illegal imports and backyard manufacturing. More things the government will have to invest time, money and resources into preventing all while losing all tax revenue on legal gun purchasing.

My point is that it isn't as simple as everyone would like it to be, however, there are plenty of valid options. We could create a high % gun tax on all weapon and ammo purchases raising the prices. Guns kill people so taxing them and using that money to fund government programs that help prevent gun violence is a viable option. Combine that with other rules and regulations and we may actually get congress to pass some useful legislation. Our legislators will never agree on strict gun control so trying to jump over every other moderate solution will result in nothing being accomplished, which is basically what has been happening for decades. 

Yes a large % of Americans don't want to give up their guns and those people are represented in congress where the laws are made and have a huge lobby backing their interest. I enjoy my freedom to own a gun and if I knew every other gun was going to disappear I wouldn't be opposed to giving mine up as well but that simply isn't in the cards. Any situation of gun control will end up with the innocent people giving theirs up first and the criminals last. I'm just not in support of that scenario.

Are you shooting in raw? With raw you could sacrifice proper exposure by using a faster shutter speed and recover some of the shadows and detail in post. If the picture is blurry then getting the exposure right didn't matter in the first place.

I don't know much about the A6000 but I'm guessing kit lens? so 16-50 f3.5-5.6

That lens isn't amazing for low light so I can see why you had some problems. If you would have zoomed out and allowed the aperture to open up closer to 3.5 then crop the image down later in post you would have probably ended up with better results as well. 

Next options would have been a flash so you could increase the shutter speed or worst case tripod to help steady the camera but obviously that isn't very practical for this instance. ",2015-08-25 18:17:41+00:00,cufbtzk,1.0,t3_3icwvk,2453.0,photocritique

If you crank up your shutter speed too much you will freeze the background and wheels which is usually undesirable.

Just keep shooting and experiment with different shutter speeds at different angles and you will get a feel for what shutter speeds work at a certain perspective and car speed. It all comes down to personal preference as to what you want out of your photo, but you have to compromise in some situations as you can't always have a sharp car as well as blurred sense of speed from a particular perspective. Possibly moving further back and zooming more if possible will help sharpen the car more and blur the background. ",2015-08-03 16:39:19+00:00,ctq1d4i,1.0,t3_3fmcrf,9176.0,photocritique

In an overcast situation you would definitely need a much higher ISO or lower aperture. For all intents and purposes overcast can reduce your light by 1-1.5 stops so that would mean opening up the aperture to f/16 or f/11 with the same shutter speed and ISO to compensate for the reduction in light.

I often use a polarizer, and while it reduces light, it is handy when trying to drag the shutter on a bright sunny day. Polarizers take a lot of the sun glare off the cars and also reduce your light by around 2 stops. So it would require a aperture of f/8 at 1/15th which is more desirable in my opinion for max sharpness and a better depth of field.

I usually limit my albums to 30-60 photos for an event no matter now many photos I take over the weekend.

When the image is flipped and it is on the right third your eyes draw across the left leading lines along the edge of the field first and then to the tower last.

[Here](http://www.camden-thrasher.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/140313_IMSA-8536-b.jpg) is another with similar lighting but I suspect a flash was involved, because the car is very sharp but there are trails from the lights on the car showing that the shutter was open but the whole car didn't blur.

[Obviously a good choice for wildlife as well!](https://www.flickr.com/photos/legrandphotography/18254048279/in/dateposted-public/lightbox/)


I'm happy with the purchase. I think it is more versatile and therefore more valuable to me than a 70-200 2.8 since I don't do much portrait work. Also comparing price I could put that money towards a full frame camera and be better off. 


EDIT: I would get this lens over anything without image stabilization. You want IS even if you think you don't. When light starts getting low it helps out tremendously.

You cant choose the weather you can only just be their when the conditions are best. Sometimes the only way to improve a shot is go back when the clouds/weather/ sunset is more interesting.

As far as your camera settings. Most photography like this is done with a polarizer, ND filter and possibly a graduated ND for the sky. Get use to setting the camera in manual for these compositions. Also like others have said shooting closer to F8-10 would be ideal, with ISO at 100 and the sutter more around 2-4 seconds with this kind of light and a .6 ND+circular polarizer.

I would make sure you always bring that nifty fifty with you. I always seem to go back to it every time I'm photographing cars at shows or in the pits at race tracks.

As far as what F stop/shutter speed and polerizer. I just got around to buying a polarizer so I can't comment until I experiment with it myself, but that is exactly what you should do too! When shooting parked cars I usually leave the camera in aperture priority and let the camera sort shutter speed. Also When first starting out I'd recommend taking 3-4 shots with each one at a different aperture. 1.8-2.2-2.8 or something like that and see which ones you like better. Some people like to shoot everything at 1.8 but I vary depending on the backdrop and angle I'm viewing the car and if there are [other elements](https://www.flickr.com/photos/legrandphotography/18417249543/in/dateposted-public/lightbox/) in the background/foreground I want to capture.

The vantage point is one of my favorites for shooting cars and the hay flying adds the element of speed to it!

If you don't mind a suggestion, maybe try experementing with slower shutter speeds on some of your other photos, especially open wheel cars because they just looked parked when shot above 1/1000 [like this one](https://www.flickr.com/photos/125551887@N03/18576060644/in/album-72157655112175092/). Maybe try something in the 1/500-700 range. It will also allow you to shoot with a lower ISO so less noise! Should be just enough to blur the tires though.

Check out my album I posted in this thread from a vintage race and you can see I do a lot with panning and lower shutter speeds.

601,"I'm someone who is on the road quite a bit and often lets their food consumption/quality get out of control. My best advice is try and count calories as much as you can, at least for a few months. There are plenty of smartphone apps that will help you (myfitnesspal is what I used) and most of them even let you scan a barcode with your camera or have fast food items already in their database. You obviously can't track everything when eating at a wedding while working or grabbing something from a food vendor but your goal should be *correlation*. I don't count calories anymore but I have a good sense now of how many calories I take in after a few months of tracking as much as I could.

This will help you more than you can imagine! You get the ability to see food as calories. That giant plate of pancakes now looks like 1,000 calories. That is pretty off putting when you know you aren't going to burn it off with exercise that day. Every mile you walk a day is more you can eat, so use that as encouragement to be more active. If you walked 5 miles that day, then a piece of cake for dessert won't result in any net gain. If you lay around the house all day, probably shouldn't eat it!

Don't be discouraged, it's all calories in vs calories out. You have to teach yourself to start thinking in calories so you can really understand were the weight comes from and where it goes. It isn't complicated and if you can give up things like excessive sugar, condiments, toppings, dressings, etc you can easily lose weight with a semi active lifestyle and still eat what you want, just less of it.

624,"Yeah from a photographer stand point you can't not take this picture. If it was me and I wanted it to be deliberate I would have stopped down more and made sure the gun was more in focus which would have made it look more intentional. I'd almost bet they chose this one to make it purposely seem less deliberate. If it was me shooting I'd have several photos at different F stops. Photographers dont always have an agenda. I take photos that tell a story no matter what the story is. There was an opportunity here and it was taken and obviously speaks to people in different ways. I'd take it as more symbolism since the gun isn't real. Think political suicide, not literally a gun to his head.",2015-06-23 15:01:21+00:00,csfxwdj,2.0,t1_csfk225,39912.0,pics

Still I'm a supporter of SOME KIND of gun legislation that helps educate new gun owners on gun safety. At the end of the day this guy didn't even buy the gun, his father gave it to him.

638,"Picture of the whole car? I just had to google it to even find out what it looked like and where that vent was. So even as an automotive enthusiast the perspective was hard to visualize for me. Also, it would've helped if it was cleaner. The grass under the trim and blemish around the body line is distracting.

Looking at other pictures of the car it's extremely interesting and this photo adds to the rest of the pictures I saw. I would put it in a collage photo or an album with other pictures of the same car. Detail photos of car need to stand on their own IMO or be accompanied by something else that gives them perspective.

Just think to yourself about a viewer who knows nothing about cars, or this particular one. Remember your photos always have to convey a complete, or at least, teasing message to the viewer that gives them some kind of answer.

[Here is one of my ""minimalist"" automotive photos that I personally think can stand alone.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/legrandphotography/18870185882/in/dateposted-public/lightbox/) Just enough information in the photo to let the viewer understand what they are looking at and from what perspective.

All done in lightroom. A small rotation and crop, then lens correction. Desaturated the reds because I felt the lights were distracting.

My best advice is ask those guys a ton of questions. Let them know that you are interested in learning and want to know how they do things. Most people don't mind explaining. 

First thing you are probably going to need to learn is G-code. That is basically the language the machine understands. Here is maybe a good place to start: http://www.cnccookbook.com/CCCNCGCodeCourse.htm
