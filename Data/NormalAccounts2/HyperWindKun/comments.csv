4,"&gt; Green apple juice? is that any different than normal apple juice? 

Probably not, but at least to me, the juice feels a bit softer and less sweet.

And yeah, it's pretty much an appletini, but the ratios are a bit different. :D

7,"&gt; I would also name the function something more descriptive, like count_neighbors. Having forgotten the rules of the game of life, it took me a while to figure out what the function was doing.

Never was good at naming, sorry.

&gt; Is there any reason why cells is a HashSet? It seems to me that something more matrix-like would be a better representation -- if nothing else, it would give you O(1) neighbor-checking instead of O(n).

Funnily enough I chose a HashSet for performance reasons, as it's a lot quicker to search for a value in a HashSet than, lets say, a Vector (plus, no need to check for repeating cells) and you don't need to store and iterate through a lot of values like in a matrix, just having the living cells is enough. Also, the neighbor-checking algorithm could probably be rewritten to have a constant time, as searching for a value in a HashSet is an O(1) operation and all you need to do to is to check if the adjacent cells exist in the HashSet, but I'll work on that later. :p

&gt; I've just now noticed that there is also flicker once there's a decent number of cells in the game. It also takes up a full core of my processor, even if there are no living cells. A sleep each cycle should fix this second issue; I think using a matrix (or 2d array, or Vec that you treat as a 2d array or whatever) of bools for the cells instead of a HashSet would fix a lot of your performance issues. Printing, then, would just be a matter of iterating over the matrix, and painting either ""@"" or ""."" depending on whether it's true or false.

Hmm, strange, I thought I solved the flickering issue by only having the screen redrawn after an update, gonna need to look into that one. As for the performance, as I've said before, I think it would be more efficient to print only the living cells.

Anyways, thanks for the feedback, much appreciated. :)",2016-07-30 01:13:06+00:00,d5wnxr0,2,t1_d5wiloq,9026,rust

That blue thing is likely to be the [kami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kami) of the tree, because the tree had [shimenawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimenawa) on it. ([more on the subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorishiro))

The destruction of the shinto shrine plus the amount urban shots, as I interpret them, symbolises widening separation between humanity and nature.

The girl, after finding the kami, tried to expose it to humanity, thus trying to tie the bond between humans and nature again, but the kami grew weaker as its vessel was eaten away more and more by the thing it was exposed to and eventually couldn't hold onto this world.

It's a little bit harder to discern the concrete meaning of the ending, but I think it tried to say that even if it might seem too late, there's always hope and if we try harder we'll eventually live in harmony. Also, I think the weather might also hint at this as the storm and rain of the low points of the story eventually fade into a bright day.

I also found [this](http://kyousannkenn.tumblr.com/post/132602485191/%E3%82%AB%E3%83%8A%E3%83%A1%E3%83%B2%E3%81%AB%E3%81%A4%E3%81%84%E3%81%A6), I'm pretty sure it explains everything a bit more, but it's in Japanese, so I can't really read it.

92,"*Mononoke* (5/12)

Amazing show. The art style is fresh and intriguing, the sound is eerie and the atmosphere is something I haven't seen in anime yet, also, it's probably the only anime (well, maybe apart from Higurashi, but I'd like to classify that more as a thriller) that did horror **right**. Like the last scene had me on edge for most of the time and my mind at full throttle, trying to solve and understand what's happening on the screen.

The only thing I didn't like was the formatting. They could've made the episodes longer, instead of cutting the story right on the cliffhanger, but that's a minor issue.

So far, at least in my opinion, *Mononoke* is a must for anyone who enjoys horror and mystery.

*Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic* (4/25)

Didn't really impress me that much yet. I can see the potential of the story and complexity of the setting, but it just felt like it ditched explaining and exploring it, plus giving the characters some god damn background and proper characterisation, just to get to the actiony bits. Like, literally, they cleared the dungeon, which I'd presume would be a major plotpoint and played around with killing some of some characters, to which I should've been attached or, at least, know about, in episode 3, like, Jesus, I barely know these people or what's going on and you're expecting me to keep up with that? But, thank god, things are finally slowing down in ep. 4 and an interesting plotpoint has been presented, so the show is starting to look good again.",2015-11-01 23:55:15+00:00,cwkzc30,1,t3_3r4ovg,7871,anime

&gt; Anime brought us till here. Anime for life!

Anime brings people together, this world needs more of it.

&gt; I am from India. Here the awareness levels of anime are nearly nil. So there are barely any stores to buy manga and LNs from.

Pretty much the same here. I usually get all of my merch from one single store, as there are pretty much none other. Also, on the topic of India, I remember one guy from the Indian team at IJSO giving me some really tasty round waffle-ish looking things, I have no idea how are they called, but I remember them being tasty.

&gt; For LNs have you read the series Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria?

No, but might read it as it looks like Sakura-sou + Aku no Hana type of deal and I haven't read a good light novel in some time (the last one being *Boogiepop and Others*, which I can't recommend enough).

Ok, I think I'll ask something too, as this is turning into pretty much an interrogation type of thing *(lol)*, so, what are your favourite video games?",2015-08-30 19:25:05+00:00,cul0xo7,19,t1_cul09xb,1208,CasualConversation

I never watched Log Horizon myself, but my friend loves the shit outta it, so I just thought I'd drop it as a recommendation, as both of your tastes seemed similar.

If you liked SAO you should really watch Log Horizon (season 1, season 2 was crap) or the still ongoing Overlord, as I think they did the MMO thing better.

I don't.
No, but seriously now, I just watch a few episodes to let down some steam after the day or during the weekend, if I've got nothing else to do, and somehow that stacks up to a few anime.

I also have a long break from time to time just to clear up my head and respark my interest.

198,"&gt; On a side note I am a male to female transgender person so if there are any good anime shows that have a character like me I'd like to see that!

[**Hourou Musuko**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8426/Hourou_Musuko), but I wouldn't really recommend it as a first.

For a first show (or rather, movie), one of these would work best, in my opinion:

[**Redline**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6675/Redline) (*Sci-Fi, Action, Movie*), 

[**The Girl Who Leapt Through Time**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2236/Toki_wo_Kakeru_Shoujo) (*Adventure, Drama, Romance, Movie*), 

[**Wolf Children**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12355/Ookami_Kodomo_no_Ame_to_Yuki) (*Fantasy, Slice of life, Movie*)

[**The Secret World of Arrietty**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7711/Karigurashi_no_Arrietty) (*Fantasy, Adventure, Movie*)

And for a second watch:

[**Baccano!**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2251/Baccano!) (*Fantasy, Action, Comedy, Mystery, Series*),

[**Trigun**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6/Trigun) (*Action, Comedy, Sci-Fi, Series*),

[**Kuragehime**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8129/Kuragehime) (*Slice of Life, Comedy, Series*),

[**Kino no Tabi**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/486/Kino_no_Tabi:_The_Beautiful_World) (*Slice of Life, Adventure, Series*),

[**AnoHana**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9989/Ano_Hi_Mita_Hana_no_Namae_wo_Bokutachi_wa_Mada_Shiranai.) (*Drama, Slice of Life, Supernatural, Series*),

[**Mushi-Shi**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/457/Mushishi) (*Adventure, Slice of Life, Supernatural, Mystery, Series*)

Hope this helps and happy watching!

237,"[""Edgy""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZjX65NYVGM)

Anyways, in my opinion, **some** of those shows get labeled as ""edgy"" because they try to compensate for the lack of proper characterization and storytelling in shear amounts of gore and violence, they try to seem more complex and dark than they are.

For example, in [Mirai Nikki](/s ""the main couple invites a 5 year-old to stay at their house who tries to kill them in various ways, going as far as using nerve paralyzing gas that he somehow (emphasis on the 'somehow') acquired."") Here the writers obviously try to make the show seem darker and more serious without giving the characters proper context and filling the obvious plot holes, thus making the show seem ""edgy"" and over-exaggerated. This is not even the first example of a scene like this happening in this show, it's riddled with tons upon tons of examples of ""edgyness"". 

But back to the point, not all of the shows you presented are ""edgy"", but they get mistaked for being ""edgy"" as the term is getting more and more diluted with every season and is turning into a common buzzword like ""pretentious"", in my opinion, from the shows you presented and I've watched only Mirai Nikki and maybe Attack on Titan could be called ""edgy"" to a certain extent.",2015-07-26 10:27:34+00:00,ctgk7wy,1,t3_3en173,12145,anime

&gt; you've watched a lot of the dark/serious shows that i've been meaning to see too so i'm kind of inspired to start on my ptw LOL

They're the bread to my butter.

&gt; to contrast that i'll rec usagi drop for a more light hearted watch. it's my personal favorite slice of life and everything about it (visuals, music, character interactions) contributes so well towards its themes of family and love. i loved it a lot and had to keep myself from squealing at like every ep tbh. it's definitely worth the watch and a great way to unwind and get a lil emotional too

Been meaning to watch it some time this summer, I think I might give it a try after I finish Zetsuen no Tempest (which I'm gonna watch next).

&gt; edit: i forgot to say something mean but klk a 5?? do you not know how to take a show lightly or what man

Didn't like the middle and the second part that much and I found Mako completely obnoxious, like, if Mako weren't in this anime it probably would've been 2 grades higher, also, to me, this show suffers from the ""Mirai Nikki"" syndrome - the more I think about it, the less I seem to like it.",2015-07-23 08:56:39+00:00,ctd626m,3,t1_ctd5dr7,2622,anime

266,"**Shinsekai Yori** - To me it's probably third to Huxley's ""Brave New World"" and Orwell's ""1984"" in world building and exploration of a dystopian setting, I also really loved the villain and the twist ridden ending.

**The Tatami Galaxy** - A love story done right, of course, I'm not saying that other shows did romance wrong, I just feel like Tatami one-upped many shows by sticking to its psychological nature and splicing the romance in where it could, thus creating a really interesting dynamic and making the already great characters feel even more organic.

**Ef: A Tale of Memories** - I liked this anime not so much for its romance, but more for its view on life. What are your memories really, how much of them are the truth and how much of those are just lies, fabricated by your subconsciousness to fill in the gaps? Does every week make sense in your memories, every month, year, 5 years, 10 years, how much of that is just fake and how much was lost in the void of your mind? What will you accomplish will your life, do you have a dream and will you ever reach it?
And many other existential questions were asked by the show and with the help of the show at least some of them were answered for me. 

**Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** - Amazing world, amazing lore, great story delivery, nice characters and many themes exploring existentialism. Just what I need in my shonen action series.

**Haibane Renmei** - Mystique dominates the atmosphere of this show, everything seems really familiar, but also somehow alien. The amount of questions this show raises is absolutely colossus and most of them are unanswered by the end and left for the audience's interpretation, enhancing the mystique even more. Also,  the story told by one of our main protagonists (you know who I'm talking about) was extremely relatable and touching.

**Texhnolyze** - Sci-fi nihilism at its finest. The atmosphere the show created was amazing and the way it presented its themes and story was even better, I also really liked the hints taken from Edward Hopper's art and the ending left me speechless.

**Neon Genesis Evangelion** - Where do I even start? I guess my favorite aspects of this show were the underlying character study and the way Anno just put all of his personality and heart into the show. Watching it was like being a psychotherapist and listening how a really internally conflicting persona let out all of their problems and paints onto you. I'm not even gonna mention the lore and the intricacies of this universe as I might be sitting writing all day.

**Ergo Proxy** - Ergo proxy was like a mix of the sci-fi aspect of Texhnolyze and the atmosphere of Haibane Renmei. Many of its stories can be interpreted in many different ways and it presents something different to each and every one of us. Also, I'd be doing a injustice not mentioning its expansive lore and the characters.

**Mushishi** - Mushishi throws me back to the time when I was still a little kid, listening to my parents telling me old folk stories at night and later having dreams about the many demons, withes and many mystical creatures. Mushishi really felt like those dreams, so warm, so relaxing and so, so mysterious. 

**Spice &amp; Wolf** - Medieval economics plus wolf girls and pagan folklore, is there something not to like in spice and wolf? Ok, seriously now, the economics of Spice and Wolf were really great, the constant planning and one-upping made me melt in my chair and Holo to this day remains one of the best and well written female characters in my eyes.

**Kokoro Connect** - This show probably had the most real, relatable and human characters in any show I've watched so far, I remember when I was like Inaba - not trusting people, afraid of getting hurt and putting up a cold façade to push people away, I remember when I was like Iori - confused and vulnerable, not knowing who I was and searching for my true self all over the place, leading to depression and many other ""fun"" experiences,
I remember myself when I was like Taichi - selfless and yet so selfish, trying to help others just to fill some void in my heart, butting in into really personal affairs, hurting myself and others just to feel adequate and to justify my existence in this world,
like Yui - afraid of the world around me, like Aoki - infinitely lovesick, but still clinging to my past and not considering others' feelings and like all of them, I remember growing up and growing out of these problems and facing the world as a new, stronger person in the end.

**Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso** - Besides the wonderful classical music, I really liked the dynamic between the characters and the trauma driven story of our main protagonist and how he grew out of it and started to face the world on his own, also this was one of the most emotionally wrenching anime I've watched to this day (especially the ending).

Sorry for the wall of text, I just have too many favorites (didn't even include the Kara no Kyoukai movies here, but if I did I might've reached the character limit) and I like discussing them (and all anime, movies, music, etc.) way too much. :) ",2015-07-22 09:37:08+00:00,ctbxpj4,1,t3_3e4wbr,35045,anime

339,"\**[CUE THE MUSIC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOX15agZ3-0)*\*

Shinsekai Yori, in my opinion, is a really special occurrence, as it's probably the only anime that did Huxlean or classical dystopias and the society they produce right. 

Taking cues from such books as ""Brave New World"" by Aldous Huxley and ""1984"" by George Orwell, it presents a human crafted in such a way that seems dehumanized, foreign and illogical to us, they don't have a real feeling of consequence, morality and the concept of freedom, as the society they were raised in demands that a human is only a tool destined to do one job and eventually fade away, and like any tool, all of these humans have to fit a special mold set by the elders, that's why the weaker and the stronger usually get eliminated before they can cause trouble and why the social rules seem so lax here, this is the only way to keep the tool a tool and the only way to keep it happy and oblivious to everything happening around them. Everything is allowed as long as it doesn't pose threat to the system. 

Of course, I have to admit that the characters aren't perfect in this series (nothing ever is), the way that A1 executed the characters could've been a little more tasteful, as they really did come off a bit to brat-ish in the beginning, but, if I recall correctly, they were better in the book.

Now to the monk. With this example, in my opinion, they wanted to show how actually frail is the system. Even if an individual has a smallest speck of imperfect brainwashing and starts questioning the rules, the ""safety"" system falls apart.

I won't go deeper into SSY, as I would probably spoil everything if I did, but I'd really recommend you to continue watching it 'till the end, it gets really good at the last arc especially, and keep in mind what I wrote, think about the system, its possible shortcomings and try to predict its and the characters' eventual end.

You are correct, Gurren Lagann, unlike Kill la Kill, didn't try parody and critique anything, it already knew that it was a *""dumb""*, actiony show and it embraced it, while Kill la Kill tried to comment on all of the tropes and stereotypes in anime and miserably failed by mis and over using them, thus failing to achieve its original vision.

367,"NHK displays self-awareness (as self-awareness is the cornerstone of comedy) and laughs form itself in this rather bitter and tragical, but inherently very comedical and ironical way. 

It also emulates the ancient theatrical Greek comedy. As described here, the Greek comedy is ""*a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a ""Society of Youth"" and a ""Society of the Old"". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.*"", in this case, the youth are our rather socially different characters and the opposition is the world and trying to mold them into the form of a ""normal"" person and the comedy (aka. the struggle) is mainly derived from their failings to fit this mold and the extremes they display throughout the series, plus the eventual victory of the old way of thinking over the new, different generation.

This is why I think NHK is a comedy, a tragical and ironical one, but still a comedy, of course, I might be wrong or I might be overthinking it, but this is my reasoning.",2015-07-14 11:15:55+00:00,ct2sic1,3,t1_ct2rbs5,4684,anime

*3* - The trailer seemed ok, even if it didn't really show anything, so you could say I'm a little bit excited.

*4* - As did ""Friend A"", I watched Zero first and I greatly prefer it to UBW for mostly the same reasons. It felt like UBW lost the gritty, serious and tense atmosphere of Zero and shifted to more of a shoneny, straightforward show, also I just couldn't get behind the characters, unlike the characters from Zero, most of the ones in UBW seemed shallow and really architypey, I mean we had [the tsundere](http://40.media.tumblr.com/37f9a4ecc1bed248ba52593b16dfce5e/tumblr_ngxwizFsPe1qz70k9o4_1280.jpg), [the dumb but heroic MC-kun](http://anime.astronerdboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/x08-Harry-Potter-Shirou.jpg), [the kouhai](http://blog.viewster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/fatestay-suz-1024x576.png), [the dickhead](http://anime.astronerdboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/x07-Shinji.jpg), [the (seemingly) badass](http://i201.photobucket.com/albums/aa288/reversethieves/show%20images/Type%20Moon/Unlimited%20Blade%20Works/UBW01M.jpg~original), etc. while everyone in Zero were multidimensional and complex, like even caster and his master, being the least complex and developed characters in Zero, seemed more intricate than most of the characters in UBW, also [they ruined Saber](http://i.imgur.com/mJ101q3.gif) (I was really close to dropping the show after that episode, like **really** close). 

But I have to say, in defense of UBW, these problems are also present in the VN and I think the show did it's best to iron out them and at least try to keep a similar atmosphere to the one in Zero.

To end this off, I don't think that UBW is a bad show, because it really isn't, the animation is stellar, the sound is great, the story and the characters, while not perfect, were also pretty good, to me it just didn't live up to what Zero presented and hyped it up to be.

* [Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei (aka. The Tatami Galaxy)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7785/Yojouhan_Shinwa_Taikei) - The closest definition for this anime would probably be a coming of age story for adults, it's probably the closest one to NHK from my recommendations, also, before watching prepare yourself for a load of reading as this one really likes it's dialogue.

* [Texhnolyze](http://myanimelist.net/anime/26/Texhnolyze) - Sci-fi nihilism at its finest. I consider this one the best of the ""Yashitoshi Abe's trilogy"", it's soaked in character, atmosphere, mystery and is a must watch for any sci-fi fan in my opinion, the only minor flaw would be its rather slow pacing, but it doesn't hinder the experience any bit.

* [Ergo Proxy](http://myanimelist.net/anime/790/Ergo_Proxy) - This is more of a journey than an anime - tightly packed with philosophy and atmosphere, every episode hooks you in more and more into this mystery of a world and keeps you up at night thinking about it.

* [Jin-Roh](http://myanimelist.net/anime/570/Jin-Rou) - This is a strange one. It feels really real, yet somewhat distant from our world. As the other anime I've recommended, this one is also quite the atmospheric piece and the atmosphere, plus hints thrown at you by the story, is what drives it forwards. Also, I have to mention that this one contains high amounts of gun and tech **'porn'**.

* [Redline](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6675/Redline) - Prepare to eyegasm as this has some of the (if not) the best animation out there. The plot of this one isn't as intricate and complex as the others', but it's still quite enjoyable and good, for a short summary, imagine a star-wars move completely dedicated to pod-racing, the politics and the people surrounding it.

* [Shinsekai Yori (aka. From the Brave New World)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori) - An exploration of an utopic society in the vein of to the one presented in Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World"" (hint. the name), just not as technologically advanced and I'd say, not as brainwashed in some aspects, also, this anime is more character focused and with more expansive lore than Huxley's book.

Find the most user friendly distro available (I had to use Gentoo as a first distro, didn't enjoy it).
My suggestions would be:

* Linux Mint
* Bodhi
* Lubuntu


Don't force the terminal onto him, the terminal can often be a really scary place for a newbie, instead show him how he could use it to make some things he does on the computer faster.


Often times people, especially kids, dispise Linux for its lack of windows software they were used to. In this case, install some alternatives or use wine to emulate it.


Make him find answers himself.

461,"(potential spoilers for Mirrai Nikki, Higurashi and Evangelion)

&gt; But I don't think it was even THAT edgy or dark.

 * A five-year-old tried tries to kill our main duo with what I would presume to be nerve gas.
 * A terrorist blows up a school full of unknowing civilians and has a good ol' laugh about it.
 * A semi-blind girl tells a tragic story of how she's raped by hundreds and hundreds of men every day.
 * etc.

Not trying to be edgy at all™


Also, ""darkness"" isn't usually made by not all of the nasty events happening around or the headcount of character x.
""Darkness"" is usually achieved by presenting an enthralling and immersing world, complex characters and presenting a thing I'd like to call ""the other"".
The other can be all sorts of things.
For example, in Higurashi ""the other"" is the contrast between the cutsie characters and their true colours and the ever present gloom and insanity hanging over the town, plus it enhances that effect through the use of the uncanny valley.
Another example would be Eva. In Eva I'd say ""the other"" would be the complex traumas and the psychological state of the main characters.
That's why those shows are darker the Mirai Nikki. Mirai Nikki lacks that ""the other"" aspect and tried to compensate by shear kill count and extremeness. That's why it isn't dark and that's why it comes of as edgy and cheesy as hell.


&gt; I agree that some of the characters were cliche like the tsundere terrorist, but even for her, i thought it was kind of sweet, especially since some tsunderes are like the one taiga who is the type that makes the tsundere thing so stupid, but idk.


Now, why does Taiga make the tsundere thing so stupid and so sweet in the end?
Why is she liked so much and the terrorist chick comes off as bland?
I'd say it's character depth. Taiga is not defined by that single trait, she shows emotion and reaction to everything around her, she has some moments of weakness, absolute bitterness and some moments of beautiful joy and affection, she shows humanity in her character, while the terrorist chick only gets the tag ""tsundere"" and that's that. Actually, in my opinion, she isn't even the worst offender, if I recall correctly, she has some development towards the end, the worst offenders here probably are Yuki and Yuno. Throughout the series they are only defined by one, single character trait and don't progress out of that. Yuki will always be that whiny wimpy kid, who's too afraid to do anything without his girlfriend And Yuno will always be the chick who's absolutely and utterly in love with him, in fact she's so in love, that she'd slaughter anyone and everyone in her way to get to her hubby.
That's why these characters are so shallow and bland, that's why everything comes of as so fake and campy in the series, that's why this show is so bad, even if it had such an interesting setting and a good start.

482,"I've been watching anime for about 1-2 years with semi-frequent breaks and this is what I think so far:


Anime, to me, is a really expressive and broad medium that, when used correctly, can produce really great emotionally moving and philosophically deep pieces of **art** (probably even more so than movies). Of course, this often goes unrealised as anime is greatly a commercial medium and directors mostly treat animation as childish, even if it can portray much more than film ever could. But, I'd like to stay positive and hope that, as time passes, more and more people realise the power animation gives to the author.
