------


Some background:

School days is an anime I watched pretty early in my anime watching career, as it was recommended to me by one of my anime watching friends when I was just discovering the romance genre.

I went into it pretty much blind, having only known that it's kinda heavy on the drama aspect.

-------

My thoughts on it:

&lt;rant&gt;

It's probably one of the worst shows I've laid my eyes on.

None of the characters had any common sense and seemed so shallow and two dimensional, that a paper cut-out would be jealous and our MC-kun was probably the densest, most senseless dickhead to grace the planet earth.

The plot was no better, it was filled with overly melodramatic and forced plot elements that happened because of the characters' own incompetence and could've been avoided if someone had grown a brain and our dense dickhead MC-kun just let Kotonoha know that he doesn't want to go out with her anymore.

The only semi-redeeming element was the ending, but even that came of as really edgy.

&lt;/rant&gt;

Now, with that off my chest, I ask you dear reader, if School Days is an anime that you enjoyed, please explain in detail what did you find in it, that I didn't.
