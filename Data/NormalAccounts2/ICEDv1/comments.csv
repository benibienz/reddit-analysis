0,That's because our copy of geralt is an animated version of it. I guess in the full game all cards will have animated versions (or at least most of them) like the golden cards in Hearthstone.,2016-10-30 15:52:52+00:00,d9e13uy,2,t1_d9dqe9q,30402,gwent

3,"This needs more priority in my opinion. There is no real way of fixing this, because it seems to be somehow connected with Win10 and its updates. I'm having the same problem since 2 months, couldn't even join in the closed beta because of that.
Is there any known fix by now? Wasn't able to find one in the forums. But @OP for me this is and has always been a thing, never was able to login into the Bethesda Launcher, sadly. (Tried updating, redownloading, rebooting and so on)",2016-09-15 15:52:24+00:00,d7nxmct,1,t3_52w4nw,8678,elderscrollslegends

6,Yeah I mean the Challenger/Master/Diamond icons that are in the game. Not sure if you are allowed to use them.,2016-02-05 12:39:44+00:00,czoqqmi,3,t1_cznwkk7,61122,zengmlol
7,"I wasn't logged in when I wrote my comment so I'm not sure if you've got it. I'll just write another one.

There are 3 things I want to mention:

1. It's not working properly for me, neither on a custom or normal roster. I've tried clearing my cache and save games already. I have to edit each single player for it to update.

2. I feel like this needs a little bit of adjustments for custom rosters. Because every player above 60ish is Challenger. But I feel like there should be way more Dia 1-3/Master players in Ladder/CS. (Even players like aphromoo who plays in LCS for a couple years plays was Master last season)

3. Could you add the elo icons somewhere at the player profile? In my opinion it would look better, and every picture that you add would probably make the game look better, so that would be a good place to start :&gt;

These are just my suggestions. But other than that, I'm looking really forward to this update as soon as it works for me :)",2016-02-04 18:53:16+00:00,cznuh9l,1,t3_43x4fd,154000,zengmlol

Almost all of these players are super good and should get good teams asap usually.
They've been teamless for the whole year btw.",2016-01-19 19:13:36+00:00,cz48jpy,1,t3_41q40s,1267,zengmlol
