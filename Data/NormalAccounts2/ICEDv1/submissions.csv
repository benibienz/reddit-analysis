Most of the time a player gets really good in a team, he either leaves or gets kicked after his contract is done. For example: LGD won worlds pretty easily, and their mid laner managed to get a rating of 100 (custom rosters).
First of all there would be no point for him to get kicked out after such a season. He could leave, that would be realistic if we compare it to Marin that left SKT after winning worlds 2015. But the problem then is, that the rating of these players are so high, that they ask for 999k/yr, and also refuse almost every team. I feel that the prices need some tweaking for custom rosters as well. In most cases the best players shouldn't leave the teams they are successful with and/or the teams should pay them anything they want.
That is just something I've noticed while playing through a lot of seasons.",zengmlol,The best players go free agents after 2-3 years?,https://www.reddit.com/r/zengmlol/comments/41q40s/the_best_players_go_free_agents_after_23_years/

In my opinion there should be an option to activate more rewards for them (Just for the optics of course). 
At the world tree there should be rewards for winning each league as well. For Example ""Won NA LCS (2016)"" (And maybe League MVP, so not the best regions like NA/EU can get some rewards too)
This is just a little thing that can be done fast and easily, but for me it would be more realistic like that. Maybe not everyone shares this opinion.",zengmlol,New Suggestion: More Awards for the worlds tree,https://www.reddit.com/r/zengmlol/comments/41jnc2/new_suggestion_more_awards_for_the_worlds_tree/
