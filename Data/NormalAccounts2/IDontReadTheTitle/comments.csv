137,"Summary : was using the phone fine, my battery died while in the coffee shop so I plugged it into my quick charge car charger on the commute home. It showed the empty battery charging and after a few percentage points it booted itself on normally. When I got home my phone was at 55% charge, I took it off my car charger and used the phone as normal. When I was browsing on my phone my battery was at 34%, all of a sudden the app I was on froze and my phone shut down, and I thought maybe my battery was calibrated incorrectly, but even when I held the power button I couldn't get the low battery screen on the phone or even boot the phone up. I plugged it into my wall charger and it's not charging at all. I switched batteries and plug it in again, and nothing. I hold the power button while the USB cable was in and it showed the battery on the screen with the loading pinwheel in the middle. I tried to press power and volume down to boot into recovery and I got onto the boot screen, but it restarted and went back to the boot screen, and it hasn't moved since. I battery pull and try again and now it isn't even responding to the power button.
