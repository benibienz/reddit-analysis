She legally owns the house. I don't pay rent; the housemate is month-to-month, no lease, no deposit of any kind (stupid I know).

My sister is out abroad living life while she is renting out 2 rooms to one tenant. The tenant uses more house space than me because he brought a lot of luggage and put into storage in our garage and he brought home 6 cats. I've just relegated my space to my own room now whereas he has space of the kitchen, living room because he lets the cats roam in the house. The cats are peeing and pooping everywhere and the housemate just throws pet deodorizer on it. They have started peeing on one of the couches as well. They have broken the window blinds from climbing through them, and they have teared at my clothes that I hang on the coat stand in the living room. There's cat hair everywhere.

I have taken pictures of every incident and have shown it to my sister the landlord, but thru her mental gymnastics has told me that the pictures are not recent enough, that I have to send it to her as it's happening. She is +16 hours ahead in timezone and she doesn't even respond right away, what else am I supposed to do? I really do not know what is going on in her mind, because she told me to clean up after the cats that I never wanted in the house.

So all the things in the living room where the housemate is letting the cats roam free and dirty are ours, and I wanted to protect ourselves with the damages that are definitely racking up. What should I be doing?

I live in my house with my brother (23M) and one other housemate that my sister (32F), the ""landlord"" rents 2 rooms out to. My sister originally rented out the 2 rooms to her friend and her bf (the housemate), but they broke up and he took the 2 rooms.


  After the couple had split, the housemate brought home a kitten on a whim 4 months  ago. In the beginning I expressed disapproval because I knew pets in our house would make a huge mess. He had just responded with ""but you guys like cats"" and that was the end of that discussion. He eventually made a cat home and litter box out of cardboard and set up the kitten in our kitchen. I was disgusted about cat poop in the kitchen and so I completely stopped using the kitchen to cook/prepare my food. I've been exclusively eating out or eating frozen food I can microwave, which is uneconomical and unhealthy for me.

The housemate does not clean up after the cat regularly. He lets the cat poop pile up in the litter box and the cat kicks out litter when it's trying to bury her poop (another reason why I just avoid the kitchen now, and I'm afraid about toxoplasmosis). There are multiple times I come home and was run over by the smell of ammonia and poop in my house, and I have had headaches from staying at home. 

There was a time the cat went missing from the house for almost a week, and I was relieved and thought the cat had ran away, but it turned out that the housemate had let the cat go out purposely, where she was able to fuck the neighborhood strays. His cat came home pregnant and gave birth to 5 kittens right outside my room on the carpet. The stain is still there, the housemate did not clean it up right away.

My brother had brought up to the housemate about housing the cats in one of his rooms, and the housemate nonchalantly dismissed the suggestion because ""there's room in the kitchen"". So the housemate erects more cat structures out of cardboard. He makes another cat home for the cat+kittens and a ghetto cat tree/fort. 

The house continued to smell either like cat litter+baking soda or poop/shit, but it got worse when the kittens started walking. The cats had expanded their territory from the kitchen into the living room. One of my fears was that the cats would go into the nooks and cranny's of the living room to poop and pee. That was exactly what happened when I started noticing the stronger poop/pee smell in the living room to which it was almost unbearable to be in over the course of a week. The kittens had made the area behind the TV/TV stand their bathroom. I did not actually see pee because when I investigated the area, the pee already had baking soda soaking it up. There was poop visible though. It has been at least 4 days since I noticed the baking soda on the floor and over 10 days since the stronger smell in the living room.
I texted the housemate and asked him to clean it 2 days ago, and he responded with ""You clean"".

I need to explain why I have trouble communicating with this housemate, because he is the type of person to ""keep tabs/points"" on people. Right after I had asked him to clean up after his cats, he told me to clean the living room table. I had a bag of flyers from a conference at a corner of the living room where he finally put another cardboard cathouse over. I noticed that the bag was missing and the contents of the bag was emptied out on the living room table. This stuff happened to be on top of all my brother's clutter (he's a really messy person, but I can deal with him because he's reasonable at least). I can and have cleaned up after myself, but my brother's clutter is still there. 
The housemate is generally a passive-aggressive dickish person, like he would set the kittens on our furniture in the living room but not on his, and he would pull the ""I pay rent"" card on me and only me. The cat pee/poop/baking soda mix is still there now.

So this whole time of course I have communicated to my sister about this problem and many other problems in the past, but my sister always does not support me. She would shut down every concern I have with excuses - one time I told her we have extensive black mold in the bathroom which is really detrimental to your health, we would need professionals to clear it out. She responded that she's planning on destroying the house and rebuilding it so there's no need to fix the bathroom. I told her that the cat's litter box was not being cleaned and that it's also extremely unsafe, and she would tell me that cats are cleaner than dogs and the housemate is a busy person, I can't expect him to be taking care of the cat 24/7 She only fills the role of ""landlord"" through collecting rent, as she is not physically in the USA - She is abroad trying to find herself. What I feel is that she is dependent on the money of the housemate and the other people she rents out to because she is living in an expensive country and taking language classes there that I'm sure is not cheap.  

I do not know what to do now, there are 6 cats in the house. I am not sure if he is planning on keeping the cats, but I am sure he will not just give them away for free, he would try to sell the kittens. 
I only work enough to barely pay for my classes so I could be a full-time student so moving out would be hard for me. My sister does her best to counter every complaint I have so I have just resorted to not giving a shit, or at least I am trying - At the same time it's also my house that is being ruined.

What are my options?

TL;DR My housemate is a fucking asshole to me and leaving his cats' pee/poop on the floor of my house while my sister supports him.

Had a long uphill battle of 3 months contacting them over and over on chat, email and phone. I finally was able to send my phone over August 15th, and I had to ask for a shipping label, they didn't tell me that I could get free shipping.

FedEx tracking said the phone arrived at their facility August 19th. I look on their website for tracking and it is just stuck at ""Received by LG facility"". I contact customer service multiple times over the next 3 weeks and I always get the same Indian phone agents or someone obviously who doesn't have English as their first language tell me excuses like they are building a brand new phone for me, or they blamed FedEx for not giving them a tracking # yet (which means to me they did not even ship it out yet because they would get a tracking # if they shipped it). I called multiple times a day and escalated the issue with multiple agents. 
I even called once and demanded to speak to a supervisor, and after putting me on hold for 30 minutes, the same guy I spoke to posed as a supervisor! He promised me that I would get the phone last week of 9/12-9/16. Nothing.

This whole time I am tweeting at LG on twitter like many of you suggested and I am being ignored by them. I saved many chats of them saying I'd get a brand new phone and I got so fed up because they were telling bald-faced lies about the whereabouts of my phone. I finally got confrontational with them yesterday, after over a month of my phone disappearing they sent me a shipping confirmation of the phone 9/21/16. Before the shipping confirmation, I looked at the LG tracker on their website and it showed my phone was ""Receiving Repairs"" and was received 9/7/16, and it had been stuck there since. After the shipping confirmation the page got updated to ""Shipping to Customer"" and they listed the date of shipment back as 9/9/16! I was just appalled they lied about receiving the phone and shipping the ""repaired"" phone back in a timely manner.

I received it today and it's obviously not brand new, S/N 604, with the back cover all scratched up and some plastic housing where the motherboard was melted. 

The summary was that they replaced the motherboard of my phone, but I was told it'd be a whole new replacement because I sent in a H815 and got a H811 back.

This morning my gf calls me and I noticed that usually the phone screen would turn into the dialer accept/reject screen when receiving a call, even if there's a lockscreen in place. I unplugged my phone and tried to unlock my phone. I notice that it's pretty hot near the receiver.

I have a lockscreen tap code so I tried tapping it in, I know I was correctly tapping it in and after 8+ tries slowly deliberately inputting the code, the phone did not respond at all so I missed the calls. I tried to input the tap code with the screen off and that usually works too, but it didn't this time. 

So I deliberately inputted the wrong passcode so I could get the option to input my backup pin to unlock my phone. I enter my pin, and I try to press OK, but pressing OK did not move me further from the lockscreen, nothing happened when I inputted my backup pin.

I tried to take a screenshot but I got a System Toast message of ""Cannot take screenshot while moving data to the SD card"" which doesn't make any sense to me at all.

After the backup pin failed, I turned the screen off and on again, and I was put back to the lockscreen - only that it wasn't the same, the little crosshatches that made the box for the knock code input was gone, and all that was left was the highlighted area of the knock code input and my notifications in the lock screen.
I wasn't allowed to input any knockcode or make any emergency call anymore

I didn't get a screenshot of this last description because I tried to go into my settings thru the pulldown notification shade in the lockscreen. As soon as I pressed ""settings"" I got a system error message that quickly flashed on the screen, so I couldn't read what it said, and my phone only showed my phone wallpaper, nothing else.

I had my friend call my phone again and I finally got my dialer screen coming on! But something else was wrong. On the dialer screen as I was receiving the call, the system message of ""Process system isn't responding. Do you want to close it?"" blocked the interaction of the dialer screen. I wasn't able to press either option of ""OK"" or ""WAIT"", so I could not take the call.

My phone is still very warm as of right now, and the notification lights still work showing I missed calls. My phone had a tasker profile that puts phone to vibrate when I put the screen facedown, that's still working, I feel a vibration when I do that.

EDIT 2: I powered off my phone right now, 11:00 AM. The LG boot animation showed and the power off music played and the screen is black. However, the notification light that breathes briefly when the phone is turning off is STILL BREATHING. The light is still pulsing after 3-4 minutes. Shit.

 Anyone that was near me that night could you please respond and be a witness for my complaint to the theme park? ",LosAngeles,[help] you witnessed a scare actor run into me,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/3qi2ht/help_you_witnessed_a_scare_actor_run_into_me/

I know that creepypasta is a variation of copypasta, and I always thought it was pronounced copy paste-a, just like copy and paste, which is what that exactly is, Internet stories that are copied and pasted over and over again e.g. The Navy Seal copypasta. 

I mean it's only logical to pronounce it as paste-a instead of pasta, right? Or is it the Internet and because fuck you, that's why. 

Why else would it be pasta? ",NoStupidQuestions,How are you supposed to pronounce creepy pasta?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/3jh0e8/how_are_you_supposed_to_pronounce_creepy_pasta/

I plug in headphones to use as an antenna for the radio, and there's an option to listen to the radio through the speakers. When I select that option the radio broadcast sounds very far away and tinny. It is a different experience through the headphones. 

The speakers sound normal through other means of video playback, music playback etc.

When I first got the phone I only got H+, so I manually set up the LTE APN. When I toggle the network settings to gsm/wcdma/lte auto I get 4G, but my cell signal drops to half, the signal strength is lower. I toggle gsm/wcdma auto I get H+ and my cell signal strength is higher, I get full bars.

I know if signal strength is lower that battery life would be worse, and it's a double whammy since 4G is on also. Is there any way to fix this? I'm just using H+ for the time being.
