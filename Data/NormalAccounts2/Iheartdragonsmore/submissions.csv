I just work six days a week and I'm working towards being a manager, I don't even want too. I just feel like I have too, for many reasons.

I feel like I don't have any other prospects then this job

I don't know what else to do with my fucking life

I feel like if I don't do this, my mom (Who convinced me to do it to begin with) won't be happy.

I just can't, I either want to fucking be dead rather then work like a dog with shitty fucking customers and coworkers. Or just run away. I don't now, I just feel like a god damn mess. I really wish my therapist wasn't off tomorrow, I really need to speak with her this week. I feel so fucking shitty, I feel like theres a huge weight on me, and I don't think I can lift it. I don't think I can do this, I think I fucking suck at everything I do.

So there was a to go order, don't want to say the meal name exactly so you guys don’t figure out where I work. But, essentially Its cheesey potatoes with eggs and veggies. Pretty good, it was a to go order with a side of a salad. The order came up fine, looked good, I was responsible for making the salad, since no one else wanted to do it.

Never made a salad at work, it was busy, I just kinda guessed what went in it and guessed the portions. Handful of lettuce, some cheese, chicken, tomatoes, cucumbers, the works. I bring it over to the customer, was some white lady with enough piercings to attract lighting states away. Smelled a bit, skinny, darkness under her eyes, with her other male friends, looked the same unkempt, I am telling you this just because fuck them. I swear they were crack addicts or something. Anyway, piercing lady was immediately unhappy, started moaning ""THIS IS NOT A TEN DOLLAR MEAL""

I responded ""Well what seems to be the problem? The Potatoes and cheese is too portion, we have good cooks, they’ve been working here a while. I could get my mana-""

""THERE ARE NO AVOCADOS IN MY SALAD! THIS IS HARDLY A MEAL! I WANT A REFUND!"" (She already paid for it)

Me: ""Oh, sorry! I completely forgot about the avocados! My bad, first time making a salad here, I'll just put some avocados in. No biggie!"" I smile, trying to calm her down, how quickly she got angry over something minor was pathetic, but I wasn't going to let her bring me down. I find a smile and a polite response a lot more aggravating to these people then being smart. Like my ma always says ""With a big mouth, you won't fit anywhere. But with a big ass, you're welcome everywhere""

Lady:""NO! DONT TAKE THIS SALAD! I WANT TO KEEP IT! MAKE A NEW ONE""

Me: I was pretty confused, was she really trying to get a free salad out of me? I honestly thought she miss understood me in someway, it happens, so I repeated myself, it was pretty loud and busy afterall, it happens. ""Uh, I'll just take this and fix it, okay?"" I reach for the container, she hastily snatches it away, I kinda widened my eyes, just shocked at how she grabbed it, she grabbed it so quickly a little tomato fell to the floor, poor tomato.

Lady: ""NO! THIS IS MY SALAD! MAKE ME A NEW ONE"" (I am not exaggerating, this is what she said verbatim and seriously.) I stood there for a brief second, just trying to figure out if a women in her mid thirties was seriously behaving in this way.

Me: ""Mam, I just want to fix your salad, I'll give your avocados, some more lettuce and tomatoes too if you feel its lacking, its really not a problem. It just would take me a second, I mean, you could even see me do this from here.""

Lady: ""NO! MAKE A NEW ONE! I WANT THIS ONE AND THAT ONE""

Me: I put my hands in the air and walked away to grab my manager, I couldn't really tolerate this stupidity any longer. I told her something along the lines of ""Alright, just let me get my manager"" Brought my manager there, everything ended with her getting her precious extra salad. Later, me and my manager just went in the back with some soda to laugh and make fun of the lady.

Hope you enjoyed the story, just found it pretty funny!",TalesFromYourServer,The Salad,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/3s1sxl/the_salad/

I don't really get offended, or angry too easily. I generally love the community, and have no qualms with them. I guess the community doesn't speak for everyone. I just want to bring this up because, I love tf2, and I love a lot of the people who play it. The people are what make tf2, tf2, and my experiences today, and what I learned from others, made me pretty upset.

I guess it started when two of my female friends were playing tf2. And thats where it started, them being female. I joined there game, and one of them had domned this salty guy last game as sniper. The next game, he kept making sexist remarks, saying things like ""Oh of course the girl needs TWO ubers"". I'm not going to spit out the guys name, I don't want to start a witch hunt. I just got pretty upset, I called him for what he was, a sexist. Ofcourse, that makes me a white knight. Yup. I guess you can't be friends with someone of the opposite sex unless you want to be in bed with them. The tf2 community is better then this, I was the only one saying anything, a couple people agreed with me thats its wrong. But most people were silent. 

In a game where we throw sanvichs and do the russian hat dance, we should make sure everyone has a good experience. I just want to remind you guys to say something too, its not right, its not okay. If we don't say anything, guys like this will think its okay. This shouldn't be normal, if this was happening to someone who was black, or any other race then white ""Oh you suck cause you're black"" sorta thing, I know alot of folks would get pissed, and vocalize it. I don't know, call me stupid, call me an sjw, I don't care, troll me, send me threats, do whatever. I just want everyone to not be assholes to each other based on someones race sex age whatever. 

I still love tf2. ",tf2,[PSA] Don't be a bystander,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/3ejd7r/psa_dont_be_a_bystander/
