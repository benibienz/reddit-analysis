I was in the meatpacking district of new york like 5 years ago, waiting for friends on the side of the street. This dude walks up to me and talks about his bullshit rapping. I'm clearly not showing interest, doing the minimum social contract while clearly telling him to fuck off with my behavior. He hands me a CD, I take it so he'll go away. Then he asks for money and I just laugh at him and hand his CD back. 

The best part was his anger at me. I to this day don't know if this is mental illness, or a really well-rehearsed con in such that people would actually pay him because he's angry. I was this close to telling him to 'fuck off' before I put a fist in his cheek. 

Edit: I know the second point doesn't directly follow from the first, but the indignant point reminded me of the second story.

526,"It does smell like that. Especially since I got this email this morning from Biden/info@whitehouse.gov with the title ""Why I'm going to OHIO today"" (emphasis mine): 

""	

The White House, Washington
My dad had something he used to say to me:

“A job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about dignity and respect.”

Part of what he meant by that, I think, is that without the ability to provide for your family, you’re deprived of your dignity.

That’s the fundamental spirit behind a big change our Administration made today to modernize our overtime rules: Making sure hard work is rewarded with fair pay.

The change we’re making today is straightforward:

Right now, you're guaranteed overtime if you’re an hourly worker, but if you’re salaried, you’re only automatically guaranteed overtime if you make less than $23,660. If you’re a manager on salary and you work an extra 10, 20, 30 hours a week -- you often don’t get paid a dime more for those additional hours. That’s simply wrong.

Starting in December, we're making sure that more workers get paid fairly for the overtime hours that they work. With this new rule, we’re increasing the cutoff for automatic overtime for salaried workers to $47,476 -- most salaried workers making less than $47,476 will be guaranteed overtime pay for working more than 40 hours a week.

Companies will have a choice: Pay their workers for the extra hours they put in, or cap their hours at 40 hours a week. For over 4 million workers, this change means they’ll either get a bump in pay or will get more time with their families if they work more than 40 hours a week. Or more time to go back to school or get additional job training.

Today, I’ll head to Columbus, Ohio to visit a business, an ice cream company called Jeni’s, with 600 employees around the country. They’ve got a management that understands what “fair” means. They’ve already begun making changes to guarantee overtime to some of their managers.

You can learn more and listen in right here.

The law since the 1930s has said that anyone working more than 40 hours a week is working overtime. And if you’re working overtime, you should get paid for it. We can’t allow folks with families to support to work long hours without being paid fairly for it.

It’s not right. So today, we’re doing what we can to fix it.

The President and I have been laser-focused on rebuilding the basic middle-class bargain that used to exist, and that both parties have signed on to. What it comes down to is that if you contribute to the success of the company that employs you, you should get paid fairly for it. Because of the Administration’s efforts to rebuild that basic bargain, the economy has gone from crisis to recovery to resurgence. Wages are on track to rise this year by over 3 percent. Today’s expansion of overtime protections will build on this momentum.

That’s how you increase access to the middle class. But we know we have more work to do and we’re going to keep going right through the finish line.

You can tune in to the event in Ohio right here.

See you out there.

740,"Ok, guys, sorry I've been silent. Here's the deal: I talked to both Tim and his campaign manager, and they're going another route-- there are software systems similar to VAN (like some mentioned in this thread), and they will have all the voter data. It does not include all the data that DWS and the VAN have (which the democrats have collected over the years), but if we get a ton of volunteers to phonebank from all over the country, and the people in the 23rd go canvass on the ground, we can totally do this.

As some have said, they want an open-source replacement to the VAN and all the accoutrements: There is a project in the works, but may not be ready before August. Tim's campaign will be ok as far as the voter database goes, but if you are interested in working on this project, please PM me, and I'll put you in touch with those that are doing it. Please only do so if you actually have time and technical experience to work on it. 

For those who have already filled out the survey and haven't heard from me, I apologize, but it was for good reason. The campaign is now starting to take off and can use our help. Before now, it would've just been a bunch of noise. Expect to hear more from me in the near future. Thanks for all you guys are doing, and let's change the way people run for office (and get Tim elected)!!!

He was critical of Greenspan's work as chair of the Fed in the 90s (which Greenspan later admitted he was wrong about his policies). More recently, he was working against the TPP and tried working with Debbie Wasserman Schultz, but her reaction to their local movement is what inspired him to run.

1657,"I agree with your first point, and that it won't happen. 

But my main point about illegal immigration is that we can't reasonably take everyone, and legal immigration is the goal to address your second point. But what amount of immigration is best? I don't know. And if we have it, it should be legal, and people who come here illegally shouldn't be rewarded for that compared to others who would like to come here legally. 

I agree that I wouldn't want anyone to be at risk of spreading disease, but that's a consequence of them being here illegally. If we have single payer healthcare, the cost of such a system would increase if we paid for illegal immigrants, and would probably attract more. I wish we could solve the whole world's problems, but we can't. Single payer healthcare has to be paid for, and it can only function with restrictions. Look at the Western European countries with socialized medicine: they tend to have more restrictive immigration laws.
