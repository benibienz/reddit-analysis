Well, for one, they each have different approaches and we'll see which one, or hopefully all, effectively works for our goals. Of course, each has a different scope. Tim sent an email out today that I think really hits home one thing for what Progress For All via what Tim learned on his campaign. It's copied below. Full disclosure: Carlos is a friend of mine, and I'm really proud of the work he did, both on Tim's campaign and at LIU. He's a natural. 

Please share Progress For All to all your friends!

""John -

Progress For All was started because our movement has always been bigger than one candidate or one campaign. This is about a new era of grassroots political activism in American politics. And it starts with young people.

Take Carlos Calzadilla, who had just graduated high school and spent his summer knocking on doors during our campaign against Debbie Wasserman Schultz. He was one of our best field organizers, part of an army of hundreds of young organizers who were collectively knocking on more than 10,000 doors a week at the peak of our campaign.

Your contribution paid his salary and allowed him to gain tremendous experience in how to mobilize people as part of our political revolution.

A week after our primary, on his first day as a freshman at Long Island University in Brooklyn, Carlos was confronted with an unprecedented administration lockout of faculty. He sprang into action and used his newly honed skills to organize LIU students to protest the lockout. He knocked on dorm room doors throughout the night, recruited student volunteers, and staged a dramatic student walkout.

Within days, the administration succumbed to the pressure and ended the lockout of faculty. He spoke truth to power — and it worked.

Progress For All will continue to mentor young people around the country, teaching them how to use grassroots activism to bring about social change. But we need your continued support. Can you contribute right now?

Dozens of my former campaign workers have already moved on to other campaigns and grassroots organizing jobs. I am proud of what we accomplished, mentoring these young men and women to speak truth to power and truth to the powerless. This is the legacy of our movement. With your contribution, we can support these young people as they continue to change the world.

Thank you for everything you do.

In solidarity,

Tim Canova

Many people work hard and are upset with DWS, but they don't have the time to get into politics. Once we introduce them to Tim, you can see the spark light up. Your phonebanking REALLY helps us to find these people more efficiently. My favorite story today involved a man who came to the door upset that I interrupted his TV show. He stated aggressively that I need to make it quick-- remember, this man had never heard of Tim. I skipped my usual routine and just asked him whether or not he liked Bernie. He paused-- he loves Bernie. I told him about how Bernie endorsed him and how Tim is walking in his footsteps. Within 45 seconds, this man now has a yard sign and has committed to convince his family and neighbors to vote for Tim. 

Phone banking helps us find people like this, especially by weeding out people whose doors aren't worth knocking on. We've only got a few short weeks left, and this is a critical election in this revolution.

Burnt out because of what happened to Bernie? Stop licking your wounds and fight for the next few weeks, and we can have a silver lining.

It's a biomechanical simulator that takes muscle forces, body masses, and gravity, and calculates the dynamics of the limbs. Since it crashes on my scale, I was figuring I could just scale the model and get the same dynamics. Here's my question:

Do I scale the mass/forces/lengths differently? Say I scale the length by a factor of 10, then the mass would scale differently-- proportional to the 3rd power, and the force should scale proportional to the 2nd power (related to the cross-sectional area of the muscles). But now, this changes the dynamics!!! 

So if I scale everything by 10 (but gravity stays the same), should the dynamics be the same as if it were the original?

Dear Mr. Kornacki and/or producers, 
I appreciate that you had Debbie Wasserman Schultz on your program the other day and continued to press her on her controversial activities as DNC chair, as well as asking her about why she won't talk about or debate her primary opponent, Tim Canova. I would love it if you would have Mr. Canova on your show so that he can explain his side of the issue. Thanks for your coverage!

Every single day, we're getting more and more evidence that the race is tightening in Nevada. A brand new CNN/ORC poll JUST came out showing Hillary Clinton beating Bernie Sanders by just ONE POINT in Nevada -- well within the poll's margin of error.

A surprise win in Nevada is well within Bernie's reach, but to make it happen he needs some serious help from Democracy for America members like you. Can you make calls to voters in Nevada and other early states from home to help Bernie? (Click here for more information.) If not, can you chip in $3 or more to support Bernie and DFA?

Bernie Sanders for President
Dear John,

Only two days until the Nevada caucuses, and South Carolina votes February 27. Then there are 12 contests on March 1 for Super Tuesday.

This is it. Our people-powered revolution is building nationwide. But Bernie needs your help in the next several days to contact as many voters as we possibly can.

Easy things: 

Whenever you see DWS or Bernie's revolution mentioned on social media, don't forget to comment and link both to www.timcanova.com and us here at /r/timcanova (particularly on reddit). 

When you're talking to Bernie supporters, especially if the topic of his revolution comes up, please mention Tim and get them to donate a couple bucks his way-- Remember that there are 180,000+ members of /r/sandersforpresident. If we can get 20% of those people to donate $5 to Tim, that would be $180,000. That's a good bit for a Congressional campaign. Plus of course all the millions of Bernie supporters offline as well we can try to ask for small donations.

If you have friends in Florida's 23rd Congressional district (around Hollywood, FL/North of Miami), or even nearby, make sure you let them know about Tim. Local volunteering efforts will be underway shortly-- I will post info here once I know more. 

Also, you can join our Grassroots FB page to help get people involved who aren't on reddit: https://www.facebook.com/groups/GrassrootsForTimCanova/

If you want to volunteer through my online efforts (which are coordinated with the campaign), please fill out this survey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Z5L5SYZ
I'll be getting volunteer activities up and going in the next few weeks once the campaign infrastructure is better in place. 

Thanks for your help! Please spread the word.

""Hi, there!

We are contacting you on behalf of the Bernie Sanders' National Organizing staff-- a speaker from our campaign would like to come to your area for a large organizing rally with local grassroots volunteers called a barnstorm. 

We are reaching out to you for immediate assistance with securing venues in Atlanta to hold these events. After booking a venue, we will get you in touch with local volunteer organizers within your area and they will take it from there. 

We need two potential venues within vicinity of these following areas/dates:

January 29- Friday @ 7 PM - 9:00 PM
Atlanta, GA

January 30 - Saturday @ 11 AM - 1:00 PM
Atlanta, GA

Each barnstorm would consist of a us speaking about where we are at in our campaign, how we can organize/maximize our efforts, and an informational discussion about our most powerful tool as of current: PHONE BANKING. 

Ideally, a barnstorm venue would include:

minimum room capacity for AT LEAST 175-200 volunteers 
FREE, or inexpensive rental preferred
microphone and speaker system 
seating/chairs, although not necessary
in a central location for easy access to most people  
examples: auditoriums, union halls, gymnasiums, community centers, and library/college rooms, VFW, and specific unions that have endorsed Bernie (ex: CWA, Letter Carriers, National Nurses Assoc., etc.)

Please contact us if you have a potential venue or any other contacts that may assist us in the searching process. When replying to this email thread, please be sure that the following emails are CC'd in your response (or click reply all):

1) Growing our supporters both here in /r/timcanova and on the facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/GrassrootsForTimCanova/
You can do that by visiting /r/unseatDWS, /r/SandersForPresident, /r/politics, and /r/FloridaforSanders. In addition to posting stuff about Tim (follow their guidelines), anytime you see him mentioned, write something in support and link to this sub and the fb page. 

2) I hate asking for money, but this isn't for me, it's for the Bernie revolution. So please donate if you can! Every little bit helps and makes for good press: timcanova.com.

Thanks! And I look forward to growing this community with all of you and to help Bernie with his revolution!

And the disagreements are not anywhere near a deal breaker-- his main points are much more important. And yes, I'm totally voting for him in the primary and hopefully general, and I'm going to a meeting on the 29th, and have donated to him multiple times. I am one of you. 

So one main disagreement I have with him is his stance on immigration reform, particularly the pathway to citizenship. Let me explain why, and maybe addressing my concerns could help him with people who are on the fence due to this issue (which is clearly going to be important in the near term, I suspect, given Trumps support from people over his caustic and stupid approach).

First, I agree that there needs to be immigration reform. Second, I have no idea what a good policy would be... I'm stuck on that one. I'm very pro immigration, but *legal* immigration. I would never turn in an illegal immigrant, but that doesn't mean the government shouldn't have a reasonable, enforceable policy. Many of my friends are immigrants or children of immigrants (if not most of my good friends), and most of them don't like illegal immigration because they had to do it the right way. And there are clearly problems with illegal immigrants directly or indirectly related to poverty. When possibly more than 3% of your population is poor and illegal, and primarily located in certain areas that use up municipal resources, that can cause a strain on society. 

I approach this problem from a utilitarian perspective, not an idealistic one: I have nothing against the immigrants themselves, but there are problems related to the influx of undocumented people. I also wonder how we can fix this so it is the lesser of all evils.

I then imagined myself sitting on a plane in coach with Bernie, and getting into this discussion. What would I imagine he would say to change my mind? And the following was essentially the argument I imagined he would make:

Clearly there is a need for cheap labor, and Americans don't want those poor-paying, back-breaking jobs. Yes, there are issues with illegal immigration, but those can be solved by addressing the poverty issue on both sides-- citizens/legal immigrants and illegal immigrants alike. [insert compassion argument-- that's not what this post is about, though]. By granting a pathway to citizenship, as well as working out a mechanism for new immigration for jobs that Americans don't want, we can make these people legal and better integrated to our system for both their and America's benefit. They're here because there is a demand for their cheap labor, and it's a better option for them, otherwise they wouldn't be here. 

Furthermore, if there was a minimum wage at $15/hr, which would apply to everyone, then perhaps more Americans would take these jobs and there wouldn't be as much of a demand for illegal immigrants. And if not, then it shows that we still need immigrants willing to work those jobs-- so make it legal for them to do so, and then we can get rid of the major problems of immigration for migrant/poor illegal immigrants. Obviously, some people will still try to pay less than the minimum wage illegally, but there will be policies in place to go after them. 

I liked my thought experiment and would love feedback.",SandersForPresident,Thoughts on a disagreement Bernie and I have over immigration,http://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/3epmss/thoughts_on_a_disagreement_bernie_and_i_have_over/
