1,"&gt;Is there a game yet?

Not a finished game, but what's there is a lot of fun.

&gt;Wasn't it supposed to be released in 2014?

The originally scoped game was supposed to deliver Squadon 42 by 2014. After the massive influx of cash, CIG asked the backers if they wanted to expand the scope with the funding. They [overwhelmingly](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/13266-Letter-From-The-Chairman-19-Million) said yes.  

&gt;Wasn't Squadron 42 supposed to be released this year?

It was. It's been pushed back. It sucks, but most (unscientifically observed) backers feel that they'd rather the game be delayed and come out right instead of a bugged mess like so many AAA games as of late. It's part of CIG's [pledge](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/the-pledge) as well. 

&gt;Call me a skeptic or whatever but they aren't getting a red cent from me until there's an actual product.

There's nothing wrong with being a skeptic and cautious with your money. I think what alleviates the fears of the majority of backers is that we can play what's out, it's constantly being updated, they've been extremely transparent with the process, and they actually listen to concerns/suggestions from the fans.

11,"CIG's plan was to develop Star Citizen in modules. There was enough of a natural separation between the modules so there wasn't a lot of overlap to worry about.

Two of those modules were the dogfighting module (Later changed to Arena Commander by [Original Systems](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/spectrum-dispatch/13886-Original-Systems)) and the FPS module(Later changed to Star Marine by [InterDimensional Software](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/15032-Portfolio-InterDimension-Software)).

The initial reasoning was to put these out and allow players to dogfight and play FPS so as to fine tune the mechanics of each facet of the game. 

Instead of just throwing these away at the end, CIG folded these into the lore. They became video games within the game. It works out because it allows players to compete without risk of dying inside the universe. Opens the doors for e-sports and leaderboards, without it arcading up the universe and screwing up the immersion. ",2016-11-21 01:17:43+00:00,da8wn10,4.0,t1_da8ur1f,3184.0,Games

The only thing Microsoft did when they came in, is cut features so they could get it out the door. This is proven in that the faction system is static in game, when it's supposed to change depending on who you do missions for.

&gt;So would everyone I think. But if Roberts fucks this up, do you think any other developer will ever get a chance like this again?

Contrast this to the ""losers,"" which includes Muslims, people of color, and women. Trump advocates in his autobiography the unification of all ""winners"" to ""make America great again,"" and the expulsion of all ""losers"" from this country.

Ahh just another lie. None of your claims are true. And that seems to be the liberal way. Invent controversial things about people that fit nicely into a meme that can be posted on social media and fuel the outrage.  

This is the **real** quote:

&gt;*Even if I never went on the offensive, there are a lot of people gunning for me now. One of
the problems when you become successful is that jealousy and envy inevitably follow. There
are people—I categorize them as life’s losers—who get their sense of accomplishment and
achievement from trying to stop others. As far as I’m concerned, if they had any real ability
they wouldn’t be fighting me, they’d be doing something constructive themselves.*",2016-11-13 12:28:24+00:00,d9yd4yc,2.0,t1_d9y4bw8,25608.0,politics

Obama was President for 8 years. That's why he spent so long bringing it up. Ted Cruz was only a nominee for 14 months(March 2015 to May 2016), where Trump brought this up consistently ever since day 1 all the way up until he dropped out.

352,"&gt;I can 100 percent guarantee that originally there was supposed to be more, but it was cut out. What I think happened, Mathew Lillard and Freddie Prince, taking centerstage, were allowed to go freestyle, and fucked-up royally somewhere along the way,

Roberts has talked about what happened a few times in public, and I talked to him about it in person once.

Basically, it was a combination of things. First, while he didn't want a young cast. But the studio thought that bringing Prinze Jr and Lillard would help attract the young crowd they assumed would be the target audience, since they were popular at the time. This was in contrast to what Chris wanted to do.

Secondly, the studio started to get nervous about the new Star Wars movie coming out (may 1999). They thought that if Wing Commander didn't beat it to the box office, they wouldn't make any money at all. And since they only cared about turning a profit, they accelerated production by 6 months, well into the process. This blind-sided Chris and forced him to cut a lot of stuff, as well as never really finishing the Kilrathi. That's why they got so little screen time and looked especially awful.

This is a big reason why he became so anti-publisher. This was the first time he decided to cave in to the wishes of those with the purse strings. Something he never really did in game development.

383,"There's really no leaving out of weapons at all in the military, unless you're a shitty soldier. Your weapon is an extension of your body. It shouldn't leave your side. In fact, if you leave it anywhere for longer than 30 seconds, it's likely going to be grabbed by someone and turned in...which means you're going to have a really really bad day.

But really, your weapon is your life. Any soldier worth a damn keeps their weapon clean as often as possible. 

&gt;I remember meeting a vietnam vet years ago, he told me he picked up an AK from the mud, where it could have been there for weeks if not months. He just pulled the charging handle and it functioned normally.

I think a lot of what you're talking about is exaggerations built on a bit of truth. The M-16/AR-15 back in the Vietnam era had a **lot** of issues. It jammed very easily. This has changed quite a bit as the platform has matured, and it's extremely reliable.

In contrast, the AK is a great system for what it is. The loose tolerances are one of the things what allow it to be so rugged. But it has been held up as this magical weapon that never jams, when that's not the case.

This has nothing to do with the power of the client video card. They are currently using netcode designed for Cryengine which has locked the server fps to around 30. The brand new netcode is almost finished and should be released very soon.

That's exactly what's happening. There is no ambient light. It all comes from stars or artificial lights.

The sun doesn't light the universe. The game takes place in a small section of our galaxy. There are about 120 star systems in the game, with about 400 planets(IIRC). Each system has one or more stars, except for a couple odd ones that have black holes and such.

To be fair, the head designers of the project aren't military. A lot of the nuances of how the military actually works are understandably lost on civilians. 
Sometimes you just have to make concessions and realize that they're doing the best that they can. 

I think that once the game comes out and they start adding ships according to need, they're going to listen to what fans think of what ship roles need to be filled.

498,"&gt;  When it comes to an entire military theater in real life and all the objects and forces within it, all the vehicles and technologies competing against one another weren't just dreamed up in isolation, rather they all evolved alongside each other so that they all made sense, countered real threats, improved upon the last iteration, solved any problems from older models, incorporated the enemy's weapons and thinking and strats, conformed to efficiency and economic and manufacturing even political realities, etc.

That's how it may seem in the PR statements, but that's not how it works in real life. There's a few factors which work against this belief you have that everything in the military is some perfect puzzle piece in a well oiled machine.

First off, companies propose their own prototypes to fill a minimum spec standard the military gives them. You could have 3 wildly different prototypes which branch off into different directions, while still meeting those goals.   

From there, the best design is not always chosen. Politics come into play. Some senator from a state that would be building that design if that company wins a bid, might be owed a favor. Kickbacks might have been given. Or simply, you might have a crappy procurement department that doesn't really know what the troops need.

Secondly, militaries often procure for the last war, not the next. Since it can take a decade to go from the drawing board, to procurement, to testing, to production...this is entirely understandable.

Lastly, doctrines and ways of thinking change. New leadership comes to power, and they  might have an entirely different big picture plan. The previous leadership might have believed tanks were the way to go, because the Soviet Union invading Europe was the most likely threat. The next set of leaders might want small urban vehicles and heavy drone use for counter-terrorism operations. But at the end of the day, you get a mix of both, because those tanks aren't magically going to leave the ranks. ""You go to war with the Army you have, not the Army you might want"".

So what ends up happening, is you go to war with all sorts of vehicles and equipment that was designed for a different battlefields/doctrines. And you're forced to shoehorn this equipment into your battleplan to work for you. 

MRAPs are a perfect example of this. The concept was decent enough, but they could only effectively be used in very specific areas. 

Basically, I think you're giving governments and military leadership too much credit.

Do you know who writes laws? The legislature. AKA a part of the government. Considering they are the ones writing the laws, I think we can safely say that their definition is the only one that matters.

Secondly, they are written in English. If you have above a 1st grade reading level, you should be able to easily comprehend the conditions which make something an incident of entrapment.

502,"&gt;Star Citizen's ship system: WW2, Halo, Star Wars, USA capitalism IN S-P-A-C-E!, 

You've obviously never played any of Chris Roberts' games before. All his space sims are based off of WW2, Star Wars, the US, and other influences. Not to mention the Kilrathi, who were based off of the Japanese during WW2. 

&gt;and what you get as a result is SC's cobbled together ship lineup.

So you mean kind of like real life? Do the cars you see drive by you follow any sort of overarching theme? Do the military vehicles designed by competing companies regularly look like they all fit together?

&gt;For example, should the Polaris even be considered a ""small capital ship"", isn't it more like a naval patrol boat or Coast Guard cutter 

Corvettes are not large vessels(relative to other capital ships) to begin with. They average about [500-2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvette) tons. The [Coast Guard Cutters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Harriet_Lane_\(WMEC-903\)) you referenced fall right into that range.

CIG inputs these specs into the Star Engine editor and starts painting the world with the tools. 

The tools create huge swaths of planetary surface at a time, letting the artist lay things out generally how they want. Then, after all that is done, they go through and fine tune the look of things. Add in cities, coastline harbors, points of interest etc.

722,"VR support will be added, but not till around release. They're designing the game with VR in mind, but the implementation is very low on their list of priorities because there's just not enough people using it yet. 

As for the differences between Elite and SC, well there's a few main ones:

* Elite is all about breadth, while Star Citizen is about depth. Elite has an entire galaxy filled with planets, but they're all procedurally created and most  have nothing of interest. Star Citizen will have around 400 planets that are created by artists. Each will have its own look and feel with cities and towns and such.

* Elite is all about making your own story. It's more of a solo game. It does have some ability to do multiplayer stuff, but it's not very fleshed out. (that may have changed with some updates, but yeah). Star Citizen is huge on lore and such for the player to build their character around. CIG will even run the galaxy like a Dungeon master running a game of D&amp;D.

* Star Citizen is making this game into a ""First Person Universe"" instead of just a space sim. There will be lots of FPS type combat and exploration. Elite doesn't have any First person modes right now, though they are supposedly working on it. 

Here's a [quick rundown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uUg7vnr6os) on what the game is.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=6&amp;v=ZWnY4U_5avU) is an example of a pre-rendered trailer. 

What you saw from CIG was not a pre-rendered trailer. We already have builds of the game that show gameplay with that level of detail.

&gt;You realize game developers do this all the time right? Has been done before and will most likely be done in the future. But hey, why would a game dev ever to lie to their audience?

Again, the logic part of your brain doesn't seem to be working. Because **some** companies in the history of game development have misrepresented their trailers, does not mean that CIG did, nor does it mean that it's a common occurrence.

Also, I have NEVER seen a pre-rendered trailer get mistaken for a gameplay video in my entire life. You might as well say that people have mistaken cartoons for footage of real people. ",2016-10-10 04:44:19+00:00,d8li0je,8.0,t1_d8lhkvw,752.0,gaming

842,"&gt;Why do all the naysayers just assume that a person would balk at spending money only because they cannot afford it?

You got that out of my post? I never said anything of the sort. In fact, it's the opposite. I'm saying CIG shouldn't give those who are prone to making such poor decisions, to do this. 

&gt;Some people find it easier to let the money go when it is in small amounts over time.
Some people find it hard to save up a large amount because they just blow it over time. So if they could make small payments when they have it then it is better for them.
Some people might just want to setup a pledge amount over time that leads to a reward.
There are many reasons why someone would want to break up a purchase into small chunks. Add to that, people are incentivized with concept sales to melt ships, which does not help the game. It just shifts money around instead of bringing in new money.

All of this is ignoring my point. If you have to string a a pledge over 6 months of payments because it's the only way you can mentally justify doing it....you shouldn't be spending that money in the first place.

Vaporware is often announced months or years before its purported release, **with development details lacking**.

We have constant proof that Star Citizen is being developed. There's been no suggestion that the game is going to be cancelled. And development details are overwhelming. 

Vaporware is a term used for games which fall off the radar and are no longer talked about by their developers. Half-Life 3 is an example. Starcraft: Ghost was an example until it was finally officially cancelled.

By your poor understanding of of the term, every single game ever made is vaporware until the day it is released.

1112,"Your typical AAA largescale MMO takes about 5 years. You normally don't see or hear anything about these games until 6 months before release. Even then, it's usually only a teaser. This is because the vast majority of work that goes into a game during the first few years is under the hood. 

Creating all the infrastructure systems that make a game work is a lot of work and not at all flashy for the consumer.

Your normal dev is already established, with standard operating procedures,  employees who are acclimated to their jobs, necessary equipment,  established partnerships with contractors, and a set budget to work under.

So that's your average AAA game and dev.

Now, let's look at CIG. They're just over 3 1/2 years into development of one of the most ambitious MMOs ever created, and a full AAA level campaign which is effectively a second game.

They started with like 2 or 3 people and spent basically a year finding offices, getting equipment, and hiring the starting staff of the company. 

Because of crowdfunding, they never knew how much money they would get, so there was no way to accurately plan out the scope of the game or hire the right amount of people. So as more funding came in, their plans had to be adjusted and people had to be hired. New hires had to be trained.

Basically, AAA games(with Publishers) at this point in development are almost never shown to the public. CIG has had to face a lot of challenges that were presented by having such a successful funding campaign. The development has been progressing steadily and I wouldn't worry about the state it's in right now. It's what you'd expect from a large AAA MMO at 3.5 years in.

1140,"&gt;No one mention subscription based game, they only mentioned a monthly sub, but if you happen to pay this monthly sub you not only get artwork but your get stuff in game which other non subscribers don't get. (Unless added to store later)

He said it was a subscription for the game(which suggests it's necessary to play). It's not. It's a subscription for funding the game. 

And the stuff Subscribers get are plants and little virtual ship models. Big whoop.

&gt;I can buy a ship for over 500 bucks on the store that is better stronger and faster than the one at 45 bucks, in a pvp world how is that not pay to win

No, you cant. 

&gt;If I can spend even more cash on that to make it better without actually playing the it seems to give players with more cash an unfair advantage.

Many of the larger ships are specialty ships. Cargo, exploration, mining. They wouldn't stand up to a couple cheap fighters flown by good pilots. Ships are designed in a rock-paper-scissors gameplay mechanic. They also require skill. 
In Battlefield, for instance, you can buy packs with unlocks for characters. But that doesn't magically make you better. A level one reroll player will consistently dominate a player who has obtained all their unlocks through purchases. 

&gt;The crowd funding model has one big flaw if the scope keeps changing it may never be finished or they never really polish up the 2 or 3 things that would have defined that game in its genre

The scope stopped changing almost 2 years ago. The money coming in now is going towards hiring more devs, fleshing out promised systems even more, post-launch content, and sustaining servers. 

&gt;not finishing the game and closing could be far more lucrative than launching 

I love this one. It's as if people think that's a common thing well-established game devs do all the time. Know what else is really lucrative? Robbing a bank. The majority of people don't do it though, because of their morals and ethics. 

&gt;This game has made 120 million before it has even been released.

It hasn't made a dime. All the money they take in prior to launch goes back into the game. They dont make a profit until they begin to sell released copies of the game.

No... Subscription based games **require** a subscription to play. This is a subscription for donation which gives you access to art assets and magazines earlier than other people.

&gt;Or you can pay 1200 bucks to play it according to this thread

A voluntary level of backing a crowdfunded project has nothing to do with the base cost to get the game. A cost which gives you access to **everything** through normal gameplay.

You don't seem to have a grasp of what ""pay to win"" means.

&gt;Andrew Wilson and Peter Moore have been saying they have been doing the same thing with EA for the past few years.

Preorders and merchandise sales dont effect the scope of a yet to be released game in the traditional funding model. 

Increased funding through pledges **does** effect the scope of many games(including Star Citizen) in the crowdfunding model. 

If you think otherwise, then post a source. 

&gt;It's really good that CIG could just close down tomorrow and not have to repay banks or other investors since people just gave the money to them.

They've showed no legitimate signs of being in trouble. They've also stated that they have angel investors lined up in the highly unlikely event that they were to run out of funding.

Either way, games get cancelled all the time and people don't get paid back. Investors assume risk. Welcome to capitalism.

There is no monthly subscription for the game. What you're linking, is a subscription method of backing that some backers had asked for. This money goes towards fan events and weekly videos. 
It is NOT required to play the game.

&gt; do I get the basic ship at $60 bucks

The [game is $45](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/fly-now). It comes with a ship. If you want the single player campaign(effectively a second game, with 70 missions and 20-50 hours of gameplay), it's just $15 more.

&gt;But I suppose I will have to have some of those ingame United Earth Credits  for that.

Credits are earned in game through normal gameplay. You don't have to spend any extra money outside of the base package. 

&gt;But my main thought is, would you be ok with this if it was EA?

EA takes your money for profit. CIG is taking this money and dumping it right back into the development of the game. That means more content, more fidelity, more ships, and more fleshed out gameplay mechanics.

&gt;“Both of us concluded that if we were providing the care that she was receiving, we’d be ashamed to show up in a doctor’s lounge. We’d be laughed out,” he added. “She’s receiving sort-of 1950-level care by our evaluation.”

&gt;Later in the interview, Dr. Drew mentioned that Mrs. Clinton suffered from two episodes of deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, which he described as a very common problem that normally results in blood clots in the leg.
“She also has hypothyroidism, and she’d been treated for hypothyroidism with something called Armour Thyroid, which is very unconventional and something that we used to use back in the ‘60s,” Dr. Drew said. “And **by the way, wow, Armour Thyroid sometimes has some weird side effects.**
 
&gt;“So she goes on **Coumadin,” he continued. “That’s weird, because Coumadin really isn’t even used anymore**. Now we use Eliquis or Xarelto, things like this. Certainly the presidential candidate would get one of the newer anti-coagulates. Then she falls, hits her head, and as a complication of that has something called a transverse sinus thrombosis.** This is an exceedingly rare clot. I’ve only seen one of these in my career, which is a clot in the collecting system for the cerebral spinal fluid, and it essentially guarantees that somebody has something wrong with their coagulation system. Well, she’s had two clots, a transverse sinus thrombosis**.

&gt;“And oh, by the way, **Armour Thyroid associated rarely with hyper-coagulability. So the very medicine the doctors are using may be causing this problem, and they’re using an old-fashioned medicine to treat it**. What is going on with her health care?” he asked. “It’s bizarre. I got to tell you. Maybe they have reasons, but** at a distance, it looks bizarre.** There ought to be some sort of standard for people that are going to lead the country or are going to making these important decisions.”

&gt;Another issue that “gravely concerned” the doctors is that Mrs. **Clinton had to wear prism glasses after she fell and hit her head, suffering from a concussion in 2012.**
**“That is brain damage, and it’s affecting her balance**,” Dr. Drew said. “Now clearly, it hasn’t affected her cognition, but tell us a little more about that. That’s profound. **And then number two, when they screened her for heart disease, again, they did an old-fashioned screen. It just seems like she’s getting care from somebody that she met in Arkansas when she was a kid, and you’ve got to wonder. You’ve got to wonder. It’s not so much that her health is a grave concern. It’s that the care she’s getting could make it a concern.”**

Stop being obtuse. You know what I meant. 

&gt;Stopping for a hazard is perfectly acceptable.

Braking to avoid hitting something is not the same thing as stopping your car and getting out. Not even close.

&gt;To be slightly inflammatory, are you going to be a wussy and make someone else do it?

Are you going to be a moron like this lady and get people killed?

1254,"&gt;That's only Top Secret information, though. Secret and Confidential are fine, as long as they use the USPS. Given the minuscule amount of Top Secret e-mails in the batches released so far

It only takes a single shred of Top Secret Material for an entire source to be classified as Top Secret.  This is corroborated by your source:

&gt;The overall classification level is the highest classification
level of information contained in the document. Each interior page
must be stamped or marked according to the highest classification
level of its content, including unclassified, when appropriate. For
example, **if one page is TOP SECRET, the entire document is TOP
SECRET.**


&gt; and the fact that even those 22 weren't marked Top Secret at the time

And it doesn't matter if they were marked or not. Anyone with an ounce of common sense can tell when something is Top Secret. There's no pleading ignorance. 

&gt; it seems plausible to me that these particular archives being sent through the mail were checked beforehand and didn't have any Top Secret information in them.

Except that they have to be sent in a method that requires signature (Postal Service Express Mail ore Registered). If they **had** done this, we would know what happened to the laptop. 

No matter which way you look at it, they mishandled classified information.

d. Electronic means using approved communications systems.

1434,"&gt;They play with an console controller, why no HOTAS?
&gt;controller have slower turn ratio vs a mouse, I think they did it on purpose to hide bad fps

They do this during presentations for a few reasons. First, it allows the presenter to walk around the stage while manipulating the game easily.  
Secondly, the analogue sticks allow for smooth panning for great cinematic style views as the presenter shows the game off. With mouse and keyboard, a presentation is much more jarring for the audience. 
They also have to worry about traveling. A HOTAS takes up a lot more room in your baggage than an XBOX controller.  
Lastly, it's easy for attendees to try the game out without having to learn lots of complex controls. XBOX controls are intuitive and well-known.  (note: these are the reasons CIG has specifically given when they were asked about it). 

&gt;lame A.I.

The enemies in the demo were players. The reason the enemy players were seemingly so bad, is because this was a scripted demo. And by scripted, I mean the player movements were rehearsed(not engine scripted). The main player obviously wasn't supposed to die, so the enemies were purposely missing.

&gt;Empty planet

That wasn't a planet. It was a small planetoid, closer to an asteroid than anything. It's also v1 of their Procedural Generation Planetary technology. V2 is almost finished(we haven't seen it yet), and is being shown at CitizenCon on October 9th. That's where we will see diverse Biomes like jungles, forests, mountainous, lava worlds, oceans, frozen tundras, etc. They've [specifically said](http://www.redbull.com/en/games/stories/1331814041509/making-star-citizens-planets-believable) that their tech should be able to put out forests that are on par with Star Wars Battlefront's [Endor map](https://content.pulse.ea.com/content/starwars-ea-com/en_US/starwars/battlefront/news-articles/the-star-wars-battlefront-planets--creating-endor/_jcr_content/featuredImage/renditions/rendition1.img.jpg). 

&gt;lame/boring first person weapons, I mean, bullets ? what year is it?

There's energy weapons as well. Why would you think bullets still wouldn't be used?  We've been using kinetic projectiles for over 1000 years. 

&gt;Seems somehow scripted or the players knew what to do before hand.

It was. They rehearsed it all so the audience would have something interesting to see that showed off all the elements they wanted to show. 

&gt;lame FPS implementation

I mean, I guess it's to each their own. The FPS stuff should streamline with the next version, which is releasing the FPS module(Star Marine). It'll allow them to do balancing and solve any issues in the fps mechanics. ",2016-08-27 08:24:54+00:00,d6ym3xg,2.0,t1_d6y176t,40697.0,oculus

1558,"&gt;Just like that FPS module that still isn't out?

So..your response to my assertion that the game will look better as it gets closer to release is to bring up a module that isn't finished yet? 

I'm going to have to assume that English isn't your primary language, because your train of thought doesn't seem to be working.

&gt;No, this is just ignorant. They get dialed back because they're trying to make the game work on a wide variety of hardware (the average PC gamer doesn't have a rig any more powerful than a console) and to iron out bugs. Why do you think the Witcher got downgraded? They're their own publisher after all.

Ok, perhaps language isn't the issue. You're just an idiot.

&gt;The years of delays have made this painfully obvious. This also means they're not beholden to competent planning.

There hasn't been years of delays because they haven't put out hard dates in years. If I tell you that I'm hoping to get something done by monday, and on monday I'm not done...that's not a delay.

It really didn't. They recorded the performance capture 3 weeks ago. The assets, of course take a while, but putting them together into a mission isn't very hard at all.

&gt;It's completely linear.

That's not true. They want these missions to be branching and modular. Each section is its own little element that can go one way or the other.

&gt; It's impossible for them to create enough missions at this level of detail to keep up with how fast people will do them.

Here's their [original](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/12978-Introducing-Your-RSI-Space-Suit) intentions for armor classes, though it's been updated since, the idea is still the same:

&gt;**Class I** – basic protection; essentially a plastic bag. Think a Tyvek suit. Class 1 suits protect against vacuum during a hull breach but they can’t be worn for EVAs. 


&gt;**Class II** – This is the “standard” suit for non-military pilots. Keeps you safe in the cockpit and is maneuverable enough in combat. Has limited EVA capabilities, although to do anything effective in zero G you need attachments that will slow it down. 


&gt;**Class III** – Heavier civilian suit. A little slower and less maneuverable than the class II, but has increased armor. You’ll have a harder time moving around in boarding, but you can take more hits. 


&gt;**Class IV** – Military suit, as seen in the Squadron 42 trailer. This suit is armored to protect against cockpit damage, has various self-repair features, advanced tactical display, etc. Roughly as effective in EVA as the Class II is in a boarding operation. 


&gt;**Class V** – Advanced Military Suit. This is a much more expensive and rarer class of suit. Think the difference between a standard fighter pilot suit and the ones worn by an SR-71 crew. 


&gt;**Class VI** – Marine armor. Too bulky to wear in a cockpit, but much  more effective in boarding operations. A pilot wearing a Class III suit might fly a cargo load of his friends in Class VI suits to attack a freighter. 


&gt;**Class VII** – Heavy Marine Armor. This is a heavy weapons suit with mech upgrade for carrying heavy weapons. 


&gt;**Class VIII** –Full blown EVA suit, similar to a modern space suit with an MMU. 


&gt;**Class IX** – Full blown mech suit. Somewhere between a space suit and the power loader from Alien. These repair the outsides of large ships, move heavy objects in hangars, etc. ",2016-08-20 22:19:10+00:00,d6pvmc8,2.0,t1_d6pm91j,15156.0,Games

First off, since when is a 1 day warning on fucking twitter long enough for everyone to cancel their preorders? You do realize that not everyone uses twitter, let alone staying ontop of it.

&gt;both playstation store and steam have always said very clearly single player, so yes if you bought a single player game specifically for multiplayer content

And his assertion (multiple times) was always that it wasn't likely you'd see other people, but it could be done. So consumers would understand why it couldn't be labeled as a multiplayer game, but that it was still a thing.

That doesn't matter. It's their measuring point that they're building the game's economy around. It's not something that would just go out of date. 

&gt;It is also worth noting that it may be more expensive in game to upgrade you ship to the best components then the cost of the base ship.

Yeah, I definitely don't agree with that. You can see it's up to around his neck from 10:59-11:09. 

&gt;Bigger question is why first person view suddenly makes things waist high appear neck high.

The game doesn't have some magic [chest high camera with arms](http://www.ambiera.com/coppercube/doc/images/tut_egoshooter9.jpg) for first person view like almost every other FPS out there. The model used for the worldview is the same as the playermodel. The camera is located in the playermodel's eyes. 

This is why they've had so much trouble with player animations and headbob.

&gt;but would the captain have any kind of direct control over turreted weapons?

I'm only guessing, but I would assume that if you marked specific targets as high priority, they'd shoot at them first. But really, we don't know how that'll work.

To sum up though, the game isn't designed to be played the way you're talking, but you should be able to get close enough to what you want if you really tried.

1752,"&gt; So, judging by content so far and promises from the developers, does this game have any hope of being a proper successor of X3 in terms of providing a singleplayer sandbox space sim experience where you basically start off as small fry but gradually earn enough money to acquire and pilot humongous capital ships, own networks of stations, and command entire fleets?

Mostly yes...sort of. They will release the ability to have a private server that you can play in yourself after the initial release of the MMO. It will be a bit more limited than the MMO though. 

Organizations will be able to own static space stations, but I don't think you'll be able to own a network of them.

And you'll be able to command capital ships with NPC escorts, but I doubt you can do a fleet if you're playing just by yourself.

&gt;I know that there's Squadron 42 however I'm not sure if it will be like X3 or a more focused story-driven experience 

Correct. Squadron 42 is a branching story line where you're in the military. So there won't be any running off to do your own thing. There will be open ended missions where you can do things different ways, but only in the context of military missions.

1928,"&gt;Well, they did shoot him. What you're describing is exactly what they did.

I know. Big thumbs up from me.

&gt;But they also arrested him in 2014 under suspicion that he was radicalizing. What I'm saying is back then they could have sent him to therapy or counseling (which they had planned on doing). Instead, they gave him peace bond, which basically meant as long as he agreed to not go on the internet / social media, he'd be free to go.

I wouldn't waste a dollar on a person whose beliefs lead them to wanting to murder innocent civilians. 

&gt; In the thread, there was a post that said that many suicide bombers had their hands tied, and they were detonated remotely.

Those aren't terrorists. They're victims(usually). 

&gt;Nothing is so cut and dry. First of all, there is more than one type if Islamist terrorist, with very different motivations 

The primary motivation of any islamic suicide bomber is getting into heaven. 

&gt;The same thread also talks about how many rural people thought the American soldiers were actually Russians. It may be the case in Syria and Iraq too.

Not really relevant to the point. And it's not the same in Syria and Iraq as it is in Afghanistan. The reason it happens in Afghanistan is because the Russians were there for 10 years. They're the reason the country went to shit. There's very little infrastructure in the country, which means people out in the boonies don't get news.

This doesn't even make sense. What does a free beta have to do with anything? Most AAA games don't offer free betas. The success of a game has **nothing** to do with whether or not there is free access to its beta.

&gt;Wanna play Star Citizen now? oh go ahead and spend $150+ for a ship and get free access!

First off, it costs $45 for the full game. That gives you access to the entire MMO and all the ships. If you want, you can spend $15 more to get the massive single player campaign. 

That's it. And they never claimed you get free access either.

&gt;Once the game releases, I highly doubt they'll go Free to Play like they originally claimed.

They've never once claimed they would go free to play. The game has **always** been buy to play.

Ship variety is one of the main facets that will give this game longevity. They cost anywhere between $35k - $150k. The amount they get back **dwarfs** those numbers. I don't see how you can consider this a massive overhead, when the return on their investment is huge.

That's a terrible development method. How many successful games do you know of that were released bare bones and finally added the bulk of their features years later? First impressions are everything. 

Elite Dangerous is a perfect example. They released a bare-bones game with promises of adding features as the years go by. People were burned out from that game after 30-40 hours of play.

And you should know, if you backed the game, that they asked the community if they wanted to continue with the stretch goals and they **overwhelmingly** said yes.

2100,"&gt;I take your point, but there must be options, by which I don't mean other ISPs necessarily. For example, an Elon Musk or Warren Buffet would have the wherewithal to start up a nationwide company, and the smarts to make it successful.

It's insanely expensive to build a new network from scratch though. Verizon tried doing 100% coverage of just New Jersey and hit $13 billion before wanting to give up.

The US is a massive country and I don't think many foreigners realize this.

&gt;Also, I have a suspicion that both companies contravene antitrust laws. A smart lawyer could write up a petition to that effect, and I'm sure there are enough disgruntled customers from both to get it into Congress, and with a bit of media spin make it impossible to be ignored.

It's been going back and forth. The cable industry is roughly around $100 billion right now IIRC. They also spend a shit ton on lobbying the government. Basically, they have lots of laws and people in power in their pockets.

Some towns have tried the municipal networks, only to have the cable companies complain that [they're illegal.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/02/03/cable-companies-want-to-block-cities-from-building-fiber-networks-heres-how-the-fcc-could-intervene/).  Basically, they've got us by the balls. 

Our knight in shining armor right now is Google, who is pushing out low cost fiber networks across the country. It's already making [cable companies panic](http://www.businessinsider.com/google-fiber-is-succeeding-and-cable-companies-are-starting-to-feel-the-pressure-2015-4). 

&gt;Besides, if I had my way, we'd have solar panels and Tesla batteries and fuck off the power company. :)

I think we all would. But that's a perfect example, isn't it? You'll likely spend $25k just to get the solar panels and the batteries. It's that upfront cost that scares people away.

And even so, we still gave a shit ton of aid to the Soviets anyways through [Lend Lease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lend-Lease#US_deliveries_to_the_USSR).

&gt;In total, the U.S. deliveries through Lend-Lease amounted to $11 billion in materials(~$186 billion in today's money): over 400,000 jeeps and trucks; 12,000 armored vehicles (including 7,000 tanks, about 1,386 of which were M3 Lees and 4,102 M4 Shermans); 11,400 aircraft (4,719 of which were Bell P-39 Airacobras) and 1.75 million tons of food.  


&gt;Roughly 17.5 million tons of military equipment, vehicles, industrial supplies, and food were shipped from the Western Hemisphere to the USSR, 94% coming from the US. For comparison, a total of 22 million tons landed in Europe to supply American forces from January 1942 to May 1945. It has been estimated that American deliveries to the USSR through the Persian Corridor alone were sufficient, by US Army standards, to maintain sixty combat divisions in the line.  


&gt;The United States gave to the Soviet Union from October 1, 1941 to May 31, 1945 the following: 427,284 trucks, 13,303 combat vehicles, 35,170 motorcycles, 2,328 ordnance service vehicles, 2,670,371 tons of petroleum products (gasoline and oil) or 57.8 percent of the High-octane aviation fuel, 4,478,116 tons of foodstuffs (canned meats, sugar, flour, salt, etc.), 1,911 steam locomotives, 66 Diesel locomotives, 9,920 flat cars, 1,000 dump cars, 120 tank cars, and 35 heavy machinery cars. Provided ordnance goods (ammunition, artillery shells, mines, assorted explosives) amounted to 53 percent of total domestic production. One item typical of many was a tire plant that was lifted bodily from the Ford Company's River Rouge Plant and transferred to the USSR. The 1947 money value of the supplies and services amounted to about eleven billion dollars.

But yeah, the US didn't lift a finger to help....sure guy.

Funny thing about gas. It goes everywhere. An average person can throw a grenade 115 feet. A grenade launcher has an effective range of 500 feet, and a max range of 1300 feet.

Of all firearm deaths, [~61% are from suicide](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/05/24/suicides-account-for-most-gun-deaths/). ~35% are homicide, with a percentage being justifiable. Of all those homicides, ~60%-70% are [gang related.](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6103a2.htm) So unless you're in a gang, you have very little to worry about.

* Blunt Objects
* Hands/Feet
* Knives
* Car accidents
* Choking
* Falling out of bed
* Staircases

FPCON Delta is normally declared as a localized warning. The installation moves to a high state of alert, and mandatory security measures are implemented.

&gt;“Within weeks of the leaks, terrorist organizations around the world were already starting to modify their actions in light of what Snowden disclosed. Communications sources dried up, tactics were changed,” Morell writes. Among the most damaging leaks, he adds, was one that described a program that collects foreigners’ emails as they move through equipment in the United States.
Terrorist groups, including ISIS, have since shifted their communications to more “secure” platforms, are using encryption, or “are avoiding electronic communications altogether.”

Yes. This was originally the largest ship in the game. That changed when the scope increased early on. Currently the largest Vanduul ship([The Kingship](https://i.imgur.com/u8cvAnE.png)) is larger. 

There is also one larger UEE Dreadnought Class ship([Retribution](http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1540/15406759/2872339-0478468992-acphZ.png)).

It's symbolic of one of the facets of the game that people are really excited about. Running operations of your own carrier.

&gt;If so, it exists as a proof of concept for larger systems, right?

All of the capital ships will have an assortment of ship systems. 

&gt;So what percentage of the total game-pie does this ship represent?

I have no idea really. If I had to guess(as a fan with no insider knowledge), I'd say 2%?

&gt;When a fighter shows off a new character, you know it's maybe 8-10% of the pie

I wouldn't say that. The ships take a lot of work, but there's a TON going on under the hood. I think that goes with any game though.

&gt;How close to being done is this ship?

That's not at all true. Comey even said, the reason they chose not to bring charges on the section on negligence is because of a lack of previous court cases dealing with it:

""*In looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. All the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts to obstruct justice. We do not see those things here.*""

They claim that they properly vetted their sources, yet they didn't even know that CIG doesn't use ID badges. That alone calls their entire vetting process. 

As for the other sources, it's obvious that there was [collusion going on](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/3n6lum/escapist_anonymous_sources_uncovered/). 

Disgruntled former employees do not make good sources, especially when they refuse to come forward. They make criminal claims against Chris Roberts and CIG, especially in the case embezzling funds. Now tell me, what company(bigger than a mom and pop) that you've worked for ever gave you access to their books?

3076,"Do some googling yourself. Look up the differences between semiconductor and fuel-cell sensors. You'll read basically this:

&gt;Although semiconductors have been around longer, and may be cheaper than fuel cell units, they are also less reliable. Semiconductor units do not only react to the presence of alcohol, but also to other substances like cigarette smoke, perfume, hairspray and breath fresheners. The presence of these substances can trigger a “false positive” reading and unduly lead to a false accusation of alcohol use. These units also don’t have a long life span, rarely lasting longer than one year; and they show a wide variation in readings, especially as the units become older or get more use. Lastly semiconductor units detect only the presence of alcohol but cannot quantitatively measure an accurate BAC level. For these reasons no semiconductor device has ever been approved for evidential use (to stand-up in a court of law) by any State Law Enforcement Agencies or the U.S. Department of Transportation. Although a few states, Washington, Colorado and Oregon for example, still allow semiconductor units to be used, this is generally due to the fact that their use was “grandfathered”. Some states, such as Texas and Wisconsin, have banned the use of semi-conductor interlocks due to their poor and inaccurate performance.

You're such a simpleton. Even your twisted logic is wrong. The number you quoted is for the cost of the ENTIRE Predator program. There are 360 MQ-1 Predators, and then you have R&amp;D. **Unit cost**(hint: that's the number you were looking for) is $4.03 million. They've been in service for over 20 years...so obviously they weren't built for ISIS.

But let's pretend they were! If you honestly think they'd create a whole new aircraft and make 360 of them for the sole purpose of killing a single guy...well there's no word for the level of retardation that line of thinking would require. 


So let's go back and correct your initial claim:

&gt;America spends billions just to kill one IS person 

America spent $2.4 billion for 360 aircraft that they've used for 20 years in tens of thousands of missions against targets all over the world.

&gt;""It's definitely in and Star Marine was originally our idea of how to get people to play the FPS before we could put everything together, but since that obviously took longer than we expected to get FPS to the level that we are comfortable with,"" Roberts said. ""By the time we got it to the level we said, 'Okay you guys can play this.' Well we already had all the other things combined with the large world and the 64-bit coordinates and the zone system so that was it. So there you are, we will have Gold Horizon, we will have Star Marine, but that will come online once all the basic FPS features are out in and live in the mini PU.""

http://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-citizen-creator-answers-10-fan-questions-abou/1100-6434168/

That is just one of a few times they have reinforced the fact that is not cancelled. Star Marine was there mainly as a minigame to test FPS mechanics, like Arena Commander was originally designed specifically to test dogfighting mechanics. It took them longer to get it out than anticipated though, and in that time they were able to fold in the majority of FPS mechanics they needed tested into the PU server. 

So it's been pushed to a back burner while they fast track Squadron 42. This is a development process, not a release process. They have to be able to adjust to the needs of the project on the fly.

&gt;Why did they get rid of the contractor who was making it?

They didn't get rid of them. They were contracted to get a portion of it finished. They got what they needed from them and completed the contract.

Your opinion. She absolutely knew the drug had performance enhancing qualities. So even when it wasn't banned, she knew she was breaking the spirit of the rules. 

**My opinion** is that cheaters should be dealt with harshly. It seems that the ITF agrees with me.

I mean hell, look at the description:

&gt;ArcCorp, Stanton III, is the most visually impressive of the worlds today. While the other planets, even polluted Hurston Dynamics, retain some indication of their natural origins, **ArcCorp is now nearly an entirely constructed world. Almost all of the terrain has been sculpted, zoned and built upon, leaving very little left for nature**. ArcCorp builds fusion engines in bulk for hundreds of thousands of civilian spacecraft every year. Traders porting at ArcCorp are advised that in addition to deals on these engines, they can find just about anything else here. ArcCorp is absolutely indiscriminate about who they lease property to, and hundreds of other smaller companies have made their home near the world’s north polar region. Anthropologists familiar with the Xi’An have posited that ArcCorp is the closest human equivalent to a Xi’An factory world, and many predict that our civilization will someday evolve along the same lines.

It's not a change. Since day one Roberts has stated that there will be no loading screens in the game once you initially load in. 

&gt;It's not though. The current map is around 0.006 AU in diameter. The Stanton System is close to 9 AU in diameter (from the starmap). That's not a small amount of growth and it is something that the engine and servers will eventually need to be able to deal with.

It would though. It would be taking the player from one server to the next seamlessly. This is an important backend system that they need to test. 
It also allows them to start testing the jump point mechanic.

&gt;I'm just interested to see that they are not completing the entire Stanton system before they move on to another.

Because that's simply adding assets. The sort of bugs that crop up with that are largely cosmetic and not as important as bugs that have to deal with game mechanics.

Holy shit, guy, do you work in Washington? I got a kink in my neck trying to read that spin.

&gt;The Rift is a partially closed platform

It's not a platform. It's a peripheral. PC is the platform.

4064,"&gt; Drones aren't really disruptive in how we conduct warfare. A guided missile launched from a plane blows up just as well as a guided missile launched from a sub.

Why would it matter if it's disruptive to the nation utilizing it? It absolutely is disruptive to those on the receiving end. And it's not just missiles, but the overwhelming amount of recon and a drone's ability to loiter for an insane amount of time (sometimes days).

&gt;Aircraft carriers groups are a good example of the US reacting to the previous wars requirements(WWII).

The idea of using Aircraft carriers as the center of a naval task force was developed by the US. It just wasn't used. The Japanese got the idea from our exercises.

&gt;the recent wars the US had to fought were not characterized by the need for massive mobile Naval support when most missions were either flown from local air bases or bombing runs from the other side of the globe.

Aircraft Carriers arent just there for combat. They project influence and prevent war. If a country knows that we can basically move a floating combat city right off their coast, then they'll think twice before starting a fight.

4067,"&gt;Mostly true yes

Completely true. War is a game of chess. You are constantly making moves and countering your opponents moves. You cannot prepare for everything.

&gt; But there are also plenty of examples of armies that changed the nature of warfare to great success and forced everyone to react to them. 

You mean like how the US first proposed using Aircraft Carriers as the center of a fleet? Or how we've pushed drone warfare which has totally changed every facet of warfare right now?

4070,"It will never be. You're not grasping what ""conventional warfare"" means. 

Right out of [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_warfare):
&gt;Conventional warfare is a form of warfare conducted by using conventional weapons and battlefield tactics between two or more states in open confrontation. The forces on each side are well-defined, and fight using weapons that primarily target the opponent's military. It is normally fought using conventional weapons, and not with chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons.
The general purpose of conventional warfare is to weaken or destroy the opponent's military, thereby negating its ability to engage in conventional warfare. In forcing capitulation, however, one or both sides may eventually resort to unconventional warfare tactics.

4098,"1. It's pretty overwhelming at first. But within 2 or 3 weeks you have a pretty solid understanding of all the basics so that you can find most of the answers on your own. Theres lots of reference material and walkthroughs in your CALO's knowledge base that are of immense help. You also will be working with Co-Ops who are much further along in their time there who will help you when needed. 

2. From my experience with my management team, they really did like to see that you were bettering yourself and taking the initiative to learn on your own. New certs are always good, as are side projects to help improve the work flow are a nice feather in your cap. 

3. Im still in school myself so I can't speak to this, though I would imagine it would. When you work in CALO, you get your hands on nearly every single Cisco business oriented networking device that's out in the wild. You'll be working on brand new gear, and stuff that's 30 years old. And with this, you're going to come across some of the craziest bugs and interactions that have to do with setting this gear up. You can't get that kind of experience anywhere else. You will become a master of ROMmon and Turbo Booting.

Overall, I loved my time there. My coworkers were great and so was the management. I learned more than I could have hoped for. I just wish I had worked on my CCNA stuff earlier. Study now!

4099,"&gt;  I heard that Cisco will pay for the tests for up to two attempts. Do they do it only if you pass? Also, how seriously do they take failures e.g. could failing a certification exam get you fired or not rehired? I also presume they don't care how badly you'd fail.

You can take pretty much any Cisco test you'd like if you already have R&amp;S. Otherwise you have to get R&amp;S done first. At least that's how it was explained to me. Your first attempt is free no matter what. Your second attempt is free **only** if you pass it. If you don't you have to pay for it. 

You still have to pay for the tests up front, and will be reimbursed. 

&gt;could failing a certification exam get you fired or not rehired? I also presume they don't care how badly you'd fail.

They really don't seem to care if you fail at it, but they DO expect you to get it at some point. If you are dragging your feet, they will mention something. They want to see that you're improving and keeping at it. That's the important thing. 

&gt;I heard that some people work at CALO without even a CCENT. 

Yes. I got into CALO with only a Networking 1 class for Cisco experience.

&gt; Would just having a CCNA and experience at CALO, be enough to get you into TAC?

Absolutely. I've seen people get into TAC without a CCNA as long as they have the experience to back it up. You ARE expected to get your CCNA as soon as possible though, from my understanding.",2016-05-14 07:30:04+00:00,d351okh,3.0,t1_d34yvdl,8727.0,Cisco

Humanitarian missions are done in groups, with full contact of all belligerents in a war. They weren't part of a group. This is entirely irrelevant.

There aren't ""countless reasons"" to go to a warzone. It's not like they were going to Walmart.

4306,"I've tried a layered alarm approach and it seems to work. It's a bit more of a headache to stay ontop of, but it works for me at least.

My first alarm is through the android app [Sleep Cycle](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.northcube.sleepcycle&amp;hl=en). I put some sound of birds chirping that is set to fade in. The way that app works, is it determines the [best time](http://www.sleepcycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/sleepcycle_irregular_sleep.png) to wake you up within the stage of your sleep where you are the most wakeful. This makes it so when you wake up, you're less likely to be tired.

At the same time, I have the [HF3520 Phillips Wake Up Light](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0093162RM). This provides a natural looking artificial sunrise to go along with it. It's expensive, but worth it.

After that, I usually have 3 or 4 more alarms go off within 2 minutes of each other. First of these is a pretty gentle alarm. The rest are a louder sound.

Then the last alarm I have is the most loud and obnoxious one I could find. This way, you know when you hear it that there are no more alarms coming after, and that you *have* to get up. You could use your bed shaker alarm to work in conjunction with this. 

So the whole idea of this, is to pull you gently out of your sleep, and then hammer you with alarms once you're more conscious.

After waking up, the Blue-Light box is nice . It's almost like having a cup of coffee. I admit I don't use it all that often anymore though, just because it means I have to wake up earlier. The one I picked up, though, was the [Philips goLITE BLU
](http://www.amazon.com/Philips-GoLITE-Energy-Light-Rechargeable/dp/B00M3SGD4Y/ref=sr_1_2_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1462121904&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=phillips+golight), which was the previous model of this one I linked. I realize I sound like I work at Philips now, but oh well. It was nice because it's portable, insanely bright, and holds a good charge. 

Also a note, that android App, Sleep Cycle, also has some built in sleep sounds that automatically turn off when it determines you have fallen asleep. It also tracks your sleep cycles. Along with that, the Philips Wake Up Light has a sundown mode. Basically, you tell it to start 30 minutes(adjustable) before you want to go to bed, and it simulates a sunset. This helps to naturally get you ready to sleep.

Something else you could try, I recently saw this alarm clock that actually shocks you awake. Supposedly it works real well. It's called the [Pavlok](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/shock-clock-wakeup-trainer-never-hit-snooze-again--2#/story) and it's currently in Indigogo. I also found these [Gauss glasses](http://www.digitaltrends.com/wearables/gauss-glasses-hands-on/) which filter blue light wavelengths. Haven't tried them yet, though.

Lastly, check things that emit light in your room. The little light on your TV, your router, charging lights, etc. As a computer geek, I've got like 20 of these things blinking away when I shut the lights off. Supposedly, they [mess with your body's circadian rhythm](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/q-a-why-is-blue-light-before-bedtime-bad-for-sleep/). So turn those off when you can, or cover them with electrical tape when you can't. Use apps like [Twilight](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.lux&amp;hl=en) for your phone, and [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) for your PC to cut back on blue light as much as possible if you have to use [these devices before bed.](http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/does-blue-light-ruin-sleep-we-ask-an-expert/) 

Sorry for the long-winded post. And I know this sounds way overkill. But it works for me as long as I stay ontop of it.

&gt;international law permits states to kill civilians — as long as those killings are proportionate to the anticipated military advantages. An intentional shooting of one civilian is a war crime, yet an airstrike that accidentally kills a much larger number of civilians can be permitted if the military decides their deaths are proportionate. That leaves a lot of power in the hands of military decision-makers. If they decide a target is important enough, they can justify a tremendous amount of civilian death and suffering.  

&gt;Second, international law can enable “plausible deniability” — intentionally aiming at civilians, but claiming that their deaths are accidental. It can be hard to determine whether military decision-makers intend to kill civilians.

&gt;Eleven minutes into the airstrike, Doctors Without Borders succeeded in reaching several United States government officials to alert them of the attack. But the strike was not called off until 19 minutes later, the military report said.
The top officer of the military’s Central Command, General Votel, said Friday that the notification had to pass through “a series of layers” to get to military officials on the ground and that when it did reach the Special Forces commander, he did not immediately stop the airstrike. “The ground force commander was not tracking a medical facility, so when he first heard it, it didn’t register,” Mr. Votel said.

4376,"
&gt;From my experience (and some speculation, since circumstances are unique), the situation likely happened accidentally, but negligently.  
&gt;
* The ground troops may have either misidentified the correct building/coordinates or used poor radio procedure when making the call for fire. This could be due to equipment malfunctioning, insufficient training, or just bad luck. I don't think this is the likely situation, though.  
* The crew of the AC-130 may have inaccurately identified the building, failed to adequately verify the coordinates, or failed to use mission resources to prevent the incorrect fire mission from happening. In my opinion, this is the likely situation.


""*Last November, the U.S. military said the crew of the AC-130, which is armed with side-firing cannons and guns, had been dispatched to hit a Taliban command center in a different building, 450 yards away from the hospital. However, hampered by problems with their targeting sensors, the crew relied on a physical description that led them to begin firing at the hospital even though they saw no hostile activity there.*""",2016-04-29 05:45:38+00:00,d2lrl0l,2.0,t1_d2lqglz,2737.0,worldnews

No...not true. They reported what they saw. Their command gave them the go to fire using what was reported only.

Sure there has. More than a few times in fact. They've stated that they're not going to touch VR until the launch of the game is imminent for a couple reasons.   
For one, there's only a small subset of backers who actually have VR headsets. It doesn't make sense to get something working for such a small group of people when there are core gameplay elements that need finishing first.  

Secondly, any changes they make to the game at this point would continue to break any VR implementation they would have added. There's no point constantly fighting to redo work.

Lastly, Crytek is coding in native support for VR into the engine. So why bother doing the work when Crytek is already doing it? Work smarter, not harder.",2016-04-24 15:06:54+00:00,d2fe2vh,4.0,t1_d2exp4f,46134.0,videos

Star Citizen has the camera in the head as opposed to the chest, like most FPS games. Other games don't do this because it allows them to have a stable view while moving. CIG has to compensate for that headbob. ",2016-04-17 23:16:29+00:00,d26v5pb,,t1_czy8z9d,,gaming
4609,"It had nothing to do with balance. 

Almost all multiplayer FPS games use two models for players, weapons, and equipment. The first person player model(viewmodel) *usually* just consists of [arms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dhK1UGzbUU. Viewmodels are very high-def with intricate animations, as that is what the player sees of themselves. This is why in most games before VR became a thing, you couldn't even seen your body when you looked down.  
 The problem is, the camera is centered in the chest to allow for a smooth movement experience. This causes some [weird looking issues](http://i.imgur.com/7vraE1O.gif) when looking at them from the third person. 

Conversely, third-person models (world models) are lower resolution and have [very basic animations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNwxJlzhNo8). 

CIG wanted to combine the two for a few reasons:

* Because it increases the level of fidelity players experience to an insane level. 
* It allows a player to walk up to walk up and see exactly what a player is seeing on their [mobiglass](http://i.imgur.com/L3iGiN2.jpg?fb) or radar. * Animations are much [higher quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFfH-fu5Xsg). 
* They don't have to do two of everything(animations/models). So they can put that extra work into a single set of animations and models. 
* You can see exactly where another player is looking
* Prevents the bug many FPS's deal with where an enemy is able to shoot you while seemingly reloading. 
* Adds to your presence in game with virtual reality.

But, it also adds a lot of issues. You can't put the [camera in the chest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXmZX8iz2SE) like usual because it makes your movement look all sorts of wrong. When you put the camera in the head, however, it causes other issues. Animations become much more difficult to pull off because our FOV and how we see in real life is much different than how we see in a game on a monitor. It also means that headbob becomes an issue. Your body naturally compensates for headbob when walking using a method called [vestibular ocular reflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibulo%E2%80%93ocular_reflex). They're starting to implement a similar system into Star Citizen bit by bit. 

So yeah, this is why the camera is attached to the eyes. And having it unlocked during animations is not something that's going to give any sort of advantage to a player. These animations are when players are in pretty vulnerable positions as is (eg getting in a ship, laying down, dancing). All it will allow them to do is get a better view of themselves dying.

If you'd like, you can pay the extra $15 for the single player companion game called Squadron 42 which will have 20-50 hours of gameplay with a Hollywood cast.

&gt;""Pre-rendering is the process in which video footage is **not rendered in real-time** by the hardware that is outputting or playing back the video""

Did you read the rest of it? 

&gt;The term is generally not used to refer to video captures of real-time rendered graphics despite the fact that video is technically pre-rendered by its nature.

You're trying to suggest that any video of any game ever made is ""pre-rendered"".

&gt;The high-fidelity assets and environments used in the scenes aren't available to the public.

They're not high-fidelity assets. They're standard assets. And the only reason some of them aren't available, is because the final game hasn't been released yet.

&gt;The scenes cannot be rendered on public computers, without the assets and environments - see 5.
Many scenes are not representative of current or past gameplay, as assets and environments are not available.
This chain's initial topic was ""misleading pre-rendered cinematics are always misleading"" - see 7

None of these things have anything to do with whether or not the videos are pre-rendered. You seem to be incapable of grasping a simple concept.

Ok, I think we need to go over some important terms for you.

1. In Engine - Recorded using the game's actual engine using in game assets. Can be capable of doing things you can't do in game.
2. In Game - Recorded in an actual gameplay environment. Something a player could see. 
3. Real time - Recorded real time. Shows how a game's engine realistically performs and what performance a player can expect.
4. Pre-rendered - Recorded over an extremely long period of time. Each frame takes a computer minutes to record. This gives the video super high level of polish, but is entirely impossible to achieve by a player.

Elite wanted a massive game, with little starting content.

The only time(generally speaking) that this works, is when you give players a solid framework to create within. It's like giving a chef an entire market full of ingredients, as opposed to giving him ketchup and bologna.

4741,"&gt;Players and organizations who amass enough wealth can take control of individual production nodes and begin building an industrial empire. The most aggressive entrepreneurs may take over whole sections of a supply chain and begin producing their own goods for sale on the open market – if they can keep the resources flowing. But be warned – some large corporations don’t appreciate competition!

&gt;While you are running your mine, refinery, or factory, you will be interested in more than just the raw materials that it needs! If your production node slows down because it doesn’t have enough workers, or their morale is low, you will need to help support the local population node or make sure that there are enough entertainment nodes to keep your workers happy and productive.

But if you think that support wasn't immensely valuable to the creation of Oculus, you're fooling yourself. ",2016-04-06 06:42:36+00:00,d1rud7j,10.0,t1_d1ru6fr,551.0,oculus

&gt;**""Cameras are limited by their resolution, and lose precision the farther away from them you go. Lighthouse doesn't have this problem. This means a shorter tracking range than Lighthouse.""**  
This is the same for Lighthouse. You need to add more stations for really large spaces.

Constellation can only see 18 feet, and in reality has a lot of tracking issues at the maximum range. Lighthouse is rated for 20 feet, but can see [27+ feet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VD4UlShicgY).

&gt;Constellation is scalable. You can actually use two cameras right now, even when touch is not out yet.

... That's not what scalable means. We already know Constellation has two cameras. But it can't increase past that amount. On the other side of things, Lighthouse has **no potential limit** to how many can be added. 

&gt;Chaperone has nothing to do with Constellation. Chaperone is software that has nothing to do with tracking technology. In fact, Valve already said Rift will support Chaperone when touch controllers are out.

And yet, right now, it has no chaperone system, only a future promise of one. Touch isn't even scheduled to drop until the end of the year, so that's ~8 months of no solution.   
Not to mention the lack of a passthrough camera to allow the player to interact with the real world when needed without having to remove the HMD. 

&gt;Stop spreading misinformation. That doesn't make you look smart.

Might want to know your facts before you call people out. That ""*doesn't make you look smart*.""

* Its cable length is only 4 meters (Vive has 5.5 meters usable of 6 meters of cabling)
* It doesn't use a breakout box, which means if you walk too far, say goodbye to the USB/HDMI ports on your PC
* The camera cable lengths are only 2.3 meters(Lighthouse, on the other hand, doesn't need to be connected to PC, and only needs to connect to each other in special situations)
* The tracking angle of the Constellation is only 100°H x 70°W (Lighthouse is 120° H x 120°W). This is a [massive difference](https://i.imgur.com/MBjQ0FK.jpg)  
* Constellation is an active device, meaning that it's going to take up CPU cycles. * Lighthouse is a dumb device, and uses very little bandwidth.
* Cameras are limited by their resolution, and lose precision the farther away from them you go. Lighthouse doesn't have this problem. This means a shorter tracking range than Lighthouse.
* Constellation isn't scalable, Lighthouse is.
* Constellation has [NO chaperone](http://imgur.com/AP4Bnh2)  system. Have fun walking around your room and into walls.

Geezus dude, if you're going to quote me, try quoting what I *actually* said.

&gt;you get a greasy haze over your view with normal brightness

glare =/= greasy haze

**Edit:**  

Here's what I was talking about. 

&gt; In terms of image, HTC made the display brighter and improved the optics through something the company is calling ""Mura correction."" The company says Mura correction helps deliver a clearer and crisper image with no dirty window or linen-like quality.

5022,"I did some looking around to respond to a comment and came up with a list.

Let's look at why the Rift is not optimized for Roomscale operation.  

* Its cable length is only 4 meters (Vive has 5.5 meters usable of 6 meters of cabling)
* It doesn't use a breakout box, which means if you walk too far, say goodbye to the USB/HDMI ports on your PC
* The camera cable lengths are only 2.3 meters(Lighthouse, on the other hand, doesn't need to be connected to PC, and only needs to   connect to each other in special situations)
* The tracking angle of the Constellation is only 100°H x 70°W (Lighthouse is 120° H x 120°W). This is a [massive difference](https://i.imgur.com/MBjQ0FK.jpg)
* Constellation is an active device, meaning that it's going to take up CPU cycles. Lighthouse is a dumb device, and uses very little bandwidth.
* Cameras are limited by their resolution, and lose precision the farther away from them you go. Lighthouse doesn't have this problem. This means a shorter tracking range than Lighthouse.
* Constellation isn't scalable, Lighthouse is.
* Constellation has [NO chaperone](http://imgur.com/AP4Bnh2)  system. Have fun walking around your room and into walls.
* Constellation can't support more than one HMD.",2016-03-31 09:25:00+00:00,d1k8bzo,1.0,t3_4b7zuu,927670.0,Vive

There's [no problem](https://twitter.com/VRScout/status/699728619208179713) with sunlight. You just can't expose the lenses to sunlight because it can damage the screen, just like the Rift. Lighthouse [modulates](http://www.hizook.com/blog/2015/05/17/valves-lighthouse-tracking-system-may-be-big-news-robotics) the light to differentiate it from other light sources. 

&gt;You can mitigate the issue with reflections in most circumstances,

It hasn't been ""mitigated"". It's been fixed.

&gt;I have my doubts as to how many people are seriously going to drill holes in their walls to mount lighthouses, too.

It can be mounted with doublesided tape or speaker stands if needed.

&gt;Yes, they have said that, but that's currently not possible, nor have they demonstrated it. They can't be synchronized that way yet, unfortunately, and you are currently limited to two lighthouses as a result.

Well, they've stated on numerous occasions that this has been part of their plan since day one. The design of the Lighthouse system makes scaling them very simple. They're described as working like Cell Towers. Your sensors always know which lighthouses they're seeing, and when they start seeing new base stations, they switch playspaces.

But yeah, it's not an if, it's a when. This scalability is core to the function of their vision for SteamVR. 

&gt;The Camera is kind of shit, to be honest. It doesn't properly match your viewport, so your hand-eye coordination is useless. It's monoscopic. It has no depth-sensing capabilities, so it can't determine how far something is away from you, meaning it's useless if you're worried about changes in your environment 

The only thing I've seen people have issues with, is that the controllers show up slightly off from where the camera shows them. Calling the hand-eye coordination ""useless"" is disingenuous at best. People have [no practical issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npg3Zt-WILU) with [hand-eye coordination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnciEkUDnhs). Any objective outsider would call the Chaperone system a game changer, and they have. 

&gt;I wouldn't call someone implementing their own bounding system a 'hack'. It's no more a hack than the actual Chaperone system is in the first place.

It absolutely is a hack. They're modifying the system to work in a way that it wasn't originally intended. The Chaperone system, on the other hand, is core to the functionality of the system and utilizes dedicated hardware. ",2016-03-30 08:15:01+00:00,d1iu1sq,11.0,t1_d1hkbi0,71847.0,starcitizen

I have some larger ships. It doesn't bother me at all really, because I'm not expecting to be some special class of citizen. I funded the game because I loved the old Wing Commander games and I'm sick of Publishers. Not for special treatment.

And honestly, the way he keeps describing it, I think it's going to be some sort of specialized tutorial test you need to pass with probably a nominal in-game fee. Want to fly a Starfarer? Ok, well you need to prove that you can maneuver it through a space station docking procedure, collect fuel, refine it, and offload it. Stuff like that.

5159,"&gt; Already been tested and confirmed working with 10 foot passive extensions, resulting in a longer cable than the Vive even including breakout box.

Of course you can buy extra cables. But it's not part of the retail box. It's one more extra cost that users need to fork out.

&gt;this is also an issue that can occur even with the use of a breakout box unless it is tightly secured to a surface.

People that have used the Vive have stated that the breakout box lets the cables disconnect fairly easily. Regardless, it adds a measure of protection for your device. A simple cable tie would be more than enough to prevent any damage to the ports. 
Without a breakout box, however, something is going to give. Whether it's your Rift or your PC.

&gt;Also tested and confirmed working with extensions. This is less convenient than lighthouse, but only marginally so.

I wouldn't say that's a marginal inconvenience. It's that many more cables all over your room, and still without a mounting system.

&gt;There are also issues with the use of Lighthouse in places with direct sunlight or reflective surfaces. 

This was an issue with old software builds. It's not a problem at all anymore.

https://twitter.com/shen/status/713408943758958596

https://twitter.com/chetfaliszek/status/671867332470280192

&gt;What is this even supposed to mean? ...You are currently limited to two base stations for Lighthouse (you're supposed to be able to use more in the future after they deal with some sync issues, but that's not currently possible). Lighthouse can currently track an arbitrary number of HMDs (as long as line of sight is not broken) with relatively few lighthouses, is that what you mean?

Yes. With the Lighthouse system, you'll be able to connect multiple rooms together (or sections of one oddly shaped room) and move from one play space to the next. 

""*[Lighthouse was designed from day one to be scalable, you can in principle concatenate tracking volumes without limit like cell towers](https://twitter.com/vk2zay/status/573749831564324866)*.""

http://www.roadtovr.com/developer-pushes-valves-lighthouse-tracking-to-its-limits/

While it might be limited at launch, this isn't something that would need a hardware upgrade to get it working. And I can't imagine the base stations will be very expensive.

At the least, it could allow you to cover deadspots in your room.


&gt;Well, two things here. First, VDK1 style chaperone is incredibly simple. An hour in Unity/Unreal simple. Let's not pretend it's something special. 

A community made hack is still a hack. And having imaginary playspace boundaries is not the same thing as having a camera that can spot obstacles to the extent that you're able to even read text in the real world. This makes accessing your chair, keyboard, and controllers intuitive. This is something a hack can't give you.

5167,"&gt;So what you are saying is that everyone who gets a Rift will be too stupid to put their camera in a spot that will give a large tracking volume when they decide to do room-scale?

I never said that. But they don't have any sort of mounting system for placing them up high.  The guy who tested it had to use a step ladder and tape. The cables are also only 2.3 meters. That hardly gives you very much wiggle room on where to place the cameras. 

&gt;Cameras can't magically see behind themselves

Is that so? Perhaps if you weren't being deliberately(I hope) obtuse, you'd realize I was talking about the tracking angle, and not ""behind it"".

Let's look at why the Rift is not optimized for Roomscale operation.

* Its cable length is only 4 meters (Vive has 5.5 meters usable of 6 meters of cabling)
* It doesn't use a breakout box, which means if you walk too far, say goodbye to the USB/HDMI ports on your PC 
* The camera cable lengths are only 2.3 meters(Lighthouse, on the other hand, doesn't need to be connected to PC, and only needs to connect to each other in special situations)
* The tracking angle of the Constellation is only 100°H x 70°W (Lighthouse is 120° H x 120°W). This is a massive difference
* Constellation is an active device, meaning that it's going to take up CPU cycles. Lighthouse is a dumb device, and uses very little bandwidth.
* Cameras are limited by their resolution, and lose precision the farther away from them you go.  Lighthouse doesn't have this problem. This means a shorter tracking range than Lighthouse.
* Constellation isn't scalable, Lighthouse is. 
* Constellation has [NO chaperone](http://imgur.com/AP4Bnh2) system. Have fun walking around your room and into walls.


So, as I said, the Rift is not in the least bit optimized for Roomscale. It is a seated experience, and that's fine. Not for me though. ",2016-03-29 08:31:00+00:00,d1hgcaz,7.0,t1_d1hewkq,5155.0,starcitizen

This shows the inherent shortcomings of the camera based tracking system.  In a normal setup, you've got a fairly narrow cone of tracking. The same guy tried placing it in a corner up high, which helped a lot, but still left tracking deadspots.

5174,"&gt;The way I'm looking at is would I ever spend that much money on a Wii U?

Everyone who has tried it says that it's a game changer. It's nothing like the gimmick of motion control gaming. 

&gt; I hope it hits big and grows but I just don't see publishers forking over the money to developers to create AAA games for a system that is very niche.... And even then, at least with a Wii system you have the guarantee of 3 - 5 great games from Nintendo.

Yeah...and Vive has Valve behind it. They've put all their chips on Vive, and they're not a company known for making rushed decisions. They'll certainly have a bunch of first-party games, especially with their Portal IP.   

Plus all the major racing and flying games will likely get support because they don't have to change much. You immediately get  AAA content with a new twist.

And leaving everything open like they are, it will promote other companies from getting in on the action. 

Lastly, VR is an untouched frontier and perfect for the current Indie-wave that has been promoted by Steam. While big Publishers may be a bit slower to embracing VR, you have a lot of creative Indie Devs who are just chomping at the bit to think of new and interesting ways to utilize the system.

**Extrapolated Data:**

258,725,641 / 642,977,952 = 40.24% 

**Current Estimated Muslim Population** = 1.7 billion

[1.7 billion](http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/the-future-of-the-global-muslim-population/) * 40.24% = ~684,080,000

5379,"&gt;Your article explicitly says and explains that the view of ISIS is overwhelmingly negative.

Yeah...and I explicitly stated that the percentage comes to about 36%, which means that if you can do math, that 64% are anti-ISIS. This would constitute an ""overwhelming majority"", but that doesn't mean the minority is small, which is what I was demonstrating. 

&gt;It's also misrepresenting the situation. You literally just included people who said ""Don't know"" in a number you want to present as ""ISIS supporters"".

You put quotes around ""isis supporters"" and yet I never said that. Apparently, reading comprehension is not a strong suit of yours. Let's quote what I **actually** said.

&gt;While not a majority, there is a massive amount  that **either are pro ISIS or ""Don't Know""** what they think of ISIS.

Seems like I was pretty clear there.

&gt;This comes to about ~238,725,000 Muslims of the 608,723,000 in the nations that were polled. To extrapolate, that's about 666,694,868 of the World's Muslim population(36%) that **are not against ISIS.**

Also clear. I never said that number was all those who were for ISIS. But not being against a terrorist organization is a pretty telling bit of information. If you walk up to someone and ask them if they think al qaeda is a good group, and they say ""I'm not sure"", I'm going to be pretty damned suspicious of that person.

&gt;""Even more"" implying that they are large to begin with.

The numbers were going up by millions...I'll redo it later on and show you.

I don't agree with this at all. At least in BF, you don't pay much attention at all to the HUD in third-person except maybe a glance at the radar sometimes. Being able to spot the movement of enemy ships against the backdrop is easier when you're in third-person. 
It also allows for you to spot the direction of incoming enemy fire. 

&gt;just a heading crosshairs

You weren't proposing heading crosshairs. You were proposing crosshairs in third-person.

&gt;You could even make it a 5-second transition between First person and Third person, to make switching practically suicidal in combat

This is something I suggested a while back on a the RSI forums. Although I think a 3 second delay would be more than enough. But I also added that it should create a massive EM signature that can be detected regardless of whether or not you're in a radar shadow. 

This would prevent players from hiding behind asteroids, for instance, while continuing to have a perfect view via third-person. ",2016-03-22 22:46:19+00:00,d19r3ct,7.0,t1_d19qhix,907.0,starcitizen

Are you fucking serious? Iraq had the 5th largest military in the entire world at the time of the invasion. 4th largest during the Persian  Gulf War.

5593,"&gt;**Why do the space suits have to be so bulky and hard to work in? Why not develop a slimmer, more ergonomic suit?**  

&gt;The primary requirement that any spacesuit must meet is to provide a pressurized volume for its crewmember. Lots of spacesuit improvements have been investigated and implemented over the years, but many of the more obvious shortcomings are probably here to stay. While the existing design is indeed bulky, it is a reliable, proven design that accommodates a wide range of sizes of EVA crew. There have been lots of new designs investigated, but all of them are equally bulky. It is simply not possible to decrease the bulk and provide improved flexibility without REALLY increasing the cost of each suit. Improvements such as better gloves, thermal comfort enhancements, and better helmet lights continue to be implemented as they are developed and made available.

Unless you've got some *actual* numbers to back your claim up, this is just another baseless rant. 

&gt;Has anyone else lived next to military bases in America before? You got a bunch of undereducated aggressive and hypercharged grunts in those places. Seeing them getting into brawls even with each other was a regular occurrence 

Have you ever lived near a College? You do realize that around [50% of the military is 25 and under](http://www.businessinsider.com/us-military-demographics-2014-8?op=1), right?

Yeah..when they started making it. Large MMOs take 5+ years to make, with the better ones taking 6 and 7 years. Star Citizen has had 3 years and 3 months of development, with the entire first year consisting of trying to build the company up from just a handful of employees. All of this without knowing what their budget would be.

Contrast that with an established studio that doesn't need to worry about hiring or renting office space. They don't have to worry about not knowing what their budget is. From day one they are operating on every cylinder. 

&gt;Most other games announced this long ago are usually functionally complete

Uhhh, that's because games aren't announced until they're close to completion. 

&gt; but it's still basically in early alpha.

As is any game of this size and this little development time. And you're forgetting that the entire single player campaign is being developed in relative secret, by the largest studio of the entire company. That's their focus right now.

5708,"The last information (IIRC) they've put out says this: The largest ship that you can currently own, is the Javelin Class Destroyer. This means that anything larger than that, or alien, has to be gotten through other means.

For example, the Bengal Carrier will be like a super weapon, with 4 or 5 in the game. They will be derelicts or run by pirates. To get one, you need to be able to capture and repair it. Same goes for all the alien capital ships as well. Now mind you, this was the general idea and was said quite a while ago. It's probably much more refined as far as how they want to implement this. They'll also remain persistent, meaning you can be attacked while you sleep. 

&gt;how will you ever fill a ship with probably 50+ crew members? 

First off, the last word they said was that a portion of your crew will always be a standard NPC crew. So let's say the Idris Frigate has a crew of ~100. The majority of those would be NPCs walking around making the ship look nice. You'd only have to provide 10 people. And of those 10, you could hire extra npcs to fill those mission critical slots.

The larger ships may need 30 people to crew. They're definitely aimed at Organizations and the overhead every time you use one for a mission will be quite a bit. 

Now, keep in mind, this is my understanding of it all. I may have some minor details of it incorrect, but that's the gist of it.",2016-03-19 19:32:50+00:00,d15y6b7,3.0,t1_d15xlst,1014.0,pcmasterrace

&gt;Indecent assault and acts of indecency
25.18 Indecent assault covers sexual acts that do not constitute rape. Indecent assault is
an offence in all states.37 For example, in Victoria, a person commits indecent assault if
‘he or she assaults another person in indecent circumstances’;38 and in NSW the
offence applies where any person ‘assaults another person and … commits an act of
indecency on or in the presence of the other person’.39 To establish this offence there
must be an assault—actual or threatened—in addition to indecency. Some jurisdictions
also have offences for aggravated indecent assault.40
25.19 The territories have adopted a different approach. The ACT has an offence for
‘acts of indecency without consent’,41 which does not require an assault. Other
jurisdictions also proscribe acts of indecency,42 including in aggravated
circumstances.43 In the Northern Territory, instead of an offence of indecent assault,
the legislation increases the maximum penalty for assault where the victim is assaulted
in an indecent manner.44
25.20 Indecency is not defined in any of the legislative schemes. It is considered a
word of ‘ordinary meaning’ for the jury to assess in the circumstances of the case and
according to the standards of the day.

I wouldn't really worry about that. This isn't just a space ship like the shuttle. These are armored. They're meant to protect against all sorts of weaponry. Small arms shouldnt cause an issue. Even if they did, in a situation like this, defenders would likely use frangible ammo. Limited penetration and shrapnel.

&gt;Definitions of Terrorism in the U.S. Code

&gt;18 U.S.C. § 2331 defines ""international terrorism"" and ""domestic terrorism"" for purposes of Chapter 113B of the Code, entitled ""Terrorism”:

&gt;""International terrorism"" means activities with the following three characteristics:

&gt;* Involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state law;
* Appear to be intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and
* Occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S., or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum.*  

&gt;""Domestic terrorism"" means activities with the following three characteristics:

&gt;* **Involve acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state law**;
* Appear intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) **to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion**; or (iii) **to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination. or kidnapping**; and
* Occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S.  

https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/terrorism/terrorism-definition

Terrorism has to do with goals.  
If you blow up a tank in combat during a war, it's not terrorism. Your target is of legitimate military value and the benefit of knocking that target out is strategic. 

Blowing up a recruitment station serves no direct strategic value. It's primary goal is to cause fear, panic, and to push an agenda or religious/political belief. 

Any attack that has those primary goals is a terrorist attack. ",2016-03-15 17:54:55+00:00,d10v3ao,4.0,t1_d10k76h,16445.0,worldnews

Except for the fact that they've gone on record multiple times saying that this was the case. 

&gt;which is why the past three sales have been back-to-back.

Oh really? So you know this for a fact? You've gone and looked at their books? And by the way, they haven't been ""back to back"".

&gt;If SQ42 hits and doesn't provoke another round of investment, they're sunk. If it hits and they don't get traction from sale-priced product, they're sunk. If it hits and people hate it, they're sunk.

Again, none of this is true. They're fully funded with money set aside for server maintenance for a while after the game is released.  They don't owe any money to anyone. Every single dollar they make after release goes into profit.   

The overwhelming majority of the revenue does not go to devs in the Publisher funding model. This means they have to sell a LOT more copies to be considered a success. 

CIG, doesn't have that problem. 

Lastly, they've also gone on record to say that even if they had run out of money earlier, it wouldn't have been an issue. There are still angel investors lined up ready to back the game. Funding is not an issue.

&gt;I'm just going to point out that having a question answered by one of the many developers on the project over a year ago with his understanding at the time (when the Idris WAS the biggest ship that we had sold) does not make it an ""official"" position on what we will be doing. 

&gt;Unless it comes from me or through an official channel like a front page post it's just one of our dev's knowledge / opinion at the time. It's part of the downside of being so open. We could vet every post but then it would greatly reduce the amount of questions that could get answered and generally make the process slower and less informative as we would be forced to not answer any question that doesn't have an official position or final design on them - which would probably be the majority of the Ask the Dev questions. When you Ask a Dev, you're getting that Dev's answer to the best of his knowledge from his small view on a huge project (We have close to 300 people working on this game and keeping everyone informed and up to date on all aspects of the game is an impossible challenge) 

&gt;As you can see from the stretch goals we have promised that players can fly ships all the way up to a Bengal Carrier. The truth is that we haven't fully decided on what the largest ship that will be offered before launch in aid of funding Star Citizen to be a game more ambitious than any publisher has ever attempted. Right now we've decided after a LOT of requests and petitioning by the community that we'll seed a few Destroyers into the player mix.

&gt;The Javelin is a BIG ship (some 350m long), with a LOT more firepower than the Idris - and will require a decent player crew to run, so its really a ship for a group of players. It, like the Idris, offers different play options and since we want the PU to have player driven drama and conflict in addition to the NPC scenarios, getting some of these ships into the hands of a few organizations will enable more varied encounters between players (or players against NPCs). We want a mix of small single seater ships, medium sized ones with 2-4 crew members and bigger ones like the Idris and Javelin that could become the focal point of a bigger engagement.

&gt;As I've stated many times there will be no case that you can pledge for a ship before launch that you can't get in the PU. So if we're selling the Javelin now there will be opportunities to purchase one in the PU with UEC, capture one or perhaps get one as a reward for some huge accomplishment. But just like now the number will be limited as the production of big ships like this and the Idris is slow and the UEE doesn't decommission and sell its older capital ships that often.

&gt;I hope this clears things up for people.",2016-03-09 16:53:19+00:00,d0tiy0z,6.0,t1_d0tig1d,662.0,MMORPG

If you were in a place where every single dog you got near would attack you, don't you think you'd start being a little hesitant around dogs in general?

Civilians in Western Nations see their world as a nice safe place where their biggest worries are careers and when to have kids. 

When you go to a war zone, you're worried about much more primal things. Is that piece of garbage a bomb? Is there a metal wire hanging across the road to cut my head off? Does that guy have a suicide vest under his bulky jacket? Is that cement truck filled to the brim with artillery shells? Are my interpreters going to green-on-blue me? Every facet of your life concerns keeping you and your buddies alive.

So when you get home, you can't return your perspective of home as a safe place where all you worry about are inane things. It becomes a battlefield just like the actual battlefield back over ther. Perhaps it's a safer one, but that doesn't mean that you don't see threats everywhere.   

And now, you have to go through this place without your fellow soldiers/marines who you can count on being trained and loyal. You have to do it without your weapon and without support. You're alone in a warzone, so you're even that much more ""hyper-vigilant"". 

Most people (anecdotally) face these issues when they get home from a combat zone to a degree. And most of them get over it within a couple months. But others...it's pretty bad. Some even get worse.

6099,"Hah yeah, I'm trying to think of a way to create some decent visuals. It sounds more complicated than it is when it's all text.

I have real world turret experience, both in tanks and humvees. One of the most important things is being able to quickly communicate targets or anything of interest to your TC(truck./tank commander), as well as your other crewmembers. 

So with that in mind, gunners follow a few rules for calling out targets. Firstly, you use the clock system. Direction of travel is always 12 o'clock. This means that a gunner NEEDS to know his ""slice of the pie"" as we call it. So if my gun is pointing to the left of the vehicle, my slice would be 7-11 o'clock. This means straight ahead for me would actually be 9 o'clock. 

Gunners in bombers modify that system slightly by putting using ""high"" or ""low"" as modifiers. So, for example, a correct target ID would be ""Fighter, 10 o'clock high!"". Now, everyone can get a general idea of what the threat is and where it's coming from. It also keeps the com channels as clear as possible while relaying nothing but important information.

My idea is to take some of the thinking out of it for gunners. At the top of their screen, they'd have an indicator of where their turret was facing. You'd have something like in [BF4](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3DDYHViq9wk/maxresdefault.jpg) and other games, which gives you an azimuth for when you need to be exact. But right below and more prominently, it would tell you what clock direction you were facing, and whether it was high, low, or neither. 

This way even gunners with no idea what they're doing or how to call out targets, would easily be able to let their pilot know what was coming. ",2016-03-02 20:37:02+00:00,d0l5dav,3.0,t1_d0l1pf8,4721.0,starcitizen

You seem to be lacking sense, common or otherwise. The [legal definition](http://definitions.uslegal.com/d/deadly-weapon/)(you know, the only one that matters, your opinion not withstanding) says that it is a [deadly weapon](http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/felony-offense/assault-deadly-weapon-michigan). 

&gt;The skull is an incredible strong structure. 

The skull is. The brain isn't. Ever hear of swelling of the brain? Yah it's caused when your head is smashed and it doesn't require your skull to be broken at all. Most certainly deadly. 

&gt;he would have been rendered unable to use his ""deadly weapon"" if he had been tased or sprayed 

[Tasers don't always work](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3225919/Shocking-video-shows-shirtless-man-Maryland-McDonald-s-exhibiting-superhuman-strength-cops-SEVEN-minutes-arrest-using-pepper-spray-hits-truncheon-taser.html). And pepper-spray isn't gonna stop someone from beating the hell out of someone else while their adrenaline is going. 

&gt;by the police's superior numbers before he could even get in range with his broom.

A person can close 30 feet of distance and strike in the time it takes to draw a weapon and fire. And there were only two cops there. Hardly what I'd call superior numbers.  

&gt;Yet there are plenty of stories of police killing innocents with negligent gunfire.

Show me all these stories. And then show me the numbers so we can compare that to officer involved shootings and we'll see what the statistical probability of a civilian being mistakenly shot *actually* is. 

&gt;Again, let me restate that the gunfire in this case was needless and completely avoidable. You're also forgetting that it's not just what's behind the target, the rounds can and do change trajectory. 

In **your opinion**, which is based on almost no knowledge of what actually happened.  And the only time rounds change is after going through their target. And then, it's not a major change in direction. Police aren't shooting at a target and assuming the round will stay exactly within a man sized target area. They have a buffer around their target of what is a safe shot. 

&gt;Actually yes it does. That's exactly how it works. You clearly do not have a lot of experience with firearms

I've got a feeling that I have a helluva lot more experience with firearms than you do. Call of Duty doesn't count, by the way. 

&gt;You are sitting here trying to defend police shooting a kid with a ~~broom~~ blunt weapon

Police are trained in how to shoot at a target in such a way to mitigate the risk of civilians. They also understand that they have to be careful with what is behind their target.

&gt;It is not possible for Facebook to put ads in other people's games without permission

Sure it is. Ad-injection happens all the time. Restaurants do it with special targeted advertisements that they overlay their TVs with using third-party ad delivery devices. 

Facebook could easily put ads right on their OR launcher screen, and could just as easily have ads popup whenever a game hits a loading screen. It wouldn't be hard to do without even needing access to the software's code.

Not to mention the fact that you *know* they're going to monetize the hell out of your personalized metadata.

6334,"&gt;That's not to say that the Rift can't do Room Scale or the Vive can't do sit down, they can do both. However, the respective companies are pushing for different types of experience.

You're misunderstanding what I'm referring to. I don't mean games developed specifically for one or the other. I'm talking about non-vr flight sims and racing sims are uniquely  suited for VR because they are already a sitdown experience and don't require much modification to work. People who have tried them have all said that it feels natural. 

So while each headset might not have a lot of games specifically designed and ready to go, you can look at already released racing/sims that companies have made VR ready.  

&gt;Correct me if I'm wrong, but it's my understanding that Oculus's tracking system is a lot finer when trying to do more minute movements with the touch etc, whereas HTC's covers a substantially larger area but isn't as pinpoint accurate.

I wouldn't know. I've only tried the Rift DK1. I think we'll have to wait till we get a comparison review when they release.

&gt;A lot of people are also not taking into account Oculus's SDK, which is probably going to blow HTC's out of the water when it's finalised. Carmack is not someone to be underestimated

6335,"&gt; Your rebuttal is generic.

Uh...sure guy.

&gt;In context your comments make less sense as HTC knows the hardware, and the software. Smartphones are not new to them.

I don't mean that they wouldn't know their own phones, I mean they wouldn't know what hardware the users are installing the software on. It could be a Galaxy S6, it could be an HTC One, it Might be a Nexus. You can't control the user experience with something that graphically intensive on a device which is NOT designed for what its doing. It's jury-rigged. 

&gt;On top of that what I'm saying is this stuff already exists. You can get a free Google cardboard, put your phone in it, configure some software on your PC and game wired or wirelessly right now.

Yeah, and it's a gimmicky experience. It's like comparing a glued together go-kart with a sportscar. 

&gt;It's just not approachable to the general public. Baby steps is what I'm suggesting.

What do you think the last 35+ years have been? This isn't a technology that is going to naturally ease itself into daily use. It needs to be forced into the market, and the market needs to find uses for it.

Lastly, this is VR's babysteps. If it falters out of the gate, no one will touch the technology for years.

CIG has no Publisher, which means they can put [80%-85%](http://i.imgur.com/cbs3aHj.jpg) of their budget into development. 

&gt;Star Citizen is being built by a new team

This is the gaming industry. The overwhelming majority have worked at multiple studios. They're not new. 

&gt;on tech unfamiliar to those people,

You do know that CIG has a whole studio filled with former Crytek employees, including those who built the original engine...

&gt;Take into account that GTA V (only including the PS3 and Xbox 360) version cost around $130m,

Developing for multiple platforms adds a lot to the cost.

&gt;is being managed by someone who has never shipped a game of this scale

Chris Roberts put out two games in a row (WC3 and WC4)that were the biggest budgeted games ever created at the time.

&gt;Given these differences assume the Star Citizen team works at a much lower efficiency that the GTA team - they can probably do half what Rockstar North can do with the same money.

That's uh...that's quite the assumption. One with no evidence to support it.

Setting up a sting is not entrapment.

Abu-Rayyan does not dispute that in July 2015, he expressed enthusiasm via Twitter for extremely violent footage of a killing spree perpetrated by ISIS, writing that the images ""made my day,"" and re-posting the video.  
""Khalil feels horribly about this,"" his attorney said. ""It's awful material -- no question, but nothing in here rises to the level of probably cause for terrorism charges.""  
The FBI had been watching his social media activity since May 2015, because of what federal agents called ""increasingly violent threats he has made to others about committing acts of terror and martyrdom -- including brutal acts against police officers, churchgoers and others -- on behalf of the foreign terrorist organization Islamic State of Iraq and Levant.""

6498,"Chris Roberts had two types of Space Sims he was known for. The first type was the Cinematic branching single player story campaigns (eg Wing Commander 1,2,3, and Star Lancer). 
The second was the open-world game where you're a pilot just trying to find his way in the universe, with an overarching story(eg Wing Commander: Privateer and Freelancer). 

When he first pitched the project, the idea was to have two separate games in the same universe, with one in each of those categories. Squadron 42(and its sequels) is to be the Wing Commander equivalent. A fully featured single player branching campaign with 20-50 hours of gameplay and 70 missions. It's a completely independent experience from Star Citizen, as it takes place before the events of SC, while your player is serving in the military.

Star Citizen, on the other hand, is modeled after Privateer and Freelancer. It's open world style is perfect for an MMO, and it will allow for all sorts of mini stories to be salted throughout the universe. These can be added dynamically(for free) every couple weeks. 

The only way these two games are integrated, is that some of your decisions and whether or not you complete the single player game, is forwarded to your character in the MMO. Sort of how Bioware forwards your decisions in previous Mass Effect or Dragon Age games to the next game. 

&gt;MMO part will just take longer and ""unlock"" when its ready?

Basically, yeah, if you have both. Single player games tend to be able to be released much quicker, as you have less balancing issues and no netcode optimization to deal with, etc. Originally, Chris Roberts only anticipated getting $2-$3 million in crowdfunding. Along with outside investors, Squadron 42 was supposed to bring in much needed cash to help Star Citizen develop. Obviously, that's no longer a worry, but the release plan remains the same. It also allows for players to get something to play with while waiting for Star Citizen as well as getting into the hands of the fence-sitters out there. 

Squadron 42 is tentatively slated for sometime this year (likely towards the end IMO) and Star Citizen is tentatively slated for the end of next year. ",2016-02-16 01:08:21+00:00,d01c902,4.0,t1_d01behk,1365.0,gaming
6499,"&gt;Star citizen has a ""fps module"". 

The ""FPS Module"" aka Star Marine is something entirely different than the FPS mechanics we see right now. It was originally intended to serve two purposes.  
Firstly, it was supposed to be a test environment for the FPS mechanics. By having a specific module **just** for an FPS mini-game, you could do a  lot more balance testing than random PU encounters could achieve. 
Secondly, it was to serve as a game within a game once Star Citizen released. Along with Arena Commander, Star Marine is to be a game within the lore of SC that would allow players to have competitive matches in a virtual environment without risk of their characters dying. 

&gt;We dont know how they will integrate that. 

Yes, we do... We're playing it right now.

&gt;who like the eve universe but think evevonline is boring can finally interact with the universe 

Thing is, if it's anything like Dust 514, it only has **very limited** interactions with the EVE universe. It might as well be a separate game. And according to CCP, Dust is still the priority, while the other FPS seems to be on indefinite hold. CCP can't even do walking in stations, I don't see how they could possible integrate FPS combat into the game. The new one is just going to be another Dust. 

As for Star Citizen, the FPS is a core component to the core game. Not some tack on that happens to be in the same universe.

It had the release date changed very early on from 2014 to 2016(single player) and 2017(MMO). That's the only change and this was due to them getting a lot more funding than anticipated and increasing the scope of the game because of it.

It's literally just a [pair of arms](http://www.ambiera.com/coppercube/doc/images/tut_egoshooter9.jpg). There's tons of clipping and limbs bending in weird directions because the player has a locked viewpoint so it doesn't see the majority of what's happening.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzPS8GAy0Do

Each player model has different animations. The first person ones are very detailed so the player gets to enjoy what they're seeing. The third person animations are dumbed down just so you can see what the player is generally doing. They're not always synced though which is why you often get shot by players who were seemingly reloading like in [Battlefield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUopxiB8l9M).

Removing the separate models has lots of benefits for realism, but it's a headache to implement, because now any animations you have cause the player's view to move around. That's what they're taking so much time working on right now is a view dampening system to keep players from getting sick.

And since there is no skill progression like an RPG, your twitch skills are everything. If you're a good pilot, you can easily dispatch someone in a much more heavily armed ship just through talent alone. Battlefield 4 is a great example.

Subdivision 1.Reckless driving. (a) **A person who drives a motor vehicle while aware of and consciously disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the driving may result in harm to another or another's property is guilty of reckless driving. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that disregard of it constitutes a significant deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.**
(b) A person shall not race any vehicle upon any street or highway of this state.

(c) A person who violates paragraph (a) or (b) is guilty of a misdemeanor. A person who violates paragraph (a) or (b) and causes great bodily harm or death to another is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
(d) For purposes of this section, ""great bodily harm"" has the meaning given in section 609.02, subdivision 8.

Subd. 3.Application. (a) The provisions of this section apply, but are not limited in application, to any person who drives any vehicle in the manner prohibited by this section:
(1) upon the ice of any lake, stream, or river, including but not limited to the ice of any boundary water; or
(2) in a parking lot ordinarily used by or available to the public though not as a matter of right, and a driveway connecting the parking lot with a street or highway.
(b) This section does not apply to:
(1) an authorized emergency vehicle, when responding to an emergency call or when in pursuit of an actual or suspected violator;
(2) the emergency operation of any vehicle when avoiding imminent danger; or
(3) any raceway, racing facility, or other public event sanctioned by the appropriate governmental authority.
(c) Nothing in this section or section 609.035 or 609.04 shall limit the power of the state to prosecute or punish a person for conduct that constitutes any other crime under any other law of this state.

You *do* know that security walls can be built with all sorts of ways to make using a ladder more difficult? And it seems your shortsightedness has you thinking that a wall would be a single-faceted security solution.

A lot of people were worried about this, but honestly, even with the player caps as low as they are right now(24 players and 16 ships IIRC), the battles still seem epic. You're getting hit from all sides and there's always a target in view.

7062,"&gt;In nearly all MMORPGs, the development of the player's character is a primary goal. Nearly all MMORPGs feature a character progression system in which players earn experience points for their actions and use those points to reach character ""levels"", which makes them better at whatever they do.[8] Traditionally, combat with monsters and completing quests for non-player characters, either alone or in groups, are the primary ways to earn experience points. The accumulation of wealth (including combat-useful items) is also a way to progress in many MMORPGs, and again, this is traditionally best accomplished via combat. The cycle produced by these conditions, combat leading to new items allowing for more combat with no change in gameplay, is sometimes pejoratively referred to as the level treadmill, or ""grinding"". The role-playing game Progress Quest was created as a parody of this trend. Eve Online trains skills in real time rather than using experience points as a meter of progression.

7071,"For now, in the Baby PU, there are no consequences to death. In Arena Commander, there will never be consequences, as it's basically a video game within the game.

When the game launches this is how it will work:

Your character will have multiple lives. Every time you ""die"" you actually wake up in a hospital bed, more and more tore up every time. You might lose an eye, or an arm etc. But after a few deaths, your character dies permanently. When this happens, all your assets and most of your reputation passes on to your next of kin, who becomes your new character.

In regards to your ship, insurance is very important. This is paid for by an insignificant amount of ingame money that's used as a money sink. Most ships comes with some Hull insurance off the bat. There are three types of insurance:

1. Hull Insurance: Covers your base ship and any stock gear that comes with it.

2. Upgrades Insurance - Covers any aftermarket gear you upgrade your ship with.

3. Cargo insurance - Covers your cargo.

It takes a little time for your ship to come back, as it needs to be built using actual materials in game (which require NPCs to ship). The smaller your ship, the faster you get it. Also, if you use your insurance claims too often, it starts taking longer and longer to get your ship back. This helps prevent people from ramming/griefing.

Also, you will need more expensive insurance the deeper into lawless space you go, as normal companies don't cover you. You can fly without insurance of course, but if your ship is destroyed, it's gone.

7095,"Hah, you're full of shit. If you *actually* do teach linguistics, I feel terrible for your students.

&gt;The Celts were already resident in Britain when the Anglo-Saxons arrived, but there are few obvious traces of their language in English today. Some scholars have suggested that the Celtic tongue might have had an underlying influence on the grammatical development of English, particularly in some parts of the country, but this is highly speculative

-----

&gt;The history of the English language really started with the arrival of three Germanic tribes who invaded Britain during the 5th century AD. These tribes, the Angles, the Saxons and the Jutes, crossed the North Sea from what today is Denmark and northern Germany. At that time the inhabitants of Britain spoke a Celtic language. But most of the Celtic speakers were pushed west and north by the invaders - mainly into what is now Wales, Scotland and Ireland. The Angles came from ""Englaland"" [sic] and their language was called ""Englisc"" - from which the words ""England"" and ""English"" are derived.

---

&gt;As we have seen, our language did not simply spring into existence; it was brought from the Continent by Germanic tribes who had no form of writing and hence left no records. Philologists know that they must have spoken a dialect of a language that can be called West Germanic and that other dialects of this unknown language must have included the ancestors of such languages as German, Dutch, Low German, and Frisian.

7171,"A corvette is a type of warship. An 890 wouldn't qualify, because it's a luxury cruise liner. A Carrack wouldn't qualify because it's a lightly armed exploration ship.

From Wiki:

&gt;""A corvette is a small warship. It is traditionally the smallest class of vessel considered to be a proper (or ""rated"") warship. The warship class above the corvette is that of the frigate, while the class below was historically that of the sloop-of-war. The modern types of ship below a corvette are coastal patrol craft and fast attack craft. In modern terms, a corvette is typically between 500 tons and 2,000 tons although recent designs may approach 3,000 tons, which might instead be considered a small frigate.""

----

&gt;Modern navies began a trend in the late 20th and early 21st centuries towards smaller, more maneuverable surface capability. Corvettes have a displacement between 540 and 3,000 long tons (550 and 3,050 t) and measure 180–420 ft (55–128 m) in length. They are usually armed with medium- and small-caliber guns, surface-to-surface missiles, surface-to-air missiles, and antisubmarine weapons. Many can accommodate a small or medium antisubmarine warfare helicopter.",2016-01-23 15:04:53+00:00,cz8yd1b,5.0,t1_cz8xwg6,1114.0,starcitizen

7287,"&gt; Firstly, having a script and having it in a working game are two very different things. 

We get it. The game isn't out. That's what happens when a game is being developed. It doesn't change the **fact** that is has a finished storyline. Just because it's not released yet, doesn't mean the **storyline** doesn't exist.

&gt;Secondly, length of a script does not mean it is good or bad. But it does mean it is long

I don't recall anyone talking about whether it's good or bad. This is entirely irrelevant to your claim.

&gt;""Meanwhile, work on Star Marine proper continues. Some of the deeper features are taking a back seat this week we roll out the basic movement and gunplay that will be available to all players on the Crusader map. This allows us to focus our attention on making the time players are outside their ships a good experience. What’s not included in Star Citizen Alpha 2.0? Game systems such as the score screen and Star Marine lobby UI, as well as some gameplay engineering and design work that is needed for Headquarters game mode. Have no fear, though, for Star Marine will return and your appetite for first person combat will be whetted by the action on Bravo station in the Crusader map. We will continue developing features and gameplay modes that are ultimately for use within Star Citizen, and we will continue to use Arena Commander and the Star Marine modes as a test bed for them. For now, and into the future, the FPS experience will be an integral part of Star Citizen Alpha, and we can’t be more happy about that!""

This is exactly the opposite of the reality of the matter. They have no debt because of crowdfunding. Every single dollar they make after release goes into profit. So even if they make a seemingly modest amount, it would equate to a whole lot more money because they're not beholden to a publisher.

Chris Roberts is on record multiple times saying that even if they didn't make a dollar, he'd be ok with it.

The StarEngine will already have really in-depth flight mechanics built into the system, whereas vanilla CryEngine has pretty rudimentary flight systems built in. Basically, the hard stuff should be already done. All the mod-makers would need is models, audio, GUI/HUDs, and story. 

&gt;Don't get me wrong though, providing the mod tools are there a star citizen conversion would be amazing. But we'll be waiting a long time for that.

That remains to be seen. Plenty of people have experience working on CryEngine. And one of the things CIG has promised is a full mod tools suite and manual for mod making in StarEngine.

7613,"&gt;In the name of Islam? Why did you feel the need to add that bit?

Because... Terrorism requires a cause. If a bunch of muslims took over a building because they were robbing the place, that's not terrorism. That's armed robbery.

&gt;This is the theoretical: everything is the same, except they are brown, with beards, and Muslim 

Since when does Muslim == brown? It's a religion, not a race.

&gt;It'd be different. You are even arguing it would be different, so you agree with me.

You're claiming that the consequences would be different due to profiling. I'm arguing that the results would be different because Muslims taking over buildings with weapons is a statistic certainty to end with people getting killed due to the actions of said muslims.

&gt;So the question is, should it be different? Remember, everything the same, except demographic.

7713,"&gt;Here's the thing. The ""corrupting blood"" virus in wow was fun because it was novel. But after an hour or so, it got old and just prevented people from playing.

That's the whole point of the Digital DNA though. It keeps stuff like corrupted blood from happening, because it doesn't affect everyone. The virus would be operating under a strict rule-set. 

&gt;Also, that is a lot of dev time for this idea. Not sure how much you think it takes up, but UI, design, programming, QA, art, sound, even for a small feature like this is a lot of man months.

7936,"&gt;Tecnically it is, it expands the story.

No...no it's not. Not technically or otherwise. 

&gt;Regardless, the point is that it was originally claimed that $45 covered the whole kaboosh, but that's not the case. 

They claimed that $45 would cover the single player (Squadron 42) and the multiplayer (Star Citizen). It does exactly that. The last thing in regards to Squadron 42 specifically that was promised in the stretch goals said this:

 &gt;Squadron 42 will feature celebrity voice-acting including at least one favorite from Wing Commander and 50 total missions.

Squadron 42 currently has 70 missions. 20 more than they promised. They're calling it ""Episode 1"" but that's just so people understand that it has a larger overarching storyline. This is comparable to going from Wing Commander 3 to Wing Commander 4. 
It will, however, have a smaller story that comes to a conclusion at the end of Episode 1. 

They always planned on expanding on the story, as referenced here:

&gt;The first Squadron 42 mission disk, Behind Enemy Lines, will be available for free to all backers who pledge before $6 million upon release.

8050,"&gt;Jet fuel burns at 800° to 1500°F, not hot enough to melt steel (2750°F). However, experts agree that for the towers to collapse, their steel frames didn't need to melt, they just had to lose some of their structural strength—and that required exposure to much less heat. ""I have never seen melted steel in a building fire,"" says retired New York deputy fire chief Vincent Dunn, author of The Collapse Of Burning Buildings: A Guide To Fireground Safety. ""But I've seen a lot of twisted, warped, bent and sagging steel. **What happens is that the steel tries to expand at both ends, but when it can no longer expand, it sags and the surrounding concrete cracks.""**

&gt;""Steel loses about 50 percent of its strength at 1100°F,"" notes senior engineer Farid Alfawak-hiri of the American Institute of Steel Construction. ""And at 1800° it is probably at less than 10 percent."" NIST also believes that a great deal of the spray-on fireproofing insulation was likely knocked off the steel beams that were in the path of the crashing jets, leaving the metal more vulnerable to the heat.",2015-12-16 15:42:14+00:00,cy12mp8,6.0,t1_cy11z6m,1102.0,videos

NIST reports that pockets of fire hit 1832°F.
""The jet fuel was the ignition source,"" Williams tells PM. ""It burned for maybe 10 minutes, and [the towers] were still standing in 10 minutes.

You might as well say that doing anything with any risk involved as ""unwise"". Don't you drive in that car, because you might have an accident! 

As long as you do your research beforehand, you can make yourself aware of the level of risk and make an informed decision.

As for it not being ""good"", well that's *your* opinion. The dearth of Space Sims in the PC gaming market for the last 10 years shows that Publishers didn't care to invest money in the genre.

8172,"&gt;Let's just hope that 100 million dollars can get the game past a 16 player instance cap, or they're going to have huge problems

There's tons of optimizations left to do. I wouldn't worry as it's getting better every day. They're aiming for 50-100.

&gt;Even if they get the cap up to 64, they're going to encounter limitations. 

The cap is for ships, not players. One capital ship will only count as 1 ship in the instance, even if it has 30 players. This is because the instances are nested.

&gt;people will get frustrated over being in the wrong instance

The instance system takes care of that. You are automatically thrown into instances with your friends/org mates as well as enemies you're chasing.

&gt;certain systems will be clogged by having too many players

Not really. The Google Servers will just spin up more instances of the same system

This whole story has already been proven to have major holes in it. All the ""sources"" are anonymous, and the shitty website that posted it has shown that they were duped on credentials which they held up as proof that their sources were legit.

&gt;But if it were that easy that a devteam or studio with no real top level experience could pull it off,

You're the one who brought up Clinton. It doesn't just mention him, he is the **primary subject** of the writeup. 

&gt;First of all, you're referring to Army bases, not the military

I don't see how that changes anything. That's where that shooting happened.

&gt;Secondly, I'm sure Nadal knew there were armed security/law enforcement personnel stationed on base. The argument that gun-free zones are a target is that the suspects would assume to meet little resistance. I would not assume that highly-trained soldiers are unable or unwilling to use their weapons.

What weapons? That's the whole point. You go into a large building on base, and there are might be one or two guys with a pistol **if you're lucky**. Usually there's **none**.

Police(MPs) on a military base take just as long as non military police take. It's no different.


&gt;A school is a gun-free zone because while the police can respond, it will take time. A military base is a place where people are trained to use weapons, trained to kill, and have access to such weapons; it's not a soft target.

THEY [DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO WEAPONS](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/248685-mccarthy-says-defense-bill-could-lift-restrictions-on-military-guns). How many military bases have you been on?

8407,"&gt;SC is a literal cluster fuck

How do you figure? 

&gt; it boasts all these things with none of them working even at 25% capacity

That's because the overwhelming majority of early development consists of under the hood work to lay the infrastructure for the game. Playable content comes at the very end of development, which is why games aren't even announced until they are a year or less from release.

&gt;a game and the other is a perpetual hype machine

Just because the game is hyped, doesn't mean it isn't constantly progressing forward. AC 2.0 should be enough evidence of this, if you'd take the blinders off.

8444,"&gt;Aside from rumors about a budget shortage,

As Lawsoffire mentioned, this is an accusation that was made without a shred of proof.

&gt; Seems like the game's development is more concerned with meeting funding milestones and talking about its scale.

You have around 280 people working on this game. Most are working on the single player campaign, Squadron 42, in secret so as not to spoil the story. The stuff we see is put out through the marketing department and community management. This consists of just 3 or 4 people.

&gt;the fact it has a big A-list cast is more of a worry than a reason to look forward to it. Are they relying on star power (no pun intended) to garner excitement?

Star Citizen is built on the success of Wing Commander. It's a series which was a pioneer in the use of Full Motion Video and Green Screen sets. They were also famous for using pretty well-known actors( as Chris Roberts has always loved the film industry(even made Hollywood movies for a while like The Punisher, Lucky Number Slevin, Lord of War). Names like Mark Hamill, John Rhys-Davis, Tom Wilson, and Malcolm McDowell. This was something that fans of Chris Roberts games expect. 

And because of this, he made it as one of the original Stretch Goals (*$5 million: Squadron 42 will feature celebrity voice-acting including at least one favorite from Wing Commander and 50 total missions.*) and an added one. (12 million: Build professional sound studios. We’ll move Star Citizen’s sound production from a home office to high tech facilities that will give us access to cutting edge sound effects and Hollywood voice talent!)

Basically, it was a selling point to the game. And it helps the devs give the player a cinematic experience by using great actors.

8726,"ED has been worked on, on and off, since 2007. They had an already ramped up, fully staffed studio that built an in house engine specifically made for ED. They also have an unknown amount of funding from other sources that **significantly** increased their budget.

And last but not least, they procedurally generated an entire universe. Once you have the engine setup, you just drop data in and boom, it's done.

8727,"&gt; Yes it's a wild assumption, but it is a possibility that shouldn't just be ignored. Chris Roberts was the first person in history to be asked to direct the movie adaptation of a game he designed. Correct me if I'm wrong, but he stands as the only person to have done that to date.

Yes, it should be ignored. I could assume that David Braben is going to make the next ship in Elite look like a VW Bug because he owned one when he was 18. 

Your assumptions are as baseless as they come. CIG has stated already that any money coming in before the game is officially released goes into development of the game, server upkeep, and expansions after release. And that's it. Saying otherwise is accusing CIG of being liars. 

&gt;Now, with the piles of money he has at his disposal, why would he shy away from the chance to top himself?

I don't see how. That has always been a part of the scope since day one. And if you've ever played a Chris Roberts game, you'd know that it's a cornerstone of his game design style. 

&gt;I'm betting that a bunch of the kickstarter money or at least a decent chunk of the profits will go toward a SC movie. Don't get me wrong, I'd like to see one, but if I pay for a game I want assurance that the money I give will go toward the development of said game, not the self-glorification of some guy still hanging on to the success he had in the 90's.

8846,"&gt;It's neither been cancelled nor is there any proof that it will ever be complete

You just described every single game that is in development. Way to go, genius.

&gt;In the computer industry, vaporware is a product, typically computer hardware or software, **that is announced to the general public but is never actually manufactured nor officially cancelled**. 
Vaporware is **often announced** months or years before its purported release, **with development details lacking.**

CIG has been showing progress almost daily with a seemingly endless supply of development details and patches. So no, according to the **actual* definition of Vaporware, Star Citizen does not fall in to that category. 

&gt; and the last solid ""release date""

That date was changed very early in the process. I find it amusing that people keep bringing it up. They've been sticking to their current release timeframe for the last two years. Squadron 42 is slated for next year. The full game release is slated for Q1-Q2 of 2017.

8849,"&gt;Yeah but $95 million should make something better than an early alpha come out in a 3 year timeline.

They didn't have $95 million from day one. They also didn't have a company. It started with just 2 people. It takes a long time to build up talent and resources. You also haven't seen much of anything from the single player because it is being developed in secret so as not to spoil the secret.

Lastly, 3 years is nothing for an MMO. Most take ~5 years to develop. Star Citizen is an MMO **and** a single player campaign.

&gt;If you look at elite:dangerous it has less than 2/3 the budget and already has a full game out in less than that time.

Elite had an entire company already built, an engine already built to spec, and staff that created that engine. Not only that, they've been working on the game on and off since 2007.

You said their network...you didn't say their network backend code.
When you refer to a company's ""network"", you're referring to their infrastructure. 

And again, they've said that they really don't have an overwhelming amount of network traffic. Any limitations their currently facing are in clientside graphics processing. 

&gt;And for the LOD work they are doing, it really doesn't matter, go into the bengal carriers hangar, 30 ships inside all with basically max LOD..... rip framerate. Think about your hangar right now. (Yes I know the game isn't optimized, I just don't see anyone getting 60fps)

That's a **specific** scenario where your GPU will be the most taxed. A scenario that doesn't involve actual flying, which is where you'll really need those high framerates.

Instances are HUGE. Hundreds of thousands of km wide. Even all the ships were in a furball, the LOD models make it much easier to render. It's extremely unlikely that in a combat scenario, you'd have 60 ships within the highest LOD from you.
Plus, in space, you don't have to worry about stuff like rendering grass. Everything is wide open.

&gt;I also don't believe there network will be able to host something like that.

8878,"&gt;The New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act of 2013 commonly known as the NY SAFE Act is a gun regulation law in the state of New York. The **law passed** by the New York State Legislature on January 15, 2013, **in the middle of the night under a ""message of necessity"", bypassing the state's 3 day required review period** and was signed into law by Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo on the next day.  

&gt;The legislation was written **in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting** in Newtown, Connecticut. It was sponsored by State Senator Jeffrey Klein. It passed the New York State Senate on Monday, January 14, and the State Assembly on Tuesday, January 15. Governor Andrew Cuomo signed the bill into law half an hour after it passed the legislature. Cuomo described the law as the ""toughest"" gun control law in the United States.  

&gt;**The NY SAFE Act contains a number of firearms regulations, and a severability provision, in case the broad prohibitions against weapons are invalidated by the courts.**

8960,"&gt;We dumped 3.3 TRILLION dollars into a problem that kills less than domestic gun violence.

The invasion didn't cost 3.3 trillion. The entire Iraq war and occupation over 12 years cost closer to 2.2 trillion. The invasion itself was obviously MUCH less. 

&gt;I get it ground troops would destroy the statehood in days. however we'd be right back into fighting guerilla warfare with an occupation force. We'd be using an assult force to police yet another country.

And who says we'd have to occupy? The Iraqi Army is already there and partially fighting. We go in, take them out in a couple weeks, and go back home. The occupation stuff is finished.

&gt;We wouldn't be any safer. The attacks in paris were made by European nationals. Please get yoyr head out of your ass and think.

Umm, not all of them, no. A few of the attackers came in as refugees. And plenty of these european nationals, fought with ISIS in Syria. So, taking out ISIS in Syria would put a massive dent in that problem by killing them instead of having to try them in court back in Europe. 

It also allows us to send back all the refugees, which removes a security threat, and will take the strains off the host nations.

ISIS isn't an insurgency. They're an army. That's **exactly** what our military is designed to fight against. And we're damned good at it.   

Our invasion of Iraq only saw 172 coalition troops killed, while Saddam's Army saw ~30,000 troops killed. Our casualties increased only after the War was finished and it became an occupation. And even then, we've only had ~3500 killed. That's less than one coalition trooped killed every day as compared to ~300 a day JUST for American troops during WW2.   

ISIS is sweeping across Syria and Iraq as an Army. Ground troops **are** needed to take them out. We could invade and be done with it in 3 weeks. Would it get rid of ISIS? Nope.

9149,"&gt;Has it been shown? 

It has. I looked up the numbers a while ago. Smaller sample size though.

&gt;And of how many potential mass shootings was the shooter stopped by a gun toting citizen?

Most mass shootings have happened at schools or other ""gun free zones"". As such, law-abiding gun owners are rarely in the area with a weapon. Makes protecting people much more difficult.

&gt;No matter how many mass shootings you stop, you will never make up for the 30,000 monthly shootings that take place in the average American month.

And the majority of those shootings, are gang-related. We don't have a gun problem in the US. We have a gang problem.

Now, you don't know if it's the new firing pins being messed up, or if it's the bolts.

Making changes in a massive codebase can have unpredictable cascading failures which may not materialize until the build is stress tested. Or, they may know that their fix of one bug broke something else, but they don't care because they know how to fix it and they want to test the stability of their other fix.

9741,"&gt; Chris Roberts directed the big screen adaptation of Wing Commander, which bombed in theaters and was reviled by both professional critics and fans of the game series.  
  
Wing Commander had the production time sped up by 6-8 months by the studio while it was already half way into production. The studio was trying to beat Star Wars to release because they were worried that it would be overshadowed. They also forced Roberts to use a teen-friendly cast (Freddie Prinze Jr. and Matthew Lillard).   

The script was pretty bad though. But it was Chris Roberts' first movie. And it had some pretty amazing CGI. He's done more than a few movies since that were pretty solid. Lord of War, Lucky Number Slevin, The Jacket, and The Punisher, and Outlander.   

&gt;His passion is questionable, considering he left the game industry for nearly a decade. But let's give him the benefit of the doubt and say that he is passionate. Passion alone isn't enough to get a game made well.  

Since when does taking a break from something mean you're not passionate? The whole situation from Freelancer likely took a lot out of him. He's said many times in interviews, that the technology just wasn't there for this kind of game to exist how he wanted it. Now, however, PCs and Networking are at a point where it is possible.   

&gt;yet people are confident that Roberts can easily shake off the cobwebs out of his game development expertise and lead a team into successfully developing one of the most ambitious game projects of all time.  

Heading a project like this is big picture stuff. He's making design decisions for the most part, and any coding he does is limited to what he's knowledgeable on. Being out of the scene for the last 10 years shouldn't play a major role because he's not the one actually using the creation tools. He just comes out and says ""I want it to be like this.""   

And honestly, maybe it's better that he's been out of the field for a while. PC Gaming has gone to shit because of Publishers. So if the current way of doing things isn't working, why not try a way that *has* worked.

9750,"It's generally accepted to mean that. So when you tell someone a game is an MMORPG, they have certain expectations. This is from the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game#Progression):

&gt;In nearly all MMORPGs, the development of the player's character is a primary goal. Nearly all MMORPGs feature a character progression system in which players earn experience points for their actions and use those points to reach character ""levels"", which makes them better at whatever they do. Traditionally, combat with monsters and completing quests for Non-player characters, either alone or in groups, are the primary ways to earn experience points. The accumulation of wealth (including combat-useful items) is also a way to progress in many MMORPGs, and again, this is traditionally best accomplished via combat. The cycle produced by these conditions, combat leading to new items allowing for more combat with no change in gameplay, is sometimes pejoratively referred to as the level treadmill, or ""grinding"". The role-playing game Progress Quest was created as a parody of this trend. Eve Online trains skills in real time rather than using experience points as a meter of progression.",2015-10-18 21:35:33+00:00,cw4f9zp,7.0,t1_cw4eoyf,879.0,pcmasterrace

There's a few reasons. Chris Roberts is one of the very first developers out there that developed games with a cinematic experience with a story that sucked you in and characters that you connected with. 
This was pretty much unheard of at the time, and the story was usually something slapped after the fact together to justify gameplay. 

You also have an entire genre that has been more than just neglected by Publishers for the last decade, while they put out the same shovelware time and time again. 

With Chris Roberts, you have a passionate developer with extreme attention to detail and big vision who's sounding a rallying cry for PC Gamers saying ""enough is enough"".

Your previous comments presenting your opinion as fact, say otherwise.

&gt;I believe - in my heart, bone and every fiber - that ""walking around"" in a space game is a mistake. People are screaming for faster travel, autopilots and what not... in that light I fail to see the greatness in something as slow as walking. 

The whole point is either entirely lost on you, or you're being deliberately obtuse. It's not *just* ""walking"" It's not *just* method of transportation. Having first person gameplay adds tons of new gameplay mechanics to the game as well as enhancing other facets of the game.

* Increases the immersion the player feels.
* Allows the player to explore landing locations on planets, space stations, Capital ships
* Adds in the ability to EVA
* Adds boarding of enemy ships with combat
* Adds the ability to steal another player's or NPC's ship
* Zero-G FPS
* Random FPS encounters on landing locations
* Adds Competitive leagues within the game for FPS and shooters
* Adds occupations on ships like medic, fire suppression crews, and engineers which will all need to be able to move throughout the ship during space combat.
* There is even an FPS focused Space Marine Campaign planned sometime after Squadron 42. 
* etc

&gt;Imagine having to walk for 2-3 minutes EACH WAY to and from a missions office just to get missions in ED, pay off fines or cash in vouchers. Each at its own location somewhere on the station. Every time. A 2-3 minute walk (at least) is not unreasonable considering the size of stations and some ships. Something like the black market office might even be in a remote desolated corner somewhere. Perhaps there even is a queue at the elevators - because we dont want to walk huge stations alone do we? Walking around is the biggest waste of dev time for a spacegame I can imagine. 

A minute here or there never stopped anyone from playing a good RPG or MMORPG. 

I think the Mass Effect trilogy is a great example of how the landing areas can be well designed and not have too long of a distance between points of interest. And if you've played through ArcCorp landing zone already, you'd know that it's pretty amazing as far as environments go. The level of detail is astounding.

You literally have **no** evidence to base these claims off of. There are already TONS of people posting all kinds of videos of them having fun while outside of their ships.

CCP executed it poorly and segregated the community by releasing it on the Ps3. It also was pretty terrible, apparently.

9909,"&gt;[slander](http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/slander)  
n. oral defamation, in which someone tells one or more persons an untruth about another which untruth will harm the reputation of the person defamed. Slander is a civil wrong (tort) and can be the basis for a lawsuit. Damages (payoff for worth) for slander may be limited to actual (special) damages unless there is malicious intent, since such damages are usually difficult to specify and harder to prove. Some statements such as an untrue accusation of having committed a crime, having a loathsome disease, or being unable to perform one's occupation are treated as slander per se since the harm and malice are obvious, and therefore usually result in general and even punitive damage recovery by the person harmed. Words spoken over the air on television or radio are treated as libel (written defamation) and not slander on the theory that broadcasting reaches a large audience as much if not more than printed publications. (See: defamation, fair comment)

&gt;**[Satire](https://www.rcfp.org/browse-media-law-resources/digital-journalists-legal-guide/protection-satire-and-parody) and parody are important forms of political commentary** that rely on blurring the line between truth and outrageousness to attack, scorn and ridicule public figures. **Although they may be offensive and intentionally injurious, these statements contain constitutionally protected ideas and opinions, provided a reasonable reader would not mistake the statements as describing actual facts**. Put another way, subjects of even the most biting satire or criticism cannot successfully sue unless the irreverent comments contain a provably false fact.

Uhh...apparently you haven't heard of the [SAFE Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NY_SAFE_Act).

&gt;The New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act of 2013 commonly known as the NY SAFE Act is a gun regulation law in the state of New York. The law passed by the New York State Legislature on January 15, 2013, **in the middle of the night under a ""message of necessity"", bypassing the state's 3 day required review period** and was **signed into law** by Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo on **the next day**.

&gt;The legislation was **written in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting** in Newtown, Connecticut. It was sponsored by State Senator Jeffrey Klein. It passed the New York State Senate on Monday, January 14, and the State Assembly on Tuesday, January 15, **Governor Andrew Cuomo signed the bill into law half an hour after it passed the legislature**. Cuomo described the law as the ""toughest"" gun control law in the United States.

10089,"&gt;To fix the problem of ensuring that more stores will take mobile payments, Samsung turned to a clever piece of technology that lets you pay at most any terminal where you can swipe a credit card. The trick comes thanks to a tiny coil that shoots out the same magnetic code that those readers normally get from your credit card. It's called ""Magnetic Secure Transmission,"" or MST; it's built into the Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge+, and Note 5. As with other mobile wallets, Samsung Pay can also let you pay with NFC and it will store loyalty cards and gift cards.

Everyone who works for Chris Roberts has said he micromanages and demands perfection. Those kinds of leaders tend to piss people off, because they have to work harder.  People that are fired from that kind of job aren't going to look at their boss fondly. 

Steve Jobs was the same kind of person. But what you can't deny, is that the end product is amazing. ",2015-10-05 21:01:04+00:00,cvpccik,6.0,t1_cvpbvkc,705.0,KotakuInAction

&gt;Q. What Do I Have to Prove in a Defamation Claim?
A. In both libel and slander cases, you need to prove that:
&gt;The allegations have been published to one or more persons (other than yourself)  
The allegations refer to you – either that you are named, pictured or are identifiable in some other way   
That the words tend to lower you in the eyes of right thinking members of society.  
In slander cases, you will also need to prove that you have suffered financial loss, unless the allegations relate to   your profession or an offence punishable by imprisonment.

Since Star Citizen is being developed with the crowd funding model, there are MUCH fewer costs involved. This allows the developer to spend more than 4x as much of the budget on *actual* development. 

**That means a $90 million dollar budget in crowd funding is equal to at least a $360 million dollar budget in traditional Publisher model of game development.**

So you should be comparing SC's budget to games that are in the $360 million dollar range.

10260,"The only time marketing is separate on that list, is if it's specified. Game devs rarely mention the breakdown of the entire budget.

Only 7 games on that list of 38 actually mention their marketing cost. Of those, only one has a dev cost over $90 million. And that one (GTA V) was developed for 5 separate platforms.

Marketing for Star Citizen is only 10% of its budget (most likely less due to all the free advertising SC has gotten through partnerships with companies like Logitech). Marketing covers anything public, including conventions.

The only other expense, is 5%-10% for kickstarter and financial transaction fees. That leaves at LEAST 80% of the $90 million purely for development.

To contrast this, games developed under the publisher model only spend on average 20% of their budget on development.

10462,"&gt;I understand but its week 1 and everyone's acting like they are super bowl favorites

Everyone? Really? Show me all the posts heralding the Bills as Super Bowl favorites. One or two outliers don't count. 

People **are** however, saying that this is a playoff team. I don't see why this is so out of the realm of possibility for you. They have a top 2 or 3 defense with arguably the best front four in football. 
They're stacked with receiver talent and running backs. 

This is a good team.

&gt;Tyrod is an unknown QB who played one game against the colts where he only had to throw the ball 19 times due to the early lead the bills got against a less than stellar colts defense.

The Bills had Kyle Orton and EJ Manual as QBs last season, and still came out with a 9-7 record. 

And even with throwing only 19 times(Rex purposely held back in the second half to run the clock down. Nothing the Colts did suggested they would have been able to stop him in the second half), the vaunted Colts offense couldn't even come close to keeping up with him.

10640,"&gt; Thank you for proving my point. No game from 10 years ago could match SC size and fidelity. You are EXACTLY right.

That wasn't your point... The fact that they couldn't be made was only due to hardware limitations, not budgetary limitations.

As for being able to make a game of this size with a smaller budget, you're overlooking the most important fact: CIG doesn't have Publisher overhead. That's one of the main reasons CIG chose to go this route.

[Every single dollar in CIG's crowd-funding model is equal to 4 to 4.25 times more in actual development money.](http://i.imgur.com/cbs3aHj.jpg)

In essence, that $88 million dollars is equal to a $352 to $374 million dollar AAA budget with a publisher.

10695,"Damn... I'm no expert. I just interned over at Cisco in their CALO labs. So we ran into a lot of console issues with devices, considering the volume of stuff we had to work with.

If you can 100% verify that it's not your connection (I'd see if you could console into a Cisco device that you're sure works), then in your case, we'd RMA it. 

It's been mentioned a few times, but when we came up on an issue with console not working, here are the main things we checked. And I realize you said you did all of these:

1. Baud rate. (check every rate your device is capable of)
2. Console cable. Try another one. Try it on a different device
3. Com Port. With a USB to serial, the correct one will leave the Putty window open. The wrong one will give you an error.
4. Check to see if there are any IRQ conflicts with the com port.

His game Battlecruiser 3000AD is pretty much THE example you hold up for over promising and under delivering. 

He seems to hate Chris because of this.

One of CIG's previous employees, Eric Peterson(who worked with Chris at Origin), even [stated](http://massivelyop.com/2015/07/14/derek-smart-calls-for-investigation-of-star-citizens-finances-presents-chris-roberts-with-list-of-demands/) that DS has been plaguing them with threats for decades.  

&gt;Look, I am no longer at CIG, but I recall when Chris and I were working at Origin, Derek Smart sent several negative emails accusing us of stealing his ideas etc, the guy is just not worth the time to read.
He is just trying to get attention – something none of us should ever give him.
IMHO, I think CIG did the right thing here, that guy is just not worth the trouble.

They weren't historically bad, because they were even worse the season before.

&gt;That 20 more wins than you had last year. Do you not realize how unlikely of that is? 

It's unlikely when you're talking about a team which may have signed a random UFA or two. That's not what happened. This team is almost an entirely different team. It would be like saying ""The Stars can't make the playoffs next season, because the Sabres were bad last season"".

This is a team that was gutted of their veteran UFAs and playing with AHLers. So the swing won't be as drastic as you contend because these were players that should not have even been sniffing the NHL.

That team right there is heads and shoulders better at offense. It's also a much more defensively responsible offense. 
The Sabres were the worst team in the league in time spent in their own end. Which in turn meant they were also unsurprisingly the worst team in the league in time spent in the offensive zone. Having a better offense that can apply pressure and retain the puck will take the pressure off our defense. It's not going to get lit up like it was last year.

11018,"&gt;Star Citizen's original scope was that of a MMO Space Sim with an ever expanding persistent universe that was going to be completely player driven. Now, it's going to be largely a single player experience with ""drop-in co-operative"" campaign, with an online option. 

The game was **always** dual-faceted, with a branching story driven campaign, and an MMO set after the events of the campaign.

Nothing has changed. There hasn't been any change in attention being spent on one facet over the other.

&gt; And the online experience will be dictated by the player, the player controls how many other players he sees and plays with. For an online game, this is a disaster of a feature.

This is also not true. The player has a slider which is like changing a dice. You can only affect the probability of seeing a player. You will still have encounters, but they will be NPCs. This slider loses it's affect that farther out of safe space that you go. It also lessons all drops and commodity selling prices, which makes it more lucrative to fly without it. 

Comparing it to DayZ is apples and oranges.

&gt;If your playing online, see an enemy ship, or you get attacked, you will have a built in option for bailing out with no repercussions.

More utter bullshit. You obviously don't know what you're talking about. If you log off, your ship stays where it is unless you properly docked it in your hangar.

&gt;We now know that the actual ""Persistent Universe"" won't be available upon release.

False. That doesnt even make sense. You might as well be saying ""The game won't be available when it's released"". 

&gt;Instead players will have to either host or join privately hosted servers which will be part of an ever expanding network, currently they have been developing matchmaking and instancing that will work across that network, but it's still in early development.

Geezus dude. Did you even look into this game at all? You're just making things up. That is not at all how the game works. Everything is hosted on Google Cloud servers, with CIG hosting the master universe servers to tie them all together. 

&gt;They mused about having a mega-server eventually, but it will not be ready when the game officially releases.

You're an idiot. That's honestly the only conclusion any sane person could come to after reading your post

&gt;Who the hell is Reinhardt - will he even make the NHL roster this year?

Oh, just the #2 pick in the draft last season. And yes, he will be playing in the NHL.

&gt;Eichel hasn't played a single game yet and all of a sudden he makes you a contender as soon as next year?

Putting words in my mouth now? I said that entire group of players makes us a contender. Eichel is among that group.

Just look at [who these players are replacing](http://www.tsn.ca/are-the-sabres-now-a-playoff-team-1.325170).

Not only that, the Sabres had the [worst percentage](http://www.puckalytics.com/teamstats.html) of time spent in the defensive zone(39.18%) as well as the offensive zone(26.49%. They also had the worst [shots on goal average](http://www.nhl.com/stats/team?fetchKey=20152ALLSAAAll&amp;ord=asc&amp;sort=avgShotsAgainstPerGame&amp;viewName=summary) in the league.

 A better offense is going to entirely change the face of the team. Throw in a coach who actually knows how to do more than just motivate players, and you've got a playoff team.
