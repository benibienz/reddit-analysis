But when searching the sub, all I found about larger cap batteries is a post about using the Galaxy S7 battery. The poster said that it's a little thicker than the S6 battery, so it prevents you from getting the phone's body closed properly.

So my questions are, has anyone tried the larger capacity batteries that are designed for the S6 itself? Do they also suffer from this issue? Also, do you have some good sites that you recommend getting batteries from? I don't want to get some poor knockoff that's going to blow up in my pocket on its first charge.

Here are a few I've seen or thought of:

* [Foveated Rendering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeR4M9Vt02Q) With Eye Tracking (already being worked on AFAIK) and depth of field..

* Two front facing HD cameras to allow for 3D AR, room mapping, etc  

* Headphone mounts that are [universal with Oculus's system](https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/qwqAOq6tCQPh5uVH.medium) so third party developers can provide higher quality mounted headphones. Obviously they'd need to work out the details with Oculus, but it would be nice to have a device agnostic system.  

* Newest versions of USB and HDMI on all cables. (Still don't get the USB 2.0 thing)  

* Some different, optional 1st-party controller types  

* Body tracking  

* Mouth tracking for mapping yourself to an in-game character.

* [GVS Motion Simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RKh0B4SNp8) Technology through electric stimulation.

So, what would you guys/girls like to see?

---------

After watching the most recent 10 for the Developers(@17:13 Episode 1, Dec 28 2015) I started thinking of a good way to implement galaxy-wide pandemics which could spread naturally, but wouldn't destroy everything like what happened with WoW.  


My idea is to assign each player with a Digital DNA(DDNA) strand. Each player would get a binary number sequence however many digits long (say, 100-200). It would have certain markers that are specific to your character's initial start point (sort of like a birth point). Each number would simply be a flag. Some flags would be more common than others.  


eg. 0010101110101111000  


I could say that anyone from Stanton System, is going to have a 1 on the 3rd and 10th place. The rest of the numbers would be random, or perhaps other things would cause flags like race, sex, etc. It wouldn't take a lot of work to add this number to a character's profile as most of it could be randomized.   



So now, I could put out a virus that affects anyone from Stanton, who also has 3 other flags set as a 1. Then I could set parameters for that virus, like say it's passed to anyone I get within 3 feet of, and through certain food goods for example. Then add in a roll for infection to randomize it a bit and slow the progression. Add in incubation times and mortality rates and this could get really interesting.  


You'd suddenly add in new occupations for science researchers. At first, we wouldn't know what is causing the infection. Researchers could race to test all commodities and volunteers. CIG could show heatmaps of the universe to show infections rates. They could work to come up with a cure or a vaccine which would flip one of the flags back to a zero for a set amount of time and make someone immune. Now you have another commodity to sell to people. Sales of special masks to protect yourself on planets would go up. Environmental suits that would need single use decontamination kits whenever you get back into your ship. It would immediately affect the galactic economy as people rush to buy these things, and stop selling infected items.   



So for example:  


&gt;**Virus XYZ**  


&gt;Affects: 0000000010000000000011 (anyone with those flags on)  
Transmission: Get within 3 feet of infected (5% chance of infection)  
Beef Products (5% chance of infection for every hour spent on planet that exports beef)  
Incubation Period: 3 days  
Infectious Period: 7 days  
Mortality Rate: 20%  
Immunity if Survive Infection: Yes  
Pass immunity to children: No  
Cure: No  
Vaccine: Yes (lasts 1 month)  



So what do you guys/girls think? Does this sound like a cool idea or is it terrible? How would you improve on it?

edit:

Just to point out, this isn't something that I personally envision happening frequently. CIG is all about being dungeon masters of the Star Citizen universe. I just think this might be an interesting galaxy-wide event that they could drop on everyone once a year or something.
