3: why would i feel sorry for you? because noone likes you on this reddit and your logic is just fucking retarded

4: if you weren't a random NWA back in the day was actually good but no. that wasnt my best faction so dont assume that you dumb fuck, and before you make fun of my factions TELL ME whos past factions are better? 

You: Awakened, Yoke, Yokenide(Eotw), Duckclan, Aloha, Sweatfest, Lunar, Yardstick, Wickedsweet, Malice, Victoriasecret, Demonic, Resistance, Painolympics - LOOL NICE PAST FACTIONS I see 2 good ones which probably you got kicked from after a day

now this is my past factions: MadDog(HCT), NWA(HCT &amp; Kohi), NASA(HCT), Sentinel(HCT), Indigo(Kohi), Venezuela(Kohi), DooDoo(Kohi), AbusementPark(Kohi), The Original WonderPets(Kohi), LeftClick(Kohi), Dojo(Kohi), Cartel(Kohi), Savage(Kohi), Omen(Kohi), WahChing(Kohi), LosBanditos(Kohi), 

you wont reconize most of them because you are a random cya, my roast is done you are now extra tender and cooked to perfection.


edit; gl leading if youre their leader LOOoL, take a look at yourself http://prntscr.com/cnls8f this is why noone likes you, i remembered when you was in nwa teamspeak you were so shy and quiet it was sooo cute awhh
