Just purchased coin punch &amp; reducer for quarters. Need to purchase a ring stretcher. Can you recommend  one that is decent quality &amp; not too expensive? I see them on Amazon for $100-130, but are they any good? Also, will the 1 ton arbor press from Harbor Frieght be sufficient for quarters &amp; larger coins in the future? Thanks for your help.",coinrings,Advise please.,https://www.reddit.com/r/coinrings/comments/55lp2v/advise_please/
