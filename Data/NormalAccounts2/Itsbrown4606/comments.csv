iPad 3 is a bit choppy at times, like navigating the menu and the intro video, but it seems to work sufficiently well. Launching the app for the first time also takes around 20-30 seconds to play the 4LS video and get to the main menu.

Surprisingly, though, it managed the word cloud *better* but still crashed. It got choppy as hell but it toughed it out for a good ten seconds before it finally gave up.

On thing I've noticed is that Auto Mode doesn't disable the auto-lock timer so you basically have to disable auto-lock if you use Auto Mode.

125,"1. The timing isn't super strict, I'd say. You're biggest issue with the timing is going to be getting the game properly calibrated more than hitting notes in the correct window. It's been so long since I played the earlier GH games I honestly can't give you a comparison to which one GH Live is close to. It's certainly not as lax as GH3 but I don't think it's as strict as GH2.

2. GHTV works by basically ""streaming"" songs that are just on a constant rotation. You hop in and out as you please but the songs are always playing and you'll either join in in the middle of the current song or in-between song transitions. You will always be able to play what's currently in one of the two channels as they do not use plays. Plays allow you to play a specific song using the Music Catalog. The game will throw about 30 at you as you rank up in the beginning but that's it. I've heard that since the new patch a few weeks ago, if you log into GHTV for the day without any plays, the game will give you 3. I haven't been able to confirm this. But, to reiterate, you can always play in the free channels.

3. It only ""ruins"" the concept if you're used to score chasing on a single song over and over again. I don't tend to score chase on GHTV just because it's too much of a hassle but it certainly doesn't hurt to FC a song as it will likely get you first place for a song (you always play against 9 other players, either offline players with their already (allegedly) accumulated score or against live people playing at the same time you are), provided you aren't beaten by the guitar upgrades higher levels might have.

4. Songs are probably somewhere between 4 and 6 minutes, usually, I think. Usually you will play 3 or 4 songs every 15 minutes and then the game goes into a small intermission every 15 minutes. There are always two channels and categories change either every half hour or hour.

5. There are two channels. Channel 1 is where the harder stuff like hard rock and metal like to live but occasionally easier categories will show up. Channel 2 is where easier stuff like indie and pop rock live. Sometimes full-on rock shows up. If you don't like what's playing, you can look in the channel guide and see what's coming up and wait for something to come up later, go into the Music Catalog and burn some plays, or, yeah, just deal with it.

6. Honestly, I didn't like it at first but I'm getting used to it. I mainly play Rock Band 4 so a catalog of a couple hundred songs would normally cost quite a bit. Plus, songs are added every Tuesday which start as premium shows (I think) and then get added to the channel rotation the week after. The only songs I've heard of getting removed so far are some day one A7X songs, but then again I don't keep up with it.",2015-12-20 05:41:17+00:00,cy58y1q,1,t3_3xjh2x,7524,GuitarHero

The first time I played, the preceding song wasn't too bad so I think I got about 98-99% on Expert. The player I first faced off against was only on Advanced or possibly even Regular, so he kept a better combo and therefore scored similarly to me in points. Therefore, face off.

The second Rivals, the preceding song was California (Cast Iron). I don't know if you've played it, but it's rough on expert. So I got about 90% and an acceptable score. The guy I paired with was on Advanced and presumably did much better percentage wise, but we were close on score. Therefore, face off. Our face off song was Girls/Girls/Boys by Panic! At The Disco, which is mainly chords. So I smoked the guy by about 400k points on Expert while he was on Advanced.

tl;dr I think it's based off of points in the previous song.",2015-12-15 00:46:59+00:00,cxzaxf3,1,t3_3wsiym,34955,GuitarHero

msconfig configuration was unsuccessful and *technically* made the situation worse. Instead of freezing at the ""Starting Windows"" screen, the signal cuts out entirely after that screen and the monitor goes into standby. I don't hear any error messages popping up though but since Greenshot is now disabled I can't get a screenshot to see.

I made an interesting discovery, though. I went to plug in a VGA cable so I could boot into low resolution mode (which may or may not have been necessary, but still) and when I plugged in the cable, I lost the video entirely (from boot). When I unplugged the VGA cable, the feed to the DVI cable came back after I rebooted.

Low resolution mode was also unsuccessful. Same presentation as configuring msconfig.
