Umm, I'm not really sure what to say. I basically started this subreddit, probably a year ago... honestly just because. I had grandiose plans on building this thing up and finally revealing it at some point but life and general laziness took over. At this point, I just have [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) hooked into the subreddit to automatically post the YouTube videos and pretty much nothing else. I browse Reddit practically everyday so posting the videos to the subreddit allows me to see them here instead of checking on YouTube.

So, anyway, welcome to the subreddit. CSS is kind of terrible. I am a programmer but CSS is by far one of my worst ""languages."" I wanted something other than the default CSS so I looked for subreddit CSS subreddits and found/settled on /r/Minimaluminiumalism. If this kind of takes off as a hub, I'm more than willing to mod one or two people who are versed in CSS and moderation so they can spruce up the place. I certainly don't know what I'm doing.

Anyways, enjoy!

I was instantly hooked, going through Emi's route in a single day and then going through, in order, Hanako, Rin, Lilly, and Shizune in a similar time. Somehow I was able to stay up for 36 hours doing nothing but reading all of the stories and not feeling any worse for wear. After everything was said and done, the game had a profound affect on me... albeit temporarily.

I told myself I would pick this game back up this same time next year and re-read *one* story. Before Let's Dub started working on Emi's route, I was likely going to do her route but since they started working on her route, I decided to actively avoid her route. That was my only restriction.

I eventually decided on either a Lilly or Hanako route so I started trying for that. Well, evidently I took a wrong turn somewhere because I start spending a lot of time with Rin on her wall and eventually [Nomiya asks me why I'm hanging out with Rin so much](http://i.imgur.com/Qg1ryTK.jpg). **Shit.** I made a wrong turn somewhere. (Turns out, when Misha and Shizune are arguing about lunch, go talk to Hanako instead of reading my book.) After going back and making a course correction, I was finally tasked with either going into town or going to the library. I decided to go for a Lilly route.

After playing through Lilly's route and trying to take a much of it in as I can, I can see why people love Lilly. She is genuinely just the sweetest person and I was hanging on to every moment with her. Their confessions in Hokkaido were just as touching as I remembered them being. All-in-all, it was a great read and I'm glad I picked her route to get back into assaulting my feels. I'm a Hanabro leaning Emigo but this Lilly play-through has made me like her even more.

The only thing that's nagging me is that I'm not sure if I've gotten the everything out of the route that I should, as far as, like, life lessons go. I dunno. I'm open to hearing what everyone else has gotten out of Lilly's route 'cause I think that'll help clear things up in my mind.

Anyways, I'm looking forward to doing my next route in a couple of months. It'll likely be Hanako or Shizune.

At first I thought it was because I'm playing against other players more often and I get more status from beating them, but I haven't been able to confirm it.

The note highway also stalls so it throws my rhythm off and I almost usually break combo.

It's done this from the start and I kind of just got used to it and assumed it was just shoddy programming but it's getting worse and makes score chasing almost completely and unbearably frustrating. I'm working on ""I Will Wait"" and the song's enough of a PITA already without the game sabotaging me. I'm about to snap this guitar controller in half.

I don't recall seeing anything like this being mentioned before and I wouldn't even know how other people would describe it to look up if other people are having the same issue. Anyone else getting the same thing? I'm completely done with it tonight but I can try and get a video of it tomorrow night if anyone is interested.

I know it's going to boil down to an /u/atviassist ping so I might as well throw in a tag to get their attention. Any thoughts?

If I boot into Safe Mode, the display works fine. I can hear sounds of normal operation (welcome sound, login sound, error messages) going on as well. I attempted to take a screenshot with Greenshot and dump it to my Dropbox so I could see the error message but all I get is [a black screen with the mouse cursor](http://i.imgur.com/HHgZMW4.png) (I just now realized the picture is 1024 x 768. It should be 1920 x 1080). I also tried connecting to it via TeamViewer and got a black screen with a very odd glitch where [random parts of the screen would render as I moved the mouse](http://i.imgur.com/IunGSnc.jpg).

A few weeks ago, I had another symptom present itself where the graphics would just completely fail over and over again, recovering each time, but eventually causing a BSOD. (I would've rebooted earlier but I was doing homework. Thank goodness Notepad++ saves new documents in progress.) After the BSOD, everything appeared to be working up until just a few hours ago. I recognized the possibility that something was wrong with my card but would see how things played out.

I'm leaning towards either a failure of the video card itself or some kind of driver issue. Leaning more towards driver because Safe Mode works. At this point I'm too tired to fuss with it further because I've been under the weather all day and wanted to watch tonight's NASCAR race but it was rained out. Not sure what else to try at this point so I'm open to suggestions.

Here are the actions I've taken thus far:

* Attempted a System Restore, rolling back to a restore point about 4 days ago. The only thing I accomplished was breaking Avast, apparently. I'll worry about that later.

* Followed troubleshooting steps available [here](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/why-is-my-screen-black-when-i-start-windows-7) in this Microsoft support document (registry was fine).

* Attempted to use Device Manager to roll back the driver for the card. This did not work either but while attempting to update the driver afterwards, Windows says the driver is up to date.

* Launched the GeForce Experience program on my computer to pull down a new set of drivers but even in Safe Mode with Networking and connected to my router, it could not connect to pull down updates. Haven't tried going to the website manually to retrieve new drivers (pulling now). **EDIT: Pulling down and updating driver manually was unsuccessful.**

* Can't test other video cards until Monday, when I can get to work and get with my co-workers in IT to try any cards they might have on hand. \*\*I don't have any other display ports on the computer other than the ones from the card.\*\*
