0,"I'm bored of people that don't get why Rust is the best game ever. You clearly enjoyed the game until you understood the meta, then you thought it was too competitive for your taste. Well, that's where you're not wrong, it clearly is too much competitive for you. It's the core of this game that is too competitive against all other games; this game is like the true nature of hard-core gaming. And nobody tells you to do nothing inside of it; you just log in, and express yourself. No character-class has to be picked, you just play the way you like. If you're social or anti-social, this game will reveal it. It's the unique game EVER where you can be a killer, or a painter WITHOUT ANYTHING INSIDE THE GAME TO FORCE YOU TO BE IT, you just do what you want in it. So if you don't play it, is because, imho, you stopped seeing it as a game, but more as a competition. In Rust to be competitive, you must analyze a lot of factors (like, how many hours a day you can spend in it, average population of the server, etc etc etc). I spent 2000+ hours playing it, i met new friends, we built many bases, we raided and got raided; furthermore this game is so freaking epic that EVOLVES while you play it. Each fucking week there's a fuckin update. Please. This is ABSOLUTELY the best 15â‚¬ ever spent on gaming in my life; even if now i'm gonna play dota2 or Skyrim instead of Rust.

Once i learned how to use the weapons, how be stealthy, how to not rage, rust became actually boring; rarely in the latest months, i have been totally wiped away, it happened like 2-3 times since 2014. This is definetly the best game i've ever played, but sincerely the unique thing that makes me play it again are the fresh monthly wipes, and new updates. After a week into the wipe, i have few bases, i don't really care about the loot, i go hunting for action, a bow a spear are enough, i usually get guns from my victims (i'm quite good 1v1, 1v2). I've enstablished trusted relations with few players who play with me from time to time, so maybe we play rust again to have fun togheter.

So i don't really see the problem. But i understand, when a player lose stuff for an hacker encounter, it's bad, and ruins the game experience. Anyway, as it is for now, a player has the power to choose between the possibility of playing with hackers, or the chance of playing with hackers and abusive admins. For my personal taste, i think that an admin should be passive; remove-give tools should be turned off, an admin should ONLY have the chance to report and ban; so i would add this: Servers declare with a flag, if they have active or passive admins, which can't be changed without changing the flag. If a server has a passive admin flag, an admin CAN'T modify ANYTHING in the game, CAN'T spawn stuff, CAN'T destroy items or structures, CAN'T spawn as newman in the game, CAN only observe.

A season-cycle could be a week long, so a wipe would have 4 cycles (making season a part of the strategy for raiders and farmers). After a server wipe a random season should be randomized, to offer every time a different experience. Seasonal events could be a thing, like the spawn of the old dead whale on a coast, maybe during winter (to have a reason to fight for low grade fuel in times of scarcity); there could be RNG floodings in autumn and less or no water in summer in some part of the map. Tornadoes with RNG path and a very small % to spawn, in windy-stormy days, that could damage low tier structures, or just slightly reduce stability of the upper floors. Heart quakes?

801,"I've watched a movie called The Revenant, and i suggest you to watch it. There's a lot of Rust in it, and some things that could very well fit in Rust.
Apart for the ton of survival wisdom that the movie contains, it might be a good inspiration to develop better fighting simulations.
To me, it gave these ideas that, i know you don't give a fuck, but could very well improve the action in Rust:

*  You should be able to use fists.

*  Medikit is not instant use, like bandages it should require time to be applied.

*  You get in the Wounded State whenever you receive a big hit, like 50% of your actual Hit Points.

*  When entering WS the toon perform an animation like it does now, for few seconds (depending on HP, the higher the less)

*  When the WS animation expires, you're still down on the ground, but you can slowly crawl around, and slowly use items (like bandages, syringes, medikit, food, a gun, c4 and so on, you got it)

*  If you've been hit on the Head, WS remains passive.

*  Melee fight should be far way more quick and lethal, with the addition of Blocking on timed click.

Beyond that, what comes to my mind now is:

*  Add bear cubs.

*  Make wolves spawn in packs of various amount, even if the pathing is bugged. 

*  When you science out how to ride/breed horses in Rust, it will become game of the decade.

*  Boars should be bigger, have cubs, move around in packs, charge and attack badly equipped players.

*  **Introduce Seasons**, with weekly cycle; people ask for the return of snow biome, why not adding a wheater system with temperature variation between seasons, so that instead of rain you see snow falling.

*  Make more raw hand-crafted clothing, all today clothes should require BP and to be found in the ruins.

Cheers.

* They posted a Mind Map which is receiving suggestions since more than a year
* To add small, big, huge new features requires lot of time and tinkering sometimes
* Rust is complex and full of stuff, Garry already said that they are changing many things in favour of performance, as result of a poll
* They saw that the average player is not happy on how the blueprint works, and they will change it *again* to find a better solution
* They are going to add more flying PvE enemies, and we all should know why are them flying, or focused for Rad Towns: they have problems handling the AI of *ground* mobs on the ProcGen map; it's something related to pathing. When they will fix the AI with unity, we'll probably see a waterfall of new animals, maybe creatures, probably NPCs.
* They wrote back in some devblog that a new metabolism system is being worked on.

1066,"&gt; Yes it does give alot of good stuff, so why cant we have convoys or military bases that also give good stuff? ofc it helps for co-op none is gonna take down the chopper alone and then defend the loot alone, least not on a populated server. you have to cooperated if you wanna get away with the loot.

a convoy require a tremendous amount of work to be achieved, what i suggest requires much less.

&gt; But what if you have a non aggresion pact with another clan.

we usually use voice communication through the game to show the icon (which i don't like); same clothes and jumps on request to avoid friendly fire.

&gt; What would end up happening is solo players will have wooden buildings. clans will have stone buildings. solo players will have (spears, bows, crossbows, revolvers) clans will have aks and bolts.

not if the amount of ak and bolts is restricted to un-craftable items; if AK and Bolts required parts like Auto-Turrets, great clans would end up having 4-6 AK each, which isn't that bad, because being so rare, less clans would risk useing them on the battlefield.

1070,"&gt; why would you take down the chopper when you can kill players? because it offer an alternativ that forces player interaction and cooperation.

the chopper gives unique non-craftable items and a shit load of expensive ammo, also it doesn't help for co-op that much since when somebody is attacking a chopper, groups set ambushes to steal the loot, and fights happens; that is a nice thing.

&gt; because currently its extremly hard to see whos who.

that's a problem of communication, you can avoid that in many ways.

&gt; This is achieved for most after 1-2 days and then the remaining days you just sit and wait for people to raid while you manage your quarries/pumps.

true, my group did this in the first 12 hours cycle after the wipe (we are 6 nerds + some normal players); surely a more vast end game would help, but it requires lot of development to be achieved, while i would prefer to see quicker solutions before.

&gt; So what do you propose exactly?

as i've wrote in other reply on this thread, i suggest to give to the wooden building tier a much more important role (making stone less obtainable), also forcing players to use early tiers of weapons (spears, bows, crossbows, revolvers) for a longer time (making guns and last tier or weapons in general, much harder to obtain and craft)",2015-11-24 11:47:57+00:00,cxba8au,4.0,t1_cxba1wj,712.0,playrust

Performance goes before anything else. Performance is king to all other things; to the old pool i voted for performance.

&gt; Your ideas would be fine if they did not have people already playing the game. But since there is a decent sized player base, your ideas are awful.

Thanks for ""awful"". But i think you miss what i'm saying. The last three patches saw a modification of the AK's recoil for example. I would gladly have a bad recoil, but less AK in the game, while for example, new tools and weapons for early game. Also, we now have a new machine gun which surely took many dozen of hours of work to have it working right; next patch we'll see other balancing on that item. When in the future new stuff will be added, both the AK and the big Machinegun, will probably require new balance. This is what i'm talking about; how can you perfectly balance stuff in a game with missing parts? when you add the missing parts you must rebalance the whole thing again and again and again; i play rust a lot (i've played it in such bad states that you wouldn't imagine), I would sacrifice some balance for new stuff in the future; in the past months we had a flow of new stuff coming out that was epic, now for the sake of balance, we see a rework of what we always had, and few few new items.

The game is playable, was playable, will be playable; small changes to damage output of items, the add of new weapons, doesn't benefit the playability. The small changes they make to enhance the fps, those are always welcome, and expected.

&gt; This whole statement sounds more like something you want is more important than what most other people want and shows you don't really know how game development works.

it was my personal opinion, everyone is free to have one, if you don't like it, just go on.

&gt; What is the developer in charge of map generation and static buildings going to do with developing new resources? 

he's not doing very much lately anyway; last ""important update"" to procgen was like... few months ago; i know the map is good now, but adding a ""made in two hours"" model of a ruin house to this game shouldn't be so complex, otherwise the use of Unity is a bad bad bad bad move. We don't play Rust for its graphics, so (keeping on exposing my genitals.. pardon, my opinion) everybody would enjoy badly designed new rads to play in.

&gt; These things take days, weeks, or months to develop... you can't put every single person on one task so that it gets done quicker. 

I mean that Garry could hire new programmers for each sector. Or he's suddenly so poor he has to work with 10 people for the whole game? It might even be, since the programmers we see in a devblog are few 30-ish yo guys who sometimes write about their bad healt that week, or their misadventures with their old pc. If the devs were the double, everything would be faster i belive; so i belive that the money Rust makes, are being invested in other projects. Blame me and my opinions again, you can't thouch me ahah.

&gt; If you don't like how they've managed their resources up until now, feel free to play another game. Garry Newman and FP has made it clear they have a vision for Rust and they'll do what they want to stay on the path to achieving that vision.

SGTSolj, your answers to posts are ugly like your videos, sadly. You totally missed the point here. I wrote this post because i love Rust, every other game is boring as hell after you meet Rust. I'm capable of playing maybe 1 round of Dota, or a competitive match on CS:GO but after that, i miss the epic feeling that Rust gives me. My post is not a critic to Rust or its developer, is more of a question on why they make such decisions, why they don't start from the bottom; if you analize how the development of Rust Experimental has gone, you'll notice that it didn't have a pre-made plan, that they changed direction and way many times about each ""argument"" the game has.

When you're solo you know that out there there's full of people ready to rape you; people ask for a balance between solo and groups (or clans as you like); it can't and won't be achieved, because two man works faster than one, and in Rust, in early game it's a matter of speed, in late it's a matter of continuity.

1135,"* longer early game: Various different tiers of all the early game items (more bows, more spears, metal arrows, steel pointed arrows, lots of shields).
* more tiers of resources, stratified so that you can't ever have all in the same spot (not like the green hills in the desert, or the desert close to the woods)
* the game is optimized so good, that the map can be quite bigger than it is now; average official server becomes 1000 players max, with daily average of 500 active players.
* new biomes are added, with new fauna. Like an urban procedurally generated biome, wastelands, fuel stations, ruins.
* player can build everywhere, ""world"" structures are destructible
* AI becomes so good that Facepunch sells it to other companies, PvE becomes so good that governments use Rust to train their Astronauts.
* Top tier Endgame almost unreachable.
* Land, Sea, Air Vehicles. ( small engine Bp, large engine Bp, powerful engine Bp, mighty engine Bp; chassis pieces Bp; wheels Bp for every different biome)
* Electricity, both fuel, and wind generated.
* Stability: 1 crash per month max (lol this game is a mess :D)
* More types of each kind of resource, with different stats
* New structure pieces, new ways to give stability
* Guns require various different bp each to make, so that its longer to have chests full of crafted guns.
* animals can be tamed and breed; horses are the most epic vehicle in the game, remember to leave the bones of dead horses after a raid dude, leave a mark in the heart of somebody.
* cultivation is augmented, also trees give saplings to make naturally new trees. Trees grow slowly showing each phase of growth, when chopped down trees fall, once on the ground hitting it gives wood. Chainsaw is noisy but super cool to use.

**larger groups just kick the shit out of smaller groups.** this is meant to be
**A way to balance that is to add weight to walls, doors etc... so they put pressure directly on what's below, either damaging them a lot (the taller the building, the more time you would have to spend repairing it), or affecting the stability, making it fall apart very easily.** this is pure madness, who tells you that this would balance larger groups with smaller groups? are you mad?
**This way people would be forced (at least early on) to make multiple houses (on different locations), or multiple houses inside a big wall.** which is harder to raid than a super huge base. I play with other 10 people (in your opinion is it a large or medium group?) in more than 10 big houses, nobody ever tried to raid us, because splitting the houses makes any raid harder.
**To prevent the last one, walls should be even more expensive.** walls sucks, you want metal barricade to protect your compound, NO DECAY dude.
**How does this help ? Well, because with multiple buildings and less protected ones , the smaller guys actually have a chance to raid some of them. Not only that, but it would make people walk around the map a bit more, instead of just sitting inside their big tall tower.** this your opinion is based on nothing; the reason why people is sitting in their houses is mostly because they are lazy as fuck; we placed our big compound close to a rad, we storm every people getting in, and raid all day. it's all in the mind of the player.
**Note: A new problem could arise, where groups would just make big clusters of houses, taking much more space.** this is where you understand your thread has no sense.
**A solution for that is adding a limited number of buildings on a certain radius, like 2 houses per cupboard radius. This way they just wouldn't have any more flat terrain to build, and they would be forced to go to a new location.** but here again you totally lose control, Rust is beautiful for, let's say ""x"" reasons, with this suggestion, if applied, it would just suck.",2015-10-30 10:27:35+00:00,cwi7rcw,3.0,t1_cwi6svf,4357.0,playrust

-**Grizzly Bears** as early game mini-boss, that requires a lot of damage to kill and gives a lot of resources.

-**Snakes** in the bushes and wild grass
-**Panthers/Tigers/Lions/Jaguars/Leopards**, hidden during the day, maybe on trees, hunting during the night (you go farming wood and you see yourself attacked from the tree, awesome isn't it?)
-**Small Monkeys**, thorwing rocks and shit to you, from the trees, which might attack you only if you get too close to their tree, and maybe run away and climb another tree if you scare them with shots.
-**Elephants**, roaming in packs, which if aggroed, could follow you until they smash you, even if inside your house (capable of demolishing with huge damage up to wood tier)
-**Hippos**, hiding in the water, killing players if aggroed or hungry, capable of demolishing twig structures

-**Boars** in packs, attacking any hostile foe
-**Sharks** and **Great Whites** in the ocean

this is the answer to why your post doesn't make any sense. The beginning of Rust is intended to be hard, harsh, a bad experience, a period of darkness. 8 hours are maybe a long time for a regular video game, not for an hard-core based game like this.

I agree that this game is grindy, it's intended, at least for the first part of the game. You need resources to survive, then you grind them.

You can't make it faster to get bp, doesn't make sense.

There's no way to tweak solo gaming. Because groups in this game will always be more prepeared, strong, faster, than solos; it's intended. Garry wants you to share your moments with some one, whoever that is.

It's not a matter of how many people play solo, Rust is a concept of crude survival, if you **want** to play solo, just do it without blaming the system, which is not altered to help groups, is just that groups are stronger.",2015-07-07 12:06:22+00:00,csuvjym,1.0,t3_3cd68h,43146.0,playrust
