Sometimes players pick a server without thinking, and sometimes i've read about frustrated players who clearly picked the wrong server (for their free time and skill) and got brutally annihilated. If we consider: the hours per week a player spend on Rust, the number of PvE and PvP hits, and headshots, the deaths/kills ratio, the number of deaths while asleep and suicides, the resources gathered &amp;/or stolen, we would have an approximate ranking value.
If each server keeps track of this value of its (most playing) players, you would obtain the average ranking of that server.
So when a player is deciding what server he might spend few/lot of hours in, could have an approximate knowledge of what kind of challange awaits him, easy, or hard.

we want a bow to cost 200 wood and 50 cloth, we don't want players to cry in agony to be forced to find the right components for it right? so let's say that it is made of *tier 0* components (example: wooden arc 200wood, 1m of reinforced string 50cloth, which are lootable and craftable. Also we don't want players to click to many times to craft a bow, so: you have the raw materials, you hit ""craft bow"", you automatically craft it, skipping the components crafting time, because it is made of *craftable components*; the same goes for *sewing kit*, boring, i want a t-shirt, i can't have it if i don't find the proper components? foolish. Let's say that T-Shirt cost 50 cloth, but you must have in your inventory 1 (*not consumed upon use*) sewing kit, already better isn't it?

Now about mid-tier items; let's say, a revolver, which could be composed of a *metal parts* (tier 0, craftables) a *cylinder* (tier 1, only lootable) and some wood. But that would mean that there would be very low amount of revolvers in the game, so why don't we introduce a new crafting item, the **milling machine** capable of crafting tier 1 components (which translate in being capable of crafting a revolver with 1 click when standing close to it). This milling machine should require tier 0, tier 1, and maybe couple tier 2 components to be crafted.

Do you start getting what i mean? Crafting would become incredibly more deep and interesting (i know lot of people doesn't give a fuck, they just want to pop-in a server, get an AK and kill everybody, not me tho)

So we could have many tiers of *components* and *crafting tables* and *crafting items*:

* **tier 0**: 100% craftables (ignored when crafting low tier items, but lootable; to be considered garbage when hitting end-game) [Stone Spear, Bow, Cross Bow, Metal Sheet Door, Stone Hatchet, etc]

* **tier 1**: lootable, extremely common in barrels, craftable at special work-benches which should be lootable and craftable (but with some effort) [Pipe Shotgun, Revolver, Double Shotgun, *Code Lock*, High Quality Metal Doors, Snap Trap, Metal Hatchet, etc]

* **tier 2**: lootable, less common in barrels, common in military crates, craftable with top tier working-bench [P250, AK, Bolt, Rocket Launcher, Muzzle Boost, etc]

* **tier 3**: special loot of air-drops, rare in military crates, not found else-where; used to craft complex items [Rockets, Turrets, 4X Lens, Laser, etc]

The higher the tier of an item, the bigger the amount of components (from the various tiers) are involved. Some items will require few components, some a huge fucking lot; for example a quarry, it should require INCREDIBLY high amount of components, both common and rare.

There should be many kind of work-benches or crafting items, like *Sewing Kit*, *Anvils*, *Sawmills*, *Milling Machines* (for metal), and so on. I would totally love this. Ok now, thanks for reading, and go on insulting me! :D

* killing will be much more rewarding

what does this means? that Rust will return to be the incredibly hard and scary Hard-Core game it was once. BP and XP were systems about progression, the longer you play, the more things you can craft. With CS you won't have any progress bar, and it's easy to foresee people angry about that, saying that they can't play 24/7 to protect their stuff. Some people will be happy though, like those who prefer low tier fights, primitive weapons. Also if they add components for things like C4 and Rockets, raiding will be different, more rare; lot of lone wolves will have a happier life, not being raided few minutes after map wipe (it will still happen, of course, some lucky RAD scavanger will surely find cool stuff earlier than others). The point is, when CS will come out, there will be (again) lot of hatred posts, and thousands of negative reviews. I will be happy as fuck, since that's exactly what i always hoped for this game, to be the most Hard-Core MMO survival experience ever.

Any body willing to help me achieve this during the first wipe when the XP update will hit? We won't have to wear any clan tag, we'll be free men in a chaotic world! The more we'll be at the beginning, the funnier it will be! Each one will have his own house, with his own cupboard, we basically stay close and protect each other! COME ON LET'S DO THIS!

Blunt weapons could deal damage also on stamina, while piercing and slash damage could give a stamina refill buff.
If you run out of stamina (0), you run slower (like 10-15% slower); your hunger and thirst drains faster; get stunned by blunt weapons (like an animation 0.8-1.5 seconds long).

* ACTIVE admins are those we have today.

* PASSIVE admins can't spawn as newman, can't spawn items/resources or anything, can't modify items or structures, can't use the chat; passive admins can't interact with the game.

* 1. Re-write the whole game with a decent engine, unity is clearly a cheap shit. No, better, write your own engine Garry, we know you could make it. Unity is the problem #1 of Rust. (yes this is a joke, im being sarcastic)
* 2. You should be allowed to lean left and right, crawl, climb with the use of hands.
* 3. The building system should have more shapes, and be more progressive, with something like another 3-4 tiers; you should decide with which tier build, instead of starting with twig, you should be allowed to build directly with your desired material; upgrading such piece would add materials to that piece insted of turning it into something else. Demolishing a piece, should give back part of the materials used to build it.
* 4. Inventory should be reworked totally. Items with different size and weight should occupy different amount of slots. Bags, plastic bags, pouches, shoulder bags should add slots and weight capability when worn. Heavy stuff should need vehicles to be moved, like wooden chariots for early game, armoured truck for late tiers.
* 5. When cutting a tree you should see it fall from a distance; it should make a huge noise, the falling tree should damage things under it depending on the tree. After that you should start picking up wood cutting the wooden boards.
* 6. /kill should be removed. At least on vanilla servers.
* 7. Animals should have more diverse behaviour, them should be aware of possible threats from a bigger distance, retreat or attack accordingly with their profile; wolves should roam the map in packs, attacking possible victims with surpriseing moves and teamplay, staying away of groups; they should bark more when attacking, and howl when there's full moon. Bears should be attracted by buildings, should live in rocky places and woods, any place where they could be a threat, instead of open fields, sitting like Yogi. Deers should go in packs too, they should feel your presence hundreds of meters away, roam the map in search of food and safe places. More animals should be added, a huge variety of creatures, depending on biome mostly. Animals should flee in fear when earing a shot. Most of the animals should be tamable, some raidable, some others breedable.
* 8. The map should have hundreds of buildings built in, it should have its wild and urban parts. The bigger the map, the bigger the ""cities"" you can find in it. It wouldn't be bad to see your base built on the ruins of old buildings. The should be a train station, with rails covered by the vegetation; highways with crushed cars, docks on the shore with crushed boats, loot in every possible form hidden inside, which should not respawn and should be more than what 100 persons can carry. There should be a radio station, where you can (if you give it electricity again) broadcast messages to all those players who find a portable radio.
* 9. You should be allowed to scavange almost every item to get its materials. Materials should be doubled, with some of them being extremely rare and not craftable.
* 10. Cars, trucks, motorbikes, bicycles; many vehicles should be present, most of them being built with different pieces, some of which shouldn't be craftable.
* 11. There should be weapons that you can't craft, but just find. Other player made weapons should be made of pieces, which you can combine to have different weapons. Some attachements should not be craftable.
* 12. There should be a super version of C4, which should deal the same amount of damage, but with the old AoE, maybe costing something like 10-15 times more than regular C4.
* 13. Numpad should allow players to do animations, like waving and such
* 14. Shields should be in the game, allowing right click to actively counter-attack hits. Also two handed melee weapons should allow right-click blocking
* 15. Capes and cloaks should be in the game. With realistic physics and all. I bet all my money that if you add capes and cloaks, this game gains 100k users in couple weeks. (being sarcastic again)
* 16. Flags, flags are essential, with realistic physics and all, as above, add flags and gain players in no time. Both craftable and non-craftable flags.
* 17. Weather effects should be more; wind is missing, wind is important (for bullets, flags, capes, windmills and so on)
* 18. Battering-rams should be in, both hand held and wheel held, for different raids. A big battering ram would need many people to be pushed, ar an engine to be motorized.
* 19. Please add Katana to the game as a non-craftable item. It has to be rare and deadly.
* 20. Sun glasses to remove sun-rays effect which can be a real problem sometimes",playrust,Just another wall of useless suggestions.,https://www.reddit.com/r/playrust/comments/3mmnwg/just_another_wall_of_useless_suggestions/

**Jungle River** between desert and greenland, something like [this](http://www.allabouthappylife.com/wallpaper/dual_monitor/jungle-river-dsc04024-dwp.jpg), where you need a cutting tool to advance through the vegetation; new mobs for enhancing PvE could be added, like snakes, river snakes, alligators and stuff like that. A good river bed, wide enough to allow players to build on them, with water level changing through the lengt of the river, deep jungle full of trees could be a barrier to unprepeared players, with a quick regrowth rate and florid of mob creatures. It would surely add immersion and variety.

**Swamps** could help adding PvE conditions and diverse resources, quicksands, poisonous pools, huge bushes, deep woods, new mobs.

**Canyons** of various dimension could enrich the panorama, adding a good place for caves, hidden rad bases (like area 51 style), coyotes and reptiles, water pools.

A **City Ruin** could be a perfect concept for a biome, imagine a small city of few blocks, maybe close to a small dock on the sea, spawnin destroyed buildings in a procedural way, with even each building having its randomly changing parts; some areas would be radioactive, some others not, allowing players to camp, fight, look for loot.

A **Dormant Volcano** could be interesting, with a flat top where people can build, reducing cold at night; caves and tunnels close to it would have high temperature.
