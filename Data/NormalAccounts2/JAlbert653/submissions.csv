I recently posted on this subreddit [asking for help](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/4s1irs/need_help_diagnosing_my_mom_65_with_possible/) diagnosing ataxia-like symptoms for my mom. In the past week, there have been some developments that I wanted to share. A few days ago, blood tests for IMMUNOGLOBULINS IGG IGA IGM (results below) resulted in doctors putting her on a five-day IVIG treatment. The results so far have been promising as she seems to be talking and walking better. While in the hospital, the doctor's did another CT scan. They noticed about five to six extremely small ""dots"" on various organs. One is on her lung which might suggest small cell carcinoma. However, it is extremely small (I can get the exact measurements) and has not grown since it was last scanned six months ago. It is also in an area that is very difficult to get to so the doctor's decided not to move forward with a biopsy and have ruled it out as the problem. All of the other ""dots"" (located on the pancreas and liver) checked out. She will be discharged tomorrow and is scheduled for a PET scan as an outpatient sometime next week. Since the results below suggest some sort of cancer that is affecting the cerebellum, they are ruling out possible locations one by one. Hoping someone here might have encountered a similar case before. Also, how effective is IVIG treatment? Will it absolutely stop the cerebellum from shrinking and is there any chance the damage can be reversed? Happy to post full test results as well.

I’m hoping someone out there is able to help my mom, 65. About two years ago, she woke up one morning and her coordination/balance was off. She walked in zig-zags and just wasn’t herself. During this time, she began to have horrible vivid nightmares. I can attribute the nightmares to stress concerning money/family problems but she’s never had nightmares like this before. They cause her to scream at the top of her lungs in the middle of the night and thrash around in bed. We can’t wake her up. She thought she might’ve had a stroke but didn’t seek medical attention as she didn’t have insurance. When she finally went to a hospital months later, the CT scan revealed that her cerebellum was shrinking. Her B12 levels were also extremely low and they started her on injections. The doctors thought it could be some case of ataxia. Her doctor wasn’t very helpful so she found another doctor about six months later who was more vested in her case and thought it could be an autoimmune disease instead. He put her back in the hospital and ran more tests. The CT scan showed that her cerebellum was the same size. He ran a lot of other tests and they all came up negative (see below). During her stay, they put her on a heavy IV steroid regiment. That didn’t seem to do anything. When she followed up with her doctor, he tried medication for Parkinson’s but it didn’t help. The doctor is ruling out Parkinson’s Disease and now thinks it might be ataxia as well but he wants to run a DATscan before diagnosing. This test is extremely expensive and her Medicaid won’t cover the full cost. If that test comes up negative, he told us there is no cure for her condition and she will get worse over time. However, her coordination seems to be getting better with physical therapy and the aid of a walker. She does however still fall regularly when she’s walking and always lands on her head. She seems to fall backwards the most during the day (a few times a week). She is so bruised and is extremely depressed over her condition. She is unable to shower, cook, drive and be independent and it makes her very upset that we still don’t know what’s making her sick and it’s been over 2 years. She still has nightmares and falls out of bed in the middle of the night. She’s had so many tests and have seen so many doctors. Is anyone out there able to help lead us in the right direction for a proper diagnosis and treatment? I’ve included some of her most recent tests below. I can also upload her CT scans/MRI results if you’re interested in taking a look. She's had a history of thyroid problems and has been taking Synthroid for a long time at various dosages. She also has Hashimoto's disease.

Here's the full report: http://imgur.com/a/vHITm

Also, she currently takes the following medications: SYNTHROID 75MCG, AMLODIPINE 10MG, ATORVASTATIN 20MG

Thank you so much for your time.

EDIT 1:

I forgot to mention that she was diagnosed with sleep apnea and is getting a CPAP mask. She has very little energy during the day so I hope that will help.
