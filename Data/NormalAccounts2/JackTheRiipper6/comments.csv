0,"Yeah I'm referring to being full health, booping them in the head with it and it just explodes. No seeker comes out and it will do minimal damage.

1,Shatter can work on control but my preference is an annihilation vortex bomb as it covers the entire point and sometimes nets kills in the couple seconds it lingers. It's just preference. I tend to only use lance for rumble or sometimes clash for fun. ,2016-11-18 19:24:56+00:00,da61fe4,3,t1_da4xn4t,70984,CruciblePlaybook
2,Control or swarming (supremacy) maps I use vortex. Sometimes I use shatter if the map has a lot of ceiling clutter lol. Nothing like Nova bombing a rafter when you were aiming at the ground. ,2016-11-17 15:27:51+00:00,da49rmi,1,t3_5dgb03,727,CruciblePlaybook

25,"Just my 2 cents. The more playtime you have the more experienced you are. Doesn't mean you're any better but you do in fact have more experience. QP levels are just a sign of experience. So longer games =  more exp.  On the ranked side of it,  if you beat them insanely quick,  it wasn't much of a challenge. Hence,  less exp. Just an opinion.
