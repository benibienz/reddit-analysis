25,"try saying fixes are simple when youve worked in game development

think of any game whatsoever and the chances of any fix being simple could be buried behind thousands of lines of scripts

im not saying they shouldnt fix shit but for any piece of software this large, saying any fix is ""simple"" is a gross generalization of an issue, not taking into account the other parts of the game that piece of code is supposed to work with and potentially breaking those parts too

say for example you had a respawn point in a game, that respawn point isnt just a position in a 3D map, it's also tied to scripts that decide if that respawn point is the current respawn point, it's also linked to the player and the creation or re-positioning of the player, and when the player respawns that script might also describe what the player loses, what the player gains, if there's any parts of the player that should change after respawning

even that there is a very very basic implementation of a barebones respawn system for a checkpoint-based platformer, not taking into account respawn time, what happens when the player leaves the map, and you have the potential to break all of these things if you try to just ""fix"" one thing. sure, a good programmer would make their code scalable and simple to fix, but it can still only be abstracted so much that the code still works efficiently

now put it into the context of forza, think about all the places you can access these things, what variables are linked to these, e.g car class, top speed, performance index, place in the map, race number, etc and you have a whole mess of things you need to worry about, realize the insane rube-goldberg machine that AAA games are, how many things have to go right in sequence for the game to function at all, and that many issues would have been an oversight for QA if it wasn't absolutely and ridiculously obvious

again this isnt to say that its okay for the game to be a mess as it has been since release, but unless youve worked on the software personally, you have no idea how difficult it is to actually implement whatever ""simple"" fixes you can think of, and chances are, they probably have a checklist of a bunch of much larger backend issues to work on before they get to the QoL fixes",2016-11-16 06:43:48+00:00,da2gf3m,1.0,t3_5d7bin,8056.0,forza

165,"I haven't used the word random either - but think about it this way, if there's a system that bans people using a FH3 trainer, would you not think that this software would also try and detect *ANY* sort of software that tries to access the memory that FH3 uses?

Cheatengine can do the same thing. But let's say you wanted something that put an overlay on the game, something like Discord's overlay option or adding the game as a process to steam which runs on top of the DX12 process of many games already - I'm not saying those triggered it, but what if they could?

Neither of us knows the extent to which the red flag rears it's head when it's scanning for illegitimacy, and as far as I know, any discrepancies that don't match the server information could be just as much as a slow update or a game crash at the wrong place a the wrong time. 

Again, we don't know if it's that, but it's happened before on games such as Blade n Soul where people were actually getting banned for using applications such as Discord being caught by gameguard as ""tampering software"" and such. 

I've seen mass bans where they were all completely justified too - A lot of cheaters have also been banned in Overwatch, and guess where they were complaining? In their own cheating forums dedicated to aimbots and fully admitting that cheating was fun and that Blizzard were spoilsports.

Here, we have streamers who have already admitted they may have tried the drift tap skills a couple times, yet, they were only banned the moment the game crashed. Isn't that interesting? Yet, there's plenty more that haven't yet been banned who have also admitted to using the same ""exploit"". What gives?

176,"I think they dealt with that as I'd expect them to, it really is the responsibility of the developers and if the developers are not allowing it, I'm glad this representative did at least mention they will try and contact them.

Seriously though, if this continues, press on and explicitly state that the developer is not open for discussion. 

Microsoft does not know how their security system works and it's upto Turn10 to fix this issue. The game is built on their server software and their security upon their rules. While Microsoft owns this IP, they did not develop the software. 

Use Microsoft as a way of communicating with them, but remember that they're not directly responsible for a game they did not make, and that even if Microsoft do not contact them, Turn10/Playground Games are too big of a studio for Microsoft to just ""cut off"" if they don't just listen to them. As a publisher, their job is mainly to supply funding for marketing and development. They do not make the game.

Microsoft is as much a business as any company, and while Turn10/Playground Games are handling this very poorly, don't forget that it's them who ultimately have the most agency over their game, mostly because they're the only ones who knows how it works.

Yeah, this is a pretty shitty situation to be in, but imagine how many IPs they own, of course they don't know how each and every one of those IPs operates within their own studios. These customer service reps aren't trained specifically to deal with this game, they can help you with refunds, they can help you with the Microsoft store, what they can't help with is an issue that's borne by the developer who refuses to speak about it.

Don't get angry at this guy, he's not refusing you service - he probably doesn't play the game and doesn't know much about it, and to be honest, I think he's done more than he's supposed to.

Here's some extra advice though; make sure you get your chat transcripts emailed to you, and press the issue, elevate it. If you keep doing it, I'd say it's pretty likely they can TALK to T10 about it (keyword being talk here), but don't expect T10 to do much if anything. Stay level headed until you absolutely need to get angry, and if you want to get angry, do it over the phone. It works better. Most of the time, they'll hand over the phone to a superior or such, I did this for 2 different ISPs and a couple delivery services.

I've spoken to many customer service reps, and you have to realize that they're just regular people like you or me working a job that involves talking to a lot of angry people every day; I stay level headed if I have to, I've dealt with many product returns and RMAs, and with Microsoft specifically, I've had an exceptionally good experience with in terms of customer service. Their live chat service is some of the most responsive and understanding I've used. I know this is not true of everyone, and other people have had different experiences, having heard of horror stories with these kinds of things. Realize that when you're angry at this, you're not just angry at Microsoft or Turn10 or whoever, you're also angry at the guy who has to deal with your issue.

Sorry if I'm repeating myself here, but I really have to make it clear. Microsoft themselves can't unban you or comment on an issue the developers are supposed to deal with. They can only talk to the developers about this, and it's upto the developers to follow through on that.

I'll upvote because this is an issue that needs to be seen.",2016-10-19 17:05:11+00:00,d8yyrhb,1.0,t3_58b4cp,3044.0,forza

It's like putting clouds over my ears, the weight is distributed evenly and I can wear these all day.  I guess they look pretty cool too, especially with these pads. My main problem with most headphones were that they were never comfortable for long periods of time.

I can't say much about the sound since I don't have much to compare them to, and I'm not that experienced with headphones, but at the very least, it had better bass response than I expected from supposedly ""flat"" headphones (though I guess that might be the pads. I'm not sure though, I took off the pleather pads right after.) Also changed the EQ a bit so that the bass was slightly more pronounced, but by very little.

In the end, comfort over long periods of time was what I was looking for, and that's what I got. Sorry I couldn't describe the audio better, but for all I know, it's pretty good.

if you mean why is the background blurry that is very likely your aperture setting

aperture controls the amount of light that will hit the camera sensor on a real DSLR

for example if you look at this image i have purposely turned the aperture up to blur the trees behind the car

While it's bad they aren't saying much about the performance, this isn't just for the PC side of things.

with anything, to give the manufacturer more choice in materials, the more leeway they have in terms of moving and matching these materials, and because they have to use more materials or put them together in more precise arrangements, it will also require more advanced methods of construction, as well as needing rarer materials

it's difficult to put this in a way without referencing other headphones, but to draw from other examples, you're going to get the same results of cars, bikes, computer hardware, guitars, etc

some materials simply have better properties for what they're being used on, like for instance having carbon fibre on bikes or cars is a somewhat expensive material to produce, but is great for the purpose because of it's weight and strength ratio, for the people who can afford it, a carbon fibre bike is going to feel and ride different from an aluminium frame

without experiencing headphones better than what you have now or without the proper equipment, how will you know the difference between what you have experienced compared to say a pair of sennheiser HE-1s?

going back to the crew, places really do feel massive and the distance for landscape details is insane

that said, FH3 is the much better game overall as a game, where the crew fails is that the racing felt cheap and the physics were ballsed up, but by gum its the most immersive game ever if you just turn off the HUD and cruise aimlessly, every time i drive there will be a road i havent yet set tires on, i could just switch off and drive for hours and hours",2016-10-09 23:50:21+00:00,d8l48ne,3.0,t1_d8l3xu1,438.0,forza

like another post said here, it's mostly a direct port from the xbox one, (and let me just say, since the current gen consoles use the same processor architecture as modern PCs, pretty much all xbox one or even PS4 games should be able to run natively without emulation) and you can't really blame them for believing it would just run (cause it sort of does)

My first experience was back when I had my Xbox 360 back within a week after sending it off to Germany after it got the RRoD, fast forward several years later, the chat service was a godsend.

Some guy said he had to call me, cause I'd have to restart my machine - I only had my mobile and he couldn't do international calls, so he asked his supervisor, and got permission to do so. Literally stayed up with me at 4am in the morning (after-hours in his time) to make sure my machine was working at the end of it all. 

We were just sitting there waiting for the computer to sort itself out, we talked about the weather, just some small talk, and eventually my machine was up and running again. I still remember his name and I think I still have the entire chat log somewhere (excluding the call).

==========

also op im not sure if you drive a car IRL or if the settings are backwards but you should want 1:1 response, so the steering should be completely linear

if its not linear your ""moving less"" will translate to more extreme movements near the edge of your range (or the other way round, a ""softening"" effect near the end), which could be fine if you're used to it, but in a real car, the amount you steer is the amount you get

non-linear steering response is a good option for gamepads because it allows you to be precise while acting against a spring with no force feedback, let me draw a crappy graph of what non-linear steering looks like

http://i.imgur.com/zWv8WFL.png

basically non-linear steering is unrealistic, i havent tried my wheel yet on FH3 since my desktop GPU is still fried but that doesnt mean you shouldnt play the way you want to as long as you enjoy it, im not sure if the linearity of the steering is messed up in the game but it should be 1:1 at 50",2016-10-07 21:44:12+00:00,d8ignz3,1.0,t3_56aong,41022.0,forza

494,"I'm not saying they're doing anything wrong - if they want to bring out their game the best they can (the MMO), it's going to see a lot of refinement, and don't get me wrong, of course that takes time. I know about prototyping, and how important it is to get the product working as well as possible out of the box, but as much as you can say ""we're on the right track"", this doesn't change that a lot of people are going to feel anxious about hearing that over and over again, and unfortunately it's become a huge kickstarter joke.

I don't think I'd be wrong in saying both of us would like to see those people proven wrong, and it's very likely that we eventually will. Perhaps I did think of SQ42 being less of a big part of the game as I thought, but on an earlier point, I wouldn't have said ""reckless"", but the total workload they need to put in to make those changes they could've overlooked due to either slight lack of foresight or otherwise; for a project of this scale, I'd imagine it would've been something they could've anticipated a little better, but what do I know? For a game this large, waterfall would've seemed like the safer choice, and if it was a situation where they were using an scrum approach (not saying it isn't, I can't exactly see inside their studios), wouldn't it be normal for them to incorporate new directions and approaches for problems?

Don't think I don't want this to be as successful any less than you do, it's a big game and big games need a lot of time. A lot of this technology is leaps and bounds away from what any other game has achieved, and to put it in a production game we can actually see the release of is no small feat; we know it's going to take a while, but again, you can't exactly blame some people for being a bit impatient if they aren't game devs.

In the end, good project management doesn't just mean they're keeping on track. This train, as large and powerful as it is, is very much on the rails, but running late (or at least, not arriving when they said they would). The passengers aren't going to be happy about that, but after all, all they can do is wait till they arrive.

Again, I'm not saying it won't ever come out, and I know that Chris had always had a history for his games running over budget and long past predicted release date, but those games still managed to be pretty great in the end, and I don't want any less.

If you don't think the transition from planets or hyperspace jumps are ""seamless"" in the idea that they shouldn't be used as loading screens, I'd personally say they did a great job with those - you go through hyperspace, you never really have anything in the game that's non-digetic (apart from galnet and powerplay I guess), but still, it achieves what a lot of games cannot without a ui system that incorporates loading screens and such - you're still in a ship looking at the HUD while you travel between systems and interact with station menus (and I'd imagine the current transitions for SRV and fighters would change too once space legs rolls around).

Of course this is all still speculation and neither of us can say for sure whichever one of use is right - I wish the best for SC and I hope the fans get the game they deserve, but one thing that I do agree with that article is that SC's development seems to be running away with itself, and I'm not saying they're not getting any work done, but I don't think it's a good idea to put in more things before you consider it a product you've finished, especially when it's seemingly random modules being built independently. 

Seamless it may or may not be, I can see how Elite's framework leaves it's doors open, and I don't think I can say the same for SC's approach from the pieces they have to eventually bolt together.

Un-packing and editing is a different story though, I haven't seen any myself but I think frontier use their own method of archiving textures. Any third-party editor of that would have to be able to know how to decrypt/decompress those.

The most I've seen people do is move around files from other ships rather than actually being able to edit the files and being able to see things such as text you've put on a ship from a texture (that isn't photoshopped, of course)

you're right about it being clientside though - the server knows what paintjob you have, but the game running on your computer doesn't, it only reads the file name and loads it in as long as it has the right name.",2016-09-23 22:10:53+00:00,d7zgita,3.0,t1_d7y162u,88423.0,EliteDangerous

As far as something such as paintjobs or textures go, it won't affect anyone's play experience but your own, nor will the servers check if your paintjob is the same as what they have - I doubt that the servers even have many if any assets at all, as things such as textures are not only inefficient to load from servers, but having to check them would be like downloading the textures themselves

to actually check for file consistency with the files on the servers, and even then, that does not guarantee they will even check the contents of the files (which would take as long as downloading the game itself if you were to go through every file)

plenty of people have changed or edited the game's files before without any penalties, either way preparing compute shaders is a local process and ultimately for the benefit of your own game, if frontier has to rely on enabling shader cache in the options as an anti-cheat measure that will send data to their servers, then it's not a very effective system if people can simply disable it, as turning it off will stop that process",2016-09-23 21:56:14+00:00,d7zfyn2,5.0,t1_d7yqzy7,34418.0,EliteDangerous

you'd be comparing it to other FFB sticks, likewise with wheels, the G27/29 would be around the ""average"" range, the ""affordable"" option there would refer to something such as a Driving Force GT, which has simple force feedback and is much cheaper than the go-to option for most people.

That said, I much prefer the styling of the x55 over the 56, that's about it though.

the worst problem for me was that i was creating divots in the base simply by pitching the ship with the x55, which doesn't seem to be happening at all on the x56",2016-09-17 04:31:31+00:00,d7q7tth,5.0,t1_d7ooqx5,95961.0,EliteDangerous
547,"x56 was much better than the x55 from my experience

Whilst the design was questionable, my x55's stick base developed divots and cracks from pulling up and rolling, which made trying to go from full -X to +X while stick is completely pulled back awful, cause you could feel the divot every time you made that transition

two of the hats lost the tactile ""click"" on my stick in multiple directions, mostly in the places where I used the direction the most. This made it very difficult to actually use the directional buttons and sometimes you would accidentally activate a button, because you couldn't feel the click

the X axis for some reason had a lot of drift when there was no input, no matter how many times I calibrated it. it would end up having a deadzone I'd have to set at about .6-1%, which was horrible compared to the .2-ish for the y axis

the button behind the throttle I used for boost became soft too, which also lost it's click, and my FA button was going the same way. 

All these problems developed within 3-6 months of owning the x55, none of which I've had on the x56, which overall just seems to be better in terms of build quality. I'm not saying it's a great improvement, and I actually didn't buy the x56 - they offered to replace it for those very reasons I stated above.

Again, not saying it's a brilliant stick, as there are much better options out there for the price, such as CH Products or VKB, but I much prefer it over the mess of an x55 I had. The only thing I preferred over the x56 with the 55 was the overall design, otherwise the x56 is (anecdotally) a better stick.",2016-09-17 04:27:20+00:00,d7q7pmu,3.0,t1_d7okdym,102153.0,EliteDangerous

Other than rotation using a mouse (plus the amount of buttons depends on your HOTAS) generally any decent hotas will give you complete analogue control over lateral, vertical, throttle, and all rotations, with enough buttons to spare. 

I have everything bound on my X-56 with 13 buttons and 4 axes to spare, overall you have finer control over all possible analogue axes of movement

I won't disagree with you in that learning how to use a HOTAS is leaning a new way to control altogether, much like driving a car for the first time, but play long enough with it and everything becomes muscle memory, and you wouldn't have it any other way once you're very familiar with it.

Calling it a grind though, that's what I'd call working minimum wage for ages - you could do the same in Elite, and the ones who keep playing simply love the experience of being a space pilot enough to keep doing it, and then there are those who don't, which is fair.

When I play Elite though, I don't feel the ""working hard"", I don't feel obligated to do anything whatsoever, I do things because I want to and it happens to make money. Every time I pull up to a station, every time I finally touchdown on the landing pad, these small feats that would've taken you the first tens of hours to get right in the game still feel good after a thousand landings, and I can't get enough of it.

When I think about pilots in real life, they don't just end up pilots because they just picked a job out of a hat and decided to follow it - they've wanted to become one ever since they were a kid, paid for expensive flight schools and such, and the experience of simply being able to fly and get paid for what they enjoy is how I feel about Elite.

On the contrary, I'm not exactly difficult to impress, simply going from station to station for me is a great experience every time, I could only imagine how I'd feel once atmospheric landings are introduced.

Whatever he did, it still detrimented you in some way, and it's the same in Elite, you're set back on the insurance cost and you might start to fear coming across other players more. 

Whether or not he was doing it just for laughs or if he was roleplaying shouldn't be any different from asking a burglar why he stole your car; you're still a car down and you're not going to let him off if he just told you he was roleplaying a car theif.

Yaw isn't left and right travelling laterally, that's simply lateral thrust
Yaw is a rotation on the Y axis, e.g like turning a car

Pitch is rotation on the X axis and roll is rotation on the Z axis

Pedals are used for controlling Yaw

Look at all these companies now relocating, Businesses could simply move offices to Dublin or Frankfurt and continue doing business with the clients they already have, and this is happening right now. 

We're not goods producers, and we're in no place to be, and we're not in a strong position to make trade deals because while we were one of the EU's biggest economies, we were still but one chunk of a massive pie with other fairly large chunks that are still part of the EU.

We're still but one entity vs everywhere else in the world - they're not missing out when they literally have a hundred other countries or so to trade with. Meanwhile, we absolutely need a trade deal to replace that big chunk we just cut off. 

Let's say the other countries in the EU didn't matter, and all in all there were 6 members in the EU, all equally contribution to the total - For the sake of this, we'll exclude the trade from anywhere else, as the EU is by far, our largest trading partner, AND that trades go through the EU before they get to us.

Even better perhaps would be to use distance from an edge plane so there's no fixed fade-in time that could look unrealistic

For a less scripty way of doing it, you could use the standard assets materials to make a sort of smoky/misty area with a particle system.

These are just guidelines and you should feel free to get any size you want really, but this should help as a good starting point. A 7.5 isn't that much bigger than a mid-size so it would probably be fine either way

This is a good suggestion, as I've seen many people put $100+ into their first board, which isn't exactly the best thing for someone starting out on something they haven't even tried yet, but some schools of thought say if you buy an expensive board, you'll want to use it and have a better experience because of the nicer bearings, feel, etc. I've seen people get good at boarding from both, so whatever floats your boat OP",2016-06-13 14:45:43+00:00,d47cdlp,6.0,t1_d473zej,19247.0,NewSkaters

865,"They're usually sold without grip tape, making it difficult to reposition your feet as well as having less surface area to stand on, which means your weight is distributed and concentrated over a smaller area

Penny boards don't exactly have a good reputation amongst people who ride standard decks, because their low price makes them attractive to new skaters, what they don't realize is that they are also assembled without grip tape (which helps a lot with keeping your feet on the board) which is one of the reasons why they're cheaper, as well as not needing any special manufacturing processes like pressing the concave and kicktails shapes into 7 ply maple wood. Penny boards do not have this concave, which helps a lot with carving too.

This is why a standard deck is not only easier to ride, but more suited to tricks too.

I have nothing against Penny boards personally, but they're a dangerous trap for beginners because of the aforementioned reasons, and they're usually better for experienced skateboarders who want a challenge or to try out something different.

Committing and failing not only helps you figure out what you can't do, it also means you learn how to fall the next time because you know how the board behaves when you do mess it up.

868,"Ricta clouds have a lot of grip and are soft and quiet, mainly made for filming and cruising - if you're starting out, you'll find it very difficult to do shove-its and reverts or slides, because you'll also have to get air to prevent the wheel from gripping too much, unless there is literally no decent flatground areas around you such as big empty parking lots and such with good paving or a skatepark. If you do, you can't go wrong with a set of 99a spitfire classics. 

EDIT: Didn't really see the part about cruising mainly, 86A Ricta clouds would be perfectly fine for most urban terrain, good call. As for wheel size, that depends on your trucks, OP.

I wouldn't get an 8 inch deck either, the guy being 5'3. That's just about the range you should be in when you start using 7.5 in boards, with an 8 inch deck, they're going to be heavier and more difficult to flip about, as well as more expensive. Even some larger skateboarders who are supposed to use 8 inch decks might prefer smaller decks if only for being easier to flip, and have superior balance meaning a smaller board isn't necessarily a problem for them.

Indie trucks are also quite expensive for a beginner looking to get their first board - they're great and will outlive the second coming of jesus, but for someone starting out skateboarding, it's not exactly easy for someone to spring $~60+ dollars on just the things that holds the wheels and bearings when they don't even know how to skateboard yet. 

[Warehouse skateboards ](https://www.warehouseskateboards.com/help/Skateboards-Getting-Started) have some really good guides about setting up your board. Depending on whether OP wants to build it themselves or buy a complete (usually cheaper and will normally come with the right size for everything, as long as it's from a refutable skate shop, should avoid problems like getting wheels that are big enough to easily cause wheel bite).

For OP, I'd recommend around 7.5 or even a 7.75 if you think you can grow into it, there are definitely some brands better for certain things out there but I could spend the entire day recommending different parts. If you want to know more about parts, OP can shoot me a PM and I'll provide some tips - I don't know everything, but I'll do my best to help.

It's like saying someone's selfish for spending money on a car and not sharing it with the rest of the neighborhood, it's simply not their work and the mod authors can do with it as they please.

It's the same as making art or music - you make it because you want to, not because you have to, and you make what you want for yourself or who you want. 

Anyone who wants to make mods for consoles can do the same - they can learn how to mod, and they don't have to do the same for PC or PS4. It's not selfish or lazy - they should still be the authors of that content and have control over it.

If I were to play, now I'd just do what I wanted to do, which probably won't involve spending a lot of time trying to get a weapon or some module, but just landing on interesting looking things with friends or just helping each other with random missions. 

I know I'm not going to ""progress"" that way, but when I play a game, I'm going to do the things that I liked the most, like you said, you could say I had nothing else to do, but that's if I wanted to get the absolute best gear.

902,"How difficult is skateboarding to get into? I've been snowboarding before on a holiday before and enjoyed it, but I live in the UK so unless I move to Aspen or something I don't really have access to it. 

Right now, I have a parts list set up with the help of a friend, but the price is pretty steep for something I don't know I'm going to invest myself in  - If I liked it, I'd easily spend this much, but again, I don't want to put too much money in something I have no idea if I'll like. I've read that just skating on cheap options will break easy and you won't really enjoy having your first sessions on bad hardware.

Recently, I've come to watching a lot of youtube videos (you can guess which channel I've probably been seeing a lot of :) ) and I've just been thinking to myself about how much fun they're having.

Another thing is that I'm the sort of person to put a lot of money into something without really thinking about it, and then sorta forgetting about it, but those things are also somewhat difficult to set up or are too cumbersome for me to use on a daily basis. 

A skateboard's just there and you can just step on it and use it, a bike is cumbersome to carry around, if I put on my inline skates I have to keep them on until I get home unless I want to carry around a pair of shoes (and then skates); the skateboard just seems to be simple and convenient. It's both easy to carry and easy to just step on and use. (Not saying it's easy to use in itself, just you don't have to mount it like a bike, and not as much of a hassle as skates).

Please, tell me about your starting experiences, if you've invested a lot in a skateboard at the start or such, and what kept you skateboarding, it looks really cool and the culture seems awesome to me, I just want to know if it's something I can just practice anytime anywhere, or even at home, maybe if you've even had snowboarding experience to compare ",2016-05-16 14:42:37+00:00,d37ii76,1.0,t3_4jaldn,196737.0,skateboarding

Of course I don't know what's going to happen, but it's not difficult to believe it will be more of the same. The same feedback which comments on ""fun"" simply hasn't been addressed yet, and again, other things must've been reformed in the first place to make the pursuit of progression not conflict with your playstyle

Yes, nobody knows what it's like yet,  unfortunately given the past mistakes of previous updates, those issues still haven't been directly solved yet. If not now, when can we expect anything to change? For your example, if they wanted to expand, I'd imagine there are a variety of ways you can go about that. If you're someone who despises exploring, the faction wouldn't want you to do that; you probably don't even have an exploration ship.  

But if you were, let's say you joined this faction with an above-average rank in Exploration, most of your given missions might be suited towards it. The potential rewards after a couple would perhaps serve to make a better experience for you, such as an engineer offering a special type of shield built specifically for planetary landing impacts, or a more fuel-efficient FSD, so you can enjoy better what you already like doing.

It won't be limited to that, however; perhaps there might be one or two simple combat missions if you want to try something else. Same thing happens there, except you'll get more combat capability options.

Not knowing what it's going to be like doesn't mean we can't criticise what it's being built upon, as it's remained largely unchanged for such a long time. I think you can understand my concern for how this will turn out. If I'm wrong and it turns out great, nothing needs to be said, and this post will simply disappear, and believe me, that would be the best outcome. 

However, if I'm right, many people will have seen this coming, and it's better to have said it early. We all have our own speculations of how things might turn out, and I really do hope it doesn't end up being the way it's always been; this delay has given me some hope and they have said they're making an overhaul to the mission system as a whole, so it won't be completely out of question.

You're not wrong though, a lot of my friends get bored of it, and there's really not a lot to do, yet I'm 700+ hours in and counting

At this point it's tough for me to call it a game; I just love simply flying the ships. I'm not sure exactly how much this has to do with it, but I have a throttle and stick setup for Elite, and I'm fairly big on sims (Also have a FFB racing wheel), and you might say I'm not even particularly good at these games, but the experience of controlling the vehicle alone is something I enjoy a lot.

If you think about a game like Euro Truck Simulator, and forget about the aspect of challenge or management (which are good in their own rights, and partly what Elite is missing in my mind), the simple act of driving down a highway alongside some rolling plains would be akin to the times I spend exploring in Elite, landing on random planets without any particular aim to see if I can get to see some nice mountains. 

(You can skip this next paragraph as it's a bit of a ramble)

Same with The Crew - it's not a particularly good ""racing"" game, but I'd happily cruise for hours just to enjoy the scenery at my own leisure (behind a racing wheel, of course.) I honestly don't know how much I'd enjoy it without the peripherals. I'm not saying you HAVE to use X or Y to enjoy a game like this, as there are many who just play Elite with keyboard + mouse. That said, I can at least say (after having tried Elite, Dirt Rally and  with KBM and Gamepad) that **personally** I can play for much longer at a time if I'm using ""sim"" controls for any game. Again, this isn't to say that it's necessary for you to enjoy the game, these are just my experiences.

I love Elite to bits for those fleeting moments of wonder, but as far as the game goes, Horizons specifically might as well be a tech demo rather than a DLC. Another problem in the subreddit is that people keep mentioning that the game doens't have ""depth"", but we don't even know what ""depth"" it's missing is exactly. The game sounds great on the taglines, blah blah space missions, factions you can join, even player groups that are recognized by the game, but the way in which you can interact with any of those is very limited. Maybe it's just the way the game is built, but it's hard for me to see small ways in which the game could be improved.

People say things like ""ship boarding"" and ""base building"", which frankly sounds ridiculous to me, not because I don't believe it can't be done eventually, but things like that are too general and would have to go through a lot of consultation and testing to get right. I don't want to have a base building system in-game by next month if it's going to be broken as heck and require grinding that doesn't make sense. (e.g, like we currently have sitting at a station paying millions in donations for hours just to rank up to buy a ship)

I want it to feel fun and organic, I won't want to feel like I'm having to grind for the ship like a job I hate, and often times, when people get the ship, they don't know what to do next. The game's activities and rewards just plain don't make sense sometimes. 

One example is there's a faction you can align with, which have an exploration-based agenda. When you get to whatever tier of that, you get a bonus of 2x payout of your exploration findings. Here's the stupid part:

Now some of this may not be entirely accurate, but I know most of this to be the truth.

1. You have to grind to advance tiers, and I believe you have to wait till the next week to be promoted or such. 

2. These activities are the same activities for other factions, which are namely combat and trading.

3. When you are aligned, rivals will attack you - some of these activities will ask you to go to other systems and such to do this.

4. This will decay unless you work to maintain it.

Rant ahead:

For Explorers, this is incredibly dumb, because not only are you asked to participate in activities you may have no interest in, you are also likely exploring for weeks. You're not going to get that bonus when you get back, UNLESS you grind out those tiers before you sell that data. 

In addition to that, there is no insurance for your exploration data, and it is not ship bound, it is life-bound. If you switch to another ship and die, you lose that data, and it makes no difference whether it's 3 days worth of data, or several months worth of data. That data doesn't become part of your assets until you sell it.

The only way to get that bonus for your hard work exploring out for months is to spend a week in the systems grinding our for that tier in which you get it, doing missions that are potentially dangerous, in which you could lose hundreds of millions worth of data. 

Now I know that is a high risk/reward scenario, but it just doesn't make sense that a faction that wants you to explore would put such a large amount of data at risk so they can pay you twice as much for it in the next week, despite you not having seen combat for possibly months.

I've gone on for a bit too long here, but you get the message. There's a lot of odd and confusing gameplay choices made here and there that reward you for doing things you might not want to do, some not too different from your run-of-the-mill fetch X or kill Y of Z quests. If you don't want to do those, your options are either explore, trade, or bounty hunt, all of which don't take that much effort to learn before the deceptive difficulty curve starts to flatten.

The people I know who have played the longest have either found other ways to have fun that aren't necessarily built into the game, but came organically from the desire to play something that isn't there (e.g Elite Racers), are invested heavily into RP and player groups, and those who just enjoy the experience of flying like me. (I should mention, it's been a very long time since I last did any missions, and I'm also not aligned to any factions/powers for the reasons stated above.)

1035,"Even a slightly lower jump range can affect your course wildly, let alone one that's a third slower than an Asp. Getting around within systems is fine, but lets say you had to do 30-ish jumps to get 1000 lightyears in a 30ly ship, having a 20ly ship doesn't mean you'll have to do 50. 

As you know, stars are not evenly spaced apart; let's say a lot of the stars in your area were 23-28 ly apart, simply dropping to 20 will increase the amount of jumps you'll have to make exponentially, and because there are few stars in your jump range, courses will plot detours that might even loop you backwards in order to find a way around in which the stars are all close enough 

Sure, I can get around the inhabited bubble in a 14ly ship just fine, but it might be say 21+ jumps for something that might take an Asp 6 jumps because of all the rerouting and detours the course plotter has to make so that your ship can actually jump within range.

Right now, the textures are in Frontier's own format, and there are no toolkits out to either convert or create them as they are - release one of those or use a more standardized format for textures such as .dds and you can make your own, clientside. You can choose whatever paintjob you want to replace, but to everyone else, they'll still see the original of that, which is fine by me, UNLESS they have that same paintjob ""mod pack"" which you can repackage yourself and share to others who want to look at the same paintjobs.

1061,"It's not just about touch typing, in VR, you're pretty much in a different place without a desk. You're still reaching for an invisible keyboard in front of you, you're not just touch typing, you're feeling the air for a keyboard you don't see in front of you

I can type fine as long as I can sense there's a big rectangle in my periphery, but when it's invisible, it's difficult to tell how far you're sitting away from it, where exactly it is, how high it is above the ground, etc. Once you get to it, you're still trying to approximate the distance between keys without being able to see your where your hands are exactly - It's possible to type, but you use more senses than you think when you're typing; you're trying to hit keys on an invisible keyboard with invisible hands somewhere in the immediate area in front of you, VR best practices often avoid keyboard controls if possible. 

With a gamepad, your hands aren't going anywhere, and if they do, you can reach all the buttons when you grab it again anyway in the standard position, that or you have controllers that can sense your hand positions in space. With a keyboard, most people type with their hands hovering above it, so it's very difficult to get a ""default"" positioning without first feeling out for the F and J nubs and keeping your hands there. 

Again, it's not impossible, it's just people often don't know how much they're using their periphery ""senses"", even when touch typing. Try to type with your eyes closed, and then when you try to use backspace to correct yourself, you'll see what I mean - your hands lose their sense of position, though I guess that isn't a problem for you if you have perfect typing discipline :)",2016-03-21 19:23:28+00:00,d1879o7,3.0,t1_d17deyb,63885.0,EliteDangerous

1188,"The CH throttle and stick set don't compromise on build quality, and is one of the best HOTAS sets you can use, and will last you a lifetime, but yes, it is a lot to ask for.

I'm going to suggest you don't spend so much in something you're not sure about, as you'll never know if you'll really like it until you've spent some time with it, so getting a set like that isn't ideal if you don't know how you're going to fare with it.

To answer your question though, no; it is absolutely not necessary. Many players, particularly PvP enjoy playing with Keyboard and Mouse. I know many that do, and are quite good at it. KBM is more than enough.

That isn't to say that a HOTAS isn't good, as with any sim, building a game around the controls you want it to be directly compatible with works very well - like racing sins with a force feedback wheel, it does a better job of mimicking the controls you would have of a car than any gamepad would. No, it's not necessary to play the game, but it definitely amplifies the experience of flying as you would an actual aircraft and such. As I've said, I wouldn't invest so much in a first stick before you know how you feel with it, as I also recall many who have tried, but simply prefer KBM or gamepad, which brings me onto my next paragraph.

Elite also works quite well with a gamepad, and I don't need any other example than the players on Xbox One - Frontier has done a great job with all the controls. One of the controllers I've tried it with is the Dualshock 4, and I can speak for it when I say it works well. Elite isn't particularly difficult to run, so for the person with a gaming laptop, this is often a good choice if you want to play Elite on the go. If you find that you run out of buttons to bind, is also possible to bind modifiers and button combos to be able to use as many of the controls as you want.

In the end, many players of Elite all have their own control preferences, and having played with all the above, it's a game with well-designed controls all-round. You don't need a HOTAS, you just need to play with what you feel most comfortable with. :)",2016-03-03 16:11:09+00:00,d0m4lr5,1.0,t3_48s4er,7244.0,EliteDangerous

Again, I don't speak with any experience, but I believe it's possible to have a diverse system for this without making it look like random garbage either.

1410,"I think it depends on the tree you pick for it, generally, you have to hit it first time, and get the next stage before 10 secs has elapsed (when your fists stop flaming)

It's the easiest to stack during a stun, because you can then just shin kick and then hit the next stage and repeat. 

Otherwise, you can use leading palm on first strike, follow up with searing palm (leading palm has a 18s recharge I believe), use tiger strike (2) to allow hellfire kick which also can follow with another stage of searing palm, there are others but I can't recall them, but by the time you hit 4, leading palm could've recharged so you have an easy ticket to activate it if you need it

you can also use your rising dragon to stun instead of knockdown, which prepared shin kick and can help initiate stuns on bosses as well as instantly allowing shin kick on regular mobs

I'm not great at it and I'm still working it out, but it feels great to land a complete SP, basically: you have 10 seconds to use the next SP after each use, so try to figure out combos where you can reach the 4th stage with room for flexibility in case you miss with leading palm or something, there's probably a guide out there that explains this much better than me, and I can't check right now cause I'm not home, but it's not that difficult to get the hang of",2016-02-04 13:54:58+00:00,cznicx6,3.0,t1_cznfwx5,6335.0,bladeandsoul

I mean, ship boarding is one of the things I'm fine with the game not having actually, but I understand it's something a lot of people want.

One thing though, even if they did hand out Anacondas, perhaps they wouldn't be able to outfit them either, and as for the repairing in anarchy only, it could be more than they could afford for the big ships. 

You're absolutely right though, it requires a lot of thought and I'm no game designer.

1422,"Here's some ideas about how I imagine this might happen if it does, could be completely different though:

If you are able to hijack a ship (in most cases, they may as well be dead depending on damage done enough to render the ship boardable) the ship owner can pay insurance for a rebuy, but you get to fly their ship until you die in it. (It's not insured, and you can only repair it at anarchy stations or something.) You will not be able to trade in a hijacked ship, but you may still use the black market.

You keep whatever cargo's in the ship, but it will all be marked as stolen and depending on the damage taken, some of that cargo is lost

You can choose to let them keep their ship, but you can also threaten the pilot to jettison cargo as abandoned whilst inside the ship and threatening to take it

the bigger ships will have much more interior space, making it easier to hide, and the pilot has notification of hull intrusion, which means they also have the option to turn off life support (better life support only affects the current pilot, the invader then has a fixed amount of suit oxygen to get to the cockpit).

Perhaps the meta can be expanded upon by players learning the interiors of the larger ships, and finding the best routes to the cockpit (or even the inside of the cargo bay and allowing them to break hatch from inside), getting better and better at finding their way around hijacked ships. Perhaps even having access to systems such as finding a control panel to override pilot's power management, or disabling auto-repair temporarily. Stealth is also an option, such a stowing away.

Larger player ships are generally a lot harder to take down than smaller ships, so people will fish in the pond they can handle - but it's still possible if the pilot's good enough to take one on and win, whatever the goal may be. Larger player ships may also be tackled by groups, perhaps multi-crew might allow people within the ships to leave the bridge and try to apprehend the intruder.",2016-02-03 01:14:06+00:00,czlpz0m,1.0,t3_43wkd5,11476.0,EliteDangerous

if you were perhaps running quests and there were a lot of people killing all the mobs before you could reach them, you could switch to a different instance of that area with a different pool of people.

I haven't tried channel switching yet so I don't know if there are any indicators of channel fullness, but if you can see the one with the least people, those are ideal for questing, or if you just want to be in a channel with your party.

While it's obviously not a perfect solution since it doesn't help with some channels but it's great if I just want to chat with people in my vicinity or just specifically with my party

Also:
Do these bots take up server space too? That's a whole load of crap

I'm no programmer but perhaps they could scan repeated text between all bots and for the whole region in general and it would be dynamic, if you tried to type out the same message it would just tell you that you can't submit it, or that it will just be asterisked out so the sellers wouldn't be able to send anything.

1. Navigate to the executable path

4. Backup the default files in the default paintjob
5. Look for any other paintjob for any other ship, copy the default files into the other ship's default paintjob folder, alternatively you could delete the default paintjob.

this won't work for all paintjobs, you might have to try paintjobs for other ships if some don't work.

This only works if you initialize the paintjob without previous paints, and your ship paint must be set to default. If you set it to default and it doesn't change, leave it at default and restart the game. The game will either think it's using the right textures, or load white because it can't find the right ones.

Horizons is cool, but not $70 cool.

Horizons is an amazing showcase of Frontier's ability, and by gum what their Engine can do will make you gawk, but that alone won't be able to sate your appetite for action and fun.

Horizons is an expensive tech demo right now, and what a tech demo it is. It's an incredible demonstration of what the Engine is capable of, but it's only the framework for a game.

 But if you're really looking to know how to refuel, you can use your wave scanner on the SRV (the arc above the radar that makes noises with the scratchy blips appearing) to follow ""loud"" signals to rocks. Shoot the rocks, and you can collect sulphur and phosphorous, which can be used to synthesize an ""SRV Refuel"" from the right-hand side panel under the ""inventory"" tab in the ""synthesis"" section. Also note that materials are part of your pilot inventory, and will stay with you even if you die or lose your ship/SRV, so collecting a lot of rocks and materials is useful. You can also synthesize SRV repairs and ammo.

The X-55 was great with all it's buttons when I moved onto it, but the one thing that would make the stick perfect wouldve been adjustable detents.

why I still play Elite despite all of these problems is because I'm a weirdo and I really like how it feels to fly a ship, and I can definitely understand how the actual gameplay built around the cool spaceflight feels when it's barely there

combat is one of the few aspects that has some depth but for most people who will never see PvP or you're still sitting in your first viper, the majority of people who are actively PvPing are already in Pythons and FDLs, and fighting an NPC is predictable and easy to manipulate

FD could put as many things in this game as they want but without any meaningful way to interact with the world you might as well be playing Space Engine or Universe Sandbox

Think about how you gawked at the pretty sound and world design, and how quickly that lost it's appeal when you tried to look for fun rewarding gameplay then realized your agency in the world is fairly limited and you can't do much besides look at nice things, I still play the game for my simpleton spaceflight fill, but FD shouldn't be surprised when people complain that when a ***game*** is missing, well, ***game***play...

There are a couple of brands out there for this stuff, if you really want to get into it, try a few of them out, and don't make yourself stressed over not sticking to it; just have food if you want it.

Additionally, I'm not sure about other companies, but I know Queal sells 2400kcal packs for those with a larger appetite. You might want to browse around some sites to see if others do bags, RTD products with a different amount of calories, and if you're working on losing weight, perhaps start off with the 2400kcal, and then move onto buying a combination of 2400 and 2100, perhaps alternate bags for a day.

1752,"Well that's not exactly correct, pressure is different from gravity and the larger the sun as well as taking into account the density of the sun, that would affect the tidal forces

also you fuel scoop in super cruise which is effectively enough speed so that you don't have to care about orbit that much

for the same reason that stellar mass black holes are more dangerous than a supermassive black hole due to intense tidal forces (gravity that increases exponentially within a small amount of space), which is why you have that huge danger zone when flying near a neutron star or a white dwarf, much more dangerous than any ""normal"" sequence star

Atmospheric pressure is another thing entirely, there are places too deep on Earth that current technology cannot explore simply because nothing can withstand the pressure. if you imagine a can of aerosol exploding, imagine the same thing from the outside, if you dip you hand in water, you can feel the water pressing lightly against your hand - the deeper you push your hand into the water, the more pressure is exerted onto you, which is why deep-sea diving requires special suits designed to withstand high-pressure, there was a rather gruesome story once about divers coming out from an oil rig where they accidentally decompressed too fast, and, well, one guy literally exploded into a fine mist of blood and chunks of guts. 

This video might help explain it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4RLOo6bchU
Basically, the creaking at the end is the ship beginning to get crushed by the sheer density of the water acting against every surface of the ship; the closer to the earth's core you are, the denser things get, and basically there's a lot of empty space in the ship and ship's material that gravity doesn't like at that depth",2015-11-09 00:12:41+00:00,cwtgq30,4.0,t1_cwt8at0,12437.0,EliteDangerous

There was no ""original"" operating system installed on this platform, for all intents and purposes, it's practically a ""new"" computer with W10 installed from it's first boot with a genuine product key. Windows 10 is the first, and the only OS to have been used with all these parts, save for the GPU and the PSU.

I had Windows 7 on the build with all the old parts, but the same GPU had no issues with that. I couldn't use the upgrade route as my copy of Windows 7 was bootloaded, but I did have a perfectly legitimate W10 key from my university, which is also transferrable. Apart from the game freezing, W10 seems to run fine. 

I should mention the freezing happens randomly and fairly seldom, the issue does not seem to be getting worse (progressively shorter amount of playtime before the game freezes) and usually happens a few hours or so into the game session.

Basically an entire platform upgrade among other things, everything apart from the case, GPU and the PSU were replaced from 4-year old parts. 

New Motherboard (fresh W10 install on a new SSD when I basically had to rebuild this thing), needed new DDR4 ram because of Skylake, new processor, and it's just been happening with games for a while. There were a lot more other problems that I have fixed since I rebuilt it, but this one remained. I don't know if this was a problem since the rebuild was finished, as I had much more problems right after it and slowly fixed those, (game freeze when loading game due to the way the game handles the page file and SSD drivers settings conflicting with it, the cursor still moved but I was unable to use task manager etc, this issue is no longer here)

The card never had any ""kernel power"" critical issues on the ""old"" build, but the old motherboard's PCI-E slot cracked which is why I've upgraded nearly everything

You should set 1 to absolute most vital ones, if you have A life support, I suggest just having 
thrusters and FSD in one, mainly, my most absolute vital modules needed for escape are on 1, semi vital such as life support and low power weapons on 2, 3 is my power requirements for all weapons, and 4 and 5 are reserved for non-vital and effectively useless in combat, E.G interdictor and spare chaffs/SCBs (switched on when active set runs out) and also cargo hatch which isn't even required for trading, so remains off 90% of the time

basically, only set 1 to things you need the most, I prioritize in this order = emergency escape power, low power combat, full power combat, normal/supercruise non-combat vital modules and then cargo hatch, which is useless during combat which is always why I set it to 5

I'm not sure if your friend is wrong, but with 5 levels of power priorities, you should try to use them all, and save the 1s for the most vital of power requirements

that said, you don't have to be incredibly careful with this, depending on some ships and the role you have for the ship, you might have to move them around to suit your platelet, for example, I usually leave the cargo hatch on while not in combat for emergency brake use, and on some ships, I have to squeeze in the fuel scoop to 3 instead of, as long as you have everything you need to escape on 1, and you're happy with the power setup (consider every module) you should have enough power to escape in any power plant situation

Yes, you will feel detatched when you're walking around, but most games are also missing the parity with controls that are designed for a specific game, and as far as Elite is concerned, it will always have the edge over the games that don't have the peripherals to reflect your agency in the game world. In short, at least one part of the game reflects your actions in real life. This can't be said for a lot of VR games, where you're pushing a thumbstick to walk or pressing a button a jump.

Plus, what I'm already doing is a huge workaround, GTAV doesn't even support any controllers other than KBM and gamepad, the only way I got this to work was that I had to force 4 inputs to appear as one Xbox 360 gamepad.

I mean your idea sounds nice, but I can't imagine putting the idea into practice won't end up as a clumsy setup, especially since I completely lose perspective of my controls and can only go by things I can control without looking at, even reaching for the gamepad in VR after using a wheel is a very detatched and frustrating experience, using a Hydra would be much more difficult. Remember that when you use VR, you're completely blind and oblivious to the outside world, within the game, you'll be reaching for invisible objects you have little too no sense of where they are other than a vague idea of its general direction. 

I've nearly broken my phone a couple of times and knocked some speakers over trying to reach for things I couldn't see, I really wouldn't recommend trying to use multiple controllers with VR. You can't rely on sight or sound to know where your things are, it's awfully clumsy. I think I even broke the first micro USB cable for my DS4 when it got yanked out of one of the USB ports when it fell off the desk.

2039,"I have one of these sets, and this is a great deal , but you might have a problem with the centering of the stick, so you might need to do some adjustment and calibrate the axis with the drivers.

The units are very large, substantially larger than the X52/X52 Pro so think about this if you consider desk space a premium. Compared to these sticks, the game's own stick 3D models are based closely on the X52 and X52 pro. Versus the X52 and Pro though, the X55 has no deadzones out-of-the-box (I set some custom ones to counteract the very slight looseness on the roll axis so that there's a tiny deadband, for just the right amount of sensitivity.) The X55 also has a linear response curve out of the box - this means you get full diagonal response (Max X and Y / Max negative X and Y) as opposed to Max X or Max Y only (cornered-out is not absolute maximum/negative maximum of 2 axis, only one) BUT this can be fixed with software on the X52/X52 Pro.

There are also no buttons on the stick unit base of the X55, which means your hand has to leave the stick when using buttons on the X52. Lastly, springs are swappable and you don't need to modify the stick to change the spring tension. The downside of this is there are only 4 springs, you might need to procure your own springs if you want a custom exact amount of tension. The X52/X52 pro by default has a very loose centering spring - some might like this, but this is achievable by swapping the springs on the X55.

The throttle unit is solid, and you can adjust the tension (BUT if you work it a lot, it feels very loose. This is due to the thick lubricant they use, and it sometime gums up the mechanism. The good thing is, this lubricant eventually starts to move away from this mechanism, and the throttle resistance becomes more and more consistent the longer you use it.) The throttle base alone comes with over 30 assignable buttons and 6 axis controls, which is great for binding to games like DCS and War Thunder in Realistic mode.

The stick itself is very well built, a problem you might have is with the spring disc they use to center the stick. It doesn't fit the mould perfectly, some have found it to be slightly oval and have been able to adjust it so that it works near perfectly, but for MY stick, there is a slight looseness in the centering disc. It isn't enough to kill my accuracy, since I set the deadzones to be right on the edge so precision control with minute force applied is still possible.

I'm no buckyballer, but even a few hours of just jump and scan (no DSS) and charging right after the cooldown stops can get you 10-15kLy in a day (assuming you have 30-35 Ly in your ship), and you can make 50,000 Ly in just under 4 days if you commit to it.

I did this a while back when I did my core run after a bit of neutron farming, and only took me 2 days to travel the whole 25,000 Ly, and a couple other times more when I just got really tired of exploration.

In short:

* Remember to zero the throttle when the countdown timer starts (not sure how the throttle works on Xb1)

* Start scanning as soon as you enter the new system (you'll still be able to make at least a bit of money. and the frameshift charge takes longer than the scan)

* Focus on the next target destination and the FSD cooldown so you can hit the charge button as soon as the cooldown timer reaches 0
(Make sure you're not pointing towards the jump-in star or you might overheat whilst charging)

It's upto you whether you want to do this, I say it's better try because you'd at least get the money back for your data, but it's upto you

Well, yeah, you have to move your eyeballs to keep your eyes on the screen, but it works surprisingly well. It's not adjusted to have 1:1 ratio of head rotation and camera rotation, as the camera is amplified so that you can look directly to the left of you just by moving your head very slightly. 

I've tried one out at my uni during a hackathon, and it does take a bit of getting used to, but once you do, it allows you to be able to look around and track targets with the camera rather than having to just know it might be just out of screenspace. It is a bit expensive though.

I don't know what you're saying it's pointless, when the whole reason I play games is to put myself in the game as much as possible. Like driving cars uses a steering wheel and planes use a HOTAS layout, I really can't explain how much different the game experience is when there's a specific type of peripheral designed for a specific game, and the game is also reflective of that - they just work together so well when it has good support both ways.

It's not a novelty when sim gaming has some of the most dedicated communities when it comes to creating rigs, some even having motion rigs to or crazy monitor setups, with buttkicker amps to put you as close to the real thing as possible. These people play these sims for hours and hours on end, some doing every little extra thing to make their experience that much closer to real life, and this is well established in racing sim communities, flight sim communities, and even some hardcore ED simmers.

If you want to know specifically where I sprayed it for the rudder, just unscrew the stick from the base, and spray a little around between the grey fastener and the main stick, no need to take it apart; I can definitely feel the difference in the twist.

As for the base, I left the stick off the base when I sprayed it, a little on the ball, some on the shaft of the spring centering mechanism, and some underneath the spring disc (you might also want to try using a cotton bud, I didn't have any of those so I just went to town with the straw.)

2243,"**OP is slightly wrong. Well, they're right, but you're only laden with fuel. The tanks weigh nothing. There is a bit of misinformation here.**

The tanks themselves, like cargo racks, don't weigh anything.
If you get more tanks, you'll get less range, but only because you're laden with the extra T of fuel.


IF say, you have a ridiculous amount of fuel, say 128t, and you want to increase your jump range, simply burn the fuel (waste it on meaningless jumps) and you'll have the jump range of, say, if you had fitted a size 64 tank instead. A quarter of that, it will be as if you've fitted a size 32 tank. 1/8th of your total fuel, a size 16 tank. If you want to maintain that range, do not fill above X amount of fuel for the range you want. It does not make your journey any slower if you only fill it to X amount of fuel, in which you'll mimic having a smaller tank, ultimately leaving you with more choice.


The main thing here is to remember the actual fuel tank does not affect your total jump range - that is to say, the fuel in the tanks **do**. I had an Asp with about 62t of fuel, whenever I needed a range of a 32t tank, I would just not fill the total fuel reserves over 50% when I scooped, and if I needed even more range, I'd just use up fuel until I had the range I needed for the jump. 
 

**""Slower""** is a tradeoff. You either have a bigger fuel tank and scoop much much less, or devote more time to scooping on a tiny fuel tank. I'm pretty sure where there's a breakoff point in which the time you've wasted scooping easily overtakes the amount of distance you could've covered without having to scoop, on a certain sized fuel tank; personally I'd rather have a larger tank and the option to scoop much much less, and also have the ability to only scoop as much as I need if I need a longer range.  Having more fuel tanks allows you the flexibility of the choice of scooping less, as well as being able to choose your jump range all the way from being fully laden to 0.

--------

**Here's an exercise you can try to see it for yourself.**

To prove this, use as much as your fuel as you can without getting stranded, and make sure you have 2 or 3 module slots empty. Look to the right-hand side panel, and check your jump range. There should be two jump-range numbers - the one in the brackets is your total jump range when unladen with fuel and cargo. The one in the left is the jump range you can currently achieve, laden with however much fuel/cargo you have. You'll notice this goes up as your fuel goes down.

After doing that, go back to a high-tech system, and fill those empty module slots with extra fuel tanks and then press refuel to fill them up (you'll notice before refueling, the jump range will be the same as your last loadout when full, as you still only has as much fuel as the default tanks.) Drain your tanks again to near empty again, and you'll notice that your jump range is nearly identical to before you added the fuel tanks.

----------

**TL;DR**

Adding the extra fuel tanks does not lower your jump range. The extra fuel in those tanks do. To achieve identical jump range to smaller tanks, simply drain the total fuel by the amount of fuel that smaller tanks would have.",2015-09-13 19:15:20+00:00,cv0avyr,1.0,t3_3kt4vt,3973.0,EliteDangerous

2319,"I loved the Hotas X before mine broke and I bought a different HOTAS as an upgrade, but let me give you a few criticisms on why I don't really think that control scheme is particularly intuitive or effective for the control layout:

1. You bound binary inputs to an axis, which could've been used better for lateral thrusters, as the in-between values are better for controlling the amount of thrust you want

2. You have to either stretch your thumb or remove your hand from the throttle control to switch targets between subsystems, and sometimes it takes a while to get to the subsystem you want, it would be better for you to have bound those to things such as chaff, SCB or heatsinks, as you only have to press them once so your hands wouldn't be off the throttle for too long

3. There is Supercruise and Hyperspace, but no Hypercruise, and there is no need to bind 2 jump buttons if one of them charges for both. You should bind 2 FSD charge buttons only if they are both exclusively for one type of charge (either SC or HS)

4. I don't see the vertical or lateral thruster bindings anywhere

[This is my favourite binding set for it by far when I used it, and I've even tried my best to replicate these controls on my new set as closely as possible, whilst using the rest of the extra buttons for the spare bindings.](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=16140) Not saying you have to use these, but everything makes sense, and I bet it could be improved upon as Elite accepts modifier controls, so you could still bind completely without using the keyboard at all.",2015-09-09 17:23:01+00:00,cuvsglv,1.0,t3_3k9mam,725.0,EliteDangerous

though an extra note, if you used full-range throttle instead of the throttle button, and want to keep using full range, the X52 has a detent on 50%, where the ship is neither reversing or heading forwards, the X55 has none and the X52 Pro has the detents on 10% and 75%, which I guess is useful for supercruise disengage

Leave it running in the background when you play games, there's pretty much no overhead and it's what I use for all games that require a 360 gamepad.

EDIT: The image in the OP certainly implies it, there are very similar visual similarities with both sides of the actual docking bay, such as the rails and the arms, down to the corners of the docking bay

but if you look at [this image](http://i.imgur.com/3gWLlZ8.jpg) it shows more of the Anaconda, and where the docking bay is on the Anaconda looks nothing like the original image, so I'm a bit confused

to illustrate my point [the red section is the part of the anaconda we saw at the announcement, but it doesn't look anything like the image in the OP, yet the green bit I've marked out looks like where the docking bay should open, but it doesn't look like the shape of the docking bay in the trailer at all](http://i.imgur.com/cbdLGMg.jpg)

EDIT: I might actually go as far as to say that the Anaconda in the trailer's undercarriage is actually different from the Anaconda in-game and that the docking bay will work differently because of the sidewinder, as the Anaconda allows ships upto the side of a sidewinder, and maybe the trailer was just using an F63-sized docking bay Conda ",2015-08-28 02:55:16+00:00,cui8gcp,2.0,t1_cui8ayv,293.0,EliteDangerous

2590,"A lot of controls are ""fine"" if you can make a button do anything - but with a peripheral like this, it's more about the experience, especially when a game or peripheral is designed for each other, like racing sims with force feedback wheels or flight sticks for flight sims

It's fine if you want to play the game this way, but you're still using artificial controls for something that has the capability for a better experience, the closer you are to the ""real"" controls, the closer you are to the experience. It really is something you have to try to know what it feels like, and when you use one, you actually feel like you're flying a ship when you're using controls similar to what a lot of flight setups are; if you're not using the controls used to simulate something, how close are you really to the simulation experience? 

It's not cheap or affordable all of the time, but you can bet that a game made with a set of certain controls in mind are going to bring you closer to that feeling of being in control of something other than a computer. I fell in love with simulation peripherals when I got my first force feedback wheel, it really puts your mind inside the game; the closer it feels to reality, the more involving and visceral it becomes, and feels less of a ""game"".

It's really difficult to explain to people who haven't tried it, and simulation equipment is often cost-prohibitive, but when it's good, you lose yourself in the simulation",2015-08-24 22:21:40+00:00,cueeoqc,2.0,t1_cuedvea,1374.0,EliteDangerous

Unless the sock was dipped in bleach or has been in contact with any toxic materials I don't actually think a sock, cotton, synthetic or otherwise can actually poison you.

Really though I don't think anyone would expect him to actually do it, and if he did, It's pretty unlikely that it would kill him as a direct result of ingesting it. The only real and obvious risk I can ascertain is that eating the whole sock at once could be a huge choking hazard, and if that was successful, passing it wouldn't exactly be easy either; if the sock survived the stomach acids, there could be some problems with friction in the intestines that could cause haemorrhaging, and that's just a wild guess.

The safest way to do this, for any sock, assuming it's non-toxic is probably to cut it up into little pieces; I'm still not recommending it, I'm just saying the material of the sock itself isn't particularly dangerous in terms of all the other things you could be eating. There is a ""cotton ball"" diet some models apparently follow, the major risks being ""malnutrition"" and ""choking"", as long as you don't make a habit out of eating socks, I don't think it's going to do any serious long-term damage (once again, as long as you aren't trying to eat the whole sock at once.)

I'm not too bothered about whether tfaddy does it or not, but simply put, it's not as life-threatening as people here seem to think it is, or at least not any more life threatening than swallowing gum by accident

I think the games that work best with the oculus are simulators that have the controls that are made for the game, such as racing wheels and hotas sets. A keyboard is basically a switchboard full of binary buttons which you don't see in game, but a hotas is large, analogue, and getting used to one means you can easily find all the controls without looking. A keyboard is going to be much harder, as is that huge overhead control panel. Cool as it may be, they won't translate well to muscle-memorized controls because of the sheer amount of buttons. On the other hand, everyone knows how to drive a car and shift without looking at the gear lever, and pilots knows how to fly a plane without having to look at the throttle.

I lost -nothing- by buying the game earlier, and experiencing this game evolve from late beta, through gamma, into release, and no one who just buys Horizons will experience what I did and what I have.

All of which can be recreated in in different ways, that content is not created with assets that are then removed from the game, maybe not Lugh, but similar things could just as easily be made again, it's content as much as the unique player encounters you have and fights you've had that nobody else will ever have had

Don't tell me that I'm saying I hate this game, because I don't, and as I've already said, I'm probably going to buy this anyway because I really want to play what they're offering for this; But it's not an expansion, and it's not the same as knocking the price down later so I can save money. They're releasing this as a whole game with more content, plus the original, for the same price as what people had already paid for.

Again, this is about principle, they're not just knocking down the price of the game, it's not a sale where I could just get something cheaper down the line, they're pushing out a large expansion that is bundled with everything they had before. It's comparing apples and oranges, it's called an expansion, I don't care if it's 20 bucks or 100 bucks if they didn't bundle the base game with it. I'm pretty sure people would be fine with it if the game didn't go down 75% in value before it's even been out for a year. I'd have happily tacked another 60 bucks onto it if it didn't also bundle in the base game. 

And if I hadn't said it already, the price per hour of entertainment I've already spent on this game far exceeds most games I've already played. ",2015-08-05 16:13:02+00:00,ctsfq4a,8.0,t1_ctsai6c,8270.0,EliteDangerous

The point is, yes, I'm probably going to end up buying this before the beta, simply because I like the game so much, and in terms of money, the amount of hours of entertainment I've already gotten from it had already been well worth the amount of money I had paid for it.

But in principle, they're charging people the price of the full game twice. People who already have the game are ultimately at a loss. ",2015-08-05 13:38:43+00:00,cts9z60,6.0,t1_cts9jni,844.0,EliteDangerous

more expensive ships are usually capable of making more creds per hour than less expensive ships, whether it's by trading, combat, or otherwise, ""time is money"" is definitely the case in elite

If it is, you should actually be going for the lowest class and rating you can for exploration, those powerplants run insanely cold, and you won't be needing most of that power, I've actually disabled most of the useless modules that won't benefit me on my build and I won't be using most of the time whilst exploring (e.g cargo hatch, AFM unit, sensors) so my power usage is at about 7-8MW, meaning I could buy a class 2A powerplant for my Asp",2015-06-19 10:00:35+00:00,csbpkyv,3.0,t1_csbkoz0,17590.0,EliteDangerous

2977,"How often do you explore, OP?

Sorry to ask this question, but while I'd like to see things like derelict stations or mysterious things, but most explorer craft are unarmed; it wouldn't make sense to have a barely reachable place, e.g 36Ly jump density between systems, which means it's difficult to get to, AND have some NPCs guarding such a location, to get there in the first place, you'd probably have to have left all your guns at home! These are the hard places to get to, and you would've have to sacrifice everything for that jump range, only to get there and not be able to scan something because you have no means of defending yourself...

I mean, out here, you really are on your own, and that's nice in it's own way, being out there in the great unknown. Even so, I personally think there shouldn't really be any life out here, but it's definitely possible to make it more interesting without pulling out the ""planetary landing"" card, such as the improvement of many stellar bodies we have yet to see in their true form, Wolf-Rayet stars, Pulsars and Neutron stars just look like different white stars - they should be swirling and crazy! Hazardous to say the least, with some sort of HUD overlay like colored static waves to indicate radiation travelling, bonuses for scanning within nebulae, procedurally generated pictures or maps to go with our scans that are interesting to look at!

Maybe scanning with a detailed surface scanner will allow you to access a topographical map, let you switch between things like plate activity, heat maps, and atmospheric activity, shaded with different levels of intensity, and possibly even animated!
