Of course, maybe the real question is do I have it?

Of course, some might think maybe you'd be pretty hard pressed to find a PhD in computing security who's also hacks millions of dollars from rich people's bank accounts and  whatever that also happens to play Forza Horizon 3/s,  it's simpler than that.

If anyone has to reveal what security measures are looking for, you simply avoid doing those things, and there could be a lot of gaps where the red flags *aren't*.

I'm no computer security expert, but again, I've seen this happen before and I've seen people talk about it. I'm also surprised they hasven't actually said anything about this.

Again, this is just speculation based on previous experience, and usually, it has a happy ending. They did at least manage to fix a couple things with the PC version last patch, and they kept silent on that for a while, so it's anyone guess as to what's going to happen next with these bans.

400-500 start bid is the sweet spot if you want to win with little to no competition for less than average price. Scroll down a bit, 3-5 pages is usually where I stop, and if you get that start bid early on, the chances of anyone contesting it are going to be rare for a few reasons.

1. People are looking for bargains - 200k is the bait (while it's not impossible to win for 200k, it's incredibly unlikely you will). 300k is doable, I've gotten a few cars this way, but generally 400-500 is where I can win the most uncontested.

2. 300k is still a hell of a bargain, if you have a good amount of money to play on several auctions, or you're feeling particularly lucky, you could get away with it.

3. 4-500k is usually the threshold of where people will not think ""that's cheap"", or at least not as cheap as it could be when they see 200 and 300k listings about. The good thing is, those are the same people who will bid on the 200k and end up contesting each other up into the 700s, because they can't move their money elsewhere, and they can't afford to start a new bid, especially for another 300-500k. I've made the mistake before, and looked at 400k bids thinking ""this guy's been uncontested for ages"", and then ends up winning it, while I stare at my 700k bid that's still ticking down.

4. People who already bid on one car generally won't bid on another of the same, they've already put their money into one, so even if they could pay for two, they probably won't because they just want the car for the sake of wanting it.

many of the 200k start bids end up going for 600-800k (or even higher, as some have said), the 400s and 500s are a good place to be.

I've generally had terrible luck with wheelspins, so if I spend around 400k average on each HE car, that's about the cost of 8 wheelspins, and I'm sure I won't have that kind of ratio for each HE car, at the cost of 8 spins per car.

I can't guarantee it will work 100% of the time, but I'm happy with my results. Some examples, notice how the prices are all 100k on the dot, these are the start bids.

You can see this information in the tracking link from your transactions.

When it does reach the UK, however (and this is probably where people have to wait the most), the tracking might say ""Consignee contacted for Payment."" 

DHL uses [CCL](http://www.customsclearanceuk.com/en/index.html) for their customs services. (They may use others, but from what I've seen on DHL deliveries, most DHL parcels seem to go through CCL.) As the tracking says, they will contact you for payment, but they will do it by **snail mail.** This means you have to wait for a letter from them so that you can pay them, and then only after your payment is processed that your parcel will be on it's way.

Fortunately, there is a way around this. If you click the CCL link above, you can call them with your DHL [Customer Confirmation number](http://i.imgur.com/VpBSjEG.png) (should be a 20-character code) and give them your email so that they can send you an email of that same letter they sent to you, with the details you will need to pay them. Alternatively, you can give your payment details over the phone if you want.

In the letter should be a payment reference number, and the total amount you will have to spend (be warned, I ended up having to pay more than I expected) as well as a link to the payment page. You will need these to pay.

&gt;It’s the video game equivalent of a “Sounds of the Ocean” album when gamers are used to listening to Skrillex.

I'd go as far as to say it's not a ""game"" - don't get me wrong, that sentence is exactly what I wanted to read from an article like this.

People ask me why I enjoy games like Elite Dangerous and The Crew so much when I'm not so much as feeling challenged as I am enveloped in the experience, and that's okay. More familiar examples might perhaps be Abzu or Journey.

We're at the point where 3D, interactive, digital entertainment in worlds where we have agency and control doesn't have to mean we have to shoot people or save the world. I'm not saying that's every game that still has challenge, and I'm not saying I don't still enjoy those.

As it stands right now, this does sound like the kind of game I would enjoy. Whether I will or not, or if I will even buy it is still something I have yet to answer. 

While NMS has been on my radar for a while, I haven't really made the effort to read or find out information about it, and for the people who were expecting more of, well, a ""game"", which is completely understandable, I'm sorry you didn't find what you wanted in NMS.

Again, I haven't really been looking for information about this game in particular, so I don't know how many of you were lead to believe that it would be perhaps more like Minecraft

https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/4wxydf/im_about_to_meet_another_player_seriously

If instances aren't synced, solar cycles, blah blah etc, shouldn't this be removed? Surely being able to see each other would be necessary for PvP?

Either way, I was thinking yesterday: I was incredibly sure that the netcode wasn't even built into the game for the ability to see each other physically, and I was going to make that thread there and then until I saw that in the information repository. I was wondering why they'd even code it into the game given the small chances people would see each other, so why not leave it out altogether?

Another thing I want to add, Sean has said time and time again that this wasn't built to be a multiplayer experience, so before this turns into a shit show about something that would actually make the game seem ""bad"" (in the sense that it's not delivering something it's not designed to deliver), I'd like to remind everyone this had been the case for a very long time; NMS was always meant to be a single player experience from the get go, and this was said 2 years ago, and they have been adamant about it from the outset.

I'm not defending the game, I'm not saying it's not incredible and amazing without multiplayer and I'm also not saying it wouldn't be better without it, all I'm saying is if it really was a *good* game tailored for a singleplayer experience, we shouldn't let the lack of ""true"" multiplayer incite some sort of retarded shitstorm saying the game is a bunch of garbage because of something people tried to do that the developers said is against the paradigm of the game experience.

Let me bring up a similar example of an otherwise alright game I enjoyed personally, Watch Dogs. No, the hacking wasn't realistic, the story was about as exciting as waiting for the train, the game had a host of other problems, and I'm sure as some people might recall, the big discussions that surrounded the game ended up canning it for the graphics being downgraded - while that was a pretty shitty thing to do, the core game was still pretty fun. That might not be a great example, but it's the only one I can think of right now; it was still a game I enjoyed playing, unfortunately outshone by the media on the fact that the graphics weren't the E3 graphics.

I've had the game since launch and I don't really play with friends; I try to keep my times equal so I could play all the heroes and get to know them, so in any situation, I'd be able to pick anyone and help my team out where they need it most. Problem is, I'm not completely sure of the counters, the players I have problems with, and the supposed counters, I'm not sure of either, and I can't pick on a dime if I had to decide what hero would be the best for the benefit of my team at the moment.

I lose, a lot - games where my team would win usually feel like a fluke, and they'd almost always be overtime. If we do win, my contribution to the team in the aftermath section is usually sub-par, I wouldn't have done much if I did. The only thing I'd get gold in is objective time on loss, maybe my team is bad, but with losing this much, It's much easier to believe I'm the problem, and not everyone else. I change my hero whenever I feel our team if stuck, or if I'm getting killed far too often to try and counter whatever hero our team's having the most problems with, be it a Bastion or a Reaper, I still get my arse handed to me if I think a Genji or a Pharah can go against those (that's just what I think, maybe I'm wrong, but those would be my guesses on a whim based on what I believe in my experience)

While it's easy to think like this, I really don't know what else I'm doing wrong, if the game isn't going well for me because I picked X against Y, I'll try and switch to something that seems a bit more effective against whoever I'm having problems with, and I might switch again if I believe I made a bad call - perhaps I'm not using as much of this character's abilities as I think I am, I'll take note of that. Someone else suggests a hero for me in the middle of a match, I'll try it out. I can't really blame my team so much when I'm find that I feel like I'm rarely putting up much of a fight.

Maybe I just have the reflexes of a paper bag and I'm just handicapped, I seriously feel like I can't get better no matter how much guides I read or how many technicalities of heroes I read about, and it's just demotivating. I really want to enjoy this game and feel like I'm actually improving when I play, but that isn't really happening.

I'm not really looking for any miracle pieces of advice or magic words, heck, any help at all would be nice.

To me, I know when they're coming and I have my own methods of stopping them that I've found consistent results in - maybe it doesn't work for everyone but it's worked for me.

Again, I'm no doctor or anything as you can tell, just saying a lot of the things that cause it seem to be related to eating, swallowing, etc. Here's what I know from my personal encounters with hiccups - I seem to get them most often when I'm eating thick or particularly difficult to swallow food in large quantities - it's not something that would kill me, but it would take a lot of time to move down my throat if I try to eat a lot of it. 

Chips (or fries), when chewed, become a sort of thick potato paste (mashed potatoes have done the same to me before, though I haven't had it in a long time), when I eat a large amount of this and try to swallow, I can usually expect a hiccup. What I can imagine my body is trying to do is either crush up the food while it's inside the oesophagus, or trying to push it down into my stomach ASAP so it doesn't say, restrict my breathing; I don't know. That's just what I feel like I think it's doing. I imagine drinking or laughing or such might end up stimulating the body in similar ways in some cases.

Moving on to my solution, I just take a lot of fairly quick, deep breaths while trying to open my throat with whatever actions feel ""right"" with my neck, I'd imagine I look very awkward doing them, but something like looking up and maybe bobbing my head forward, it's not exactly easy to describe. It works though - another guess is that by showing  my body that I can breathe properly, my body feels like it's ""safe"" to stop the hiccups.

I understand how silly all this sounds, and I'll easily say it's wrong since I haven't done any research or such on the matter, and there's nothing but anecdotes to go on - just wondering if anybody who experiences hiccups has felt the same way. This is still all just a conjecture, if I haven't made that clear enough throughout this post.

Now here's what I'm worried about. How much have they revamped the missions? what is their intrinsic ""fun"" value? because the way I play the game, I lose money, and I don't even PvP, I just do whatever I want because simply getting things like prismatics or being part of powerplay and rank progression sounds like more trouble than fun to me, and I think a lot of us can relate to that

Either way, right now, there's not much I can do but hope, and I'm not too confident if I'm honest. How much can they really change in the core mission system to make it ""fun""? 

AFAIK they haven't said anything about how we will find these engineers, only that some of the stuff may be tied to powerplay, ranks, materials, and to be frank, that don't sound so great to me. Does engineers reward me for doing what I like? Will I be in search of arbitrary resources doing unrelated combat missions just to get a better FSD? Or will I have a high exploration rank and have sold much data to this faction the Engineer is aligned with, and get a better FSD?

I'm not going to panic if it isn't this way, but if I have to be aligned, if I have to look for rare materials that could be on any planet, if I have to do a bunch of trading missions to get a module unrelated to trading, I'm afraid all this crafting content won't be what I'm working towards in the game.

This is supposedly the largest part of the update we're getting, and I don't know what else they'll change, I just hope this won't be another ""powerplay"" for me. Right now, I can't really do anything except wait. Don't get me wrong, the other parts of the update, small things like bookmarks and faces, traffic control that add a little more character to the game is a very welcome addition, especially seeing how dry it has been for such a long time, I'm just not really sure what to expect this time, really.

Most of the time I play the game, I'm flying spaceships and having fun doing that, and I know this doesn't stop me, it's just sometimes, I face the choice of having either ""fun"" or ""progression"". I'm not saying you can't have fun just bounty hunting, but it definitely isn't always

The laptop itself appears to functioning, but it doesn't charge anymore. Turns off and on, so I assume they need both to check if the laptop has been damaged in any way by the adapter failure. Laptop also rebooted on the pop.

I told ASUS about this and they told me to submit an RMA request form. I did so, and now my laptop is being sent to them.

But I'm super worried. 

They said I didn't need to prepare to package it - just that they collect my laptop and charger in a plastic tote box the courier will bring.

Firstly, I felt like the courier had no idea what they were doing. They placed the laptop in the middle between the 2 pads cutout, DESPITE there being a laptop-shaped square in the center that was
pratically made for the laptop. This made me really nervous. Since ASUS didn't tell me to prepare anything, I wish I put it in a bubble wrap bag or something first. The guy just took it from my hand with his dirty gloves
and placed it in the box without thinking, I had to intervene and SHOW HIM the cutout.

Second, I used live chat to talk to ASUS to say I feel like the laptop transportation method felt inadequate. Had the guy left the laptop in between the foam pads, it would've been free to knock against
the bottom of the box and possibly slide forwards and backwards. I asked if there were any scratches or such when I got my laptop back, if I would be reimbursed - ASUS said no. That would be up to
the courier. They apparently record scratches and told me they would investigate any damages on the laptop, but I feel as though it's important that they should've told me to take pictures of the
laptop in it's condition so that I can prove there were no scratches before I sent it to them. They still maintain that I would, in no way, be reimbursed for any of these despite saying they would make
investigations and record scratches or scuff marks for whatever reason. What's worse is I can't expect the courier to do the same on the way back. 

I'm sorry, but I only had the damn thing for 5 days and I didn't pay £1000 for a new laptop to be handled as such by a courier that didn't seem to know what he was doing and to wait (hopefully) 2-3 weeks
to get a beat-up laptop back. At this point, I'm happy to get a laptop back that doesn't look like trash and works as intended. This was the price I paid for it new, it looked new for the 5 days I had it and I 
hope I can expect it to look new when I get it back. 

I honestly really liked the laptop for the 5 days I had it. I really really liked it, it looked great and I was really looking forward to using it for a long while.
I played a couple games on them, and they ran surprisingly great on high settings. Just 5 days and it's rattling inside some scruffy plastic box with some loose pieces of foam.

**I guess what I'm asking is, if anyone here has ever RMA'd a laptop before, with details on the repair procedures if you perhaps work there, and I'd like to hear some happy endings, because just searching ""RMA"" followed by ""X company"" is sure to bring up the horror stories of customer support hell from the vocal minorities - I mean, you don't hear stories of a job done exactly as it's supposed to, right?**

I'm really very concerned over here, I've never RMA'd such an expensive piece of hardware before. I could almost cry because of the way they handled it. I know it's just a laptop, but damn, I'm just so anxious about all the stuff I mentioned. It's a real godamn shame the charger went like it did.

Let me begin by saying there is no *wrong* way to play Elite (in terms of controls). Plenty of people play with what they're most comfortable with, be that Keyboard + Mouse, HOTAS, Gamepad, or even the Steam Controller, and all work fine with enough practice. If you have anything you want me to add to the OP (try and keep it as unbiased as possible), please leave a comment or PM me,

----

**Keyboard and Mouse**
----
Generally, a lot of PvPers like to use Keyboard + Mouse, because of the potential precision it can offer. Since your movement is restricted by ship speed, it can take some practice to get used to as opposed to FPS games, but a lot of people here can attest and assure you that KBM is probably the best when it comes to accuracy. Not only that, but for any computer, most people will probably have already and don't need to buy any extra hardware.

You won't find yourself running out of any buttons on a Keyboard, and the familiarity of a FPS-like control setup (should you choose to bind it like so) or any other flight sims you've already played should make it easy for you to know all the basics of movement.

If you haven't tried Keyboard and Mouse yet, or you're waiting to decide on whether you should get anything else, the very least you can do is try this out first.

----

**HOTAS**
----
(Hands-on-throttle-and-stick)

This is usually the ""expensive"" option (though it doesn't have to be), and largely depends on your commitment to the experience. If you've played games such a racing sim before with perhaps a wheel and such, you'll know the difference in makes in the gaming experience.

To put it simply, Elite is designed as a space sim, and a standard HOTAS set will give you the most identical controls the game was intended to simulate. This is the intention, but not the rules. Some might prefer using twin-joysticks, a joystick + mouse, maybe even the above with a set of yaw pedals. I will go into this further later, but for now, I will only be talking about the standard HOTAS configuration.

Starting off, you might have some trouble controlling your stick, and this is normal - it's like learning how to drive a car or operate a new piece of machinery for the first time. Once you begin to feel familiar with your setup, you'll learn about and recognize the nuances and be able to work with the controls better and better, and perhaps some of these differences can be quite radical even between other HOTAS sets, especially if you're planning to get some yaw pedals.

One of the pitfalls is that there are a lot of HOTAS sets to choose from, and it's difficult to know what you want until you've tried it, and not only that; but you're also asking yourself to invest in a completely new piece of hardware you haven't experienced before. 

That's putting quite a bit of faith (and money) into something you don't know if you'll enjoy. Thankfully, there are some cheap options out there, and they probably wouldn't break the bank if you wanted to try it out before you decide to splash out on some expensive hardware.

**Gamepad**
----

This is another familiar controller type, and if you've ever played games such as Ace Combat or War Thunder with a gamepad, you'll know it's more than adequate. In the case of Elite, which might seem a bit complex at first, works particularly well since the game allows you to bind modifiers. This means you can have one button where you can hold to access a number of different commands on buttons you may have already bound.

As you probably all know, there are plenty of players on Xbox One who have already enjoyed the game this way for a while now, which should be enough proof that it's a capable controller for even a game like Elite. Personally, I have tried the game with a Dualshock 4 controller, and it works great. 

While it may seem a bit difficult to make small movements with the analogue sticks, this is also just a question of practice; with time, you'll get better, and like any other game with particularly sensitive controls such as racing games, it's not impossible to get very good at Elite with a Gamepad.

This probably goes without saying, but if you travel a lot, or like to game on the go on maybe a gaming laptop and such, don't be afraid to play Elite with a Gamepad.

**Other**
----

Some people like to completely customize their experience, or maybe they've bought a Steam Controller, or maybe they like building their own switchboards and such. I don't have that much to say about this, but this part is just really about how customization in Elite's controls allow you to do all kinds of things.

As I've said earlier, some people like using twin-Joysticks with yaw pedals, and they can tell you they've played like this for a while too, because it's comfortable. Pairing the mouse with a stick (HOMAS) is also popular in flight sims. With the Steam Controller, which is already incredibly customizable, is possible in a huge number of configurations. Even with the complexity of MOBAs and games like Cities: Skyline, those games could be played with just a Steam Controller easily, so you could bet it would work well with Elite too.

Earlier, I had a configuration where I would also have my G27 racing wheel set up, so I could use that to drive around my SRV. Elite also allows 2 bindings for each control, so even if I binded everthing to one controller, I could perhaps make use of the second bind slot to have another button that activates the same thing. 

There's also mobile software such as the Roccat Powergrid app, which allows you to connect to your computer via Wi-Fi that enables you to bind your phone-screen buttons to buttons on your keyboard, so you can even do things like retract your landing gear or charge your jump using on-screen buttons with a phone-holder and such.

I'm sort of rambling now at this point, so I'll stop, but I hope you at least realize that you can always experiment with controls if you're not comfortable with it.

**Options**

In case you want to perhaps get some hardware, but don't know where to look, here are some options to get you started. Feel free to correct me on any of these, most of this was just personal research.

| Budget (Prices may vary per country) | Hardware Type + Name                             | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Low                                  | HOTAS / Thrustmaster T-Flight Hotas X            | A favorite for starters, and at it's price point, it's a very good, fairly sturdy HOTAS for a low price. Maybe a few buttons compared to other sets, but with Elite's modifiers, there's enough buttons to do everything by itself. Plastic might feel a little cheap, but  no lack of functionality, if a little bit inaccurate compared to  higher-end sticks as it uses potentiometers. Features twist rudder axis in  stick and throttle rudder control. Used one until I sold it to a friend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Low                                  | HOTAS / Speedlink Blackwidow Flightstick         | Surprisingly not mentioned much, the throttle and stick aren't separate  units, but is a very sturdy stick with a heavy base that isn't likely to  move around. One of the few Speedlink products that are widely liked,  but not often mentioned in Elite. As above, few buttons, but shouldn't  be a problem with modifiers. Also uses potentiometers. Is said to have a  nice feel and build quality, and the plastic seems to be somewhat  rubberized. No twist rudder axis in stick, but rudder control in throttle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Low                                  | Joystick / Thrustmaster T-16000M                 | Very modest price tag for a Joystick that uses Hall-Effect sensors, as  opposed to the other sticks around this cost, which makes it very  accurate and less likely to develop deadzones. Completely mirrored for  ambidextrous use, which makes it very good for a twin-stick stup. Small  axis control on base that can be used for throttle. Features twist rudder axis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Low                                  | Joystick / Logitech Extreme 3D Pro               | Seen  this mentioned a couple times, and Logitech generally seems to have  decent hardware. It's a joystick with a small lever axis control that is  designed to be used as a throttle. Generally said to be sturdy, Also a  popular stick used for twin-stick configurations. Features twist rudder axis.  Uses Potentiometers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Low                                  | Gamepad / Xbox 360 Wired Controller              | Generally  a good, all-round controller, widely supported by most games. A  familiar button setup that is easy to get used to if you've played  flight games on console before, and modifiers should take care of any  lack of buttons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Low/Mid                              | HOTAS / Saitek X45 Digital                       | A very old stick, discontinued, but could be found on Ebay, made in the Golden Age before the MadCatz acquisition. As expected, prices may vary wildly on Ebay with products in questionable condition, but could be picked up for very cheap. Driver support is uncertain, but reported to work in Windows 10. No twist rudder axis, but does feature throttle rudder control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

The X52 and X52 Pro are  fairly similar, some of the most notable differences include throttle  detents in different places, color programming on the buttons, color scheme and such. Elite Dangerous's own in-game models for the ship controls are modeled somewhat after the X52 and X52 Pro. Said to have a fairly loose spring, but some don't mind. Both feature lockable twist rudder axis, adjustable throttle resistance dial, and adjustable palm rest(suitable for large and small hands). Does not have linear response curve out-of-the-box (which some don't mind or prefer), but adjustable through software. |
| Mid                                  | HOTAS / Saitek X55 Rhino                         | QC issues apply to some X55 owners as well as above, but is also a popular choice among some players. A very large amount of buttons (6 axis and  30 buttons on Throttle, 3 axis and ~20 on stick) which makes it easy to bind all necessary controls to each button. Adjustable spring tension for X and Y axis (swappable springs), very large throttle and stick base (good for placement, bad for desk space), very large stick with no adjustable handle (slightly difficult for small hands), features twist rudder. Currently using.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Mid/High                             | Joystick / Microsoft Sidewinder Force Feedback 2 | Discountinued, but still purchasable off sites like Ebay. As expected,  prices will vary significantly depending on where you live.  MOTOR-centered force feedback stick (Unfortunately, Elite Dangerous does  not support Force Feedback, but centering is still done using motors  and not springs), somewhat rare, uses Optical sensors for axis, features  twist rudder axis and throttle lever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Let me begin by saying there is no *wrong* way to play Elite (in terms of controls). Plenty of people play with what they're most comfortable with, be that Keyboard + Mouse, HOTAS, Gamepad, or even the Steam Controller, and all work fine with enough practice. 

----

**Keyboard and Mouse**
----
Generally, a lot of PvPers like to use Keyboard + Mouse, because of the potential precision it can offer. Since your movement is restricted by ship speed, it can take some practice to get used to as opposed to FPS games, but a lot of people here can attest and assure you that KBM is probably the best when it comes to accuracy. Not only that, but for any computer, most people will probably have already and don't need to buy any extra hardware.

You won't find yourself running out of any buttons on a Keyboard, and the familiarity of a FPS-like control setup (should you choose to bind it like so) or any other flight sims you've already played should make it easy for you to know all the basics of movement.

If you haven't tried Keyboard and Mouse yet, or you're waiting to decide on whether you should get anything else, the very least you can do is try this out first.

----

**HOTAS**
----
(Hands-on-throttle-and-stick)

This is usually the ""expensive"" option (though it doesn't have to be), and largely depends on your commitment to the experience. If you've played games such a racing sims before with perhaps a wheel and such, you'll know the difference in makes in the gaming experience.

To put it simply, Elite is designed as a space sim, and a standard HOTAS set will give you the most identical controls the game was intended to simulate. This is the intention, but not the rules. Some might prefer using twin-joysticks, a joystick + mouse, maybe even the above with a set of yaw pedals. I will go into this further later, but for now, I will only be talking about the standard HOTAS configuration.

Starting off, you might have some trouble controlling your stick, and this is normal - it's like learning how to drive a car or operate a new piece of machinery for the first time. Once you begin to feel familiar with your setup, you'll learn about and recognize the nuances and be able to work with the controls better and better, and perhaps some of these differences can be quite radical even between other HOTAS sets, especially if you're planning to get some yaw pedals.

One of the pitfalls is that there are a lot of HOTAS sets to choose from, and it's difficult to know what you want until you've tried it, and not only that; but you're also asking yourself to invest in a completely new piece of hardware you haven't experienced before. 

That's putting quite a bit of faith (and money) into something you don't know if you'll enjoy. Thankfully, there are some cheap options out there, and they probably wouldn't break the bank if you wanted to try it out before you decide to splash out on some expensive hardware.

**Gamepad**
----

This is another familiar controller type, and if you've ever played games such as Ace Combat or War Thunder with a gamepad, you'll know it's more than adequate. In the case of Elite, which might seem a bit complex at first, works particularly well since the game allows you to bind modifiers. This means you can have one button where you can hold to access a number of different commands on buttons you may have already bound.

As you probably all know, there are plenty of players on Xbox One who have already enjoyed the game this way for a while now, which should be enough proof that it's a capable controller for even a game like Elite. Personally, I have tried the game with a Dualshock 4 controller, and it works great. 

While it may seem a bit difficult to make small movements with the analogue sticks, this is also just a question of practice; with time, you'll get better, and like any other game with particularly sensitive controls such as racing games, it's not impossible to get very good at Elite with a Gamepad.

This probably goes without saying, but if you travel a lot, or like to game on the go on maybe a gaming laptop and such, don't be afraid to play Elite with a Gamepad.

**Other**
----

Some people like to completely customize their experience, or maybe they've bought a Steam Controller, or maybe they like building their own switchboards and such. I don't have that much to say about this, but this part is just really about how customization in Elite's controls allow you to do all kinds of things.

As I've said earlier, some people like using twin-Joysticks with yaw pedals, and they can tell you they've played like this for a while too, because it's comfortable. Pairing the mouse with a stick (HOMAS) is also popular in flight sims. With the Steam Controller, which is already incredibly customizable, is possible in a huge number of configurations. Even with the complexity of MOBAs and games like Cities: Skyline, those games could be played with just a Steam Controller easily, so you could bet it would work well with Elite too.

Earlier, I had a configuration where I would also have my G27 racing wheel set up, so I could use that to drive around my SRV. Elite also allows 2 bindings for each control, so even if I binded everthing to one controller, I could perhaps make use of the second bind slot to have another button that activates the same thing. 

There's also mobile software such as the Roccat Powergrid app, which allows you to connect to your computer via Wi-Fi that enables you to bind your phone-screen buttons to buttons on your keyboard, so you can even do things like retract your landing gear or charge your jump using on-screen buttons with a phone-holder and such.

I'm sort of rambling now at this point, so I'll stop, but I hope you at least realize that you can always experiment with controls if you're not comfortable with it.

**Options**

In case you want to perhaps get some hardware, but don't know where to look, here are some options to get you started. Feel free to correct me on any of these, most of this was just personal research.

| Budget (Prices may vary per country) | Hardware Type + Name                             | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Low                                  | HOTAS / Thrustmaster T-Flight Hotas X            | A favorite for starters, and at it's price point, it's a very good HOTAS for a low price. Maybe a few buttons compared to other sets, but with Elite's modifiers, there's enough buttons to do everything by itself. Plastic might feel a little cheap, but  no lack of functionality, if a little bit inaccurate compared to  higher-end sticks as it uses potentiometers. Features twist rudder axis in  stick and throttle rudder control. Used one until I sold it to a friend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Low                                  | HOTAS / Speedlink Blackwidow Flightstick         | Surprisingly not mentioned much, the throttle and stick aren't separate  units, but is a very sturdy stick with a heavy base that isn't likely to  move around. One of the few Speedlink products that are widely liked,  but not often mentioned in Elite. As above, few buttons, but shouldn't  be a problem with modifiers. Also uses potentiometers. Is said to have a  nice feel and build quality, and the plastic seems to be somewhat  rubberized. No twist rudder axis in stick, but rudder control in throttle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Completely mirrored for  ambidextrous use, which makes it very good for a twin-stick stup. Small  axis control on base that can be used for throttle. Features twist rudder axis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

It's a joystick with a small lever axis control that is  designed to be used as a throttle. Generally said to be sturdy, Also a  popular stick used for twin-stick configurations. Features twist rudder axis.  Uses Potentiometers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

A  familiar button setup that is easy to get used to if you've played  flight games on console before, and modifiers should take care of any  lack of buttons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

As expected, prices may vary wildly on Ebay with products in questionable condition, but could be picked up for very cheap. Driver support is uncertain, but reported to work in Windows 10. No twist rudder axis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

The X52 and X52 Pro are  fairly similar, some of the most notable differences include throttle  detents in different places, color programming on the buttons, color scheme and such. Elite Dangerous's own in-game models for the ship controls are modeled somewhat after the X52 and X52 Pro. Said to have a fairly loose spring, but some don't mind. Both feature lockable twist rudder axis, adjustable throttle resistance dial, and adjustable palm rest(suitable for large and small hands). Does not have linear response curve out-of-the-box (which some don't mind or prefer), but adjustable through software. |
| Mid                                  | HOTAS / Saitek X55 Rhino                         | QC issues apply to some X55 owners as well as above, but is also a popular choice among some players. A very large amount of buttons (6 axis and  30 buttons on Throttle, 3 axis and ~20 on stick) which makes it easy to bind all necessary controls to each button. Adjustable spring tension for X and Y axis (swappable springs), very large throttle and stick base (good for placement, bad for desk space), very large stick with no adjustable handle (slightly difficult for small hands), features twist rudder. Currently using.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Mid/High                             | Joystick / Microsoft Sidewinder Force Feedback 2 | Discountinued, but still purchasable off sites like Ebay. As expected,  prices will vary significantly depending on where you live.  MOTOR-centered force feedback stick (Unfortunately, Elite Dangerous does  not support Force Feedback, but centering is still done using motors  and not springs), somewhat rare, uses Optical sensors for axis, features  twist rudder axis and throttle lever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Let me begin by saying there is no *wrong* way to play Elite (in terms of controls). Plenty of people play with what they're most comfortable with, be that Keyboard + Mouse, HOTAS, Gamepad, or even the Steam Controller, and all work fine with enough practice. 

----

**Keyboard and Mouse**
----
Generally, a lot of PvPers like to use Keyboard + Mouse, because of the potential precision it can offer. Since your movement is restricted by ship speed, it can take some practice to get used to as opposed to FPS games, but a lot of people here can attest and assure you that KBM is probably the best when it comes to accuracy. Not only that, but for any computer, most people will probably have already and don't need to buy any extra hardware.

You won't find yourself running out of any buttons on a Keyboard, and the familiarity of a FPS-like control setup (should you choose to bind it like so) or any other flight sims you've already played should make it easy for you to know all the basics of movement.

If you haven't tried Keyboard and Mouse yet, or you're waiting to decide on whether you should get anything else, the very least you can do is try this out first.

----

**HOTAS**
----
(Hands-on-throttle-and-stick)

This is usually the ""expensive"" option (though it doesn't have to be), and largely depends on your commitment to the experience. If you've played games such a racing sims before with perhaps a wheel and such, you'll know the difference in makes in the gaming experience.

To put it simply, Elite is designed as a space sim, and a standard HOTAS set will give you the most identical controls the game was intended to simulate. This is the intention, but not the rules. Some might prefer using twin-joysticks, a joystick + mouse, maybe even the above with a set of yaw pedals. I will go into this further later, but for now, I will only be talking about the standard HOTAS configuration.

Starting off, you might have some trouble controlling your stick, and this is normal - it's like learning how to drive a car or operate a new piece of machinery for the first time. Once you begin to feel familiar with your setup, you'll learn about and recognize the nuances and be able to work with the controls better and better, and perhaps some of these differences can be quite radical even between other HOTAS sets, especially if you're planning to get some yaw pedals.

One of the pitfalls is that there are a lot of HOTAS sets to choose from, and it's difficult to know what you want until you've tried it, and not only that; but you're also asking yourself to invest in a completely new piece of hardware you haven't experienced before. 

That's putting quite a bit of faith (and money) into something you don't know if you'll enjoy. Thankfully, there are some cheap options out there, and they probably wouldn't break the bank if you wanted to try it out before you decide to splash out on some expensive hardware.

----

**Gamepad**
----

This is another familiar controller type, and if you've ever played games such as Ace Combat or War Thunder with a gamepad, you'll know it's more than adequate. In the case of Elite, which might seem a bit complex at first, works particularly well since the game allows you to bind modifiers. This means you can have one button where you can hold to access a number of different commands on buttons you may have already bound.

As you probably all know, there are plenty of players on Xbox One who have already enjoyed the game this way for a while now, which should be enough proof that it's a capable controller for even a game like Elite. Personally, I have tried the game with a Dualshock 4 controller, and it works great. 

While it may seem a bit difficult to make small movements with the analogue sticks, this is also just a question of practice; with time, you'll get better, and like any other game with particularly sensitive controls such as racing games, it's not impossible to get very good at Elite with a Gamepad.

This probably goes without saying, but if you travel a lot, or like to game on the go on maybe a gaming laptop and such, don't be afraid to play Elite with a Gamepad.

----

**Other**
----

Some people like to completely customize their experience, or maybe they've bought a Steam Controller, or maybe they like building their own switchboards and such. I don't have that much to say about this, but this part is just really about how customization in Elite's controls allow you to do all kinds of things.

As I've said earlier, some people like using twin-Joysticks with yaw pedals, and they can tell you they've played like this for a while too, because it's comfortable. Pairing the mouse with a stick (HOMAS) is also popular in flight sims. With the Steam Controller, which is already incredibly customizable, is possible in a huge number of configurations. Even with the complexity of MOBAs and games like Cities: Skyline, those games could be played with just a Steam Controller easily, so you could bet it would work well with Elite too.

Earlier, I had a configuration where I would also have my G27 racing wheel set up, so I could use that to drive around my SRV. Elite also allows 2 bindings for each control, so even if I binded everthing to one controller, I could perhaps make use of the second bind slot to have another button that activates the same thing. 

There's also mobile software such as the Roccat Powergrid app, which allows you to connect to your computer via Wi-Fi that enables you to bind your phone-screen buttons to buttons on your keyboard, so you can even do things like retract your landing gear or charge your jump using on-screen buttons with a phone-holder and such.

I'm sort of rambling now at this point, so I'll stop, but I hope you at least realize that you can always experiment with controls if you're not comfortable with it.

:-:|:-:|:-:|
Low|HOTAS / Thrustmaster T-Flight Hotas X|&amp;nbsp;
A favourite for starters, and at it's price point, it's a very good HOTAS for a low price. Maybe a few buttons compared to other sets, but with Elite's modifiers, there's enough buttons to do everything by itself. Plastic might feel a little cheap, but no lack of functionality, if a little bit inaccurate compared to higher-end sticks as it uses potentiometers. Features twist axis in stick and throttle rudder control. Used one until I sold it to a friend.&amp;nbsp;
|
Low|HOTAS / Speedlink Blackwidow Flightstick|&amp;nbsp;
Usually not mentioned much, the throttle and stick aren't separate units, but is a very sturdy stick with a heavy base that isn't likely to move around. One of the few Speedlink products that are widely liked, but not often mentioned in Elite. As above, few buttons, but shouldn't be a problem with modifiers. Also uses potentiometers. Is said to have a nice feel and build quality, and the plastic seems to be somewhat rubberized. No twist axis in stick, but rudder control in throttle.&amp;nbsp;
|
Low |Joystick / Thrustmaster T-16000M|Very modest price tag for a Joystick that uses Hall-Effect sensors, as opposed to the other sticks around this cost, which makes it very accurate and less likely to develop deadzones. Completely mirrored for ambidextrous use, which makes it very good for a twin-stick stup. Small axis control on base that can be used for throttle. Features twist axis.|
Low|Joystick / Logitech Extreme 3D Pro|Seen this mentioned a couple times, and Logitech generally seems to have decent hardware. It's a joystick with a small axis control that is designed to be used as a throttle. Generally said to be sturdy, Also a popular stick used for twin-stick configurations. Features twist axis. Uses Potentiometers.|
Low |Gamepad / Xbox 360 Wired Controller|Generally a good, all-round controller, widely supported by most games. A familiar button setup that is easy to get used to if you've played flight games on console before, and modifiers should take care of any lack of buttons.|
Mid|HOTAS / Saitek X52/X52 Pro|Saitek products (after MadCatz acquisition) have QC issues, but is another popular choice for Elite Dangerous. The X52 and X52 Pro are fairly similar, some of the most notable differences include throttle detents in different places, |
Mid|&amp;nbsp;
HOTAS / Saitek&amp;nbsp;
X55 Rhino|QC issues apply to some X55 owners as well, but is also a popular choice among some. |
Mid/High|Joystick / Microsoft Sidewinder Force Feedback 2|Discountinued, but still purchasable off sites like Ebay. As expected, prices will vary significantly depending on where you live. MOTOR-centered force feedback stick (Unfortunately, Elite Dangerous does not support Force Feedback, but centering is still done using motors and not springs), somewhat rare, uses Optical sensors for axis, features twist axis|

I'm sure you know it's no mystery why Frontier are keeping the Atmospheric stuff under wraps until they're sure they have something they're happy with.

We have huge cities,with massive detail, some older than others, different architectural styles all around, stuff that can't exactly be procedurally generated, but that's still only half of it.

What about stuff like this? 

--------

[The Salar de Uyuni](http://static.thousandwonders.net/Salar.de.Uyuni.original.1512.jpg) always comes to mind first, world's largest salt flat. In this picture, the thin layer of water creating a near-flawless mirror-like reflection of the sky above it - imagine just landing on this.

[The Morning Glory (yes I know)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/MorningGloryCloudBurketownFromPlane.jpg), Very very rarely occurs in some parts of the world, but predictably forms around the south of Australia because of the way the land is. The scale is incredible, and the uniformity of the shadows it casts is an unusual and amazing sight, not to mention the scale. 

[The Giant's Causeway](http://www.meros.org/uploads/gallery/c1/7c/53/c1a7c0537245609581448ca54057a242.jpg), Not the best place to take your SRV, but with all these vertical straight lines and prismatic shapes, it's difficult to believe that these were naturally formed. 

[Geirangerfjord](http://cdn.desktopwallpapers4.me/wallpapers/nature/1920x1080/2/16494-geirangerfjord-norway-1920x1080-nature-wallpaper.jpg), this one may not be that hard to believe, but it is a pretty massive entry in UNESCO's world heritage sites, and for good reason. It's simply gorgeous, green mountains surrounding the deepest, dark blue water you've ever seen, it's as if a teal filter had been slipped over your eyes. Another colourful body of water is [the River Soča](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/78/ce/7e/78ce7e8d45c3ce25b3acddc897685cd3.jpg), often called ""The Emerald Beauty"" for it's unusual, very clear, yet natural color. Not only do Frontier have to have some sort of planetary sea system, but how will they deal with colorful rivers and such?

[Stone Forest](http://oddstuffmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MM7820_090512_15046_xgaplus-610x406.jpg), Madagascar; nature's own architects are at it again, straight lines, tangible formations, but completely natural. Might have a hard time finding a place to land around here.

[the Door to Hell](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/photos/000/817/81745.adapt.768.1.jpg), also known as ""The Crater of Fire"". Maybe this doesn't count, as it wasn't naturally lit up, but was set fire to, as to prevent the methane gas from spreading. It's a natural gas crater, and has been burning for over 40 years now.

I'm going to stop there, because I'll just end up spending the entire day writing the Subreddit edition of ""Top 20 places you wont believe exist!"", and there are many more places like this just on planet Earth. Just having a look at these really makes you wonder about the Future of Elite.

I mean, I have no idea how much detail Frontier will put into planet Earth, and how they will go about procedurally generating stuff like this on other Earthlikes, maybe they won't have them at all on some planets, maybe they're just very rare, but the fact is, if they do, they might be on this planet somewhere, and to be able to come across maybe even a planet full of some of these, or even bigger instances of these wonders makes me really excited. 

For the Explorer, finding an Earth-like, I can't imagine how amazing it would be to come across something like any of these.

You found this first, and you're the only person to have seen it in this configuration, on this planet, thousands of lightyears away from civilization - there might have been better ones,  but you found this one, and you would be so godamn proud you put your name on it.

It's a small thing, but for some reason, it just feels really satisfying to name them.

My naming isn't particularly complex, but dang I do love the names I have for my ships. Basically, I use Google translate to find latin words and their synonyms, and look at the coolest sounding one that doesn't have any other definitions that are too weird. 

So essentially, my names aren't too difficult for me to decide on, most of Latin sounds awesome anyway! I started naming them properly on my Asp, with the prefix FSS (FrameShift Ship). I've thought about other abbreviations, such as SS for Space Ship, but that's already often used for Steam Ship for steam engines here, RS (Rocket ship) which I don't really like the sound of. As you might know, some of the ship in-game aligned strictly to the Federation might have the prefix FNS, which I presume stands for Federal Naval Ship, like USS for the US battleships.

(I guess FSS could also be interpreted as ""For Shit's Sake"" but I had already gone through a lot of abbreviations by that time to care, and you gotta have some unfortunate coincidences sometimes, as with the real world :) )

Anyway, enough babbling, here are some of the names I'm proud of, feel free to send your own!

Some of these might be cringy, but they my babies, with some rough translations from memory

1. Asp - FSS Conscientia (Knowledge)
2. Cobra MKIII - FSS Telum (Arrow/Arrowhead?)
3. FAS - FSS Lacertus (Attack/Fish or something)
4. Clipper 1 - FSS Celeritas II (Speed/Agility, named II after selling first)
5. Clipper 2 - FSS Citipes (Similar, bought a second clipper just in case I lost the first sale clipper)
6. Corvette - FSS Sicarius (Assassin/Killer)
7. Python - FSS Praesidium (Guardian/Defender)(Sold)
8. Anaconda - FSS Chanaan II (Second Conda trader, sold the first to outfit the Corvette)(Sold)
9. FDL - FSS Incursio (Assault/Attack?)(Sold)
10. Orcs - FSS Venustas (Beauty?)(Sold)

There's also a bunch of smaller ships, but I didn't really give them any proper names.

The simple fact is that these NPCs don't try to avoid collisions at all, and I don't know if FD expects me to travel &lt;100M/s within the entirety of the no-fire zone, but I'm pretty sure the docking computer boosts within that zone anyway (I haven't used it in a while so I'm not sure if that's still/ever true).",EliteDangerous,Please fix the suicidal cops,https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/40qktm/please_fix_the_suicidal_cops/

First of all, I'm using x360ce to map everything so that GTAV thinks it's one Xbox 360 controller.


So I've technically got all this plugged in:

X-55 Throttle unit

X-55 Stick unit

G27 FFB Wheel

DS4 gamepad

and KB+M


And the trick is to make the gamepad, HOTAS and G27 all look like one controller, as GTAV only recognizes the first controller to input in the game. After binding everything to their respective controls for all my peripherals, I was able to remove deadzones so that the axis would activate on the moment the deadzone stopped, which was around 23% for both the stick and the wheel, so the controls would be registered by the game as soon as force was applied for these controllers. I also turned centering spring and FFB on for the wheel (it's obviously not true FFB, but a neat trick is that it allows vibrations to be applied as a force such as  undulations and impacts on other cars, which is better than nothing, and works surprisingly well, apart from the small side effect of the wheel vibrating whenever the phone rings).

My desk is fairly large, I have all the peripherals set up around the keyboard and I can still type at a reasonable pace, plus the good thing about having it set up so the game recognizes this all as one xbox controller is that I can go back to using whichever peripheral I want instantly. 

Feel free to ask any questions, I mean I know GTAV isn't designed as a simulator or any sort, but one thing led to another when setting up my stick for the jet, and suddenly I wanted to try everything. It's surprisingly a lot of fun to ride a bike with a wheel, and the mix-and-match of throttle and wheel actually allows me to captain a boat with a throttle lever and a wheel, like in real life!

I'm not sure if I'm just making connections where there aren't any, but a sidewinder snake has a pretty stumpy head, and you can quite clearly make out a triangle on the top of it's head from where the eyes are and the nose

A Cobra is the one with the flares around it's neck, so that makes sense that the ship is fairly flat and wide

The Asp's head has a sort of angled jaw, much like the sides of the Asp ship

And the Python seems a bit elongated and fairly curved, wider towards the back of the head with softer angles, which it also seems to be in relation

Now some of you might not have seen the store in the while, but here's what I found out:

Gradients between 2 colors is a possibility, as can be seen in the ""ignition"" paintjobs for the Cobra here

https://www.frontierstore.net/game-extras/elite-dangerous-game-extras/cobra-orange-ignition.html

We also know that they can make complex, highly-detailed and seemingly random patterns, such as splatters here

https://www.frontierstore.net/game-extras/elite-dangerous-game-extras/onionhead-livery-pack.html

And also, straight lines and stripes plainly exemplified best in this viper paintjob

https://www.frontierstore.net/game-extras/elite-dangerous-game-extras/viper-grey-ridgenose.html

not to mention, the pirate and onionhead paintjobs mean that they are capable of positioning and placing graphics and emblems.

-----------------------

**So in summary, here is some things I have taken out of that:**

* Gradients are possible with in-game tools (and possibly allowed, and in-between shades will not be considered extra colors if they are, as long as they are gradients)
* They probably won't dismiss complex patterns, judging by the paintjobs already available in-game
* The striped pattern for the viper follows the shape of it, meaning they are perfectly capable of making paintjobs that match the ship's shape, so stripy and segmented design submissions are also likely to be considered


**Extra notes:**

* I believe the paintjobs are vectorises, so they're not normal maps in the traditional sense (raster), they are drawn as shapes and this effectively means the skins for the ships have a resolution of infinity. If anyone has ever used Forza Motorsport 3's livery editor, or the Call of Duty emblem editor; on a basic level, it works the same way, except probably made with professional vector software such as Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape.
* Most of you probably knew this, but it's not as simple as a copy-paste on top of the ship; they will have to remake the paintjob submissions using their software. The template is just to give an idea of how the ship might look from a top down view, but ultimately, they will have to recreate the design in their environment, so be prepared to expect some changes to your design, such as positioning of graphics and such (they might not want to obstruct things such as emblem placement.)

--------------------

Lastly, to anyone who has yet to submit, I hope this helps with your submissions. it might make it easier for you to decide if you want to make it easier for the devs, or at least know what is possible with the game's tools so that you don't end up creating something that might exceed what they can currently do.",EliteDangerous,How do you think FD will pick the winner?,http://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/3hp9wr/how_do_you_think_fd_will_pick_the_winner/

Now though, it seems to happen even without the game. 

It started off in GTAV, so I'll post what I sent as a ticket, with some parts omitted. There's a lot of me guessing what could be going on, but feel free to correct me on anything

**I sent:**
&gt;Once the game actually loads (3D environments), the computer instantly turns off and restarts. I can't play this at all.

&gt;It started off as a problem where after a few hours of playing the game (this had only begun to happen after the recent update that added content such as the Progen T20 and the Coil Brawler) the monitor would lose video output, the speakers would loop the sound currently being played, and then the computer would turn off and restart, and Windows would report the problem as 'Bluescreen' (even though there is no bluescreen to speak of that I can see). The image link below shows the error message that Windows displays upon logging in.

&gt;http://i.imgur.com/pCg3XwM.png

&gt;After subsequent unsolicited restarts, the amount of playtime would become less and less before the computer would shut down and restart again. This would not happen when using the computer for other tasks and games, such as web browsing. As I've described, this went on until the PC would restart the moment the 3D environment loaded. The landing menu did not cause this, and it wouldn't matter if I had booted the game into Story or Online - as soon as the loading was finished, the screen would turn black and the PC would restart.

&gt;It did not matter if I had ran the game in safe mode - the PC seems to restart regardless of whether the settings were near max (what I usually played the game at) or at the absolute minimum.

&gt;PC Specs:
OS: Windows 7 Professional
GPU: Nvidia GTX 970 4GB
CPU: Intel core i3 2120
RAM: 16 GB DDR3

&gt;I'm not entirely sure if it was the new patch that caused this (Ill-gotten gains Part 2), but one of my friends have also been reporting problems with their performance (not as dire as mine to the point that the game is completely unplayable), and have had to lower their settings to minimum to get around 30 FPS (the settings they described are said to have been around PS4's graphics, the user in question is **redacted**).

&gt;Recap, a summary of my problem:
When the game finishes loading, the computer shuts off and restarts instantly. The game cannot be played at all whatsoever.

**To which the Rockstar Support staff responded:**

&gt;Hello **redacted**,

&gt;Thank you for contacting Rockstar Support.

&gt;BCC Code 116 usually indicates a driver installation issue. We'd suggest that you please uninstall your graphics drivers, restart your computer, and reinstall them from a fresh download.

&gt;If you continue to have issues, please update your ticket with a full DxDiag and MSInfo.

&gt;To get these files:

&gt;1) Close all open applications

&gt;2) Press the Windows key +'R' on your keyboard &gt; Type dxdiag &gt; Click OK &gt; Click Save all information

&gt;3) Press the Windows key +'R' on your keyboard &gt; Type msinfo32 &gt; Click OK &gt; Select File and then EXPORT and save the file as a text file(*.txt)

&gt;4) A screenshot/video of any error messages that you might be getting.

&gt;To take a screenshot (in Win Vista/7/8)

&gt;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screen-shots

&gt;Log in to your support ticket and then select the ""attach file"" option under the comments box to attach the files to your case. Alternatively respond to this email with the files attached.

&gt;Best regards,

&gt;**redacted**

**And then I responded with:**

&gt;I tried reinstalling the drivers, first by choosing the ""clean"" install option within the driver installer, which didn't work.

&gt;I then completely uninstalled the drivers, restarted the PC, then installed them again and then restarted again for the installation to complete, but GTAV still causes the PC to shutdown and restart the moment the game finishes loading (after the landing menu, when choosing story mode)

&gt;I already have DxDiag and MsInfo files attached to the ticket, but I've updated them just in case they've changed after the driver reinstall, as well as more screenshots of the error messages

**He hasn't replied to this yet, but then I sent another after using it for a while:**

&gt;After using the computer more, the PC seems to repeat the same issue with other DX11 games (DX10 games ran fine), and then it seems to have worsened, as this problem had soon after replicated itself (with the same BCCode 116 error) OUTSIDE of any 3D applications. After that, the monitor wouldn't even output after the Windows Logo animation.

&gt;After booting into Safe Mode, which DOES function correctly, I've had no issues in safe mode, and once again, uninstalled the latest Nvidia drivers. After doing so, booting the computer normally, my display showed picture again, and I was able to use the computer for hours uninterrupted on what I think are Windows's own core graphics drivers.

&gt;It seems that it is highly likely a driver issue, but after 3 clean driver re-installations of the latest Nvidia drivers, I feel as if it's an inherent error that belonged to the current version of the drivers, rather than a corrupt driver installation which is causing the problem, that was either beginning the moment the updated drivers were installed or something in the game might have triggered it (I don't really know much about graphics software, but GTAV is one of the most demanding games I have ever ran on this machine).

&gt;Another thing that confuses me is that it seems that one of my other friends who also uses a GTX 970 video card, with possibly the same drivers, has not been experiencing these issues. (He had experienced a driver crash which lasted 20 minutes, but this didn't shut down and restart his PC.)

&gt;My build is different to his with the other components, and I would hazard a guess that it could also be that the driver issues are just incompatible with my hardware setup. Lastly, in the worst case scenario, my video card might be damaged (I'm still able to use it with generic drivers, but maybe something the drivers call for require accessing parts of the hardware, and each call is shortening the lifespan of the said part until it cannot function, and the generic drivers don't require it.) Right now, the video card is being used to output to my monitor, but the official drivers for the card are not installed.

**And finally, the Rockstar staff replied with:**

&gt;Hello **redacted**,

&gt;Thank you for getting back to us.

&gt;Based on your symptoms, it would indeed sound like you may have a hardware issue on hand. Have you attempted to reach out to your video card manufacturer? This would be the next step that we would advise.

&gt;Best regards,

&gt;**redacted**
Rockstar Support

If you guys need the DxDiag or MSInfo files, or any of the extra screenshots I have of the error message (just scrolled down in the error box), please do ask, I really want to solve this issue soon.

Summary: 
Latest Nvidia graphics drivers are causing my computer to reboot itself, upto the point where the computer wouldn't output video to the monitor beyond the windows animation, unless I booted it into safe mode.

The computer seems to be fine to use with the drivers uninstalled, WITH the card plugged in, but I haven't tried playing any games without the drivers, seeing as it actually has a monitor output.

**I know it's a bit long winded, but I will be very grateful for anyone that knows anything about this.**


**EDIT:**
I've gone a bit further and tried out a different card (older AMD HD6870 video card) but it had no video output at all as opposed to the GTX 970 currently in my build, which I'm assuming is autodetected by the motherboard as the primary display output source. I'm going try setting the graphics adapter in the BIOS to try out the AMD card again, as there's no reason it should be broken. What happens when I use the AMD card is that neither the I/O plate's DVI port or the GPU outputs anything.

I've also tried used DDU (previously the 3DGuru driver sweeper) on safe mode to remove Nvidia drivers, and still didn't work properly after a reinstall. In another situation, I've also tried reseating the GPU and reconnecting the dual 6-pin power connectors, which didn't seem to work either.
