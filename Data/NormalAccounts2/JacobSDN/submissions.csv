I believe that I am noticing weaker signal being reported as higher bars. For example the phone showed 3 bars for -116 on 25000 Mhz. I would understand if it was 800 Mhz. I personally did not like when Sprint changed the technology indicator to report 3G when you were connected to 1x. Yes, I know that 1x is technically a 3G technology, but I prefer the 1x indicator.

I don't know if Sprint is doing this to give customers the idea that things are better than they are, but I don't think it is a good idea. In the case of 1x vs 3g. Customers coming from a GSM carrier (AT&amp;T or T-Mobile) have a different idea of what 3g should be, and it isn't similar to what the experience with 1x is. Customers coming from Verizon, would understand it's a slower ""mode"". By the way Verizon 1x is very good for what it is, based on my experience on a Sprint roaming device. 

In the case of signal, if the customer has sees 3 or 4 bars, and is getting service indicative of less bars. They are going to think that even with almost full bars, the service is terrible. 

People aren't leaving Sprint because of the amount of bars on their phones(per say). They are leaving for a number of factors, most glaringly customer service. Companies with terrible products but good customer service tend to have lower churn rates. Then there is the network, that granted, is getting better every month, but still considered behind others. When people compare similar phones, and see the Sprint version having more bars, but worst performance, they will likely think it is an inferior product.
