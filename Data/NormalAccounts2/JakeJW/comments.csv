7,"I was brought up by my dad who was a huge fan, and that just carried on the legacy for me, when I hit the ages of playing through MGS by myself and understanding what was happening was relieving for me, also out of every game I have ever played MG is one series that I kinda know as much as I possibly could know about it, which is a good feeling! But it's a legacy thing for me, gutted it's the final Kojima game, who knows  what the future entails. V has come to.",2015-09-30 02:38:07+00:00,cvivcfu,1,t3_3mwb0u,11924,metalgearsolid

18,"I seen them live just after CD came out, I went to Newcastle to watch them, and it was so amazing, they finished with SYNAW which was 15 minutes long due to Rory's guitar keeping on unsyncing so they did it half acoustic/acapella and then the rest with the electric guitar. 

But I'll just have to sit down and have a good listen of the newer music and album",2015-07-23 10:30:14+00:00,ctd7f4w,2,t1_ctd4n8b,10887,EnterShikari

25,"I believe the same thing, I was so hyped for Machinist and I still am, I think I'm going to main a MCH, just because like someone said there will be updates that will enable our DPS to match other classes. 

But so far I'm enjoying, I was just in a dunegon with a PLD, AST and DRG. Now obviously the PLD was top of the emnity list and then I was 2nd. For having a low dmg output I was still creating more emnity than the DRG so I must of been doing something similar to his dmg output. 

All in all... I actually find it quite fun, and shall carry on playing a MCH",2015-06-23 13:53:29+00:00,csfvld1,1,t3_3asv0s,27908,ffxiv
