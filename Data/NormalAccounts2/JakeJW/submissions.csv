I've recently been offered a job at a trendy bar round the corner from my current cocktail bar that I've been there for a year.

I accepted the job with no regrets as I was not guaranteed manager job here, even though they said they were training me but said I would not get it until winter 2016. But the staff I couldn't take anymore as they bend the owners back demanding things and ruling the roost.

Anyway I'm really happy with my choice and the new staff I will be managing are really passionate which is great. Plus it's going back to just doing day shifts, so I'm running the kitchen and bar, but only work on the bar, if you know what I mean.

I'm just after any tips really, I understand how to treat people, as my last managers are pretty horrible and just shout at everyone because they can't do anything themselves and blame it on other people.

But yeah any advice would be appreciated!

Thanks!

So I got my MCH to 60 and have gone off it, I have gone back to tanking and got my WAR to 50 now. I would like to ask for your rotations or like maybe the gist of them. At the moment I seem to run out of TP too quick, I'm used to spamming flash as a PLD, so I was MP. 

I'm not sure If I do things the correct way but I Keep aggro which is my main goal to be fair.

So yeah, any useful macros, rotations, help would be appreciated!

But to start off ES were my favourite band growing up through school. My step sister at the time listened to them alot and I kind of picked it up and just fell in love. So I wen't and bought TTTS LTD ( the black case with the stickers and stuff) and just listened to it on repeat and made all my friends listen to them whenever we played music and that. Then came CD which I was 14-15 at the time and didn't really understand the lyrics and was enjoying the music and my favourite song was Wall of that Album. I was also finding all these old EP songs like Keep it on Ice and Nodding Acquaintance which once again just fell in love with. 

Then Tribalism, Quelle Surprise and Destablise came out and I was still listening but realised how much they had started changing and so was my music taste, I just started the Dubstep phase and thought it was cool. So I wasn't that bothered but the music started like making more sense to my older self. I wasn't that much into politics so I kind of just started not paying as much attention to the band. 

AFFOC came out and I actually went and bought it again. Forgot to say bought CD aswell. Anyway I was listening to it and I wasn't as interested anymore. My favourite song was System.....Meltdown combination. Now I'm not too sure why I didn't enjoy it back then, but thinking back to it It must of been the spoken word lyrics that sort of put me off. I was expecting like for them to go back to TTTS. which they didn't.

So that brings me to now. I have had a sudden urge to listen to TTTS again and I love it. I remember all the words and why I fell in love the band. I have heard a few new ones but the politics of the songs put me off.

I know Rou does it as a median for explaining his points and that but I love the gimicked boy and girl from Anything can happen in the next half hour. like is there anyway for me to listen to the band again without cringing at the lyrics? Like I remember listening to Ghandi Mate, and when he like gets over the top, and the rest of the band say 'calm down, remember Ghandi' It just made me cringe so much like I don't even know why really.

But yeah like I said this isn't a dig but I just want a way to listen to them but make them have my love like they did back when my teenage self loved them that much. It has been almost 3-4 years I've properly listened to them, but love The really old stuff. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this and I hope you all can help me :)

TLDR : Trying to love the band again, but the political lyrics really put me off. I want them to be like when they made TTTS stuff again, but I know that won't happen. Anyway I can fall in love again?

So I started my journey as a PLD loved it and then just grew tired of it, I started crafting got them all to at least 15 and then my DOW/DOM classes all to 15 and then some to 30. 

Now Heavensward has dropped I wanted to be a MCH as I have for a while since I heard we could use guns. It's now 54 and I'm slowly becoming bored of it because of the RNG it's frustrating me. I'm trying a different approach of trying to be a healer which is fun and I enjoy, but as a AST I lose so much mana and get shouted at in dungeons :(

I'm currently doing the MSQ as my MCH but like I'm not sure if I want to try SCH but my ARC is only 25 or just keep going, I've only done turn 1 of binding coil aswell which I'm annoyed it and I feel like I've missed so much out, just powered through the MSQ, 

Is there anything I desperately need to do as side quests, to unlock dungeons or anything? 

Also Alex seems so far away to me aswell haha my MCH is only 123 ilvl. 

I've also got no 'ponies' only completed Garuda Ex none of the others but done all he low/high dungeons! 

Any tips for me or any help will be gratefully appreciated!

P.S. Sorry if English grammar and punctuation is crap, I'm doing this post on my phone! Haha thanks! ",ffxiv,Stuck at what to do next also I feel like I've missed a lot out.,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3didbp/stuck_at_what_to_do_next_also_i_feel_like_ive/
