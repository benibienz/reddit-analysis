1,"There wasn't zero evidence, I just didn't want to make the starting post longer than It had to be. Just before I found the gold missing we had an encounter where both of out characters had stayed close to one another and even separated from the group a bit. I had casted guidance on her a few times as well during that time and didn't know how she used the extra help. She also put her arm around me for a bit towards the end too. So out of everyone in the party my character had the most contact with her before her gold went missing.

My cleric didn't think ""oh, check the rogue, they have high dex and can steal from me ect."" She thought ""That girl has been watching me strangely and she's been very close to me before this all happened and even had her arm around me for a bit at the end, that would give ehr amble time to take something off me.""",2016-04-23 12:36:52+00:00,d2e7bfs,4,t1_d2e4u7h,9388,DnD
2,"Just before we had had an encounter where the rogue had to stay very close to my character for me to cast guidance on her a few times. And at one point she even put her arm around my shoulder for a while. So thats why I checked her above the others. Also, my character knows she's a shady character so she stereotyped her a bit as well.",2016-04-23 12:29:45+00:00,d2e76ev,2,t1_d2e48i9,11670,DnD

6,"I'm confused by your rudeness? I was just explaining how he knows how much gold we have at all times. And DM is god in games, he creates the world and the rules of the world ect. he even voices each characters god. Thats all I meant by god, its a playful title. I didn't mean to upset someone with it o.o",2016-04-23 03:48:12+00:00,d2dxtvp,4,t1_d2dxp4s,284,DnD
7,"He is DM, He is god. Of course he knows how much gold everyone has.We play on Roll20 so He can just access all of our character sheets at anytime. And besides, we both pick pocketed each other, he would need to look at our sheets to tell the other how much gold they got from pick pocketing.",2016-04-23 03:38:38+00:00,d2dxk41,2,t1_d2dxgrf,190,DnD
8,"I switch between a Raven and an Owl. It just depends on what I think I am going to need most that game. I almost always have flying Familiars because of their utility. They can get anywhere quick.

Raven's Ability - Mimicry: The raven can mimic simple sounds it has heard, such as a person whispering, a baby crying, or an animal chittering. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check.

The raven is great for scouting and distractions or leading someone away from an area you want to get to.

Owl Ability - Flyby: The owl doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.
The owl is great for combat seeing as you can use your familiar to deliver touch spells. 

My owl will use flyby to swoop in and merely touch an enemy so I can deliver my Shocking Grasp spell and then fly out of range with out provoking an attack of opp and getting one shot.

It really just depends on what you want to use them for, there are alot of different beasts you can use but like I said, flying ones seem to be the most useful because you can scout and see through their eyes, getting an aerial view to an enemy is a great plus! Just be sure to have them fly high for their protection!

Ahh! There we go! A Dev answer! Good to see it! I have had so many conversations with my DM and Party about this! Now I can know the correct answer, straight from a devs mouth.. errr, keyboard. Thanks for the links!",2016-03-11 05:56:59+00:00,d0voxad,6,t1_d0vopig,498,DnD

If you scroll down to a comment on that same page that is where I found my first few quotes about the wording of the alter self spell. are one of the answers one of the Devs? because That link you posted to defend your point is the same link I used to defend my point haha xD",2016-03-11 05:52:34+00:00,d0vot48,4,t1_d0vohc0,744,DnD
11,"&gt; Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes.

But did you read the quote? It spells it out almost perfectly, why would they mesh Unarmed strikes with Natural weapons? Being armed means you can be disarmed. but her claws can't be dropped or taken away (unless you wanna start hacking or force her to unshift) She can't be disarmed, therefore she is unarmed. but I would love to hear it from the devs! Then I know I have solid knowhow on it thats 100% correct. Id rather be proven wrong than play the game incorrectly. I'll keep looking for some answers by the devs on that, but for now I see them as unarmed strikes",2016-03-11 05:46:11+00:00,d0von66,4,t1_d0vohc0,361,DnD
12,"I'm inclined to think her bite and claw attacks are unarmed. Look at this wording in the handbook when talking about the Alter self spell: ""Natural Weapons. You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using it."" That right there seems pretty easy to understand. the claws you grow are unarmed strikes.",2016-03-11 05:35:41+00:00,d0vod4m,2,t1_d0vnrna,1303,DnD
13,"Then its so not worth the lost level when I can just Bark skin for 16 AC anyway. Hmm I'll have to talk to my DM about the Conjure woodland beings and Martial arts stuff and see if he can ""refund"" me my Monk lvl seeing as the only reason I multi classed was because he said I could have all that stuff. Guess I'll have to put on the big girl pants and force nerf myself haha!",2016-03-11 05:27:25+00:00,d0vo50h,5,t1_d0vnx6j,482,DnD
14,"yes they can, what you polymorph into depends on the targets CR lvl, not the caster. ""The new form can be any beast whose Challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level, if it doesn't have a Challenge rating).

15,Hmm If all that is true then I shouldn't have multi classed into Monk at all! It doesn't give me any benefits at all :O,2016-03-11 05:18:19+00:00,d0vnw4e,3,t1_d0vnu14,125,DnD
16,"I'm just telling you how my DM has played it all out. I brought up that theory about not being able to choose the creatures and just picking the CR to my DM but he said it doesn't out right state that so he is just gonna play it the way it reads. 

I a new player, so I'm just stating things my DM has told me, if thats not hoe Unarmored defense works then I'll look it over again and bring it to his attention! Maybe thats why I'm OP, he's not reading them correctly

18,"The fight hasn't started yet, he doesn't even know I know he just murdered my colleagues (Thats why we are going to fight) So I have time to prepare. I just leveled up so I can learn web. This is my first character and I've only been playing for about 2 months so I still don't know a lot of the spells. Those are amazing tips, by the way!

So I just really need to make sure I put him to sleep? The rest should be easy. I'll tie him up(can I just buy manacles somewhere?) and run away as far as I can and still hit him with spells. Then I think I'll try to cast Chromatic orb at 3rd lvl (I dont have fireball or lightning bolt) then stinking cloud and if he still isn't awake I'll cast invisibility. Does that sound alright? or should I learn lightning bolt?)",2015-12-11 03:28:25+00:00,cxuxxsp,2,t1_cxuwf39,2460,DnD
