I had a situation where my Cleric was told all of my 34 gold was suddenly gone. Naturally I check the rogue and my DM says I don't find my gold pouch but I find hers. My dm says she has 17 gold. I figure she's stashed my gold pouch somewhere and take hers to hold ransom and teach her a lesson not to steal from others. planning that once the rogue comes clean and gives my cleric her gold back my character would return the rogues gold. My character then spends the rest of the game upset because she had been saving her gold to send to her brother back at home. Hoping the rogue will come to her and fess up or give her gold back. nothing happens. Next game zone of truth gets cast by another cleric in the party for a different reason but the gold is brought back up. Now its out in the open that the rogue stole from me and I stole from her. I tell her that we can just give each other's gold back so we have the same amount that we had before this all started and that she should learn not to steal from others. She is confused ""But you have all the gold! I have nothing"" She's still in the zone of truth and out of character she is confused as well. Turns out when I stole her money the DM told her I had stolen her money and mine combined. (51g) But only told me that I had her 17g, leading me to believe she still had my coin. He messed up and didn't give us correct info.


Now it just looks like I kept both of our gold this entire time and lied about not having any gold to send to my brother. A characters in the party had great rp and sweet moments comforting my character and learning about each other. Now that all down the drain because they think I was faking. The entire party thinks I'm a lying stealing cheating cleric when that not true at all.Now everything she had done has been cast in an evil light because the DM gave me wrong information! But now its been played out and my group says I can't change it. 


What do you all do if you are given incorrect info that effects the characters in a huge way? do you wipe the slate clean and rp out what really would have happened or do you accept the losses to character building?

My Dm has let me add Martial arts to my beast shapes so what ever I shift into I get an extra attack (Which is OP with a scorp, 4 attacks?!) 

My AC is always 15 because of Monks unarmored defense.

When ever I go into a battle I just cast Conjure woodland beings and get 8 pixies. They can cast polymorph, fly, sleep and entangle (among other things) I tell them how to spend their first 2 turns then morph into a scorp or bear and go ham. My pixies are super OP on their own, one high lvl spell = 8 high lvl spells? If there is a big enough enemy I tell 2-3 of them to cast sleep or poly on it to make sure one of this hits then tell 2 to cast entangle to make the ground hard to get through then the rest to cast fly on my party members.

If we are in a tough spot I can get them all out of it, which is really handy.

Plus I took the resilient trait and now I am proficient to con saves so I can hold onto my spells pretty well. 

Also, If I'm in a tight spot I can have a pixie poly me into a trex (154 Hp) and totally wreck everything. (Which I did, I was also flying as well. A flying T-rex)

The Pixies have their own turn order, so that ends up evening things out a bit but I still think i'm too strong.

I feel like I have some really OP things going for my character. Is this right? I want to nerf some stuff... but I also don't. Its so much fun to think of new and interesting ways to tackle situations with my pixies. AM I OP? Or am I just thinking I am?",DnD,My lvl 9 Druid/Monk Seems REALLY OP,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/49x91r/my_lvl_9_druidmonk_seems_really_op/

Next game Me and a rogue are most likely going to fight to the death and I want to know some good tips on countering stuff he can do because I am very squishy(41 health)! We are both lvl 6 and I don't think I could handle being hit by him too many times.

I'm planning on having mage armor and trying to have a surprise round starting off with a 3rd lvl Chromatic orb them going straight into Mirror image. I know I can most likely get away if he doesn't one shot me, but I don't know any great damage spells. What are some strats you all would use?
