45,"Question 1: [1:50] - “What do you think of the Nurse with a Purse phenomenon? It is true that ‘hot girls’ sometimes show up at the doors of beta males once they have become “used up” by the alphas. But another funny thing happens many years later in a man’s life cycle. A typical scenario my girlfriends and I see, is that the man invests in his prime, in the hottest girl, not necessarily the one with the best values, and when a man gets old he realizes that the hot girl took everything he had and he is broke and alone. He tries to woo women in their 40s or 50s, the same types he rejected for the hot girl who took all his resources, because these women now have a home, money and sometimes nursing or care taking experience. Guess what happens to these old men. The same thing.”

Question 2: [1:07:14] - “During the American Industrial Revolution, work conditions were terrible, there was no oversight in business, and no minimum wage. Also, child labor was a huge source of labor in industry. Robber barons were known to take short term losses to benefit from small companies. Is this a problem with the free market, or have I just not educated myself about the era enough?”

Question 3: [1:42:00] - “Why is it that every time I get involved in a romantic relationship I tend to become very jealous and suspicious over them? It seems like this throws my emotions all over the place, and makes me feel powerless and depressed. How can I understand this problem and overcome my paranoia?”

Question 4: [2:43:05] - “I'm done with the ‘Affordable’ Care Act. I'm not renewing and I will accept the tax penalty when I file 2016 taxes. My reasoning is that instead of paying $2500 a year for something that may or may not happen, why not pay the penalty, sock the insurance stipend away in a savings account for when I need healthcare? 

I would rather be in control of my money, in control of my life (to whatever degree), and give the proverbial middle finger to the state (whilst handing over my tax penalty with my free hand. What do you think of the ‘Affordable’ Care Act and people like myself who are making the decision to forgo insurance coverage due to the cost?”",2016-02-01 03:56:13+00:00,czjcdal,1,t3_43c0bg,181443,fdrpodcasts

People received real means of causing massive physical harm or even death to those ""traitors"" whose political preferences are wrong, some can ruin lives or careers just by pointing them as a ""separatist"" out loud to the right people. Everyone is directed against each other through the heavy abuse of state propaganda. Do you think this is a possibility for the Western world? The rise of the new governments to replace those that are failing, just to use the huge already existing apparatus for oppression and militarization? Or is it more specific to societies with a historically different ideological leaning?”

Question 2: [1:01:15] - “I understand what fiat currency is, what I don't understand is; Does the number of digits in all the bank accounts in our country match the amount of currency in circulation? And maybe you could explain negative interest to me?”

Question 3: [1:22:33] - “I consider myself a scientific thinker, and like to dabble in some philosophy, I have also worked hard to maintain my Christian faith while doing this (an effort which most of my colleagues have seemed to abandon for one reason or another). 

I'm looking to challenge myself by talking to you. The scope of the conversation, I would prefer to revolve around the question ""how can someone be both logical and a Christian"" as this question seems to come up in my day to day life to whomever is unlucky enough to ask me; but if we divert, we divert.

Why on earth would I invest in a service that encourages fraud and engages in censorship in this manner?  It is my obligation to warn others of your irresponsible behavior.  Pointing out that borrowers are using stolen documents to open up their loans is not ""harassment,"" but statements of objectively verifiable reality.  Meanwhile, you *are* engaging in censorship to cover up your irresponsible conduct and rewarding borrowers for committing identity theft.
