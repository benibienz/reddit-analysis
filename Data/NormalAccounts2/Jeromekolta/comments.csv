35,"I understand that his life is a lot different now then three years ago, but i don't see why that would change the way he RAPS. His lyrics changing from talking about drugs to religion, love and his daughter makes 100% sense to me and I love all of it. But his flow should still sound similar to Acid Rap. This is only my opinion though",2016-05-16 04:21:14+00:00,d374wjc,2,t1_d374om2,477,ChanceTheRapper
36,"I completly understand that it grows on you. First listen I like 3 or 4 songs, now I like at least 10 songs. The mixtape has definitely grown on me since it dropped and I know that it is a great mixtape.... But Chance's acid rap word play and flow was what made me fall in love with his music and the only real song that has the acidrap flow to me is Angels which is definitely my favorite song at the moment. Im not trying to downplay his mixtape its just I feel like the signature chance flow is missing. Still LOVE the mixtape though!",2016-05-16 04:19:06+00:00,d374udh,2,t1_d373vo6,2001,ChanceTheRapper

103,"I've been a huge Kendrick fan since section 80 so I gm understand the cohesiveness of his albums and the full story of an album but it's hard for me to visualize a story for certain songs. Never catch me is a good song but I can't vividly see a story when I'm listening to it. The only songs I've heard that do that are the art of peer pressure, sing about me, u. Those are the only ones i can name at the moment lol ",2016-05-02 16:01:25+00:00,d2pqv75,2,t1_d2pf5qx,28278,KendrickLamar
