I do love this mixtape though and i understand how great of a mixtape it is but it just doesn't feel like the chance from 3 years ago. Both acid rap and coloring book have the great vibes that chance is known for but i feel like coloring book is less rap than it is singing. What got me on chance was his quick witty word play and flow and i feel like he doesn't really spit hard bars on this new tape. The meaning and lyrics on every song is amazing don't get me wrong and also every song sounds good sonically but i was just hoping for some acid rap flow. I still think this mixtape is amazing but to me acid rap is a lot better. Obviously though the mixtape has only been out for a few days and its too soon to fully judge it. Who knows in a few months i might like this one way more than acid rap. ,ChanceTheRapper,Ive been a huge fan of Chance since 10 day and acid rap is my all time favorite mixtape...,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChanceTheRapper/comments/4jjfd1/ive_been_a_huge_fan_of_chance_since_10_day_and/
