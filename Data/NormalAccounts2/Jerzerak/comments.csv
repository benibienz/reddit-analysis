- Turning off ""Threaded Optimization"" or ""OpenGL Threading"" in the graphics card control panel ([example](http://i.imgur.com/ciwc6.jpg)) on the java.exe &amp; minecraft.exe processes (Note: you may receive slightly better performance if disabled globally)

My best suggestion however, is to go with the Standard version of Optifine for 1.7.10 which you can download from [here](http://optifined.net/adload.php?f=OptiFine_1.7.10_HD_D1.jar) (this is a link to the official Optifine downloads page).
