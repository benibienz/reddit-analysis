Your comments I am sure, if I cared to look, will probably prove only that you're incapable of critical thought, or have some agenda, like me. In terms of climate change denial, oh man, you have no idea what my thoughts are on that, nor could you comprehend the difference between anthropocentric climate change and the reality that the climate changes everyday. My criticism of climate change only endeavours to explicate the fallibility of the human dimension and the monetization of carbon as a market tool.

5,"My concerns are focused on the pragmatism of the matter at hand, and the general concern for better ideals to strive for. Yes, you are right inclusiveness is a tenet or foundation of Cascadian values and cultural identity. However, identity politics, as we talk about it today, has somehow corrupted these multicultural values by only contributing it to a political discussion pf you versus them. Identity politics usurps historical fabrications with more fabrications, it does not focus on the reality of life, and yet promises somehow to enhance it. Identity politics  is nothing else but self-serving in the political arena, the recent election proves the fact that identity politics serves no one, and both candidates practiced and spoke about it haphazardly and reactive. 
And in the end the only recourse of action is to be misandric or misogynist, racist, or whatever, us versus them...

 My problem is with the individuals or collectives who insist that identity politics is the only value which you have to attach to politics, at least one canidate managed to transcend that discourse. The presidential election, and your views on who won or not, does not, and simply cannot, be a driving force in the goal of Cascadia.  Why? 

Because it's based on a false identity and a haphazard approach towards social construction. ",2016-11-19 20:10:44+00:00,da7b3vc,3.0,t1_da760d6,7530.0,Cascadia

7,"While I am a fan of people coming together and promoting succession movements, specifically Cascadia, be wary of organized events like this one.  I am concerned that the notion of the type of get together/value building exercise being proposed by Yes Cascadia will be inherently based on identity politics, and probably will be presided over by a bunch of people who have already hijacked the movement and will hide their own biases and projections in attempt to achieve their own goals, whatever those may be... as per their facebook feed 

""Just to be clear. The Yes Cascadia campaign rejects all hate. We believe in an inclusive movement, that shows the beauty of this region, it's people and our incredible diversity. We reject racism, hate, fear, sexism, white supremacy, or any type of discrimination based on sexual orientation, religion, personal beliefs or choices. We look forward to building a coalition movement that empowers every person and community, and that incorporates and provides space for indigenous, POC, and traditionally marginalized communities to advocate with their own voices, and find solidarity and support. Thank you!"" 

While these notions of 'inclusiveness' etc, are noble values to hold, they tend to become perverted and actually exclusive. Identity politics does not represent the Cascadia project as a whole, and it does not answer, economic, social, and cultural challenges.

 Simply put there are more prescient concerns in a Cascadia secessionist movement, and these concerns are far beyond identity politics.",2016-11-18 15:17:17+00:00,da5pnpm,1.0,t3_5dksw6,35193.0,Cascadia

 Let me make it clear, that the persons, or inter-locked circles of power that substantiate the mainstay of the globalist agenda consist of elites, and their elite networks. Of course this network is supported by people like you and me who have been indoctrinated into our own horizon of perspective in relation to being governed and controlled.

I suggested that globalism as an ideology is hypocritical and the notion of being 'progressive', is in fact more dangerous and impactful on the male species way of being and doing. 
 
I implied that the effects of globalism were in fact detrimental to a more natural and epiphenomenal social and cultural perspective. I could contrast the sisters of globalism with its ideological brothers in nationalism, but for the most part both ideologies have negative ethics.

33,"The Trudeau youth, TY,comprise a large collection of post-millennials who have become inspired, or infected, by an ideology of political correctness and human rights. 

The TY have an inability to be self-critical, or even self-aware, and hence struggle with the most fundamental tenets of logic or rationality. Most TYs are embroiled in a quasi-self-directed narritive based on the egotistic notion of gaining some form of mass-cultural cognizance by the only terms of adapting to their ideology; Even uglier, they attempt to trump the value of individual actions, economy, and practice, attempting to socially construct a false notion of collective equality and praxis. Overall, the TY create the misperceived notions of what actually is Canadian culture, and try to create what values they think should really be promoted in Canadian society. TY are the tomorrow's tyrants and SJW.

TYs declare human rights for all, that everything is okay, and that everyone should be provided for. They ignore the reality of life, and worse, promote agendas that encourage ignorance of the reality of life. 

For example, TY promote misandry via promotion of the many examples of feminism* Which by definition ironically promotes the idea of the hatred of men by the notion that feminism relies on the patriarchy as the social-cultural hegemon; yet denies its own ideological promotion of matriarchy. More than likely TY's fascination of feminism stems from Trudeausian tendicies to reflect only the principles of the charitable cause, because I am a girl. 

TYs also produce irrational thoughts on the environment. The have the idea that a price on carbon is the ideal value signifier in which to engage environment policy. While the moral may seem progressively or idealistically normal the ethic is one of disaster, in terms of actual economy. A tax is a tax, it does not necessarily mean social engineering, but in this case the ethic of social engineering is being played out- TY have a poor sense of play, and an even worse sense of sportsmanship. 

TYs do not make very good hockey players. 


 NO doubt ignorance, uncritical reflections of society, and a father's harsh judgement shape the psychological and social traits of TY. Jesuit order, conflict with a bimbo younger mother and a stubborn older father transmutes one soul in context of child rearing.

39,"I am saying the energy giants don't have nearly as much sway with the Liberal party, as they do the Conservatives, same as US, i.e. right centered parties. The Liberal party is highly embedded with certain Canadian corporate and financial interests.  Ergo, Canada reflects American elite, power and control systems, through the same reflective social and cultural forces.

 I am responding verbatim to your post. 

Canada has probably some of the harshest public pressure put upon protesters of all spectres. Canadian police tactics are on par if not better in masking public discretion than American police praxis. Think, agent provocateurs, blackmail, bribery, and other nefarious tactics that forces in America have used, 'sarcastically', unlike anyother and the same, to a lesser scale can be seen as it is used in Canada by various means.

Canada has entirely copied the US media model, in fact, Canadian media programs far outpace American cultural programing. Think, Hollywood north, Michael J. Fox, Nickelback. 

Canada, at both; follows, matches, and exceeds, American pace in many, all, some, and none; social, economic, cultural, technical, and biological being. Think medicare, technical prowess, social intelligences, etc; in comparison to achievement   

Fuck if I know anything about fracking.... But the technical details aside, fracking, and Alberta, are only abundant when energy prices, aka oil are high.... this is a geopolitical question. 

You are right, high$=jobs

Your attachment to unions is only mired by the fact that unions are just like the modal cabals fronting major political parties, actors represented in corporate power, and financial power, etc.; are for the most part controlled by the same erroneous ideologies and affective individuals. That is individuals with human factor deficiencies, unions don't equate to freedom, nor liberty, capital exposition is a sad tail of elucidating our collective enslavement, better expositions are found in oneself, not in another. ergo unions represent the antithesis, and the antithetical rapprochement towards our own economic and social freedom. 

Face it we are born and die,.

49,"The free market was outlined many years ago I suggest you look it up. Moreover, increased taxes don't necessarily correlate to reduced emissions, that is an illusion.. People are still going to need to drive to work, or use transport, w/ carbon taxes, and the carbon monetization schemes, all that will be more expensive  *specifically for the middle class *with the illusion that it is helping the environment.

Moreover, I am not calling for an emissions reduction plan, nor do I think that is a necessary step in Canadian society. There are hundred of different environmental programs that could be put in place to the would increase the overall environmental health... The countries with the real problem with emissions are China, India, and smaller more densely populated countries... Why should we sacrifice our economic livelihood for them... 
 

The free market is a bit of a cop out, I in fact believe that it is in the best interests for governments to compel larger corporate forces to the will of the people and not the other way around, i.e. the government compelling individual middle class people. The strategy in the past that worked well was creating manufacturing standardization, some of it is even industry centered on a global scale i.e. Iso, imperial, but governments can restrict imports if imports don't meet certain emission standards.

 If we wanted to lower our emission footprint we need to develop our economy and create incentive on a socio economic technical scale that makes the movers and shakers of  real capital holdings spend their money on grander schemes; rather than have a government based on the morality and ethics of taxation. 

Yet taxation of carbon is hiding the fact that the entire plan is also being used as a social engineering tool. The impact of a carbon tax is specific to punishing our collective behavior in order to  reduce the somewhat modicum of waste in emissions we as a nation produces. The carbon monetization plan is a misguided attempt to socially engineer the economic and environmental outcomes of the Canadian people.

51,"The carbon market, carbon trading, etc, all of it is an illusionary financial scam that simply will end up dragging our economy down into the greater rabbit hole of international carbon trading regimes, and other ill-fated technocratic economic regimes.

Why? Because Carbon monetization is an attempt to monetize our economic waste, and place the burden directly on the people, and not the corporations who, or which, have directed the use of carbon energy for the last several decades, and have actually hindered progress towards other novel energy designs. That said, the burden will always come down on regular people.

More than likely Carbon monetization will lead to the increase in carbon taxes, and the creation of carbon markets where financial instruments will be created and traded that will create an even bigger illusion. That is we cannot fix the costs of our civilization by quantifying every aspects of our lives, the only notion being served by carbon monetization is the false belief that it is for the 'collective good'.

The monetization of carbon can make no promises as a step towards solving global environmental issues, i.e. the use of fossil fuel use in China. The monetization of Carbon in Canada will only add another stranglehold to the prosperity of the middle class, as the creeping regressive nature of pricing carbon makes things simply more expensive, i.e. your travel to work, your daily need for food, all will be more. And do not pull that 'revenue neutral' crap, who taxes- then gives it all back, what social value does that serve?

While it may bring a certain level of satisfaction to some, that 'someone is doing something about the environment', there is no rational argument that can be made that says monetizing Carbon will actually fix our environment, or lead to alternative energy production. The unintended consequences of this type of action will only benefit a few, and burden everyone else.

*Remember 12 calories of energy (mostly fossil fuels) goes into making 1 calorie of food.

61,"I just finished writing a response to your post. I have always had a problem with people, regardless of sex or gender, identifying as feminists when it comes to promoting the idea of gender equality ...

In fact I just wrote a 500 word response to this trying to explain how feminism is antithetical to gender equality. The reason, feminism's definition is based on the notion of patriarchy, look it up. While this notion exists, it is circumstantial to the relativity of a few, and absent in the majority of society. The fact is that patriarchy is not a central notion of western society, it may be in the middle east eg. 

In essence, I have always been flummoxed by people who claim to be feminists; and how feminists identify and objectify all the ill-thought out cultural and social constructions as somehow tainted with patriarchy or male, white, privallege. Feminists distort social and gender relations, marriage, and roles in the workplace. Feminisms, contradict, ignore, and perhaps distort male issues in all these areas, and there are several more examples. 

Feminism somehow tries to paint a picture of inequitable gender relations, while ignoring basic factors like biology, chemistry, and socially collective end goals or values of our species; polarizing not bridging the gap of gender equality; whereas, the facts of economic and social reality continue to prove that men, on the whole, and on average, in comparison to women, have it much worse off in life than women, economically, socially, and culturally- not in all indicators, but in most when converging both male and female indicators, facts and empirical data. 

So that when feminists claim that they are for 'gender equality', they are in fact making a political claim. Feminism rhetorically  pushes a political ideology onto cultural life. The meaning of feminism claims is that somehow the gender dynamic continues to be unjust or inequitable. That is, feminists continue to ignore, or at least obfuscate the strengths and weakness of both sexes, while focusing on their own and ignoring the other.

The culture of motherhood instills the logic of creation, and the instincts to care and nurture an emerging entity; this is what is in essence our collective life purpose, for most people, give or take.

Researchers of all types can infer that the idealization of one subject creates antithesis in another, ergo abortion rights. However, isn't the concept of abortion always antithetical to motherhood. Pro-life and pro-choice discourses disrupt that independent and meaningful creation of a human being so much in society that we really forget the meaning of Eros in ersatz to Thrantos.Life, birth, and motherhood being the exact opposite of abortion. 

So the very concept of individual choice and independence of value creation needs to be addressed in this type of dialogue.

75,"The carbon market, carbon trading, etc, all of it is an illusionary financial scam that simply will end up dragging our economy down into the greater rabbit hole of international carbon trading regimes, and other ill-fated technocratic economic regimes.

Why? Because Carbon monetization is an attempt to monetize our economic waste, and place the burden directly on the people, and not the corporations who, or which, have directed the use of carbon energy for the last several decades, and have actually hindered progress towards other novel energy designs. That said, the burden will always come down on regular people.

More than likely Carbon monetization will lead to the increase in carbon taxes, and the creation of carbon markets where financial instruments will be created and traded that will create an even bigger illusion. That is we cannot fix the costs of our civilization by quantifying every aspects of our lives, the only notion being served by carbon monetization is the false belief that it is for the 'collective good'.

The monetization of carbon can make no promises as a step towards solving global environmental issues, i.e. the use of fossil fuel use in China. The monetization of Carbon in Canada will only add another stranglehold to the prosperity of the middle class, as the creeping regressive nature of pricing carbon makes things simply more expensive, i.e. your travel to work, your daily need for food, all will be more. And do not pull that 'revenue neutral' crap, who taxes- then gives it all back, what social value does that serve?

While it may bring a certain level of satisfaction to some, that 'someone is doing something about the environment', there is no rational argument that can be made that says monetizing Carbon will actually fix our environment, or lead to alternative energy production.

146,"Good for Britain to see the EU for what it was, a slow trend towards socialism, rampant lobby cronyism, and what would essentially lean towards a federal Europe- sans any state rights. 

Maintaining, what is essentially state rights on a European stage, is essential at declaring sovereignty of political decision making, and in essence economic decision making is best felt at the grass roots, and in the protection of certain domestic markets. the most important value to be obtained in micro political action, as opposed to macro-collective action, is in essence found in the relative cultural and social position of the people of Britain, and its economic sovereignty. 

Economic sovereignty, however, can and needs to be reinvented in order to not only support industry of all calibers, but also support the people who work in them. 

With the dissolution of the EU governance model, Britain, and the British people, should theoretically, be able to not only govern themselves, but also enact economic measures that protect their industries and stuff akin. The reason, so that they prosper at the bequest of the people of Britain, not eg., offshore wealth accounts. 

Well the ideal outcome is not necessarily what happens, the hope is that Britain, and many other countries can begin to re-arrange their economic structures so that they more balance social wants and individual needs in accordance to the actual wealth and collective prosperity of a state, nation, commonwealth, union, etc.. 

IS THE CONCEPT OF UNION forgotten? Has the past not shown that unions tend to be undemocratic, and completely bureaucratic, so that it is foreign and omnipotent to everyone, except those that know the system. Has there not been several historical and contemporary structures where governance structure only reflect certain elite and structural institutions? TLDR... sorry. 

The elite movement and action of EU membership is a corollary effect of unions in general. Moreover, while the restriction of trade may have negative economic effects on England. Europe, et al., is not going to cut off English goods. And if England is a real financial center, like it has been, nations are not going to stop trading with them.

In the case of withdrawing some or all the European commonalities in a market structure,i.e. consumer goods, auto, etc; new markets can be created in England, and hopefully new manufacturing can begin to replace corporate off-shoring and the ill-fated attempt at creating grand 'economy of scales'.

While globalized trade seems like an inevitability, what most people may not realize, is that globalization, in terms of large corporate and financial entities dominating the macro and micro markets, for mainly everyone involved, is creating huge deficiencies in the actual self-management of ones own economic and social well-being.

+Technically, not necessarily legally, but in the future England does not have to deal directly with the EU if it wants to conduct its own trade missions with European nations, or attempt to redraw certain economic rules &amp; boundaries.",2016-06-24 23:52:10+00:00,d4mxr34,1.0,t3_4pp9k1,9399.0,The_Donald

161,"No one wants to mention the real numbers when it comes to understanding the economy and how this number reflects a greater economic disadvantage at play. 

In fact most politicians are presented with a fake-facade of empirical persuasion,  in terms of getting to know the real economic situation in Canada. Not to mention, most politicians never want to come to terms with the social and cultural impacts that certain historical, social and cultural economic policies always have, and how they eventually come to an end. 

That said, what is the real Canadian economy? Look around you and notice that Globalized trade harmony is an oxymoron. The homogeneity of global corporate macro economies are reflective of the juggernaut of dis-ease. The corporate state is a poor replacement for humanity and genuine freedom.Any  management style that reflects hegemony is fraught with its own ironic contradiction. Why? 

Obviously, my misplaced youth has landed me here. It pains me to have to ask you to interject a bracket into your daily horizon of thinking, but facts beat facts. The Canadian economy sucks right now, especially for pretty much a majority of the populace,  you know who you are. Primary industries decline, manufacturing decline &amp; Mcdonalds, Safeway automation- even those corporate logos deny themselves.

But why, political decisions in the past, major power and capital controls in ne'er do well metropolitan centers today, and because the nature of the beast is all around you; the strip malls, big box stores, monday through Friday, basic cultural and social practices are on the decline. While some agency is good, there is a general decline in culture that is reflective of boring economic practice. 

In sum, while our education system in Canada is good, it is overall merely reflective of global practices of intellectual standardization, ideology, and belief. While it remains pragmatic in the sense that we don't breed monsters, for the most part, the system itself can't cope. Thus more young people live with their parents, most young people are underemployed, and all other social ills tend to reflect several of these type of economic values. The most scary indicated value being that while our economy is reflective of larger social control to stymie our social creativity or in-large it by forcing us to live at home. This number may be at a all new high and the pragmatic necessities of life and human nature are being forgotten.

In essence feminism's very foundation, its modal point of conceptual growth and being, is mired in a cloud of its own injustice and celebrations of its own ignorance. 

 The definition of feminism is basically misandric at its core. The problem of feminism is that its collective intellectual narritive is wrong in its many assumptions regarding the totality of gender relations, patriarchy, and a host of other social variables in society, culture,history, etc, the balance and rhythms of life. Basically, feminism is based mainly in a biased theoretical realm of  something entirely socially and culturally fabricated; ergo, biology, chemistry, psychology, and other isms, are ignored in favored of the patriarchal lense and its own misandry. 

Feminist mainly argue with the logic of cultural relativism, critical theory, and other philosophies like, social constructionism, phenomenology, etc- While these philosophies can attempt to understand an individual in terms of their lived experience, eg. personal experiences with or without sexism, is entirely subjective. That is feminists are basically making social and collective statements on culture based on their own intellectual meaning making; they construct concepts based on a dismissal of half inherent biological features, among others. {I figure that this is a much more complex argument that I am failing to make, its elusive but there.}

By claiming male superiority, feminists ignore male sacrifice, and male social problems, masking or distorting them as a function of patriarchy- an easily misapplied label. Basically, feminism picks the wrong enemy. ",2016-05-20 01:09:25+00:00,d3cde3b,1.0,t3_4k32l0,33928.0,MensRights

This is the quintessential debate that all of us will need to explore in context to how we are governed and the type of economy and society that we will have in the future. The issue of globalism versus nationalism.

My bias rests in the fact that I beleive it is impossible to build good and healthy societies based on collectivist, globalist, principles attached to abstract globalist values, which for the most part as the article points out, have really only benefited the elite, or are at least propelled by them, in a questionable and varied way.

For a long time now we (all nations to some and all degrees) have been propelled down the rabbit hole of globalization.The mass public does not seem too concerned with the issues of global governance and trans national corporations, international trade deals, or anything else along those lines, but they should be.. Why, because everyday people are quickly losing their power to affect change in their lives; as the change agents of elite globalists are quickly usurping local and regional policy.

Have you not noticed the power of trans national corporations to basically control your lives? They dictate policy to elected government, control huge resources in a hegemonic global marketplace that disrupts everyone, when its needed to control them towards some elitist goal. At the same time corporate mass media and public education reaffirms this power principle. There is so much to add here, so many examples of globalization reach infecting the very core of normal everyday people and disrupting their lives slowly and immeasurably.

I am sure the economists, and all the other busy body policy makers realized the supreme advantage, of say, manufacturing stuff in China, or creating a advantageous trade policy; but they have a much more difficult time understanding the [UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF GLOBALISM]- here the principle of whats moral and ethical seems to be thrown out the window for whats profitable and rational.

I can only think that what is best for a people, who are drawn together by the simplest and most basic relations, culture and society, etc, is that national sovereignty, states rights, decentralized federalism, and a heterogeneous collection of state, nation state, and society, is the only true way for people to find true freedom, liberty, and a genuine pursuit of happiness.

But don't let the notion of war and chaos throw you off here, because that is what the globalists say. But you will clearly note that the only ones pushing the globalist agenda, have also, for the most part, been the most violent.

Of course nationalism is only a cultural or collective reaction to the problems that have incurred in the wake of almost twenty years of pure unparalleled 'elitist' globalism, i.e after cold war. Wake up, and realize that the bureaucratic and technocratic decisions being made for you are not in everyday 99% of peoples best interest.

People go nuts when Trump is brought up, or Chic Fil a..  There are anti-semitics on the left and the right. The problem is legal, moral, and ethical. 

It should not be considered politically incorrect, be considered hate speech, or illegal, especially in a democratic nation-state, to criticize Israel or the politics of zionism. Israel, and Palestinian history exist, side by side,and have real world impacts. Historical revision aside. Israel is a strange country, with questionable human rights policies, which many people don't accept. I would criticize Israel, as much as I would criticize my own country, and others. I would also criticize Palestine, but that doesn't really exist. 

I would not be apologetic if I made the comments that the UK mp made. I would instead be resentful that my words or thought are de-legitimized and replaced with words like 'hate' or 'racist'.

The problem is that Israel is not the center of the world, but then everyone claims it is when you start discussing the topic in Israel. But the goyim have always been predictable.  There aren't many people who hate Jews nowadays, more people seem to hate white people, muslims, gay people, and fat women, in that order. The problem is an elite-actor oriented.

Even the MP Livingstone was right about Hitler back in 33, (who in discussion with world Zionist leaders thought about repatriating Jews back to Madagascar, Livingstone said Israel but is mistaken); now how can Livingstone be called a racist for stating historical facts.

 I guess perspective comes from where you stand.  I honestly don't give a rats ass about Israel or Palestine, or any other country in the Middle East,  too bad no one gets along it could be a nice place.

267,"It is difficult to find peace, when you are ex-communicated from the culture of those around you. And this is exactly the type of culture we are breeding in Canada, it is ironic that both Trudeau's have elucidated very utopian projects, namely, multi-culturalism, and then a 'new wave of feminism'. Politicians realize that they are handicapped by the very fact there are few things which culturally bind any of us, except peace and good governance, maybe hockey. Everything else is filler. So actual common prosperity, peace, and order, for the individual living in Canada has to struggle against several increasingly hardened realities of daily life, and dis-location. 

I would have to argue that  that cultures with a significant differences, language eg; or individual ethos versus a collectivist ethos tend to end up in conflict and drag everyone down to the lowest denominator; eg. metacanada bitches-I feel as if this is appropriate for this subreddit culture. However, this doesn't signify one cultures primacy over another, it simply reflects that multi-culturalism and its pre,post,decessors of identity politics, feminism, racism, etc, ahem, 'because its 2016', simply create exclusion- the very thing they claim to be fighting against. Ergo the irony, and the 'war is peace, freedom is slavery', thing.

And then we arrive at the crux of the problem, when the quality of your life experience can only be found in the minutiae of your daily life, and not in the illusionary hypocrisy of the culture around you, i.e. everyone loses .

270,"Trump has probably made one of the best-pragmatic foreign policy speeches I have heard from American political leader in quite some time, next to Ron Paul of course. 

I understand the Brexit issue from the same principle from which I view other extra, supra-sovereign organizational entities governing my way of life and being. 

For far too long a continuing global trend towards international governing regimes has been made by various state, corporate, financial and elite actors. In the madness of rationalism, greed, power, and even good intentions, their goal is to create a supra-sovereign legal and governing regimes that (ironically) trump  local and regional peoples ability to govern themselves. Thus Trump and others realize that brexit, even things like WTO or Nafta, tend to trend towards the self-destruction of regional power and economic bases. say hello to trans-national corporations.  

Large and complex global trade regimes, political bodies, regulatory agencies, etc, while at some level are needed, in order to organize somewhat effectively, can also be burdensome to human well being. In order to create social and economic harmony nations must have the ability to make their own decisions and agreements, but also break them as well, moral leadership is hard. But still governments and the people that run them must always be held accountable to the public. Regimes like the EU, NAFTA,  tend to be run by technocrats, far removed from the people, and thus far removed from real accountability. And hence good ethics and organizational morals are easily subverted by various self-interests. 

that's my take, i guess. ",2016-04-30 20:42:19+00:00,d2nox67,1.0,t3_4h5cc8,11482.0,NorthAmerican

Good point about having a choice, but for the most part, as far as the law physics are concerned, people need to consume, people need food, and they need to drive their families places, and things need to get done, for which only one element is needed- energy, infrastructure, means, and ability. 

 So I am going to pay tax, either way, consumption or income. I resent my choices being engineered in a sense through tax, and then offering no alternatives expect false illusions of""Climate change accords"", and basically lying when they think a carbon tax is going to solve the ""global warming"" or the ""climate change"", issue. Carbon pricing, tax, markets,etc., will have little to no effect in terms of solving the 'environment problem'; this is a much larger social, cultural, structural challenge. 

Canada is so diverse an economy and geography that a certain amount of carbon consumption is always going to be needed in till the market offers better alternatives. Better alternatives do not correlate with consumption taxes, and are mostly more expensive, another paradox. In fact increased taxes will only really stifle most medium to poor income people in the general economy.There is an obvious international and regional push for the creation of a carbon market, but a carbon market won't translate necessarily into positive environmental impacts.

342,"Listen, I agree with you in some aspects. Entropy is a huge problem, but I believe in paradigm shifts in terms of energy and economic production, and the construction of economic methods that balance out overall consumption, and eg. consumption of hydrocarbons. 

I believe in sustainability, but I don't believe that climate change is as much a direct result of human action and our consumption of carbon; entirely the natural factors of the environment, and other celestial objects like the moon, and sun create processes that have effects on long term climate processes. We can't deny the actions of the recurrence of ice ages, winter is coming :). Thus our collective doom and gloom is probably for naught. 

The amount of productivity needed for humans can be regenerated , in terms of how Earth is a bevy of resources, and every year economic efficiencies seem to make room for elevated growth and consumption patterns, on a global scale it wavers significantly- while at the same time environmental impacts do seem to increase substantially. But historically speaking, if you look at socio-economic patterns in eg.Northeast America, you will note that the heavy pollutant industry has been on the decline, Detroit good example too. And now you have the recreation of local food coops and the re-agrarigation of the suburbs. So it really doesn't matter so much about capitalism, or carbon, economies change always in regards to total environmental conditions, they morph and they do not relate to what existed decades ago, thus capitalism is not real capitalism. We are in a midst of a enemy who masquerades as capitalism. 

  Carbon is not the entire factor, nor the most measurable one, in terms of accounting for full out climate change on the global scale. You may find exceptions regionally, where large carbon air emissions can stifle life, think Beijing. 

 However, there is the catch that you allude to, in that we have over consumed many of our resources, fish habitat, animal and natural vegetation, etc. This we can only regulate to so much a degree, and the rest of our consumption patterns will be probably managed better only through the development of new economic patterns, as to what Klein alluded to. 

There is a evil dynamic in place when you think about it, people slaving away in sweatshops, hours on end, freedom a miserable walk to their shanty hut. Then on the flip side Walmart. In both instances peoples economic and cultural values are guilty of the burden of climate change or whatever you want to call the human impact on the environment.

Look at the state run economy of China and the utter disaster that befell their environment. That's just one example, but we are talking economic models here. 

Kleins is a very basic socio-economic argument that denies us the fact that climate change is a natural and unstoppable force. The paradox is that the climate is always going to be changing. Whatever impact humans have are ability to change the climate for better or worse is somewhat negligible. Most of us will probably only find technological solutions to solve are problems;some will be forced to adapt and change due to the economic impacts of more negative/less productive environment; and even fewer of us will find solace in just being human, and living happily and well, in till the inevitable. 

 I think the problem she is trying to get at is that the nature of human beings, in their quest for consumption, security, and safety, all exhibit a pattern of western style corporate capitalism. We can't help it if we are all plugged into the grid exercising the economic engine, or wheel, beast, whichever you prefer.

380,"One of the main assumptive, foundational aspects, and value that feminism brings forth, is that it argues or assumes patriarchy, or male rule is the contemporary status of the actual effects of gender relations.  So feminism in actual name and direction of practice usurps all notions of gender construction for its own aim, that of a focus on the inequitability of female sex/gender (insert all other critical notions). 

The institutional notions of feminism in contemporary canadian society are quite obvious in the performance and equitability of gender in today's society, look at all the facts you want. because its 2016; however, an equal discourse on male perspective- say the vested interest in the other binary as the object of power and economic relations is quite disparate. (i don't expect you to understand that).

Feminism assumption of patriarchy logically assumes women's interests and women interests alone at defeating power inequities- thus feminism is a collective notion of power dynamics . The paradox is that it claims to be for everyone's interests, but the simple binary division remains. Feminisms call for gender equality is a paradox because it can't be rectified. 

My question, what is feminism? The answer is conditional to the idea that the notions of its righteousness is a moral hazard to some degree, and can be very short sighted. Feminism values need to be separated with masculinism values if it wants to talk about gender equality.

The feminists response to the ghomeshi verdict is telling, in that feminists will deny and pervert anything that does not fit their message, i.e. all men lie, all women tell the truth. Perhaps reality will start to kick in sometime in the near future.

‚ÄúThere is no core identity, no mainstream in Canada,‚Äô‚Äô Trudeau said... ‚ÄúThere are shared values ‚Äî openness, respect, compassion, willingness to work hard, to be there for each other, to search for equality and justice. Those qualities are what make us the first post-national state.‚Äù

The idea of post-national state is a troubling one because it aim is not invested in the soil nor the blood of Canada. Instead a post-national state divests Canadians from being Canadian; the idea of 'post national' replaces Canadian with something much more obtuse and undefinable. 

Even worse, by claiming to be post-national we become more susceptible to the machinations of globalization; a perfect example can be seen in the unfair and secret trade deal the TPP, where post-national economic organization is the main goal. Post-national identities will only lead to a loss of sovereignty and a moral breakdown in the social and cultural fabric of a peoples, as the richest and most popular ideas become the basis for identity. 

If you haven't noticed already Justin Trudeau is an ideologue, and his ideas are going to burden Canada for a generation, more people need to stand up against him, and challenge his opinions.

The reason that gender equality can never be achieved via the ideas of feminism, is that in the end feminism is a political force, a social movement, and an organizing set of beliefs and ideologies that assume we live in a patriarchal society, as if men have all the power. 

In the concept of feminism we find a much bigger social and cultural contradiction- subversive in scope, structural and institutional in range. Feminism is an ideology that has all but ignored its ""better half"", because in feminism the main problem is men via the assumption at the core of feminist thought is that patriarchy exists, while at the same time  feminist ignore their own power relations over men; and yes women do hold power over men in many areas, the construction of  gender equality discourse  and the illusion of its connection to feminism is a good example of this.


The merritts of feminist ideology is that it offers an exploratory analysis on women's lived experiences, but this does not make it an ideology that we need to put in practice for all Canadians, men and women, and everyone else. My point is that there can be no final logical accommodation between the two separate concepts of feminism and equality. Feminism by its nature is  divisive in that it constructs and plays off identity politics, labelling men as a problem, via the assumption of patriarchy. And while some feminisms aims are to achieve 'equality', It cannot ever achieve gender equality, as equality stands in stark contradiction to the definition of feminism itself, which basically says there was never equality in the first place.

425,"How does one describe political and social movements critically without being disrespectful? I don't even know if it is possible for an individual to comment on politics without the construction of a label or generalization, and maybe being disrespectful.

Politics is meant to be discussed liberally and with full and free exchange of meanings, symbolism, expression, and in some cases vitriol. Not to be disrespectful, but to construct a social and cultural realm that is more representative of their beliefs.
However, people have different beliefs and see things differently, politically, socially and culturally, as well- perhaps even biologically and psychologically- but this is a whole different discussion.

My opinion, which may be considered left or right, is that the restriction of free speech, or the use of censorship, through various means is not justice, is not fair, and is in complete contradiction to the charter of human rights. For example, Shadowbanning, human rights tribunals, and the overall collective nature of all the different groups of protesters and social movements to change speech patterns and construct cultural and social relative concepts offer us only friction and divisiveness. The more the left and right fight on this idea and on any public platform, but specifically the internet, is immoral and in contradiction to the functions and practices of a healthy and vibrant democracy.

More often than not, and seemingly showing an increasing trend, is the fact that certain ideologies namely the left are coming into full opposition with the right. Of course here I am only generally referring to the individual practice of ideology in the public sphere, be it on the internet or in a public or private venue- there are so many gray zones that it is hard to ever really gauge this realm/ sphere at all.

Being called a fascist, sjw, nazi, sexist, racist, etc. The use of identifying politics is in a sense low-brow, but no doubt these meanings carry significant weight in shaping public opinion. Obviously, it seems that in the action of shaping public opinion both political ideologies (in the general sense) would attempt to censor particular speech, and favour of another one, this is cultural relativism, and its dangers lay the efficacy and ethics of its method.

There is great concern for me here that my speech is restricted because someone thinks I am being disrespectful.
I am relating the fundamental human principle of being allowed to speak my mind, and to generalize ideas, concepts, ideologies, in a narritive that most people familiar to myself, and with full inter-subjective meaning know that I mean to be honest and speak my mind about political or social activities in Canada that I find offensive or that need to change- this is politics, it is always, but not always, disrespectful.

SJW, as you use it signifies the same identity construct of a group of individuals, like ""anti-fascists"", ""radical feminists"", etc- and this can be also used as a slur, or a positive association, depending on ones perspective.

We shouldn't breed political correctness to the point that one can't use SJW to describe what is essential a particular group identity, or the collective mindset and actions of people.

 The reduction of emissions is completely irrelevant in BC because its so miniscule, and unimportant in the global scheme of things. Stringent carbon policy and pricing regimes will not stop climate change. People should be wary of the idea of initiating carbon pricing schemes, and entering the false market of carbon trading. 

I think a better model to practice would be the Australian one, not BC. Australia has wisely tossed their carbon tax and pricing schemes out. Moreover, I am from BC and I have seen a rapid increase in the amount of vehicle traffic in my province, so I fail to see how this carbon tax has done anything. Emissions may have fallen, but this is technological. People buy gas based on the $ amount, not whether there is tax attached to it, tax only increases the $amount, with more impacts on the poor, less higher up the SES you go. 

It is unethical and amoral to tax consumers, you probably don't agree with this, but we already pay income taxes. Sure it may curb partial consumption of gas, but this is window dressing and a ineffective way at combating global climate change. There is no good end result in carbon pricing schemes, it just rakes off more money in ridiculous financial instruments for the banks in terms of playing the carbon market, as well as the government who is self-interested in constantly creating new revenue streams thinking that the more money the government has the better off this or that policy will be funded.

439,"It only hurts people of lower economic status, as a carbon tax increases the costs of their gasoline. But then some still need to use a car to travel, work and pleasure, so consumption happens. Carbon taxes aka consumption tax, has done nothing to help save the environment in BC, curb global warming, or stop climate change. It is just a revenue stream for the government, and its used for nothing.

 And while consumption may be a cause of our collective environmental damage, it is a necessary evil so that we can feed, clothe, and shelter ourselves. The tax may reduce consumption of gas, but then most reduction in carbon emissions can be reduced to BC's cut and paste of Californias clean air emissions policies, which mandated manufactures to reduce emissions. 

BC, and really the environmental policy in Canada, is in general really good. Now we have to worry about being to righteous in our actions, and commenting ourselves to totally ineffective carbon policy schemes. The danger to our environment is mass consumerism, not consumption.

Don't mind the chatter at the beginning of the video link, racism is a unjust acquisition in terms of identifying existential threats , instead see it as reflecting the mind of a part of the German nation at the time.  

 There is little doubt that the nature of WW2 was perhaps the most horrendous tragedy of the twentieth century. The collective conscience that drove Hitler and many Germans was entirely a misguided interpretation of the world around them at the time. There is so much hatred in this mans voice, but nonetheless, in what was probably a moment of lucidity he tried to take accord of his actions in this speech, your thoughts are your own. 

Barbarian at the door is a common misnomer. There are no doubt many collective crisis facing people in todays time. If one where to perform a kind of collective psychological analysis of the German peoples, and the actions of Hitler, I am sure what one would see this as an allegory of a twisted cross, reflecting a betrayal of Christian morals and ethics. Morris Berman book Re-enchantment of the World, briefly discusses this idea, and the  madness of the Third Reich.

While there is no doubt some truth to Hitlers last speech, the notion of him being entirely moral or just about his cause is trapped in the contradiction that his enemy was an illusion for the most part, but true in some respects. What is worse is that he recklessly flung soldiers, and sacrificed many nations, while he and his generals actively trapped Western and Eastern civilization in a madness that it brought on itself.

""It wasn't just about killing Hitler, it was about killing him, and engineering it so that it looked like an accident."" 

""So tell me,how did you design your plans?""

""Well it was easy, I went back to 42, and I watched Hitler from a distance on multiple occasions as a member of his orderly staff. Well I watched him for about a month during his frequent visits to the Wolf's Lair on the eastern front during the campaign against Russia. I was just looking for a moment where Hitler would lose his balance, just one moment, a slip up, trip, or a moment where he fell down.""

""But the key was that it needed to be timed, and all probabilities measured out. I recorded one slip up on December 7th, 1944 with my Iris camera, while Hitler was walking out of the Wolf's lair. I guess he was mad, and was raging after having been told by Field Marshal Manstein that the situation in Stalingrad was hopeless. Well anyways, there it was, Hitler trips over a camouflage canopy post, and almost falls down. 

""In World War Two-Reality Alpha Six, Hitler manages to catch his fall in this moment. So what did you do differently?

""This time in Reality Alpha Seven I went to the spot where Hitler slipped, and added ice to the equation of probabilities in the general area where Hitler would catch his fall. I used the ice as the catalyst, measured to the point that in Alpha Seven, Hitler would trip, but not catch his fall, and instead slip. I used a quantum probability generator, and I placed a series of rocks around the spots where Hitler had the best chance of falling and hitting his head. And the rest is history""

Why don't you go deeper, not my actual advice if you want to finish your paper, but look at how the government doesn't even need to censor speech anymore. For a large portion of culture, out of necessity, or out of fear of being excommunicated/excluded, we practice easy speech patterns and discourses, eg. we don't talk about religion or politics, we shun people who express different opinions &amp; don't try to understand them, I am sure there are a few more examples. 

Speech, in a way, the inter-subjective relations between people and action, has become something that is replicated from the emergent paradigms of our mass-consumerist culture, interspersed with hidden agendas supported by the state apparatus of education and economy (that is an argument you will have a hard time making because it basically criticizes the entire society, education, government, etc)

 But think about it; easy speech patterns include, did you watch the game? How is the weather?etc. Where other patterns of speech may be frowned upon, religious perspective or political ideologies. 

Governments censor stuff based on ideological and selfishness of the people in government at the time. But are propaganda system has been working for hundreds of years, non-stop, and we have infact self-censor. This bio-politic is based on several of the techniques developed from the government and the scientific modernization in our language .

If you want to go deep still into the project of censorship in the form of internet shadowbanning as a form of modern collective self-censorship.

 I will use the much disparaged Marx, who would argue, conceptualize your question, and frame it in reference to his idea of 'false consciousness'.

 Never before in history has this much wealth and power been obtained by so few.

517,"Dear Canadian Politicians, elected, and not,

The man who this ""news"" piece is talking about uses both satire and public relations to push an agenda. Many politicians in Canada have viewed his discourse as hate speech and misogyny. What you politicians have failed to realize is that Roosh is not promoting the legalization of rape on private property, nor is his group and ideology promoting hateful agendas or misogynic practices. It is simply trolling the linguistic and structural impediments to discussing men's issue and structural misandry.

This is a point I think a lot of Canadians are not understanding; but the man is using farce and satire in the things he is saying, and stretching the limits of free speech in directions that force reflection. This reflection causes us to challenge our collective, social and cultural conceptions of ideology regarding feminism specifically, political correctness, and cultural conceptions of masculinity.

If you do some research you will find that Roosh is really promoting an agenda of male values and principles of self-beingness via another collective mandate called neo-masculinity. 

The notion of being a Pick up Artist, while morally and ethically deplorable, serves as the ultimate contradiction to our societal values when it comes to knowing that our fundamental need is for sex, love, etc- his words are meant to reflect on that, and the gender, identity, and sexual politics, that are mixed up in all of our sexual agendas. 

 He has condemned violence against women in the past, but this fails to get mentioned, as most people fail to perceive any knowledge of the masculine, or masculinities.  His group has at least shattered the shield of contradiction that exists in our politicians hearts who have mindlessly believed the mob rule of feminism when it comes to gender relations; And in this concept of feminism we find a much bigger social and cultural contradiction- subversive in scope, structural and institutional in range. Feminism is an ideology that as all but ignored its ""better half"", because in feminism (a political force), the main problem is men via the ""assumption"" of patriarchy, while at the same time almost ignoring its power relations over men, matriarchy. So how can we say that Feminism as an ideology embraces everyone?

It is good at least that the debate is starting to pick up traction in this country, because for too long men have stood back and watched a violent narritive regarding the issue of gender relations and identity politics  in our country be manipulated by feminist ideology.

The mayors are right, Canada is not a place for hate and misogyny.

523,"Its easy to agree with a statement. However, it is more difficult to prove its validity. I still think that it is more logical and rational to assume; although feminism may offer solutions to men's problems, even suicide; that these solutions may not be the best. Furthermore, there is the conceptual notion that the mainstay of feminism, its foundational nature, is based on the structural, institutional, and familial assumptions, of patriarchy, ie the rule of men. This is the argument, and facts to prove and disprove this are true.

Now if the issue of gender equality comes into play, there are more questions, and even more contradictions. Because, gender is not by nature equal. In fact they are opposite ends of the biological structures which interconnected build our society and culture. But this is an entire debate that no one really wants to get into, I mean fully know the subject that they are talking about. The ability to wage violence is perhaps the greatest gift and the greatest curse god granted men. 

One example of a problem, as far as I can see is the nature of our economic institutions, and our collective fallacies regarding the nature of work, and distributions of income. While our collective structures may grant a certain group of men more privilege in the boardroom for example; overall in the grander scheme of all our production- the economic conditions show that more men are unemployed than women, at least here is one problem I see with the logic of feminism. There are a lot of other social and economic indicators that prove that men are at a greater material disadvantage than women.

However, no one has ever fretted over this, no man really dare speak the truth, that he would happily lay his life on the line for his wife, daughter, or son. Men are the first to be collectively sacrificed to death, this offers us not social or cultural rewards, for the most part. I don't want to whine, but I am sure someone will point that out. 

There is an inherent contradiction in the nature of feminism solving mens problems, because for feminism to exist men are the problem in the first place. Is it 10 seconds later? 

Now, it is very difficult to argue the validity of patriarchy and matriarchy, but both power and privilege is exalted in its practice and is dismissed from both dichotomies of thinking, and sometimes incorporated, we can include all other outliers, distributed among a normal distribution of society and culture. 

I think identity politics and gender relations need a whole new rethink. I reject feminism because it is impossible for its thinking to reconcile the other, especially in a Canadian example, and if the other is the problem to begin with.

524,"The author writes, ""In its rejection of patriarchal notions of masculinity, feminist theory offers solutions to issues genuinely affecting men, such as high rates of suicide and the stigmatization of mental health issues."" 

Feminism of course does not offer solutions to 'issues genuinely affecting men'; it instead muddles these issues up based on a flawed and contradictory perception of reality in the West specifically.

 Feminism is a political ideology, whose primary assumption is that we live in a patriarchal society- everything else moves from this assumption. Of course challenging this assumption one will find themselves having to challenge other people's own flawed logic, or misconceptions regarding their reality.

Donald Rumsfeld has perhaps outsmarted himself with this interview with Colbert. Colbert plays the trickster, the court jester making fun of the king and his court. 

Colbert takes Rumsfeld to task on the Iraq war, in terms of criticizing R. elaborate quote on the 'unknown knowns, known unknowns, etc.' 
 But Colbert notes there is an additional epistemological construction, a 4th epistemological agent, the 'unknowns knowns ,' referencing the fact that a recent pentagon report noted that 90% of the intelligence on Iraq and WMD was unreliable. 

Rumsfeld's comments referring to the failure of intelligence is dismissive to say the least. I.E. Rumsfeld takes no responsibility in his own decision and activity to push for war with Iraq, and it sounds as if he is blaming Bush, but he is to blame to, are they all just going to point fingers at one another.  This is Rumsfeld's trademark narritive, a pedantic demeanour absence of responsibility.

Thus we have sacrificed the backbone of our economy for what... A bigger service and financial sector?

563,"That is a great question. You have partly answered it yourself, commenting on the fact that the last few decades have seen a tumultuous upward trend in male unemployment. Why is this so? Moreover, what are the social-cultural consequences to this trend? 

 There are so many finer economic points one could use to express why this is so, but you don't want a journal piece. Alberta exemplifies the massive social and cultural expression in regards to the significance men, on average, place on employment; namely the expression of values of social status, family support (life insurance), etc. Men may also perceive death significantly different from women, i.e. higher suicide rates.  

Men and women place different values in their action, lived experience, and praxis, are all expressed both individually and socially. Difference can be obviously noted and expressed in the subtleties of culture. Socially, there is different path men take, and how they are viewed. Thus employment, and the expression of social status attached to it, become a very important social issue to deal with. Specifically with the current economic climate, mens jobs in Canada will be the first to go. And I would argue that society finds it easier to accept men living on the streets, than they would a women or child- and this is the right way to look at it, I am not arguing against that to be clear. 

I don't know however, if you can say that most men have been 'perfectly unconcerned with that'; I could contend using a principle of false consciousness- but then I would be straw manning an argument. I would actually say that a minority of men are affected by this fact. Marriage could be a good parable of male and female relations; whereas, this fact remains problematic-I don't want to get into that, though.

Feminism paints a picture of patriarchy and is supposedly a voice for gender equality- both these points are not logical argued, have no basis in reality, and not true. .
Trudeau's cabinet will be fine, but it does send the wrong message when it comes to the reality of gender relations, and the false idea that feminism lends itself to gender equality.

This is a debate about which sex has privilege in this world and which sex doesn't- and to be honest I would say no sex has ultimate privilege. Except that feminism has managed to parlay itself into common cultural thinking- this is the problem for me. Why?

My problem with feminism is that to be taken as ideology then one must believe in the concept that contemporary society is patriarchal, well this is not true. Our society is elitist, for sure, but this does not equate in any ways to patriarchy- a rule of men, but more like some form of plutocracy. Feminism simply pollutes the water of identity politics, makes things out more than they should be.

And no, just because men suffer worse, this is not because of women- although feminism tends to think all women suffer at the hands of men. Contemporary problems of the masculine could be because of several factors, biology, economy, society, culture, etc. Power is cyclical overt and subvert.  Fact is, men overall seem to have a much tougher time in contemporary society than women in most social and cultural indicators, yet as a society and culture we consistently neglect male issues. It will always be women and children first, and I will never allow it to be otherwise. Of course no one likes being told how it is.

622,"Factually, I see over and over a cultural appetite that has soaked up feminist ideology, parading Canada, and other Western nations as somehow less equal in gender relations. And this is not the case. Sure sexism exists, but it is not institutionalized, however, it does become systemic when you have an ideology that weaves a gender narritive that is inherently untrue, or clashes with many people's lived experiences when it comes to identity politics.This is where feminism breeds inequality. 

 That if you want to take note of systemic institutional, social and cultural inequalities you could probably argue much clearer that men have it worse off than women in many areas,unemployment, suicide,etc. But because feminism is founded on the principle of patriarchy it has divided up the genders by painting a picture that is female-centric, not person-centric; worse they claim the throne of being not equal in someway. Add to that it is feminism that has infiltrated education and political correctness, and not in a good way, but with a somewhat ideologically oppressive tone. Moreover, bureaucracy, HR, etc, tend to base policy off the false assumptions that gender relations are unequal.  

Facts add up with more facts, eg- Look at how the Federal liberal cabinet was constructed, based initially on a gender quota, despite their being more men elected to parliament. 

- My argument is that on a global level charities need to be careful in presenting a local population with a new idea, especially feminism. I wouldn't see BIAG operating in the Middle East, or even in some African countries, this doesn't mean women are not treated differently in these countries, and they are probably worse off than women in developed nations.

625,"The problem with SJ, where Men's rights are concerned, is based on the fact that SJ is heavily influenced by feminist ideology, or female rights, which places men rights on the bottom of SJ issues.(Note: this is not The problem, but a problem). I am sure if the two were incorporated equally a better discourse on both subjects would be observed, and you wouldn‚Äôt have people running around talking about safe spaces, trigger words, privilege, etc. That said this is more of a rant on quasi-capabilities of SJ, and the problem it has due to a lack of masculine perspective when it comes to finding social justice.

First of all SJ is a word but like many words in the English language, it doesn‚Äôt mean what it says. Example, it is neither social, nor is it justice. In terms of a better word we could call it social punishment and cultural reconstruction.  But in the social sciences social justice can be defined as empirical praxis, a path towards social change. However, the type of change SJ asks of society emerges from an ideological struggle, a narrative that is by no means complete, i.e. it doesn‚Äôt take into consideration all-perspectives and avenues of social construction, ergo my problem, it is not just at all. 

SJ is a project that has many guises, and its development is a long term project for many individuals. If anything SJ is just another part of the inter-connected political and social project we take part in everyday.  For the most part SJ is taught in-juxt with critical thinking skills; however, for the most part students do no develop their later half‚Äôs. Instead, we find a student mimicking a teacher's bias, with historicity, facts, and figures, contradicting their own reality-their own lived experiences. 

A contradiction is found in the lived experience being  uni-linear appearance, but reality is basically multi-linear and relative to one‚Äôs own language ability and experience in relation to the other, we cannot ever fully incorporate another ones lived experience. (I think I confused myself). 

By far the most alluring aspect of SJ is the call it puts forth for change. However, for the most part the change SJW call for is ridiculously narcissistic and steeped in myopic narrative. Men‚Äôs rights activists will have a hard time penetrating the linguistic walls, you will be met with SJW and their verbal arrows, but don‚Äôt fret; everything out of balance eventually reforms itself.

Dispensaries are nothing like Corporate Starbucks. First, they don't cover every square block of the greater Vancouver, and I am almost not joking. They don't operate in every strip mall, off every highways. You won't find a dispensary in the mall, but you will find plenty of Starbucks. I get queasy when I go to Starbucks because it's so fake, that it has no culture, it is a cookie cutter illusion of what a real coffee shop is supposed to be like, it is the worst part of culture and society. And their coffee is shit. Moreover, every time I go in one I always order a large just to fuck with them. And breathe!!

Fair enough not every dispensary was a cultural icon, but at least it was independent, and they were free from the corporate chain, for at least a little while. And I have entered many of them, and each were different, unique, and had a different vibe. At least for a little while some Vancouverites got to see what real freedom is about.

The proposed business regulations are a bit Byzantine, and just as corrupt in red tape and unfair fees, as what existed before in the black market and shady dealings. The marijuana market that opened up in Vancouver, was for a brief time liberating and prosperous.

But once again, as in over and over, the government will tend to profit greater from their own arrangements, based on the misperceived ilk of social health concerns, etc. They run all the rackets, from liquor to gambling, some regulation but not all.

Moreover, there is an alarmist tendency to view these dispensaries as un-regulated, when in fact each establishment has met its own viability of self-regulations and business-tax relationships. And the city has already established excessive business fees. 

Whether or not marijuana is illegal federaly, by common practice, no longer does the VPD, or RCMP, have the legal mandate to enforce marijuana laws. Thus to create more legal mandates seems regressive; no fun city indeed. 

I am afraid that some people will view this from a social health perspective, in terms of aggregate costs. Do not fall for this trap... I would rant more,,,, but I'm high. 

In conclusion, the Vancouver business environment is in fact ruining several already established storefronts, each an established cultural center. But because of the city regulations people are unemployed, or will be because of these closures.

 They should have just left the market alone, and allow entrepreneurial growth, along with a more mild temperament to already existing storefronts.

Canadians need to be more reflexive on their approach towards environmental regulations, federal, and global. We can't be homogeneous, same across the board, with other nations; moreover, we are one of the cleanest countries, with much different economic/environmental realities than say India or China, the least of our concern is CO2 emissions, our actual concern is the preservation of natural geologies, fauna, and flora, and all that real jazz that is located in our country and inter-connected with the rest of the planet.

Mental health prognosis  is problematic in the fact that rarely are two mental health ""experts"" going to agree in full, with the exception of the self-preservation of their discipline. Whereas, we have the a large and bureaucratic institutional approach to mental health being developed in its infancy; that if continued along Obama's approach will cause more problems in the future in terms of trying to apply mental health problems in association with an individual's perceived threat to ""society"". 

Moreover, all these fields lack any basic biological or chemical markers in terms of actually identifying a psychological trait in an individual; i.e. all prognosis are made in relation to the Diagnostic Statistical Manual, and only a bevy of symptoms that the mental health practitioners can identify with their own experience will be used in the creation of prognosis. How then does one individual be deemed a threat to use a gun in a violent fashion? You cannot measure these things accurately and to try you will find only the self-fulfilling prohpecy or bias being played out, and not actual scientific fact.

I would argue that it is impossible as this 'spa' is advertising, to 'create a stress free environment'. While I think it is very possible to de-medicalize it, you will never be able to 'get rid' of the emotion and stress,  when performing what is essentially a medical operation.

And the worse thing to do is to trivialize everything that has happened before, i.e. being pregnant, etc., and believe that the trauma or feelings good and bad associated with it can just be summarily dismissed in a trip to a spa.

These soldiers and a majority of officers and experts, in all departments, knew nothing about what they were getting themselves into. Thus the cultural and social programing of Bergndahl broke down, along side the shitty conditions he, and his company, were living in at the time. IED, no languange, no cultural or women, no alcohol (which was eventually scrapped), etc. The cultural framework of occupation ultimately corrupts the social fabric of the minority forces, acting in superior ways. 

Perhaps, at the deep subconscious strata of Bergendahl he never fully committed to the military training regimen of the American forces, nor did he beleive the pre-cultural conditioning that stratified most front line soldiers &amp; officers rational for condcut of miltiary operations- which in retrospect seem even today, ridiculous and hollow. Despite the sacrifices made by some and all, not much was accomplished in the long run, except more strife and hatred. 

 In some sense Bergandahl was brave, but stupid,he was seemingly scared enough for his own life, that he would do anything to save it. In this case attempting to go DUST for 2 days; however, in a time of war this is very regrettable to the entire authoritative and discipline structure of the Army fighting forces. However, he never left in a fire-fight, and this is important in terms of assessing the effectiveness of a fighting force, and thus responses towards the rescue efforts for  Bergandahl.

He knew this and didn't necessarily forget it, yet in a sense his tragedy was real, 5 years in Taliban captivity- Is he a Manchurian Candidate ?? LOL/cringe

He gives good intel on his captivity, and other than leaving his post, he seemed committed to a personal code of conduct according to SEER training guidelines when held in captavity, he escaped a couple times. 

However, the sacrifice a lot of soldiers in the entire campaign theater was probably a ridiculous contradiction to Bergendahl Dustoff, since most intelligent intelligence offices would know he was in Pakistan, and thus a taxing search on Bergdahl was redundant, over a period of time, but the search was necessary for troop morale- even though it lowered it. He was in Pakistan, where Osama was. 

So the question of leadership is exactly what Bergndahl aced. Because the actual activities that were occurring in this region even beforeBergendahll DUST'ed off were a contradiction in some sense- very little humanitarian aide, just lots of humvees and M16s- No one wants McDonalds any more.

In terms of shaping and identifying the contemporary American foreign dynamic on the actual world stage intellectual analysis can presents itself as biased in its own vested interest, or military-industrial epistemological framework.

For example, the authors frame Russia as a totality of its negative frameworks: lack of civility in social and cultural institutions, aggressive military prowess in consequence with regional conflicts, Russia's independence streak in conflict to what seems like naturall progressive US-EU led globalization efforts, and they are critical of Russia's foreign diplomacy, which offers itself as a counter-echo in balance to American foreign policy.

It is too bad both sides seem myopic in their understanding of global affairs, and the actual social and cultural global impacts that both these countries are facilitating through their own actor, and narrative, campaigns. 

I am afraid the American foreign policy analysis fails to criticize its own state apparatus, before it can comment on the actions of another, which in many circumstances, is simply a counter-elite narrative establishing itself in protection of their own interests, a paradox which are often overlooked.

Plants grow in the sun, why should these be subject to some restriction, or even worse some bounty. Legalize lift the restriction and allow one to grow marijuana like one would grow tomatoes, and if one makes money off of it, all the better.

 Tax marijuana sales like you tax any other normally sold consumer good. What I fear the government has the potential to do is basically squander free will and liberty by opening up its own weed dealerships. Essentially they have the ability to form their own cartel, by whatever name.
   
For thousands of years people would just smoke weed and no one think anything of it. Then some people got together and decided to make it illegal. Then people decided that it was stupid for us to make this illegal, because everyone, for the most part, smokes weed.

Taxes, or some aspect of money collection, are inevitably a aspect of our civilization, but the current revenue or redistribution streams are inevitably hierarchical and very unjust, economically, socially, culturally, biologically, and psychologically. I argue we need to rethink our governance structures in terms of what they can demand from us, as already it is too much. 

Structurally, the warrant of justification in terms of explicating the reasons why our tax system is unfair, is the trend of increases in various taxes in all categories. When thinking about the technological and qualitative advantages of our society, we need to adjust the account, because it takes 1 person today, to do the job of 100, only like 50 years ago. There is a large structural change that is inevitably going to take place, an increase in taxes, along with an increase in the standard of living, is unsustainable. 

Furthermore, there is this collective banality when it comes to comprehending, or visualizing, societies, and other ideologies, where tax is not a necessity in almost every consumer purchase you make, and dollar earned in your own labour. Moreover, we seem to be okay with rising prices, and content with economic structures, which are failing. We probably could take into consideration several alternative possibilities in terms of new revenue streams that do not require income tax or consumer taxes. 

Also imagine if our crown corporations could govern more efficiently, etc, there are so many different alternative to revenue or tax collection, however, it is all inherently redundant if we do no reform our entire economic  culture and financial systems. Eg. positive banking versus negative debt based banking....

In the past 50 years our collective productivity thanks to technologies of knowledge and power we have managed to create an ability to utilize one individual in the place of several. Why then, if we have managed to become such a highly industrialized and technical country are the actual living wages decreasing, and taxes going up?  

 I was born in this land and this is my home, I don't need to move in order to express my point of view, nor complete my logic that the way we are taxed is inherently immoral when all things, economic and social, are considered. I did not have a choice when I was young to live in a truly free land versus living in a land of tax and servitude. 

Moreover, just because someone argues that tax is an immoral equation doesn't mean they have to leave the country and go somewhere else, which will probably also have a form of tax. The worst thing is that more people are socialized into accepting our system of usury and tax- most people aren't even consciousness of how badly we are getting screwed. The system we live in is inherently violent, and oppressive in two ways, ergo, not only  does the state 'coercively' collect taxes, it also promotes the idea that this is a good thing. When in reality taxes are rarely used efficiently, nor does our economic model rarely effect an equality of 're' distribution.

In the case of marijuana legalization. My argument is against the government hindering, or restricting, a free individual from particpating in this program without first buying into it.. For example, in Vancouver the city requires $30,000 up front for dispensaries to operate. For most people this is an insurmountable sum, thus leaving big bussiness, and 'friends' or patrons of government, too reap the large rewards off marijuana adventures..

Point is, it's a difficult journey in Canada to open up our collective horizon when it comes to differentiating between what is essentially the moral question of taxes. 

On one hand people are right to point out all the things that we receive from taxation- decent moral argument in its own sense.However, paying taxes is not a voluntary decision, we are forced to pay or face essentially a form of state violence and imprisonment- a good moral argument against.

Our collective political order wasn‚Äôt created centuries ago, it was created millennial ago, and we are all still trying to improve the ride, if I were cheeky. But let‚Äôs not be mistaken by the idealism of libertarianism versus whatever ideological challenger of pure realism, you would like to see its place.

 And who is this ‚Äòcult‚Äô group of dissidents, you sound like you are in the state of paranoia- A thought I would have if I was a dismissive creature and full of neglect towards your argument. You and I speak from different tongues, as if the tower of Babel is not really a metaphorical property of thought. One tongue is idealism the other you reality of folkloric conceptions of a false entropic environment.

Your tone, my interpretation open to bias, sounds as if you are trying to dismiss my optimism for the Libertarian philosophy, as essentially leading to aggressive war-like chaos. You suggest that human beings act primarily out of pure ignorance with this logic. History justifies the horror that people can afflict on one another, yes, but history as the opposite, e.g. her story as well, (not a feminist).

 I argue it is the state that first populates these myths of war and control, paranoia of independent men and women without the state- I mean they do publish our education books so I can understand where we would find an affinity for the state.
 Libertarians may focus and control their convictions, but I argue, they do this for the idealism and humanism of men and women, coupled by the faith- that left alone from the state he and she are bonded by natural gifts to create beauty instead of war; propagate and control themselves independently as opposed to annihilation or sacrifice to redundant control mechanisms. 

 Of course my idealism can confuse anyone, but I will never believe that the darkest recesses of actionable men are constructions of their own evil mind, or some misunderstanding that all action has consequence.

 I argue instead that we, as qualitative and quantitative humans, are conscripted into whatever service and methods that conscript and socialize us, &amp; for whatever reason Liberty, as a manifest of human destiny, always sounds sweeter as an ideal, despite whatever reality it is currently now- but contemporary reality will never match what could be the future without the addition of new constructs. 

The individual seems to be versus the hegemonic construction of collective idealism, and we are battling on ideologies of the, state, power and war, in the first place we are talking about Vancouver. But it is nice to be subversive, deconstructive, and idealistic. 

But you are right, it is impossible at our state of zeitgeist, spirit of the time, horizon of thinking, or phenomenological construct, to obtain any heights of human concourse towards liberty of mind, body, and spirit; instead, as you have argued, we would at least need to have one, some, or all, of these constrained by a state apparatus?

Libertarianism is not a new idea, but it has often been neglected in our epistemological upbringing-i.e. our collective learning curve. 
You and I have different views on how we view the nature  and outcome of the human being; whereas, you see chaos sans state, and I see peace without the encompassing hand of the government, and its needless and wasteful idealism- glad we have bureaucracy. I guess this argument can be very solipsistic, and it is really a question of how one perceives the need or restriction of individual rights versus collective ones. 

I contest that the concept of real-world factors is complicated by the fact that we live among a self-educated and social generating populace who are very capable of governing themselves at local levels; but as is shown already in the real world, certain wars exists, and people die all the time- for what, some banner, some boundary, why does anyone fight wars, but in most circumstances it is because of the state, it funds the war apparatus, of this or that country, rebel group, dictator, whatever. 

 Libertarianism doesn‚Äôt aim to neglect society completely, in all its levels; it just asks that any society that is structured in such and such way be done, so that it does not demand the active or sacrificing participation of the individual for the quasi-aims of the corporate or state apparatus. A protection of the somewhat sacrificial relationship already exists in society today, so I can see your point of view much clearer, when we assume all the negative outcomes all over the globe. 

Libertarian‚Äôs also do not like the state‚Äôs ability to consistently, and constantly surveyed, and taken measure of, citizens should be left very well alone, and without the express consent of a party being affected or effected, should the state or any other party, be allowed to pry in one‚Äôs personal affairs. 

The libertarian asks the state to remove the individual from being a constant victim to economic usury, i.e. fiat negative-controlled banking practices, or any other forms unjust, invasive, state procedures and methods geared at unjustly asking too much in return for what exactly? What is a social insurance card really for?

If there is one constant throughout history it is that law has and always be a custom, and these customs are always interchangeable, and some not so much. For example, there is always a payment to be made in a libertarian society, as in any society,but do we pay with money? or do we pay with currency? Are we a debt based society, or a positive income economy.

 Libertarians mainly form an upside down smile when they here the idea of state, in its coercion of people to act, behave, take medicine, think, Libertarians hate state violence, or violence in general, unjust laws, invasion of privacy, and they are not really open to any form of taxation if it is complex and/or, burdensome.

882,"That‚Äôs a great question, but impossible for one man to answer in any neat summary. I will try to give you a roundabout perspective of where some Libertarians may come from, and in that measure you might begin to see an answer to your question. 

Lord Acton once said 'Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely.' I think this is a pretty decent quote to understand the motto of a libertarian when it comes to viewing the relationship between power and the state-apparatus. 

Libertarians, as individuals, and as people, want to be masters of their own economic and social destiny, and not be tied into the plans of politicians from the 'high castle'. Where, corruption and power are abused, and there are more than a few mighty examples of this in history. 
Some individuals may argue that libertarians are selfish, or something along these lines. However, the promotion of individualism among the libertarian cause does not necessitate neglect the other, that‚Äôs a philosophical impossibility- as our social development is explicitly tied to the other. In fact in some avenues of thought, Libertarianism recognizes the other as equally important in terms of creating the optimal social conditions towards a liberated economy. 

The Libertarian, however, argues that in order to achieve said optimal social conditions the power of the state, and government, need to be restricted, as it is these forms of institutional organization that are the real barriers to true social justice, and the degradation of the social. 

That said a future where a libertarian society exists can only be envisaged when most Canadians begin to understand that all roads lead to Rome, or that all the interconnected roads of the power structure that 'rules over us‚Äô lead down the path of neither 'good governance' or 'freedom; but namely exist in the relationships between 'high finance', 'partners in globalization', 'Trans national corporations' etc.

901,"Let me preface my question based on how I view the environment. First, I hold a deep reverence in the positive and fruitful conditions of the environment. I have a background in many aspects of the environmental movement, intellectually, politically, legal and scientifically. However, by no means am I a hierophant of the environmental movement. 

The environment is being held in a state of reverence simply because it‚Äôs beautiful, and any loss to the environment, or removal of Earth‚Äôs natural state, is tragic, as the evidence has explicated in the past and up into this day. Of course this tragedy is endemic to human suffering, in that environmental degradation affects us in every possible way- but also to our benefit since everything around you was sacrificed for your pleasure and consumption. So far this seems to be very clear in the fundamental tenets of the environmental movement.

So that said let us take a look at the actual state of the environment. In terms of an economic necessity, i.e. it provides us with the basic security for life and independence. Thus we sacrifice the environment for our own needs, selfish and otherwise. 
I will acknowledge that there is an historic precedent of needless waste, excessive consumption, and a seemingly unending mechanization to our planet, this is where the eviro-movement has made its biggest impacts. That said here I interject to Vancouver.

The environment is not as bad as people say it is- especially in Vancouver. Specifically since manufacturing and primary industry has been on the decline. Moreover, Canada has some of the best environmental laws and enforcement in the world due to an informed and conscious public- despite significant environmental disasters- an unfortunate by-product of our ""civilization."" However, the cultural conception and ideology of environmentalism are becoming increasingly interconnected into a global framework or global modality, paradigm, etc., which I sense is an attempt to usurp the initially motive of the environmental movement. That the ideas, concepts, and science of climate change, global warming,  (hu)man-made global warming, etc, while based in reality, are often concepts overused/ misunderstood by an ""educated"" public. And worse, abused by some corporate and political elites.

That my biggest complaint emerging from the erosion of the environmental wave on the shores of our society, culture, and ideology; is that the ship which caused the wave, and originally captained by moral and ethical duty, is now being replaced by new captains, (of industry?); who practice what are in essence a part of there structural lineage the self-destructive practices of the past. 

I think Vancouver is a reticent example of this ‚Äúglobal action on climate change‚Äù; and not to the benefit of Vancouverites, but to the benefit of the ego- that notion of looking good on the world stage,  as we mindlessly adopt whatever treaties that come our way. Vancouver city hall seems to worry so much about adopting this and that environmental initiative, that I can only begin to think of all the important issues that are neglected in their environmental drive. What is worse is that they think they are doing great while other more important social initiatives get overlooked.  

Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love bike lanes, but I also like jobs in primary and secondary industries, the service sector is a bore.  Micro-unit, densification, urban gardens, etc, all these initiative are awesome in some way (and can also be criticized). But these initiatives are at risk of becoming corporatized and commercialized; thus these initiatives should always be locally led as much as possible or the environmental movement risks becoming the puppet of someone else. 

My biggest concern is with laws like the carbon tax, pacific carbon trust, etc. and the idea of creating a global market in carbon- this idea is ridiculous. And there are other examples of the autocracy that future international treaties will attempt to govern. But I argue that we cannot govern, (my philosophy) another nations ability or inability to conduct environmental awareness- I mean China is its own example. We can build walls or tariffs or whatever, or become more self-sufficient, but I ask that any form of international law not be so unanimously accepted, but criticized and adapted as practice only in concordance to the highest principles and not some form of social engineering or ideological romanticism.

Unfortunately, but for my intellectual benefit, I have come from a predominantly left-social justice, intellectual side academia where language use, syntax, and the proper use of grammar, were requisitioned by a large majority of feminists, and their ilk. So I know cunty behavior all too well, I just use different words and meanings to describe them. 

I think you are correct in all three of your assumptions. But if this was a battle of the minds, for which it is in a sense, you would still need to distinguish all the factors and variables of militancy and unhappiness in the sociological and psychological world which constructs these concepts. 

This includes also interpreting differences in the cultural, economy, ideology of feminism and its impact on structures and institutions, including politics, education, etc. Moreover, if you want to get really personal with the feminist literature, but more simply, feminist logic, identify the biological and psychological differences, then you are fucked btw. 

Either way, my biggest explanation as to 'why I am not a feminist' and to why feminism is a deconstructive social force, is because: Feminism, assumes the ultimate construction of a difference between men and women, difference in sex and gender: This notable difference is exceptional, but this does not mean feminism equals gender equality, nor does it bring equanimity to the subject. Moreover, feminism is an obvious political and social movement, with a well structured and diverse discourse and ideology,( here I argue structural power dynamics as considered from a feminists pov. to be in error in some ways). 

Hence, feminism political bias does not aim, because it philosophically cant, to create gender equality, and thus a better term for uncovering understanding regarding gender equality, is by combining feminism and masculinities into one study, in and of itself-namely-gender studies and not feminism.

 It is good to discuss how 'masculinity has affected their lives,'; but in this context they are going to compare and judge their peers not to critical thinking skills, but collectivist propaganda- I shortened the last bit to tell you how I really think. I think gender relations are pretty good in this country, but there are a large segment of the population being hindered by the constant ideological hegemonic struggle..

We seem to live in dangerous politically correct times, where speaking out of place or in opposition to entrenched cultural ideas can be an ‚Äùunpopular‚Äù move; (I originally commented on facebook-bad idea) moreover, there is a severe, and almost automatic attempt to shame or dismiss unpopular opinions even before the ideas become ripened in one‚Äôs mind- The opposite is critical thinking. Perhaps we can expand the dialogue attributed to some feminist thought into a more encompassing gender relations category, so as not to reiterate a one sided gender narrative conducive only to feminist ideology.

 I know my opinion is not popular, but sparking a little debate about the efficacy of feminism is a good thing- and I am happy to acknowledge some of the reasons ‚Äòwhy I am not a feminist‚Äô, in order to add substance to the milieu of the gender equality narrative. Moreover, if you have continued reading so far, and haven‚Äôt callously commented on the section below with errant rebuttals regarding the use of my word play and not the substance, then perhaps I will explain why feminism, in this case, is the antithesis to equal gender relations and in this context should be criticized as an educational tool. Of course here is where most people begin to conflate their lived experiences with whatever ‚Äúfacts‚Äù that they have learned to justify their own ideology and entrenched vested interest in this course of thought- of course I am not innocent in this department, but no one is. 

In a historical context, feminism has had a role to play in intellectual challenges to contemporary thought regarding the equality of gender relations- But it does not get to appropriate, as it seems to have done, the moral equanimity of gender relations all to itself- and if it does it becomes the very vehicle it has tried to stop. Moreover, feminism moves on the premise of a male oppression archetype, or ‚Äòinequality‚Äô threshold based on economic questions, etc. Regardless of whatever facts exists or don‚Äôt exist, this is perhaps my biggest criticism of feminism, in that it neglects and assumes half the equation; from which I argue feminists need to understand, that the lived experience of men, or masculinities does not correspond to most feminist portraits of Canadian society or economy- .

Cults play trickster and subvert with people‚Äôs heads- Apply tin foil or enter your faraday cage.  Everything is a cult-duh, especially the globalized-matrix which enshrines us- not subtle monarchy joke. 

But this theory does have merit because you added a psychological element to the equation.  And the theory is probably correct if it was sampled from Vancouver, but other places not so much- Plus the economic conditions of an area may point in the other direction, higher suicide rates, and loss of purpose are direct results of both economic decline and loss of religious community, or idendity, or whatever, you may see the paradox religion offers us.  Religion and even conspiratorial thinking (Which you are assuming too much as a negative delusion- there is an entire metaphysical realm man, too explore on top of the occult (hidden) knowledge that is all around you. Hope you were still in your cage. 

 In god or spiritualism, agnosticism, and the like, including cults, tend to rise in certain cultural motifs- too lazy to give eg. And too fearful really to explore, what in essence has existed for millennial, the dark arts or black magic, these things have existed for thousandsxx of years.

I am aware that the conflict has many angles, including the one you stated. (And I would add that the Turks are fighting the Kurds, who are fighting assad and ISIS, what? who is fighting whom?)However, with your logic regarding Turkish support of northern rebels, would you not then conclude then, that Russia and Turkey would be in a state of war with each other? Because, as far as I know, Russia is supporting Assad, and fighting on all fronts against rebel groups which are fighting against him in that country. 

I think the entire middle east is a mess. And I think that the incident was a much bigger provocation than a mere 20 seconds of violated airspace, also because it involved direct fighter action and death. Moreover, the Russian fighter jet was not attacking Turkey, or Turkish forces, nor were its jets heading towards the interior of Turkey, so the action seems more like a provocation than anything defensive. 

I think my grasp on the situation would conclude that a provocation in this region at this time giving all the men and material at war is a bad idea. ",2015-11-25 15:26:59+00:00,cxcmxrz,5.0,t1_cxcks4q,3975.0,geopolitics

A large mirror is needed in our society to balance out this form of dis-equilibrium between the sexes/genders. 

Although this case may have some merit, the mainstream media's focus on this type of problem is without a proper balance, i.e. it has some cultural bias attached to it and

There are so many other past examples of this obvious one-way street when it comes to sexual power in our society. Feminism is not the only perspective when it comes to understanding the sexual nature/sociology of our society. People need to not jump on this bandwagon without recognizing the increasing imbalance between what is,  sexual assault, being inappropriate, flirting, etc. There is a significant cultural gap between the sexes that i still needed to be understood and is leaving one sex behind-

930,"YOU WIN ! I have my children's best interest at heart, the state and centralized authorities certainly do not. The government and big business do not care about me and my family, or you, so I will do my own research on this topic regarding vaccines. I will always stand against this law that makes what was once a choice mandatory. 

- There is evidence out there that points out that vaccines aren't entirely safe for some individuals so arguments that portend to acknowledge a herd, or some collective social good can be reversed.- So you would sacrifice of a few individuals for the ""greater collective good""-? stretching the idea so that we can explore only so far the philosophy behind your argument can go. 

 Sure other people are different from me, and make stupid mistakes, but I should not be coerced into anything because of other peoples mistakes not to vaccinate. Its about freedom of choice.

We all die eventually, government is not going to help you live longer, but will probably speed you up dying quicker so as to save on the high cost of health care in your old age. I think they call this culling the herd. 

  The government and the corporate interests  are dancing in parliament. They look at us like  ""cattle,""  this is where I agree with you, with that 'herd immunity' mentality, we are just data numbers, or tax dollars, a constant revenue stream of money and work for them. Thus I can see why our health is such a big concern to them.

The increasing trend of giving away our freedom is painful to watch, it is a slow crawl, like this law, that empowers a centralized authority to increasingly legislate , dictate or coerce us, and in this case making something mandatory/but not. This is not my idea of freedom, liberty, or democracy;and the Herd mentality that argues for this immoral law is unfortunately going to lose on all three of these important values 

Some points

-Look at what business will benefit from this law- big pharma corporations

Nonetheless, one can't deny that the law basically forces families who are poor to vaccinate their children-(not the state's children),or risk losing their own tax dollars coming back to them via the "" childcare benefits/subsidies"" that they need to look after their children: or you can be rich and choose to vaccinate or not. 

When do the parents get to make their own decisions, and not have to defer to the state regarding the welfare of their own children? Why should the state dictate to me what vaccines I must give my children? Why do we defer our health and safety to the state in all cases?  What about religious or personal exemptions of the familes, who has the right to judge people for their beliefs ? 

 Most vaccinations I would say have scientific merit, but this merit does not justify a penalty for 'non-compliance', nor using legal means to coerce a population towards whatever goal. 

This type of government action is immoral, pointing us down a slippery slope of increasing government intervention into the aspects of population control/management. You can look at this law whatever way you want, but it is a law that curates coercion.

But I was shocked when I found out that the company which is producing the Compass program in Vancouver has direct ties to the military intelligence complex.WTF

The compass card is just another layer of  control and power being exercised over us, look at it as a form of social conditioning of an easily identifiable and placated populace. Remember facial recognition has been used by our government before,RFID (located in your compass card, credit card, etc) plus all your other digital devices leave a radio trace, and these can be identified in real time, in any location, from space or the front of a store. I am truly concerned with what this type of power will bring. God forbid they start scanning our eyes, collecting DNA samples, or making it law to deposit finger prints- like in other countries. 

While the potentiality for abuse of the Compass card program is there, it is miniscule, but in association with everything else I have mentioned, i.e. military ties, the potential for abuse is significantly higher, and the power that goes along with that potentiality is too much.

 The fact is that the compass card system, while perhaps clamping down on evasion, is going to cost more in the long run, more than all the loss revenue accorded to evasion-which was probably more based on income level and not people being jerks. Furthermore, technology fails at much more rapid pace than simple mechanical mechanisms, compass card systems will need to be replaced, updated, etc, this will cost a lot more than simple mechanical devices- this could be where the snake oil salesman makes his money.

The aspects of conspiracy that could probably be better researched , are as follows.
Users can and will be more easily tracked, and identifiable. This will be clearer in the future and I suggest you read http://www.genuinewitty.com/2012/08/22/will-vancouvers-new-transit-passes-be-spying-on-you-and-who-has-access/

-what I think is weird is that over the last 5 years there has been a big push by corporations, or whatever, to digitize our economy, not just in Vancouver. But across N.America cities have been adopting these types of electronic systems. We in BC, also had the controversy regarding the installation of smart meters to surveil(by any other name) our energy consumption and and how we use it, what items in our house. In this case, the technology does very much have the ability to do more harm than good. 

-I am also concerned that the Compass card system is part in parcel of much larger social engineering force being unleashed upon us to digitize money, and construct an environment that fosters digital currency as opposed to paper currency. In this case the Compass card system actually leads to greater inequality. 

 I am more inclined to think that the installation and social dimension of the compass card has some nefarious modalities that society will slowly wake up too, or fall asleep too. 

-Update- I found out that the Compass card system was designed and implemented by a company called Cubic Corporation, based out of San Diego, they are in transport/military industries. Well you can probably see that my eye lit up a bit when I read that. Moreover, Cubic is closely tied to an even more nefarious company called Trapwire, which is a surveillance company- NO CONSPIRACY HERE....... Anyways I found this link as well

972,"That is actually very interesting on several levels. First let me say that the  problems Sunic is discussing between positive and negative identities is very real, and exemplified well. This post-modern, globalized cultural entropy that is taking place now has the potential to offer a absolution to old negative cultural patterns of identity, however, it seemingly is building new ones, white guilt is a good one, rape culture is another, post-colonial corporate rackets, it all exists is some ismology, somewhere. 

That said, I cannot necessarily agree with the context of placing identity  into what is essentially another false identity that found in the political projects of, i.e. the European Union, Reich, etc. While no doubt , eg. I am Canadian and I live in what is essentially a completely multi-cultural society, from which all Canadians find themselves in, our identity is not wrapped up in hockey and beer for the most part, while that is my Canadian identity, this doesnt define me, nor does it equate to my access to the institutions of power that really exercise the reflection of Canadian peoples, namely the government. So I am always wary at expanding political projects in the name of new identities, specifically wary of the intentions of the new European Union, and ask myself, as I think Sunic as, if this is a project for positive of negative?

977,"I have thought a lot about this for some reason based on interest and hobby. Spent a lot of time reading and studying ww2. I have always figured that if the Japanese managed to capture Midway, move on to Attu, Hawaii, and all other major Pacific bases then basically Japan would have controlled the Pacific. Thus the war would have gone on a lot longer-(hard to ever say what would have exactly happened). Eventually, the Australians, New Zealand, Dutch, British, and France, would all have all been effectively cutoff from the South Pacific and West Indian ocean. While at the same time Japan could more easily defend the East, it could focus on a series of other maneuvers to strengthen its foothold on its Western, Southern, and Northern fronts.

The historical diversion takes place with the Americans losing key ports in Australia and the rest of the South Pacific, which would have happened if all Japans strategic goals were met in 42-43. That would have made Macarthur's island hopping campaign towards Japan all but impossible, due to what you said, basically too long lines of communication and supply.

Now, the issues is what would Japan do next. With a solidification of the eastern flank of Japan, they definitely could put a lot more resources into consolidating their hold on mainland China and perhaps moving on into British held India, and perhaps key islands in the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka, and maybe as far East as Yemen, and Oman-UK protectorates at the time, and then on to support the Italians in Ethiopia, and the middle east, or something like that. They would have never invaded N.America. 

 In terms of Russia, I never really understood the historical detente between Japan and Russia. This non-aggression treaty  basically lasted up until Russia invaded near the end of the war. I think it had something to do with a series of minor border skirmishes in Manchuria in the 30's early 40s, where the Japanese got spanked by the Russians, and specifically got their ranks bedazzled at Russian tanks- tanks  were not a Japanese speciality, they did not have a lot of them, and the Russians had over 30000 at the start of 42. So this would have deterred the Japanese from having offensive notions. 

 If the Japanese were to coordinate their attacks with the Germans in 42, the Axis war against the USSR may have garnered a different outcome. I think that many of the reservists troops in the fall and winter of 42, defending Moscow eg, were taken from the far east. Still, Russia is huge, and the Japanese would have had the most difficult time making inroads into Russia's far east. The city of Vladivostok, and the Kamchatka Peninsula, contained very few strategic concerns or interests for Japan or Russia. Moreover, a large loss of land in the East for Russia would not have made much difference in terms of affecting the manufacturing and industrial war on the European front, with the exception of simply drawing resources, men and material, away from the European front lines-but to what effect is variable to Japans increasing focus to defense of the Pacific and offense in other directions. 

Key Points.
As Japan
- I would look into the provocative economic actions of FDR and the Americans in 41-42, specifically the results of the oil embargo.
- History proves that FDR wanted war with Japan, so he could have war with Germany, etc
- For Japan this was meant to be a war not just for expansion and economic reasons, there was pride in the idea of the expulsion of historical European colonial influence in Asia. 
-Japan had goals to bomb the Panama Canal, with long range aircraft carrier subs, interesting note.
-Japan had been fighting in a war in China since 1938
-- subsequently they had a war economy, which supported  a very large and experienced- navy, airforce, and army, and 
-at the start of the war America, had a very weak army, air force, and a similar size navy, all of it green; 
-and had the Japanese used there resources more effectively you could have had the results above. 
But  bad Japanese decision making and good american intelligence stopped the Japanese at Midway, and the rest was history.
