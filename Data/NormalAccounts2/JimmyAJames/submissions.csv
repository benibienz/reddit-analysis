I want to see America great again, and I thought I would share with you some of my ideas. 

I start with Popular Science magazine in its heyday. My grandfather left me a collection of magazines from the 30s to 1950s, and this was a huge extrospection of what made America great before. These books gave me a general idea of what made America great and how its people could overcome any natural, scientific, or man made problem. 

While the context of Popular Science in the 30's and 40's was war and the need to adapt to the social-cultural need for an ethos dedicated to the functionality of a a military state; there was, for a short decade or two after WW2, a period of time where anything seemed possible, and all men were given the oppurtunity to learn new skills, and adapt old ones, to create a grande Americana.

 And, although America declined through the 60's and so on, it did so with majestic grace in all areas of human endeavour. There no doubt is a human quality associated with the notions of the ability to be free, to have free speech and to be able to cultivate a quality of mind. What happened?
 
Well lots of things happened. Not to get into details, but the John Birch Society was right, so is Ron Paul, and so is Donald Trump. Donald, can you make America great again? Or, are you just pulling our legs? You didn't strike me as a [jester](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOUFsCS7xYE&amp;t=2s). BTW, best roast ever.

The magazines in those days were littered with [adverts](https://www.google.ca/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fnational-radiation-instrument-catalog.com%2FImage304.gif&amp;imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fnational-radiation-instrument-catalog.com%2Fhistorical_ads.htm&amp;docid=FQq2Dow-HOAy2M&amp;tbnid=vFnN0OsKG0qAyM%3A&amp;vet=1&amp;w=1023&amp;h=767&amp;bih=575&amp;biw=922&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitkem9mbTQAhUFMGMKHa53BTkQMwhDKBwwHA&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8) for all sorts of products, and promises of explanation and the potential to learn the ways of the future. 

The industrial era of the 1930's and 40s left America today only with a gross appetite for machined goods and manufactured products. I think you forgot what it means to build and create from the ground up. Hint America....The intellectual property that is collected within the realm of America is immense and of such quality that all of humanity will only benifit from your re-greatness. 

Everything is right there in front of you. The resources, the Men and Women, the knowledge, and the will, to build a great America.There is an abundance of material goods and technological resources many of you just need to learn, to take that leap into the unknown, to raise yourself, your family ,and essentially the society around you, to new heights. Lets hope them be noble. 

At this moment the Corporations that have originated in America, and built from the blood of all your forefathers, has been sold away; however, you own the rights to your own destiny.

And although I failed to acknowledge the actualities in terms of the re-industrialization of the west, I attempted to allude to the fact that new manufacturing potential in the regions who have lost all of it is one way for your hands to dream for the stars. That sounds kinda of nice.

Carpe Core Pirac, that could actually in fact make America like ten times greater.

The trouble is based in the fact that the male narritive, as related to the problems of globalism have not been adequately addressed in our western society. 

In fact the male narritive has been disrupted by questions of moral legitimacy- but ""male"" righteousness does not need to be problematized, just worked out. Specifically since it is western males, more so than western females, that have suffered unduly from globalist effects.

The argument I put forward is much more complex than stating simply that globalist forces are implicit in their destruction of male ways of being, and there are too many examples to bring forth. However, globalist ideological forces have over time helped bring forth and construct social and cultural narratives that demonize the western male and different ways of being a 'male', in all cultural, social, biological, and economic spheres. 

While there is an equal amount of harm being done to western women in terms of globalist forces, at least their narritive is heard and the facts expressed, questionably. For example, feminism, or other cultural appropriating forces , tend to lock step their ideology on the notion of the 'false consciousness' of the western male and that patriarchy is the casus bellis of their problem. Thus, in this case an ideology is seen creating, in essence, a modality or undergrowth of misandry- the hatred of men in general. 

However, the real notion of power or hegemonic force that is troubling women is not male rule, but globalism and its tentacled outreach of elite manipulation of our economic, social, cultural and biological spheres who claim or allude to the wrong issues.

 The facts of inequality of men as opposed to females in western society is, for the most part, showing downward or negative trends, in terms of lowering standards on social, cultural, economic, and biological markers. For example, unemployment is higher despite that there are normally more males presented in western populations. Male levels or scores related to education participation and achievement are lower in several categories; i could also add incarceration rates, suicide rates, average age of death in comparison, and homelessness. 

No doubt the divisiveness of the presidential election in America has empowered the illogical foundations of social justice, and their ideological foundation; however, don't fret. Social justice failure is imminent, because of their irrationality and logical fallacies in terms of analysis of , and the fact that warriors and their ilk fail to see the hypocrisy of their actions, eventually they come to represent the things they hate. 

I will leave it at that, enough philosophy for one day.

To summarize the following will show 

-	A unique telling of the Trump phenomenon sociological and psychological. 
-	An explanation for the divisiveness that haunts America.

I don’t know what honestly drives this man’s deep ambition, showmanship, and moral persuasion. I don’t expect many people do. Money has always been his main goal it seems, but there was always something else attached to his striving for success- at least to me there is a real glimmer of something more than just a really good salesman. And while not all salesmen are successful, Trump was and is. But more importantly he has continued to be an established mediated figure to present Americans proof of real success. Trump has and always will be celebrated for his American business acumen and the real notion of what it means to live American dreams.

Some people call him a racist and or misogynist; but, I just infer that those people are in their own ways racists and misandrists. While his tongue slips, at least he is human, unlike his competitor- which in a very deep way reflected quite nicely on a one Donald Trump. Trump has at moments spoken from his heart, and I hope this represents the will and way to positive change that domestic and international America desperately needs. 

That is domestically, I hope Trump puts an end to the racial, sexual, religious, and gender battles that have ramped up under Bush and Obama; all lives matter, all genders matter; and having lost the presidency doesn’t grant you the ability to specifically identify your gender, or another’s gender or sex, as the basis for your failure and success. Worse thing I see, is that many people are now reaching out and exclaiming that all Trump voters were poor uneducated white males. Identity politics in the basis of who is president is of poor taste and the antithesis to the function and principles of good government, economic success and quality leadership provided in spirit to all people.

And on a side note, so many of these narratives and discourses being presented in the public are just false, and they are merely creating a narrative of hoping to create pseudo collective guilt- despite attempts of Clinton to unify all communities specifically women, as noted in her concession speech; the fact is, she failed at unifying a country. 

Once again we need to end identity politics, so yes some people voted for Trump because he was a white male, but these aren’t the only reasons why millions of Americans voted for him. I like Trump for his many ethical stances, and his unwavering talent at identifying the economic issues, military issues, policy issues that excite many Americans.  

There are so many issues that both plague and bless the USA. Trump can present a quality of understanding that at least some people can understand or mimic in response to the real economic and social injustices taking place, not the contrived ones of main stream media. For example, it looks as if Trump is the type of individual who will bring the real change and hope that Obama failed to deliver. 

While Trump is at times a very bombastic and charismatic individual, underneath a coif of equally established title, he is a much bigger man of principle. I think in some public moments Trump is probably at his worse, but with seasoning he is actually a tolerable individual. Moreover, Trumps name is less frequented under headline excerpts related to drone attacks, conspiracy, corporations, lobbyist, lawyer, murder, etc. 

And again, Trumps nature, his quality, his quest for moral and ethical justice is totally inverted when you think of him in comparison to a case like the Clinton, whose only redeeming quality was her politically polite and pleasant exterior- the inversion happens when we noticed that Clinton is marked by such a dark cloud of vicious and unpleasant real historical actions. In essence what Clinton did and couldn’t escape from turned off a lot of American people. 

So two champions wrestled in the arena, but now we must grow together a seemingly divided and separate nation. There are competing ideologies that must be transmuted and evolve. At least Trump is a self-made man with the proper executive outlook somewhat and hopefully more adept at the role than probably just as many men before him. 

Most notably, and in presumptive righteous action, at least it seems that Trump is in line most of the world, in bringing it into peace and prosperity. If there is a will there is a way. Create, construct, build, machine, design, grow, love and prosper. Hopefully this is the change the Donald J. Trump brings.

Why? Because Carbon monetization is an attempt to monetize our economic waste, and place the burden directly on the people, and not the corporations who, or which, have directed the use of carbon energy for the last several decades, and have actually hindered progress towards other novel energy designs. That said, the burden will always come down on regular people.

More than likely Carbon monetization will lead to the increase in carbon taxes, and the creation of carbon markets where financial instruments will be created and traded that will create an even bigger illusion. That is we cannot fix the costs of our civilization by quantifying every aspects of our lives, the only notion being served by carbon monetization is the false belief that it is for the 'collective good'.

The monetization of carbon can make no promises as a step towards solving global environmental issues, i.e. the use of fossil fuel use in China. The monetization of Carbon in Canada will only add another stranglehold to the prosperity of the middle class, as the creeping regressive nature of pricing carbon makes things simply more expensive, i.e. your travel to work, your daily need for food, all will be more. And do not pull that 'revenue neutral' crap, who taxes- then gives it all back, what social value does that serve?

While it may bring a certain level of satisfaction to some, that 'someone is doing something about the environment', there is no rational argument that can be made that says monetizing Carbon will actually fix our environment, or lead to alternative energy production.

Spoiler Alerts!

So I have seen the movie Sicario where it basically tells the story of a group of CIA, military, intelligence operatives placing their ""own agent"" in control of South American drug smuggling. In a way this movie mirrors reality. 

If you read the ""literature"" it is somewhat easier to prove that the government, namely the CIA, (which at the time was headed by George Bush Sr.) was involved in trafficking and profiting off the control of the narcotics trade, both domestically and abroad.  

Rewind back a few years and we see Josh Brolin playing George W. Bush in the movie W., coincidence? or a Conspiracy of revealing the true mindset of the elite functionaries, their depths and the depravity to which they seek?

All around the world people are starting to wake up and take a stand against the current political establishment. Doesn't mean people are happy about it.. Take for example the BBC article on Jeb Bush refusal to back Trump. 
http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-36234318

Its a 'low energy' post that only covers half of what Jeb Bush says. See his Facebook post: https://www.facebook.com/jebbush/posts/876702172458827 

The elite Brits are probably mad at Trumps pragmatic and popular gesture of being a proponent of the UK backing out of the EU, in the Brexit.  A little bit of sovereignty for everyone, tastes so sweet. 

But let me highlight the sad thing Jeb, turtle in a half shell says, about the Don. It is basically an empty and vacuous attempt at shell shock, just like the low energy Turtle himself. Jeb goes on to say
    ""Donald Trump has not demonstrated that temperament or strength of character. He has not displayed a respect for the Constitution. And, he is not a consistent conservative. These are all reasons why I cannot support his candidacy.""

Okay, you can see how its a meaningless insult that lacks any empirical credibility. But the kicker is that Jeb is really hating on Hillary Clinton even more.    Jeb says,
     ""Hillary Clinton has proven to be an untrustworthy liberal politician who, if elected, would present a third term of the disastrous foreign and economic policy agenda of Barack Obama.""

Proof that Hillary would basically ruin everything.

I kept thinking to myself these very foreboding feelings about being in a car accident. I drove safely, and I avoided big trucks, as I thought that they were probably the biggest threats on the highway.

I arrived safely at my friends, hung out for a bit, and then started to drive home. The weather was still bad, the roads specifically were pretty slick. But once again I kept thinking about a car accident, and at one point I was thinking about a car accident I witnessed about a year and a half ago up ahead on the same road which I was travelling on. 

I don't remember what happened, but the traffic, more specifically the car in front of me stopped suddenly, and I stepped on my brakes, however, I locked up and slid about 30 feet, rear ending the car in front of me. Basically on the same road I witnessed the accident on before, not really a surprise as it is a ""bad area for car crashes"". 

Needless to say I was a bit shocked, the accident comes at a bad time for me;however, I am flabbergasted that I had such strong intuitive feelings about a car crash that haunted me throughout the day, up until the incident.

The beast is a conceptual eschatology, and it is all encompassing; comprising, the person, a thing, societies, culture, and economies, and their utter downfall. 

Allegorically the beast is all of us to some degree or another, but conspiratorial in a way some of us are more complicit in feeding the beast than others; but we are all guilty to a degree.

There is an obvious modality that underscores foundational aspects of our collective and individual psychology, society, culture, economy, and all various methods of our madness; it is the shit that the beast leaves behind. This mess and destruction underpins all of us, and essentially society, this karmic shit is found in the moments of greed, vice, war, deception, immorality, injustice, and even the inequalities, that shape our collective and individual realities.

Basically our faults lie in our collective and individual perceptions of life. I would think Freud's concept of Eros and Thanatos. We can explain this allegory of the beast and our perception of it as a conception of two inter-related but separate ways of perceiving the world; One way is via abundance, love, unity, creation (eros); versus the other way of death drive and the ultimate decay of thanatos. Love and Fear are the ultimate emotional signifiers that explicate your perception, and phenomenological horizon.

Don't be fooled by those pretending to be the beast. Instead approach the beast with rationality and with caution, be critical of what's said and what is in your heart. 

Knowing is half the battle.

Bio of Robert Selman.
Selman's research has focused on helping children develop social-awareness and social-engagement competencies as a way to reduce risks to their health, as well as to promote their social relationships and academic performance.[3][4][5] His work on the promotion of children's understanding of ways to get along with others from different backgrounds[6][7] is conducted in the context of literacy and language arts curricula at the elementary level;[8][9] in school-based programs designed to coordinate support and prevention services for students in public middle schools;[10] and in the social studies, literature, and history curricula for high schools. His past work focused on the treatment of psychological disorders of youth in day school and residential treatment and the prevention of these disorders in children and adolescents placed at risk[11][12]

However, it is more difficult to prove its validity. I still think that it is more logical and rational to assume; although feminism may offer solutions to men's problems, even suicide; that these solutions may not be the best. Furthermore, there is the conceptual notion that the mainstay of feminism, its foundational nature, is based on the structural, institutional, and familial assumptions, of patriarchy, ie the rule of men. This is the argument, and facts to prove and disprove this are true.

Now if the issue of gender equality comes into play, there are more questions, and even more contradictions. Because, gender is not by nature equal. In fact they are opposite ends of the biological structures which interconnected build our society and culture. But this is an entire debate that no one really wants to get into, I mean fully know the subject that they are talking about. The ability to wage violence is perhaps the greatest gift and the greatest curse god granted men.

One example of a problem, as far as I can see is the nature of our economic institutions, and our collective fallacies regarding the nature of work, and distributions of income. While our collective structures may grant a certain group of men more privilege in the boardroom for example; overall in the grander scheme of all our production- the economic conditions show that more men are unemployed than women, at least here is one problem I see with the logic of feminism. There are a lot of other social and economic indicators that prove that men are at a greater material disadvantage than women.
However, no one has ever fretted over this, no man really dare speak the truth, that he would happily lay his life on the line for his wife, daughter, or son. Men are the first to be collectively sacrificed to death, this offers us not social or cultural rewards, for the most part. I don't want to whine, but I am sure someone will point that out.
There is an inherent contradiction in the nature of feminism solving mens problems, because for feminism to exist men are the problem in the first place. Is it 10 seconds later?

Now, it is very difficult to argue the validity of patriarchy and matriarchy, but both power and privilege is exalted in its practice and is dismissed from both dichotomies of thinking, and sometimes incorporated, we can include all other outliers, distributed among a normal distribution of society and culture.

I think identity politics and gender relations need a whole new rethink. I reject feminism because it is impossible for its thinking to reconcile the other, especially in a Canadian example, and if the other is the problem to begin with.",sjwhate,Why Feminism can never realize true gender equality.,https://www.reddit.com/r/sjwhate/comments/4437tx/why_feminism_can_never_realize_true_gender/

The Peaceful Warrior was a good book and a decent movie, and only in spirit is it connected to this post. The spirit of: conviction, will, determination, strength, and ultimate responsibility.

My purpose here is to strategically form a battle plan of  understanding, determining what it means to live in the warrior phase of manhood. 

I am not trying to brackett other conceptual identities in relation of warriorship in relation to other masculinist perspectives. I am only attempting to build-up a conceptual framework around the idea of  warriorship, and how it relates to the development of our  inner character. 

Where does it begin? What rights of passage do we go through that mark ourselves men? Is this the period of time that we are meant to  build our legacy? How do we develop our emotions, and our responses, to new ideas and challenges?

There is a beautiful moment in the movie the Big Short where Steve Carell, who plays Marc Baum, a hedge-fund investor with Morgan Stanley, realizes; that although he stands to make a small fortune, his consciousness will forever be mared in the absolute corruption in the system and himself, and this will need to be resolved in some ways. 

The question, was the price worth the moment the day the sun shone on you?Carrel's characterization of Baum, was to represent his complicity in the events, but from the anti-thesis from the ""big bank"" perspective, i.e. greed is good, ignorance is good, knowledge is power and knowledge should be withheld or hidden etc. The movie is brilliant at portraying the dichotomy and contradiction on Wall street.  
 
Anyways.... in the most recent Armstrong post he writes....

     ""Theories on how to manipulate society have brought us to the brink of disaster. How money moves, and what money actually is, cannot yet be understood. The impact of interest rates and attempts to artificially keep them low to stimulate the economy has routinely failed. These behind-the-scene-machinations have done far more damage to society, as civil unrest rises in the wake of such failed manipulations. Understanding the world financial markets is now essential to our survival, and biased opinion is threatening to make freedom and democracy of Western civilization an extinct species.""

Thoughts?

For what its worth, he is correct in this assumption, and understanding of the financial wizardry that takes place is paramount. The Big Short mentions this conspiracy as fact, and hence is a movie that acts as an interchange between understanding and action. I'm just waxing poetic here, but join in.

Over the course of whenever, and I don’t like to make commitments on time, I am going to attempt to elucidate the notions of why a men’s right movement is necessary, and why it is important for this movement to emerge in Canada. I also sense that a similar urgency to action is needed in many other western countries, ahem, U.S, Europe! So I think my elucidation will offer every men’s rights proponents a unique perspective on the need for... Menism, (Does that have a ring to it?) 

What are Men’s Rights? What is the Men’s right movement? And what are the social conditions needed for it to emerge as a social phenomenon in Canada? These are questions some people may ask themselves when confronted with the notion of men’s rights.
 
Now let me warn you before I begin to answer these questions, or as the intellectual will announce-let me preface my bias, history, and experience.  I only chose Canada because I was born, educated, work, and live there) - and that is all you need to know-everything else is a cultural attachment to perceived values in legitimacy. 

First, I tend to have the tenacity to use big words, so if you get confused look something up (and I will reference or explicate concepts as much as I can using brackets, eg. )  I will try to keep my “rants”, as one could call them, to fewer than 1000 words, but I make no promises. Secondly, I will continuously obfuscate, and construct riddles, among the language that I use. I do not do this to be cheeky, but to subvert and transcend the normative inter-subjective meanings attached to language and my interpretation of Canadian society, or whatever- (social constructivism anyone?)- (This, btw, is the key to understanding the defensive redoubt of feminism.) (I know everything I said in the last paragraph was redundant,  but this is how a feminist, social scientist, etc, thinks, speaks, and writes- in this case, it’s the social justice warrior in me, I know-joke 

For those who like to be in the know, I have plenty of experience in the researching gender studies from many angles, up to, and including, graduate school. Subsequently, you can look to me as someone that has studied the dark arts, and been in the ’linguistic battle’- (You will soon begin to realize that the entire war being fought right now in “gender space” is linguistic). The dark arts, as I would cheekily call them, are namely defined as the social sciences: sociology, political science, psychology, economics, etc. But, I also have a statistics background to really fuck with you. 

So if you were to sum up everything that I may attempt to elucidate ‘over the course of whenever’, it would be stated as follows, and is essentially a thesis, smart asses:

Feminism has appropriated a collective cultural space that is endemic to misandry (hatred of men), via ignorance and political bias of said ideology. (This does not mean feminism as a whole explicitly is misandric.)  Menism is a counter-narrative, a counter-intelligent movement, in response to feminism, and a concept defining the need for men’s rights movements as political forces to be established and heralded in Canada as legitimate causes. 

But  let me move beyond the yin and yang of feminism, versus mens rights, or menism. In that I want Menism  to only be needed to change the narrative, and discourse, of gender equality in Canada. When this is accomplished my hopes that menism and feminism will be discarded completely. 

Next Post will detail the question: ‘But where should I begin in detailing the reasons why Canadian men and women need a mental incursion of men’s rights into gender politics?’ Maybe, but who cares.... Watch out for Part II.
