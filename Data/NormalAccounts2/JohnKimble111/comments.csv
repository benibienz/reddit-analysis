I believe that political correctness has neutered men to such an extent that, in many areas, they have completely lost their voice. While I would rather we did not need to have an International Men’s Day at all, as long as there is an International Women’s Day then I will support it as a way of ensuring that issues affecting men are also heard.

It has been an interesting path along the way to securing a debate in the chamber of the House of Commons to celebrate International Men’s Day — as we are doing today — because last year it was a battle just to get time in the much smaller Westminster Hall.

It seems that some people are quite happy to talk about issues concerning women but do not seem to see that there are also issues affecting men. In the interests of equality, I believe that all voices should be heard.

Today in Parliament, and on International Men’s Day on Saturday, there is a chance to focus on men’s issues. The aims of International Men’s Day are laudable. They include promoting male role models, celebrating the contribution men make, focusing on men’s health and wellbeing as well as highlighting discrimination against men.

Parliament is full of institutional political correctness. When it comes to women, we have a women and equalities minister, a select committee for women and equalities, a women and equalities question time — not to mention the discussion of many strategies that deal only with women in politics and the wider world. In addition, until recently, we have had a big debate on International Women’s Day with no such equivalents for men.

In this country, some people seem to advocate what I call “equality but only when it suits”. I have made this point on several occasions and been lambasted. I will not be put off though because it is an increasingly worrying trend. Some people fight for their version of equality on all the things that suit women but are very quick to point out the fact that women need special protections and treatment on other things. I cannot get away from the obvious example to illustrate this exact point — that of prison uniforms.

Men in prison on the basic regime have to wear a prison uniform. Women in prison do not. How can this be fair? Where’s the equality in that? We have a completely different policy simply based on the sex of the prisoner. The nonsensical official explanation for this is that apparently women are different and they may have self-esteem issues which prevents the policy of prison uniform applying equally. This is not backed by any formal research that would justify it and ignores the fact that boys and girls wear uniforms in school and both men and women wear uniforms in the workplace.

So, as I said, equality — but only when it suits.

In the justice system, that is only the tip of the iceberg. Women are treated more leniently than men at every stage and for every category of offence and yet pointing this out with statistic after statistic appears to have caused outrage. I said to a friend the other day that the things that I would have thought were the least controversial of my views have often caused the most outrage. This is one of them. It beggars belief that saying that men and women should be treated equally in the justice system is anything other than common sense.

People such as Jeremy Corbyn called for me to be suspended for, in effect, calling for men and women to be treated equally in the criminal justice system and daring to challenge the feminist agenda with facts. It would be a very sad day for this country if someone were to be treated this way for spelling out some inconvenient facts. Yet this is the way we are headed if we are not careful.

This is why I am delighted to have gained a debate in the House of Commons today. It is a chance to confront this and to talk about, for example, the very sad numbers of men who feel that they have no option but to take their own lives, in numbers that far outstrip women, about fathers who are being prevented from seeing their children when there is no good reason and the male victims who make up a third of all domestic abuse victims. These issues, among others, are seldom debated in parliament.

I hope that men who feel that their voices are not being heard on these and other issues are reassured by this. I also hope that we can start to tip the politically correct scales back a bit in some areas in the process.

Shortly before he died, Michael Isherwood left a handwritten note for his sister: “Mud sticks. No coming back from these allegations.”
Isherwood, 51, an inspecting engineer at Vauxhall on Merseyside, had been accused by a 16-year-old girl of secretly filming her on his phone.
Devastated, Isherwood first tried to kill himself with an overdose of paracetamol.
He recovered but could not shake off the belief that his life was in ruins. Days later he was found dead in his car after gassing himself.
His family say police have told them there was no evidence of wrongdoing: the images on his phone were of Isherwood playing golf.
Now the family are calling on police to prosecute people who make false allegations. “An innocent life has been lost because of an entirely false claim,” said Isherwood’s father, Ken, 82, of Prenton, Merseyside.
“Innocent people are being hurt. The police are leaning too far towards believing everyone who makes these allegations.
“Michael had accusations made against him that were completely false. If they punished those who made the accusations maybe they wouldn’t make these untrue claims.”
Isherwood’s story comes after crfticism of the heavy-handed way police dealt with allegations of sex offences against Sir Cliff Richard and Paul Gambaccini.
Both were publicly named and put on bail only to be cleared later without being charged.
Men without high profiles also face false accusations and sometimes suffer more severe consequences.
David Bryant, 66, a former firefighter from Christchurch, Dorset, was freed by the Appeal Court in July following almost three years in jail for a crime he did not commit. It had emerged that his accuser was a fantasist and serial liar.
Before the allegations were made against Isherwood, he appeared to be happy. He loved golf and had recently been promoted at Vauxhall.
In April this year he went on holiday. Six days after he returned the police arrived to tell him that he had been accused of secretly filming a 16-year-old girl. He denied doing anything wrong.
He was put on police bail, his phone was taken from him for examination and he was instructed to stay away from certain people and areas in his native Birkenhead.
The bail conditions even barred him from being alone with his eight-year-old niece to whom he was close.
Within days Isherwood had disappeared. When he next contacted his family he was in hospital in Warrington having taken an overdose.
Peter Beattie, a friend and an approved mental health professional, visited him. “He was devastated,” Beattie said. “He told me he didn’t do it.
“I work in this field and I asked him, ‘Did you mean to end your life?’ And he said, ‘Yes.’ I said, ‘Can you assure us you won’t try it again?’ He said, ‘How can I do that? My life is over.’”
Beattie added: “He was a broken man.”
Isherwood was transferred to Clatterbridge Hospital in Wirral for psychiatric treatment but then discharged to live with his parents after doctors assured his mother, Jean, 82, he was not mentally ill.
She recalls: “He had changed beyond recognition. He told me, ‘They have taken everything away from me.’”
Isherwood succeeded in killing himself just five weeks from the moment he had been told of the allegations against him.
Sue Isherwood, 47, his sister, said that when she asked the police how such an investigation could be launched based on so little, she was told: “It happens all the time.”
“When they said they had found no evidence on Michael’s phone I asked whether they would prosecute the person who made the false complaint, and they just said no,” she said.
The family are writing to Jane Kennedy, the Merseyside police and crime commissioner, urging her to adopt a policy of prosecuting in cases of false allegations.
Merseyside police said that security settings on Isherwood’s phone had hampered their investigation.
“Mr Isherwood was bailed so that an examination could be made of a mobile phone and laptop that had been seized as evidence,” a spokesman said. “Concerns were raised by Mr Isherwood’s family regarding the allegations at the conclusion of the case.”",2016-10-11 01:10:24+00:00,d8mp03n,2.0,t1_d8mopgt,415.0,Liverpool

373,"When you are Labour’s foreign affairs spokesman, you can expect to be asked a few questions about foreign affairs if you decide to appear on Sky News.

Unfortunately Emily Thornberry was totally stuck for answers when presenter Dermot Murnaghan challenged her to name the foreign minister of France (Jean-Marc Ayrault) or to give the name or gender of the South Korean president (Park Geun Hye).

To fill the silence, Thornberry decided to accuse Murnaghan of being patronising and conducting the equivalent of a pub quiz. He would not have asked such questions of any male politician, she fumed.

There are two ways of reacting to this. You might say: “Right on, sister, facing down sexism!” Or you might say: “What an absolute twit!”

I’m afraid I’m in the latter camp. Thornberry exposed woeful ignorance. In the process of arranging a trip to France to meet her French counterpart, she clearly didn’t even know his name.

The woman thing doesn’t wash at all. Asking such questions is a standard trick by mischievous journalists to trap politicians into revealing their ignorance, and most of its victims have been men.

Interviewed in 1998 on BBC 5 Live, Labour’s schools minister Stephen Byers was unable to calculate seven times eight. In a BBC interview before this year’s London mayoral election, the Conservative candidate Zac Goldsmith failed to name Underground stations on the Central Line or to identify Queens Park Rangers as the football team that plays at Loftus Road.

In 2011, Murnaghan asked Labour’s shadow chancellor Alan Johnson to give the current rate of employers’ national insurance contributions. He was unable to answer.

Murnaghan obviously decided to tease Thornberry because he thought she wasn’t up to it. She duly proved the point. She then did what blustering cowards often do: try to cover up her failings by blaming and defaming the person who has exposed them.

Are women really cheering her on? Or are they flinching at the spectacle of yet another woman playing the feminist victim card to cover up her limitations?

Many will probably have nodded in agreement with the Scottish Tory leader, Ruth Davidson, who tweeted about the Thornberry row: “Plenty of genuine sexism &amp; misogyny in politics. Don’t need prominent women debasing the term to cover their own poor performance. Jeez.” Jeez indeed. There are many able women in politics, such as Davidson herself, who would never be asked “pub quiz” questions because their competence simply wouldn’t be in doubt.

    Men are actively discriminated against, with women being shoehorned on to party candidate selection lists or preferred for job promotion

Of course there are sexist attitudes in politics just as anywhere else. Women politicians often run the gauntlet, from contempt to overt harassment. Who can forget David Cameron’s patronising “Calm down, dear” with which he tried to discomfort Labour’s Angela Eagle? Female MPs have described male colleagues telling them how they would look down women’s tops during debates, or had taken bets on what they would wear. On social media, female politicians attract a huge amount of vile and threatening abuse.

Yet a woman is now prime minister; Scotland and Northern Ireland have female first ministers; and the leaders of Scotland’s Labour and Tory parties are both women.

Women are often given preferential treatment in public life. Men are actively discriminated against, with women being shoehorned on to party candidate selection lists or preferred for job promotion. The result is that in areas such as the law, police, civil service or politics some women have been damagingly over-promoted, with men reluctant to do anything about it for fear of being called sexist.

With all this, surely women cannot claim they are still the victims of sustained discrimination, can they? Oh yes they can. It is now a near-unchallengeable given that men subject women to a raw deal.

Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society which campaigns for women’s rights, complained on the eve of Theresa May’s arrival in Downing Street that the focus on her shoes and gender showed women politicians were “all being objectified and undermined and ridiculed”.

But much if not most of the attention devoted to May’s kitten-heels has come from women writers. The politician whose hairstyle has attracted most attention is Boris Johnson. On his holiday beach, paunchy Cameron was accused of not being “beach-body ready” and his shorts attracted derision. The trivialising of politics is gender-blind.

Thornberry has done herself no favours in the past. During the Rochester by-election in 2014 she tweeted in snobbish disbelief a photograph of a house draped with England flags, with a white van parked on the drive.

This year as shadow defence minister she is said to have asked, at a meeting to discuss the Trident nuclear deterrent, “Can someone explain Defcon One and Two to me? I’ve only ever seen it in films.” Since “Defcon One”, which is short for “defence readiness condition”, is the term for imminent nuclear war this left her colleagues aghast.

Some Labour colleagues roll their eyes at the mention of Thornberry’s name. Are they all sexist too? No, they’re just embarrassed and exasperated by someone whose gaffes make it that much more difficult for their party to regain its credibility. By playing the feminist card to conceal her failings, she has devalued real female political achievement, and will have managed to offend many women too.",2016-09-19 21:10:35+00:00,d7torne,1.0,t3_53ju0q,81.0,ukpolitics

427,"A former counterterrorism sergeant has attacked the Metropolitan police for failing to tackle extremist views among some of its Muslim officers for fear of being labelled “Islamophobic”.

Javaria Saeed, a practising Muslim who worked in Scotland Yard’s counterterrorism division, complained to her bosses after she witnessed a fellow Muslim officer saying female genital mutilation (FGM) — illegal in the UK since 1985 — was a “clean and honourable practice ” and “shouldn’t be criminalised”.

The same officer, a Muslim constable in the SO15 counterterrorism unit, also said female Muslim victims of domestic violence should not appeal to the police for help, but resolve their cases in a sharia court, except in “serious violent cases”, according to Saeed. However, although she raised both comments with her managers, she said they failed to take action against the officer because they were afraid of being accused of racism.
Whistleblower speaks out: Islamic extremism in the Met

Saeed’s attack on “political correctness” at Scotland Yard comes after West Midlands police sparked outrage when they said Muslim officers could be allowed to wear niqabs — full-face veils to reflect the “community we serve”.

Even the Muslim Council of Britain said women who wore veils would “probably not want to be in the police” because of their strict views.

Saeed, who speaks four languages, including Urdu and Punjabi, and worked in several departments, including prison intelligence, during her 10-year career, said she was demonised by some fellow Muslim officers, labelled a “bad Muslim” for not wearing a hijab (Islamic headdress) and told she was “better off at home looking after your husband”.

Saeed, 35, said she resigned in March after becoming disheartened by “political correctness”, which allowed an “us and them” culture to thrive among some Muslim officers who considered themselves beyond the law.

In her first interview since quitting, Saeed told The Sunday Times that the Met applied a different standard when looking into complaints against some Muslim officers from those it applied to non-Muslims. There are 600 Muslim officers in the Met.

“Racism in the Met is not from white officers in my case, but from Muslim officers who the service refused to properly investigate because they were afraid of being called Islamophobic and racist,” said Saeed.

    If such views were held and expressed by white officers, they would be fired 

She also worked in the Muslim Contact Unit (MCU) within SO15, which was set up to improve relations between police and the Islamic community.

“My experiences were that it was Muslim officers being racist towards my individual views; also in private, holding racist views against white officers, and sexist views against females,” she said.

“If such views were held and expressed by white officers, they would be fired.”

Saeed said she joined the police in the wake of the 2005 London bombings to help bridge the division between the Muslim community and the authorities. “I was warned by family and friends against joining because they thought I’d be racially discriminated against by white officers. But I resigned because of the sickening views and behaviour of some Muslim officers.”

Saeed said she was advised by her superiors not to make an official complaint against the Muslim constable for his comments about FGM and domestic violence with the professional standards unit because it would “hinder” her own “career progression and tarnish my reputation”.

She did, however, raise the comments with her line manager in August 2013. When no action was taken against the officer, Saeed approached Detective Superintendent Jonathan Wilson, who was responsible for the MCU. Saeed claimed Wilson told her he was aware of the constable’s views and felt they were not in line with those of the police.

In a separate meeting, Saeed raised comments made by another MCU member, also a Muslim constable, whom she accused of saying that Pakistan’s security problems would be resolved with a “strict religious solution . . . like the Taliban”.

She said Wilson assured her they would be investigated as part of a review into the MCU, which was carried out in December 2013. The Met said this weekend that the review produced a number of recommendations that were implemented but would not say what these were.

A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said the constable who made the comments regarding FGM was given “management action” — a procedure often given for minor offences and which could result in an officer doing something as trivial as a training course.

However, both he and the other officer in question remain in their jobs, despite the MCU being merged into the community engagement team this year.

“You give management action to minor offences, so it’s pretty outrageous that the Met did not take proper action against him,” Saeed said. “If he was a white officer, he would have been fired.”",2016-09-12 04:17:41+00:00,d7j6eeu,1.0,t3_52ckz4,215.0,ukpolitics

435,"I haven't suggested for a second that all suicide cases are down to reactive depression, in fact the difference in suicide rates is so vast that there would still probably be more men that women taking their own lives even if we tackled all the reactive cases.

On the other hand, even in less reactive cases, society's contempt for men and issues such as contact denial could still be the last straw for a man with more longstanding mental health issues.

The number of suicidal men contacting organisations such as Fathers4Justice shows there's a genuine issue here and ultimately it would be a hell of a lot easier to reform the family law courts (and the justice system as a whole) than to try to later repair all the lives they ruin on a daily basis.

Even if things are as you claim, then why risk putting vulnerable men (and their kids) through the trauma and abuse of long term contact denial in the first place? Perhaps they'd still take their lives 20 years later due to a different traumatic issue, but you'd still have allowed children to have a father while they grew up.",2016-09-10 18:44:25+00:00,d7h87s0,3.0,t1_d7h6myq,2308.0,ukpolitics

437,"I'm actually getting tired of these articles that claim men just need to talk more and suicides would somehow be fixed. I'm sure that's true in a minority of cases, but ultimately a lot of men don't want to talk about their problems because no one is helping them find solutions.

Men denied contact with their kids who've lost everything in a divorce don't want to talk about how their life has been ruined and his they'll never see their kids again. They want their problems fixing but in most cases there's just no prospect of it happening in the current climate so what's the point in talking if it's not going to achieve anything?

A lot of male suicide isn't due to unexplained depression that occurs out of the blue, their depression is **reactive** i.e. a response  to terrible events or terrible circumstances in their lives. In a lot of cases it would therefore be far better to actually tackle the root causes of the problem rather than just trying to manage the symptoms.

Even when it comes to talking a lot of people get this wrong too, a lot of men tend to prefer to talk shoulder to shoulder rather than face to face, so in other words usually when engaged in some sort of activity.

That statement isn't really true. The point applies to the most severe forms of FGM, but then there are more than 4 types of FGM, two of which are less invasive and damaging than MGM.

Despite this, all forms of FGM are illegal, even the very mildest types.

1057,"This case is just extraordinary. Economu was firstly denied justice in that the CPS wouldn't' prosecute his false accuser so he had to do all the work for them and then essentially force them to prosecute due to his overwhelming collection of evidence.

His false accuser took her life once she was exposed, only for the likes of the BBC and Guardian to essentially to carry on after her deaths as if her false accusations had merit and as if Economu was a rapist rather than the victim: https://hequal.wordpress.com/2014/11/08/victory-bbc-backs-down-over-dishonest-rape-victim-headline/

There was then a huge feminist outcry over the fact that a false accusers had actually been charged for her crimes, with the rad fem head of the CPS promising to investigate. However, even someone as misandrist as her still found they had been right to bring the case.

Saunders didn't disappoint the feminists though and becasue he'd defend his name so veraciously against the lies of the accusers family and the media, her organisation retaliated by charging Economu with harassment. This was of course complete bullshit and a form of harassment itself by the state. So a whole bunch of times and money was wasted (including yet more of Economu's) only for the case to be completely throw out for the sham it was: https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/r-v-economou.pdf

Now Economu is having his day in court and finally brining a defamation case, though you won't really find a word of it anywhere in the media and certainly not on the BBC or Guardian. The Daily Mail wrote one article shortly before the case, though not a very good one, and other than that there's literally nothing whatsoever: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3639414/Shipping-magnate-s-son-ex-girlfriend-accused-rape-killed-suing-father-libel.html

As an added bonus, the lawyer for the false accuser's family is Harriet Wistrich, the lesbian partner of the Guardian's leading misandirst Julie Bindel!

1087,"Wow, this has just been removed from r/ukpolitics the reason given as ""not politics"". Lets take a look at the facts shall we?

1. It's an article in Heat Street, a site headed by former Conservative politician Louise Mensch.

2. It's in the ""politics"" section of the site.

3. It concerns misconduct by the state broadcaster, an institution our politicians force the public to fund should they wish to watch live tv

4. Specifically the misconduct concerns Newsnight, a show with a particular focus on political matters.

5. The story in question concerns the BBC following a family of refugees. The influx of refugees into Europe from Syria is one of the major political stories of the year as is the Syrian war.

6. The misconduct related to covering up alleged sex crimes by Syrian refugees. This very scenario has been seen in major political scandals across Europe, most notably in Germany and Sweden.

7. Misconduct by Newsnight itself in covering up for BBC sex abusers itself was a major political scandal a couple of years ago. This appears to be a repeat of the same patterns.

8. Rape of young girls by Muslim men is also a major political scandal over the last few years, mostly notably in Rotherham right up to just today in Halifax: http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/crime/how-100-men-were-able-to-prey-on-one-vulnerable-halifax-schoolgirl-for-two-years-1-7969702

9. The article explicitly mentions ""the government’s refugee settlement"" and even includes a photo of David Cameron discussing said matter in the House of Commons of all places!

10. The main quote condemning the BBC's cover-up comes from a gentleman named Philip Davies, he's Conservative member of Parliament for Shipley.

So there you go, ten reasons this removal is completely wrong. How anyone can think this isn't politics is beyond me and I'm deeply concerned about what has happened here. This has extremely disturbing similarities with the r/news moderation scandal and we need an urgent explanation please.

I've also been subject to abuse here in the last 24 hours which the mods have also failed to act upon which makes my concerns even greater.

People have quite rightly urged people to wait for the truth to come out in this case and I applaud that. Using that same line of thought, Phillips has failed to provide evidence of a single message that has ever been sent to her and has been caught out lying and making extremely sexist remarks herself on multiple occasions.

A number of people have checked Phillips' feed for these supposed abusive messages only to fail to find any on all teh occasions she has claimed to have received them. All we know of with regards to Phillips is that 2 Nazis posted 2 short comments about her on an obscure voat forum. These were heavily downvoted and swiftly deleted and would have been almost impossible for Phillips herself to come across yet Phillips pretends they were sent to her directly on Twitter via men's rights activists.

The only other known comment in question is one by a high profile guy on Twitter who said he **wouldn't** rape her. I didn't really follow that cases so closely so I might be wrong but from what I can tell she pretended this was a rape threat.

She's a complete fraud and you shouldn't believe a single word she ever says. She invents abuse and then uses it as a tool to get out of situations where she's the one who behaved despicably and in a sexist manner, turning reality on its head.

There's also extremely disturbing behaviour by the CPS and presumably the rad fem Alison Saunders who runs it. For a start they refused to investigate the original complaint of false allegations and the victim has to spend a huge amount of money collecting evidence and basically make such an overwhelming case it forced the CPS to take action.

1. Gaming - the domestic abuse victim Twitter blocked by Baird was a gamer and well known steamer called Mahddog who regularly streams with the BBC's Kate Russell of tech tv programme ""Click"" (about the only BBC show relating to internet/tech culture and the biggest and longest running in the UK.

2. The controversy was covered by Allum Bokhari of Breitbart **tech** and made it to the top of KIA: https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3yp9qv/police_crime_commissioner_vera_baird_will_block/

3. The event ""Gamers4mankind came about as a result of the controversy. In this event a 12 our fund-raising stream was put together on Twitch, raising money for the Mankind Initiative, the UK's leading dv charity for male victims. This event primary featured Kate Russell and mahddog playing games, doing tech give-aways and discussing the plight of male victims of domestic violence. Again completely related to gaming/tech/nerd culture in every way imaginable: https://mydonate.bt.com/fundraisers/gamers4mankind

4. There's more than enough in points 1-3 but one can add all sort of other angles too - for example the PCC office having their corrupt antics exposed as a result of their tweets, the failure of the BBC to cover the scandal, the attempts to use tech to rig a poll. In fact even the posters themselves seem to only exist online.

Anyway please reinstate the post, and apologies if my justification for the post wasn't clear enough ( I guess I assumed everyone would remember the story seeing as there have been a good 4 or 5 posts about this in the past).

If you find some random mid-ranking BBC administrator, presenter, producer and even IT developer and look at their Twitter feed the type of people they follow then you get a great picture of their outlook. In my experience the overwhelming majority of BBC staff accounts look like this:

1. Some sort of obligatory Guardian news feed account, often multiple ones. Most notably there will always be more Guardian accounts followed then any other newspaper. Perhaps more than every other paper combined.
2. Multiple Guardian staff followed too, again far more than at any other paper. Perhaps more than every other paper combined.
3. The number of Labour politicians followed will out number any other party and will often be more than Tories, UKIP and Lib Dems combined.
4. If they're not Labour supporters, the politicians they follow instead will be Greens, or WEP or some obscure left party.
5. Any tweets or accounts followed concerning the EU, immigration etc will all be totally supportive.
6. Various fashionable and quite political organisation will also be seen, say Oxfam, feminist groups etc

Essentially what you get to see from these feeds is BBC staff trapped in their own echo chambers. Everyone gets their news from the Guardian, everyone has the same mindset and everyone supports Labour (or possibly the Greens if you're a rebel).

Don't even know why they're mentioning the education system, have they even looked at the figures for the gender education gap. Women massively outnumber men at university and the gap is STILL growing yet the advert implies girls are the ones who need help. Just the complete opposite of reality.

The part about transport was the only sensible part but plenty of others are saying the exact same things.

Ultimately I think it's notable that at least half the men they show in the video are abusers/harassers rather than actual people.

1559,"&gt; I think any discussion of color in the men's rights movement will be not just unhelpful but also damaging to us.

Nonsense, we care about everyone and and a number of men's rights issues disproportionately impact black men and particular black communities as a whole. Just look at fatherlessness and its absolutely devastating impact - the breakdown of communities featuring predominately black single mothers is about the best proof of the importance of fathers you could ever get.

In many ways I view our arguments as counter racist. Poverty certainly doesn't' explain what's going on in black communities in the states, as other communities are equally poor yet less violent . Racism and discrimination can no longer be used to fully explain problems either, particularly seeing as more recent black immigrants are more successful.

What's left therefore as a root cause is fatherlessness which is far greater in black communities than any other. Either our arguments are sound and fathers and families are incredibly important to kids and society as a whole, or the racists are right and black people are inferior. We've quite literally got the best arguments and evidence to **counter** racist views and if black lives matter people really cared then they'd start campaigning to get fathers involved with their kids instead of being racist and sexist themselves.",2016-04-06 16:18:24+00:00,d1s9ymp,2.0,t1_d1s56uv,6225.0,MensRights

1680,"You may recently heard of the plight of ManKind Initiative - the UK's leading charity supporting male victims of domestic violence. They are struggling to stay open and continue providing their valuable service to male victims of domestic violence in the UK. They get no money from the government whereas services for women get many millions.

The purpose of the 12 hour charity stream is to raise money and keep them going for as long as we can. As well as games there will be interviews with survivors and the people behind the charity and will be screening informational videos too.

If you can't donate cash then that's fine, Mankind also need those willing to donate skills and time to help them assist male victims. They are looking for help with graphic design, web design etc as well as people who are willing to give their time to man the phone line which is usually a victims first port of call.

Mankind uses the BT Donate service which ensures 100% of all donations go to the charity, and also allows UK residents who pay tax to use gift aid to increase their donations.

1758,"Be wary of Men’s Advice Line:
Screening and evaluation of male help-seekers is undertaken by the Men’s Advice Line (which is funded by the Scottish Government to provide helpline support for men experiencing domestic abuse in Scotland and run by the London-based organisation Respect) and, for example, the Dyn Project in Wales. These services impose screening because of the concern that abusers will pose as “victims” in order to misuse support systems and avoid taking responsibility for their abusive actions. Other services, in particular the AMIS Helpline and the Scottish Domestic Abuse Helpline which works with both men and women who experience domestic abuse, do not impose formal screening. It is thought that such formal screening to uncover perpetrators or those who are in fact in mutually abusive relationships is not applied to women in Scotland who approach services seeking help in relation to abuse by male partners but that it may be being applied to women in same-sex relationships. [Pg. 45] [Link]
On Men's Advice Line screening:
The justification that service has given for screening men is that it is a recommendation of the Respect organization which runs the Scottish Government funded Men’s Advice Line. While it is true that Respect advocates screening for men it also recommends exactly the same screening process for all persons who seek support, including women, and takes the view that it is not a “gender issue” thus making any decision to screen men but not women on the basis of Respect’s suggested good practice simply unsustainable. [Pg. 45-46]
It may label an abused man as a perpetrator:
Screening of men in same-sex relationships is now carried out with the same three categories previously applied only to “heterosexual” men (Nolan 2011). It is also striking that the “best” score a “heterosexual” man who had experienced domestic abuse could achieve was “no known history of abusive or violence incidents as either a victim or a perpetrator” and that to be labelled with a “known history of abusive or violence incidents” the man need only have been previously accused of abuse by his abusive partner to be denied an appropriate label. These problematic classifications continue to be used by the Project. Despite this, the Safer Wales currently (April 2013) has on its website the statement “The Dyn Wales helpline lets you speak confid entially to someone who can listen to you without judging your situation.” [Pg. 47]
Once a man has been labeled a perpetrator that's very, very hard to change and will likely receive little to no help, if not persecution. https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/46k8g1/it_fills_me_with_hope_that_we_are_starting_to_see/d05rbfi",2016-03-04 11:40:15+00:00,d0n8618,2.0,t1_d0n66cb,7767.0,ukpolitics

Ultimately I'd say just do your own research. Next time you stumble across some random BBC employee (preferably not a really famous one), just take a look at say their Twitter account for their opinions and see just how neutral their beliefs are. Better still, see exactly what news they favour and what's influencing them on a daily basis by looking at who they **choose** to follow. Nine times out of ten you'll find an abundance of Labour Party accounts and few Conservatives (other than perhaps a Conservative who's in power such as Cameron, Osbourne or a local MP). When I've done such checks I've not even come across many Lib Dems they follow either so it's very much a pro-Labour bias (and Green party and WEP Party) - they don't even like the more moderate and less authoritarian left. As fr or UKIP I don't think I've seen any member of BBC staff who I've suspected of bias who followed a UKIP account.

I'm not even sure the bias is always deliberate - they're just al trapped in their pro-Labour left wring Twitter bubbles where the only difference in opinion and decision to make is whether you support New Labour or the hard left of the party.

1796,"Kate Russell (the tech presenter on the BBC's ""Click"") and Mahd Dogg will be hosting a 12 hour fund-raiser for the Mankind initiative on Sunday 13th March and it's great to see gamers once again being on the right side of things and really helping out a really important charity. The event is called **""Gamers4Mankind""**

To put things into context, the charity serves the male domestic violence victims in a country of 60 million people on an annual budget **less** than the Patron donations of your typical anti-GG feminist SJW.

**The event page where you can donate is already live** and their target is £1,000. Note that every single penny goes to the charity and no commission is taken by anyone:  **YOU CAN DONATE HERE:** https://mydonate.bt.com/fundraisers/gamers4mankind

The video I linked to is a few weeks old now and were it not for the donations that came in last month  then the organisation would have closed down today - instead they get to survive for another month.

Disclaimer: I have no connection to the Mankind Initiative but i know them to be a genuine organisation which helps thousands of male victims of domestic violence for 15+ years. you've almost certainly seen their 2014 viral video about double standards when it comes to domestic violence which has almost **9 million** views: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3PgH86OyEM

Perhaps we can have a sticky or addition thread nearer the time of the event, though I just wanted to give a heads up and let people learn more about the situation ahead of time and before it's too late. I know threads like these asking for donations can get a little tiresome, but you really wont' find a more worthy charity and it's a scandal that the UK government will only give money to feminist organisations who's only real concern when it comes to men is male perpetrators of domestic violence.

Even if you can't donate you can still show your support and solidarity in other ways:

* If you're in the UK contact your local MP: http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/
* Follow the Mankind Initiative on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ManKindInit
* Share/mirror the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aa_kXjSsRag
* Consider volunteering for the organisation, here's what they need: http://new.mankind.org.uk/support-us/volunteers/

Thanks for reading this.

**Update:** It seems we could make a strong case for funding this organisation by comparing it's incredibly small budget to other things the UK government has chosen to spend the money on instead. Perhaps we could make a viral image giving a breakdown of what the £45K they need for the year bought instead? Perhaps message me if you have the skills to produce this.

2057,"Fantastic article, particularly the last paragraphs:

&gt;On the one hand, Phillips is continuously arguing that women can do the things men can while standing on their heads. Writing after her snub of International Men’s Day, she assured her critics of her support for both male and female issues: ‘I’m a woman, I can multitask.’ But, on the other hand, Phillips seems hell-bent on making out that women are in desperate need of a leg-up: ‘Being a man is its own reward. You hit the jackpot when you are born a boy child.’ She is torn between her desire to pass as a working-class, no-shit, strong woman, and her attraction to the feminist politics of equal opportunities and 50/50 representation. What she doesn’t realise is that the working-class women out there, who she believes she speaks for, don’t need half the room in parliament to be wearing skirts in order to feel like they can succeed in life. Watching Phillips continuously make the headlines for idiotic comments, however, could be enough to put some of us off.

&gt;This supposed woman of the people, this straight-talking mother of two, is, quite frankly, politically inept. Her views on women are reactionary, arguing that we need a leg-up and a helping hand in order to get anywhere in the world. But her most unattractive quality is her inability to stick to her guns. The minute she says something a bit off-colour, like her supposed snub of the significance of male suicide rates, she floods her Twitter feed with brown-nosed apologies. After the International Men’s Day debacle, Phillips seemed to, on the one hand, admit that men’s issues were important, while at the same time mocking men’s rights activists. What’s more, she trawled the internet for nasty things people had said about her, retweeting the alleged ‘threats’, only to insist that ‘It doesn’t make me feel scared… at all’. This cowardly flipflopping reveals that Jess Phillips can’t work out what she stands for. Is she pro-war or just anti-pissing people off? Is she a powerful woman or a victim of patriarchy? Does she like Corbyn or has she got metaphorically murderous intentions? In other words, does this woman stand for anything?

&gt;Be wary of the politician who blows with the wind, goes with the flow and occasionally makes the odd rude remark. Never trust somebody who gains credit for claiming to ‘speak for the people’ but spends all her time talking about herself. All of Phillips’ headline-grabbing and attention-seeking comments are cringe-worthy because there is no substance to them – nothing progressive to rally behind or new to celebrate. Sure, she doesn’t like the Tories, but that’s a basic requirement for all Labour politicians. Though she would like to claim otherwise, Phillips is just a younger, ruder version of the same-old boring Labour – pathetic in the face of criticism and totally lacking in ideas. In the end, the only reason Phillips is being celebrated is because she’s a mouthy woman. It’s as if the entire political class is just bowled over by a woman speaking her mind, despite the fact she’s making no sense. For all Phillips’ talk about male privilege, it’s her biology, not her brains, that everyone is interested in. ",2015-12-16 10:49:44+00:00,cy0vqfc,1.0,t3_3x2ad6,2592.0,MensRights

By all means switch party but don't assume all Conservatives are like Davies or that every other MP is a total write off. **It seems to DUP strongly supported his talk so they'd be fine to vote for I suppose as would those particular Conservatives who also supported him**. However, remember that when it comes to say shared parenting, the Conservatives have broken all their promises and are little better than Labour on men's issues overall.

There's certainly less feminists and feminist sympathisers on the right, but remember a lot of politicians will say anything to get into power. pandering to women and feminists gets votes from women and so they're also quite anti-male if it wins votes. If anything, being a fake feminist like that just to seize power is worse than being a genuine feminist.

Personally I'd only vote Conservative if knew the candidate was pro-equality but that's probably only 10% of the party at best. At a push it would be worth voting for a crap Conservative from the other 90% just to keep out someone as vile as Jess Phillips but that's the only reason.

Sorry but that line in particular is bullshit. Politicians go on and on about this myth (and also sorts of others related to gender) and put huge amounts of effort into ""tackling "" it.

In other words we live in a society where non existent discrimination against women is 100 times more important than real and blatant discrimination against men. Politicians rather ""solve"" an issue that doesn't' exist than actually help men.

Ultimately one of the key steps to helping men is to expose and debunk all the countless lies and myths that surround gender issues so people at least know the truth. Once we separate lies from the truth then maybe we can actually start solving issues.

A good example of this is domestic violence - men are only starting to get help now that we've debunked a lot of feminist myths about this issue (though there's still a huge amount of bullshtit out there - most of it spread entirely deliberately to ensure women get all the funding).

Giving links to helplines next to the article reduces any risk of copycats as does use of sensitive language - for example it's apparently considered taboo to use the term ""commits suicide"" as some think this implies the taking of your own life is a criminal act.

There's a reason why wives of wealthy men from all around the world try to come up with reasons why their divorce cases need to be heard in the UK, it's becasue our system is notoriously bad and easy to exploit by greedy women.

By all means give him a £50K salary for every year fulfilled that role, maybe with interest too, but unless he had an actual direct input into making the millions then I don't see why he's entitle to more than what his contribution was.

I agree that people shouldn't lie, but there's a real danger that we're encouraging people to target the wealthy, trick them into marriage and then basically steal huge sums of money from them.

* All five of the largest repayments ordered in the expense scandal involved Labour MPs
* 75% of those convicted of crimes in relation to the expenses scandal were Labour MPs. The only other were two Tory Peers. 
* Of the expense criminals, only three cases warranted sentences of over 12 months, all of which were Labour politicians. The most serious fraud of all was by Margaret Moran, again a Labour MP though she escaped justice but her crimes would have earned her the longest sentence of any of the expense criminals had she got what she deserved.
* And if you're bringing race into things, well 50% of Tories convicted were ethnic minorities and the most outrageous case in the Lords involved a Muslim Woman from Bangladesh.

2499,"**Here's the full article:**

The often troubled souls who make false accusations deserve our pity but should not escape the full force of the law

The death of Jay Cheshire is a desperate story. Seventeen years old, doing A levels, described as “vulnerable and sensitive”, he came under the sort of pressure which has sunk maturer men: he was accused of rape. The police investigation left him, his inquest was told, “distraught”. The allegations weren’t true, and the complainant later withdrew them. But soon after he took his own life.

No suicide has one simple cause. That most private act will always have an element of mystery, and it is dangerously simplistic to say anyone “drove them to it”. But there was an online outcry at Jay’s accuser. “Prosecute her! Name and shame, at least! Why should she get away with this?” The call goes up whenever careers, marriages and reputations are torpedoed by false accusations — because sexual allegations stick. Recent historical child abuse claims, taken up too keenly by police (as some of them now admit), have led the anguished innocent to spend shamefully long on bail. Lord McAlpine’s friends say that false accusations hastened his death last year. But you needn’t be high profile to be looked at askance, whispered about or shunned. People say, “no smoke without fire”, possibly the least truthful or helpful of proverbs. The experience is horrible, all the more so because there seems little chance of redress. A mugger or thief can cause less misery and yet be sharply punished.

There is some redress, though. Between 2009 and 2014 more than a hundred women were prosecuted for perverting the course of justice, or the lesser charge of wasting police time, and handful of them jailed.

But the charity Women Against Rape protests that genuine victims will be deterred from coming forward if they think that failure to prove an allegation could land them in the dock. Lisa Avalos, an American law professor, told MPs last year that the UK is more aggressive towards false accusers than the US, Canada and Australia. According to a British lawyer: “These cases seem to be pursued with a particular vehemence . . . it’s as though lying to the police, as they would see it, demands a really heavy reaction.” Despite that, an Australian criminologist warns that the failure to bring false accusers to justice in her country — even when their allegations have been followed the suicide of the accused — is “hugely problematic”.

We’re in the same boat. A recent report for the director of public prosecutions was full of hand-wringing about the need to treat all rape allegations seriously while promising “robust” action against liars. It illustrates the difficulty with the case of “Mrs A”. She accused her husband of rape, changed her mind and retracted. The Crown Prosecution Service carried on with the prosecution because “serious offences such as rape are not merely a private matter between the parties”. So Mrs A, who wanted it stopped, said she had lied in her original statements, and that he never did it. The case was dropped, but Mrs A found herself charged with perverting the course of justice with a false allegation. Whereon (one feels the panic) she said that it was true all along. The prosecution of the husband therefore resumed, while she too was charged, this time for falsely retracting a true allegation. Sentence: eight months reduced on appeal to a community order.

This tangle illustrates the difficulty of drawing a line between the private and sexual, and the public and legal. Our old-fashioned and prurient fascination with everything about sex has been combined with a new-fashioned culture of sexual laissez-faire. Now we add something very new, fed by the internet and the megaphone of media: an ever-growing addiction to self-dramatisation. The innate human urge to be admired and pitied, a brave victim in a dramatic situation, is running out of control.

To take a lesser example, consider the woman who claimed on Facebook, in spectacular detail, that when she was breastfeeding in a Primark store, a security guard snatched the infant (painfully) from her breast, saying, “If you want your baby back, follow me.” A complete fabrication, as she later admitted in court. Sentence adjourned, while they work out how nuts she is and, one hopes, what’s best for her child.

At least in that case no individual accused suffered. But in rape cases, even the official CPS guidance to prosecutors struggles to explain how to deal with false accusations. Perverting the course of justice is a serious crime carrying a potential life sentence. Given the emotional instability of many false accusers, that is taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Wasting police time is a lesser charge, but still carries a prison sentence of up to six months and/or a fine. Prosecutors, the CPS say, “should take care not to criminalise young complainants, particularly where the gravity of the situation has not been properly understood”.

But when, as in the case of Jay Cheshire, the police take no action at all against the false accuser there is a widespread sense of injustice. Many say that the media should at least be allowed to name her, so that others feel wary of making impetuous or vengeful accusations.

There are cases — rare but real — of serial false accusers protected for years by anonymity. Yes, they’re troubled souls, pitiable; but so is the person with an alcohol problem who gets behind the wheel of a car in an unfit state and maims somebody. And we give that driver no quarter. Even if they’re young and stupid.

2500,"&gt; I think the vast majority of parents who opt for the procedure do it for one of two reasons: religious ones or ones related to social conformity

The evidence suggests the social norm they're conforming to originally came about due to attempts to reduce male pleasure. I.e. it is the norm to reduce male pleasure and to conform with mutilation to achieve this. The direct motive of the parents might not be to reduce pleasure, but only becasue reducing male please through genital mutilation is the norm in their society and thus they don't know any better.

3. End sexist reporting which uses terms such as ""relationship"" (or also uses comedy when it's an adult male).
4. Try to get the police to pro-actively look for and arrest such offenders. For example, the most notorious female paedophile gangs have only been caught thanks to a sole male member, so it seems we're just not really looking for female offenders.
5. A high profile advertising campaign would help. We already have countless posters for issues that almost everyone in society accepts as wrong, yet I the likes of the NSPCC never seem to show female sex offenders (and they're even reluctant to feature a proportionate number of female committing violence against kids).
6. More help for male victims (for example rape crisis refuses to help male rape victims).
7. End prison rape jokes and the idea that getting raped is part of the sentence for men convicted of crimes.
8. Help for related issues, e.g. a male raped by his wife/parter might need a domestic violence shelter, yet we're still not really providing any for men.

As with Labour, most Tories are career politicians instead of conviction politicians and will just say what they think needs to be said to get into power. Right now that means saying PC, radical feminist and pro-multicultural and pro-Islamic statements. The only concept that's actually now up for debate with the Tories is the EU.

2679,"My rebuttal of this article that I posed elsewhere:

I don't know much at all about Scottish politics, but I have read extensively on Rumbles and his past work concerning domestic violence.

The facts are that Rumbles forced the Scottish Parliament to debate the issue of violence against men, just as they had previously debated violence against women (note that we're not fortunate enough to have a Rumbles-type figure in the UK Parliament and therefore are still yet to have the violence against men debate there). It took Rumbles some ELEVEN years of campaigning for the debate to happen and clearly there was massive resistance to his work

It's clear from his performance in the debate (and the fact hat he initiated it) that Rumbles is very firmly on the side of gender equality and simply wants to help all victims of domestic violence rather than just half the population. If campaigning to help all such victims makes you ""anti-feminist"" than surely most of the UK population fit that definition too.

I read through the entire violence against men debate and the only sexism and offensive comments came from Labour and to a lesser extent the SNP, with other Lib Dems and a Conservative siding with Rumbles. Labour even tried to introduce amendments to the debate which were clearly total fabrications and their lies were exposed for all to see. The lies in question were put forward put Johann Lamont who went on to become Labour leader! She even dared to suggested that male victims of domestic violence were lying about being abused.

I wasn't aware that the debate had caused a rift afterwards, but if standing up for all victims of domestic violence rather than a only a privileged subset of victims causes such a problem then Labour are clearly an extremely unpleasant party in Scotland and not someone the Lib Dems should be working with. It's surely far better to stand up for equality and what you believe in than worry about offending a coalition partner with differing and seemingly hateful views (not to mention blatant lies).

Even after Rumbles' work, the Scottish situation was such that for every pound spent on male victims there was £3,500 spent on females!

2691,"I don't know much at all about Scottish politics, but I have read extensively on Rumbles and his past work concerning domestic violence.

The facts are that Rumbles forced the Scottish Parliament to debate the issue of violence against men, just as they had previously debated violence against women (note that we're not fortunate enough to have a Rumbles-type figure in the UK Parliament and therefore are still yet to have the violence against men debate there). It took Rumbles some ELEVEN years of campaigning for the debate to happen and clearly there was massive resistance to his work

It's clear from his performance in the debate (and the fact hat he initiated it) that Rumbles is very firmly on the side of gender equality and simply wants to help all victims of domestic violence rather than just half the population. If campaigning to help all such victims makes you ""anti-feminist"" than surely most of the UK population fit that definition too.

I read through the entire violence against men debate and the only sexism and offensive comments came from Labour and to a lesser extent the SNP, with other Lib Dems and a Conservative siding with Rumbles. Labour even tried to introduce amendments to the debate which were clearly total fabrications and their lies were exposed for all to see. The lies in question were put forward put Johann Lamont who went on to become Labour leader! She even dared to suggested that male victims of domestic violence were lying about being abused.

I wasn't aware that the debate had caused a rift afterwards, but if standing up for all victims of domestic violence rather than a only a privileged subset of victims causes such a problem then Labour are clearly an extremely unpleasant party in Scotland and not someone the Lib Dems should be working with. It's surely far better to stand up for equality and what you believe in than worry about offending a coalition partner with differing and seemingly hateful views (not to mention blatant lies).

Even after Rumbles' work, the Scottish situation was such that for every pound spent on male victims there was £3,500 spent on females!

That's true and mental health may have been one factor here, but I object to this statement on its own - it's now standard response to these cases and pretending that mental health care is the main issue is used to gloss over the abuse men face in our society.

This guy was denied access to his kids, and in most cases these denials of contact are quite clearly wrong. He killed himself in prison, where he had already been subject to violence and it's highly doubtful that he should have even been there in the first place.

If we allow men to be mistreated again and again, and then imprison them for highlighting such abuses (where the abuse continues) then inevitably some will reach breaking point, regardless of whatever mental health care is available.

One particular interesting part of the article:

""Carla added: ""No-one tried to stop me hitting him – I think that is because of Ashley’s bad karma.

I did it for my sister. Ashley has caused her a lot of issues.""

The format of the manifesto is chronological - i.e. it deals with foetuses, then babies, then children and then adults.
