He was right. Attractive women have a million guys throwing themselves at them; they'll never make the first move for a guy.

397,"I need help with a new hairstyle please. Up until now, I've had a messy fauxhawk. My style still works right now, but I just turned 31 and I need to find something new and more mature before I start to look like a jackass. It works for several reasons:

1. I'm Asian and look like I'm 24. 

2. It's low-maintenance. I don't like to do my hair from Mon-Fri when I'm in the office, mostly out of convenience. The relatively short length of hair that my fauxhawk requires means that I look pretty neat when I don't do my hair. It's also really easy to do my hair when I need to.

I've been trying the undercut+side part thing for the past several weeks because it seemed like a logical transition for me; I used to ask for a skin fade and a light trim on the top when I did the fauxhawk. However, I find the longer hair on the top to be kinda annoying when my hair isn't done because it keeps touching my forehead. It's also caused a small, albeit manageable, amount of acne. Lastly, I fear the whole undercut thing may be a passing trend and I don't want to hop on the bandwagon on the tail end of this thing and look like I'm outdated in a year or two.

No if your landlord wants to come into your home to make non-emergency repairs, or to show or inspect the apartment, she must give you ""reasonable notice"" normally, this means at least 24 hours notice Your landlord can come in only at ""reasonable times"" generally, this means during the daytime or evening, not in the middle of the night There may be other factors that make certain times ""unreasonable"" for you Exception: If there is an emergency, your landlord can enter after a shorter notice or without notice For example, the pipes burst or there is a fire in your apartment What can I do if my landlord comes in without giving me reasonable notice? If your landlord does not follow these rules, or if your landlord tries to comes in without good reason to the point you feel harassed, you can sue your landlord the judge can order your landlord to pay you for your ""actual damages"" or $10000, whichever is more She can also order the landlord to stop coming into your apartment without good reason and without fair notice If you have a lawyer and you win a hearing, the court can also order your landlord to pay your lawyer fees If you cannot get a lawyer and if you need fast protection from serious, repeated harassment, you can file a Protection from Harassment complaint in District Court Is it legal to change the locks to keep my landlord out? No  If you need to change the locks for any reason, you must notify your landlord also, you must give him a key within 48 hours of the change victims of domestic violence, sexual violence or stalking who need to change the locks for safety reasons have 72 hours to provide a new key to the landlord Your landlord may give you a 7 day eviction notice if you change the locks without following these rules  (Read more about evictions)  He can also charge you for any damage caused if he needs to enter in an emergency and is locked out",2016-05-10 23:44:29+00:00,d30mvpp,1.0,t3_4is378,973.0,orangecounty

He took the squirrel and froze it in his dorm room refrigerator for about a week.

But I understand IP addresses to be just a series of numbers assigned to computing devices, like a router. You equated it to a mailing address.

921,"I'm having a bit of trouble wrapping my head around sizing down to account for stretch. 

Do jeans always stretch, whether they initially fit loose or tight? My understanding is that, if you prefer for your jeans to be pretty fitted/slim, then you should account for eventual stretch and therefore size down. However, if you were to buy your jeans with a little more room, stretch shouldn't really be a problem, so you might as well buy your normal size.

931,"When I was about 8 or 9, I had ""The Rocketeer"" for the SNES. Someone who knew nothing about video games must've given it to me because I never would've picked that piece of shit game out on my own.


The Rocketeer was based on the movie of the same name. I didn't watch the movie, but it was basically some action movie starring some dude that has a jetpack. I guess the protagonist of the movie is a pilot or some shit, so the first level of the game is actually a prologue of sorts, where you fly a plane around this course and race two other planes. You have to beat it to advance to the actual gameplay, where you play as the rocketeer in his rocket suit and fight bad guys. When I was playing this as an 8-year old, I just could not beat this stupid piece of shit level and finally ragequit this fucking game, leaving me to live out the actual gameplay vicariously through the pictures on the back of the box.


I forgot about the game until years later (probably when I was about 13 or 14) and decided on a whim that I'd revisit this game. I was now considerably older and had the maturity of an adolescent and surely I'd be able to get past the first level and experience the actual gameplay of the game. NOPENOPENOPE I still couldn't beat the piece of shit. 


This was before the days of the internet, so I was left wondering for years whether my struggle was because I was a worthless piece of shit or because the game just sucked. After years of struggling with my inadequacy, I finally looked the game up on Youtube and found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv0oWY7pJr0) and experienced validation for the first time in over a decade. I don't even know where the cartridge is anymore, but I'm convinced that I still couldn't beat that first level today, at 30 years old.",2015-08-08 00:43:26+00:00,ctvg87f,1.0,t3_3g5jk2,24571.0,AskReddit

963,"Hey guys,

Just wanted to get some opinions on how dumb a purchase would be. I'm new to this sub, so if this isn't the thread for it, please let me know.


**My situation:**
I'm 30 years old, single, completely debt-free (no student loans, cc debt, car payments, etc.), and I make a respectable salary (between $150k-$200k). However, I'm pretty money-stupid when it comes to things like investing and having your money work for you. To the extent that I'm financially independent, I owe it all to hard work, luck, and circumstance. In terms of working towards retirement, I just max out my 401k and IRA every year and do nothing else with the rest of my savings (it just sits in my bank account).


**Dilemma:**
I've wanted a particular car since I was in high school and was always too responsible to make the plunge. This car now costs about $30k. On the one hand, I just really really really want this car and I can afford it. On the other hand, from a practical and financial perspective, it'd be completely idiotic to own a car like this: my current car is paid off and reliable; this ""new"" car (it'd be about ten years old) would actually be less reliable, less practical (it's a sports car), and cost a considerable amount in annual maintenance (BMW); and I rent my apt and the money could go towards a house/the market/appreciating asset.


**Question:**
I'm really on the verge of pulling the trigger on this car, but I've always been so responsible that dropping $30k at once on an unnecessary luxury has me kinda shook. I guess I'm just here to confer with a bunch of people who are probably much more knowledgable and responsible than I am to either tell me to get the car and live a little, or talk me out of making a costly mistake.

1045,"Imagine if you borrowed cookies from a bunch of people and they started asking for repayment of their cookies. If you didn't have enough cookies to repay all of the loans, your cookie creditors would begin fighting for who deserves to get paid first. Thus, the bigger kids (i.e. creditors with more leverage) might start strongarming the smaller kids (i.e. creditors with less leverage) in order to make sure they get paid, even though they might be less entitled to repayment than the smaller kids. Thus, you'd file for bankruptcy.

Bankruptcy is like going to your teacher (i.e. a judge) who imposes a timeout (known as an ""automatic stay"" in legal terms) on everyone so she can sort through the mess in an organized and fair manner. Each kid will make their argument as to why they deserve to get paid before the other kids (e.g. I made my loan first, so I deserve to get paid first), and the teacher (i.e. the judge) will dole out the payments accordingly.

There's also a special type of bankruptcy called reorganization. Imagine if you had an Easy Bake Oven and you'd be able to repay all your cookie loansharks if they would just give you a little time to make some cookies. However, several of them don't want to wait and just want to take your Easy Bake Oven because you couldn't pay them in time. You might also be able to repay everyone if you had time to sell off your failed Lego venture in order to focus on baking more cookies. Reorganization would basically buy you time so that you could bake your cookies (i.e. restructure your company).",2015-07-13 19:19:39+00:00,ct214ri,1.0,t3_3d502m,12111.0,explainlikeimfive

I have a lot of friends back home that ask me how I've liked my year in OC so far and, as a city person, I liken it like this:

I'm not a fan of SUVs, and given the choice, I'll generally pick a car over an SUV because of inherent qualities that an SUV just can't offer (e.g. more nimble, faster, lower to the ground, etc.).

I'll always prefer living in a city, but the past year in Orange County has been hard to hate. There's a ton of stuff to do, you're close to beaches, the food's awesome, you're close to LA and SD, the weather's great, and the women are really really good looking.

Ultimately, I'm not completely sold and I haven't decided whether I plan to settle down in these parts, but I've definitely enjoyed the ride thus far.

1144,"Lawyer. Better Call Saul is surprisingly accurate; there's a huge disparity between the handful that are rolling in dough (e.g. the lawyers at Hamlin Hamlin and McGill) and everyone else (e.g. Saul).

1146,"This'll probably get buried, but, in my freshman year, there was a dude on my floor that I'm convinced was psychotic.

I remember seeing a dead squirrel in the courtyard outside of our dorm building; I ignored it like any normal person. About a week later, someone had taken the squirrel, tied a little noose around it, and ""hanged"" it from the ceiling of our elevator, complete with a fake suicide note about how there weren't enough nuts to go around. Apparently, the psycho had been keeping the squirrel in his dorm fridge for a week.",2015-06-19 06:54:12+00:00,csbmv0z,1.0,t3_3acbek,28014.0,AskReddit

1153,"There's an old cult classic called ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" with a scene of a helicopter crashing. The crash was actually a blooper, and the crew really did accidentally destroy an expensive helicopter in a fiery crash, so they worked it into the movie since it was all caught on film anyways (the pilot lived).

The rest of the movie's pretty hilarious in a B-movie sorta way as well.",2015-06-17 00:30:22+00:00,cs90esi,1.0,t3_3a3rak,856.0,AskReddit
