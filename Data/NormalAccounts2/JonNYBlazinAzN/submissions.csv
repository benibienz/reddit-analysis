I live in CA and bought a car in NY from a private seller. The car is sitting in a relative's garage until I arrange for shipping.

I'd like to take my parents on a trip to Peru (specifically to see Machu Picchu), but my mom doesn't want to go because she gets pretty bad altitude sickness. We have family in Colorado and we've taken trips to high-altitude areas like Aspen and Vail. She gets miserably sick; headaches, throwing up, the whole shebang. I looked it up and Machu Picchu shares the same altitude as Aspen/Vail (about 8000 feet above sea level). Is there anything that can be done about this?

Sorry if this thread is in the wrong spot. I recently bought this watch off Jomashop and I noticed that the lume on the watch is so dim that it's virtually useless. You can just barely see it when it's dark, as if the lume is completely worn out. I tried doing some Googling and there's some mention of the fact that the lume is really dim on other forums/reviews, but it's hard to really ascertain just how dim it's supposed to be. 

I'm considering exchanging the watch if the defect is just specific to my watch, but don't want to go through the trouble if this is just a problem with this model, especially since Jomashop screws you on the return shipping if they don't find a defect.

Anyone with experience with the lume for these watches? Thanks!",Watches,[Question] Citizen AT8020-03l Blue Angels World Chronograph: Dim lume?,http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/3cp1n1/question_citizen_at802003l_blue_angels_world/
