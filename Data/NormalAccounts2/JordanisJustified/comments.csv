147,"&gt;That's not really wasted-MAX suits can easily change loadouts.

This is true, but then you also need to consider that a MAX is a very hard unit to move from base to base(Requires transport which is + nanites), and requires support from infantry to truly be effective.  
&amp;nbsp;

I guess what I am trying to say is that it is too easy for a pilot to disengage from a ground threat on live currently to easily implement such a sweeping change like the OP's flare mechanics.  

Another thing to consider is that the air game (Although one of my favorite aspects of the game) isn't a top priority to keep the lights on at DBG.  
&amp;nbsp;

At then end of the day, it is a business and the Devs don't (And can't!) work for free, so resources need to allocated to aspects of the game to ensure the continuation of funding.
It would be all well and good for the Dev's to spend a month or so fixing the air game, only to then loose the game entirely as they cannot sustain the remuneration for the team.  
&amp;nbsp;

I hope that one day they can address the air game, but at this point I understand why they cant.

149,"Believe me, as a skyknight myself I agree.  
Unfortunately its a lot harder to balance as its never always going to be a 1v1 scenario.

One of the biggest issues to consider when implementing change into planetside is that everything needs to scale up and down.

For example - If this change to flares was to go live, G2A locks would become redundant if the pilot was running flares. 

In small fights (1-12) it would be un-economical for a single person to pull a AA Max or Skyguard, as the pilot can simply move away from the hex - Therefore wasting 300-450 nanites for the defenders.

With G2A launchers there is no nanite cost, therefore allowing a single infantry to repel Aircraft to a degree without using up half their resources.

Don't get me wrong, I think flares need to be reworked or AA missiles to be changed, I just don't think its going to be an easy thing to balance.

[I will link it here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3fUok2AoaU)


Something that helped me with this is the following rule;

When rounding a corner and there is an enemy looking straight at you, disengage and re-peak the corner.

This helps push the clientside hit detection to your favor, as they probably saw you first on their screen therefore they started damaging you first (Even if they aren't firing in your screen yet) - This is also why you die behind cover sometimes when you are running away.
 

Another good rule is to break engagement if they get the first shot on you (Unless you are confident in your aim and know where they are)
