-banning a religion from entering the country (another actual attack on free speech far beyond what any of those evil SJWs promote)

-warmonger, he's even more hawkish than Hillary, and while Obama's administration might not be as careful with collateral damage as it could be, Trump claiming he wants to ""target families"" is on a whole different level.

-corporatist, his tax plan includes enormous cuts to the taxes on the super wealthy, who've already funneled most of the wealth away from the middle class in recent decades

-nepotism, when asked about what females he'd appoint to his cabinet he suggested his daughter, and has recently promised his friend (a lawyer of about 7 months) a supreme court seat.

Not to mention Marvel almost never reuses main themes from movie to movie like Harry Potter, Star Wars, and James Bond have.

Also ""Marvel"" encompasses an entire genre to most people, asking someone to recall a theme from ""a marvel movie"" would be like asking someone to recall a theme from ""a cowboy movie"" or ""a space movie"". And even for people who know the difference between Marvel and DC (small number) that's 40+ marvel movies and nearly 20 franchises and even the people who are aware of the difference between the different branches of marvel in movies (even fewer people) Marvel Studios alone still encompasses 7 franchises and each of those franchises' sequels use different themes for each film.

Oh and this video's sole example of how they could use music to take more risk and be emotional was dreadful, turned a sweet, funny scene into an outright stupid scene, unnoticed background music definitely has it's place in movies, and for all this video's implications about the lack of originality of the Marvel movie music it didn't give a single example of unoriginal, or unfitting music outside of background music for lighthearted, laid back scenes.

Actually listen to the main themes from Thor, Thor 2, Captain America TFA, Avengers, Iron Man 3, Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-man, etc. etc. and you'll hear themes that are catchy, memorable, and emotional, but due to the nature of Marvel's movie making process they will either never be as memorable as star wars or James Bond (pretty high bar btw) or they will at least take a long time to really ingrain themselves into the cultural zeitgeist.

But how about we wait to really judge how well any one Marvel franchise's theme has impacted us until even one of these franchises gets more than 3 movies (star wars has had 7, Harry Potter 9, James Bond 20+?)

Dude, every major DC headliner got a new #1 last month, this is as good as it'll get, and Marvel releasing more titles doesn't mean they automatically get more sales, if anything that influx of titles had a lot of people worried about market saturation, which obviously didn't happen.

There is no excuses here, DC's first month of it's big relaunch got trounced by the ~9th month if Marvel's. DC is never getting the market share back and is probably gonna nose dive in the coming months.

You wanna know why? It's because while DC doubles down on ""superhero comics"" Marvel diversifies its line up with books that would seem to be more befitting of an independent publisher, focusing on creativity, and inclusiveness by openly challenging the tropes and stereotypes DC embraces.

Just look at their big twists that happened recently, the introductory issue of DC's rebirth had comic book fans a buzz about the reveal of Wally West's return! Meanwhile Captain America's startling revelation not only lit a fire in the comic community, but blew up social media and enlicited passionate responses from people who'd of maybe never read a comic in their life.

Point is DC needs to reach more markets, they spend too much time placating fans and too little making inroads with religious and minority groups along with women. And because of this DC is always going lag behind Marvel comics just as much as they do in movies.",2016-07-09 03:26:24+00:00,d555n4x,3.0,t1_d54gyxq,37353.0,comicbooks

2. His top speed is far, far beyond that, call his near/above lightspeed feats outliers, but there has been enough of them to mean he can definitely go at near light speed if he really wants to. He's Marvel's premiere speedster for god's sake.

It can't be helped, but it still detracts from that interpretation of the character regardless.

He really isn't a second rate Flash, he's a complicated compelling character with relationships and stories you can invest in, and aspects of his powers that make him unique from the Flash.

For all intents and purposes they are just as fast within the contexts of their stories and Quicksilver having a lower top speed does nothing to make him second rate or less interesting of a character.",2016-06-27 05:38:49+00:00,d4piwpc,3.0,t1_d4pg30d,5422.0,Marvel

1. He's super strong, like Thing/Namor levels of strong, like punch Hulk and send him flying strong, yet here Hawkeye can step on his leg and immobilize the guy, 

2. He's way faster, near light speed and even faster than the X-men movie version, yet he can't outrun bullets, or even come close to reacting to them here.

3. He's supposed to be always sped up at least a little bit, maybe his mind isn't always functioning at full near light speed levels, but the guy is mean and frustrated because he's always at least a good deal faster than anyone else, even when he isn't actively using his powers, so his demeanor and his failure to react to that bullet from below shouldn't happen.

4. And this is a problem for the rules even the movie made for him, he's supposed to have a healing factor, Maria Hill even mentions it as ""increased homeo stasis"" but do they ever show it? Even after his first, minor bullet wound he got while fighting Ultron in Sokovia? Nope.

All that is ignoring the stuff they got wrong about his back story, and even if it's for legal reasons, it's still a problem to me Magneto isn't his father, he wasn't apart of the Brotherhood, and he isn't a mutant. Also his personality is pretty wrong, but I kind of covered that in point 3.

We've got 2 versions of Quicksilver in movies already and both of them are bad, and the better of the 2 isn't even in the Marvel movie universe. Quicksilver is a great character, but with the way they've treated him, its like they want him to be looked at as a second rate Flash, which he absolutely isn't.",2016-06-27 00:57:18+00:00,d4p8tpr,1.0,t3_4pwv21,60320.0,Marvel

617,"Oh definitely, but the controversy being created by Marvel's move is permeating a lot of mainstream culture in a way rebirth isn't, both are good books but the ruckus Captain America is causing means good things for Marvel, and the comic book industry as a whole.

Could you imagine if news outlets and social media grabbed on to comic twists like this more often? That's how these books become mainstream. That's how comicbooks regain their foothold on American culture, as much as I like Rebirth, that book is hugely symptomatic of the problems plaguing the comic industry. It's a comic written for comic readers and comic readers only, something marvel has been moving away from quickly. It gives new readers very little to mentally grab onto aside from bright colors and flashy powers.

Think about it this way, does the average person even know the difference between Barry Allen and Wally West? Much less are they as concerned with Wally's exclusion from the New 52 as we are? Not at all. 

But Hydra and Captain America are both hot in people's minds, Hydra has had a reoccurring role as villains in Marvel movies, cartoons, tv shows, video games, and even memes consistently over the past 6 or 7 years, Hydra might as well be synonymous with evil right now in the cultural zeitgeist (a perfect representation too considering our society's current anxiety over evil overlords with ulterior motives). And all the while Captain America has represented the opposite for people, while Batman and Superman have turned grim and hateful, Captain America has solidified himself as an icon of traditional heroism and selflessness. He's a guy who'd make the ultimate sacrifice, not just to save the world like in the First Avenger, but for something as personal as a friend, like at the end of Winter Soldier and all through Civil War.

Him turning out to be Hydra is deeply unsettling, not just to people who have been reading the comics, but anyone with even the most tacit connection to the current cultural zeitgeist.

717,"DC comic series with females characters, either running now or usually ongoing: Wonder Woman, Supergirl, Batgirl, Black Canary, Harley Quinn, Birds of Prey (+teen titans and justice league for the female presence in those books) 

For TV shows DC has the old Wonder Woman show and Supergirl.

For film DC has unfortunate Supergirl and Catwoman movies as well as Catwoman playing an important role in at least a couple Batman movies.

Marvel has series for: Black Widow, She-Hulk, Jessica Jones, Scarlet Witch, Captain Marvel, Ms. Marvel, Mockingbird, Angela, Hellcat, Squirrel Girl, Kate Bishop Hawkeye (tho she shares it almost 50/50 with Clint) Spider-Woman, Spider-Gwen, Silk, Storm, X-23, fem-Thor, you've also got the team book A-force with an all female cast(Medusa, She-Hulk, Dazzler) (+Avengers, Runaways, Young Avengers, Inhumans, X-men, X-force, Guardians of the Galaxy, Fantastic Four, and now Web Warriors which all also have a consistent female presence)

For TV Marvel has Agent Carter and Jessica Jones and most of the leads on Agents of SHIELD are female characters (Quake, Mockingbird, and Melinda May)

For Film Marvel had an ill fated Elektra film, but have had Scarlet Witch, Black Widow, Storm, Mystique, Invisible Woman, and Gamora play important roles in Avengers, X-men, Fantastic Four, and Guardians of the Galaxy movies.

I'd say it's close to even in live action, but I think the overall presence of Marvel in the theaters edges DC out 

Comics wise DC has traditionally been more consistent, but only with 1 book, but Marvel has traditionally had a larger female presence in team up books, but right now DC doesn't even have a quarter of the female led titles Marvel has, and with Marvel's recent push for more female characters, I don't see that changing without DC having a line change up on a scale a lot bigger than their upcoming rebirth. 

In conclusion I'd say right now in comics Marvel is outpacing DC with female characters big time, but traditionally they are pretty even.

And with live action it's closer, but the massive presence of Marvel characters makes it hard to say DC could really tie them. Suicide Squad, Wonder Woman, and a Harley Quinn picture could even the odds or even put them ahead, but you have to remember we have a variety of  female oriented Marvel pictures coming as well, such as Guardians (Mantis, and Gamora returning) Captain Marvel, Avengers 3, Inhumans(Crystal, Medusa), X-force/New Mutants (Magik, Karma, Wolfsbane) etc.",2016-05-18 20:43:16+00:00,d3aq1rm,4.0,t1_d3ao028,2468.0,movies

740,"Watchmen is a great book and an amazing story, but if you really like superheroes you have to kind of disagree with it on a fundamental level that Zack Snyder doesn't.

Watchmen basically supposes that if superheroes existed in the world, everything would essentially go to shit, they'd all be plagued with problems so horrible they'd be consumed by them and cause chaos in one form or another.

I think that's wrong because the implications of that are incredibly dark for humanity, it's basically saying that no matter what heights we ascend to, we'll always be awful despicable creatures, that we'll never overcome those personal failings.

That's why I like Marvel so much personally, their heroes aren't near-perfect like DC's, but they also don't let their problems consume them like Watchmen. They have personality defects, behavioral problems, and legitimate failings, but they never stop trying to do good in spite of those failings.

People wonder why Marvel has taken a hold of the cultural zeitgeist like it has, well look no farther.

Actually the view count is around the same as Ant-man's and I know this is a big pet project of Feige's, that combined with the impeccable cast and generally consistent quality of Marvel Studios leads me to believe it's highly unlikely this movie could flat out bomb.

4. WB has decided to differentiate the DC properties is by making them superficially more ""adult"" which has led to this faux-superiority complex from fans over the ""maturity"" of their films

&gt;Captain America is not a new franchise. It's the third one in a series that has had a successful theatrical run. So shitty reviews for Batman v Superman probably won't affect it.

Superman and Batman are sort of an industry standard for superhero culture, they have been the definitive superheroes for generations, so it stands to reason that when they bore people or make them feel ""fatigued"" those same people could lose enthusiasm for superhero stuff as a whole.

Marvel changed superheroes from paragons, ideals, epitomization of good and right to people with abilities who struggle with real world problems, Kirby and Starlin's Marvel work changed how millions of people viewed sci-fi then and even now.

The fact that you seem so ardent in this belief that DC is the originators and Marvel is the copiers is kind of funny considering how much the opposite is also true.

I kind of get why people think me having a preference for marvel is ""bias"" now, it's because of brand loyalists like you who are weirdly willing to ignore something like ""copying"" when DC does it, but at the same time crucify Marvel for it in an attempt to maintain a narrative of one being creatively bereft.

Just because Marvel outpaces DC enormously on street level characters thanks to freaking Batman being the sole focus point to all of DC's street characters, that doesn't mean Marvel is lagging on the cosmic side 

DC only really has 2 and a half cosmic focal points, and they'd be Legion of superheroes, Green Lantern and Superman (Martian Manhunter is virutally always a supporting character).

&gt; Sex is not evil, sexy women are not evil, butts are not evil. But they have been a huge factor in how women have been portrayed in comics for the better part of their history, and it is time for us to start downplaying them a bit. 

Couldn't disagree more, there simply isn't a good reason to make artists downplay sexuality in their art. If anything it needs to be celebrated more, nudity and sexuality are far too censored in American media, this is what needs to change.

The female form has been a staple of art since art was a thing, and artists should be encouraged to enthusiastically translate the human form to page all they want, and this goes for the male and female body, and is anyone really gonna deny the male form isn't also celebrated in comics constantly?

Making sex and sexuality a negative thing that should be hidden is exactly the sort of Victorian puritanical thinking that actually does a lot more to oppress women than most people realize.

It's a great story, don't get me wrong. And the character work is excellent, but if you think for a second Alan Moore's hardcore liberalism and hatred of silver age superheroes doesn't bleed through every page, from Rorsach (batman) being a cartoonish republican caricature to Comedian (nick fury, captain america) being a rapist murderer, to Dr Manhattan (superman or other powered heroes) having a blatant disregard for human life, then you're kidding yourself.

I honestly think those biases get in the way of letting him see the good side of superheroes, the entire mythos of the Marvel universe has a more balanced view of stuff like that in my opinion, sure Captain America can be stubborn and self righteous, Iron Man is a drunk selfish egotist, and the Hulk can be incredibly dangerous and horrible in the wrong circumstances, but they never stop trying to do good, they never ignore their mistakes and take it out on the world, and when one of them slips up, their friends are their to pick up the pieces and none of them ever stop trying to *do good*.

Watchmen paints a picture of heroes with problems who let those problems rule their existence, and that's something no functioning person should let happen to them, and it wouldn't be something someone who considers themselves a hero should ever do, that's how you become a villain.

Also bare in mind Alan Moore was an enormous fan of Stan Lee's work in the 60s and says himself Stan inspired his writing career. And thats what Watchmen essentially was, a manifestation of the pessimistic attitude he had toward his childhood indulgences. He's on the record saying the thinks Stan Lee wasn't even a good writer. YET THE GUY WAS INSPIRATION FOR HIM AND MILLIONS OF OTHER WRITERS AND CREATIVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SHAPED POPULAR CULTURE EVER SINCE!

1111,"The tone of Marvel studios films are exceptionally more varied than the Fox X-films (baring Deadpool). 

Every superhero movie in general usually follows a simular formula, if anything this is once again an area where Marvel studios does a *better* job than it's contemporaries.

I also never said fun and humor makes a movie good and dark grittiness makes it bad. But even the darkest movies usually have a sense of humor and fun, your example the Dark Knight had periods of snappy dialogue and great humor, it also had fun with a lot of the action scenes, mainly the ones with the tumbler.

You seem to have fallen into the /r/movies circle jerk started by uber salty DC fans that Marvel studios films are all generic or too formulaic or some such shit. The only people who normally concern themeselves with those things usually have those complaints about super hero movies as a concept in general, if anything Marvelstudios does more to circumvent those tropes than anyone else making these sort of movies.

And also bare in mind the Marvel studios movies have become the highest grossing franchise in movie history in just 8 years. In 8 years we've gotten 12 (soon to be 13) blockbuster hits all with good to great critical reception and all with spectacular audience reception. This is a one of a kind movie franchise, nothing in cinema has come close to this level of consistent success aside from maybe Pixar, and they even fell from glory earlier than Marvel did. 

All that being said, it's a damn miracle the studio is even close to willing to change anything about the formula or tone of the movies, yet in the same year we get Guardians of the Galaxy and Winter Soldier, followed the next year by Age of Ultron and Ant-man, followed by Civil War and Doctor Strange. Marvel Studios is redefining the marvel brand once again as the ""House of Ideas"" in a way no one has since Stan Lee and Jack Kirby and with what is looking to have twice the social impact. 

If you would rather the X-men be beholden to the cynical, uncreative, and limiting hand of Fox studios, you must not like the X-men all that much.

That being said, as a huge Marvel fan  more than happy to get more movies featuring Marvel characters every year being produced by several studios, but I still think the characters are the best back at home.",2016-04-26 14:02:20+00:00,d2hwjkb,3.0,t1_d2hlj4d,30490.0,Marvel

1212,"Top 2 franchises were easily Spider-man and the X-men.

Close to that were Hulk and Fantastic Four (if you count Wolverine seperate from X-men he'd be here too)

Then I'd say the lower tier but still somewhat mainstream marvel superheroes were Captain America, Punisher, Ghost Rider,  Venom, Daredevil, and Silver Surfer.

I wouldn't say Marvel's Thor or Iron Man were mainstream almost at all before their movies, though I'd put Iron Man above Thor because he at least had a junky short lived cartoon.

Everybody else that's popular or approaching popularity now definitely fell into the ""obscure"" camp. (Guardians of the Galaxy characters, Ant man, Deadpool, Doctor Strange, Black Panther, Captain Marvel etc)


So far I've been talking franchises, if you want a specific character popularity hierarchy that's a little harder because it shifted a lot. But I'd say it stablized for a while a bit like this:

1. Spider-man
2. Wolverine
3. Hulk
4. Thing
5. Human Torch
6. Cyclops
7. Professor X
8. Captain America
9. Silver Surfer
10. Mr Fantastic
11. Daredevil
12. Punisher 
13. Venom
14. Ghost Rider
15. Invisible Woman
16. Iron man
17. Thor
18. Storm
19. Rogue
20. Beast
21. She-hulk
22. Blade (most people didn't even know he was Marvel)

Nowadays I think the Hierarchy is a little more clear as far as the top 7 is concerned, but constantly shifting below that:

1. Spider-man
2. Iron man
3. Captain America
4. Hulk
5. Wolverine
6. Thor
7. Deadpool

Below in any order:

Prof X

Magneto

Quicksilver

Storm

Beast

Punisher

Daredevil

Nick Fury

Hawkeye

Black Widow

Groot

Rocket

Star-lord

Ant-man

War-machine

Venom

Thing

Human Torch

She-hulk

Characters that have fallen out of the public eye, but I think retain some mainstream popularity (even if dormant at the moment) would include Mr Fantastic, Invisble Woman, Cyclops, Rogue, Blade, Silver Surfer, and Ghost Rider. 

Characters who've been introduced and widely liked but may have yet to hit their stride in mainstream appeal include: Colossus, Nightcrawler, Iceman, Scarlet Witch, Vision, Winter Soldier, Falcon, Jessica Jones, Quake, Drax, and Gamora.

And finally, characters I predict to have a lot of appeal in mainstream superhero culture who've yet to hit the scene: Doctor Strange, Black Panther, Captain Marvel, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, and less likely, but possibly Gambit and Cable.

And for fun, characters and franchises I personally think could make their way into pop culture with varied success. 
 

Hercules

Moon Knight

Black Bolt

Crystal

Karnak

Ms. Marvel (Kamala Kahn)

Runaways

Young Avengers

Silk

Robbie Reyes Ghost Rider

New Mutants

X-factor

Power Pack

Squadron Supreme 

Gladiator (Majestor now) and the shiar

Blue Marvel

Howard the Duck

Miles Morales Spider-man

Nova (Richard Rider and Sam

The general consensus is people want the current underdog to win, they want DC to be competitive with Marvel, and with Batman v Superman coming in way below projections (actual projections not the bullshit $130mil studio projections WB put out to make the opening seem great), not even making more than the third Iron Man solo movie?

-Scarlet Witch 

-Weirdworld

Disturbing, indie stylings?

-Karnak

-Vision

Fun sci-fi action and ""out-there"" ideas?

-Ultimates

-Guardians of Infinity

Solid comedic writing? 

-Squirrel Girl
 
-Hellcat

I'd also recommend reading the new Amazing Spider-man, Invincible Iron Man and All-new All-different Avengers books because, while I do think they are quality books, they are also necessary if you want to keep your finger on the pulse of the new Marvel Universe's continuity.

Marvel continuing the trend of introducing, as far as general audiences are concerned, *new* characters, concepts, and stories is not going to be there ""downfall"". If anything, I'd say DC's over reliance on established brands has been, and could continue to be (already multiple batman/superman references in suicide squad. Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and Cyborg all being introduced in BvS etc.) their undoing in the modern cinematic landscape. (I know Ant-man references other brands a lot in trailers, but that's more for a joke rather than for direct association and even then most of the obscure new Marvel brands don't do that at all.)

But lets be straightforward, Marvel is impossibly bigger than DC right now in the modern zeitgeist and only gaining momentum, I just asked my friend the other day about super hero movies, and he said ""I don't really like the Marvel movies all to much, just never been into superman or batman, but I really liked Age of Ultron"" Marvel is synonymous with ""superhero"" to general audiences nowadays, and with 2 live action shows and 3 cartoons on air, their movies being played fucking constantly on channels like FX, 3-4 new movies coming out a year (movies which critics usually rate highly, and audiences practically always adore) and the ungodly amount of merchandise I see for them daily, I highly doubt there is going to be a big Marvel drop and DC rise anytime soon. I mean, 2014 had the most Marvel movies come out in one year EVER, and EVERY single one made over $700mil (DC has never made a single movie that made that much in their entire cinematic history besides TDK and DKR), and the following year we already have another Marvel movie make $1.3bil. All logic points to Marvel's continuing dominance, the only thing that could change this is a succession of enormous financial and critical *failures* (the likes of which marvelstudios hasn't experienced even once) and DC finally making several financially and critically successful films in a row.

I couldn't care less about Superman killing Zod, he honestly should've done it to begin with rather than wrestle him through every building in Metropolis.
