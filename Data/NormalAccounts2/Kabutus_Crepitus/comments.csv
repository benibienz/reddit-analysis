7,"I'm going to say it. I think Sap-Fling is top-tier now. 

The reason why this change is so good, is because he now doesn't have to feel like he needs to compete with plants such as Snow Pea or even Cold Snapdragon. He now was an identity, which is a 'right in the middle' line between no cost stalling (Stallia), and damaging stalling with a bit of a price (Cold Snapdragon).

Not to mention, this cost reduction is a super good combination with his fast recharge. It's so easy to get a full column of these out really early now.

And lastly, Sap-Fling is so, so, so good when combined with Apple Mortar. Having two columns of Mortars, and a column of Saps, it's almost impossible for the zombies to move.

I can't wait for when we get to vote for him in the tier list.",2016-11-16 22:47:04+00:00,da3eqdl,1.0,t3_5dc31c,2207,PlantsVSZombies

11,"Oh boy, here we go. I can appreciate your concern for the game, but here's a few things:

- Even if this was the worst game ever made, don't ever insult the developers like that. They did not ""ruin"" or destroy the game. They did exactly what a good sequel is supposed to do; Continuing the formula from the first game while adding tons, and tons of new elements of gameplay. Like, seriously, can you really see plants such as Escape Root, Electric Currant, Chard Guard, and the Shadow family in the first game? I can't. 

- You know how long the game has survived because of it's free-to-play model? Yes, some plants are ridiculously overpriced, but because of this model they chose, it's so much easier for the team to hype up an update, because anybody with a phone can download and play it without having to charge for it. I know many people on here that have quit the game but come back after time has passed. Thanks to the F2P model this game provides, it's super easy to do that. I guarantee you PVZ2 would be dead by now if the only income was through paying a few bucks to download it.

- Speaking of that, the game is not dead. The game will probably never die (unless a PVZ3 DOES come out) because of, again, the F2P model, and the nostalgia vibes taken from the first game. Not to mention monthly updates that provide at least one new plant and some new pinata parties.

- Lastly, a PVZ3 right now would be a terrible idea. Even if the game is good, Popcap would need to do lots of advertising to make it sell well, and to gain the trust of the casual audience again. Not to mention, many people like me probably would not play it because: having to be forced to move to PVZ3 after countless hours and money spent with PVZ2 instantly flushed away is a complete dick move to do. This is exactly why Sega no longer creates consoles for their games. 

- Everything else I want to say has been said by u/The_Ninjadillo. He knows his stuff. ",2016-11-15 01:50:02+00:00,da0oicg,1.0,t3_5czkz3,3961,PlantsVSZombies

13,"- Fix the Graphic/Sound problems. This is going to need a giant overhaul because there are so many problems relating to the sound engineering of this game

- Balance the plants. It's so fucked up to think that the International version, which has direct upgrade plants, is more balanced than this version. 

- Add more content in coming worlds. Chinese Neon Mixtape Tour is such an embarrassment to the 8 month waiting time we had to tolerate.

- Add back missing content from the International version. Most notably, Endless zones and multiple save files

- Remove pendants, and balance the rewarding system. (This goes for things like Daily rewards, the PVP shop, plant quests, and chests received from beating hard levels.

- Don't remove 2/3's of your progress when updating

20,"A big thing to note about decks is that it's always best to try and have cards that work best with your hero, for example, since Solar Flare has many moves and tricks that can give her extra sun, you can put many expensive cards in decks with her.

For Nightcap, the name of the game is high power, and tricks to mess with your opponent. Since two of Nightcap's special powers involve summoning Mushrooms, it's good to have several plants that benefit and are benefited by Mushrooms. 

Buff-Shroom is a very good card for decks like this. It's cheep and works super well with Shroom for Two as an early game threat. Kabloom heroes also have access to the very powerful Berry Blasts! Don't underestimate these things; they can be very powerful. If you have more Iceberg Lettuce, see if you can get 4 of those as well. By themselves, they're decent trick cards, but they have maximum effect when you combine them with your Winter Squash!

Now, as for what to take out? I'd say your Zapricotts, Admiral Bean, Vanilla, and Carrot truck cards. These all _can_ be good, but not preferred for a deck like this. 

Hopefully that helped! There will always be room for improvement in decks, but I do hope that my advice can help you guide you on what direction to take your deck.

Also, i'm jealous you have Nightcap. I've been trying to get him for ages!",2016-11-07 05:12:34+00:00,d9p787j,1.0,t3_5bk22o,5584,PlantsVSZombies
21,"Several more problems you forgot:

- Some worlds have an extremely loud ""BANG"" sound when a new wave starts (most notably, Far Future); for prople that are sensitive to noise, or have PTSD, it is extremely unsettling and frightning. 

- Speaking of sounds, most of the new plants don't have new sounds at all. Some barely even make noise. You'd think that a plant with the name ""DJ Morning Glory"" would be filled with funky, slick sounds, right? But nothing. It has no sounds except for it's plant food, which is the same as Laser Beans. Christ, how fucking lazy...

- The fact that daily rewards can give you puzzle pieces for plants you already own... You have no idea how many Power Lily pieces i've gotten despite owning the thing for almost the start of my game.

- The seed packets for new plants recently are terrible. The fact that most plants are now cropped out so much to try and reveal more of them is really awkward. Most notable examples being: Red Stinger, Cactus, Thyme Warp, and Stallia. 

- Pendants are a complete waste of time, and they do more harm than good. They waste all of your Hard Level rewards and dont have much payoff when equiping them. 

- No endless zones. That alone cuts the replayability of this version by half. 

- Just the fact that a much more polished, fast paced, and fun version of this game exists. Seriously everybody, just stick with the international version. ",2016-11-06 19:57:11+00:00,d9oj3zu,1.0,t3_5b8zt6,128467,PlantsVSZombies

For one, you don't have that many tricks; and almost no cheep ones. Cheep tricks can really change the pace of the game, and you always benefit since you play your tricks last; I would get rid of your Gravestone guy and Cuckoo's for some Bungee's. 

It's genally good to have zombies that have abilities which work well with eachother. Your toxic waste imps and imp pirates are good, but you can replace regular zombies with imps to amplify their ailities even more. Ninja Imps are very good, cheep minions for decks like this. 

And lastly, i'd say to throw away the conductor zombie. With having imps possesing tje deadly ability, having zombies thay raise attack is a little redundant.

60,"I mostly play Puff in Smash 4 but I can try and help out.

Firstly, Don't Jump-Cancel grab with Puff. It barely makes her go anywhere and her regular Dashgrab isn't that slow in the first place.

It's hard to get a grab on Fox, I get you, but one common way to do it is Shield-Grabbing. Another way to do it, if you're offensive, is to rush at Fox tricking him into thinking you're going to use an aerial attack and immediately drop down to Grab him. They might think you'll be using an air move and try to shield it. 

If you do plan on attacking Fox's shield and into a grab, use Dair. Hungrybox uses this alot nowdays; He will attack the opponent's shield with Dair, L-cancel it and grab the opponent while they are still in shield stun. It's not super reliable, but it's another way to get a grab from someone standing in shield.

On very low percents, you're going to want to do Uthrow when you get a grab because it can combo into Rest on Fox and Falco. Make sure you do it fast so your opponent doesn't DI the Uthrow. If they don't they will fly straight up and basically give you a free rest. If they do DI to the right or left, the best thing to do is to follow up with a Bair/Uair depending how far they've DI'd. Uair *can* combo into rest, but it's better to do it when you're attacking under a platform, because you can then get them with a Rest by reading the tech/roll. This takes lots of practice, but it's an extremely high reward when mastered. 

At high percents and you grab Fox, do Fthrow. It has some pretty great knockback and throws the opponent at a pretty low angle, and can even lead to a KO if done at the ledge and at high enough percent! 

Hopefully this helps, good luck out there! :)",2016-09-17 03:57:35+00:00,d7q6ulz,1.0,t3_53572r,9141,JigglypuffMains

101,"Let's start by making the plants you get not-shit.

Fire Gourd is fine as he his, but could probably recharge slightly faster. As it stands, Jack-O-Lantern is pretty much a hard upgrade.

White Radish Is also decently balanced, but it's the fact that they throw so much shit to counter him, and that you **absolutely need** him in certain levels because of the black holes or Master Oogway dudes. And despite his thing being a faster Wall-Nut, he doesn't feel that much faster at all. He also doesn't combo well with...

Heavenly Peach. While being better then her International Counterpart (I.E Aloe), she doesn't help you at all with the select plants you have. Like, again, they encourage you to use her with White Radish, but with all of these insta-kills everywhere it's pretty frickin' hard to do that. Let's make her PF give plants a vulnerability to instakills for maybe once or twice (They can even use the bubble sprite they have for her PF now.)

And lastly, Bamboo Shoot. God is thing awful. I'd probably consider him bottom 5 if he had an international counterpart, because seriously, a 175 sun plants has struggles killing just a damn basic zombie. I don't care about his extra range, Spikeweed has more DPS than Bamboo will ever get, and costs less. Just make his bamboo spikes stronger and it'll be fine. It's plant food is kinda decent but not worth what else it has to offer. 

For zombies, we have an ungodly amount featured. Let's nerf the torch dudes first; the spinning ones. Make them walk slower, or just remove them from the game because the world already has a zombie holding a torch. Like, seriously, what does this guy add besides just being a jackass?

Okay, now for the Nunchucks. You thought the jester was bad? Imagine if he could instantly kill plants too. God it's stupid, How about let's just make him eat plants instead of that stupid attack, because Nunchucks are supposed to be known as a defensive weapon anyways. I mean, if you really wanted to go full-on massacre, you'd probably wanna get a Bo staff. 

The sword guy. No, not the boss, I mean the regular zombie that **also** one-shots plants. Seriously, what's the point of adding all of these zombies but giving them the same bullshit features? Bleh, anyway, My best bet for these guys is to have his swing be slower. If they wanna have multiple instant-kill zombies in the world, fine, but at least make them easy to kill. I mean, Christ, not even Neon Mixtape Tour is this awful in One-hit zombies.

And now for my personal most hated zombie, the Drinking Monk. The original monk is fine because he wasn't bullshit until he actually got drunk. *This* jackass though is such an irritating little shit because his gourd has incredible range for attacking, said gourd kills plants within seconds despite not killing them instantly, and all of that becomes so much worse once he actually does the deed and chugs that wine. Let's just nerf his damage from the guord, and make it so he has to take less health before he starts to drink. I mean, fuck. Anything to nerf this guy, I just hate him.

And lastly, all I wanna say for the bosses is to just cut their max health by a quarter. Yeah, that's really it. The only thing worse than fighting an incredibly hard boss is fighting an incredibly hard boss that becomes boring to fight. Hopefully this health nerf will make the fights go much quicker.

Oh, and all of this doesn't even mention the leveling. I don't care, because they abuse the hell out of that too.

And lastly, make the Sound design and Engineering not piss-poor. ",2016-09-05 17:47:34+00:00,d7ah3v6,1.0,t3_51afa6,2076,PlantsVSZombies

But then suddently it all goes away the next day when you feel like you just forget everything. But this consistency delves into a problem in what the community thinks about her. 

It's a problem when there are still people that don't believe she has combos into rest.
Fair to reat, Dair to rest, Nair to rest, Uair to rest can even work sometimes, and she can jab reset with a sweetspotted Ftilt, or Fair. While her edgeguarding has been nerfed from previous games, she can still use Dair as a semi-spike and potentially take advantage of the new ledge mechanaics with her powerful Bair.

151,"Thank you for the reply! I'll admit several of these things I can agree with you on; this is a pretty weird list i've made. However, I do wanna explain my reasoning for Sheik and Robin in their position

Sheik: Needles, one of her best zoning options is really easy to avoid for Puff. You can either crouch or simply stay in the air to dodge them. Several of Sheiks combo starts and finishers are things Puff can either escape or punish (Nair or Rest), for example, a Sheik using Bouncing Fish on a grounded Puff can guarantee a free Rest if the Puff player reads it beforehand, or stays earthbound. And lastly, especially since 1.1.5, Sheik has an awkward time killing Puff as her only decent kill moves against Puff are Usmash, Uair, and maybe Bair.

Robin: I'll admit, Robin does have two things in this Matchup that prevents it from being favourable; Fair, and Bthrow. If he manages to land these moves, they can guarantee an early kill against Puff and that's just no good. But for what Puff can do; she can crouch against all forms of Arc Thunder, she can jump out of Arc fire, she can easly exploit her recovery until it runs out, and sometimes pull off a couple tricks if she manages to get an item that Robin drops. 

And lastly, Robin is one of the few characters Puff can camp against, due to the aforementioned crouching preventing any long-distance damage, and the fact that she can out-run Robin on the ground. ",2016-08-24 08:30:40+00:00,d6ufe39,2.0,t1_d6uearc,3655,JigglypuffMains

- Make his recharge longer. That would give you an excuse to use other plants like Snapdragon and Winter Melon more as they help you setup your defense much quicker.

- Change the formula of his PF. Instead of it doing identical damage to Snapdragon with freezing, make it do much less damage (Maybe only able to kill &lt; Basic zombie heath) and have the freezing effect go on for longer. That way, his PF effect will have more of a utility use instead of just huge instant damage. ",2016-08-21 20:41:40+00:00,d6qzstd,1.0,t3_4yviym,16866,PlantsVSZombies

Alot of the choices we make are definitely a group effort; nobody is left out when a shit choice is made. And sometimes, we know the solition to a problem but are either too lazy to fix it (which is definitely a problem), or, well, we just don't know the solution.

And with all due and repaect, Boyned has absolutely done alot for us, and it's possible we might have taken it too far (i'm still going back and forth between both sides.

There has been several new plants added to the game. Most do cost money, but we have been getting new free plants in a system called ""Epic Quests.""

Epic Quests are like regular quests found in the travel log, but they span for a total of 8-10 levels and in the end you get a pretty big reward. So far, we've gotten 3 plants out of the Epic Quests and all of them have incredibly unique styles and ways to play.

There have also been getting special monthly events that give us brand new Pinata Parties, they can be pretty fun to do, and allow you to use whatever new plant comes out without paying!

That's what we can access for now, but...

**SPOILERS BELOW**

There will be a brand new system coming soon based on leveling plants (It's not confirmed but pretty guaranteed to be optional) which will made several crappy plants decent, like the Intensive Carrot or Bowling Bulb.

473,"The problem is that, in my opinion, the Heavy is the most complicated class in the game to fully master and understand, and none of his stats or unlocks reflect that very well. It's not that it's poorly represented, it's that it doesn't make a fun experience.

A small example is the Brass Beast. It's not great or anything but it can pull a decent effort in defending or when standing on a cart. The problem is that it's an extremely annoying and irritating weapon to use. (EDIT: Another example was when the Eureka Effect had to make you wack a sentry twice as much to fully level it) 

The Heavy is more-so like that overall. He has and needs lots of knowledge to win games and lead a team, but having all of that be put on the slowest class doesn't seem like it's worth it in the end. Compare him to the Soldier or Demo where mastering them grants you a million ways to explosive jump and gain frag kills. 

That's why I chose Heavy. Pyro definitely needs changes too, but I think giant man needs them more so that there's a more unique and engaging way to play the class.

Blueberry: He's decent in early levels but can tend to become overwhelmed. I'm sure however people have managed to get really far with him but you really have to think of your strategy and not fuck up.

644,"I think most people that praise this world haven't actually played it. The problem is that they added way too many gimmicks in it. The return of Plantern and Coffee Bean is cool, but the fact that you need both of them in your limited arsenal is pretty bad; either remove the fog or remove that sleep wizard. 

And of course, the Horse Rider is just a pain in the ass. Nevermind that it's basically a surfer zombie that is twice as fast with incredible health and flys over your defenses, it practically has no weakness despite the other new zombies getting counters. (Blover doesn't work either and that pisses me the fuck off.)

But let's talk about the gimmicks again and why they're far more annoying then they need to be. Coffee Bean's purpose is fine, since he just counters one zombie and that zombie is pretty slow. No, what gets me is Plantern's use. 

They gave him 2 uses: Fog, and the thief guys that disguise themselves, but here's the problem, right? The thief dude can only be damaged when it's not hidden, which is fine on it's own, but Plantern has a limited range and they convince you to put him in the front because of not only the thief zombie, but the fog as well (Blover thankfully works against it, but sometimes isn't worth it). Even taking the bullshit leveling out of it, the Calvary Horse dudes instantly kill the first zombie they see, right? And what's the plant that's supposed to be in the front? Plantern.

Do you see the problem here? The gimmicks counteract themselves and just create the experience so frustrating. I can appreciate them making new content, but if the content is unpolished and irritating, I'd rather stick to the international version.

So why are we arguing that he's OP then? And if you mean in the sense that WSSP plants are needed to fulfil a gimmick, Hot Potsto should be tier 1 because there are other plants that can do her job better.

Not really. Okay, yes, you can take them out in that one wave, sure, but what happens when the next wave comes? You can place as many Thyme Warps and waste as much plant food as you want, but you're eventually going to run out, and when you end up using all your seed slots just to back up Thyme Warp, what do you do then?

Yeah, I see where you're coming from, but it's why people have been worrying about it too. The terrible way PVZ2C does levelling has set a mindset that any kind of system is a shit idea.

&gt;your last point is never going to happen.

Yes, it might not, but I did say it was pretty farfetched. And while people now might have coins up the ass, there are also new players to consider and there might be more in the future.

Thyme Warp being balanced is debatable. You claim he's unbalanced  (even though your own tier list has him in Tier 3) and he will be more unbalanced in other worlds. I'll admit you're one step ahead of me in using a mod to use Thyme Warp in other worlds, but I think calling him overpowered is a stretch.

You're wasting a seed slot (or two with imitater) to use a get out of jail free card that you might not even need to use at all if your defense is solid enough and said seed slot can be used on another instant or support plant.

851,"Time to break out every single problem with her! Ready everyone?

- Lightest character in the game

- Laughable ground speed that makes it impossible for tech chasing/pivoting

- Range is awful and her disjoints are on the wrong moves 

- Usmash has a blind spot at the start of the move

- Fsmash is strong but is really punishable if missed

- Dsmash is great when it works, but it never will work because ass range and never works by the ledge

- Grab is good for her size and pummel is amazing but her throws are in an extreme grayscale of ""can't combo"" and ""can't kill until unrealistic percentages"".

- Utilt and Dtilt are her best ground moves yet Frame 5&gt; Areal and ground moves completely shit on them

- Bad recovery. Oh, She can make it back horizontally perfectly, but don't even try when it's vertical. No legit Up-B and Pound's distance has been nerfed.

- Air moves, again, are great when they hit, but never will because shields and the aforementioned piss poor range

- Dair is too inconsistent to use properly 

- Extremely long landing lag because god forbid she uses an aerial without getting punished. 

- Shield is big, but that doesn't matter when you're pressured about an instant death if it breaks

- Along with the distance being shortened, Pound doesn't even work as a shield breaker because of how you always get punished when you use it and half the time it shield-stabs when it should have broken said shield.

- Rollout. Oh god, Rollout. It's strong, sure, but you can't do a damn thing when you hit someone midair and it's hitbox doesn't even cover Puff all the way. It's basically what you use when you've given up and know you're gonna lose (which will happen often)

- Sing

- Rest is good when it hits, but there's always a 50% chance to get punished even when you hit it. It also rivals the damage and knock back of moves like Wario's Waft and Cloud's Limit moves when those moves are much, much safter.

- Hasn't gotten a single change in over a year

Blover: Does combos involving lifting fighters up with plants he works well with in PVZ2 and then striking from the ground. His weakness is that he's vulnerable up close and is a little tricky to start up combos (but strong when they do work)

NightShade: Does strong damage but needs to recharge: pressing one of the special buttons will call a moonflower that will regrow Nightshade's leaves over time. 

Bowling Bulb: Place the bulbs in set locations and do chain damage! Also works as a projectile user 


**Zombies**

Pirate Captain: Summon his parrot to grab the opponent which allows you to rack up damage! Can also call for Swashbucklers for minor support

Fisherman Zombie: The spacing character. Fights in mid range but has a hard time when fighters get too close or too far (Fishing rod shoots slowly)

Jester Zombie: Has grab combos similar to Smash Bros and had a reflector for projectiles that can break after constant usage.

I joke around a bit and then we both start the match.

The next game, it's on Tamodatchi with the Mii Plaza theme. I crouch with the beat, but the opponent starts to try and synchronise with me! I thought it was cute, so I simplified my beat so they could follow along. After a while we both taunted and started the actual fight. 

A few more matches go by and I'm having the time of my life. This person is incredibly good but at the same time shows respect and makes jokes while we fight.

We then get back to Dark Lord. I do my usual and bop to the beat. And this time, they get it **perfectly** synced! It was

Even if the effect does work, it'll probably be at the first few tiles to the right which means that it'll get eaten really quickly. And it's plant food doesn't really help it either since it only effects 3 zombies rather than all of them like all the other pult-plants.

[White Radish](http://plantsvszombies.wikia.com/wiki/White_Radish): Not good, but not bad. It does help against those annoying as hell black holes, but I don't like that it's a defensive plant that has low health. Not to mention that there are aton of instant kill zombies in this world which means that it won't be staying up for long and will really screw up your defenses if the level contains that damn black hole-thing. 

[Fire Gourd](http://plantsvszombies.wikia.com/wiki/Fire_Gourd): Probably my favorite plant of the bunch. It's not amazing, but it's really fun to use. It does decent damage to groups of zombies and I like that you can use it when it's still charging. It's also adorable as fuck.

[Heavenly Peach](http://plantsvszombies.wikia.com/wiki/Heavenly_Peach): Not as good as I initially thought, but I still like using it. Very original idea that opens up lots of new strategies and is great on ""save our seeds"" levels.  

[Bamboo Shoot](http://plantsvszombies.wikia.com/wiki/Bamboo_Shoot_%28PvZ2%29): Bad. Really bad. You're paying 175 sun for a plant that has trouble even killing a basic zombie. Sure, it can affect all zombies in it's reach, but Spikeweed can do the same thing and it costs much less while doing much more damage per second. I can appreciate they give you this plant after beating a level, but it's still a really bad plant to use. I wouldn't recommend using it.

953,"I think the people that want the old maps back forgot how fucking terrible the game used to be. 

Let's recap:

- The branching paths all required keys, which were pretty uncommon to find. To unlock some of the later plants, you had to have around 5 or even 6 of the damn things. Was it really worth finding those 5 Wild West keys for a 25% shovel bonus? Cool, now collect 6 more to get Winter Melon! 

- Stars. Fuck these things to hell. You can't advance to the next world without getting a certain number of them. You get stars by unlocking gates or replaying levels. Levels also used to be much slower and the turbo button didn't exist. 

- How many people do you think would pull their hair out if they had to replay day 25 of Big Wave Beach, or day 5 of Neon Mixtape Tour 3 times with each replay getting harder and harder just so you can get that last star to advance to the next world? 

- It pulls a stupid excuse just so you can pay more money. ""Don't wanna grind levels to unlock that gate? Here, pay us the amount of 2 premium plants and you're all good to go!"" 

The reason why I like the new maps are because, while they're sorta bland, are very straight forward. Just beat levels until you get your world key and Zomboss. If you want more, then test out your skills in the endless zone! 

I've been playing the Chinese version recently, which keeps the old maps and makes new ones based on said old maps for the newer worlds. I haven't gotten to that point, but I do want to say that i'm very, very glad that Popcap changed them before it was too late. ",2016-03-10 19:57:59+00:00,d0v3jly,1.0,t3_49umny,6693,PlantsVSZombies

Why do I have to bring a mediocre plant (Guac, Dandelion) To make just this supposed 'niche plant' stronger?

1020,"I hate to say this, but this guy is probably bottom 10.

While he is strong and has a great PF effect, he has 3 big problems which hinder him, they are:

**1. Sun Cost**: Not many plants go above 300 sun in this game (or even 200 for that matter), so when you see a plant that costs that much, you're expecting it to be a powerhouse, right? Well, the cost would be fine if it was the only problem, but it's not. 

**2. It's so fucking slow**: You can't rely on this thing alone because it takes such a long time to recharge. And once the projectile finally comes out, you realize that it can't even kill Bucketheads in one shot. You might as well run Chomper or Toadstool, at least with them their attack comes out the second you plant them and you can scoop them up when you're done because they're much cheaper. 

Now for the biggest problem with Citron:

**3. No splash damage**: Again, copping with the fact that he costs 350 sun, I can get Strawburst: a plant that can attack instantly, does tons of damage in it's medium and large berries, and has *huge* splash damage, for just 1 normal sun more. If you wanted your Citron to hit the Robo-Cone instead of the Bug Bot that is slightly in front of it, well too fucking bad, because now you gotta wait 10 seconds before it can fire again. 

So, yeah, why would you want to spend so much sun on a plant that takes way too long to charge up, and only affects one zombie at a time? I will give it credit though, his design *is* really cool, and he can be devastating with his PF effect, but you shouldn't have to constantly feed a plant PF to make them good (I.E Bowling Bulb). 

That's why attackers like Starfruit and Winter Melon are praised so much - they already do aton of damage and their fantastic PF effects are just bonuses to them. ",2016-02-23 00:16:42+00:00,d09yj4b,1.0,t3_473geu,5776,PlantsVSZombies

**Iceberg Lettuce and Grimrose** - Just because they're out-classed doesn't make them bad at the start. Tons of people still use Cherry Bomb and regular Snapdragon even when direct upgrades to them exist. And as I said for I. Lettuce, it has an amazing PF effect.

**Puff-Shroom** - Not everyone likes to do the ""PF your Factories"" strat, as maybe you want to save them incase a very eary strong or group of zombies comes by towards early-mid. Most notable in Greatest Hits or Tiki Torch-er

**Shrinking Violet** - It still can't kill zombies instantly other than imps, along with taking a few seconds to start up. The other 3x3 instants work because they go off the second you plant them, which is perfect for a group that's right next to your lawnmower. You don't have to see Cherry Bomb grow a few sizes, give a smug face, watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and then explode, do you?

**Rotobaga** - Either it has something I don't know about or you're bluffing. I think Starfruit is a fantastic plant, yet, I eventually have to stop using it around level 60-70 of Endless zones. Having to live with only affecting one zombie is something some plants just have to live with, sadly. ",2016-02-20 23:20:38+00:00,d07iu7h,6.0,t1_d07idsg,745,PlantsVSZombies
1043,"Oh goodie, my turn!

**Iceberg Lettuce** - It's still a fantastic starting plant for EZ, as it stalls the first zombie so you have enough time to plant more in the economy. It also has the best PF out of all the stunners.

**Puff-Shroom** - Sun might not be a problem towards mid-game, but it definitely helps early game. Especially with levels that start with several imps/basic zombies at once. It's also is great for stalling Gargs

**Grimrose** - Again, fantastic as a starter plant since it goes for the strongest zombie in the lane. Sure, you might need Moonflower to make it better, but I think people just underestimate how good Moonflower can be in endless. It can also attack zombies from behind and had tons of invincibility frames for stalling 

**Celery Stalker** - Okay, I might have to disagree with my own opinion on this one. It's good, but not super good.

**Shrinking Violet** - How is that any different than a 3x3 instant that can obliterate almost any zombie right away? Especially Grapeshot, which is not listed as OP for some reason.  Yeah, it might be cheaper and faster to use, but it still isn't a solution to everything. 

**Rotobaga** - The thing that hurts it is that it can only affect lone zombies, which is almost non-exsistant in the levels that we're talking about. Starfruit is better simply because it's better at close corners and has an insanely good PF. Rotobaga can also sometimes have a problem with killing basic zombies if the angling isn't just right.

1199,"Here, let me share what I've been doing:

- Sun-Shroom
- Celery Stalker
- Power Lily
- Imitater (Power Lily or Sun-Shroom typically)
- Blover/Hurrikale (Either works) 
- Stunion 
- Starfruit
- Winter Melon

Instead of using all of your Plant Food at the beggining, use 1 on a Sun-shroom and save the rest for later. If metal gargs are the first thing that show up, use Starfruit's Plant food on one. Then, if there's another one, use your stunion and put your celery stalker behind it. Start placing Sun-Shrooms under it too, so that it get's distracted and will eventually be killed by the Celery. 

Once the jam changes, start building the rest of your economy and place a row of Winter Melons in the back. These guys should take care of every other zombie in the level. If you think you need more firepower, add a lane or two of Starfruit. 

Once you get your Offensive plants up, get your PF back. If the level is just giving them too you like candy, save it for when the Gargs come back. Also, if you end up starting the level with way too many zombies and a garg, spend your PF on 1 Melon, and 1 Starfruit to kill a garg. Blover/Hurrikale is for when breakdancer zombies show up and you can take advantage of them. Or, if you're in a struggle, Hurrikale can help give you space

Hope this helped :)

- Restore it's damage from brawl. Who thought it was a good idea to make it do aton less when it's very rarely used?

- More shield damage. It still does alot and can break one if the opponent shields 3 hits from it, but adding just a little more will help it out.

- Allow us to turn it around more. As it is now, you can get a max of 4-5 turns if you're fast and can really pressure the opponent in a tight corner. Giving the chance to do 6-7 would be superb.

- Charge time decreased. This should make sense.

1268,"I'm assuming you made this because you saw my tier list in the other thread. I guess this can be a good time to talk about these two:

Pea-Nut:  Absolutely clever design and name, but that's sadly the best part about him. One normal damage shot is not enough for a health reduction compared to a wall-nut. Because this game is big on fast-paced hordes, that one damage will not make a difference at all. It's also not good as a defense option because it has less health of a wall-nut, and doesn't have any unique quirks like the infi-nut. Not to mention, Endurian outclasses him in every way. Even if he has shorter range, he makes up for it by hitting every zombie that's trying to eat him. 

Dandelion: Horrible DPS - The projectiles move way too slow and don't do enough damage to help balance it. The gimmick of: ""Being able to shoot 3 lanes"" doesn't help because it's random, and she doesn't target the lane that needs help the most, Homing Thistle is this plant done much better. Also, it's price is the weirdest thing i've ever seen for this game. 275? Why such a specific cost? Even if the plant was 175, it'd still be horrible. 

The Blover combo also doesn't help her because it leaves her vulnerable to everything. And, again, because the projectiles are so weak, and that she's attacking 3 lanes at once and not 1, she's going to barely change anything, and then just sit there as a waste of space. And her plant food doesn't change things either, you could use your PF on a different plant, and almost always get better results. If you really want plants that attack several lanes at once, use Melon-pult or Winter Melon; the former is only 50 sun more then Dandelion and contributes so much more to the lawn.

1309,"* Sun-Shroom/Twin Sunflower (Depends on world)

* Squash/Ghost Pepper

* Power Lily

* Imitater

* Blover/Chard Guard (For worlds that don't give you Blover in endless)

* Tile Turnip/Gold Leaf/Grave Buster

* Starfruit/Strawburst 

* Winter Melon

(Note that i'm gonna be talking about endless)

The first thing I do is that I give plant food to as many sun-shrooms/twins as there are flags in the level. (I.E. I'd use 3 plant food if there were 3 flags) I lay a squash down and start building the rest of my defenses. If there are Gargantuars in the level, I place my sun plants on the 2nd and 4th(shrooms only) row(s). The first row will have a row of Winter Melons, and the 3rd row will be Starfruit; for thrown imps.

If I brought Chard Guard with me, they will be planted on the 6th row, in front of another row of Starfruit. I typically would imitate these guys if I bring them with, since i'm gonna have to be replacing them alot. 

Tile Turnip is self-explanatory. I have 1 on a sun plant, and the others on Winter Melons or Strawburst (Which I usually bring in non-Gargantuar levels), and unleash the tiled plants whenever a big wave arrives. 

If I am given extra sun at the beginning of the level, I run ghost pepper instead  of the Squash, as yes, the extra 25 sun can really make a difference. Especially mid game.

To maximize Squash's potential, I place starfruit right next to a Gargantuar to stall, and wait for more zombies to be stacked with him, this is useful to master once the game starts throwing out 3 Gargantuars in a lane. 

And, yeah, that's about it.

People also have come to this weird conclusion that the big berry is the only one that should matter, but the smaller ones can help too! The little berry can take out a regular zombie in one shot, and the medium berry does same thing but in an area.
