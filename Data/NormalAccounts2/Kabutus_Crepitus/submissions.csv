Before we update the tier list and continue with that (which will happen soon), we still wanna let the Heroes hype run it's course. I'm having a great time with it so far! 

But with that said, some of you may have noticed that for the past month or so, every post on the sub has been flaired; either by user or by Troop and I. We've been pretty subtle about it now, but I think it's time that we start to have it as a main rule. If you forget to do it, don't worry! We'll cover it for you, but please make sure you don't just post all the time without flairing. 

Now, to settle down some confusion, you might also know that some posts have ""Heroes"" as a flair. **To conclude that, if your post relates to PVZ heroes at all, your post does not have to have a ""Heroes"" flair**. Just use the selection we already have and you should be fine. A good example of this already in effect is [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantsVSZombies/comments/58j8cb/what_does_this_star_under_some_plants_and_zombies/).

And lastly, while it isn't a main rule, and won't be added: We would prefer if you refrain from linking or bringing up anything related to hacks, cheats, or the creation of another Heroes subreddit. Please guys, we don't want a Heroes subreddit.

It's a great post, but I wanted to elaborate even more what was oversighted in both his post and the development of the world.

- So, the music. Like with every other song and sound in the game, it now sounds extremely muffled and low-quality. MIDI's have much higher quality than these songs. 

- To make matters worse, if you beat a level in the world and go to the next level, the previous jam that played will play for about 3 seconds before the game goes ""WHOOPS"" and changes it to the 'choose your seeds' music. Like, what? How do you mess that up? The international version doesn't have this problem, so what changed in the coding? You know the programming is amazing when the game is making such simple mistakes like turning on and off songs. I could make an entire rant on how terrible the sound engineering is for this game, but, that can be for another time (Soon, actually).

- Stallia/Ice plants are awful in this world. Get this, right? You know how the zombies speed up when the Punk or Metal jams are playing? Well, for some reason, when those jams are playing, and you try to use, say, Stallia, the effect doesn't work; they walk the same speed as if Stallia never went off at all. And this is obviously a bug because there are levels with the Punk jam almost always playing in which they force you to use Stallia. It's so stupid. 

- Magnet-Shroom is indirectly buffed but directly nerfed. The good news: She can now attract Punk zombies at any level. Usually, you have to be the same level or higher than a zombie to take their metal parts. What's the downside? The fact that Punk Metals now have the same depleting time as any other metal object. Originally, if Magnet-Shroom attracted a Punk zombie, it evaporates/dissolves much quicker, so that she can attract the next metal thing much faster. That doesn't sound too bad, but just like Stallia, they balance levels without this change in mind. Either nerf the amount of Punk zombies that gets sent out, or just fix the depleting time.

- Intensive Carrot is now extremely broken. For some reason, certain instant plants can now be revived and used for a second time. and a third. and a forth. And one of these plants is **Power Lily**. This basically means you now get 3 free plant food if you choose to bring Power lily, Intensive Carrot, and Imitater; with either one or two of them being much cheaper and having a faster recharge. Isn't that damn balanced?! I'm right now trying to test more plants that are now strangely affected by this, but i'll get to you on that. Can someone also test if a level 4 plant will still have the change to be boosted when revived?

- This is a nitpick, but why are the seed packets so trash? I'm not talking the backgrounds, those are fine, but every plant recently feels like it's being trapped in a box rather than being shown on the packet. In this update, some examples include Cactus, Phat Beat, Thyme Warp, and Intensive Carrot. It's so awkward and weird in my opinion. 

- Breakdancers are now immune to Blover. Now they have pretty much no weakness and there's nothing you can do when there a bunch of them onscreen.

- Hair Metals now do their shockwave attack off-screen akin to pre-nerf Wizards and Octos. Great, we totally needed them to be more Overpowered.

I haven't fought the boss yet, as i'm still trying to earn all of the stars, but there are so many stupid changes in this world that I had to talk more of them. I'm probably missing even more stuff like how hard it is to get any of the new plants outside of Celery Stalker and Intensive Carrot; The extreme Thyme Warp nerf, tons of sounds missing like how DJ Morning Glory has absolutely no sounds whatsoever, or the new K.I.S.S member zombie... it's all just one huge pile of mess.

And yet I still keep fucking playing this thing like an insane person.

____________________________________________________


In **5th place**, we'd like to congratulate u/Hawlucha333! Their piece [represents a nice group selfie of just about every single plant in the series!](http://joltiklover.deviantart.com/art/PVZ-Background-627352352)) Wonderful work, this must have taken forever to make... 

Coming at **4th place**, we have u/epicandetc2234! Their piece is a simple but very smoothly made [Ghost Pepper!](http://imgur.com/a/wYhO9) For real, my friend, this is some excellent outlining that you did.

Now for the homestretch, these top 3 will earn gracious rewards with each becoming better and better than the last! 

Coming at **3rd place**, we have u/natelis25, with a very stylish [Bonk Choy!](https://twitter.com/ElisHillman79/status/763655007703076864?lang=en-gb) But for real... Something about the way this piece is done just fills me with butterflies. The colors, the background, the lines thicker than my bubble butt. It's all perfect.  I wonder what Blover would look like in this style...

Congrats to Natelis, your piece will be linked on the sidebar for pretty much forever (at the very least quite awhile). You will also receive a $10 Itunes or Play store card to give all of that money to those delicious premium plants. (Just PM me which one you prefer.) 

This was a very tough call for the next two, but we ultimately came up with this positioning; don't feel bad, #2, as your art is not far off from #1 at all.

Our runner-up (I.E **2nd place**) is u/lolwutburger with a [beautifully crafted view of the lawn!](http://fluffymystic.deviantart.com/art/It-s-a-contest-entry-for-the-PvZ-subreddit-628129429). What can I say? The shading and bright colors are such a pretty combo. Does the PVZ house actually have a garage? I never actually noticed. If it's entirety made up, it fits very well and adds to the tempo and wonderful consistency of the work!

As reward for second place, you will also receive the aforementioned rewards for 3rd (PM one of us which card you prefer), **and** a very special flair which will be on the way soon. Use it for bragging rights and to make us all jealous of your greatness!

And now, for our grand winner of our Contest...

For **1st** place, everyone give a great big round of karma and gilds to u/Krikytt for their wonderful, incredible, beautiful drawing of [the mushroom gang!](https://twitter.com/krikytt/status/768663069299843072) As great as the other results are, we chose this one as our favorite for being visually appealing, but also very easy to look at. That's a very hard task to do on it's own, but Krik pulled it very well, and we hope you agree with us on just how slick and smooth this piece is.

To recap your prizes, you will be recieving a **20** dollar gift card (PM us either Itunes or Google Play), A special flair to show your excellence, **and** PVZ: Game of the Year edition on Steam! If you already have it on Steam, you can instead choose from any Steam game you want that is 5$ or under! One last thing... not only will your piece be linked on the Sidebar, but it will also be fully shown and always on display, so people don't even have to click your link to see it! And hey, I think you'll like it; everyone deserves to see what you've made.

We thank everyone that has participated, and we hope everyone is happy with the results! We expect this as a result to help our community grow more and maybe bring some new outsiders to interact and discuss! But knowing that I have a tier list to update, and that we need to still work on the prizes, I'll close my mouth and just get back to work.

After seeing all of your responses on my previous post relating to what we should do about voting for future tier lists, and we've come up with a few ideas on how we're gonna do this.

One idea many had was having comments depict their voting, and that definitely does seem like an idea to get rid of bots and IP changers, which was our original problem anyway. The problem, like I mentioned, comes from not enough votes coming in due to taking longer to give your opinion (rather then simply clicking on two buttons for your result to go in). But an idea I had for this sounds complicated, but could potentially work.

- When a tier list post is, well, posted, I will immediately post 5 comments just saying ""S-tier (top)"", ""A-tier (High)"", e.t.c, and people will upvote these posts for what tier they want the current plant to be voted in, and that will be how we count votes. Since the threads will be under 'contest' mode, nobody will know how many votes there are besides me, which is all that's important. If you wanna comment to back up your reasoning for why you voted a particular plant a certain tier, you can do it under the respective tier.

- Another idea we had was migrating to Google Forums. Google Forums has actually been decent in the past; in that it's much harder to break into their system due to better and more secure programming then something like Strawpolls, as well as having a much more wide open selection of security checks than Strawpolls has.

- Our last idea we had was having people straight up commenting what they wanted a plant to vote for. You don't even need to give a reason as to why; just simply say whatever letter you want and I'll count it. Don't worry, it's okay! 

We're going to be experimenting with it and trying stuff out in the next couple of days. I apologize in advance because it's going to get pretty confusing, but i'll try and make it clear how to vote in the post itself.

And as a confirmed, official change: **All future plants will have a minimum of 48 hours of voting time instead of 24.** I've realized over time that some people can't make it here everyday because they're busy or away from technology, and that's fine, so i'll be giving everyone some more breathing time to decide what tier they really want their plant to vote for.

And before I go, I have a small Google Sheet on our progress so far, hopefully it's easy to read!

It's your friendly neighborhood mod here! You may have noticed in the past few days we've had an unusual problem with tier lists. They keep popping up and immediately leaving.

To tell you the truth, the reason why is because the votes have been manipulated. At least ever since we've tried to do Tall-Nut's voting. We've had to delete the posts and start over because, it's not fair for the people that reasonably vote and it's not fair in the community because the entire point of the tier list is to make it as accurate to the community's opinion as possible; and it was! Even considering Lightning Reed at B-tier or whatever, these are still your votes and the comments you use to back them up are very justified and understanding. 

But either way, this is where **we need your help**. We need ideas on how to continue these polls, but without bots/manipulating, and having it easy to access so that we can get as many votes as possible. Even if you all have a small idea on what you want to vote for, comment below, because we do really want to continue this project, but it's just so hard to do at the moment.

Thank you for your understanding and I hope we can figure something out together! ",PlantsVSZombies,UPDATE: The tier list problem.,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantsVSZombies/comments/4xveo6/update_the_tier_list_problem/

I thought of an idea where I can turn my insanity into a fun little contest! 

__________________________________________________________________________________

Here's the goal: **You're aiming to have as many points as possible.** ""How do you get points?"" You ask. Well, it all comes from what plants you have when you beat the level. If you have a plant that is on the lawn or in the conveyor belt, you add 'X' points for them. The key goes like this (EDIT: No Powerups or Plant Food used either):

- Winter Melon: 3 points 

- Coconut Canon: 4 points

- Citron: 6 Points

- Primal Potato Mine: 4 points

- Cherry Bomb: 5 points

- Grapeshot: 7 points

- Spikerock: 4 points

- Primal Wall-Nut: 3 points

- Iceberg Lettuce: 5 points

- Threepeater: 4 points

- Cold Snapdragon: 3 points

- A.K.E.E: 6 points

- Phat Beet: 5 points

- Repeater: 6 points

- Intensive Carrot: 5 points 

- Peashooter: 7 points

When you finish a level, add up the points and submit your score! We're gonna try and see who gets the highscore for this challenge! 

________________________________________________________

Here's an example on how to do it: I'll be using [this](https://i.imgur.com/gRqj8lP.jpg)

Winter Melon (x2) = 6 points

Citron (x1) = 6 points

Primal Wall-Nut (x1) = 3 points

Phat-Beet in the Conveyor Belt (x1) = 5 points

All of them together = 20 points.

And there you go, that's your score! The only thing you have to do is just post proof of your score (like above) and that's it! I hope you all have fun and get a much better score then I ever could.

It seems like, no matter what I do, I can't seem to like myself. I've tried several techniques to help but I always lump back to square one. One of the biggest causes of that is my disability. I was diagnosed with autism when I was three. Despite what some people think about people like me, I have been very well aware of it and it seems like I can't be as good as others because I'm permanently slower than everyone else. 

This applies to all areas of my life; School, work, hobbies, socializing, even mental thinking. Why bother to try when you're guaranteed to do worse than everybody else? 

Because of this, I have some friends that I am very envious of; they take collage courses (We're all Junior/Senior year), they tend to do more 'intense' things such as drink or smoke, and they have jobs when at the moment I'm occupied at absolutely nothing. 

It doesn't matter what nice things they say to me, I can never believe them. How can I, where they're, for the lack of better term: Are better than me in almost every situation/trait possible. 

That doesn't even count the extremely cruel verbalizing one of my friends possesses, the fact that I've had awful moments in my childhood from family members for not doing things 'right', and the fact that remembering specific past memories make me want to crawl into a hole and just rot (figuratively). 

If anybody can lead me a guidance to what I can do, or where to go, that would be so, so appreciated. Thank you so much in advance.",depression,I don't know how I can like myself.,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4xcpmh/i_dont_know_how_i_can_like_myself/

This weapons will give you opportunities to be able to haul buildings around quickly without needing to worry about getting attacked or dealing with the speed penalty when hauling. If you're a person that doesn't want to even bother with the new menu, no problem! You still get a slight faster time redeploying your buildings to make a more offensive push. 

However, this weapon will be bad in Defense, as the lower metal capacity will make you have to scavenge around more or hug near a Dispenser, Being unable to haul buildings if you so choose to turtle, and being unable to destroy buildings will encourage you to use the new teleporting feature which will be useless if you're supposed to be defending a point or cart.

We're also pretty lax in what you post. Most things here are pretty much an A-okay as long as it relates to PVZ, or the sub itself; also as long as it has some sense into it. If you're worried if your shitpost might get removed, post it to r/pvzcirclejerk as pretty much anything is fair game over there. 

But anywho, we're posting this because we've seen a few instances of people taking it too far. Things such as harsh comments to the moderators and even some people here, are unacceptable. This is supposed to be a very welcoming and friendly sub, and that charm and feeling of being welcome gets lost when there are people that don't act as if we are accepting.

It can be a bit of a tricky one, as countless gargs will be running loose and you need to think ahead on how to beat them. Anywho, let’s get started!
____________________________________________________________________

**Plants**

As you go deeper and deeper into the endless zone, you’ll find that you’re going to be mostly using the same plants again and again. However, in some situations, it’s better to take different plants than others; this mostly depends on the zombies and the plants you bring for combos. So, without further ado, let’s get the roll call going:

*Gold Bloom*: This shouldn’t need too much explanation, Gold Bloom has been a devastating choice since his debut and is more essential than ever in this zone. Sun is going to be very tight in this zone, make sure you use this plant the very second it’s available. Which is right at the start of the level and whenever it recharges. This first slot should always be restricted to Gold Bloom as it’s that important.

*Sun-Shroom/Primal Sunflower*: It’s more preference on what you want out of these two. Sun-Shroom gives you less sun at the start of the level but helps later in the level with stalling Gargantuars and lone zombies with it’s cheap cost and fast recharge. I personally use these cuties more, but again, it’s up to you. Twin Sunflowers also rarely work if you’re feeling a little adventurous

*Thyme Warp*. This fucker is begging and pleading to be used and this is the only place to use him. This guy is almost essential in later levels just because of how amazing the effect is and how long the effect goes for (almost acting like a psuedo-sun producer) and being able to affect every single zombie out there. He will be the main key to starting levels and potentially ending levels (i’ll get to these in a bit)

*Infi-Nut/Chard Guard*: If a level contains any Hair Metals at all, pick Infi-Nut and nothing else here. His ability to tank an infinite amount of shockwaves is an amazing feature and the only plant in the game to have this ability. Ironically, despite being well known for having an incredible plant food, it won’t be needed in this zone. Chard Guard is for when levels once in a blue moon have no Gargantuars in them and can effectively deal with the increased hordes more. 

*Blover/Support Instant*: No, i’m not putting this here because I love the thing to death (maybe), Blover has a very distinct role in this zone, and the amount of tasks you assign her are up to you. She can counter thrown Imps and Breakdancers which both can be a complete pain to deal with. She also combos with several plants with the most notable being the aforementioned Chard Guard, and another plant we’ll get too in a second. If you feel confident without using Blover or just don’t want too, you can replace this slot with any instant of your choosing. Stallia, Shrinking Violet, Iceberg Lettuce, Squash, Explode-O-Nut, and so on. 

*Grapeshot/Cherry Bomb*: Your explosive 3x3 instant. Both plants are incredible for lowering tension on huge hordes. It also is great for when some levels start off with the 8-bit theme: Most Arcade Machines will already be taken care of. Grapeshot has the gift of OH-KO’ing Gargs if placed on the same tile as one. Use this effectively if you have him. If not, Cherry bomb is still an excellent pick and can get the job done.
 
*Primal Peashooter*: Didn’t expect this one, huh? Primal Peashooter’s main goal is to stall gargs from approaching and some early DPS before you place Winter Melons. Some might think that eventually with enough gargs they will overwhelm the P. Peashooters, but with the slowing of the plant below, and the fact that the gargs stop moving when they use their shockwave attack makes them be able to fight/stall them all off with even just one in a lane. He also is an incredible partner to Blover. Spamming Blover to help out the bigger hordes is an effective way to also keep your brain safe. Don’t forget the P. Peashooter plant food + Blover combo!
 
*Winter Melon*: Who else could this slot be taken by? Winter Melon is an extremely powerful choice for both it’s heavy splash damage and slowing effect. The slowing combined with P. Peashooter’s knockback will make sure zombies will be nowhere near your plants. Just one full column of these guys is enough to clear almost any threat this world throws at you. 

But Kabutus, what if I don’t have an 8th slot? Good question, this is where you have to rationalise and really think about what plants you’re brining? Do you think you need Blover? Is Cherry Bomb a good idea? Do you think you can make it without Gold Bloom? It depends on the zombies and what other plants you bring with. Sorry this is vague, but it’s complicated when every plant you bring has a huge importance. 
________________________________________________________________

**Zombie rollcall!** 

This section will describe what kind of enemies you’re dealing with and their weakness’ 

*Punk Zombie:* His punting and jam speeding up zombies can at times be a real pain if it’s the first jam and it’s early. Thankfully, he has very low health and isn’t super fast. If you’re still foraging for the right plants, Magnet-Shroom is not a bad choice to deal with them early on in endless. Puff-Shroom is also a good choice due to being free, unable to die from Punk’s kicking, and Punk zombie having such low health. If you don’t bring either, try to get enough for Winter Melon, or use your support instant if you brought one. 

*Glitter Zombie:* Probably the easiest of the Jams. While her jolly-gay-rainbow trail might be annoying to track specific threats (like gars), her jam slowing zombies down leaves a huge advantage on your plants. P. Peashooter will also push her back and make all the zombies that were before protected, now invulnerable. Save your instants for a harder Jam.
 
*MC-Zombie:* Jesus christ, this guy. Prepare your ass if his jam is first, he can be a real danger early level. Thankfully, Infi-Nut will take a hit from him but not be defeated. Sun-Shrooms are also a great way to stall him due to their low sun cost and fast recharge. P. Peashooter can potentially push them away as they start their spin move and make them waste a second hitting nothing if timed properly. Puff-Shroom is, once again, another great staller if you so happen to bring him. 

*Breakdancer:* Ohohohoho. This is where Blover really shines. Let’s break the ice now: Blover can instantly kill zombies that get pushed by the Breakdancer. Now if you have Thyme Warp out, this is the perfect chance to use him. Once the zombies appear from using Thyme Warp (about a second after they show their white sillouettes), plant a Blover. You will potentially have just placed down a screen nuke. The Breakdancers are defenseless without anybody to push. Be warned, if you don’t have Blover, these guys turn into another level of threat. The best thing you can do here is to try and seperate the Breakdancer with the other zombies as much as possible. Remember that the Breakdancer is slightly faster than the average zombie, meaning that he will catch up to them to push them. In this situation, put down Sun-Shrooms near him so that he has to stop and eat them before he can continue. Doing this a few times should give you enough time to kill the threats in front of him. 

*Important thing to note*: Breakdancers and MC-Zombies will not always show up together; there is a way to tell if either one is approaching though. MC-Zombie hordes will have many record scratch sounds and Breakdancers will make squeaky gym floor sounds. Keep an ear out, this is important to remember!

*8-bit:* The best plant of choice here is your 3x3 bomb. The arcade Machines can make a player very overwhelmed if there are enough on the lawn. Winter Melon is a great distraction while you’re waiting for your bomb to recharge. Also, put down Sun-Shrooms near 8-bit zombies so they have to take more time to push their machines.

*Boombox:* This Jam should almost never be played. Boombox zombies are incredibly weak and need to walk a distance before they can express themselves. And if you really are nervous of him, Phat Beet are never affected by them and are decent in very early endless. If you somehow accidently let one show his true feelings, remember that the current Jam will be shut off, which means that all special jam effects will be off. 

*Hair Metal Gargs:* These guys would be the worst zombies in the game if it weren’t for Infi-Nut. Infi-Nut can take as many shockwaves to the face as possible, and will never get tired out. Having these guys in the front of your defense is necessary for later levels.
________________________________________________________________

Now, let’s take a look at some **in level strategies and situations**. What should you do with these plants now that you have them? What does an average level look like?

Well, once the level starts, use your Goldbloom and Plant Food a Sun-Shroom. If you brought P. Sunflower, Refresh Gold Bloom’s seed packet and use him again. Plant down Infi-Nuts the second they are available, and on column 5. You’re going to need all 5 of them down on the lawn as early as you can. Keep placing your sun producers behind your Infi-Nuts. When the first zombie(s) come(s), don’t attack them. Allow them to reach and numb on you Infi-Nuts for a bit. Use Thyme Warp the second he is available to stall longer and to get some breathing room. From here, plant your Primal Peashooters. One per lane should be fine for now. For the record, a little image of where your plants go should be similar to this:





X = empty space
S = Sun producer
I = Infi-Nut
P = Primal Peashooter
W = Winter Melon


W P S S I x x x x x

W P S S I x x x x x

W P S S I x x x x x

W P S S I x x x x x

W P S S I x x x x x


So basically, fill in what I have above with the correct plants over time and you should be fine. Now, let’s say you have over 4000 sun and don’t really want two lanes of economical plants. If you wish to do this, be very careful, as I also have with you a specific list on where to put them:

W P P W I x x x x x

W P P W I x x x x x

W P P S  I x x x x x

W P P W I x x x x x

W P P W I x x x x x


Now, I say to have one Sun plant in the middle because you’re going to find your sun storage drain extremely fast without anything. Even with Gold Bloom, you’re going to need at least a little extra help. One sun producer should help you gain enough usage for Blover spamming and your instants. 

If everything is setup, you should be able to breeze through the level with no problem. 
_______________________________________________________

**What If Gargs come out early?**

The earliest i’ve seen Gargs and their Jam come out is when I have only one Infi-Nut placed. In these situations, it’s difficult but there are ways around it. 

Let’s say I have I have one Infi-Nut on the middle row, and the gargs spawn. What you’ll want to do is to cover your sun producers and offense behind the Infi-Nut; invest a Winter Melon and P. Peashooter in the same lane. Dig up everything on a lane that does not have an Infi-Nut in them. If you have Grapeshot, save up and use him on a non Infi-Nut lane (Make sure your Infi-Nut rows are protected first), and use the P. Peashooter plant food + Blover combo on lanes that are not adjacent your Winter Melon(s). You might be thinking it’s a waste to use this plant food now, but you can easily get more later. 


If you’re all Tl;Dr in this section, i’ll map it out again for you:

PF = Plant Food this Plant when possible

P(PF)+(Blover)GARGS

x x x x x x x x GARGS

W P S S I x x GARGS

x x x x x x x x GARGS

P(PF)+(Blover)GARGS

From this situation, wisely use Thyme Warp, place down Infi-Nuts when you can and stick P. Peashooters only behind said Infi-Nuts, as Winter Melon’s splash damage will help slow the gargs in nearby lanes. 

And of course, not every level will start with the Metal jam playing, let alone Gargs in every lane, but this is more in the worst case scenario; not every situation similar to this will be this tense or unlucky. 
______________________________________________________________

**What do I do with Plant Food?**

Good question. This is also up to you, but as all endless go, a rule to remember is to *Only use Plant food equivalent to how many flags there are in a level*. So, for example, if a level has 2 flags, I would use a maximum of 2 plant food per level. Keep in mind though, some levels with throw out Plant Food like candy. You are free to use them if this happens, but wouldn’t count on this to happen just so all your plant food can be wasted. 
_____________________________________________________

**Conclusion**

That should be everything, remember to keep your chin up, as this endless zone can at time throw some curveballs at you and deceive you. Do not think this zone is easy as you will probably get your ass, or, well, brain kicked a few times. Good luck, fellow jammers and I hope this guide was a big help!

Here's how it works: Each day, I will create a post for a plant and will link a poll for you to vote the plant a tier.

There will be 5 different tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. Each letter has a different meaning and plants put in these categories will be listed under them after voting is complete (About 24 hours after the post is made)

Here's a key for each tier and what they mean.

**S-tier: Top** -- This section is for the best of the best. Be cautious voting plants here, this tier is only for outstanding plants and can leave an incredible impact on your game. Choosing not to bring these can make a very noticeable change depending on the way you play.

**A-tier: High** -- These are for the plants that are very helpful and lead to great results, but they do have limits and weaknesses. These plants are recommended but they aren't an instant win (No plant really is but you get what I mean).

**B-tier: Mid** -- These plants have opportunities to shine but can at times be held back by their limitations. These plants are nowhere near bad but they aren't excellent either; great things can still be accomplished with the choices in this tier. 

**C-tier: Low** -- These plants are mostly stuck to situational uses for being either too gimmicky or having too many flaws. They have potential to do well, but using them will be risky and players might happen to play at risk. 

**D-tier: Bottom** -- These plants are considered unviable and struggle to fight off the most basic of hordes. Most plants here are still playable but are extremely limited to what they can do. Unless you know exactly how to use these plants and have a backup plan, be very careful. 

And keep in mind, the way these plants will be voted by is how they do in regular levels, and taking everything into consideration. Stuff like how well they can work with others, how consistent they are, and how much they shine in worlds will all be taken to note. Think wisely about how to vote these plants, we want the tier list to be as accurate as possible. 

That's all for now! I will have a poll and display of the tier list ready by tomorrow, I hope all you make great choices and have fun discussing!

The actual theme starts once you finish picking your plants and you begin the level. 

Having a version like that for every world would be great; it's a good tune to build up the tension and brainstorming on what plants you need to bring, and with more intense versions like Lost City and Dark Ages, it kind of ruins the mood when the crescendo hits and you're still deciding either to bring Primal Peashooter or Shadow-Shroom.

Maybe it’s because I played PVZ2 China and find anything to be better than that, but let me back up my reasoning before we get on the hate wagon.

First off, not every plant is being leveled up (as of now). It’s mostly plants that really need it. Thyme Warp really needs to get out of Seizure Checkerboard land and Bloomerang needs to stop being outclassed by literally every plant in the game. If the team were to put this leveling system on, say, Fume-Shroom, Cold Snap, Stallia, or similar High Tier plants, it would be completely inexcusable. 

Another thing, the reason why the leveling system is bonkers in the Chinese version is because a lot of plants earn dumb perks when they level up. Does Iceberg Lettuce really need a projectile? Does Tall-Nut really need to tumble on enemies? Does Fume-Shroom really need to shoot stinky gas that stuns zombies? But from the new leveling system in the original PVZ2, the things we’re getting seem much more reasonable and less bizarre. Intensive Carrot gets to revive plants with more health than usual when fully leveled up. That’s perfect! It gives you more options when using him -- Do you place down a Wall-Nut to save up sun, or do you use Intensive Carrot to use more sun but have the Wall-Nut be more durable?  

And No, thyme warp will not be broken with this leveling system. He’s already balanced in his own world with his atrocious recharge time and fully healing zombies after he finishes his cute dance.

It’s going to be much easier to level up. No puzzle piece bullshit or daily grinding. The only grinding you’ll be doing is basically what you’re doing right now; by just playing the game. I don’t fully understand how the leveling will work, but I think it goes along the lines of plants get experience the more you use them (like a regular RPG), and once a plant gets enough EXP you pay coins to level them up; which is much less than in the Chinese version.

My last point that might seem farfetched, but, this could potentially lower the quantity of future premium plants. Let me explain. To level up plants, you need in-game currency. Some people might not want that, so they’ll buy coin bundles instead. If there are more people buying coin bundles, there’s the chance that premium plants might no longer be needed/needed alot less; which means future plants will be either in epic quests, or even the long waited geminums! 

That’s all I have. I’m sure alot of you have plenty of disagreements, so argue with me below!

Who cares if Wasabi Whip has more range than a Bonk Choy when it doesn't cooperate properly with Winter Melon or Iceberg Lettuce. Stallia? Sure, but it has a slow recharge and does no damage. 

The two best fire plants in the game are Snapdragon and Jack-O-Lantern. The former being outclassed by its ice counterpart and the latter having a slow recharge and needs support to break between waves.

To conclude, Wasabi Whip has several better traits than Bonk Choy but it's fire trait will hold it back in some levels. Or, Just stick with Winter Melon/ColdSnap and you'll be fine.

First off, he doesn't level up like other plants; this might seem bad at first, but it's a good thing because of how much he's buffed in this version. Even though it says he's level 1, it feels like he's actually a level 3 plant. 

Second, leveled up zombies have more health, and are able to give you a profit much bigger than before. By the time you get Sun Bean, you already have to deal with level 3 and 4 zombies. If you have a plant like Acid Lemon or any other strong leveled up cheep attacker with Sun Bean, you're guaranteed to get a mass load of profit - even with Basic Zombies! 

Something else too about Sun Bean is that he seems to give you more sun in this version. Maybe it's just me, but it feels like the bits of sun you earn from zombies are worth more than in the international version. If that's true, then that's an incredible buff to an already great benefit from the leveling system. With the insane amount of sun you have, Tile Turnip also becomes more viable. It's possible to get 4 power tiles in a standard level with just Sun Bean and Sun-Shrooms (These things are broken as fuck too.) 

One more thing: *Sun Bean, for whatever reason, can be used in Last Stand levels*. Unlike any other economical plant in the game, Sun Bean is usable almost anywhere! This can be a huge life savoir on those daily training levels or levels that adds extra bullshit like limited plant usage and Mold tiles. 

If you have Sun Bean, please give him a try! He definitely deserves some more love and this really *is* his game.

Blover is one of the best plants in the game, by far. It counters many zombies, is extremely cheep, very fast recharge, and can combo with tons of plants (and zombies). This guide will go over what he mainly counters, how the effect works, and of course, the combos. 

**The effect - what is it? What does he do?**

For 50 sun, you're basically throwing out an anti-aircraft nuke on the screen for a few seconds. Anything that is, or becomes a flying/floating zombie by the game's code will be flung to the far right of the screen to never be seen again. That's right, they never come back, and are considered killed. With that alone, this Plant would help greatly in high levels of Endless, where flying zombies could very easily overwhelm the player. 

You do have to remember one thing though which is both good and bad for Blover: The timing. When you Plant Blover, it takes about half a second before it's effect takes place (pretty much once his animation shows him blowing (hehehhe)), but, it's effect also stays on for a very long time, up to a second even after he disappears from the board! 

*Another fact about Blover:* Once the game says a zombie has been affected by Blover, it will stay being affected until it lands the ground, which will then get flung and killed. So, basically, even if you plant one a little early against a thrown imp, that imp could still be hit at the very end of the duration, and because it got hit by the duration once, it will stay that away and die; no zombie can escape the effect once they're caught by it. And the best way to find out if a zombie was affected by Blover or not is if it shakes alot before it hits the ground (best seen with thrown imps)  
_________________________________________________________________

**Direct Counters**

This area would be a mess to type on it's own, so I'm going to separate each zombie into different sections - the world's they appear in.

*All worlds:* In every world, there lies a garg. And every garg will throw imps! Blover can get rid of those imps when they're flying towards your 3rd column.
_______________________________________________________________

*Ancient Egypt:* There are no flying/floating zombies in this world minus the thrown imps. You don't have to worry about bringing Blover here
_____________________________________________________

*Pirate Seas:* Holy fuck, this one plant can make the world entirely useless. Let's go down the list.

- Seagulls: They're always going to be flying. Blow them away!

- Swashbucklers: They don't stand a chance when they're trying to land. Use Blover anytime they're trying to come down (they take two swings to get on the board) and you're good to go

- Barrel Rollers: The imps that come out are in the air for a brief second before they land. If there's  alot coming your way, plant a Blover and then a Cherry Bomb or Grapeshot immediately after

- Pirate Captain: Using Blover anytime while the parrot is not in the Captain's hat will make them go away forever

- Imp cannons: Anytime an imp flies from the cannon, that's your chance to Blover. However, the timing on this one is a little bit strict. It's better to just kill it head on rather than timing with Blover alot.

There you go. Over half of the zombies in this world are heavily affected by this one plant. we're not even close to done yet.
________________________________________________________

*Wild West:* Not as useful as Pirate Seas, but there a few things that can help here

- Prospectors: These guys can be annoying as fuck without the game forcing you to use gimmicky plants like the Split-Pea. Planting Blover while their dynamite explodes will negate them and not have you waste seed slots

- Bull riders: Another annoying zombie negated by Blover. You have to watch the timing on this one, it can take a little while before the bull flings the imp. As soon as the Bull starts to hop back, readying to fling it, plant a Blover and your problems will be gone
____________________________________________________________

*Far Future:* The world that Blover came from (How did it manage to find it's way here anyway?) 

- Jetpacks: Easy as it sounds. You see them flying, plant a Blover and they're gone.

- Disco Jetpacks: They only appear from Disco-trons, and spawn in fours every 6-8 seconds. Blover can take out every wave easily.

- Bug bots: This one isn't as common, and it happens more by change rather than reflexes. When Bug Bots spawn, they will drop from the sky to land on the ground. During this very short time, if a Blover is active, all of them will fly away so they don't have to be a bother. Though, I wouldn't count on this tactic unless you plan on spamming Blover every 5 seconds (which you could do)
___________________________________________________________

*Dark Ages:* Nothing, just pick Fume-Shroom and you're good to go
__________________________________________________________

*Big Wave Bitch:* Nothing here either, you're in hell. Of course Blover isn't helpful here. Don't even try to blow away the Octopi, It just will not work. 
_________________________________________________________

*Forstbite Caves:* Dodo's when flying can't handle Blover. It also is better with the gargs in this world because they throw 3 imps instead of 1
___________________________________________________________

*Lost City:* Quite a few zombies you can counter here, the most noticeable being...

- Bug Zombie: If it weren't for Blover, this thing probably would be the most annoying zombie in the whole game. Just make sure you use Blover before it dies and drops it's carried zombie

- Explorers: Again, could be a really annoying zombie if it weren't for Blover, but he shuts them down completely. 

**Warning about this world**: Lost Pilots are the one true zombie that can counter Blover. When they're in the air/tangled, using a Blover will make them all fall down right away instead of them doing it on their own. However, this shouldn't be too much of a problem as these guys aren't very tough to begin with. And either way, if they land on a tile with a plant on them, they'll gobble up the plant anyway
__________________________________________________________________________

*Neon Mixtape Tour:* Only one zombie works here, but holy hell, does it work

- Breakdancer: Seen as one of the most frustrating zombies in the whole game, Blover can take care of that well. If you see a Breakdancer getting close, or they're offscreen and you hear squeaky footsteps, Blover that shit. This is especially great in endless since they can appear so often, and another strategy that I will get to later

_________________________________________________________________________________

*Jurassic Marsh:* No zombies can fly on their own, but they can be vulnerable with a little help...

- Raptors: Their kick can fling a zombie forward. Use Blover a second before he will kick them and you should be fine. Please note too: Raptors will not kick zombies until they pace back and forth once when they spawn. So don't use Blover too early!

- Stegosaurus: This is a better Dino to try on. Groups of strong zombies (especially gars) are no longer a thread once you use Blover. You can tell when the zombie is about to be flung when their sprite stops moving and they're standing still. Once you see that, plant a Blover

**Warning about this world**: Pterodactyl's and Ankylosaurus's are not affected by Blover. This is when you try using other plants, or fall into depression. 
_________________________________________________________________________

*Modern Day:* Everything that is mentioned above will come back full circle here. Even without old zombies coming back, there is still zombies exclusive in this world that get hit by Blover too:

- Balloon Zombie: Just your typical Bug Zombie reskin. Blover can get the job done.

- Super Fan Imp: I don't see this roaming around alot, but when this little guy is punted by Football (I know his name is All-Star but I don't give a shit) zombie, that entire time he is in the air, he is vulnerable to Blover. Don't be afraid to try him out!
_______________________________________________________________

**Now for the fun part... combos!**

Blover can combo with a handful of plants, and they all work grealty (except for one.) I'll go over these combos one by one. 

- Chard Guard: One of the more basic and best combos with Blover. When Chard Guard flings a zombie(s) backwards, they're, well, flung! Blover can kill them instantly if the effect is on when the zombies are flung. This combo works well because of how many zombies Chard Guard can fling. The biggest example being Gargs, which is very helpful. His PF can also be great as it can fling zombies in his adjacent lane. Be careful though, make sure that the zombies are only 1 tile away from the Chard Guard. If they are 2 tiles or more away, they will not be affected. 

- Primal Peashooter: Somehow, Somewhere in physics, the heavy knockback from Primal Peashooter can work with Blover. However, this one is more luck based. If the pea didn't push the zombie back, the effect will not work. However, one way to guarantee knockback is with P. Peashooter's Plant food. Before feeding him PF, plant Blover and then watch the magic happen. If the zombies are bunched, you could potentially take out an entire row of zombies! 

- Spring Bean: This combo is so fucking broken. Don't use it unless you wanna be a cheep asshole. Spring Bean only flings one zombie up, which at that time the zombie is bounced up, Blover can blow the zombie away. But, if you feed a Spring Bean Plant Food, every single zombie (with the exception of zombies that don't move like King and Fisherman zombies) will bounce back, and all of them can be blown away by Blover. But I guess, it's kinda balanced because for it to work, you have to be very PF hungry, and you also have to waste a seed slot for Spring Bean, which is a pretty bad plant.

- Thyme Warp: This combo is exclusive to Neon Mixtape Tour, and kinda situational, but it can help. Especially late in endless. If you see Breakdancers before a levels starts, take Blover and Thyme Warp with you. When the rap theme starts playing, and there is at least one breakdance in every lane, use a Thyme Warp, and send everybody back to the start. All of the zombies will be grouped together, which will trigger the Breakdance to push all of them forward. If you plant a blover before they start to spin (Best time is when they show their white silhouettes) Then every single zombie except the breakdancers will be flung off the screen! A fantastic help for endless when you just need a break and to get sun back (Remember that this combo in total only costs 125 sun!)  

- Guacodile: This is another situational combo, but can save you in a pinch if you have both Guacodile and Blover. Get this, when you use a Plant Food on Guacodile, and zombies are very close to it, they will jump back for some reason. You can use Blover to push these zombies away as the Guacodile readies his PF effect. This can come in handy incase there's a garg that spawns a little too early, or any other strong zombie. The combo in total costs 175 sun, and one Plant Food, but it can still help even if not as effective.  

- Cherry Bomb/Grapeshot: Just another remainder on what to do against Barrel Rollers. Place a Blover, and then immediately Cherry Bomb/Grapeshot. Another thing too, if you plan on using a 3x3 instant on a garg and you plan on using Blover to counter the thrown imp, place the Blover **after** you plant your 3x3 instant.

- Dandelion: This combo is much different than the other ones, and has a completely different effect. If a Blover is planted on the same row, or a tile adjacent to a Dandelion, the Dandelion will blow away about 10-15 of it's pedals at once. The problem with this though, is that your Dandelions become vulnerable for the same ammount of time as a slow recharge for a plant, and the ability isn't even that powerful anyway. Bottom line, stick with the above combos, or...

- Power Toss: This one I never see talked about, probably because it's about a powerup rather than an actual plant. 
When you use the Power Toss powerup, you have to flick a zombie twice and then they go away. It's pretty strong on it's own, but having to do that extra flick can slow you down if you're just trying to clear the screen. However, if you plant a Blover, zombies only need to be flicked once and then they're all taken care of! This can greatly speed up the productivity that lies in your finger. 
__________________________________________________________________

One last thing before we wrap things up: Blover can be used in any world, however, it is restricted in a few endless zones:
Here are the endless zones Blover can and cannot appear in:

**Can appear:**

- Dead Man's Booty (PS)

- Big Bad Butte (WW)

- Terror from Tomorrow (FF)

- Temple of Bloom (LC)

- Greatest Hits (NMT)

- La Brinsa Tarpits (JM)

- Highway to the Danger Room (MD)

**Cannot appear:**

- Pyramid of Doom (AE)

- Arthur's Challenge (DA)

- Tiki Torch-er (BWB. Fuck.)

- Icebound Battleground (FBC) (I don't get this one, but whatever.)
___________________________________________________________________

So, what have we learned about Blover today, kids?

- Can counter tons of zombies
- Combos well with other plants
- Only costs 50 sun with a fast recharge; amazing for how useful it is
- Effect stays on much longer than it should
- Cute as fuck, especially with it's costume 
- Can be used in evey world, and many endless zones. 
- /u/Kabutus_Crepitus is the greatest and you know it &lt;3

I will edit this guide incase I find more things about him or clear some mistakes I might find later. Thanks for reading, and have fun with causing hell with a little green clover. 

EDIT: Did some cleaning up and added the missing Thyme Warp section. 

EDIT 2: Added 2 more combos in the combo section (Guacodile and Cherry Bomb), and gave a few warnings and remainders for some worlds in the counters section

EDIT 3: Added lines and extra spaces so the guide looks less clunked. This guide is also featured on the sidebar. Thank you all for the compliments &lt;3

For both an aesthetic, and organisation change, an idea I had is if all plants in the shadow family had a dark purple border around their seed packet; similar to the gold border for premium plants. 

This way, the seed packets look a little less bland, and Popcap can easily add more Shadow Plants in the future without having to worry if people will get confused by if it is or not.
