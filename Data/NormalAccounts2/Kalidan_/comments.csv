1,"Here is a closer view of my placeholder representing the [Horneater Peaks](http://imgur.com/dYkJRRt). I'll have to add the snow around the pools to give it the hotsprings feel.

I've used that second map for my initial idea for the shattered plains, but have yet to actually model it. I'm not sure if that map represents half of just 1/4th mirrored.",2016-04-05 12:33:23+00:00,d1qlaq4,6,t1_d1q3u0j,41383,Stormlight_Archive

3,"The shattered plains will have to wait actually I think for Sanderson to release a map, I have a rough idea of how they are looking, but since we know they have certain properties as far as their layout I wanted to hold off until more information(assuming book 3 will go into more detail) is revealed.

Do you have any ideas on the shard pools are how they would look?",2016-04-05 00:43:03+00:00,d1q2yih,4,t1_d1q286y,1069,Stormlight_Archive
4,"Great suggestion! I like the idea of this being a community project, working with the knowledge we already have to piece it together.

5,Well that's what's great about this project as no serious level of 3D skill is required since most of it is low poly and does not need detail. Honestly if you wanted to try your hand at making some buildings that I could include in Kharbranth or any other city it would be a huge help.,2016-04-05 00:21:33+00:00,d1q22yt,2,t1_d1q10ig,1588,Stormlight_Archive

15,"We were in college and being students never had to much money. She went to a different state with plans of me coming down in a year or so, as we thought long distance would not be so bad. Over that year it became harder to stay in contact due to different friends schedules and activities (the usual pains with long distance). 

I started to have feelings for another girl that I was hanging out with. (*Being young and exposed to a collage environment with countless opportunities I struggled to decide what situation I would be happier in.*)  I did not want to lie, but also hated hurting peoples feelings I choose to limit my contact with the local girl.

One evening I was drinking with a group of friends (*girl of local interest being there*) when I made the decision to call my SO and break it off with her. She was heartbroken being her first serious long term relationship. That was the end of it for a while...

Another year passes and I finally had enough scholarships to attend the school where we both intended to go initially. By this time, my local relationship fizzled out, and we were talking again. So I was excited the the prospect of being together in person again.

One month before I set out to move down and start the school year I flew in to visit her after working most the summer to save for a plane ticket. Upon arrival she picked me up from the airport and I knew immediately something was different in her from the past few months we were talking. After arriving at her dorm I had the pleasure of meeting the guy she was with for a couple weeks. 

She told me that she wanted to see me, and thought that as soon as we were in person again, her feelings would dissipate for him and reignite for me and everything would be great again. That did not happen. After two days of sleeping on her couch, and my plane not leaving for another week. I could not stand to be in that place anymore, and bought myself a greyhound home.

It's been years since that event but still echos in my head sometimes. I did not realize how much I hurt her until I was in her position. I'd like to think we inflicted an even amount of pain upon each other and call it even. We are still friends, and call and talk for about an hour maybe twice a month, it's hard to leave someone behind when they were also your best friend.

**TLDR;** We both broke each others hearts over the course of a couple years, instead of just being honest about what we wanted.",2015-08-19 12:47:47+00:00,cu86klq,1,t3_3hiht2,47676,AskReddit
