Though throughout the next book Calamity refuses to help the Reckoners and says he is not allowed to interfere.

I realize that it's his sole purpose to grant these powers and that is all Regalia was asking for, but he still chose sides to aid her with her goals. These goals happened to line up with his own, but still seems like he would get in trouble just for stacking epics on one side of the scale.

I've been working on this map of Roshar in my free time but have approached a barrier. Creating a detailed world that would be worthy of representing a Sanderson work(especially one where he is focusing on ""world building"") is a huge effort.

**I'm inviting anyone who would like to critique, give ideas, facts, or even help model Roshar to come and join in on this project.** 
I have sifted through information on Wiki's and referenced the illustrations from the books, but I feel I'm not getting a big enough picture.

How this project could use your help:

* Post relevant information about the world of Roshar.
* Critique any ideas on the project that would improve it as a whole.
* Help model parts of the world (I'm using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) as my 3D package but always can import 3D data from other programs.)
  
I'm looking forward to making this a fun project that will expand over the course of The Stormlight Archives series as Brandon reveals more and more of his world with us.

Thank You
