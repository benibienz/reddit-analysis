99,"The only differences between a4 and a5 are the enemies they face. A4 is in that sweetspot in which it doesn't get uptiered much, but also gets downtiered into 3.3 quite often. 

My tips:

- climb with WEP @ 230-260kph IAS until you see an opportunity

- 4 20mms spread quite a bit, but that just makes it easier for them to converge, and when they do, they kill whatever they hit

- If you find something like a p38 or a spit on your 6', you can use your roll rate to evade their guns, if you do it right, they have literally no right to hit you, unless they start spraying (which they dont usually do, especially the spits - tfw 60 rounds per gun)

- If you're 1vs1, force the bandit into rolling scissors, then use the roll rate and destroy him. At 4.3 BR almost every opponent you'll face you can kill in rolling scissors. 

- Most times you'll be fighting allied teams, sometimes soviet and i dont remember the last time i fought japs in the a4. You can win with every allied plane except some of their captured planes. With soviets it's tougher, your main enemy will be yak3s(also P versions which are the most deadly for you), la5s, i185 and yak9ts. All those planes are very solid and will demolish you in 1vs2s.

I would not engage in dogfights with yak3s, only BnZ. With La5s you can sometimes even win 1vs2s if you're lucky. I185 is the soviet 190, but you should be able to beat it in a 1vs1. Yak9ts, you can just evade all day. They'll have a very hard time hitting you with their 37mm, and the single .50 cal doesn't do much. Easy 1vs1, 1vs2 can be tough but duable.

- Use stealth on the 7mms, air targets on 20mms. Then the 7mm wont obsruct your aim with the 20mms if you're firing them both.

- One of my tricks when im on somebody's tail on a longer distance (&gt;700m) i spray the 7mms around them. Quite often, when they hit and even do no damage, the enemy panics and starts turning left or right. Then i lead and shoot the 20mms when they close in. This works suprisingly often. 

That's all i had in my head right now, anyone who knows better or more please add to this, or say that something i said was bullshit. I'm definitely not the best pilot, dont take anything i said for granted.",2016-09-17 17:53:06+00:00,d7qrjf7,3.0,t1_d7qo6r3,5130.0,Warthunder

436,"&gt;Plus they can block your wounds with a cloth or bandage and continue their fun.

&gt;""Legs tend initially to move slower than arms and to maintain more static positions. However, areas of the lower trunk and upper thigh are rich with vascularity. A suspect who's hit there can bleed out in seconds if one of the major arteries is severed, so again shooting just to wound may not result in just wounding.""

From [here.](https://www.pfoa.co.uk/110/shooting-to-wound)

&gt;Its easy to hit somones legs if your gun fires 600 rounds per minute.

&gt;Shooting is hard. Even a well trained marksman still won't be able to hit a moving leg most of the time. If you're shooting someone, you better be prepared to kill them because while most bullets aren't fatal even if they aren't in the leg, it's basically impossible to choose whether your shot will kill or not. And if you're planning on shooting someone, you'll have the best chance of hitting if you shoot towards the bigger target- their chest.

From [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2nx6yj/eli5why_arent_cops_trained_to_shoot_the_leg_or_a/cmhqfp5)

Also, if you are shooting full auto at a guy running away, you won't be able to maintain a group so tight that you only hit his legs. And if you actually are, then every second of shooting at him would be 10 bullets in his body. That's why people don't shoot to wound, except for action movies and call of dutys.",2015-10-25 14:20:38+00:00,cwc5zmy,5.0,t1_cwc3hj4,7003.0,watchpeopledie

Sudennly few legionarries come from some bushes on the side of the road and head to me. One of them says that you've upset the caesar and we're here to assasinate you.
