This is what i've been using for quite a while, built it when i was noob with pcs and thought intel was a rip off because their cpu had ""same stats"" (4 cores + 3,20GHZ = 12,80GHZ!!!) and was 700 PLN more expensive. Anyways, since i had it i upgraded the gpu from a 550ti to a 960 and when i started being more interested in my 'machine' i noticed i have a psu of unknown reputation (Modecom Feel III, 500w). So im looking to replace it. I was thinking of getting  corsair CX430M, but i heard that its for basic systems only and everyone seems to bash people that decided to get it. I think my rig is pretty basic and low end, however im looking to upgrade my cpu to a 4690k, as well as my motherboard because that thing wont get into am3. I wanted to ask if that psu would still be okay for the pc, and if not i'd need to find something else in the price range.

Used to have some old case with no airflow, decided i should get some actual decent case, so i got the 230t. The problem is, that my mobo has only one fan header, and the case has 3 fans. Also, ironically, i didnt find a header for the usb3, on a board that advertises its support for it on the whole box.
