2,"Is it regarding a winger being a bonus or something like that?

5,"Lallana is naturally more of a No. 8 than an inverted winger imo. I mean, yeah, he has played AM all his life until this season, but I've always thought that his attributes suit playing behind a little better. Because he doesn't contribute massively in terms of goals and is able to make use of his incredible individual pressing better.

TL;DR: Think Klopp sees Lallana in the position the same as Gini, Can etc. Coutinho is our only inverted winger.",2016-11-21 16:54:03+00:00,da9opxm,5.0,t1_da9okyx,174.0,LiverpoolFC
6,He's a winger. So just staying on the wing would be good enough considering it's our shallowest position apart from LB/RB. Young + quality + fills a need. Perfect buy imo. But it probably means we're not going for Pulisic.,2016-11-21 16:50:00+00:00,da9oizn,3.0,t1_da9oci6,225.0,LiverpoolFC

11,"This is what happens when you've got a legit chance to win the title. Every game counts. Every game is important to the players. Even a 0-0 away draw against a mid-table club causes players to be sombre. That's good attitude.

But Klopp is also right. He's the manager and it's his job to make sure that the players being sombre does not extend to their next game. Granted, it's Sunderland and it's at Anfield, and a win would mean that the players would forget what has happened at Southampton, but it's still terrible if they feel sad going into trainings for the whole week till the next match. Klopp doesn't want that at Melwood and he's trying to stop it. That's great man-management.",2016-11-21 11:39:55+00:00,da9e7jn,1.0,t3_5e3ax8,6094.0,LiverpoolFC

17,"That's because we defended well enough to not have an insane amount of defending to do. Puel and Southampton started parking the bus midway through the match because they realised it's too tough to break our defense down, so it isn't worth it.

29,"Did you recently become a fan? (Because your most hated players all played for us recently LOL).

I'd say, Paul Konchesky and Christian Poulsen as the obvious ones. Both were never good enough to play for a club like ours. Andy Carroll, not just because of his price-tag, but he literally killed any sort of offense we have had because he's the only slow ass on the pitch compared to the rest of our attack then, and he couldn't hold the ball up for shyt.

And then, there's Djimi Traore who (funnily enough) was a big part of why we were 0-3 down at Istanbul (re-watch his stupid fly-in tackles that amounted to nothing and opened up spaces for Crespo, Shevchenko etc.), but no one cares because.. it's Istanbul.",2016-11-20 11:20:16+00:00,da82f5j,1.0,t3_5dxm0v,393.0,LiverpoolFC
30,"Wijnaldum is also playing in the most fluid soccer team and a league topper. Playing behind arguably the most in-form front trio in the world, a DM who's holding passing-related records and a very well-improved Adam Lallana. He 'seems' average because our team has been so fckin' good. You can't compare them like that. You don't expect every player on a title-contending squad to be as good as the rest.

He contributes by doing the 'dirty work'. His half-turn is better than Emre's allowing the ball to be moved forward more fluidly, his hold-up play for a midfielder is the best in the squad. His vision is underrated (notice how he always picks the right pass) and his movement without the ball is intelligent. Everyone only sees what happens when a player gets the ball, but not when a player runs without it. His technique is terrible, body is rather stiff and finishing's weak. But he offers all the little-detailed things that are hard to get noticed.

Wijnaldum isn't better than Hendo, Lallana and Emre. And for a super-sub, he isn't average. An average player comes in and contributes nothing while looking invisible. Wij looks invisible because he's playing alongside a bunch of studs. He still contributes quite a bit, so he isn't average.",2016-11-20 07:16:15+00:00,da7y8mw,8.0,t1_da7a2rh,41462.0,LiverpoolFC

37,"I agree that Coutinho shouldn't have started, but he actually stepped it up later on in the game which makes keeping him on justified. Sturridge was actually very lazy considering he's a sub who just came on. He did have a good cross, did have a few hold-up plays, but all those 50-50 balls, he just let the defenders got to them and tried to pick them out, when he should have ran at full speed, wrestle and try to capitalize.

Coutinho shouldn't have started, but subbing Sturridge in for him earlier than he did (not for him tho) wouldn't have been better.",2016-11-19 17:48:04+00:00,da75art,8.0,t1_da74g2r,1293.0,LiverpoolFC

Klopp's mentality is incredible. People call this a 'ruthless' business and the everything is cruel etc., but Klopp's thinking is the prototypical 'good man' thought. Alot of 'moral of the story' quotes here.

I specifically agree with him saying he would rather let the players play freely even when they're playing shite instead of reprimanding because they already know that they made a mistake. I can relate to that well, because my basketball coach used to reprimand every shyt that we do and would even call names etc. I didn't react well to him. I used to be freakin' scared of trying to take on defenders myself in an actual match because I was afraid I would miss and get reprimanded. The coach's shouts were always in my head.

Hence, he should be able to coach different positions well since he has experience in not just playing them, but playing them at a high level.

Then, you go on to his potential man-management skills. As you said, passion, so we can put that aside. He's also an inspirator who knows no fear, as you can tell from Istanbul where he confidently pushed everyone's spirit up eventho Liverpool were against tremendous odds. He's also known for his clutch strikes that won us games. So, pressure situations aren't gonna scare him, which means he should be able to handle his teams being down a goal well. He's also a captain for more than a decade, the best that Liverpool have seen and one of the best the world would recognize. So, leadership is never a problem and he is gonna be in control of the locker room and the players are gonna listen to him. He's also calm and collected (even Carra can't proclaim himself that) and that aura is gonna have an impact on his players everytime they see him.

When you think of all the successful managers and how they aren't even half the player he is with half the experience he has had, you can't deny that Stevie has as great a chance of succeeding as a coach as anyone.

He had to start from scratch at Metz (where it is still difficult to notice) and work his way up. On the other hand, Sterling immediately entered an English academy once he's of age. Scouts don't even need to fly around to notice him. He's just right there, in this very country.

Klopp noticed him when he was 20. He could very well have been a Dortmund player at 20. So naming a weaker league does not mean anything.

But things have changed for us. We've got a manager that players would die to play for. I understand that people like to use Suarez as a basis for this, but the situations are different. First off, as good as Coutinho is now, he's still merely a talent. Suarez is always gonna start for any team he plays for. He's other-worldly. Coutinho is great, but he has not much power in terms of speaking with his talent right now. Secondly, Suarez requested to leave a few times prior. Coutinho has always been contented about playing in Liverpool and deep down, I've got a feeling that he's grateful to us for allowing him to nurture his talent after being called a 'flop' in Inter (massive assumption, of course). Lastly, Suarez has always wanted Barca as his final destination since young. Of course, it may be Coutinho's but he never said it publicly, so there's the benefit of doubt.

I know you didn't mention Suarez's move at all in your argument, but I do know that alot of our fans have that move in mind and worry that the same situation's gonna happen again.

Yeah, INT breaks fkin' sux. But hey, we are going through this one on top of the table, it's the best one if it's allowed to have a best one. :)",2016-11-12 09:43:14+00:00,d9x0xn5,7.0,t1_d9x0tb6,455.0,LiverpoolFC
298,"In the world of football, players are hardly judged by trophies. Because fans know every league have different weightage of significance in them. Of course, La Liga is a top league, but winning a few more there doesn't mean he's gonna be seen as a much greater talent. Gerrard barely won trophies with us, but what a fkin' legend he is to neutral's eyes. He wouldn't even be this popular or recognized if he had moved somewhere else and just be 'one of them pieces'. He's still more famous than say, Lampard and Terry, because he poured his heart out in red. And that one Istanbul title means so much to neutral not just because it was a miraculous game, but also the fact that it's fresh seeing Liverpool win something big again. Winning 4 PL titles with us is gonna mean a world more and cement Coutinho legacy as a player (since he'd probably be our best player) than say, winning 4 La Ligas in a team that's already used to winning them and in the shadows of MSN.

Trophies are only for his own personal cabinets at home to look fuller. And we are gearing up to become 'trophy contenders' now. That's part of the appeal we have now. The past is the past, we are gonna be fighting hard for them from now on.

&gt; Who wouldnt want to play alongside Messi, Neymar and Saurez and challenge for the league every season and the champions league every year too?

299,"That's what I meant by non-footballing reasons. The sun and Neymar/Suarez for all they're worth.

But we are moving towards consistent CL appearances if we can play like this every season, which I have no doubt we can considering this is just Klopp's first season at Anfield. Are you kidding me? We are this good with only 1 pre-season under him, and 1 window of players. Even at Dortmund, where he eventually won 2 titles and 2 2nd-placed finishes, he didn't get into it this quick. Dortmund were mid-table 1 or 2 years before rising to the top in a weaker league. I don't see why we can't be a perennial Top 4 team.

Yes, but Coutinho won't be playing much with them. Their team is stacked. He's not replacing Neymar, which plays his primary position, and can only look to replace Iniesta (not now even, Iniesta is still good, just needs more rest) in the middle of the pitch with competitions from Denis Suarez, Andre Gomes and Arda Turan etc. He's not going to get consistent football eventhough he's in better form than the aforementioned. Heck, he might not even play this well if he doesn't get the groove of playing every game. At Liverpool, he's gonna get minutes and be recognized as our star-man. If he wants recognition, staying is actually better.

I do agree that playing there is an honour especially for a South American, but Ballon' dor? Nope. He's on the same team with Neymar even after Suarez and Messi retire, he's gonna get outshone. Again, if he wants to be recognized, staying is a better option.

Of course, I agree with those final parts. I'm not saying that Coutinho is 100% committed, because it's Barca and Barca is Barca.

301,"The only appeal I can get is for non-footballing reasons. That may be substantial enough depending on the person involved and I don't rule out Couts in that regard, but I won't understand the footballing part of it.

Barca have been able to consistently enter the CL, first and foremost, because La Liga is very top 3 concentrated. It isn't difficult if you've got a world-class squad far and away more talented than majority of the league. And after entering CL, they still have to fight like the rest of them, it's not as if they are guaranteed the trophy or something or steamrolling every team 5-0 easily. They can even lose in the group stages to teams like City if they draw them.

I'm a competitive person, and I do sense that Coutinho is one too (I'm assuming, of course). Playing in La Liga has its appeal, but for a competitive guy, I'd rather fight in the PL, than just relax and play to 50% while letting other guys win the game 5-0, which is just boring.

And let's face it, Gerrard's LOYALTY alone means he deserves 1 title at least. He could have went to you guys when Jose wanted him and get a few medals easy. Could have went to Utd or Madrid but he stayed at his boyhood club because he has always been a fan of it. It's all about sentiments and values when talking about Gerrard deserving a title.

Put aside our rivalries and think of it as a neutral. There's not many players out there who deserve to smell the PL trophy at least once apart from Gerrard.

He had all the years to build the team he wants, that's capable of winning 2 straight seasons of Europa League. He had transfer windows after transfer windows to get players. And that's the Sevilla you saw last season - Emery's team.

And Klopp? Came in mid-season over to a 10th placed team. No pre-season to full-on drill his tactics and no window to get his players. And yet he got them to 2 finals.

For further evidence, look at Emery at PSG now. A new team, but a team that just won it all last year. They aren't topping the league at all, eventhough we all know how great a coach Emery is, in a league that can be seen as 'PSG and the rest' with their state of money. This just shows how fckin' difficult it is to inherit someone else's team and immediately do well.

I don't get why you guys brush this off as 'no big deal, coming into a new team mid-season isn't a significant disadvantage at all.' YES, IT IS. It's fckin' difficult to get a new team to achieve things in your first season. Emery is having trouble with it with a team like PSG's caliber.

Sure, but you don't say it publicly. It does you no good. It spoils team spirit and it gives a bad impression to your coach.

Arguable. They had 3 managers in a row who underperformed. Moyes was a consistent manager for Everton and quite proven in PL but disappointed. Van Gaal was quite a renowned coach having coached Barca and Bayern beforehand and got the Netherlands playing well before appointment but disappointed. And now, Mourinho, a Top 3 coach in the world AND a proven champion coach in PL and is showing signs of disappointment.

I'm amused by people backing Pogba up as if 'there is no way he can be shite!' He has done well in Serie A and was mega-hyped for the last few years as one of France's upcoming stars and landed himself a world-record price tag. He can't be shite!

Except when you logically think about it, yes, he's done well for Juve.. In a league where no other midfields even come close to matching Juve's stars. Also, playing alongside Pirlo, Marchisio, Vidal against teams like Torino, Cagliari? Even a commoner playing there could find alot of space because everyone has to worry about all 5 midfield players of Juve.

Scored crazy goals in Serie A, won Ballon dor and came to Chelsea and played shittily. He had so many years to 'adapt', but his tenure just continued being shite. Kaka at Madrid is another instance.

Sure, he has made some mistakes doing so, but he's still young. There aren't many keepers that can read the game from the back and if Karius keeps on developing this foundation of his game, we would have a rare keeper here.

Migs, what else needs to be said? Just a typical, traditional, old-school keeper focused on making saves with little offensive game.

If he decides to go baseline, he hits a right-footed shot into the stands because his right foot just isn't good enough. Lastly, Ronaldo scores alot but also looks for a key pass or cross. This versatility allows defenders to stay honest with him, because they don't know what they'll be getting, creating space for him to operate. Sturridge does not have an eye for the pass. It's just not his game. Defenders know what they're getting, and that's a cut-in left-footed shot and they can take away that angle easily. Coutinho is a great example, where defenders always seem to be wary of his cut-in shots, but his class through passes confuse them enough to make him effective.

Milner is known as one of the most versatile players in PL who can essentially play all 10 outfield positions because he's just that smart. Hendo is a workaholic whose work rate allows him to defend the middle of the park while his passing range allows him to launch accurate long-balls from the DM spot.

Too bad we are winning and we don't need him that much right now. As a sportsperson myself, I can attest that no matter how good a player you are, if you don't play a few full games in a row, you'd feel as if you're not on the same wavelength as the other players on the court.

With that said, if Can gets his needed series of games, he'd be at his best whether its 5 or 10 games. It's just that we can't afford to have him play through his rough form because we are doing so well and every game matters to us now since we are fighting for the title.

But what's certain is that Can's ceiling is definitely higher than Gini's. Gini is in his prime now and Can is only 22. Yet, Can at his best of his best is already better than Gini's best. Gini is a very consistent performer, that's his strength and he's also intelligent and quick with his passing and movement. But physically and talent-wise, Can is better. I disagree with Gini being better with the ball at his feet, shooting and passing (long-range specifically) because I think Can is as good if not better in those. Quicker ways to move the ball does not equate to being a better passer. Gini's shots are also placement shots that are weak. He'd rather hit it on target than hit it hard, which is why he hasn't gotten a goal yet, because alot of his shots go straight into the keepers' hands. Can is a strong shooter. Not an accurate one, but his chances of scoring isn't anywhere below Gini's. Gini also isn't that good with the ball at his feet. His hold-up play is good because he's intelligent in using his stable base to hold the ball up, but in terms of technical ability, I'd take Can.

Can and Hendo isn't your prototypical CDMs. They are both box-to-box players who are being played by Klopp as CDMs to great effect. If they both play, they can switch their roles at any part during the game. Hendo stays behind when Can moves up and vice versa. This versatility will make a great midfield if it materializes.

And selling Can is just stupid. Sorry, but yeah.",2016-10-20 13:54:48+00:00,d90a0od,6.0,t1_d90980z,1210.0,LiverpoolFC
864,"Can? Gini. Don't get me wrong. I think Gini plays a big part in our winning midfield system currently and I'm one of those who actually do think he's important to our XI, and not just an 'average midfielder', but my impression of him is that he won't get much better than what he's offering now. He's those players who you can rely on to be crazy consistent, but at a decent level. No ups and downs. Great in hold up plays, contributing to ball movements etc., but won't come up with a world-class performance now and then like what the rest of our midfield's capable of doing.

Can was definitely out-of-depth when he started against Manc, but we can all see what he can offer later on during the match. He was fighting his hearts out in midfield for headers against Ibra, Pogba and Fellaini while trying to rampage through their wall and got a solid chance then. I believe with a few more games, we'd see the Can of last season and his ceiling is gonna be higher than Gini's.

That's why, based on current form, I'd take Gini over Can, but when Can gets to his best level of play (I've no idea when), then he'd be in our starting XI which I see happening before the season ends.",2016-10-20 13:21:46+00:00,d908qi9,4.0,t1_d9088ud,833.0,LiverpoolFC

920,"Using Origi against Dortmund is a terrible example because 1) Sturridge wasn't match-fit then 2) It's between Origi and Sturridge who I rate rather equally while Ings is a tier below them 3) It's a tactical decision because Origi presses much willingly than Sturridge and counter-attacks better with his speed against another heavy pressing team that's Dortmund, a team with open spaces behind their high defensive line.

On the other hand, in this scenario, 1) Sturridge and Origi are both healthy and arguably more match-fit than Ings having played in better competition for their NTs as opposed to the reserves against kids. 2) There is no tactical decision here and it will be explained later on.

&gt; we do not rely on height up front

Here's the explanation. Liverpool FC, in general, do not rely on height up front in this pressing style. Yes. But you have to adapt according to your opponent. Manc are the TALLEST team in the league. Zlatan, Rashford, Martial, Fellaini, Pogba, Smalling and Bailly are all above average dudes in terms of height. That's crazy. If we play Ings, we will be predictable, because we won't be scoring from crosses AT ALL. We must force our way through the middle, which is very one-dimensional.

Attribute for attribute, Ings not only loses out in height and strength. He also loses out in creativity and ball-control in the middle of the park. Sturridge and Origi are better in all those, which means playing Ings is not an upgrade in terms of crossing the ball in or playing through the middle. None at all. Form is form. Ings is banging in goals. But in the end, it all comes down to key attributes needed against certain opponents.

And your last paragraph is again, superficial at best. 'Socialize against british football'? Da fk does that even mean? Origi doesn't realise how important a game is? Dude is a talent who's getting scouted by Juventus and also the youngest Belgian to score a goal in the World Cup. Ings barely smelled an England cap. If there is a big game player between the 2, it's Origi.",2016-10-13 13:00:28+00:00,d8q6aw6,11.0,t1_d8q5hp5,1522.0,LiverpoolFC

Even with Sturridge and Origi seemingly out-of-form for the entirety of this season and Ings hammering in goals in the reserves, Ings never smelled the bench. He's pretty adamant with his line-ups.

And honestly, do you guys think pro-soccer is just a 90-minute game of sport? There's so much going on in the build-up that's important. Phrases such as 'desire in Ings' and 'play his heart out' are just superficial. You don't go by those in choosing your best players. You can have maximum willpower and fight in you, but if your small frame can't handle the likes of Bailly, Smalling, Fellaini and Pogba, there is no way you're gonna play well.

I get that Ings seems to have the drive to get first-team football, but not against United.

958,"I rate La Liga and PL equally. La Liga is strong, there's no doubt about that. But I do think that PL's bottom half of the table is better, albeit La Liga's Top 3 teams are probably the best 3 in the world.

For Ligue 1, it depends on how others define 'shite'. I wouldn't be surprised if they call it 'shite' eventhough it's abit harsh definition-wise because they are ranked 5th best league, but there is a HUGE gap between the French league and the Top 4 leagues. In fact, if not for PSG, you can even argue that Portugal's Primera Liga is better, but well, PSG is a Top 8 team pulling up it's credibility, so yeah.

The whole time, you've been saying, 'oh, bla bla bla has more money than us, it's logical to do better.' Seriously? Since when is football only about more money and only SLIGHTLY more money at that? World-class is world-class. City may be slightly richer, but PSG have a world-class squad just like them. They can play and they can win. Klopp has taught me that soccer is not about talents. There are so many other factors to it. Porto won in 04'. Liverpool won in 05'. Iceland got into Q-Finals in EUROs. LEICESTER won the PL. Sure, luck plays a big part in those because they were actually UNEXPECTED wins. PSG? Nahh, you don't need much luck, because you guys actually have squad that can compete with anyone. City are richer? GTFO with this bullcrap. Dortmund, Juve and City are actually really good squads with legit chances. They were underdogs, but not by much. They don't need 'luck'. Not every slightly weaker team winning means they've got luck.

You guys have 4 years of 'luck' to make it to Top 4, but all 4 years you guys were 'unlucky'? Nah. Your team just aren't that good. Destroy a weak league like Ligue 1 but can't go far in CL. Ligue 1 isn't all that.

Explains why Zlatan got bored of tearing up Ligue 1, go to Man U and is finding difficulty getting Europa League berth. Oh and what does he remember from his moments in PSG? 'My last paycheck'.

Q-Finals of Champions League and you would like to think that football fans couldn't watch full matches of them? It's more logical for me to assume a PL hater watching highlights of PL matches instead.

Being eliminated by Barca or Chelsea isn't shameful. Being eliminated at the SAME stage 4 years in a row with a squad able to compete toe-to-toe is shameful. And it's not like 4 Finals. It's 4 QUARTER-Finals aka PSG has never been a Top 4 club with all that money and world-class buys, much say winning the CL.

Keep on praising Chelsea and City man, go on.

I spot another hypocrisy here. You said Ligue 1 is a DECENT league. So if a mid/bottom table PL team can play slightly BETTER than an average Ligue 1 club, then that makes PL MORE THAN DECENT. So why is it a joke? Oh, cause they've got 100M to spend? They've got 100M to spend but they did not actually get world-class players. Watford has got 100M but did they get a Cavani or a Lucas Moura? No. They are still playing with Troy Deeney and Ighalo. On the other hand, PSG, with 100M and MORE, actually went out to get players with massive contracts. They've got themselves 2 world-class strikers in Zlatan and Cavani and of course, a bunch of others. But still can't get past Top 8 in CL for 4 straight years. You talking about overrated? Look who's overrated?

So, in the end, it all came down to age. He had gone through rebuild after rebuild, so he's shown that he could take them. From the Houllier's treble to the Benitez days, he waited. From the Alonso sale to Suarez's world-class season, he waited. But he could not wait any longer for the next one.

I'm an anti-stat guy. So there you have it. I'm just kinda naturally against people who use statistics as major basis.

I do understand your opinion tho. That you don't see Wij's value. Fair enough. Because alot of fans don't too, and it's definitely not a niche opinion per say. It's warranted because Wij hasn't been spectacular. Maybe because I set my expectations low on him, so it didn't cause me problems.

But he's actually worth 10 mil less than Mane. In an overpriced market different from Firmino last year and Lallana 2 years ago. He's also not 2x the value of Allen.

I don't have a problem with people not being satisified with the Wijnaldum buy, I fully understand it and I can see reasons to that. But they should not exaggerate his value to make it seem like he's a worse buy than he actually is. Also, I'd say this again.

1) MAN SCUMS - So I've always been an underdog guy, and we all know what kind of history we have against them. Gerrard's passion everytime he wins them says it all. But on a personal level, ever since I was in grade school in the 00s, whenever they win a title, there would be random fans popping up in class each year. From then on, I see them as a bandwagon club which fans hop onto just because they've been winning lots of titles.

2) CHELSKI - The original cash cow, Roman Abra. Also, lots of dislikeable guys there like Costa, Luiz, Terry etc.

3) MAN SHITTY - Same reason as Chelski, just to a lesser extent because they aren't the original. Still, using cash to gain success is always a hateful image for an underdog guy like me. And personally, light blue is as no passion a colour as a colour can get. And Sterling.

4) REAL MADRID - One word. Galacticos. As above. But the way they go about doing their business is even worse. From resorting to snatching Figo away from their eternal rivals. To buying Beckham just for his global reputation and having to fit either him or Figo at LWM as a result. To getting my favorite player Owen for a cheap ass fee and sat him on the bench eventhough he had better form than both Ronaldo and Raul at that time. I also don't like Cristiano.

5) SPURS/BARCA - Two of the most overrated clubs in my eyes. Spurs in recent years. Sure, they've got talented youngsters, blah blah, but they play like a poor man's version of us. Their counter-press is weaker and we outplayed them this season only to get an unlucky draw out of it. They've beaten Man City, but scrapped through all other games without playing that well.

Barca, for the past decade. Yes, they are a reputable club, plays beautiful football, tiki-taka, famous colours, world-class attacks, best player on the planet, 3 90+ rated players in MSN etc. But their defense have never been that great. Pique is good, but Valdes for all these years and now the error-prone Ter Stegen? They only get to destroy weak ass La Liga teams and outscore others so that they won't have the will to make a comeback. Don't get me wrong, they are one of the top clubs in the world, no doubt, but when people name Barca the No. 1 club without hesitating, that's when I felt they are overrated. They didn't sweep Europe every year for them to be warranted the unanimous best.

PS: I didn't have Everton, because I'm from Asia so am not really involved in the local derby rivalry to hate them that much.",2016-10-03 13:45:28+00:00,d8c30re,1.0,t3_55nfeb,4321.0,LiverpoolFC
1053,"His main trait is his versatility. He CAN be an attacking player, and he played most of his career in an advanced role (some of it is due to a lack of better talent in his teams up till this point), but Klopp specifically mentioned about his ability to play all across midfield which is definitely a key attribute to his arrival. He has been playing CM for us and if need be, from what we can see, his defensive instincts and strength are good enough to play CDM too.

I'd like to think of him as a utility player that can be slotted into any position whereever's needed. A different type of James Milner, if you will. Emre Can is meant to be a starter, but he has been unfit all these while, hence, Wij is playing and doing very well as a CM.

The problem with his playstyle is that what he does well is mainly off-ball. You don't notice what he does best because they aren't spectacular. If you care, watch the next game and specifically notice Wij's movements both offensively and defensively. He has an uncanny ability to be at an optimal place at the right time. His movement opens up spaces and makes himself available for a pass. He pops up in scoring positions almost all game and gets key interceptions here and there on the other end. It's these kinds of things that aren't recorded and noticeable that people are starting to underrate him now. Just take notice from them.

I love Joe Allen, but I wouldn't 'rather' have Joe over Wij. I don't think Wij is a world-class buy, but he definitely offers something different from Joe which Klopp obviously prefers, that's why he got him. Just respect a player for who he is and stop wrongly criticize him.",2016-10-03 13:30:36+00:00,d8c2i1j,10.0,t1_d8c1p6e,1480.0,soccer

People want him to hit a wonder-strike like Coutinho/Hendo or dribble past defenders like Mane/Lallana/Firmino, but he's not that type of player.

I mean, it's okay to criticize a player when they play bad or make stupid mistakes, but Wijnaldum has been doing what he does best, trying his hardest for the club without putting a foot wrong.

He will still be having his chances for long shots, but also gets to orchestrate the offense which he doesn't when he's playing as a left-winger. People rave about Coutinho's ability to come up with worldies, but to me, his best trait is his ability to dribble past defenders and hit a pin-point pass/through ball.

1079,"What he has done till this point, in regards to his managerial career in Dortmund and Mainz, already warrants enough to put him as one of the greatest imo. I'm not categorizing him that way because of his tactical superiority, he's not the best of the best tacticians, nor did he win lots and lots of trophies with his teams. But the mindset and impact he brings, not just to a club, but the fans and the world of football is amazing. And the success he has brought to clubs that aren't even favorites in achieving anything speaks volumes of how much he can turn things around for a club.

He didn't choose to hop onto the bandwagons of an already title-winning team like Barca or Man City, nor did he take up the job at the only great team in a league like Bayern. He just chooses the clubs he favours, that he thinks DESERVES more success than what they're achieving and tries to carry them higher up. Mainz never made the Bundesliga until he brought them there. Dortmund were losing their history in the bottom half of the table seasons before he brought them to win titles over Bayern. He also turned numerous players world-class there.

Klopp's teams have always had the odds against them, he is an 'underdog' manager, taking up challenges with minimal resources in his hands, yet he manages to turn things around not just by a little, but hugely in a very short time even if it doesn't guarantees him trophies. You can hardly find a manager like that in football's history or maybe, even for a long time into the future and that's what makes him one of the greatest already, imo.

His resume in Bundesliga is much better than any resume Mignolet can come up with and there's a reason why he's our very first signing after the transfer window opened right up. It's because Klopp identified the need for a keeper fast.

Klopp would always say that there isn't a clear No. 1 because there isn't a reason to say otherwise. If he says outright that Karius is No. 1, Karius would start to get complacent while Mignolet gets depressed. There's just no reason. Saying there isn't a clear No. 1 means Mignolet can fight for the spot while Karius gets wary of his competition. It's purely beneficial.

As well as Mignolet has done before this, and has made no mistakes whatsoever, there are way more room for improvement. His distribution is still the same. We aren't playing out from the keeper with him in goal and probably never will. Karius will improve that. Also, even if the goals aren't mainly his fault, some of them can be saved by a top class keeper. Not sayin' Karius is top class, but he may be able to save some of those.

So my take is, Mignolet did well till now, but not extra impressive enough to stop Karius from regaining his spot. Sorry Migs.",2016-09-20 11:34:59+00:00,d7ug2ng,2.0,t1_d7uf3cn,2803.0,LiverpoolFC

Pep gets alot of recognition for being a top manager in a top team. But that isn't to say Klopp automatically loses out to him.

1524,"Very good analysis with interesting wordings. Appreciate it.

I agree with you on the most part and you opened my mind up to a few other aspects. But I'd like to think that you're overrating Leicester abit. I see them doing well, but at about 7th-8th place (considered well, since most fans think they'll fall back to ground into their expected mid-table groove), I think they and Everton will be the ones to fight for a Europa League place. Their replacements are pretty solid. Slimani is a good final buy. A statement of intent. But from their matches this season, they don't seem to be too good and do seem like they belong in the mid-table. Things may change though, but I doubt it since they're also occupied with the CL this time round.

And also, you seem to have totally left out Coutinho when talking about our front force. Take Lallana out for Couts and we boast a Mane-Firmino-Coutinho midfield 3 with plenty of goals amongst them. And you shouldn't have been too concerned about Balotelli, because Klopp had made it clear that he won't play for us again. It's either he gets a team, or his contract will be terminated. You think Klopp will stand Balo when he couldn't even tolerate Sakho? Never ever.

I agree with you that Manchesters and Chelsea should be battling amongst the Top 3, but my take is that we will fight for 4th against Arsenal. While Tottenham will be 6th with a significant gap between them and Everton/Leicester.

Edit: Everton seems to be playing some solid football under Koeman. They may have a terrible window, but Koeman is changing things.",2016-09-01 12:26:00+00:00,d75aa7t,2.0,t1_d7591fp,2862.0,LiverpoolFC

That 1-7 trashing against Germany after holding up Neymar's jersey during the national anthem doesn't help either. And getting megged by Suarez in PSG.

Arsene's philosophy is very outdated. He still uses his style of winning titles in the 00s, when it's obvious the landscape had changed and the PL is as competitive as ever.

1539,"1) We do not know what happened in Melwood. Maybe Klopp wanted to give Sakho a chance, but Sakho did something stupid again at the last moment. Or maybe Klopp had already told Sakho to go on loan way earlier but it was only reported now. In this case, I think it doesn't matter as much that it's this late. Because alot of clubs would want a player of Sakho's calibre. It's not like Ilori or Balotelli that we needed the whole window to get a suitor, no. Clubs would be ringing the moment they know Sakho is available. Not clubs like PSG, but more of Sunderland. So it doesn't matter if it's the last week of the window because I assume the options are more than need be. Sakho just needed to say yes.

2) If you think about it, loaning to another club in the PL actually benefits us. He's not gonna play against us, but if a team like Sunderland has Sakho in their back 4 it's more likely that they'll get a result against some of our rivals and make them lose points.

3) I think Klopp brought in Klavan in preparation for this. Yeah, it's obvious that it was because Sakho and Gomez got injured at the same time, but there should be more to it. Klavan got announced the day RIGHT AFTER Sakho got injured and some say the talks had begun way earlier. So Klavan would be considered a replacement. And then, Lucas' transfer got stopped by Klopp. I thought, why keep him when we've got Stewart who seems to be rated ahead of Lucas right now at CDM? I assume it's for this situation too. Lucas is to be converted to CB and a 4th choice with Sakho out of favour. Then, there's just waiting for Gomez to recover and we'd have 6 CBs along with Ilori without counting Sakho.

The thing about Sakho's attitude is, he isn't a clear-cut headcase like Balotelli. Alot of our fans wanted him to be captain (before all these happened) because he seems to be able to engage everyone in the club well. He's very friendly. And he's a fan favorite. Passionate on the court, motivates the guys at the same time.

What Klopp doesn't like about Sakho is that, he's one of those wild and naughty type of guy. Kinda like the 'joker' in your class if you get that reference. A very likable dude, but when things get serious, he's still that casual, 'fk all', joker self. That's kinda like Sakho for you. Klopp doesn't want that. I think alot of managers would be okay with Sakho, but Klopp wants a very strict and focused team, so he isn't favoured by him.

Klopp just can't tolerate Sakho's attitude. He was already very frustrated when Sakho was hit with the temporary ban then.

At least Klopp stated that Balotelli and Luis Alberto (along with Benteke previously) are gonna find a new club, but he has not talked about Wisdom and Illori, who I think have passed their expiry dates of making the squad. They aren't young and probably will never have the quality to play for us. And they're like 6th-7th choice CBs. Only reason I can think of them staying is because they don't mind playing PL2, but I would rather have new young-ins given a chance than them at this moment.

For Markovic's case, I don't see the point of keeping him if he isn't even gonna get a chance at proving himself. He didn't do well in pre-season and his problem of being too timid and uninitiative makes it so hard to see him improve later on.

1594,"Klopp said the positions weren't fixed. I think he told the players to switch up the position flexibly when they feel that they should during the game, which stems from the idea of that midfield 3 where they usually switch between themselves. Sturridge may have had the freedom to shift in while Firmino shifts out which means his complaint isn't quite warranted. Because if all he complains about is that he's STARTING on the wing, albeit given the freedom to roam in, then I think it's just him being a tad too greedy. There's more to this than Sturridge not being happy.

And also, nothing is quite decided with Can unfit for the most part since the start of this season. We all know that he's gonna be a starter, but he hasn't started and as such, our definite formation hasn't prevail. If Can starts, we may very well switch back to a 4-2-3-1 with the 1 being Sturridge and Firmino dropping back to No. 10.

1601,"Origi did press today, but didn't win the ball. Apparently, Rodgers team was markedly differently compared to Klopp's. I do agree with you in that Sturridge is a tremendous striker who gets goals like no other, but I can also understand Klopp's decision to either play a 4-3-3 with Firmino or have Origi come off the bench first. They each have different characteristics and all of them can work. Klopp obviously prefers the latter 2 to Sturridge. Tho, I'm a proponent of our No. 15 and before this game, I would have wanted him to start, but it is what it is. Klopp trusts Firmino as a false 9 better and we did play better eventhough we didn't score goals. Granted, Sturridge could have nicked a few, but hindsight is 20/20. If Coutinho had finished his chances and we had won, no one would be talking about Sturridge now. On the other hand, if Sturridge had come on since half-time and played badly, people would have wanted Klopp to stick to his original line-up. It is what it is. We do not know if Sturridge could have gotten us a goal or two. We THINK he can, but then again, there's games like the Burnley one a week ago where he played terrible. I just think that playing false 9 Bobby, Origi or Sturridge each have their own reasons and am surprised that people think Sturridge playing SHOULD be the only way to go about this.",2016-08-27 15:32:25+00:00,d6yvc64,8.0,t1_d6yv1zg,488.0,LiverpoolFC

And not to mention he's arguably the best penalty-taker in the world. His technique in taking penalties is absolutely perfect.

Tbh, I thought 15 million was a really good gamble for him at that time because he's still got a huge chance to become the world-class player he's meant to be.

1651,"I did grasp it. But all the world-class players do gather within the Top 5 leagues. Of course, it's common sense that if a world-class one like Suarez moves to a crappy league, he'll still be world-class. But it's also true that most world-class players gather within the top few leagues, so the better the league, the harder it is to be crown a Top 3 striker, which is what I'm getting at. Funnily enough, the 7 'world-class' names you've given all play in the Top 3 leagues. And you say the league does not determine how much world-class talents they have? How oxymoronic.

Like I said so myself, Spain's Top 3 teams are better than any team in the EPL. So what? Who's 4th placed in La Liga? Who's 4th placed in the EPL? Heck, who's 4th to 6th placed in the EPL? Let's say Man C, Chelsea and Man U are the top 3 teams in the league. 4th to 6th placed goes to Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham. Any of them are better quality than say, Sevilla or Villarreal who's probably the 4th best in La Liga right now. We can only send 4 teams to the CL. And again, I said, none of Man C, Man U or Chelsea is as good as Barca and Madrids, so Top 4 vs Top 4, we're gonna lose out. But EPL has more than 4 CL-calibre teams. Us, Arsenal and Tottenham have enough quality to compete in the CL too, it's just that we can't because of the limited slots.

I don't care about the quality of the top team when talkin' bout quality of the LEAGUE, because it's the LEAGUE we're talkin' bout, not the Top 5 teams of each league or what not. As a whole, the EPL is definitely the most competitive from 1st to 20th. Furthermore, the number of title contenders is like 5-6 teams deep. Compared to La Liga's (which I assume is your choice for best league) 3 teams. Sure, those 3 teams may be better than any team in the EPL, but again, we're talkin' bout the LEAGUE and the intense competition makes it very difficult to be named a top few in your position which Sturridge belongs.

'If Suarez moved to Celtic tomorrow'. How possible is that? Close to none. The only reasons a world-class player already in a top tier league would move down to a lower tier is for a major increase in paycheck or when he's on a major decline (which means he's no longer world-class anyway). There's barely any player who's world-class IN THEIR PRIME that had chose to move to a league outside the Top 5 leagues other than for money (Eto'o to Anzhi etc.).

We are only 1 week removed from winning a title-contending Arsenal at their home ground. We were absolutely joyous and optimistic about winning the league after that win. If we had won Burnley as expected, we would be as joyous as before.

My point is that people go crazy depress after 1 game. Just 1 game, and the Liverpool fanbase collapse in sadness. Not to say we shouldn't, because feelings hit us just like that, but we should not look too much into this at all. It's a drastic difference from what we expected. 
People expected us to destroy Burnley after winning Arsenal, but the extreme opposite happened. 
We not only lost, but we looked shite for most parts. The shouts for Klopp's tactical change and transfers are reactionary. No one was putting down Coutinho, Hendo and Firmino after the Arsenal game. No one was expecting Clyne and Klavan of all people to make defensive mistakes. It just happens. Granted, we're only in the 2nd game of the season and people can't have trends to based their views on, so they've got to focus on a single game. 5 games on, we may be 4 wins and 1 lost leading the league and people will forget all about this Burnley game.

1732,"We are spoiled with choices here. So much so that I'm honestly more worried about how we are gonna fit our strikers in if Klopp prefers to go with a 4-3-3 formation most times with Firmino up top. Ings will get minimal game time if this should be the case.

Lallana and Wijnaldum provide such versatility, they are like the 'final puzzle pieces' to our formations where we can pluck and put them anywhere depending on formations and injuries. We are spoiled.

Milner is probably gonna be solely concentrating on LB and that is one benefit I get out of Klopp not signing a LB this off-season. If we do get a left-back, Milner will probably go about the role of Lucas Leiva getting minimal game time which would be quite sad seeing how he's the EPL's top assister last season.

Can's introduction in the 2nd half really allowed Hendo and Wijnaldum to start venturing and do their things. He's our only quality starting midfielder that's close to being a CDM. He's vital.

I think last night, one aspect of Hendo's game that's been overlooked is the leadership and passion he showed in an opening day game. Right off the bat, clapping the players on, arguing for his teammates no matter how correct the decisions were, guiding Wijnaldum to the right spot in the wall when we were 1 goal down. Just lots of passion from him, which is why he makes a good captain.

Grujic has time. We don't need to rush him into games since we're in abundance of MFs right now. He deserves to play, sure, but there are more senior players in the squad and they are all deserving as well, but with less career time on their hands.

Like someone else said here, Stevie's image is too big to stay in the background even if he tries. People will be talking about him, which puts alot of unnecessary distraction on the coaching staff. And what's his personal philosophy to tactics? He may try to be on the same page about Gegenpressing, but how can he contribute without having played in the system before?

There actually are, believe it or not. Liverpool are a big enough club to have fans who are pro players and if given a chance, those players would choose Liverpool over Barca/Madrid UNLESS they offer irresistible money like 2 times of what Liverpool offers or more. There are also players who don't like to have too intense a competition against other world-class ones and settle for Liverpool since they would be guaranteed more playing time. There are also players who prefer the close-knitted stadium that's Liverpool than the 'theatre' that's Nou Camp or Bernabeu. Lots of factors mean it's not a guarantee that players would choose Barca/Madrid over Liverpool unless they are a neutral or have a life-long ambition to play for those clubs.

Reasons for wanting him to stay: We do not have a true CDM aside from Can. Lucas provides some sort of cover. He's a semi-legend. The last player who's still playing for us since the Rafa era. He's a good locker room presence. Funny guy.

Reasons for wanting him to leave: He's on the decline. He won't be used much in Klopp's system this year onwards. He still has value and can get us some $ if sold ASAP. We genuinely want him to get some first-team football even if it's not with us, he still has a good few years in him so he shouldn't be getting minimal game-time this early in his career.

Personally, I'd rather he leave the club because I can't bear to see a player who has contributed so much to the club be reduced to just a squad player (similar pain to Kolo not winning the Final pouring his heart out playing). But it's all up to Lucas. If he's happy being a squad player then that's good for us, and I think we should keep him if the offer for him is a measly 2.5 mil.",2016-08-06 05:44:40+00:00,d66eh5n,1.0,t3_4weksy,1256.0,LiverpoolFC

Mignolet isn't Klopp's purchase. Karius is. There is no reason for Klopp to think that he should play Migs other than the fact that when he arrived here, he's our only viable keeper. He's Rodgers' signing, and he hasn't instil any sense of confidence in the backline for Klopp to trust him that much. Karius is Klopp's choice of keeper to sign from another team. He wants him.

Edit: Reasons - Tommy Lawrence, as you all know, went viral because of that BBC clip and it just amazes me how he so genuinely brightened up when the reporter coincidentally asked about a match he played in. It's very humbling. It's almost like he felt that he was part of an 'unknown' Liverpool era pre-accomplishments and was just so happy that he can be recognized as a 'Liverpool player' now that we're a huge club after the 80s.

I'd have Finnan at RB, but I love Carragher, Hyypia and Agger a tier above. So I gotta squeeze Carra at RB, which he did play for awhile. I love Hyypia for sticking with the club eventho he got his captaincy stripped for Gerrard. I can only imagine how 'shameful' that is, but he still played here so long. Agger is the definition of foreign loyalty. Tattooing YNWA and rejecting Barca? Please. Riise is the last good LB we had.

Gerrard's career coincided with my whole childhood and I'm honored to have watched his world-class career pan out. Alonso speaks well of us, eventho he has since been to Madrid and then Bayern. Suarez is the most talented player I've ever seen play in a full game and Owen is the reason why I became a Liverpool fan.

I have Arsenal at 5th next season. Their main problem seems to be Arsene Wenger. Gradually losing his managerial prowess and is too adamant and reliant on a certain style of football that's been his bread and butter for decades. They also have a weird mix of players, imo. Xhaka is a great signing by Wenger for once tho, I'd give them that.

Xhaka is a obviously a player to look out for and I think Szczesny will start replacing Cech at one point during the season if he remains in the squad. Bellerin has played well last season and Ramsey is coming off a terrific EUROs. Alexis Sanchez remains their star player, imo.

Their squad looks strong at the midfield 3 and weak with Giroud as striker.

I think Debuchy will get minimal game-time or get sold, while Chambers seems like a bust. Coquelin will sit with Xhaka coming in and Cazorla will not be the same player he once was with that injury.

2019,"Karius will be a little shaky his first season but solid overall. Mignolet will take a few games off him, but that's it. We will finally see improved distribution, commandment and confidence in our six yard box. Overall, he will improve tremendously from second season onwards, similar path to De Gea after he transferred to EPL.

Manniger will probably not get playing time seeing how our 2nd choice, Mignolet, is more than capable, but I don't think he expects much anyway. Klopp must have given him a senior role in our squad and he's a good signing as mentor to the other keepers. Seems like a teacher-figure with good patience.

Mane will settle in and contribute straight away because he has been in the league for awhile now. Not missing a beat from his Southampton form. Whether he will improve from there, we'll see, but he will at least perform as well as expected.

Matip will be shaky at first, but settles in and finds confidence in doing his trademark runs from the back.

Klavan will get some time at the start of the season, but tails off later on when our CBs recover as 4th choice behind Matip, Sakho and Lovren, which I think will be our CB rotation. We will see him in cup games and maybe slot in at LB once in a while. He's more than capable a 4th choice tbh.

Grujic will not get much time in the league since we've got too many options for the midfield 2 slots. He's capable of playing but he's 20 and chances will go to Can, Hendo, Milner, Wijnaldum seeing how they're more senior. But he will play a good amount, more than our other youth players.

Wijnaldum will be in our active rotation. Start some games, sit some games. What contributes to this is of course, his renowned versatility. Anytime a player can play 5 positions in midfield, he's sure to get time somehow. And he will do well.

This is the perception that seems wrong to me here. We are trying to contend asap with Boogie, yes, but we also must have a contingency plan in case we don't manage to have a good team by the time Cousins starts to ponder about his future. That's the 'contingency plan' I'm talking about. Taking a Center for the future and stash him in case our star player decides to do something that we fans don't want him to.

The idea here is that it's not a must to draft a ready player if you are trying to win. Nor a must to draft a long-term prospect just cause you are trying to tank. You can mix it up a little just like how Boston did with Jaylen even when they're in the playoffs and have got Crowder. In case they fail to become a contender within these few years, they will have a star SF for the future. Something along those lines.

Granted, I'm not sure if Papa will become our Center for the future, but what we know is that the idea of drafting Papa is to have a very raw prospect with good physical profile and develop him while we own our current games with Boogie.",2016-07-17 15:57:45+00:00,d5fplhz,7.0,t1_d5fo5jm,2571.0,kings

Reason why we sucked was because we played almost zero defense as a team. At least 4 players on the court at all times would just let ANYBODY blow by them. I say 4 because Karl would sub in a Seth/Anderson/WCS to 'look like' he put in help on defense but 1 above average defender won't help to improve a non-existent defensive scheme.

Skal was fighting for the top spot with Simmons (Boston fans on a forum wanted Skal over Simmons then because he's a big man and Ingram was pretty scrubbish as well). The hype existed, till he went to Kentucky and dropped to the bench. The impression on people, especially when Coach Cal is Kentucky's coach, was that this dude must be so bad, even Cal the NBA prospect developer refused to play him.

What does injured got to do with talented? Oden and Embiid didn't smell the court much, but we can all agree that they are talented. It has nothing to do with injury.

I agree that they won't hit it. Tho my number will be around 68-70. But still a significant number of games short of their record.

I predict Zaza to run out of gas during the regular season and the Warriors start looking defeatable and Kerr has to give major major minutes to the Curry-Klay-Iggy-KD-Draymond line-up which teams can use against them. They can put up size and bigs to counter that small line-up if it starts to get overused.

2186,"It's not that simple. Getting a record isn't just simply about a team getting better on paper. Sure, KD makes GSW a scarier team and we all know why. But there are other factors constituting to whether they are a better TEAM or has just recruited more TALENT. Here's my take:

1) KD has lived his life as an iso monster. He's a lights out scorer.. when he has the ball in his hands. GSW got to 73 wins as an unselfish, ball-moving team. Will KD fit into that system flawlessly? If he does, does it take away the primary factor that makes him effective (he can be an insane iso scorer, but we've never seen KD running off-ball plays)? Will they mesh immediately or does he need 1 or 2 years to get use to the system? Barnes may have been terrible in the Finals, but he was drafted by the Warriors and trained to become the fitting role player that he was under the tutelage of the Warriors since Day One. KD just arrived from OKC.

2) Changes to the role players on this team. We all know how important Bogut and Barnes (minus Finals) are to this team. They are moving. Zaza Pachulia is brought in to replace Bogut. Does he have what it takes to fill Bogut's shoes? Bogut catches oops and is slightly more nimble-footed. He is also big-time on defense. Zaza looked horribly exhausted at the end of last season. Can he handle the constant running in GSW's system? How bout in the locker room? How will the difference affect them? If he can't last through the season, GSW will probably go with a Curry-Klay-Iggy-KD-Draymond line-up for the most part. Will that compromise height and inside-presence? Can teams like Sacramento feed on that by having WCS tower over Draymond and Boogie hammering the skinny ass that's KD?

3) How would the GSW manage touches now? Will Curry still have the same amount of possessions to do his thing, essentially limiting KD to a 'Barnes-role' of just waiting in the corner for a 3? Or will they give KD more possessions such that the 2s that he hits could have been one of those insane 3s that Curry hit all year last season? Will Klay get his feelings hurt playing as 3rd wheel on offense now?

These are just some things that will affect a TEAM that just got themselves overhauled whether with more talented individuals coming in or not. I say it will affect them enough to not beat the record that they set last season. I'd say they get about 68-70 wins.",2016-07-05 16:25:23+00:00,d505brf,3.0,t1_d503yfy,1729.0,kings

Wade is still a better player than JR.

Granted, you can argue about what could have been if the league didn't unfairly ban Amare and Diaw in Game 7 against the Spurs, but still, for how much they won in the regular season, they should have at least made the Finals one of those years with Nash as MVP.

Showtime Lakers had a viable tactic that's fast-flowing and fun to watch.

It's no fun supporting them because you don't get enough satisfaction when the favourites win. You get immense satisfaction instead seeing the underdogs win and you can be a part of the minority in this world rooting for them which means you are COOL AF FOR NOT BEING MAINSTREAM.

My favorite player is Iverson and will forever be. And there's a backstory. I wanted to join the basketball team in my school, but seeing the tough trainings, I contemplated quitting. Went home to make 'The Decision' and resorted to watching YT mixes to see if I can be inspired. Watched a bunch of guys including Kobe, but none of them excited me. When Allen Iverson popped up, with his cornrows, headband, arm sleeve, baggy shorts etc., he hit a crossover and made the opponent sprawled across the floor. That did it for me. I aspired to be like him because he looked so fkin cool doing his shit on the court. He made the game so pleasing, smooth and casual. I wanted to be like AI. And he went on to inspire me to play in high school and college. No other player could do this for me.

So, you gotta be enlightened to be a true fan of somebody. My current fave is Rondo, but he made me grew to become a Kings fan, because I want to see them win so bad. They've got a fresh colour code and their fans are tremendous. Never quitting the team even after they encountered such a major sports tragedy having the game rigged. So I want to be part of this.

The point is not about chances to win the title LAST YEAR, or the year before, or the year later. In the NBA, every team gets a chance to rebuild and contend, rebuild and contend. The teams have cycles. GSW is in contending mode right now, but a few years back, pre-drafting Curry, they were a laughing stock.

2209,"I won't answer this directly. Just want to point out that NBA's 'power team' is not like soccer's 'power team'. Because NBA isn't meant to have power teams. In soccer, it's somewhat inevitable because a great team has it's history to attract transfers and youth players to join them. Professional soccer players are fans of them. Lots of pro soccer players want to play for Barcelona because they are fans since young. Furthermore, money matters. Power teams in soccer build on their power by winning and winning, earning prize money in the process. Rich owners would want to buy over these clubs. Therefore, they won't just guarantee trophies to the players but also, immense salaries. All these combined and power teams in soccer will stay powerful and even grow in power as they attract the best talents in each era to play for them.

Whereas in the NBA, there isn't suppose to be a power team. Money is not a problem because all teams have equal salary caps and all of them have an opportunity to give max deals if managed right. Furthermore, their power struggles are taken care off through each year's draft, where weaker teams stand to get better talents and have the chance to climb to greater heights. Drafting is the way to grab young talents in the NBA, not money like in soccer.

So, say Cristiano Ronaldo leaving Lisbon to go to Man U is a different scenario to Durant from OKC to GSW. Because people can understand Ronaldo's decision as it is a culture for soccer players to drift to top clubs in order to become world-class and let's face it, Lisbon do not stand a chance to win great trophies as much as Man U. On the contrary, Durant could have stayed at the team that nurtured him and win a championship for them because they are equally strong, but instead chose to move to a rival.

KD, on the other hand, could have very well be in the Finals if he hadn't choked so bad in Game 6 3-1 up. He basically went to the team he choked and lost against and now has to fight and disappoint the people in OKC who he has already disappointed by not carrying them to the Finals. That's a bitch move, man. Low-key funny because people were laughing at 'KD looking like he's reflecting the fk out of life' when OKC lost 2 close games in the regular season against GSW (hey, I just remember he choked one in the reg season too by fouling Iggy and throwing the ball away LMAO), and he probably actually did that.

Tbh, I ain't affected by this. Warriors are gonna be ahead of us anyways, ain't stopping us from making the playoffs. In fact, we have no idea how good OKC is now with only Westbrook so we may have a go at them.

Oh, and KD might not necessarily make Warriors better. As shit as Barnes was in the Finals, him being a 3&amp;D player filled a key role on this ball-moving team en route to their reg season record. With KD, yes, you get a superstar iso player who can score lights out.. but that is when he has the ball in his hands. He's not that great a defender, may fail to fit into the 'unstoppable' Warriors system, take possessions off Curry to hit 2s when Curry could have hit one of those crazy 3s, relegate Klay to 3rd option which may cause him to lose effectiveness, become a ball-stopper, so on, so forth.

In 00s, it's a toss up. Definitely not a SG-dominated league, but you also can't really pinpoint a position in that era. Of the 10 years, only 1 year had a SG as MVP (Kobe). You have Shaq, Yao, Ben Wallace and Dwight for C, Duncan, Garnett, Dirk, Bosh, Stoudemire and Webber for PF, LeBron, Pierce, Carmelo at SF and CP3, Tony Parker, Kidd, Nash and Billups at PG. It's a toss up in the 00s. There is no indication in the 2000s that SG dominated that era like how PGs are dominating this era with all the small-balls and shyt. 00s should be seen as a balanced era.

Spend less money now on a PG? Like who? Don't forget we are trying to win right now within these 2 years of Cousins' remaining contract. Like I said, a trade is warranted for someone like Rubio, but that would force us to give away Rudy and McLemore when we can get Rondo and STILL KEEP both.

And he's still a Top 5 SG in this league. I'm not comparing Rondo to Wade, I'm saying that 30 to 34 isn't that bad an age period for a basketball player. He can still play.

Furthermore, Rondo's playstyle does not rely on athleticism much. He's the Kidd/Nash type of PG. And they both were serviceable till they were 40. Nash, in fact, peaked at 31. Again, not saying Rondo will turn out like them, cause Rondo is a terrible shooter, but you can't deny that they rely on IQ and passing and those don't age.

&gt; His defense is going to get even worse.

Omg, why are people still saying this when we just replaced Karl with Joerger. Only going to get worse? I understand the rage about Rondo being a terrible defender, cause he's in fact terrible last season (I still stand my ground that it's his effort that makes him terrible), but how are you gonna say that he's gonna do worse under Joerger, a defensive coach?

His outside shooting% did improve last year. I seriously have no idea where you got your deduction on defense and shooting from.

Lastly, Rondo's effect is underrated on this team. There's a reason why Vlade said he wanna try to re-sign Rondo without hesitation after the draft press con. He saw things in the locker room that we didn't. Rondo is a leader, a communicator, a team bonder. He also knows what it takes to be at the level of a championship contender. On the court, he dictates movements by constantly communicating and he's the best at that in this league. 30 to 34, old enough to just sit on the bench, it doesn't matter.

2352,"Considering how he got single-digit points in alot of his games and how he practically got only 5 FGA off several times, I'm inclined to think that a +2 increase in PPG is a tad too little. Dwight put up lots of 8 pts, 8 rebs games, like it's said above, on 4 of 5 shooting, something like that. In Boston, he's at least gonna get about 10 attempts off. And that will increase his average significantly, more than a +2, I believe. Don't forget that he also tried to play bad because he was unhappy about how the FO wanted to reduce his touches. There's also a psychological factor in play.

Dwight is a little misunderstood on that part.  I followed him since his Orlando days (big fan of dominant bigs) and alot of the fleck he got weren't warranted. In Orlando, he did the best he could. He wanted out and people went crazy about that. Like guys, this guy tried his best to dominate for you all, got Orlando into the Finals and wanted a new scenery because the team was getting old and the FO proved to be incompetent in getting new guys. He deserved to move. Then he went to the Lakers. In which the Nash argument came about. Even then, I blame a bulk of the problem on the coaches. They absolutely SUCKED at bringing the best out of the 5 star VETERANS. They each have their egos and they weren't young and fast-moving. Mike Brown forced the Princeton Offense and D'Antoni forced the Run&amp;amp;Gun. You think Dwight can play well in those systems? He came off a career-changing back injury. Sure, that Nash PLAY was his fault. But dude was playing with a bad back along with a lack of motivation because the coaches absolutely sucked, so it didn't work out.

In Houston, people are prisoners of the moment and only remember what he did this season when in actuality, he was very much a good-great player his first 2 years in Houston. Going back to being his rebounding and defensive self. Most importantly, he absolutely BEASTED his first 2 playoffs there, with Harden flopping so hard in the first one. Dwight was putting up 22 pts, 15 rebs a night and bailed Harden out.

I wouldn't classify Dwight as a headcase. Not to the extent of Cousins, Rondo, Whiteside, Bynum, Zach in the past etc. He's a little childish and goofy. That isn't a bad thing, but when things go wrong, people think that he isn't treating basketball seriously because he's known to be that type of person. He can still play, and can still ball. And Brad Stevens is gonna be great bringing the best out of Dwight. I'm sure he wouldn't be a problem in Boston, as long as he's used the right way and being treated like a man without any excessive fleck.",2016-07-01 05:34:29+00:00,d4v0ec9,7.0,t1_d4uz9ks,2447.0,nba

Similar to Warriors last year. People said 'this Cavs and LeBron do not have enough to defeat Warriors after getting blown out in reg season' and then they succeeded. What's important is whether your team improves and it sure will.

Dwight only had 13 PPG because we all know that the Rockets didn't want to give the ball to him. He played defensive C the whole time. Getting stops just to see Harden chucked one up at the other end. I pity him, because I know for a fact that dude still has the ability to put up 17 PPG in him. 11 RPG is Top 3 in the league and Dwight is still a rim protector even if he lost his athleticism. Prime Dwight = 3 DPOY. Now = rim protector. Logical.

You build a team that has enough capability and firepower to reach the top and let the players play out themselves. I think, from the post-season that just ended, there are clearly 3 teams that were in that position to win it all. Cavs, GSW and OKC. If you watched the series between these 3 teams, they were very very evenly-matched and those teams played at a high level worthy enough to win a ring. It could very well have gone 3 ways. Both series went down to a Game 7. There were blow-outs in different games.

In the end, Cavs scraped through and OKC couldn't win it. But that doesn't take away the fact that they COULD and HAVE THE ABILITY to win a ring. The players just didn't play well enough to achieve that, but the pieces are there.

Or is it to spread the bets equally around? I heard over/under total goals gives you the highest chance of winning? How bout the specific scores?

2436,"Firstly, Jennings is not a shooter. He's a high-volume scorer on his best days, but those aren't frequent. He scores alot, but takes alot of shots. He's a shot-creator, for sure. But he ain't a shooter.

Secondly, Cousins having the highest usage rate has numerous causes to it. I think Cousins himself felt that he needed to do some immense carrying for his team, he knows that he is the star player and he knows that he needs to carry the Kings into the playoffs asap, so he has that responsibility to put it on himself. He didn't have a head coach he can trust, but that is almost certain to change under Joerger. Also, George Karl openly admitted that he ran no plays without Cousins. Everything he ran had Cousins as the central figure. He didn't even run plays for Rudy other than isos, who we know is very capable of carrying a part of the scoring load himself. We aren't getting this type of ineptitude with Joerger. We will see a Cousins with improved efficiency this year whoever the PG is.

Jennings is not that young. The problem with him coming back from injury compared to Rondo's is that his game doesn't bode well with an injury comeback. He relies on quickness to score. That goes away when you are out with an injury for so long. Rondo tore his ACL, sure, but Rondo plays with his smarts and passing and 40-year-old Steve Nash and Jason Kidd can ascertain that you won't lose your IQ even if you break a leg.

&gt; If salaries are comparable I'd rather roll the dice on Jennings.

Did you even watch Jennings play last year? He very much degraded. He came back, talked about settling for the role of 6th man in Detroit and then got traded to Orlando because I assume that Stan Van Gundy realised he doesn't have it in him anymore. Once he got to Orlando, Skiles gave him the benefit of the doubt by starting him over Payton, but right next game, he got relegated to the bench and his minutes started dwindling little by little as the season went on. He's no longer the player he once was. I was riding the Jennings hype-train after his 55 points during his rookie year. I know his game, watched his mixtapes. But little by little, I see that he doesn't really improve and his game dawns on me as 'selfish'. Even if his salary is lower than Rondo's, I'm going with Rajon. I wouldn't even want him to play back-up and would rather have Seth over him. Jennings is nowhere near a role model as a point guard.",2016-06-28 03:54:26+00:00,d4qt56i,4.0,t1_d4q3idd,36848.0,kings
2437,"No one actually hates him tbh. We just 'want him out' because he just isn't good enough for us to progress and is getting old. We hold no grudge on Belinelli. I think you take it too far a little. I also think it's unfair to put all of the blame regarding his individual ineffectiveness on him alone. Sure, he shot poorly, but alot of it has to do with him taking iso jumpers off the dribble that he was never asked to do on other teams. He also started developing a fade-back in his jumpers which the coach can suitably rectify, but GK seemed like he didn't even notice it. Lastly, he was put into the game for like 30 minutes a game eventhough he missed shots like crazy. It's the coach's job to sit ineffective players down, but GK didn't. And so, Belinelli was asked to chuck up more and more shots, increasing his ineffectiveness in our fans' eyes.

I do think that Beli is still a sharpshooter when open. His stroke is beautiful. He won a ring with Spurs being a significant contributor because all he needed to do was to stand at the corner, receive a pass and hit that corner 3. He was asked to do too much for the Kings.

2438,"Yes, going to the Finals is a great achievement itself. But what I'm saying is the feeling of going to the playoffs, but knowing that you have almost no chance of winning the damn thing. It's like, at the start of the playoffs, yeah, I should be happily supporting them, but at the same time, at the back of my mind, I can already feel a tinge of disappointment. And to have this feeling every year for a damn long time, it just sucks.

Of course, it's very difficult to form a team that are FAVORITES to win the trophy, like a 73-9 Warriors or the Cavs winning the East. But at least have a team that are looking in from the outside and having a legit chance to go at it, like a Toronto Raptors, OKC, Clippers etc. The 'not-so-favorites', but still a possibility. I think Chicago did a great job at that getting the Top 4 spots every year for the past few years before this season. They had a solid chance to make the Finals and not just a 'we all know you will falter come 2nd round max' kind of feeling. Like the Hawks, the Grizzlies and the Aldridge Trail Blazers. Those are bad examples of building a team, imo. The only reason to keep going on as a 5th to 8th seed is that the owners are going for more arena money by extending their seasons into the playoffs.

Kobe might perform worse with a star point guard, he might also have gotten 6 rings if he had a star point guard. We don't know and we will never know.

2445,"Just rethink your previous statement for a second. 'KD needs Westbrook to take over the playmaking and bail KD out when he's cold'. Why does a superstar need Westbrook to bail him out? Because Westbrook himself is a superstar right? Okay. Is AD a superstar? Yes, he is. 'He needs a PLAYMAKER'. NOW THAT. Is the problem here. Westbrook takes over playmaking from KD because HE'S A FCKIN' POINT GUARD. He is supposed to carry the team via playmaking. And you SAW that Westbrook took over the game from KD numerous times via playmaking, because he is the only star you've seen alongside KD. Did you see AD take over the game for KD before? NO. Because they never existed. AD can take over the game by crashing the board, making big defensive plays and score from the inside. Of course, he won't take over the game via playmaking, he's a POWER FORWARD, he's NOT SUPPOSED TO. He will take over the game using other means necessary, and that may or may not have the same impact as Westbrook. We don't know, cause we never see it. We didn't have the chance to see what terror AD can do alongside KD. We SAW what terror Westbrook can do alongside KD and we SAW Westbrook bail KD out via playmaking, so we can make that claim. But AD may have been able to carry KD too, we don't know.

And your analogy is stupid because Kobe and AI play the same position. And everyone knows that AI, as a shooting guard, is inferior to Kobe. Kobe is Top 2 All-Time, AI is Top 5 All-Time. No matter how you see it, AI is a downgrade at the same position, doing the same thing as Kobe that's scoring a ton. They play the same way, play the same position, so people can guess that AI with Shaq won't be as good as Kobe with Shaq.

Here, we are talking about Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook. One's a Top 2 PG in the league and the other one's the best PF in the league. Vastly different postions, different game, different ways of impacting the game. We SAW that KD played well alongside a superstar guard. But he may play better alongside a superstar PF. We don't know, we never see it happen, and we can't guess it either unlike the Kobe-AI example because they play different positions and different roles. Heck, we don't even know if AD or Westbrook is the better overall player, unlike Kobe and AI. They are both superstars and top ones in their field today.

You get that? Imma throw you an analogy. Think Kobe. Kobe is an iso-scorer. In essence, KD's game is similar to Kobe in the sense that they both are insane iso-scorers and can give you 30 points a night any day. Agree? Let's move on. Who are the superstars Kobe played with and won rings with? Shaq, Pau Gasol and Bynum. Big guys. Who are the point guards he played with? Essentially, Derek Fisher. We SAW what Kobe did with top top big guys in his team. We SAW what he did with sub-par point guards on his team. His game is similar to KD. KD got to 1 Finals and a few other contending seasons with Westbrook. That's good to you. That's a success to you. But for all you know, he could be winning rings with AD. You can say Westbrook bail KD out, because it happened. But AD could be having more success with KD for all we know, you can't dickride on that because it didn't happen.

As someone who has watched high-school 'the next LeBron' Wiggins lose his hype gradually, I gotta mention a massive red flag of his that's IQ. As of now, he's still realizing his potential gradually. The only stat that has shown that he improved is his 20 PPG. But he's still inefficient and takes bad shots, while not providing other aspects of the game that's passing and defense YET. Sure, there's time and he has massive potential, but that's where I've got to go back to the red flag that I mentioned that's IQ. No offense to Wiggins, but I think he is a little low in that area. He will improve on the physical side of his game, but he might not be able to use his talents fully. I'm a Kings fan and I've got a similar type of player on my team that's Ben McLemore. See if you can relate to him.

On the other hand, Butler is now a Top 3 SG in the league. Forget his '30th pick talent', he has surpassed that long ago. He works hard, is a very smart man, plays lockdown defense and can score well. I don't think he suits the 1st option role, but he will be a superstar 2nd option on a contending team.

Eventhough Pelicans didn't win loads, you can hardly blame AD because, just look at their dysfunctional roster. Possibly the worst Center combo in Asik and Perkins. Starting SF Quincy Pondexter being injured all year and Alonzo fckin' Gee has to step in. Eric Gordon and Tyreke Evans are both injury prone and when Tyreke plays, he starts at PG when he really isn't a PG.

AD is as much a superstar as Westbrook. Your argument about KD needing a ball-handler to aid him is flawed because you are suggesting that KD can only play with a superstar PG to be effective. That's cause he has played his whole career with Westbrook. You've never seen him pair up with a star big man. Sure, AD can't handle the ball as a 7 footer but he can also carry games in a different way from WB. He makes big plays on defense. And provides superstar presence inside which KD never experience in OKC his whole life.

It's like saying, just cause Tim Duncan found success as a twin tower with David Robinson, he needs 'someone else to help protect the paint and rebound to be effective.' No. Robinson retired and he got Tony Parker and Manu, 2 perimeter players and still found success because they contribute in different ways, but still, at a star level.

Bucks also have a forward line of Jabari and Giannis. 2 up and coming young guys so there's no position for him to 'replace'.

AD can focus on rim-protecting with a little pick-n-roll offense and some post plays since KD will be the primary scorer. They can be effective in a small ball line-up too with the athletic yet lengthy AD at the 5. And they can both shoot.",2016-06-25 07:19:47+00:00,d4naops,3.0,t1_d4naf8k,868.0,nba

Philly over Lakers is just a matter of talent. Simmons, Okafor, Embiid, Noel and Saric consist of so much talent. 4 Top 3 talents in their draft class.

2516,"Neutral fan here. Nice insight to things. I almost forgot you guys have Herzonja, so that makes the trade more legit, I guess. But I got to disagree with a few decisions your FO made.

Firstly, picking Payton over Oladipo is ridiculous. Payton ain't got more star potential than Oladipo. Oladipo is a defensive stud, has a nice 3-point stroke, is athletic and can play the point decently (not the point here since he's primarily a SG). Payton is a potential triple double anytime he steps onto the court but.. that's about it. He's an all-rounded PG but an average one at that. He's one of the slower starting PGs (you can't teach speed), has a broken jumper and plays like he's off-tempo sometimes. I don't think he's gonna improve much from the way he is now, Oladipo though, still has rooms to grow considering the things that he needs fixing (3-point shot, decision making, TOs). Those are things you can improve. When I heard you guys fired Skiles because he thinks Payton isn't the PG moving forward, I agreed with him. I don't think it's hard to see why. And then your FO legit went a step further by trading Oladipo, it just became ridiculous at this point.

Next, it's funny how you talk about Vogel's defensive team when he traded away arguably your core defender and have Herzonja/Fournier both start. Those 2 are a huge downgrade on defense from Oladipo.

Lastly, about Ibaka. Dude is great on OKC. But there's a wide-spread skepticism about his age, which I think, the skeptics are right. He ain't 26. 26 is the age when you start entering your prime and dude had his best year during the year he got snubbed in the dunk contest. He was seen as an All-Star prospect then, but everyone's just calling him a stretch 4 role player now. He's older than it is.

I think Oladipo alone has already more value than Ibaka. Yet, Magic added an 11th pick along with Ersan into that trade. Normally, it's the contenders that are desperate for the final piece to their championship puzzle and would be cheated on the deal, but it's actually the other way round here.

2606,"If you have watched the Kings play, you would have said that GK was at least part of the reason even if you are a hater. It's that obvious. Yes, Cousins has been the common denominator, but look at the guys around him before this season. We never had a talented roster, never a team that didn't look lottery. It's more than just Cousins. We were on our way up until the FO kicked Mike Malone out who was the only coach Cousins could relate to. GK is a few years removed from his COTY year. He doesn't look the same since, literally. He looks frail. No disrespect to the surefire HOF, I'm a huge AI fan and followed AI to his days in Denver and he seems so different from those days from the way he coaches.

PS: How ironic. 'Those were the same guys who got runner-up in the West.' and they barely made 8th this season. Lols. INB4 you call out JB Bickerstaff because you stopped me from calling out Karl. Keep banking on past success. Harden was the 2nd best player in the league 2 years ago bro. He's not even Top 5 this year. Capela and Motiejunas inside, an old Ariza and Beverley outside along with a weak bench. I'm mega confident of our chances. Will be back here a year later just to heck on this post.

2607,"You are not being generous to Cousins anyway by calling him an 'All-Star'. He's a borderline superstar, franchise cornerstone and the best Center in the league. Let's set that straight first. Secondly, of course we won the most games since Cousins got drafted, because we actually have talents on our roster for once in so many years. That talent alone can bring us to 33. But GK didn't maximise it into a playoff caliber team. We never had Rondo, Koufos, Spurs ring team contributor Belinelli, Seth and WCS all on the roster before. We could have made something out of this if GK hasn't forgot how to play defense, made Belinelli become an iso player, sat Seth on the bench for Ben Mac and gave Willie only 15 mins a game.

D'Antoni has a style that helped mediocre teams win games.. 5 years ago. And does he have the pieces to run this team his way? Capela at C, Motiejunas who can't run fast at PF, an old Ariza who is starting to lose his 3-point touch, and Patrick Beverley who is the total opposite of the player Steve Nash was. Add on to an almost non-existent bench. They are not better than the Kings until some kind of trade is made, then it will still be a MAYBE.

2616,"And.. the other prospects are better?

He is undersized, yes, but so is D.Wade, Avery Bradley, Brandon Knight and a bunch of other SGs playing in this small-ball era. Is turnover prone because Oklahoma needs him as the go-to player. Needing the ball can also be explained the same way. Lack of athleticism can be rectified via fundamentals and Buddy is already arguably the most polished player AS OF NOW, which also means that age can be a benefit here, since we wanna win within the next 2 years. Scouts have him as a potential defensive stud. He's not good on defense, but at least he's got the assets to be good on that end.

Buddy and Jimmer have similar game, no doubt, but here's the differences I see between them. Buddy is more athletic, is even taller than Jimmer (Jimmer is 6 foot 2 and plays SG), has a better shooting mechanic (smooth compared to Jimmer who has a hitch), has the potential to play off-the ball and a running off screen type of player, plays better defense and is an unselfish player willing to make the pass. MOST IMPORTANTLY, it's their attitude and work ethic. Buddy was a nobody as a rookie and worked his way up to a lottery pick in college. He talks like a hardworking man and he is. Jimmer, on the other hand, thinks he deserves to play in the NBA when he obviously doesn't. The hype got into his head. He didn't wanna play off-ball in the NBA. He didn't wanna learn how to run off screens even as a rookie because 'I'm a go-to player anywhere I go'.

What the Kings desperately need now, is a consistent 3&amp;D player. Buddy is the best shooter in this draft and his defense has the potential. His range is Curry-esque.

Again, look at the other prospects around him before you throw all his flaws out in the open. They all have their flaws and taking those into account, Buddy deserves to be a Top 8 pick. Who would you take over him?",2016-06-21 06:58:01+00:00,d4hps12,6.0,t1_d4hpdit,1164.0,kings

Boston are in the playoffs now. They are just 1 star player away from being a serious contender. What they need to do now is to draft and STASH, meaning they need to prepare contingency plans for the future via draft and keep on building for current contention via trade. Whether it's all in on Horford or Whiteside, it's all in for contention now. Via draft, they can aim for a future star and Bender is the embodiment of a mega-raw star in progress.

Secondly, Bender fills a need for Boston more so than Buddy. Boston have a solid backcourt led by Isaiah alongside Bradley and Smart. Who do they have as bigs? Jared fckin' Sullinger and Amir fckin' Johnson? Bender would be a fill-in eventhough he's raw. His talent surpasses any big man currently on that roster.

Last but not least, if they are gonna trade for a star, it would most likely be for a big. And as per usual trades, most of them have players who are of the same position going both ways. To bait for a current big man star, they can use Bender, the 'future big man star' as trade bait.

Sure, LeBron started it and Draymond had every reason to retaliate, but the focus is on the retaliation. Did Draymond retaliate? Yes. That's what the NBA is looking out for and with that bad history behind the higher-ups' minds, they chose to suspend him.

Does that play in Game 4 alone deserve a suspension? No. Did Draymond 'owe' a suspension? Yes. And that play merely triggered it.",2016-06-15 18:23:39+00:00,d4ai5ip,2.0,t1_d490f8y,89263.0,warriors

When you put everything on the line in the Finals, you need to make sure the team feels that level of energy that matches the circumstances as a leader, and Draymond brings that to the table. He fights as hard as anybody, but he wears that attitude on his sleeves such that his team can tell straight up that, yeah, we need to keep this level of intensity. He shouts at teammates on the bench directly, no bullshit, so that they can switch on immediately after the time-out. Curry can tell himself to persevere as much as he wants, but his teammates may not know what he's thinking and thus, a miss shot by him may cause the team morale to drop lower.

For the laymen, the first thing they are gonna notice is the shooting aspect of the game cause it takes up a large part, if not the most part of what we see during a match.

LeBron's got about 13 years to get that jumper to respectable level, but he just couldn't fix it till it's consistent enough. I mean, the reason why MJ is the greatest of All-Time is because there is almost no flaw to his game, zero.

As a SG, he has no shot and as a SF, he's too small.

You shouldn't have been that ecstatic because you can tell that Tyreke's arsenal is limited and doesn't allow for much improvement.

BBIQ aside, he's still overrated imo. I'm one of those who are very critical about him and think he is NOT a max contract player. I've said somewhere here that 'whoever signs him to a max is gonna regret'. He's going down the 09' ring team Lakers' Trevor Ariza's path, in which a 4th option player on a historically great team gets overrated as a STAR. Ariza would go on to Houston on a hefty contract and flopped as the go-to guy there, before reverting back to being a role player the rest of his career. Barnes isn't a star player. Just cause you are a starter on an unstoppable team does not make you a main guy on other teams.

And I also agree with Karl screwing him up, making him a shot-creator rather than a corner 3 shooter. He also failed to rectify Beli's tendency to fade back while shooting last season, in which Jerry frequently called out. I'm behind Beli. I trust Joerger to bring the best out of him next season and see what he can really do.

With that said, I'd still pick Seth over Ben Mac. Jerry West recently explained how he picks players to form a team as a GM and one point that stood out for me was his mentioning of 'players who think the game'. No matter how athletic or talented you are, if you don't have the brains for the game, you'd never play well enough. Ben Mac is that player for me. On the contrary, Seth plays like he knows the game well enough, so I'd pick him over Ben Mac any day. Doesn't matter if he isn't a true SG, shorter, slower, can't jump etc. He's always gonna be more efficient than Ben Mac who has a low BBIQ.

Barnes does not have that level of playmaking or strength in that situation.

Barnes is nowhere close to an 'explosive' scorer that can give you random 20+ points out of nowhere. We got a few guys in the league who can do that, but not Barnes.

Dwight's situation is explained by poorchris. He was a great Center. You can't complain much about him then because he was the clear-cut best Center in arguably, the world while he's with Orlando. Dominant in the post, and that's what Centers should be. Good represent. You are right about Tyson in terms of playstyle, but he's on that team for more than just what he does on the court. He's a mood-setter, leader and experienced veteran. And his fundamentals are underrated even if he does not possess offensive moves. His positional sense on defense etc. were top-class. Whereas DeAndre relies alot on his athleticism to get into position and erase fundamental mistakes on getting caught out of place.

I just don't see DeAndre as a USA Center on the biggest stage that's the Olympics. I mean, USA will very likely win even with DeAndre dunking around against Centers with actual skills, and fans all over the world would think that that's the right way to play basketball, which is gonna be bad for the sport.",2016-06-11 18:26:07+00:00,d454cur,5.0,t1_d4507c3,6643.0,kings

I think, sometimes, people overrate the effectiveness of having 3 ball-needing stars on a team. LeBron, Wade and Bosh worked because they played team ball. Same goes for the 08' Celtics. Some people say OKC fked up by letting Harden go, but I truly believe that they are better without Harden, especially if he asked to be moved into the starting 5. They went to the Finals with him as 6th man. If he would be on the court with KD and Westbrook for a large part of 48 minutes, OKC would lose their effectiveness because all 3 want the ball in their hands.

2808,"Rubio is a great defender, don't get me wrong. But Rondo in his best days was a 2 x 1st Team All-Defense and 2 x 2nd Team All-Defense player. As great as Rubio is, he doesn't have such defensive achievement as Rondo. In terms of passing, Rubio has shown signs of potential when he was younger and playing in Spain. Now that he's grown up, he has tamed his game and became a more safe-first stable PG. Maybe it's because of his shot, which forces defenders to clog up passing lanes, but Rubio doesn't make cut-edge passes as much as Rondo. He still shows moments of it, I know, but Rondo does it every game.

I think it's more likely that you didn't watch Rondo play on the Boston ring teams. He was easily the 2nd best PG behind CP3 then. I've watched him play then and am watching Rubio play now and there's no way there is any sort of comparison. Rondo would go off for 15 points, 17 rebounds, 20 assists on certain nights. Rubio isn't anywhere close to being the 2nd best PG in the league.

Honestly, HONESTLY. If you really have watched Rondo play in Boston as much as Rubio is playing now, you would STRAIGHT AWAY say Rondo's better unless there's something wrong with your mind.

2812,"He has an attitude and he doesn't want to play if he's not happy with the situation he's in. In Dallas, he didn't like Rick Carlisle's system. And he also said after being traded that he hasn't try his best on defense ever since the Big 3 disbanded (probably cause Boston was a lottery team). And this year, he has been playing under a terrible coach who doesn't preach defense all year and in a team that has the worst defensive rating in the league. Pretty sure he doesn't care anymore defensively if the other 4 guys wouldn't. Rondo has an attitude. Not to mention, he had an ACL injury.

I honestly don't think a former 1st Team All-Defense player can become completely terrible on D. I think if Rondo puts in some effort, he'll still be great on D. His IQ on defense during the Boston championship runs was what made him a great defender (along with his speed and tenacity). And we all know that IQ stays with you no matter how beat down your body is. Rondo just needs to TRY.

Since they are unselfish, they choose to create chances for others and only good players are able to find spaces/convert those chances.

With guys like LeBron, a dominant SF, you can put role players around him and that would be good enough, because he has the talent and the size to score at will and have the defending team guessing what he's gonna do. A pass-first PG's talent mostly lies in passing and that means his smarts and IQ in finding teammates can only be fully utilized by talented teammates.

Billups is a great example of this. He's a pass-first PG, not an all-time great, but still great enough to be recognized.

2849,"I don't get why people overuse the word 'overall' as if to say it's a benefit. Yeah, it's nice to be all-rounded, but if your offense outweighs everything else combined, it still means you're the better player. Like how Chuck likes to say 'I think Kawhi is the best overall player in the league'. Well, yeah, you are right, Chuck, but that doesn't take away the fact that Curry is still the best player because his other-worldly offense covers up for everything else Kawhi is better at. That's why he's the MVP, the leader of the best record in NBA history. Again, all-rounded is definitely nice, but it is no value a word when discussing who's the 'best player'.

So, back to context, if what you mean by 'overall offensive game' for KD is his variety of ways to score the basketball through slashing, pull-ups, mid-range, post-ups, 3-point etc. Then, yeah, that's good. It's good to have an arsenal. But that does not mean KD is a better offensive player than Curry because you can get 2-pointers however you like, but it's value will never be a 3-pointer. Curry shot 402 3-pointers on 45.4% shooting which is flat out EFFICIENT. The absolute optimal way to score and that's shooting 3s at an incredibly accurate rate. You can't get any better than that.

I wouldn't take rebounding and passing into consideration because Durant is a SF which means more rebs and Curry is a PG which means more passes. It's not fair criteria for comparison.

I say generation in the form of playing periods. Not specifically age. LeBron was drafted in 03', Durant 07' and Curry 09'. It's safe to say what I said, because Durant came into superstardom when LeBron was halfway through his 4 MVPs, which means LBJ was the top player then. And then he got 1 top year, before Curry takes over with his other-worldly performances. You can't be the 'top of your generation' just cause you have 1 good year, just ask Kobe or Duncan. So, with that, I see him falling off his game pretty much the same time as Curry in the future and that's when someone new takes over (KAT? Wiggins? Ben Simmons?) as the top player. He will be past his chance then, so I don't think he will ever become THE 'top player of his generation'.",2016-05-31 15:36:56+00:00,d3qhbsi,9.0,t1_d3qgmdn,975.0,Thunder

Unless Curry drops massively in production within the next few seasons, I don't see it happening. I would even go on a limp and say he's no longer the best player on his team now. Westbrook is.

His defense has definitely improved, but I won't say his passing did. Averages more assist per game, sure, but his passes ain't IQ-esque like LeBron etc. Just simple, textbook passes which he didn't even pull off once he distrust his teammates in the closing moments. I wouldn't say he's a better passer, just passes more.

KD is definitely worse than Curry these past 2 years. Not sure what he could have been without the injury, but Curry is playing other-worldly right now. He's an other-worldly type of player. I ain't underrating KD, but Curry is on another tier above just cause of what he does shooting the ball. KD is a Top 10 SF in history, but Curry, within these 2 seasons shot straight up to Top 5 PG because he's just that insane. One of the best MVP seasons ever in terms of efficiency and his shooting is NOT HUMAN. With what KD did during his MVP season, he's a terrific scorer, but no one doubted if he's a human or not.

It's fkin' difficult to play ball, much say differentiate yourself from the rest of the pool and than getting EVEN better after already being a No. 1 player. This is all talk and pretty much just unrealistic.

It's like asking your top pupil in school, who got a 96 score to score a 100 the next time round. It's already fkin' difficult to get a 96, much say a 100.

I mean, if KD is to become an even better player after being a MVP, that means he should be winning a MVP the following year too. Which means he's supposed to play better than the GOAT deadeye shooter, leader of the ring team Stephen Curry. Is that even possible? It's already difficult for KD to win a MVP once and you expect him to be better than Curry later on?

Just flat out unrealistic. That's my complain about your complain.

Other than Draymond, who's an obvious douche, the rest of the team are pretty much likable. Curry is like the prototypical good guy in a story and Klay his sidekick. Bogut always seems to be upset about himself whenever he concedes a foul etc. so I kinda feel bad for him eventhough he does play dirty. Iggy is a hype-dancer from the bench. And Livingston had that terrible freak injury so no one should be against him for winning a ring. Barbosa is also admirable for still being able to play at this age eventhough his best trait is his speed that drops with age.

What makes you think that when practically NOBODY in today's league plays more than 40 minutes a game? Not Curry, not LeBron, not Harden. So what makes you think that? I also doubt that Simmons will ever have better stamina than LeBron. This is not 2K bro. Be realistic.

I understand the part where Simmons fits a stretch-4 better on the court, but when does a successful team have 2 weapons of the exact same kind? And to trade up for a 3rd pick just so he can be the 'filler' of the remaining minutes when the other stretch-4 is resting? While trading the player with the biggest post-talent since Hakeem away at that? Err..",2016-05-28 22:10:25+00:00,d3ne6eh,6.0,t1_d3na296,7179.0,sixers
2870,"First and foremost, when you refer to a bust for Ben Simmons, you have to note that the expectation for him is mega-high for his skillset. They call him a special kind, and with that, people would expect him to live up to a dominance similar to LeBron just cause his skillset is that special. We are not talking about being out of the league, or a bench player for Simmons to be a bust. We know that he will be a good player. But even if he becomes a 1 or 2-time All-Star, he would still be considered a BUST. Why? Because he is expected to become an all-time great, a Top 20 player ever. So, that takes away some ambiguity there.

Now, on to the individual. One of the biggest red flags in a player is his attitude towards the game. You can have as much talent as you want, but with a less than desired attitude, that talent will never come to fruition (see Beasley). With that said, Ben does not have a bad attitude. In fact, there's really nothing wrong about the way he carries himself. It's how much does he want to succeed. That's the question. Is he satisfied with earning a max deal and be on an All-Star team? Or does he REALLY want to win a ring and be an all-time great like Kobe, LeBron, MJ and Durant? The thing is, we've not seen that passion and drive from Simmons all these years. You can already tell that MJ wanted to be the GOAT since his North Carolina days. You can already tell that Kobe wanted to be the GOAT when he told Shaq that 'he will be the greatest' while he was a rookie. You can tell that LeBron chased so damn hard for his first ring. And you can tell that Durant wants it so bad crying to his mom. Will Simmons ever get close to those kind of passion? I doubt it. Sure, he's not a crazy bum like Michael Beasley. He's a good kid, he honestly is, but being a good kid is not enough to make you an all-time great. You must WANT it.

Skillset-wise, you can argue that shooting is very improvable and even if he can't shoot anytime soon, he can always play like Magic who was never a shooter but still the GOAT of PG. But too bad, the era is different. We are in an era that's predominant on shooting. An era where PFs are almost REQUIRED to shoot 3s. Simmons is a SF (I see him as a PF tho, but most of you go with SF so Imma just roll). There is no place for him in this era if he can't shoot for shyt playing outside. It's the cold-hard truth. If this was in the 80s, no doubt, Simmons will be the consensus No. 1 pick, but no, scouts are crazy over Ingram's 41% 3-point field goal to Simmons 1 out of 3 attempts from deep.

Again, Simmons' skillset is special. 6 foot 10 ball-handler, smarts, playmaking. Those are traits that you named that make him who he is, a special talent. BUT. Better defender? Ingram's wingspan might make him the better defender long-term. Better scorer? Ingram's skillset translates into a better scorer in the NBA (again, shooting). Simmons is not OUTSTANDING in terms of athleticism on the next level. He's above average and great for a 6 foot 10, but against the Griffins, LeBrons and Westbrooks? Err.. he's alright. Strength and rebounding are bad arguments because Simmons is a PF/SF while Ingram is strictly SF, so of course he loses in those.

Ingram is also younger and has room for his muscles to grow. Simmons is well-built, yes. But he seems to have gotten his muscles toned since young and we dunnoe if he can improve them much more than what they are now. Ingram is skinny af, so he can always grow a ton of muscles and might become MUCH better as a player then.",2016-05-28 21:57:48+00:00,d3ndrjg,7.0,t1_d3n9p1w,7083.0,sixers

And with Okafor having shown that his post moves are already arguably the best since Hakeem, I don't see why you would trade Okafor for Bender.

I mean, you would rather have a full 48 minutes rotating 3-point shooting big men to make sure your PF is always a 3-point shooter than having the option to switch it up and give the opponents different looks by having a 3-point big in Saric and then forcing them to adapt by putting on a completely different style of big man in the inside-dominating Okafor?

2874,"Well, first and foremost, we aren't saying Ingram will be KD. Fans obviously wish for the best among these prospects and thus, we keep comparing Ingram to KD because his CEILING is indeed KD. That's the best that he can be. But in all fairness, KD was a far more polished scorer in Texas than Ingram was in Duke, but physical profile wise, they are very similar, tho Ingram has a long way to go to even get near KD's level.

He can very well end up a Tayshaun Prince too, but that's unlikely, considering his talent and potential is already greater than Tayshaun's. Tayshaun Prince came in as a 3&amp;D guy, a solid perimeter defender who can hit that perimeter shot. Ingram has already shown that he can be better than that. He got successful isos in Duke, getting by guys with his handles and is deceptively strong for that skinny body frame as he occasionally charges right into bigger guys to draw fouls. Tayshaun, at any stage of his career, is never ever a consistent iso-guy, so there's that.

To put it simply, talent-wise, KD &gt; Ingram &gt;&gt; Prince. That's why we never really compare Ingram to Prince because he's technically already better.

Edit: Also, Ingram's game leans more towards offense than defense. KD is obviously an offensive powerhouse, while Tayshaun has always been known for his defense. So playstyle-wise, he seems to be the type that focuses on offense.",2016-05-28 18:21:42+00:00,d3n6dyq,7.0,t1_d3n5g6c,1687.0,sixers

The reason why he's overrated is that I don't see him as a franchise player for the Lakers. He can very well make a few All-Stars, but I don't see him being a shoo-in constant starter year in year out. Maybe 1 or 2 borderline All-Star appearances.

2879,"Tbh, every trade that's going to happen can yield benefits. Trade Embiid and he may prove to be injured his entire career (like Oden) and that's a benefit. Trade Noel and he may prove to be just a defensive guy who wouldn't fit on this team if he had stayed because Embiid is already that 2-way beast. Trade Okafor and he may prove to have attitude problems and a one-dimensional player who's only good in the post and would just be a 6th man off the bench for this team.

Really, if you see it that way, there could all possibly be benefits. Even if the one Philly trade turns out to be a beast player, the other core players who stayed may very well all become beast too and still win a ring as a team. 

See OKC as that prime example. They chose Ibaka over Harden and Harden started balling in Houston and people thought OKC would be better if Harden stayed since he's now a superstar. But hell no, that wouldn't be the case. Because Harden needs the ball like KD and WB and there can only be 1 ball at a time with KD and WB being beasts themselves.

2905,"First off, credits to your bravery.

On to the main point, a big YES to playoffs being different from regular season. Regular season is 82 games long. And at the end of the day, the point of it is just to get a higher seed for the playoffs. Playoffs is where the true competition starts. All about the championship. Win or go home. So you can bet the key players will be playing crazy minutes and they will all put in their 100%. Every game matters now. Sad to say, as much fun the regular season can be, the games actually don't matter. And hence, you see some games where key players put in just 50% effort, you see games where players with bad drive don't really care about winning, you see games where bench players get to start (especially the last 15 games, nearing playoffs).

So, TL;DR. Playoffs have key players play 40+ minutes to 30+ in regular season, have fans' intensity multiply, have players' urgencies at 100% and that is when a team's maximum potential can be showcased.

As Charles Barkley often says and I agree, the Thunder ON PAPER, has the most talented team in the NBA. A team full of young, athletic players who can play, while led by 2 superstars in KD and Westbrook. The Thunder kinda just cruised their way through the reg season (like I explained before) and are only getting serious at this period of time. Their main problems in the regular season are that they fell apart in the 4th quarters and KD and Westbrook overused 'hero-ball' where each one of them will take turns going 1 on 1 and not care about their teammates. Now, they are balancing everything perfectly. Trusting everyone and being unselfish, especially Westbrook. Westbrook's evolution this playoffs is unprecedented. You think a crazy talker like him would be naturally selfish but he is really a team player right now. And that's how Thunder triumph.

I don't think they are a mis-match to OKC. I just think the Thunder are playing to their max potential at the right time + GSW are destroying themselves. And here are my reasons:

1) They don't seem to have the urge to want their 2nd ring as much as Thunder want their first. Even Curry, the 'unwavered' one, is playing sloppily, outmatched by Westbrook's intensity.

2) They panic and can't keep within their 'flawless' system that they preach so much in the 73-9 run. After OKC ruined some of their possessions, the Warriors become messy and just go iso-Curry or iso-Draymond which are really not their game at all. They aren't pulling off the 73-9 system.

3) Shooting is the most volatile mechanic in the game. It can look great when every shot is falling, but it's as likely as the team going cold because alot of factors are attributed to getting off a good shot. Intense series in the playoffs take away the condition of a player. By the time they get into their shot fighting through screens, run out of stamina defending guys more athletic, they wouldn't be in perfect condition to get a good shot off like how one usually gets during practice etc.

4) GSW are mentally weak. They can put on a confident facade before because everything was going their way. Just won a ring and seem to be 'unstoppable' after that 73-9 record. Now, they are on the brink of defeat, 1-3 against a great team. Draymond is getting trashed around for being a dirty player and they finally realise that they aren't all that after getting beaten by a dysfunctional Rockets team once and played 4 out of 5 close games against Portland and now, in this predicament. The truth is that their gap in prowess compared to other teams aren't as great as 73-9 sounds. And the team's confidence is at an all-time low.

The officiating overall in this playoffs are pretty bad compared to other years'. Alot of controversial calls made EVEN MORE controversial after reviews. But it shouldn't be an excuse because they are not one-sided and the refs aren't favoring one team to another. They are just equally bad on both sides.

2) The difference is that he's actually a stable keeper who has the potential to be our long-term keeper solution much like Pepe was in 00s. Not error-prone like Migs and we can all agree that Migs will not be our long-term keeper from the way he carries himself.

3) Probably cause that's just his academy contract? And Mainz at that. Not knocking on them, but they aren't that large a club to have young prospects signing huge release clauses like bigger clubs.

2926,"They just can't keep up athletically. You can do all that consistently well throughout the regular season cause most of the teams aren't up to your standard and you can cruise by them while resting Curry in 4th quarters to get ample rest before playing 1 game against a great team and continue on with 10 games against scrub teams as the cycle continues.

Now, playoff basketball started. It's all business and every team you face are legit great teams (other than first-rounders). GSW are honestly not a very athletic team. They are a finesse team that rely on their system. Bogut is old, Curry and Klay aren't known to be athletic and Draymond is a little out-of-shape. Against a full-on athletic team like OKC, you are bound to get outclassed physically. Westbrook, Durant, Ibaka, Roberson and Adams? Waiters off the bench? Come on now.

Many don't realise it, but as much as a 3-point shooting team sounds unstoppable when you actually hit most of those 3s, it's a very volatile system because shooting is the most volatile mechanic of the game. You need to run a hell lot to get open looks and have to make sure that your legs and arms are in tip-top conditions in order to get your shooting mechanics on-point. A whole post-season of intense basketball is bound to wear you down such that it's impossible to pull off a great shooting system as a team anymore.

People like to say other fans gave this excuse after GSW won a championship. The excuse that's Curry never faced true competition throughout the playoffs last year. Now, on hindsight, it seems to be true. An injured Holiday (Norris Cole even), Nick Calathes, Jason Terry and Dellavedova the whole way? Dellavedova actually made Curry bad enough to not win the Finals MVP. Now, he's facing full strength squads of top-tier PGs. He escaped Beverley's hounding defense due to injury (arguable, since the injury itself can be attributed to Beverley's physicality) and later on, Damian Lillard and Russell Westbrook.

If you play the last 10-15 games with your 100% effort like it's the playoffs chasing for 73, it's bound to have an effect on your bodies. Especially when other playoff teams gave their starters rest and replenishing. You never know, Curry's knee might have actually sustained that Game 1 tweak or that Game 4 slip if he had ample rest. And he might not be struggling now in the WCF if he had been healthy throughout and played every game up till now. It all stacks up.

'OKC is a bad match-up'. This is starting to become an excuse, seriously. SAS said it after they lost and now the GSW? The old ones complained and now the young ones complain, how does this all add up? Bad match-up, bad match-up, bad match-up. OKC is on course to winning 2 historic teams over 7 games each. 73-9 and 67-15. Let's admit it, OKC ARE A GREAT TEAM. No more bad match-up excuses. OKC are great, that's it. OKC's length and athleticism bothered the SAS too because SAS are old and that's why they played Adams and Kanter inside to make use of their length advantage. How can GSW use that same excuse? They are much younger than SAS and Kanter barely even played this series.

Now, you have to play a whole series of back-to-back-to-back games against the 2nd best PG in the NBA. I might go on a limp and say that Westbrook may actually be Curry's kryptonite.

Put Westbrook on Curry and you got a physical specimen wearing you down while being unable to outrun him cause he's just as fast. And then, once he gets a steal, there's no way to track him on defense cause he's a one-man fast break.

So back to the point, yes, Rudy could be any team's cornerstone, but the key word here is COULD. Everyone should know by now that dude is famed for 'never being the player that he COULD be'. He got drafted 8th overall in the same draft as Rondo, performed well in Memphis (at one point, their No. 1 option and most intriguing young prospect) and everyone thought he had the potential to be a 2-way star and a future All-Star. Sadly, for some reason, he didn't make it that far. I think everyone believes that he can no longer grow to be that kind of player because it's been 10 years and he's probably starting to stagnate, but will still be awesome if he happens to go through.

Rudy and DeMar have very similar games, yes. Athletic slashers that are good scorers. I'd say Rudy has better defense and 3-point shot while DeMar has a better mid-range game and passion for the game.

I've seen so many games where Ben Mac would brick 3s when he's pretty much wide open and we would have needed 1 or 2 of those to stay in the game. That's unacceptable for a NBA player.

If you see how he shoots during his workouts, there's really no reason for him to miss easy ones when guys like JR Smith can give you tough ones. Ben Mac has a smooth stroke and he makes it look effortless, while doing standing 3s too.

Those questions were directed to your 'how do you explain Warriors winning Cavs this year in the reg season'. Here's the answers:

Rockets: Last season is not this season.
GSW and Spurs: Regular season is not playoffs.

And for the OKC one, you just counter argued yourself. The OKC were weakened because their star was injured. FACT? Okay. Holiday was a Top 3 player on the Pelicans. Conley was a Top 2 player on Memphis. Beverley and Motiejunas were 2 starters on the Rockets. And we don't even need to talk about Kyrie and Kevin. These are not a bunch of Scalabrines, Morrisons and Odens we are talking about. They aren't scrubs who come in for garbage time and they don't have an injury history to them.

2968,"Then that proves my point. The Warriors deserve an asterisk last year and the Cavs don't. Simple.

The fatigue one experiences in the playoffs is stacked. I'm not saying the Warriors couldn't win the whole thing against full strength squads, because they are incredible, they are the favorites and they definitely can. I'm saying they got a MUCH easier route than it should have been because of the injuries and that's the 'asterisk' there. MUCH easier route. How can you go against 4 straight teams missing a starter or 2 each and think that it isn't easier? It is.

Again, fatigue stacks. Imagine this. If Holiday had played healthy, Curry would have felt more fatigue in the first round and Warriors might have lost 1 game too, so they've got to play 5 games. Then, entering the 2nd round, if Conley had played instead of Nick 'out of the league' Calathes, Curry would have even more competition and fatigue from it and Memphis might have won a few more games. And then, if there's Beverley and his hounding defense, it's undeniable Curry would have gotten alot more stress than Jason 'too old to guard MVP' Terry. And Houston might of won more games too (Don't come at me with an example of this year's first round, we all know that Houston was a different beast then and Warriors ain't this good). And comes the Finals. With all the increased fatigue Warriors have gotten against full strength squads, they now have to win against the Big 3 and not just LeBron, in which they scrapped out a 4-2 win. More fatigue in previous rounds + Kyrie and Kevin might actually be enough to edge out the Warriors. It all stacks up.

Inability of the organizations to build strong, capable teams in the East cause the conference to be weak. That's not 'unlucky', that's incompetence.

2) Rondo has been one of my fave players for now. I'm an unselfish guy, and I always aim to pass to the open man even when I have an open shot myself and Rondo gives me that vibe so well. Add on to the fact that I think post moves are the most beautiful and artistic skill set in the game and you have Boogie.

3) I always admire people who have an alpha attitude and do whatever they do confidently, even when there's moments when they have to bring about conflict. I'm a quiet guy in real life, so I look up to guys who express themselves well and not give a fk about what other people think, that's Boogie and Rondo.

4) Always been very impressed with the Kings' loyal and loud fanbase. I remember, during the Artest-KMart days when the Kings were not any good, their home arena was still so fkin' loud I'm like 'chill guys, this ain't the playoffs'. Loyalty is one of my values.

5) I think Kings' purple gives them a special identity among the league. Lots of repetitive colors around, but when you think of purple, you think of Kings and that makes things fresh.

WCS has shown that he CAN play and NBA is where he belongs. No night does he look like he's a liability with turnovers or 'too unskilled for the league'. He almost always contributes. And that's enough to suggest that he won't be a bust, which is especially crucial to us. This is the least WCS can do and I'm fine with that as a 6th pick, but he will surely go further as time goes.

He won't be a foundation piece, because, with what he has to offer, I don't think his arsenal is of the franchise cornerstone level. He will be a very awesome complimentary piece in the future, but to build around him.. Nah. Unless by 'foundation piece' you mean a necessary player for us moving forward then yes, he definitely is. He won't be traded anytime soon, that's for sure.

What makes him so important for us is how he compliments Boogie so well. This guy is the gazelle version of big man, plays defense to Boogie's offense, is the 'shut up and just work hard and play' type to Boogie's 'noisiness'. He has the perfect personality for a player at his level. Humble, but confident, let the game do the talking and has insane work ethic.

Rondo is a Top 10 PG in the league. What he had to prove was that he's not the Dallas Rondo with the impression that he couldn't run no more and can't play with a coach not named Doc Rivers.

**2nd - Lakers select BEN SIMMONS** (No brainer here.)

**3rd - Celtics (via Nets pick) select DRAGAN BENDER** (The Celtics are in the playoffs and have legit fight in the well-balanced Eastern Conference. With Sullinger-Amir as their bigs duo, I see them picking Bender for more inside talent to stash for the future. He would be a good bait in case of a trade for a superstar too.)

**4th - Phoenix Suns select JAYLEN BROWN** (Hield is a very tempting prospect here on out. But with Bledsoe and Booker on board, there's no way they'd draft a SG. PJ Tucker is solid, but getting old so they need future at the SF spot with Len developing inside.)

**5th - Wolves select KRIS DUNN** (Rubio's lack of scoring is hindering this talented squad long-term. With Lavine at SG, their weakest spot lies at PG. Could change if the coach sees Lavine as more of a Harden-esque 6th man tho.)

**6th - Pelicans select BUDDY HIELD** (A best talent available pick. Eric Gordon is not their SG moving forward, so it's likely they'd draft a SG and trade Gordon away. There's a chance that they draft for needs and Poeltl goes off the boards instead since Asik&amp;Perkins..)

If you lose because of it, blame it on yourself for keeping it close. It's that simple.

I've lost a few competitive games in my life because of bad officiating and it hurts. It really does. But I felt that it's destined. And that's why I can't stand people explicitly nit-picking the ref's one single call when the game is 48 minutes long. It just makes them look so ignorant.

And yes, I see Simmons as a PF to start his pro-career because he's 6 foot 10 and can't shoot for shit YET. Philly would be the most lop-sided team in the league as they would have a stacked pool of talents at bigs compared to wings (Ish Smith, D-Leaguer Covington and CANAAN as starters), so it's very likely that they finally draft a perimeter talent and Ingram (some say he's a better prospect because Simmons has great bust potential) will be a good start.

For Murray, he's actually a combo guard who can play both positions. He started off in high school dominating the ball playing PG more against weaker opponents and played SG to Tyler Ulis' PG in Kentucky. But when made to run PG at college level, some say he wasn't effective because his ball-handling skills aren't up to standard. One thing's for sure, he's a lights out shooter.

Individually, he's never had the expertise nor the X and Os to coach. And have you seen him on Inside the NBA as Kenny's replacement? Holy shit, dude is dull as fk.

Kidd is a great coach. He just has an attitude that made him clash with the FOs. Remember, Brooklyn went on a winning spree at the end of the season into the playoffs when they started the season rock bottom. He also brought Milwaukee to 5th seed last year, but because Greg Monroe proved to be a flop, they couldn't make it this year. Yet, by the end of the season, Kidd is smart enough to use Giannis as a point forward who ran terror and now everyone is anticipating what Milwaukee will be like next year.

Kenny knows his craft. Whenever he talks on TNT, I always think that he'll make a great coach. The only problems are 1) Whether players will respect Coach Kenny with their impression of him being the funny guy behind the desk. 2) How are his X and Os. He's great in analysis, but we don't get to see much X and Os from TNT.

Add on to the fact that he needs to have the ball in his hands to do his thing and the NBA doesn't allow you to do that as much as in college. In LSU, he's the star and he can handle the ball as much as he wants. NBA's PGs are top-level.

This dude only just came into the league and is a legit 3rd pick with the smoothest post moves since Hakeem. Lots of teams would want him. That doesn't mean we shouldn't trade him because we are definitely TOO stacked at the bigs.

Embiid has the best potential out of all these guys because of his 2-way game. He has offensive potential with his range and would most likely be a great defender, with great size too. Noel probably will just be a great defender at most, but that's not a knock by any means. Saric is a good stretch 4 in this era and the only true PF out of these 4. I see Saric starting with Embiid and Noel coming off the bench for defense, though things may change if Saric proves to be a bust.

Why I think Okafor will never fit's because, firstly, he seems to have an ego. So, he's very likely unwilling to come off the bench. But with his lack of defense and rebounding, he's just gonna be a 6th man instant offense type of player like Enes Kanter and he isn't gonna start at C with Embiid there.

Simmons have TOO MANY things to work on currently, and he does not have the privilege of an easy transition because it's now a less traditional 'shooting era', and guess what's Simmons' No. 1 weakness? That's right. If he has LeBron's level of work ethic, he'll turn out great, but he doesn't. LeBron's drive and passion is among the greatest in this sport.

Ingram's ceiling is a less polished and less athletic Kevin Durant.

He can be a Top 50 player, but not a Top 20 like Simmons can. BUT, Ingram will most likely have a smooth learning curve in this league and will very likely not be a bust.

3203,"It's not about deserving more minutes or not. It's about the responsibility of a coach who needs to give and take. Your best players are fielded to win games, that's their objective. But there's also objectives for rookies and sophomores that is to get NBA-level exposure on the court so that they can improve via experience. Even if a certain rookie is tragic/shit, he still needs time on the court, at least in his first year. How the hell are we gonna know if a rookie has potential to improve when he only plays like 4 garbage minutes per game for maybe 20 games out of 82?

It's a coach's job to make sure the rookies get the best facilities and chances to improve. You don't draft a guy, work him in the gym and in practice and then sit him on the bench the whole year. That's not giving him opportunities and it's also demoralizing.

And don't tell me he should play the main 5 when you are up 30 - 50 points in a game. Those games are for rookies to come in and try their best for a legit 20 minutes.

3212,"Great conference. Some takeaways I have:

* Gotta point out that Vlade is really smart in waiting and expecting more established coaches to be fired in the playoffs. That must have been a factor to why he 'took a long process'. We were all crazy about coaches without a job in this sub and failed to identify those who might get the axe because of an underachieving post-season. That's really smart of Vlade.

* Joerger is very well-spoken and seems like he knows alot about the game and is confident in what he's doing. The kind to have a good balance of superiority and being grounded.

* He also seems to be more humane than some Grizz fans made him out to be. They were sayin' how he's very political with his answers and doesn't like to express depth. He comes across as a detailed and humane person with his jokes about the 12-year contract etc., his acknowledgment of the Kings' golden era in the 00s and the passionate fanbase along with a nice touch about his family being from the countryside who love the small market towns.

* Also said that he will be direct with the personnel, no talking behind the backs, so he's well-aware of what Boogie wants from his coach.

* No beating around the bush about DEFENSE and expressed the importance of it well. Always great to have the No. 1 problem turned into a main priority moving forward.

* Another Grizz fan was right in that how Memphis played under Joerger isn't the style that defines him. He wanted to push the pace, but with the Grizz 'slow' roster, according to him, he couldn't. So it's unfair to judge Joerger on how the Grizz played.

* Seems like a passionate hardworker who respects Vlade well.

They give the team a style of play. Karl introduced a fast-paced game which didn't suit the team with DMC and played no defense. Other coaches train the players on the defensive end and only run a few PnR plays on offense. All these dictate the teams' identity and effectiveness.

The 2 teams can continue to be in the playoffs with new players, no need to keep pampering the old ones with undeserved $$ cause the teams ain't going nowhere. 

You can sit your selfish butt down cause Mike Conley is going elsewhere.

Things that Darren Collison won't be able to pull off. 'Fast-paced' ain't just about being speedy like Collison or just pushing the ball like a George Karl system. There's also the creativity part of that game, which stemmed from Rondo being Rondo.

You don't see people calling Boogie and Collison a one-two punch, but you do see people calling Boogie-Rondo 'best duo in the league'. Why's that? Because Rondo gives the team an identity. Before this season, the teams were merely thought of as 'trash'.

Playoff defense is much better than regular season's cause the best players of each team are used and they're locked in 100% defensively. It's not hard to see that DeRozan gets stopped more effectively when trying to slash in the playoffs than in regular season. And what does he rely on when the lanes get taken away? Pull-up mid-range fallaway jumpers which are bad shots that hurt his FG% cause he isn't a great shooter. He's also not a 3-point threat that's why his defenders always sag off and pack the paint to prevent his drives. Raptors' offense also stops often when the ball reaches him, showing that he's not a ball-movement player ala bad passing game. It's not hard to see.

TL;DR - Once you take away DeRozan's drives into the lane, he becomes inefficient. I don't need to watch past 1st round Game 1 to tell, when he gets outplayed heavily by fellow All-Star PG13.

Draymond will never be the best player on any team. He's the perfect glue guy who gets to play in the perfect system for his playstyle and got glorified because of it. John Wall, on the other hand, is a bonafide star on the Wizards. Put Draymond on the Wizards team and take away John Wall. Who's gonna be your go-to man? Draymond? LOL. He's only this good getting triple-doubles because he's playing behind Curry and Thompson. Again, he's great, but not individually a star. Only in the right system. Whereas, John Wall is a star wherever he goes.

And stay living 2 seasons back. How long are you gonna use 'runner-up for MVP' on Harden? He won't even be in Top 5 voting this year. Stay in the past, goon.

Durant is a more efficient Harden who is also a better leader and leading OKC with a solid chance at contention. Doesn't matter if he's as good as pre-injury, he's still a Top 4 player in the league. This guy is leading the team playing neck-and-neck with the great Spurs whereas Harden's team got entirely embarrassed in the first round by Curry-less Warriors.

**Ewing** - 13 years as assistant coach means he has more than enough experience to get a HC tryout. Would probably play through Boogie since he's a great big man himself. Speaks well, but it's rare for great players to be great coaches.

He'll play 20-30 minutes a game and sit out the 4th, or come in from the bench, because of his defense. Plus the fact that the game is moving away from letting big-men post up, the focus has to be on being a versatile big, but Okafor is far from versatile. The post is all he's got!

And also, I'm quite skeptical about his future improvement not just on defense, but even on offense. I think there's only so much you can do in the post. He seems to be at the peak of post game and I can hardly see room for improvement in regards to his post-play. On the other end, I don't think he has much to offer on defense too because of his lack of athleticism. He doesn't run fast nor does he jump high. Sure, he can improve on his positioning, but that doesn't go as plan for alot of stars who are still consistently bad on D (Melo, Kevin Love, Kanter etc.)

If we fail to make significant off-season moves, then having Collison as starter may actually work better since Rondo needs good teammates to maximize his impact.

3665,"So, in your opinion, all these teams are gonna get better? How do you have every team getting better and none getting worse? Is this real life? Be realistic.

Grizzlies and Mavs are just gonna go downhill from now. Grizzlies' play style is out of favour. Zach Randolph at PF isn't gonna cut it in this fast-paced small-ball era and they don't have anyone to fit in for them. Mavs are deproving every year. They make the playoffs yearly, yes, but they're always the bottom few seeds. Dirk is not ageless, he's becoming mortal. I don't see them contending if they continue to make Dirk start at PF and throw in pieces around him. They've been doing that since 11'.

It's pretty obvious Harden doesn't give a damn about winning. He's a great player with the wrong attitude. Iso ball will be the downfall of the Rockets. And with Harden there, it's not gonna change.

Pelicans are injured, but even when healthy, they have a dysfunctional line-up. Asik&amp;Perkins is probably the worst C combi in the league. Tyreke Evans is an unorthodox PG. They need pieces.

The Suns lack an inside threat. Len is still developing. Either Bledsoe or Knight will be traded. They are still 2 seasons away from being good.

I personally still think the Jazz are in need of a star, but they can still be the Hawks of the West through system play.

Kings are gonna be good once they get a good coach. They are the older version of T-Wolves. You tellin' me Cousins, Rondo and Rudy aren't talented? WCS is the young talent. They have a good bench with Collison, Casspi, Koufos and Seth. Once we get a functional coach, you'll see.",2016-04-21 19:17:59+00:00,d2c2whg,6.0,t1_d2by759,6034.0,kings

With Ray Allen-Sam Cassell-Glenn Robinson, Melo-AI and Melo-Billups, he should have at least won 1 ring, but he didn't. Denver were first-round defeats almost every year when Melo was there.

Rudy has been a capable defender for the most part of his career not counting effort. And people write Rondo off WAY too soon.

Celtics won't get any much better with Butler over Crowder at SF. What Butler adds is a little more firepower on offense. That's about it. He isn't even a good shooter. To add picks along with Crowder? Nahh. I won't pull that move if I'm Boston. Would rather focus on Al Horford.

And I also won't do the Gay for Matthews trade. It's pretty lateral tbh. Gay did pretty well this season for the most part, but Matthews struggled. What makes you think he won't struggle if he comes here? If you get Wes in exchange for Gay, you'll get a starting SG but also give up a starting SF. Casspi is by no means a starting SF.

I'm an Asian myself, so let me weigh in on this. Yao's impact in Asia was MASSIVE when he first entered the league. I felt it first-hand even when I was 8 with no interest in basketball whatsoever. It's just this buzz that kept me reading news about him everytime the Rockets had a game. Yao formed a bridge between Asia, mostly China and America. He literally gave people hope that basketball truly 'has no boundaries'. Yao is the MJ to the Chinese like how MJ himself is to Americans. Yao is a living legend in the field of basketball to the Chinese. The whole nation started caring about basketball because of Yao. And it's not like America didn't care either. They saw a 7 foot 6 who can shoot the ball, post-up and hit FTs. They saw a potential rival to the dominant Shaq during that era. And Yao lived up to that. Shaq and Yao are arguably the only top-tier Cs in the league in the 00s (you can add Orlando Dwight in, which I think is justified).

All in all, Yao's impact on and OFF the court justifies his position as a first-ballot HOF. Remember, this is a BASKETBALL HOF, so it's not just how the inductees had an impact on American basketball, cause for Yao's case, his impact in China is greater than alot of the top-top players that were already inducted.",2016-04-06 13:01:27+00:00,d1s1nsx,3.0,t1_d1ru7lp,23187.0,kings

I've been reading alot of your comments and you have a really great depth in reading basketball, but I'm just disagreeing with this one).

I disapprove of his frequent forceful passes to Boogie off a 1-2 while disregarding the other 3 players, but he also made a lot of quick outlets that I know only Rondo can make (not just among Sac players, but maybe even among the league) which lead to baskets.

More importantly, can you imagine the team without Rondo? Rondo's literally like the only guy who knows what's going on every second of the game. Even Cousins seems blur most of the time. The games that we played without him, we looked directionless. It's also  an unseen factor that affected our play the whole season. The fact that we do not have level-headed veterans for support other than Caron Butler and Rondo (who still has his fair share of childish moments).

It's not just movements, but also doing the optimal things at the right time and playing with angles. It's all about critical thinking. You see Rondo's pocket pass through 2 players everytime he plays pick-n-roll with Cousins? That pass is of high difficulty, but he makes it look easy by succeeding almost everytime. The 2 NBA-level defenders would have closed that pocket or just put a hand down to make a steal, but they usually couldn't because Rondo knows the exact timing and angle to catch them off-guard. There's more to just basketball that's on the surface. The players play mind games too to have a significant advantage over the other guy and that's why players who are known to have bad athleticism can succeed so well, like John Stockton for example.

For McLemore's case, here's a few examples. This game, I saw him sped past everyone on a fast break but didn't slow down at the end to stabalize himself for the lay-up, thus, missing an open one. Then, he'll see Rondo passing the ball to him at the corner in rhythm, but with a full shot-clock and he'll take the 3 falling away and brick it.

3948,"I've been a big fan of George Karl ever since his Denver days (I love Iverson and Melo) and has recently gotten into the Kings and I have to admit that this isn't working at all for him. He needs to do SOMETHING. He has been stubborn with his tactics and stuck to it game after game even though they're UNDERPERFORMING. How does a team with Cousins-Rondo-Gay not make the 8th seed? Their defense has been ATROCIOUS and I'm saddened when Coach Karl mentioned that he would rather lose than change his playstyle.. That's not how a good coach coaches. Either get his act straight or at least trade for somebody before the deadline. A change of scenery is a MUST.

PS: I do think that his playstyle isn't suited for mordern day ball because we've seen alot of double teams inside while leaving 3-point shots open which IS VERY PUNISHABLE in this modern era. Coach seems to still think that 3-point shots are the hardest to make when the era has been greatly shifted to hitting them and that's why we are giving shitty teams like Brooklyn 63% 3PT FG kind of game. He's not coaching Payton-Kemp no more, he should realise that.

Now, in a terrible defensive scheme, he's just one of them players. Maybe he isn't trying, but let's be real, the team can't be rock bottom in defensive ratings if Rondo is still the FIRST-TEAM All-D level defender. I agree that WCS is great, but he's still young and has to do too much to cover up his teammates' loopholes. He's still doing a great job though, with the lack of help he gets. Boogie is limited by his lateral movements, but he's a solid team defender.

I felt an impending effect ever since after that Hornets loss. I mean, as fans, it was heartbreaking, but imagine how much the players take the toll when they're the ones fighting hard till the last second? Cousins must be thinking 'So, even a career-high can't win us games huh?' Gave them the benefit of doubt cause they were tired against Portland, but the NO and Memphis ones were just.. They look far from how they played during the 5-game winning run. Almost no fastbreak opportunities and lots of sloppy movements. Knowing that NO had their 3 MOST IMPORTANT players missing, they should come out with a BANG, but got caught up in the Ryan Anderson firing show who ironically, is a trade option for the Kings. Then having to fight for a last minute 'catch-up' battle with Memphis when they could have just not let them get such a big-lead in the first place. I expect Rondo to be the emotional leader, but if it's not working, George Karl needs to do something for sure as the coach. The whole team looks mentally drained.

Also, our defense has been atrocious. When our offensive flow gets destroyed, we just let them walk to the basket on the other end. It's just a disaster to watch. Ben McLemore, the most athletically gifted guy, is a disappointment in the IQ department. Cousins is also very unstable on his ankles, having twisted them numerous times every other game and then being landed a K.O. blow by Marc. Needs to work on that and also, being more resourceful and aggressive on offense.

3996,"He's bad. It's not like we're lacking premium shooters, cause we've got a former 3-point contest winner in Belinelli and a guy shooting better percentage than him this year in Casspi. Devin is a rookie, but he's making clumsy mistakes and has trouble creating shots for himself. Suns fans are even wondering why the f he's in the starting line-up EVEN WITH Eric Bledsoe out. LOL. So, no thanks.

PS: Eventhough I think Ben McLemore is our weakest link, I'd still take him over Devin.",2016-01-20 10:05:05+00:00,cz51rra,1.0,t3_41swm3,16756.0,kings
3997,"Taeyang has the best eye-smile, dance moves and soulful voice in the whole of K-pop! Not to mention, he's everyone's young BAE! :DDD",2016-01-14 03:13:33+00:00,cyxhslg,1.0,t3_3tx901,4471024.0,bigbang
3998,"Oh, seems like BIGBANG drew in another new fan. What's fresh? LOL. Well, you've got yourself a ride and ain't gonna regret it cause BIGBANG are a legendary group respected by Koreans and are known for their musicality. Which makes their songs arguably the most popular among any acts in Korea while selling extremely well.

Without further ado, Imma just name out some of their hits. They are definitely worth a listen cause, why else would Koreans love them to make them hits? :D

Here goes:
BIGBANG as group: Lies (breakout song that made them publicly recognized 2 years into debut), Last Farewell, Haru Haru (to me, their most iconic), Sunset Glow (happiest song in K-pop history), Tonight, Love Song, Blue, Bad Boy, FANTASTIC BABY, Loser, Bang Bang Bang, Bae Bae, Let's Not Fall in Love.

Solos:
G-Dragon: Crooked, Heartbreaker
Taeyang: Wedding Dress, Eyes Nose Lips (2014 Song of the Year)
T.O.P: Turn It Up, Of All Days
Seungri: GG Be, Come To My
Daesung: Baby Don't Cry, Shut Up

Units:
GD&amp;TOP: Oh Yeah, Baby Goodnight
GDxTAEYANG: Good Boy, Stay With Me

Enjoy! Like a poster said above, it will take a few weeks as you savour and sink deeper into their beautiful music.",2015-11-20 01:45:22+00:00,cx6fath,1.0,t3_3t8kg6,173203.0,bigbang
