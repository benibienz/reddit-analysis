I wasn't born when he played, but I do know by ear that he's one of our greatest goalkeeping talents ever along with Ray Clemence.

Just how good is he? I saw a few clips of him quarreling with his teammates for their mistakes, which reminds me of my favorite keeper ever, Oliver Kahn. A great leader from the back. Is he as commanding as he seems? What's his biggest strengths? How's his legacy? Because he doesn't seem to get talked alot around here. How is he ranked in our history against guys like Clemence and Reina?

Some names I can come up with off the top of my head who are competing with Karius (apart from Neuer):

Bernd Leno, Marc Andre Ter Stergen (current back-ups in the NT)

Fahrmann and Timo Horn.

With that in mind,

Matip in for Lovren. Matip hasn't been playing much since his injury, so it's good to give him a confidence booster. Lovren has been playing alot, so it's a good time for a rest.

Milner in for Moreno. Get him in shape after his injury. I'd still have Moreno start for Tottenham since he has a knack for doing well against them, but subsequently, it will be all Milner's.

Grujic-Can midfield 2. Grujic deserves some game time and Can has only came on as a sub against Arsenal. Good chance to see what these 2 can do as a duo.

Lallana playing in the hole as a No. 10. Always wanted to see what he can do there and Firmino can get some rest.

Sturridge up top. He needs to play when fit. I know our improved depth has cause us to not focus too much on Daniel, but he has been a talisman for years and we need to get him playing and keep him happy.

Keep Coutinho and Mane in the line-up to maintain their high standards of play going into the Tottenham game.

               Mignolet

Wijnaldum to come in some time as a super-sub and Origi too. Can't see the rest playing unless we absolutely need more defense/leadership.

I see alot of Lewandowski's game in Origi. Pretty big and tall, with a great footwork and originally an out-and-out striker. I think the reason to Klopp slightly preferring Origi over Sturridge at the end of last season, was because he saw a little Lewandowski in him too. Sure, he needs to bulk up and work on his finishing, but dude has got what it takes to become the same type of player for us, imo.

Problem is, I don't think I saw Klopp playing Origi behind a main striker or in the midfield 3.. I may be wrong tho. What do you guys think of Origi as a No. 10?

**1) Klay Thompson:** My 3rd choice in the regular season, but his post-season performances just stamped it all for me. Greatest shooter in the game today bar his partner in crime. Takes over games. 2-way beast.

**2) James Harden:** Hate him for his defense, but easily the best shot creator at his position today. Draws fouls easy. Deceptively crazy handles because of his size. Strong as a bull and has wide shoulders to create separation. Can playmake and is a triple-double threat when given the opportunity to run the point.

**3) Jimmy Butler:** Top of my list pre-injury. Didn't come back strong, but a great 2-way player. Is to slashing the way Klay is to shooting. Can run the point too. Egoistic. Better as a 2nd option if on a contender than a 1st.

**4) Dwyane Wade:** Still Top 5 today at 34 being the All-Time great he is. Further proving his solid fundamentals that he relies on more as he ages. Mid-range. 2-way. Clutch as always.

**5) DeMar DeRozan:** Was a toss up between Wade and him in the reg season, but I'm settling for him at 5 because of the contrast in clutch v choke. Elite slasher and mid-range, but a hole on defense. Athleticism on point.

**6) CJ McCollum:** Really came into his own last season. Craziest part about his rise is how unfazed he is and always seems so calm and collected as if he's already a star for years. Stable stroke and reliable in crunch time. Is some sort of a combo guard like how Brandon Roy was for the same team.

**7) J.J. Redick:** Klay-lite or elder-Klay. Is essentially Klay Thompson limited to just running off screens for catch and shoot 3s. Solid defensively. Is the ultimate complimentary piece to the 'Big 3' in LA. Does his role almost to perfection. Very smart at finding angles for separation and a sweet stroke to boot. Crazy efficient at 16 PPG on 48% 3PT FG.

**8) Khris Middleton:** Possibly the most underrated on this list. Low-key the most consistently good player on the underwhelming Bucks (won't say he's the best because of Giannis' out-of-nowhere explosion by season end). 3&amp;D wing. Gives you 20 points if you need him to. Has the size advantage at 6 foot 8.

**9) J.R. Smith:** Big-time in the Finals. Known to be a rapid-fire 3-point chucker, but when tamed in an environment with stars around him, came into his own as a 'pick your poison' weapon. Sweet shooting stroke allows him to get a solid shot off off-balanced when his team needs it. Turns up his defense when called upon. Willing sacrifice of his ego en route to a long-awaited ring.

**10) Avery Bradley:** All-Defense level defense. Hounds the on-ball player like no other. Improved his 3-point shooting to become a respectable 3&amp;D threat. Absence in the playoffs obviously cost Boston a well-matched series. Still, an undersized player at SG.

**Honorable mentions:**

**Brandon Knight &amp; Victor Oladipo:** One played at an All-Star level pre-early-injury and the other may finally break out in the OKC-Harden role on a contender.

I just entered my adulthood and am currently not working because I'm halfway through my studies. My family is poor. I started betting soccer since EUROs started, first time in my life. Instead of treating it as a leisure, I thought that I could legit earn some money from it. I started off with $100 and it turned into $190 in a matter of a few games. I felt good about this. So I started putting up bigger bets, from just $10 per match to about $60. I was gradually losing my $$, but I kept thinking that I would make a comeback. With the last $36, I threw it all on an Argentina win, but as you all know, they drew. I lost my $100. But I really needed to get it back. So I inserted another $100 into my account and betted on Italy and England's matches yesterday. I lost $40 out of that.

I know some of you all are laughing at me for worrying about $100, but I am not working, am relying on a single mother. Whenever she returns home, she would brag about how she walked all the way to a food store further down the road to get a discount of $1-$2 off the same food and it hurts me that she looks so happy bragging about it, because at the back of my mind, I know that lost $140 of techincally, my family's money.

I am feeling guilty and depressed. But I cannot just stop it all like that and surrender to the $140 loss. I need to gain it back.

Can anybody give some suggestions as to what's the right way to bet safely or how I should go about doing this betting-wise? Thanks in advance.

**EDIT:** It's true that I am irresponsible, but I do have an income of my own towards tens of thousands of dollars from tons of part-time jobs I did before. It's just that I didn't take one up this year, but every other holidays, I would have a job.

But I still feel guilty mainly because my family is cultured to think that the whole family has a 'total income pool'. My money is my mother's and vice versa. So I treat it as I don't have income at all because what I've worked for previously is thought to be my 'mother's'. Though at the end of the day, we are still poor.

I would definitely stop betting after EUROs. It's just a one-time thing since the idea of betting coincidentally coincides with EUROs happening so I wanted to give it a try and earn some bucks from that.

I just want to learn some suggestions, specifically, what's the right way of betting. Is it to put a large bet on a 'almost certain' win with the lowest odds? Or is it to spread the bets equally around? I heard over/under total goals gives you the highest chance of winning? How bout the specific scores? Should you put a small amount on the one you guess to be right, or spread some money across numerous scorelines? Something like that.

Again, I'm definitely stopping right after EUROs. I just wanna gain some advice over the last few matches that may help me when the quarter-finals start.",SoccerBetting,I need help..,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoccerBetting/comments/4q7kuc/i_need_help/

Not because I don't think he's good, but I know nothing about this guy. No hype, never seen his name before etc. Just absolutely baffled. But hey, after a few hours, I've thought it through and tonight was actually pretty solid.

So, we've got Papa. Watching his mixtapes, I can see that he has size, though a little disproportionate but that can be rectified via weight training. He has okay fundamentals, but he's young. If you think about it, dude is essentially a young Kosta Koufos. Koufos didn't play major minutes for us last year, but we all know that he's a worthy back-up C in this league. Papa can come in, play a few minutes here and there and develop big-time in the SAC practice gym as a stash. He can be our long-term 3rd string Center till he's ready and we can then trade Kosta and Eric Moreland. It also serves as a contingency plan if Boogie leaves somehow. By that time, he would be in his 3rd year and ready to step-in.

TL;DR He's a young Kosta with talent, if we don't mind keeping Kosta, I don't see why we should mind having a Kosta with room to grow.

We move on to Skal. We have always said that we need a stretch 4. Vlade identified the stretch 4 here rather well. Sure, he's not ready yet, he still needs more years, bla bla, but the thing about stretch 4 is that there won't be as much contact when playing compared to true bigs and shooting isn't a 'contact-driven' mechanic, so it is gonna translate to the NBA immediately. We just have to use him the right way. He's a Kentucky guy and so was Cousins and Willie. And we can now relax our pursuit for a stretch 4 and not overpay someone like Ryan Anderson. Skal is a steal at 28th. He could have very much be gone at 14th (I think he's better than Thon Maker from what I've seen since HS. This guy pwned Thon Maker at the Summit, and he's deemed weak). So if you switch around Papa's draft position with Skal's, we essentially got them at their right spots. It's alright.

Now, we also got ourselves 2 SGs that we've always wanted in Malachi and Isaiah. Tbh, Malachi wasn't on my radar at all. I thought it would be Timothe, Malik or Furkan, but I ain't into either of them either. After Murray went off, I ain't high on any other SGs because they all don't seem like they can stay in the league for long, so I'm okay with Malachi. Am quite neutral about Isaiah Cousins too. But people seem to think that he should have been gone before 59th so that's good. Having 2 Cousins jerseys on this team would be dope tho, not sure what Boogie thinks about that. Lols.

Most importantly, I want to hail VLADE for making the trade for our 8th pick happen. Regardless of who the picks end up becoming, I think that is a very underrated trade, fueled by the fact that I think Marquess Chriss is gonna be a bust at 8th. I was seriously pretty sad when Murray went off the board, but I think Bogdan + 2 other picks for 8th is pretty awesome. I also think Bogdan will be a better player than Marquess (ain't expecting an All-Star or what not, but Marquess will go down the road of Noah Vonleh in my books) and adding 2 other picks onto that is just great.

Wouldn't Joerger have a say in these picks? If he's discussed it with Vlade and Peja, I would trust him. Dude is the guy who wanted Rodney Hood ahead of Jordan Adams in Memphis but got shunted. He should know what he's doing.

All in all, satisfied with how this turned out. From Belinelli for 22nd, to picking Joerger (easily the best pick among all HC available at that point), to swapping the 8th (potential bust) pick for a proven European stud, another SG, a stretch 4 and a Kosta-lite. I'm satisfied with Vlade's ideas.

Our roster looks somewhat like this:

PG - Seth (possibly Rondo and Collison)

SG - B-Mac, Malachi, Isaiah (and Bogdan next year)

SF - Rudy, Casspi, Caron Butler

PF - Acy, Skal

C - Boogie, WCS, Papa and Kosta (who I think will be traded)

We've got pieces for trade. And we can get someone like Kent Bazemore in FA.",kings,Calm after the storm.,https://www.reddit.com/r/kings/comments/4plqn0/calm_after_the_storm/

It hurts man. I'm not an OKC fan by all means, but they are my team this playoffs. I thought they could win it all. That, compounded with the fact that I hate GSW to the core (specifically Draymond and I'm an underdog guy), makes it so painful that they just threw the series like that. I do think that KD and Westbrook had it in their hands. They were in control. Win or lose, it's all up to them, not GSW. And Game 6 specifically so. KD lost that game single-handedly. He rushed every shot and made them all bad ones. Something got to him and he just became nervous all of a sudden when they were 1 win away from the Finals with their home fans cheering.

59,2016-05-25 09:53:29+00:00,self.nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4kyvxu/hindsight_the_league_is_not_taken_over_by/,False,"Hear me out, guys. So, small-ball indeed won GSW a ring last year. But that isn't the main reason why they did it. Small-ball did indeed win 73 games in the regular season and got it's team the prestige of being the best in NBA regular season history. But it isn't all that.

For summary, **small-ball allows a team to use quick player and ball movements to shake up the bigs of the opponent team**. A team of great shooters (including PF), off-screen-moving players and multiple playmakers are necessary. Their 3-point output against the bigs negates any offensive advantage the bigs have in return. A 2-point hook shot inside is countered by not being able to catch-up on significantly faster PFs around the 3-point line, resulting in 3 points being given away. A miss on the offensive end allows the quicker PF to rebound and immediately go on fast break such that the big men would be too slow to stop them.

But the key ingredient to this recipe is having some of the greatest shooters in the game. At the end of the day, their bread and butter is what it is, **the most volatile mechanic in the game**, that's shooting. **Shooting requires one to constantly run a hell lot around at full speed to get wide open looks and then set into their shooting motion under tip-top conditions in their legs and arms to get up a good shot.** Many factors can alter it's effectiveness. Good defense makes a shooter shoot off balanced, physicality takes it's toll when running around screens and all the bruises will significantly affect the final product that's the shot.

What we've seen from GSW is that end effect of being consistently tired out through continuously intense basketball. **They can cruise through regular season easily because it's a rarity that they face a team that's capable of competing with their 'flawless' system.** Every 10 games against lower tier teams would have them face 1 great team on the schedule, in which it's followed by another 10 mediocre teams to another great team so on so forth. Curry gets to sit out 4th quarters against lower tier teams and gets to be in his best condition against great teams. That's how he played out-of-this-world and pushed his team to a record in the regular season.

Now, the physicality of the playoffs is taking it's toll on Curry (and the other shooters of the GSW). Injury causes him to not be in his tip-top shooting condition and that is capped off by having to face the 2nd best PG in the league, a physical specimen who's arguably the most physically imposing PG in NBA history. **All the constant tough defense on a finesse player like Curry takes his game off him.** And having to defend Westbrook ain't helping either.

So how do you explain their championship winning run last year then, some may ask. Well, this is where the hindsight comes in. As many may remember, **'excuses' were given out that Curry and the Warriors faced a series of injury-riddled teams on their way to the championship**. As they go on a 73-9 spree, that 'excuse' died down because everyone thinks that GSW and small-ball are legit and the true deal. But is that really an excuse?

Curry faced an unhealthy Holiday (Norris Cole, if you may), Nick 'out of the league' Calathes, Jason 'old man' Terry and Matthew Dellevadova throughout last year. Dellevadova was actually effective enough to stop Curry from winning a Finals MVP. This post-season, he has escaped the hounding defense of Patrick Beverley (arguable since his physicality may have been the reason that Curry got injured) and has since faced Damian Lillard and Russell Westbrook. That's 3 very physical players put on Curry, whether it's offensively or defensively. **That's a big difference from last year for a finesse player and you can see the effects this series.**

It ain't helping either that his current opponent is possibly his **kryptonite**. Westbrook is the ultimate physical player to Curry's ultimate finesse and skills.

Finally, **the teams that have made it this far are showing that traditional line-ups are here to stay.** Biyombo has been balling. Valanciunas was arguably the best player of his team before his injury and got his team through 2 series of terrible performances from Lowry and DeRozan. Steven Adams and Enes Kanter had formed a potent combi that destroyed the fundamentals of SAS. And OKC continue to crash the boards and punish GSW for putting up small-ball this series. Granted, a fast big man like Steven Adams or Biyombo might be key, but in the end, they are true bigs and have proved that small-ball may just not be all that.

* Warriors will be a 65-67 win team.
* Durant will stay in OKC.
* Heat and Celtics switch places depending on who gets the bigger FA signings.
* Blazers and Hornets get big pieces.
* Mavs will try to build around Dirk again, but fall short of playoffs.
* Hawks lose Horford and Teague. Korver past his prime.
* Dwight leaves Rockets.
* Bledsoe and Knight return healthy for Suns.
* Pelicans with healthy AD, Pondexter and Asik.
* Pacers lose Solomon Hill.
* Conley leaves Grizzlies, Knicks fail to bring in huge FA.
* Lakers, Sixers and Nuggets on the rebuild. Still too young.

Strengths:

* Gives his heart to his players and given time, he'd do anything for them. Shown the emotions and the heart like any good coach should. Face looked like the airhead logo during the Spurs series and he had to be held back frequent times during the regular season because of shitty calls. ex, Matt Barnes vs the Bucks/John Henson.

* His X's and O's are great. AMAZING at drawing up plays in timeouts.

* Has a desire to play faster ball, but the vets didn't buy in. Rondo and Boogie are more suited for what he really wants to do on offense than Conley and Gasol were.

* Signs of having an eye for talent trying to push for Rodney Hood over Jordan Adams in 14' which the front office was defiant over. Now, it's clear who's the better player.


Weaknesses:

* Pretty stubborn with his coaching decisions and will still often play starters for 30+ mins in a 50 point blowout.

* Not a huge media guy, so don't expect pressers longer than 2 minutes, and he never speaks out for any reason.

* Youngest old-school coach in the league.

* Inflexible rotations + doesn't like to play young guys.

* Couldn't get Marc, Conley and Z-Bo to buy into his system consistently

* Complained about the FO through the media too much.

The Kings have a 72.4% (courtesy of Wiki) chance of getting the 8th pick, so Imma go from there.

**1st - Philly select BRANDON INGRAM.** (I hate to see Simmons go to the Lakers, but the fact that Philly is OVERLOADED with talented bigs makes it likely that they would go for Ingram, who is a much better outside shooter and I see Simmons playing PF to start his NBA career because of his lack of shots.)

**2nd - Lakers select BEN SIMMONS** (No brainer here.)

**3rd - Celtics (via Nets pick) select DRAGAN BENDER** (The Celtics are in the playoffs and have legit fight in the well-balanced Eastern Conference. With Sullinger-Amir as their bigs duo, I see them picking Bender for more inside talent to stash for the future. He would be a good bait in case of a trade for a superstar too.)

**4th - Phoenix Suns select JAYLEN BROWN** (Hield is a very tempting prospect here on out. But with Bledsoe and Booker on board, there's no way they'd draft a SG. PJ Tucker is solid, but getting old so they need future at the SF spot with Len developing inside.)

**5th - Wolves select KRIS DUNN** (Rubio's lack of scoring is hindering this talented squad long-term. With Lavine at SG, their weakest spot lies at PG. Could change if the coach sees Lavine as more of a Harden-esque 6th man tho.)

**6th - Pelicans select BUDDY HIELD** (A best talent available pick. Eric Gordon is not their SG moving forward, so it's likely they'd draft a SG and trade Gordon away. There's a chance that they draft for needs and Poeltl goes off the boards instead since Asik&amp;Perkins..)

**7th - Nuggets (via Knicks pick) select JAMAAL MURRAY** (Another BTA pick. Gary Harris is developing slowly and with Nurkic&amp;Jokic inside, they wouldn't want another big.)

I'm not sure who the Kings should pick with HIELD and MURRAY (hopefully not) off the boards. I'm thinking TIMOTHE LUWAWU or DENZEL VALENTINE for needs. What do you guys think?

**EDIT:** I FORGOT ABOUT **THON MAKER**! The Suns might draft MAKER since they are building for the future and their PF is currently Jon Leuer. Then, JAYLEN BROWN will drop to the Pelicans since their SF spot is just as weak as their Cs with Pondexter injury-riddled and Alonzo Gee starting. HIELD or MURRAY for us is a possibility now! :D

On a serious note, I'm glad he at least shows us his worth during these garbage games so that Vlade and the Kings would see the light and put in a greater effort in keeping him.

I'm torn between JAMAL MURRAY and BUDDY HIELD. Our obvious need right now is a SG, so we'll probs end up with either one. 

I see alot of Mock Drafts with MURRAY at 7th. If I'm going with MURRAY, it's because he's a combo guard that has a Curry-esque shooting stroke (doesn't mean shit tho). So if Rondo doesn't resign, we can play him at PG too. But his lack of athleticism is a concern. 

For HIELD, it's because he's an established scorer who has the potential to play D with that wingspan. Has a great work ethic to boot, BUT, he's already 3 years older and is not a natural leader like MURRAY.

Still, Imma go with HIELD, cause I'm skeptical about a lack of athleticism and we need defense too.",kings,Who should the Kings pick in the draft?,https://www.reddit.com/r/kings/comments/4bkntm/who_should_the_kings_pick_in_the_draft/

Cousins was lit going 21-30 for 56 points. The team was on a 5-game winning streak having a chance to make it 6 and were on course to solidify the 8th-seed berth. That Troy Daniels travelled 3 lost us the game and we went on a downward spiral with a tired-loss to the Blazers the next day.

Right after that loss, more so than the loss itself, I was worried that the team would be heavily affected by it. Being a basketball player myself, I take every loss to heart, whether it's a blowout or not. But to lose so unluckily, it must have hurt incredibly bad. And now that the Kings are 10th seed with Portland and Jazz running away win after win, it's even HEAVIER than I thought it would be.
