4,"So what I'm understanding is that, in an ideal world, if things had happened differently, what you've done might have been alright. Regrets, regrets.

&gt; And fuck no i won't apologize to you.

Not to me, or to anyone in specific, but just in general. You're not sorry for what you did wrong, so why should anyone excuse you of it? If you genuinely don't care what I or anyone thinks, then that's fine, but then why are you here having this conversation?

&gt; i'm just here to try and figure out how to keep my dick pics off the office email chain.

You can try to do that without trying to justify your actions to strangers, so clearly it's something more than that.",2015-08-28 00:27:55+00:00,cui3wz8,14,t1_cui3o45,469,ashleymadisonhack
5,"&gt; Right, because you know my wife, and who she is, and how we communicate, and the ways in which we discuss intimacy. Therefore, you are qualified to judge.

That's fair. So you tell me, then: would your wife be unhurt if she knew and understood what you did?

&gt; TIL that a healthy sex drive is juvenile and shameful.

Actually going insane without sex, though perhaps not juvenile (I used the wrong word), is very, very concerning. Do you have a mental condition that makes sex an absolutely requirement for your sanity? Because lots of people survive and live perfectly sane lives without sex, whether by choice or circumstance.

&gt; I'm not apologizing for anything that I did.

That's unfortunate. Because if you did apologize, that would at least show some signs of growth, and I think virtually everyone would be willing to forgive you. But if you don't acknowledge your wrongdoings and apologize for them, I don't think anyone should ever forgive you for them. ",2015-08-27 22:50:12+00:00,cui0pw5,12,t1_cui0i6i,367,ashleymadisonhack
6,"&gt; First off, comparing me to a rapist or murderer says a whole lot about you, not me.

I didn't say adultery is on the same level of transgressions as murder or rape. Rather, I was using the example to illustrate why your reasoning is fallacious.

&gt; I wonder how honestly you have discussed your father's long term lonliness with him. Not that it's any of my business of course. I'm sure that he's never done anything untoward on the internet out of sheer desperation.

And you can speculate about that if you like, but he wasn't on the leaked Ashley Madison list, so...

&gt; Fair enough for you. Yes, we did discuss it, and I promised to NEVER put her in some shitty home. She told me that she never wants to know about it if I ever do anything. Maybe that's too nuanced for you, but that's where we left it. 

That's still quite a ways away from, ""I approve of you having sex with other people."" But, if it makes you feel better, sure, I suppose it's something.

&gt; So I did what I needed to do to stay sane.

This just doesn't paint a very flattering picture of you as a human being, which I think is the point that threads like this are trying to make. You would literally go insane without sex? I'm sure that's hyperbole, but still, do you have any idea how juvenile that comes across?

&gt; But here's the important part: IT'S NONE OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS. That seems to be the issue that you don't understand. This has nothing at all to do with you, but you feel compelled to publicly shame someone who you have never met.

What does that even mean? Am I not allowed to judge you for your transgressions, simply because they weren't transgressions against me? No, obviously that's not the case. You're on a public forum trying to defend yourself, and I'm on that same public forum, telling you why your defense is lousy.

7,"&gt; So, then, you have no idea. You are like a child trying to talk to adults about something they have never experienced.

""Shit. She didn't buy my bullshit justification. Ok, just discredit her because she's never done the same shitty thing I have, then."" Being in a position doesn't make you the moral arbiter for that position. I can tell you that murderers and rapists are shitty people without ever having murdered or raped someone.

&gt; How many people do you know, personally, who have been a primary caregiver to a spouse, for over 10 years?

My father is actually my mother's primary caregiver, so I'm afraid you picked the wrong person to try to discredit (fallaciously) with a lack of experience.

&gt; Here's another question, let's say that you were grievously injured. To the point that you needed constant care with feeding, toileting, cleaning, etc. Sex is over. Have you discussed this possibility with your spouse?

I have, actually, with every long-term partner I've ever had. And my position has always been that, if I ever become such a burden that my partner would need to cheat on me to maintain their sanity, they should just put me in a home. Maybe you and your wife both disagree, but if that were the case and you were honest and open about it, you wouldn't be here trying to defend yourself now.",2015-08-27 21:54:58+00:00,cuhyrtg,8,t1_cuhycvq,661,ashleymadisonhack

10,"Statistically speaking, you're extremely unlikely to have ever used AM to have an affair with 1 woman, let alone 10. What's more likely the case, based on how you boast about your sexual and professional prowess over an anonymous forum, is that you signed up, had no affairs (or maybe one, if you were one of the extremely, extremely lucky ones), and are very butthurt that you could now potentially be found out, like everyone overreacting here and getting downvoted is.

But it's alright, you don't have to be upset about the possibility of being found out, because no one cares. No one cares about you. No one cares about how successful or unsuccessful you are. No one cares about how many women (married or otherwise) you've bedded. And most importantly, the universe doesn't care if you're a shitty person. The only person in the world that might care is your spouse, and if they're willing to put up with you, that's entirely up to them.",2015-08-27 09:35:36+00:00,cuhabri,4,t1_cugvbha,36054,ashleymadisonhack
