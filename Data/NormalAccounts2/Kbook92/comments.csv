0,Yes. I get down thinking about plans I had even just for this summer. July is almost over and I've done nothing except try and manage my depression. ,2015-07-20 21:36:13+00:00,cta64fd,1,t3_3dyksc,19271,depression
1,"Thanks. My cat is pretty in-tune with my anxiety and depression. He's been snuggling with me a lot more than usual. (Not that I think he knows I need it but I think he worries about me and wants to stay close? I don't know. Animals know things. It's weird.) It's not the same snuggling with a cat, but it doesn't hurt either.  ",2015-07-20 04:10:32+00:00,ct9cyp2,2,t1_ct9cemk,1166,Anxiety

11,"You are right that some things work better for different people. I do everything I can to create positive habits. I exercise, I go to therapy, I practice mindfulness, Progressive muscle relaxation, Medication, everything you could possibly think of. And I don't give up on the easily. I will give anything that could help a solid chance. Meditation does not help me. I've practice even when I am doing well. If i attempt when I'm down... Well, like a lot of people here I also deal with anxiety.

16,"There was a post earlier asking for people's best metaphors for depression. I'm going to copy/paste what I wrote below, but maybe you should look at that post.

I feel like my experience with depression is like walking through a field with holes everywhere. I have to step around them. Sometimes there's more room between each hole and sometimes they are very close together. Some of them are deeper than others. For the most part i can navigate through them well, but if it starts to rain, or it gets dark outside, its harder to see where I'm going.

Sometimes when i fall its slow and i don't realize it. Other times I am in complete panic and try to grab hold of anything i can on the way down.

Once I'm down there I sometimes scream for someone to pull me out, even though i know they can't reach me.

It's so dark that I will cling to any light I can find, even though it doesn't help me to get out. Because the darkness I'm trapped in is so scary.

I'll look up to the light above me and start trying to climb out. The first attempt I climb up a few feet, then fall and hurt my foot. The second attempt I make it a little bit higher but i fall and hurt myself again. The third I don't even hardly make it off the ground and fall again. I beat myself up trying to climb out and fall until my hands are sore from trying to hold on.

I stop looking up to the light. I stop trying. I stop screaming for help. It feels like no matter what I do, I won't make it out. So i just sit down in the dirt and mud, and I start letting that darkness take me.

25,It's more than that. When I'm with people I put up a front. I try to focus on whats going on but I end up withdrawing once I start getting lost in my own thoughts. People want me to talk to them about it which makes it worse. They mean well but it just pushes me further back into the thoughts when I'm trying so hard to keep it together because I'm around people. When I'm alone I'm more relaxed. If i need to cry I can just cry. If I need to stop what I'm doing and move onto something else i can. There's too much stress to preform around people so they don't try to fix me.,2015-06-29 20:16:55+00:00,csmrbfp,2,t1_csmqxfe,602,depression

27,I kind of understand this. All last week I was feeling like none of this was real. Like tomorrow I'd wake up and be happy again and everything would be like it was. I was so sad I went numb. It was easier to get through the days feeling like a shell but now the sadness is back. Knowing I won't wake up and everything will be ok is so hard. Keep telling yourself it will eventually be ok. I'm doing that. It's really hard to believe it most of the time but you still have to tell yourself that. ,2015-06-28 18:46:40+00:00,csllz3o,1,t3_3bf0te,5927,depression
