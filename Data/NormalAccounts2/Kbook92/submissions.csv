I'm a 22 year old female that gets along better with guys. For the longest time I didn't want to hangout with a lot of guys. I felt like it would make me look bad, but I was always closer with my guy friends. My absolute best friend is a bisexual guy which made the friendship easier.

The past two years or so I decided I didn't care and started hanging out more one on one with guy friends. I have more in common with them. I like camping, hiking, kayaking, cars. Yes i have some female friends into that stuff but not many. Most girls annoy me and all they ever want to do is shop or eat out, go clubbing. They turn there nose up to anything actually fun like a comedy club or camp ground.

It just sucks that I never know what guys intentions are.
Sex? Friendship? Relationship?

I went camping two weeks ago with a friend. He has a girlfriend. She didn't want to go camping (shocker). I thought it was a safe assumption that we mutually wanted friendship. Nope. He tried to have sex with me.

I have another friend that I feel like I have to avoid because I know he likes me. I never know if he's being friendly because he's trying to get somewhere or if he's just being a good friend.

If i assume a guy is interested, I'm being an egotistical bitch. If I assume they are not I end up in surprise awkward situations or get accused of leading them on.

And then it seems like the guy I am actually interested in just want to be friends, which is fine but I'm to that point where I don't bother to see if they are interested if they don't make the first move because I'm so frustrated.

Why can't people, including myself just be up front about this stuff. I tell you what I want and you tell me what you want and we will make sure we are on the same page.

Why is that such a difficult thing so our culture to do? UGH!",rant,Being friends with opposite sex.,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/3icu66/being_friends_with_opposite_sex/

Once for cutting when I was younger, once for suicidal thoughts, and the last time because of an attempt. 

Less than five minutes with the psychologist each day. 
Nothing to stay busy but not moving means you're still depressed. 
BS advice like eat healthy (meanwhile the food is barely edible), exercise (umm, kay), socialize..
There are a lot of patients that are unsettling. I've seen a guy jerking it in the hall, a woman thought she was a nurse and kept waking everyone up through the night to check on them, and a guy jumped into my bed and grabbed me one morning while I was sleeping. That same guy had a nurse by the neck the night before. 
Phones that didn't work. 
Roommates that snored LOUDLY when I was already having trouble sleeping. 
Away from people that care about you. 
It goes on and on and on..

BUT I went to the crisis center last week and am currently in a partial program. I never thought I'd like group therapy or they would I've the same bs talk like I've heard a million times, but it's actually pretty nice. It flies by each day even though it's emotionally draining. And they actually seem like they know what they are doing there. Therapists and doctors really work together. It's more than just talking about feelings.

Relationships can get messy because of that. The moment I feel insecure I start pushing everyone away. I recently did this with my boyfriend. We broke up and then obviously there were more feelings of not being wanted which worsened the depression. Now I'm overwhelmed with hopeless feelings about way more than the relationship. My ex-boyfriend didn't really talk to me for a few weeks which is understandable considering the state I was in and that I had dumped him. I kept thinking he was concerned about me and didn't want to talk because he thought it would stop me from getting better. He was the only person I let myself believe cared. He let me go to his house the other night. He specifically said it didn't mean he wanted to get back together or be with me, which I was ok with. I just wanted to be around someone who cared and I felt like I would feel better if someone would just hold me/sit close/pat my back/whatever because I don't really have a lot of that with my family/friends and with isolating myself I felt so lonely. When I got there I felt a lot better at first. He didn't seem to care much though, just let me lay close to him but didn't really do anything to try and comfort me. I still thought he just had some resentment for the breakup. I haven't been able to grieve the relationship yet so I still have all the feelings I had for him before. I wanted to kiss him and scratch his head and things but didn't because I know he has grieve it a little. He started pulling me in closer but I wasn't because he warmed up to me a wanted to comfort me. He was turned on from the contact with me. He kissed me and I pulled away knowing he wasn't kissing me for the reasons I wanted, but I wanted to kiss him back. I wasn't able to keep from kissing him for long. He started grabbing my butt and kissing my neck when I tried to pull away. He was doing everything he could to keep me from stopping him pretty much until I told him to stop and started crying. (He had said, ""Kiss me like you mean it,"" to which I responded, ""I can't because you don't mean it."") I left pretty soon after that and today he blocked me so I couldn't talk to him anymore. 

He was the only person I really felt like I could go to, and he tried to take advantage of me. If I would have had sex with him and he kept talking to me because of that, I don't know if I'd feel better or worse right now.

He was the one that suggested I try posting and reading things on reddit. I’m realizing now it was more so I wouldn’t talk to him.  When I first tried I just felt more alone. Reading just forced me to focus on the bad I’m experiencing and when I posted or commented no one really responded so it defiantly made the loneliness worse. 

Another friend of mine was upset with me that I wouldn’t talk to her about what I was going through. I took the time to explain a lot to her, not to help me, but to make her feel better. After everything I told her she didn’t have anything to say. I tried to tell her I need a distraction from my thoughts not someone to talk to about them and I needed to worry about my own feelings rather than not hurting hers because she can’t help. She hasn’t talked to me much since then.

It’s really hard to break the isolation behaviors already, but when I try these are the types of responses I get from people. Now that I can’t talk to my ex I’m coming back to reddit as a last resort to get rid of the loneliness. I’m not sure how I feel about even posting about my feelings but I can’t find the courage to be around people and I don’t know how to take steps to get back to that point.
