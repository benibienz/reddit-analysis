1. Rasta Wyatt is the weirdest Wyatt.

2. Rhyno is 2 legit to quit. Who bleeds off a tag? Rhyno.

3. I understand people like Becky but they build her like a dope. How many times you going to get the wool pulled over your eyes?

4. RIP Vaudevillains. You will be missed.

5. I have exactly 0 cares for anything with Dean Ambrose. He's been on auto pilot since Mania.

6. Miz is the best in the business at heel heat. Cuts a legit shoot promos and makes it interesting.

7. I know Dolph is a great actual wrestler but how many times you lose feuds before you realize you're neck deep in dirt? I just don't care anymore, man. Give me a reason to care.

8. I wish they had Eva Marie back for all her nonsense. They need that heat in the women's division.",2016-08-31 06:34:52+00:00,d73p76x,1.0,t3_50exmp,14785.0,SquaredCircle

Those are all things Americans want but Euros don't have in their system. So before you go spouting this nonsense know that it costs money. UK spends about $3200 per patient compared to US at $~9600.

Not all the beliefs I have you will agree with or vice versa. But there is a separation in my mind between personal (religious) beliefs and the rights of a person from the state. Gays are entitled to every right I am. There is nothing I believe I am entitled to that they should not be.

But from a personal moral and religious sense, homosexuality is an abomination to God. There is no getting around it. But that's for God to deal with. Not for me to judge. Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.

519,"Getting your Masters in D.C. has its perks. For instance, I sat through a lecture recently on campus from the Head of the European Parliament Liaison Office- basically this guy is elected by the EU to lobby on their behalf to Congress.

He made some pretty snide and smarmy remarks about Trump and I had to ask him a question as he went on about the EU's benefit to the UK. I asked him this question:

""Based upon the data, the UK citizens either do not understand the benefits you claim and/or you're failing to communicate them effectively. Has this been framed how this will impact the everyday citizen's life because I understand the macro platitudes you claim, but I doubt John Smith from Birmingham does.""

Basically, if this is so important to the UK's future...how come nobody there understands its benefits.

When asked in the context of the consequences of Brexit on local economy...he pretty much stated ""We don't know"" and then alluded to difficulties.

It's important to remember that even with the vote, the UK has two years before they officially leave because they have to negotiate its release from each member state of the EU and establish additional trade agreements. It's not one huge break and cya later. It's rather complicated. Cameron has stated he will support whatever decision is made, but I think I would not expect him to continue longer than whatever term he currently has as PM (I think through 2019).",2016-06-06 08:16:40+00:00,d3xu49p,1.0,t3_4mrsbs,3177.0,The_Donald

1. Oil prices dropped. 
2. Natural Gas production has slowed and not paced to keep up with oil vacuum.
3. Taxes were too low from the get go.

* John Bel Edwards (no relation to infamous Edwards) was recently elected due to Republican fatigue and a terribly run campaign by David Vitter. Historically bad. Just punchless. Edwards is now screwing the state with increased taxes. He'll last one term.

I'm sure WWE runs metrics on Wrestler Value and how its tied to the product. What is their value to the brand? Rybacks I bet is less than 500K.

1026,"Here are my thoughts. Ignore them if you want but it's my swan song to wrestling after 3 years of fandom. 

I'm 30. I got into this entertainment/show/business late in life and I'm leaving earlier than I expected.

* The Women's Championship will continue to be a disaster unless they start booking them like competent singles wrestlers. There needs to be a run of clean wins and no interference. 

* Good job Zach Ryder. You paid your dues, but it was Sami Zayn's time. His match at Takeover earned him the change and would have continued a feud everyone wants to see: Primetime Owens vs. Zayn. 

Instead, we get you with no real nemesis besides WWE Booking.

* Jericho vs. Styles was the sloppiest match of the night. Too many botches for that level of wrestling talent.

* Baron Corbin. I don't even have an opinion on this. They needed another big guy to throw Kane out and you were available. Take your pushes where you find them I guess.

* Wyatt Fam, Fam it's over. Just go shave the heads and beards and call it a day. It was fun, frustrating and head scratching but you're going nowhere. Fast track Harper and Rowan into a Tag Team. Wyatt, go enjoy muddling around the IC Title for the next 5 years.

* John Cena. I don't even hate you. I'm just confused at your role for storylines going forward. You done it and won everything. Keep granting those wishes.

* Seth Rollins is the champ we deserve. Too bad he's hurt. Roman Reigns is a terrible. Whatever. 

* Dolph Ziggler. You belong to the 90s. Find a time machine. You deserve it.

* Thanks Taker but it's over. You're turning into an IRL caricature of the movie The Wrestler but with more sustained popularity. 

* Shane, don't know about you but that's an insane jump for a storyline to nowhere. Reading the script, there's no way I'd have agreed to that. 

* Brock Lesnar is giving the audience only X amount and you better not ask for more than X because it will always be the same performance. Every time. 

* Dean Ambrose, you deserve better.

In early 2010, Arpaio and Thomas sought to have a grand jury indict a number of Maricopa County Judges, Maricopa County Supervisors, and employees of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors. The grand jury, in an unusual rebuke, ordered the investigation ended. This action has been described as meaning that ""...the case is so bad, there's no further evidence that could be brought [to substantiate it]"". Legal experts agree this is a rare move.[99]

Arpaio and Thomas lost every case, either by ruling of the courts, or by dropping the case.[100]",2016-03-19 05:57:38+00:00,d15g4pk,6.0,t1_d15fxa2,639.0,The_Donald
