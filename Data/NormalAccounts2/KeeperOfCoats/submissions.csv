Don't lose faith. MAGA.

I will also say this, people are more likely to vote for you if they meet you. If you are accessible (somewhat) by at least making public appearances. Going to the folks.

It's a proven fact, people will overlook differences if they meet/know/etc. the candidates. Some people will vote for you just by visiting their town.

I find this confusing. You hangout with him, then run him into the ground a bit.

30 minutes of his hour was spent bashing and making fun of Trump. It was interesting hearing his perspective on the first interview after Don announced. The lack of a specifics he seemed unsettled about. 

* Holy shit. My eyes have opened to the realization of what the Republican Party looks like. The crowd was about what you expect. Every stereotypical Fox News viewer showed up. White, old and idiotic (laughing and parroting with every undank phase every cucked about on the channel). 

No offense to our party, but outside of Trump, there's not much to get excited about. 

These people reminded me of those weird in-laws your single mom left you with for the summer while she went out to pursue her dreams as fashion designer in the big city.

* No big reveals. No insider information. Miller was funny at times, but I'm reminded how old he is when I don't get half his references. I'm 30, intune with pop culture and current events, Masters, etc. And I damn sure knew those bunch of hicks didn't either but they were laughing out of nervousness. 

* It was low rent entertainment for $6. 

Those bunch of pleebs paid full price of $75-150. Being the nimble financial navigator I am, I paid $6 total. Well, $12 for me and the GF.

Also, I was the only one I could see wearing Trump gear. About a 1/4 of the crowd cheered the first time they mentioned Trumps name.
