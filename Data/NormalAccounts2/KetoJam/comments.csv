Oh man, I totally get this. Such a rough head space to be in, I am sorry you are feeling this way.  

In the beginning, if I was feeling cagey and couldn;t get to a meeting, I would read stuff on recovery here on SD, or in books, or I would call someone I knew from IRL sobriety.  And sometimes I just put myself to bed early. Or I would go take off all my makeup and get in my pajamas and just force myself to wait until the next day.  It was a lot of jedi mind tricking in the beginning. And it got so much easier over time.  ",2016-09-22 01:14:44+00:00,d7wvbru,1.0,t3_53v3tb,18781.0,stopdrinking

My child is young, but I was drunk for more of his life than not.  I know that guilt.  I relate, and I feel your pain.

I absolutely tried but could not do it alone.  I kept failing.  Things didn't turn around for me until I got professional help, and later, group support.

189,"&gt;Is it possible to rebuild one's self into an almost normal person AND stop beating myself up about past fuckups?

This is a question I ask myself still to this day.  Yesterday, for whatever reason, I wallowed in a good deal of self-pity over all my drunk transgressions and the messes I made.  The thing is, though, is IS possible for me to be happy and I genrally am.  Most of the time, I don't dwell on my old issues and the problems I caused.  But some days, I hate myself, and I get bogged down by it.  

I got a lot of help for this stuff in therapy and through a support group. Working a specific plan with an advisor to learn to practice gratitude and to develop some perspective, and working every day to live a better life and provide service and kindness to others - this is what I do now.

There are tactile, tangible things sobriety allows me to do: I get to wake up earlier, move easier, handle more, and because of all of that, I perform better as a mom, employee, partner, friend, exerciser, jewelry maker, etc., etc., etc.

But then there's the bigger, internal piece to it.  Sobriety allows me to be at peace and to be grateful and to have perspective.  And all of those things allow me to accept life as it is, and me for who I am, and others for who they are.  Sobriety allows me to smile and take a few deep breaths when I instead want to rage the fuck out and act the fool.

256,"It's up to you. I think it's cool that you came here to talk it out, good on you.

I would reset now, but looking back, I would not have reset all the way back then. Part of the reason is BC I quit drinking, and weed isn't alcohol. But it's more than that. I guarantee you that if I smoked at 3 weeks, and reset, I would have ALSO went ahead and gone on a bender. I mean, why not, right? I already reset, may as well get blasted! 

Again, it's up to you. Just know you don't have to go out with a bang if you do in fact reset. :)",2016-07-13 02:57:47+00:00,d5a41fm,1.0,t3_4skx19,380.0,stopdrinking

263,"Wow, welcome!  I can relate to a lot of your story.  I was still functioning really well at my job before I quit.  I started my career while drinking to excess and I progressed up the ladder and received quite a few promotions while drinking every single evening.  Sometimes I wonder what I could have been, or would have been, had I been less of a mess all those years!  :)

I am agnostic, but I attend AA.  I have been to meetings like you've described; some meetings attract people that have hit really low bottoms and seem really down and out.  It's very sad, and sometimes, those meetings don't have much of a ""solution vibe"" to them.  

What worked for me, which may not work for others, is I found some AA book study meetings in the area of town I live.  I found that the middle class suburban meetings have more of what I want, and if that is offensive, I apologize.  I also found really like minded professional people at meetings called ""commuter meetings.""  These meetings are generally held right after work, at about 5:30 - chock full of suits and folks living pretty decent lives who just can not control their alcohol intake.

One last thing, then I will shut up.... :)

I didn't think I was ready yet either.  I hadn't been fired, never got a DUI, never went to jail, owned a gorgeous home, did the suburban mom stuff, and was still with my partner after 15 years of my insane drinking behavior.  But something hit me pretty hard in the beginning once I did quit; like I said, I met some of the people you've described, and I thought to myself - ""ya know, keto, you can quit now, while you still have money in the bank and a car to drive and a family to go home to, or you can wait until those things are gone.  What sounds easier to handle?""  

I am really glad I quit when I did.  My only regret is not stopping earlier.  ",2016-07-12 13:35:22+00:00,d595puw,1.0,t3_4sfi5h,27732.0,stopdrinking

407,"I learned a while ago that there are lots of AA ""types.""

There are a good number of people that are known as ""1 and 12s.""  These are folks that have admitted they have a drinking problem (step 1), and they attend AA meetings and carry the very basic message of AA (step 12ish - AA can help you if you have a drinking problem).  Some people need this and it works for them.

Then there are AA fanatics.  Meetings daily for life, tons of AA social events, loads of service work, etc.  Some people need this and it works for them.

I myself am almost 2 years sober.  In the beginning, I went to 5-7 meetings a week.  I worked with my sponsor every weekend.  I went to therapy weekly. I reached out to my sponsor daily via text and called another alcoholic at least a few times a week.  I had 2 service positions and 2 home groups.  I put up a diary here DAILY for almost a year. 

I don't do that anymore.  Now I go to 1 or 2 meetings a week, more if I want to.  I see my sponsor for a session once every 3 weeks or so.  We check in by phone maybe once a week, and still text daily.  I socialize with my AA friends at meetings and sometimes outside of meetings, but I'm not ""Susie AA"" like I was in the beginning.  

But here's the thing, for me - I NEEDED to immerse myself in AA in the beginning so I could keep going.  I loved it.  I hated leaving my partner and son every night, but I would have drunk had I not gotten so involved.  So in the end, I am glad I did it.  

I'm sober and have a really solid relapse prevention plan.  I also have a pretty incredible life after barely living and wishing I would not wake up for about a decade.  So this is my experience.  Take what you will.

Oh and edited to add - the AA steps are amazing and completely reshaped my life.  My therapist uses a modified version of them for people that aren't alcoholics.  There is no way I would be where I am today without having done the steps.",2016-06-11 13:19:34+00:00,d44u4qh,1.0,t3_4nktfr,13107.0,stopdrinking

I made all new friends when I quit drinking. I met them at group recovery meetings.  At first, I thought meetings were stupid and for losers and only religious people - man amI glad I learned to stop judging something before I tried it.

As far as my experience with finally committing to sobriety, I was just really tired of constantly living in fear and anxiety over my continuous fuckups.  I was always a hot mess.  Literally and figuratively. I couldn't bring my toddler to birthday parties on the weekends cause I was always so hungover, my performance at work sucks, I cheated on my partner constantly, I drove in blackouts, and I forgot to just do simple things at home, like open the mail and do the laundry and cook food before it went bad in the fridge.  I was just not capable of being an adult.  So I quit.  I decided to quit and I reached out to people here, asked what worked for them, took their suggestions even when I didn't want to (this was the huge one for me - being WILLING to do whatever it took to get sober saved my life), and did the work, every day.

My life is amazing now. Most of the consequences from my drinking have disappeared.  My partner has forgiven me for my affairs, my career has taken off, and I am an amazing mom.  I go on vacations, I max out my retirement fund, and I take care of myself and my home.  I have a cleaning lady, a new car, and a busy social life. 

I couldn't say ANY of that 2 years ago.

454,"&gt;I am paradox: I have a huge ego and I think I'm smarter than everyone, but I also hate myself and think I don't deserve to be happy. I am dishonest. It's not the type of dishonesty I associated with addiction--I'm not stealing to support a habit or lying to the police. It's small, subtle daily lies I tell to myself and others regarding drinking and everything else.

Me to. Every word of this, and then some.  The cool thing is that even though I was pretty fucking pissed about trying AA, I met a lot of people there that struggle with the same things, and slowly but surely - things are better for me.

Facing my insides is scary.  It's scarier than facing my outsides.  But it's turned my life around completely.  You know what I did this morning?  I stopped myself in the middle of a petty fight I picked with my partner, and said ""Hey. My bad.  I dunno what my problem is, but this isn't healthy and it's not honest, and if you give me a chance to compose myself, I'd like the option to discuss this later when I am not in such a bad head space.""

465,"So this is a realization I have had a lot lately.  

When I first quit drinking, I would say to my friends in recovery ""I just wish I could have one drink. Just one glass of wine with dinner, or a beer with the game."" And finally, one of my friends with 11 years of sobriety asked me if I really meant that. While I struggled to answer him, he continued:  ""Because I thought I wanted that, and I realized halfway through my first sober year that I didn't want that one stupid drink at all.  What I wanted was to get hammered and drunk the way I wanted to, WHEN I wanted to, but without all of the consequences and guilt.""  

HA.  Man, did he hit the nail on the head.

That is totally what I want - in regards to drinking and everything else in my life.  Like I would love to tell the people at work that suck that they do, indeed suck, and then give them lists of all of the things they need to do to be better at work, and life.  But I don't get to do that, bc that isn't my job, and who the fuck am I?  I am, unfortunately, NOT the queen of the universe.  

So for me, it came down to a pros and cons list.  Drinking the way I want to drink causes me way more cons in my life than pros.  And since I have proven a million times that I can't and will not stop at one drink, then I just don't get to drink anymore, period.  I mean, yeah - I had a lot of days like you have described - where I take a day or 2 off from drinking and then only have a glass or 2 - SUCCESS!  MODERATION!  W000T!  But for me, it never lasted.  It was a farce.  It was another form of white knuckling in the end.

532,"Oh my goodness, hello!!!!

You are so sweet to call me out and give me some love, I appreciate all of you in my most excellent SD family.

As most of you know, I have a son.  I was still in active addiction when I got pregnant and it picked up right where I left off when my son was about 6 months old.  I decided to get sober a few months before his 4th birthday.  

He is graduating pre-school today.  He turned 5 in December, so he is off to kindergarten in the Fall.  I am in such a glass case of emotions right now over it.  I am happy, and sad - proud, and full of fear.  And I also am struggling with a chapter closing.  We will not be having any more children; it's a choice I am absolutely comfortable with and happy with, but there are still a lot of feelings over it when a ""big event"" occurs.

As far as recovery goes and how it has played into my life as a mom - it's been everything.  I barely recognize the mother I am today versus who I was less than 2 years ago.  Today I can be honest about my feelings, but also humble and grounded.  I used to attention whore constantly - ""HEY EVERYONE, I HAVE A PROBLEM, ME ME ME ME MEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"" and I would INSIST upon people giving me validation and kudos and shoulders to cry on and just basically I would suck all the energy out of a room. I know today that I don't have to do that. Today, I can be helpful.  I can smile at other parents having a rough time.  I can talk to my son about his big feelings, and I can leave myself out of it so I can be of maximum service to others.  

Probably most importantly, I can look at this celebration as one that does not need alcohol to make it better.  And I can also look directly at my big feelings and say ""Hey gurl.  It's OK. You are OK, today, right now, and for the rest of the day.""  None of this has to define me or wreck my day.  I can go with the flow.  Things will fall where they fall, and my life will work out the way it is supposed to be.

NONE of that was possible a few years ago. None of it.  In fact, if I had read any of that, I would have rolled my eyes and told myself to fuck off.  

But today I can wrap my arms around the spirit and emotions inside of me and give myself a hug and a break.

600,"Sure.  I drink bc I am a disaster emotionally and mentally.  I am full of anger, rage, fear, self loathing, insecurities, and lots of other negative stuff.  About a year before I quit drinking, I entered therapy with my partner bc we were fighting constantly and with a child in the house, I knew we had to do something if we wanted our child to be safe.  

Through therapy and then later, sobriety and the AA program, I have been able to deal with what goes on inside of me.  And that opened me up to being able to be ok with myself, as long as I am working every day to be better.  I mean, I used to be a basket case. I screamed at my family, I raged out at strangers, my ego and superiority complex would take over my professional life and would have eventually landed me fired....and I had no true friends to speak of.  My life fucking sucked, honestly.  

And now it is amazing.  I am more emotionally stable then I have ever been.  This morning I got pissed at my partner bc I was making coffee and dealing with the 5 year old and trying to plan my day and making breakfast - all while he was upstairs sleeping.  So I started getting REALLY mad and resentful. In the past,  I would have been hingover, and I would have stormed upstairs to give him a piece of my mind, scaring my kid in the process and setting the tone for yet another crappy day.  But today, I was able to pause, and really THINK ABOUT where that resentment was coming from.  And once I did that, I was able to really think about whether or not it was actually a big deal in the grand scheme of things.  And by the time my partner did come downstairs, I had completely shifted to a place of joy over seeing him.

THAT, my friend - all of that may come naturally to other people.  But that shit ruled my life for decades.  And being able to work through stuff like that now is a friggin' miracle.  ",2016-05-01 13:57:32+00:00,d2oejnt,3.0,t1_d2odyu9,1306.0,stopdrinking

I've learned that some days I am going to wake up pissy for no reason at all, and that it is my job to turn that around if I want to. I have learned to pause and think before taking action.  I have learned that other people have feelings and that I need to respect that and them.  I have learned that life is way fucking bigger than I ever thought it was.

There are lots of opinions in AA on lots of different things. There's no requirement to tell every person in AA all of your secrets.  There's also no requirement to work the program exactly like anyone else.  I happen to work with a sponsor and I don't use any other drugs; there are people who don't have sponsors, who go to meetings for the fellowship and socialization only, and I would have no idea if anyone else smoked pot unless they told me.

I was just at a noon meeting, and I was sharing about heeding my own ""friendly warnings.""

Over the past few weeks, I have been thinking my job isn't good enough for me, and that the pay isn't what it SHOULD be, and how I don't feel important enough.  I have also been beating myself up over only having one child, bc everyone seems to have at least 2.  And SHOULDN'T I do what everyone else does?

But here's the thing:

I LIKE my job.  I get paid more than enough for what I do.  I have excellent work life balance and amazing benefits.  I am content.

I LIKE having one child.  My patience and tolerance is already on the low side; I can't imagine how I would handle 2 kids asking me the same question 30 times in a row.

I am simply not a content person, and I need to remember that, recognize it, accept it, and be willing to come to terms with it so I can continue to get better at this crazy little thing we call life.  ",2016-03-16 17:25:24+00:00,d126lf6,1.0,t3_4aorfm,935.0,stopdrinking

These 2 things do not go together.  

I am with you on all of this. I have been exactly where you are.  I was a lying, cheating drunk for a long time, and I hurt my long term partner (going on 15 years) for a very long time.  

We are doing a lot better.  But counseling was a must for us. It was also a must for me to work a sobriety program and make it a priority, while continuing to make it a very close second priority to work on my relationship and my own lack of empathy and kindness towards a person who was deeply hurt by my actions.

You mention jail, infidelity, financial troubles, and other hell - and now you expect for her to let it all go in 5 months bc YOU have worked a program of recovery?

&gt;I don't know how to help her.

829,"&gt;So 1 year later my daughter and I are living with my sister in another state. We’ve been here since June of last year. My wife was not able to stop. She let a dude she met in rehab the first time shack up with her quickly after she asked for me to leave and take our daughter. Since then she has lost her promising career, totaled her car and been evicted. It has been a couple months since I have heard from her and 4 months when she stopped asking about our daughter. I hold nothing against her. This is a terrible disease.

843,"Hi there!  6 weeks and a day - amazing!!!

I attend therapy as well as AA meetings.  I have relied on both to stay sober and ""start living"", so I think it's great that you are so open to doing whatever it may take you to get and stay sober. There are lots of other options out there too!  

https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_real_life_support_groups

Both /u/ashesinflames  and /u/VictoriaElaine had some great additions to that list on another sub:

&gt; Another option if someone is too anxious/scared to leave the house is to find them a community withdrawal management program: you call in, take to someone about withdrawal, and get support.

&gt; Another option for someone with intense mental health problems and concurrent substance use is a crisis team...in Ontario there are mental health crisis workers that will come to your home and evaluate you.

&gt; In the US there is also a growing presence of ""Peer Support Workers"" They are popping up all over the US and starting to surface in Canada.

and

&gt; There's far more a person can do to get outside support than AA.  Therapy, friends, group therapy, rehab, SMART, meetup.com for outdoorsy and daytime non-drink related get togethers, Sierra Club, Book clubs, WFS, Life Ring, Refuge Recovery, ACA, ASCA, Divorce Groups, Depression groups, PTSD groups, and SOS are but a few other options a person has to connect and get outside support.

Like VE says, **telling myself ""I won't drink today"" isn't enough.**  I attend therapy and AA meetings, I work with other alcoholics in AA and I am active here on SD, I  read and listen to recovery literature and I watch addiction and recovery movies and documentaries, I reach out and talk about my issues...I do these things on a pretty regular basis.

896,"TOTALLY.

The tricky part for me was that I had made the same decision many, many times throughout my 20s and early 30s. I never made it past a few weeks though bc once the initial hangover and anxiety and guilt wore off, I went right back to my coping mechanism - drinking.

Here is what worked for me:

I posted here and took suggestions.  I read everything I could, and related to others here about drinking and feeling helpless and hopeless.  We have an [IRC chat](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/stopdrinking/) here - it's new and improved and AMAZING.  Check it out!

I was in therapy for other reasons when I quit - I came out to my therapist right away and we immediately started meeting more often to discuss addiction.

I immersed myself in recovery and addiction literature, movies, blogs, podcasts, etc.  

I attended AA meetings. I REALLY didn't want to, but people here on SD gently suggested them and I found that despite my reservations, the meetings ended up really helping me.  I don't go as often as I used to now, but I still credit the process and the people I met there with helping me get and maintain healthy sobriety. 

I made a big old nasty list of all of the reasons I was quitting. The affairs, the physical violence, the drunk driving, the health problems - I put it all down on paper and when I wanted a drink and started to feel like ""I mean, I am not that bad, I didn't murder anyone, amirite?"", I would read the list and it would motivate me to keep going.

928,"I wasn't able to simply stop drinking. I had to do other things to help me relearn how to live my life.  For me, that included therapy and self work in recovery support groups.  I also reach out, in person by phone or face to face, to other alcoholics on a daily basis. Today by 11am I had texted with, talked with, and messaged with (here) other folks facing similar challenges with alcohol as I do.

&gt;Ah the fight is far from over. I have a feeling that if just starting.

This was my experience, mama.  Putting down the bottle and refusing to pick back up the glass was way easier than figuring out how to live a SOBER life.  I could not do it alone.  And I am not ashamed that I reached out for help.  The help I have gotten and the connections I have made in real life have been nothing short of awesome.

I finally got so sick of myself I just stopped, regardless of all of the traumas I had not YET experienced. I call them YETS BC they eventually would have happened to me. And it's been a lot easier for me to quit with my family, job, and license.

It's not always easy, but it has been really simple for me. I make the decision to not drink every single day, and I don't stray, from that decision, no matter what. I also use therapy and recovery support groups, but not everyone does. There are lots of ways to get and stay sober.

It sounds like you have tried to stop and have had success at doing so in the past. What have you tried?  Are you willing to try other avenues?  

I was willing to do whatever it took to stop drinking. Because of that willingness, I did a lot of things I never would have been comfortable with just weeks before I finally stopped.  I came out to my therapist and some friends and family members, starting going to recovery meetings, and fought every single day to ""not drink, no matter what.""

Willingness was key for me.  And every single day that I didn't drink made the next day a little bit brighter and more full of hope.",2016-01-18 17:21:42+00:00,cz2vdpu,1.0,t3_41jqsm,2013.0,stopdrinking

I stopped before I had a lot of the consequences others face.

I was able to find a lot of help through therapy and then recovery support groups (AA for me, personally).

The Saturday Shares in the sidebar contain a lot of stories and I know I found a lot of solace reading them, one by one, day after day.  This place was my first stop on the road to sobriety, and I will always credit it with the reason I am sober today.

1350,"&gt;I was with my family so it was easier to be sober then. But as soon as I got home again I immediately got a lot of beers and went home to consume it.

I can relate so much to this.  For years and years, I would be able to string together a few days or weeks of ""dry time"" bc the situation called for it or bc I was willing for whatever reason (quick weight loss, being around parents, work obligations, etc.).

I was finally willing to stop no matter WHAT the circumstances, and that made all the difference. WILLINGNESS. And acceptance that the way I drank was simply not OK.

Please do me a favor and edit your post to speak from the I.  The last paragraph does not follow our guidelines for participation, which I encourage you to read here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_speak_from_the_.22i..22

Speaking from the I was hard for me at first.  And because I was (and still am) involved in AA, I assumed everyone was and that everyone was open to it and its tenets.  I was wrong, and it was pointed out to me.  :)

For example, I could see the last paragraph fitting in with our guidelines if it were slightly edited:

&gt; When I was new, I thought I was alone; I was not. I talked about how I felt, I told others what I was doing. When all else failed, I tried prayer. I didn't set a goal of not drinking for X days, months, years.  I just did what I had to do to not drink for that one day.

I feel like my good friend /u/coolcrosby would have some good insight on this. He's a swell guy and SD superfan and superuser.

I guess what I can say to you is that this too shall pass, and when I'm feeling like this, I dig in, get extra rest, and hold on your by hour. I think you probably have a golden opportunity regarding the sponsor. I was devastated when my first sponsor dropped me but then found the best sponsor ever. It helps me to keep an open mind and at least try to believe that things happen for a reason and that good things happen to good people.  I dunno.

I wish I could say pregnancy kept me sober.  It did not.  I drank while pregnant.  Moderately - probably the most ""normal"" I ever drank in my life - but the gold standard is to not drink at all while pregnant.

After I had a baby, it was only a short while until I was drinking to excess and blacking out pretty regularly.  I put myself and my sweet son in danger more times than I care to count.  I finally sought help when he was almost 4 years old.  I don't recommend this to anyone.  If I could go back in time, I would have started treatment, counseling, SDing, and recovery meetings the day I found out I was pregnant.

I know you probably think I am being harsh on you, but this type of thread comes up on SD CONSTANTLY, and the results are generally not great.  Being around alcohol in the earliest stages of sobriety can be very hard.  When I decided to quit, I decided to take advice from those before me that were successful in meeting their goal, and do absolutely ANYTHING to quit and stay quit.

I'm not saying you have to cancel the party or lock yourself away in a dungeon all night to avoid drinking.

That's one of the reasons I make it a requirement (after learning the hard way) for my sponsees to attend at least one weekly women only meeting and get phone numbers of other women to call in the event I am not available.

The sponsor's job, as I have been taught, is to open the door to the program and help someone go through the steps.  I too haven't done much beyond reading and talking with my sponsor since I started making amends. I feel OK with that, and I text my sponsor ever single day as I have since I started working with her.  It's a requirement, and I do it - whether she texts me back or not.

I don't like when my sponsees don't take my direction.

1990,"&gt;Why do I drink when I don't want to? Why am I posting on Stop Drinking?? Why have I been trying to quit for 14 YEARS and am sitting here with only 15 days on my badge?

I asked myself a lot of the same questions.  Finally, it clicked for me, and the days started adding up and haven't stopped.  

I drank a LOT like you.  My crazy time was in my 20s, and the first year of my 30s.  Then I too got pregnant and managed to drink very little during my pregnancy. After my son was born, I held it together relatively well for the first few months of his life, but as soon as I could, I started binge drinking again.

I often say that dealing with a hangover and a newborn is a punishment I would not wish on my worst enemy.  Yet I still did it to myself, week after week.  Insanity for sure.

In the beginning, my partner - who has seen me at my drunkest, who has had me cheat on him numerous times while wasted, and who has been the brunt of excessive amounts of verbal and emotional from me - also didn't think I had to quit altogether.  He wanted me to try again to ""cut down.""

My mother just said to me this weekend that someday, I will be a social drinker again, like I used to be.

My partner has come around, bc he is reaping and seeing the benefits of my sobriety.  My mom?  I don't worry about her.  She'll see the truth, or she won't - not my issue.

 &gt;I'm tired of holding onto my control. It feels like trying to grasp a rope that burns my hands as it slips through. Inside I still feel like that girl in her 20s, out of control and not caring if the next drink or drug kills her because who cares. I put on a good show for the world, but it feel like the illusion could fall apart at any moment. Sometimes it does, like the time I couldn't take my kid to the doctor because I was too hungover or the time I made a fool of myself in front of my lovely boss (who avoided me after that).

This speaks really loudly to me. I GET THIS.  And what I can tell you, from experience, is that as soon as I put down the glass, made a plan, and started to stick to it - NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED, GOOD OR BAD - every single day, life got better for me.  And it gets better all the time.

I am really glad you are here, and I hope you stick around and keep us updated on your progress.",2015-12-06 15:31:23+00:00,cxp4ult,1.0,t3_3vnv8l,2981.0,stopdrinking

I can remember feeling the way you are describing; lost, scared, like a loser. Sad. Disappointed in myself. All of it. And the worst part was, I didn't know how to fix it.

I found this subreddit and started to immerse myself in thoughts of recovery and feeling better. It was hard at first, really hard. I wanted to drink more than once. But every time to wanted to, I dug in and forced myself to do something else. There were quite a few nights that I went to bed at 8pm, just so I wouldn't drink.

It took time for me to feel better. The hard part was that once I got a few weeks of dry time, I forgot how bad things were, and I entertained drinking again.

I am glad to hear you are sticking with your sobriety program through the pain.  I'm going through some crappy relationship stuff now too - I wanted to skip the meeting last night and I didn't want to talk to my sponsor today, but I did both and felt better.

Things may feel yucky, and I have no idea what the future will bring me, but I DO know that as long as I stay sober, I can handle shit thrown at me.

2206,"Yes.  

I wanted to change and I wanted things to get better and I wanted forgiveness.  So I didn't ever drink, and don't ever drink, no matter what.

What helped me was to write down all of the horrible, terrible, disgusting, seemingly unforgivable shit I did while drunk.  That way, I had something tangible to look at and remind me when I started craving alcohol and when I started to have those thoughts like ""Oh, maybe I am NOT a real alcoholic, hmmmm, maybe I will behave this time, maybe I can really have only just a few, blah blah blah.""  

No one would have forgiven me if I kept fucking up.  So I don't.  I don't drink, NO MATTER WHAT, I go to AA meetings, I go to therapy, and I do whatever I have to do every day to not take a drink. It can be done.

edit:  My last night drunk included my sweet, dear 3 year old little boy seeing me in a horrible blackout.  I can relate to your story.  I can also tell you that with hard work and dedication, this cycle of alcohol abuse can end.    ",2015-11-03 15:34:35+00:00,cwmxqfz,1.0,t3_3rd105,555.0,stopdrinking

My drinking wasn't always terrible.  Even towards the end (I drank alcoholically from day one, and really started drinking a lot, like more than once or twice a week, at the end of college - I am 36, so consider my real drinking career to be about 15 years long) I could have a few glasses of wine or a couple of cocktails and act like a pretty decent human being.  The thing is, I never knew what was going to happen when I drank.  Like, I MAY behave and act normal and have a good time....or I MAY see someone who looks like they drink like me and then stay out all day and completely ignore my family and my responsibilities and drive in a blackout and cheat on my spouse.  I HAVE NO IDEA.  

And I just wanted it to stop.  I wanted the drama, and the unproductive and anxious and depressed life I was living to just calm down.  I wanted to stop hating myself and everyone else.

I go to therapy, and I attend AA.  A year ago, I would have laughed at anyone who even mentioned AA around me.  Now I go, willingly - and I love my therapist.

2282,"Early on in my tenure here on SD, I was pretty guilty of not speaking from the I.  I remember there was a thread about AA, and I was SO OFFENDED that not everyone was praising AA and lauding it and I made some comment like ""Well, speaking form the I, I think AA is the greatest thing ever and people that don't use it are pie loving nerds!""  It was something stupid like that. It was removed by OTR.  I am pretty sure I stamped my feet and was VERY VERY ANGRY and unsubscribed from SD for a few hours.  BC everything is all about me, of course.    

Like /u/embryonic_journey, I have found that speaking from the I works not only on SD, but in the rest of my life and world as well.  There's something about sharing experiences that just really....works.  

Speaking from the I and enforcing that rule here on SD can be a very gray area. But it is something I think is so, so important. For example: telling someone to just go to a meeting sucks for a number of reasons, and one of them is that it is lazy as FUCK. Seriously, remember back to when you were new, or when you were floundering - and imagine you poured your heart out to SD, and all you got in response was ""go to an AA meeting!!!!"" Or, ""your spouse is never gonna change, get to an alanon meeting!!!""

I find this to be so unhelpful. Here is some personal backstory for you: I am not a small person, and have more than a couple of pounds to lose - do you know how disheartening it is to hear skinny people say ""just eat less and move more, yo!"" It may be TRUE, and it may be really good advice, but what would be BETTER would be: 
&gt;""hey girl, I totally know how you feel. I too used to be overweight. I felt so lost all the time, and I didn't know what to do - there's so much info out there! What I ended up doing was tracking my calories and exercising - sounds simple, but in the beginning, it was so hard! But I lived to tell the tale and have seen some great personal success. The best part is that now, it is so much easier than that first day was!""

I know I may get flack for this, but as a mod, I can tell you that one of the biggest abuses of ""speaking from the I"" is the lazy, flippant order of telling a newcomer to ""get to a meeting.  Guys, we owe it to people to put more thoughts into our comments than just ""hey man, get to AA, and fast!""  We can do better than that, so let's BE better than that.",2015-10-23 13:32:00+00:00,cwa0aba,1.0,t3_3pw580,9115.0,stopdrinking

I am extremely proud to be here.  It's not always easy.  It's not always as fulfilling as I thought it would be. Sometimes, it's downright hard.  Tonight, it is sad.  But that's ok.  Life isn't always sunshine and rainbows and cans of ice cold LaCroix.

I don't always know what I am doing here.  Sometimes, I have a hard time separating my recovery lives; I am active here, and also active in AA, and I am still really a newcomer in sobriety.  I have a lot to learn.  I miss things. I make mistakes.  I piss people off probably more than I make them smile.  But I guess that's part of the reason they pay me the no bucks.  :)

You're all awesome.  This place saved my life.  It really did.  The old timers, the newcomers, and the people who have gone off to do other things - they've all been an integral part of my recovery.  I have no doubt in my mind that I would not be sober today without SD.

I was drunk around my child far too often.  I was not in a place to be a good, responsible mother to him more times than I can count.  Terrible things could have happened to him while he was in my drunk care.  I will never stop being grateful for the fact that both of us are alive, despite my best intentions to change that - even if I didn't realize at the time that that was EXACTLY what I was leaving ourselves open to.  Death.  I was so selfish and lost in my disease that I was willing to lose the most important thing in the world.

There are options and services that will provide help if you ask for it.  There are family members that contacted you - your husband, your cousin, your mother, and your brother.  If the baby is unsafe in your care, owning up to that and doing something about it BEFORE tragedy happens could literally save lives.

I am really glad you reached out, and hope you find some peace.

2513,"&gt; So that's where I stand. I've got a job,a house, a car, and a dog. 

That's a helluva lot to have considering the alcohol induced messes you've described.

&gt;And now there is nothing left but the job.

Well...and yourself, your parents you've mentioned more than once, the dog, and the car and the house.  

I didn't lose my house, or my car, or custody, or even my license.  I was and still can be unbelievably selfish.  I also tend to think I am the only person on the planet with my problems and that no one could possibly understand how unique I am and how my story is like NO OTHER STORY EVER.  None of this is true.  And while I sometimes do wish that my life could go back to that sweet spot where drinking and drugging was fun and without incurring any major pain or consequences yet, well, what's all it is - A WISH.  It is never going to happen.   

AA didn't click for me at first.  I pretty much fumbled through it wondering if it was cult for a good 3 months.  Then something changed, I dunno. I don't talk about it too much on here bc my recovery plan is mine, and I don't like to push it on others.  But the fact for me is, something changed and everything got better and it continues to get better every day.  I will tell you that 1) gratitude for what I've got and 2) acceptance of life and the fact that I am not the only one living on this earth have done me a world of good.  My shit can get pretty messy and terrible the minute I start living life without gratitude, in envy of others, and/or when I let my ego start driving everything again and act on my selfishness.  

&gt;TLDR: As my grandpa used to say, ""life's a bitch, and then you die,"" so hopefully I can get comfortable with that.

Yeah, some people say that and think it.  It's certainly a choice a person can make to believe in this mantra.  Doesn't seem very enjoyable to me, though.  I prefer, ""Welcome to the human race.  Life's hard - why not enjoy it anyway?""",2015-09-22 03:35:58+00:00,cv9u2ef,1.0,t3_3lw0fz,3280.0,stopdrinking

I did.  It was incredible.

Guidelines for Participation

We ask that you try to follow these guidelines while participating in this community. Doing so helps keep /r/stopdrinking a warm &amp; welcoming place for all participants.

**Be kind.**

Be kind. If you can't be kind, at least be civil.


**Speak from the ""I.""**

We ask that you refrain from speaking in the imperative. That means don't tell others what they should or must do. It's better to phrase your advice in terms of your own story, talking about what worked for you.

*Bad: ""You should do X""*

Good: ""When I was in your situation, I did X, and here is how it worked out for me...""

This isn't a bright line rule, and context matters. If a poster asks ""What should I do?,"" responding with ""You should do X"" may be appropriate. But telling someone who isn't asking for advice that they need to do something is inappropriate. Remember, not everyone takes the same path to sobriety, and what works for you may not work for others. All any of us can do is tell our own story and hope that others find the similarities themselves.",2015-09-17 11:28:44+00:00,cv4kagq,2.0,t1_cv4ftce,18352.0,stopdrinking

I love relating to people.  So I have to be really careful in recovery meetings.  There are people there that I feel super close to, and love that we feel the same about things, and there's this weird romantic ""omg we are so broken, let's be broken together"" vibe that happens and I just fall for it.  

So - how did I get to know all this about myself?  I kind of always knew, when I was being honest.  I then talked to my sponsor about it.  My character defect list (step 6) is giant, and it includes all of these things.  **And I also have to tell myself to shut the fuck up, and act my way into better thinking.**  

If I am spending my time thinking about some person I shouldn't be thinking about, that's on me to make changes.  Sometimes it really is about just letting go of it, and not fucking doing the thing, ya know?  If I am thinking about someone and I am still seeing them at meetings, texting them from a place that is not about recovery and helping others, hanging out for way too long smoking after the meeting (social hour), then I am not working my program - I am socializing.

2739,"It's my understanding that drinking while on medication for anxiety is pretty much never a good idea.

Alcoholism runs in my family, on both sides.  I drank alcoholically for many years, through my mid-thirties.  My only regret about quitting is that I didn't do it sooner.

I went to a therapist to discuss my anxiety and communication and anger problems.  About a year after I started working with her, I realized my drinking was absolutely out of control and was keeping me from making any headway in therapy.  I could not ""fix"" my communication, anxiety, and anger problems bc I was always drunk, hungover, or thinking to get drunk.  

I attend therapy, both by myself and with my partner of many years.  I also attend recovery meetings.  My life has completely turned around in almost a year.  I can't remember being this content and full of hope for the future.

2754,"https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_speak_from_the_.22i..22

**Speak from the ""I.""**

We ask that you refrain from speaking in the imperative. That means don't tell others what they should or must do. It's better to phrase your advice in terms of your own story, talking about what worked for you.

Bad: ""You should do X""

Good: ""When I was in your situation, I did X, and here is how it worked out for me...""

This isn't a bright line rule, and context matters. If a poster asks ""What should I do?,"" responding with ""You should do X"" may be appropriate. But telling someone who isn't asking for advice that they need to do something is inappropriate. Remember, not everyone takes the same path to sobriety, and what works for you may not work for others. All any of us can do is tell our own story and hope that others find the similarities themselves.",2015-08-20 19:52:45+00:00,cu9ukkk,5.0,t1_cu9ugib,161.0,stopdrinking

We attend therapy together, and we each see the same person individually. I also attend recovery meetings.  All of the work we are doing is infinitely better than all of the drinking I was doing.

A lot of the house and child care and all of the driving is on me bc my partner has a progressive illness.  He has mobility issues and is not allowed to drive.

2786,"Cool.  I only asked bc you mentioned the meetings helped at one point; wasn't trying to push anything on you.  I hope it didn't come across that way.

It took me a while to accept that I had an actual drinking problem, and that was after I decided to quit.  I always thought I probably drank differently than others, but all attempts at moderation and stopping were pretty half assed.  Once I actually came here, decided to quit, got a badge, called my therapist to admit my drinking problems, and THEN decided to try some support meetings - I STILL had a few months of anger and sadness and really wondering whether or not I ""belonged"" where I was.  I really, really thought I wanted to drink like ""normal"" people, so the thought of quitting made me feel all kinds of emotions.

It got better.  [It still gets better, and sometimes it sucks, but overall, it gets better.](http://www.abelleinbrooklyn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Success.jpg)  I don't always love sobriety, bc feelings, and shame, and grown up shit I don't want to face and do.  I don't always like therapy, or meetings.  In fact, right now, I kind of hate meetings.  But I know it's me.  It's not the meetings, and it's not my therapist, it is me, rebelling against this.  Even though I am almost at a year, and know full well I can't drink normally and that the exercise is futile, I still get sad and mad sometimes.  And that's OK.  It's OK to feel that way, and think, and as you said - sit with my thoughts and emotions - it's all OK, as long as I don't drink.  BC I KNOW what happens.  I have no reason to think that I will ever drink ""normally"" again, bc the thing is - I never did.

I posted here about how I was avoiding AA, then heard about SMART - looked into it, and they only had one meeting in my area, once a week.  My friend at the time was semi-active in AA, and she offered to take me to a meeting.  She and I ended up going to meetings a few times a week pretty regularly for the first 4-5 months of my sobriety, and then she decided she wasn't going to do AA anymore.  We are still friends.  She doesn't drink.  I still go to AA.

AA was nothing like I thought it would be.  I know lots of people get sober without AA, and maybe I will not do AA forever, who knows?  But for now, it is an integral part of my journey.

&gt; You know the excuses - maybe after this weekend - maybe after this work week - oh, it's not that bad, so many people have it worse 

This whole sobriety thing is totally doable. What's even more unbelievable is that it also has the capacity to be ENJOYABLE.  I flippin' LOVE sobriety.  And I used to drink no matter what was going on that should have kept me from drinking.

But in the beginning, I needed a lot of reminders.  I had to continually play the tape forward.  This story you posted will help you with that as you need it.  It can help when you start craving, and thinking one or 2 beers won't hurt.  But there is work with that, too.  I had to work through my cravings and anger in the beginning, and sometimes that meant screaming and crying into a pillow and going to bed at 7:30pm. Or going to an AA meeting when I just wanted to zone out to Netflix.  Or telling my therapist the truth about my past.  I have to work at this, or I will not succeed.  the good news is, every day I get behind me makes the next day a little easier.

I wish you the best, and I am so thankful you shared such a powerful story.

He is definitely more comfortable when it is not super hot and humid.  No eye issues.  He has been to NIH and Hopkins to meet with specialists because they originally thought it was paraparesis, but genetic testing didn't really point definitively to that.  

The symptoms started in 2005.  We do often wonder if the docs missed something or misread something, but it's been years and years and he has been tested for SO MANY THINGS.  His brother has MS and got it young and has been confined to a bed or wheelchair for a while now.  My partner currently takes a whole slew of meds for all of the symptoms, and sometimes I just feel like the meds themselves, or the combination of them, could be making things worse.  He's always tired and foggy.  Current meds include:

biotin

levetiracetam (kepra)

tecfidera

tamsulosin

baclofen

gabapentin

dronabinol

2972,"When I was about 2 months off the sauce, I had an old drinking buddy come to me asking me about how I was doing it.  I talked up SD, therapy, and AA, as those are the 3 main parts of my sobriety plan.  I am not sure if she ever came by here, but she did see a therapist who told her she couldn't help her with her other issues if she wasn't willing to quit drinking, and she eventually stopped drinking and then attended a number of AA meetings over a 3 week period.

She reached out to me about 5 weeks after I took her to her first meeting, and said she was drinking again and couldn't bring herself to get to a meeting or call her therapist.  I tried, unsuccessfully, a number of times to get her to come to  a meeting or go to coffee with me.  She now openly drinks again.  She also doesn't really contact me at all.  

I was really new at not drinking when this all went down, but it was a valuable lesson.  You can lead a horse to water, you can't make it drink.  There are solutions to problems, and most people who come around asking about whether or not their drinking is a problem are fully aware of at least a few of the solutions out there.  I myself knew about AA, but through SD and my therapist, I learned about all kinds of other, non-AA support groups available to people with drinking problems.  But now that I HAVE the knowledge, it's really up to me to apply it as I see fit every day if I want to continue to succeed.  

I think you did a great job, and if I were in your shoes, I wouldn't push it any more.  She knows the solution if she is interested.  if not, she'll figure it out, whether it be positive or negative.  ",2015-07-21 19:28:27+00:00,ctb8bgl,1.0,t3_3e3ocy,3080.0,stopdrinking

I will share this with you.  I did a lot of damage to my relationship with my SO, and caused him a lot of pain due to my alcohol abuse.  Some of it is really tangible and based on bad, bad behavior, and some of it I wasn't even aware of until he came clean to me after I was sober for a little while.  I ruined a lot of nights and days and fun times for him bc I was either wasted and a mess that he had to take care of, or just simply not mentally present. I can't get those times back and I can't make him forget that it happened. What I can do is live every day a little better and strive to be a present, responsible, and loving partner.

I did [some reading](http://www.drinkspirits.com/bar-life/drink-youre-drinking/) on this bc I was really interested in how alcoholic bitters actually is.  I think you may find comfort in this:

&gt;When I am taking a break from drinking, I often rely on a very simple drink that almost any bar can make, something that is easy to sip with more complexity and flavor than having a soda. Angostura makes perhaps the most well-known bitters in the world, used in most of the key spirit-forward classic cocktails like the Old Fashioned and the Manhattan. Angostura is a mix of herbs, water, sugar, gentian, and spirit that acts like a binding agent in drinks (bringing all the flavors together). Although Angostura is spirit based (and has 44.7% alcohol), the amount you use in a drink is fairly small. I did some measuring and 5 dashes of Angostura equals ¼ tsp which has 0.550 ml of alcohol. To put that in perspective, a low alcohol beer with 3% alcohol would have 7.09 ml of alcohol in an 8 ounce serving, or 14.0ml in a pint. You can get intoxicating qualities from Angostura, but you need to use a full 1-2 ounces.",2015-07-15 16:58:47+00:00,ct4biw5,1.0,t3_3deagp,1934.0,stopdrinking

I have been having such a wonderful time doing innocent, fun stuff lately.  I take my child to play and really enjoy it.  I grab an iced coffee and roll down all the windows and sing as loudly as I can with the wind whipping through the car.  Yesterday, I was able to wake up early without an alarm, shower and pack and take my son to the beach for the day as a surprise.  

I never, ever, ever could have or would have done that while drinking.  First of all, I would have been hungover after a weekend binge.  I also would have cried and screamed over the thought of putting on a bathing suit (I am about 60 pounds overweight).  I would have bemoaned doing anything beyond living on the couch all day and either drinking more or just being depressed and eating my feelings.  My son would have played by himself and watched movies all day.

The root of all of those things is SELFISHNESS, for me.  Now I am still a lover of sleeping in, and I still hate how I look in a bathing suit, but now, I can put those things aside and look at the big picture.  Can I sleep in another day?  Yes.  Does my kid care about what my thighs look like?  No.  Is living on the couch really ""living"" at all?  Absolutely not.

Quitting drinking has enabled me to regain control of my life.  In regaining control of my life, I have been able and willing to do things that make me EXAMINE my life, and in turn, make changes where I see fit.

That isn't addressing one person, that's YOU PEOPLE'ing the sub.

You also did that a few other times:

&gt;So many long term people are still here, still think about drinking all the time. I'm sorry, but that doesn't sound healthy or fun, either.

&gt;So, I've decided to give light to moderate drinking a shot. I know a lot of you have tried and failed and think it just leads to a downward spiral.

&gt;I just really dislike all the fatalism and fundamentalism that comes from a large chunk of folks here.

&gt;A lot of people are awesome here but a lot are also bitter and very extreme in their beliefs of what works and what doesn't.

&gt;They lack willpower, support, information, psychological help, personal insight or something. If they weren't lacking in something they wouldn't have a problem. Handing your problems over to an imaginary friend and asking them to fix it is not a good solution, it's a dillusion.

&gt;The more I read here the more I realized I'm not really like a lot of the people here. My life is not in shambles because of alcohol.

You seem very resolute in your decision, and that's fine.  It's your decision.  You also seem quite proud of yourself and all of the comments you made here.  Terrific.  Self confidence is a good thing.  But as a moderator and active participant here, I am not going to sit back and watch someone disparage an entire cross section of this subreddit.

I had a hard time sticking with my plans at first too,  for many years. I could not truly accept that drinking was really that bad for me in my life. I didn't think my consequences were all that bad. So I would make it to a few days or a few weeks and since my hangover was gone and things seemed better, I would drink again.

This went on for years.

I finally wrote down all of the ways drinking had fucked up my life and other people's lives. I wrote down how I couldn't control myself while drunk or the amount I drank. Doing this and reading it over and over again when I got the urge to drink helped make it sink in for me.

Acceptance was absolutely the key for me.

That being said, it's totally normal - at least it was for ME - to still crave alcohol and to feel resentful and jealous over the first few months.  Give yourself a break.  :)  For me, this called for chocolate and LaCroix, in large quantities.

Then DO IT.  I did; still do, in fact.  I cancelled plans, broke engagements, and went to bed at 7:30pm, crying in my pillow, more than one time.  Lemme tell you - I don't regret skipping those alcohol fueled and centered events at ALL today, and everyone's feelings who were hurt have gotten over it.  

And I still smoke.  I am phasing quitting.  I am starting with no more smoking during the day in July.  Then in August I will only smoke before/after recovery meetings.  Then by my 1 year anniversary in September, I will be off smoking.  That's my plan.
