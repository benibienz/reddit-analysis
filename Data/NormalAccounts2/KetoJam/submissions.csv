Last year, I wrote [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3h79dw/easy_like_sunday_mornin/). Today is another gorgeous Sunday, and much like last year - because I am sober, the world is my oyster. 

I have been going through a lot of my old posts on SD lately; man, how grateful am I for this incredible community?  I recently clocked in for a total of 2 years of fantastic and glorious sobriety, and I can promise you all that I would not be sober today without the incredible people of SD.  For me, this shit works.  I hope every single person here finds some bit of awesome, no matter how large or small.

I have cancelled a lot of plans.

I have gone to therapy and been honest about some really scary, terrible, horrifying shit in my past.  

I have stopped hanging out with my addict friends.  

I wasted money by giving away drugs and alcohol.

I have gone to group support (AA) meetings, when I would rather have been any fucking other place on the planet.

I have cried myself to sleep.

I have stopped, meditated, taken a walk, played the tape forward, and just passed the time by breathing through my angst.

I've been thinking a lot about this lately - the masks I wore and the masks I still wear today.

 Then my drinking escalated.  My masks got sadder. My masks were mainly Denial Mask and Desperate Mask.  

Today, I am sober and free and full of clarity, perspective, and gratitude.  The only mask I try to wear today is my mask of authenticity - my Truth Mask.  I try to live each day walking in my truth, and showing the world my good heart through my respect and love to all other people, places, and things.

I am closing in on my second year of sobriety, and while it was definitely harder than the first year, it is amazing to me how easy life is without drinking.

Constantly drunk/hungover/planning a drink, always irritable, making terrible and dangerous decisions, hating everyone and everything...what a circle of desperation and insanity. How did I survive?  How did I get anything done?  How did I not end up alone, in jail, without my family or job....dead?

*What I get from it:*  In the beginning of my SD journey, my main goal every day was to not drink.  And believe me, [that was enough](http://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxsxx1082b1qzygwfo1_1280.jpg) - trying to do anything else would have been too much for me.

Things are a little different now. I don't have to focus so much on the minute to minute, day to day ""don't drink, no matter what"" mantra, but the work is just as hard in other ways.  These days, I get to focus on doing all of the things that I couldn't do bc I was drinking.  These things range from being able to exercise and wake up at a decent hour to working on my emotional issues and repairing the damage I did to others while living as an addict for well over a decade.

[I am very comfortable](http://m.likesuccess.com/quotes/18/859067.png) with the fact that I would rather read a book to my son than get a promotion at work so I can buy a bigger house.

Almost 2 years ago, I came out of a blackout and for the first time in over a decade, realized my drinking was more dangerous than anything else. Gone was any fun - it was replaced with terror, danger, bad decisions, and one consequence after another.  All of it was negative.  I was falling apart, and it was very frightening.

I googled sobriety forums.  I found this place.  I read post after post, and dug deep into the Saturday Shares. I got the courage to ask for a badge as I read more and more about the positives of a sober life.  I then got the courage to post here as well.

I asked lots of questions. I got lots of advice.  I took a lot of the advice.  Now, 2 years later, I have a full toolbox that I use daily. I still see my therapist.  I try to exercise and meditate.  I attend recovery meetings.  I reach out to other sober people every day.  All of it helps me stay sober, one day at a time.

/r/stopdrinking is not the only page in my book, but it is the first page.  And I will always be filled with gratitude for everyone here.

Love to you all, my friends.

/u/NonnyMouse69 is organizing a lunch/meeting get together in Alexandria, VA on May 29, 2016. [Here are the details.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4hmqha/alexandria_va_dc_area_meetup_52916_mexican_food/)

About 2 years ago, /u/Nika65 expressed an interest in organizing an event in Chicago, and then proposed that October 13, 2014 be worldwide SD meetup day. How cool is that?? Maybe this idea deserves a resurrection!  What do you think, SD?

Do you want to organize an SD meetup in your neck of the woods? Go for it!  Any dauy will do!  :)

Here's how:

* First, [check to see](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=flair%3Aevent&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) if someone is already trying to organize an event in your city. If they are, you may want to attend that function rather than organizing another. Also check the comments on the post you're reading now to see if anyone has expressed an interest in organizing an event in your area. If they have, get in touch with them by replying to their comment or by sending a PM.

* OPTION ONE: If you are not yet ready to pick a date and time and instead just want to gauge interest, add a comment to this post that mentions your city and a proposed date/time/location.

* OPTION TWO: Pick a date &amp; time. Do a post. Include the city name and date in the post title. Including this info in the title will make it easier for people to track down events that interest them. Don't use a number for the month name, spell it out. After you do the post, [send the SD mods a modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fstopdrinking) that includes a link to your post. The mods will apply the ""Event"" tag to your post, and will add a link to your post in the ""Events"" section of the sidebar.

* Tip: Check the [SD Roll Call thread](http://www.reddit.com/2a0q20) to find others in your area. (This link also appears in the sidebar.) You may want to PM them to let them know you're organizing an event.

* After your event is completed, please send the mods a message letting them know that they should remove your link from the sidebar.

The mods will try to ""sticky"" event posts every so often in the weeks leading up to each event.

That sounds like a good plan, no? If you have any suggestions on how this procedure could be improved, comment below.

I loved it so much I haven't stopped thinking about it. And being the internet addicted Gen-Xer that I am, I came home and immediately googled it.  Not much came up (6 entries on the google list, which is CRAZY), but I did come across a site that had some really great stuff in it.  I am not linking it here - [we do have a rule on promotion in the sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_no_promotion) - but I've taken some of the good stuff and put it into my own words as best I could.

First off:
&gt; 
&gt; “I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.”
&gt; 
&gt; Henry David Thoreau

&gt; Walden

YES.  Right?  Damn.  Now I promise you this - a year and a half ago, I could have read that quote 30 times and gotten nothing out of it. But today, that shit speaks to me SO.  CLEARLY.  My entire outlook on life and why I am here has changed.  I DO wish to live deliberately; I wish to offer this world all I can and in exchange, I hope to gain a deeper love and appreciation for everyone and everything around me.  That, to me, is living.  It was not always like that, and I am eternally grateful for this change of perspective.

But there's more.  What was the problem with my perspective, and how did it get that way?  The author very thoughtfully laid out that our lives can become ""diseased"" in many ways.  Once we are sick, many of us begin to suffer heartily from a severe lack of physicality and vitality.  The author described that this can actually be seen by others as a physical and mental change: there is an epidemic of depression and collapsed body posture, the ""physical manifestation of defeat and resignation.""  

WHAT?  How much more could I relate to that?  As my alcohol abuse progressed, I grew more and more depressed, I gained more and more weight, and I PHYSICALLY lost all desire to stand up straight and face the world for what it was.  My life was slumped over in defeat.

The author continues to note that many people that are suffering see themselves as victims of life circumstance, and that they are simply reacting to stimuli to pass the time with “junk experience"" because they are lacking a sense of meaning and purpose.  I can ABSOLUTELY relate to that.  I had no purpose, or at least I felt that way - and I felt like my entire life was meaningless.  I often wondered ""what is the fucking POINT, life?"" I filled my hours with  mindless, time-killing activities that did absolutely nothing  to nourish my body and/or spirit. And just as the author stated, as my life became dominated by stress, fear, and uncertainty, my dependence on substances grew worse and I engaged in more and more anti-social behavior. My life on a good day was tolerated; it was never celebrated.

But today I do celebrate my life.  It's work, and some days are rougher than others for SURE, but overall - I am in a good place.  I face things today without nearly as much fear as I did in the past.  I do my best to be authentic.  I enjoy being creative again. I practice kindness, I engage, and I recognize the importance of dealing with life on life's terms.  It takes [all of the spokes](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54219318e4b0d739251a8f5e/55db5f6fe4b09a515110279b/55db5fb3e4b09a5151102c87/1440441127943/6-spoke-lifestyle-wheel.png) to turn the wheel, for me.

Like I said, some days are easier than others. Tomorrow I might wake up on the wrong side of the bed and it may take an act of Congress for me to muster up the energy to crack a smile at my dog, but today - right now - my perspective and my mind feel clear and focused. And for that, for the opportunity to have GLIMPSES of an amazing and peaceful life - I am grateful.

I am so excited to be able to share a little tip and trick that worked so well for me.  The great thing about this ""Tools Tuesday"" series is that we get to share what worked for us as individuals, and we have a *little* more leniency to promote our own way that worked (don't worry, I checked with the mods on that one).

So. I often get asked outside of SD (full disclosure - member of AA and card carrying couples/individual therapy appointment keeper, here) how I got past the first few weeks after the disappearance of the initial euphoria I got from simply not drinking.  **And I love the question, because I think it is one of the most important question one could ask.**  I'm happy to share what worked for me in the hopes it can help even one more person today.  :)

Before I quit drinking over 18 months ago (time flies when you're havin' fun, y'all!), I couldn't go more than a few days without drinking.  Once back in 2009 I quit drinking for 6 weeks, and I ended up in a huge blackout (TO CELEBRATE MY LONG TERM SOBRIETY, OF COURSE) that resulted in a pregnancy.  I did drink while pregnant, but it was the only time in my life I ever moderated.  So it's safe to say, I basically never actually moderated my drinking, and from the time I was 21 until I was over 35, I abused the shit out of alcohol and drank more often than not.

So when I quit, I knew it was gonna get REAL after a few weeks of abstaining.  And I knew I was going to start feeling like ""oh man, I have done so well, clearly I am not actually a problem drinker, I just need to moderate, and things will be FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINE, you'll see, me!""  I know myself pretty well, and I definitely know the truth about me when it comes to alcohol consumption.

I was attending AA and working with a therapist, but I didn't have an AA sponsor and I didn't really want to rush to get one.  I was perfectly content attending meetings and talking with people and listening to what they had to say. But I also, as a doer and a type A person, wanted to actually DO some work - homework, if you will.  So I got on the ole' google machine and started looking for advice and suggestions.

I pretty quickly found some really great [worksheets](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=aa%20step%201%20worksheets) that were exactly what I was looking for.  I knew that putting pen to paper would really help me to capture exactly how much I needed to stop drinking, for good, and I wanted that physical reminder for when I was having a case of the ""Buuuuuuttttttt, one glass won't hurt, right?  Or one drunk night a month?  Surely, that's what normal people do, right???""  

**I needed a reminder, and I needed to do some ACTION, bc my drunk brain can talk me into ANYTHING if I let it.**

So I reviewed all the worksheets I found, and I [downloaded my favorite](http://www.royy.com/step1.pdf).  I found them extremely easy to use, and VERY thorough.  I filled out the worksheets very clearly, and very thoroughly.  I told the truth on myself, and pushed through the shame and disappointment as I answered as honesty as I could.  And I filled.  Those.  PAGES, my friends.  I wrote and wrote and wrote until my hand was sore.  And when I was done writing, I read over all of it, and added even more.  And ya know what? It worked.  And even better - I now have a living document that I can review when my brain starts feeling drunk.  I even took pics of the pages with my phone so I would never have an excuse to not read my own words, from the heart, and be reminded of what alcohol does to me and my loved ones.  I refuse to forget, and this exercise makes that really easy for me to honor that commitment.

I have since shared them with other people in the rooms of AA, and even a few people here on SD.  Today, I share the worksheets and the process I followed that helped me get to where I am today.  I hope these help you, my friends. And if they don't, I hope I said something that helped you stay sober today.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
___________________________________________________
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It's another glorious, non-hungover, lovely ""stay home day"" in the ketojam household.  But in the interest of telling on myself, holding myself accountable, and sharing with others - I want to let you all know that I had a pretty shaky day on Friday.  And I got through it and stayed sober using a trick I learned right here on /r/stopdrinking, on Day ONE of my journey.

**Background and stuff:**

I spent all day Friday in the hospital.  Long story and lots of scary tests later, my partner needs brain surgery.  He's had it before, and it's gonna be fine - but it's stressful and scary all the same. There will be recovery time and weeks off work and just an overall change in routine.  Again, it is going to be OK - but of course I worry.

I went out to check the car and the spot I thought was 4 hours was 2 hours - and I missed the ticket gal by 4 minutes.  Obviously not a big deal, but also one of those ""oh come ON, are you frigging KIDDING ME with this day so far??"" moments.  

I saw people I used to work with in the hospital - people that had to deal with me while in active addiction.  They looked less than thrilled to see me.  Not the most pleasant of moments, :)

**The Temptation and the Racing Thoughts**

The tests my partner had to do required him to fast for 12 hours before the appt., and by the time he was getting ready to check out, both of us were ravenous.  He had an hour before he would officially be brought down and released, so he asked me to go find some sandwiches, have lunch and relax on my own, and meet him back at 3pm.  

*And here's where the shaky ground starts and the problems unfold....*

* HALT - I was hungry, angry (over the ticket and just generally stressed to the gills), lonely, and tired.  
* I had no plan.  I went off to find sandwiches....not in the hospital, but out in the city, alone, with my car....where all the bars are.  
* I had my phone and didn't call any sober friends.  I still struggle with reaching out with problems and feelings I have.  I would much rather help others than tell the truth on myself.  
* I started to feel ""entitled.""  I was already planning on how we would fight the ticket and SHAME the city over giving us a ticket while we were at the hospital bc HOW DARE THEY and RULES DON'T APPLY TO ME.  I ran 2 red lights while driving bc ""don't they know what kind of day I have had??""

So with all this going on and my head full of crazy, I stopped at a little restaurant/store in the city - a part of the city where we used to live, actually.  And where we used to party HARD, and buy drugs.  I walked through the store area - they sell some produce and lots of wine and beer and fancy packaged goods.  I spied LaCroix in the soda section, and while I gave the universe a fist bump, I continued to walk into the bar area.

I ordered my sandwiches - one to go, and one to eat in the restaurant.  Only there were no seats....except a few stools at the bar.  

I sat at the bar and waited for my food.  The bartender asked me what I wanted to drink. I asked for club soda - she said only beer and wine at the bar unless I go to the front and purchase something in a bottle or can.  As I pondered what I was going to do, I heard the words ""didn't you say you've been at the hospital all day?  Have a beer, girl!  ON ME.""

................

I thought about it.  I thought about how I was alone and no one would know.  I thought about how she was RIGHT. And it was FREE.  And I DESERVED IT.  And ""what if"" and ""how come"" and why me"" and all of that BULLSHIT.  And I played the tape forward.  I know what happens when I drink.  Could I have had just one at that bar?  Probably.  Could I have kept it a secret?  Most definitely.  Liars lie.  And I am a liar.  

But what would happen after that? I know what would happen.  I know what would happen because I have been there before a million times.  I would justify the next drink, and I would drink more that time.  I would then justify the isolation that comes when I drink. And the anger and resentments. And the acting out and the irresponsibility and the general disinterest in life.  I would be off to the active addiction races again.

And I would not be able to be the person I want to be today.  Because as my dear friend /u/finally_woken [says,](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/43kqb8/sunday_solutions_recognizing_and_refusing_my/) **""I can have drinking OR I can have the things that matter, I can't have both. I keep a hard line, I keep my wall fortified, I will not cross cross the line. My decision is already made - I will not drink, no matter what.""**

So I shook it off, rolled out to the case, and bought some LaCroix.  And I ate my sandwich at the bar, scrolled through SD and texted a slew of sober friends, and thanked the Universe for all of the awesome I have and will have, as long as I stay sober.  

And that's how I motherfucking [KILLED IT](http://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/61754330.jpg) this week, SD.

The time has come for me to pass the quote torch on to the next most excellent SDer.  I took this on a little over a year ago, and I am ready to give it up to a new, fresh voice.  This SD service position has been amazing for my sobriety, and I have enjoyed giving back this way in more ways than I can count.  But it's not meant to be a forever position, and it's simply not feasible to continue doing it with all of the other mod stuff I've got going on here.  So, all that being said, here is your chance, dear reader!

I took this job over when /u/i_noticed_you was [ready to give it up](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2qra9x/maybe_you_can_help_me_from_i_noticed_you/) after doing it faithfully, every single day, for 2 years. TWO WHOLE YEARS.  This guy is a beast, and he has the sobriety to prove it. 

So, here are the requirements and deetz:

The daily quote must go up every day.  The ideal time is at around 11pm the night BEFORE the day of the quote so we hit all of our time zones (for example, the Wednesday 2/1/16 quote should technically be up by 11pm EST Tuesday, 1/31/16).  

Doing the quote will take at least 15 minutes of your day.  Although much appreciated, the quote posting is often a ""thankless job"", as in it doesn't always generate a lot of upvotes and comments. You will get random downvotes for seemingly no reason, which can be a real punch in the gut after you've spent 15-20 minutes crafting something from the heart.  I am not telling you this to sway your opinion to ""NO"", I just want to be fully upfront about this.  

Posting daily will be inconvenient at times, and you must be consistent (have consistent access the SD daily). I was able to ask the community for coverage while on vacations, so consider that the flexibility for coverage may be available.

There is a basic format that should be followed; I will talk to you about it via PM once we get this underway.  Check out my submitted post history for deetz.

Now that all the business-y stuff is out of the way I will say this has been a rewarding opportunity for me. Even when times were crazy and my head was a whirlwind, this service position has helped me to carve out some sanity, give back to others in our sober world, and focus on my recovery.  The job is very much worth it. 

Thanks in advance, lovely SDers!  I am excited to see the responses!  :)

*What I get from it:*  I don't have 100% awesome days every day; far from it.  I don't always love my job, my family still makes me crazy, and other people and the great big world can definitely make me want to crawl into my bed and not come out for a few days.  I have days where although I don't drink, [I exhibit some pretty not great behavior and actions](https://img1.etsystatic.com/021/0/5282590/il_340x270.499446777_g9yz.jpg).  But the good news is that I'm becoming more aware of myself and how I live my own day to day life, and I'm working on being better for myself and others.  So, I try not to spend a lot of time beating myself up for what I didn't do great one day, and instead, I try to focus on the lessons I learned.  It's my own way of turning a negative (or a ""meh"") into a positive, which just [feels pretty terrific](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrI-UBIB8Jk) after a trying day.

I wanted to start a thread to see what methods and ACTIONS people are using to get and stay sober here on SD.  I think we will see a variety of different responses, and I am really excited to hear what's up in y'all's necks of the woods!

[Obligatory rules link](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index) before we get started.  :)

So, my quick contribution:

I started here, on SD.  I was already in therapy, but my rule was ""we are not going to talk about my drinking or my affairs"", bc I am a classy and honest broad.  ;)  Once here on SD, I was able to get some good advice and others shared their own experiences with me, and through that I realized I could probably go pretty far in sobriety if I reached out to my therapist and told her some tr00ths.  So I had my last drink on a Saturday night, posted and read almost all of SD on Sunday, and called my therapist on Monday.  I also attended an AA meeting on Monday.  I REALLY hated the thought of AA, but some kind and helpful folks on SD gently guided me to a place of willingness on that step.  I ended up really liking AA, so I stuck with it and am still attending today.  I also still attend therapy, have worked through my affairs with my partner, and actively contribute to SD.

*What I get from it:* So here's the thing about my drinking and the choice to get sober: I decided to quit entirely on my own. I had no ultimatums. People thought I drank too much, but no one was threatening me with demands that I quit. My job was fine, my bills were paid, my kid was alive and relatively happy, and my partner and I were miserable, but putting on a decent show. I honestly probably could have kept going longer than I did before the shit really started to pile up around me.  

But I didn't want to keep waiting for the DUI, or liver problems, or work issues, or the eventual separation from my partner. My [rock bottom](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/e9/34/2c/e9342c97bce1baac99ad1a15cd4e6a92.jpg) was emotional and mental and very real: the day I decided I was worth more than the way I was living was the day I decided to quit.  I had problems WELL before that day, and clear signs my drinking was problematic for years and years, but but it took me figuring out that [I deserved more](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/fd/79/5c/fd795cc4f69bd51f5c0c123108ccf608.jpg) than I was giving myself to [push me in the right direction,](http://www.brainyquote.com/photos/l/laotzu121075.jpg) finally.

And I am so glad I quit when I did, my friends. The [only regret](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1yslrwYOE1qexyyto1_500.jpg) I have about quitting drinking is that I waited so long to do it.

New Year's is actually a really nostalgic time for me.  Some of you know that I am a long time Phish phan, and New Year's shows and trips were a big huge part of my life for a really long time. I did a lot of partying back in those days - and not all of it was bad, of course, but it's just simply not the same life I live these days.  Was it hard to give that up? I mean, the fact is, the drunken, drug laced fun stopped long before I stopped going to shows and celebrating. My fun times turned into an addiction, and when I finally realized it, it was too late to fix it without stopping altogether.  I never saw it coming [until it was too late.](http://www.rd.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/oscar-quote-fsl-4.jpg)

But it turns out, it wasn't too late and I wasn't too far gone. I just needed to make some serious changes.  The life I lead now is different, sure - but it is absolutely still awesome and fun and exciting and all of the things that are great.  :)  And I have great memories and can still have a lot of fun sober.  Newcomers, stick around - you may find you have the same good fortune as myself and so many before me and beside me. 

This is one of my very faves - [enjoy!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkgwhc3cSh0) And Happy New Year, you giant bunch of awesome people!

But [spending my time](http://www.healthyplace.com/images/stories/insight/quotes/quote-on-anxiety-42-healthyplace.jpg) freaking out over things before they even happen only robs me of today's opportunities for happiness.

I thought it was absolutely perfect for this subreddit, especially on the night of the [new IRC launch!](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3vqj74/chat_relaunch_event_mon_dec_7_7_pm_11_pm_central/)

When I first joined SD, I was amazed and comforted by the amount of friendly, kind, supportive people [that ""got me""](http://quotespictures.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/the-initial-bond-is-the-shared-experience-lucy-macdonald.jpg) when I asked and talked about drinking.  I couldn't believe that other people shared some of the same feelings and experiences as I did, and that I could relate so much to strangers across the interwebz.  SD has made all the difference to me and my sobriety; [I can reach out and ask for help,](http://www.notable-quotes.com/f/friendship_quote.jpg) and then turn around and give help to others, all in the same few minutes.  I have made friends here, and they are friends that accept me, warts and all.  They not only accept me, but they GET ME.  And what more could I ask for?  

I'm a lucky gal, SD.  Thanks for being such an integral part of my journey! [All my love to each and every one of y'all!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJYXItns2ik)

And suddenly, the months had added up to a year and my life was nearly unrecognizable.  

[It's not necessary](https://laccrisblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/dontgiveup.jpg) to give up, folks.  It's totally possible to do this.  But to do it, I had to try like hell. And the results have been [nothing short of amazing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTa8U0Wa0q8)

*What I get from it:*  When I first got here, I wasn't sure I was going to *really* quit drinking.

I was ready to admit my life was a disaster, but I wasn't 100% ready to admit I was ""done for good.""  But as time went on, and as the days racked up and my life got easier, I realized more and more that it was the drinking that was destroying my life first and foremost, and I knew I was going to have to [accept](http://www.havingtime.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/expectations.jpg) that me and booze had to end our relationship.  

[I got help.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/af/44/b5/af44b507ca041d5aac63aa7297d6e1a2.jpg)  I tried lots of things that lots of people do to get sober, and I found a combination that worked for me.  I stuck with it.  I dug in, and didn't look back.  I spent a lot of time reviewing my past with alcohol, and the events that took place due to my drinking. And I started to burn the hell out of that bridge behind me.  The flame started off slow, but soon, it was a pretty big fire, and it got harder and harder for me to look back and consider drinking as an option.  I kicked alcohol to the curb, and now it is simply not a part of my life.  Recovery is, and sobriety is on my mind daily, but drinking is not.  And I'm grateful for that, and relatively at peace.

None of this is to say that I might not see another similar bridge ahead of me someday, and if I do, I will have a choice to make.  But that choice will be made with a head and heart full of knowledge, and [burning down that first bridge behind me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8Tiz6INF7I) has given me the strength and experience I need to dig in and continue to make the right choice, one day, and one step forward, at a time.

*Theme:* Compassion

**""Compassion asks us to go where it hurts, to enter into the places of pain, to share in brokenness, fear, confusion, and anguish. Compassion challenges us to cry out with those in misery, to mourn with those who are lonely, to weep with those in tears. Compassion requires us to be weak with the weak, vulnerable with the vulnerable, and powerless with the powerless. Compassion means full immersion in the condition of being human."" - [Henri Nouwen](http://www.values.com/inspirational-quotes/7415-compassion-asks-us-to-go-where-it-hurts-to)**

Check out [the newest](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3phvxx/announcing_rsdvermont/), set up by the incomparable /u/RufusMcCoot!

""What's a local SD sub?"", you ask?  Well, let me tell you whats going on here.

You've seen the roll call thread over there in the sidebar, where SD members announce their location, right? The purpose of that thread is to help SD'ers connect with one another in real life. That thread will tell you where others are, but it doesn't do much to help you connect with those folks. It's not a very good system.

Enter SD Local subs.
__________________________________________________________________________________
**The idea:** SD members will join SD, and will /also/ join their local SD sub. Support will continue to happen here on /r/stopdrinking. The local subs will be used primarily for relaying area-specific information, coordinating local events, and encouraging human-to-human contact. (Example: Anyone wanna get together to watch the game tonight?)

A few points worth mentioning.

* Each local sub is autonomous. The SD mods have nothing to do with these subs. They are each run, entirely, by whomever is listed in that sub's sidebar.

* Each of these subs will be operated ""in the same spirit"" as SD.

* To see some pros/cons of the idea, [check this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDLocal/comments/2i28eb/local_sd_subs_an_overview/)

**Who can start an SD local sub?**

You! (Maybe.)

We are relying on community members who see a need in their area to create and manage local subs on their own. This is your chance to get involved.

There are a couple of requirements, though. [Please read the entirety of this post to find out more about these requirements.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDLocal/comments/2i28eb/local_sd_subs_an_overview/)

It is in the community's best interests that these subs be created and operated by people who've been around for a while. A few months, at least. Nothing personal, n00bs, but you guys disappear. A lot. If you are interested in creating a local sub, please send a modmail to /r/SDLocal before doing so.

**Going Forward**

Once a number of these subs get up and running, we are going to stick a link in the sidebar, and we are going to start using the badge request process to bring these local subs to the attention of all new members. (The last page of this form will encourage the new member to join his or her local sub.)

**Summing up**

This is a bit of an experiment. There will be growing pains along the way. We'll figure it out as we go. Our hope is that the local subs project will help to make this big scary world a little less big and a lot less scary by bringing this community closer together.
We often tell new members that they're not in this alone. Let's prove it to them.

**More Information**

* [Here is list of SD Local Subs](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDLocal/comments/2i28eb/local_sd_subs_an_overview/). This list is not complete. There are a couple of subs in the works that are not yet listed.

I've spent my weekend doing mama stuff; we've finally secured a Halloween costume, and new shoes and markers were needed.  I ran some errands, saw some mom friends, hit some meetings, and visited parks in between cuddles, giggles, and sighs of frustration.  Parenting isn't always easy.  But it's always worth it.

At least it is these days.

I was drunk for the first few years of my son's life.  I was drunk when he was conceived, I white knuckled through a pregnancy drinking perfectly poured 4 ounce glasses of wine a few times a week, and then I desperately tried to moderate once he was out of me and attached to my breasts 12 hours a day.  I tried.  I tried and I promised myself I would succeed.  I really, truly thought I was fixed once I had a baby.

My son was 3 months old when I was back to drinking to blackout.  My son saw me asleep in strange places.  My son got baths from me while I was drunk, and I read countless stories to him with a vodka club by my side.  I drove over the legal limit with my son in the car more times than I can count.  

My son is almost 5 today.  He is beautiful.  He is smart.  He is funny.  He is kind.  He is loving. He is fun.  He adores me.  

He is so much like me.  Sometimes it scares me.

I won't stop working on recovery.  I did anything to get sober, and I will continue to do anything it takes to STAY sober.  I will not fail myself, or my son, ever again when it comes to alcohol.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LnMhy8kDiQ) is one of the most powerful things I have ever seen, and I have watched a lot of recovery stuff.  

I wish you all peace, love, and sobriety today.  ",stopdrinking,Sometimes things hit me so hard it actually hurts.,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3p954y/sometimes_things_hit_me_so_hard_it_actually_hurts/

I didn't get sober and stay sober for over a year by just throwing chance to the wind and hoping for the best.  This wasn't luck.  Hope wasn't enough.

*What I get from it:*  I used to really dread Sundays.  I would hate them from the second they started and slowly build into a total panicked frenzy all day until I was an absolute mess by Sunday night.  I would always try to drink less on Sundays, so I could be ""on"" for work on Monday. It never worked.  Even if I drank less, I was always going through minor withdrawals Sunday night into Monday morning, and my sleep was so garbage and pretty non-existent that Monday always ended up being awful.  It was such a [terrible, vicious cycle](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/5f/52/9d/5f529d7be4d1db2c265ef69c800fdcbd.jpg) that I still don't know how I lived through it week after week, year after year for as long as I did.

[It's so not like that for me anymore!](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/04/4c/4a/044c4aa79457e6340403d3253b8810e5.jpg)  I love Sundays and I so look forward to them and their simple loveliness.  I always sleep in just a bit; my son crawls into bed with us by about 7am, and we all doze until close to 8.  Then my son and I head downstairs to make coffee and breakfast and have quiet time together.  Sometimes we run around and do errands or fun stuff or a combo of both; sometimes we just relax.  There are always lots of hugs and laughs.  And these days, [not only is that enough](http://quotepixel.com/images/quotes/life/quote-about-life_9514-1.png) - it's [everything.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QJIW5tyg9U)

When I quit drinking, [I was negative about everything,](http://www.quotestags.com/qitem.php?id=550984) had zero gratitude, was a total cynic, hated everyone, and was so full of fear and paranoia that I was pretty convinced someone was bugging my office at work (there was no reason for this to be a logical thought of mine).

I was really starting to worry about my mental and emotional state.  

I have none of that anymore.  I have some fear, and some anxiety, sure - but it is absolutely manageable, and dare I say - NORMAL.  [I have belief in life again.](http://www.brainyquote.com/photos/w/williamjames101061.jpg)  I believe in myself.

*What I get from it:*  At first I read this one, and didn't get it in relation to my drinking. And then it hit me!  When I first started drinking, I DID get pleasure out of it. Then it stopped working as well or in the same manner that it once had, and I drank to keep going after that pleasure.  [Then I drank because it was habit.](http://blog.zerodean.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/all-bad-habits-start-slowly-zig-ziglar.gif)  Then finally, I drank because I couldn't not drink.

And the only way to stop thinking about alcohol was to stop drinking alcohol - and to [replace my thoughts](http://www.brainyquote.com/photos/n/normanvincentpeale130593.jpg) with thinking about my sobriety.

How this relates to alcohol for me, is that up until the very end, I was desperate to get pleasure from alcohol - even though drinking really hadn't been pleasant for a very long time.  And alcohol had not only stopped being pleasant, but it was getting really painful, and causing a lot of problems in my life.  Finally, at some point, it got more important for me to STOP THE PAIN than to try to make alcohol ""work"" again.  And that was the best decision I ever made.

Today I was able to take my son to a birthday party for one of his friends.  This may not seem like a huge deal to most people, but for a long time, I wasn't able to handle a task like this.  The hangover and the crippling anxiety I would have when I had to deal with other people in a non-drinking setting was a lot for my head and heart to handle.  If I was able to get through it, the celebratory blackout afterwards was sure to negate any of the good I did during the day.

[And that took practice.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/34/13/a5/3413a5cd42f3d8827fc90e2be731d8ce.jpg)  It took doing it even thought I didn't want to.

[As you may have seen already,](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3ia97s/badges/) things are getting busier here on SD - this is a great thing, and I love all the new people and badges!  On a personal level, I'm headed out on vacation in a few short weeks and to be honest, my social life and family obligation calendar is pretty full these days.  One of the benefits of getting sober has been getting my life back; it's a pretty great thing, and I am certainly not complaining.  Anyway, I was kicking around the idea of sharing the opportunity to do the daily quotes with members of the community.  I am not ready to give them up entirely - I enjoy doing them and it's an awesome way to give back to this great place that pretty literally helped save my life.  But I would love to give other interested parties the opportunity to help in the same fashion.  

So what do y'all think?  Would you like to do a quote or 2 over the next few weeks/months?  Let me know in the comments!  And thanks for all of your support - I love you, SD!

I can help my family, I can help at work, I can smile at a stranger on the street.  I can give directions without being bothered by the loss of one stinking minute of my life.  I can practice patience on line at the grocery store, and I can get over it quickly and calmly when someone steals a parking spot in the lot.

I was perfectly happy upstairs in our bedroom, watching terrible Lifetime movies and going into a LaCroix blackout. When they left, I came downstairs to smoke a cigarette and put my glass in the dishwasher and cans in the recycling bin.

I saw beer cans in the recycling bin.  No big deal at all, I thought.  Then I went inside and grabbed some glasses from the living room to put in the dishwasher.  I saw some clear liquid in one, and without giving it a second thought, I stuck my nose in the glass and inhaled deeply.  I smelled nothing but water, but **I realized in that instant that had I smelled vodka, I had no idea whether or not I would have drank the remaining half inch of liquid in that glass.**  Basically, I didn't plan on sniffing, I did it anyway, and then I had no plan on what to do if I had indeed smelled booze.  I was completely unprepared and left planless and defenseless.

HUGE eye opener for me.  Crazy huge.  I learned some things and now I have a few more ways to be more diligent.  I learned that if it truly doesn't matter that people are drinking around me, then I have no reason whatsofuckingever to be smelling their glasses.  And that if it DOES bother me that they are drinking around me, then I have to be more honest with myself about that and plan accordingly.  I learned that I can't ever get too confident.  Between this incident and last week when I was offered wine to taste and I honestly wondered for a moment whether or not a ""taste"" counted as a drink - well, I have learned that seriously, I have to remain ever vigilant.  I can NOT be too confident.  I have to remember who I am and where I am, and what alcohol is for a gal like me.  

You guys are the first peeps I have shared this with.  I don't know if it helps any of you, or if any of you have any experience with this, but it helped me to get it off my chest and out in the world.  

Keep fighting the good fight, friends.  And thanks for being awesome and a part of my life.

He's been at this since he was 17, and he is 31 now.  He's been to rehab 5 times, maybe more, and has been both active and very inactive in AA and other recovery programs.  He has strung together stints of sobriety up to 2+ years for the past 14 years.  He's changed his locations, he has changed jobs, he has changed friends, he has changed various other aspects of his life.  And he still goes out, lately, every year, pretty much on the nose.  

His relapses are very sad.  he locks himself up in his room or place of residence and has vodka and takeout delivered or he takes cabs.  Once he took a cab in his underwear and then came home and pissed everywhere.  My mom has found him walking around her house, naked and talking to himself and others no one can see.  There's a lot more than alcohol abuse suspected; he's gay, had a really rough go of it in high school because he was outed by ""friends,"" and has never really dealt with that pain.  Everyone close to him including past therapists and doctors suspect underlying, untreated mental illness.  It's not an excuse I am making, but I think it plays into the difficulties he has staying sober.

My parents are enablers.  My sister is...I don't know what to call her, but she's not doing herself or her own sweet little family any favors by being involved in this.  She has a little boy who needs her and a husband who has had it with my side of the family.  

I live far away and I have since this all started back when he was in high school.  It is so very strange now to be on the side of the fence where the grass really is greener.  I LOVE sobriety.  I love it here.  I love love LOVE talking with you all daily, doing the quotes, and making and resetting badges.  i even love banning douchebags who make this place unsafe for all of you trying to get better.  I love therapy, I love recovery meetings.  I love the self-work that has been integral in my recovery these past almost 11 months.  

I hate seeing someone struggle, someone I love so much, and someone who has seen the benefits of not using and being honest.  It's sad.  It's scary.  It's something I have absolutely zero control over and that I have to accept.  

I'm not asking advice or what to do - I know there are other subs and meetings more suited for that.  But I do just want to say to all of you - hang on to the sobriety you have.  Get through today.  Get through today so tomorrow is a little easier.  If you're on a pink cloud right now, ride the ever loving FUCK out of it so the next time you're feeling blue, you've got some good memories.  Just hang in there, and when you think you can't anymore, hang in a little more.  Reach out.  Let someone know you're in pain.  you never know where a kind hand and heart may pull you up from the bottom you're in at that moment.

Just wanted to ask a few quick questions:

My partner has been to many, many doctors all over our area, and they have finally decided to treat him as if he has MS, although they still aren't totally sure after many years of visits and tests and symptoms.  He gets an MRI or 2 a year and has no legions on the brain. But he DOES have 7 oligoclanal bands in the CSF.  

Has anyone else experienced this?  They are treating him as if he has PPMS, and continuing to watch for brain lesions.  He is on a number of meds, and he walks with a cane and has a lot of balance  problems.  He also has issues with the entire lower trunk.  He is also on meds for seizures, but they think that is more tied to scar tissue in the brain from the aneurysm he had at 16. Do any of you have seizures?

Sorry to throw up so many questions on you.  Just feeling like after  10 years since the first symptoms that I am FINALLY getting to a point of acceptance, and I am reaching out just to gain some knowledge and support from others.

I would have done some of it, and then bitched about it and everyone around me, including myself, would have been miserable.  But today?  Today I loved it.

I had the OPPORTUNITY to go shopping for food with money I earned at a job I like and then I came home to a house I like and hung out with my family whom I adore and made delicious food for friends.  I had the PRIVILEGE of putting my sweet child to bed and was able to read him books I was lucky enough to borrow from our awesome library and he went to sleep feeling safe and loved.

I didn't realize any of this until the end of my drinking, but because I was suffering from so much self-hatred, all of my relationships were also suffering.  I went through life [blaming absolutely anyone else](http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/quotes/1377800641p8/524099.jpg) besides me, and at the end, it was becoming really clear that 99% of my problems were because of me, myself, and I.

I am nowhere close to being ""cured"" of self-hatred; this is something I am going to have to work at, actively, for a long time, I imagine.  But things are definitely better.

I even do it for the small, seemingly insignificant stuff. If someone asks me to go out and I don't want to, I tell the truth, tactfully.  If I forget to do something or mess something up at work, I come clean right away and do what I can to right the situation.

And to be perfectly honest with you all, I don't always succeed every day in sobriety and living a peaceful and joyous existence.

The good news is that [I get to try again every day, over and over and over again](https://quotesbywomen.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/mary-pickford-jpeg.jpg?w=670&amp;h=497) if I need to.  I can make a shitty decision and treat someone I love not so great, and I can apologize and do better the next moment without letting it ruin the entire day.  I can cut someone off in traffic or react poorly when someone does the same to me, and I get a chance to be kind to someone else a moment or so later to make up for my crappy behavior.  Sometimes I lose patience with my family or my job; but [there's always room afterward](http://static1.quoteswave.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Do-the-best-you-can-until-you-know.jpg?03d4a8) for an apology, a hug, and a kind word to another person.

It's a [pretty awesome cycle,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WF5m59gy1P8) to be honest.

*Theme:* Determination

**""I believe success is achieved by ordinary people with extraordinary determination."" - [Zig Ziglar](http://www.values.com/inspirational-quotes/7313-i-believe-success-is-achieved-by-ordinary)**

*What I get from it:* For years and years and years, I tried to get my drinking shit together.  I tried to moderate, I tried to drink less, I tried to only drink on certain days, I tried to only drink certain things, I tried to only have a certain amount of drinks, etc., etc., etc.  None of this worked for me, and I couldn't figure out why.  I assumed it was because I didn't have the willpower necessary to do it, that I wasn't strong enough.  [But that wasn't my problem.](http://www.brainyquote.com/photos/g/gordonbhinckley404070.jpg)  My problem was that I wasn't WILLING to do it.  I wasn't [willing](http://quotepixel.com/images/quotes/inspirational/wall-quotes_14825-1.png) to do whatever it took, every day, to not take that first drink.  I wasn't ready. 

I'm glad I got there.  Finally, after years of making my life worse, day after day, I sat myself down, kicked my own ass a little bit, and [got determined](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/ce/89/89/ce8989a8e0a217ed8caacf81ebca23bd.jpg) to accept the case as it was and through that determination, I became willing to do whatever it took to quit.  And like the quote says, I am an ordinary old person.  I am not equipped with any kind of superpowers and I am no stronger than anyone else here.  But [determination and a willingness to try](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/82/62/5c/82625cca874cd00e4df33af2b732c4a3.jpg) anything got me, finally, to where I am today.

And I will use the same skills to [do it again tomorrow.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sil76t2X_DE)

*What I get from it:* Short, sweet, and to the point tonight, my friends.  [This is something](http://www.verybestquotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Positive-thinking-quotes-You-cannot-stop-the-waves-but-you-can-learn-to-surf..jpg) I have to remember every day.  My mind can be a real pain in my ass.  Drinking so excessively, for so many, many years brought me to a [pretty low place](http://www.favething.com/uploads/images/main-fave-images/negativity_quote-1.jpg) and kept me in that low mindset day in and day out, year after year.  If I am not mindful and appreciative and if I don't actively work to practice [gratitude and kindness](http://inspiremetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Quote-Gratitude-kindness.jpg) to myself and others, it is really easy for me to slip back into that negative line of thinking.  And when I am hating on myself and others, then I am hating on life, and it is all that much harder for me to be productive in my sobriety. So I work hard to remain positive and I start my day over 100 times if I need to.  Here's to a positive [tomorrow!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONd4qSs5B5k)

I let him know that I am nowhere near complete in that regard, and that life and happiness and contentment and gratitude are things I [struggle with](http://www.sheristaak.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/quote-struggle-231x300.jpg) every.

I'm learning that just because I gave up drinking, my life is not going to be a rainbow covered lollipop field in the sunshine.  And that's where my real growth is coming.  Now that I have put down the glass, I get the opportunity to learn how to live life and deal with all of life's bullshit.

*What I get from it:* [Life is hard.](http://img.picturequotes.com/2/6/5473/life-is-hard-after-all-it-kills-you-quote-1.jpg)  Sobriety can be hard at times, especially in the beginning or when life gets extra challenging.  This is why I start every day the same, and have for over 9 months.  Every single day I remind myself that no matter what happens - whether I win the lottery and inherit a zoo and a castle, or if everyone around me turns to stone and I am left alone with a bunch of spiders in the apocalypse - [my decision to NOT DRINK](https://meetville.com/images/quotes/Quotation-Sara-J-Henry-decision-right-Meetville-Quotes-106055.jpg) remains the decision, period, all day long until I fall asleep.  And then with luck, I get to do it again the next day.

I have done a lot of things and accomplished some stuff in my life, but I promise you - I didn't know what [dogged persistence](https://meetville.com/images/quotes/Quotation-Greg-Kincaid-love-endurance-practice-labor-inspirational-christmas-persistence-Meetville-Quotes-9698.jpg) meant until I quit drinking.

*What I get from it:* Oh man, did I need to read this today. Well, to be fair, I probably needed to read it from the second I could read and then I should have printed it out and laminated it so I could read it every morning as soon as I woke up, but hey - better late than never, right?

[Selfishness](http://refe99.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/12392-selfishness-is-not-living-as-one-wishes-to-live-it-is-asking-2.png) is something that comes very naturally to me, so being [selfless](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/bf/c1/64/bfc1645b6ce8a88d7c8805ac17c28316.jpg) is something I pretty much know nothing about and have to work on actively every day. I don't always succeed and to be honest, I don't always like trying. But I'm working on it, especially for the sake of my son and partner. The fact is that I drank to excess and behaved pretty badly for a very long time. I left a lot of damage in my wake. I hurt my family and friends and co-workers a lot and I have a long way to go to set things right with them, if I even can do that.  [And I can't right my wrongs overnight.](http://izquotes.com/quotes-pictures/quote-healing-is-a-matter-of-time-but-it-is-sometimes-also-a-matter-of-opportunity-hippocrates-85655.jpg)  I learned, and those around me learned by default, to behave in certain ways as a response to my alcohol use and dependence. So after all those years of being selfish and caring only about my wants and needs, I owe it to them to try to act with some grace and selflessness and get some truth from their perspective.  I mean, it would be great if everything was perfect and worked in my favor now that I am not drinking, and I wish that were the case - believe me - but I still have so much work to do.  And I owe it to those that loved me while I was abusing myself and them to work hard to see the [whole truth.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFScoO4tb0)

I didn't choose to be an alcoholic; this certainly isn't the hard life work I thought I would be doing had you asked me 10 years ago where I saw myself in a decade.  But I'm doing it, because it's worth it - and I'm going to do my best to do it with as much [grace and positivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj9Sv1JpmPs) as possible.
