&gt;Except the fact that Strikers are undoubtedly the most powerful subclass that Titans have and it's kind of ridiculous. 

Why is it ridiculous? Because hammers were nerfed into the ground when they came out and the bubble isn't as strong as the tether class or self Rez?


&gt;Forget other classes for a second, and just look at what Strikers do that the other subclasses of Titans CAN'T: 

You can't look at one class in a bubble. If you did, every subclass the hunters have looks op. Why does the blade dancer get QuickDraw? Why does the tether get damaging, slowing, ticking smoke?


&gt;Lighting Nade (x2 if you use the stupid artifact for it): You leave anyone 1 hit from any weapon. 

It leaves you with 78 health depending on your armor. That's one hand cannon headshot or multiple bodies from anything else. And no one is using the artifact to lose the slam. 


&gt;Super that makes your practically invulnerable: Why? 

No. I get shot gunned out of it all the time. Plus: it's supposed to be a hard counter. That's what it does.


&gt;A super that hits people that aren't even touching the ground or sometimes even around walls.

Yeah, it attacks in a huge aoe. That's how aoe works. 


&gt;Shoulder Charge and Jugg that charges even if you are jumping: Again. Why?

Because it's proc'd off holding the sprint button. Why do you get to shadestep away from tracking nades? Why can you revive yourself? Have a 30 foot melee?


&gt;Faster sprinting speed: Add the Dune's and you get EVEN FASTER, a better turn radius, AND move speed while ADS. That's like 3 - 4 different Hunter exotics packed into one... 

Hunters have radiant dance machines. Warlocks have a pair of gloves that give them like 3 weapon handling buffs. Hunters can be granted a shoulder charge tier ability for free with the helmet. 



&gt;I could keep going, but I need time in my day to do other things. To say that Titans are ""so far behind other classes and keep getting taken away from"" is because Bungie keeps fucking up the Titan class. They took all the power from Sunbreakers and gave it to by far the most cancerous subclass in the game. What did you expect to happen?

293,"The absolute biggest advice I can give after over a dozen hours in that fight is this: **Be nimble but don't over extend if you cause wipes doing it.**

Start off by knowing who's empowered where, who's cannon-bro and who's going to *stay in place and throw that bomb.* If someone continually doesn't call out their empowerment, you might as well kick them because you won't move forward.

The biggest amount of wipes, IMO, come from someone screwing up their part, and someone else over extending (or failing to) to make up for it.

If you can't kill your captain within a few seconds of the engagement, call it out. If you can't throw your charge for whatever reason YELL IT OUT. If you're taking too much damage, back off and let everyone know what you can't handle. More often than not the boss will teleport and someone still empowered will stand next to him. MOVE. 

Last night we finally stopped wiping for silly reasons when we split up the 370+ equally on each side, I took over captain killing for right and middle and just directed traffic. Sometimes it helps if one voice does all the servitor call outs, where bombs need to be thrown, etc too.

When last nights boss fight was over I had killed 2 captains on every teleport run, did 4.3 million damage (double the next guy) and had absolutely played air traffic controller the entire time. This is key for struggling groups, especially in LFGs because everyone thinks they are either a hero or a scrub. I was only 375, but it was obvious within a few runs who can handle pressure and bonus jobs and who can't, roll with that.

*""Shall not be infringed.""* straight and to the point.

421,"There's a HUGE problem with loot right now, and it's 100% linked to the three day raid turn over. 

Normally, you'd say ""ok, I need to go from 335 to 370+, I'll do some bounties, some crucible, maybe some trials and I'll get some loot and be good.""

No. There's not enough time if you want to do the raid the opening weekend let alone opening day. You need to gain almost 40 light to compete (I know, I know, some did it at a lower light. Great for you) in any real means. 

So what do we do? We farm Omnigul, we farm the same tired strikes, we farm court for a gamble at Eris. That's not fun. It's not smart design. 

What they should have done was wait until the following Friday, a week and a half, to release the raid. People would be able to get a trials in, because it wouldn't be held back, they'd be able to start iron banner, if it's released tomorrow and they'd be able to explore and level at their own pace in a variety of activities. But that didn't happen so everyone had to optimize efficiency. Not fun. 

Also, I always prop up this idea I had: old hard raids need to give half a vanguard level each week. This lets people level up quickly and efficiently and broadens the scope of relevant content.

1) why was the bar over his neck and not chest? That's an imbalance he should have fixed (pushing up and back instead of just up). If he used suicide grip... Well. 

2) if someone drops 200+ pounds at freefall (suicide grip is called that for a reason) there's nothing you could do to catch it. Seriously, if he dropped the weight from free fall it's not your fault, even though it's your fault you weren't paying attention.

In the gym, accidents happen. You need to be attentive but you can't take personal responsibility for life and death, or grievance injury even, if he himself wasn't safe with the lift. ",2016-09-23 14:55:12+00:00,d7ywo6z,1.0,t3_544esu,9289.0,tifu

I almost had to fight a guy one time, the worst altercation, after we hit his *screen* three times with skittles but he sat down when my 6 friends stood up. We tried being nice, being loud, and finally we had to use the threat of violence to get this prick to put his phone away.

Once, this bitch had the audacity to use her CAMERA flash multiple times to shut a baby up she had with her. She was late, so she sat in the very front. It lit this place up like a nuke went off. I went down there and said ""can you not be such a cunt, people payed for this. A whole theater full actually."" She laughed at me and continued. I'll go pretty far, but I'm not assaulting a woman with a baby. Eventually a woman near her cussed her out and she stopped.

621,"I don't understand their thoughts here: nerf shoulder charge because an artifact will break it, rather than break the interaction between the skill and artifact.

Without armamentarium, and speed(also nerfed, twice, with garrison and skating), the Striker Titan is what it now is: the shortest melee(with poor hit detection because I just missed in a rumble game over this hunters shoulder, what?), single grenade class that has no support abilities. Transfusion only works with its short melee and shoulder charge. Both are so risky to engage in, the health regen isn't worth it.

They did this with the first hammer nerf: nerf the health so they couldn't survive a one shot sniper round but now ALL high armor supers, almost all roaming supers, can survive one. 

Bungie's balance teams needs to ask players, not developers, what would balance these classes. You gave hunters a slowing/damaging smoke, a hard counter to shoulder charge. You gave warlocks back their burn nades, and max armor builds, a hard counter to shoulder charge. Every fucking shotgun in the game can one shot a Titan shoulder charging. Hell, I can't think of a single scenario where a shoulder charging Titan has the upper hand now, unless the other player is not paying attention because now the hit detection is so bad he can literally just jump. That's right, I jumped straight up last second and dodged a shoulder charge. After he activated it.

So I ask: what is the strikers job now? Run jugg and shotgun until they nerf that? The artificial will break jugg the same way, unless the cool down op found is present there too.

After playing 5 rumble games with my striker I'm so fucking salty right now. ",2016-09-11 16:24:03+00:00,d7ib19h,1.0,t3_52954c,1495.0,CruciblePlaybook

796,"There are 19 weeks left. If you lose slightly more than 2 lbs a week you can make it!

2lbs = 7,000 calories. So that's 1,000 a day each week that have to be cut or burned. 

Take your weight and subtract the extra fat over your lean body mass:

Say you're 200 and want to find your lean body mass. If you're a guy, you need to get about ~10% for washboard(girls is 15-20). If you go into a gym and say ""I would like a body fat test"" they'll do it if you listen to their sales pitch. So let's say they tell you ""your body fat is 35%""

Great, using our numbers you want 10% so you need to lose 25% of your weight. 25% of 200 is 50. Boom. Lean body mass is 150!

If your lean body mass is 150, you need protein to keep it lean and build muscle as you cut. Girls need .8g protein and guys need 1g per pound of **lean body mass*. In our example that is 150 grams of protein for a guy. 

So!

Calories: you need to lose weight, so you need to burn fat. Fat contains 3500 calories per pound. 2lbs a week requires 1,000 a day. 500 from diet, 500 from exercise. So let's say you haven't gained any weight, or lost any, on a 2,000 calorie diet. Subtract your 500 and bam! A pound a week. Weigh yourself at the end of the first week of strict calorie counting for proof. If you didn't lose weight, subtract 200 more. That could be as slow as 1200 without Doctor supervision. You still need your protein though and the lower you go, the harder and more expensive it'll be to get!

Now, for workouts. Jogging on a treadmill barely burns off a small candy bar per hour. Get on the rowing machine or stair master and haul ass. The rule of thumb for your heart rate fat loss zone is 220-age. An easier way to do it on the fly? Sing to yourself mid hauling ass. Do you need to pant to get the words out? Great. No? Faster! Calories leave the body in three ways, excrement, sweat and co2. Two of those are controlled by how fast you move, so move! Combine that with weight training and you will look better in 2-3 months. Unless you're a monster, you'll be jacked in a year of strict counting and 3-4 days a week of work.

**Striker vs stormcaller**

*Grenades*
Titan with Lightning Grenade. 
*Melee*
Stormcaller before and after the boost
*Super*
Stormcaller because of its ""mini smash"", range and ionic blink. Not to mention extended duration with perk equipped. 
*Passives*
Shoulder Charge because it's a OHK on every class but max armor warlocks and Titans. Jugg is only OP if you add a shotgun, by the right so is ""web"". 
*Mobility*
Titans for speed. Warlocks for height and ""hanging"" unexpectedly. Slightly Titan. 

Overall kill ability: 

Warlock with Ram, extended range and shotgun absolutely trumps jugg because you have to sprint with abandon for it to work. Shoulder charge is hit or miss if the team is using the meta (universal or party Crasher.) and the meta makes the warlock melee range worse.

With the prevalence of juggernaut, no back up plans and warlock 15 foot melee's, it's easy to see why shotguns, nerfed 3 times over, are still the primary of choice. 

The reason the 1k stare is over represented is because it was given to everyone for an easy quest reward.

The belt designed to handle 4,000 packages handles 10,000 on a slow night. On Christmas, it's triple stacked and it doesn't slow down. The pick offs have to grab, read, decide which chute to put it in at a walking pace belt stacked 3 high and 3 deep. The emergency stop is the only thing that saves them and we get yelled at for pushing it. 

That, and every half baked shipper uses a single piece of tape and barely any packing. As soon as the packages start backing up the heavier ones crush the lighter ones. Our loaders are required to assess, scan and safely load at over 300 packages per hour; If something is miss-sorted that takes time off the top. If the box is opening, or spilling, that's time off the top. Now imagine 14 packages are open on the side, waiting to be repacked when someone gets a breath. Some don't have shipping documents, so we have no idea what you ordered. Some have no packing, some have unidentifiable liquids that potentially could be hazardous to us and some are just plain jacked up. We have to fix all that while the belt burns to the ground.

Ship your packages like you're going to stand on them, because most of the time that's the duress they are in unless they are small and compact.",2016-07-18 20:19:55+00:00,d5h8o2u,1.0,t3_4tfol1,17925.0,funny

The only problem?

-Cars aren't in the constitution. 
-Licenses are accepted in every state, concealed carry permits are not.
-You don't need a background check to buy a car.
-Cars kill more people than guns, and there are enough guns to give to every man woman and child in the country. 
-My 350z has 270 horsepower and can blow past most stock cars doing 150mph but my Glock 17 is limited to 10 rounds.
-If you put 19"" wheels and a spoiler on your civic, they don't ban it under the title ""assault vehicle.""
-You're not limited to how much gas you can put in it.
-If you have 5 cars people think you're well off, if you have 5 guns people think you're a lunatic.
-If someone steals your car and runs a bunch of people over, it's the thief's fault. If someone steals my gun and kills a bunch of people I'll see you in the newspaper.

**Double action** - trigger does two things, firing and resetting. (Also revolver)
**Semi-auto** - one pew per trigger pull. Bullet gases reset the gun.(Pretty much every rifle and handgun that isn't a revolver or bolt action.)
**Full auto** - entire mag if one so chooses, per trigger pull. Bullet gasses reset the gun. (No one in the United States that isn't extremely special can own one)

Before I go further:

I'm a personal trainer, long time fitness freak and someone that's lost 40lbs in two months to get abs. I love this shit and I hate frauds.

Firstly: an hour on the elliptical is around ~500 calories for an obese person, at the level they could likely run it. As they lose weight they will burn less calories as time goes on unless the intensity is fucking cranked. If that person trains with carbs in their system they'll lose even less weight. 

Secondly: the last 5 lbs I lost (45 now) from 180-175 took 3 weeks. The last few pounds always do. In that picture the dude looks JACKED with years of muscle on him. He sure as hell didn't cut with that kind of mass. It takes 2+ YEARS to put on more than dozen pounds of muscle unless you're juicing or have some godly genetics. 

Thirdly: Quit your bullshit. 100 pounds a year is a lot but very doable at 2 lbs a week. Even then you run risk of loose skin. This guy is a fraud. ",2016-05-31 16:08:47+00:00,d3qipfs,2.0,t1_d3qamkq,13137.0,quityourbullshit

Whatever they want. The whole dynamic changes and you're no longer the weird guy, you're adventurous and fun. Sure, it might be a shit donut, but whatever.

The BEST thing you can do is act. Act now. Go to a gym, get in the pool, YouTube ""foam rolling"" for the cramps and take caffeine and bananas for the cramps. Don't let big weights scare you, you won't ""get big"" without high test. Most guys can't get big lifting heavy. 

80% of your goal will be hit in the kitchen. Get a calorie count app, record you daily intake(normal intake) and subtract 500 per day for the first week. If you see yourself losing, stay there. If not, drop again, all the way to up to 13-1400 calories. Anything less than that needs to be Doctor certified. Keep your protien high, carbs and fat low. .8-1 g of protein per pound of *lean body mass* you want.  

And what's a ""shit ton"" of water? You should be trying to drink almost a gallon a day.

Compile them in upload studio, add transitions and intros, trim out the bullshit and you're good. X1 can only have 26 clips and transitions/intros per video so you'd have to save it, and then bring it into another session if you go over. 

Pro tips I've found are: keep similar maps together to avoid transitions and listen for audio cues like ""heavy ammo inbound"" and use them to transition to a heavy round. 

Like my pocket infinity heavy kill at the end here:https://youtu.be/l4ySEqpn-14

Or my ""white gear only"" heavy transition, audio from one, with another clip after it. You can't merge audio, but it looks like you did. https://youtu.be/JYGZwpVWzak

We should probably ban flare guns because they can be modified into a gun. Don't forget the Home Depot tools, like pipe, black powder and hinges. Because they also can be made into a gun with a 2 minute Google search.

""That’s where the meme comes in. The count that fuels it comes from a crowdsourced database, shootingtracker.com, that seeks to list every incident in which at least four people were hit by bullets — killed, wounded or grazed.

In Texas, the shootingtracker site lists 21 “mass shootings” in 2015. Almost all fall into sadly mundane categories: domestic violence, gang conflicts, battles over a girl, robberies gone bad, drug-related arguments, fights that ended in gunplay.

My diner makes a $3.00 bacon egg and cheese twice the size of any bacon egg and cheese mcd dreams up and currently the mcd version is $4 and change. There's problem one. You cant tell me McD can't figure out a $3 bacon egg and cheese because the duchess chain has a 2 for $4 and its massive and fresh.

Problem two is in the simple fact that there is no dollar menu anymore, prices have skyrocketed and wages have stayed the same. I don't go to mcd for a $5 burger. Bring back the dollar menu in full force, don't tell me they don't have purchasing power. Most mcd's are completely mismanaged. 

Problem three is that I save only s few minutes going to mcd over calling into a local burger joint or diner so time isn't an issue. 


To summarize: to compete you need to go fast and dirty, not slow and expensive. Automate and keep a barebones staff, that performs at $15 an hour (people forget that a raise in price raises the employee talent pool) and shut down these towns with 4 fucking McDonald's. A faster, more competent and properly paid staff will destroy a slow and cheap staff, making up some of those ""lost wages"" with less thrown away food, fucked up orders or call outs fucking the whole kitchen.

2884,"At one point, I had so many hours into year one it was embarrassing. When I found out that most of the good exotics and gear in year 2 were just rehashes of year 1 I kinda fell off. I used to play all three characters doing every single nightfall and raid... Now I barely play one character, stopped doing nightfalls altogether and have only done the hard raid twice. It's just not worth raiding for infusion fuel. This whole concept of doing trials and the raid to infuse other weapons is fucking stupid and I hate it. 

So, here's why I barely play anymore:

-The best gear from year one trumps year two.

-Infusing every damn 280 drop with raid and trials gear is the worst part of Destiny. Not to mention the weapon part drought or how long it takes to level up an armor now. I want max gear with every drop, we already have to find perfect rolls and level them up. 

-Nightfall doesn't give a rep boost, so I'm not doing it. The weekly? Ha. No. I used to only do it with the rep boost and exp boost.

-Trials is a nightmare on one character now, let alone 3. I used to go the the lighthouse 3-4 times a week, since it came out I haven't been once because of two disconnects at 8-0 (seriously, I never get DC'd. This new system is shit) and the amount of amazing players at 8 my team just cant beat. I've been 8-0 a half dozen times now. Let's not even talk about no more strategy with the boons, having to buy them all in the beginning.

-The raid is so reliant on everyone being perfect, it's a nightmare to LFG it. Let's not talk about how bad most of the drops are, and the monster range they have to drop at.

2897,"This is normal for s game. Most AAA titles are only played for a few months now because the quality of other games coming out is so high. That doesn't mean Destiny is bad or that the weapon part drought completely killed the game. 

I like CoD zombies, they are back so I'm going to play them. I like messing around in GTA, so I'm going to play that. I also like Trials so I'm going to play that. I'm not going to consistently grind the daily and even nightfall, because I already have everything I want, and 200 legendary marks. I'm not going to raid every week on 3 characters anymore, because is not needed and I'll be damned if I'm going to save up 3x infusion fodder because of this ridiculous 280-320 mess of weapon drops. It's not that they made the grind harder, it's that year one gear was so much better, and dropped at max level. I've just settled on average shit now. Who's using any of the new Titan exotics? -crickets- The only thing remotely usable in trials now is the Crest. The only thing usable in pve is the Saint 14 and ruin wings. They didn't do a damn thing to freshen year two. What's my go to weapons? A high impact sniper, like last year, and a two burst pulse rifle or the last word. Like last year. Hell, my favorite gun, the pocket infinity, was still slapping people in trials and pvp so I just use that when I'm not sniping. 

Destiny is stale. Sure, the Halloween event and random exotic quests are nice, but there is no innovation. The grind didn't kill this game, the fact that my year one experience couldn't be improved upon did. VoG is still the best raid experience. Year one trials felt rewarding, this year punishes even above average players with a 50% loss rate at 8-0, and no thought in boons forcing them bought game 1. The exotics in year two are laughably bad unless you're a warlock (yay, landfall and Taloc!) The re-skinned drops from normal to hard mode in the raid, and year one to two in trials is lazy. Still no matchmaking for old content is silly, because guess what refreshing an LFG page looking for people is: random. Mics always off by default completely put the nail in the year two coffin for me(I know, this sub hates mics. I get downvotes every day for that opinion). Content is just not fun in silence and not enough old friends play to allow me to get my team together. Imagine CoD zombies silent. Or Heists silent. Hell, how much fun would it be to have patrols with mics on?

Destiny has to embrace competitive play, stop catering to ""soft, casual players"" and push hard for new content in a way that doesn't make me feel like I have to play for a straight week to get one drop. At this pace, playing a few hours a week not only is optimal, but it just feels better. ",2015-11-09 11:48:08+00:00,cwtz46x,1.0,t3_3s31jg,32840.0,DestinyTheGame

Everyone is butthurt all the sudden now that Titans can go offensive with their supers instead of reactive/defensive. 

First of all, excluding the bug, Titans don't get 8 hammers. Maybe 5.

Second, unless someone is close/we have on the tracking perk, it's hard to hit a moving, jumping target at 100 feet. Not so much with a golden gun.

Thirdly, Golden guns kill Titans in their super btw. As does every other offensive super.

Fourth, stop trying to take on supers with your primary.

Fifth, the aoe isn't that large. Not as large as the ""landfall"" one hit KO *activation* of the arc warlock super, that blinds nearby enemies if they don't die.

Self Rez. Viking Funeral with tracking. That is all. It's not a pvp super either.

Arc warlock is unkillable by anything but a sniper or another super with that range (let's not talk about triple the Titans melee range).

I'll say it again: supers should be super. You shouldn't be able to counter them, accept with another super. The blast radius on Hammer is just right, and without the ""altered flight path"" perk, you can't always hit what you're aiming at. 

Give the super a few weeks to play all the way out. Even if it shakes out to be the best super for this meta, is that a huge problem?

-Prioritize head shots
-Follow people around and steal/clean up kills.
-Take off TLW as a last ditch effort if you don't have a super, heavy or the enemy has both heavies.

Here is where we held, here is where we will be erased... This is our story in physical form so our triumph, and demise, may not be forgotten.

The Templar fell, and we descended into the abyss. When we landed on the bottom we saw them floating around the cave. We called them Gorgons because of their tendrils, resembling snakes, that drifted as they moved. They glowed with an eerie hue that transcended color and made noises that resembled electronic hum.

Our Hunter was nearly caught roaming for an exit until I turned and dropped a rocket into the beast and charged with my shotgun. It disappeared in an electronic scream and that's when we knew we had to kill them all to escape. We walked through the vault, killing each one, growing ever stronger as they fell, until there was none left, or so we thought. Like nightmare fuel they came back, one by one, oblivious of their past demise. 

Our fearless leader devised a plan, based on the fact that they were all a single organism. If any one of them were alive, they could all be reborn. We set about our plan to destroy them all at once. We noticed once we destroyed them, they stopped respawning with shields. We split up and loaded our best weapons. On his count, we downed 6 of them in a flurry of rockets and buckshot. 6 down, 2 left. We split up and rallied on each, dumping the last of our munitions in them. 

Then silence. 

Nothing happened. We waited. Nothing. Until the hum returned...

They came back, like nothing happened. They took half of us... The other half are broken, out of ammo... Hiding for what seems like days... Or months... Out of time. Literally.

3530,"**1: Big man with gun pointed directly at 2 people just a few feet away. No one notices, no one cares.**

Have you ever seen the video where people are playing basketball in two different colored outfits? You are asked to count the passes between one team and miss that there is a fucking bear in the shot? The reporter had zero peripheral vision (move your hand slowly on the side of your head, when does it disappear?). The person being reported on initially saw the suspect, with no gun, and blocked him out continuing the conversation. He could have pulled his dick out and she wouldn't have noticed.

**2: After clearly pointing gun at his victims, shooter doesn’t shoot.**

Notice that he waits to be on live television, the camera is panning for a wide angle shot of the surroundings. He notices and waits, astonished no one saw him there by his hands double take.

**3: Cameraman conveniently pointing camera away even though the interview is taking place now.**

Do you not watch the news? They always cut frame. Same reason YouTube videos cut every few seconds, the viewer loses interest. Plus, the lady was talking about how beautiful the area was.

**4: Shooter is close to cameraman who somehow has no idea he’s there.**

He has one eye closed and is filming. He's also probably used to people crowding his shots. Ever heard someone yell ""fuck her in the pussy"" on TV? Same idea. Whether or not they know they have company, they don't drop the camera. 

**5: How did gunman know they were filming that day, that location?**

This was my initial question, and it was answered by the local news: not only is it talked about the day before, she was live on location for a while. He had plenty of time to make it over.

**6: Reporter never goes down or twitches after being shot multiple times.**

If you're not familiar with firearms, let me help(I'm an avid shooter, student of self defense and have seen plenty of real killings on /r/watchpeopledie (don't click that.) Unless you shoot them in the vertical area defined by their spine and head, people can take bullets and keep moving. Peopl don't fall down like the movies unless they have a wound so large it causes CNS failure, pain takes over (you see this on cop dash cams, minimal wound and the suspect goes down) or they are shot in the head/spine. Good question tho.

With the AK47 round, it's a high speed rifle round. Ever see a watermelon get shot by a rifle? It doesn't fall over, it explodes/has a neat entry and huge exit wound.

**7: Shooter commits the usual suicide.**

Most mass killers don't want to make it out alive, hence the manifestos. They don't intend to be alive to tell it. 

**8: Shooter puts out the usual manifesto.**

see above. Suicidal people tend to leave them, especially when the reason for the deed is grandiose. 

**9: Video of shooting seems intended exclusively for shock value, no other purpose.**

That's exactly what it was for. He waited until she was live, said bitch under his breath and uploaded it immediately to social media. It was absolutely to shock and awe. 

**10: Video conveniently now being censored by YouTube Charlie Hebdo and James Foley style.**

YouTube aggressively takes down death content. Most are hosted on liveleak.com instead.

**11: Image of shooter produced by a video without such frame?**

reddit had this frame before the media did... So. Yeah. They originally thought he was wearing a mask because of the quality. Ha. 

**12: Audio file of shooting after camera cuts off sounds very different.**

It starts to echo in his footage because it lasts longer and he is actively shooting under the area you see in the video. 

**13: Police order BBC journalist to [delete](http://www.activistpost.com/2015/08/police-order-bbc-journalists-to-delete-footage-of-virginia-shooters-car-crash.html) video footage of shooter’s crash.**

Not sure about this, probably because they didn't want to create a Princess Diana Moment. 

**14: Family members quickly on TV calling for [gun control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=15&amp;amp;v=nzxNpArEtnA), Sandy Hook style**

they just had their family murdered on live TV. They were probably watching it live. I don't blame them for being reactionary immediately.

**15: Andy Parker, alleged father of murdered reporter happens to be a former Broadway actor.**

and one of the guys on the train to Paris was an actor too. People have jobs, plenty of people act/do commercials/pr/etc. not even remotely interesting.

**16: Andy Parker, Director of Human Resources for Virginia National bank**

He is HR, who cares? He helps people choose insurance and handles day to day employee needs. 

**17: White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, rolls out direct propaganda.**

of course they do, it's Obama's admittedly biggest failure. They want more gun control, because they are democrats. Pretty simple shit. They will push it anywhere they can. 

**18: Obama administration quickly links the incident to a [race war](http://www.infowars.com/white-house-pushes-race-war-then-blames-guns-for-flanagans-race-war/) and gun owners, perfectly in line with Flanagan’s manifesto.**

It was a race war though... He said Dylan roof inspired him. You don't think the White House got word of that manifesto immediately from democrat run ABC news?

**19: Shooting takes place 2 days after the UN Arms Trade Treaty in Mexico.**

this is reaching. I'm willing to bet, every week somewhere in the world there is a meeting, conference of whatever on gun control. 

In summary, don't be an asshole. This isn't a false flag dude.

3721,"It's a pretty simple thought process: whatever is easier to ""feel"" against. 

Obviously when someone uses a weapon to hunt down an animal, the Hunter is the monster. Even if the Hunter intends to eat and make use of the animal, super markets are a thing! Why would the need to kill? The weapon is yet a tool for a rich white man to use. 

When a poor, violent, or mentally ill person uses a gun to kill a human we can't get the same ""feeling"" out of hating the person. We know the person is evil, everyone agrees but no one knows how to fix ""poor"" and ""mentally ill."" They do, however, know how to fix that black scary rifle that seems to have no legit purpose to exist but to kill babies. Even though rifles are probably the least used weapon in any murder in the country. 

Everyone knows that Chicago is the murder capital of the free world, but minority gang member and minority gang member violence doesn't provoke ""the feels."" Someone stabs Freeman's kid and it's all about the bloodline. The perp and the weapon are an afterthought.

-Became good friends, then best friends. Got kind of flirty, but we were 1200 miles apart so there it stayed that way for 12 years. 12 fucking years of daily texts and monthly calls.

-Spent an amazing day and a half together. Zoo, bars, sights, friends. Found out while drunk she didn't ""feel anything romantic"" when I asked her to spend the second night with me in the hotel. She left, I cried in my hotel till I fell asleep, like a bitch. Booked an early flight for for a hundred extra the next day and only talk on birthdays and Christmas now.

3759,"ex-belt supervisor here for a major shipper. Maybe they had brown as one of their colors. 

The sheer fact that you get your package is amazing. I worked on the highest volume belt in my building, 11,000 plus packages a night(in an ancient building built for half that), minimum. People load 300 packages an hour minimum, in a truck that can be 100 degrees in the summer, or the belt will fall apart. The belt never turns off unless we hit an emergency stop. Imagine a fast check out girl, that's the speed packages come through, back to back. Sometimes, if we get a jam, they are stacked two or three high. Now imagine that same checkout girl, with only one 10 minute break that starts when the bell rings, and the belt goes back on at 10 minutes exactly, dealing with a jam at the beginning of the shift. It never stops, it never slows down. And we only service 10 bays, about 8 main hub locations. 

Now factor in if someone calls out, too bad. You're a man down now, and supervisors are picking off. Someone wants a bathroom break? Man down. Now you have the secondary supervisor stop writing hub slips, stop doing quality control and stop keeping up with safety so he can load (which is against Union regulations, and he will get chewed out for it.)

So you spend 5 hours like that. Men down, a conveyor belt at walking speed, packages back to back, stacked two deep and 2-3 sideways. 

Packages start to crush each other, we have to walk across packages to break jams(sorry guys) that are literally destroying merchandise, and we do the best we can to wrap everything in tape and pray no one sends a jersey package to California. 

So... Your package is late when it's 14 miles away? Deliver it yourself and thank god it isn't in pieces. UPS has an ever increasing number to hit and they are going to hit it. 

And I was just one step above loader. I had 4 bosses that would bend me over if we went an hour over plan.

""The natural right"" argument is just as you said. Man-made. Man made up any rights he wishes to have, there is no ""right"" of any organism to self defense, they either do or they are food. Rights, are made up by intelligent thinking beings. Just as creators are made up.

Rational thinking intelligent beings know all men are not equal. Some are smarter, faster, stronger and the like, that's why we protect the weaker of our species. If we were all equal, we wouldn't have to.

""Equal"" is another human invention. Animals don't share this line of thinking. Some are pack leaders, some are hunters and drones. None are equal. 

To put this in the most basic terms: there are no such things as rights. We made them up, and we can redefine them at any time. You have the basic instinct to protect yourself, and part of society believes you should be able to do that with any technology at your disposal. The other half doesn't want you to have ANY means to hurt another human being. The middle ground is where civilized and rational people meet. 

If you believe in God, a creator or some magical thread that binds humans together called ""rights"", that's up to you. The rest of us have to make sure the next pissed off psychopath with a history of violence doesn't just walk into Walmart a spree shooter. I believe that the founding fathers would see the ease at which a country with more guns than people would go bad, and they would take steps to secure its citizens safety.

So I go to buy my first gun, another Background check. Wanted ammo for my birthday, no one can buy ammo with a pistol permit, including hunters who now need a separate ammo permit. Yay, gift cards.

Now I have a magazine limit of 10, in my standard capacity 17 round gun, and if I open carry in public, which is legal, I can have happen to me that happened to Scott Lazirik. He was terry stopped simply because he was carrying, hr was tired of being stopped all day so he refused to show his permit without them telling him what law he broke (can't be stopped for legally open carrying, that's not breaking the law.). They sent him to court and he lost his permit.

We have plenty of laws on the books. I was background checked 3 fucking times before I bought my first gun. Guess what, most guns used in crimes are stolen, including the ones used in sandy hook. So, I say, what other fucking laws do you want?

And whether I have used my gun in self defense? I hope I never have to. I hope you never have to defend yourself either. ",2015-07-30 17:58:57+00:00,ctlsh6k,5.0,t1_ctlpxc6,3462.0,bestof
3910,"The problem with that is that handguns are the primary means of self defense as far as firearms go in this country. Some states, mine included, have magazine bans in place that have literally done nothing since their passing. 

That shooter that shot up the movie theater recently? He was using a 10 round magazine. Should we nerf it to 7 now? 5? Ban handguns altogether?

We need to enforce existing laws harder. No more ""17 felony"" news stories. Why are law abiding gun owners, the ones with the cleanest criminal records, treated like ticking timebombs of mass murder? They say ""you may go off at any time, and now a gun is involved."" We aren't murder machines. I've carried a knife on me since I was 16, I haven't stabbed anyone in 13 years and I've been in some heated arguments. It's almost like I'm a rational thinking human being, who is capable of walking away. 

The TL;DR version is this: enforce the laws you have before you enact some new ones. I'm sick of having to check the state laws every few months to make sure you idiots didn't turn me into a felon because I choose to exercise a basic human right.",2015-07-30 16:26:12+00:00,ctlof7m,3.0,t1_ctlnbby,1592.0,bestof

-The video demonstrates open 6 o'clock carry. This is a highly unpopular way to do things. 

-The armed individuals were untrained, and the bad guys flinched and generally fucked off before their targets, it will go down much faster.

-Open carry is going to be faster then concealed because of the barriers you have to defeat.

-Without one in the chamber, you'll lose every time anyway.

-Practice using a gun with a safety and it won't add much to the time if you go that route.

-Most engagements are well within 21 feet.

-You're taking the knife one way or the other.  Bullets don't kick bad guys back like in the movies.

Every mass shooting that happens, he takes a defensive ""holier than thou"" stance. ""Americans will have to deal with their choices."" He wants us to be more like Australia, which has more gun crime now than ever, albeit less crazy people shooting things up. The facts are that not a single law could have stopped the Sandy Hook shooter (his guns were legally purchased by a family member he killed to get), the crazy violence in cities with super strict gun control laws or the more recent Charleston shooter, who passed a background check he shouldn't have (or if you believe the other line, had a straw purchase done for him. Either way, illegal under current law.) He takes a very ""tow the party line"" stance on gun control in the wakes of an uprising of attacks by lone wolf crazies, and disturbed people. 

He promised that people could keep their doctors and plans, and that hasn't exactly panned out. What do you think happens when you put millions more people into a service industry without thousands more servers? 

His stance of whistleblowers.

His inability to press hard on radical Islam, the only real enemy since Al Queda worthy of suiting up for war against.

His stance on immigration is leading to some serious problems in the south, albeit I have no idea how to fix it.

There's a few more, but I can't remember them and guessing about facts won't help. Is he a good president? Sure, if you have very liberal views he is great.

I'm glad you chose to exercise the letter of the law. I don't agree with you, but you can do whatever you want. 

Here in my town, if they run your license your permit will come up. While its legal to not inform, imagine that cop just walked back to his car and now he finds out you're possibly armed. Start off the confrontation by handing him your license AND permit. Let him figure it out and ask about it. It's kind, curious and respectful. He doesn't know you, neither of you have earned the others trust yet.

4121,"""Fuck off, I like guns."" - Jim Jefferies

While I do like guns, it's tough to compare the U.S. to Norway (which is obviously what these posts circle jerk into). Norway has a population of 5 million, the U.S. 300 million. The U.S. has almost as many guns as it does people, it's part of our heritage and upbringing. It's rooted in our DNA to take defense of self and the state into our own hands, for better or worse (I refer you to /r/DGU). I agree that it also attributes to more gun crime, and that's unfortunate, but I direct you to places like Vernont. They have constitutional carry and near zero mass shootings and gun crime. 

Now of course places like Plano, Texas ""gun capital of the world"" has practically nil gun crime as well. Places like heavily restricted NY, NJ and Detroit drag the rest of our numbers up. (http://youtu.be/pELwCqz2JfE). What does that tell us? Is it a population density thing or a poverty thing. Well, in the heavily impoverished south, you don't see a ton of gun crime either... So what is it?

At the end of the day, no one wants to mention the elephant in the room, and that's impoverished minorities account for more crime in the U.S. than most developed countries put together. I don't know how to fix that, and apparently neither does the government. It's at a point now where welfare is the only thing stopping a complete breakdown of society. Lose the entitlement programs and there will be blood in the streets as poor people won't be equipped to feed their families, leading to violence, looting and murder like you've never seen. 

""I don't have a gun to impose my will on others, I have a gun so others can't oppose their will on me.""

I urge you to look at states with a lax gun control system and compare their violent crime rate to heavily gun control areas. It's shocking and telling and I'm sorry if that comes off as racist...",2015-07-08 11:44:09+00:00,csw2tnq,1.0,t3_3chq90,41104.0,worldnews

""The reddit community is a small portion...""

No. It isn't. At all. 

It's the most vocal, loyal and active player base the game has. It has more regulars browsing and playing then the Bungie forums when you take out their clan forum/meet up forum. (We have /r/fire teams too.)

Reddit is consistently talked about when Bungie mentions listening to us, and frequently it's put before their own forums in conversation. 

Stop downplaying how huge this community is to the game. If they want the steam to travel into TTK, they need to placate the LOYAL AND ACTIVE fan base, not the casuals.

And to address weapon balancing: it's already broken. Taking the thorn down a notch by removing Send It, and putting ARs back to their former glory does not need to be ""carefully tested.""

I am telling you in all sincerity that if you give me access to a gas can and a lighter with some chains or maybe a car, I can cause historic levels of body counts. Anyone could. A rented uhual truck hitting a crowd at a parade doing 40 can rack up more kills. Imagine one of the black pride rallies being rammed by a car. I'm sure this kid had access to a car. What if this kid did some internet research and built a few pipe bombs and put them on a train? Parked a stolen car full of gas and propane tanks under a bridge during rush hour?

4416,"So you keep your first elemental staff in Elder scrolls? Your first set of class specific junk armor in Diablo? You must keep those potions of minor healing around....

Get over it, pick and choose what gets saved. I had a huge assortment of weapons and armor I'll never fucking use, and most of it is on the character I'm actually playing. My vault is half full of weapons, has one set of armor and is about 90% full of items. Now that things stack higher, we don't need Crota mats or even ascendant, I've condensed everything way down. There's more room than I'll ever need. I didn't save the Khostov, or the shitty Murmur. Or the niche stranger's rifle. They are just a means to get me to stuff I care about, and overall useless to my God-killing level 34 Titan. I don't save my baby shoes, and middle school jacket either. 

**TLW** People who want more vault space are retarded and must have never played a character building type game. There's always a cap and no one ever saves this much shit. Hell, usually we have a weight cap we have to worry about too. No way to carry 4 pistols 6 shotguns and 4 rocket launchers.
