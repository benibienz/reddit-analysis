We got him down to a sliver of health on run 3 and he died immediately after the first slam possibly from slam damage. He moved up top and we did not get the challenge completion after killing him. This happened to us twice now.

This has to be a bug, because him moving to spawn without a teleport to even cover with empowerment, shouldn't cause a challenge to be fucked. It didn't do it in Golgoroth if man 6 died for example, you could just kill him in the first 5 orbs.

The activation range is seriously worse than any melee auto aim. It's impossible to activate offensively unless you cheese against a wall and it doesn't even kill two entire classes of characters right now if they run max armor.

Titan Melee does too much damage. OP. 

There is only one combination that makes titans remotely good right now and that's titan+shotgun. That's it. You can't charge a fusion while running jugg, you don't have extended melee or tracking nades and we don't get QuickDraw or overpowered exotics that give us reload speed for everything and double tracking nades that get buffed or what have you. 

We are a shell of our former selves and Supremacy is magnifying the problems with shotgun+jugg. I hate jugg, personally, I was a shoulder charge guy. I can barely play striker now without getting hate messages. Do you see the whombo combo? Do you see the melee range on an electric warlock who just mapped you with matador? Have any idea what double, buffed, tracking grenades from the warlocks and hunters do? Blink? Shadestep?

Please stop nerfing everything a titan does good while you continue to add to other classes.  Take a step back and examine the field right now. It's a mess.

When the dust settles can we talk about those wonderful shotguns? I really enjoy fusions, but I don't really enjoy people bouncing around the map like its call of duty playing ""warrior"" because it's one of the only viable styles of play now. 

I know, plenty of people will hate on this; especially those who aren't great at PvP and shotguns let them compete. But we can't let one archetype of one weapon type control an entire playlist. 

My recommendation is that you eliminate the high impact tier of shotguns and move them to mid/low impact. That will put shotguns in a decent place and allow fusions to flourish a bit more. I shouldn't have to find a god roll fusion to compete with the bottom of the barrel high impact shotguns. We can at least agree that something needs to be done, regardless of what it is.

If SIVA gets control of our weapons, it can finish off the traveler, and therefore the city without ever stepping foot back on the battlefield for the wall.

Totally inaccurate at any decent range so ""spraying"" enemies down is a terrible idea. In PvE, it's a fun niche thing to hold an auto until everyone is dead, but we already have one that does that (Zhalo) and it has a burn, gives you super and is predictable in PvP. We also have a pulse that does it(juju), gives you more super and is relatively *ok* in casual pvp. The Fabian is not good unless your opponent has no thumbs, is dutifully watching a heavy ammo spawn or otherwise is going to make dinner. 

The Immobius does not even seem to have enough range to consistently one shot people IN A BUBBLE, let alone running around. I provide two videos below of range in which a party Crasher, matador or conspiracy would destroy you, and considering the Titan has the shortest cleanup melee range... Lastly its main perk is so situational it might as well be the old ""exhumed"", this is unfortunate for Titans looking to join the still piercer/""Voop"" nation.

Is there any way we can have a discussion with deej, Bungie or the crucible gods on *actually* making these Titan specific guns worth playing with? I get that it's not a OHK class of shotgun, but if that's the case, why is it Titan specific? The worst class to follow up with a melee?

**TL;DR** - don't use Titan specific weapons. 

As an aside I will give you a buff for each weapon  in which I believe will make these weapons worth using. 

Frontlines - ""When firing the Fabian from the hip, juggernaut activates as long as the trigger is held down and not zoomed in. 10 second cool down."" It's exotic, it's intriguing, it's risk reward as this weapon is bad enough ADS

Immobius - No weapon tuning but the intrinsic perk now reads ""Your Titan melee is always active while this shotgun is equipped."" It is niche, it pairs well with no backup plans and it might see some use in this meta, but not enough (defender) to do anything crazy.

How do we fix this without nerfing yet more shit? Here's some ideas:

Currently the ""5 kill streak"" bonus is 25 points, I believe bumping this to a full kill 100 point drop would encourage slower, more methodical play and temper shotgun trade-fests on a race to kill, instead of a race for a good KD ratio. This would mostly effect control, clash and rumble. 

The iron banner is an absolute special weapon monster. You have hard scopers on shores of time trying to control C spawn and shotgun rushers trying to keep choke points violent. One of the top offenders that push this kind of play are the bounties ""get top overall in a game"" ""get top 3"". There is no bonus to playing slow with primaries if you want top 3. I recommend you change these bounties to KD ratio. 

Cut special weapon kill points by a third. 

Make universal remote use special ammo in PvP only.

With the news Xbox players are not getting exclusives into fall 2017 we can extrapolate one key piece of data no one was sure about:

All our gear, characters and things will move forward into year 2. 

If deej is confirming when these things will become available, and it's at the release of the next major disc for destiny, we will be keeping all our hoarded shit. Maybe not light level enabled, but if we are unlocking them in fall 2017 it wouldn't make sense to lose everything else from previous installments. Nor would it make sense to do anything of worth in July 2017. I know mainly this was discussed on planet destiny's podcast. Some of them were hoping we'd have a complete wipe. I think this confirms that won't happen.

So enjoy that year 7 pocket infinity baby! I know I will. (Still salty it's not back yet for trials.)

-edit- a lot of people saying the same damn thing. I don't believe there was going to be a wipe, it was a moderately high portion of the hardcore community that thought it. My little Sherlock Holmes moment merely suggests it's unlikely at best, retarded at worst to hand out exclusives and then wipe characters and start over in destiny 2. Unbunch your panties and put down your pitchforks.

You registered your firearm on form B17-1AS, in triplicate, as your forefathers had to since the Clinton 8 year term. All firearms needed to be accounted for at all times, so if they were stolen the owner could be punished to the extent of the crime committed with it.

You just turned 27, the minimum age to apply for the weapon was 25 so you've only had 2 years with the gun, now you're finally allowed to carry in your personal vehicle and the ever shrinking amount of businesses that allow it.

You only own a single handgun, because rifles were found to be unnecessary in the creeping city limits that have pushed out most rural areas and guns are taxed just like cars, and you can't afford another bill in this economic climate.

It's a 6 round revolver because semi-automatic weapons have been outlawed after a second mass murder of school children. This banned every gun that wasn't a bolt action, pump action or revolver. Anything over 10 rounds was also banned, so revolvers were left untouched in that regard.

It's a .380 because every other caliber has been outlawed. It has a biometric firing pin, so only the owner can use it which can't be activated with gloves or paint or any kind of dirt on your hands, so many tradesman don't carry at work.

You go for the mandatory monthly training in the only place in your state that holds it. It's 1 hour away and there's a line out the door, not too far though because many people couldn't take that Tuesday off and it's only held on Tuesdays. Maybe you'll be able to shoot before they close. Maybe. 

You load the ammo you bought when your number is called, the ammo thats been taxed to $2 a round. A mandatory 50 shots have to be taken to qualify and you do without issue. This is your practice time and fun time so you took your time because you can't afford anymore anmo every month.

You unload the weapon when you pass. Another month in the books, a book that you have to keep showing the time and date of the training. Of course the state keeps them too, but a half dozen or so have been ""lost"" revoking permits, and you don't want that to happen. Training: month 24, the page reads.

You take out the cylinder and slip it into its separate box. You throw that box in the trunk and lock the frame under your seat because you can't travel with a loaded, functional firearm until the results are sent to the mayor for signing.

You bring the weapon home and lock it in its safe that detects your biometric signature and that your weapon is inside, as an alarm would sound if the weapon was not stowed away within 3 minutes. 

Later on you take it out to clean it, the phone rings within a minute. ""What's your emergency?"" Says the dispatcher. ""No emergency, I'm just cleaning my gun."" You say. ""Ok sir, your 20 minute cleaning time starts at the beep. Please have the weapon returned before the time is up or you will have a strike on your permit and an officer will be dispatched to your location.""

You stare at your self defense firearm for a few minutes... 10% of your allotted time... and wonder if it's worth the hassle anymore. So many other people have opted to not bother.

I'm a beta player here in Destiny and I've been topping off my grimoire for a few weeks. I just finished doubles and I'm onto my last crucible one: FFA. I know MTashed recently told me to practice there to up my game, and I was excited to break the 1.2 rut I've been in for **17 years**(roughly my gaming career)

I have 28/100 grimoire and it seems like almost all of those wins were a year ago. I try and do the whole, ""pick a corner of the map, try and shoot first, prime with nades, etc"" but I think it's just gun skill at this point. So many times I come out of s gunfight raging with ""phantom bullets!"" Or ""how am I supposed to shogun melee when the warlock and Hunter beat me at range?"" It seems like the player pool is super concentrated with people that are much better than I am. Or at least more consistent. 

It feels like my Titan is so under-prepared for 1v1 close quarters that I find it hard to keep streaks rolling. Sure, I can shoulder charge, until they use UR. Sure, I can zone with lightnings, but most times they either run off or they blink through and Jack me up. My pitiful melee swings air 9 times out of 10 in cleanup engagements and my sunbreaker melee seems to punt them 10 feet away. 

Any advice for a Titan to compete with the ever growing meta of nova blinkers and wombo combos? As a team I can hold my own and cover, on my own I'm barely 50/50.

Secondly, Crest of Alpha Lupi will drop one more orb per kill. Group enemies as tightly as possible and nova/striker/blade dance. 

Nova bombs should be using shatter+annihilate. Strikers should be using aftermath+aftershock. Blade dancers should be using razors edge+encore.

We had just came off an 8-0 card where one of us was disconnected before the game started and we lost. The card before that was red bar after red bar around 6 wins. It's been an unusually grindy week of trials with some of the best competition I've ever played since Trials even came out, our cards being 7-1, 8-1, 8-1 as a team that week.

A little backstory: I'm a lighthouse veteran, but by no means a top player at 1.2 KD and I've been hunting the Scarab for months now, losing hope it'd ever drop for me in the 2-4 games I can win after 9-0. These two gentleman are two of my top guys and best friends, but they couldn't get flawless all weekend when they went without me on a few trips, one of which I wanted to play too but they just filled up. I pop on LFG to get my Titan a run in and I actually got flawless rather quickly with a Canadian and guy on the other side of the US while they failed. It didn't feel right so I stayed up last night on a work night to get them there too. 

Let me set the fucking scene:

There we were again. Two of us already flawless after a 5-4 sweat-fest at game 8 but one guy was a game behind because he didn't pop his boons on the first game, having to reset his card. He promised ""a broken Xbox and flat screen"" if we got it and he didn't but he promised if we did, he'd do a scarab farming run for me in another futile attempt at the rarest thing in Destiny.

We have no mercy left a round after wasting a Golden Gun getting smashed by one of three super-ready Striker Titans who were now winning...

4-2.

They come rushing left at 20 seconds for the zone after a round of plinking and dodging from inside to outside. One of them drops to pulse rifle fire, but not before he trades a shoulder charge with our super-ready Hunter. They pick off my other friend in the fray and it's 2v1 with me at 50% on the point using the mayhem to try and cap. I start spamming Hawkmoon at the two charging Titans, who come at me like an old karate movie, one at a time. Headshot miss headshot body shot. Headshot headshot bodyshot. Half way through my mag and my health...

4-3

We go outside for zone control, hiding and head glitching the whole round while they stayed inside, peaking and faux-flanking. The Titans come rushing out at 10 seconds, each ready to panic at a moments notice and or cap. I pop one in the face with a sniper round, before his friend gets me being greedy. Another goes down by a trip mine and the third is killed in his super animation rushing down my huddled-together friends. 

4-4.

My Self Rez is back and one of our Golden Guns. The Titans aren't taking our shit this time and come charging down the right lane immediately. We snipe one, and one of us goes down at the bottom heavy. It's 2v2 in a scramble to make it 3v2. Both teams get their guy up and our Golden Gun get popped. Bang. Bang. Two down, 3v1 the Titan rushes with the shittiest super drop I've ever seen and I just float away gracefully, picking him off with hawk moon shots.

5-4. Titans can't self Rez, we got the last of us flawless too. End game rewards pop up, blue, blue, mote... Scarab. I lost my shit, we all did, and ended our trials weekend with sighs of relief and laughter. 

I love you, Destiny. Sometimes, love to hate, but mostly love.

*Six of them speak lies, tell you I am not here. One of the blind tells the truth. She does not consort with the warden if pleased. Only someone so vain will find flattery in mockery. This is where I wait. Please return to me.""*

*""I arrived Friday""* is past tense. It makes no sense when it's followed by *""You visit me on Saturday night.""* which is future tense. There is no day in between the two, obviously, therefore the person would need to be talking about a week and a day between the first and last time mentioned, when structured like this otherwise it would be:

You wouldn't mention a past tense day and then name the day you're on. It would go something like ""I arrived Friday, tonight we will meet."" Or ""I arrived today, tomorrow we will meet."" It makes no sense when you use both tenses.

The only things that arrive in Destiny on Friday are Xur and Trials. Neither of which is directly related to time. Plugging Xur in makes no sense because 6 people aren't denying anything. Plugging Osiris in and or his disciples doesn't fit because people aren't denying him, and we've never met him to return. 

The only way that makes sense is through a conversation with the stranger. She is telling us in present tense that she arrived in the past on a Friday and is going to meet with our past selves the day after. That's why it makes sense when they say ""this is where I'll wait. Return to me.""

So, **TL;DR** if it's directed at our guardian, we met them before. We have not yet met a character that fulfills the dialogue. Also, the timeline makes no sense with its wording above as there is no day in between Friday and Saturday.

It's obvious to most now that nerfing the amount of ammo we had dropped in games didn't work. Neither did starting with none; good teams just trample bad teams now by killing them right before it drops, or use glitches to get it. 

I propose that **in 6v6 games we award 1/2 points for special ammo kills and half super energy**. This would naturally lead people to use primaries more often, not only to win games but to get more supers. It wouldn't solve the 3v3 problem, but I'm predicting Thursday Bungie will have an answer for ice breaker and sidearm glitches. It might actually push players to use primaries to get their super faster in trials too. 

I really don't want them to just bury the weapons and their ammo, this is a good indirect alternative. ",DestinyTheGame,The real special ammo nerf that we need:,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/4d8fjf/the_real_special_ammo_nerf_that_we_need/

One that even made over a dozen news articles.

 https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3e58dj/xpost_from_rraidsecrets_all_gorgons_dead/

Led by a legendary guardian still on my friends list, /u/ZPEvo and an assortment of randoms from /r/raidsecrets, we went in for one of our last attempts before the GHorn and shotgun nerf. 

It was a rocky and messy attempt, and one of evo's hundredth tries, but anticipation was high. We were getting close and we wanted a secret to pop... When the time finally came for us to drop our Weapons of Light and solo our Gorgons I led the countdown  and unloaded my overpowered GHorn and Fellwinters into mine. He dropped quick enough for me to get eyes and rounds on the next before everyone else was done with theirs. If I was a few seconds earlier hitting the second gorgon with a rocket we would have wiped because the others weren't dead yet and the new one would share the old ones wipe timer. A mechanic to make double gorgon catches near impossible to fight out of.

Everything fell silent. No music. No audio cue. The Gorgons noise was deafened, all 6 reduced to parts. We searched high and low for any difference in the area... Nothing. They respawned as normal and we finished the raid for good measure after checking both chests and the teleporter. 

As disappointing as it was not to find any loot or secrets, it was one of the hardest things I've done in a game, especially with 6 strangers, and to this day I'm unaware of it being duplicated. It's nice to have a record in the game I love. If you weren't around back then, or want to take a trip down memory lane with me, watch the video in the thread above. Thanks for being and amazing community.

It's fighting for nearly identical player bases at a time when Destiny players are starved for content. I've seen my friends list get burned to the ground during the content drought, with two of the better players DELETING characters so they can't come back. It's an addiction and The Division may be the 12 step program. 

The Division is what most of us wanted Destiny to be: Cosmetics with no stats, open world, always on proximity mic by default(this is a toxic discussion here, love it or hate it, it adds significant replayability to what would otherwise be strikingly grindy and faceless), easy join and play content and AI that's not dumb as a bag of rocks. 

Thankfully, Bungie is being more open and honest lately, with a plan that tentatively spans months, but is it fast enough? I guess we'll see. Players that joined into the open beta, what do you think?

Pretty much everyone I met that had a mic also played Destiny. There was a common thread that took this game from ""let's go kill stuff"" to near role playing ""GET YOUR HANDS UP!"" Action. 

Mic. Always. On. 

We all know that Bungie finally put in fireteam chat, with allies only, in Destiny. But not after getting people used to party chat and them making their chat default off. The Division defaults on, rogue or not, and it. Is. Amazing. 

You start to roll up on players and you can hear them. Rogues are taunting, newbs are begging, alliances are forming. It's everything destiny should have done. It brings a new dynamic to the experience, every time you log in. One day it's a bunch of southern gentleman taking on adds and needing help, another it's a rogue squeaker team trying to wreak havoc. Even later it's two people role playing the apocalypse. 

Imagine rolling up on a team in trials, and they can hear you talking shit, and you them. A team in the tower raging at Rahool. Or a team in control saying ""if that try hard comes over here one more time."" Even running past people on Patrol and hearing cries of help coming from a guardian getting Tea Bagged by Randal. 

Bungie, please, move and adapt here and let's take some notes from another AAA game in the making. I'm sure some of you don't want it, but Jesus... Besides custom games and Forge mode... Nothing could help this game more.

Some fun conclusions:

At 280, any sniper can still one shot to the head. Fatebringer does 56 damage to the head. Lightning grenade does 102. You can still survive a Titan hammer if he misses and you take splash dmg. (RIP hammerbro) Necrochasm still sucks, but my friend was melting with it. 

Wearing as skull mask makes you 250, ineligible to start, but you can play once you get in and switch. A black hammer does ~250 to the head and can't Rez snipe a max armor Titan. Fist of havoc still kills people. A max armor Titan at 250 almost gets one shot to the body by a 1K stare. GHorn is still a one shot IF you hit them with it. It does ~202 dmg+ Wolfpack.

No where is it more prevalent then iron banner that Bungie's ""mic off by default"" is a joke. It's rare to find even *one* that has bothered to switch it on/knows you could. When they do, there is no mic plugged in. I'm sorry, but in competitive play YOU NEED communication. Recently playing CoD, you see more than half the room mic'd up. I played 10 games straight with no mom jokes. It's SIMPLE to mute people too, with a roster screen that's, you know, running through out the whole game with an overlay you can access that shows Kills, deaths and objectives. Also there is ""quick mute"" options. 

And I don't want to hear the argument that you should party up. Half, or I'd say 75% of this games content is done through LFG for most people. What do you think LFG is for? MIC'd up teammates. It's random people, you rarely check the stats of unless it's trials, that are teaming up for an option to communicate and nothing else. 

Let's not scoff at the amount of new friends (and enemies) you'd make with a mic always on system. I've made a ton of friends from simple matchmade rage fests.

On how to do it after it's been so long the opposite way?

There should be a tooltip as soon as you get to the director, first time after the change. 

*""The mic option has been defaulted to ""always on"" for matchmaking. To change this...""*

**TL;DR** - Mics always on by default are good for the game. Maybe it's time to make the ones that want it off, have to figure out there is a toggle.

What if we removed shotguns all together. 

Stay with me. 

All of the above movement systems don't work with destiny's only unique weapon class: fusion rifles. What if destiny dropped shotguns, at least in year two and beyond, and replaced them with fusions.

-All the above movement problems go away with inst-kill special weapons(mainly shotguns).
-Special weapons get an uptick in the skill requirement because of the need for tracking opponents, and accuracy.
-Destiny further separates itself from a copy/paste shooter. 

I think that shotguns had their chance. They were needed a half dozen times and it's still a problem. I assume kills with shotguns still outweighs any other weapon type, don't have the stats on it though. What do you think?

The last three audio files really drive it home. 

Brendan said he got these fictitious ideas, lying to the cops, from a book called ""Kiss the girls."" That book is 400 pages long and his own attorney said he has a 4th grade reading level. Recall on that would be impossible, let alone reading it cover to cover. 

Brendan confessed to a minor, but huge detail, in that they laid branches across the car. Not sure how he would even know that detail to give if he didn't see it. Did they show him the car in a photo? maybe. 

Avery apparently beat his ex, and threatened to kill her family. Add that to Brendan saying Avery touched himself and another relative... Well. 

The time frame doesn't leave a lot of time for someone to kill the woman after she leaves(which means getting her to stop her car and possibly get out, shoot her without being noticed and leave no blood, transport the body, burn her, transport get back, sneak on the property to put her in the fire pit in a way that Avery wouldn't notice, and then go hide the car again and walk off on foot. 

The star 67 calls bother me. 2 before and one without when she's supposedly already dead. The fact that he tricked her to come, after she said she didn't want to because he was a creep, with a false name really digs at me. 

I watched the whole season. I was with them here and there, but listening to Brendan go on about how he got the idea from a 400 page book he sure as hell didn't read was the turning point. Avery killed that woman, just like they said, and had Brendan take part.

It's plainly obvious to me that someone killed Theresa at another location, put her in her car, and hid the car on the property. They then put the bones in the burn barrel, got a hold of Avery's blood and put it in the car and sent a ""scout"" with a camera to the lot.

The car wasn't covered up by Avery to hide it from the cops, the cops covered it up to hide it from Avery. 

The cops planted the key, a key in which could be from any vehicle in the lot, then they planted a bullet. After that they got the media to get rabid and ruin the jurors in the county.

First of all, since I met him about 3 years ago, he gave zero fucks about destiny.

After showing him yet another video of my ridiculous antics, and the fact that the bundle plus RaF goodies was $40, he caved.

I was elated. Not only am I running dry on X1 friends to do stuff with, and wanting the high five emote, he referred two others and on top of that he's on his way to being family (he doesn't yet know I'm proposing to his sister next week). I send him the referral link and he starts it up with my gf's other brother and best friend. I hookup with him half way through the house of wolves a day later (he's been *grinding*) and we blow through some missions, I help the other two and when they take off we push on. He is loving Cayde's banter, and the ghost dropping the mic(gatekeeper) on the queen's brother. He swears me up and down every hour or two for getting him sucked in. I get to ride through the missions and experience content I haven't touched in a year, all while feeding his lore-hungry personality. I let him trigger all the things like the shieldbro in Cayde's stash and I sit down and let him get spawn trapped on the mission that's *not really over* when you kill the ogre

A day or two passes, me anxiously watching him through roster between work and end game content runs, he acquired an invective and he's level 40, ready for the real grind (he smartly saved his spark for a second character, to experience the whole thing the way it should be). I party up bring up the dreadnaught because he couldn't yet open it, and we sprint for the court of oryx. (**You put a GUARDIAN on the dreadnaught?!**)When we get there, we notice 4 other guardians (I know, right?) beating their head against a tier 3 ogre boss. I equip my sword and kill everything. *Raze Lighter isn't Op, please don't nerf.* For the next 2 hours I pour every rune I have (dozens), including T3, and every one he picks up into this thing. After a few cryptarch trips he's a whopping 240 light. We go to bed with plans for the daily, weekly and nightfall. 

I catch up with him the next night and we are ready. We blow through the daily. We put our shader and emblem on and we load up the weekly figuring I could carry him with one other tanky random and hit a **wall**. Somehow he ended up at the shield brother boss immediately with another guardian who was barely high enough to enter. He must have been left here, not wanting to lose the checkpoint he just got slapped over and over. Neither one could kill anything, short of a few red bars and everything killed them. I took off my ""fun 300 gear"" and went into double grenade, melting point 317 sunbreaker try hard mode with skates, LiC Eirene and and the sleeper. I was skating for my life, and theirs, making the first two bosses run practically single handed and getting a dozen revives in the process. Then, comes the nightmare scenario... Both bosses come out, with add backup. Fuck. Guardian down! Guardian down! I'm left alive, 30 seconds at a time, getting smashed by one and mortared by the other. I'd skate across the map, super the adds, risk a heavy ammo synth and pop revives. 

Guardian down! Guardian down! I skate to the corner and unload 7 sleepers. I skate to the other corner, popping the bubble and getting the mortar bro to move and I snipe the smasher another 4-5 times. This goes on for almost a literal half hour. Me running for my life, always out of ammo and red health, them racking up deaths like that time your sister asked to play your Call of Duty. 

I kill the smash boss with the last two sleeper shots in the mag and I get both revives for the hundredth or so time, or so it felt. My fingers *hurt* from skating nonstop. 3v1 doesn't take as long, but they both die to a fresh group of adds. When I revive them, it's a rush to break the bubble, melting point and put him to sleep. He goes down, I shake my hands out and we share a ""holy shit!"" Laugh. We high five and move on. By far the hardest thing I've had to do short of first ran raids.

The nightfall isn't even worth talking about because I had a friend help carry. It finished and we got our final reward, the sparrow. It felt bittersweet to be done, but I knew we had more content to do. I got 4 friends together and LFG'd an actual raid virgin and we did VoG and Crota easy. I let them learn stuff the hard way, we didn't cheese a single thing and we even wouldn't move out of the Crota's end pit, or cross the first bridge, unless everyone came. Lots of supers, lots of deaths by the bridge, some of the most fun I've ever had. He ended up with the Song of Ir Yut emblems and shaders as his only real drops(armor was sharded). RNG, amirite?

An epic tale for an epic start of a soon to be guardian in law.

http://db.planetdestiny.com/items/view/4114401059

One of my favorite snipers in Destiny is a blue. With an impact of 31, a range of 71, and an aim assist of 43, this blue sniper is one of the best, balanced, revive snipers in the entire game.

To compare:

-Eirene has 34 impact, 74 range and only 22 AA.
-1000 Yard has 31 impact, 66 range and 56 AA
-Stillpiercer has 31 impact, 66 range and 51 AA. 
-Efrideet's Spear has 37 impact, 88 range but only 10 aim assist.


The roll I have has near max range, boosting its target acquisition, hidden hand which according to the source video below, adds ""5-10 points to target acquisition"" and a scope that adds a dash more. So minimum AA could arguably be 48 while its max could be 53-55.

If you find this thing, give it a run. While its not an extra cheesy body shot kill or max AA, it's damn good and it looks sexy as fuck in game.

I'll make this short and sweet because I don't see it talked about much, and all the streamers tell you to do left right strats... For pubs, this is a nightmare. Here's how to do it with any group of derps(I beat the raid with 3 newbies in less than 2 hours, and have 4 full clears under my belt.)

**Setup**

2 Gaze Getters
1 Thrall killer
3 DPS professionals

**Execution**

Drop the orb to start the encounter from behind the back bridge. Kill all adds back there and move forward once they're dead. 

One of the two gaze getters grabs the gaze and goes to the front door, off to the left a bit so the DPS crew can do damage from L2. 

The fight continues like so: the second grabber stands on the pillar to the immediate right or left of the gazer. At 2 seconds or so he takes the gaze and swaps position with number one. The DPS team, and spare gazer, takes down L1 and then R1 in turn, maximizing each pool.

So I completed the Nightfall 2 days ago and what else would drop but the reddit-proclaimed ""worst Titan Exotic ever.""


**Empyrean Bellicose**


*This barely understood Golden Age technology once held aloft the floating gardens of Pomona Mons. Now, it's stopping bullets.*

Tree 1 - Anti-Grav Thrusters - Aiming weapons while in the air will hold you in place for a short time, and orbs collected while in your super will recharge your melee ability. 

Tree 2 - Increase Intellect/Discipline

Tree 3 - Bonus super from melee/Bonus super from special weapons.



At first glance... Lol right? That's what I thought, and at first that's what I did. ""I can't believe I have a warlock sticky nade and a warlock ability..."" So I tried them out. Religiously. I bought the Saint 14 helm, but only kept it on long enough to max it out. So, here is more than 30 hours of my thoughts:

**It's actually really good.**

Angel of Light went mostly unused because you had to sacrifice another perk for it, at the moment I'm only sacrificing a blinding bubble, and being a sun breaker makes that irrelevant. 

I found that I was using this **More often** then not. I would hover over Cabal shields and slap them with a handcannon, abuse lines of sight for cover and best of all: shotgun bosses like it was my job. 

Most bosses will one shot you if you get close, with this helm I could float safely above them out of one hit range and sometimes out of range at all (I'm looking at you dark blade). I would just double jump nice and high, adjust for the momentary forward movement while I ADS and boom, six shotgun rounds to the head. 

In PvP it was kind of the same thing, I could be on a point, see that I'm getting rushed and just hop up out of sight to get that ever so important first shot/bewilderment.

I can't recommend that these be the end all be all, or main armor piece to get you better, but it's definitely not a bad helmet. The shotgunning of bosses alone make this an excellent choice for any class that isn't defender. Death from above even gets a small boost as you can just sit and wait for a more perfect slam. 

Final thoughts: try it out. It'll surprise you with its usefulness. It's bonus perk to recharge melee really helps keep ""melting point"" active.

Eventually, the Bungee hammer of reason was swift and hard. A shadow of its former self, it was nerfed, bugged, nerfed again and broken while trying to fix it, but it's 2.0 time and this bad boy is back and mean. How mean? I spent an hour or so in the crucible playing clash, salvage and control and got/edited some clips for you of how NASTY this thing is. Sure, Extended mags is broken, but ""mulligan"" is buffed. 20% chance to return shots to the magazine and it happens a LOT. 

After watching, you still think shotguns have no competition? If you even remotely like fusion rifles, pick this one up and give it a spin.

So there I am, grinding out Patrol Grimoire on Earth while I level up my very last Exotic, Dreg's Promise. After what seemed like my 4th magazine into a level one vandal, he finally died to the level 7 nearby shooting him with a scout rifle.

I *waved* and checked his Grimoire Score. 290. ""Aw, a newbie!"" I thought. I remembered that we were supposed to take one under our wing and all that jazz so I proceeded to invite him to the game. Of course this made him leave my side and fly up to space, only to come back down, and I messaged him ""Mic?""

After explaining to him via text how to go into settings and turn his mic on, he told me he was a ""Forever 7"" demo player, on the fence whether to buy into our little drug. He looked my weapons and armor over, a mix of VoG, Crota, PoE and Trials with the Armamentarium to top it all off. My emblem was the flawless emblem. My shader came from Variks(that sweet black and green one). I realized how far I'd come, and how many hours invested to have any of that so I decided to drag him around a bit. I did a few patrols with him, got him a hidden ghost, showed him a few Wolves' Events, the first of which coincided with the enemy moving against each other and Urzok, which was nuts, and even got him a chest. After two runs I figured he could actually get counted as hitting the boss (who was immune ?? to him) and get a key if he used the Scorch Cannon. This let him open the chest which gave him two greens. Woo! Upgrade! He was wearing all white so we took off for the tower. 

I showed him where Rahool was and he ran over ready to receive his loot... Silence... Both turned into whites. Well, at least he got the day one experience. I explained how shitty that guy was and asked him if he had done the strike, since he was locked on earth that's all I could offer him, and he hadn't, so I took off with him to Devil's Lair with a matchmade fresh level 6 (2600 grimoire).

I let him suffer (as we had) at each checkpoint before I brought out the big guns. ""Do we have to protect this Mesh thing?"" *""Nah, the enemies don't attack it... you kinda just have to stay alive.""* (how cool would it be if we actually had to defend it?!) When they both went down, I unloaded Ghorn on the mob, hulk smashed the captain and revived them both. ""Whoa...""

Next up was the tank, I explained how to injure the boss, and it would be best to keep some distance because of his level and the adds (white weapons with no burn against captains? Nope.) He hid on top of that building you first see. Guardian down! *""Oh yeah, if you camp in that specific spot, the game sends adds at you.""* I let him have at it for a few minutes before I broke out my Black Hammer.

Onto Sepiks, no special tricks here. I let him grind out the entire fight, with me occasionally putting a rocket his way or clearing adds. The Steak and Cheese I ordered showed up(20 min late) when he had 10% health so I was all done now.  I showed him the chest, added him and told him where to buy the package deal of year one and TTK items. I look forward to hearing Nolan as I drag this guy through a new character.

You're welcome, Bungie. And thank you, this little side track made me really step back and think about where we've been and all the fun I've had on the way. Glad to be an ambassador.

[SGA] If you revive a teammate in trials after you've won the round(a late Self Rez on the other team can't change the outcome), it'll count as a revive for next round, doubling his revive timer.

If you're worried about Self Rez or want special, sure, just be aware of it.

-edit- Let me clarify... There are TWO ends to a round, one is when everyone on the opposing team is dead and self revivers can still do their thing. The second end is slightly later in the countdown when whether or not they revive, they lose anyway. IF you revive someone during the second phase, they will have an increased spawn timer next round. 

-edit2- I guess ""after you've won the round"" isn't specific enough... A commenter mentioned to wait until you see the ""+1"" for the round.

I suggest that when you are spawned into a game down more than 1,000 points per enemy teammate(to balance the following) you spawn with a heavy ammo pack, a special ammo pack and a super.

It's 4:30am eastern time. My IRL friend and I, who have been to the lighthouse a dozen times, are trying to help a lighthouse virgin(but Trials regular) get his first Mercury trip. We were 4 hours and multiple cards in, the talent we RNG'd against was like nothing I've seen in my weekly trips since launch(we aren't TripleWreck, but we don't have much trouble going flawless 3x a week). I don't know if all the bad people just gave up, the average people got better or only the strongest even bother anymore... 

Against All Odds he didn't wavier... through the bullshit losses, bad connections, wee hours into the night and sheer ass whooping we were taking at times this guy was really upbeat saying, ""I'm having fun, it's ok if we don't go.""

No. It was **not** ok. I'm tilted, playing poorly late in the matches. Tired. But I promised this guy a run and we might not get a schedule that coincides any time soon.

Coming off a 1v1 round where I had the chance to end it with a hulk smash, and got shot-gunned mid-jump, we were 7-1, mercy popping for 7-0. We went to the reef to buy the double win boon again and give it one last hoorah. 

We go up early 4-2 on the back of our sniper and some clutch grenade zoning, but we lose the next two being outplayed by well placed Thorn and nade spam. There we were. 4-4 in the last round of the last game we could stay awake to play, lighthouse or nothing. 

We were sun-side and I rushed left with my sniper and tried to take advantage early. Nothing. My team pushes in right. Nothing. All of the sudden, my mini-map lights up and two pop out ADS on me. I make the callouts and nade just in time to keep them back while my team pushes in. 

The Lightning nade fades and here they come. I take two Thorn shots to the body and yell *""I'm burning""* as I slide to take a corner... **Headshot!** My buddy gets a headshot on their thorn user. The other two retreat as the guy we are helping through backs them up with a firebolt nade. I recover and push up... Last word in hand, ADS. The mini-map lights up and fades. Lights up and fades. A guy crouching around the corner, surely with a shotgun and nade ready...

*""Bladedancer!""* our guy yells. I see it out of the corner of my eye on middle bridge.

I go quiet. Like a montage from a Rocky movie I remember that shotgun blast. I remember the burnt cards and the thorns and the double warlock nades. Not. Today. *This is where we hold them! This is where they die!* our hours younger, more focused and not so deprived of sleep guardians quipped earlier...

I take the corner and hulk smash that Bladedancer with the fury, strength and adrenaline of a mother who's car is crushing her child. Blade down. His teammate tries to rally but he's burning from a nade and I put three Last Word rounds in his chest. 

*Yours, not mine.*

It went quiet. Peaceful. No self-Rez. The realization that he just went flawless, and then it pops up in the feed. ""LightHouse Virgin has completed their card."" He completely lost his shit and I haven't had such a rush of fun and triumph since my own first run, first atheon or first crota kill...

TL;DR - Backs against the wall, tied 4-4 on the last all or nothing game of the night, I got a guardian to the lighthouse with a sweet redemption Stallone would be proud of.

My friend and I were bored to shit so we decided to buy all white gear, and all white weapons and head into Team Doubles. We did surprising well, winning 4 out of 5 games consistently, considering we had 0 intellect, strength and discipline. Grenades and supers were precious; it really teaches you to be accurate and work as a team to team-shoot.

The Válka SR2 with a 10 round capacity and 55 dmg headshot was my main go-to because the bandit hand cannon only has 3 rounds. It was surprising solid.

I used the Hieracon-LR2 for my sniper. Boasting a 400+ dmg headshot it was capable of dropping an enemy after being revived. This was my go-to to start gunfights.

The Jester SA/2 was the only heavy option seeing as the LMG only did 25 to the head. 

The rules of the game are simple: all white everything (including class item and random emblem) only, and you can use any green or blue if you pick it up from an endgame drop.  If you get all blue gear, you can equip any exotic boots or arms armor piece. Tell me how you do, if you take part!

Thieve's Den? If you're on top you can push, but you better play defense on bottom.

Sprained left wrist working out. Didn't realize how bad, worked with it anyway. 

Tried to let it heal on its own with a wrist brace. It didn't. Got a immobilizing brace. Did nothing.

Saw a doctor. Got an X-ray Said ""keep bracing it and wait a month."" I did, no effect. Told me I might have a TFC tear. Got an MRI

Got a new surgeon to look at the MRI and X-ray. Thinks my ulna is too short, other doctor missed this. Lunate bone shows low blood flow on the MRI. The doctor says wait three more months and then possibly have surgery to take a piece of the radius out.



Current symptoms: wrist soreness at rest. No pressure point pain. Extreme pain at maximum flexion and extension. Quick jolts practically bring me to my knees. Poor grip strength followed by intense pain as I squeeze harder.

Is my second doctor a flop too? You guys suggested I get another one and still it's more ""wait it out"" prognosis. I believe it's either a partial tear that won't heal or Kienbock's disease.
