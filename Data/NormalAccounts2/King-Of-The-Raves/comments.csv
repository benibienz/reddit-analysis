0,"Ned is so stoic in this chapter and I love it.

&gt;Ned had slept badly last night and he felt tired beyond his years. “None of us is ever
ready,” he said.
“For knighthood?”
**“For death.”**

&gt;“It is worth a fair piece of silver,” Ser Barristan said. “The boy had it forged special for
the tourney. Plain work, but good. I do not know if he had finished paying the smith.”
**“He paid yesterday, my lord, and he paid dearly,”** Ned replied.

I live for that sort of dialogue. There's so much great stuff in this chapter, where to begin?

I particuarlly love Robert's reflection, as I'll iterate why;

&gt;“Drink and stay quiet, the king is talking. **I swear to you, I was never so alive as when I
was winning this throne, or so dead as now that I’ve won it.** And Cersei . . . I have Jon
Arryn to thank for her. I had no wish to marry after Lyanna was taken from me, but Jon
said the realm needed an heir. Cersei Lannister would be a good match, he told me, she
would bind Lord Tywin to me should Viserys Targaryen ever try to win back his father’s
throne.” The king shook his head. “I loved that old man, I swear it, but now I think he
was a bigger fool than Moon Boy. Oh, Cersei is lovely to look at, truly, but cold . . . the
way she guards her cunt, you’d think she had all the gold of Casterly Rock between her
legs. Here, give me that beer if you won’t drink it.” He took the horn, upended it,
belched, wiped his mouth. **“I am sorry for your girl, Ned. Truly. About the wolf, I mean.**
My son was lying, I’d stake my soul on it. My son . . . you love your children, don’t you?”
“With all my heart,” Ned said.
“Let me tell you a secret, Ned. More than once, I have dreamed of giving up the crown.
**Take ship for the Free Cities with my horse and my hammer, spend my time warring and
whoring, that’s what I was made for.** The sellsword king, how the singers would love me.
You know what stops me? The thought of Joffrey on the throne, with Cersei standing
behind him whispering in his ear. **My son. How could I have made a son like that, Ned?”**

Here we see the ghost of the good man Ned knew and loved shine through the current bitter and drunk form Robert Baratheon has taken. 

At his heart, I have no doubt Robert Baratheon is a good man. But the years has withered him away, he lived for the battle but was thrusted into a role he didn't want and forced to marry a woman ""for the realm.""

Robert may be true steel, but steel is made for fighting.

He is the stereotypical fantasy hero sixteen years later. Robert was a strong, good looking, charismatic warrior rebel fighting against a tyrant and to reclaim his love. However as with all tropes, Georgie turns it on his head by showing the aftermath of what happens to the hero, with the price of triumph weighing heavy on them and obscuring the hero they once were.

And then the whole mini Cleganebowl happens...

&gt;The Mountain pivoted in wordless fury, swinging his longsword in a killing arc with all
his massive strength behind it, but the Hound caught the blow and turned it, and for
what seemed an eternity the two brothers stood hammering at each other as a dazed
Loras Tyrell was helped to safety. **Thrice Ned saw Ser Gregor aim savage blows at the
hound’s-head helmet, yet not once did Sandor send a cut at his brother’s unprotected
face.**
 

...However despite Sandor's immense hatred for his brother, he shows himself capable of restraint as despite the circumstances he doesn't aim for his brother's head.

And its always interesting to note despite the Hound's personality, he can be devoutly obedient and loyal;

&gt;He used that voice now. “STOP THIS
MADNESS,” he boomed, “IN THE NAME OF YOUR KING!”
**The Hound went to one knee.**

And I also thought Sansa and Arya's interaction was interesting, because it seems everyone besides Ned, Arya and Syrio literally think she's taking dancing lessons;

&gt;“I’m sore all over,” Arya reported happily, proudly displaying a huge purple bruise on
her leg.
“You must be a terrible dancer,” Sansa said doubtfully

2,"Well, its hard to know what is truly foreshadowing when the series is yet to be ended.

As to your specific examples, the Daynes hold Ned Stark is high esteem so it would make sense to mention a couple times to their heir (who is nicknamed after the man) that he shared a milk maid with Stark's bastard. And in wildling/free folk culture there isn't a lot of medical advancement so they would see the in depth effects of any disease. I would imagine a wildling child who survives Grey Scale didn't get it treated as well as one down South, so it could remain dormant and see the affects later down the line. Just a guess, though.

However, it would take a lot of convincing to Rodrik or Maester Luwin. Had he been able to go on his quest, Rickon would have no reason to journey with Bran and be the Stark in Winterfell.

I can't see the Boltons sacking Winterfell held by the Starks, but I can still see Roose plotting to betray Robb somehow. However, the Red Wedding (or at least the form it took) wouldn't occur as Robb got with Jeyne Westerling for comfort after hearing of his brothers' ""deaths."" So he would go to marry a Frey, so they would be placated for the time being.

A Stark prescence in the North would probably be more successful against the Ironborn, but I can still see them taking some regions.

The Starks would be in a much better place and Bran/Rickon could continue the Northern cause, but ultimately clinging to the Riverlands would probably be their downfall (at least in the South). ",2016-11-20 18:56:44+00:00,da8fytp,1.0,t3_5dzbx7,1824.0,pureasoiaf

The Blackfish narrowed his eyes. ""Did your father arrange for that as well? Catelyn never trusted the boy, as I recall, no more than she ever trusted Theon Greyjoy. It would seem she was right about them both...""""

So, that leaves Edmure, Sansa and Robin Arryn and maybe fArya to support. No one really knows whats up with Sansa right now, so he can't really go to her. He didn't have a high opinion of Lysa's upbrining of Robin, but given that in AGOT he refers to him as the ""True Warden of the East"" he might go to Robin. Maybe he's heading to Winterfell for fArya, who he would believe until seeing her is the real deal, and bringing Jeyne Westerling former Queen of the North would serve a reason to go North. As for Edmure, he's held tightly by the Lannisters so there's not much for him to do on that end.

However, perhaps given his wandering in the Riverlands I can very well see him stumble across the Brotherhood Without Banners. Led by his late niece, which I expect would be an interesting encounter.

Given that the Vale is the only kinda safe Kingdom for him and that its still being ""led"" by his nephew as opposed to the dangerous Riverlands and North, I can see him on rotue there but bumping into the BwB along the way or simply living off the land in the Riverlands.

Well, Qyburn was in a Arya chapter when they come across Harrenhal if I recall. Then in a couple Jaime chapters when he's at Harrenhal with Roose and Brienne. Then more prominently in Cersei chapters as a more important character.

And the BwB always pops around. Anguy is in the Tourney of the Hand and wins the archery competition as well as Beric and Thoros being in the Tourney too. Then in an Eddard chapter Ned sends Beric and Thoros to gather some men to get the Mountain. Then of course later in Arya chapters they're more prominent.

43,"If Ser Alliser becomes LC, I see the wildling situation resulting in bloodshed with the Night's Watch ending up weakened as a result. It would provide enough chaos for a great leader to emerge to unite their anger and point it North of the Wall, whether the 1000th LC be Stannis, Jon or someone else I think 1000th LC will be something major, rather than just a coincedental number. It was set up that way for a reason after all. I would see his POV immediatley recapping a recent disasterous event for his ranging. 

As for Hardhome, I'm not sure. Its a bit far from Castle Black, on the eastern coast and much closer to Eastwatch-By-The-Sea. But if they got hit with a storm or an attack, then its plausible they make their way there. I wouldn't be surprised if we end up seeing Hardhome, though I'm not sure which character we'd see it from. But if Ser Alliser was a POV, then I don't think it would be impossible for him to be it. Given that Jon got the letter after Alliser was sent away, I don't think he'd have any reason to go their on his ranging. But I don't think Ser Alliser will be a corpse by the next time we see him, as despite being a jerk sometimes he's still a hardened man of the Watch.

Actually, on my first reading I made a mistake in thinking that Ser Alliser was one of the Night's Watchmen killed by the Weeper, for whatever my logic was at the time. Took me a little bit to discover I was false.",2016-09-05 19:25:35+00:00,d7akx0d,3.0,t1_d7aivtd,3127.0,pureasoiaf

Don't think they'll end up at Bloodraven's cave, but if they did I can see Bran trying to get them to come in since his family has ties to the Watch, and a few allies are never too bad. If they were that far North, I think they'd jump at the chance for shelter.

Or he might come back to be elected the new LC after Jon's death, then perhaps he'll die and Jon's resurrection he'll be reelected as the 1000th LC.

""The Dothraki do not believe in money and so the existence of these coins has proved a mystery. But it is now felt by some authorities that these “coins” were the product of an unnamed trader and tinker traveling about the Vaes Dotherak. His skills were useful, so the Dothraki did not kill him, but he became tired of being raided all the time and sought to adopt the Dothraki tradition of reciprocal gifting. He made and offered armbands with Drogo’s repeated image on them to the khal to curry favor whilst seeking to gain the (quite considerable) business of mending their tack. In effect he was slyly introducing them to the concept of money.

The Dothraki themselves typically use these only as full strings, preferring the silver over the copper, but they eventually drift via gift-giving or violence  into the general sedentary population and there the armbands are often cut up into singles and pairs. There is no established monetary parity vis-a-vis Westerosi coinage, but typically forty or so of these copper puli are equivalent to one silver Denga. The weight and condition of these may vary somewhat from piece to piece. Traders and merchants widely accept them at about their weight/metal value against any other coin, and there are enough of them in circulation that they are not considered rare.""",2016-08-29 00:36:41+00:00,d70lwgx,3.0,t1_d70ldzu,812.0,pureasoiaf

109,"A bit of surprisingly hard question, both for who I care about and who's considered minor.

1) Thoros of Myr, He's quite the badass; flaming sword, first over the walls at Pyke and founding member of the BwB. Though his and Beric's vision for it has fallen out of its graces which is a bummer, I still hope he doesn't meet his Red God any time soon.

2) Pod Payne. A really nice kid, with no malice in his heart. Just a loyal and kind kid who wants to be a good knight someday. Seen horrors beyond his years, thanks to the Blackwater and Lady Stoneheart though.

3) Hard picking the third and there'll probably be characters that I would've picked after reflecting and thinking more but screw it. Ser Bronn of the Blackwater himself. Though certainly not innocent, a bit of a jerk actually, but through his wit and action I've grown attached to him and would be sad to see him go.",2016-08-14 02:03:14+00:00,d6glb8k,1.0,t3_4xaxtm,177075.0,pureasoiaf
110,"1) My opinion? As a person, I don't like him. He's a monster in a man's skin, evil not just for ambition but just to be evil. But he does impress me with his speeches and the like, and is an eterntaining and charming antagonist. He has casts a large prescence in all the chapters he's in so I like reading chapters with him in it.

2) His plans? Conquer Westeros, conquer some more. Gain power in general, and it seems he's aiming at the highest power; some magical divine power.

3) Will his plans come true? Maybe a bit. I doubt at the end of Dream For Spring, it'll read ""And so sits King Euron of House Greyjoy, Fourth of His Name King of the Ironborn, Andals, Rhoynar and First Men, etc"" I can see him holding portions of the Reach and maybe even greater Westeros for a time but he'll be defeated, but his actions will leave a shadow for future events.

4) Was he the best pick? Objectively, no. The Ironborn are stuck in a self destructive cycle of dependency on reaving and reaving getting them punished, so someone like Asha or Gylbert Farwynd providing an alternate solution could've helped them break the cycle. But assuming I'm a common traditionalist Ironborn, I'd choose either Vicky or Euron for their promises. Following the Old Way, Euron is a good leader as he will probably bring them a lot as he has so far (though he'll quickly dispose of them if he needs to), but the Old Way is broken.

5) We have yet to see enough of his military prowress for me to make a big judgment, but from what we've seen so far he's at least competent if not a bit more. His plan for burning the Lannister fleet in the beginning of the Greyjoy Rebellion was a good one, and his strategey to take the Shield Isles evidently worked. I'm not sure if against a man like Stannis if he'd win, but he probably has a wild card up his sleeve in case of near defeat. As for his strategey about himself, he's rather good. He's gained much and more so far, but compared to himself I doubt he'd put as much focus into the military. A good short term guy but besides his own master plan for himself I doubt he's a big picture kind of guy. To compare him to others, without wild cards or magic; worse than Stannis, probably better than Robb if not an equal. 

6) I 100% think he has a connection to Bloodraven. I think he was a failed disciple of his given his dreams of flying in his youth. Besides that there isn't much to go on besides being mystic type guys but his flying dreams is damning enough for me to say yes.

7) Yeah, I 100% think so. [Spoilers TWOW] (#s ""In TWOW excerpt chapter we get confirmation that he abused Aeron and Urrigon. I think it was for power and just because he could but that isn't the point. Even before this confirmation, I was a staunch believer of this"" )

8) My favorite theory? Thats a hard one. Probably that he never went to Valyria and that he found someone coming back from Valyria, and for the theory being ideally Gerion Lannister and took their stuff and took credit. Maybe its my favorite because I actually believe it a bit, either he didn't go or the details are overplayed. (Edit: The Dragon Egg theory is one I believe is completely true so it didn't occur to me to use it since its basically fact to me. Referring to that he used his Dragon Egg to hire a Faceless Man to kill Balon).

In conclusion; Euron Greyjoy is a real monster but he's a blast to read about. And he sure is the maddest of them all.

The weirwood implies relation to the North and Old Gods, meaning its a Northman (which Howland is also granted). Also, shorter than an average man that would fit a woman (or granted, a crannogman). However they're disguised so there would be shame or dishonor or scandal if their identity is known. Also, they are described to have had a booming voice, probably Lyanna overcompensating for having a deep masculine voice. Also, Meera is surprised that Bran hadn't heard the story before, implying the Knight had a link to the Stark family. Also, Lyanna saw what the squires did to Howland so she would be have the knowledge of it so she could avenge him. Also, adding to R+L=J if you believe Lyanna is the Knight of the Laughing Tree; in AWOIAF its said Aerys sent Rhaegar to find the knight and after a long search he said he didn't find ""him"".

Qhorin Halfhand stumbled to his knees, trying in vain to staunch the flow of blood from his neck. ""I am the Lord of Winterfell,"" Jon screamed.

Perhaps its Ulthos or a Land of Eternal Summer. All I know is that there's something out there. Probably inhabitted by something as well.

Also, speaking of Essos and land masses, I believe Essos and Westeros connect. But not East to West, sort of East to North. The world of Planetos is shaped a bit weird, and I think far far East past the Grey Waste of Essos it eventually curves diagonolly to connect to the Lands of Always Winter. That would explain how reports of Others come from both Beyond-The-Wall and the Five Forts in the far east of Essos, as well as Children of the Forest in Essos (though I suppose that could be explained by the Great Arm of Dorne, though reports of the Others being where they are is damning evidence for me).",2016-08-01 04:23:56+00:00,d5z7a57,4.0,t1_d5z72kq,390.0,pureasoiaf

However if they didn't and new parmamounts were to be named, hard to say for the Vale but given the Darry's devotion to the crown and Jonothor and Willem Darry they could've well been named Lords of the Riverlands and Conningtons definitley for the Stormlands, with the Starks potentionally being able to keep the North due to Lyanna or Jon being named Lord as you suggested later in life.

Once taken, it will give us a secure fastness to which we may retreat at need, and winning it will prove our strength.""

""Stannis is Robert's brother, of that same ilk that brought down House Targaryen,"" Jon Connington reminded him.
