&gt;""It would have been kinder to leave her with a bastard in her belly,"" said Tyrion bluntly. The Westerlings stood to lose everything here; their lands, their castle, their very lives. A Lannister always pays his debts.
""Jeyne Westerling is her mother's daughter,"" said Lord Tywin, ""and Robb Stark is his father's son.""
**This Westerling betrayal did not seem to have enraged his father as much as Tyrion would have expected. Lord Tywin did not suffer disloyalty in his vassals.** He had extinguished the proud Reynes of Castamere and the ancient Tarbecks of Tarbeck Hall root and branch when he was still half a boy. The singers had even made a rather gloomy song of it. Some years later, when Lord Farman of Faircastle grew truculent, Lord Tywin sent an envoy bearing a lute instead of a letter. But once he'd heard ""The Rains of Castamere"" echoing through his hall, Lord Farman gave no further trouble. And if the song were not enough, the shattered castles of the Reynes and Tarbecks still stood as mute testimony to the fate that awaited those who chose to scorn the power of Casterly Rock. ""The Crag is not so far from Tarbeck Hall and Castamere,"" Tyrion pointed out. ""You'd think the Westerlings might have ridden past and seen the lesson there.""
**""Mayhaps they have,"" Lord Tywin said. ""They are well aware of Castamere, I promise you.""**
""Could the Westerlings and Spicers be such great fools as to believe the wolf can defeat the lion?""
Every once in a very long while, Lord Tywin Lannister would actually threaten to smile; he never did, but the threat alone was terrible to behold. **""The greatest fools are ofttimes more clever than the men who laugh at them,""** he said, and then, ""You will marry Sansa Stark, Tyrion. And soon.""

Going off of this, it is clear to me that House Westerling definitely was still loyal to Tywin. Why would a smaller House like them dare cross Lord Tywin Lannister himself? I don't think it was some elborate conspiracy from the beginning, but when Robb Stark took the Crag and was wounded I think Lady Westerling saw an oppurtunity and took it. There's a reason why young Jeyne was tending Robb rather than some maester or old woman. Jeyne in AFFC seems legitimately saddened by the Red Wedding, so I think while her mother pushed her into the situation she wasn't aware what her plans were.

Lady Westerling most likely wrote to Tywin when Robb was being tended by her daughter, and made a deal for future pardons and choice marriages for her children later down the road.

In fact, from AFFC;

&gt;Jaime nodded. Tywin Lannister was not a man to overlook such details. ""Unhand the girl,"" he said, ""I'm done with her for now."" As Jeyne fled sobbing down the stairs, he considered her mother. ""House Westerling has its pardon, and **your brother Rolph has been made Lord of Castamere.** What else would you have of us?""
**""Your lord father promised me worthy marriages for Jeyne and her younger sister. Lords or heirs, he swore to me, not younger sons nor household knights.""**

&gt;""He heard a whisper on the wind, a rustling amongst the leaves. You cannot speak to him, try as you might. I know. I have my own ghosts, Bran. **A brother that I loved, a brother that I hated, a woman I desired.** Through the trees, I see them still, but no word of mine has ever reached them. The past remains the past. We can learn from it, but we cannot change it.""

Now, we can easily decipher most of those people. Aegor is the most obvious of the three, being the brother he hated. Shiera is also easy to guess, as they were lovers and he proposed to her half a hundred times.

The hardest part, however, is the brother he loved. For a long time I easily considered it Good King Daeron II. Why not? Bloodraven was a Targaryen loyalist, and quite staunch in his anti-Blackfyre sentiments.

But after talking with u/LifeofPhi on the subject a bit, we came to an interesting conclusion. What if the brother he loved wasn't Daeron, but Daemon, the Black Dragon himself?

Daeron II though being pleasant with his half siblings, didn't seem like he would have a relationship past courtly and expected. Certainly baring Bloodraven no ill will, I doubt he would view him as true equal. Nothing we have heard about Daeron II makes it seem he would keep that good relationship with family. And also, u/LifeOfPhi brought up that Bloodraven is about 22 years younger than Daeron, a point I hadn't even thought of, meaning he would be growing up closer in age to Daemon.

Daemon however was known for winning friends, and that charm and being a bastard would be things for him and Bloodraven to bond over. Also growing up together in the Red Keep would provide time for the two to grow close, and Bloodraven could start to resent Quentyn Ball and Bittersteel for turning Daemon away from him (ala Floki on Ragnar and Athelstan in Vikings, in case you watch that).

This would add a very interesting depth to Bloodraven's character. Faced with choosing between his King and realm or his brother, he chooses duty over love. And in doing that, he hates the Blackfyres for making him choose against Daemon and hating Bittersteel for corrupting Daemon. In siding against the brother he loved, his only choice for coping would be to double down on his anti Blackfyre sentiments, turning the grief and sadness into hate and resentment.

I think this depth would make Bloodraven's character all the more intriguing and tragic, being forced to choose duty and kill his brother for the betterment of the realm. To be able to see Daemon through the weirwood, but never be able to take back what he did. Like Stannis' dilemma between choosing between his leige and his brother in the Rebellion, but choosing duty over love.

Waiting for a clear victor, after the decisive Battle of the Trident he sided with the rebels.

To show his commitment to Robert, Tywin sacked King's Landing and had the royal family butchered. In this he cemented his loyalty to the new dynasty.

But what would he have done if Rhaegar won? How would Tywin of shown his loyalty to the Mad King?

My first thought goes to Storm's End, to capture it and have the rest of the Baratheons killed. However, Storm's End was already under seige by the Tyrells and impossible to take by storm, so his numbers would do nothing.

Due to Moat Cailin and the Bloody Gate, two other of the major rebels would be unreachable. So that leaves the Riverlands, which always get the worst of everything.

So would Tywin pillage the Riverlands and sack Riverrun? March to Storm's End and kill Stannis and Renly? What could and would he have done to please the paranoid Mad King?

She doesn't follow Beric's example of trials and justice, but is driven by pure revenge. 

And soon, thanks to Brienne, she will soon have her hands on the Kingslayer. Now there doesn't have to be much of a reason for her to hate him and want him dead, she would kill a man just for wearing Lannister colors and Jaime has done much to earn a Stark's wrath.

However, it is interesting to note that she may have a special hatred for Jaime.

When Jaime is leaving Harrenhal, he says the following to Roose Bolton as they part;

&gt;Both parties left Harrenhal the same morning, beneath a cold grey sky that promised rain. Ser Aenys Frey had marched three days before, striking northeast for the kingsroad. Bolton meant to follow him. ""The Trident is in flood,"" he told Jaime. ""Even at the ruby ford, the crossing will be difficult. You will give my warm regards to your father?""
**""So long as you give mine to Robb Stark.""**

And the Leech Lord obliges,

&gt;A man in dark armor and a pale pink cloak spotted with blood stepped up to Robb. **""Jaime Lannister sends his regards.""** He thrust his longsword through her son's heart, and twisted.

This is just part of some cruel inner joke to Roose, but Catelyn doesn't know this. In one of the final things she hears (and the last thing she hears before she snaps), as far as she knows Jaime was involved in the Red Wedding. And given that the murderer of her son is sending his regards, to her he could be one of the driving forces behind it.

When Tywin offered to wed Tyrion to Lysa, Hoster mocked Tywin's son. Very polite;

Along with his massacre of a village, this takes the cake for the worst he has done;

**Quentyn Martell**. I've seen a lot of people call his arc pointless, but not only is he the catalyst for the dragons being real eased he also gives insight into the harshness of the Slaver's Bay situation and makes sure the Martells won't side with Dany once they hear about what happened.

**Gerold Darkstar**.  I even like the whole ""I am of the night.""

**(f)Aegon VI**. Granted, he doesn't get a whole lot of hate. But still I see people point out his lashing out of anger at Tyrion over cyvasse as evidence for being a poor ruler. However, Tyrion (a master manipulator) was intentionally trying to irritate him. And also, this helps to show that he is still young and imperfect despite JonCon, Varys and Illyrio's teachings. But he is still very talented; knowing multiple languages and laborer skills, being learned in history, growing up around small folk, and both demonstrating boldness/confidence with the Golden Company as well as the willingness to listen with JonCon.

Each novella has a set focus; the Tourney of Ashford, the Chequey Water fued, the Second Blackfyre Rebellion, etc. I suspect Sumerhall and Blackfyre Rebellions will be a topic, but what will the main focus of the others be? In the end of ""A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms"" it says they will travel to the Disputed Lands and throughout the Free-Cities but I can't imagine what for. 

Furthermore, are there any characters you think will make a comeback? I'd bet the wealth of Casterly Rock we'll see Glendon Ball again. But what if we got to see Daemon II again in his cell, or see Bennis the Brown or Lady Webber?

But was she that bad?

First off, she did try and heal Drogo. Multiple times. She bound his wound with paste and leaves and healing poultices, and warned him it would itch and burn. She then told him not to peel the paste crust or drink wine. And what does Drogo almost immediately do? Peel off the paste and drink as he pleases. 

Then Drogo's wound surprise, gets infected because of it, and ends up close to death. So, Mirri Maz Durr agrees to try and help this warlord again, after warning Dany mind you. Then she reasonablly requests that she be alone for her work. But pretty soon Jorah goes carrying Dany into the tent. Disobeying yet another rule the maegi told so healing can go smoothly.

So mayhaps if they had actually done as she said, Drogo would be alive. She did try afterall, despite everything. And even if she acted maliciously, who can blame her? Drogo was a warlord crushing the weak and taking as he pleased, and a few of his Khalasar raped Mirri Maz Durr a few times before Dany ""saved"" her (not to mention burning down her god's temple and killing everyone she had ever known). 

Dany thinks of Mirri Maz Durr as a betrayer, but she and Drogo were the ones who didn't follow her advice for healing. If you walk around with a broken leg without a cast and expect it to heal, you can't just burn your doctor at the stake. Unless you're a mad Targaryen.

He has been seen to pose as a jailer to contact Ned, and was involved in a mummer troop in his youth. But how deep does his deception go? Perhaps like his schemes, his acting goes down to his roots. Perhaps he has constructed an entire false personality we see in the books as to appear less menacing. On a few occasions when Varys is talking about something truly serious to him, or when he has no need to lie his voice is described as different and unfamiliar. Perhaps his true voice is that ordinarily, and his flowery accents are part of the perfumed feminine plump weakling persona he uses to divert suspicion to his true motives.

Here are quotes with such cases;

""""The Red Keep has ways known only to ghosts and spiders."" Varys smiled apologetically. ""I will not keep you long, my lord. There are things you must know. You are the King's Hand, and the king is a fool."" **The eunuch's cloying tones were gone; now his voice was thin and sharp as a whip.** ""Your friend, I know, yet a fool nonetheless … and doomed, unless you save him. Today was a near thing. They had hoped to kill him during the melee."""" AGOT, Eddard VII

**The voice was strangely familiar, yet it took Ned Stark a moment to place it.** ""Varys?"" he said groggily when it came."" AGOT, Eddard XV (When Varys goes to visit Ned in the Black Cells to convince him to confess)

""""Nor do I, but . . ."" **This pause was longer than the one before, and when Varys spoke again his voice was different somehow.** ""I was an orphan boy apprenticed to a traveling folly. Our master owned a fat little cog and we sailed up and down the narrow sea performing in all the Free Cities and from time to time in Oldtown and King's Landing."" ACOK, Tyrion X

""**""Far away,"" a half-familiar voice replied.**"" ADWD, Epilogue (When Varys shoots Kevan Lannister with a crossbow bolt and reveals his plans)

So, I think there's something up with his voice. We see his different voice come only when he has no need to lie, or when he's being honest about himself or something serious to his plans comes up. Maybe I'm making something out of nothing, but I think his whole flowery voice angle at least (not to mention the other aspects of his personality) is part of his act, so people think they know meddling spymaster instead of looking into his deeper plans.

So perhaps this was something in Georgie's five year gap along with other plot points that has been cut due to his removing of the planned five year gap. Five years would've been enough for the dragons to be ridden, and cause a great Second Dance.

In this conversation, it is mentioned ""If one Hand can die, why not another?""

During a first reading, we assume this refers to Jon Arryn's death and that they are suggesting Ned dying.

However, knowing that Littlefinger was the one behind Jon Arryn's death and Varys' relationship with another Hand, Jon Connington, a different perspective can be obtained.

Perhaps they meant for Ned to ""die"" as JonCon did, as in faking his death. Had Ned lived and been sent to the Wall by ship as plan, perhaps the ship would've been set upon by pirates or hit by a storm with the ship sinking and Ned presumed dead. Then Ned could've been brought across the Narrow Sea to join with JonCon and (f)Aegon. Not a bad idea, as Eddard Stark's influence and the legtimacy he brings would've proved useful as well as the support of the North.

However, I'm not fully sure on how Ned would see the situation and if he would support (f)Aegon. I can see him being persuaded, if they pressed the guilt over Elia and her children as well as Lyanna's relationship with Rhaegar (and Ned's personal knowledge of their relationship and love child). But given Ned's disdain for the Mad King and loyalty to Robert, I think he would've been a hard sell as long as Stannis and Renly lived. Though if Ned's aid was brought up after Stannis has Renly killed, Stannis' kinslaying and black magic could've been enough to convince Ned to side with Targaryen.

And from a reader standpoint, it would've been interesting to see Ned and JonCon clash, with their different relationships to the Targaryens and Rhaegar himself. Also, seeing their conflicting influences on (f)Aegon and seeing Ned switch sides to the Targs.

So, in short, I think Varys planned to have Ned's escort to the Wall to be attacked and for him to fake die so he could be turned to support (f)Aegon ala JonCon.",pureasoiaf,Varys and Ned,https://www.reddit.com/r/pureasoiaf/comments/4zedix/varys_and_ned/

So, Seven divided Kingdoms (at times even more) and multiple cultures assimilating into them wouldn't you think there'd be more language diversity? Everyone speaks the Andal Common Tongue, which is understandable that a large ammount of them would speak it but wouldn't there be bastard languages in the different Kingdoms?

And even more so, why don't we see Rhoynish spoken in Dorne or Northerners speak the Old Tongue since the First Men blood still prevails in there and their link to Beyond-The-Wall.

But everyone south of the Wall speaks the Common Tongue. I'm not asking for someone in the Reach to speak a completely different tongue than someone in the Westerlands ecspecially since the cultures sort of combined since the Conquest. But a few flavor words from the Reach compared to the Vale would've been cool or the Mountain Clans in the North speaking the Old Tongue or some such.

Our strapping Hedge Knight seems to have gotten around. Anyways, this post is about possible descendants of Ser Duncan the Tall of Fleabottom himself. I'll list of a few for your benefit, but I only believe in two of them and will point those ones out.

1) Brienne of Tarth (I believe this one). This theory suggests that Brienne is a descendent of Dunk, and here's the evidence to back it up; Brienne is big and strong. Not concrete, bit it isn't nothing. Also, though I don't have the exact quotes right now if I recall when she was getting her shield replaced the shield person asked if she wanted a design on it. She remembers a shield in her father's armory with a design like that of Dunk's. I believe sometime in Harrenhal, Jaime asked if she was thick as a castle wall or some such. Not 100% on that piece of evidence though. Also, referring to AWOIAF and our knowledge of Dunk's future can help too. One of the Targaryen girls was married off to a Tarth and had a child shortly after. However, its a bit strange that she would be married off to a subvassal, being of the royal family. The time is about the time Dunk is within the court/in the Kingsguard so I can see them hitting it off and him knocking her off and after this being found out she was quickly married off to a smaller lord, and her child thought to be Lord Tarth's could've very well been Dunk's. Also on a meta level, GRRM said there'd be a POV in AFFC thats a Dunk descendent, and Brienne is the only one that fits.

2) Hodor (I also believe this one). Like this theory and all the others this poises that Hodor is a descendent of Dunk, a great grandson in fact. In Bran's vision through the weirwood, he sees Old Nan (then a Young Nan) standing on her toes to kiss a knight taller than Hodor. And we know that Dunk is heading to Winterfell in an era that would fit with a Young Nan. The Knight being taller than Hodor, well there's only one knight in that time that would fit. Also being directly compared to Hodor can be telling, though not damning. And as mentioned, Old Nan isn't an aqquaintence of Hodor but his great grandmother so there's a blood relation.

Now here comes the ones I personally don't believe, but since I'm listing off possible descendant I figured you lot would want to decide on your own.

3) Small Paul, of the Night's Watch. Ironically named, naturally. There's a bit of evidence for this I suppose but I don't think there's enough for this minor character to be his decedent. In addition to being quite tall and large, he (like Brienne) is called thick as a castle wall. Additionally, Chett mocks him as being slower than a snail. And we can remember a certain Ser Duncan the Tall being slower on the lance than Ser Uthor Underleaf, with a snail shield. 

4) Grenn, of the Night's Watch. It'd be very coincidental if he and Small Paul were distant cousins. Not a lot of evidence, but he is mocked as being thick as a castle wall and called an auroch by Ser Alliser, and Dunk has been called an auroch on a few occassions.

5) Arryk and Erryk, Olenna's bodyguards. I forget a lot about them but ignorance has never stopped me from talking before. Olenna calls them ""Left and Right"" and they're red haired and I'm pretty sure they're freckled. Tall and strong, they could perhaps be descendents of Dunk and Rohanne Webber who was red haired and freckled. Though I doubt it, as if their ancestors were from during the time she was with Eustace, the ancestors would've been thought to be Osgrey and she wouldn't of remarried. If they came during the time of her match with Lord Lannister, then they'd be thought to be Lannisters and at a much higher station. 

6) House Clegane entirely. Not much evidence at all, just that they're big and strong. Its suggested that perhaps Dunk knocked up The Brothers Clegane's great grandmother or some such though I really doubt it due to the intense lack of evidence.

Well those are the theories on possible descendents of Dunk, though some are more believable than others. I believe 100% that Hodor and Brienne are, and though I don't think Small Paul is I wouldn't flip a table if I found out he was. Everyone else I perrsonally don't think have relation to him. Though if they're all true, then it seems Dunk took a few pointers from Egg the 4th.

TL;DR: Brienne and Hodor are Dunk descendents, and maybe but probably not Small Paul, Grenn, Arryk and Erryk and House Clegane.",pureasoiaf,Dunk the Hunk,https://www.reddit.com/r/pureasoiaf/comments/4xm4u8/dunk_the_hunk/

In ADWD that is.

In his vastly exciting and entertaining fight with Talbert Serry, Vicky catches his foe's sword in his HAND. Which despite being massively kool with a k, left quite the gash in his hand. And of course Vicky has the whole tough guy mantra, doing not too much to disinfect it and has no interest in seeing a maester about it.

Throughout the book, the wound festers and gets progressively worse and worse and becomes very infected. 

Eventually, when he meets Morrquo he offers to heal his hand with fire magic. Victarion eventually accepts as his infection has gotten out of...hand.

We do not see what happens during the ritual, and in one of the few points in the series it shifts away from a perspective. The pespective doesn't focus on Vicky and his thoughts or any other character and their thoughts, but outside of the cabin where the ritual is occuring and describing everything that happens there.

So this leads me to question not only what happened in the cabin, but why did the perspective shift at all?

Perhaps Victarion's infection got so bad that during the ritual he died, and Morroquo brought him back to life. And during the period in which Victarion is dead, the perspective shifts away from him before going back to him after his resurrection.

During the ritual it shifts;

""The iron captain was not seen again that day, but as the hours passed the crew of his Iron Victory reported hearing the sound of wild laughter coming from the captain's cabin, laughter deep and dark and mad, and when Longwater Pyke and Wulfe One-Eye tried the cabin door they found it barred. Later singing was heard, a strange high wailing song in a tongue the maester said was High Valyrian. That was when the monkeys left the ship, screeching as they leapt into the water.""

And after it, it goes back to his perspective when he has his new hand;

""Come sunset, as the sea turned black as ink and the swollen sun tinted the sky a deep and bloody red, Victarion came back on deck. He was naked from the waist up, his left arm blood to the elbow. As his crew gathered, whispering and trading glances, he raised a charred and blackened hand. Wisps of dark smoke rose from his fingers as he pointed at the maester. ""That one. Cut his throat and throw him in the sea, and the winds will favor us all the way to Meereen."" Moqorro had seen that in his fires. He had seen the wench wed too, but what of it? She would not be the first woman Victarion Greyjoy had made a widow.""

It has been established that Red Priests can bring people back to life, so this isn't a big stretch to make.

And to add a little more to it, however little this evidence may add;

He turned to the black man. ""Did the Vole speak true? You saw my death?""
""That, and more.""

.....(f?)Aegon

At the end of ADWD, (f?)Aegon VI has descended into the Stormlands with the Golden Company and has taken Griffin's Roost among other small but significant victories.

We know that the Martells seek a Targaryen alliance and will no doubt seek an alliance with Elia Martell's (supposed?) son especially after Daenerys spurned Quentyn. And my beloved JonCon proposed a similar idea to Haldon, and as we saw from TWOW sample chapter Arianne means to present her hand in marriage to (f?)Aegon as an alliance between him and Dorne.
This all makes sense, though is there perhaps something the Martells have to....sweeten the deal?

Flashback to the Daeron I's Conquest of Dorne. In it, he eventually is killed under peace negotions by the Dornish. Blackfyre and the crown of Aegon I are taken. Later, Blackfyre is given back to the Targaryens but the crown is never recovered. At this point you know where this is heading, but indulge me a little longer.
Blackfyre was eventually taken by the Blackfyres across the Narrow Sea into the Golden Company. And there is enough evidence for me to believe that the Golden Company will present (f?)Aegon with the sword, to add to his political legitimacy. It would be harder to doubt him as a true Targaryen if he wields the family sword.

So to go back to the original point, I believe the Martells will present (f?)Aegon with Aegon I's crown. I doubt the crown was lost in the sand and the Dornish instead kept hold of it, whether as a trophy or spit ore some other reason.

But why would (f?)Aegon want a crown? He could easily have one made.

Well the answer is obvious, of course. It would add to his legitimacy. He would be seen by many more as a true Targaryen King if he is wearing the crown of Aegon the Dragon himself, a crown long lost from the Targaryen dynasty. Not only that, it would just be nice to have back in the family.

So, with Blackfyre and Aegon I's crown, (f?)Aegon's political legitimacy and recognition as a true Targaryen will be much greater and help people rally behind him in his invasion.
I hope you like this theory, came up with it after rereading Daeron I's chapter in AWOIAF.

We know that the Martells seek a Targaryen alliance and will no doubt seek an alliance with Elia Martell's (supposed?) son especially after Daenerys spurned Quentyn. And my beloved JonCon proposed a similar idea to Haldon, and as we saw from TWOW sample chapter Arianne means to present her hand in marriage to (f?)Aegon as an alliance between him and Dorne.

This all makes sense, though is there perhaps something the Martells have to....sweeten the deal?

Flashback to the Daeron I's Conquest of Dorne. In it, he eventually is killed under peace negotions by the Dornish. Blackfyre and the crown of Aegon I are taken. Later, Blackfyre is given back to the Targaryens but the crown is never recovered. At this point you know where this is heading, but indulge me a little longer.

Blackfyre was eventually taken by the Blackfyres across the Narrow Sea into the Golden Company. And there is enough evidence for me to believe that the Golden Company will present (f?)Aegon with the sword, to add to his political legitimacy. It would be harder to doubt him as a true Targaryen if he wields the family sword.

So to go back to the original point, I believe the Martells will present (f?)Aegon with Aegon I's crown. I doubt the crown was lost in the sand and the Dornish instead kept hold of it, whether as a trophy or spit ore some other reason.

But why would (f?)Aegon want a crown? He could easily have one made.

Well the answer is obvious, of course. It would add to his legitimacy. He would be seen by many more as a true Targaryen King if he is wearing the crown of Aegon the Dragon himself, a crown long lost from the Targaryen dynasty. Not only that, it would just be nice to have back in the family. 

So, with Blackfyre and Aegon I's crown, (f?)Aegon's political legitimacy and recognition as a true Targaryen will be much greater and help people rally behind him in his invasion.

I hope you like this theory, came up with it after rereading Daeron I's chapter in AWOIAF.

As we've seen in the ""THE FORESAKEN"" sample chapter released, Euron has come across Valyrian Steel armor.

Valyrian Steel armor, now how COOL is that?

It is described dark as smoke, as other Valryian steel objects are. We know full well that Valyrian Steel and Dragonglass are the only things able to kill an Other, so it stands to reason Valyrian Steel armor is the only thing that can withstand their swords. Now besides Euron, a demon in man's skin, who would have use for such an armor? Well, to clarify, who would have best use for it? Maybe someone fighting Others? And going by the basically confirmed theory that Jon Snow is Azor Ahai reborn, he'll be on the front lines of fighting the Others.

Now, Jon has a dream in which he is fighting the army of the dead and the following quote comes up;

""Jon was armored in black ice, but his blade burned red in his fist. As the dead men reached the top of the Wall he sent them down to die again.""

His armor is black, and what other special armor is a dark color? Why Euron's of course. So I pose with a tinfoil hat on that somehow Euron's armor will get to Jon and armed with Lightbringer and the armor he will be at best ability to fight back the Others. I mean, Euron's armor should have SOME use other than being cool, right?

And to get exxxxtra tinfoily;the dream also has Jon fighting his friends and family:

""He slew a greybeard and a beardless boy, a giant, a gaunt man with filed teeth, a girl with thick red hair. Too late he recognized Ygritte. She was gone as quick as she'd appeared. The world dissolved into a red mist. Jon stabbed and slashed and cut. He hacked down Donal Noye and gutted Deaf Dick Follard. Qhorin Halfhand stumbled to his knees, trying in vain to staunch the flow of blood from his neck. ""I am the Lord of Winterfell,"" Jon screamed. It was Robb before him now, his hair wet with melting snow. Longclaw took his head off.""

So perhaps by the time the Others break through the Wall and Jon becomes fully realized in his destiny as Azor Ahai the Others will have risen the dead not only Beyond-The-Wall but South of it as well, having Jon to fight his former friends and family.

TL;DR: Tinfoil, when Jon becomes Azor Ahai he'll be armored in Euron's valyrian armor and be fighting his dead friends and family.

He was left for dead after infection from wounds. Going by the Gravedigger theory (if you don't know here's the fast forward;)

Elder Brother finds him and nurses him back to health and he is the huge silent Gravedigger at Quiet Isle, digging a grave for each man he killed. Elder Brother says the Hound is dead, but doesn't refer to him as Sandor like he had (similar to his own metaphor for his rebirth at Trident). The horse Stranger is at Quiet Isle, known to be uncontrolable for anyone but Sandor. The Gravedigger is huge, taller than Brienne and kneels to pet Dog (which some think is a reference to his identity). The theory suggests that the Hound is dead and Sandor has found peace.

By this theory Sandor is still alive and kicking. But what about Gregor? I think we have all deduced that Ser Robert Strong is in fact an undead form of the Mountain, created by Qyburn. In fact other characters such as Kevan Lannister hint towards this being their guess too.

Two Cleganes, dead and alive at once.

I believe they will meet again, and have their duel that has always meant to occur. But how?
Sandor will be sent into the Riverlands to protect the people or some such, eventually falling in with the Brotherhood Without Banners. Ser Robert Strong will dominate in Cersei's trial by combat. And given that his mission is to destroy her enemies, a nasty thorn in her side and the crown's has been the BwB. Once the whole Trial By Combat situation is dealt with, she will award Ser Robert Strong Robert Baratheon's warhammer and send him into the Riverlands to bring the Brotherhood down.
And so Ser Robert Strong will pillage the Riverlands a second time, rooting out and destroying the Brotherhood and their sympathizers. He will eventually come across their lair in the Hollow Hill, where he means to kill them once and for all. But Sandor, the Gravedigger steps in to protect them.
While many have denounced this theory for a CleganeVClegane as it wouldn't make sense for Sandor's arc, I have a reasonable explanation. To show Sandor's growth, this duel isn't for vengeance and hate. He fights his brother to protect others, not for himself. And upon seeing his brother a twisted undead abomination he also does it for mercy. So Sandor doesn't fight his brother for rage and hate as he once would, but for duty and peace.

But this is all well and good, but Ser Robert Strong is not only STRONG, but undead. And whats the only thing we have seen that can kill undead (referring to Wights, not Others)? Fire. And who can arm Sandor with a fire weapon?

 Thoros of Myr, a founding member of the Brotherhood Without Banners.

So not only would it be interesting to see two dead Cleganes fight eachother, Sandor fighting for peace instead of hate but we also see Sandor armed with his very fear; fire.
And so this is how I believe the two will meet. And I believe Sandor will win this fight, completing his arc from hateful and bitter to peaceful and savoir of the people. Killing his brother not for hate, but for duty.

And Ser Robert's weapon, Robert Baratheon's warhammer lies next to his dead body, with a certain bastard in the Brotherhood drawn to it. None other than one Gendry Waters, picking up his father's warhammer, but thats another theory for another day....

He throws his reputation into the dirt for Varys' and Illyrio's plan just because he'll be able to help Rhaegar's son. Even when he gets greyscale (saving Tyrion, someone whom gave him no reason to love him and is the son of the man who had Rhaegar's family murdered) he doesn't become bitter and angry. Instead he doubles down on his motivation, his motivation to see Rhaegar's son on the throne, not even caring about his own well being. Granted, he does has some short comings (stubborness, pride, etc.) but his love and loyalty for a man who died sixteen years ago is his defining quality. The heir of the Vale even fell to his sword, and perhaps he could've ended the rebellion had he faced Robert (I doubt it though). He had loved too hard, dared too much and reached too far. What're you guys' thoughts on the beloved (hopefully) Griff? PS; If any of you guys have quality JonCon fanart I'd love to see it, I've yet to be able to find any.

Jon's desicion in his tenure as LC are controversial, between his meddling with Southron politics and deals with the Wildlings (or Freefolk depending on which side of the Wall you are). 

Would Jeor make the same desicions as Jon? Would Ned? Would they support his desicions or condemn them?
I think Ned would follow Jon's stances on wildlings and such, and its hard to say on his view on Stannis given his loyalty to his oath and his loyalty to Robert and his own family. I think Jeor would be harsher with the wildings, but what do you think?

To summarize some of Jon's desicions, for better or for worse, here are some that follow;

1) Letting the Wildlings through the Wall

2) Arming and training the Wildlings, as well as populating some ruined castles with them

3) Executing Janos Slynt

4) Forging a deal with the Iron Bank

5) Allowing Stannis to maintain a place at the Wall

6) Giving Stannis military advice

7) Having Mance sneak into Winterfell with Spear Wives

8) Making all branches of the Night's Watch have at least basic bow and arrow training

9) Switching Gilly's and Mance's babies

10) Declaring his march to Winterfell and actively trying to recruit Black Brothers to follow him

Those are just some I remember, though there are probably more.

When I try and trigger the events that previously worked well in the commands, it says the event does not exist. I have tested swapping places of the events in their position and they work well when near the top. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, as the events all work when this problem doesn't occur and it all looks good except where they happen to be placed, but then again I'm a sweet summer child when it comes to modding.

Now, all of his life Tyrion has been sneered at looked down upon (literally and figuratively) for being a dwarf, and never has been treated with respect. However, in the scene when Dany pins the Hand's badge on Tyrion, she is treating him with honor and true genuine respect, something he has never gotten. And in that scene, Tyrion is standing on the bench or stair within the Great Pyramid, making him almost of the height of Dany, and making him eye to eye level as her. So in that scene where he is treated as a regular person for the first time, he is also shown to appear to be the same height as her, an equal ala the giant shadow on the wall scene. Just an interesting thought I had about the scene, could be inferring too much.
