9,I liken the current version of Renolock to control warrior before WoTG. Leeroy PO faceless is like Grom + cruel task and Jaraxxus is like Elise. I think it's beneficial to have multiple finishers as control vs control can go two ways. It's either you responding to their threats in which case you usually use faceless PO or Leeroy to clear or fight for the board so Jaraxxus is the win condition.. But then there's games where you're in control and they are answering your threats. These are the games where the combo is awesome because it finishes games when they are fighting for board.,2016-05-22 00:50:25+00:00,d3ep9cj,1,t3_4kee2w,28382,CompetitiveHS

16,Ben Brode is an absolute hero. Blizzard takes a lot of shit for being unresponsive to the community and they are for the most part but this guy doesn't care. He knows he and the rest of the design team made a largely controversial decision and he took it head on and added some clarity. The card does suck now but he at least gave valid reasons for nerfing this particular card and nerfing it in the fashion they did.,2015-10-14 22:45:59+00:00,cvzzdsu,1,t3_3os4x5,1516,hearthstone
