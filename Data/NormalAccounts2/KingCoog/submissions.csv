Shes 19, has an american warm-blood who is also 19 years old. She rides English on a college equestrian team. Unfortunately I don't know a bunch about horses so I'm not sure exactly what to get her for Christmas. I was hoping you nice people could help me think of ideas! Anything helps! Thank you!

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the replies! I have decided I am going to help build her horse a new paddock as a gift. She has been saying he needs a new one for a while and while its not the most glamerous gift i think she will appreciate it. Thank you again for the replies.",Equestrian,Looking for a perfect gift for my SO,https://www.reddit.com/r/Equestrian/comments/3vrj2t/looking_for_a_perfect_gift_for_my_so/
