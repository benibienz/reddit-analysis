Fury X I brought up from 1050/500 to 1160/570.

Yeah, the new version would definitely be nice to have but I only paid $500 for my 341 without flaws, so I'm happy. 342 does have the different curve, which is preference but I think I would like it. Smaller freesync range. QC bounds and leagues better than the 341 though. Cheers to you but I would not be able to afford full price for one of these 1440p ultrawides for quite a while

44,"I'm powering an XR341CK with a 6700k @ 4.7, 32gb 3200mhz DDR4, and a Fury X with custom BIOS and a pretty high overclock.

Heroes of the Storm is nothing at all to max at over 75fps, same for Overwatch which I run usually around 140-160fps at 2560x1440. GTA V and Witcher 3 maxed (including hair works and some mods on both) I usually hover 50-80. With freesync, this is all butter smooth.

Sadly, WoW is most of what I play now and it's much more graphically intensive than ever before now. Maxed with only FXAA for AA, I will always be around 120+ in instances, battlegrounds, and arena. However, anywhere in the open world in the Broken Isles, I'm now hovering around 35-50 most of the time. Looking at the floor, I jump back to 100+ so it must be the extensive shadows and lighting with HBAO. If I turned down these settings rather than keeping everything besides AA maxed, I could probably bring it back to at least avg 60. Indoors is also 100+.

WoW is actually the most demanding game I've come across, feeling much less smooth now than even GTA V and Witcher 3 were for me. May have to do with the fast camera movement compared to those games as well though.

169,"I've had both SLI 980's and an R9 295x2 at 1440p 144/100hz. I would say that for the most part, CF/SLI is not worth it. It can introduce microstutter, hitches, and other bugs that one card alone doesn't have.

Personally, I sold my 295x2 and picked up a 390 to hold me over until next year's cards. Then I'll sell the 390, and pick up the next gen flagship.

If you are still set on CF however, it does scale pretty well. I've seen people say that CF 390s would run similar to a 295x2, and the 390s have a lot more overclocking headroom - you can bring an OC 390 to around stock 390x levels, so I would look at stock crossfire 390x 4k reviews and expect around that performance. The consensus on the 390/x's is Sapphire is best cooling, and MSI is best overclocking since the heatsink contacts the VRM's directly. I have my MSI sitting at 1125 core/1650 memory with only +60mV compared to 1000/1500 stock, and that's with the LE (not binned as well) version.

173,"Well, it doesn't weigh a ton, but I am looking for something thinner and lighter that I can bring around for school. I'd even want an ultrabook, as now I only need something for school.

The 965m is significantly faster than an 860m (it plays GTA V/Witcher 3 on high/ultra mixed with med shadows at 60fps) and the 1080p matte IPS display on it is amazing. In every game I've played and from what I've read, the 965m will still be a bottleneck before the i5-4210h is. The i7 is faster, but I've had no gripes performance wise.

But yeah, I never play games on it since I only ever game on my desktop af home... So a thinner/lighter device would be ideal for me.
