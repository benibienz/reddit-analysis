***// Copying everything over from my previous listing with these items. Only thing to consider is that I'm using some of the caps from the KC84 on my slider swapped HHKB for now until my massdrop set comes in, but as soon as the board sells I will swap the caps back onto the KC84 and have it sent out the same day. Also lowered price on the Model F a bit.***

It was configured with a 1TB HDD, but I've added a 128gb M.2 SSD strictly for the OS and important programs. The speed difference compared to original is ridiculous. It boots in seconds.

The few times I've played games on this, it exceeded my expectations. 60 fps on a mix of Ultra/High settings with medium shadows at 1080p on a laptop was astounding. The 1080p Matte IPS display is gorgeous as well.

I paid ~1200 plus tax for this. A new one configured from Dell is $1200 plus tax as well, but comes with a Skylake i5 with a slower clock speed. It also doesn't come with the SSD, making it much slower to use. After tax, that would come out to around $1300 + more for the SSD.

Unfortunately Bricked my 3DS attempting to downgrade it, and played it for maybe 10 hours since buying it as I was just waiting for CFW/downgrade ability. So everything works except the motherboard. The console itself is wrapped in a satin clear Skinomi protector.

Its a shame to lose a beautiful handheld :(

Asking for $110 shipped for everything, so I get almost $100 for everything. I think that's fair for asking basically $70 for the parts 3DS, and $30 for New Leaf, R4i, and a USB charging cable for the 3DS. If its not in line with what pricing should be, let me know.

Originally I believed my 4.6 @ 1.251 was stable, and it maxed at 70 degrees Celsius at peak during x264. However, after 8 hours it finally crashed. 

I've been continuously testing and it's been running for 9 hours so far at 1.28 and hopefully this is the golden number. Even 1.275 crashed for me. However, now my temps are maxing at 74 Celsius.

http://i.imgur.com/4yz8dCK.png

 I do want to try to stay at 70 or lower, and at this voltage/clock my card seems to be running hotter than some others. Is there anything I could try doing? All settings on the cooler are at high performance, and even running the fans at 100% didn't seem to help much (at least for Max peak temps). I'm running in a Corsair 760t full tower with 2 140mm and 1 120mm intake, and 3 120mm exhausts. The case is very cold with airflow, and the air coming out of my radiator in the H100i is cool as well. 

Do you have any suggestions for lowering temps a bit? Or are these temps safe, since the averages for cores 0-3 are 59, 65, 60, and 56 and this is during a stress test for stability? Want to guarantee this stable 24/7 OC can at least last me another 3-4 years.

Description of Problem: Whenever I play Battlefield 4, textures take up to a minute to go from muddy, undefined messes to becoming actual textures. GTA V makes it seem as if the draw distance is set to minimum when I have it maxed, and buildings and cars continually change the way they look as I get closer to them and they'll pop in out of nowhere as well once they're loaded. Witcher 3 also has texture loading problems where as I'm moving, I'll see textures change the way they look constantly as I move toward/around them. It's very distracting and makes it feel as if I'm playing on a console with minimum draw distance.

I can only really scrounge up the 3k to my name but I'll give it all to someone who can bite me when I'm on in around 45 minutes!

Here's some pics for reference: http://imgur.com/a/Jybr2

I've got an i7-4790k cooled by a 240mm Corsair H100i GTX and an R9 295x2. That's my first concern with essentially one 240mm space needed for the cpu radiator and another 120mm for the GPU.

My other concern is that I have one SSD for my OS and two more HDD's for storage, and I doubt I could fit that many drives in an mITX. I could downsize to one SSD and one HDD, but even that might not be feasible.

I really like the Silverstone SG13 and it would be my go to choice if it weren't for all my radiator needs!

School and work come first, so I need a car I can drive.


First, I'm selling my Alienware 15 like new, i5-4210H @ 2.9GHz, GTX 965M, 8GB RAM, and 1TB HDD and I also added in a 128GB m.2 SSD that I put the OS on. The cheapest I see these new is on Amazon for $1179 without the SSD. I'm going to ask $1000 shipped, which is decent imo for an almost flawless (only one small sliver flex on the bottom SSD/RAM cover from when I added the SSD and it wouldn't come off) laptop, and it hasn't given me any problems at all. After fees, shipping, and insurance, not sure how much I'll actually make but hopefully enough. I do have all original packaging.


Second, I'm selling an R9 295x2. I bought it from someone else on here and it came with no box, and I love it, but it has to go. $500 shipped. I'll package it in an anti-static bag and very heavily with bubble air packs.


Third, a Wii U 32GB Console with a Gamestop Wii U Pro controller, and Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate and Dark Souls 2 on the console itself. No other games. $200 shipped. I have all original packaging.


I always ship USPS priority with insurance, and package very over-protectively.
Thanks guys, hope you can help me out and you can all get some new hardware!
