24,"I am having trouble understanding your first paragraph.

&gt;Christ's death was sufficient or it was not.  You don't get a choice after that.  You are saved or you are not. 

Christ's death and resurrection was sufficient. One may choose to embrace that and have a relationship with God, or one may choose not to. It's that easy. You do have a choice. You have a relationship with God our you do not.

&gt;I realize that it is distasteful to you that ""bad"" or perhaps just the ""wrong"" people could end up in heaven with you and you need to construct this elaborate set of hoops to jump through where Christ's death can be good enough for you but somehow keep the undesirables out - but it is shitty theology, and it is far too easy to find yourself on the wrong side of it.

There's no elaborate set of hoops. You don't have to burn offerings to attone for your sins. You don't have to raise your hands during worship service or pray a certain way. There are two commandments that Jesus calls important. Love the Lord your God with all of your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and the second is like it; love your neighbor as yourself.

Most importantly, we believe that Jesus paid much too high a price for us to pick and choose who should come. I don't care what people have done, I just want them to share in the love of Jesus. It's not about what you've done, it's about a change in your heart to have a relationship with God.

Remember the line. The paper touches every point of the line simultaneously. Take the line away, and the paper has no measure by which it can say, ""this line is too long.""

God doesn't move through time like we do, nor will we when we reach the Pearly Gates

&gt;Seems really arrogant.

Well that's just, like, your opinion, man.

But actual rebuttal. We don't worship as a form of ""God accept me because I need you!""

We worship because we have a relationship with God and just love Him. He doesn't command us to worship, it's just how we show our love and commitment to Him. Because it's a byproduct of our relationship, God likes it. It's not arrogant to accept roses from a husband, or to let your daughter paint your nails.

That last bit is exactly what Heaven will be like. It's where God lives. God, by the Christian definition, invented time *from outside of time and space*. Take a piece of paper and draw a straight line on it. Our perception of time, the history and future of the universe, is represented by that line. God is everything else; the paper, the table you drew it on, the pen used to draw it, etc.

As for what I'll be doing, praising God and fellowshipping with people who want to do that too haha. It sounds dull to someone who doesn't want to do that, and I understand.

There's no way for me to gain God's ""favor"" because he loves everyone just the same; unconditionally. His mind is made up regarding how he feels about us. Look at it as a loving mother and her child. The child may eventually choose to be apart from the mother, but nothing the child does in that ordeal will change the mother's love.

Why must everything I do be beneficial to only me? People who don't believe God's Word do selfless things, why does it suddenly become selfish if it's our way of showing our love toward God?",2016-05-15 22:02:48+00:00,d36s2iu,9.0,t1_d352s2u,134595.0,news

God loves all of us very much and wants to be with us, which is why He made the sacrifice as Jesus. That makes it very simple for us to live with Him forever if we so choose.

If, on this Earth, you choose not to live with Him in your life, He respects your decision and will not force you to live with Him forever in Heaven. Instead, there is a place that God doesn't live.

94,"I've surfed a few times. I don't ever use it as a dating site, but through couchsurfing I have had a few dates. Normally a friend of a host or someone I clicked with at a meetup.

That said, I had one time in Java, Indonesia where I put up a public trip (so hosts can offer me a place to stay if I'm having trouble finding one) and had a host lined up who canceled last minute. I messaged a few others who offered and the only one to reply was a female, I'll call her D. She was cute, but it wasn't a factor.

So I get to the city and she picks me up from the train station. We get back to the ranch and she shows me around. I got a guest house that's not attached to the main house by a door, but a wall. (You have to go outside to get there). We sat to chat and have tea. There is obvious interest in her questions, and in the way she would laugh and touch my arm or slap my knee.

She went to a class and I stayed behind to work on my blog. When she got back we went to find some food, then went back to watch a movie in the main room. She had changed into some pretty skimpy shorts, and she looked dang good. When the movie was over, she asked if she should tuck me in to bed, and I agreed.

We got to my room, sat for a minute chatting, I kissed her, and things got hot. She was a virgin (very normal in Indonesia to save for marriage), so didn't want me to get it out. But I had her down to only a bra and traced the alphabet with my tongue, ifyaknowhatimean.

""D?"" Ah fuck. Her dad was there. I did not know that. He called from just outside, no doubt heard my name a couple times before intervening. ""D?""

So I apologize and had to leave at 2am. I walked out onto the street, but this was a big city, I had no idea where to go. I started walking and a guy stopped on a motorbike asking if I needed help. I said I need Wi-Fi to find accomodation, and he took me to McDonald's. I found a hostel on hostelworld that says 24 hour reception, so I got a taxi to there and when I got inside, the security explained that it just means there's someone present who works there 24hours. But in the night it's security and not reception. That pissed me off. They allowed me to sleep on a couch in the common area. I left the city the next day. Apparently she got some kind of a virginity test to make sure her father believed we didn't get it in.

I've since decided not to have any intimate relations with hosts. Even if I'm not walked in on, it could be awkward the next morning.

Tinder, on the other hand, has been pretty good for dates in the road, sometimes a free night or two with a happy ending.

If we want the whole world on board with this, which we need if we want to be successful, there are a few steps. 

One, reduce production. So much waste is produced, and in many countries they can't help it. Water can only be bought in plastic bottles, because any other water will make you sick. On top of that, you have plastic to-go food trays with plastic forks and knives in their own little plastic bag. Plastic wrap around a pack of biscuits, and then reach sleeve of biscuits has it's own plastic wrap, and then those are split into groups of four.

Second, education at a young age. They aren't quite taught it in school the effects of pollution. Even when schools do teach them, not all children go to school.

And then we have to clean up what older generations have already done. ",2016-01-02 03:00:17+00:00,cyiwvno,2.0,t1_cyidss6,35548.0,technology

185,"Yeah, type the countrt you're in and the country you'd like to go to. When you search, it will give you a list of destinations sorted by price, in which Auckland will normally be the lowest when the country is New Zealand. Then when you select the city you're going to it will take you to a list of starting cities that will be sorted by price, just find a city near you. Alternatively, you can just use, for instance, San Diego (any) in the search, and it will search airports around SD. When selecting date choose ""cheapest month"" on the website or in the app I believe it just says ""any day"" and it will automatically find the cheapest flights in the next 12 months, which is most likely about three to five months away. If you want to go 12 months from now, I would suggest making a solid plan for the next few months but without set-in-stone dates, then buy the ticket about three or four months from the date of travel. Set up price alerts so you can find when it goes below $X, and don't be scared to buy when you think it's low but might go lower. Last thing you want is for it to be low but get higher when you wait a day. I've been there, completely changed my plans.

212,"First of all, the distances in America are greater than you seen to be understanding. NYC to Washington DC is about the same distance as London to Manchester. Might be a few hours on greyhound bus, which I don't recommend to anyone who doesn't absolutely need it. Flying is the only practical way to get to Chicago or Indiana from the east coast, especially if you want to spend more time at your destination than traveling to it, and if you only have a couple weeks to travel.

The budget will do, but it will be full of fast food instead of actual good food. Shake Shack in NYC is a fantastic place to get a burger, but it will set you back $15, as well as most good local restaurants will. If you figure in the flights you have to take to get to Chicago and back, or any flight really, your budget will hurt. General rule of backpacking: lay out on your bed all of the clothes you plan to bring and all of the money you plan to budget. Now, leave half of the clothes and bring twice the money.

My advice is to limit your traveling to one area, such as NJ, NY, and PA. Even that is pushing it, it's a little less than one week per state which is hardly enough to see everything notable. If you're going to uni here, maybe take that three weeks to intensely explore Chicago and the surrounding area, then while at uni just go around the Northeast on weekends or something. Don't try to fit too much into your itinerary or you'll not enjoy much of it. ",2015-06-24 00:33:29+00:00,csgjgh4,1.0,t3_3aw393,3199.0,backpacking
