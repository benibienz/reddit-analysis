I know that I want to finish up a month here, which will be three more weeks. I have a few options for what to do next but I have no idea what I want to do the most. What do you do in these situations to be most comfortable with the one that you choose? 

(After typing everything below, I want to emphasize that I'm looking for a helpful method, not an answer. Stick generally to the title of the post in comments. But helping me find the pros and cons is appreciated!)

Maybe /r/travel can help me decide. The biggest factor is budget, mind you, which is why I include the probable timeframe for each option. I need to return home in spring for personal commitments, so the option of teaching English or bartending to replenish funds and do all the options is out. I'm five months deep in SEA, been to the island nations, Thailand, and now Myanmar. So, starting the first of February, should I:

Go to Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia for one month each to take my time and enjoy the culture like in Indonesia (where I spent two months and stayed in the homes of local people), and head home April-ish. Safest option for budget, but I might be getting a little tired of very similar southeast Asian villages, jungle, and ""hello friend/mister/boss, where you going? Taxi?""

L, V, C all kind of quickly (I took off with a goal of all ASEAN nations so I want to do these even if briefly), then Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh, and Nepal, home late-april, early may. This one tests my shoestring limits, but is extremely attractive to me. Biggest downside is that i would want a couple months for India at least, not to mention time for trekking in Nepal, a week or two in Bangladesh, and a month in Sri Lanka. So the timeframe isn't ideal.

Go live in Indonesia while I work on my blog before juggling it with daily work in the States, because a girl just asked if I want to split rent with her while she does an internship in Bali, get home in april. The girl is a small factor, but mainly I just really loved Indonesian culture and people (yes even Bali, get the pitchforks). I'm trying to do a blog but I'm just so far behind and need to sit down and type for a while to catch up. It would be excellent to do this before getting back to the nine-to-five. Also, I feel myself getting a little road-weary after five months. I take far more naps now than I did a few months ago. It would be nice to settle down for a bit. Before I go back to home life. But I will maybe feel like I'm wasting my time abroad by not going anywhere new every few weeks. 

Go to Europe because my best friend is lonely while solo traveling but that means I'll come home much sooner than planned due to budget, home early March, but will share wonderful experiences with my best friend.

They might not actually be roads at all because I don't know much about how dive operators price things depending on if you're certified or not.

Should I just pay for each individual dive and rent stuff, or should I get a certification? How much does it cost to just rent equipment? I'm currently traveling southeast Asia, a few days away from taking two months through Indonesia and Timor L'este, and on a shoestring budget. So the hefty chunk of certification cash will be an issue. But, after six or eight dives, the certification will pay for itself. My math here is that one dive is between US$35-60 or so, and certification can be around $300-350. So the question at this point: will a certification save me any money if I still have to rent gear for every dive (since the gear obviously won't fit in my backpack), or will I still have to pay a bunch for every dive after certification?

If the latter, then I'll probably pass on certification for now and try again when I can save some money for it specifically. This trip, it was sort of a last minute ""oh, that'd be neat.""

Everyone probably knows Skyscanner and Couchsurfing because they show up in every other thread. AirBNB and HouseTrip are not really worth it because hostels and couchsurfing are so dang cheap and free, respectively. What about house sitting services? And things like HelpX that might help.

 I looked into a ship crew finder site which might be an interesting experience, but I've never sailed before or anything so I don't know how well I'll get on there. What about a similar thing for private pilots or anything?

Are there good sites for meeting up with other backpackers and maybe splitting an AirBNB or something to make it cheaper? I'm interested in a thing in Indonesia where a captain will tour you around Komodo and Rinca, and it can get pretty cheap if multiple people sign up and split the cost to hire a guide. I'm going early-to-mid October. *wink*

What about ground transportation? Are there any sites that you can put up a virtual hitchhikers sign or something along those lines? I read about a ""move my car"" service where people need a vehicle moved long distance and pay (maybe it was without compensation) for travelers to move it.

There's no watermark, and a reverse image search just pulls up poems about Jesus. If there's no information available, can I use the image? How can I find information about the photographer?

I really need something to protect my nose, ears, and neck from the sun while I'm backpacking Southeast Asia. The reviews and price of this one are all looking nice, but I'm wondering if the hat will. I'm 6', Caucasian, and have a larger-than-average beard (a little past my collar bones). I keep the sides of my head trimmed at around a 2 or 3 length of that matters. I'm likely be wearing t-shirts, but I only wear charcoal/gray colors with like a design on the front. Shorts are going to be Light green, a little darker than khaki, and one that's plaid dark brown and tan.

Using this information, do you recommend any other hat styles? I'm ready terrible at knowing what kind of hat looks alright on me, because I'm not usually a hat person. But I really need the sun protection. Thank you for any advice you can offer!

P.S. Shaving isn't the answer. Please comment on how I currently maintain myself, not how I could change my beard.
