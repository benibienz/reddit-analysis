0,One of my players in our low level game is a witch who was feeling like once she did her two hexes in combat she had nothing else to contribute aside from a crossbow which wasn't that fun for her. I let her substitute eldritch blast for one of her cantrips and when she gains hexes she can choose to gain some of the 5e warlock's invocations instead. I told her when we implemented it that it was subject to change if it seemed too OP. It's changed the playstyle from a buff class to more of a nuker but she likes it a lot more now. She really likes the flavor of the witch class which is why she picked it over a sorcerer or wizard originally.,2016-02-29 16:24:04+00:00,d0i60yu,1,t3_48aktq,4950,Pathfinder_RPG
