I finished up and received my Associate's in Comp Sci in 2014 and had started towards my Bachelor's but some life happened and I'm currently not able to go back an finish. After I got my Associate's, I put out a bunch of applications but it seems that no one wants to hire someone without either a Bachelor's or work experience (the eternal dilemma). Anyway, I haven't been coding much since then but I want to get back to it and actually use some of the knowledge that I paid to learn in a job and hopefully kickstart a career.

In school I learned the basics of C++ then we started doing more advanced stuff with Java. We also went over some HTML/CSS  (which I imagine is out of date since HTML5 but I'm not sure). I've also messed around with Python, Javascript, PHP, and C#. 

Since it's been a while since I've used any of this I was looking to do some projects on my own to help me get back into it and boost my resume. Any ideas on what websites I should use or what sort of projects would be good to do that? Should I focus on one language or a few? 

Side note: Should I look into SQL? I hear DBAs make a pretty decent amount and I'm not sure if that will get me into the field faster.

Thanks for the help!",learnprogramming,Need help getting back into it and buffing my resume,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/4eb1js/need_help_getting_back_into_it_and_buffing_my/

I'm looking to join an existing group with an open space or a new group. I'd like to play in a long running campaign but I'm fine with shorter adventures too. The time slot I'm looking for is during the day on Mondays and Tuesdays. 

I've been playing 3.5 and Pathfinder for about 4 years and I'm currently GM'ing a Pathfinder game. I'm familiar with 5E rules and I have the core books just haven't played yet.

Let me know if you've got room for one more!",lfg,"[online][5E, Pathfinder][EST]Looking to join a group for the long haul",https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/45nls2/online5e_pathfinderestlooking_to_join_a_group_for/

I have spare time during the day on Mondays and Tuesdays so I'm looking to play online! 

I've played 3.5E and as I said I GM Pathfinder so I know that too but I haven't had a chance to try 5E yet so I'd really like to play that but either of the others is fine too. I'd prefer a long running weekly campaign but I'm fine with something shorter too. I'm flexible with classes and I'm willing to fill a role if needed.

I recently made a Roll20 account and I have Skype but I can look into other programs too if you're using something else.

* Gaming and work. I'll mostly be playing games like Diablo 3, World of Warcraft, Skyrim, and similar titles. My work I can pretty much do with any web browser and Microsoft Office

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

* $400

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

* As soon as I can 

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

* I have a few parts that are still in good condition: case, RAM, PSU, and possibly a graphics card but that should probably be updated.

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

* US - DE. No Microcenter access

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

* I made a list of what I'd like to reuse to help save money. http://pcpartpicker.com/p/PwdjdC  I also have a Sparkle 1gb GTX 550Ti card that I'd like to upgrade if possible but can be reused for now. I can update at a later point

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

* Not likely

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

* Nothing specific

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* I already have a mid-tower so I guess thats my preference

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

* Windows 7 - 10, whatever's cheaper

&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**

As I said, I'd like to reuse as much as I can to help save money but if something can be replaced for fairly cheap I'm not opposed to that.
