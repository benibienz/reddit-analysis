40,"Hey dude,

People might be saying don't bother buying condoms because you're too young, but that's not really responsible. Props to you for wanting to be prepared. 

I would ALWAYS keep condoms around now that you're reaching that age where sexual activities actually happen. Always wrap your tool, and to be doubly safe, always pull out. 

Buy condoms at a Walmart if you want the least awkward way. The self checkout lanes are a godsend. Since its your first time, I would buy non-latex condoms since you might not be sure if either of you are allergic. A brand I use is called ""Skyn"". They're in a black and gold box. If your dick is a little bit thicker than the norm or above average, buy the larger condom size. They have a wider base and are easier to put on. 


Good luck, and awesome job trying to stay safe. 

Edit: Also, as lame as it sounds, practice putting it on once before having sex. My first sexual encounter was a little awkward due to fumbling around with objects unknown. 

Edit 2: Homemade pizza making would also be a great idea, and makes for a fun date if you have her help you out. Get some weird toppings too to have fun with it. ",2016-11-19 21:08:46+00:00,da7dfis,1.0,t3_5dueot,1841.0,teenagers

First of all, communication is key. Voicing your opinion on the matter should be respected if your relationship is going well, that said, this does look like some jealousy on your end. I know this because I used to be the same way. 

Voice your thoughts to her if this is truly how you feel, but know this: that guy is her friend. If you've ever had platonic friends that are girls, then you know that you'd never do anything with them and that you want to celebrate their successes with them. That's just what she's trying to do.

I suffer from anxiety panic attacks because of working with other people and have been doing my best to avoid work like that at all costs. It helps that there are professions and work out there for people who struggle with these issues :) plus working from home isn't so bad, I help around the house if I can and I can watch stuff in the background during work. 

Sometimes what we are doing, even if it seems little, really does help in a lot of ways - and if not, we gotta keep doing what we can in any way possible. I know I've been lacking a lot when it comes to letting others know I appreciate their presence, but when I start showing that appreciation it really starts to show back.

733,"Yup. Summer of 5th grade is when it started.

Back then I played runescape and always talked to people and had a good time. Eventually I ran into a girl named Brianna (but she liked being called Brea). We chatted it up a lot and did almost everything in game together. We role played, talked about fifth and six grader stuff, and then we started emailing each other. 

Hundreds of emails that are embarrassing to look at now, but we still talked and grew closer. Eventually we started yahoo chatting and she kept dropping hints on how she wanted to date and even get married (we were sixth graders at this point) and I was oblivious.

I remember setting alarms to wake up at the time she woke up (we had different time zones) to hop on my computer and talk to her. At this point, she was my closest friend and I liked her a helluva lot. 

Eventually she had to stop talking to me. Her mom found out and basically had a 'mom'ent, and she told me that she wouldn't be talking to me anymore.

She still shoots me a text around my birthday time, and we both give each other a talk about what's going on, then I don't hear from her for another year. Not that it matters anymore in the way I used to when I was head over heels for her, but it is still nice to hear from an old friend who had such an impact on my young life.
