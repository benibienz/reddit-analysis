Her and I are really close friends, if not best friends, and can easily and freely spend time together. We have been friends for roughly 4 years now. We have been flirty in the past, but we set up boundaries whenever I enter a relationship for obvious reasons. 

Anyway, I can understand how that would seem kind of weird if we planned to go out to a nice dinner, but it was completely on the fly. I casually mentioned to her mother that I've never had sushi before, so she offered to pay for me and my friend to go get some. So we went to this fairly nice place and had a great time, halfway through we invited our other friend [19F] to join us. 

Is this weird? I can see how an outside party might mistake us for two people dating, but does that really constitute this as ""immoral""? I've already discussed it with my girlfriend, and she agrees that it seems kinda sketch to an outside party since it was a relatively nice dinner, but she understands since she knows most of my friends are girls and that I relate to them more.

It's been suggested before... And in light of recent drama, I'd like to introduce the idea again. 

CHAT CHANNELS

Having global chat being used to help people, and for posting items and trading, and other things as well, is becoming tedious. New players are overwhelmed and can't really get the attention they need. 

I believe that introducing at least two new chat channels, Help and Trade, would reduce global chat spam greatly and give new players the extra attention they need. 

MODERATION

I just started playing recently, as in a few days ago. I had the misfortune of finding a rare item that people wanted, and I was almost driven out of the game by a couple of old timer players. Had I not been so headstrong, I definitely would have quit... And seeing the recent chat logs, this is clearly an ongoing problem. I would like to see some sort of moderation or a working ignore button on character portraits to help block out the troublemakers. 

I think moderation would be more helpful - new players don't really know how to use the ignore function, and if they're being verbally attacked they have no way to block out their attackers. I think player run moderation would help greatly in this. We have some level headed people in the game, such as Hawlk, that would seem like a perfect fit for such a role. Abuse of power or using moderating positions to influence Group powers or divides should be punishable by admins. 



Clearly, I'm a noob here, but it would be great to receive feedback on these ideas from anyone else who has been here longer. ",initium,Suggestion: Chat Channels and Moderation,https://www.reddit.com/r/initium/comments/54mljw/suggestion_chat_channels_and_moderation/

I'm building a computer for gaming. Here's a rough outline of the build I'm going for:

http://pcpartpicker.com/list/MGxgBP

I'm torn over whether to go for 1440p or 1080p at 144hz refresh rate. I want something that looks great, but more importantly, I want to see fluid gameplay as well. I want to play games like Skyrim, Witcher 3, and Overwatch. I'm aiming to spend about USD 2200 total.

My main worry is that the 1080 alone won't be enough to maintain or reach the 144hz refresh rates at 1440p. My current resolution is 1600x900. I've been playing on a laptop for all of my gaming life, so I've never really experienced any frames above 60, and I'm wondering how large the difference between 1080 and 1440 is.

So, basically: is the color quality and change in picture size a great enough trade-off for slower frame-rates? Does it really that much in the end? I have not experienced these resolutions, or even higher end frame rates, so I'm hoping someone who has will tell me whether to go for the 1080 or 1440.

So my girlfriend has been having long standing issues with her roommate. The roommate is going (18), started doing a lot of drugs and smoking weed in the property, and fails to pay her half of rent. No amount of talking remedied any of the problems. 

Anyway, they have been living together for about five months now. My girlfriend recently got promoted to manager. This means she is going to be gone on training for six weeks. The apartment is aware of her absence.

However, so is the roommate. My girlfriend was planning on moving out and getting the official papers signed when she comes back from her trip, and had already had all of her stuff moved out. She agreed to pay her half of rent until that date. My girlfriend is giving her roommate time to find a new roommate until that date, then sign over the lease to that new roommate should she find one. 

So, all said and done, I come to find out that my girlfriend's roommate replaced her within the first couple days of her being gone. The new person is already moved in (with their kid!). They are still asking my girlfriend to pay her half of rent until she gets back. The roommate wasn't planning on telling my girlfriend that she had someone moved in, I only got lucky through hearsay at work - otherwise, we would have had no idea. 

What can we do about this situation? Do we have to continue paying the half of rent? Can we sue or use any other legal recourse to solve this clear violation of the lease? Any advice?

EDIT: The roommate just texted my girlfriend quoting bills that are in my girlfriend's name, which means that she is going through and opening mail not in her name.

Recently I posted a thread detailing my issue with having my teacher tell my class that I have OCD. I have since met with my disability department. 

Originally, I decided not to report my teacher and instead seek out help for my disability. However, at the end of class today, the teacher in question talked to me after half the room had left and told me I would have to do 10 a full 10-page assignment by Wednesday. Less than 48 hours from now, on top of my 4-page paper and my 9-page paper, I would have to turn this in. That tipped the scale for me. He didn't give anyone else this assignment. Only me. And he didn't give me a reason. I have no delinquent assignments. 

So I reported him. I have an official meeting with the dean in a few days, meanwhile, my disability department told me I would have to do the assignment to appease the teacher. I physically can't. Is this also against the rules for a teacher to do? It's quite clear now, at least to me, that I'm being discriminated against. 

Any thoughts? Should I just buck up and do them, avoiding other responsibilities and sleep?

I'm an on the fence agnostic and I love talking about religion with people who actually care to chat about it and have a civil discussion.


At work, I met someone who loves talking about religion but hates having civil discussion. I've been told multiple times that I'm going to hell and that they care about me enough to let me n me that, and that's okay. I talked to them about my 13-years of Catholic schooling and how it pretty much put me back 13-years in how I viewed the world and that I felt brainwashed, and that led us to the discussion about Creationism.

She flat out told me the Earth was created thousands of years ago and that evolution wasn't real. She asked me why there are no monkey-human transitions alive and how I know the earth was created 6000 years ago. I tried explaining what I believed to be the truth, that evolution by nature destroys the lesser ""links"" and that we are where we are because we came out on top of those of us who weren't ""fit for survival"". I also tried explaining how we have rocks and are able to observe different planets in various stages of development and that our earth is no different. She won't take anything I throw at her.


What are some hard-thinking questions that I can give her to help her consider seeing things from my point of view? Or to have her see how it would be impossible for evolution to not exist or the earth to be created 6,000 years ago?

She also believes in dinosaur, but they only died out recently apparently.",atheism,"I'm not Atheist, but I need help hushing a coworker at work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/44a61d/im_not_atheist_but_i_need_help_hushing_a_coworker/

I'm trying to run a homebrew campaign, and this is my second time DM'ing, and I'm not entirely certain I'm making a good enough game for my players. They are all starting off level-1, and session 1 has found them locked underground. The rogue was able to pick locks using his hidden lock-picks, and the group found out that they were trapped inside a ""dungeon"" for a being that cut off skins from its victims.

They encountered several traps and magical items, solved a Ritual Puzzle which MIGHT have an effect on the world at large, escaped using a magical crystal gained from solving the ritual, then killed the Skin Stealer who captured them, convicted them, and sentenced them to death using his multiple skins.

Anyway, I'm stuck. They essentially completed an ancient ritual and are now going to report their findings to the King or one of his lieutenants in a main city, so they're prepping for a day's travel now. I'm just not sure what I can introduce to get them enthusiastic about the world and what will develop, hell I'm not even sure what WILL develop. 

The party consists of a rogue who breaks people out of prison for money, a gnome who talks shit and has an Eidolon summons, a lawful good paladin smiting evil, and a druid after those who desecrated his forest.

Also, I use roll20 as an online tabletop and Skype to communicate with my players. I had about 8 or 9 maps set-up prior to the event, and not much else - yet I still felt under prepared.

I don't know what I did to deserve her. She's gone through so much shit with me and has put up with my incessant douchebaggery and long-winded monologues about nothing. She has helped me through my heaving sighs and bouts of crying, she listens to my rants and stops my rampages. I'm so thankful I have someone who is willing to do this for me.

Most importantly of all, she is faithful and patient. 

I suffer from OCD so it is so amazing and an absolute blessing to have someone who is as patient as she is. I could be stepping on pavement for what seems like hours, or touching the faucet, washing my hands, kicking a box over and over... and she just waits for me. She doesn't yell, she doesn't get upset... She just waits.


I LOVE HER SO MUCH &lt;3",teenagers,[RANT] MY GIRLFRIEND.,http://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/3bqhr5/rant_my_girlfriend/

I recently started a campaign where I play a mostly grey, short, stout Oread Warpriest with heavy armor and a scimitar glowing with divine light.


During my adventures my party happened upon a pet shop that sells animals and polymorphed humans. Well, Cy, my Oread, fell in love with a calico cat that may or may not be human - we haven't found out yet!


In addition, my character has a tennis-sized onyx coloured stone sphere that functions as a worry-stone. He was given this by his favorite little sibling - his sister, Staya.
