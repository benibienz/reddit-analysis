I looked up your story and I even imagine what you're going through right now. I saw some pictures of your children and they were so beautiful. How anyone, especially a parent, could do that is just so beyond me.

There is no correct or incorrect way to experience pregnancy symptoms. Some women are sick as dogs and some barely see any symptoms at all. If you're concerned you should contact your doctor but I'd say you're good. ",2016-11-21 15:35:50+00:00,da9l5d0,1.0,t3_5e4fg2,2078.0,JulyBumpers2017
8,thanks! I actually went to a new doctor who misled me into thinking that she would be able to help me through my pregnancy so by the end of the appointment I just told her what I wanted (first trimester blood work and ultrasound) and was able to get an appointment with an obgyn.

20,"Can you be blunt with her? My father has survived cancer twice and he became a different person throughout his treatment so I can understand a little of what you're talking about. He definitely responded better to not tiptoeing around the issues because he was so focused on himself that he didn't really care about how other people felt. Sometimes it takes a bitch to get control of another person and if your moms prognosis is good then she may just be looking for the attention since you also have something life changing going on. 

You also do not have a responsibility to keep ANYONE updated on your baby except yourself, your doctors, and your husband. You can always just tell people the truth, that the information got out of hand so you have decided that you are no longer ok with sharing personal information and that they would have to respect your decision if they want any information at all.

85,"First, tell me you're going to post the video because that sounds so freaking amazing!!!!

Ours was kinda a process and it actually started with a fight. I had taken a test early and when the line didn't show up right away I gave up on it and tossed it in the trash. I was feeling sick so a few hours later I did a trash dig and looked at the test. It was positive but since it was so long after the read time I didn't know what it meant. I walked out of the bathroom and over to him, asking what he thought, and he got upset because he didn't know what he was looking at. I tried to explain to him that 2 lines meant pregnant but that it had been several hours so I just wanted his opinion. He told my I was getting obsessed with the baby thing and that I needed to calm down. It was only our first month trying and there was no way I was pregnant already. I got pissed off, he got pissed off, I went to bed without talking to him for the rest of the night and he slept on the couch. The next day we talked a little in the morning before he went to work and things were better. It also happened to be my moms birthday, so we were planning to go out to dinner. I had taken 2 tests with my morning urine and 1 was positive but the other didn't show anything. I took a picture of them to obsess over throughout the day at work. I didn't drink at dinner and I ended up showing her my picture to explain why I didn't drink and she was cautiously excited but I didn't know if it was a 100% positive. I took another 2 dip tests the next morning and they were both positive. I posted them on line porn and it was suggested to me that I purchase a different brand to check. I got the other brand on my way home then did a 3 hour hold and tested when I got home (along with another dip test). It was positive, of course. I tested again the next morning (with the alternate brand, a FRER, and a dip test) and again, positives. So at this point I have 3 days of positives with 4 different brands plus the one from the trash that caused the fight. When he got home that 3rd day he apologized and said that he knew I was excited but that I really did need to calm down and just let it happen. He loved me, he was excited to keep trying, and he did still want to have kids. I was going to wait until the next day when my initial blood draw was scheduled but the apology was just so sweet and I was so happy, so I had a huge smile on my face and explained that I had 3 days worth of positives and that I was pregnant... He was shocked but excited and happy. ",2016-11-16 01:38:44+00:00,da251zx,1.0,t3_5d4gq2,22463.0,JulyBumpers2017

151,"From Parents.com list of foods to avoid while pregnant... **Nitrate-Rich Foods:** It's also smart to go easy on hot dogs (which should always be eaten cooked) and cured meats such as bacon and sausage. These contain nitrates, additives that have been called into question for possible links to brain tumors and diabetes. Although studies aren't conclusive, it makes sense to limit your consumption -- these foods aren't great nutritional choices anyway. What about your beloved diet sodas? They're considered safe during pregnancy and, beyond not being a stellar nutritional choice, there's no scientific evidence that they cause harm. But on the downside, at least one artificial sweetener (saccharin) that's often found in diet sodas does cross the placenta, and artificially sweetened drinks are usually low in nutritional value. So again, we recommend moderation.

For me it's not completely real until I have the ultrasound and hear that everything is going as it should be. I'm waiting to hear back from my doctor about where I should go but I do have the order to get one so I'm hoping do get it done this upcoming week.

220,"No matter if you watch tv, listen to the radio, read the news paper, or live under a rock, if you are an American citizen over the age of 18, you have a right, and in my opinion a responsibility to be informed on the topics. You can blame others all you want, but it's up to you to learn the facts and develop an opinion. I don't care what the opinion is, as long as you do your civic duty and vote for what you feel is the better option on all fronts. You should vote and if you don't then it's your own fault and you have no right to complain about anything having to do with the issues on the ballot or mentioned in the elections. 

If the issue is that you're not registered, there are many states where you can register that day and if not then find out when the deadline is and register for the next election. If it's that you have no ride to the poll, there are some programs which will give you a ride to and from the polls for free, if it's that you don't know the issues, they are written out on the ballot. 


I'm sorry, but hasn't Phil been saying similar things for *months*? You can't say you weren't aware that there was an election, you can't say that you weren't aware that there were other options for president, and you can't say that you didn't know that there were ballot questions, because even if the PDS is the only source for news that you have, he's been talking about all of these things for a while in one way or another.

283,"I can't imagine going back to school! I have an Associates and a Bachelors and it's enough for me. What were you hoping to do with your degree? Unfortunately there are some fields that just are impossible to get into without a Masters or even a Doctorate. There are tons of jobs out there, they might just not be what you exactly wanted to do. Have you checked out Indeed.com? I got my job from there and I enjoy it despite it not being what I had originally planned to do. If you're having mental health struggles you should contact your doctor, they may be able to give you some recommendations as to what to do in order to help you. Your emotions are going to be out of wack for months, it doesn't hurt to reach out for help early on.

289,"I'm not vegan, but I do have dietary restrictions as a result of Celiac disease and I have to be gluten free. The concern of not getting the correct vitamins and nutrients is there for me as well. I have extra vitamins that I've been taking for years in order to try to compensate. I believe that you, like me, need to make sure that your medical team are all on the same page about your diet and the extra needs you might have as a result. 

Can you have almond milk or another type of ""milk"" to increase your calcium and calorie intake? I don't know much about being vegan, I'm sorry to say, but I do have experience with dietary restrictions and I know there's usually a way to compensate for what you're not getting by doing something else.

I'm a FTM and my hubby is a FTD. We had tried about 2 years ago and it didn't happen for various reasons so this summer we agreed to start trying again. Hubby had some kidney stone issues in Sept which is when we had originally planned to start trying so we weren't able to start until October. To literally everyone's surprise (especially mine because I have some stuff that would point more toward infertility than hitting the bulls eye on the second shot) I started getting the fun nausea at about 9DPO but got a few BFN and squinters. I kept trying and eventually did get the BFP. I went for my blood test today but everyone (medical and non) who I've talked to says if I'm getting BFP on 3 different brands for this long it's pretty much positive. I'm still testing to keep myself sane, both AM and PM (with several hour hold) and I've been temping and it's been in the high 97's but I didn't temp previously so I have no idea if it's high enough or not. I'm super scared that this isn't real, that it's going to go away, and that I'm getting to excited too quickly. I have always wanted to be a mom, it's the only thing I've ever really wanted for myself, so I'm just trying to make sure that this really is happening. I figured joining on here and being with others who aren't super far along would help me to keep myself sane. 

So, here's to us all having amazing and healthy full term pregnancies with no issues. ",2016-11-05 02:20:50+00:00,d9meqm3,1.0,t3_59rae9,701202.0,JulyBumpers2017
365,"7/9 I believe should be mine... once I'm able to get an ultrasound I'll be a lot more confident about the baby however just like you, the nausea is a friendly reminder that I have something growing in there. I'm happy to get sick too, does that make us weird? Sticky baby vibes all around!!!",2016-11-05 01:55:29+00:00,d9mdtmz,3.0,t1_d9md9wb,862.0,BabyBumps
366,I know (mostly) how you feel. I'm 19DPO with 4 days of BFP getting progressively darker but EVERY TIME I go to the bathroom I'm scared that I'm going to wipe and come up with blood. I've been nauseous for about a week and a half which makes me think things are ok but still the fear and anxiety is there. I think for me it's a little different since I'm a FTM but I absolutely feel your anxiety and fear. Here's hoping we both stay strong and everything is good. *hugs*,2016-11-04 23:30:03+00:00,d9m88el,1.0,t3_5b5vpd,12228.0,BabyBumps

393,"OMG, this is bad tv show level drama and I'm already addicted. That being said, I am so very sorry that this is real and happening to your family. I agree with previous comments that the daughter needs therapy. The fact that she doesn't feel safe in a place that she has been living in is unthinkably horrible. It is so kind of you to take them in while they need it.

My first instinct with this situation is contacting the police, but obviously they have had mixed results, so you may want to call DSS or a lawyer. Get a restraining order for your bf and the daughter ASAP because without that there is little that the cops will be able to do. 
It seems like the pick-up list is already being updated. I would make sure that her school is aware that the grandparents are dangerous and under no circumstances is she to be allowed to go with them. Most schools, especially for this age group, have monitors who ensure that the correct people collect the correct kids. 
Is Bio-mom in the picture at all? If she is then she should be updated as to the situation. If he had legal custody of her but mom has some rights then she has the right to know that the daughter do longer resides with the grandparents. If she isn't in the picture then forget what I said lol. 


Please keep us updated! Good luck and I hope that things get better for all involved.

If yours was early and only a little it could be implantation bleeding or like you said, left over from your pap, honestly there's little chance to really know for sure if it's too early. I tested early and it was a BFN but I tested this morning (3 days after AF should have come) and think I see a faint line but it's probably my imagination.

If you get a positive on one of the knock offs then go for a digital test but if not then wait and see if you get a visit from AF.

My ex is an ex for a reason and I don't regret it at all but I would have been marrying an unstable person with a drug problem and unmedicated mental illness if we hadn't lived together. I understand this isn't the case for everyone but the lesson is there. Everyone is hiding something and it's more likely that you'll find out the persons secrets when you live with them. 


My husband and I lived together before we got married and it was a great decision as well. We were forced to deal with our shit before we committed and it turned out that once we were comfortable with each other, we had some shit to work through as I think every couple does. You need to see your potential spouse at both their best and worst because that's how a relationship should work. If you can't deal with your partner when you're super pissed but can't escape then what's the point? 

There definitely is a difference between dating, being engaged, and being married, even if you're living together the entire time. I'm not sure how to describe it, but there just is.",2016-11-02 01:19:07+00:00,d9hq9fz,1.0,t3_5aijci,49561.0,AskWomen

It's hard, it sucks, and it's not fair that people who don't want or shouldn't have kids can reproduce so damn easily while we, who want and are trying to have kids, end up having such a hard time. 

I've had questions about fertility since I was a teenager based on various medical issues, but all I want is a kid of my own. DH is supportive as much as he can be but he doesn't know what it feels like, none of them do. Friends who have no issues conceiving cannot put themselves in our shoes and while they may believe they're being encouraging or supportive, it just makes things harder. It's a bit mind blowing that we can feel better ""talking"" to total strangers than to our friends and family.

I've tried almost anything I can think of to help him from buying porn (which we both like but you can only watch so much and if you don't have the same taste in it then someone isn't going to be as into it as the other person), I've got toys (even getting him to order from a toy party with me just so I knew he would like what we got [which is still in the package more than a year later]), I've purchased naughty clothing (he claims it does nothing for him), we've done dieting, I've tried getting him to exercise with me (*I'm too tired...*), it's a never ending shit show.

521,"Thanks so much for sharing, I'm sorry you had such a shitty experience but I'm glad you have a good doctor now. The thing that my new psych doc said is that many of the ""older"" psych docs base their opinions about medication and pregnancy on outdated and disproven information. The older medications had more side effects and risks associated with them, but as new better medication for psychiatric issues become available, the risks and side effects go down. The more they study this type of thing, the better idea they have as to what is and isn't safe. If you have a serious traditional illness such as diabetes or HIV would they tell you to stop taking the meds? I don't think so. It's the EXACT SAME THING!

534,"Mostly the studies where the amount of the depressant either passed from mother to child through the blood or the potential side effects as well as the possible changes in brain chemistry. The one I'm on apparently has a 2% rate of passing through the breast milk but does not show up in the infants blood once consumed. There is also no data to definitively say that the antidepressant had any increase in the likelihood of birth defects which in healthy women is low anyway. In all 14 studies there were 2 children who had seizures but again, no proof that it was the meds that caused the seizure. They also did brain scans and there was no evidence that the brain chemistry of the child was effected negatively by the antidepressants.

Depression is an illness and for some people it doesn't matter how much help they get or how many people are around to support them, this just happens.

There are a lot of basic retail positions which do not require experience and will train you with a marketable skill. Whole sale clubs (Costco, Sam's Club, BJ's, et...) are good at training and if you do well you can move up through the ranks, even making an introductory job into a career eventually. This time of year is good to apply for seasonal positions which could turn into a permanent position if you do well and show a willingness to take on more work. 


The biggest thing is just applying for jobs in general. If a place is hiring, apply.

634,"As much as you may not want to hear it, I agree with everyone else, postpone the wedding and do some serious thinking (probably with the assistance of a mental health professional) about your future and how you want it to look like. You've been together for 9 years, has anything changed or has it been this way for the entire time? If it's been this way since day 1 then I'm not sure what you expected, you knew what you were getting into, but if not then I would look at your relationship as well as your future family and see what's changed in that time. You need to also take a good look at yourself and why you're allowing yourself to be treated like this from multiple fronts. Marriage counseling, individual therapy, an intervention for your SO (*joking*), anything is better than just taking it and doing nothing because what you're describing appears to me to be emotional and financial abuse. 

That being said, I'm guessing you've already put deposits down, bought a dress, sent out the invites, etc... so postponing might seem impossible to you for now. Talk to the places and people who already have your money ASAP and see what their policy is in this type of situation. 4 months out usually means that nothing besides the dress has actually been ordered so you shouldn't have an issue getting most of your money back if it comes to that unless you've ordered something super crazy that takes months to create. 

There's also the question of why the heck she feels like she can act like this and get away with it because this seems like it goes a bit beyond just being in control of her household. How did it get to this point? Did she not have her own wedding and is looking to live vicariously through yours? Is she actually trying to see how far she's push you until you either push back or give up? 

In the end it's up to you what to do. Could you postponing damage your relationship? Yes, absolutely, but won't allowing things to continue going this way end up damaging **you**? Stay strong and do what's best for yourself, not your SO.

659,"My ex and I had some issues towards the end of our 2 year relationship (friends for many years before we started dating too) but we were engaged and I thought he was ""the one"". Looking back now I believe that the relationship was just a really big learning experience. During the relationship I thought I was in love, the sex was good, and we had everything we needed. It took me about 3 and a half years to become ok with myself and recover, but I decided to get out there again and joined some online dating sites. Within 2 months I met a few people, some good, some not so much, but one of the good ones turned serious and we've been married for a little over 3 years. Looking at my life and relationship now I can't believe that I thought I was in the right relationship with my ex. 


I'm not going to lie, it was hard to get over my previous relationship and sometimes I still look back at both the good and bad, but I'm so glad that the relationship ended because it taught me a lot and allowed me to find my hubby. I knew from our first date that I wanted him in my life and from the second that I wanted to be exclusive with him. 

You might go though some hard times, but no matter what please remember that there is someone out there for everyone and our ex's are ex's for a reason. I know there has been some stigma developing about online dating, but when you're ready it might be a good way to start getting yourself out there.

A good number of companies include additives in their meats in order to change or increase the flavoring (like turkey) or even coat the meats (like ham). As someone who cannot eat gluten I have to say, I look for those ""gluten free"" labels on almost everything and feel better when the food states that it's gluten free despite someone who does not have this issue thinking it's silly and obvious. 

This also includes medication. Gluten is used as a filler in many pills which are made in the U.S. but there are other countries which have made this illegal (I believe). ",2016-10-13 17:56:24+00:00,d8qju7f,4.0,t1_d8qive5,1164.0,AskReddit

663,"My wedding dress. While I understand that it's usually the big thing, I spent around $900 on my dress and my budget was $5000 for the entire wedding. I was able to afford everything we needed but things would have been a lot easier if I had gone with one of the rental places or gotten one on sale. We splurged on the food and the alcohol, but got deals on pretty much everything else. I have a dress in the back of my closet that I won't ever wear again and I looked great in it but I would have looked just as great in something else. 

Things you should spend money on... 

food and booze

photographer

Gifts for your wedding party if you have one

The flowers for the couple (and maybe some extras but the wedding party doesn't need bouquets)


Things you can save money on...

*Invites and thank you notes.* Seriously, just go to your local craft store, get some blank envelopes, rubber stamps with ink, glitter or colored pens, and get creative. We did our thank you cards for about $20 (minus postage).

*The cake.* No one wants it anyway, seriously. We got a cake for the two of us and sheet cake for everyone else, so much more practical and you don't feel bad throwing it out. If the sheet cake feels too impersonal then skip the ""wedding cake"" and go for cupcakes!

*Favors.* Again something you can do yourself and again, something no one wants (except your elderly aunt who collects wedding favors). Go to your local craft store again and go to the wedding isle. They will have a bunch of ideas for favors like mesh and fabric bags, little boxes, plastic bags, etc... and you can either buy candy there or in bulk on amazon. 

*Center pieces.* If you're doing flowers, go for local and readily available plants, not cut flowers. You can stock up on a bunch of cheap potted plants, wrap the pots up in pretty plastic or paper, and you've got something that people may actually want to take home. If you're not doing flowers, go for mason jars that you can decorate yourself. Modgepodge some ribbons, photos of you two that look cute, even tissue paper, and make a candle holder. You can get as creative as you want but not break the bank. 

*Don't have a procession/wedding party.* Think people will be upset if you invite your friend Sally but neglect to include your 3rd cousin Amy in your wedding? Skip the people and just make it about you two. This saves EVERYONE money! No one wants to buy a bridesmaids dress or rent a tux, they're already getting you a gift. No one wants the hassle of being forced to help the bride but if you make it fun for them and not a job they'll usually step up. This keeps everyone on equal ground in your family and friends too. 

*No wedding party means no rehearsal dinner!* You can go out to a nice meal with your friends or close family the day after the wedding and actually enjoy yourselves by thanking those guests who made a special trip or helped out a bunch.


Overall remember that it's your day and about you two as a couple. If someone feels slighted in some way, they'll get over it.

There are some times that I barely bleed at all and others where I feel like all the blood in my body is going to come out. If I'm bleeding through my clothes consistently or the cramps are so painful that it could effect me driving (which does happen) then for my own safety I will stay home.

673,"If you don't want to dump him (which I think you should because this isn't ok) think about this and maybe discuss it with him... Is he interested in ass play with him being the recipient? If you haven't discussed it, maybe bring it up. I know a lot of guys who love to joke about and even try anal with their female partners but the second anything goes near them it's a huge no. If he really isn't getting that you feel violated then see if he can put into a perspective of him not knowing if he'd like it until he tries it. If he doesn't want to have someone/something inside his butt then he has no right trying to make you think that you do or assume that it's ok for him to do to you. Just because it felt good in the moment doesn't mean that it's for you or that it was ok for him to do. If he is interested in being the one on the receiving end (no pun intended) then maybe that's something that you two can explore together without you being the one on the bottom.

On the other hand, I've had bad anal experiences with ex's and believe me, I understand not wanting to do it again, however I found that once I'm worked up and turned on enough as well as with the right person, I find it enjoyable every once in a while. If you want to see if he's willing to take it slowly and stop being a jackass, you may be able to work together to make it an enjoyable experience for both of you. This is tricky because it requires a lot more trust and communication than it appears you two have.

675,"I have a friend who had a guy staying with her because he fell on hard times and was not legally in the country. They hooked up once and she got pregnant with their son. They tried to date but it was obvious to everyone from the beginning that it wouldn't work out. Bio dad left to go back to England a few years ago and hasn't had anything to do with their wonderful son since he moved. She decided to go through with the pregnancy because she had had an abortion previously and said that she couldn't go through with it again. People who knew bio dad were more judgy about him (because he was cheating on my friend from the start and he was using her for money and a place to live) than they were about my friend. She has done so much to raise her son into a great kid, working 3 jobs for the first few years after he was born while going to school in order to better their lives. She hooked up with a friend who had strong feelings for her a few years ago. They both thought that he could not have children (he had a testicular trauma as a child) and surprise surprise, she got pregnant again. They started dating and things worked out a lot better for her this time, they're still together and from what I understand despite normal issues for a young couple, they're happy. They have a beautiful little girl and he has been a great step dad to her son. I'm pretty sure they're going to get married eventually. In my opinion people were more judgy of her for her second (third technically) pregnancy than her first baby.

When I was young (this was more than 20 years ago) I enjoyed sledding in the snow and where I lived there was a hill that was perfect for it during the winter.

I thought I was going to be cool and decided to go off of the jump myself. This was a bad choice. I flew off of the jump, landed on my head or something, and was knocked unconscious.

713,"The socks come in handy in colder months or if I have to try on shoes but honestly most often they're loaned to friends. Since I started carrying them I've only needed them a hand full of times but was glad I had them.

The lighter I use about once a week. I have several friends that smoke but forget their lighters so I happen to be prepared for them. I also find that if a rope is fraying the lighter can help with that. Also candles or fires on the beach, lighting grills, or just playing around during with.

The duct tape is something that I have because I tend to break things but also you never know when you're going to need to attach something to another thing. I'm currently on my 3rd roll of duct tape in the last maybe 5 years so it's not something that is used super often but it does get used.

The band aids are a must for anyone. I do understand having a first aid kit around and I always keep one at home and in my car but just throwing a few band aids in your purse ends up being helpful, even if it's just to cover a broken nail or a paper cut.

714,"1. Always keep a hair brush in your purse or car. I prefer to keep a compact (foldable) one in my purse which also has a mirror. I also encourage you to have hair ties or clips but definitely the brush.

2. You know those napkins that you get from the drive through and they always give you too many? Put the extra ones in your car door or center console, just in case.

3. Always keep an extra pair of socks, a lighter, duct tape, and bandaids in your purse/bag/car. You have no idea how often you will need one or more of these things.

4. Follow your instinct. If something feels wrong then it probably is. ",2015-08-08 20:09:15+00:00,ctw77my,1.0,t3_3g9cof,11143.0,AskWomen
715,"I squirt and I know of at least 2 other friends that do it as well. It's something that I didn't always do, but it seems like it started around the time I was 22. This could be because I didn't start having good sex until my early 20s or just a change in my body, I honestly have no idea. 
For me it happens a lot more often when my clit is being stimulated either by a skilled hand or tongue and it can be anything from a little dribble to a full on gush. I also have experienced a small squirting as a result of a g-spot orgasm but it's more likely to happen for me when external stimulation happens. It can get pretty messy (we bought a waterproof mattress cover) but it can and does usually feel good. For me it's almost like a mini orgasm, I feel a build up and then a release plus I get more sensative, but it can also become overwhelmingly over stimulated and cause discomfort. 
I don't know if everyone has the ability to do it but I believe everyone at least has the parts. The enjoyable part for me, aside from the sex itself, is that my partner enjoys when it happens. I can hold it in if I want to refrain from making a mess but it doesn't feel as good and can end up being more frustrating than anything  else. 
If you're trying to do it, my advice would be to explore your body yourself, see if you can make yourself do it through toys or whatever you enjoy using. If you know what it feels like when you're alone then it will be easier for you to guide your partner into helping you achieve the desired outcome. Also, put a towel down and have at least one available to help clean up. But above all, have fun and don't put pressure on yourself!",2015-08-08 03:52:40+00:00,ctvlppd,1.0,t3_3g5ztl,28973.0,TwoXChromosomes

733,"I've never had this procedure personally but I have several friends that have. The medical and emotional recommendations on here are absolutely fantastic! You should definitely follow the advice of preparing otc pain medication and pads for when it's over and you're home. All of my friends were depressed after theirs but every one is different and they were all younger than your are. It is completely normal to feel a sense of loss afterwards, just remember that you did the right thing and you have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. It's also completely normal not to have this feeling. Whatever you're feeling is right for you.

I would only add that you should make sure that you have some place comfortable to go afterwards. If you're in school you may not want to return to a dorm, maybe staying with a friend who can look after you is an option. Having extra blankets available would be good too. After any medical procedure you may experience changes of body temperature. 

Please make sure that you pay attention to your body in the hours, days, and weeks after. If there is something  wrong or even if you think something is wrong don't hesitate to seek medical attention. It's better to be safe than the alternative. 

Good luck, you are a strong and brave woman. I hope you feel better after you see all of the support on this thread.",2015-07-23 03:17:52+00:00,ctcycqm,1.0,t3_3e5sau,82598.0,AskWomen
