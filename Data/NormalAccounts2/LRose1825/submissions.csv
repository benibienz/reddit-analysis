We got to the appointment early so that I could fill out any paperwork and we would make sure that we got in on time. When we got into the office there was another couple waiting. The wife was 22 or 24 weeks, I can't remember, and we had fun chatting. They had an appointment for 3 and it was about 3:15ish so we were expecting that our appointment would be pushed back *a little*. The ultrasound tech came out and asked if they could wait a few minutes while she did some paperwork. They said yes but we weren't asked. My husband had taken an extended lunch break in order to be able to come and he was going to have to make up any time after he got back. Our appointment time was 3:30 and the other couple went in a little after that. I had been instructed to drink a ton of water before my appointment in order to have a full bladder for better imaging. I had to pee and the other woman recommended that I just go for it and have some more water while they were in. It made sense so I went and then chugged 2 bottles of water. 4 rolled around and I figured they were almost done. I was floating at that point, I had just had a lot of water in a small amount of time and I was being forced to hold it. DH was laughing at me, I was super uncomfortable, but I could wait because it was almost my turn right? Wrong! 4:05 rolled around, I asked the receptionist if it would be much longer because I was floating. She called the tech and the tech told me to pee ""a little"" but didn't give me a timeline. 4:10, nothing, chug more water. 4:15, I hear voices in the room and it sounds like they should be coming out soon... but nope. 4:25 and they finally come out. No explanation, minor apology, and I'm swimming again. (That's almost an hour after my appointment was scheduled) She asks how I'm doing and I explain that I have to pee but I want to just get it over with so let's go. She does a regular over the abdomen scan and doesn't see much but assures me that there's a baby in there. She says I can pee now so I hop down and book it to the bathroom. I came back and she does a trans-vaginal, it shows more but there's a major shadow so she's poking me in the belly trying to get a good picture. Back to the abdominal and it's a little better. She takes a few pictures and tells me that the heartbeat is about 122 BPM. I ask if she can pinpoint how far along I actually am and she said it's unclear but looks like I'm closer to 6 than 7 weeks. She goes back to the trans-vaginal and gets a better picture but doesn't go into any more details. A few more measurements are taken as well as a few more pictures. I tried to take a video and she shut me down so freaking quick I was offended. I asked for print outs and she told me I could have some but then didn't give them to me. I was able to take the 2 then we were ushered out and given a card if I want to get any more ultrasounds. 

I know I will but definitely not at this place... 


Anyway, I'm pregnant, I cried when I saw the little heartbeat, and my husband had to go back to work. He should have only been out an hour at the most but because we were there until after 5 we have no idea when he's coming home today. I'm not changing my due date until I have a better scan because this one wasn't clear.

Edit: I looked up the average size of the embryo for 7 weeks and it looks like I'm probably about 6w+5 or 6 days-ish instead of 7 weeks because the size she measured was .51 cm but it was still unclear and the measurements were different with each picture she took. This makes sense because the DoC would have been 10/18, not 10/16/",JulyBumpers2017,"Totally frustrating first ultrasound, but I'm officially knocked up!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JulyBumpers2017/comments/5e7h18/totally_frustrating_first_ultrasound_but_im/

She also didn't give me a good amount of confidence in her ability to care for my needs if she did become my new PCP, specifically I felt that I had more knowledge about one of my medications than her and I had to request an addition to the blood work which was a specific concern related to this medication which a normal doctor would have automatically added to the testing. 

On the plus side I asked for a prenatal blood panel and an ultrasound which she ordered, plus she was able to set me up with an appointment (Dec 7) for a prenatal with an actual OBGYN whose office is about 10 minutes from my house. I should be around 10 weeks at that point so it'll be almost at the end of the first trimester.

I just got an appointment confirmation text from my new doctors office and I'm realizing that this is getting real. Tomorrow I should be meeting either the Dr, PA, or NP who will be assisting with my pregnancy and getting my first trimester blood work ordered. I'm seeing some of the ladies on here having to leave because of their test results and it breaks my heart. I'm just so incredibly worried at what the tests will show. I'm hopeful that everything is ok, and I know that I'm still pregnant (no bleeding, still occasionally testing and it's all positive) but what if there's something wrong? What if my numbers aren't rising the way they should be? What if the little bugger doesn't have a heart beat when I have the ultrasound (which I'm requesting done because I want to know everything is ok and I want to know the EDD according to the doctor, not my little app)? What if my body just hates me and I lose this baby and then can never get pregnant again? 

I'm also coming to the realization that while DH is looking forward to the baby and really can't wait to be a dad, he's not going to be super helpful with my crazy throughout the pregnancy. He's just not going through the same things that I am and so he has no real way to relate. The biggest example of this for me is that I've complained that my boobs hurt, but he enjoys nipples so he keeps trying to touch them. I'm sore, exhausted, and hormonal but he just wants boobs. ARGH! 

I know many of you share my fears to some extent, especially the other FTM's. I just don't know how to deal with this anxiety, especially when the goal is to reduce my stress level for the health of the baby, not increase it. Anyone have any advice? How are you ladies dealing with it?

I always said the only reason I would get the shot again is if I was pregnant because then it wouldn't just be about me. So, I'm there, it's happening, and I'm pregnant. What should I do? I don't want to put my body at risk of getting the flu while I'm this early into the pregnancy.

Should I get the shot now, when I'm just 5 weeks, and hope things go well when they haven't in the past, or wait until I'm further along and well into flu season, or just not get it until I've given birth so I can pass the immunity through the breast milk?

I had to reach out to my PCP and the social worker to make sure everyone was on the same page because this *quack doc* claimed that since I've never been hospitalized for suicide attempts that I didn't need to be on my antidepressants (despite going off of them a few years ago and it not working out at all) and a whole bunch of other bull that was basically trying to put his own beliefs which were not based on medical facts. He claimed that the magical baby hormones would essentially cure my depression and that he didn't believe that anyone at his practice would even be willing to take me on as a client considering my goal of pregnancy.

I saw the doc who I was originally supposed to see yesterday and he was AMAZING! He actually listened to me and my concerns, he went over the risks vs. benefits as well as 14 different case studies of women who were pregnant and on the same medication as me and the statistics of women on as well as off the same medication. He even said that I was on the one that he would have recommended anyway and that since I had such a bad experience when I went off of them before he was confident that the benefits would far outweigh the negligible added risk to a fetus and even breastfeeding. He talked to me for about 40 minutes (it was supposed to be a 20-30 minute appointment but I got there early and he was able to see me when I got there) and I felt so much better when I left.

He even (kinda) tried to explain why the other doctor had said the things he did but totally understood why I was upset and agreed with me about him.

I'm dealing with some medical challenges (PCOS, Celiac, and medicated Depression) but I'm educated and hopeful. I have an appointment with a psychiatrist on Monday to evaluate my meds and see about switching me to something that would be easier on a fetus if I do get pregnant (please, no judgement, I have been working with my doc for months to get to the point I'm at now and I know my body enough to know I need antidepressants) but right now hubby and I are having fun seeing if anything happens. With all of that said, I just wanted to introduce myself and say I hope to be able to contribute to this group when I can.

Does anyone have any advice for conception?

Between interviews, the hiring process, and training it can take several weeks to get the job you want so applying early is a good idea. I work in a mall and every single store is hiring for holiday help now (and have been for more than a month in a lot of cases). The store I work for is a small one and they're looking to hire 5 to 9 people. While these positions are part time and usually temporary, if you do well and there are open permanent positions you may be offered a position after the holiday season. The longer you have to train and become a valued employee, the more likely you (usually) are to stay past the holidays.

I've been told by different medical professionals different amounts of time you can/should go between paps. Normally I get one annually but I have also been told that you should get one every 3 years unless you've had a child or a history of hpv. I'm almost 30 so I'm assuming that annually is the best option but I have friends who are younger and are not well informed about their lady part health. So, is there a magic pap smear number?",TwoXChromosomes,Pap question,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/3eu3xb/pap_question/
