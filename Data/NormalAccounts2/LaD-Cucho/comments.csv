Meditation had helped me a lot.
Imagine that you're sinking in the deapest lake (everything black and no gravity) take air for 4 secs, hold 7 and release 8.
If you've toughts, just imagine you put them all inside a fish and release the air with your mouth (blowing to scare the fish).
If you've no extra toughts, start counting how many repetitions have you made without ""blowing the tiny fish"".
At the start u'll be frustrated cuz you wont do more than 3 repetitions but you'll improve with time.
Also, try the mild, that's slow but nice :)

Has 4important functions:
-smart alarm:
  Is the better one for me, you choose when you want to wake up, and it awakes you at the end of the last REM before that hour 
  Example: if you choose 6:00 it can awake you at 5:47 when your rem does end.

-dream diary:
    Well... Is that

-ambiental sounds:
     While you're in rem it'll play some background sounds that you can choose (and eeryone has a lucid version that says ""you are dreaming"")

-it goves you a chronogram of your sleep telling you when did you rem and how long
