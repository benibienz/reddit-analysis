we learn through ""mini projects"" so we've a little challenge and every week we've to add something and improve the program.
last class they taught us how to make matrix (or arrays) and here's the situation:
week 1:
we learned how to make lists.
    we had to make a sudoku with 9 numbers in a random place (we had to separate the tiny matrix with | - and + in the corners)
so i made a ""for"" in range (11) printing a list with a random number.
now this week, we learned how to make matrix (no one learned right tough, so it's hard to even think the excercice).
    we've to validate and restrict with the sudoku rules and return a random fully resolved sudoku... i think that i've to make 3 functions (1 for each rule, columns, rows and matrices)...
but don't know what to do :(
could you guys guide me?

edit:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
well, here's more info:
this was my first ""delivery"":
    
    from random import* 
    for z in range (0,11): 
        a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,x=0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3 
        while x==3 or x==7: 
            x=randint(0,10) 
        La1,La2,La3=[a,b,c,'|'],[d,e,f,'|'],[g,h,i] 
        Lf=La1+La2+La3 
        Ld=['---------+-------------+---------'] 
        Lf[x]=randint(1,9) 
        if z==3 or z==7: 
            print Ld 
        else:
            print Lf
   i know is not the most intelligent thing to do but i'm just a newbie :)
we had to give just the matrix but with simple lists...
now here's what we have to do: (original text in spanish and then my translation)
""El sudoku es un puzle matemático que consta de rellenar 9 matrices de 3x3 con números de 1 a 9 sin repetirse dentro de esta (Matriz 3x3) o dentro de la fila y columna de la matriz grande, además de que las posiciones de cada número están puestas por una coordenada (i, j) las cuales deben ser validadas en cada momento"" 

sudoku is a mathematical puzzle that consist in filling 9 3x3 matrix with numbers from 1 to 9 without repeting them in the 3x3 matrix, the row or the column of the huge matrix, also all the cells must be in a i,j coordenate that must be validated every moment""...

now i've only got the matrix and it goes like this:

    sudoku=[]
    for f in range (11):
        l=[]
        for c in range (11):
            if c==3 or c==7 and (f==3 or f==7):
                l+=[""+""]
            elif c==3 or c==7:
                l+=[""|""]
            elif f==3 or f==7:
                l+=[""-""]
            else:
                l+=[0]
        sudoku+=[l]
    for i in range (11):
        print(sudoku[i])

-we're using python
-we can use only matrix and not more in deep programation...
-we must put this rows  with ""|"", ""+"" and ""-"".
-i know there are far more intelligent ways to do this but i can't come up with no one... sadly we share campus with computational engenieers and they laugh at us the whole time and do'nt want to help (some of them does but no one have time now, we're ending the semester... :( hahahah

i'm an non-expert (or non even amateur) mead maker from Chile.

i'm on the first year of Industrial civil engineering (if you're not familiarized with the career, is like a mix of all the engineerings but not as deep as the rest).

i have to make a proyect of a meadery for a subject called ""basics of administration""

with that being said...
well, this must be a complete project cuz our teacher want to use the same rubric that the ""corfo"" uses to analize projects (corfo is one the goverment thingys that subsidizes start up business)...
also, that is not bad at all (hard but not bad) because if chile has something good is that the goverment and universities always make competitions for funds and stuff like that for starter business people, and the next year i want to really start this meadery :) .
but i need:

    **general description of the project** 
    
        i can make that :) 
    **background of the industry:**
     
            wich one it is (i believe is manufacturing).

        behabing during last 5 years 
        
            i have no bibliography in chile about that, or the year :( also, there's no mead market so the closest one is the beer one.
    
        indicators and time stimations 
        
            same as before... no bibliography :( )
    **evyronement variables**  (non controlable ones)
   
    **why is this innovating?** 
 
        i can make that :)

    **wich need am i satisfying? and wich are the opportunities on the market**

    **SWOT analysis** 
    
    i can make that :) 

    **Porter analysis**
   
         i can make that :) )

    **kind of society and justification**
        i can make that :) 

    **strategic planning** 
    
        that'll be hard but i think i can do it :) )

    **mission, vision, general and specific objectives, strategies and tactics** 
       
         i can make that :).


but the hardest thing i guess will be:
  
    **detailed description of:**

        -the process (cuz i only know how to make it like ""in my home"" with no machines or stuff, my fermenters are the plastic 20 lts ones).

        -competition (don't know other meaderies here so i guess that'd be the brewers.

        -clients (don't even know my objective clients :( )


i know is a lot and i might sound really lazy... but this subject is quite hard for being a 1st year one :/ anything that you could help me i'd be really grafetull...

-1  6 lts fermenter with mint
-1  6 lts fermenter with orange
-1  6 lts fermenter with ginger and mint

Well, the flower isn't as bad as wikipedia tells us...
Is a plant (that i haven't tried yet) that's suposed to cause strong alucitantions or even the death of the consumer (if you eat it or drink a highly concentrated tea of it.
But the case is that i heard that if you sleep with one to three flowers of this under your pillow, u're almost guaranteed to dream really vivid (and also high chance of LD).
It's proved that sleeping with some flowers doesn't hurts u.
Someone had ever tryed it?
