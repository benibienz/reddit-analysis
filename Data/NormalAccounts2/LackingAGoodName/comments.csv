**Support Thread.** In effort to remove clutter, please direct all support questions and issues to /u/ATVIAssist or [@ATVIAssist](https://twitter.com/ATVIAssist) on Twitter. /u/ATVIAssist has been summoned to this thread, here is a copy of the original thread:

&gt; &gt; If you weren't aware, people who ordered CoD XP 2016 tickets who had the veteran package would receive IW Legacy Edition. I purchased my ticket in August, and the event was in September. 
&gt; 
&gt; It is currently almost 2 and a half weeks since the launch of IW and I STILL do not have an email with the game code. Activision support wasted about 45 minutes of my time, getting me nowhere. It seems like a scam! They don't even want to help you.
&gt; 
&gt; Support: ""Anything else I can help you with today?""
&gt; Me: Yeah, you can help me by getting me a fucking game code.

* There are Dedicated Servers, and 90% of the time you are playing on them. Read up on Hybrid Dedicated/Listen Servers.
* Ping indicators are a known issue on PC and Console.
* Lack of a Server Browser isn't an issue, but a choice by the Devs to not have.
* Lack of Mod Tools isn't an issue, but a choice by the Developers, which was previously stated that there are no plans for Mod Tools.
* Lack of Hardcore Dom, again, isn't a Bug or Issue, but a choice by the Developers.
* Lack of Vac / Anti-Cheat on each game is known, not a bug.

For the IW list,

* Can't Connect isn't a Bug, this is a normal, common connection problem that happens all the time, usually on the Client's end, not the game's.
* Mouse Lag is known and afaik fixed in the last patch. If not, get video footage showing it and the problem compared to normal behavior.
* Frame Lock option, again, isn't a Bug, more a missing feature. Make a post about it.
* Finding Match according to ping, again, is not a bug, more a feature. Make a post.
* Lack of Hardcore Dom is a Dev choice, not a bug, make a post suggesting it.",2016-11-19 22:27:37+00:00,da7gjet,,t1_da34qza,,Infinitewarfare

There has to be something that will distinguish 3arcZ Posts from IWZ Posts for me to Style with CSS. For example, a Flair, however, that's still not an easy implementation.

If we were to give users the ability to flair their own posts, only like a fourth would actually be flaired, which would be counterproductive. Most accurate system would be keyword detection and auto-flairing with a Bot. But, that's a huge task to create a fool-proof list of keywords that won't conflict yet will cover all aspects of each iteration of Zombies to flair all posts.

429,"&gt; Everybody is well aware of a discussion that happened in a PM that was then brought up in sub with 50 subscribers that can't be linked to anywhere on your subs? Really?

I'm not sure what you're talking about here... I'm talking about just recently when we were discussing in the comments of a thread, went horribly off-topic, and I cleaned up, then you went on to claim censorship or some shit.

&gt; Not true. Many other COD subs are banned too. /r/codiw was banned off the bat when you couldn't get control of it.

If you don't know the full situation please don't butt into it. /r/CODIW was banned because a Mod there, who I will not name, explicitly said that he's ""only not letting you (us) Moderate it for the sole purpose to piss you (us) off."" Why would we let a person like that promote his subreddit? That doesn't make any sense.

&gt; but we can't promote the sub we are using?

Keyword ""promote"" here. There's a difference between promoting and just spamming the /r/ on posts, many times, which was the *main* reason it was banned.

&gt; Why don't you show us the filter list for subs you have banned?

Not sure how that would help anything, just gives you another reason to complain.

&gt; I bet most of them are rarely even mentioned let alone spammed over and over.

I wasn't aware you were a mod and could see the many comments that get removed, my bad.

&gt; There is a different top mod in each COD sub you got. Top mod doesn't matter as long as one of you have it. We can just look at the other subs to see this ffs.

Because our Mod Team all has great chemistry and we work together well, we're a team not a group. Read again, I specifically said ""rando-top-mod"", meaning random top mod, somebody we don't know, ex: this sub and the 500 other knockoff subs.

&gt; That is what you want cause then you have less to look after. Hey, since you are going to close the sub and wont have to worry about modding it, 

*sigh*, I'm not going to discuss with you if you're just going to keep putting words in my mouth and assuming things you have no knowledge in. 

The whole rest of that paragraph is why you're close to being banned on the other subs, because since /r/BlackOps3 you've been a nonstop problem, and even banned before, and you threw a huge hissy fit about that. If you can't remain civil and constructively talk with me I'm not going to bother replying to you, simple as that.",2016-11-01 17:17:25+00:00,d9h283o,6.0,t1_d9h1muo,680.0,Cod4Remastered

Here and there, sure, but it wasn't heavily requested until just recently, and we listened. Not sure why you expect everything to go perfectly your way.

Failed to listen to the community? Lol, read my original comment, we're opening an MWR Subreddit, you even said that's what you've been asking for ""since MWR was announced""? You're tripping over your own invalid arguement here buddy.

Not responding /=/ Not listening, we've been working on setting up an MWR Sub for about a week now, which is when it started becoming highly requested, things aren't instant.

&gt; Is that what you are requesting I do to shut you up?

lol.

&gt; You guys messed up. Deal with it.

Not really, but ok.",2016-11-01 16:59:15+00:00,d9h1aa5,8.0,t1_d9h0a3p,1152.0,Infinitewarfare
432,"&gt; (we were in their sub, didn't want others to even know the questions)

I discussed with you, then it went way off-topic so I had to shut it down. I was and still am open to discussion if you'd like.

&gt; Hell, I'd be surprised if most of you even knew about this shady shit.

Everybody's well aware of this.

&gt; btw, this pic was of a former mod

Let me stop you right here lol. This guy, who I will not name, is a former mod, but even us, the so-called Hitler's of Reddit, are embarrassed that he was ever a mod. I won't go into super detail, but I'll let you know that dude is mentally unstable, did things of his own all the time as a mod, and is currently awaiting trial for prison. Take that as you will, but anything he did is not tied to us.

&gt; The former mod, who was asked to do this, was not allowed back on the team for not getting control of the sub.

Again, not sure where you even got this from, because that's not at all true lol. I'm assuming this is something he himself came up with and spread around, because as I said, he's unstable.

&gt; Why is this sub auto-banned on the other COD subs?

Because everytime MWR is mentioned you and the whole small group from here feel the need to go spam the sub name over and over trying to promote the hell out of it lol.

&gt; Your mod team scrambling to open a MWR sub WHEN ONE ALREADY EXIST

If by scrambling you mean giving you guys exactly what you want, yet you're still finding reasons to complain, sure.

&gt; Your mod team wont accept mod spots on other COD subs unless you have full control.

So, we put in days and days of our lives of work, get Devs setup and going on the sub, and moderate the shit out of it to make it great to the best of our ability, then one day the rando-top-mod that we don't at all know decides he doesn't want us around anymore, and poof, we're gone, and all of our hard work is too.

&gt; Why is /r/Blackops3 going to be closed?

The place is a wasteland now, and it's not going to be closed until 2017, giving the few people left there enough time to move on to whatever. The couple that'll for whatever reason stick around will be moved to /r/BlackOps3.",2016-11-01 16:55:24+00:00,d9h12xm,4.0,t1_d9gz3uz,2282.0,Cod4Remastered

552,"&gt; This sub needs mods who prevent that.

Believe me, we defuse these sorts of things as much as we feel is needed. There's a faint line between Moderating and Censoring that's hard for us to distinguish. We can't make everybody happy, if we ""over-moderate"" people cry censorship, if we ""under-moderate"" people cry that we're lazy.

Personally, if it's blind hate or stupidity such as ""LOL THIS GAME SUCKS BF1 RULES, INFINITE SHITFARE"" then I remove it, because it's not constructive and doesn't add anything of value to the subreddit. Obviously we want people on the subreddit to critique the game and give feedback for the Devs, but if it's just ignorance and not constructive we're going to get rid of it.

When it comes to people complaining about you critiquing the game, as long as it's not rule-breaking or the blind, ignorant hate as I mentioned above, we'll typically leave it alone. If there's something you feel needs to be removed report it, we review all posts and reports manually, so we'll see it and take action if we feel necessary.

Not true.

`A Xor B = C`

In this case, `A` is the 'New' Cutscene, `B` is the SoE Cutscene, and `C` is a Test Key.

So, because of the fact that the file sizes were exactly the same, we needed to check to see if the file was the SoE Intro Cutscene before wasting time. The Key we got from XOR'ing the SoE Cutscene with the 'New' Cutscene, when applied to the 'New' Cutscene, would only return the SoE Cutscene if it was actually the SoE Cutscene. If it wasn't, it'd be the wrong key to decrypt, and the file would come out as gibberish.

So obviously, since the key returned a **Playable** SoE Cutscene, that's what it is.

#IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION

Since it's still somehow unclear that OP is misleading you guys and misunderstanding, let me go even more in-depth.

There's more to this than just the C# Script that was provided. Also used in this was a Lua Script that Treyarch themselves made, the legit way of decrypting this File. The key we get from Xor'ing the SoE Cutscene with the 'New' Cutscene lines up perfectly with what the bytes would be.

When put through the Lua function in-game that's used to legitimately decrypt this file, we're also able to take the same key and decrypt other files, not just the one.

The key perfectly lines up with what the Lua function would create and use. You can also use said Key to decrypt other files.",2016-10-07 03:46:26+00:00,d8hgchs,1.0,t3_569gzz,647.0,CODZombies

818,"Hey!

Awesome to see a parent interested in helping their child pursue passions such as competitive gaming.

Firstly, as others have stated, you may want to ask this question over on /r/CODCompetitive, that's the dedicated subreddit for Competitive Call of Duty. However, that doesn't mean you won't get answers here.

Anyway, first you want to start off with the basics. Competitive Call of Duty is played on the PlayStation 4 System, he can find competitive games on Xbox One, though if he ever wanted to go Professional and join teams, PlayStation 4 is required at the moment. 

All Competitive Players will tell you sound is huge. This doesn't mean your son needs to go out and buy a $250+ Headset, start with a basic $50 one from Turtle Beach or such. Also, response time on the display he's playing on makes a world of a difference. Normal TVs around 32in+ have anywhere from a 10ms to 60+ms delay, meaning that what shows on screen is that much time behind when it's actually being done, on top of network delay. After a Headset, a Computer Monitor is your next purchase you want to make. Be sure to research and make sure the Monitor is no more than 5ms response time for best results. You'll want a 1920x1080 60hz Monitor as well for best quality on console gaming. Lastly is the controller, majority of Pro Players use what's called a Scuf Controller, this controller adds extra buttons and gives quite a big advantage when playing. Some Pro Players place their hands in a position called claw for the same advantage without the scuf controller, though it's not recommended to do so as it's not the most comfortable position.

When playing from home, Internet connection is a huge role. Your son will want to be on a wired internet connection for the lowest latency so that there's no problems when playing online. Faster Internet /=/ Lower Ping, however at very least you're going to want to have 5mbps Download and 5mbps Upload speeds, in my opinion.

Besides equipment, as with everything else, practice makes perfect. While your son should obviously focus on life things such as school before gaming, he's going to need to put in multiple hours a day if he wants to get anywhere with it.

For finding someone to play with, he can use both /r/COD_LFG and /r/CODCompPlays. Though as you stated, most players unfortunately aren't too welcoming to younger children.

Resources he can use to get into such things are [Gamebattles](http://gamebattles.majorleaguegaming.com/) and [UMG](http://www.umggaming.com/). Don't start off with wagers, obviously, until your son is comfortable with everything and thinks he can win. But one thing to always remember is that you can't always win, you're going to lose, you're going to lose money if you do wagers, use it as motivation to try harder and get better. 

I highly recommend your son check out and **study** how other Professional Players such as [Scump](https://www.youtube.com/user/Scumperjumper), [Crimsix](https://www.youtube.com/user/Crimsixian), [Clayster](https://www.youtube.com/user/Clayster), [JKap](https://www.youtube.com/user/JKapYT), and [Nagafen](https://www.twitch.tv/nagafen) play, what they do, how they handle situations, etc. Learn from them.

All it would've took is the user coming to us and asking what's up and how he could fix it. Before you jump to conclusions and say we're censoring new information (we're not, this is a cool find), see it from all sides.

1056,"&gt; In the beginning of that video he has like an infinite portable radar following him around, what's that all about?

Not completely sure, it might be the Recon Perk which lets you use Enemy UAVs.

&gt; Maps look a lot less 3-laney, which I like.

In the Mutliplayer Overview it actually specifically mentions 3 Lane Maps lol, but it doesn't seem to be as forced as BO3.

1058,"&gt; That actually looks sick. Wish the guy used more guns though, would like to get an idea of how more of them handle.

[Here's all Weapons, there's a little bit of commentary but it's mostly raw gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFUcrSLOJXQ). I just used this video as most prefer raw gameplay to get a feel for the game rather than commentary.

&gt; From that video the gameplay looks very IW, fast paced and snappy with a lower TTK.

Exactly, I love it, good ol' IW games.

&gt; does everyone have a health bar?

Yep! The Killcam also tells you how many shots you hit on them, similar to CS:GO. There's also On-Screen Callouts under the minimap, also like CS:GO.

&gt; Another thing is that I didn't notice any crazy advanced movement.

The more gameplay you watch the more you realize it's a toned down BO3. The boost don't go as high at all, and they seem a little slower. Definitely a step in the right direction for those who don't like the new movement.

&gt; I'm guessing it was a specialist ability when he transformed into a dog robot

Killstreak, second highest one. However there are Specialists-ish, but it's a bit different, see [this video for a complete description](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05bl6Cnu0Hc).

&gt; I wonder if they operate the same way or if there are Pro perks.

No Pro Perks

&gt; Overall it looks really fun to me. I was probably going to get it anyway, but now I definitely will. Hopefully a lot of you fucks do as well, instead of jumping to Battlefield or whatever else.

100% agree, and I'll definitely be on. You getting it on PS4 or X1? I moved to PS for DLC Exclusivity and slightly better performance, but if you have PS I'd be down to play it with ya for sure.",2016-09-03 20:03:52+00:00,d78c3bq,2.0,t1_d78blv3,794.0,redditblack

Information on an Origins Remake as well as other previous Maps has been in the game for the past few months now. Slowly but surely they've been adding stuff in every patch and hotfix. I've been watching how this evolves since the beginning, but I didn't want to say anything and get any hopes up just yet incase it happened to be scrapped, old, or not what we think it is.

I'll be doing a full post with information regarding all of the possible remade maps eventually, just haven't found the time to do so, there's a lot...

**It needs to be made clear that these DO NOT necessarily mean that there are Remakes, there is information here that suggests another form of using these assets from old maps. I'll explain further in my thread.**",2016-08-16 08:53:28+00:00,d6jh4gf,1.0,t3_4xy746,7091.0,CODZombies

Again, you do not know the full situation and you're speaking from a spectators perspective that had no insight on what was going on, whatsoever. You refuse to see the full side of the situation, all you're mentioning is the fact that *one* mod, keep in mind this was not me, said some terrible things, I had nothing to do with that. Not only that, but overall we were doing something that we felt the community would love and it would affect the community in a positive way. 

I don't know what your definition of treating people *like shit* is, but I wouldn't say going out of your way to better 60,000 people's experiences as well as spending hundreds of hours of your life making a nice experience for others is treating them *like shit*.

I'm not going to argue that I'm completely innocent, but step in my shoes. You've got tens of thousands of people that want your head on a stick, you've got nonstop PMs incoming that are harassing **(like you are to Siyliss)** and threatening you.

&gt; However, almost all the code [for /r/debate] I wrote myself because I wanted to tailor it better. So I took a css scraper and rebuilt the Naut theme.

I wouldn't say you ""rebuilt"" Naut, let alone you ""almost writing all the code yourself""... More like you ran it through a [basic CSS formatter](http://www.cleancss.com/css-beautify/) and added a couple of your own lines.

https://www.diffnow.com/?report=os56x

Not to mention you're using an old version of Naut compared to the one in the difference report, so there's quite a few differences because of that.

Even the images are exactly the same.

1947,"I explicitly said that Mods remove comments/threads that are instigating arguments, but they do not ban people over their opinions, at all.

You obviously don't know how Reddit works, do you? Mods can only **remove** comments from the subreddit, they cannot **delete** comments of others whatsoever. If you go to a user's profile the comment will still show up.

You're making false accusations saying that the Mods are hiding any negative feedback and keeping any positive feedback regardless if it breaks the rules? Please, show me a link, you have yet to prove anything (inb4 it's all of the sudden deleted excuse).

I don't think you realize you're talking with a Mod right now, huh? Lol, pretty bad when you go throwing false accusations around but can't back it up whatsoever. I will flat out call you a liar, I 100% doubt that you go around asking people who have been banned from here (there's not very many) what they were banned for. And even if you did, what says that they're telling you the truth? Smh.

Point being, Mods remove content that violates the rules regardless if it's positive about the game or not. You haven't provided me any proof of us leaving positive rule breaking content up, nor have you given me any proof of us banning someone strictly because they had a negative opinion about the game.

1970,"Wrong, but you're entitled to your own opinion, no matter how absurd it may be. I wasn't aware you know what's going on in my mind better than me.

If you care about free speech so much you can go to a subreddit that has no moderation whatsoever, see how you'll like it there. I still don't understand if you're complaining over the mass amounts of shit posts or complaining that we're doing our job as moderators and removing content that needs to be removed?

You can't use free speech as an argument, all I did was remove your post, we're still here discussing it, you're exaggerating. Obviously the removal of the posts is justified, have you not seen the excessive complaining about these posts? That's what the job of a moderator is, to remove posts that violate the rules. Once again, go to a sub with no moderation, see how awful it'd be. I'm not contradicting and yet again you're being ridiculous, you're upset because I removed a shit post and you're also upset that I didn't remove a shit post? Smh. If you see shit posts everyday with no upvotes, which I will flat out say is a lie, because I'm on here for hours a day removing posts and assisting the community. You can't expect posts to be removed immediately, if it bothers you that much then report the post and move on.

I handle things the way they need to be handled, if it's that big of a problem for you then that's your issue, not mine. You're right man, again, you know me much better than I do myself. 

You're more than allowed to voice your opinion, and I respect that, but when there's no way to question what's going on you can't complain over one post being removed. I'm here doing what needs to be done, removed probably around 50 posts today, half of which were probably posts saying *WHERE IS DLC3?!*, this sub would look like a complete shit hole if they were all let up. Go look in the many shitposts we've left up if you don't believe me, top comments are saying *Why is this shit still up?* and *Why's this not removed?*",2016-06-24 07:59:53+00:00,d4lzo4o,11.0,t1_d4lr4un,16979.0,CODZombies

* **Infinite Warfare:**
 * Honestly looked really good to me, especially since COD4 Remaster will be bundled, can't really complain there, getting the best of both worlds.
* **Titanfall 2:**
 * Loved Titanfall, just couldn't keep me interested for long due to lack of content. TF2 seems to have fixed that, here's to hoping.
* **Battlefield 1:**
 * Looked cool, though I'm betting it'll turn out how Battlefield does each year, all hype is lost after about a month into release. To be completely honest, BF1 doesn't look much different from BF4. #BF4.1
* **Death Stranding:** 
 * Looks pretty good, need to see more though. Might pick this up if I have extra cash.
* **Prey:**

We enforce Rule 3 much more than you probably think, I personally try to keep it down to 1 maybe 2 of the *Dank Memes* on the Front Page during these dry periods where we have nothing to discuss. And that's what the problem is, these dry streaks in between maps where's there's nothing for us to discuss or learn/share, so we're limited to Lower Quality Content, which I'd prefer Low-ish Quality Content over No Content, any day.

Also, there's TONS of failed attempts at *Dank Memes* that we remove daily, when it comes to these types of posts the Votes do matter, if a Meme is #1 on the Front Page obviously the community likes it, so that's fine. But if there's a one that's been downvoted profusely then we're going to take it down.

2198,"People praise him because he's more than just some dude who reads into code. It's the way he does things that people praise him for, he doesn't just flat out says *""Here's the steps, you do this, this, this, and this.""* He informs people that new stuff is there, gives them minor hints, and that's it. He doesn't spoil things, he doesn't giveaway steps, he gives the community a goal to look for without ruining the hunt for everybody else.

DF is more than just a *Data Miner* (for lack of a better term), he's a really great guy, and has done stupidly nice things for me personally (that I won't bring up unless he see's this and is okay with it). 

The fact that people are getting mad over this shit is ridiculous. Never once has he owed this community anything, if anything the community owes him. Ya know, prior to DF being popular around here, he was driven away and harassed by the community to the point of him deleting his Reddit account and people getting personal information of his. He voluntarily came back and helped this community, not only with EE Steps, but as a Moderator. We should be thankful for him, I know I am.

As for the him being wrong about the Apothican Servant, you do realize he doesn't just open the code and see

    ; Steps for AS Upgrade:
    1. Acquire AS
    2. Complete Rituals
    3. Place AS in Gateworm's Mouth
    4. ???
    5. Profit

right? 

Code is just a general idea of what you're supposed to do, it can easily be misinterpreted and he can be mislead. At the time of the AS Upgrade craze, DF shared with us what he knew based off of the code. Once he realized that the AS was infact not upgradable, he publicly told the community and apologized. The fact that you think he 100% knows the steps to every EE proves to me that you have no idea what you're talking about.

I don't remember him being wrong about the Distant Monster... In fact, as far as I'm aware, that thing hasn't even been fully solved other than the one clip of it that we have.",2016-05-20 20:44:51+00:00,d3de3cj,2.0,t1_d3ddclv,1084.0,CODZombies

&gt; Juggernog and Quick Revive sometimes spawn on each other, but you can still buy one of them at the other usual perk spawn point, the machine is just invisible

Sent this one in already.

&gt; This map features frequent pop in issues regarding doors and webs where they will appear to be unlocked/open, but will load in once you stand buy them for a second. They can't be interacted with in the interim between their loading in, so you can easily be trapped by an invisible web.

Will send this one in, if anybody can get a clip of this happening that'd help a ton!

&gt; If your teammate is eaten by the Thrasher in the tunnel leading to the KT-4 and machine part, and you kill the Thrasher in the water, your teammate will fly through the ceiling and you won't be able to reach him.

Will send this one in too, someone try and get a clip please.

&gt; Sometimes, a spider will disappear from the map entirely/go down the elevator shaft. To remedy this, you need to all down yourselves. The spider will then suicide and you will see a Max Ammo get picked up and the round change even though you're all looking at a game over screen.

Very odd, will send in, would help if somebody could get a clip.

&gt; Sometimes you can spawn into this map with a permanent white screen. Dying doesn't fix this; you must restart.

Another weird one, how often does this happen? Is it only in a solo game or multiple people who also have it? Need steps to recreate it if no video is provided it.

&gt; After picking up the Skull of Nansapwe, its initial use can cause a connection error pop up and then freeze your game.

Saw this one earlier on the sub, didn't bother sending in because I thought it was just a coincidence, I'll forward now.

&gt; Easter Egg progress is not saved even though you get a calling card and trophy from Shadows of Evil and Der Eisendrache respectively, necessitating a redo of these Easter Eggs for the map screen gate worm/summoning key.

Not sure if this one is necessarily a glitch, I'd assume they did it purposely.

I was just trying to say how frustrating it is that today's younger generation (mainly high school students) are all for Bernie then when you ask them why majority of them will say because he wants to legalize marijuana and a few other will say because of Free College (which is a terrible idea). Then when you go and try to tell them that Trump is doing that they agree with they start spouting how he's a *racist* and he's *sexist* and he wants to *get rid of all the Mexicans*, it's pathetic, everyone especially the younger generation has a hive mind towards Trump and they're too close-minded to realize that he's not as bad all the media and all those Facebook posts make him.

And if it means anything, I'm not pro-marijuana, but I'm not against it either. Personally I feel it should be legalized but it should be heavily controlled and restricted. Only reason I say it should be controlled or restricted is because I've personally experienced the outcome of marijuana use, but I'm not going into detail on Reddit.",2016-04-10 02:26:11+00:00,d1wutuy,4.0,t1_d1wr010,6648.0,The_Donald

That castle map was Stoneheaven, definitely the biggest one out of all of them. There were some nice sized ones like Strikezone, Warhawk, and Freight. They did a great job on DLC though, majority of the DLC Maps were good sized.",2016-03-22 15:01:56+00:00,d196i48,6.0,t1_d194m4w,2857.0,xboxone

Dark Matter is coming along nicely I gotta finish the 48 Dredge, Pistols, Snipers, and the Combat Knife then I'm done!

And posts have been made by other Moderators addressing the happenings, so don't try and make it sound like we just tried to sweep it under the rug.

You don't understand, it's not that I'm *not comfortable* giving the apology, it's that I don't want to deal with the psychopaths that are going to see it. If only you knew dude, lol, I've got numerous death threats and people telling me to kill myself, numerous hate messages, people messaging me on Xbox, people DMing me, and people following me into other Subreddits such as /r/TheWalkingDead, /r/RedditBlack, and others. Even had a dude who went out of his way to find all of my personal information including my Home Address, Full Name, Phone Numbers, Social Accounts, etc. If you really think that I still should come out and try and talk to you guys right now then I don't know what to tell ya.

Now, don't take this the wrong way, Wally is a great dude, good friend of mine, and I'm not trying to throw him under the bus here. But, I'm going to save myself from false hate before I save him. Look here: http://prntscr.com/aezh7z

I understand. Once again, I'm not saying it was the right thing to do. I can manage just fine, to be honest with you, I was having a good laugh for the first hour or so of the Mod-Free Weekend. I really wish you knew how much I do for /r/BlackOps3 and the other Subs that I Moderate, I'm not just some asshole who wants to ruin the community.

Yes, I was at the forefront, and I do expect to be held responsible. However, throwing around accusations that it was my idea when it has been stated by others that it wasn't isn't fair at all. If that's how you want to take it, so be it.

Yes, I did contribute to the overall spam, I never denied that, nor did I say it was the right thing to do, it was all a *heat of the moment* type of deal.

Not trying to rant about it, sorry if it came off like that.

We want the Sub to be community ran too, but there's a point where the Moderators gotta step in a little more and take control, this being that point. We're not completely ignoring users, but we're trying to show that it's not as bad as people are assuming it's going to be.

I really don't get what people mean when they say we're *power hungry*. What power do we get from being a Moderator of a Call of Duty Subreddit? It's not all fun and games like people seem to think.

I wasn't aware anyone was called a *salty fuck*? I'm almost positive it wasn't me, but at this point I'm too exhausted to know. If it was Gurr3nX then you really can't throw that one on me. He did step out of line, because he was pushed to that limit. He's a new mod, he couldn't handle the hate. He did step even further out of line than *salty fuck*, and he's since been removed from the Mod Teams, so hopefully that shows you we do care and we're not a bunch of *power hungry 12 year old assholes*.",2016-03-06 12:55:15+00:00,d0pjqgf,4.0,t1_d0pjmn5,400.0,CoDCompetitive
2911,"1. This is kinda dumb, but can you guarantee me that? I keep getting people who are saying that Alien Blue has no Sidebar Feature whatsoever? I don't own an iDevice so I'm kinda fucked here, no way for me to tell what's right and wrong. As for the Filter thing taking you to a browser window instead of a page in the app, obviously that's out of our control, but it's not like we can't make a noise about it and get it changed. I don't know the Subreddit for Alien Blue but it wouldn't at all be hard for them to have an option to open reddit links in the app, but that's up to them.

2. I disagree with this one, all it is is what 2 taps of your finger? Open Sidebar, open desired filter, done.

3. I'm not sure I completely understand that first part? Did I make a response such as that? Sorry, I'm lost right now, last 19 Hours have been me arguing with Redditors and watching /r/BlackOps3 burn down. I understand the issue with having 2 *active* games at a time, but is it really that big of a deal? You'll be up-to-date on the new game while still playing the current game, best of both worlds, no need for a filter. 

4. I do understand this one, and there's really nothing I can say to counter this. I mean, if all you want on your front page is new-cod content then there's no problem, you might get the occasional old-cod post, but that's it. If all you're wanting on your front page is old-cod content then you're wishing for a little too much, there's not much of that going around.

Yes, minus the Population Counts. This one isn't for sure yet, that's all up to our Bot guy to figure out when he gets back from vacation. Gurr was misinformed, he shouldn't have been spreading this feature as fact yet.

Hopefully my responses to your points above help change your mind a little on this one?

Thank you for having a civil conversation with me, I'm sorry if I come off as an asshole, last day and a half have been stressful as fuck, it's currently 6:47am but I can't sleep because I need to cover my ass on all this drama before I completely ruin any reputation I have left.

People also had an issue that they didn't want to see content from older games, just the current game. But lets be honest here, how much content do you expect to see from the older games? Maybe a post here and there, that's it. I explained this to them, same thing happened, Downvotes, told off, hate mail.

---

The point of the purge bullshit wasn't to be a bunch of assholes, it was to prove a point, which we did. We were told countless times that we don't do anything for the community, the community doesn't need us, and so on. So, we took the Week (or couple hours) off and watched things go to shit. Since it has been cleaned up.

What people don't get is that we're not evil assholes who are out to ruin your experience on Reddit, but I mean c'mon guys, it hasn't even happened yet and you're already complaining about how bad it's going to be? I'll be honest I was quite upset with the response we got from people, I was so excited to tell everyone about the merge and I thought they'd love it.

I'm more than open to feedback, suggestions, etc. *if* you can talk to me as a human being. I've count 37 Death Threats/Suggestions of Harm, and countless hate mail tonight.

If you go to /r/CODGhosts (and Disable CSS to get around the redirect) a Subreddit for a Game that is barely over 2 Years old, you'll see that it's dead, there's hardly any content. Now some may argue that that's just because it's one of the most unpopular in the series. So lets go back to /r/CODAW, barely over a year old, much more popular than Ghosts, still not a super popular game however. Same as /r/CODGhosts, hardly any content.

Now take the content from the 7? or so Subs that were merged, all of which were about as active as /r/CODGhosts, most less active. Do you think that those posts will put a dent in the posts from /r/BlackOps3? Not at all. I don't think the Flair Filters are even that necessary because everyone only cares about the current game, and that's what 90% of the content will be, it won't be hard to scroll paste the occasional post from an old game.

Flair Filters do work on Mobile, this is what people don't understand. Any App that allows you to see the Sidebar of a Subreddit will be able to use the Flair Filters, they won't be pretty buttons because you can't see CSS on the Mobile Apps, they'll just be Links. And for anyone who absolutely must use an App that doesn't support Sidebars, you can type in the search bar `flair:Black Ops 3` and you'll get the exact same page that you would if you used the Flair Filters.

For those that are worried they'll be annoyed by seeing AW content on their front page rather than BO3, lets be honest here, the newest COD will drown out the older ones, you're not going to see content from the un-popular COD within the first few pages of /Hot.

For those are are only interested in an older COD, Flair Filters will be your Best Friend, you're just one click away from the same experience you had on the old subreddit.

Let me explain Flair Filters as best as I can, I'm going to try and keep it as un-technological as possible so it's easy to understand.

You see the Images in the /r/BlackOps3 Sidebar that take you to the other Subreddits? Those are just Links that have been styled to be Images by using CSS. If you go look on Mobile you should just see the /r/CODZombies or whatever Link.

That's exactly how the Flair Filters will work. All they are are Links to the Search Page when searching `flair:Black Ops 3` for example. Yes, they will be changed via CSS to look like Buttons, but those who are saying Flair Filters don't work on Mobile are misinformed.

3081,"I could be wrong, but I don't think it's a Bot. It's more than likely just someone who is against the Call of Duty Community and feels that &lt;Game they like&gt; is 100x better. 

Despite what some people think, Mods have no way of telling who/what is voting on posts/comments. If we know who was doing it, they'd be gone by now. There's nothing we can do to control it, we can hide the Downvote Button via CSS but that can be bypassed by turning off Subreddit CSS in Preferences or browsing on Mobile.

This post is a magnet to it, that's why everything here is being downvoted. Someone saw a thread complaining about Downvotes and decided to come in and Downvote everything they can find, I'm sure multiple people have been doing this.

This happens in every Subreddit, but is typically more common in Gaming Subreddits (as Chef said).

If you can get me solid proof of what account is doing it, we'll take care of it. But afaik that's impossible to do.

EDIT: 1 Minute has passed, no Downvote... yet.

EDIT: 2 Minutes, still no Downvote. Pretty much proving my point, it' just a user (or user**s**) doing it.

EDIT: 3 Minutes, LMFAO I stand corrected, sitting at -1 right now.

EDIT: 4 Minutes, went back to 0 due to the people trying to counter all of this (props to you guys). I'll look into it, I really don't think it's a Bot.

The only thing that separates me from you is that I pick up after other people here, and that doesn't affect who's opinion is right, at all.

Explain more, I don't understand what you say I'm doing wrong. I'm removing the non-stop posts of people complaining and making assumptions and shitting on 3arc/ATVI for something that isn't a big deal.

And that's where I'm just going to say you're wrong, obviously that's my opinion, but I wholeheartedly disagree. I feel as if I do a very good job as a Mod, here and on /r/CODZombies. Shit, I've been holding this place down all by myself off and on for the past couple months.

All I did was change one little string of text to poke fun at those of you who are taking this so seriously. It's really not a big deal.

3136,"2 Posts so far where people suggested harming members of the ATVI and/or Treyarch Team, pretty shitty. I've been refreshing /New every few minutes since 4pm or so, trying not to let things get out of hand.

I'm not saying that people aren't allowed an opinion, they very much are. I understand where everyone is coming from, but I just don't think you guys are reacting the right way. By making tons of posts tell them they lied and they're money whores and they don't care, etc., etc. isn't okay. Yes, this is a BlackOps3 Sub, but could you imagine if we (I) let all of the shitty stuff stay up just because it's BlackOps3 related? It'd be awful, I'm trying to keep a positive environment here, no matter the circumstances, hopefully you understand where I'm coming from?

I'm not silencing them, I'm keeping things under control, if everybody was allowed to post whatever they wanted this place would look like /r/CallofDuty and we wouldn't have the amazing interaction that we do from Devs, nobody from ATVI/Treyarch would want to come here if they're just going to be shit on.

That's not something I'm going to do, just because I'm a Mod doesn't mean I'm not allowed to have an opinion. **Contrary to belief, myself nor the other mods are in any way affiliated with Activision or Treyarch**, we receive absolutely nothing from them, this is all volunteer work that we do on our own time.

It's already hard enough being the only really active Mod here that's Moderating for 55K+ people, cut me some slack.

Not even, every other day people here are complaining about *SBMM* and *Supply Drops* and *Combine 24/7* and *X Weapon is OP*, etc. Then people start huge boycotts, say the game is ruined, say Treyarch betrayed us, send death threats to Vahn, call Activision a bunch of money whores.

3174,"Not even close to there, this is the first time they've added a somewhat-viable weapon into the Supply Drops, and even then a post-patch Vesper or a fuckin RK5 could out gun that shit. Majority of the Weapons that they just released are melee and aren't even effective unless you're close to the enemy. I'm not saying they're completely useless, but pretty much any gun in the game could outgun a sword, any range. The Crossbow thing isn't OP as people are making it out to be, most of the gameplay everyone has seen is against recruit bots, wait until you go against actual people who shoot back and jump and shit, it won't be OP. I haven't seen any Gameplay of the AR but I'm assuming it'll be like an MK-14, which I do agree shouldn't be a supply drop thing, maybe a DLC1 Exclusive or $5.99 Micro DLC.",2016-02-09 22:26:35+00:00,czu089z,7.0,t1_cztztdm,557.0,blackops3

You're not at all forced to purchase the COD Points to get these weapons, if you care about them that much then you can throw money in and/or play more. It's nothing like Advanced Warfare, these are not Game-Changing Weapons, Advanced Warfare was in a way *Pay-to-Win*, Black Ops 3 is not, at all.

3497,"Soon we'll be upgrading to /r/Naut 4.0, currently we're using a heavily customized /r/Naut 3.2.

I'm curious if you guys would rather a Dark Theme like we currently have, or would you rather have a Light Theme?

We're still going to have a very nice looking CSS, I know many of you love the current one (I'm flattered), but it's time to upgrade.

There are advantages and disadvantages to both of these:

##Dark Mode:

**Advantages:**

* More *suiting* to the Zombies Theme.
* Not so hard on the eyes, great for viewing at night.

**Disadvantages:**

* Many plugins (cough RES cough) conflict with a custom Dark Mode like we have, and cause problems like a lot of you have been having lately.
* /r/Naut 4.0 doesn't support Dark Mode out of the box, which would mean I'd have to do it myself. If you know anything about CSS, it's a VERY tedious task, basically means I'll have to go around to all the Subreddit Pages and Right Click&gt; Inspect Element and Style that specific spot of the page until everything is styled. By all means, I can and will do it if you guys really want it, so don't think I'm lazy haha.

##Light Mode:

**Disadvantages:**

* Doesn't necessarily fit the Dark Theme of Zombies.
* Wouldn't be as unique compared to other Subreddits using /r/Naut 4.0.

**Advantages:**

* TONS more room for other CSS Features, such as new flairs, etc., etc.
* Will allow for me to get the new css update to you faster.",2016-01-13 23:54:58+00:00,cyxakx0,1.0,t3_40uuws,755.0,CODZombies

Pretty sure he's talking about the PS4 Community Feature, from my understanding it's kinda like an alternate friends list but you can add whoever you like to it, and there's no limit.

Lack of effort from the Mods? I seriously don't understand how you even got this idea. Did you not take the time to look at the multiple cases of evidence I showed you, did you not read my post at all? You're delusional man, you need to hop down from your podium for a moment and look at this from someone else's perspective other than your selfish, invalid perspective.

Rude? Sure. What would you call this then? It's definitely not helpful in any way, all you're doing is causing more drama and problems. You still have yet to give me any insight on how you would fix the *problems*. So yes, this is a rant, exaggeration, lie, shit post, whatever you may call it. 

You say you don't want to make it personal yet you sit here and call me out on something that I volunteered to do and try and tell me I'm doing it wrong. You're one of the very few people who have this opinion, according to many other people in this community this Sub is very well Moderated. Make it personal, shit dude, I don't care, you're insulting me on something that I love, that's personal to me.

No, not what I *think* people experience, what I *know* people experience. Ask any of the regulars here, I'd bet they'd say that they don't have any of these problems that you seem to have. I don't know what your problem is but if you're having this many problems browsing this clean of a Subreddit, I love to see you go through others.

Again, you're dodging my statements and questions because you have no arguement here. You try and say that you *don't care* but in reality you and I both know that you don't have any response to it because you're in the wrong here.

I go to great extents to correct someone who I know is wrong and is calling me out on something that I very much care about. Funny how you go to such great extents to try and argue your point yet you sit here and dodge half of my post and still try to act as if you're right.

Never have I ever told anyone here that they're allowed to leave, so congrats, you're the first. I care about the people here, not so much for you because you're not helping anything here, just going on your rant acting entitled. No, I don't just tell them to fuck off if they offer grievance, usually I'll try and reason with them, work things out, as for you you're a little too hard headed I can tell. /u/Fedor1, original creator of this Subreddit made me a Mod.

I'm not going to be patient, kind, and reasonable with someone who's main goal is to cause problems. No one of significance? Hah, you've been a Redditor for 21 Days, you act as if you've been here for so long and the Sub has just been so awful for you. You're barely even a part of this Community. 

I'm not fired up at all, you seem to have the wrong impression, I'm actually getting a kick out of this, all I see is some new guy to Reddit trying to tell me I'm doing my job wrong and avoiding in every way possible when I ask him to help me better myself.

Go ahead, PM a different Mod, they're going to tell you the same things I'm telling you. All I see is you avoiding the problem here.

3645,"Alrighty, sheesh, here we go. First, let me tag the other Mods so they see this and are on the same page as I am. /u/ChefSlapChop /u/TheCraffey /u/JoyousCacophony /u/Mastadge

Firstly, I like to disagree, I feel like compared to other subs this sub is actually very well Moderated. Obviously I'm biased and that's just my opinion, but honestly if you were able to see the work I and the other Mods do you'd probably agree.

Who are these people that are looking for trouble? If you don't want to publicly call them out, PM/Mod Mail us. You can't expect us to see every comment on every thread every day, that's just impossible no matter how many Mods we've got patrolling the Subreddit.

With the recent influx of new users from Christmas you can't expect everyone to know everything that us *veterans* do. We remove **TONS** of threads a day, most are reposts and low-quality content. But, some of these posts we purposely leave up. Think about it, if a new user comes to the subreddit and uses the search bar to see if their topic has been posted before they might not find it because there's only one or two topics about it, however the more topics about a single subject the better because in the end that means less reposts. Of course once something is heavily reposted we'll make sure to remove it just to keep the Sub clean.

I do think that people need to be reminded of the Rules, and we'll probably have a Sticky up soon to remind people of the Rules and what's okay and what's not okay. I do agree with you on this, but that's to be expected with the new users.

Twitch Streams, honestly don't know what you mean with this one. The **only** Twitch Stream that has been allowed is /u/TheReal_DF's. And no, this isn't us picking favorites, or being biased. DF has done so much for this Subreddit despite the fact that he's been harassed to the point of deleting his original reddit account. DF confirmed for us that there was no EE on The Giant, he has provided us with as much information as possible regarding the Cocoons in SOE, and he's even offered to host a Bot for us which I will talk about in a sec. The least we could do is allow him to advertise his stream a little bit, which will not be a permanent thing. He is well aware that after this EE is solved he won't be able to post his streams.

We're working out ways to allow for users to show their streams without cluttering the Subreddit. Currently I like the idea of using Twitchy_The_Bot to allow for our users to advertise their streams, but we haven't completely worked this out yet. Expect it soon unless things change.

I'm just gonna say it, *""I'm sifting through loads and loads of bull just to find a relevant, legal posts""* is a lie and exaggeration. This Sub really isn't as cluttered and bad as you're trying to make it out to be. What you don't understand is that we volunteer to do this, you can't expect us to be on here 24/7 Moderating and checking every little thing. We're not getting payed, we're not Activison/Treyarch Representatives, we're just normal players like you and the rest of the people here. We like to play the game just as much as you guys do, we have family, friends, plans, and Jobs. I honestly probably spend the most time on the Sub, on a Weekday I probably spend 3-4 Hours on Reddit, on Weekends probably near 7-8, whether that time be spent moderating (most of it is), or just interacting with the community. Chef is definitely in 2nd place for most of the work done here, he does just about as much as I do. I'd say Joyous and Craffey are tied but that's only because Craffey is a New Mod and Joyous Mods a load of Subreddits. Mastadge doesn't do too much here, and I'm not calling him out or anything, we're all good friends, he just isn't around the Subreddit. Mastadge has his own reasons for that, I'm not trying to be a dick, but you can't say that we have 5 Active Mods when we've really got 2 Active Mods and 2 that are half active (not including AutoMod).

Find something you don't like on the Subreddit and think it should be removed? Fucking report it, especially comments, there's literally no way you can expect us to see everything that you guys see.

Posts that are outside of the Megathread are usually removed and the person is corrected, again, you're exaggerating and making a big issue out of a couple posts that don't get removed.

Nothing is being done properly? Lmao, take a look at [this](http://prntscr.com/9jb62l), or [this](http://prntscr.com/9jb694), or [this](http://prntscr.com/9jb6g1), or [this](http://prntscr.com/9jb6s9), and many more...

More of a place to promote because 1 of 16.5k Users are allowed to post their stream once every other day? That's just fucking stupid, you've gotta be kidding, right?

People are being reprimanded for their actions, if you think otherwise you're mistaken. We like to maintain our friendly relationship with the community we have here, we don't want to be *Nazi Mods* and make everyone hate us. I don't like to be an asshole but seriously this post is just ridiculous, you assume and exaggerate.

Can't take it seriously anymore? You're allowed to leave. All I see is complaining from you without anything helpful in here. You're not suggesting any changes, all this post is doing is telling us is *""Hey! I don't like the way you're doing things, but I'm too busy complaining about the little things to suggest something that might actually fix the problems.""* Want to see these so called *outrages problems* fixed? Do something about it.

3656,"Yes, very much. It really isn't as bad as people make it out to be. Obviously Treyarch Zombies is far superior, but it's not 100% shit. $40 for the Full Game + All DLC? Fuck yeah, take that deal. You'll probably be able to knock out all of the Easter Eggs within a week, they aren't difficult at all, the only one you'll probably have trouble with is the Carrier EE, that one is annoying, never ended up completing it. The EE for Descent is pretty cool, Outbreak and Infection EEs are super simple.

Outbreak is a very basic map, great for high round attempts.

Infection was my favorite despite the fact that everybody hated it. Remove the whole *Toxic Gas* thing and it's an amazing map.

Carrier, pretty good map, the Bomb Defusing part is pretty stupid imo. First game on that Map got to Round 35 then had to quit because someone was leaving. Like I said, the EE is fucking annoying because you've gotta land certain patterns of grenade types in a moving machine, then after that you've gotta rely on pieces for the next step to drop from certain types of zombies, and after all that bullshit you've gotta go dig around in a set amount of time and try to find the treasure which for some reason was impossible for me to find.

Descent is a very fun map to play, great for high rounds other than the fact that you've got the Oz teleport thing, which I didn't like. I thoroughly enjoyed doing the EE on that map.

3761,"Found something that you think shouldn't be on the Subreddit? Report it.

We're on this Subreddit a lot, we try and check every post and delete what we feel is necessary. But, we can't be on here 24/7, we like to play too, we have lives too. That's why we need you guys to Report, even if it's something small, if it's already been on the Subreddit or if it's a misleading title, **Report it**, we'll review it and if we agree it should be taken down, it will.

With some recent AutoMod Rules that I've added Clickbaity Titles will be automatically reported, no more of that *Don't Upvote* Bullshit, etc. Titles with Confirmed will also be reported until we review them and verify if it was actually confirmed or not.

Obviously we're not going to ban someone just because they posted something that may have already been posted. But those who coninuously post shit that's already been found will be banned. Sometime we'll let something passed because there may only be 1 or 2 posts about it. Think of it like this: NewUser1 comes to the Subreddit and uses the search bar to check if something has already been posted, NewUser1 doesn't see anything he's looking for so he posts it, thus making a repost. However, that repost could've easily been avoided if it was easier to find via the search bar. The more results for one topic, the less chance it has to be reposted in the future.

 * The 9:1 Rule - While you can post your content, the content must be original and you will be held to the 9:1 rule. That means you must post 9 submissions for every 1 piece of your own content you submit. Your very first submission on our subreddit cannot be self-promotion.

 * Posts that apply to this ratio - Link posts are the majority of what will be counted towards this ratio. But, quality text/self-posts will be counted towards your ratio. Moderators can use discretion to apply other submissions into the ratio. For example, if you have a link to a pro's video, official announcement videos, relevant tweets from a developer or valid source, a couple quality discussion threads, and a video of your own, This will be allowed under the 9:1 rule as long as the posts are still relevant to the subreddit. Click bait titles will not count towards your ratio

 * Details - If the ratio of self-promotion content goes over the 9:1 ratio outlined in our rules, further such content will be removed until the ratio goes down. If this behavior continues, the account will be banned from /r/blackops3. If the self-promotion is continued with other accounts or in other subreddits, the entire domain or brand could be banned site-wide! There is a site wide 10:1 ratio policy. If you do not understand this, message a mod for clarification. For more information, check out reddit's guide to self-promotion.

* **Self-Promotion:** 

 * The 9:1 Rule - While you can post your content, the content must be original and you will be held to the 9:1 rule. That means you must post 9 submissions for every 1 piece of your own content you submit. Your very first submission on our subreddit cannot be self-promotion.

 * Posts that apply to this ratio - Link posts are the majority of what will be counted towards this ratio. But, quality text/self-posts will be counted towards your ratio. Moderators can use discretion to apply other submissions into the ratio. For example, if you have a link to a pro's video, official announcement videos, relevant tweets from a developer or valid source, a couple quality discussion threads, and a video of your own, This will be allowed under the 9:1 rule as long as the posts are still relevant to the subreddit. Clickbait titles will not count towards your ratio

 * Details - If the ratio of self-promotion content goes over the 9:1 ratio outlined in our rules, further such content will be removed until the ratio goes down. If this behavior continues, the account will be banned from /r/CODZombies. If the self-promotion is continued with other accounts or in other subreddits, the entire domain or brand could be banned site-wide! There is a site wide 10:1 ratio policy.

* **Weekly Thread:** The submission you posted has a relevant weekly thread that is either stickied to the top of the subreddit now, or scheduled to be over the coming week. Please save your post for the thread!

* **Self-Promotion:** 

 * The 9:1 Rule - While you can post your content, the content must be original and you will be held to the 9:1 rule. That means you must post 9 submissions for every 1 piece of your own content you submit. Your very first submission on our subreddit cannot be self-promotion.

 * Posts that apply to this ratio - Link posts are the majority of what will be counted towards this ratio. But, quality text/self-posts will be counted towards your ratio. Moderators can use discretion to apply other submissions into the ratio. For example, if you have a link to a pro's video, official announcement videos, relevant tweets from a developer or valid source, a couple quality discussion threads, and a video of your own, This will be allowed under the 9:1 rule as long as the posts are still relevant to the subreddit. Click bait titles will not count towards your ratio

 * Details - If the ratio of self-promotion content goes over the 9:1 ratio outlined in our rules, further such content will be removed until the ratio goes down. If this behavior continues, the account will be banned from /r/blackops3. If the self-promotion is continued with other accounts or in other subreddits, the entire domain or brand could be banned site-wide! There is a site wide 10:1 ratio policy. If you do not understand this, message a mod for clarification. For more information, check out reddit's guide to self-promotion. If you do not want to participate in the community, the correct way to advertise your content on reddit is to purchase an ad! It's cheap, works better and won't get you into any trouble.

 * The 9:1 Rule - While you can post your content, the content must be original and you will be held to the 9:1 rule. That means you must post 9 submissions for every 1 piece of your own content you submit. Your very first submission on our subreddit cannot be self-promotion.

 * Posts that apply to this ratio - Link posts are the majority of what will be counted towards this ratio. But, quality text/self-posts will be counted towards your ratio. Moderators can use discretion to apply other submissions into the ratio. For example, if you have a link to a pro's video, official announcement videos, relevant tweets from a developer or valid source, a couple quality discussion threads, and a video of your own, This will be allowed under the 9:1 rule as long as the posts are still relevant to the subreddit. Click bait titles will not count towards your ratio

 * Details - If the ratio of self-promotion content goes over the 9:1 ratio outlined in our rules, further such content will be removed until the ratio goes down. If this behavior continues, the account will be banned from /r/blackops3. If the self-promotion is continued with other accounts or in other subreddits, the entire domain or brand could be banned site-wide! There is a site wide 10:1 ratio policy. If you do not understand this, message a mod for clarification. For more information, check out reddit's guide to self-promotion. If you do not want to participate in the community, the correct way to advertise your content on reddit is to purchase an ad! It's cheap, works better and won't get you into any trouble.

 * Details - If the ratio of self-promotion content goes over the 9:1 ratio outlined in our rules, further such content will be removed until the ratio goes down. If this behavior continues, the account will be banned from /r/blackops3.

For example, if you have a link to a pro's video, official announcement videos, relevant tweets from a developer or valid source, a couple quality discussion threads, and a video of your own, This will be allowed under the 9:1 rule as long as the posts are still relevant to the subreddit. Clickbait titles will not count towards your ratio

 * Details - If the ratio of self-promotion content goes over the 9:1 ratio outlined in our rules, further such content will be removed until the ratio goes down. If this behavior continues, the account will be banned from /r/CODZombies. If the self-promotion is continued with other accounts or in other subreddits, the entire domain or brand could be banned site-wide! There is a site wide 10:1 ratio policy. If you do not understand this, message a mod for clarification. For more information, check out reddit's guide to self-promotion. If you do not want to participate in the community, the correct way to advertise your content on reddit is to purchase an ad! It's cheap, works better and won't get you into any trouble.

* **Self-Promotion:** 

 * The 9:1 Rule - While you can post your content, the content must be original and you will be held to the 9:1 rule. That means you must post 9 submissions for every 1 piece of your own content you submit. Your very first submission on our subreddit cannot be self-promotion.

 * Posts that apply to this ratio - Link posts are the majority of what will be counted towards this ratio. But, quality text/self-posts will be counted towards your ratio. Moderators can use discretion to apply other submissions into the ratio. For example, if you have a link to a pro's video, official announcement videos, relevant tweets from a developer or valid source, a couple quality discussion threads, and a video of your own, This will be allowed under the 9:1 rule as long as the posts are still relevant to the subreddit. Click bait titles will not count towards your ratio

 * Details - If the ratio of self-promotion content goes over the 9:1 ratio outlined in our rules, further such content will be removed until the ratio goes down. If this behavior continues, the account will be banned from /r/blackops3. If the self-promotion is continued with other accounts or in other subreddits, the entire domain or brand could be banned site-wide! There is a site wide 10:1 ratio policy. If you do not understand this, message a mod for clarification. For more information, check out reddit's guide to self-promotion. If you do not want to participate in the community, the correct way to advertise your content on reddit is to purchase an ad! It's cheap, works better and won't get you into any trouble.

 * Posts that apply to this ratio - Link posts are the majority of what will be counted towards this ratio. But, quality text/self-posts will be counted towards your ratio. Moderators can use discretion to apply other submissions into the ratio. For example, if you have a link to a pro's video, official announcement videos, relevant tweets from a developer or valid source, a couple quality discussion threads, and a video of your own, This will be allowed under the 9:1 rule as long as the posts are still relevant to the subreddit. Click bait titles will not count towards your ratio

 * Details - If the ratio of self-promotion content goes over the 9:1 ratio outlined in our rules, further such content will be removed until the ratio goes down. If this behavior continues, the account will be banned from /r/blackops3.

* **Self-Promotion:** 

 * The 9:1 Rule - While you can post your content, the content must be original and you will be held to the 9:1 rule. That means you must post 9 submissions for every 1 piece of your own content you submit. Your very first submission on our subreddit cannot be self-promotion.

 * Posts that apply to this ratio - Link posts are the majority of what will be counted towards this ratio. But, quality text/self-posts will be counted towards your ratio. Moderators can use discretion to apply other submissions into the ratio. For example, if you have a link to a pro's video, official announcement videos, relevant tweets from a developer or valid source, a couple quality discussion threads, and a video of your own, This will be allowed under the 9:1 rule as long as the posts are still relevant to the subreddit. Clickbait titles will not count towards your ratio

 * Details - If the ratio of self-promotion content goes over the 9:1 ratio outlined in our rules, further such content will be removed until the ratio goes down. If this behavior continues, the account will be banned from /r/CODZombies. If the self-promotion is continued with other accounts or in other subreddits, the entire domain or brand could be banned site-wide! There is a site wide 10:1 ratio policy. If you do not understand this, message a mod for clarification. For more information, check out reddit's guide to self-promotion. If you do not want to participate in the community, the correct way to advertise your content on reddit is to purchase an ad! It's cheap, works better and won't get you into any trouble.

4690,"So, let me get this straight, you want us to completely remove any opinions people have just because you don't like to hear what other people have to say?

What's your definition of *Shit Posting*, because I think you and I have different ideas of what a *Shit Post* is. From what I'm understanding, you're saying that a *Shit Post* is any post where someone states their opinion on a subject. However, I believe a *Shit Post* is something that is slightly off-topic or isn't really necessary. This Subreddit isn't just for News and Facts, it's a place for people to come and discuss the game and share their opinions over it.

While I do agree that there has been somewhat of an increase in *Shit Posting* and *Reposts*, that's to be expected with the recent rise in Leaks and News, you can't expect people not to give an opinion on something that they just recently learned about.

I whole heartedly disagree with this *Basing Thread* Idea. Just because someone dislikes a feature doesn't mean their *Bashing* either. We'll obviously remove posts that need to be, for example *""The New Afterlife is fucking gay, I hate it.""* is not okay, however *""I really don't like the new afterlife, here's why...""* is okay.

I'm not sure if this is possible, simply because Naut adds the Shadows to everything itself. However you could try this line of code below, let me know if it works.

    .side:before {
        box-shadow: none;
    }

---

&gt; do I need to create any new elements, or can everything be done with the existing ones?

I think I understand this question. Yes, leave the base Naut code exactly how it was when you got it. If you need to change something, *create a new element* for it.

You may already know this, but to figure out what it is you need to change, Right Click and click Inspect Element, you'll see the CSS of the current Object on the right side, as you can see [in this Screenshot I'm Inspecting the *Cancel* Button, the Element for it is `.usertext button {` ](http://prntscr.com/8jqo5t)

Use that Code for your Sidebar Image. **Be sure to change the Height to the Height of your Image + 16px!** Of course change the Border Bottom Color to match your `body` color.

As for Customization, go check out some other Subs that you like and look through their CSS. To check a Subreddits CSS use `Reddit.com/r/SUBREDDITHERE/about/stylesheet`. I recommend checking out one of the Subs I designed /r/CODZombies. I also highly encourage you to go look at some of /u/RenegadeAI's Subreddits, he also has [this page](https://github.com/RenegadeAI/NautAddons) that has great Addons.

The original Naut code should be just one big paragraph (or line), your addons should be separate. The position on your Stylesheet doesn't affect where the element you're editing is at on your page. However, if you have (for example) `body { background-color: #000;}` at the top of your Stylesheet then you put `body { background-color: #FFF;}` at the bottom of your Stylesheet, the #FFF Background is going to *overwrite* the #000 Background.

5527,"&gt; Why do you want to be a moderator of /r/GrandTheftAutoV?

Would love to give it a CSS Overhaul, as well as patrol and keep out the abusive content/users.

&gt; What's your time zone?

Central Time, I'm located in Kansas.

&gt; How often will you be around? (This includes weekdays and weekends).

Every day for multiple hours, I'm very active on Reddit.

&gt; What prior experience do you have?

Mod of /r/CODZombies with nearly 10k Subscribers. **TONS** of Experience with CSS, check out /r/CODZombies, /r/Treyarch, /r/InfinityWard and soon /r/THPS.

&gt; If there was one rule / disallowed submission you could remove, which would it be?

Maybe crack down on the excessive and bland .gifs/images, personally I think it'd be better to have more discussions regarding the game, rather than the front page me loaded with Images and .gifs.

&gt; If there was one rule / disallowed submission you could add, which would it be?

Users that are here just to *flame* or cause problems should not be tolerated.

&gt; How often do you play GTAV?

Almost Daily.

&gt; What's your favorite post here?

Honestly, haven't been a long-time user of this Subreddit, mostly I just lurk around here. So, don't really have a favorite...

&gt; What's your favorite car / bike in-game?

I feel like this one is very popular, but the Zentorno is definitely my favorite.

5642,"I'd like to enter my Brother into this Giveaway.

I have a 14 Year Old Brother named Issac, he was born 1lb 11oz (about 0.77kg) and almost 2 months earlier than his original due date. As you could probably infer, this caused a load of health problems for him. He was stuck on a ventilator for the first 8 weeks of his life. My parents were told that he *probably* wasn't going to make it. He had open heart surgery around 2 weeks after he was taken off of the ventilator.

Since then he has been Diagnosed with Asthma, ADHD, Chronic Lung Disease, and Autism, he is also *Legally* Blind. He was in and out of the Hospital for multiple years with Lung and Heart problems, as well as pneumonia and seizures. We lived in the State of Georgia for a few years but we were forced to pack things up and move as soon as possible because the dry air was awful for my brother.

Today he is a 14 Year Old, ~100lbs Freshman in Highschool. He loves Video Games, his favorite games are definitely Mario, Grand Theft Auto, and Sonic The Hedgehog. Up until about a Year ago, the only thing he had to game on was a Nintendo DSi. My single income Family has always been in a bit of a Financial Struggle due to my Mother's health problems, so last Christmas (December 2014) my Brother was given a Playstation 2. As you could probably imagine, he was so pumped!

I feel pretty bad for him, he loves video games, but he's held back by an Out-Dated Console. I'd love to see the look on his face when/if I was able to get him a PC!

**He is currently sleeping, when he wakes up I will see if he's willing to take a Picture with my Reddit Username on a piece of paper, for those of you who don't believe me.**

Nvidia, would you be willing to help me make my Brother's Dreams come true?

Here's the Build I threw together for him, there is no CPU Cooler, Case, or OS, but I think I could try and find the CPU Cooler and Case for him. As for the OS, I have an extra key laying around for Win7.

**Thank you for doing this Nvidia!**

Monitors typically have a lower Response Time and Input Lag, meaning you'll see what's happening in game a few milliseconds faster, it's not a huge advantage, but you can definitely tell. I play on a 1ms Response Time Monitor and I literally cannot play on any TV anymore, it just feels so delayed.

The sub 32"" Monitor is just because your eyes can't really process a large screen as fast and efficiently as they would on a Monitor. Most people including myself prefer a 24"" or 27"".

5741,"Huge fan of this game, really don't understand all of the hate for it. I have my things that I love about it, but there's also a few things I don't like...

##Likes:

 * **Exo Suits** - I like them, they were a cool idea. However I do prefer Black Ops 3's movement system, it feels a lot more fluid and it's not as crazy as Advanced Warfare's, nevertheless I still really liked it.

 * **Weapon Variants** - This one is a bit controversial for some people, including myself. While I really liked the idea, and it made the game have a lot more variety, Variants had their issues. Some are *too much* better. Steed, Speakeasy and Insanity come to mind.

 * **Campaign** - This one isn't discussed too much, but I for one had a great time playing through the Campaign. I've beat it around 5 times, first time for the experience, second for the achievements, third for the Veteran Achievement, and the other 2 were just for fun.

 * **(Advanced) Supply Drops** - This one kinda goes in hand with the Weapon Variants. I really liked the idea, I feel as if it added variety to the game, however they kinda ruined it when they started money-whoring off of them, but we'll save that for the *Dislikes*.

 * **Uplink** - Oh man, I loved this game mode. So much fun to play with friends, or even alone and just see how many points you can score. Great game mode, happy to see it return in BO3.

##Dislikes:

 * **Purchasable ASDs** - This is where SHG/ATVI fucked up, they had a good thing going with SDs, I liked the idea. But once they started making tons of items ASD Exclusive is when they lost my respect, it was a blatant money grab.

 * **Balancing/Variety** - Of course every game is going to have its *Over-Powered* and *Under-Powered*, but with Advanced Warfare it's ridiculous. Weapons such as the Bal-27, ASM1, HBRa3 perform so much better than Weapons such as SN6, Bulldog, MK14, AK12, etc. **I understand that this is a problem in the community, not just the Statistics. It's a problem that everyone feels they can only use the Bal/ASM1 because they have a much better advantage over the other weapons.**

 * **Map Design** - I didn't necessarily *hate* the Maps in Advanced Warfare, but I felt 3-4 stories was too much. Black Ops 3 did it right, they accounted for the advanced movement in their maps, without making fuckin' skyscrapers for people to sit on and have an advantage over the players on the ground.

 * **SHG's Laziness/Lack of Patches** - They were more focused on reskinning cosmetic items rather than fixing the 3 ways to get Out of the Map on Detroit, that glitch was around for **MONTHS**, that is a problem. And that's just one of the glitches that was around for way too long, the Ascend Out of Map was around for quite some time too.

There's definitely some things that I missed, but these are just the big ones for me.",2015-09-05 22:03:36+00:00,curwawo,1.0,t3_3jsf2v,1970.0,CodAW

Play it safe, if you aren't sure if you're going to hit more than one shot, don't go for it. Always ADS with Shotguns, unless you're at point blank range and you know at least 2 Pellets will hit.

We don't know too much about the CEL-3, but we do know that at close range it does 50dmg per pellet, this weapon shoots 8 pellets. With 50dmg for every 1 pellet, you can do the math and know that you're going to need at least 2 pellets to hit to kill your enemy, if you ADS your pellet spread is going to be a lot lower and you'll be a lot more likely to 1HK at close range. At long range each pellet does 20dmg, meaning you're going to need 4 of those 8 pellets to hit if you want to 1HK at long range.

More excited, I don't know how I'm going to handle AW for the next couple months until BO3 Release.

I really liked the Movement, felt similar to Titanfall which I enjoyed. The Map flow was great for the Movement system. Not too much to complain about, the Hit Detection felt a little off, other than that it was great. Not including the the Crashing/Freezing since it was a Beta.

Specialists. When they were first announced, I didn't really like the idea. However once we actually got to play with them, I fell in love.

A Nuke Killstreak. Nuclear Medals are fun and all, but K.E.M. Strikes and DNA Bombs felt so much more rewarding.

Very confident. Treyarch has yet to make a game that I disliked, can't say the same for IW, SHG is meh. #InVahnWeTrust

[He stepped down as Mod](https://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/3f33w8/stepping_down_as_mod/?ref=search_posts).

&gt; Second, there are way to many ""which DLC should I get?"" And ""what's your favorite map?"" And ""what's your favorite character/box gun/wonder weapon?"" Etc. just repetitive, low level content

Please report these sorts of posts whenever you see them, we try to remove them, but it's impossible for us to see everything in the Sub. If you report them then we'll for sure see it.

&gt; Third, click bait. Titles like ""Exo zombies"" or ""I need help"" or ""this is cool"" or ""so...."" Etc. tiles like this are really annoying.

We try our best to remove posts with Clickbait Titles, as it is in fact against the Rules. Again, please report these whenever you do see them.

&gt; Is there anyway to regulate types/titles of posts to make this sub less full of low level content and click bait titles? It was never like this before.

Not exactly, all we can do is hope that people report them, or we see them. **IMO** this Sub was a lot worse before, especially with the YouTube Spam and Party Up Posts. Please let us know what we're doing wrong, we'd love to improve the overall user experience.",2015-08-15 16:42:41+00:00,cu4025n,2.0,t1_cu1a1dz,214736.0,CODZombies

Thanks so much for supporting our studio’s Sixth Anniversary and #HammerWeek this week! This year was all about celebrating the incredible year of Advanced Warfare with fans. Last year we unveiled the first screen from AW’s multiplayer, and this year we’re running unique MP programs including #2XLegendary and Legendary Gear gifting. 

We're so excited to be able to grant the Ronin Mask to all the fans of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare today. As you may have noticed, the Ronin Mask is the Legendary Variant of the Sentinel Recon Mask, and is visually related to the challenge-based Marksman Mask. This particular mask is near and dear to everyone that works at the studio, being featured on the cover of one of our first in depth game features in July 2015’s Edge Magazine cover – essential reading material for eager fans last year to find out more about AW prior to its release. The full set (pictured below) is a special variant set commemorating that memorable moment in our studio history. It features a digital camo and red accents for a totally badass Legendary Gear Set as part of this year’s celebration. Aside from the helmet, the full set is available today for all platforms in Advanced Supply Drops and Supply Drops. 

We hope you all enjoy the Legendary Ronin Mask, our token of thanks for all the support you’ve given us along the way. Stay tuned for more special #HammerWeek announcements over our studio social channels on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Google+.

* Start Menu is beatiful, happy to have it back.

* The Free Upgrade thing was really cool of Money$oft to do.

* Cortana is fun, nothing too special though.

* Seems a lot more fluid and smooth compared to 8.1.

* All of my Files and Programs stayed installed.

* I'm sure there's more that I'm missing, that's just a few from the top of my head.

#Cons

* Not really a Con (yet), but do I dare touch this Microsoft Edge bullshit?

* This one is both a Pro and Con, it kept all of my Files/Programs. I kinda wanted a fresh install, I spent 2 hours backing up important stuff prior to Upgrading, now I've got to spend 2 more hours dumping it back onto my computer.

* My shitty Laptop seems to be running a lot *hotter* than usual.

Daily Threads are going to be implemented along with the above mentioned CSS redesign. For now I guess we'll just have to put up with them.",2015-07-26 01:15:27+00:00,ctg8j7n,7.0,t1_ctg7w6l,1305.0,CODZombies

This is Self-Promotion, he's been entirely inactive on Reddit for over a month, he came back and posted a link to his YouTube Video. Whether you see it or not, it's obvious that he wanted the views on his video more than the feedback/advice. If he would've made a Self-Post asking for advice on a Zombies YouTube Channel it would've been alright, but instead he typed a one-liner then plopped a link to his video at the end. He put no time or thought into this post, his main objective was to gain views and attention on his YouTube Channel, aka Self-Promotion.",2015-07-26 01:08:58+00:00,ctg8cey,5.0,t1_ctg7svq,1108.0,CODZombies
6363,"Because this Sub hasn't been properly moderated, I'm not calling out /u/Fedor1 or anything like that, so don't get that idea. There is definitely going to be a set of rules put in place, not only on self advertising posts (such as this one) but others, such as LFG/Party Up and the numerous *Look what Round I got to!* Posts.

Look at every other COD Subreddit, what do you see in the Rules?

&gt; Can I post my own videos?

&gt; Yes, if you are a contributing member who takes part in the community or Reddit as a whole. If you signed up just to get some extra views, you are wasting your time. However you might want to first take a look at the Official Reddit stance on Self-Promotion.

&gt; Some highlights:

&gt; You should not just start submitting your links - it will be unwelcome and may be removed as spam, or your account will be banned as spam.

&gt; You should submit from a variety of sources (a general rule of thumb is 10% or less of your links should be your own site), talk to people in the comments (and not just on your own links), and generally be a good member of the community.

&gt; You should join subreddits that are relevant to your interests. Give feedback to others, talk about issues that interest you, and be a good member of the community. redditors don't care that you have something to promote, they care what you think and that you have interesting things to say.

Oh, and not to mention the **Official Reddit Rules** on Self-Promotion...

&gt; Self-promotion is generally frowned upon, but if you want to have a presence on reddit you should fully read reddiquette and the FAQs so that you understand the culture and social norms. If you run a website, publication, blog, app, or other project and would like to participate on reddit, you'll need to first make sure that you're following all of the guidelines in the FAQ on spam.",2015-07-26 00:41:04+00:00,ctg7j0h,5.0,t1_ctg7c4a,390.0,CODZombies

6531,"Hey Zintoatree, you might have seen me enter on onebadmofo's giveaway, here's why I would be ever so grateful to receive these parts!

First off, I'd like to say thank you so much for the opportunity you've given me, it's really cool seeing how generous people on the PCMR Sub can be. I'm also located in Kansas so you don't have to worry about any international shipping. I'd definitely take pictures with/of the card when it arrives, you don't have to worry about me selling it or anything like that.

Hey OP, I guess this will be my shameless attempt to convince you that I could use the card, so here it goes.. :)
Currently, I am a Console Peasant, I play on the Xbox One. I've 100% came to the realization that PC is the way to go. I understand each and every aspect of why PC is truly the master race.

The only thing holding me back is money. (This is where the feels kick in.) I am working on getting my first job but not too many local businesses are hiring, and I'm a few months away from being able to work at an actual franchise. I live with my single mom who is in and out of the hospital every few weeks due to numerous health concerns. I live with my mother and 2 siblings. Money has almost always been a struggle for my family, and before you say *why don't you just sell your Xbox One for a PC?*, I can't, it was gifted to me by a family member and I just wouldn't feel right giving it away. My family doesn't struggle near as much as some others do, I understand that. But things that aren't necessities are often overlooked (such as a PC).

The only PC game I've kind of gotten into was CS:GO, I played for a few hours at a friends house and loved it. With these parts you'd put me so much closer to the master race, all I'd be missing is a mobo, case, cpu cooler and a keyboard, which I could probably afford soon after receiving the parts. I plan on expanding my taste in games when/if I do get a PC, but for the mean time I'd love to be able to get into CS:GO.

I've always been a console peasant, I started off on the Playstation 2, then I moved to the Xbox 360, I just recently got my Xbox One in January (around my birthday).

If you'd like anymore information, please just ask. I'm not going to beg and I won't mind if you feel someone else in this thread is more deserving of it than I am, but if you'd like to help me ascend to the Master Race, please do. :)

*EDIT: Forgot to mention what I'm currently using. I'm using an old Compaq Presario CQ62, running 2gb of RAM, and an Intel Celeron 900 @2.20ghz, and integrated graphics. I've been told that I should be able to run CS:GO on low settings, but it's just completely unplayable. Not to mention that this thing reaches 90 celsius just browsing reddit and youtube. [Proof that I'm running on a shitty laptop](http://prntscr.com/7s1zg2)*

**I know that this is the same thing I posted on your old giveaway and onebadmofo's giveaway. However, if you would like me to give you any more information as to why I really do need these parts, please just ask. I hate to sound needy but I'm willing to tell you my whole life story for these, lol.**

Somebody could do the Sub design without becoming a Mod, however it would be a real *pain in the ass*. Said person that creates the CSS would have to send you the Stylesheet and Images whenever they make a change, then you'd have to send them Screenshots of how it looks on the Sub.

The person of the banner could send you the Banner and you would have to go into the CSS and change a line or two of code then upload the image to the Stylesheet then apply it.

&gt; if anyone wants to make a new banner/look for the sub, and are able to post a preview, please do so in the comments so the community can vote on them.

I don't see the retreat one as much as I used to. Currently, you have to use Exo Hover to get into it. Previously, you could just *Boost Slam* into it. Maybe it's common and I just don't play retreat enough lol.

As for the Defender one, are you talking about the *High Ledge* where you can kinda float in the air?

6662,"Welcome! I wonder why you still have a Moderate NAT Type though, that's a bit weird.

Like a said in a comment below, your NAT Type doesn't affect your Lag, it affects the game lobbies you get into. With a Moderate NAT Type you're more likely to get into a lobby with a bad host, and way less likely to get a lobby with a Dedi. With an Open NAT Type you're a lot more likely to get a good Host, or even a Dedi; thus causing your game to feel *less laggy*.

You won't have to change the ports or anything when Black Ops 3 releases, just make sure that if you end up resetting your router (or sometimes just unplugging it) that your Static IP is still setup. If your Static IP isn't setup, those ports aren't being forwarded to your console. The only time you'll have to change ports is if you reset your router or switch to Xbox (which uses different ports).

Also, those ports above are for everything PSN + COD, so you should notice improvement in quite a few things.",2015-07-04 18:57:46+00:00,css6795,3.0,t1_css3yse,4519.0,CodAW

Turn on your PS4 and verify that you've correctly set up a Static IP.

**Enable UPnP** on your router. Again, google a guide to find where to do this on your specific router.

After you've got a Static IP for your PS4, you're going to need to **Forward the Ports** below. (Make sure you get the protocol (TCP, UDP, or both) right for each port!)

**Ports:**

* 80 (TCP &amp; UDP)

To be brutally honest, you're going to see **a lot** of ASM1 and Bal-27 usage. Not saying other Weapons aren't viable, but you're going to get outgunned by the two a lot. A few other usable Weapons are the IMR, MORS, ARX-160, HBRa3, KF5 and Tac-19, the rest are pretty much useless.

My main Setup at the Moment is the ASM1 with Advanced Rifling, Foregrip and Quickdraw, Lightweight, Toughness and Blast Suppressor, Overclock.

Scorestreaks you'll mainly want to stick with either the UAV, Assault Drone, Bombing Run or Warbird.
