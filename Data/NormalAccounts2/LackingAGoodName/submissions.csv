##How To Provide Feedback

We want to hear from you, Players and Developers! Players, be sure to state your issue, the reason it's an issue, and how you would fix it in detail. Developers, in response to the players, it is asked that you discuss their suggestions, approve or disapprove of their suggestions, any why, if you feel necessary. Constructive discussion is what we're looking for here, everybody please feel free to chime in.

If you agree with a suggestion, upvote it. This will move it higher up in the thread, thus making it more likely for a Developer to see, as well as letting the Developers know that many people agree with this suggestion. If you disagree with a suggestion, do not Downvote it, instead reply and explain why you disagree.

Any hateful, non-constructive, or low-effort comments will be removed. Examples of such are ""fix lag"", ""give us dlc trailer"", etc.

In regards to this thread.

&gt; Not that many of you haven't been posting your feedback on here or sending it to us on Twitter anyway, but thank you for compiling it all in once place - thanks mods! I can tell you that a lot of the things you're all submitting are things that are on our list/items that we're aware about. Although I can't give you a timeline on these things just yet, this is extremely helpful! And there's also a handful of great suggestions too, so I'll make sure they get passed along as well. I'll be scanning through here regularly, so again, I appreciate the thread and the feedback!

Hey everybody,

As you've noticed, the subreddit looks quite different compared to what is was. I've revamped the place to match the Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare Zombies Theme of 'Zombies In Spaceland'. While I know some die-hard fans want nothing but Treyarch Zombies, may I remind you that this is /r/CODZombies, all forms of Call of Duty Zombies, not only Treyarch Zombies. While I'm not telling you you have to like it, I am asking that you remain respectful to all throughout the year as we play through IW Zombies, who knows, give it a try, you might like it.

&amp;nbsp;

#New Flairs

**Please update your Flair, even if you don't want a new one!** I've changed the backend names for all the flairs, give or take a few, so you're going to need to reapply your flair again, even if you don't want to change it, so that it updates, otherwise your flair will not be shown.

I've added a few IW Zombies Flairs, and more will come once I can get assets from the game (next few days).

&amp;nbsp;

#New Upquotes

Given the little bit of lines that we've been given from the 'Zombies In Spaceland' Reveal and Intro Cutscene, I've compiled all new Upquotes for the subreddit. Not all of these are too great, but they'll be constantly updated with new IW Zombies Quotes as we get more, feel free to suggest some.

&amp;nbsp;

#New Snoo

Out with the old, in with the new. The Snoodowman has been replaced by David Snooselhoff! Shoutout to /u/cookiebreath

&amp;nbsp;

By popular request, we've opened up a separate subreddit for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered! All MWR-specific content on /r/InfiniteWarfare will be redirected here, and vice versa.

Please note that this subreddit is still in its early stages, as detailed below, and there is much much more to come.

#Under Construction

With the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered rapidly approaching us, we've found ourselves stripped of time to fully prepare /r/CODModernWarfare to the best of its ability, most notably, the CSS.

As you've noticed, this is a plain subreddit, there's no CSS whatsoever. We're well aware of this and are 100% going to be rolling out a fully-featured stylesheet as soon as possible! I myself am the CSS Moderator for all of the Call of Duty Subreddits, so right now I'm in the process of a full 'Zombies in Spaceland' Themed Redesign for /r/CODZombies, as well as making changes to /r/InfiniteWarfare's CSS. Because of that, and this last second decision to split MWR and IW content into two subreddits, I haven't been able to fully prepare a stylesheet for this subreddit. But worry not, it will be coming, bare with this ugly look until then.

We look forward to an amazing year with both Infinite Warfare and Modern Warfare Remastered!

Alongside a visual refresh to the subreddit with the New CSS being based on Infinite Warfare's 'Zombies In Spaceland', what are some cool ideas or features you'd like to see on /r/CODZombies?

#Snoo 

If you have an idea for a new subreddit snoo or want to make one yourself, check [Chef's Thread](https://redd.it/586nuo).

#Ideas Wanted

Please keep in mind we are very limited when it comes to Reddit. As much as I'd love to have interchangeable themes for both Treyarch and Infinity Ward Zombies, we're limited to a mere 100kb on our Stylesheet, which we're already pushing the limit on. So sadly interchangeable themes are out of question, however cool ideas and features are welcomed and I'll see what I can do.

Also, things like maybe content rotation threads to discuss or promote certain topics. Whatever you can think of, let me know! If there's something another subreddit does that you like or think is cool, feel free to recommend it.

If you're not sure what I mean, in Black Ops III Stock was heavily nerfed to the point where its effects (faster movement while ADS) only applied while not firing, rendering it useless other than pre-aiming corners. Stock used to be such a good attachment for ARs because it allowed for you to strafe while shooting much easier and more effectively.

As some of you may know, within the past hour, shortly after the sneak peek trailer was released, the Subtitles for the Intro Cutscene to the DLC4 Map were found a Black Ops 3 Memory Dump via PC.

After taking the situation into consideration, we've decided to not allow discussion of this information for the sake of the community. This is the end-all of the Zombies Storyline, and due to this information being obtained in an illegitimate manner,  it wouldn't be fair to the community for it to be spoiled.

If you would like to discuss this information, I'm sure other resources on the internet have already found it. Not here.

Anyone found to be posting this information after this Announcement is made will receive consequences. This applies to our Subreddit Discord Server as well.

Please do not ask others to PM you leaked material. The more people that have it, the more it spreads, the more people get spoiled.

We're doing the right thing, the right thing for everyone...",CODZombies,"[MOD POST] Regarding the ""Leaked"" Intro/Outro Cutscene Subtitles (No Spoilers)",https://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/4zfjoe/mod_post_regarding_the_leaked_introoutro_cutscene/

If I do a Dark Theme the yellow is way to bright and pops too much, if I do a Light Theme the yellow is still too bright and is a huge strain on your eyes.

I'm not opposed to using a different shade of yellow, as long as it isn't too much different from the original, but I'd prefer to remain with the original yellow. I'm not opposed to doing a Light Theme either, but dark would be preferred.

Using my baby /r/Naut, if you think that matters.

&gt; The Infinite Warfare zombies mode is an absolute blast. I was able to test it out and I think this game will surprise many fans of the genre. The IW zombies team has spent the last two years analyzing the pros and the cons of the last two zombies installments (Advanced Warfare and Black Ops 3). The zombies mode comes with two maps on disc and will feature a full length map for the hardcore players and a smaller map similar to ""The Giant"" for the more casual fans.
&gt; 
&gt; The larger map takes place in the 1980s Soviet Union the map was snowy but I didn't get to test the map. The smaller map that I tested is basically a remastered version of Kino Der Toten from Black Ops. It is basically a clear cut copy of Kino except a 1980s version and has a few more playable areas. Perks basically work the same. Except they are called ""boosts"". Instead of drinking them the player purchases them and then puts their hand on the machine and transfers the power from it. The actual gameplay is very similar to Treyarch zombies as there is rounds of zombies and they move basically the exact way. Weapon variety is amazing as it features Weapons from the 1950s, all the way up to laser rifles of the 22nd century.
&gt; 
&gt; In "" The Theatre of Death"" There are four ""Wonder Weapons"". Each can be upgraded four different ways very similar to the staffs and bows of Der Eisendrache and Origins. The four elemental upgrades are as follows: Dark Magic, Light, Fire, and water. The Wonder weapons can be acquired by finding parts for the four different film reels around the map. You can catapult up to the top of the theatre and that is where you can put the reels into play the movie. The screen will then show a film and a character using the wonder weapon to ward off zombies. Then the weapon will disappear from the character's hands and the screen will show the character being overrun by zombies. The WW will then appear in the room. This can be done four times to get the four different wonder weapons.
&gt; 
&gt; The weapons are: King Arthur's Sword, A Plasma Mini-Gun with 3 seperate spinning barrels and a flamethrower attachment, a fully automatic Crossbow (Think Van helsing's Crossbow combined with Chewbacca's), and a Robotic arm. This zombies crew could rival the main crew from Black Ops 3 zombies. The developers wanted to make characters that were recognizable to fans to make the zombies mode more popular and they couldn't have picked a better four. Price, Mactavish, Ghost, and Makarov are the four playable characters from ""TOD"" and although have some silly moments are more serious then the characters from Treyarch's take. Makarov seems to be the Richtofen of the group and as he is very suspicious and may have his own agenda.
&gt; 
&gt; The story is basically that the four characters will have to go through multiple movie universes and fix them. The universes of some movies have bled into the real universe and is causing quite a few problems. There is a way to upgrade the weapons similar to exo zombies and BO3 zombies. There is a window with a slit in it. paying 3,000 points and you will see hands come out through the slit and take your weapon, you will hear a bunch of ""construction"" noises and then he will give you back your new upgraded weapon and the man will say ""Pleasure doing business with you"". Every weapon can be upgraded 3 times. One of my favorite new features in this game mode are challenge rounds. Every 3-5 rounds a challenge will appear on screen and completing the challenge will earn the player a skill point. Skill points can be used upgrade perks ( Boosts). ""Boosts"" have 3 tiers and once unlocking the final tier the player will permanently have the perk, even if they go down or bleed out. I will just say that this map I tested for about 50-55 hours and I was having fun the whole time. The weapon variety is great. The Easter Eggs are fun, and the new story is interesting.

&gt; The good news is, you're nearly done. It will soon be time to come to the house.

&gt; 
&gt; Hello.
&gt; 
&gt; So nice to see you all.

 &amp;nbsp;

##Round 14 - All Characters

&gt; I have been watching. I have seen each and every one of your misdeeds. I know who you are. Sounds ominous, doesn't it? GOOD! Because it fucking is!

&amp;nbsp;

##Round 15 - All Characters

&gt; The entirety of the universe is fractured and broken. Something that you clowns hold more than at least some degree of responsibility for. Guess what? You're gonna fix it! Look, just do what you usually do. Listen out for radios and things, and I'll help wherever I can.

&amp;nbsp;

##Wisp 1 - Tank Factory

* [Video](https://youtu.be/_Z_lns1Rjvc?t=7s)

&gt; Hello...? Testing, testing, te- do you hear me? Testiiiing, tes-- actually, I don't know why I'm doing all this. I'm almost one hundred percent certain that you CAN hear me.
&gt; 
&gt; So let's not fanny about.
&gt; 
&gt; OK. Where best to start ... the universe is big. Really big. So try to imagine the biggest thing that you can. And then imagine that you're waaaay off. It's a million, billion, trillion, eeahhh .. zillion? Times bigger than that.
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, don't worry about the size - it's fucking huge. Let's just leave it at that.
&gt; 
&gt; More important than it's humongous proportions is the fact that the universe is a living, breathing thing ... ever changing, ever shifting. Existing across and beyond time .. and space, itself. With me so far?

&amp;nbsp;

##Wisp 2 - Belinski Square

* [Video](https://youtu.be/_Z_lns1Rjvc?t=1m12s)

&gt; Alright! So you've got this universe; this big, change-y already volatile universe... and then you shatter it with a hammer. A metaphorical hammer - and it cracks and splinters into a million other universes. All coexisting, at exactly the same time.
&gt; 
&gt; (sigh) Do you have ANY idea how difficult that is to keep track of? I may be omnipotent, but I can't be everywhere.

&amp;nbsp;

##Wisp 3 - Supply Depot

* [Video](https://youtu.be/_Z_lns1Rjvc?t=1m52s)

&gt; Now, if it had been ENTIRELY up to me you numbskulls would be the last people I would entrust with this - but, due to factors outside of my control ..
&gt; 
&gt; (presumably deep sigh, a dragon breathes fire around here so I can’t tell exactly)
&gt; 
&gt; I know there's a lot going on, I know it's a lot to take IN - but the universe is deeply unstable. Things are going to get a lot worse before they get better.
&gt; 
&gt; Crazy as things are, I will try my absolute best to give you all some one-on-one time... some good old fashioned TLC! Do this right, and everything will be okay.
&gt; 
&gt; Pinky promise!

&amp;nbsp;

##Wisp 4 - Hatchery

* [Video](https://youtu.be/_Z_lns1Rjvc?t=2m45s)

&gt; Maxis. He was the first. The vessel you constructed for him back in World War 1 somehow shielded him from the influence of element 115.
&gt; 
&gt; He opened the portal between the worlds, and, well - that's where and when shit really went tits up! The world within the world got turned upside down and inside out - if you can imagine such a thing. 
&gt; 
&gt; So, anyway. It was around then that I was forced to .. step in.

&amp;nbsp;

##Wisp 5 - Department Store

* [Video](https://youtu.be/_Z_lns1Rjvc?t=3m28s)

&gt; Samantha! Oooooh boy. Have you ever heard the phrase - 'hell hath no fury like a woman scorned'?
&gt; 
&gt; Well. That fury is even worse with a little girl. Especially one as confused as that poor child is .. she really didn't get much of a chance, did she? Right out of the gate she was thrown into this madness before she could ever figure out exactly who she was.
&gt; 
&gt; Still, that's all ancient history now. She's safe.
&gt; 
&gt; In the house.

&amp;nbsp;

##Wisp 6 - Bridge

* [Video](https://youtu.be/_Z_lns1Rjvc?t=4m13s)

&gt; Here's a quick cheat sheet. You all fought in World War 1, Whoopee! You are badass heroes! That was true, that happened.
&gt; 
&gt; Later, some other versions of you ended up as lab rats in some crazy World War 2 experiments, experiments that left you kind of, not that smart. Your memories were mostly erased and you just kind of stumbled and bumbled around in time and space, oblivious to your past.. and future actions.

&amp;nbsp;

##Wisp 7 - Department Store

* [Video](https://youtu.be/_Z_lns1Rjvc?t=5m1s)

&gt; You know how people say that every snowflake is unique? That single every one is an individual, one of a kind irrefutable evidence of the miracles of mother nature?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, it's not true. Snowflakes aren't all that unique. There are really only about 12 different designs.
&gt; 
&gt; The point I'm making is that you lot are hardly one-of-a-kind snowflakes. You were fragmented across a multitude of different realities, but each and every one is basically the same. You are all you.
&gt; 
&gt; The liar, the braggart, the drunk -- the one who didn't know what he had, until it was gone.
&gt; 
&gt; The good soldier: Never disobeyed orders; never broke protocol... still kicked ass all the same.
&gt; 
&gt; The loyal servant: A warrior out of time, born to late -- or born too early. Unabound to dying traditions.
&gt; 
&gt; The man-child: Broken and twisted by a life burdened with knowledge. Living like a soul who is perpetually drowning.

&amp;nbsp;

##Wisp 8 - Dragon Control

* [Video](https://youtu.be/_Z_lns1Rjvc?t=6m29s)

&gt; You need to stop thinking in terms of originals - old and new, it-it's not like that. When you look in the mirror, it's still you. If you crack that mirror you see multiple reflections. It doesn't mean you actually multiplied, does it?
&gt; 
&gt; Honestly, I'm not sure why I'm trying to explain it.
&gt; 
&gt; Shit's fucked up. Please, fix it.

&amp;nbsp;

##Wisp 9 - Hatchery

* [Video](https://youtu.be/_Z_lns1Rjvc?t=7m8s)

&gt; You see, the thing is ... I'm meant to stay on the sidelines - not really supposed to get involved. Free will and all that stuff - oh and, ah, that was my idea by the way. 
&gt; 
&gt; However! I do see stuff now and then that makes me go oooooho- that's not good! I really should do something! But the thing is ..! Tsk, all I can really do is give things a little nudge. Sew a seed, plant an idea .. see what grows!
&gt; 
&gt; See what sticks.

&amp;nbsp;

##Wisp 10 - Tank Factory

* [Video](https://youtu.be/_Z_lns1Rjvc?t=7m50s)

&gt; Where do you think all these magic weapon boxes come from?
&gt; 
&gt; The chalk drawings on the wall - the magic ammo drops? The gumball machines ...?
&gt; 
&gt; Do I need to go on, or do you get the message? I just hope you appreciate it.

&amp;nbsp;

##Monty to Tank Dempsey - After Wisp 3

&gt; Alright Tank, I'm going to need you to trust me - ok? You've done really, really well so far but I honestly think it's going to be easier if I just talk you through some things.
&gt; 
&gt; Now let's be honest, you don't really know who you are do you? You've been bouncing along time and space for years, yelling all sorts of obscenities - by the way your language is fucking disgraceful sometimes, you should wash your mouth out with soap!
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway! We'll talk again soon and I'll explain everything. Just give me a little time to double check on my ... flow charts.

&amp;nbsp;

##Monty to Tank Dempsey 2 - After Wisp 3

&gt; Right! Uhhh, where were we Tank .. actually, more to the point - where ARE you? Are you up to speed, do you know exactly what you're doing - or is the 115 delusion so bad you're still calling in field reports? Even though no one is listening!
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry, aha - that's unfair.
&gt; 
&gt; I was listening - I heard every word you said. You're a good soldier. You always were!

&amp;nbsp;

##Monty to Tank Dempsey 3 - After Wisp 3

&gt; So! Richtofen .. I'm kind of surprised you've gone along with him this far! Didn't you despise him at one point?
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway .. keep a close eye on him - I think he's up to something

&amp;nbsp;

##Monty to Takeo Masaki - After Wisp 3

&gt; Takeo Masaki, wow, those wounds are fresh, aren't they? The bitter sting of betrayal. The absolute collapse of the singular belief that has been the driving force in your life as long as you can remember.
&gt; 
&gt; What now Takeo? What do you do when the metaphorical rug has been pulled out from under your feet?

&amp;nbsp;

##Monty to Takeo Masaki 2 - After Wisp 3

&gt; I'll tell you what you will do Takeo. You will do what you’ve always done. You fight. The only difference is you do it for yourself, not for some misplaced sense of duty or honor.

&amp;nbsp;

##Monty to Takeo Masaki 3 - After Wisp 3

&gt; So, besides the changes in your own outlook, have you noticed a change in Richthofen? Dempsey? Well I’m not trying to stir things up but, does it seem to you like the two of them may be scheming between themselves?

&amp;nbsp;

##Monty to Nikolai Belinski - After Wisp 3

&gt; Nikolai Belinski, this can’t be easy for you, knowing what happened in Stalingrad.
&gt; 
&gt; You’ll be hard pushed to find any historian who wouldn't list this in the top 10 all-time most horrible events in human history, even without the dragons.

&amp;nbsp;

##Monty to Nikolai Belinski 2 - After Wisp 3

&gt; You may not have lived it Nikolai, but you never forgot, no matter how hard you tried.
&gt; 
&gt; You just didn’t talk about it. I don’t get that about you people sometimes. Your whole sense of reality is built only upon the things that are talked about. If it isn’t said, didn’t happen.

&amp;nbsp;

##Monty to Nikolai Belinski 3 - After Wisp 3

&gt; There are certain things that you can't ever change, Nikolai. All I ask, is that you do the right thing. The right thing .. for everyone.

&amp;nbsp;

##Monty to Edward Richtofen - After Wisp 3

&gt; I have to admit something to you, Edward. Something I've never ever ever had to admit to anyone ever before. It’s really quite a bad thing …You ready? Well, here it is. I don't understand you, matey. I don't understand a single thing about what makes you tick! You are the closest thing to an absolute distillation to obtuse obstructionism of unparalleled maniacal chaos in human form as it is possible to imagine.

&amp;nbsp;

##Monty to Edward Richtofen 2 - After Wisp 3

&gt; Look - I know you've had a lot to deal with. I know how hard you've been trying, but I really can't be sure EXACTLY why you're doing it!
&gt; 
&gt; I mean, it's not as if you owe Maxis anything ..
&gt; 
&gt; Is it?

&amp;nbsp;

##Monty to Edward Richtofen 3 - After Wisp 3

&gt; I don't know - maybe some of the paranoia is starting to rub off on me!
&gt; 
&gt; But let me tell you this, my little german friend .. I've got my eye on you!

##What is Discord?

&gt; Discord is an all-in-one voice and text chat for gamers that’s free, secure, and works on both your desktop and phone.

&gt; Discord was born out of our own frustrations with the voice and chat tools we all use while playing games. It’s a bit strange that in 2016 most of us are using chat apps that haven’t been updated in years to play games that are updated every week. We deserve better.

&gt; Discord brings gaming communication out of the stone age. It's free, easy to use, and with you even while you are AFK. 

&gt; You can check out an extensive list of advanced features on the [Discord landing page](http://www.discord.gg/).

##What's the point of this Discord Server?

We hope to build an active community in this Discord Server to have a 24/7 Live Chat with like-minded Redditors. If you're interested, please try and keep this chat alive by participating and keeping discussion related to Call of Duty.

##Will this Chat be Moderated?

This Server will be Moderated just as the Subreddit is. Users can and will be Kicked, or even banned. Please report any abusive users to the Moderators via Mod Mail here on /r/BlackOps3 or PMs to the Moderators on Discord.

##How do I use Discord?

Sign up for a Free Account with Discord, you must have a Verified Email Address to use our Server, this is to prevent spam and trolls.

Discord has a [Web Client](https://discordapp.com/) that you can use in your browser, which doesn't require any downloads.

You can also Download the Discord App on pretty much any device, Links below.

* [Discord for Mac OSX](https://discordapp.com/api/download?platform=osx)

I joined with the intentions of redoing the subreddit's ugly-old CSS, I did not plan on becoming a *Moderator*. Funny part about it is, I barely even knew CSS at the time, I was just learning, /r/CODZombies was my first CSS gig.

Seeing /r/CODZombies grow has been insane, meeting new people, making long-term friends, learning new skills, and overall sharing my love for the Zombies gamemode.

At the time of me joining the Mod Team, there were about 8,000 Subscribers and averaged less than 500,000 Page Views per month. Now, we're at 33,000 Subscribers and averaging 3,500,000 Page Views per month, with our peak month being March 2016 where we hit 5,000,000 Page Views in 1 month.

I'd like to thank /u/Fedor1, he's the creator of the /r/CODZombies Subreddit and allowed for me to become a Moderator and eventually take over as head moderator here. Also, thank you to /u/ChefSlapChop who joined shortly after me and was there along the whole way, along with /u/Mastadge and /u/ThRebrth who were former mods prior to me becoming a Mod.

##Thank You

Some of you see this as just a videogame subreddit, I see it as a family. I've grown to know so many people here, some of which could potentially be life-long friends. I've learned a lot not only about the game itself but about people and how to handle different situations, I've pushed myself to learn new Programming Languages that I can use not only in the future as a career but to better this subreddit in the form of bots, css, etc.

Thank you all, here's to many more &lt;3

&gt; Discord is an all-in-one voice and text chat for gamers that’s free, secure, and works on both your desktop and phone.

&gt; Discord was born out of our own frustrations with the voice and chat tools we all use while playing games. It’s a bit strange that in 2016 most of us are using chat apps that haven’t been updated in years to play games that are updated every week. We deserve better.

&gt; Discord brings gaming communication out of the stone age. It's free, easy to use, and with you even while you are AFK. 

&gt; You can check out an extensive list of advanced features on the [Discord landing page](http://www.discord.gg/).

##What's the point of this Discord Server?

We hope to build an active community in this Discord Server to have a 24/7 Live Chat with like-minded Redditors. If you're interested, please try and keep this chat alive by participating and keeping discussion going.

##Will this Chat be Moderated?

This Server will be Moderated just as the Subreddit is. Users can and will be Kicked, or even banned. Please report any abusive users to the Moderators via Mod Mail here on /r/TheLastofUs or PMs to the Admins/Mods on Discord.

##How do I use Discord?

Sign up for a Free Account with Discord, you must have a Verified Email Address to use our Server, this is to prevent spam and trolls.

Discord has a [Web Client](https://discordapp.com/) that you can use in your browser, which doesn't require any downloads.

We've just recently hit **1,000 Total Members** active within the last week! Thank you guys for that. We've had an all-time total of 2,426 Members.

Our Discord Server has been recently redone, with a new Off-Topic Room for discussion irrelevant to CODZombies, as well as a new Music Bot (who is here to stay this time) coming within the next couple days, hopefully.

If you have any other questions or feedback regarding the CODZombies Discord, please do let us know.

##What is Discord?

&gt; Discord is an all-in-one voice and text chat for gamers that’s free, secure, and works on both your desktop and phone.

&gt; Discord was born out of our own frustrations with the voice and chat tools we all use while playing games. It’s a bit strange that in 2016 most of us are using chat apps that haven’t been updated in years to play games that are updated every week. We deserve better.

&gt; Discord brings gaming communication out of the stone age. It's free, easy to use, and with you even while you are AFK. 

&gt; You can check out an extensive list of advanced features on the [Discord landing page](http://www.discord.gg/).

##What's the point of this Discord Server?

We hope to build an active community in this Discord Server to have a 24/7 Live Chat with like-minded Redditors. If you're interested, please try and keep this chat alive by participating and keeping discussion related to Call of Duty Zombies.

##Will this Chat be Moderated?

This Server will be Moderated just as the Subreddit is. Users can and will be Kicked, or even banned. Please report any abusive users to the Moderators via Mod Mail here on /r/CODZombies or PMs to the Moderators on Discord.

##How do I use Discord?

Sign up for a Free Account with Discord, you must have a Verified Email Address to use our Server, this is to prevent spam and trolls.

Discord has a [Web Client](https://discordapp.com/) that you can use in your browser, which doesn't require any downloads.

You can also Download the Discord App on pretty much any device, Links below.

* [Discord for Mac OSX](https://discordapp.com/api/download?platform=osx)
* [Discord for Windows](https://discordapp.com/api/download?platform=win)
* [Discord for Apple iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/discord-chat-for-games/id985746746)
* [Discord for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.discord)

##Sounds Great, where do I join?

You can Join the /r/CODZombies Server using either of the methods below:

* [Direct Link to Server](https://discord.gg/0lRKp64BMx7oJDLO)
* Server Code: 0lRKp64BMx7oJDLO

The Emblem for the Groups are all different at the moment, on PS4 it's just the default Alien Emblem because I don't mainly play PS so I didn't have any emblems. On Xbox One it's the Juggernog Logo, and on PC it's an Emblem that says 115.

With Infinite Warfare and Modern Warfare Remastered approaching us faster and faster each day, we'd like to discuss a few things regarding this subreddit. First of which being the New Rules for this Subreddit and the other COD Subreddits (/r/CallofDuty, /r/BlackOps3, and /r/CODZombies).

##New Rules

As you may have noticed, the rules in the Sidebar and on the Index Wiki Page have been updated. These Rules will be applied across majority of the COD Subreddits. Please do give constructive feedback on these, let us know if you find any of them confusing or unfair.

1. **All Submissions should be relevant to Infinite Warfare or Modern Warfare Remastered.**
 * All Submissions must be directly related to Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare or Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered. If your submission wouldn't be related without the title, it will be removed.
2. **No Derogatory Language, Harassment, Bullying, Witch Hunting, etc.**
 * Age, Nationality, Race, Gender, Sexuality, Religion and Economic Status are all irrelevant here, everyone is welcome. Discriminating or insulting someone based off the above will not be tolerated. This includes Brigading, Witch-Hunting, Vote Manipulation, Flamebaiting, Clickbaiting, Text Spamming and Intentional Rudeness.
3. **No Low-Effort / Low-Quality Submissions.**
 * Low-Effort content, Fad-Chasing, Reaction Images/Gifs (unless very High-Effort/Especially Original) and attempts to Concern Troll. This rule is enforced by the Moderators' discretion.
4. **No Repetitive Topics / Reposts.**
 * Use the search bar prior to posting, your submission will be removed if it has already been posted or discussed before. Moderators will create a Megathread if necessary, remember to check the sticky posts to see if your topic is a current Megathread.
5. **No Self-Promotion of any kind.**
 * Do not attempt to advertise your Social Media, this includes YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, etc. Also, do not use this subreddit to promote your Website or Product. YouTube Videos will be removed if they add nothing of value to the Subreddit (Ex: Commentaries). If you'd like to post a gameplay clip, use [Gfycat.com](http://www.Gfycat.com).
6. **No Party Up, LFG, or Clan/Team Recruitment Posts.**
 * Do not submit a post on this subreddit looking for people to play with, use /r/COD_LFG and the stickied Party-Up Thread if available.
7. **No Advertising, Selling, Buying, or Trading.**
 * There will be no Advertising of Products or Services on this subreddit. Do not attempt to sell, buy, or trade anything, this includes Referral and Affiliate links.
8. **Have fun, be nice.**
 * We're all like-minded players, remember that the person you're talking to is a human just as you are, please treat everyone with respect and they will do the same to you. If you feel another user is violating any of these listed rules, please [Contact the Moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FInfinitewarfare).
9. **Please Adhere to [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).**
 * Remember the human. When you communicate online, all you see is a computer screen. When talking to someone you might want to ask yourself ""Would I say it to the person's face?"" or ""Would I get jumped if I said this to a buddy?"" Adhere to the same standards of behavior online that you follow in real life.
10. **Moderators reserve the right to remove any content or user based off of their own discretion.**
 * Moderators will remove any post deemed to be detrimental to the subreddit.

##New CSS

Currently this Subreddit is very bland and uses a Call of Duty: Ghosts image for the Header. A New CSS overhaul is in the works right now, I've still got quite a bit of work to do on it, but expect it within the coming months. The New CSS will be based off of a project that I help out in, /r/Naut 4.

If you have any suggestions or feature ideas, please do let me know.

##Separate Subreddits?

We'd like to know, would you rather:

* Have both Infinite Warfare AND Modern Warfare Remastered Content on /r/Infinite Warfare

or 

* Have Infinite Warfare Content on /r/InfiniteWarfare, Modern Warfare Remastered Content on /r/COD4

The outcome of the poll will not necessarily mean that's the decision we're going to make, but we will take into consideration any constructive feedback you guys may have. This poll is more for us to make a decision and plan based off of what you guys want.

Please do keep in mind that we're trying to get in contact with Developers at both Infinity Ward and Raven, at the moment we have a couple Devs from IW who will be active in this Subreddit, still no word if there will be Raven Devs for /r/COD4 if we do end up moving MW:R Content to that Subreddit.

Notice: There are a few other MW:R Subreddits out there, none of which are Moderated or Managed by the Mods here, we cannot guarantee the quality of those Subreddits.

With the recent rumors of a COD2016 Reveal as well as a few potential leaks here and there, it's time to address this subject.

##Will Call of Duty based Subreddits be merging into /r/CallofDuty?

Not exactly.

The biggest complaint about the merge was that old game content would be drown out by new game content, despite the ability to sort by flairs. Fair enough. So, while keeping the original idea of the merge in place, which was to essentially resuscitate the old COD Subs, the current COD Game will have its own dedicated sub while the old subs will be merged into /r/CallofDuty. The merging of the old sub will happen shortly after the release of the new game with warnings prior to it happening. So for example, say Infinite Warfare releases on Nov. 9th 2016, /r/BlackOps3 will remain its own subreddit for a little while after, then submissions will be locked off, and people will then use /r/CallofDuty for Black Ops 3 content. Then we'll begin to use /r/InfiniteWarfare or whatever the new sub is for the new game.

As always, we are open to suggestions, but if you are going to suggest something please back it up and put thought into it from all perspectives. Non-constructive feedback will be ignored.

For those of you who are upset that there's a huge image blocking your view on the old subreddits and you can't go back to view old posts, this will be redone, all of the old subreddits will still have their submissions locked, however you will still be able to visit them and reminisce.

In the meantime, until we get an official name for the next Call of Duty Game, please keep all information regarding COD2016 on /r/CallofDuty and in the stickied post on /r/BlackOps3 until the new subreddit is made, with the exception of breaking news such as a reveal trailer, which will then be the discussion thread for /r/BlackOps3.

Thank you,

-Mods

We've got something for all of you that we think you'll find very useful and fun, an [Official /r/CODZombies Discord Server](https://discord.gg/0lRKp64BMx7oJDLO)!

##What is Discord?

&gt; Discord is an all-in-one voice and text chat for gamers that’s free, secure, and works on both your desktop and phone.

&gt; Discord was born out of our own frustrations with the voice and chat tools we all use while playing games. It’s a bit strange that in 2016 most of us are using chat apps that haven’t been updated in years to play games that are updated every week. We deserve better.

&gt; Discord brings gaming communication out of the stone age. It's free, easy to use, and with you even while you are AFK. 

&gt; You can check out an extensive list of advanced features on the [Discord landing page](http://www.discord.gg/).

##What's the point of this Discord Server?

We hope to build an active community in this Discord Server to have a 24/7 Live Chat with like-minded Redditors. If you're interested, please try and keep this chat alive by participating and keeping discussion related to Call of Duty Zombies.

##Will this Chat be Moderated?

This Server will be Moderated just as the Subreddit is. Users can and will be Kicked, or even banned. Please report any abusive users to the Moderators via Mod Mail here on /r/CODZombies or PMs to the Moderators on Discord.

##How do I use Discord?

Sign up for a Free Account with Discord, you must have a Verified Email Address to use our Server, this is to prevent spam and trolls.

Discord has a [Web Client](https://discordapp.com/) that you can use in your browser, which doesn't require any downloads.

You can also Download the Discord App on pretty much any device, Links below.

* [Discord for Mac OSX](https://discordapp.com/api/download?platform=osx)
* [Discord for Windows](https://discordapp.com/api/download?platform=win)
* [Discord for Apple iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/discord-chat-for-games/id985746746)
* [Discord for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.discord)

##Sounds Great, where do I join?

You can Join the /r/CODZombies Server using either of the methods below:

* [Direct Link to Server](https://discord.gg/0lRKp64BMx7oJDLO)
* Server Code: 0lRKp64BMx7oJDLO

Add me, would love to meet y'all. At the moment I only have Black Ops 3, will be buying other stuff like Rocket League once I get the money. Going to sell my Xbox One and put the money towards 1.) a [CronusMax Plus](http://cronusmax.com/cronusmax-plus/) and 2.) A *real* Headset, I'm currently playing with audio from a Speaker because the speakers on my Monitor are ass.

I'm really bummed out that I lost my Prestige Master, Dark Matter, and Hero Gear when switching for X1 to PS4, I don't really have any motivation to play MP anymore lol. I'm a huge Zombies Fan so that's the main reason I switched, couldn't wait for the DLC Maps anymore, Zombies is probably all I'll be playing other than the occasional MP game. 

Props to those of you who can actually use the PS4 Controller, I hate it, it just doesn't feel right. Gonna be getting that CronusMax+ so that I can use my Elite Controller on PS4.

Hey all, as you've probably noticed by now the subreddit has changed a little bit. We've upgraded from /r/Naut 3.2 to /r/Naut 4.0 along with many customizations.

The new look is for the most part complete, but will be getting minor fixes and additions over the next few days. I'm aware that there are some bugs but please bear with me as I try and get them fixed. I hope to bring more features to the sub here soon, but unfortunately we're at 98.1% of our stylesheet limit at the moment.

Please let me know any bugs and/or feedback you have, I'd be glad to hear it! :)

Hey everyone,

We've got something new for all of you that we think you'll find very useful and fun, an [Official /r/BlackOps3 Discord Server](https://discord.gg/0n0xyqImZeLeWpwM)!

##What is Discord?

&gt; Discord is a free voice and text chat app designed specifically for gaming. 

&gt; Discord was born out of our own frustrations with the voice and chat tools we all use while playing games. It’s a bit strange that in 2015 most of us are using chat apps that haven’t been updated in years to play games that are updated every week. We deserve better.

&gt; Discord brings gaming communication out of the stone age. It's free, easy to use, and with you even while you are AFK. 

&gt; You can check out an extensive list of advanced features on the [Discord landing page](http://www.discord.gg/).

##What's the point of this Discord Server?

We hope to build an active community in this Discord Server to have a 24/7 Live Chat with like-minded Redditors. If you're interested, please try and keep this chat alive by participating and keeping discussion related to Call of Duty: Black Ops III.

Eventually, this Server might also be used as a better way to Party Up and find players for Black Ops III.

##Will this Chat be Moderated?

This Server will be Moderated just as the Subreddit is. Users can and will be Kicked, or even banned. Please report any abusive users to the Moderators via Mod Mail here on /r/BlackOps3.

##How do I use Discord?

Sign up for a Free Account with Discord, you must have a Verified Email Address to use our Server, this is to prevent spam and trolls.

Discord has a [Web Client](https://discordapp.com/) that you can use in your browser, which doesn't require any downloads.

You can also Download the Discord App on pretty much any device, Links below.

* [Discord for Mac OSX](https://discordapp.com/api/download?platform=osx)
* [Discord for Windows](https://discordapp.com/api/download?platform=win)
* [Discord for Apple iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/discord-chat-for-games/id985746746)
* [Discord for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.discord)

##Sounds Great, where do I sign up?

You can Join the /r/BlackOps3 Server using either of the methods below:

* [Direct Link to Server](https://discord.gg/0n0xyqImZeLeWpwM)
* Server Code: 0n0xyqImZeLeWpwM

#DLC 2: Eclipse Information

Activision and Treyarch have officially announced the second downloadable content pack for Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, Eclipse. The new DLC pack brings four new multiplayer maps and an all new Zombies experience and is available starting April 19th on PlayStation 4.

&gt; “The incredible amount of engagement and response to Black Ops III from our fans continues to inspire all of us at the studio,” said Mark Lamia, Studio Head, Treyarch. “Eclipse continues to demonstrate our commitment to delivering the most exciting gameplay experiences possible with each DLC pack. We are pushing ourselves at every turn to craft new and unique ways to play.”

####Mutliplayer

* **Spire:** Spire takes Multiplayer combat to a futuristic sub-orbital airport terminal set high in the clouds. Multiple levels and open areas promote intense, mid-range combat around a clean, high-tech civilian environment. Watch your step, because one wrong move could send you plummeting back through the stratosphere.

* **Rift:** Head to the core of a harsh futuristic military complex, set high above an active caldera. Rift funnels and forces tight, intense engagements, where the only way through is forward. Utilize the unique core movement opportunities to outsmart and outplay enemies as you traverse the suspended rail system.

* **Knockout:** Housed in a traditional Shaolin Temple with a retro twist, Knockout sets the stage for a bloody Kung Fu tournament. This mid-sized map showcases a sharp contrast between the mid-range engagements of the traditional exterior architecture and the tight close-quarters of an eclectic 1970’s styled interior.

* **Verge:** In this re-imagination of the classic Call of Duty: World at War map, Banzai, Verge drops Multiplayer combat into the center of a distant post-apocalyptic future, where two warring factions are entrenched in constant battle. Take control of the key bridge, fortresses, tunnel systems and waterfalls as you engage in high-speed action through this medium-sized map.

####Zombies

* **Zetsubou No Shima (Island of Despair):** Eclipse also sets the stage for Zetsubou No Shima, the highly-anticipated, all-new entry in the Call of Duty: Black Ops III Zombies storyline that spans the four DLC Map Packs for Black Ops III this year. The Origins characters continue on their mission to stop the zombie apocalypse not only in this universe but in all universes. Our heroes find themselves stranded on a remote Pacific island which is home to the Division 9 facility: a secret biological research lab whose experiments with Element 115 and its effects on human, animal, and plant biology has created horrors beyond belief. Zetsubou No Shima features a foliage rich island map including new terrifying zombie enemies, a variety of innovative transport mechanics, more devastating traps and classic Zombies side quests.

Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 Eclipse DLC will be available April 19 on PS4 and is coming soon to Xbox One and PC. Eclipse DLC is available separately for $14.99 or is included with the [Black Ops 3 Season Pass](http://www.amazon.com/Call-Duty-Season-PlayStation-Download/dp/B00WRK0JWK/ref=sr_1_1?tag=ci0f9-20&amp;s=videogames&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455537662&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=black+ops+3+season+pass). Eclipse DLC and the [Season Pass](http://www.amazon.com/Call-Duty-Season-PlayStation-Download/dp/B00WRK0JWK/ref=sr_1_1?tag=ci0f9-20&amp;s=videogames&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455537662&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=black+ops+3+season+pass) are not available on PS3 or Xbox 360.

&gt; “The incredible amount of engagement and response to Black Ops III from our fans continues to inspire all of us at the studio,” said Mark Lamia, Studio Head, Treyarch. “Eclipse continues to demonstrate our commitment to delivering the most exciting gameplay experiences possible with each DLC pack. We are pushing ourselves at every turn to craft new and unique ways to play.”

* **Zetsubou No Shima (Island of Despair):** Eclipse also sets the stage for Zetsubou No Shima, the highly-anticipated, all-new entry in the Call of Duty: Black Ops III Zombies storyline that spans the four DLC Map Packs for Black Ops III this year. The Origins characters continue on their mission to stop the zombie apocalypse not only in this universe but in all universes. Our heroes find themselves stranded on a remote Pacific island which is home to the Division 9 facility: a secret biological research lab whose experiments with Element 115 and its effects on human, animal, and plant biology has created horrors beyond belief. Zetsubou No Shima features a foliage rich island map including new terrifying zombie enemies, a variety of innovative transport mechanics, more devastating traps and classic Zombies side quests.

Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 Eclipse DLC will be available April 19 on PS4 and is coming soon to Xbox One and PC. Eclipse DLC is available separately for $14.99 or is included with the [Black Ops 3 Season Pass](http://www.amazon.com/Call-Duty-Season-PlayStation-Download/dp/B00WRK0JWK/ref=sr_1_1?tag=ci0f9-20&amp;s=videogames&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455537662&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=black+ops+3+season+pass).

This is your warning, there is going to be discussion of the DLC 2 Zombies Map below.

**New official Call of Duty promotional site accidentally reveals first look at DLC 2’s Zombies map**

**UPDATE:** Activision has now updated the promotional site and removed the Zombies DLC2 image. We will update as get more information.

**Original story:**

Earlier today, Activision sent [out emails to people promoting the Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 Season Pass](http://view.em.callofduty.com/?qs=81e071aba96560e159435e94c7507f6a2ccee1be51def32a90d974ff3be3bba83b88cdea1aad0cd09af3a3e4272e3134fd841b7cf7d39bf4fd40678a1f4b4301). The email was about players who own Awakening DLC1 already to buy the [Season Pass](http://geni.us/MTn) now and get it at a discounted price. In that email, there was a [link to learn more about the promotion](https://www.callofduty.com/blackops3/complete-your-season-pass/), and that site has revealed a first look at what appears to be DLC2’s Zombies map.

On the promo [site](https://www.callofduty.com/blackops3/complete-your-season-pass/), there’s a section called “GET BONUS THEMES” which highlights some themes already released. It also says that [Season Pass](http://geni.us/MTn) owners on PS4 will get access to the DLC2 Zombies theme upon release.

[Screenshot showing the *GET BOUNUS THEMES* section](http://charlieintel.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-19-at-12.51.43-PM-640x306.png)

Next to the info, is this image:

[Image of DLC2 Map](http://charlieintel.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/dlc2-screen-zombie.jpg)

Call of Duty’s site source code claims this image name is `dlc2-screen-zombies`.

We are not able to find the name of this new map in the website. Activision has yet to officially announce Black Ops 3’s DLC 2, but we will update as we learn more. Stay tuned.

##What is this *Merge*? Why am I being redirected here?

If you haven't already, read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/3yyrvu/coming_soon/) by /u/JoyousCacophony:

&gt; Hey all,

&gt; In the coming months, this subreddit is going to get a complete redo.

&gt; The goal is to consolidate the Call of Duty community in one place (it sucks trying to rebuild a community with every release).

&gt; A complete CSS redesign is being worked on and mods from all CoD subreddits will be brought on here to ensure the community isn't divided.

&gt; If you have any wishes or suggestions, leave a comment.

&gt; Happy New Year, everyone!

##*Why Merge?*

Our main goal for this merge is to combine nearly all (will talk about in a second) of the Call of Duty Subreddits into one, /r/CallofDuty. Why? Because, making a new subreddit and rebuilding a new community each year sucks, both for the users and the moderators. The overall idea of this merge is to create one huge hub for all the Call of Duty Games, no more split community, no more trying to find the subreddit for the game you're looking for, it's all going to be right here on /r/CallofDuty.

If you take a look at pretty much any of the older COD Subs such as /r/BlackOps2, /r/COD4, /r/CODAW, etc. you'd see that they're all what we call *dead*. There's hardly any content there, they're no longer Moderated by the Mods, it's just empty. However, that doesn't mean there isn't users there, there are, but the experience for them sucks. They don't get to have a big community to discuss with because they're still playing the old game whereas majority of the community has moved to the next game. One huge part of this merge will be reviving the content from older games.

##Post/Game Filters

We're still in the process of creating it, however we're going to have an extremely easy to use system of Flair Filters where users could click a Single Button and see posts from only a specific game of their choice. This is the best solution there is, that way if you want to see content from only Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare all you'll have to do is Click the Advanced Warfare Button in the Sidebar and you'll be taken to pages full of Advanced Warfare content, nothing else.

Want to see content from all games? No problem, by default the Subreddit will show submissions for all Call of Duty Games.

##The Redesign

As you can tell, this Subreddit is pretty outdated when it comes to CSS. Along with the merge this Subreddit is going to get a complete overhaul based off of /r/Naut 4.0, a project myself and a couple others have worked on. I have huge plans for the Subreddit's CSS, can't say yet but I think you'll all love it.

Go take a look at /r/Naut for a general idea of what this Sub will look like. However, this Subreddit will have tons of Customization and Features to make it unique. If you're curious as to what to expect, check out some of the Subreddits I moderate, such as /r/CODZombies, /r/Treyarch, /r/Excision, etc.

Have an idea for the Subreddit Redesign? Suggest it in the comments and it may happen!

##*Which Subreddits will be Merged?*

Almost all of the Call of Duty based Subreddits will be merged into /r/CallofDuty. 

The only Subreddits that are planned to stay un-merged are /r/CODZombies, /r/CODAliens, /r/CODCompetitive, and /r/COD_LFG.

If you're the owner of a Call of Duty Subreddit that hasn't yet been merged, please contact myself or the other Mods via PM or Mod Mail, we'd like to get as many Subreddits merged as possible that way the community is as least-split as possible.

Currently all of the Main Call of Duty Subreddits other than /r/BlackOps3 have been merged if you haven't already realized. /r/BlackOps3 will not be merged until everything is setup and ready to go.

##*This is going to be Chaos!*

We're prepared, currently we're in the process of ensuring all of the Mods on the Mod List will be active and helpful with the Subreddit after the merge. 

With the help of our New Bot (see below) and New Moderator(s) we think we've got this all under control, if not, we can always add new Moderators.

This is also another reason we're starting with merging the smaller subs, this will slowly ease the community into the transition other than moving all the Subs at once. /r/BlackOps3 will not be merged until everything is ready to go.

##The New Bot

The AutoModerator that you all know and love is great, however it just doesn't do everything we need it to. We have a entirely custom Bot coming from /u/TheReal_DF that will be coming along with the Merge, this Bot can do sooooo many things that AutoModerator can't. 

Here's just a few of the **MANY** features to come:

* Twitch/YouTube/MLG Livestreams in the Sidebar for all Official Call of Duty Events
* XBL/PSN/Steam/COD Service Status in the Sidebar
* Improved Spam and Self Promotion detection
* Improved Subreddit Environment Monitoring to ensure an overall good community
* Improved Common Topic/Repost detection
* Self-Learning and Heuristic Features
* + Many More!

Please give a huge thank you to /u/TheReal_DF for spending his own time putting this all together for us, as well as hosting the Bot on his personal server. This Bot would be nearly impossible and much more expensive without him!

##Discord Channel

If you weren't already aware, [we've launched a Discord Channel over on /r/BlackOps3](](https://reddit.com/r/blackops3/comments/42swnu/introducing_the_rblackops3_discord_server/?ref=search_posts), since then it has somewhat died but we're hoping to revive it especially after this merge. We hope to build an active community in this Discord Server to have a 24/7 Live Chat with like-minded Redditors. If you're interested, please try and keep this chat alive by participating and keeping discussion related to Call of Duty.

**What is Discord?**

&gt; Discord is a free voice and text chat app designed specifically for gaming. 

&gt; Discord was born out of our own frustrations with the voice and chat tools we all use while playing games. It’s a bit strange that in 2015 most of us are using chat apps that haven’t been updated in years to play games that are updated every week. We deserve better.

&gt; Discord brings gaming communication out of the stone age. It's free, easy to use, and with you even while you are AFK. 

&gt; You can check out an extensive list of advanced features on the [Discord landing page](http://www.discord.gg/).

**Will this Chat be Moderated?**

This Server will be Moderated just as the Subreddit is. Users can and will be Kicked, or even banned. Please report any abusive users to the Moderators via Mod Mail here on /r/CallofDuty or by using the @ Command in the Discord Room.

**A better way to Party Up**

Since the Launch of the Discord Server we've opened up the #party-up room for everyone to use as an alternative to /r/COD_LFG.

**How do I use Discord?**

Sign up for a Free Account with Discord, you must have a Verified Email Address to use our Server, this is to prevent spam and trolls.

Discord has a [Web Client](https://discordapp.com/) that you can use in your browser, which doesn't require any downloads.

You can also Download the Discord App on pretty much any device, Links below.

* [Discord for Mac OSX](https://discordapp.com/api/download?platform=osx)
* [Discord for Windows](https://discordapp.com/api/download?platform=win)
* [Discord for Apple iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/discord-chat-for-games/id985746746)
* [Discord for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.discord)

**Sounds great, where do I sign up?**

You can Join the /r/CallofDuty Server using either of the methods below:

* [Direct Link to Server](https://discord.gg/0n0xyqImZeLeWpwM)
* Server Code: 0n0xyqImZeLeWpwM

If you have any other comments, suggestions, questions, or whatever feel free to ask below, we're all ears!

Thank you,

and see you soon.

Until now... Introducing the /r/CODZombies Twitch Bot! 

##What is this Bot, how does it work?

If you're an active member of this Subreddit (more below), we will allow for you to advertise your stream in the Sidebar of this Subreddit. This means whenever you go live, your twitch username, the game you're playing, and the amount of viewers you have will be right there in the Sidebar for everybody to see!

##What about those of us who don't stream, how is this good for us?

This will allow for you guys to find more streams from smaller names in the community, you're able to find streams that aren't full of viewers and the chat being spammed. You also help out some of you fellow Redditors by watching their streams.

If you're ever bored of the normal 'ol Zombies Streams, check the sidebar, one of us could be live!

##Where do I sign up? 

This is where it gets tricky, the Mods will use their discretion on who gets into the Streams list, and who doesn't. No, this is not us picking favorites, we're not going to allow someone who just made their first post on the subreddit to advertise their stream here, for obvious reasons.

Leave your Twitch URL below, and tell us what kind of streamer you are. What do you usually stream? Are you a more humorous and laid back stream or a super serious stream? This is a requirement.

##More

All Call of Duty Titles are allowed to be streamed, no you don't *have to* stream Zombies, but obviously you're going to bring in more viewers from the Subreddit if you do. If you're streaming something other than Call of Duty, the Bot will not display it in the Sidebar.

This Bot will update every 5 Minutes, if you have been told by myself or another Mod that your stream has been added and you're live but don't see it within 5 minutes, let us know and we'll figure out what the problem is.

Some people don't use the same name on Twitch as they do on Reddit, so you might see some unfiiliar names over there, don't worry, the Mods will keep track of everyone added to the List. For example, my username here is /u/LackingAGoodName, but on Twitch it's `Mxtive`, so if you see `Mxtive` in the Sidebar, that's me!

Thanks,

There seems to be some confusion on this Subject, so I figured I'd make a post to clear things up for those of you confused.

Der Eisendrache information and news can and will be posted on the Subreddit upon release, ~~however it **must** be spoiler tagged. Also, any posts with huge Storyline Spoilers in the titles will be removed.~~ Let me rephrase this, Titles that have the potential to lead to spoilers or hint at spoiler will be blacked out, titles that don't have any spoilers but have a post body with spolers will be marked as *Spoilers Inside*.

For example:

* A Good Title: *New Teddy Bear Easter Egg Found on Der Eisendrache!*
* A Bad Title: *Maxis Face Reveal + Richtofen Dies on Der Eisendrache!* &lt;--- (Not a Real Spoiler...) 

Please be respectful to the community members who will not have the Map on Release, just because you are getting the Map before someone else doesn't mean it's okay to ruin their expierence. However, Xbox/PC Users if you don't want to be spoiled or you want to find things for yourself, we reccomend staying away from the Sub until DLC1 Releases for you.

**How to Spoiler Tag:**

* In Comments: `[Text Here](/spoiler)` will look like ---&gt; [Text Here](/spoiler)
* In Post Titles: Put `[SPOILERS]` at the beginning of your title.

If you have any other questions or comments, please let us know!

---

Since some of you clearly don't agree with this as I can tell by the Downvotes, think about it like this, what if you were in the Xbox/PC Users' Position, remember the last few years when you guys were getting DLC late? You didn't want to be spoiled, and some of you didn't want to get up and leave a Sub that you enjoyed browsing for a month just to not be spoiled. Have a little empathy.

Also, as I said in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/433idf/mod_post_regarding_posts_about_der_eisendrache/czf96ga):

&gt; No, I think  you're over-estimating the amount of Spoiler Tagged Posts. The Rule still stands, no clear/obvious spoilers in titles, that's just common sense. The only spoiler tagged posts are going to be the ones that don't necessarily have Spoilers in the titles, but hint at something that could be a spoiler, example: *Did ___ really die in that cutscene?!*.

&gt; We have 2 types of spoiler tags, the one that blacks out the title, and then just the normal link flair where *Discussion* would usually be would say *Spoilers Inside*.

We've got something new for all of you that we think you'll find very useful and fun, an [Official /r/BlackOps3 Discord Server](https://discord.gg/0n0xyqImZeLeWpwM)!

##What is Discord?

&gt; Discord is a free voice and text chat app designed specifically for gaming. 

&gt; Discord was born out of our own frustrations with the voice and chat tools we all use while playing games. It’s a bit strange that in 2015 most of us are using chat apps that haven’t been updated in years to play games that are updated every week. We deserve better.

&gt; Discord brings gaming communication out of the stone age. It's free, easy to use, and with you even while you are AFK. 

&gt; You can check out an extensive list of advanced features on the [Discord landing page](http://www.discord.gg/).

##What's the point of this Discord Server?

We hope to build an active community in this Discord Server to have a 24/7 Live Chat with like-minded Redditors. If you're interested, please try and keep this chat alive by participating and keeping discussion related to Call of Duty: Black Ops III.

Eventually, this Server might also be used as a better way to Party Up and find players for Black Ops III.

##Will this Chat be Moderated?

This Server will be Moderated just as the Subreddit is. Users can and will be Kicked, or even banned. Please report any abusive users to the Moderators via Mod Mail here on /r/BlackOps3.

##How do I use Discord?

Sign up for a Free Account with Discord, you must have a Verified Email Address to use our Server, this is to prevent spam and trolls.

Discord has a [Web Client](https://discordapp.com/) that you can use in your browser, which doesn't require any downloads.

You can also Download the Discord App on pretty much any device, Links below.

* [Discord for Mac OSX](https://discordapp.com/api/download?platform=osx)
* [Discord for Windows](https://discordapp.com/api/download?platform=win)
* [Discord for Apple iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/discord-chat-for-games/id985746746)
* [Discord for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.discord)

##Sounds Great, where do I sign up?

You can Join the /r/BlackOps3 Server using either of the methods below:

* [Direct Link to Server](https://discord.gg/0n0xyqImZeLeWpwM)
* Server Code: 0n0xyqImZeLeWpwM

Welcome to the Official /r/CODZombies Unfound Easter Egg Hunt! As [suggested by /u/XPLJESUS](https://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/3zhsp0/why_dont_we_dedicate_days_to_collectively_going/), we will have daily threads dedicated to collectively searching throughout old maps as a community for Unfound Easter Eggs.

Use this thread to discuss **any** suspicions or ideas you have. Don't be discouraged if we don't find anything, we're not expecting to. However, we never know if there's anything left in these old maps. Hell, the [Character Bio's Easter Egg](https://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/3zhsp0/why_dont_we_dedicate_days_to_collectively_going/) was *just* found!

Don't be scared to post your suspicions, these Maps have been out for years and there's still possibly stuff to be found, even if you found something very small and you're unsure if it's even relevant, talk about it in the comments. If you see someone asking about something that is already found or known, please correct them and point them in the direction of what their finding is.

All forms of Easter Egg Hunting are encouraged, whether that be playing the game, No Clipping, or data mining. If you're anti data mining, get over it. Even if nothing comes out of all of these threads, it is still nice to be able to revisit the old Maps and have some fun.

Don't have Black Ops? No worries, we'll be going through each and every one of the Call of Duty: Zombies Maps, in order, all the way up to The Giant (BO3), over the next week or so.

Want to find Players to help hunt? The [Party Up Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/search?q=author%3AAutoModerator+Party+Up&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on) isn't only for Black Ops 3, try posting there and finding others who are looking to hunt on the old maps. Pro Tip: If you're on PC, use Ctrl-F and type Nacht or whatever the Map Name may be, you can use that to quickly search for players that are hunting.

See y'all tomorrow on Black Ops' **Verrückt**!

We've made an [Official /r/CODZombies Discord Server](https://discord.gg/0lRKp64BMx7oJDLO)!

Users like you are now able to enter this Chat Room whenever you'd like and talk about pretty much anything with like minded players like yourselves! Additionally, Discord can be used to find players right then and there rather then waiting on people in the Party Up Thread.

##What's Discord?

*All-in-one voice and text chat for gamers that’s free, secure, and works on both your desktop and phone. Stop paying for TeamSpeak servers and hassling with Skype. Simplify your life.*

##Will the Discord Chat be Moderated?

Yes, additionally, pretty much all of this Subreddit's Rules apply in the Discord Chat. Abusive Users will be banned.

##How do I use the /r/CODZombies Discord Server?

There are multiple ways you can use the Discord Server. As far as I know, you aren't required to make an account, however we do recommend it.

Discord has a [Web Client](https://discordapp.com/) that you can use in your browser, which doesn't require any downloads.

You can also Download the Discord App on pretty much any device, Links below.

* [Discord for Mac OSX](https://discordapp.com/api/download?platform=osx)

As [suggested by /u/XPLJESUS](https://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/3zhsp0/why_dont_we_dedicate_days_to_collectively_going/), we will have daily threads dedicated to collectively searching throughout old maps as a community for Unfound Easter Eggs.

Use this thread to discuss **any** suspicions or ideas you have. Don't be discouraged if we don't find anything, we're not expecting to. However, we never know if there's anything left in these old maps. Hell, the [Character Bio's Easter Egg](https://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/3zhsp0/why_dont_we_dedicate_days_to_collectively_going/) was *just* found!

Don't be scared to post your suspicions, these Maps have been out for years and there's still possibly stuff to be found, even if you found something very small and you're unsure if it's even relevant, talk about it in the comments. If you see someone asking about something that is already found or known, please correct them and point them in the direction of what their finding is.

All forms of Easter Egg Hunting are encouraged, whether that be playing the game, No Clipping, or data mining. If you're anti data mining, get over it. Even if nothing comes out of all of these threads, it is still nice to be able to revisit the old Maps and have some fun.

Don't have Black Ops? No worries, we'll be going through each and every one of the Call of Duty: Zombies Maps, in order, all the way up to The Giant (BO3), over the next week or so.

Want to find Players to help hunt? The [Party Up Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/search?q=author%3AAutoModerator+Party+Up&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on) isn't only for Black Ops 3, try posting there and finding others who are looking to hunt on the old maps. Pro Tip: If you're on PC, use Ctrl-F and type Nacht or whatever the Map Name may be, you can use that to quickly search for players that are hunting.

See y'all tomorrow on Black Ops' **Shangri-La**!

Don't have World at War? No worries, we'll be going through each and every one of the Call of Duty: Zombies Maps, in order, all the way up to The Giant (BO3), over the next couple days.

See y'all tomorrow on Verrückt!

Want to find Players to help hunt? The [Party Up Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/3zddm1/rcodzombies_weekday_party_up_thread_january_04/) isn't only for Black Ops 3, try posting there and finding others who are looking to hunt on the old maps.

Now maybe I'm just an idiot because it's currently 5:08am and I haven't slept (fml) and these aren't significant at all, but what are these coordinates for? They all lead to some pretty random locations that don't make a lot of sense. I've never been a collector or fan of legos so maybe this is a normal thing?

 * Coordinates: Same as Farm
 * Location: Same as Farm

None of these make any sense to me. There are also some other Lego Sets such as Nuketown and *Outbreak* but those didn't have any coordinates on them so I didn't include them.

So first we have Moon, the location for this one leads to a random-ass road in the middle of a desert in California. There's literally nothing around this location. There's a street view available for this one, there's nothing but dirt to be seen.

Secondly we have Diner, the location for this one leads to what looks like some small community/neighborhood of houses near the desert in California. There's no street view available for this one.

Third we have Farm, the location for this one leads to what looks to be a farm that's somewhere out in Canada. Notice the Corn Field next to it when you go to Street View? This one surprised me.

Fourth we have Mod of the Dead, the location for this one lead to some fucking office building in Canada. Street View shows the Office Building, not much around other than the Warehouse across the street.

Lastly we have Buried, this one has the exact same coordinates as the Farm Lego Set.",CODZombies,What is the significance of the coordinates on the Lego Call of Duty Zombies boxes?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/3ye05f/what_is_the_significance_of_the_coordinates_on/

As much as I'd like to think it's part of an Easter Egg on The Giant, I guess it's just due to the Lighting Glitch from the Wunderwaffe. There's a few things that give it away as a Glitch, my guns are glowing, the box is flashing, and the perk machines are flashing.

However every time I jumped toward the wall to buy the KN-44 I'd get some Framerate Lag (as seen in the clip), that was a bit weird.

If any of you for whatever reason want to recreate this, I'll try and list everything done in that game.

* Juggernog
* Mule Kick
* Wunderwaffe (PaP'd)

Hey,

I'm in a bit of a situation right now where I can only afford one of three pieces of Equipment that I plan on getting over time.

Make sure you read my *current setup* before answering, it's kind of important. It should also be noted that I am on Xbox One, not PS4. I am a *competitive* player, I mainly play Pubs with friends and my *team* /r/RedditBlack.

Firstly, **My Current Setup:**

 * **Monitor:** [Acer S200HQL - 20in LCD, 1600x900, 5ms Response Time, 60hz Refresh Rate](http://www.amazon.com/Acer-S200HQL-Class-LCD-Monitor/dp/B00M21N7AU)
 * **Headset:** [Turtle Beach XO One - 50mm Speakers, Stereo Audio](http://www.amazon.com/Turtle-Beach-Force-Amplified-Gaming-Headset/dp/B00KSVXSZU)
 * **Controller:** [Standard Xbox One Controller](http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-One-Wireless-Controller-Without-millimeter/dp/B00CMQTUSS) with [Kontrol Freek Sentinel's](http://www.amazon.com/FPS-Freek-Sentinel-Xbox-One/dp/B00OVACZCQ)

Yes, I know it's a cheap setup, but it works. That's why I'm going to Upgrade one of these right now while I have the money, then eventually the rest will be upgraded as well.

**My Future Setup:** (Which one of these do YOU think is most important?)

 * **Monitor:** [BenQ RL2455HM - 24in LED, 1920x1080, 1ms Response Time, 75hz Refresh Rate](http://www.amazon.com/BenQ-Gaming-Monitor-RL2455HM-24-Inch/dp/B007HSKSMI)
 * **Headset:** [Astro A40 TR + Mixamp Pro - ??mm Speakers, Surround Sound](http://www.amazon.com/A40-Headset-MixAmp-Pro-Xbox-One/dp/B014H2T84K)
 * **Controller:** [Nadeshot Infinity1 - Not sure what customizations I'll have on it yet](https://scufgaming.com/shop/scufinfinity/nadeshot-scuf-infinity1/)
  * **Controller Option 2:** [Xbox One Elite Controller - This is also an option if I choose I'd rather have it than a Scuf, let me know if any of you have experience with this](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/controllers/elite-wireless-controller)

Like I said, I know my current setup isn't all that great. I'm aware that Xbox One runs at 1920x1080p (900p Upscaled to 1080p on COD, right?) and my monitor is only 1600x900p. I know Xbox One doesn't surpass 60fps so I don't need to worry about 144hz Refresh Rate Monitor, 1ms would be preferred over 5ms, but that's not a huge difference. Surround Sound would be highly preferred to the Stereo Audio.

The reason I'm debating whether to get the Elite or the Scuf is because I've heard Scuf Support is awful, their products don't usually last too long, the Elite Controller comes with different sizes of Thumbsticks which I would like to mess with until I find the ones right for me, I'd like to get rid of my Kontrol Freeks and just have longer sticks, the default ones don't feel right to me. But damn, that Nadeshot Scuf is so good looking. After all Customizations, the Elite Controller would be cheaper.

Anyways, I'm curious to hear what you guys have to say about this. If you read this far, thank you.

I've been without any Game Audio whatsoever since January when I got my Xbox One (old Headset was broken and didn't work on X1). Now I have 2 options...

1. Buy [this pair of used Astro A40's + Mixamp Pro](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Astro-Gaming-A40-Audio-System-White-Xbox-360-Microphone-Mic-5E/401013331593?_trksid=p2047675.c100005.m1851&amp;_trkparms=aid%3D222007%26algo%3DSIC.MBE%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D33872%26meid%3D4178e4a2cab640ff936b4f6b7c393a16%26pid%3D100005%26rk%3D3%26rkt%3D6%26sd%3D111800000940&amp;rt=nc) which would be $155, then I'd have to buy the Microsoft Chat Adapter which is another $20 + tax. $180 or so in total.

2. Wait until Black Friday (after BO3 Release), and buy a New Pair of [Astro A40 TR's](https://www.astrogaming.com/a40-tr-headset-%2B-mixamp-pro-tr/A40-MIXAMP-TR.html) for $200 or so. If they do the same thing as last year, they'll do $50 off of Headsets.

Honestly don't know which I should go for. I don't really have a problem with used products, but then again it's Ebay and I've been fucked over before from people on there. The only thing really holding me back is that Black Ops III release prior to Black Friday so I'll have to go a couple weeks after release without Game Audio.",redditblack,Need some opinions,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditblack/comments/3pk08q/need_some_opinions/

##Q: Does *The Giant* come with Season Pass?

A: At the moment, no. Currently *The Giant* is exclusive to Juggernog Edition, Digital Deluxe Edition, and Hardened Edition.

##Q: Should I get Black Ops III on Last-Gen?

A: If you can, get it on PC or Current-Gen. Take a look at Advanced Warfare, there's literally no room for the new features and such on Last-Gen. Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 are 10+ Year Old Hardware, sooner or later they're going to become completely obsolete. [Black Ops III will not have a Campaign on Last-Gen](http://charlieintel.com/2015/09/25/black-ops-3-on-ps3-and-xbox-360-will-only-feature-mp-and-zombies-no-campaign-mode/), it is currently unknown if it will even have DLC Maps, so far there is no word of *The Giant* being on Last-Gen.

##Q: Where's Digital Deluxe Edition on Xbox Store?

A: [On October 7^th, the Digital Deluxe Edition was removed from the Xbox Store](http://charlieintel.com/2015/10/07/black-ops-3-removed-from-the-xbox-one-store/). It is still unknown why it was removed, but it is most likely because it went live for Pre-Load too early. **[On October 15^th, the Digital Deluxe Edition was re-added to the Xbox Store](http://charlieintel.com/2015/10/15/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-digital-preorders-returns-to-the-xbox-one-store/)**.

##Q: Where can I buy Juggernog Edition?

A: Juggernog Edition is sold out in Retail Stores, online and offline. However, you may be able to pick it up on Ebay at a higher price, though this isn't necessarily the most reliable method.

##Q: How many Zombies Maps will be available at Launch?

A: As of now, there are technically 3. *Shadows of Evil* will be shipped with the disc and will be available to anyone with the game. *The Giant* is a Special Edition Bonus (as mentioned above), and will be available shortly after release. [Dead Ops Arcade 2](/spoilers) [has Leaked but not yet been officially revealed](http://charlieintel.com/2015/10/05/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-campaign-and-zombues-trophies-revealed/), it is currently unknown how it will be unlocked, and if it will be available at Launch.

##Q: If I bought the game Digitally, will I be able to Pre-Load?

A: Yes, however it is currently unknown when the game will go live for Pre-Loading.",CODZombies,Call of Duty: Black Ops III - Frequently Asked Questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/3p5v70/call_of_duty_black_ops_iii_frequently_asked/

What do you think about the Gumballs? Do you like them? Do you dislike them? How do you think they'll play out when the game releases?

Personally I really like them, some seem a bit *overpowered*, but for the most part I think they did a great job with them. I do think it's going to be a little hard to get used to, but eventually I'm sure we'll all grow to love them.

##Symptoms

* Pressing the Power Button turns the Indicator Blue for a short amount of time, nothing shows on Screen then it turns Red.

* No picture what-so-ever, not even the Haier Logo when first powering up.

* Popping Noise when it first went out.

* No Light on Screen, stays completely black as if it was turned off.

* Sort of a strong smell after it popped, kinda like something was burning.

If this is infact a Bulb or Power Board failure, could you link me to the part needed? I can't seem to find any Bulbs online, and I wanna make sure I've found the right Power Board.

Hey everybody, as you can see, the New CSS is here! Myself and the other Mods were extremely excited to get this to you guys. I've been working on it for about a Month now, and ever since I started I couldn't wait to show you all.

Before we get into the main part of this Post, I'd like to do a quick introduction of myself to allow you to get to know your Moderators a little better.

I'm one of New-*ish* Mods here at /r/CODZombies, and I'm so excited to be able to do what I'm doing. This is the first *popular* Subreddit that i have Moderated, so please bare with me if you feel I or any of the other Mods aren't doing our Job correctly.

One thing we strive for is an open community, we want everybody to feel welcomed here, whether they be a New User or Long-Time User, we want to hear from you, we want to know what you want to happen with this Subreddit. Please, do not hesitate to ask us questions, correct us if we're wrong, or give us pointers and suggestions. We want to make this the best possible experience for every user here.

##The New CSS

It's fuckin' beautiful, right? Like I said, for the past Month I've been working on this CSS for countless hours putting so much time into it. Myself and the Mods think it's great, but more importantly we want to know what you think of it.

I feel like I perfectly captured the Zombies-*esque* style, with the Dark Colors mixed with the Red blood-like highlights. One of my favorite parts about this CSS is the Rotating Header.

###Feedback

Before you call me out on it, I know, there are a few bugs with this CSS, as there will be with any new CSS. I will be actively working on fixing these as quickly as possible, so please be patient with me while I do so.

But that doesn't mean you can't point things out to me, I can't see every bug or problem with the CSS, that's what I need you for, if you happen to come across a Bug, big or small, please let me know, via Modmail or reply to this Post.

Now lets get started with introducing the new stuff...

###Flairs

First off, flairs. As you've probably seen, User Flairs have been redone, they are pretty similar to the ones seen over at /r/BlackOps3. I felt these would help bring together the Community and make it a little friendlier, I do encourage you all to try and play with some people from this Subreddit, make some new friends. While the old Flairs were cool and all, they were pretty bulky and didn't really fit in with the new *Clean* look of this CSS.

Please Update your User Flair immediately if you haven't done so already.

I feel like I made one for all of the platforms that people will be playing on, however if there is a Platform that you think should be added, let me know.

###Upvote/Downvote Arrows

Another thing you may or may not have noticed, the Upvote and Downvote Arrows have been changed. This [idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/3e5hdu/new_animation_for_upvotes/) came from /u/ Chatcher_15, so thanks for that!

There was also a [very good suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/3flsns/suggestion_quotes_for_upvote_text/) that came from /u/Solariss, but currently we're sitting at 87,000 Characters with a 100,000 Character limit on the Stylesheet, so right now this idea won't be implemented, but it is a possibility for the future. 

###Guides

This isn't really a New CSS Feature, but I thought this would be the best place to mention it. Currently we have a [Guides Wiki Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/wiki/Guides) set up that is blank. In the future this page will be your go-to place for any and all tutorials for anything Call of Duty Zombies Related. You'll be able to find Easter Eggs, Strategies, etc. The main reason for this page is to have a more centralized area for you to find everything, and to eliminate the *Strategies for Origins?* Posts.

###Party Up Threads

Again, this isn't a New Feature from the CSS, but we need your Feedback, and I'm sure this post will get quite a bit of attention, so why not mention it here.

Which type of Party Up Posts do you prefer? Currently we have posts being put up twice a week, Monday - Friday, and Saturday - Sunday. We did have Daily Posts, but we didn't feel that was necessary. [Please Vote Here](http://strawpoll.me/5220253) and let us know which one you'd rather have.

###OP Flair

If you ask me, this is a very helpful feature. As you can see [here](http://prntscr.com/855ys8), ChefSlapChop was the Original Poster of this Thread, you can tell by the Red Box around his name. This isn't necessarily an amazing feature, but I for one love it.

###Verification Flairs

Some of you may or may not know, Developers and Popular YouTubers are all around us on Reddit. But there's also tons of fakes, or people claiming to be who they aren't. We've come up with a solution to this problem, Verification Check Marks. Yes, the ones like you see on Twitter. Say, for example, /u/DavidVonderhaar leaves a comment on a Thread, you'll [see the Verification Mark next to his edited name stating who he is and why he's important]().

If there are any other Devs or *Popular* YouTubers here that are interested in the Verification Flair, please contact the Mods for further information. **Not just anybody is allowed the flair, only Developers or YouTubers that greatly contribute to the Community are given the Flair**.

##Conclusion

I'd like to thank each and every one of you for giving me the opportunity to Moderate this Sub along with an amazing group of guys. I look forward to the years to come.

One more thing, please check back often on this Post, I'm sure there's a bunch that I forgot to include that I'll edit in later :)

**TL;DR: I and the other Mods look forward to what's to come of this Subreddit. New CSS with quite a few features, Bugs/Glitches are to be expected early in its release, please let me know if you find any problems.**",CODZombies,"ANNOUNCEMENT: Out with the Old, in with the New! - The New CSS is here!",http://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/3h6bnd/announcement_out_with_the_old_in_with_the_new_the/

This isn't really a huge feature to add, however myself and I'm sure others would find it very convenient. If you're lazy like me and like to use the Moderation Tools Box to configure AutoMod's Rules, you'd probably benefit from a Link to AutoMod's Schedule Posts Wiki Page.

I am currently working on a Test Subreddit, using /r/Naut 3.2, I can unprivate [my Sub](/r/CSSStylesheetTesting) if needed, though I will try to provide all of the necessary information.

#Problem

I took and added to the User Flairs seen over at /r/BlackOps3, however they don't display correctly anywhere on my Sub [except the Moderators box](http://prntscr.com/824zt2). [Here's what they look like everywhere else](http://prntscr.com/8250al).

To be clear, [this is how they're **supposed to** look](http://prntscr.com/824zt2), and [this is how they do look](http://prntscr.com/8250al).

#Code I'm using

I will throw it all below.

#Conclusion

Does anybody know what may be causing this? I've tried changing the `padding-left:` because that seems to be the problem, but I can't do a negative amount on the `padding-left:`.

The Problem is that AutoModerator's Scheduled Post contains the words from the first rule, meaning that as soon as AutoModerator creates its weekly post, it deletes it. Is there a way I can have AutoMod *exempt* itself **without adding AutoModerator as a Moderator of the Subreddit**? What would be the best way to go about this?

I've been anxiously waiting to hear how my Application Process was going, I was ecstatic to hear that I was accepted! I'd like to do a quick little introduction for those of you who haven't read [My Application](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditblack/comments/37fquh/application_not_your_average_rblk_application/) (which you should totally read, if you're interested).

My Name is Ethan, my Gamertag is *oMotive*, Add Me if you'd like! I look forward to what's ahead, and the future of Reddit Black. I know this is a somewhat *awkward* time of the Year to Join, everybody is burnt out on the latest COD, I understand, but if anybody wants to play some games I'll be more than happy.

The rBLK Community has been awesome so far, I immediately felt welcomed to the Sub and to the Players. It was really fun getting to know some of you and I look forward to getting to know more of you. Everybody on and off of the Sub are really friendly, genuine people, that's one reason I say I'm *proud* to be a part of this Team!

**EDIT:**

I'd like to give a huge thanks to the people who have helped me along the way!
