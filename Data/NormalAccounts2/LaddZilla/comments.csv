528,"Here's the article: CHELSEA legend Michael Essien has turned his attention to the A-League after returning to Stamford Bridge last month to train with manager Antonio Conte.

Essien, 33, has given an Australian agent a mandate to find him a club in the A-League.

The Ghanaian international won two titles, four FA Cups and the UEFA Champions League during eight-and-a-half years at Chelsea before joining AC Milan in 2014.

The agent confirmed to The Advertiser Essien was available at this stage of the Australian preseason.

Adelaide United is one club which has a foreign spot available but club officials have their eyes set on securing a Spanish central striker.

Essien may be secured as one of Football Federation Australia’s full season guest players.

A-League clubs can win financial assistance if they attract big-name players who satisfy strict FFA criteria.

Melbourne City completed this process with the signing of Socceroos legend Tim Cahill.

However the FFA turned down Italian international Alessandro Diamanti, which means clubs will be wary of exploring Essien’s availability.

Diamanti was reportedly rejected as a potential guest player option for Melbourne Victory despite the 33-year-old Italian playing in the EURO 2012 where the Azzurri reached the final, the English Premier League and Italy’s Serie A.

Known as the ‘Bison’ due to his strength and incredible stamina, defensive midfielder Essien who recently ended his tenure at Greek club Panathinaikos, has company in his search for an A-League club.

Argentine striker Gonzalo Bergessio, 32, who played for Italy’s Sampdoria, Portugal’s Benfica, and recently Atlas of Mexico, has been presented as an option for A-League clubs.

So too has attacker/winger Andrea Gasbarroni, 35, after the Italian was on the books of Juventus, Torino and Parma.",2016-09-05 06:32:53+00:00,d7a0c18,1.0,t3_518628,182,Aleague

705,"Here's the article for anyone getting blocked: 

The U.S. men’s national soccer team will play New Zealand in an Oct. 11 friendly at Washington’s RFK Stadium, the Insider has learned.

An official announcement is expected this week. The kickoff time and TV details for the Tuesday night match are being finalized.

The U.S. Soccer Federation and local officials signed a contract several weeks ago to stage a match, even though the opponent had not yet been set.

Ghana was the USSF’s first choice, but scheduling issues on the Black Stars’ end prevented an agreement. Ghana has a World Cup qualifier eight days earlier against Uganda, and while teams are allowed to play both a qualifier and friendly inside the same nine-day FIFA window, the sport’s governing body prevents the friendly from taking place more than a five-hour flight and two time zones away because of the burden on players and their clubs.

In this case, FIFA declined Ghana’s request for a waiver.

Aside from the New Zealand match, the Americans will play Cuba on Oct. 7 in Havana. New Zealand will face Mexico on Oct. 8 in Nashville.

While CONCACAF does not have any World Cup qualifiers in October — the semifinal round concludes in September and the final round begins in November — most countries around the world do have them. Consequently, the pool of potential opponents for the United States and other CONCACAF nations is small.

The U.S. men’s team has played more times at RFK than any other home stadium (23). Its previous appearance was in September 2015 for a 2-1 friendly victory against Peru.

With this fall’s visit coming in a FIFA window (Oct. 3-11), Coach Jurgen Klinsmann will have the option of summoning top players from leagues in Europe and Mexico, as well as MLS. However, MLS scheduled four matches during or immediately after the FIFA window — Colorado at Houston on Oct. 8, Houston at Seattle on Oct. 12, Columbus at Chicago on Oct. 13 and San Jose at Colorado on Oct. 13.

Often, for friendlies that conflict with league matches, Klinsmann and MLS clubs compromise on whether a player is selected. However, the United States is expected to advance to the final round of World Cup qualifiers, which would begin four weeks later. If the semifinal round finishes with the favorites winning their groups, the Americans would open the hexagonal at home on or around Nov. 11 against Mexico, presumably in Columbus, where the teams have clashed in qualifiers every four years since 2001 (all 2-0 U.S. victories).


New Zealand, ranked No. 93 by FIFA, last qualified for the World Cup in 2010 and, against long odds, drew all three group matches in South Africa. Ahead of the 2014 tournament, the All Whites won the Oceania championship but lost to Mexico in a two-leg qualifying playoff. Their 2018 quest will resume in November with a pair of third-round matches against New Caledonia.

Next summer, as OFC Nations Cup champions, the All Whites will participate in the FIFA Confederations Cup in Russia.

Since 2014, the team has been guided by Englishman Anthony Hudson, who began his coaching career in 2008 with Real Maryland, a fourth-tier club based in Rockville.",2016-08-16 22:04:02+00:00,d6kbam4,1.0,t3_4y0w5b,14443,Aleague

The striker of the team of France André-Pierre Gignac wants to leave his Mexican club Tigres UANL and proposed the name of Caen striker Andy Delort to replace him.

Indeed, the striker for France (30 years) wants to leave the Tigers of Monterrey, Mexican club he has become an icon this season after winning the trophy for best player of the opening Championship, that they won.
He plans to return to Europe, or even to discover another continent, and has informed its leaders. He even offered them the name of a possible successor to his compatriot Andy Delort (24), Caen striker, author of a solid first part of last season (12 goals, 2 assists).

1292,"Here is the article copy and pasted: 

MELBOURNE City is set to baulk at splashing the cash on an international megastar signing until it feels clubs can maximise returns on marquee player investment.

The A-League is crying out for big-name players.

But despite having the backing of its wealthy Manchester owners, City isn’t currently in the market for an overseas icon.

City is all but certain to have two marquee slots open with Robert Koren gone and midfielder Aaron Mooy set to pursue a European opportunity.

Bruno Fornaroli will fill one of those spots if the club can successfully sign the striker to a new deal, but the fact City will likely have one other slot available had given rise to hopes that a multi-million dollar star would be recruited.

But having seen the losses Sydney FC incurred in recruiting Alessandro Del Piero, City wants revenue-raising opportunities increased before it plumps for a big name.

The matter was raised at a meeting of A-League club chief executives on Wednesday.

Clubs have previously been unable to sign car sponsorship deals that clash with A-League naming rights partner, Hyundai.

Football Federation Australia has recently relaxed those rules, which may pave the way for City to reap the rewards of a lucrative partnership with Nissan already enjoyed by brother clubs in Manchester, New York and Yokohama.

But City feels more can be done, particularly on game day.

City discussed the possibility of owning more matchday revenue opportunities, for example FFA currently takes about 50 per cent of LED signage exposure time with ads promoting centralised sponsors.

“The clubs see marquee players as a vital part of the A-League marketing mix,” FFA said in a statement.

“These big names drive membership, crowds and TV ratings.""

“The commercial model that underpins the A-League is a separate program that’s not directly linked to marquee player acquisition.""

“Having centralised corporate sponsorship allows FFA to accrue funds that largely go back into the running of the competition, but we have also returned some key categories to the clubs, such as apparel, automotive, telcos and airlines.”

The City Group bought Melbourne Heart for $11.25m in 2014.

The building of its $15 million training facility, among other things, has ensured the club has lost more money in the past two years than almost all other A-League franchises.

And while the club’s off-shore ownership has given it the league’s “moneybags” tag, it still operates within a tight local budget afforded to it.

City spent $2m over two years on 2014-16 marquee Koren, while Fornaroli — still contracted under the salary cap for next season — has been offered a comparable amount to stay long-term.",2016-05-20 00:15:50+00:00,d3cbfxp,1.0,t3_4k5ke0,283,Aleague

2193,"Roughly translated using Google Translate: 

The Major League Soccer would have made a bid for the talented Mexican midfielder Marco Fabian de la Mora. According to Fox Sports International League of the United States and Canada would have a strong proposal to Chivas de Guadalajara for one of its most important players.

The MLS is a special operating system; contracts of all players (local or foreign) belong to the league, which 'gives' (to put it in some way) the player in question to the team that was interested in his services.

Major League Soccer has not so far disclosed the names of the clubs that might be interested in the services of the Mexican international. According to Fox Sports the first American division had offered $ 4 million from the record of Marco Fabian, who has repeatedly expressed interest in playing in Europe.

In January this year Colorado Rapids had shown considerable interest in the possibility of staying with the services of midfielder. It is unclear whether the team coached by Pablo Mastroeni remains ready to close a deal of this magnitude, but what has transpired is that the franchise of Major League Soccer that may be behind this transfer ficharía midfielder Sacred Flock in December and that it would yield immediate way to a European team, in order to get it back next summer.

Over the years the name of Marco Fabian has been associated with various teams from Germany, Holland and Spain, but the Guadalajara has so far been a one club man except assignment to Cruz Azul in 2014. Giovani dos Santos in Los Angeles Galaxy and Houston Dynamo Cubo Torres leading the way for some of the major operations that MLS seems determined to complete during the winter.
