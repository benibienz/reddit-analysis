0,"Was in a car wreck a few years back. We were going almost 80 on a freeway and we encounter some black ice, lose control, start spinning, grazed the median with the side of the car a couple of times, ended up doing a 360 across 3 lanes of traffic. I was certain that death was seconds away. My friend who was driving was shouting ""what do we do!? what do we do!?"" and all I could think to say was ""calm down dude, we're dead."" Everything felt like it was going super slow, I just sort of watched it all happen. Couldn't have been more fortunate, we spun off the road, hit a snow bank which cushioned the impact. Car didn't flip, no one was hurt, no other cars involved.  ",2016-08-14 19:26:49+00:00,d6hdv23,1.0,t3_4xo2za,21694.0,AskReddit

34,"lvl 10 butcher w master skin here, here's my 2 cents. He's very powerful, and very fragile (that anyone could probably tell you). He's a LOT of fun to play, there's nothing in this game more satisfying than chaining an Illidan or Zeratul to the ground and watching them struggle for their life unsuccessfully. He can solo merc camps starting at a pretty low level due to brand, and can chop down buildings in 0 time flat. I've tried a wide range of builds but ultimately settled on http://www.heroesnexus.com/talent-calculator/54-the-butcher#oPkSmSbSlShSuS2AA with 3 swing talents at lvl 1, lvl 13, and lvl 20. Sometimes I get block if the enemy team has a butcher (because butcher v butcher is great when you have block) or other such hard hitting auto attackers. At 13 spell shield can be pretty useful depending on enemy comp. And at 20 nexus blade is awesome when you don't feel too pressured, whereas Blink gives this guy a whole new dimension of terror. I give the butcher 10/10 for awesomeness, and consider him to be pretty balanced and well tuned. He will die when caught out of position, and his charge can often be used against him. If you are branded, don't let him hit you. He's very weak against stun/polymorph/blind.
