0,"That's a tough call truly. On the one hand, I'd tell you to follow your heart because love is one of the most fulfilling things in this life, but on the other it's probably too close to tell how much you really feel for this person and how much they feel for you. The only advice I could really give is make sure you're not deluding yourself on either of the options; make sure whatever it is you choose, you've truly chosen and not convinced yourself against your better judgment. Sorry I can't help much more, I'm the end the choice is truly yours and no one can really make it for you. Good luck.",2016-11-14 22:53:07+00:00,da0gst4,2,t1_da0dhfa,4224,AskReddit

It's a hard world we live in to allow such atrocities, the best we can do is try to move forward. I know you said you had people to talk to and comfort you, and my comment probably won't mean anything to you, but know that you can get through this. Maintain any hope you can for the future, and it will get better over time, albeit slowly. You may want to consider therapy as well, sometimes addressing it head on can help to cope.

I know it sounds stupid and clich√©, but you have to start focusing on yourself and break off your emotions for her, even though it's the hardest thing ever to do.

Shoot high initially so that even if you don't achieve your highest goal you'll still be in the general area and lead a decent life. Don't strive for mediocrity, but don't be afraid to be average either, most people are. Most of all, don't lose hope.

8,"I feel this 100% right now. The only way out is the hardest thing to ask of anyone: you have to force yourself to detach all emotion from her/him. No thinking how it could work, no what ifs, just focus on how you can move forward. It's practically impossible, but time makes it easier (or at least I hope so). I'm so sorry you have to go through this terrible feeling, but love is a gamble and one day you'll win the jackpot. Don't forget you're your own person, and one worthy of someone who truly loves you.",2016-11-14 22:14:25+00:00,da0f04x,2,t1_da0aj9i,5442,AskReddit
9,"Might interest you to read about Kierkegaard. The point is to not focus on the grand scheme of things, as life is temporary and you don't have time to worry about things you have no control over. Live your life for you, find goals that make your life worthwhile for you, nothing else matters to you in the end. Think about it, your reality consists of exactly what you can interact with and anything outside of that is irrelevant. Hope this helps with the existential dread, no one can really make life worth it for you though, that's something you have to do yourself",2016-11-14 22:09:18+00:00,da0erl6,2,t1_da0dipw,1550,AskReddit

She was my real significant other, and having that piece of you disappear with practically no reason why really hurts. Yesterday I had to accept that the chances that we'll be able to patch things up is practically nonexistent. Never do long distance unless you're perfectly sure that you both will be able to handle it, it's harder than you think and the chances you're the special couple that gets through it is slim. This isn't to say it can't work, just know that likely it won't work and that it's not your fault if it doesn't. Trying to keep my hope up, but I'm still pretty dead inside.
