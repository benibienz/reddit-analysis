4) Vesemir's death made me cry.

5) Alone, in front of Kaer Morhen. At the end of the game, when everyone left Kaer Morhen, I felt so lonely. I remembered the first Witcher when we had to defend it, when Triss got hurt, and the party in TW3 where we drank together with Eskel and Lambert. Being suddenly alone in Kaer Morhen, that was awfully sad.
