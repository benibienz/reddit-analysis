I'm not very familiar with integrated graphics for games, neither am I for small laptops, so I thought this would be the best subreddit to ask some piece of advice!

So the first one costs 150€ and has these specs: 
Intel Atom Z3735G, 1 GB of DDR3 RAM, 1024 x 600, storage is 16 GB (eMMC)


The second one costs 242€:
Intel Atom x5-Z8350, 4 GB of DDR3 RAM, 1366 x 768, storage is 32 GB (eMMC)


The third one costs 293€:
Intel Celeron N3060, 4 GB of DDR3 RAM, 1366 x 768, storage is 32 GB (eMMC)


And the last one costs 394€:

Intel Pentium N3710, 4 GB of DDR3 RAM, 1366 x 768, storage is 500 GB (HDD @ 5400 RPM)

What is the cheapest PC in that list that can run games like Borderlands/Modern Warfare 2/Battlefield 3 and stuff in 60 FPS and with a native resolution? (It doesn't need to crank all the settings in high)

Well, a SSD has a shorter lifespan than a HDD, so re-writing new datas everytime can be a serious pain in the ass and could reduce the speed of the SSD in the near future.

Nevertheless, is it safe to put it on my SSD anyway? Is the launcher finally updated so that you don't have to download the whole build everytime?

Alright, I don't own NMS yet because I'm a PC player and I'm waiting for tonight, but I've seen several footage from the game, and I'm also a Star Citizen backer.

So people flame Sean Murray and Hello Games in general because NMS isn't what we were promised. (Actually it is, but it didn't live to the hype, therefore people are disappointed, no surprise here)

There is a PC game in development since 2011, called Star Citizen, that is pushing the limits to a whole new level. You can compare it with NMS, because the objectives of the two games are the same: you do everything you want in a big, big Universe. 

You define your own objective in a MMO-ish world, but you don't have to meet other people, you can play like a lone wolf.

The game itself is in Alpha, and you can already buy it for a cheaper price than NMS. It is playable, but not at a large scale for the moment.

Some points of interest:

* You want transparency about the development? Cloud Imperium Games, the studio behind Star Citizen, releases every week video about the creation of the game. It's SO refreshing, because you're able to see how everything works and how it is going on.

There is NO cryptic interview where devs just dodge questions and promise things that won't happen.

The Youtube channel contains more than 700 videos about the game and its progress. That's what I call transparency: https://www.youtube.com/user/RobertsSpaceInd

* You want to play early footage of the game? Well, you can, starting now. (It's a PC exclusive though)
You can report bugs, interact with developers, and be an active member of the community
What was lacking in NMS development is that you couldn't invest yourself. You can't be part of it, you just have to wait for it and hope it will be the game you always wanted.

* You want procedurally generated planets? It will be a key feature of the game, just look at this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5XSiww9ZO4&amp;feature=youtu.be

* You want some good exploration alone? It's also possible. And in some planets, there are cities.

* You want to explore with friends, fight with or against them, make ship races, fly insanely huge ships where dozens of real people are in the same one, be a trader, a pirate, a miner, a cargo-deliverer, or anything else? You can.

Star Citizen is a game that will live up to the hype, because the community is strongly attached to the development.

To sum up, I consider NMS as an overpriced indie game that was ambitious, but failed to deliver everything we hoped for. Star Citizen is the next step, and we should enjoy NMS for what it is, and not cry about what is should have been.

**TL;DR**

* Star Citizen website https://robertsspaceindustries.com/

* Procedurally generated planets where you can land seamlessly https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5XSiww9ZO4&amp;feature=youtu.be

* Exploration, fighting, trading... Basically, everything NMS can offer.

* Meet other people for exploration or being in the same ship.

* Do what you want, where you want, when you want.

* Not released yet, expect the full game to be ready in 2017 or 2018.",NoMansSkyTheGame,"If No Man's Sky doesn't meet your expectations, don't forget that Star Citizen is around the corner",https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/4xci81/if_no_mans_sky_doesnt_meet_your_expectations_dont/

So a friend of mine gave me his old MSI laptop for free.

It has a i7 3630QM, 8 GB of RAM, a nice 1920x1080 display, a 750 GB 7200 rpm hard drive and a 660M with 2 GB GDDR5.

It's actually a good laptop, but it's too large for me (I often travel, and 15' s big, especially when it's as thick as this MSI), and the 660M struggles in the games that I like. (Overwatch, Brütal Legend, StarCraft...)

Well, I'm a European that will stay in the USA for a month, and I thought I could buy a good and small gaming laptop cheaper than in Europe.

I looked into the small 13"" Alienware with a 960M (heck, I know people here don't like Alienware, but this is the only company that makes 13"" gaming laptops), and no I sadly don't have the money for a Razer Blade. (God it is some good shit though)

So I have some questions for you:

Will a 960M be a huge improvement from a 660M?

I am currently experiencing a very troubling issue in my PCMR journey.

I've played for a long time in 60 FPS with my older PC. I always managed to lower the settings in order to get a smooth framerate.
And I was happy.

A few weeks ago, I decided to build a brand new computer in order to play in 1440p @144 FPS, so I bought the Asus Rog Swift. God, G-Sync is amazing and the 144 FPS are so sweet, especially in FPS such as CS: GO or MW2 (yes I'm still playing it!)

But then, I set my monitor to 60 Hz in order to see the difference, and there it happened: it felt choppy and awful. I started to panic because that was so weird, FRAPS and ShadowPlay were saying that I ran at 60 FPS but it felt like I was at 30 FPS.

So I launched Borderlands 2 and I set my max framerate to 30 FPS in the option menu. GOD THIS WAS UNPLAYABLE! I mean, 30 FPS always felt unsmooth for me, but this time my eyes hurt.

When I went back to my beloved 144 Hz/144 FPS everything was alright, but I was a bit scared...

What should I do? This is maybe a monitor issue? Are my eyes completely fucked up? Am I overreacting? Please, I'm begging for answers!",pcmasterrace,"Brothers, I cannot go back to 60 FPS.",http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/3hbxrt/brothers_i_cannot_go_back_to_60_fps/

So there are 2 parts that are missing, which are the i7 6700K and the MSI M7 motherboard.
However, I'm a bit afraid about my CPU cooler, the Dark Rock Pro 3. I've heard that the RAM doesn't fit very well, do you know if the G.Skills Ripjaws are okay, or are they too big?

Furthermore, is this build good for you? I've already bought my peripherals though.

Thank you guys!

In fact, I bought a rickety Alienware laptop 4 years ago, and I am kinda sick of it right now.

Could you guys review my build and tell me if anything is wrong? Thank you!

I lately helped a friend to ascend but we are currently having some troubles.

He ordered a build (already assembled), with a Zotac 970 Amp Edition, and when we boot it everything looks ok (and the Zotac logo on the graphic card turns on). But when we plug our monitor (Philips 234E), nothing appears. It just shows that there is no video signal.

We thought that it could come from the screen, however when we plug a random laptop to it, the monitor works fine as a second screen. (We used a HDMI entry)

Please, could you help and enlighten us ? ",pcmasterrace,"Issue with our monitor, my friend and I need help",http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/3e77v4/issue_with_our_monitor_my_friend_and_i_need_help/
