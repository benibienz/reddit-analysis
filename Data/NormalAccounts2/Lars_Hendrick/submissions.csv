We took her to the vet last night to check for tags and she has no chip, and across every website we've posted/looked on noone seems to be missing a matching dog. 

While at the vet we asked for an estimate on her age and breed, and were told about 5 months old and a possible G-Shep mix. What do you guys think?

About a week ago, while playing a game with some buds, my PC died suddenly. Turns out the MOBO had shorted, so I went and got it exchanged at microcenter for the same model. Unfortunately, after swapping everything, I started encountering this problem. Both 970's are seated properly, and have sufficient power. The CPU is seated properly and has sufficient power, as well as having the heatsink/fan seated as well. All the cables are plugged properly across the board. The RAM is seated correctly in all 4 buses. 

My PC turns on, and all my extra fans light up just fine. The problem is that my graphics cards fans DO NOT spin up, and don't output any video signal. I went and got a new PSU, RAM, and a new CPU and still no effect. I even went and got my old GTx 650 to test it and it also doesnt output any video on any of my monitors.
