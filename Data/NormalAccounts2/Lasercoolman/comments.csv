The class revolved teaching the funtamentals of engineering so the teacher brought in a car to demonstrate some things for the class. Two dumbasses in his class decided to get some jumper cabels and strap them to the car battery, then they proceded to clamp the ends onto one of their chests, which instantly fried his chest and sent him into cardiac arrest. Dispite the teachers atempts to save his life, the kids parents sued the teacher and he lost his teaching licence forever and was fined 100,000 dollars because of some dumbass idiots in his class.
