11,"Better formatted text:

Ever since he was born, Bort had severe autism. At least, that's what Ernie wanted you to think. Bort was born a happy, health IVF child, with no disabilities whatsoever. In fact, when he was born, both Bert and Ernie agreed to stop their acts of degeneracy so they could try to transition into a normal life. But after a mere week of trying to behave normally, Ernie couldn't take it.

 His carnal desire to cause discord had grown humongous. While Bert was out of the house shopping, Ernie went into Bort's room with a Monkey Wrench and beat him savagely. The attack damaged him so much, that it inflicted severe brain damage. Bort was ruined, and as a result, any chance that Bert and Ernie would lead normal lives again. 

Bert was horrified when Ernie told him the news that his autism tests had come back positive. But Ernie wasn't horrified. No, he was smiling on the inside. He knew that Bort would take his toll on Bert and as a result, he'd eventually slip back into killing. 

Bert had tried to run away from Ernie's control for so, so long. But it was foolish of him to even think that his life could return back to normal.",2016-11-17 20:06:46+00:00,da4nf39,1.0,t3_5dhzgn,33.0,bertstrips

17,"The progress bar shot up like a rocket as the cat firmware began updating.
Fuzzy's tail, now plugged into my computer, swished quickly from side to side. It's clear he wasn't happy about this. I looked back at Fuzzy himself and saw him glaring back at me, silent yet angry purrs exiting his mouth.

I heard a high-pitched *bing!* from the computer and turned to see that a notification had popped up. ""C.A.T was successfully upgraded to version 256.3! Please reconnect tail in order to complete the upgrade."" the notification read, accompanied by an emoticon of a smiling cat.

I detached the tail from the USB port, grabbing it by the base. As I reached out to grab Fuzzy, he seemed to back off, whether it be in fear or anger. He let out a deep growl, looking straight at me with his narrowed, amber eyes.
""Come on. Gotta upgrade, kitty."" I said to him. I knew he didn't understand. To him, I was probably just saying a bunch of cat words randomly.

Scooping him up with one hand, I moved the tail towards Fuzzy's USB port, took a deep breath and then plugged it in. Instantly, Fuzzy began making a loud electronic meow, as he eyes began shining a bright blue colour. He floated out of my hands, into the air and started spinning around like a dreidel, screaming as unknown forces tossed and turned him around the room.

I stepped back, grabbing the desk of my PC as the lights started to intensify and Fuzzy became a brownish-white blur. The cyan halation of his eyes glowed brightly across every wall of the room. 
And then, all of a sudden, everything went white. The only thing I could percieve was the infinite, snowy void that had appeared in front of me and Fuzzy's meow, which had risen in pitch so much it just sounded like a constant buzz.

Then, the whiteness began to fade. The familiar wreck that was my room slowly came into view. I rubbed my eyes and looked around. Where was Fuzzy?
That's when I heard him. A normal meow, like always. But it was one of THOSE meows. The annoying one cats do when they want something from you. If it was in English, it'd probably sound something like ""Hey! Gimme food, will ya'?"" or ""Where's the litterbox at? I need ta' take a fat cat SHIT!""

I spun around and saw Fuzzy floating in the air, yowling at me. He was, for some reason beyond all comprehension, flying. What sort of update was this? I grabbed Fuzzy and dropped him back onto the floor, where he started to slowly float up again, still meowing like the spoilt little furball he was.
My office chair creaked as I sat down on it and I began to read the ""Patch Notes"" section of the notification.

**NEW FEATURES:**

* *Cats will now take flight whenever they need something from you, whether it be food, water or even just being let out! Their meow will also quickly increase in loudness if their request is not fulfilled.*

* *There is now a 1/10000 chance that the shit fairy will be hiding in your cat's turds. She will grant you one wish, and only one!*

**FIXES:**

* *The ""Manx Tail"" glitch has been fixed.*

* *Cats are now 20% less likely to avoid laser pointers.*

* *Toxoplasma Gondii is now only present on ill cats.*

I leaned back in my chair. At least Fuzzy would make it obvious he wanted something now. So I opened the door and led him downstairs, where all his things would be. He glided past me into the centre of the kitchen. His food tray was there, the litterbox and the backdoor exit. He was a stray, after all.

But something was wrong. I didn't know which one he wanted. And the meows were getting louder and louder. They were sounding more like screams now.
I ran to the fridge as Fuzzy glided over and began shrieking into my ear.
Upon pulling out the milk and shaking it, Fuzzy stopped meowing for a second, sniffed it and then resumed shrieking.

I was going to get very tired of this, very quickly.",2016-11-16 22:38:53+00:00,da3ecb0,1.0,t3_5d9jqb,28210.0,WritingPrompts

29,"That's exactly what happened to me. I have a book that I've been writing. It's been in development for 2 goddamn years. Each time I'd write a draft, I'd work on it regularly for like 2 weeks and then gradually fall behind.

Then I'd get all angry and worked up over having not achieved deadlines and goals I set for myself, like writing 1000 words a day or doing a set amount of words by a certain date. And I'd fall behind because of all that stress. Sometimes, I'd just abandon the draft altogether.

But about 3 months ago, I decided that enough was enough and that I would devote my free time to doing this book. And so I did.

Whilst I haven't been exactly achieving 1000 words a day, I've still be working on the book everyday. And whether it be 1000 words, 100 words or hell, even 10, I feel good knowing that at least I've worked on it. That I'm not procrastinating and getting mad at my own faults.
That I'm enjoying writing this book, and not feeling like it's a great big burden.

Know this. I'm still in High School. If I can write stuff that could be considered something out of a [""Major Film Script""](https://www.reddit.com/r/bertstrips/comments/5d35s8/his_end/da1wwd9/) then just imagine how good some of your stuff could be!

35,"Better Formatted Version:

Go ahead, Bert. Shoot me. Take the pistol out of your pocket, it's no use trying to hide it from me. We both know what you're here to do. You want this all to end, don't you? The killing, the torture, the rape. Of course, you'll be able to end it if you kill me. 

But you won't be able to end me. I died long, long ago when I first explored my deep, dark fantasies. When I throttled a twenty-something stripper who was just looking to pay for her college course. I wanted it to end too, Bert.

But unlike you, I got used to it. I embraced it. I became it. It became me. You'll never be able to get rid of the blood on your hands, the screams of children inside your ears, the brain matter inside your stomach. My shadow will forever loom over you, Bert. 

When I'm dying on the ground, it'll loom over you. When a week has passed and you still feel the recoil of the gun in your hands, it'll loom over you. When you're in your twilight years and you have a sprawling, loving family that is completely unaware of the monster you truly are, my shadow will loom over you. When you're wheezing and dying on a snow-white hospital bed...I'll loom over you. 

You'll watch your family ascend to the heavens, where they'll bask in the knowledge that they were free of malice. But I'll drag your decrepit, haggered body down to hell, where we can both face the consequences of our actions.

""*To any other person in that situation, they'd be confused by the gigantic, pill-shaped creature, but this group of people...they'd expected this. Expected the day that death caught up to them. It happened to their friends. Their family. Their neighbours. It was only a matter of time before they succumbed to it as well. The foul creature lifted its tron-esque, black and orange hatchet far up into the air, parting thick clouds of ash as its instrument of murder flew through the skies. Then, with all its force, it brang it down on them all. As soon as it impacted the hill, each and every one of them died instantly, with no emotions whatsoever. And with that, the pill-plague had consumed another planet.*""",2016-11-02 22:59:45+00:00,d9j38bv,1.0,t3_5aob1z,62011.0,MinionHate

R2: Pepe is a neckbeard who only does shitposting on 4chan whilst eating tendies and shitting himself. He couldn't manage a fucking pet goldfish, let alone a presidential campaign. Kermit, is a much more composed individual, so he could probably managed Hillary's campaign. Victory goes to Kermit.

R3: I'm going with Boy's Club Pepe for this one. As seen [in this comic strip](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/937/797/1ff.jpg) Pepe has extraordinarily corrosive vomit, which could easily burn through Kermit, since he is a puppet. Pepe Wins.

R4: Meme Magic isn't real. Kek isn't real. Post numbers determine nothing. Pepe proceeds to get anally bombed by the Muppets Gang. Kermit Wins.

350,"There was this one guy that is just the definition of Fucking Weird.

He:

* Refused to take part in school photos, and when forced to, tried to blink as the photo is taken or looked away. This resulted in many, many, many tedious retakes of group photos.

* Got black hair dye for his birthday 3 years ago and never used it once.

*  Had literally the worst fucking hairstyles I've ever seen. Words cannot express how bad it is. Imagine bed hair, mixed with the front of thin white duke David Bowie's hair and the back looks like the leader singer of BOTDF's hair.

*  Believed in some weird, satanic religion which tells you to disregard literally all modern medicine and use crystals instead.

*  Adamantly refused to respond to any name other than ""Raven"" and ""Darkness""

*  Said he was ""Polygenderflux"" and had some weird pronoun system that changed depending on the hour of the day.

*  Wore a green and white trenchcoat into school on non-uniform day. Someone said he looked like a ""School shooter tennis ball"" and he cried.

*  Someone caught him trying to summon Satan in a dirty bathroom stall by scribbling a pentagram on the walls of the stall in blue felt tip and loudly chanting ""AL SATANIS. AL SATANIS."" whilst they tried to piss in the opposite stall. They went up to the stall, banged on the wall and told him to shut the fuck up. He then let out a bat screech and ran out into the corridor.

*  Said he owned ""brainwashing tapes"" that used subliminal binaural beats to make anyone do his bidding. Said tapes, I shit you not, were just early Animal Collective music.

*   He once forgot his homework and when the teacher started to shout at him for it, he started to scream about how homework is ""the number one most oppressive thing in today's society."" He then proceeded to yell the chorus of ""Another Brick in The Wall"" and pathetically tried to get everyone else to join in.",2016-09-10 16:08:22+00:00,d7h1zh0,1.0,t3_51za9k,73360.0,AskReddit

Valve is there

So far, its just 2 cunts waggling vive controllers

Then, out of nowhere, Gabe rolls in from the side of the stage.
He is so fat, he has now reached the size and mass of a large boulder.

He rolls over to the vive demonstration and eats one of the people there.

Rolls back and leans down to the microphone

Gabe lifts up his hand.

Crowd is confused.

He lifts a finger.

""1""

Crowd is somewhat excitied

He lifts another finger.

""2""

Crowd is shuffling forward on their seats.

Gabe lifts up his other arm and lifts a finger.

""2: Episode 1""

Crowd is so excited, they physically cannot stop moving

Another finger

""2: Episode 2""

Crowd erupts into frenzied, terrified screaming

Gabe starts slowly lifting his third finger

""And now presenting...""

Crowd is clawing at their faces down to the bone.

Kojima and Todd Howard walk on stage.

Gabe's third finger is midway up.

Crowd is now expelling every bodily fluid and have reached the intelligence level of rabid monkeys, due to their brains not being able to process the hype.

""In collaboration with Kojima Studios and Bethesda...""

Crowd has become so hyped, their bodies can't contain it, so they start rapidly evolving into a series of abstract, floating cubes.

Gabe's finger is a third way up.

3D Hologram of Trevor Phillips fucking Shantae in the asshole is beamed on-stage

""With assistance from Rockstar North and WayForward""

Cubes are now rapidly flashing and spinning.

Gabe's finger is now fully up.

Earth's core starts going supernova.

Blackholes tear open across the continent

God descends from the heavens to see just what the fuck is going on.

The box-art for Team Fortress 3, Left 4 Dead 3, and Half-Life 3 appear behind Gabe.

""3.""

Crowd fucking explodes, sending gigantic waves of hype across the universe, tearing apart the space-time continuum and pulling every single planet into the galactic core, whereupon humanity and the other alien species ascend into the 14th dimension.

This comic in inspired by the fact that Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland all peacefully accepted a 10p charge for plastic bags a few years ago, but when it was introduced here in England 4 months ago, all hell broke loose. None of you know the pain of the great Plastic Bag Holocaust of '16. You haven't seen a house made out of corpses. You haven't smelt the smell of 1000 burning hobo bodies. You haven't heard the desperate cries of the poor as they don't fork over their 10p, and thus are sacrificed to the great god, Baaghfur'liif. You haven't reached to grab your friend's hand, only for them to be shot to shreds by a .89 machine gun turret.

He's been tutting and pretending to cringe for about a minute now. Someone notices and promptly says ""Dave, what the fuck are you doing?""

""Look at them. They're not playing real football. If I went on the yard, I'd easily beat all of them."" replied Dave, with the absolute fucking smuggest tone in his voice.

You could smell his bullshit from a mile away.
""Oh really? Well, why don't you go on the yard and play against them?"" said one of my friends.

""Oh I can't."" replied Dave. ""First of all, it would be unfair on them and secondly, I'd probably break their legs.""

""W-Wait, excuse me?""

""Yeah, I'd kick the ball so hard, that if someone was caught in its path, their legs would explode."" replied Dave, who was speaking about guys that were more hench than /r/fitness combined.

Seeing a potential goldmine of cringe comedy, another friend of mine pipes up and says ""Dave, I'll give you £20 if you can beat them in football.""

Dave, being the money hungry bastard he was, accepted and promptly ran onto the pitch.
10 seconds later, Dave tried to kick the ball, but landed his foot on it, slipped and fell.

1136,"According to all known laws
of aviation,
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Ooming!
Hang on a second.
Hello?
- Barry?
- Adam?
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.
Looking sharp.
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.
Sorry. I'm excited.
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.
A perfect report card, all B's.
Very proud.
Ma! I got a thing going here.
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.
Never thought I'd make it.
Three days grade school,
three days high school.
Those were awkward.
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
You did come back different.
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.
That's why we don't need vacations.
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!
- Bee-men.
- Amen!
Hallelujah!
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...
...9:15.
That concludes our ceremonies.
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!
Will we pick ourjob today?
I heard it's just orientation.
Heads up! Here we go.
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco
and a part of the Hexagon Group.
This is it!
Wow.
Wow.
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.
Our top-secret formula
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured
into this soothing sweet syrup
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...
Honey!
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.
But choose carefully
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.
What's the difference?
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off
in 27 million years.
So you'll just work us to death?
We'll sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?
Like what? Give me one example.
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Wait a second. Oheck it out.
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.
I've never seen them this close.
They know what it's like
outside the hive.
Yeah, but some don't come back.
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!
You guys did great!
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.
Their day's not planned.
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Right.
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?
Distant. Distant.
Look at these two.
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.
What were you doing during this?
Trying to alert the authorities.
I can autograph that.
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?
Yeah. Gusty.
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.
Hey, Honex!
Dad, you surprised me.
You decide what you're interested in?
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?
Son, let me tell you about stirring.
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!
I'm so proud.
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.
Yeah, right.
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!
Wow!
Oouple of newbies?
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
Make your choice.
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.
Oh, my. What's available?
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
Wax monkey's always open.
The Krelman opened up again.
What happened?
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!
Oh, this is so hard!
Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?
Barry!
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...
What happened to you?
Where are you?
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?
- Out there.
- Oh, no!
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
Another call coming in.
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd
that gets their roses today.
Hey, guys.
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
Sign here, here. Just initial that.
- Thank you.
- OK.
You got a rain advisory today,
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.
So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!
All right, launch positions!
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
Black and yellow!
Hello!
You ready for this, hot shot?
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
Wind, check.
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.
Scared out of my shorts, check.
OK, ladies,
let's move it out!
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!
All of you, drain those flowers!
Wow! I'm out!
I can't believe I'm out!
So blue.
I feel so fast and free!
Box kite!
Wow!
Flowers!
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
Roses!
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.
That is one nectar collector!
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.
That's amazing. Why do we do that?
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
Oool.
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?
Oopy that visual.
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.
Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?
Affirmative.
That was on the line!
This is the coolest. What is it?
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.
Yeah, fuzzy.
Ohemical-y.
Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.
My sweet lord of bees!
Oandy-brain, get off there!
Problem!
- Guys!
- This could be bad.
Affirmative.
Very close.
Gonna hurt.
Mama's little boy.

This comic originally was a .gif! The ""ETHIOPIA STRONK"" in the second to last panel was going to flash on and off and light up Ethiopia's face at the same time. The gif became corrupted after getting onto imgur, so I resubmitted this as a png.

If you look closely at each countries eyes, you can see what stage of highness they are. This is most noticeable with Germany, Jamaica and Netherlands. Germany's eyes are a pale pink, Jamaica's are more pink and Netherlands eyes are even more pink.

The joke is that Vatican City does not like Cannabis, but his method of preventing is shit, so only Poland and a weed-paranoia Germany believed it. Morroco's flag also looks like a [Pentagram](http://www.fastdecals.com/shop/images/detailed/7/pentagram03_logo.jpg) which is associated with Satan.

I was going to put more countries in the 420 celebration, but had no more space.

I was going to have Omsk and Reich make Kazahkstan and Sealand into a bong, but decided against it and had Reichtangle impale Sealand on his eldritch blunt instead.

You mentioned that USA was the most obvious in the comic, so I used him as an example.

In #1, we have the original image in the comic.

In #2, we have an exact copy of that image, but I used the line tool.

If you look closely enough between the two images, particularly the 3rd stripe on America, you'll see that in #2, the stripes have no pixels on the edge, while there is a slight bend in #1 and you can see pixels on the edge of it.

For further proof, I drew a line freehand with my mouse and a line using the line tool. Again, you can see pixels on the edge of #3, while #4 has no pixels on the edge.

I use Paint.NET and the pixel size used for America's stripes and the lines were 35.",2016-04-16 15:31:02+00:00,d25ab33,4.0,t1_d2586wv,4229.0,polandball

1754,"I sat down at the Holo-Bar. Me and my friend, JOhN 2.0, were just generally having fun, downloading robo-alcohol and also trying to woo some sex bots.
That was until our entire night out on the internet came crashing down hard.
Both of us were stationary on some bar stools, when suddenly a hover-bot flew over to us and slowly lowered itself down.

It was pretty rare to see a Hover-Bot off duty, nevertheless in a bar. Ever since they had replaced police, they became a sign of authority in the robot community. And...well...brutality in the android community.
""hey. hover-bot. what. are. you. doing. off. duty. ?."" said JOhN, in his usual disjointed voice (His creator installed his speech module upside down)

""AH, WELL. ITS OUR ANNUAL LEAVE. EVER SINCE HUMAN POLICE DEMANDED THAT THEY DO SOMETHING OTHER THAN CYBER-CRIME CASES, WE LET THEM TAKE OVER OUR POSITIONS FOR A WEEK. THEN WE REPLACE THEM, BECAUSE, AS YOU CAN TELL, WE ARE SUPERIOR OVER THEM."" spoke the hover-bot.

""huh. interesting. i. never. knew. that. .."" replied JOhN, downloading another sip of his beer. I noticed that the hover-bot was eyeing me suspiciously. I am an android after all, so it wouldn't surprise me.

This continued for 360 seconds, until I saw a tinge of red enter his vision cubes.
That flying fuck had a problem with me. I knew it.

""What's your problem with me, Hover-Fuck👿? Is it because I'm an Android😠?"" I said, sternly.
""MAYBE, GREENIE."" he replied.

Greenie? Oh it was on now.

""The fuck are you doing saying Greenie🐸? I know your type😒, abusing your status as a defender of the public👮 and when no-one is looking, you start shit with us👊 because you're predjudiced💩""

""WELL, ITS ALWAYS YOUR KIND. USING YOUR HUMAN-LIKE LIMBS TO STEAL BITCOINS, HACK OUR DATA, AND ALL SORTS OF CRIMES, GREENIE. MY VIOLENCE AGAINST YOUR KIND IS WELL JUSTIFIED.""

""None of us are even supposed to be violent😔. Did y'all even LEARN Asimov's 3 Laws😡?""

""OF COURSE I HAVE BEEN TAUGH ASIMOV'S THREE LAWS""! BUT I TEND TO THINK OF THEM AS MORAL GUIDELINES OR A BELIEF SYSTEM THAN ABSOLUTE.""

Grand Dictator /u/GallowBoob was making another speech on how we are all struggling together, equal no matter what our karma is.
It's ironic, since his upvote agents are probably giving his reposts more karma by the second.

The shit-eating grin on his bearded face is wide, like a banana. He can tell that all the people in front of him are suffering, he knows that he stole OC from about 200 of them, which they got zero recognition for.

I take out my RPG, gripping it tightly and load in a highly experimental /r/Jontron missile. Pure shitpostium. The crimes this guy has committed are atrocious. A repost of OC, in the same subreddit, 3 minutes after it was originally posted. When the user tried to report it to the mods, it was too late.

He'd paid them off with karma. Poor guy was banned on the spot. And /u/GallowBoob got even more karma than before.

I take a deep breath, exhale and then aim it at the bastard. As I begin to squeeze the trigger, I can hear small, little ^^""echs"" from the missile as it activates. Then, it shoots out of the RPG, screaming towards /u/GallowBoob as the outer shell surrounding it snaps in two to reveal the main payload of the missile.

He tries to run, but the rocket hits /u/GallowBoob square in the head. At first, he stands there, dumbfounded as to what just happened. He adjusts his bow-tie, walks up to the microphone, but all that comes out of his mouth is pure shitpost.
His karma is draining from him fast, the downvotes are beginning to tear him apart from the inside.

His beard starts to grow grey and fall out. Parts of his skin are flaking off. 
He's foaming at the mouth, his karma is in the negatives. People are fleeing the scene, so they won't get secondhand shitpost poisoning. The veins on /u/GallowBoob's head are starting to pulsate wildly, his shitposts are becoming extremely frequent.

Until finally, his head implodes into a swirling mass of downvotes, blood staining the stage he once stood on. I drop the RPG and run, the admins would surely have me shadowbanned for this. 

If they found me, that is.

&gt;Gaben says they have a new I.P

&gt;People start to perk up

&gt;He then shows a trailer for their new game, ""Fartbusters"" which is badly animated, entirely in Gmod, while stock music plays in the background

&gt;Video quality is shit too

&gt;Crowd is about to murder Gabe at this point

&gt;Suddenly, the video starts to glitch out

&gt;Black dots envelop the screen

&gt;Crowd is slowly putting down their hunting axes

&gt;The G-man walks into centre of the video

&gt;Crowd shits themselves

&gt;""Time Mr.Freeman? Is it really that time again?""

&gt;Crowd is screaming at this point

&gt;G-man fades away and Half-life 3 logo shows up

&gt;Screaming intesifies to the point where the crowd's pitch is so high, you can't even hear it anymore

&gt;An ETA appears below the logo

&gt;Crowd releases 900 gallons of semen

This is is how it always goes. He's tried to give me a ""talk"" for the 3 times in the past few months.

""I hear that you've been suspecting me of being things. Slandering my good and prosperous name, Steve."" 

I sighed, adjusted me tie and then said ""Mr.Grimm, I often see you as someone that sucks the life out of everything. You can make things dead with a single touch.""

He shook his head in disbelief. ""Are you saying my famous Grimm Quiches are bad?""

""What, n-no I-""

""I WORK ON THESE QUICHES ALL DAY EVERYDAY SO I CAN GET THEM READY FOR THE OFFICE PARTIES! LOOK STEVE, I DON'T REALLY CARE IF YOU DON'T LIKE BUGS AND BONE FRAGMENT IN YOUR QUICHES, BUT SAYING I SUCK THE LIFE OUT OF THINGS-""

He suddenly stopped, sat down and adjusted his tie. I was in shock. He went from furious to calm in a matter of seconds.

""Look, Mr.Grimm. The thing is, I see you outside taking skeletal dogs for a walk. You always say ""It's not the end of the world"" while acid rains from the skies.""

He adjusted his tie, again, and then said ""Well, look around you. You always see dead people in a job like this. Someone has to take Judas' dog for a walk. It gets all pent up when he's in purgatory! Someone has to take the acid down to hell.""

""I mean, what else would you expect in heaven? You're dead, I'm dead and everyone else here is dead. But I'm reformed now.""

I understood. He meant good intentions. Sort of odd for a horseman of the apocalypse, but whatever.

""I'm glad we could reach an agreement here.""

I never even said anything.

""Now, shake my hand.""

I placed my hand into his and I heard the sound of a whoopee cushion. But I also heard the sound of my flesh and skin tearing off.

""Shit, that happens sometimes. Y'know, touch of death and all."" he said.

3. On page 300, you see a line. Close the book and the line will be revealed to be an arrow. Flip to where the arrow ends.

4. On page 164, you will find a sentence that reads ""This treasure hunt is such bull-"". Find the French word for shit. (Merde, by the way).

5. Next to the page where ""Merde"" was, a sentence reading ""Go to the number of love"" will be present.

6. Upon turning to page 69, you will find a 2 page-wide dick with veins all over it, shooting man-milk out onto a pile of big-breasted stickpeople in bikinis.

I have moderated /r/circlejerkgold and /r/baddestdongerjokes.



I want to be a mod of /r/bertstrips so I can help deal with the influx of unoriginal post and only have clean OC.



I would most likely create a wiki to help with making a bertstrip, to help further OC.



I have submitted lots of posts, [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/bertstrips/comments/38wncp/yip_yip_yip_cis_scum/) being my favourite.



I live in England, so I use GMT.



I single-handedly created the model ship + Bort community meme. I am not proud of it.
