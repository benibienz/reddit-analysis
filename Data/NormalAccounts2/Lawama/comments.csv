2863,"Exactly why she played smarter.

She has been in the major alliance from the beginning and stayed under the radar.

Once the numbers started to dwindle, her and Corey started pulling out comp wins.

When they were going to get targeted, like during Nat's HOH, they steered the target toward the sitting ducks and held all the power of who goes home.

Then when Nicole won HOH, she got out the threat that openly said she's coming after her, Michelle. They also made a f4 deal to keep them safe incase Paul or Vic won HOH next week.

When Victor won HOH, Nicorey already had the f4 deal with the sitting ducks and the target was Jatalie. They held all the power in who goes home again.

Then when Corey won HOH, they took the first shot at the sitting ducks.

She most definitely played the smarter game. Paul has been making up for his strategic flaws week after week. 

**EDIT** - Oh and she's only been nominated once at f4 and has made herself seem like a non-threat that Paul wants to take her to f2 when the jurors are acknowledging what an amazing game she's played. 

Hopefully she brings up all these great points to the jurors instead of having a horrible f2 speech. ",2016-09-18 00:58:56+00:00,d7r7m3n,3.0,t1_d7r7dr8,393.0,BigBrother

2889,"Zakiyah and Paulie had a bunch of problems in the BB house. The one right before Day left is the Paris room fight, where Zakiyah went to confide to Day as a friend again so she can get advice. Day gave her that advice, which was to worry about what she ultimately came to BB for, the 500k prize.

Day was evicted and during her Julie interview she was crying for Zakiyah, she said she loves her like a sister.

When Zakiyah was evicted right after, Day again broke down when Zak came to Jury.

When Paulie came to Jury, Da'vonne told him that he had her vote until he did Zakiyah wrong in the game, one example is by not using the veto on her. Zakiyah then went on to curse him out and the segment ended with her saying, ""I did not come here for a boy.""

Then when Michelle was evicted, Day said that Zakiyah and Paulie were back together and that her and Bridgette basically don't exist to her anymore.

Day was obviously hurt because she cares about Zakiyah very much, and if you've ever had a friend that keeps going back to an asshole again and again, you know how that feels. Day also knew that Zakiyah looks pathetic to the public by continuously going back to Paulie, and that made her upset. She pointed it out in the Jury segment when she said Paulie is embarrassing Zakiyah on national TV. 

Paulie wanted to call out Day, who has had Zakiyahs back the entire time, when he did not, for not talking to Zak and being upset. 

All the pent up frustration was released, and when he brought up her daughter, she lost it.

My point. She's still just as bitter about Nicole as she was in the house. So based on what we can see, she's not voting for Nicole.

No but she did say she doesn't want Nicole to win while she was in the house. She never said that about Paul.",2016-09-15 18:59:34+00:00,d7o6rxg,6.0,t1_d7o6bdv,544.0,BigBrother

Da'vonne had Zakiyahs back in the house. After that fight in the paris room Da'vonne comforted her and told her to ignore Paulie and play the game she came here for.

When Da'vonne was evicted, she cried for Zakiyah.

When Zakiyah was evicted and sent to Jury, Da'vonne cried again.

When she saw he didn't use the veto on her, her reaction was that well-known gif.

When Paulie was evicted she defended Zakiyah and told him why he lost her vote, cause he did Zakiyah wrong and didn't use the veto on her.

And then after all that to see her go back to this guy, the guy she called a bitch multiple times on TV. The jury segment ending with Zak saying, ""I didn't come here for no boy."" Da'vonne even said it herself, Paulie is making Zakiyah look like a joke on national TV.

That's why I think Da'vonne is so hurt by Zakiyah. Like it kills her inside to see Zakiyah be played cause she cares for her so much and she takes it out on Paulie.

But Da'vonne should just let it go.

He is the one who started kneeling in while she told him to shut up and play the tape to avoid the situation that happened.

And ah yes, he's so classy to degrade her as a mother by bringing up her daughter. A class act really.

No it doesn't equate the Torah (not the Tanakh) with the Talmud. It says right there:

&gt; Say: ""Who then sent down the Book which Moses brought?

What book was sent down to Moses? The Torah. The Torah is what they made into separate sheets and concealed it's contents. 

It's also really clear you haven't read the Qur'an because you think the Qur'an references the Talmud and the entirety of the Tanakh when it does not, and that it references the entirety of the Bible when it does not. The Qur'an only references the Torah, what Jews consider the first five books of the Tanakh given to Moses, and the Gospel inspired to Jesus.

&gt;1. If time of prayer enters, but a person didn’t pray, he will be killed

&gt;2. If one says; I will pray with no wudu (ritual ablution), he has to be killed

&gt;3. If one says; I will pray not towards qibla (facing the right direction), he will be killed

&gt;4. One will be killed if he leaves any of the agreed upon fards (compulsory acts)

&gt;5. One will be killed if he leaves the prayer

&gt;6. One will be killed by tightening the second and fourth 

&gt;7. One will be killed by the tightening the first too

&gt;8. One will be killed by leaving one or three prayers (there are two narrations).

4851,"He converted to Messianic Judaism after making tens of videos explaining how the Bible is corrupt, that Jesus didn't die etc.

Under his new Facebook page it seems (and I don't want to undermine the reasons for his apostasty) that he was somehow convinced that ISIS are following true Islam. It left him with the option of accepting ISIS is Islam, or leaving Islam, and he chose the latter.

He is now posting Answering-Islam apologia as well as Trinity Channel preachers. He's also started to post Islamophobic comments. I think he is going through a crisis of faith right now and I don't blame him. I mean it's pretty illogical after all the research he has done regarding the Bible to return to it, removing all his YouTube videos about the matter won't change that but I still somehow understand him, or well I think I do.

He thought ISIS was Islam, and he couldn't accept being that type of person so he left. He then rebounded back to the things he spent years explaining it's illogicality. 

This video made me really sad, much more than I should have been but insha'Allah he finds what he's looking for. Insha'Allah God doesn't let him go astray after what was in my opinion genuine sincerity to Islam.

&gt;**وَإِذْ قَالَ اللَّهُ يَا عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ أَأَنْتَ قُلْتَ لِلنَّاسِ اتَّخِذُونِي وَأُمِّيَ إِلَٰهَيْنِ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ**

The word Gods in this verse is **إِلَٰهَيْنِ**.

By /u/AnotherParaclete:

&gt;The word is *ilah*, not God. *Ilah* is an object to whom you direct acts of worship. By the definition of worship in Islam, Jesus and Mary are both beings to whom acts of worship have been directed. Just like the pagans of Mecca did not call their idols ""gods"" but rather intercessors to God and yet the Qur'an (and the pagans) referred to this as *ilah*.

&gt;Any entity that has an act of worship directed to it is an *ilah*. It does not matter whether the person calls it an act of worship or not. So long as it is an act of worship and they direct it to an entity, that entity is an *ilah*. If I believe a rabbit foot will give me special luck, I have made the rabbit foot an *ilah*.

&gt;By definition, Mary is an *ilah*. This is not up for dispute. It does not matter what you think. It does not matter what Christians think. There is a standard that we apply and it fits so the word is correct. Mary is an *ilah* for Christians, particularly Catholics.

&gt;*Furthermore, how will you endure [the Romanists'] terrible idolatries? It was not enough that they venerated the saints and praised God in them,* ***but they actually made them into gods. They put that noble child, the mother Mary, right into the place of Christ***. *They fashioned Christ into a judge and thus devised a tyrant for anguished consciences, so that all comfort and confidence was transferred from Christ to Mary, and then everyone turned from Christ to his particular saint. Can anyone deny this? Is it not true?""* [Martin Luther]

&gt;I'm pretty much the last person to say that muslims are rapist homophobes

I feel like some Muslims are unfortunately homophobic. They just don't understand LGBT. No Muslim would want to say they're lesbian or gay to their parents. If they have mannerisms that are not typical for their sex, alot of Muslims become uneasy. They get picked on and treated unfairly when they're not doing anything Islamically wrong. Being gay is not a sin, having innate mannerisms of the opposite sex is not a sin. Unfortunately some Muslims don't compute that and are just plain mean and rude and treat them like scum. They want people to accept them and stop being Islamophobic when they're homophobic. 

Some Muslims say being gay is a mental illness. Okay then why don't you treat them with compassion mercy like you would with a mentally ill person? Why are you instead cruel and wrathful to them? By the way I don't think being gay is a mental illness, I'm speaking about the Muslims that do.

Anyways this is my subjective view though. If my son was gay and was treated how many Muslims treat gay people, I would hate them too.

4925,"Well I only know basic Arabic but before knowing any, I would listen with a translation. It sounded very nice and calming and I liked what the translation was saying.

But now that I know a bit of Arabic, it's really different. It's has so much more ""umph"" to me now. It's really hard to put into words what I mean. 

For example these verses from Surah Qamar:

&gt;Samood rejected the warning. So they said: What! a single mortal from among us! Shall we follow him? Most surely we shall in that case be in sure error and distress: Has the reminder been made to light upon him from among us? Nay! he is an insolent liar! Tomorrow shall they know who is the liar, the insolent one.

Now knowing the Arabic makes it sound so much more dramatic and surreal. Like you can feel the emotion and power behind the verse that you just don't get from not knowing the Arabic and only using a translation. 

Here is how the verses quoted sound:

4929,"&gt;What (I assume) he wanted to say was that the Ahadith and Al-Sira have Muhammad's own words on how to ""deal"" with homosexuals (it's always execution)

Not how to deal with homosexuals, how to deal with sodomy witnessed by 4 people. The same punishment is given to an adulterer with four people witnessing to the act and given a proper trial in a court of law.

The punishments are deterrents and the criteria for punishment is almost impossible to fulfill for that reason. Four people cannot just simply see a man and a women naked in a bed together, all four of them must see the penis inside the vagina or it doesn't count. 

During the Ottoman Caliphate which lasted 600+ years only **1** stoning occured.

No that's totally incorrect. Someone being crucified in Jesus' place is only conjecture and assumptions made by Qur'an commentators. The Qur'an does not say he was replaced by someone else.

1. Because he's ignorant plenty of Muslims are white or look white

2. Scarlett Johansson was cast to play an Asian Character in Ghost of the Shell recently. They even hired the same special effects team from Benjamin Button to make Scarlett look Asian. 

Funny thing is they interviewed what Japanese people thought about Scarlett playing the Asian Character and most of them loved the idea.

She did not file a police report and instead had her team send Johnnys team all the info regarding the divorce and DV beforehand to keep it out of the media and private. 

Johnnys team notified the media, painting Amber in a bad light saying the police found nothing etc etc (what would they find when she sent them away and didn't file a report or request an investigation, in an effort to keep matters away from the public and private between her and Johnny). Amber didn't want the police to know in the first place, but since leaking the info to the media, she had no choice but to file a police report and also requested a complete investigation to be done so they can stop tarnishing her in the public.

She also has video and audio evidence which I'm sure will come out soon. 

Ambers lawyers statement:

&gt;As the result of Amber’s decision to decline giving an initial statement to the LAPD, her silence has been used against her by Johnny’s team. Amber did not provide a statement to the LAPD in an attempt to protect her privacy and Johnny’s career. Johnny’s team has forced Amber to give a statement to the LAPD to set the record straight as to the true facts, as she cannot continue to leave herself open to the vicious false and malicious allegations that have infected the media. Amber has suffered through years of physical and psychological abuse at the hands of Johnny.

&gt;With her statement Amber hopes to give the LAPD the opportunity to conduct an accurate and complete investigation into the events of that evening and before. If that occurs, and the truth is revealed, there is no doubt that Amber’s claims will be substantiated beyond any doubt, and hopefully Johnny will get the help that he so desperately needs.

&gt;From the beginning it has been Amber's desire to keep this matter as private as possible, even though LAPD officers responded to a 911 call made by a third-party. The LAPD officers viewed not only the disarray that Johnny had caused in the apartment but also the physical injuries to Amber’s face. We filed the Petition for Dissolution of Marriage at the very end of the day on Monday May 23rd and we did not serve Johnny with the Petition at the premiere of Alice Through the Looking Glass that evening. We sent a letter to Johnny's counsel team the next morning making it clear we wanted to keep this matter out of the media. We then held off requesting a domestic violence restraining order as we knew that Johnny was out of the country.

&gt;We took the high road. Unfortunately, Johnny's team immediately went to the press and began viciously attacking Amber’s character. Amber is simply a victim of domestic violence, and none of her actions are motivated by money. Amber is a brave and financially independent woman who is showing the courage of her convictions by doing the right thing against Johnny's relentless army of lawyers and surrogates.",2016-06-02 05:11:08+00:00,d3sqxvm,8.0,t1_d3sns4c,6375.0,TwoXChromosomes

Here's the catch, 9.4 million people will switch out of Islam while 106.1 million people will switch out of Christianity.

This would give Islam a net conversion rate of +3.2 million people, while Christianities net conversion rate is -66 million people.

So based on net conversions, Islam is still growing faster than Christianity.

5122,"**Part 2:**

So, the above has been a lot of the ""seeing the leaves"" point of view. What about ""looking at the forest?"" Going back to what I first said, Shar'iah means path to water. It means doing what God wants from us. But these laws I've listed are very specific. Not committing adultery, not stealing, etc. Looking at it from a bird's eye view, what does God want?
 
Classical legal scholars distilled all of Shar'iah down to a single statement which translates to ""Preserving that which is beneficial and prohibiting that which is harmful."" So, you know how in the US constitution we say that the inherent rights given to us are **life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness**?"" Well, the Shar'iah equivalent is called the **maqasid** or the objectives of the Shar'iah. These are:
 
1. Protection of Faith
2. Protection of Life
3. Protection of Family (lineage/progeny)
4. Protection of Intellect
5. Protection of Wealth
 
The approach has been commonly associated with Juwayni and his student Ghazali as well as the famous Ibn Taymiyyah and the Andalusian al-Shatibi.
 
Basically, any shar'iah law can fall into one of these categories. Prohibition against adultery? Number 3. Freedom of religion: Number 1. Prohibition against murder? Number 2. In modern times, someone could argue that a national health system free of charge is a responsibility of the state due to Maqasid #2. Sure, you can't bring forth a hadith to say that a national health system is a responsibility of the state, but the maqasid approach would say ""Look, we can see from all the rulings in the Shar'iah that one of it's goals is to protect life. In our day and age, denying medical care due to lack of money is going against the protection of life. Therefore, it is the right of the people to have their health care paid for.""
 
Now, be careful. This approach still has to be grounded in the four sources I gave before. It really requires an advanced legal scholar to utilize but it's the direction that the field is currently moving in.
 
Anyway, with that block of text, let me leave you with two books that (although a big heavy), give a good overview of Shar'iah in case you want to read more.

5123,"&gt;What exactly is Sharia law? It permeates the news a lot and I've been wanting to ask what exactly it is.

**By /u/AnotherParaclete Part 1:**

Shar'iah literally means ""path to water."" Knowing the linguistic meaning of the word is very important because it sets the backdrop for how Muslims view Shar'iah. Remember, Islam first developed in a desert environment. Your life literally revolved around knowing where the water was located. And so the word Shar'iah invokes the image of being *the* path to life. For non-Muslims, the word ""Shari'ah"" conjures up images of amputated hands and stoned adulterers and beheadings. For a Muslim, the word ""Shari'ah"" conjures up images of social justice, economic equity, and yes, freedom. A fantastic article by Noah Feldman of Harvard in the NYTimes titled, [*Why Shari'ah?](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/magazine/16Shariah-t.html?pagewanted=al) explores this divide.
 
Now that's pretty abstract, let's talk concrete, what does Shar'iah *really* mean? It refers to the entire body of what God wants from a person. In other words, it is the set of ethics and laws (path) to God's mercy (water). So when a Muslim uses the word Shar'iah, they mean everything that a person is supposed to do/believe. This includes theology, acts of worship, business transactions, and national laws. So let's break this down into percentages.
 
The bulk of Shar'iah, say 70% deals with rituals and acts of worship. So Shar'iah tells Muslims how many times a day they should pray (5) and and what times. It tells them to give 2.5% of their savings in obligatory charity every year. It tells them to fast during the lunar mont of Ramadan. It tells them to honor the sacrifice of Abraham by doing the hajj at least once in their life.
 
Now, about 25% of Shar'iah deals with what I would call personal law. This is somewhere in between religious and secular law. In that, it deals with things that are not purely religious, but places religious conditions on them. So, for example, marriage. What constitutes a marriage in Islam? (Interesting tidbit you can surprise your Muslim friends with. In Arabic, the past tense is used for certainty, so marriage vows have to be done in the past tense. Present tense vows are not valid. In other words, they must say ""Have you taken this person to be your lawfully wedded wife?"" And the guy says ""I have done so""  instead of ""I do."" There's a dispute amongst legal scholars if that condition is necessary when done in a different language.)
Under this 25% comes food laws. You've heard, I'm sure, that Muslimsm don't eat pork. That comes in here. Same with alcohol. And then what about things which are made *from* alcohol but are not alcoholic? For example, vinegar (spoiler: it's allowed). Under this 25% also comes a strict prohibition on interest. A lot of the early Muslims were merchants so there's a *lot* of laws in regards to business transactions and what is allowed and what is not.
 
Finally, in the last 5%, the biggie that everyone's probably thinking about, those laws intended for application at a national level. It's funny because while this is the first thing that comes to non-Muslims mind when someone says Shar'iah, it's one of the last thing that comes to a Muslim's mind. Even in Islamic states that have ruled by the Shar'iah (I would argue, as would the vast majority of Muslims, that such a state has not existed since 1914 and even that wasn't full Shar'iah), this 5% is not usually very relevant to most people. But this is where you get the cutting off the hand of a thief, stoning an adulterer (contrary to popular belief, the punishment and evidenciary standard is equivalent for male and female adulterers), and executing an apostate. Now this usually interests most people, so let me go more into detail about it.
 
First of all, realize that Shar'iah is not codified. There have been attempts (the Ottomans and the Mughals come to mind) but none have been very successful. So interpretations on this five percent will vary. However, I think people go to two extremes here. You have one group of people who think shar'iah is monolithic and thus what one person says speaks for everyone. Then you have another set who say that Muslims have so many differing opinions that to ask ""what is shar'iah?"" is meaningless since there's no central authority. Neither is quite right. To understand this, I need to take a step back and explain *how* we get Shar'iah.
 
The basis of the Shar'iah are two main and two ""secondary"" things. I put secondary in quotes because really, these four are considered the primary sources of Shar'iah and everything else is secondary/ancillary. So, in order (sorta, let me explain):
 
1. The Qur'an- hopefully this is obvious, this is the holiest book in Islam
2. The Sunnah- the practice of the Prophet. In other words, how he implemented the Qur'an. You might find some sources list this as ""hadith"" but there's a bit of a nuance here that becomes important at higher levels of study. A hadith is defined as a statement of the Prophet, an action of the Prophet which someone recorded, or a tacit approval (he saw something and did not object to it). I don't want to bore you with details, but suffice it to say that in two legal schools, a hadith can state something but is not accepted as evidence because something else qualified as Sunnah. I can explain more in replies if anyone is interested.
3. 'Ijma- this is a consensus. Meaning, if all the Muslim legal scholars in a certain time and place come to an agreement on something, it becomes law. The idea behind this is that it's unthinkable that *everyone* could misunderstand what God meant.
4. Qiyas- analogical deduction. This is where analogies are made to new situations. For example, technically, only *khamr* (defined as an alcoholic beverage made from grapes) is forbidden in the Qur'an. You could argue that beer is fine since it's not explicitly condemned. However, qiyas is applied and beer is equated to khamr and all alcoholic beverages are forbidden regardless of their origin.
 
Now, like I said, the above order is the ""official"" order but it is done more out of respect than actual importance. It has been stated (and I think I agree with this) that in reality, the most important source of Shar'iah historically has been Ijma, consensus. If you think about it, it makes sense. If everyone is agreeing on something, it almost certainly has strong foundations in both the Qur'an *and* the Sunnah and is abundantly clear. The second most important is probably the Sunnah not the Qur'an. This is because the Sunnah can restrict the meaning of the Qur'an but not vice versa. In other words, if the Qur'an states something and the Prophet's actions seem to contradict it, the Qur'an's meaning is re-evaluated in light of the Prophet's actions. This is why you have statements from classical legal scholars to the effect of ""The Sunnah rules over the Qur'an but the Qur'an does not rule over the Sunnah."" This shocks a lot of non-Muslims (and dare I say, some Muslims who don't know much about Shar'iah) but it's abundantly clear to anyone who studies this field. The third in importance is Qur'an and the fourth is Qiyas.
 
So, if someone wants to bring something and claim it is Shar'iah, they must have evidence from these four categories. If someone says ""it's my interpretation of the Shar'iah, I can interpret it how I like"" they would be laughed out of the building. You *must* provide evidence from these.
 
Now, going back to the 5%, let's look at them again. I'll take stoning as an example. Let's look at stoning. The evidentiary standard for stoning as found in Ijma and Sunnah (remember, these two are the most important) is extremely, extremely high. Four adult witnesses must see the male's penis penetrate into the vagina. Make sure you understand me, I'm not saying four people must see them committing adultery (side note: stoning is solely for adulterers, if the two are unmarried, stoning isn't the punishment). I'm saying four people must actually see the penetration occur. If four people walk into a room and see a man and a woman naked on the bed going at it but the angle is such that the penis isn't visible, it doesn't count. Needless to say, this makes it next to impossible for the standard to be met and I am not aware of any case in Islamic history where someone has been stoned by meeting this standard. The only other way for them to be stoned is to turn themselves in (which is emphatically discouraged in the sunnah). In the entire reign of the Ottoman caliphate, 1 stoning occurred.
 
You might ask, well then, what the heck is the purpose of a punishment when it can't be enforced? Two things. Most importantly, it serves as a deterrent. Realize that in the time period where Islam began, there was no police force or real law enforcement. People abstained from crimes based on a social contract and the fear of punishment. I'm sure as hell less likely to have a one night stand if there's even a 1% chance I'm going to get stoned (not in the marijuana sense). It also makes the seriousness of the crime more tangible. There's a difference between saying ""Don't commit adultery, you'll be punished in hell for a finite period of time. Unless you repent, because God forgives anyone who repents."" and ""Don't commit adultery, because if you get caught, you'll get stones pelted at you until you die."" Finally, these punishments (called hudood in Arabic) are setting the limits. If four people walked in on two people doing it, you can bet there would have been some punishment (called tazir punishments). Not stoning (since the standard can't be met) but perhaps a hefty fine or public humiliation.",2016-05-18 01:48:54+00:00,d39o1qt,1.0,t3_4ju6kg,2498.0,islam

It could have been Jesus on the cross but he could've still been alive when brought down, while the persecutors thought he was dead. It *could* have been a replacement. This is all conjecture. 

Point being is, the Qur'an does **not** say he was replaced. All it says is it appeared to the onlookers that Jesus was crucified and killed, but he was not.

5159,"Just adding by quoting the Qur'an.

Jesus sent to the Children of Israel:

&gt;*And We sent, following in their footsteps, Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming that which came before him in the Torah; and We gave him the Gospel, in which was guidance and light and confirming that which preceded it of the Torah as guidance and instruction for the righteous.*

&gt;*And [make him] a messenger to the Children of Israel, [who will say], 'Indeed I have come to you with a sign from your Lord in that I design for you from clay [that which is] like the form of a bird, then I breathe into it and it becomes a bird by permission of Allah. And I cure the blind and the leper, and I give life to the dead - by permission of Allah. And I inform you of what you eat and what you store in your houses. Indeed in that is a sign for you, if you are believers.*

Making permissible some of what was forbidden for the Children of Israel:

&gt;*And [I have come] confirming what was before me of the Torah and to make lawful for you some of what was forbidden to you. And I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear Allah and obey me. Indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is the straight path.""*

But the Jews were defiant and arrogant and wanted him killed:

&gt;*...And We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear proofs and supported him with the Holy Spirit. But is it [not] that every time a messenger came to you, [O Children of Israel], with what your souls did not desire, you were arrogant? And a party [of messengers] you denied and another party you killed.*

They disbelieved in Gods miracles given to Jesus as well slandering Mary although God gave Jesus the ability to speak as an infant to protect his mothers chastity:

&gt;*And because of their disbelief and of their speaking against Mary a tremendous calumny*

So the Children of Israel made a plan to get him killed, but God also had a plan:

&gt;*And they planned and Allah (also) planned, and Allah is the best of planners.*

The Jews boasted that they killed Jesus, but they themselves weren't sure about it, whatever happened, they were in continuous doubt about whether they had really killed Jesus:

&gt;*And [for] their saying, ""Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah."" And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but so it was made to appear to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain. Rather, Allah raised him to Himself. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise.*

God comforts Jesus and tells him he will save him and raise him, purify him against the blasphemers (the Children of Israel, presumably falsely alleging he claimed he was God to get him killed), make those who follow him in submission to God alone superior to the Children of Israel who disbelieved in him:

&gt;*Behold! Allah said: ""O Jesus! I will take you and raise you to Myself and clear you (of the falsehoods) of those who blaspheme; I will make those who follow you (in submission to Allah alone) superior to those who reject faith, to the Day of Resurrection: Then shall you all return unto me, and I will judge between you of the matters wherein ye dispute.*",2016-05-11 21:22:47+00:00,d31uwo9,9.0,t1_d31srvn,2735.0,islam

Kinda. I mean it will help if you're confused in certain parts. For example, in Chapter Mary (19th Chapter), after Mary gives birth to Jesus she returns to her family:

&gt;*Then she brought him to her people, carrying him. They said, ""O Mary, you have certainly done a thing unprecedented.* ***O sister of Aaron***, *your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste.""*

Christian apologists would say Muhammad got Mary the mother of Jesus, confused with Miriam the Sister of Aaron and Moses. A commentary would help clear these silly misconceptions up.

Lords Prayer:

Fatihah:

&gt;*In the name of God, the infinitely Compassionate and Merciful.
Praise be to God, Lord of all the worlds.
The Compassionate, the Merciful. Ruler on the Day of Reckoning.
You alone do we worship, and You alone do we ask for help.
Guide us on the straight path,
the path of those who have received your grace;
not the path of those who have brought down wrath, nor of those who wander astray.
Amen.*

Yet on the cross, whoever was on the cross, drank some wine.

&gt;A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus' lips. When he had received the drink, Jesus said, ""It is finished."" With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit. John 19:29-30

This is called dua, or supplication. It is different from the five obligatory prayers which are called salat. But yes it counts as a prayer. 

&gt;In the previous scenario, praying for the wellbeing of a loved one, do you think it matters if the prayer is made by a muslim? or for a muslim?

I'm not sure about this, but I assume not. Allah (swt) can answer the prayers of anyone who calls on him. I've seen people prefer asking very devout people for supplications since they're very close to God though.

For the dua, no. For the five daily salats it's precise movements with slight differing between madhabs.

5197,"&gt;So as I see it in the Quran, if you believe the words of the Quran, then it compels you to believe the words of the Bible. If you are rejecting the Bible, you are rejecting the Quran.

This is a common misconception Christian apologetic sites get wrong. 

&gt;*He has sent down upon you, [O Muhammad], the Book in truth,* ***confirming what was before it.***

In another verse:

&gt;*And We have revealed to you, [O Muúammad], the Book in truth,* ***confirming that which preceded it of the Scripture and as a criterion over it.***

Allah (swt) is saying he revealed the Qur'an verifying what came before it. It corrects the wrongs, and confirms the truths, a criterion over the previous revelations from him. A yardstick for whats truth and whats false.

&gt;*So judge between them by what Allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations away from what has come to you of the truth.*

Again, Allah (swt) tells us to judge between them by the Qur'an.

&gt;*And He revealed the Torah and the Gospel.  Before, as guidance for the people. And He revealed the Qur'an. Indeed, those who disbelieve in the verses of Allah will have a severe punishment, and Allah is exalted in Might, the Owner of Retribution.*

Here Allah (swt) says he *revealed* the Torah and the *Gospel*, notice no plural. The Torah was *revealed* to Moses (pbuh) and the Gospel was *revealed* to Jesus (pbuh). 

What you have is not the Gospel given to Jesus (pbuh). What you have is what men attempted at recollecting the Gospel Jesus (pbuh) was preaching. If you buy a red-print Bible and focus on the Gospels, you'll notice Jesus' (pbuh) words make up almost nothing. The Gospel given to Jesus (pbuh) would have been **one** Gospel, complete with all his words he was commanded to say by God, and nothing else. 

&gt;Sura 6:34, 6:115, and 10:64 explain that the word of God cannot be changed or altered:

This doesn't mean what you think it means. I can open up the Qur'an and alter it right now. The Qur'an says associating with God means you will go to Hell. I can alter every verse that says that, change it to say associating with God is totally fine. Doesn't change the fact that he said he will throw idolaters to Hell. His word can't by changed in that way. 

He has already said previous scripture was corrupted:

&gt;*And among them are unlettered ones who do not know the Scripture except in wishful thinking, but they are only assuming. So woe to those who write the ""scripture"" with their own hands, then say, ""This is from Allah ,"" in order to exchange it for a small price. Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn.*

5214,"**Part 2:**

So, the above has been a lot of the ""seeing the leaves"" point of view. What about ""looking at the forest?"" Going back to what I first said, Shar'iah means path to water. It means doing what God wants from us. But these laws I've listed are very specific. Not committing adultery, not stealing, etc. Looking at it from a bird's eye view, what does God want?
 
Classical legal scholars distilled all of Shar'iah down to a single statement which translates to ""Preserving that which is beneficial and prohibiting that which is harmful."" So, you know how in the US constitution we say that the inherent rights given to us are **life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness**?"" Well, the Shar'iah equivalent is called the **maqasid** or the objectives of the Shar'iah. These are:
 
1. Protection of Faith
2. Protection of Life
3. Protection of Family (lineage/progeny)
4. Protection of Intellect
5. Protection of Wealth
 
The approach has been commonly associated with Juwayni and his student Ghazali as well as the famous Ibn Taymiyyah and the Andalusian al-Shatibi.
 
Basically, any shar'iah law can fall into one of these categories. Prohibition against adultery? Number 3. Freedom of religion: Number 1. Prohibition against murder? Number 2. In modern times, someone could argue that a national health system free of charge is a responsibility of the state due to Maqasid #2. Sure, you can't bring forth a hadith to say that a national health system is a responsibility of the state, but the maqasid approach would say ""Look, we can see from all the rulings in the Shar'iah that one of it's goals is to protect life. In our day and age, denying medical care due to lack of money is going against the protection of life. Therefore, it is the right of the people to have their health care paid for.""
 
Now, be careful. This approach still has to be grounded in the four sources I gave before. It really requires an advanced legal scholar to utilize but it's the direction that the field is currently moving in.
 
Anyway, with that block of text, let me leave you with two books that (although a big heavy), give a good overview of Shar'iah in case you want to read more.

* ""Misquoting Muhammad"" by Jonathan AC Brown.
* ""Radical Reform"" by Tariq Ramadan.",2016-05-02 20:28:57+00:00,d2q3cal,2.0,t1_d2q3b7r,38.0,islam
5215,"**By /u/AnotherParaclete Part 1:**

Shar'iah literally means ""path to water."" Knowing the linguistic meaning of the word is very important because it sets the backdrop for how Muslims view Shar'iah. Remember, Islam first developed in a desert environment. Your life literally revolved around knowing where the water was located. And so the word Shar'iah invokes the image of being *the* path to life. For non-Muslims, the word ""Shari'ah"" conjures up images of amputated hands and stoned adulterers and beheadings. For a Muslim, the word ""Shari'ah"" conjures up images of social justice, economic equity, and yes, freedom. A fantastic article by Noah Feldman of Harvard in the NYTimes titled, [*Why Shari'ah?](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/magazine/16Shariah-t.html?pagewanted=al) explores this divide.
 
Now that's pretty abstract, let's talk concrete, what does Shar'iah *really* mean? It refers to the entire body of what God wants from a person. In other words, it is the set of ethics and laws (path) to God's mercy (water). So when a Muslim uses the word Shar'iah, they mean everything that a person is supposed to do/believe. This includes theology, acts of worship, business transactions, and national laws. So let's break this down into percentages.
 
The bulk of Shar'iah, say 70% deals with rituals and acts of worship. So Shar'iah tells Muslims how many times a day they should pray (5) and and what times. It tells them to give 2.5% of their savings in obligatory charity every year. It tells them to fast during the lunar mont of Ramadan. It tells them to honor the sacrifice of Abraham by doing the hajj at least once in their life.
 
Now, about 25% of Shar'iah deals with what I would call personal law. This is somewhere in between religious and secular law. In that, it deals with things that are not purely religious, but places religious conditions on them. So, for example, marriage. What constitutes a marriage in Islam? (Interesting tidbit you can surprise your Muslim friends with. In Arabic, the past tense is used for certainty, so marriage vows have to be done in the past tense. Present tense vows are not valid. In other words, they must say ""Have you taken this person to be your lawfully wedded wife?"" And the guy says ""I have done so""  instead of ""I do."" There's a dispute amongst legal scholars if that condition is necessary when done in a different language.)
Under this 25% comes food laws. You've heard, I'm sure, that Muslimsm don't eat pork. That comes in here. Same with alcohol. And then what about things which are made *from* alcohol but are not alcoholic? For example, vinegar (spoiler: it's allowed). Under this 25% also comes a strict prohibition on interest. A lot of the early Muslims were merchants so there's a *lot* of laws in regards to business transactions and what is allowed and what is not.
 
Finally, in the last 5%, the biggie that everyone's probably thinking about, those laws intended for application at a national level. It's funny because while this is the first thing that comes to non-Muslims mind when someone says Shar'iah, it's one of the last thing that comes to a Muslim's mind. Even in Islamic states that have ruled by the Shar'iah (I would argue, as would the vast majority of Muslims, that such a state has not existed since 1914 and even that wasn't full Shar'iah), this 5% is not usually very relevant to most people. But this is where you get the cutting off the hand of a thief, stoning an adulterer (contrary to popular belief, the punishment and evidenciary standard is equivalent for male and female adulterers), and executing an apostate. Now this usually interests most people, so let me go more into detail about it.
 
First of all, realize that Shar'iah is not codified. There have been attempts (the Ottomans and the Mughals come to mind) but none have been very successful. So interpretations on this five percent will vary. However, I think people go to two extremes here. You have one group of people who think shar'iah is monolithic and thus what one person says speaks for everyone. Then you have another set who say that Muslims have so many differing opinions that to ask ""what is shar'iah?"" is meaningless since there's no central authority. Neither is quite right. To understand this, I need to take a step back and explain *how* we get Shar'iah.
 
The basis of the Shar'iah are two main and two ""secondary"" things. I put secondary in quotes because really, these four are considered the primary sources of Shar'iah and everything else is secondary/ancillary. So, in order (sorta, let me explain):
 
1. The Qur'an- hopefully this is obvious, this is the holiest book in Islam
2. The Sunnah- the practice of the Prophet. In other words, how he implemented the Qur'an. You might find some sources list this as ""hadith"" but there's a bit of a nuance here that becomes important at higher levels of study. A hadith is defined as a statement of the Prophet, an action of the Prophet which someone recorded, or a tacit approval (he saw something and did not object to it). I don't want to bore you with details, but suffice it to say that in two legal schools, a hadith can state something but is not accepted as evidence because something else qualified as Sunnah. I can explain more in replies if anyone is interested.
3. 'Ijma- this is a consensus. Meaning, if all the Muslim legal scholars in a certain time and place come to an agreement on something, it becomes law. The idea behind this is that it's unthinkable that *everyone* could misunderstand what God meant.
4. Qiyas- analogical deduction. This is where analogies are made to new situations. For example, technically, only *khamr* (defined as an alcoholic beverage made from grapes) is forbidden in the Qur'an. You could argue that beer is fine since it's not explicitly condemned. However, qiyas is applied and beer is equated to khamr and all alcoholic beverages are forbidden regardless of their origin.
 
Now, like I said, the above order is the ""official"" order but it is done more out of respect than actual importance. It has been stated (and I think I agree with this) that in reality, the most important source of Shar'iah historically has been Ijma, consensus. If you think about it, it makes sense. If everyone is agreeing on something, it almost certainly has strong foundations in both the Qur'an *and* the Sunnah and is abundantly clear. The second most important is probably the Sunnah not the Qur'an. This is because the Sunnah can restrict the meaning of the Qur'an but not vice versa. In other words, if the Qur'an states something and the Prophet's actions seem to contradict it, the Qur'an's meaning is re-evaluated in light of the Prophet's actions. This is why you have statements from classical legal scholars to the effect of ""The Sunnah rules over the Qur'an but the Qur'an does not rule over the Sunnah."" This shocks a lot of non-Muslims (and dare I say, some Muslims who don't know much about Shar'iah) but it's abundantly clear to anyone who studies this field. The third in importance is Qur'an and the fourth is Qiyas.
 
So, if someone wants to bring something and claim it is Shar'iah, they must have evidence from these four categories. If someone says ""it's my interpretation of the Shar'iah, I can interpret it how I like"" they would be laughed out of the building. You *must* provide evidence from these.
 
Now, going back to the 5%, let's look at them again. I'll take stoning as an example. Let's look at stoning. The evidentiary standard for stoning as found in Ijma and Sunnah (remember, these two are the most important) is extremely, extremely high. Four adult witnesses must see the male's penis penetrate into the vagina. Make sure you understand me, I'm not saying four people must see them committing adultery (side note: stoning is solely for adulterers, if the two are unmarried, stoning isn't the punishment). I'm saying four people must actually see the penetration occur. If four people walk into a room and see a man and a woman naked on the bed going at it but the angle is such that the penis isn't visible, it doesn't count. Needless to say, this makes it next to impossible for the standard to be met and I am not aware of any case in Islamic history where someone has been stoned by meeting this standard. The only other way for them to be stoned is to turn themselves in (which is emphatically discouraged in the sunnah). In the entire reign of the Ottoman caliphate, 1 stoning occurred.
 
You might ask, well then, what the heck is the purpose of a punishment when it can't be enforced? Two things. Most importantly, it serves as a deterrent. Realize that in the time period where Islam began, there was no police force or real law enforcement. People abstained from crimes based on a social contract and the fear of punishment. I'm sure as hell less likely to have a one night stand if there's even a 1% chance I'm going to get stoned (not in the marijuana sense). It also makes the seriousness of the crime more tangible. There's a difference between saying ""Don't commit adultery, you'll be punished in hell for a finite period of time. Unless you repent, because God forgives anyone who repents."" and ""Don't commit adultery, because if you get caught, you'll get stones pelted at you until you die."" Finally, these punishments (called hudood in Arabic) are setting the limits. If four people walked in on two people doing it, you can bet there would have been some punishment (called tazir punishments). Not stoning (since the standard can't be met) but perhaps a hefty fine or public humiliation.",2016-05-02 20:28:19+00:00,d2q3b7r,1.0,t3_4hjibc,1281.0,islam

5243,"Adding to /u/mansoorz comment, if your intentions were honest and pure in searching for the truth and you die a Catholic, Allah (swt) may choose to forgive you.

&gt;*And [beware the Day] when Allah will say, ""O Jesus, Son of Mary, did you say to the people, 'Take me and my mother as deities besides Allah ?'"" He will say, ""Exalted are You! It was not for me to say that to which I have no right. If I had said it, You would have known it. You know what is within myself, and I do not know what is within Yourself. Indeed, it is You who is Knower of the unseen.*

&gt;*I said not to them except what You commanded me - to worship Allah , my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them as long as I was among them; but when You took me up, You were the Observer over them, and You are, over all things, Witness.*

&gt;*If You should punish them - indeed they are Your servants;* ***but if You forgive them - indeed it is You who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.***

Notice Allah (swt) says he will *draw out* from every sect the ones most rebellious against him, and he knows best who they are:

&gt;*So by your Lord, We will surely gather them and the devils; then We will bring them to be present around Hell upon their knees.* ***Then We will surely extract from every sect those of them who were worst against the Most Merciful in insolence. Then, surely it is We who are most knowing of those most worthy of burning therein.*** *And there is none of you except he will come to it. This is upon your Lord an inevitability decreed. Then We will save those who feared Allah and leave the wrongdoers within it, on their knees.*

But if you are cheating or deluding yourself, one of the rebellious ones, than Jesus (pbuh) himself will be your enemy on Judgement Day. 

&gt;*And they have taken besides Allah [false] deities that they would be for them [a source of] honor.* ***No! Those ""gods"" will deny their worship of them and will be against them opponents [on the Day of Judgement].***

Favorite verses:

&gt;*When the Trumpet sounds, that will be a Day of anguish for the
disbelievers. They will have no ease. [Prophet], leave Me to deal with the one I created helpless, then gave vast wealth, and sons by his side, making everything easy for him––yet he still hopes I will give him more. No! He has been stubbornly hostile to Our
revelation: I will inflict a spiralling torment on him. He planned
and plotted––devilishly he plotted! ferociously he plotted!–– and looked and frowned and scowled and turned away and behaved arrogantly and said, ‘This is just old sorcery, just the talk of a mortal!’*

Surat l-Qalam. My favorite recitation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8DPl_xGC7g).

Favorite verses:

&gt;*Soon you will see, as will they, which of you is afflicted with madness. Your Lord knows best who strays from His path and who is rightly guided. So do not yield to those who deny the truth––they want you to compromise with them and then they will compromise with you––do not yield to any contemptible swearer, to any backbiter, slander-monger, or hinderer of good, to anyone who is sinful, aggressive, coarse, and on top of all that, an imposter. Just because he has wealth and sons, when our revelations are recited to him, he says, ‘These are just ancient fables.’  We shall brand him on the snout!*

&gt;*Should We treat those who submit to Us as We treat those
who do evil? What is the matter with you? On what basis do you
judge? Do you have a Scripture that tells you that you will be
granted whatever you choose? Have you received from Us solemn
oaths, binding to the Day of Resurrection, that you will get whatever you yourselves decide? Ask them [Prophet] which of them will guarantee this. Do they have ‘partners’ [besides God]? Let them produce their ‘partners’, if what they say is true. On the Day when matters become dire, they will be invited to prostrate themselves but will be prevented from doing so, and their eyes will be downcast and they will be overwhelmed with shame: they were invited to prostrate themselves when they were safe [but refused].*

&gt;*So [Prophet] leave those who reject this revelation to Me: We
shall lead them on, step by step, in ways beyond their knowledge; I will allow them more time, for My plan is powerful. Do you
demand some reward from them that would burden them with debt? Do they have knowledge of the unseen that enables them to write it down?*",2016-04-24 03:50:25+00:00,d2f0jxs,1.0,t3_4g6o4h,1178.0,islam

Transliteration:

The last word in the verse is *rajeem*, which means rejected/accursed, in regards to Iblis. 

Iblis is a evil jinn, which are also called Satans:

&gt;*Do you not see how we let loose the Satans upon the disbelievers, inciting them incitingly?*

Back to the first verse I cited again, Allah (swt) tells Iblis to leave his presence and that he is rejected/accursed, or *rajeem*.

I don't know. I'd probably see why each madhab holds a certain opinion, and the evidences they have for their opinion, and then decide which one has the most evidence to support their opinion and go with that. 

By the way, do Hanafis believe touching the opp. sex breaks wudoo'?

&gt;Or some believe that the preferences of Jurists is a good source of law, some madhabs disagree and believe only that Jurist discretion is a man-made innovation.

What do Hanafis believe about this?

Muslims have to fast from all food and drink as well as sex everyday for 30 days in the month of Ramadan. The fast starts when the sun comes up and we break fast when the sun goes down. This year it's in the summer, so 15 hours of fasting if you live where I live.

Also, many Muslims voluntarily fast every Monday and Thursday the same way as well. ",2016-04-13 18:08:02+00:00,d21gd39,3.0,t1_d21f2vv,1597.0,Christianity

5317,"&gt;But why does God test people with clearly unequal levels of calamities?

I really love this explanation by /u/turkeyfox about this topic.

&gt;No, the odds are rigged to everyone's favor. Everyone is tested according to their ability. Imagine you were supposed to play a 1v1 game of basketball against Michael Jordan. You'd say that he has better odds to win right? But imagine that his points are each only worth .01 and your points are each worth 99. Now it seems like you have better odds to win (assuming you're relatively able-bodied), since MJ has to make 9900 points while you have to only make one. I don't know your basketball ability (but Allah does) and somewhere between those two extremes is a point system where you both have an equal chance to win.

&gt;Similarly, in life's tests, Allah accounts for the fact that some have been given more and some have been given less. His accounting system is such that everyone is given a fair chance.",2016-04-11 16:59:10+00:00,d1yn227,1.0,t3_4ebamo,3955.0,islam

5325,"The story of Mary (as). My favorite Chapter is called Mary (as). I'll quote you the important parts of the story, they have other characters brought up as well. 

**From Chapter Al-Imran**

&gt;*Imran’s wife said, ‘Lord, I have dedicated what is growing in my womb entirely to You; so accept this from me. You are the One who hears and knows all,’ but when she gave birth, she said, ‘My Lord! I have given birth to a girl’– God knew best what she had given birth to: the male is not like the female–‘ I name her Mary and I commend her and her offspring to Your protection from the rejected Satan.’ Her Lord graciously accepted her and made her grow in goodness, and entrusted her to the charge of Zachariah.*

&gt;*Whenever Zachariah went in to see her in her sanctuary, he found her supplied with provisions. He said, ‘Mary, how is it you have these provisions?’ and she said, ‘They are from God: God provides limitlessly for whoever He will.’ There and then Zachariah prayed to his Lord, saying, ‘Lord, from Your grace grant me virtuous off- spring: You hear every prayer.’ The angels called out to him, while he stood praying in the sanctuary, ‘God gives you news of John, confirming a Word from God. He will be noble and chaste, a prophet, one of the righteous.’ He said, ‘My Lord, how can I have a son when I am so old and my wife is barren?’ [An angel] said, ‘It will be so: God does whatever He will.’ He said, ‘My Lord, give me a sign.’ ‘Your sign,’ [the angel] said, ‘is that you will not communicate with anyone for three days, except by gestures. Remember your Lord often; celebrate His glory in the evening and at dawn.’*

&gt;*The angels said to Mary: ‘Mary, God has chosen you and made you pure: He has truly chosen you above all women. Mary, be devout to your Lord, prostrate yourself in worship, bow down with those who pray.’ This is an account of things beyond your know- ledge that We reveal to you [Muhammad]: you were not present among them when theyc cast lots to see which of them should take charge of Mary, you were not present with them when they argued [about her].* 

&gt;*The angels said, ‘Mary, God gives you news of a Word from Him, whose name will be the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, who will be held in honour in this world and the next, who will be one of those brought near to God. He will speak to people in his infancy and in his adulthood. He will be one of the righteous.’ She said, ‘My Lord, how can I have a son when no man has touched me?’ [The angel] said, ‘This is how God creates what He will: when He has ordained something, He only says, “Be”, and it is.*

&gt;*He will teach him the Scripture and wisdom, the Torah and the Gospel, He will send him as a messenger to the Children of Israel: “I have come to you with a sign from your Lord: I will make the shape of a bird for you out of clay, then breathe into it and, with God’s permission, it will become a real bird; I will heal the blind and the leper, and bring the dead back to life with God’s permission; I will tell you what you may eat and what you may store up in your houses. There truly is a sign for you in this, if you are believers. I have come to confirm the truth of the Torah which preceded me, and to make some things lawful to you which used to be forbidden. I have come to you with a sign from your Lord. Be mindful of God, obey me: God is my Lord and your Lord, so serve Him– that is a straight path.”’*

&gt;*When Jesus realized they [still] did not believe, he said, ‘Who will help me in God’s cause?’ The disciples said, ‘We will be God’s helpers; we believe in God– witness our devotion to Him. Lord, we believe in what You have revealed and we follow the messenger: record us among those who bear witness [to the Truth].’*

&gt;*The [disbelievers] schemed but God also schemed; God is the Best of Schemers. God said, ‘Jesus, I will take you back and raise you up to Me: I will purify you of the disbelievers. To the Day of Resurrection I will make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieved. Then you will all return to Me and I will judge between you regarding your differences. I will make the disbelievers suffer severely in this world and the next; no one will help them.’ God will pay those who believe and do good deeds their reward in full; God does not love evildoers.*

&gt;*We relate to you [Muhammad] this revelation, a decisive statement. In God’s eyes Jesus is just like Adam: He created him from dust, said to him, ‘Be’, and he was.This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be one of those who doubt.*

**From Chapter Mary**

&gt;*Mention in the Quran the story of Mary. She withdrew from her family to a place to the east and secluded herself away; We sent Our Spirit to appear before her in the form of a perfected man. She said, ‘I seek the Lord of Mercy’s protection against you: if you have any fear of Him [do not approach]!’ but he said, ‘I am but a Mes- senger from your Lord, [come] to announce to you the gift of a pure son.’ She said, ‘How can I have a son when no man has touched me? I have not been unchaste,’ and he said, ‘This is what your Lord said: “It is easy for Me– We shall make him a sign to all people, a blessing from Us.”’ And so it was ordained: she conceived him.*

&gt;*She withdrew to a distant place and, when the pains of childbirth drove her to [cling to] the trunk of a palm tree, she exclaimed, ‘I wish I had been dead and forgotten long before all this!’ but a voice cried to her from below, ‘Do not worry: your Lord has provided a stream at your feet and, if you shake the trunk of the palm tree towards you, it will deliver fresh ripe dates for you, so eat, drink, be glad, and say to anyone you may see: “I have vowed to the Lord of Mercy to abstain from conversation, and I will not talk to anyone today.”’*

&gt;*She went back to her people carrying the child, and they said, ‘Mary! You have done something terrible! Sister of Aaron! Your father was not an evil man; your mother was not unchaste!’ She pointed at him. They said, ‘How can we converse with an infant?’ [But] he said: ‘I am a servant of God. He has granted me the Scripture; made me a prophet; made me blessed wherever I may be. He commanded me to pray, to give alms as long as I live, to cherish my mother. He did not make me domineering or graceless. Peace was on me the day I was born, and will be on me the day I die and the day I am raised to life again.’*

&gt;*Such was Jesus, son of Mary. [This is] a statement of the Truth about which they are in doubt: it would not befit God to have a child. He is far above that: when He decrees something, He says only, ‘Be,’ and it is. ‘God is my Lord and your Lord, so serve Him: that is a straight path.’ But factions have differed amongthemselves. What suffering will come to those who obscure the truth when a dreadful Day arrives! How sharp of hearing, how sharp of sight they will be when they come to Us, although now they are clearly off course! Warn them [Muhammad] of the Day of Remorse when the matter will be decided, for they are heedless and do not believe. It is We who will inherit the earth and all who are on it: they will all be returned to Us.*

5327,"&gt;After many eventful years, the Prophet Moses, believing that his people had attained to the
stage of forming a civilized community on the basis of the Divine laws, went to Mount Sinai to
receive the Torah. However, the Children of Israel adopted as deity the calf – one amongst them
(called as-Sāmiriyy in the Qur’ān) made it of jewelry – and they began worshipping it. This
demonstrated that belief in God as the only Lord to be worshipped was not yet ingrained in their
hearts, and they were still enthralled by the impressions they had received in Egypt, where the
cow was one of the deities. Moses postponed putting the Torah into effect and attempted to
suppress this doctrinal uprising. He ordered them to “kill amongst yourselves those who have
committed that great offense, thus purifying yourselves of this tremendous sin.” Some
interpreters are of the opinion that this order meant for them to kill their carnal, evil-
commanding souls, that is, to reform themselves. However, it may well mean that an internal
conflict ensued between those who remained loyal to the Divine Oneness and the apostates, and
Moses ordered the killing of the latter. (Also, see note 70.) Killing the carnal, evil-commanding
souls might be a consequence of this. The Bible is full of accounts of such punishments as mass-
killing, exile, plagues, pestilence, and famine that came in return for certain grave sins. It records
that 3000 people were killed because of taking to themselves the calf ( Exodus , 32: 28).

&gt;*Children of Israel, remember how I blessed you. Honour your pledge to Me and I will honour My pledge to you: I am the One you should fear. Believe in the message I have sent down confirming what you already possess. Do not be the first to disbelieve in it, and do not sell My messages for a small price: I am the One of whom you should be mindful. Do not mix truth with falsehood, or hide the truth when you know it. Keep up the prayer, pay the prescribed alms, and bow your heads [in worship] with those who bow theirs.* 

&gt;*How can you tell people to do what is right and forget to do it yourselves, even though you recite the Scripture? Have you no sense? Seek help with steadfastness and prayer– though this is hard indeed for anyone but the humble, who know that they will meet their Lord and that it is to Him they will return.* 

&gt;*Children of Israel, remember how I blessed you and favoured you over other people. Guard yourselves against a Day when no soul will stand in place of another, no intercession will be accepted for it, nor any ransom; nor will they be helped. Remember when We saved you from Pharaoh’s people, who subjected you to terrible torment, slaughtering your sons and sparing only your women– this was a great trial from your Lord– and when We parted the sea for you, so saving you and drowning Pharaoh’s people right before your eyes. We appointed forty nights for Moses [on Mount Sinai] and then, while he was away, you took to worshipping the calf– a terrible wrong. Even then We forgave you, so that you might be thankful.*

&gt;*Remember when We gave Moses the Scripture, and the means to distinguish [right and wrong], so that you might be guided. Moses said to his people, ‘My people, you have wronged yourselves by worshipping the calf, so repent to your Maker and kill [the guilty among] you. That is the best you can do in the eyes of your Maker.’ He accepted your repentance: He is the Ever Relenting and the Most Merciful. Remember when you said, ‘Moses, we will not believe you until we see God face to face.’ At that, thunderbolts struck you as you looked on. Then We revived you after your death, so that you might be thankful. We made the clouds cover you with shade, and sent manna and quails down to you, saying, ‘Eat the good things We have provided for you.’ It was not Us they wronged; they wronged themselves.* [2:40-57]

So, the above has been a lot of the ""seeing the leaves"" point of view. What about ""looking at the forest?"" Going back to what I first said, Shar'iah means path to water. It means doing what God wants from us. But these laws I've listed are very specific. Not committing adultery, not stealing, etc. Looking at it from a bird's eye view, what does God want?
 
Classical legal scholars distilled all of Shar'iah down to a single statement which translates to ""Preserving that which is beneficial and prohibiting that which is harmful."" So, you know how in the US constitution we say that the inherent rights given to us are **life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness**?"" Well, the Shar'iah equivalent is called the **maqasid** or the objectives of the Shar'iah. These are:
 
1. Protection of Faith
2. Protection of Life
3. Protection of Family (lineage/progeny)
4. Protection of Intellect
5. Protection of Wealth
 
The approach has been commonly associated with Juwayni and his student Ghazali as well as the famous Ibn Taymiyyah and the Andalusian al-Shatibi.
 
Basically, any shar'iah law can fall into one of these categories. Prohibition against adultery? Number 3. Freedom of religion: Number 1. Prohibition against murder? Number 2. In modern times, someone could argue that a national health system free of charge is a responsibility of the state due to Maqasid #2. Sure, you can't bring forth a hadith to say that a national health system is a responsibility of the state, but the maqasid approach would say ""Look, we can see from all the rulings in the Shar'iah that one of it's goals is to protect life. In our day and age, denying medical care due to lack of money is going against the protection of life. Therefore, it is the right of the people to have their health care paid for.""
 
Now, be careful. This approach still has to be grounded in the four sources I gave before. It really requires an advanced legal scholar to utilize but it's the direction that the field is currently moving in.
 
Anyway, with that block of text, let me leave you with two books that (although a big heavy), give a good overview of Shar'iah in case you want to read more.

5363,"**By /u/AnotherParaclete Part 1:**

Shar'iah literally means ""path to water."" Knowing the linguistic meaning of the word is very important because it sets the backdrop for how Muslims view Shar'iah. Remember, Islam first developed in a desert environment. Your life literally revolved around knowing where the water was located. And so the word Shar'iah invokes the image of being *the* path to life. For non-Muslims, the word ""Shari'ah"" conjures up images of amputated hands and stoned adulterers and beheadings. For a Muslim, the word ""Shari'ah"" conjures up images of social justice, economic equity, and yes, freedom. A fantastic article by Noah Feldman of Harvard in the NYTimes titled, [*Why Shari'ah?](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/magazine/16Shariah-t.html?pagewanted=al) explores this divide.
 
Now that's pretty abstract, let's talk concrete, what does Shar'iah *really* mean? It refers to the entire body of what God wants from a person. In other words, it is the set of ethics and laws (path) to God's mercy (water). So when a Muslim uses the word Shar'iah, they mean everything that a person is supposed to do/believe. This includes theology, acts of worship, business transactions, and national laws. So let's break this down into percentages.
 
The bulk of Shar'iah, say 70% deals with rituals and acts of worship. So Shar'iah tells Muslims how many times a day they should pray (5) and and what times. It tells them to give 2.5% of their savings in obligatory charity every year. It tells them to fast during the lunar mont of Ramadan. It tells them to honor the sacrifice of Abraham by doing the hajj at least once in their life.
 
Now, about 25% of Shar'iah deals with what I would call personal law. This is somewhere in between religious and secular law. In that, it deals with things that are not purely religious, but places religious conditions on them. So, for example, marriage. What constitutes a marriage in Islam? (Interesting tidbit you can surprise your Muslim friends with. In Arabic, the past tense is used for certainty, so marriage vows have to be done in the past tense. Present tense vows are not valid. In other words, they must say ""Have you taken this person to be your lawfully wedded wife?"" And the guy says ""I have done so""  instead of ""I do."" There's a dispute amongst legal scholars if that condition is necessary when done in a different language.)
Under this 25% comes food laws. You've heard, I'm sure, that Muslimsm don't eat pork. That comes in here. Same with alcohol. And then what about things which are made *from* alcohol but are not alcoholic? For example, vinegar (spoiler: it's allowed). Under this 25% also comes a strict prohibition on interest. A lot of the early Muslims were merchants so there's a *lot* of laws in regards to business transactions and what is allowed and what is not.
 
Finally, in the last 5%, the biggie that everyone's probably thinking about, those laws intended for application at a national level. It's funny because while this is the first thing that comes to non-Muslims mind when someone says Shar'iah, it's one of the last thing that comes to a Muslim's mind. Even in Islamic states that have ruled by the Shar'iah (I would argue, as would the vast majority of Muslims, that such a state has not existed since 1914 and even that wasn't full Shar'iah), this 5% is not usually very relevant to most people. But this is where you get the cutting off the hand of a thief, stoning an adulterer (contrary to popular belief, the punishment and evidenciary standard is equivalent for male and female adulterers), and executing an apostate. Now this usually interests most people, so let me go more into detail about it.
 
First of all, realize that Shar'iah is not codified. There have been attempts (the Ottomans and the Mughals come to mind) but none have been very successful. So interpretations on this five percent will vary. However, I think people go to two extremes here. You have one group of people who think shar'iah is monolithic and thus what one person says speaks for everyone. Then you have another set who say that Muslims have so many differing opinions that to ask ""what is shar'iah?"" is meaningless since there's no central authority. Neither is quite right. To understand this, I need to take a step back and explain *how* we get Shar'iah.
 
The basis of the Shar'iah are two main and two ""secondary"" things. I put secondary in quotes because really, these four are considered the primary sources of Shar'iah and everything else is secondary/ancillary. So, in order (sorta, let me explain):
 
1. The Qur'an- hopefully this is obvious, this is the holiest book in Islam
2. The Sunnah- the practice of the Prophet. In other words, how he implemented the Qur'an. You might find some sources list this as ""hadith"" but there's a bit of a nuance here that becomes important at higher levels of study. A hadith is defined as a statement of the Prophet, an action of the Prophet which someone recorded, or a tacit approval (he saw something and did not object to it). I don't want to bore you with details, but suffice it to say that in two legal schools, a hadith can state something but is not accepted as evidence because something else qualified as Sunnah. I can explain more in replies if anyone is interested.
3. 'Ijma- this is a consensus. Meaning, if all the Muslim legal scholars in a certain time and place come to an agreement on something, it becomes law. The idea behind this is that it's unthinkable that *everyone* could misunderstand what God meant.
4. Qiyas- analogical deduction. This is where analogies are made to new situations. For example, technically, only *khamr* (defined as an alcoholic beverage made from grapes) is forbidden in the Qur'an. You could argue that beer is fine since it's not explicitly condemned. However, qiyas is applied and beer is equated to khamr and all alcoholic beverages are forbidden regardless of their origin.
 
Now, like I said, the above order is the ""official"" order but it is done more out of respect than actual importance. It has been stated (and I think I agree with this) that in reality, the most important source of Shar'iah historically has been Ijma, consensus. If you think about it, it makes sense. If everyone is agreeing on something, it almost certainly has strong foundations in both the Qur'an *and* the Sunnah and is abundantly clear. The second most important is probably the Sunnah not the Qur'an. This is because the Sunnah can restrict the meaning of the Qur'an but not vice versa. In other words, if the Qur'an states something and the Prophet's actions seem to contradict it, the Qur'an's meaning is re-evaluated in light of the Prophet's actions. This is why you have statements from classical legal scholars to the effect of ""The Sunnah rules over the Qur'an but the Qur'an does not rule over the Sunnah."" This shocks a lot of non-Muslims (and dare I say, some Muslims who don't know much about Shar'iah) but it's abundantly clear to anyone who studies this field. The third in importance is Qur'an and the fourth is Qiyas.
 
So, if someone wants to bring something and claim it is Shar'iah, they must have evidence from these four categories. If someone says ""it's my interpretation of the Shar'iah, I can interpret it how I like"" they would be laughed out of the building. You *must* provide evidence from these.
 
Now, going back to the 5%, let's look at them again. I'll take stoning as an example. Let's look at stoning. The evidentiary standard for stoning as found in Ijma and Sunnah (remember, these two are the most important) is extremely, extremely high. Four adult witnesses must see the male's penis penetrate into the vagina. Make sure you understand me, I'm not saying four people must see them committing adultery (side note: stoning is solely for adulterers, if the two are unmarried, stoning isn't the punishment). I'm saying four people must actually see the penetration occur. If four people walk into a room and see a man and a woman naked on the bed going at it but the angle is such that the penis isn't visible, it doesn't count. Needless to say, this makes it next to impossible for the standard to be met and I am not aware of any case in Islamic history where someone has been stoned by meeting this standard. The only other way for them to be stoned is to turn themselves in (which is emphatically discouraged in the sunnah). In the entire reign of the Ottoman caliphate, 1 stoning occurred.
 
You might ask, well then, what the heck is the purpose of a punishment when it can't be enforced? Two things. Most importantly, it serves as a deterrent. Realize that in the time period where Islam began, there was no police force or real law enforcement. People abstained from crimes based on a social contract and the fear of punishment. I'm sure as hell less likely to have a one night stand if there's even a 1% chance I'm going to get stoned (not in the marijuana sense). It also makes the seriousness of the crime more tangible. There's a difference between saying ""Don't commit adultery, you'll be punished in hell for a finite period of time. Unless you repent, because God forgives anyone who repents."" and ""Don't commit adultery, because if you get caught, you'll get stones pelted at you until you die."" Finally, these punishments (called hudood in Arabic) are setting the limits. If four people walked in on two people doing it, you can bet there would have been some punishment (called tazir punishments). Not stoning (since the standard can't be met) but perhaps a hefty fine or public humiliation.",2016-04-06 01:18:11+00:00,d1rj4xs,1.0,t3_4djiyv,546.0,islam

Of course it can be interpreted the other way around logically and grammatically (see link above), but this is the most common interpretation. Another verse is in Surah Kahf: ""[Iblees] was **of (or from) the** jinn..."" This also implies that Iblees is a Jinn though a minority of scholars have interpreted ""of the"" to mean through association (he used to and continues to teach Jinn), not by nature. The last verse which is mentioned multiple times is that Iblees says ""You created me from fire."" Allah also says that He creates Jinn from fire. By transition, this is a very strong proof that Iblees is a Jinn. In the link, you can see a few scholars argue that light (composition of angels) and fire can be synonymous. **The soundest opinion seems to be that he is in fact a Jinn, and not an angel.**",2016-04-04 23:20:41+00:00,d1pzobi,3.0,t1_d1pzlrd,110.0,islam

Yea, I've been told I'm sexist at least once before on this subreddit lol.  

&gt;anyway you were denoting her unlikeability as a whole by criticizing her looks alone, you can criticize her ideas on face value without having to resort to mocking her physical appearance. its like when men in the past used to disregard women and their ideas or not take them seriously or listen to them if they looked ""masculine"" or ""ugly"" . it puts the approval of males of her facial characteristics as the ultimate form of approval. so what you're saying is this "" does she look good enough to entertain men? no? then her opinions are invalid (which is why you critiqued her looks in your comment where you were disapproving with her)"" while you should've went ""her ideas are prejudiced? yes? then they should be disregarded as invalid""

Regarding the Children of Israel:
 
&gt;*Then because of their breaking of their covenant, and their disbelieving in the revelations of Allah, and their slaying of the prophets wrongfully, and their saying: Our hearts are hardened - Nay, but Allah set a seal upon them for their disbelief, so that they believe not save a few* - [4:155]

Regarding the Children of Israel disbelieving in God's miracles regarding Jesus (pbuh) and his mother Mary (**Background info:** God commanded Jesus to speak as a child as a miracle for the Children of Israel to know he is a Prophet and to defend his mothers chastity against them, but they disbelieved in his miracle although they knew Jesus (pbuh) was a messenger of God and Mary (as) was a chaste woman): 

&gt;*And because of their disbelief and of their speaking against Mary a tremendous calumny* [4:156]

The Children of Israel plotted to get Jesus (pbuh) killed, but Allah (swt) planned as well.

&gt;*And they planned and Allah (also) planned, and Allah is the best of planners.* [3:54]

For boasting proudly they killed Jesus (pbuh):

&gt;*And [for] their saying, ""Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah."" And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but so it was made to appear to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain.*

&gt;*Rather, Allah raised him to Himself. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise.* [4:157-158]

Allah (swt) saved him and raised him up to him and purified him of those who blasphemed against him:

&gt;*Behold! Allah said: ""O Jesus! I will take thee and raise thee to Myself and clear thee (of the falsehoods) of those who blaspheme; I will make those who follow thee superior to those who reject faith, to the Day of Resurrection: Then shall ye all return unto me, and I will judge between you of the matters wherein ye dispute.* [3:55]

Not sure what you mean, but to my knowledge Ismael (pbuh) is considered the father of Arabs, and Isaac (pbuh) is considered father of the Children of Israel. Muhammad (pbuh) is a descendant of Ismael (pbuh) and Jesus (pbuh) is from the Children of Israel. 

&gt;Also, we've been told that Jesus was the last sacrifice to God. I know you think of him as a prophet, but do you believe he was crucified as a sacrifice to Allah?

No, he was saved from crucifixion.

5456,"&gt;What is the academic view?

The majority opinion of non-Muslim academics is the Qur'an is the work of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). They obviously don't believe it's revelation or they'd be Muslims, but the entire book is attributed to him.

There are a few fringe scholars that claimed weird theories, but they have been rejected by mainstream academia. These rejected theories were proposed by the likes of John Wansbrough, Patricia Crone and Michael Cook. 

Regarding Wansbrough:

&gt;Herbert Berg writes that ""Despite John Wansbrough's very cautious and careful inclusion of qualifications such as ""conjectural,"" and ""tentative and emphatically provisional"", **his work is condemned by some.** Some of this negative reaction is undoubtedly due to its radicalness...**Wansbrough's work has been embraced wholeheartedly by few** and has been employed in a piecemeal fashion by many.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Islam#Reliability_of_the_Quran

Regarding Patricia Crone and Cook:

&gt;Patricia Crone and Michael Cook challenge the traditional account of how the Qur'an was compiled writing that ""there is no hard evidence for the existence of the Koran in any form before the last decade of the seventh century."" They also question the accuracy of some the Qur'an's historical accounts.[11] **It is generally acknowledged that the work of Crone and Cook was a fresh approach in its reconstruction of early Islamic history, but their alternative account of early Islam has been almost universally rejected.**[12] Van Ess has dismissed it stating that ""**a refutation is perhaps unnecessary since the authors make no effort to prove it in detail...Where they are only giving a new interpretation of well-known facts, this is not decisive. But where the accepted facts are consciously put upside down, their approach is disastrous**.""[13] R. B. Serjeant states: **""Hagarism [the thesis of Crone and Cook]...is not only bitterly anti-Islamic in tone, but anti-Arabian. Its superficial fancies are so ridiculous that at first one wonders if it is just a ‘leg pull’, pure ’spoof’.""[14]**

Their theories are ***universally rejected*** and so horrible, they require no refutation since their historical approach is considered 'disastrous', their works come off anti-Islamic  and is so bad, it's regarded as a spoof. 

But even Patricia Crone herself now states the Qur'an can be attributed completely to Muhammad (pbuh):

&gt;She says we can be ""reasonably sure"" in **attributing all or most of the Qur'an to him.**

Regarding the Qur'an's authenticity:

&gt;F.E. Peters states, **""Few have failed to be convinced that what is in our copy of the Quran is, in fact, what Muhammad taught, and is expressed in his own words... To sum this up: the Quran is convincingly the words of Muhammad, perhaps even dictated by him after their recitation"".[10] Peters argues that ""The search for variants in the partial versions extant before the Caliph Uthman’s alleged recension in the 640s (what can be called the 'sources' behind our text) has not yielded any differences of great significance."" .[10]**

Any other critics I haven't heard of have been refuted as well, with the mainstream scholarly opinion being the Qur'an was completely revealed by Muhammad (pbuh), and has not gone through corruption or alteration:

&gt; **It is claimed that such scholars have been proven wrong by subsequent scientific evidence, including carbon dating of early manuscripts of the Quran.** ""The opening chapters of Fred Donner's Narratives of Islamic Origins: The Beginnings of Islamic Historical Writing claims to refute the theoretical and methodological flaws of the skeptical school and instead dates the composition of the Quran, as a closed cannon, to an Arabian context of early believers preceding ... the first civil war in 656.""[65] **Donner's perspective now represents mainstream scholarly opinion.**[66] **The findings in 2015 of the Birmingham Manuscripts lead Joseph E. B. Lumbard, Assistant Professor of Classical Islam,
 Brandeis University, to comment:** [67]

&gt;&gt;These recent empirical findings are of fundamental importance. They establish that as regards the broad outlines of the history of the compilation and codification of the Quranic text, the classical Islamic sources are far more reliable than had hitherto been assumed. **Such findings thus render the vast majority of Western revisionist theories regarding the historical origins of the Quran untenable.**

**لا يعلمون** - They do not know. In the context of the Qur'an, it might mean something they're ignorant of but can know, or it's something they can never know in this life. An example of something they'll never know in this life from the Qur'an is in 68:33 when Allah (swt) says:

&gt;**كَذَٰلِكَ الْعَذَابُ ۖ وَلَعَذَابُ الْآخِرَةِ أَكْبَرُ ۚ لَوْ كَانُوا يَعْلَمُونَ**

&gt;*Such is the chastisement, and certainly the chastisement of the hereafter is greater,* ***if only they knew!***

**لا يعقلون** - They don't understand/use their reason. If they used their reasoning skills, they would understand. An example from the Qur'an is in 2:171 when Allah (swt) says:

&gt;**وَمَثَلُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا كَمَثَلِ الَّذِي يَنْعِقُ بِمَا لَا يَسْمَعُ إِلَّا دُعَاءً وَنِدَاءً ۚ صُمٌّ بُكْمٌ عُمْيٌ فَهُمْ لَا يَعْقِلُونَ**

&gt;*The example of those who disbelieve is like that of one who shouts at what hears nothing but calls and cries cattle or sheep - deaf, dumb and blind,* ***so they do not understand.***

**لا يشعرون** - This means they are not aware, or they do not perceive something. You're numb at the dentist and he's removing your tooth, but you do not feel anything, you are not aware he's pulling your tooth even though he is. An example from the Qur'an is in 3:69 when Allah (swt) says:

&gt;**وَدَّتْ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ لَوْ يُضِلُّونَكُمْ وَمَا يُضِلُّونَ إِلَّا أَنْفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ**

5478,"&gt;For all intents and purposes the man who was crucified everyone believed was Jesus. He looked like him, talked like him, and spoke like him. It just wasn't him in Islamic theology.

Not exactly. Some *tafsirs* (exegesis) claim that the on-lookers were confused regarding if it was really Jesus (pbuh) or not. IIRC there were numerous sects which also believed Jesus (pbuh) was not crucified (some said it was an illusion, some said another was crucified instead etc.)

By the way, the Quran does not say with certainty that someone else was crucified in his place. All it says is it *appeared* so to the on-lookers that Jesus (pbuh) was crucified.

Also, and this is my own laymen interpretation, I agree with the notion that it wasn't clearly Jesus (pbuh) and that it was confusing for the on-lookers. 

I say this because Allah (swt) says sects differed regarding Jesus (pbuh) after his ascension - 19:37:

&gt;*Then the sects differed [concerning Jesus] from among them, so woe to those who disbelieved - from the scene of a tremendous Day.*

In the next verse Allah (swt) emphasizes how the disbelievers will see *clearly* on the day of Resurrection (maybe alluding that they weren't seeing clearly in regards to the crucifixion) - 19:38:

&gt;*How clearly shall they hear and* ***how clearly shall they see on the day when they come to Us***, *but the unjust this day are in manifest error.*

you are commanded and, God willing, you will find me steadfast.’ When they had both submitted to God, and he had laid his son down on the side of his face, We called out to him, ‘Abraham, you have fulfilled the dream.’ This is how We reward those who do good– it was a test to prove [their true characters]– We

When typical historical-critical methods are applied to the Qur'an and the Hadiths, it seems that every historical claim basically falls apart.

Regarding Hadith, brief overview:

Now back to your sources, I see your still using the same pathetic sources which have been rejected by the majority of scholars. 
 
Also, really.. *Typical* historical-critical methods being applied? 

Regarding John Wansbrough:

&gt;Herbert Berg writes that ""Despite John Wansbrough's very cautious and careful inclusion of qualifications such as ""conjectural,"" and ""tentative and emphatically provisional"", **his work is condemned by some.** Some of this negative reaction is undoubtedly due to its radicalness...**Wansbrough's work has been embraced wholeheartedly by few** and has been employed in a piecemeal fashion by many.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Islam#Reliability_of_the_Quran

Regarding Patricia Crone and Cook:

&gt;Patricia Crone and Michael Cook challenge the traditional account of how the Qur'an was compiled writing that ""there is no hard evidence for the existence of the Koran in any form before the last decade of the seventh century."" They also question the accuracy of some the Qur'an's historical accounts.[11] **It is generally acknowledged that the work of Crone and Cook was a fresh approach in its reconstruction of early Islamic history, but their alternative account of early Islam has been almost universally rejected.**[12] Van Ess has dismissed it stating that ""**a refutation is perhaps unnecessary since the authors make no effort to prove it in detail...Where they are only giving a new interpretation of well-known facts, this is not decisive. But where the accepted facts are consciously put upside down, their approach is disastrous**.""[13] R. B. Serjeant states: **""Hagarism [the thesis of Crone and Cook]...is not only bitterly anti-Islamic in tone, but anti-Arabian. Its superficial fancies are so ridiculous that at first one wonders if it is just a ‘leg pull’, pure ’spoof’.""[14]**

Did you read that? Universally rejected.

&gt;***their alternative account of early Islam has been almost universally rejected.***

No refutation needed:

&gt;***a refutation is perhaps unnecessary since the authors make no effort to prove it in detail...***

Regarding their ""typical"" historical approach that you claim:

&gt;***...But where the accepted facts are consciously put upside down, their approach is disastrous.***

Regarded as a 'spoof!':

&gt;***Its superficial fancies are so ridiculous that at first one wonders if it is just a ‘leg pull’, pure ’spoof’.""[14]***

Regarding the Quran:

&gt;F.E. Peters states, **""Few have failed to be convinced that what is in our copy of the Quran is, in fact, what Muhammad taught, and is expressed in his own words... To sum this up: the Quran is convincingly the words of Muhammad, perhaps even dictated by him after their recitation"".[10] Peters argues that ""The search for variants in the partial versions extant before the Caliph Uthman’s alleged recension in the 640s (what can be called the 'sources' behind our text) has not yielded any differences of great significance."" .[10]**

Even your own source, Patricia Crone states:

&gt;She says we can be ""reasonably sure"" in **attributing all or most of the Qur'an to him.**

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Muhammad

Also, regarding the critics like Patricia Crone, Cook and Wansbrough about the Quran, they've been refuted:

&gt; **It is claimed that such scholars have been proven wrong by subsequent scientific evidence, including carbon dating of early manuscripts of the Quran.** ""The opening chapters of Fred Donner's Narratives of Islamic Origins: The Beginnings of Islamic Historical Writing claims to refute the theoretical and methodological flaws of the skeptical school and instead dates the composition of the Quran, as a closed cannon, to an Arabian context of early believers preceding ... the first civil war in 656.""[65] **Donner's perspective now represents mainstream scholarly opinion.**[66] **The findings in 2015 of the Birmingham Manuscripts lead Joseph E. B. Lumbard, Assistant Professor of Classical Islam,
 Brandeis University, to comment:** [67]

&gt;&gt;These recent empirical findings are of fundamental importance. They establish that as regards the broad outlines of the history of the compilation and codification of the Quranic text, the classical Islamic sources are far more reliable than had hitherto been assumed. **Such findings thus render the vast majority of Western revisionist theories regarding the historical origins of the Quran untenable.**

5520,"I read the entire link. If you're referring to the additions of diacritical marks and and vowel marks through the revisions, that's not corruption. They were added so no-one would mispronounce the Quran when they read it. This is what your link says:

&gt;The Arabic script as we know it today was unknown in Muhammad’s time (as Arabic writing styles have progressed through time) and **the Quran was preserved through memorization** and written references on different materials. **As Arab society started to evolve into using writing more regularly, writing skills evolved accordingly. Early Quranic Arabic lacked precision because distinguishing between consonants was impossible due to the absence of diacritical marks (a’jam). Vowelling marks (tashkil) to indicate prolongation or vowels were absent as well.** Due to this there were endless possibilities for the mispronunciation of the word. The Arabic script as we know it today, the scripta plena, which has pointed texts and is fully vowelled was not perfected until the middle of the 9th century.

&gt;Most of the fundamental reform to the manuscripts of the Quran took place under Abd al-Malik, the ﬁfth Umayyad caliph (65/685–86/705).[49] Under Abd al-Malik’s reign, Abu’l Aswad al-Du’ali (died 688) founded the Arabic grammar and **invented the system of placing large colored dots to indicate the tashkil.** The Umayyad governor al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf al-Thaqaﬁ later enforced this system.[50]

&gt;During this time, Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi (died 786) **devised a tashkil system to replace that of Abu al-Aswad.** His system has been universally used since the early 11th century, **and includes six diacritical marks: fatha (a), damma (u), kasra (i), sukun (vowel-less), shadda (double consonant), madda (vowel prolongation; applied to the alif).**

Regarding the critiques, they've been refuted. From your link:

&gt; **It is claimed that such scholars have been proven wrong by subsequent scientific evidence, including carbon dating of early manuscripts of the Quran.** ""**The opening chapters of Fred Donner's Narratives of Islamic Origins: The Beginnings of Islamic Historical Writing claims to refute the theoretical and methodological flaws** of the skeptical school and instead dates the composition of the Quran, as a closed cannon, to an Arabian context of early believers preceding ... the first civil war in 656.""[65] **Donner's perspective now represents mainstream scholarly opinion.**[66] **The findings in 2015 of the Birmingham Manuscripts lead Joseph E. B. Lumbard, Assistant Professor of Classical Islam,
 Brandeis University, to comment:** [67]

&gt;&gt; These recent empirical findings are of fundamental importance. They establish that as regards the broad outlines of the history of the compilation and codification of the Quranic text, the classical Islamic sources are far more reliable than had hitherto been assumed. **Such findings thus render the vast majority of Western revisionist theories regarding the historical origins of the Quran untenable.**

Regarding the Jews:
 
&gt;*Then because of their breaking of their covenant, and their disbelieving in the revelations of Allah, and their slaying of the prophets wrongfully, and their saying: Our hearts are hardened - Nay, but Allah set a seal upon them for their disbelief, so that they believe not save a few* - [4:155]

Regarding the Jews disbelieving in God's miracles regarding Jesus (pbuh) and his mother (**Background info:** God commanded Jesus to speak as a child as a miracle for the Jews and to defend his mothers chastity against them, but they disbelieved in his miracle although they knew Jesus (pbuh) was a messenger of God and Mary (as) was a chaste woman): 

&gt;*And because of their disbelief and of their speaking against Mary a tremendous calumny* [4:156]

The Jews plotted to get Jesus (pbuh) killed, but Allah (swt) planned as well.

&gt;*And they planned and Allah (also) planned, and Allah is the best of planners.* [3:54]

For boasting proudly they killed Jesus (pbuh):

&gt; *And [for] their saying, ""Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah."" And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but so it was made to appear to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain.
Rather, Allah raised him to Himself. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise.* [4:157-158]

Allah (swt) saved him and raised him up to him and purified him of those who blasphemed against him:

&gt;*Behold! Allah said: ""O Jesus! I will take thee and raise thee to Myself and clear thee (of the falsehoods) of those who blaspheme; I will make those who follow thee superior to those who reject faith, to the Day of Resurrection: Then shall ye all return unto me, and I will judge between you of the matters wherein ye dispute.* [3:55]

Quran was written down at the time of the prophet, but hadiths weren't, Wouldn't that mean the companions didn't see it as equal to Qur'an, and therfore not the Thikr in reference?

A newer source from British Oxford Theologian:

&gt;The story of the guard is regarded as implausible, **and so is the final scene in Matthew 28. The command to make 
disciples of all nations and the command to baptize in the name of the Trinity are both probably read back from the later 
church situation**; for, if Jesus Himself had spoken about the Christian mission in the way Matthew suggests, **it is hard to see why the early church should have found the Gentile question such a problem.** And **if Jesus Himself had commanded the use of the Trinitarian formula in baptism, it is hard to explain the evidence of Acts and of Paul, which both indicate that baptism was simply in the name of Jesus during the earliest days.**

&gt;Tertullians On Baptism and Against Praxeas

Tertullian is considered the one who laid the foundations for the Trinity.

&gt;**He is perhaps most famous for being the oldest extant Latin writer to use the term Trinity** (Latin: Trinitas), though a similar word had been used earlier in Greek,[7] and giving the oldest extant formulation of the Trinitarian terminology **later adopted as the modified Nicene Creed at the 2nd Ecumenical Council, the First Council of Constantinople in 381 AD/CE, or as the Athanasian Creed, or both.**

He changed his views and died a Montanist, which the Church viewed as heretical.

&gt;He wrote his trinitarian formula **after becoming a Montanist.**[6] However, unlike many Church fathers, he was never recognized as a saint by the Church...

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertullian

He also stated he believed in Christianity because it was outrageous!

From wiki:

&gt; Baptism was practised ""in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.""[26] **Scholars generally agree that 9:5, which speaks of baptism ""in the name of the Lord,"" represents an earlier tradition that was gradually replaced by a trinity of names.""**

5561,"&gt;Please (and I'm hoping you will) correct me if I'm wrong, but basically in other words, you are saying that being compared to a female would be insulting to them as it removes their masculinity, and thus....being a female is insulting to men? 

Again, drawing conclusions. Comparing most men to a female is emasculating and insulting, not because being a female is insulting, but because they are men! Of course comparing a man who's proud of his manliness and masculinity to a woman is insulting, not insulting to because being a woman is insulting, only **insulting to him specifically**.

&gt;If I wanted to insult a man I wouldn't call him a female version of his name, I don't find that insulting or demeaning cause in my opinion of things men and women are more or less equal (Not saying men are equal to women, but the differences are not so big that I would say men are superior to women).

You don't find it insulting, almost all men would. It has nothing to do with equality, it has to do with a man's innate masculinity that you attempt to degrade by calling him a female name.

Hypothetical situation. You're a woman, you love your femininity, it defines who you are and you're proud of that (like men love their masculinity, it defines who they are and they are proud of that). A man comes up to you because you come off masculine to him and calls you the male equivalent of your name. Are you not going to be offended and insulted (rhetorical question btw)? Does that now mean the man who called you the male equivalent of your name thinks being a man is an insult? Do you see how ludicrous your assertion is?

&gt;But if I see others (like what you did) try to insult a man by calling him a female name, of course I would get insulted and offended because what I understand here is that it's such a horrible thing to be a woman, that the way to put a man down is to call him one.

&gt;The first-century origin of the ossuary is not in question, since the only time Jews buried in that fashion was from approximately 20 BC to the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD. **The dispute centres on the date of origin of the inscription.**

The dispute is regarding when the inscription was written. IIRC, James is considered Jesus' (pbuh) half brother in the NT (I believe Acts?). But according to Christian belief, Jesus (pbuh) didn't speak as a infant to defend his mother's chastity. Instead they claim that Joseph betrothed Maryum (ra) and the Jews believed Jesus (pbuh) to be the son of a human being, Joseph (to protect Maryums (ra) chastity). 

It could be that James was the son of Joseph but from another woman, but was still considered the half brother of Jesus (pbuh) by the later Christian community (on purpose or by mistake believing he was actually Maryums (ra) son) hence the inscription.

&gt;This formula is perhaps a reflection of the liturgical usage of the writer's own time.

From *The Jerusalem Bible* in NT section, Page 45 under Matthew 28:19 ([link to read](http://imgur.com/AQrb9th))

&gt;There is a court of last appeal before which the genuineness of the baptismal formula in Matt. 28: 19 has not yet been brought. Mr. Conybeare showed in the Hibbert Journal for 1903, pp. I02-8, **that 
there is important external evidence against the existence of this formula in manuscripts current before the time of Eusebius**, and various recent writers have urged that **the practice of baptism in Acts and the epistles of Paul is utterly incompatible with the view that 
Jesus commanded his disciples to baptize into the name of the Father 
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit...**

&gt;The second point to be observed in the use of names in the baptismal formula is the position of the word ""Son."" It is obvious that the location of this word between ""Father"" and ""Holy Spirit"" is 
virtually a claim that the Son stands on the same level with them. The position takes him up, as it were, into the very center of the Deity. **But to this claim the words of Jesus in our oldest sources stand opposed. Unique and divine as is their claim regarding the character of the Master-a claim as fully involved in his life as in his words-they not only never contain a claim like that of the baptismal 
formula, but in the clearest, most unambiguous terms assert what is diametrically opposed to the implication of that passage**. They 
assert manhood, they deny attributes of Deity (e. g., omniscience and absolute goodness). **Therefore it is impossible to hold that the Jesus of the Synoptic Gospels can have spoken the words of the baptismal formula...**

From *The Baptismal Formula of Matthew 28:19, in the Light of Jesus' Unquestionable Teaching by George Holley Gilbert Ph.D., D.D* (link to read full doc: https://archive.org/details/jstor-3141606).

Regarding Eusebius who Dr. Gilbert brings up in the above citation:

&gt;Eusebius of Caesarea (/juːˈsiːbiəs/; Greek: Εὐσέβιος, Eusébios; ad 260/265 – 339/340), also known as Eusebius Pamphili, **was a Roman historian, exegete, and Christian polemicist of Greek descent.** He became the bishop of Caesarea Maritima about 314. Together with Pamphilus, **he was a scholar of the Biblical canon and is regarded as an extremely well learned Christian of his time.**[1]

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusebius

In one of his works is called *Demonstratio Evangelica(Proof of the Gospel)* which he finished around 311, he quotes Matthew 28:19 on Page 152 which doesn't contain the current baptismal formula ([link to read](http://imgur.com/Zhxh9oA)):

&gt;With one word and voice He said to His disciples: **""Go, and make disciples of all the nations** ***in My Name,*** **teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you**,"" and He joined the effect to His Word ; and in a little while every race of the Greeks and Barbarians was being brought into discipleship, and laws were spread among all nations opposed to the superstition of the 
ancients, laws inimical to daemons, and to all the deceits of polytheism, laws that have made Scythians, Persians, 
and the other barbarians temperate, and revolutionized every lawless and uncivilized custom, laws that have over- turned the immemorial habits of the Greeks themselves, (b) and heralded a new and real religion.

Also Wilhelm Bousset, a German theologian and New Testament scholar writes in his book *Kryios Christos* Page 299([link to Read](http://imgur.com/rl4AjhZ))
:

&gt; The testimony for the wide distribution of the simple baptismal formula down into the second century is so overwhelming that on this basis Conybeare's surmise acquires high probability, **that even in Matt. 28: 19 the trinitarian formula was only later inserted...**

5580,"&gt;I'm still confused about the meaning of the word, so either you're calling me stupid or you didn't explain what the word means.

No, I'm assuming you read the link:

&gt;Wali, in the Arabic language, has a wide set of meanings, none of which are used to simply mean “buddy, pal or acquaintance”, the way that we would use the term “friend” in modern times to denote our casual relationships with colleagues at work, peers at school or neighbors.  In an everyday reading of the Qu’ran, after reading this question initially, I came across the word wali and its various derivatives multiple times; sometimes it meant “guardian”, other times, “discharger of affairs or executor”, or “protector and ally”, and even “inheritor”.  “Friendship” can be included in this, but walaa’ is a type of intimate and extremely loyal bond that is not used for everyday friendships in Arabic.  Allah calls Himself a wali of the believers and also calls Himself by its derivative, al-Maula, which roughly means “the Patron”.  It gives a sense of one party standing protectively over the other, or fully backing and sponsoring them.

.

&gt;Let me ask my question again in case you missed it:

Irrelevant questions with regards to what the word means and the verse we're talking about. If you want to talk history, I'm not the one to talk to. I'm simply responding to your original question before you went on a tryade, which was:

&gt;What is the correct meaning of that word?

.

&gt;So I don't understand what the prohibition against awliya forbids a Muslim from doing.

*Awliya*, in a general definition, means allies or protectors. That's all the word means. 

In context of 5:51, it's stating to not take Jews and Christians as protectors and allies, who are only allies and protectors of each other and cooperate in harming Muslims. 

The verse isn't stating that **all** Jews and Christians are always allies of each other **all** the time and are trying to harm Muslims and Islam. 

It's an ""if/when, then"" type of situation. If/when they do that, than its forbidden for you to take them as *awliya* (gaurdians, protectors, allies).

If they are not in that category of people from *ahl ul-Kitab*, then that verse isn't speaking of them and you can make allegiances with them.

Hope that explained it for you.

three that bear witness in earth"" (1 John 5.7-8, King James Version). **Erasmus replied that he had not found any Greek manuscript that contained these words...**

in manuscripts of the Latin Vulgate before about A.D. 800.**

From *The Text of the New Testament by Bruce Metzger* Page 146-148.

It's totally fine to believe the Trinity, although it's contradictory nature, by faith.

5591,"&gt; The meanings of ""Do not follow that of which you have no knowledge"" are very comprehensive. It demands that both in individual and collective life, one should not follow mere guess work and presumption instead of ""knowledge"". This instruction covers all aspects of Islamic life, moral, legal, political, administrative and applies to science, arts and education. It has thus saved the society from numerous evils which are produced in human life by following guesswork instead of knowledge. The Islamic moral code demands: Guard against suspicion and do not accuse any individual or group without proper investigation. In law, it has been made a permanent principle that no action should be taken against anyone without proper investigation. It has been made unlawful to arrest, beat or imprison anyone on mere suspicion during investigation. In regard to foreign relations, the definite policy has been laid down that no action should be taken without investigation, nor should rumours be set afloat. Likewise in education the so-called sciences based on mere guess-work, presumptions and irrational theories have been disapproved. Above all, it cuts at the very root of superstitions, for this instruction teaches the Believers to accept only that which is based on the knowledge imparted by Allah and His Messenger. 

*Tafheem ul - Qur'an*

&gt; Idle curiosity may lead us to nose into evil, through our ignorance that it is evil. 

&gt;We must guard against every such danger. We must only hear the things that are known to us to be of good report, and see things that are good and instructive and entertain in our hearts feelings or in our minds ideas that we have reason to expect will be spiritually profitable to us. 
We shall be called to account for the exercise of every faculty that has been given to us. 

&gt;This goes a little farther than a famous sculpture on a Japanese temple in which three monkeys are shown as putting their hands to their ears, eyes, and mouths, respectively, to show that they were not prepared to hear any evil, or see any evil, or speak any evil. 

&gt;Here idle curiosity is condemned. Futility is to be avoided even if it does not reach the degree of positive evil.

&gt;**The Gospel of Mark is anonymous.**[6] A persistent tradition which begins in the early 2nd century with bishop Papias (c.AD 125) ascribes it to Mark the Evangelist, a companion and interpreter of the apostle Peter, but most **modern scholars do not accept Papias' claim** &amp;.[7] The book was probably written c.AD 66–70, during Nero's persecution of the Christians in Rome or the Jewish revolt, as suggested by internal references to war in Judea and to persecution.[8] **The author used a variety of sources derived from accounts predating the gospel's composition, such as conflict stories (Mark 2:1-3:6), apocalyptic discourse (4:1-35), and collections of sayings (although not the Gospel of Thomas and probably not the Q source)**.[9]

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Mark

Matthew is pseudo anonymous.

&gt;**The Gospel of Matthew is anonymous**: the author is not named within the text, and the superscription ""according to Matthew"" was added some time in the second century.[12][13]

 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Matthew

Luke is speculative.

&gt; **The author is not named in either volume.** [6] According to a Church tradition dating from the 2nd century, he was the Luke named as a companion of Paul in three of the letters attributed to Paul himself, **but ""a critical consensus emphasizes the countless contradictions between the account in Acts and the authentic Pauline letters**.""[7] 

He borrowed off of the pseudo anonymous Gospel of Mark, Q source as well as other works.

&gt;The author is thought to have used as his sources the gospel of Mark, the sayings collection called the Q source, and a collection of material called the L (for Luke) source.[5]

&gt;Mark and Q account for about 64% of Luke.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Luke

John is pseudo anonymous.

&gt; **The Gospel of John is anonymous**; Church tradition identified the ""beloved disciple"" mentioned in John 21:24 as the author and named him (John the evangelist), **but this is rejected by the majority of modern scholars.**

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_John

The Act of the Apostles is said to be written by the same person who wrote the Gospel of Luke but is still speculative.

&gt; The author is not named in either volume.[8] According to Church tradition dating from the 2nd century, **he was the ""Luke"" named as a companion of the apostle Paul in three of the letters** attributed to Paul himself; this view is still sometimes advanced, **but ""a critical consensus emphasizes the countless contradictions between the account in Acts and the authentic Pauline letters**.""

 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_the_Apostles

The Epistle of James is speculative and has multiple views concerning it, one being pseudo anonymous. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistle_of_James

First Epistle of Peter is pseudo anonymous.

&gt; The authorship of 1 Peter has traditionally been attributed to the Apostle Peter because it bears his name and identifies him as its author (1:1). **Although the text identifies Peter as its author the language, dating, style, and structure of this letter has led many scholars to conclude that this letter is pseudonymous.**

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Epistle_of_Peter

Second Epistle of Peter is pseudonymous.

&gt;Most biblical scholars have concluded Peter is not the author, considering the epistle pseudepigraphical.

 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Epistle_of_Peter

The First, Second and Third Epistle of John are considered to be written by the same author of the Gospel of John, which is pseudo anonymous.

&gt; Indeed, at the end of the 19th century scholar Ernest DeWitt Burton wrote that **there could be ""no reasonable doubt"" that 1 John and the gospel were written by the same author**,[3] and Amos Wilder has said that, ""Early Christian tradition and the great **majority of modern scholars have agreed on the common authorship of these writings**, even where the author has not been identified with the apostle John.""[4]

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Epistle_of_John

Epistle of Jude is speculative.

&gt;The debate has continued over the author's identity as the apostle, the brother of Jesus, both, or neither.

 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistle_of_Jude

Seven of the Pauline Epistle are considered Genuine by scholars to actually be written by Paul. They are First Thessalonians, Galatians, First Corinthians, Philippians, Philemon
Second Corinthians and Romans.

The rest are considered pseudepigraphic (not Paul) which are First Timothy, Second Timothy, Titus and Ephesians.

Colossians and Second Thessalonians are disputed and divided.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_epistles

Epistle to Hebrews is anonymous.

&gt; At present, neither modern scholarship nor church teaching ascribes Hebrews to Paul.

&gt;Because of its anonymity, it had some trouble being accepted as part of the Christian canon...

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistle_to_the_Hebrews

Revelations is basically anonymous as well.

&gt;**The author names himself as ""John"", but it is extremely unlikely that the author of Revelation was also the author of the Gospel of John**. Some of the evidence for this was set out as early as the second half of the 3rd century by Dionysius of Alexandria, who noted that the gospel and the epistles attributed to John, unlike Revelation, do not name their author, and that the Greek of the gospel is correct and elegant while that of Revelation is neither; some later scholars believe that the two books also have radical differences in theological perspective.[6] **Tradition links him to John the Apostle, but it is unlikely that the apostle could have lived into the most likely time for the book's composition, the reign of Domitian, and the author never states that he knew Jesus.**[7] All that is known is that this John was a Jewish Christian prophet, probably belonging to a group of such prophets, and was accepted as such by the congregations to whom he addresses his letter.[8][9] **His precise identity remains unknown**,[10] and modern scholarship commonly refers to him as John of Patmos.

I haven't read his work. Are you implying a Christian writing about Islam and the Qur'an is not going to be biased? Everyone is biased buddy. It's like referring you to a Muslim scholar who writes about the Bible and Christianity. Of course I'd still love for you to summarize his arguments and his evidences for those arguments.

&gt; This is hand-waving at its finest. You don't like the conclusion of some scholars, so you try to figure out a way to bracket off their research. 

Quite funny, coming from someone who hand selected conspiracists, John Wansbrough who believes Muhammad (pbuh) is a manufactured myth, and Patricia Crone who once argued Muhammad (pbuh) doesn't even exist before retracting! I'm definitely the one hand waving. 

&gt;But I can explain why Richard Carrier and other Jesus mythicists are wrong and I don't have to appeal to their religious convictions to do so. I can explain why, on purely historical grounds, their position is absurd. 

And if you had supplied me with arguments from your sources, I would have refuted them. It wouldn't be hard to refute your hand picked individuals, one who believes the Quran was compiled centuries after Muhammad's (pbuh) death and argues no Jews were present in Hijaz despite historical info. Then the other asserts the opposite, that the Quran was in conversation with mostly Jews and Christians. Quite conflicting sources. Also, your source believes Hadith were invented. If hadith which have *isnad* or chains of narrators authenticated back to the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) are invented, what are we going to say about the pseudo anonymous Gospels which have no chain of narrators leading to Jesus (pbuh)? In any ase, for a brief overview of how Hadith are authenticated read this:

&gt; On purely historical grounds, it's not absurd to doubt what we can know about Muhammad. I think someone in the 7th century existed who had something to do with nascent Islam whose name was Muhammad. That's about all we can know.

Not true, simple Google search under 'Non Muslim Sources':

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Muhammad

Also to add a few things from the link:

&gt;F.E. Peters states, **""Few have failed to be convinced that what is in our copy of the Quran is, in fact, what Muhammad taught, and is expressed in his own words... To sum this up: the Quran is convincingly the words of Muhammad, perhaps even dictated by him after their recitation"".[10] Peters argues that ""The search for variants in the partial versions extant before the Caliph Uthman’s alleged recension in the 640s (what can be called the 'sources' behind our text) has not yielded any differences of great significance."" .[10]**

Your claim that the Quran is the work of many is a minority view. Even your source Patricia Crone says:

&gt;She says we can be ""reasonably sure"" in **attributing all or most of the Qur'an to him.**

Also, regarding Crone and Cook from the link:

&gt;Patricia Crone and Michael Cook challenge the traditional account of how the Qur'an was compiled writing that ""there is no hard evidence for the existence of the Koran in any form before the last decade of the seventh century."" They also question the accuracy of some the Qur'an's historical accounts.[11] **It is generally acknowledged that the work of Crone and Cook was a fresh approach in its reconstruction of early Islamic history, but their alternative account of early Islam has been almost universally rejected.**[12] Van Ess has dismissed it stating that ""**a refutation is perhaps unnecessary since the authors make no effort to prove it in detail...Where they are only giving a new interpretation of well-known facts, this is not decisive. But where the accepted facts are consciously put upside down, their approach is disastrous**.""[13] R. B. Serjeant states: **""Hagarism [the thesis of Crone and Cook]...is not only bitterly anti-Islamic in tone, but anti-Arabian. Its superficial fancies are so ridiculous that at first one wonders if it is just a ‘leg pull’, pure ’spoof’.""[14]**

Read that? **Universally Rejected**. 

&gt;***...but their alternative account of early Islam has been almost universally rejected.***

Read what's next? No need to refute!

&gt;***a refutation is perhaps unnecessary since the authors make no effort to prove it in detail...***

Regarding John Wansbrough:

&gt; Herbert Berg writes that ""Despite John Wansbrough's very cautious and careful inclusion of qualifications such as ""conjectural,"" and ""tentative and emphatically provisional"", **his work is condemned by some.** Some of this negative reaction is undoubtedly due to its radicalness...**Wansbrough's work has been embraced wholeheartedly by few** and has been employed in a piecemeal fashion by many.

This means that the parts of the Qur’an that are written on this parchment can, with a degree of confidence, be dated to less than two decades after Muhammad’s death. These portions must have been in a form that is very close to the form of the Qur’an read today, supporting the view that the text has undergone little or no alteration and that it can be dated to a point very close to the time it was believed to be revealed.

Not much to defend, actually supports Muslims claim that the Quran is the same today as back then.

5613,"&gt;There's simply no comparison between IGoT and the canonical gospels. In IGoT, Jesus is running around murdering other children.

Again, all I stated was just because it's something is stated in a non-canonized Gospel, doesn't mean it's false. 

&gt;The Quran makes no concrete statements about a second coming of Jesus.

Yes it does. 

&gt;*And indeed, Jesus will be [a sign for] knowledge of the Hour, so be not in doubt of it, and follow Me. This is a straight path.* [43:61]

Exegesis:

&gt; This is understood to refer to the second coming of Jesus in the Last Days before the Resurrection, when he will destroy the false doctrines that pass under his name, and prepare the way for the universal acceptance of Islam, the Gospel of Unity and Peace, the Straight 
Way of the Quran.

&gt;The Hadiths are entirely ad hoc explanations of obscure Qur'anic passages. Read the work of someone like John Wansbrough or Gabriel Reynolds.

Completely untrue. His sources are hand selected conspiracists like Patricia Crone who believed Muhammad  (pbuh) didn't exist, and John Wansbrough who believes Muhammad (pbuh) is a manufactured myth. Analogous to Jesus (pbuh) not existing conspiracists who are easily refuted. For brief overview of how Hadith are authenticated read this:

5614,"&gt;You were literally just defending the possible truthfulness of gospels we have that were written way later than the earliest gospels (specifically the possible truthfulness of a gospel that shows no knowledge whatsoever of anything resembling Jewish culture) and now you're saying the earliest gospels definitely have nothing to do with the message actually given to Jesus.

What I actually said:

&gt;I'd like to point out, if something is not mentioned in the canonized Gospels does not mean it's incorrect or did not occur.

Wasn't arguing for for its truthfulness. Merely refuting your stance that because it's in the Gospel of Thomas and not in the canonized Gospels, it's unequivocally not true.

&gt;Nothing about Jesus being born, being raised into heaven, appearing on earth again, dying during the second time he is on earth, and being resurrected from the dead like the Christians say he was already resurrected from the dead except where here you're just saying it's gonna happen in the future. (And saying you're saying it because of 43:61. Which doesn't say that.)

Maybe you were confused, let me quote the verses again.

&gt; *And peace is on me the day I was born* ***and the day I will die*** *and the day I am raised alive*."" [19:33]

Here Jesus (pbuh) says, peace is on him the day he was born (past tense), the day he dies (future tense, in his second coming, see [43:61] ), and the day he is raised alive (Resurrection/Judgement Day when we are all raised alive). 

A similar statement is just a few verses before, with regards to John the Baptist (pbuh) but here God is speaking:

&gt;*And peace be upon him the day he was born and the day he dies and the day he is raised alive.* [19:15]

5616,"Oh boy, what a misinformed post. For anyone who read that and wants clarification.

&gt; There's a lot going on in all this, for example we know the author of the Quran had been exposed to The Infancy Gospel of Thomas because of the story included in the Quran about the clay birds coming to life.

Id like to point out, if something is not mentioned in the canonized Gospels does not mean it's incorrect or did not occur. But believe what you will. 

&gt;Also, I had to go find it but surah 5:46 makes no sense:

The verse:

&gt;*And We sent after them in their footsteps Isa, son of Marium, verifying what was before him of the Taurat and We gave him the Injeel in which was guidance and light, and verifying what was before it of Taurat and a guidance and an admonition for those who guard (against evil).*

Your objections:

&gt; The gospels proclaim the sonship of Christ. Most Christians would argue the go as far as to proclaim Christ is God on earth.

&gt;Beyond that, the Quran otherwise simply contradicts the gospels over and over.

&gt;Therefore, the gospel cannot be both guidance and light etc. and all of its actual contents be condemned by the Quran. That's also total nonsense.

The Injeel (Gospel) the Qur'an is referring to, is the *oral* revelation given to Jesus (pbuh). Not the Gospel*s* (plural) Matthew, Mark, Luke and John written decades after. Jesus (pbuh) wasn't carrying around Mark and reading from it. The Qur'an is speaking about the Gospel according to Jesus, which was verbatim the word of God from his lips, which we don't have.

&gt; I forgot this one, 9:33 has the baby Jesus saying:

The verse is actually [19:33]:

&gt; *And peace is on me the day I was born* ***and the day I will die*** *and the day I am raised alive*.""

Your objection:

&gt; This contradicts the Quran itself. Elsewhere in the Quran, Jesus never dies and therefore is not raised from the dead. 5:157-158 reads:

It's actually [4:157-158]: 

&gt;*And [for] their saying, ""Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah."" And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but so it was made to appear to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain.*

&gt;*Rather, Allah raised him to Himself. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise.*

Now, [19:33] is future tense so he didn't die, but Jesus (pbuh) will die in his second coming. Peace on him the day he was born, the day *he will die* (second coming), and the day he is raised alive (Judgement/Resurrection Day).

&gt;*And indeed, Jesus will be [a sign for] knowledge of the Hour, so be not in doubt of it, and follow Me. This is a straight path.* [43:61]

&gt; *Verily, those who [despite all evidence] are bent on denying the truth - [be they] from among the followers of earlier revelation or from among those who ascribe divinity to aught beside God 
- will find themselves in the fire of hell, therein to abide: they are the worst of all creatures.* [98:6] 

Which is not in regards to all Christian's, rather those who know Islam is true, yet are bent on denying. The word used is *Kafaru*, which means to cover up, conceal etc. Most Christian's do not fall under this category as most Christian's aren't even aware of core Islamic principles except hearsay.

Exegesis for [98:6]; 

&gt;To be given the faculty of discrimination between right and wrong, and then to reject truth and right, is the worst folly which a creature endowed with will can commit. 

&gt;It must necessarily bring its own punishment, whether the creature calls himself one of the children of Abraham 
or one of the redeemed of Christ, or whether he goes by the mere light of nature and reason as a Pagan. Honour 
in the sight of Allah is not due to race or colour, but to sincere and righteous conduct (49:13). 

*Tafsir Abdullah Yusuf*

.

&gt; *[And] fight against those who - despite having been vouchsafed revelation [aforetime] - do not [truly] believe either in God or the Last Day, and do not consider forbidden that which God and His Apostle have forbidden, and do not follow the upon them] till they [agree to] pay the exemption tax (Jizyah) with a willing hand, after having been humbled.* [9:29] 

Exegesis:

&gt; *Jizyah: the root meaning is compensation.* ; The derived meaning, which became the technical meaning, was a poll-tax levied from those who did not accept Islam, but were willing to live under the protection of Islam, and were thus tacitly willing to submit to its ideals being enforced in the Muslim State. 
There was no amount permanently fixed for it. It was in acknowledgment that those whose religion was tolerated 
would in their turn not interfere with the preaching and progress of Islam.

5643,"&gt; What is the Qur’anic understanding of Prophets before Muhammad (Noah, Abraham, Moses &amp; Jesus etc.) and the scriptures given to these Prophets?

They were sent to nations and preached monotheism, many were denied and some were annihilated. 

Noah (pbuh): 

&gt;*The people of Noah rejected the truth before them: they rejected Our servant, saying, 'He is mad!' Noah was rebuked, and so he called upon his Lord, 'I am defeated: help me!' ""So We opened the gates of the sky with torrential water, burst the earth with gushing springs: the waters met for a preordained purpose. We carried him along on a vessel of planks and nails that floated under Our watchful eye, a reward for the one who had been rejected. We have left this' as a sign: will anyone take heed? How [terrible] was My punishment and [the fulfilment of] My warnings!* [54:9-16]

Hud (pbuh):

&gt;*The people of 'Ad also rejected the truth. How [terrible] was My punishment and [the fulfilment of] My warnings! ""We released a howling wind against them on a day of terrible disaster; it swept people away like uprooted palm trunks. How [terrible] was My punishment and [the fulfilment of] My warnings!* [54:18-21]

Salih (pbuh): 

&gt; *The people of Thamud also rejected the warnings: they said, 'What? A man? Why should we follow a lone man from amongst ourselves? That would be misguided; quite insane! Would a message be given to him alone out of all of us? No, he is an insolent liar!' 'Tomorrow they will know who is the insolent liar, ""for We shall send them a she-camel to test them: so watch them [Salih] and be patient. Tell them the water is to be shared between them:"" each one should drink in turn.' But they called their companion, who took a sword and hamstrung the camel. How [terrible] was My punishment and [the fulfilment of] My warnings! We released a single mighty blast against them and they ended up like a fence-maker's dry sticks.* [54:23-31]

Moses (pbuh) was given the Torah:

&gt;*And indeed We gave Musa (Moses) the Scripture [the Taurat (Torah)], and placed his brother Harun (Aaron) with him as a helper.* [25:35]
 
But the Jews corrupted it:

&gt; *No just estimate of Allah do they make when they say: ""Nothing doth Allah send down to man (by way of revelation)"": Say: ""Who then sent down the Book which Moses brought? a light and guidance to man: but ye make it into (separate) sheets for show while ye conceal much (of its contents): therein were ye taught that which ye knew not neither ye nor your fathers."" Say: ""Allah (sent it down)"": then leave them to plunge in vain discourse and trifling.*[6:91]

&gt;*Can ye (O ye men of Faith) entertain the hope that they will believe in you? Seeing that a party of them heard the word of Allah and perverted it knowingly after they understood it*. [2:75]

Jesus (pbuh) was given the Gospel:

&gt;*And We caused Jesus, son of Mary, to follow in their footsteps, confirming that which was (revealed) before him in the Torah, and We bestowed on him the Gospel wherein is guidance and a light, confirming that which was (revealed) before it in the Torah - a guidance and an admonition unto those who ward off (evil).* [5:46]

And it was corrupted:

&gt;*From those too who call themselves Christians We did take a Covenant but they forgot a good part of the Message that was sent them: so We estranged them with enmity and hatred between the one and the other to the Day of Judgment. And soon will Allah show them what it is they have done.* [5:14]

Some corruption was unintentional, and some was intentional:

&gt;*Then woe to those who write the Book with their own hands and then say: ""This is from Allah"" to traffic with it for a miserable price! Woe to them for what their hands do write and for the gain they make thereby*. [2:79]

.

&gt;What do Muslims believe regarding these Prophets and how do they fit in with the basic Islamic message of One God?


They were all Prophets who preached monotheism and to worship God alone and we make no distinction between them.

&gt; *Say, [O believers], ""We have believed in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what has been revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Descendants and what was given to Moses and Jesus and what was given to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.""* [2:136]

For Jesus (pbuh), Muslims don't believe he died and was saved from crucifixion:

&gt; *And [for] their saying, ""Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah ."" And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain.* [4:157]

Allah (swt) raised him up to himself:

&gt; *Behold! Allah said: ""O Jesus! I will take thee and raise thee to Myself and clear thee (of the falsehoods) of those who blaspheme; I will make those who follow thee superior to those who reject faith, to the Day of Resurrection: Then shall ye all return unto me, and I will judge between you of the matters wherein ye dispute.* [3:55]",2016-03-05 00:41:23+00:00,d0o12hj,1.0,t3_4901p1,2858.0,islam

The Qur'an about the nation of Lut (pbuh):

&gt;*And [We had sent] Lot when he said to his people, ""Do you commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with from among the worlds? Indeed, you approach men with desire, instead of women. Rather, you are a transgressing people.""*  [7:80-81]

The Qur'an doesn't speak about the capital punishment for engaging in sodomy, the Hadith do. The capital punishment is carried out the same way for sodomy as with adultery which is stoning. You need four *reliable* witnesses to testify the act, if not, you can't be convicted.  The four witnesses also most be truthful and reliable, must not have been spying on you etc. The criteria for the witnesses to be valid is strict in of itself. A plethora of reasons can disqualify you as a valid witness in court. It's almost impossible to get four valid witnesses who saw you having sodomy or adultery, unless ofcourse you displayed it in public or by confessing it yourself four times. 

The Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) urged people to conceal their sins and repent to Allah (swt) so the capital punishment would not be carried out.

Because you underestimate Allahs (swt) justice. Allah (swt) knows everyone's deepest secrets and thoughts, they are all known to him. You can be Muslim by name, or Christian, Jew, Hindu etc. but Allah (swt) knows everything that you hide. 

How many Muslims are hypocrites but we will never know? How many Christian's struggle their whole life to find *yaqeen*(conviction) while not knowing of Islam, we will never know? How many Hindus don't believe their religion but don't know anything else, we will never know? 

But Allah (swt) knows while we don't. Those secrets weigh more than the vain speech that you utter by saying ""I'm a Muslim"" or ""I'm a Christian"" etc while your heart doubts or says otherwise.

Worry about yourself, Allah (swt) knows best who deserves Hell.

&gt;So by your Lord! We will most certainly gather them together and the Shaitans, then shall We certainly cause them to be present round hell on their knees.

&gt;Then We will most certainly draw forth from every sect of them him who is most exorbitantly rebellious against the Beneficent Allah.

In Arabic, the word used is **وَجَدَهَا** which means ""He saw it/He preceived it/He found it."" From Zul-Qarnains POV, the sun appeared to set into the water. An analogy would be, while I was at the beach, from my POV, the Sun appeared to be setting into the water. 

Next verse:

Again, the word used here is **وَجَدَهَا**. While traveling, Zul-Qarnain found the sun rising on a people from another village.

5701,"&gt;Sa`id bin Jubayr, As-Suddi and others said that; these Ayat were revealed concerning a delegation that An-Najashi (King of Ethiopia) sent to the Prophet in 
order to hear his words and observe his qualities. 

&gt;When the delegation met with the Prophet and he recited the Qur'an to them, they embraced Islam, cried and 
were humbled. Then they returned to An-Najashi and told him what happened. 

&gt;Ata bin Abi Rabah commented, ""They were Ethiopians who embraced Islam when the Muslims who migrated to Ethiopia resided among them.'' 

&gt;Qatadah said, ""They were some followers of the religion of `Isa, son of Maryam, who when they saw Muslims and heard the Qur'an, they became Muslims without hesitation.'' 

&gt;Ibn Jarir said that; these Ayat were revealed concerning some people who 
fit this description, whether they were from Ethiopia or otherwise.

&gt;Allah said: 

&gt;&gt;Verily, you will find the strongest among men in enmity 
to the believers the Jews and those who commit Shirk, 

&gt;This describes the Jews, since their disbelief is that of rebellion, defiance, opposing the truth, belittling other, people and degrading the scholars. This is why the Jews - may Allah's continued curses descend on them until the Day 
of Resurrection - killed many of their Prophets and tried to kill the Messenger of Allah several times, as well as, performing magic spells against 
him and poisoning him. They also incited their likes among the polytheists against the Prophet. 

&gt;Allah's statement: 

&gt;&gt;and you will find the nearest in love to the believers those who say: ""We are Christians.'' 

&gt;refers to those who call themselves Christians, who follow the religion of the Messiah and the teachings of his Injil. These people are generally more tolerant of Islam and its people, because of 
the mercy and kindness that their hearts acquired through part of the Messiah's religion.

&gt;In another Ayah, Allah said; 

&gt;&gt;And We ordained in the hearts of those who followed him, compassion, mercy, and monasticism... (57:27) 

&gt;In their book is the saying; ""He who strikes you on the right cheek, then turn the left cheek for him.'' 

&gt;And fighting was prohibited in their creed, and this is why Allah said,

&gt;&gt;That is because among them are Qissisin (priests) and Ruhban (monks), and they are not proud. 

&gt;This means that among them are Qissisin (priests). The word Ruhban refers to one dedicated to worship. 

&gt;Allah said, 

&gt;&gt;That is because among them are priests and monks, and they are not proud. 

&gt;This describes them with knowledge, worship and humbleness, along with following the truth and fairness.

&gt;In assessing these readings, critics evaluate the history of a passage in light of Inherent or Intrinsic Probability and of Transmissional or Transcriptional Probability. **To put this in a single sentence, Inherent Probability concerns itself with what the author is most likely to have written (or what a particular critic thinks the author is most likely to 
have written), while Transcriptional Probability studies what a scribe might have done to that reading.**

&gt; To put that in something more like English, Intrinsic Probability looks at what the author is saying at a particular point, **and tries to make sense of the variant in that context; it also looks at the author’s style and outlook, and tries looks for the reading which is more typical of the way the author thinks and writes**. 

&gt;Kirsopp Lake and Silva New, describing it under its other name of Intrinsic Probability, defined It this way: the necessity “**first to consider which of the two or more variants makes the best sense; which is most in accordance with the general style of the author, and so on; which, in short, the author is most likely to have written.**

&gt; All the works that eventually became incorporated into the New Testament seem to have been written no later than around 150 AD...

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament

&gt;John is usually dated to 90-110 CE.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_John

&gt;The book was probably written c.AD 66–70 (Mark)

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Mark

Also, read Mark and compare with John, and notice the development of Jesus' (pbuh) divinity.

&gt; The Gospel of John presents a ""**high Christology"", depicting Jesus as divine**, and yet subordinate to the one God.

&gt; **In the synoptics, Jesus speaks often about the Kingdom of God; his own divine role is obscured (see Messianic secret). In John, Jesus talks openly about his divine role. He says, for example, that he is the way, the truth, and the life.[14:6] He echoes Yahweh's own statements with several ""I am"" declarations that also identify him with symbols of major significance.**

5719,"First, understand what you have now was written 50-70 years after Jesus (pbuh). Through all those years, Jesus (pbuh) was exaggerated. You can notice that from Mark to John, how John exaggerates Jesus to a level Mark did not. Mark and John are only 20 years apart. Mark was written 50 years after Jesus (pbuh) and also contains immense exaggerations. So even if the Gospels (Mark, Matthew, Luke and John) were copied perfectly, they're still corruptions of Jesus' (pbuh) original message and is anything but the verbatim word of God, that is the original Injeel.

Secondly, Bible scholars play a guessing game of what to put in the Bible. It's all a probability of trying to reconstruct the original Gospels of Mark, Matthew, Luke and John.

Third, it's agreed upon that John 5:7 is fabrication.  As well as the ending of Mark, and the story of Jesus(pbuh) and the adulterous. There's plenty more. ",2016-02-23 21:29:12+00:00,d0b3i7a,3.0,t1_d0b2teq,832.0,islam
5720,"&gt;The Injeel is what Jesus taught not what is necessarily what is written in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John; from an Islamic view that is.

The original Injeel would be a whole book, of only Jesus' (pbuh) speech. But not even that since Jesus (pbuh) could be speaking but it wouldn't necessarily be revelation. If you read a red print Bible, what Jesus says makes up almost nothing of the Bible. 

&gt;At the time of Muhammed the Injeel was uncorrupted

Incorrect.

**Surat l-Baqarah**

&gt;[75] Do you then hope that they would believe in you, and a party from among them indeed used to hear the Word of Allah, then altered it after they had understood it, and they know (this).

&gt;[78] And there are among them illiterates, who know not the Book, but (see therein their own) desires, and they do nothing but conjecture.

2:78 points out how, after Jesus' (pbuh) ascension, illiterate folks did not know the Injeel, but only made up things for their own vain desires and followed nothing but conjecture. What you have know of the Gospels, was in fact merely conjecture and hearsay for 50-70 years. Not only that, but even your current Gospels develop from Mark to John and those were 20 years apart. I can only imagine  the development of Jesus' (pbuh) story for the 50 years before Mark.

Continuing:

&gt;[79] So woe to those who write the ""scripture"" with their own hands, then say, ""This is from Allah ,"" in order to exchange it for a small price. Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn.

**Surat l-An'aam**

&gt;[91] No just estimate of Allah do they make when they say: ""Nothing doth Allah send down to man (by way of revelation)"": Say: ""Who then sent down the Book which Moses brought? a light and guidance to man: but ye make it into (separate) sheets for show while ye conceal much (of its contents): therein were ye taught that which ye knew not neither ye nor your fathers."" Say: ""Allah (sent it down)"": then leave them to plunge in vain discourse and trifling.

&gt;[93] **And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about Allah or says, ""It has been inspired to me,"" while nothing has been inspired to him, and one who says, ""I will reveal [something] like what Allah revealed."" And if you could but see when the wrongdoers are in the overwhelming pangs of death while the angels extend their hands, [saying], ""Discharge your souls! Today you will be awarded the punishment of [extreme] humiliation for what you used to say against Allah other than the truth and [that] you were, toward His verses, being arrogant.""**

6:93 to me stands out to me to be speaking of Paul, the writer of most of the NT.

**Surat l-Ma'ida**

&gt;[13] But because of their breach of their Covenant We cursed them and made their hearts grow hard: they change the words from their (right) places and forget a good part of the Message that was sent them nor wilt thou cease to find them barring a few ever bent on (new) deceits: but forgive them and overlook (their misdeeds): for Allah loveth those who are kind.

&gt;[14] From those too who call themselves Christians We did take a Covenant but they forgot a good part of the Message that was sent them: so We estranged them with enmity and hatred between the one and the other to the Day of Judgment. And soon will Allah show them what it is they have done.

Lets quote your scripture again:

&gt;[11] And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie

5733,"The laughing part is found in a few non-canonical gnostic texts and isn't brought up in any Islamic sources. I just wanted to point out the fact that there were early Christian sources which claimed that Jesus (pbuh) did not die. Ebionites are one sect who believed Jesus (pbuh) did not die and was a prophet. 

Also, Jesus (pbuh) did not *let* someone else die, Allah (swt) made it appear to the persecutors that it was Jesus (pbuh), when it was not him. We don't know who that person was or if he even died. The Quran just says the didnt kill him or crucify him. The Qur'an also points out people were throwing accusations and blasepheming against Jesus (pbuh) and Allah (swt) could have made the replacement one of the false accusers.  

The main point in Islamic theology is Jesus (pbuh) did not die and wasn't crucified, it only appeared so. The Jews planned to mock, torture and kill Allah's (swt) Messiah, and Allah (swt) didn't let it happen.

Muslim men have certain specific obligations ordained by Allah (swt) towards their wives. He can marry a Christian or Jewish woman, and those obligations he still must fulfill towards his wife (even though she isn't Muslim).

On the other hand, non-Muslim men do not need to follow the obligations a typical muslim husband must fulfill in Islam towards his wife. If a Muslim woman marries a Christian or Jewish man, he is not obligated to follow those obligations.

One example this could be seen in, is with a divorce. Divorcing in Islam has **strict** protocols the husband must follow in regards to his wife. If a Muslim man decides to divorce his Christian or Jewish wife, he must follow these protocols to ensure her well being and that the situation is dealt with in a fair and just manner in the eyes of God. If a non-Muslim man decides to divorce his Muslim wife, he does not need to, and most probably will not follow the Islamic protocols which will leave the Muslim women in a unfair and unjust position.

5738,"Ill try to explain Jesus (pbuh) in the Quran for you as best a layperson can.

Like someone pointed out, a replacement Jesus (pbuh) isn't a new idea, the Nag Hammadi Library has atleast 1 document (I'm sure there are more) dated to around 100 AD which was kept hidden by the church from the general public, which states Jesus (pbuh) was laughing while they crucified his look-alike.

Also, although I take everything in the New Testament with a pound of salt, if you read it a little more closely you'll notice Mary Magdeline mistaking Jesus (pbuh) for a Gardner (why would she mistake Jesus (pbuh) for a Gardner? If you wore scrubs and a physician coat and appeared to your wife, would she mistake you for another man while looking at you dead in the face?). Also, the disciples were eating with someone who they didn't recognize was Jesus (pbuh) but it ended up actually being him (?!). 

But back to the point, the Jews living during that time period practiced their religion all for show, they had no spirituality and merely did things for reverence and status. Jesus (pbuh) called them out, and came to relieve them from some of the laws so they could focus more on their spiritual connection with Allah (swt). Well the Jews didn't like that, they were arrogant and cocky.

&gt;And We did certainly give Moses the Torah and followed up after him with messengers. And We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear proofs and supported him with the Pure Spirit. But is it [not] that every time a messenger came to you, [O Children of Israel], with what your souls did not desire, you were arrogant? And a party [of messengers] you denied and another party you killed. [2:87]

So what did they do? They planned on getting Jesus (pbuh) killed, but in the worst possible way, accursed on a cross/tree.

They planned and schemed, they threw false allegations and called him a blasphemer. Pontius Pilate was an evil man (historically, the bible says otherwise) and couldn't have all this ruckus, they were becoming a nuisance to him. He orders Jesus (pbuh) to be crucified. But while the Jews planned and plotted, Allah (swt) planned and plotted, and he is the best of planners.

&gt; And they planned and Allah (also) planned, and Allah is the best of planners. [3:54]

So whoever was crucified, was not Jesus (pbuh) but it only appeared to them as so.

&gt; And [for] their saying, ""Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah ."" And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain. [4:157]

**Side note**: Christian's say this means Allah (swt) deceived them. Um, no... Who told you to make Jesus (pbuh) God and an atonement for your sins, *even* if he had actually died? They let Paul deceive them, or else Jesus (pbuh) was just another Prophet the Jews succeeded in killing.

Back to topic, instead Allah (swt) raised Jesus (pbuh) up to himself, and purified him from those who blaspheme and say about Jesus (pbuh) what he never claimed.

&gt; Behold! Allah said: ""O Jesus! I will take thee and raise thee to Myself and clear thee (of the falsehoods) of those who blaspheme; I will make those who follow thee superior to those who reject faith, to the Day of Resurrection: Then shall ye all return unto me, and I will judge between you of the matters wherein ye dispute. [3:55]

This is the truth about Jesus (pbuh) which Jews and Christian's differed about.

&gt; Such was Jesus, son of Mary: (this is) a statement of the truth concerning which they doubt. [19:34]

But after Jesus (pbuh) ascension, the sects differed regarding him (they still do to this day).

&gt;But the sects differed among themselves: and woe to the unbelievers because of the (coming) Judgment of a Momentous Day! [19:37]

For them calling him begotten son of God.

&gt; It is not befitting to (the majesty of) Allah that He should beget a son. Glory be to Him! when He determines a matter, He only says to it, ""Be"", and it is. [19:35]

&gt; And they say: The Beneficent Allah has taken (to Himself) a son. Indeed ye have put forth a thing most monstrous! At it the skies are ready to burst, the earth to split asunder, and the mountains to fall down in utter ruin, That they should invoke a son for (Allah) the Beneficent. And it is not worthy of the Beneficent Allah that He should take (to Himself) a son. Not one of the beings in the heavens and the earth but must come to (Allah) Most Gracious as a servant. [19:88-93]

And on the Day of Judgement, Jesus (pbuh) will be an opponent of Christians.

&gt;  And they have taken (for worship) gods other than Allah, to give them power and glory!  Nay, but they will deny their worship of them, and become opponents unto them.  [19:81-82]

This is the Qurans take on Jesus (pbuh).

The main way I learned to recite the Qur'an is by listening to reciters. I stopped listening to music and instead the Qur'an, and I memorized a good amount of *surahs* without actively trying.

I'm also learning how to read the Qur'an. I wake up for *fajr* a few days a week while my son is still sleeping, and attend a class via cell phone. I get listened to, and listen to other sisters recite and I'm learning a lot alhamdilillah. 

But I don't know the meaning of much of what I'm saying, and rely on translations. Some *surahs* I have memorised the translation for, so I can tell what I'm reading or what the reciter is saying.

Insha'Allah I will continue to learn so I can teach my son to read the Qur'an. Anytime I recite the Qur'an and he's hears the word *Allah*, he lifts his index finger upwards towards the ceiling/sky, it's to die for (he's two). Just thought I'd share that last part lol.

5755,"According to this study by Oxford, belief in God is part of human nature.

&gt; **A three-year international research project, directed by two academics at the University of Oxford, finds that humans have natural tendencies to believe in gods and an afterlife.**

&gt; Project Co-Director Professor Roger Trigg, from the University of Oxford's Ian Ramsey Centre, said: 'This project suggests that religion is not just something for a peculiar few to do on Sundays instead of playing golf. **We have gathered a body of evidence that suggests that religion is a common fact of human nature across different societies. This suggests that attempts to suppress religion are likely to be short-lived as human thought seems to be rooted to religious concepts, such as the existence of supernatural agents or gods, and the possibility of an afterlife or pre-life.'**

&gt;How did you all come to find Islam as the truth as opposed to Judaism or Hinduism or any other religion? 

Islam makes the most sense to me. It has a firm foundation to stand on and is reliable. I know where the Qur'an came from, how it was transmitted to me, what my Prophet said etc etc. Unlike Christianity for example. The Gospels are anonymous and were written 50-70 years after Jesus(pbuh). Basically hearsay for all those years, or conjecture like the Qur'an says. 

Also, I liked how the Qur'an refuted other forms of worship. It's arguments were very logical for me (Idol worshiping, Jesus (Pbuh) worshiping etc).

Lastly, just hearing the Quran being recited was enough for me. How easy it is to memorize even for a non-arab speaker like me, and the amount of wisdom and meaning in the words is amazing. God knew what he was doing when he revealed his last revelation. He says in the Qur'an he made the Quran fall of the tongue, and I can attest to that. He said he will preserve the Qur'an, and history can attest to that. 

&gt;Was there something that instantly made you go ""oh Islam is right"" or was it more gradual?

I knew in my heart Islam was true, but I didn't convert for a couple of months.

&gt;What religion or irreligion did you come from?

Agnostic.

&gt;Do you ever question if you made the right choice?

Nope. All I have to do is hear or recite the Qur'an, and I know I made the right choice.

5800,"Jesus(pbuh) was passive because he had no authoratative control, just like Muhammad (pbuh) was in Mecca. When Jesus (pbuh) gains authoratative control in his second coming, he won't be so ""peaceful"":

**The Second Coming of Christ**

&gt;Around 4 B.C., a prophet by the name of Jesus was born. He claimed to be the Messiah, and some Jews followed him. The followers of Christ eventually split into numerous sects, and eventually one triumphed over all others. These became what are today known as Christians. As for the majority of Jews, they rejected Jesus. Why? The Jews rejected (and continue to reject) Jesus because he did not fulfill the prophecies pertaining to the Messiah. How could Jesus be the Messiah when he not only did not defeat or conquer Israel’s enemies, but he never even led an army into a single war? On the contrary, didn’t Jesus preach nonviolence and “loving one’s enemies”?

&gt;Instead of rejecting these militaristic aspects of the Messiah, Christians attribute them to Jesus during his Second Coming. No longer will Jesus be a weak and persecuted prophet. Instead, he will hold governmental authority, and is depicted as powerful and mighty. This Jesus will certainly not love his enemies or turn the other cheek to them. In fact, the Bible tells us that Jesus will wage violent warfare against his enemies, and he will mercilessly kill them all.

&gt;Many Christians talk about how Jesus Christ will bring peace to the world, once and for all. But they often neglect to mention how this world “peace” is obtained. It is only after slaughtering his opponents and subduing “the nations” (the entire world?) under the foot of the global Christian empire that the world will have “peace”. Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible explains:

&gt;There shall be no more war; horses and chariots shall be no more used in a hostile way; but there shall be perfect peace, all enemies being destroyed, which agrees with Micah 2:3 Zechariah 9:10.

&gt;In other words, there will be peace for the simple reason that there will be nobody left to fight, all opponents having been slaughtered or subdued. This world “peace” is the same “peace” that any conqueror dreams of: after utterly defeating and conquering all of one’s neighbors and enemies, what is there left but “peace”, insofar as the non-existence of violence? In the accidentally insightful words of the Evangelist Wayne Blank: “Put another way, humans aren’t going to have anything left to fight about.” Following conquest, a foreign occupier would obviously want the occupied peoples to be peaceful, as this would eliminate the nuisance of having to fight off freedom-fighters. The absence of violence would allow the conquering force to effortlessly sustain its occupation.

&gt;The events of the Second Coming of Christ are found in the Bible, including the Book of Revelation–which is the last book in the New Testament. Jesus will “judge and wage war” (Rev. 19:11), his robe will be “dipped in blood” (19:13), and he will be accompanied by “armies” (19:14) with which he will “strike down the nations” (19:15), including “the Gentiles” in general and “the nations that were opposed to him” in specific. This will result in the “utter destruction of all his enemies”. Furthermore: “in his second coming[,] he will complete their destruction, when he shall put down all opposing rule, principality, and power.”

&gt;Once he conquers the infidels, Jesus “will rule them with an iron rod” (19:15). Wayne Blank writes:
The good news is that The Return Of Jesus Christ is going to happen. The even better news is that this time He’s not coming to be sacrificed by the world, but to rule it, along with those who have been faithful and obedient to Him. The world is going to know true peace, and genuine justice, in a way that it has never known before…

&gt;How Will World Peace Happen?

&gt;…[This will] not [be] by pleading and debate, but with a rod of iron. Those who choose to love and obey Him will be loved, while those who choose to rebel and hate Him will know His wrath.

&gt;Jesus will “will release the fierce wrath of God” (19:15) on them, and “he shall execute the severest judgment on the opposers of his truth”. Because of this, “every tribe on earth will mourn because of him” (Rev. 1:7), and they will “express the inward terror and horror of their minds, at his appearing; they will fear his resentment”. Just as the people of Canaan were terrified by the Israelite war machine, so too would the unbelievers “look with trembling upon [Jesus]”. This is repeated in the Gospels, that “the Son of man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn” (Matthew 24:30). “All the nations of the world shall wail when he comes to judgment” and the enemies of Jesus “shall mourn at the great calamities coming upon them”.

&gt;Far from the meek prophet of the First Coming, Jesus on his return will command a very strong military force that will “destroy[] every ruler, authority, and power”. Not only is this consistent with the legacy of conquests by the Biblical prophets, it is actually a fulfillment or completion of the task that Moses initiated: holy war and conquest in the name of God. In First Corinthians (part of the New Testament) it is prophesied that instead of loving his enemies, Christ will subdue and humble them under his feet:

&gt;1 Corinthians 15:24 [Jesus] will turn the Kingdom over to God the Father, having destroyed every ruler and authority and power.

&gt;15:25 For Christ must reign until he humbles all his enemies beneath his feet.

&gt;Pastor and Biblical scholar Ron Teed explains that Jesus Christ brought “comfort and salvation at His first coming” but will bring “vengeance on God’s enemies” during his Second Coming. There are thus “two comings of Christ, the first to save, the second to judge”–yet in debates with Muslims it seems that Christians play up the First Coming and completely ignore the Second. The popular Teed Commentaries explains how “vengeance” is for Christ’s enemies (the “unbelievers”) and “comfort” only for his followers (the believers):

&gt;The Messiah will bring both comfort and vengeance. He will take vengeance on God’s enemies and bring comfort to His people. This is a summary of the mission of Christ. He brought comfort and salvation at His first coming during His earthly ministry according to Luke…
However, He said nothing of taking vengeance on God’s enemies at that time, for that part of his mission will not be fulfilled till He returns triumphant…

&gt;[There are] two comings of Christ, the first to save, the second to judge.

&gt;In His First coming He did the things mentioned in Isaiah 61:1-2; in His Second Coming He will do the things in verses 2-3. When He returns He will bring judgment on unbelievers. This will be the day of God’s “vengeance.”

[Source](http://www.loonwatch.com/2011/04/jesus-loves-his-enemies-and-then-kills-them-all/)

Evangelical site [Gotquestions.org](http://www.gotquestions.org/war-Bible.html) says:

&gt;Jesus’ second coming will be exceedingly violent. 

&gt;Revelation 19:11-21 describes the ultimate war with Christ, the conquering commander who judges and makes war “with justice” (v. 11). It’s going to be bloody (v. 13) and gory. The birds will eat the flesh of all those who oppose Him (v. 17-18). He has no compassion upon His enemies, whom He will conquer completely and consign to a “fiery lake of burning sulfur” (v. 20).

&gt;It is an error to say that God never supports a war. Jesus is not a pacifist.

&gt;[3] Who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them

&gt;[4] And who believe in what has been revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what was revealed before you, and of the Hereafter they are certain [in faith].

This book has no doubt in it, for those who are conscious of God, who believe in the existence of the unseen world and establish prayer and charity. They believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and what was revealed to Jesus (pbuh) and Moses (pbuh) and all those before him.

***

2) There are probably hundreds of verses in the Quran about this but I'll quote a few

**Surat l-Qari'ah**

&gt;[6-11] Then as for one whose scales are heavy [with good deeds], He will be in a pleasant life. But as for one whose scales are light, His refuge will be an abyss. And what can make you know what that is? It is a Fire, intensely hot.

2b) Generally all Muslims who *believe* that there is no God but Allah(swt) and Muhammad(pbuh) is his last prophet, and believes in the previous Prophets (Jesus, Moses, John the Baptist, Jacob, Isaac, Ismael, Abraham, Job, Noah etc.) will eventually go to paradise.

Non-Muslims will also have their deeds weighed, but if they did not believe in God (atheists) then all their good deeds will avail them in nothing, and will be rendered scattered dust.

**Surat l-Furqan**

&gt;[21] And those who do not expect the meeting with Us say, ""Why were not angels sent down to us, or [why] do we [not] see our Lord?"" They have certainly become arrogant within themselves and [become] insolent with great insolence.

&gt;[22] The day they see the angels - no good tidings will there be that day for the criminals, and [the angels] will say, ""Prevented and inaccessible.""

&gt;[23] And We shall turn to whatever deeds they did (in this life), and We shall make such deeds as floating dust scattered about.

I am a convert and can understand your situation, I was in a same predicament in the beginning as well. But I took my Shahadah and began practicing and day by day, with more knowledge and research, became more certain of Allah (swt) and Islam. 

If you notice in the Quran, Abraham(pbuh) asks Allah(swt) to bring life back to the dead before his eyes so he can be certain and have more *iman*. If you notice, the disciples of Jesus (pbuh) ask for a table spread of the food of *Jannah* so they can be certain. And this is while Abraham (pbuh) was a prophet, and the disciples were witnessing Jesus' (pbuh) array of miracles.

It's totally normal to feel this way in the beginning especially growing up as an agnostic or an atheist, but the more you practice Islam and the more knowledge you seek, you will have 100% conviction until you actually long to die to meet your Lord.

**Surat l-Inshiqaq**

&gt;Psalms 51:16 **For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give [it]: thou delightest not in burnt offering.** [17] The sacrifices of G-d [are] a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O G-d, thou wilt not despise. (KJV)

&gt;Psalms 69:30 **I will praise the name of G-d with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving. [31] [This] also shall please the LORD better than an ox [or] bullock that hath horns and hoofs.**(KJV)

&gt;Proverbs 15:8 The sacrifice of the wicked [is] an abomination to the LORD: **but the prayer of the upright [is] His delight.** [9] The way of the wicked [is] an abomination unto the LORD: **but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness.** (KJV)

&gt;Proverbs 16:6 **By mercy and truth iniquity is purged**: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.

&gt;Hosea 14:2-3 - (2) Return, O Israel, to the L-rd your G-d; for you have stumbled in your iniquity.  (3) Take words with you and return to the L-rd; say to Him: **""You shall forgive all iniquity, and accept the good, and we will render [for] bullocks [the offering of our] lips.""**

&gt;Micah 6:6-8 - (6) With what shall I come before the L-rd, bow myself before G-d on high? **Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, with yearling calves?** (7) **Will the L-rd be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands streams of oil?** Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?  (8) **Man has told you what is good; but what does the L-rd demand of you? To do justice, and to love loving-kindness, and to walk humbly with your G-d?**

&gt;Proverbs 16:6 - **Through loving kindness and truth will iniquity be atoned**; and through the fear of the L-rd [you] depart from evil.

&gt;Hosea 6:6 - For loving-kindness is what I desire, **and not sacrifice**; and knowledge of G-d **more than burnt offerings.**

&gt;Proverbs 21:3 - **Doing charity and justice is more desirable to the L-rd than a sacrifice.**

&gt;Ezekiel 14:14,20 - (14) ""And if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, **they would save themselves with their righteousness**,"" says the L-rd G-d.  

&gt;(20) And if Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live,"" says the L-rd G-d, ""**if they will save a son or a daughter; they with their righteousness would save themselves.""**

**Ezekiel 18**

&gt;[19] Yet say ye: **Why doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father with him?** When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all My statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live.

5847,"The Torah I'd say holds more weight than the Gospels (but not really). The Gospels are basically useless and are completely discarded. The Gospels are mostly commentary with the ""supposed"" Jesus(pbuh) sayings barely making up any volume. The original Injeel would be the verbatim revelation Jesus(pbuh) spoke and only that.

The Qur'an tells us about these previous revelations (and made up ones).

**Surat l-Baqarah**

&gt;[75] Do you then hope that they would believe in you, and a party from among them indeed used to hear the Word of Allah, then altered it after they had understood it, and they know (this).

&gt;[78] And there are among them illiterates, who know not the Book, but (see therein their own) desires, and they do nothing but conjecture.

Here we notice Allah(swt) say that there were illiterates making up lies based on what they desired, and what they heard of conjecture following Jesus'(pbuh) ascension. 

&gt;[79] So woe to those who write the ""scripture"" with their own hands, then say, ""This is from Allah ,"" in order to exchange it for a small price. Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn.

**Surat l-An'aam**

&gt;[91] No just estimate of Allah do they make when they say: ""Nothing doth Allah send down to man (by way of revelation)"": Say: ""Who then sent down the Book which Moses brought? a light and guidance to man: but ye make it into (separate) sheets for show while ye conceal much (of its contents): therein were ye taught that which ye knew not neither ye nor your fathers."" Say: ""Allah (sent it down)"": then leave them to plunge in vain discourse and trifling.

&gt;[93] And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about Allah or says, ""It has been inspired to me,"" while nothing has been inspired to him, and one who says, ""I will reveal [something] like what Allah revealed."" And if you could but see when the wrongdoers are in the overwhelming pangs of death while the angels extend their hands, [saying], ""Discharge your souls! Today you will be awarded the punishment of [extreme] humiliation for what you used to say against Allah other than the truth and [that] you were, toward His verses, being arrogant.""

**Surat l-Ma'ida**

&gt;[13] But because of their breach of their Covenant We cursed them and made their hearts grow hard: they change the words from their (right) places and forget a good part of the Message that was sent them nor wilt thou cease to find them barring a few ever bent on (new) deceits: but forgive them and overlook (their misdeeds): for Allah loveth those who are kind.

&gt;[14] From those too who call themselves Christians We did take a Covenant but they forgot a good part of the Message that was sent them: so We estranged them with enmity and hatred between the one and the other to the Day of Judgment. And soon will Allah show them what it is they have done.

5867,"&gt;This is false and you are overreaching by claiming this is ""clearly stated"". You argument depends upon the idea that the phrase ""When the flood rose high and covered the whole land, We carried you in the Ark."", by using ""you (plural)"" (Arabic ""kum""), insinuates that we are ""there"" in the sense that we are descendants of the party actually there (aka Noah). By that logic, Quran 2:49 means we are all the descendants of the people of Moses since the Qur'an also uses ""you (plural)"" (Arabic ""kum"") in that narration. The usage of the pronoun is simply a rhetorical device that places us in the viewpoint/frame of believers of the past. It does not have any bearing on claiming that we are descendants from the parties in the narrative

Nope, I'm not false nor am I overreaching. Your logic is incorrect because while the verse I quoted (69:11) is speaking directly to the reader of the Qur'an (which 69:12 further proves), insinuating that we're the progeny of those saved on the ark (which is supported by numerous other verses and hadith), 2:49 is preceeded by 2:47 which says, ""Oh Children of Israel"" so not talking about us.

&gt; Non-Christian sources used to study and establish the historicity of Jesus include Jewish sources such as Josephus, and Roman sources such as Tacitus.

&gt; There are three mentions of Jesus in non-Christian sources which have been used in historical analyses of the existence of Jesus.[30] Jesus is mentioned twice in the works of 1st-century Roman-Jewish historian Josephus and once in the works of the 2nd-century Roman historian Tacitus.[30][31]

&gt; Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews, written around 93–94 AD, includes two references to the biblical Jesus in Books 18 and 20.

&gt; There is a total of three references to the name 'Jesus' in Book 20, Chapter 9: ""Jesus, who was called Christ"" (ie ' Messiah'); ""Jesus, son of Damneus"", a Jewish High Priest (both in Paragraph 1 ); and ""Jesus, son of Gamaliel"", another Jewish High Priest (in Paragraph 4).

&gt; Roman historian Tacitus referred to 'Christus' and his execution by Pontius Pilate in his Annals (written ca. AD 116), book 15, chapter 44.[38]

&gt; and the only two events subject to **""almost universal assent"" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate.**[2][13][58][59]

There's your evidence had you actually read the link. All historians universally accept Jesus(pbuh) was baptized and ordered to be crucified. How could that be if he didn't even exist lol? Delusional...

Again, all scholars agree Jesus (pbuh) existed.

&gt;such critics do support the historicity of Jesus, **and reject the theory that Jesus never existed**, known as the **Christ myth theory.**

&gt;As for why a devout Muslim will be worried; a true believer is always balanced between two things: hope and fear of Allah. Hope in His mercy and reward and fear of His wrath and punishment. Ibn al-Qayyim describes this as the wings of a bird. One wing of fear and one wing of hope. Lose either one and you will swerve off course and crash. But between those two wings is the body of the bird and the body of our worship is neither fear nor hope, it is love for Allah. So a believer loves Allah on the balance between fear and hope.

A true *mu'min*(believer) never let's his piety become the source of his arrogance (thinking he is definitely going to *Jannah* because he is so pious etc.) He is in balance between fear and hope and love.

You know since becoming a Muslim I realized something about death. Islam is supposed to make you ready for death, and I feel that every extra day I get to live, I get a little closer to being ready to die. And this might seem depressing to non-Muslims, but coming from the other side, I think being ready to die is a beautiful thing and I get jealous of old women in the mosque who seem to have that.

My friend texted me telling me ""not to trip"" and I'm not hip so I didn't know what that meant. I inquired what ""not tripping"" means and all I got was a ""lol nothing"" text.

I finish the whole damn thing so I call my friend and she tells me it takes a little while. As soon as I hung up the phone with her it kicked in. 

All of a sudden I feel cold as ever. I feel my whole body tingling especially the back of my head and spine. My mouth was dry as ever and I was jittery. It felt like I was slowly dying so I call my friend. I'm crying to her like a baby and slurring my speech cause I have no saliva. I'm telling her I want it to be over(its been like 20 minutes) and she said it'll take a few hours. I go sit on the bench all by myself and *BAM*, a deer comes out of nowhere. I'm freaking out and running like Freddy Keuger is after me. I still don't know if I'm alive or dead but I eventually find my grandparents house. I sneak in, drink some water and go to bed.

No Gabriel is different from other angels. He is referred to as the Spirit of God because he plays a very different role from the average angel. It's not just a title. I'll quote the Quran to show the differentiation:

I was a non-muslim naive young adult *in love* with my much older agnostic fiance. I was preggo and we were to get married a few months after I gave birth. Then a test from Allah came, I almost died giving birth to his child which gave me a wake up call. I had post partum depression and felt like dying everyday. I would look at my child and be scared, then look at his father and get even more scared for some odd reason. I didn't know what to do so I stalled my wedding and with my free time began looking into religion, having a kid and almost dying does that lol. Long story short I embraced Islam with my best friend after a couple months of nonstop education. My fiance was not having it for some reason and actually sunk further into disbelieve while I tried to convert him. Knowing what a knew about Islam and my obligations to not only Allah, but to my child, I dropped his a** like a hot potato. 

Oh how quick that fairytale ended. Feels like a dream almost. Now the same person who made my life a fairytale a few years back makes it a nightmare. Things can change in a heartbeat and you really need to think about your choices and how they will affect the rest of your life and your children's lives. I have to live with my naive decisions for the rest of my life, although I will *never* regret them because they gave me my beautiful son and reminded me to return to Allah (swt). My main priority in life now is to be a good muslim, raise my child as best I can so that we can both be joined together in Jannah, the eternal fairytale that will never end insha'Allah.

So yup, take what you will from that, at the end of the day you have the will to make whatever choice you want to, but you might have to deal with the consequences of a spur of the moment decision for the rest of your life.

6100,"Hi, I'm a convert and while reading the Bible, had lots of stuff stick out to me. 

Song of Solomon in the OT is a book thought to be about future Prophecies. Some say its speaking about Solomons wife but that isnt true, a excuse Christian apologist like to use. It's regarded as an allegorical/metaphorical book about the future. From www.jewishencyclopedia.com by Emil. G Hirsh/Crawford Howell Tot:

&gt;The oldest known interpretation of the Song is **allegorical**: The Midrash and the Targum represent it as depicting the relations between God and Israel. The allegorical conception of it passed over into the Christian Church, and has been elaborated by a long line of writers from Origen down to the present time, the deeper meaning being assumed to be the relation between God or Jesus and the Church or the individual Soul.

Establishing it's a book speaking about future events, let proceed. It speaks of a certain individual to come sometime in the future. 

**Solomon 5**

&gt;[10] My beloved is **white and ruddy, pre-eminent above ten thousand.**

This individual will be **white and ruddy**. Next verse:

&gt;[11] רֹאשׁוֹ, כֶּתֶם פָּז; קְוֻצּוֹתָיו, תַּלְתַּלִּים, שְׁחֹרוֹת, כָּעוֹרֵב.

&gt;[11] His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are **curled, and black as a raven.**

This individual will have curly hair that is black. Note, the Hebrew word for *raven* can also translate *arab*. Description of Muhammad(pbuh): 

&gt;His hair was neither very curly nor very straight, but had a **slight wave** in it... The complexion of Prophet Muhammad was **white with redness in it**. Shamaa-il Tirmidhi- Chapter 1- Hadith no.6

To continue on, let me quote to an important part of the Solomon 5:10.

&gt;**pre-eminent above ten thousand.**

This individual will be the cheif of ten thousand men. Muhammad(pbuh), when he went to Mecca:

&gt;Narrated Ibn Abbas: The Prophet left Medina (for Mecca) **in the company of ten thousand** (Muslim warriors) in (the month of) Ramadan, and that was eight and a half years after his migration to Medina... Sahih Bukhari - Book No. 59, Hadith No. 574

* * *
Deuteronomy also speaks about the individual who will be the chiefmen of ten thousand warriors. This time, it gives us some specifics: 

**Deuteronomy 33**

&gt;[2] And he said: The LORD came from Sinai, and rose from Seir unto them; He shined forth from **mount Paran**, and He came from the **myriads holy**, at His right hand was a fiery **law unto them.**

Mount Paran is known in the Biblical world to be where the Ishmaelites settled, being the region of Arabia i.e Mecca. The word *myriad* is usually translated to ten thousand men, because in classical history, *myriad* referred to a unit of ten thousand. This individual will bring a law with him to the area of Mecca. 

Proceeding:

**Deuteronomy 33**

&gt;[3] Yea, He loveth the peoples, all His holy ones--they are in Thy hand; and they sit down at Thy feet, **receiving of Thy words.**

From these verses we can summarize:

1. This individual will come to Arabia. 

2. He will have ten thousand men with him.

3. When he comes from this area with his warriors, he will deliver God's law unto them. 

4. These people will accept him and recieve God's revelation. 

* * *

Continuing with Song of Solomon who elaborates after giving us physical characteristics of this individual:

**Song of Solomon 5**

&gt;[16] חִכּוֹ, מַמְתַקִּים, וְכֻלּוֹ, מַחֲמַדִּים; זֶה דוֹדִי וְזֶה רֵעִי, בְּנוֹת יְרוּשָׁלִָם. (Hebrew)

&gt;[16] His mouth is most sweet; yea, he is **altogether lovely**. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.' (English) 

&gt;[16] Hikko Mamittakim we kullo **Muhammadim** Zehdoodeh wa Zehraee Bayna Jerusalem.(transliteration)

Notice in these passages, after describing physical Characteristics of Muhammad (pbuh) perfectly, the *transliteration* pronounces his name, **Muhammadim**, Proceeding by saying *this is my beloved, O daughters of Jerusalem*. The translators translated the word **Muhammadim**, which is a **masculine noun**, into an adjective **altogether lovely**. Look up any dictionary for that Hebrew word, it will be a masculine pronoun. Also, the **-im** is a plural of respect, which you can find in God's name, Eloh*-im*.

From these passages in Song of Solomon we can summarize:

1. This individual will be white and ruddy.

2. He will have black hair.

3. He will be a cheifmen of ten thousand.

4. His name, a masculine pronoun in Hebrew given the plural of respect, translated into an adjective in English (for.obvious reasons), is Muhammad. 

* * *

Lastly, it's not a shocker to find him in the OT as God promises to make the nation of Ismael *blessed* and *great*. 

**Genesis 17**

&gt;[20] And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee; behold, I have **blessed him**, and **will make him fruitful**, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and **I will make him a great nation.**

The descendants of Ismael, before Muhammad(pbuh), were idol worshippers. God promises Abraham he will *bless* Ismael, bless meaning make Holy with him, and will make them a great nation. Christian apologist say *great* means great in number, which is true, but they avoid the *blessed* part. An idol worshiping nation is not a nation *blessed* by God. And even though they have their own definition of what *great* nation means, God gives us his:

**Deuteronomy 4**

&gt;[7] **For what great nation is there**, that hath God so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is **whensoever we call upon Him?**

By the above verse, we see God proclaiming a *great* nation is one which calls upon him and worships him. By God saying he will make Ismaels nation (arabs) great, he means he will make them a nation which worships him alone, the one true and only God. When did the Arabians worship the one true God of Abraham? With the advent of Muhammad(pbuh). 

These are only a *few* examples from the OT, their are plenty more but I think these are enough. I believe others will answer the rest of your questions since I'm on my phone.

A nation that worships him. This verse is *defining* what *any* great nation is.

6109,"Hi, Muslim convert here. In the OT we find God promising to make Ismael's nation *blessed* and *great*. 

**Genesis 17**

&gt;[20] And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee; behold, I have **blessed him**, and will **make him fruitful**, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and **I will make him a great nation.**

When in history did the nation of Ismael become *blessed* by God? Before Muhammad, the Arabs, the descendants of Ismael, were *idol worshipers*. Christian apologist like to say the *great* part means great in number, which is true but God has his own definition of what a great nation is. Now what is a *blessed*and *great* nation according to God in the OT?

**Deuteronomy 4**

&gt;[7] For what **great nation** is there, that hath God so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is **whensoever we call upon Him**?

&gt;[8] And **what great nation is there, that hath statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?**

With the above verses, we conclude that a *blessed* and *great* nation to God, is a nation that worships the one true God of Abraham, the God of the Israelites, who adhere to all the laws and commandments. 

They are a *blessed* and *great* nation when they call upon and worship the God of the OT. When did the Idol worshiping Arabs become *blessed* and *great* by worshiping the one true God? With the advent of Muhammad (pbuh).

This is how I interpreted the passage and you may interpret it as you wish. I'm not going to debate, but if you have any questions for me feel free.

But dying your hair is a hassle and is annoying, and I'm assuming you have black hair so if you did an all over color, you'd need to upkeep it a lot because roots aren't cute. Also, if you go ash blonde like my friend, but you are ethnic looking without light features, you're going to stand out like a sore thumb to muslims and non muslims alike. I mean thats fine I dont judge, I think its fun, but alot of Muslims judge lol. Unless you dye it from like black to dark brown or a subtle change like that. Oh and light brown or blonde highlights on black hair will also draw attention. My friend has subtle highlights but again, he's caucasian and Caucasians tend to have natural highlights from the sun so it doesn't stand out.

What the arabic word meant during Muhammad's life, it still means today. Thats the point of having meticulously preserved the meanings of the Arabic words in dictionaries early on. You won't fall into the many issues with language after time. Thats the difference with the Qur'an and the Arabic language. Compare that to Greek that the Bible manuscripts are in, you basically play a guessing game of what some words meant back then. 

&gt;Would English or Spanish or Chinese be just as proficient at transmitting core tenets of the divine text or is the study of Arabic required for an even basic knowledge of what is written?

Thats a what if question whose answer is futile. Revelation given to Moses was in his language, revelation given to Jesus was in Aramaic and revelation given to Muhammad was in Arabic. Thousands of Prophets were sent and all were sent in their societies mother tongue. That would've been Chinese, Spanish or any other language. 

God decided his final revelation was going to be in Arabic, and it turns out there was a plethora of divine wisdom in that.

&gt;Yes, obviously Arabic was important because that was the language of the people who originally inherited the original divinations but the meaning of that language is completely lost on people today. Language is inherently a fluid thing. You will never fully understand the meaning of a language after a certain point, because what each word signifies changes depending on who reads it or hears it and so the further you get from the original text in terms of time, the further you get away from its complete meaning.

Wrong. The arabic languageof the quran has been preserved unlike *many* other languages. What it meant then it still means today, since muslims meticulously perserved the definitions of Arabic words early on. So much so that translators of Hebrew refer back to Arabic dictionaries to decipher what  Hebrew words mean. Arabic and Hebrew in the same family of semetic languages fyi.

Paul abolished the laws of the OT. He made a Prophet God, and made his ""supposed"" crucifixion the central theme of Christainity. Basically God became man, and he died on the cross for your sins. You don't have to do anything because you're saved with Jesus' blood, his make believe blood because he didn't die. He did everything the OT said not to do. God is not a man, yet Jesus is God. No one bears the sin of another, yet Jesus died for everyone. The only reason he was successful was because he preached to gentiles, specifically Romans and Greeks who were familiar with God becoming a man etc. Many early sects of Christianity did not believe Jesus was God or died, but that he was a Prophet raised up to God. But they weren't dominant and popular, the Romans and Greeks were so their idea of Jesus remained, while the weak sects who had the truth were annihilated. 

Also, the Jews didn't accept Jesus as the Messiah, and wanted to shame him. So when whoever was crucified died, they said they killed the imposter because the Messiah wouldn't die, especially on a cross/tree because that meant he was cursed. 

So Christians believed he was the Messiah, but he was also God, and that him dying on the cross cursed was the ultimate sacrifice for their sins. The Jews didn't believe he was the Messiah, and they believed they killed an imposter. 

So Muhammad came to restore the laws Paul abolished, restore Jesus' image and who he really was. He came to unite the Jews and Christians in what they differed regarding Jesus.

You have to realize, Allah is most just. You don't need to worry about them, because their Lord, even though some deny him or have a wrong idea of him, is the most generous and just. He will judge everyone accordingly, and no one will enter Hell but knowing they have wronged themsleves. They won't be angry at Allah, they will be angry at themselves for denying such a deserving Lord. The angels will have worshiped him for billions of years, and the day Allah removes his veil and shows himself, they will be in awe and say they haven't worshiped him enough. Such a deserving lord. 

Regarding dawah, it's really the mentality of today's soceity. Most atheist either have such a high view of God, that they can't believe such a God would create a world like this. And some atheists have made themselves their Gods. They think the limited knowledge they have acquired, is enough to know God doesn't exist. You'd think they'd stop arguing about it if they were so sure, but no lol. 

Its the same conclusions, just different means. Remember Pharoah? He made himself God because of all his power? Well *some* atheists, and I really only mean some, have made themselves Gods because of their knowledge, and the ones in power have lead astray many innocent people with them. 

But whatever, once you're certain of your Islam, you just wish people the best. Wallahi some atheists love God more than us. Some spend their whole lives trying to disprove him. Some think about him constantly, and they view him so highly, that it leads them to disbelief due to what they see around them. Not knowing all this corruptiom and suffering is due to our own deeds, and there's another life where the ones who caused the suffering are recompensed, and the ones who suffered pateintly will be recompensed and more. The suffering will feel like nothing there, but who are you talking to? They won't believe in an ""over there"" until they see it and it's too late. 

Don't worry too much. It's good to do Dawah, but if it doesn't work, oh well. In the end, they've only wronged themselves and our Lord is most generous and just.

I responded by explaining to him the Muslim view of the Trinity and the parts that make it up. In Islam, which is our version of reality, the trinity is Allah as the father, Jesus as the son, and Gabriel as the Holy Spirit.

So when the Qur'an is speaking, it's speaking in the context of what the Islamic view of each part of the trinity is.

Thus, I explained how God would not refer to the Holy Spirit in that verse, since the Holy Spirit in Islam is Gabriel, an angel with no free will. 
* * *
&gt;clarify the issues that Christians take with Islam

That's why I explained where the issue lies with Christians. They say the Qur'an doesn't know what the trinity is. It's not that the Qur'an doesn't understand it, it's that the Qur'an is in the Islamic context of things, thus it would not befit God to ask Gabriel to bare testimony.

* * *
The OP's comments in respect to Collyridianism.

&gt;It's been stated that Prophet Muhammad referred to the worship of Mary and her being part of a trinity in respect to Collyridianism 

In which I didn't address, and instead addressed the topic of what makes up the trinity in Islam and why the Holy Spirit wasn't brought up in the verse.

***
&gt;Also, you have extrapolated beyond the Qur'an by implying that Christians have made Gabriel equal to God.

I said in Islam we believe that Christians made Gabriel equal to God, you're putting words that aren't there:

&gt;**In Islam**, we know that the trinity in reality refers to Allah the one true God of Abraham, Jesus the human being and Prophet, and Gabriel the archangel aka Holy Spirit. Christians made all three of them, co-equal and one God.

***

&gt;Your implication is factually incorrect, regardless of the islamic definition of the trinity.

No it isn't since I never stated that Christians believe they worship an angel, instead I said Muslims believe that. And since he was asking the context and explanation of the Qur'an, **Islamic** scripture, I explained to him the concept of the trinity in Islam.

6294,"It has many different directions from coming at it, but I'll stick with one and that is that Catholics basically worship Mary as the Mother of God.

In Islam, we know that the trinity in *reality* refers to Allah the one true God of Abraham, Jesus the human being and Prophet, and Gabriel the archangel aka Holy Spirit. Christians made all three of them, co-equal and one God.

Now as I said, some people venerate Mary and give her divinity and direct acts of worship to her, there is no denying that. Consequently, God will ask Jesus for his testimony if he told people to worship him and his mother Mary. The reason Allah did not bring up Gabriel aka the Holy spirit, is because he can't bear testimony to such a thing on the Day of Judgement. 

God can't ask Gabriel if he ""said to the people"" to take him as a God. He was never known to anyone, and he never spoke to anyone, but a select few.

So when God says:

**Sūrat l-Māidah**

&gt;[116] And [beware the Day] when Allah will say, **""O Jesus, Son of Mary, did you say to the people, 'Take me and my mother as deities besides Allah ?'""** He will say, ""Exalted are You! It was not for me to say that to which I have no right. If I had said it, You would have known it. You know what is within myself, and I do not know what is within Yourself. Indeed, it is You who is Knower of the unseen.

He is speaking about the status of divinity Christendom gave to Jesus and Mary, who both were human beings and could bear testimony against other human beings.

To reiterate, God can't bring Gabriel to bear testimony against human beings, that's an absurdity as he wasn't a human being, and he couldn't ever disobey God, as angels do not have free will. Thus, he couldn't have uttered a thing like that which would anger and disobey God. So basically, it's impossible for him to have ever told people to take him as a God, so God cannot ask him if he told people to worship him.

6302,"The Kaa'ba is the house of God built by Abraham in which we *direct* our worship to. Abraham asks God to make his descendants of the future glorify his house in this spot.

**Sūrat Ib'rāhīm**

&gt;[37] Our Lord, I have settled some of my descendants in an uncultivated valley near Your sacred House, our Lord, that they may establish prayer. So make hearts among the people incline toward them and provide for them from the fruits that they might be grateful.
 
All Prophets had a direction they prayed to, and I believe Jesus' was towards Jerusalem. But when Muhammad (pbuh) became a Prophet, he felt bad praying towards Jerusalem and having his back towards the Kaa'ba which his father Abraham built, thus God changes the direction of prayer to it.

**Sūrat l-Baqarah**

&gt;[144] We have certainly seen the turning of your face, [O Muhammad], toward the heaven, and We will surely turn you to a qiblah with which you will be pleased. So turn your face toward al-Masjid al-haram. And wherever you [believers] are, turn your faces toward it [in prayer]. **Indeed, those who have been given the Scripture well know that it is the truth from their Lord.** And Allah is not unaware of what they do.

God says that the Jews know that this place is the house of worship. And you can find it in their scripture today being prophesied, of course, they would say we're giving a spin on it and interpret it incorrectly, but the text speaks for itself:

**Isaiah 60**

&gt;[3] And **the Gentiles** shall walk at thy light, and kings at the brightness of thy rising.

&gt;[4] Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: **they all are gathered together**, and come to thee; thy sons come from far, and thy daughters are borne on the side.

&gt;[6] The caravan of camels shall cover thee, and of the young camels of **Midian** and **Ephah**, all coming from **Sheba**; they shall bring gold and incense, and **shall proclaim the praises of the LORD.**

&gt;[7] All the flocks of **Kedar**(Mecca) shall **be gathered together unto thee**, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee; **they shall come up with acceptance on Mine altar**, and **I will glorify My glorious house.**

Here we can see God say that Gentiles from different nations, shall gather together, and that all the flocks of Kedar (mecca) will be gathered with *acceptance* at his altar, and he will glorify his house. 

In the Qur'an:

**Sūrat l-Haj**

&gt;[26] And [mention, O Muhammad], when We designated for Abraham the site of the House, [saying], ""Do not associate anything with Me and purify My House for those who perform Tawaf and those who stand [in prayer] and those who bow and prostrate.

&gt;[27] And proclaim to the people the Hajj [pilgrimage]; they will come to you on foot and on every lean camel; they will come from every distant pass -

So the Kaab'a is very important in Islam, as we believe it to be the place of worship Abraham asked God to make his descendants directed too. Pagan Idols crept into it as time went on, but Muhammad (pbuh) stopped that with his Prophet hood, and fulfilled the promise God made to Abraham.

6341,"&gt;Converts or reverts to Islam, why did you accept the faith?

I was agnostic in a Christian family. Certain incident occurred in my life that left me soul-searching, especially in religion. I read the Bible, and then read the Qur'an. I believed in Jesus because he undeniably existed, I just couldn't trust the Bibles recollection of his life and didn't trust Paul. The Bible is honestly worthless and has no basis to actually attribute your salvation to it. It anonymous, written decades after Jesus, no original manuscripts, the Bible editors pick and choose what to put in it, and the early Church hid many other works which didn't fit their idea of who Jesus was. Other than that, I did find Muhammad prophesied in the Old Testament a couple of times, as well as in the New Testament we have now a couple of times by John the Baptist and Jesus himself. 

Read the Qur'an, read Muhammad's biography, researched the authenticity of the Qur'an, researched the tenants of the faith, visited lectures and seminars, then converted. If any sincere person without biases reads the Qur'an and researches Islam, spends a decent amount of time researching the religion as they do with other pointless things, than it will prove itself to them. I didn't have to convince myself the Qur'an was true like I tried with the Bible, or that Muhammad was a real Prophet, the evidence itself convinced me.

* * *

&gt;Was there a ""defining moment"" for you?

The Old Testament and New Testament Prophesies, as well as the Qur'an's miraculous features, which was inspired to an illiterate man. There is no logical answer for where the Qur'an came from, other than the Divine.

* * *

&gt;What did you find in Islam that you were missing in your old beliefs?

I got to have a relationship with God and work for my salvation. I got to pray like Jesus and all the Prophets of the OT did. I got to fast like Jesus and all the Prophets of the OT did. I have a way of life in Islam, from how to pray, to how to use the bathroom. Islam is a complete, perfected religion for me. I can't speak about old beliefs because I didn't have any, but from my experience, Christians don't do anything for their salvation. They're saved by Jesus' sacrifice, a false doctrine developed by Paul. While I'm actually going to get saved like how every Prophet in history and his nation were, by following God's commandments, praying a prescribed amount of times, and fasting a prescribed amount of days. 

* * *

&gt;What reactions did you get?

Not much, as I was converting I was also right about to move. New people who didn't know me, so not much of a hassle. My family is happy for me and some will hopefully convert as I continue annoying them.

* * *

&gt;How did you adjust to the prayer, morality, and overall culture?

It took some time to get adjusted, but now it's great. I love the guidelines given to me to follow, and they're really simple once you get in the groove of things. The Muslim community is also great, and I especially love Ramadan. My favorite time of the year.

Yes, *generally* all Muslims will end up in Heaven. Hell is eternal, but not for Muslims.

Adultery, murder, fornication, sodomy, alcohol, consuming interest, slandering chaste women, consuming orphan property etc. There are a lot of them and I'm sure you can find a list of them online.

Dua is something you can do whenever you want. But God says that we are closest to him when we are in prostration, so after we say the obligatory exaltation's while still in prostration, we can make Dua's for anything we want or anything we want to thank him for.

6353,"&gt;Ex. istigfar will be helpful, but for some reason I just equate it to helping me not because it is istigfar and Allah is answering me, but because it is just **positive affirmations and it is helpful from a psychological point of view.**

Well this is the whole point of istighfar. Psychology is the study of the mind, and what is your mind? Your mind is part of the Nafs, or soul, which is immaterial and finds comfort in istighfar to Allah. It's supposed to be positive affirmations that help from a psychological standpoint, because it eases your mind, as Allah says:

**Sūrat l-Raʿd**

&gt;[28] Those who believe, and whose hearts find satisfaction in the remembrance of Allah: *for without doubt in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find satisfaction.*

* * *

&gt;Prayer is not beneficial because I am bowing to the creator, it is something man made that is just like yoga and that is why it is helpful.

Yoga has psychological benefits, which is again, part of the mind. But it isn't like prayer. Praying is beneficial because you are connecting with your creator and exalting him. If you see some progeny bust out amazing compositions on a piano, what do you do? You give that person a standing ovation. Now look at the universe that you live in, doesn't the one who created it deserve a standing ovation? Your prayer is that ovation, which is really nothing in return for all that Allah has given you, and will give you in the akhira. 

Also, prayer is supposed to remind you of where you are, and where you are going to go. It reminds you that this world is temporary, and that you are going to go somewhere after this. It doesn't benefit Allah, it benefits you, because it is a *reminder*. You are reminded five times a day of your inevitable fate.

* * *

&gt;These type's of thoughts. Sometimes I am able to clearly understand this world must have a creator and that the only straight path to him is Allah. Sometimes, I just don't, I don't really understand why my brain is like this. I wish I could be more steadfast with my belief.

It's very simple. This universe and all its magnificence has a creator. The universe began to exist, and anything that began to exists needs a cause. That cause is God, he is the un-caused cause that causes everything. I think these verses sum it up very well.

**Sūrat l-Tūr**

&gt;[35] Or were they created by nothing, or were they the creators [of themselves]?

&gt;[36] Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Rather, they are not certain.

And I think humans beings tend to forget their own creation, and doubt another one. This is the dilemma I find many atheists have. They think Heaven and Hell aren't real, and anything they can't see doesn't exist. But why? Did Allah let us see the creation of the heavens and earth? Did he let us see the creation of ourselves in our mothers womb? We just suddenly existed. The difference is that we can study creation here in this life, so that we might remember Gods grandeur. He let's us observe how he brings a dead earth back to life, so that we might remember the one who caused that earth to come back to life, will also be able to bring us back to life. These are all observations that are supposed to make us remember God, and his power over all things. 

And just like how we suddenly existed the first time, we will be resurrected. The difference is, we won't be given a chance  ""study"" so we can remember. It will be too late, your chance to remember is right now, in this life. 

So what's so hard about fathoming the one who made everything the first time, can't repeat it? Because they have no faith, that's why. It's all a fairy-tale to them, yet their own creation can be labeled a miracle/fairy-tale by what they call *coincidences* that allowed life to occur. They're living in a miracle, yet they doubt another one. But people of faith remember that the one who created everything, can and will create it another time. They observe this creation, and they are reminded of the next one.
Just like Allah says:

**Sūrat Yā Sīn**

&gt;[78] And he presents for Us an example and forgets his [own] creation. He says, ""Who will give life to bones while they are disintegrated?""

&gt;[79] Say, ""He will give them life who produced them the first time; and He is, of all creation, Knowing.""

So every-time you have any doubt, remember your creation, and this universes creation. The one who made it the first time, can make it again. It's really the easiest thing, that removes all doubt you'll have.

* * *

&gt;I also struggle between knowing what should be attributed to allah and what I have control over, the lines seem blurred. I don't want to be the guy that blames Allah for me not getting out of bed but at the same time struggle with knowing what are the limits of the responsibility of my actions.

This is a complicated topic I don't think I'm qualified to answer. Maybe u/bathera could answer it because I don't want to say something I don't know much about. 

* * *

&gt;I feel like I have weakness in my mind or weakness in my faith .

I think it's in both. Your lack of faith makes weakness in mind, and the weakness in mind, further weakens your faith. Insha'Allah reading the Qur'an, contemplating and remembering, will help you increase in faith, and your mind will find rest in that remembrance. Don't let the false illusions or rhetoric get to you, it's all lies. Believe in what you already know is true, deep down inside.

**Sūrat l-Anʿām**

&gt;[116] And if you obey most of those upon the earth, they will mislead you from the way of Allah. They follow not except assumption, and they are not but falsifying.

In the end, God existing is not something that we *learn* or make ourselves believe. It is something we already know deep down on the inside. This life, and especially the Qur'an, are supposed to make us *remember* what we already know. That is why I use the word remember over and over again. 

**Sūrat l-Qamar**

&gt;[40] And We have certainly made the Qur'an easy for remembrance, **so is there any who will remember**?

**Sūrat l-Qaṣaṣ**

Is this because his credibility is reduced if you permit such a thing?

This is basically a cop-out of not having to deal with the Old Testament because of Christ. I could have a whole discussion about this, but I won't even get started. But what I find confusing is that if Christ is God, then he is also the one who inspired the Old Testament. Muhammad's credibility against the age he married Aisha is the most foolish thing I've ever heard. It's a basic, elementary attack from Christians, to attack and malign the character of the Prophet. Your hypocrisy regarding the matter is *staggering*. Time periods change, and the age of marriage changes. As soon as menstruation begins, the girl is ready to be married. There are so many different variable that go into this that you seem incapable of fathoming, which doesn't show a flaw in Muhammad or Islam or even the Old Testament and Jews, but shows the flaw in the intellectual capability of yourself. It also shows the ignorance you have regarding the Old Testament and Jews which you should be familiar with but you're not, who married at a very much younger age then Muhammad. Am I saying this because I think they were wrong? Absolutely not. I am capable of understanding that under different circumstances, such as low life expectancy, people were married at much younger ages thousands of years ago. I only bring up the fact to point out your blatant hypocrisy.

* * *

&gt;It is also not true that I ""accept prophets."" The entirety of my faith exists in whole as the person of Christ Jesus. What Abraham or Moses or Jeremiah said has been eclipsed or fulfilled in Christ. There is a certain goodness in dwelling on the history of prophets but the coming of Christ made prophets no longer necessary to sustain a relationship with God.

Well this is just a cop-out again with the fairy-tale that you've made yourself believe. Jesus was just another Prophet in Islam, and will marry in his second coming. Also, this paragraph has nothing to do with the issue at hand we were discussing, but I understand the need to always put any issue you find in the OT and NT with the fulfillment of Christ. It's a typical cop-out many Christians use.

* * *

&gt;It is in the Bible.

That says when she gave birth, not when he married her. I want the age of consummation.

* * *

&gt;Why some seem to want to punish others seems to be antithetical to any good faith.

See, these kind of statements or what get you down-votes. In Islam, there is something called a Sharia Law, similar to the Law of Moses. Or did you forget that your God inspired that to him, and all the horrific things found in the Old Testament came from your Trinitarian God, which consequently means Jesus as well? Even Jesus himself said he came to *fulfill* the Law, and not abolish it, which the false Prophet Paul did. 

**Mark 5**

&gt;[17] ""Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; **I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.**

&gt;[19] ""Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

&gt;[20] ""For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.

So all those laws and punishments in Islam, which are derived from the Old Testament? Yea, Jesus came to *fulfill* them. The only reason he didn't carry them out, is because he was being *persecuted* and wasn't in power to be able to. When Muhammad was *persecuted*, he was basically a copy of Jesus. Turn the other cheek etc. When Muhammad received authoritative power, he lead an authoritative role which meant keeping his society safe, and spreading the message of Islam. And guess what will happen when Jesus comes back? He will be *just* like Muhammad, an authoritative leader who will wage war against his enemies, and slaughter them unto his footstool. Just like the Old Testament, and Jesus himself said. The idea of Jesus you believe? Fairy-tale Paul made up. What's even more shocking, is that your ""savior"" didn't even come for you gentiles, he came for the Jews. Paul is the one who preached the fake image of Jesus to gentiles, when Jesus said he *only* came for the Children of Israel.

**Matthew 15**

&gt;[24] But he answered and said, **I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.**

**Matthew 10**

&gt;[5] These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, **Go not into the way of the Gentiles**, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not:

&gt;[6] But go rather to the lost sheep of the **house of Israel.**

* * *

&gt; I also discovered quite accidentally some of Mohammad's history that I am uncomfortable with, that makes it more difficult for me to accept his goodness. The defense of these things seem to center on arguments that a 9 year old girl can consent to sex and that others were doing it too.

Stop reading *anti-Islamic* websites that only are in favor of your biased view, and feed into your insecure faith, so that you may feel better about yourself. Also, grow in your intellectual capabilities and understand that people lived thousands of years ago, under different circumstances. Get out of your 21st century time-frame and open your horizons buddy. People thousands of years ago lived too, and they had different norms than you. Doesn't make you superior to them. It only shows your inferiority by being ignorant to such facts.

And by the way, Isaac consummated the marriage with Rebecca at 10 years old. The book of Jasher, which is brought up in the Old Testament but is not a canonized part of it, gives Rebecca's age.

**Joshua 10**

&gt;[13] And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. **Is not this written in the book of Jashar?** And the sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.

What does the book of Jasher say?

**Jasher 24**

&gt;[39-40] And they all blessed the Lord who brought this thing about, and they gave him Rebecca, the daughter of Bethuel, for a wife for Isaac. And the young woman was of very comely appearance, **she was a virgin, and Rebecca was ten years old in those days.**

&gt;[44] And Isaac took Rebecca and she became his wife, and he brought her into the tent.

6377,"&gt;Jewish law provided that it was not marriage until consummation. What you are referring to is a betrothal, which is similar to our notion of an engagement. It can be thought of as a beginning to marriage that is not complete until consummation.

There's the same notion in Islam. Muhammad married Aisha at six, consummated at nine. So it's quite hypocritical when many of the Old Testament Prophets did the same thing. With regards to this comment: 

&gt;If he is a Man of God, he would change the culture or die in God's grace.

This comment could be redirected at many of the Old Testament Prophets. Instead of critiquing Muhammad, begin with critiquing the Prophets you actually accept.

&gt;Issac was three score (60 years) when they consummated, putting Rebecca well into her 20's.

Sweetie, I'm a previous agnostic from a Christian family who converted to Islam. I myself challenged Islam as much as I could. No one challenged the religion more than I. The more I challenged, the more clear the evidence was. Islam held it's own against my challenges, something Christianity could never do.

&gt;Islam is a lie. You can come out of it. I encourage you to.

So much insecurity it's so sad. Sure, you cling on to a book you don't know who wrote, that has historical as well as scientific errors. That has discrepancies all through out it. A religion that has doctrines 90% of you don't understand, such as the trinity. 

While the religion you claim is a lie, has a book scholars say is inimitable. A book that was revealed orally with no editing for 23 years, yet is the most eloquent Arabic writing to date. A book that was revealed to an illiterate man, who recited poetry not even the **best** of poets and masters of the Arabic language could rival. They called him a magician. A book that is historically and scientifically accurate. And lastly, a book your own scripture prophesied:

**Isaiah 29**

&gt;[12] and the writing is delivered to him that is not learned, saying: **'Read this, I pray thee'; and he saith: 'I am not learned.'**

What did Muhammad say when the angel told him to recite the Qur'an? He said, **I am not learned**.

So I'll stick with that book, instead of yours.

Oh please. I'm not at all defensive. I know Muhammad married a nine year old and see nothing wrong with it, given his time period. It is you who is insecure, given that you are denying major scholarly works and giving your own interpretation. Also, by your comment history, it is you who is insecure in you faith, but I like your reverse psychology ;).

&gt;~~I would also say that when you say ""Most Exegesis"", again, you mean, ""this one guy named Rabbah and his buddy Gen. R."" You claim that you can find a minority of scholars who say anything and then say that most say she was 3 when, in fact, Two say she was 3, Three say she was 14, and about 4 or 5 say she was 10. It is you who have chosen the minority voice on the matter. And you've done so, as far as i can tell, to defend the Mohammed's marriage. I am not trying to attack Mohammed nor his marriage, leave that be. I'm just saying that you're age of rebecca as 3 years old at her wedding is 1) the minority opinion, not the majority that you claim, and 2) inconsistent with the text itself.~~

More assumptions and no evidences. You say the minority say Rebecca was three years old, when that is a lie. **Most** Rabbis say she was three years old. Give me the **primary sources** in which a Rabbi says she is fourteen years old, and then show me a source that says that is the *majority* opinion.

The **minority** opinion would not be in an *official exegesis* of the Old Testament. The **majority** opinion would be.

6381,"Firstly, link me the verses that you're speaking about. You are giving commentaries on them, when you can just link the verses and I can read them myself. I don't want your bias commentary.

&gt;My argument is thus as follows: If some scholars put her age at 3, and some say 14, we should ask which of those is most consistent with the text that those numbers are taken from to decide which is right. So, I ask you, which age girl do you think more capable of carrying water pitchers (~25 pounds in weight) and engaging in adult dialogue? I would say, and I think you would too if you are being honest, that 14 is a better number that more closely adheres to the text.

Your argument doesn't matter, reputable scholars matter. The age *most* scholars say Isaac married Rebecca is 3 years old. As I said, there is a minority of scholars which say Aisha was 19/20. We go with what the *majority* say. The majority say Rebecca was 3 years old.

&gt;**For when Abraham came from Mount Moriah, he was informed that Rebecca had been born. Isaac was then thirty-seven years old**, for at that time Sarah died, and from the time that Isaac was born until the “Binding” [of Isaac], when Sarah died, were thirty-seven years, for she was ninety years old when Isaac was born, and one hundred and twenty-seven when she died, as it is stated (above 23:1): “The life of Sarah was [a hundred and twenty seven years.”] **This makes Isaac thirty-seven years old, and at that time, Rebecca was born. He waited for her until she would be fit for marital relations-three years-and then married her.** — [From Gen. Rabbah 57:1]

Johann Buxtorf who cites Rashi and elaborates in his book: 

&gt;**“Rabbi Solomon in his comment on Genesis, says that Rebecca, when she was married to Isaac, was but three Years of Age.** His words run thus, ‘When Abraham was come from Mount Moria, he received the joyful News of Rebecca. Isaac was at that Time Thirty seven years old; and then did Sarah die. The time, from birth of Isaac to the death of Sarah, was Thirty seven Years, And Sarah was Ninety Years old when Isaac was born; and One Hundred and Twenty Seven Years old when she died: As it is said in Gen 23:1 . Sarah was one hundred and twenty-seven years old. **Behold, the Age of Isaac was Thirty Seven Years, at the Time of the Birth of Rebecca. And when he had waited for her three Years, till she was fit for marriage, he took her to wife.”**

&gt;**According to this Account, Rebecca was a very notable Girl at three years of age. But that a girl of three Years old is fit for marriage, is maintained very plainly in the Jewish writings; particularly, in Emek Hamelech**, in the following passage, ‘our blessed sags, of blessed memory, say, **that a female is not fit for marriage, ‘till she is arrived at the Age of three years and one day.’ The Talmud supports these Sages here, in the part entitled Avoda Sara. And the Sanhedrin says, A daughter, who is of the age of three years and one day, is, by being bedded with a Man, lawfully married.”**

It's hypocritical to speak about Muhammad, when it's apparent you haven't read your own scripture well to see Isaac married a three year-old. Redirect all your points about Muhammad, back to yourself and the many Prophets of the Old Testament, you as well u/papercarder.

The Qur'an *is* the literal word of God, but also has interpretation. We have thousands of primary sources for the Qur'an such as the Sunnah, hadith, and historical events.

Sources saying Rebecca wasn't three years old. I don't want your biased commentary, *give me reputable sources*.

&gt;If the majority of the prophets married young, and its immoral, I'm fine with that. Because the prophets of the old testament were not sinless as Muhammad is purported to be, nor are they held up to be sources of emulation as Muhammad is purported to be.

The Prophets of the Old Testament were to be emulated by their followers. The difference with Muhammad, is he is the *last* Prophet. So we try our best to emulate his character, just like previous nations emulated their own respective Prophets. Isaac was the example in his time, Moses was the examples in his, David was in his, Jesus was in his etc. Muhammad is the *last*, so all Muslims will emulate him like previous nations did to their respective prophets, until the day of judgement. It's going to be a shocker when the *real* Jesus comes back, the human being, and will be the exact same as the Prophet Muhammad. Waging war and shit like the OT says, and what will be the icing on the cake? If he marries a 9 year old to. Your fairy-tale is going to go up in flames, I just wish I'd be alive to see it. 

&gt;The fact of the matter is if Muhammad is a jewel among stones and to be emulated in every respect then this case is not different. If Muhammad and Aisha hopped in a time machine and came to 2016 he'd go to jail and she would go to Child Protective Services.

No, they weren't immoral in his time period. People married young, as soon as you got your period you were eligible to be married. Just as you said about Rebecca, that children were more mature for their age back then. A nine year old then, isn't a nine year old today. As I also said, less than 200 years ago the age of consent was around the same age as Aisha. That's 200 years ago, not 1400. 

Almost all the Prophets of God married young, are you saying the *majority* of God's Prophets are immoral? It's funny how unbelievable biased you are. But I guess you have to be or you wouldn't be talking.

&gt;So if I imitating the Prophet and married a nine year old I would be doing something immoral? Why?

I already explained this above. A nine year old 1400 years ago, isn't a nine year old today. Nine year old's were responsible for the house hold, cooking and cleaning, basically everything that an adult would be, and that's how they saw them. As adults eligible for marriage.

6401,"&gt;It does not matter, you are claiming that God is referring to him. Look at the verse, unless you can provide proof that this refers to other than those who say (interpretation of the meaning) ""We believe in Allah and the Last Day"", it's obvious that Allah (subhanahu wa ta'ala) isn't referring to him. To do so is lying about God, that's why I'm being strict about it. You can say he sounds like the Hypocrites, but you can't make it seem like Allah (subhanahu wa ta'ala) is referring to him without proof.

You haven't even read it correctly. Let me quote it so you can read it correctly, and instead of thinking you're right

**Sūrat l-bBaqarah**

&gt;[6] Indeed, those who disbelieve - it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them - they will not believe.

&gt;[7] Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and over their vision is a veil. And for them is a great punishment.

&gt;[8] And of the people are some who say, ""We believe in Allah and the Last Day,"" but they are not believers.

&gt;[9] They [think to] deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive not except themselves and perceive [it] not.

&gt;[10] In their hearts is disease, so Allah has increased their disease; and for them is a painful punishment because they [habitually] used to lie.

&gt;[11] And when it is said to them, ""Do not cause corruption on the earth,"" they say, ""We are but reformers.""

&gt;[12] Unquestionably, it is they who are the corrupters, but they perceive [it] not.

&gt;[13] **And when it is said to them, ""Believe as the people have believed,"" they say, ""Should we believe as the foolish have believed?"" Unquestionably, it is they who are the foolish, but they know [it] not.**

Allah is not simply talking about hypocrites. He is also talking about people who are told to believe, and say they won't believe because they aren't foolish, basically atheists like Sam Harris. Allah says they are the foolish ones, but they do not know. So the verses aren't *only* for Munafiqun, and can be used for an atheist as well.

The context of that verse is that Muslims made a treaty with Pagans. The Pagans broke the treaty, and killed Muslim children, women and destroyed property. God told them to retaliate, but to a certain extent and not to be oppressors. [Example of contextualization of the Qur'an](http://i.imgur.com/kqaQpM4.png).

&gt;Isn't it a perfect account of God's words for then and for all time and Muhammad a perfect source of emulation for all people at all times? Why would it be wrong for me to marry a 9 year old but ok for Muhammad to do so? Am I expected to be more moral than Muhammad?

Gods words *are* for all time. The Qur'an says nothing about marrying children so you're just spewing nonsense. Also, Muhammad married a 9 year old because it was the *norm* back then. Just as it was the *norm* for Jews to marry young children, even *before* puberty. Muhammad's worst enemies didn't bring up his marriage, because it was something normal they didn't even think twice about. That wouldn't be the case today, but you can't say that's immoral when it isn't in your time period. Only in the 1880's was the age of consent **7** in [Delaware](https://www.google.com/#q=age+of+consent+delaware+7). That was less then 200 years ago, let alone 1400 years ago.

To say that Muhammad married a 9 year old, 1400 years ago, and Muslims should to, is like saying Muhammad rode a camel to work, and we should too.

I'm not making Rebecca three years old, Jewish scholars and Rabbis say she is. I understand that you would rather deny something so that you wouldn't be accused of being a delusional hypocrite. I have quoted you Rabbi exegesis and Jewish scholarly work. Why don't you quote me scholarly work that states otherwise?

&gt;No. Jesus is the man hypostatically united to the Logos. You should read Plotinus to get a very closely similar idea to the Trinity in Greek thought.

So the son has nothing to do with the Old Testament? Whose responsible for the Old Testament? If it's the Holy Spirit, but not the son and Father, how is that *one* God?

&gt;Why? The Qu'ran is supposed to be a literal dictation from God and the ummah is governed by it. It's not my fault it says what it says, especially when it says to do something that is actually practiced.

Well you have yet to quote something that says you can marry a child and rape them, only your ignorant assumptions. I, on the other hand, have quoted exegesis and scripture.

&gt;Three hypostases of the same undivided essence. The Father, the ultimate origin of all, the Son, the rational personality and self-knowledge of God, and the Holy Spirit, the life-giving personality through which God operates in the world.

Great, they all are one. So they all are responsible for the Old Testament no?

&gt;I'm not a hypocrite for repeating what your own scholars say. Stop acting like you gain some moral high ground for screaming about ""hypocrisy.""

Yes you are. First of all, you haven't quoted anything from a scholar, only assumptions. Please quote things for me. Actually, I do have the higher moral ground. I'm not a hypocrite who speaks form assumptions and doesn't quote anything from scholars. You on the other hand, have quoted nothing and have only made assumptions.

Why not? It's not a matter of differing theology, it's fact. Isaac married Rebecca when she was three. If you don't want to accept that but talk about Muhammad, you're being a delusional hypocrite. 

&gt;Sorry, Rashi and the Chabniks but that aint right.

*Suuuuureee*. Rabbis don't know their scripture... *rolls eyes*. Johann Buxtorf who cites Rashi and elaborates in his book: 

&gt;**“Rabbi Solomon in his comment on Genesis, says that Rebecca, when she was married to Isaac, was but three Years of Age.** His words run thus, ‘When Abraham was come from Mount Moria, he received the joyful News of Rebecca. Isaac was at that Time Thirty seven years old; and then did Sarah die. The time, from birth of Isaac to the death of Sarah, was Thirty seven Years, And Sarah was Ninety Years old when Isaac was born; and One Hundred and Twenty Seven Years old when she died: As it is said in Gen 23:1 . Sarah was one hundred and twenty-seven years old. **Behold, the Age of Isaac was Thirty Seven Years, at the Time of the Birth of Rebecca. And when he had waited for her three Years, till she was fit for marriage, he took her to wife.”**

&gt;**According to this Account, Rebecca was a very notable Girl at three years of age. But that a girl of three Years old is fit for marriage, is maintained very plainly in the Jewish writings; particularly, in Emek Hamelech**, in the following passage, ‘our blessed sags, of blessed memory, say, **that a female is not fit for marriage, ‘till she is arrived at the Age of three years and one day.’ The Talmud supports these Sages here, in the part entitled Avoda Sara. And the Sanhedrin says, A daughter, who is of the age of three years and one day, is, by being bedded with a Man, lawfully married.”**

6410,"&gt;Numerous scholars have affirmed this means a right to marry little girls.

LOL. That verse says nothing about raping a child. Desperate much?

&gt;Again, you have no idea what you're talking about. Your understanding of Christianity is on level with a kindergartener. ""Jesus"" did not ""write the Bible"" or whatever nonsense you think it is. The Scriptures were written by men inspired by the Holy Spirit.

I understand, if I don't, enlighten me. The Holy Spirit is God, Jesus is God and the Father is God. They're three in one. Whatever the Holy Spirit inspired, was also from Jesus and the Father since they're *one*, or are they not one?

&gt;Oh, for fuck's sake, get over yourself. A historical record that someone did something doesn't mean it's a suggestion to do the same.

Then don't talk about the Qur'an if you don't want us to do the same. 

&gt;Jesus said nothing in the in the OT. You don't know what you're talking about. You sound like a ratheist who said the shahada, that's how bad your understanding is.

Is Jesus not part of the trinity? Is Jesus not one with the Holy Spirit and the Father? If the Holy spirit inspired the OT, then the son did as well, unless they aren't one in the same thing. I'm sorry if I don't understand the trinity, but you can't blame me. 90% of Christendom doesn't. 

&gt;He gave an instruction to howling savages in the desert on how to conduct war. Not an instruction for the whole human race to follow.

See how beautiful it is when you give context and not generalize? I already knew this, but I wanted you to explain, so you can contextualize. But when it comes to the Qur'an you don't do that. That is where your hypocrisy lies. So stop doing it because it only backfires on yourself, and makes you look incompetent in your own scripture when making such accusations.

6429,"Well we could discuss this in detail in another thread, but I'll give as short of an example as I can.

Based on recent excavations of Hieroglyphics, we learn that Egyptians called their rulers by different terms in different time periods. In the Bible, the term Pharaoh is used incorrectly. During Moses lifetime, the ruler was called Pharaoh. The Bible gets this correct:

**Exodus 2**

&gt;[15] Now when **Pharaoh** heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of **Pharaoh**, and dwelt in the land of Midian; and he sat down by a well.

But during the lifetime of Prophet Joseph, the ruler was not called Pharaoh, he was called *King*. The Bible regarding Joseph:

**Genesis 41**

&gt;[14]Then **Pharaoh** sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. And he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto **Pharaoh**.

The Qur'an on the other hand, get's this historical account correct. The Qur'an in regards to Moses lifetime:

&gt;Moses said: ""O **Pharaoh!** I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds. [7:104]

The Qur'an regarding Prophet Josephs lifetime:

&gt;And the **King** said: Surely I see seven fat kine which seven lean ones devoured; and seven green ears and (seven) others dry: O chiefs! explain to me my dream, if you can interpret the dream. [12:43]

* * *

Also, something that is debatable accurate in the Qur'an, which raises issues for Christians is the Exodus event. According to the Bible, two million people were part of the event. There is no archaeological evidence for a group that large in number, wandering around the desert, when there most definitely should be. The Bible:

**Exodus 12**

&gt;[37] And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, beside children.

The Qur'an:

&gt;And We inspired to Moses, ""Travel by night with My servants; indeed, you will be pursued."" Then Pharaoh sent among the cities gatherers [And said], ""**Indeed, those are but a small band**!"" [26:52-54]

Based on the Qur'an, the number of people in the Exodus event was very small, which would explain scarce evidence for the event.

During Uthmans reign, the Qur'an was written from the main copy that Abu Bark gathered. This book was kept with Hafsah (one of the Prophets wives).

This would stop any differing between the people and how they recited the Qur'an, and everyone was in agreement over this. The thousands of companions all *agreed*,  that the Qur'an Uthman canonized, which was compiled by Abu Bakr, was the one and only Qur'an they should recite. This prevented future issues with the differing readings of the Qur'an. If they didn't agree, they wouldn't have burned anything and we would have different readings of the Qur'an by now.

**Note 2:** The different readings aren't a different Qur'an. The Qur'an was revealed in 7 readings, or like I think of them, accents. It was all the same wording, just the pronunciation differed. Having the official canonized Qur'an in one reading prevented future issues and divisions. 

* * *

Also, the Qur'an is not put together based on the size of the Chapter. It was revealed to Muhammad by Jibreel how to compile the Qur'an. Yes, it does go from long to short Surahs, but not uniformly. 

And regarding your last point, it basically is divine providence. God made the Qur'an easy on the tongue so that many people would remember it:

&gt;And We have certainly made the Qur'an easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember? [54:17]

Throughout all the mass memorization of the Qur'an throughout the years, we still have only *one* Qur'an. Usually memorization allows more fallibility such as additions, or subtractions, or mispronunciations that accumulate over time, and create a division between the original text, and the new memorized text. This does not happen in the case of the Qur'an, with everyone, no matter where their location, relaying the *exact* same Qur'an. If the previous issues regarding memorizing did occur to the Qur'an, we'd have multiple versions of it, but we don't. Just look at the Bible. It was written down, yet not one manuscript is the *exact* same. While the Qur'an, which was memorized, has *nothing* changed. Just as God said:

&gt;Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur'an and indeed, We will be its guardian. [15:9]

6442,"&gt;What religion was Mohammed born into?

Muhammad was born in Arabia surrounded by Idol worshipers.

&gt;If Allah is powerless to stop ppl from corrupting his message how can you trust the Koran ?

We can trust the Qur'an for a variety of reasons. It was compiled by Abu-Bakr two years after the Prophets death. Every verse in the Qur'an was written down and had two witnesses. Prophet Muhammad supervised each verse, and told them which verse is in which chapter, as well as the chapter orders. The Qur'an was memorized by thousands of people as well, since it was revealed in poetry and Arabians memorized poetry very well. Thousands of people who have never met each other, all across different lands, memorized the Qur'an and relayed the same thing. There was not an ounce of a difference between what someone in Mecca relayed, and what someone thousands of miles away relayed. If there was, we would have multiple versions of the Qur'an, with many people recalling different things they memorized, but we don't have that. And in the end, Allah promises to save the *last* revelation he sent to mankind from corruption. In 1400 years, we haven't had *one* different Qur'an and it is the same way it was revealed. He has kept his promise.

&gt;If Allah deceives ppl who follow his prophets, how you know hes not deceiving you?

Allah did not deceive anyone. I'm assuming this is regarding Christians. It's very simple. Jesus was a Prophet of God who came to the Children of Israel with clear miraculous signs. They denied him and wanted him crucified to prove he wasn't the Messiah. God did not allow his Prophet to be murdered by the Jews, so he saved him. It appeared to them that Jesus was crucified, but God saved him and raised him to himself. The corrupted Jews, like Paul, made up Christianity, all based around the crucifixion of Jesus. God did not deceive anyone, but it was Paul who did. Even if Jesus was crucified and died like the many other Prophets that Jews murdered, what right would that give people to call Jesus God and say he died for their sins? None whatsoever. They strayed from the straight path that God made clear, and they misguided themselves.

&gt; why do muslims cite references to Muhammad in the bible, doesn't the Koran say that the bible is currupted?

We only quote the Bible when we're speaking to Christians. That is their witness, so we use it against them. We don't need the Bible to know Muhammad was a Prophet, but they do. And since *some* of the Bible is still the words of God, it still contains *some* truths.

&gt;The bible was compiled around 300 ad, islam was created around 600 ad, how is it possible for it to be currupted so quickly?

Pretty easy. You have a Prophet doing miraculous signs, calling himself the son of God, which was a term Jews used before as they called themselves sons of God. It was an innocent term, which meant a *very* righteous person. If you were a righteous person, you were the son of God. But when you go to preach to Romans and Greeks who worship Hercules and Zeus, and tell them Jesus was the son of God, and that God is a trinity, and that he died for the sins of the world, they eat it up. Thus the Gospel writers literally thought Jesus was the begotten son of God, and that he died for their sins, and that God was three in one. They thought Jesus was like Hercules, both divine and human. 

&gt; How come archeologists never find the uncurrupted versions of the ot and nt?

I don't know.

&gt;Did Muhammed actually marry and have sex with a prepubescent girl?

Muhammad married Aisha at the age of 9. It was common 1400 years ago to marry at such an age. The enemies of Muhammad never brought up his marriage to Aisha because it wasn't anything new to them. Also, only in the 1880's was the age of consent **7** in [Delaware](https://www.google.com/#q=age+of+consent+delaware+7).

6443,"&gt;Really? What do they have them whipped for?

Yea. It's just something about Muslim women, in specific middle eastern women. They're very authoritative and usually the bosses in a Muslim household. They're the *behind the scene* type bosses, if you get what I mean. 

&gt;Okay that's interesting. May I ask why that is? 

Well, from my understanding, they pity western women.

They don't understand why western women take so much time with their appearance, to get the approval of men. They only have their husbands to worry about.

They don't understand how your husband would let you have a job, unless you really needed one to support yourself. They think it's very sad that you have to work, as well as cook and clean, as well as be a mother. They basically think you do the tasks of both a man and a women, when you should only be doing one.

Just these few things pop in my head. I'm sure there is plenty more. By the way, I'm a western female convert so I'm not being bias.

But I did not go through the struggle of learning about Islam to let my child have to struggle like I did.

It's like parents who lived a difficult life as children, and worked their way to live a comfortable life. Why would they leave their child to struggle the way they did, when the whole point of the struggle was to create a better life for them, and their children?

I believe with *absolute certainty* that Islam is the true religion, and I would teach my children the same. I would teach them all the things I know, and how *all* other religions are incorrect and why. I would relay the message, but the guidance would come from Allah. 

I'm very sure they wouldn't want to change their religion after that. But if they did, then I would've done my job and will answer to my Lord about them.

Song of Solomon in the OT is a book thought to be book about future Prophecies. Some people like to say this book is speaking about Solomon's wife, but that's a lie. It's regarded as an allegorical/metaphorical book about the future. From www.jewishencyclopedia.com by Emil. G Hirsh/Crawford Howell Tot:

&gt;The oldest known interpretation of the Song is **allegorical**: The Midrash and the Targum represent it as depicting the relations between God and Israel. The allegorical conception of it passed over into the Christian Church, and has been elaborated by a long line of writers from Origen down to the present time, the deeper meaning being assumed to be the relation between God or Jesus and the Church or the individual Soul.

Now let me quote a verse.

&gt;My beloved is *white and ruddy, pre-eminent above ten thousand.* Song of Solomon 5:10

This verse speaks about the appearance of this future person, as well as the number of people who will be with him. This person is *white and ruddy*. Next verse:

&gt;רֹאשׁוֹ, כֶּתֶם פָּז; קְוֻצּוֹתָיו, תַּלְתַּלִּים, שְׁחֹרוֹת, כָּעוֹרֵב.

&gt;His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are curled, and black as a raven.

This person has curly hair, and his hair is black. Note, the Hebrew word for raven, could be translated as *arab* as well. Description of Muhammad:

&gt;His hair was neither very curly nor very straight, but had a *slight wave* in it... The complexion of Prophet Muhammad was *white with redness in it*. Shamaa-il Tirmidhi- Chapter 1- Hadith no.6

Let me quote part of Solomon 5:10:

&gt;*pre-eminent above ten thousand.*

Muhammad, when he went to Mecca:

&gt;Narrated Ibn Abbas: The Prophet left Medina (for Mecca) **in the company of ten thousand** (Muslim warriors) in (the month of) Ramadan, and that was eight and a half years after his migration to Medina... Sahih Bukhari - Book No. 59, Hadith No. 574

* * *

Deuteronomy 33:2

&gt;And he said: The LORD came from Sinai, and rose from Seir unto them; He shined forth from **mount Paran**, and He came from the **myriads holy**, at His right hand was a fiery **law unto them.**

Mount Paran is known in the Biblical world to be where the Ishmaelites settled, being the region of Arabia i.e Mecca. The word *myriad* is usually translated to ten thousand men, because in classical history, *myriad* referred to a unit of ten thousand. This person will bring a law with him, which is what Muhammad brought.

Deuteronomy 33:3

&gt;Yea, He loveth the peoples, all His holy ones--they are in Thy hand; and they sit down at Thy feet, **receiving of Thy words.**

Someone will come from Arabia among ten thousand men, he is beloved to God and will deliver words of God to the people, basically Muhammad, and the words of God, the Qur'an.

* * *

Song of Solomon 5:16, the metaphorical text speaking about the future:

Hebrew

&gt;חִכּוֹ, מַמְתַקִּים, וְכֻלּוֹ, מַחֲמַדִּים; זֶה דוֹדִי וְזֶה רֵעִי, בְּנוֹת יְרוּשָׁלִָם.

English

&gt;His mouth is most sweet; yea, he is *altogether lovely*. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.'

They translated the Hebrew word, which is pronounced *Muhammadim*, and is a **noun** in hebrew, to a verb in English as, *altogether lovely*. But the word in Hebrew is a noun, just so you know their tricks. Also, the *-im* is a plural of respect, just like Eloh*im*. This is the only time this word appears in the OT.

God promises to make Ismael's nation blessed and great.

Genesis 17:20

&gt;And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee; behold, I have **blessed him**, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and **I will make him a great nation.**

When has the nation of Ismael been blessed by God? Before Muhammad, the Arabs, the descendants of Ismael, were idol worshipers. Christian apologist say this just means great in number, but that is a lie. God says this nation will be *blessed* and *great*. What is a blessed and great nation according to God?

Deuteronomy 4:7-8

&gt;For what great nation is there, that hath God so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is whensoever we call upon Him?

&gt;And what great nation is there, that hath statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?

By the above verses, we conclude that a blessed and great nation to God, is a nation that worships the one true God of Abraham, and adheres to all the laws and commandments. When did the Idol worshiping Arabs become blessed and great? When Muhammad came to them as a Prophet.

This only a *few* examples. There's plenty more other people will probably point out. If not, I'll type some more up in a few.

6497,"Regarding the virgin birth by u/g3t_re4l:

* * * 
&gt;In order to understand why, we must understand that Allah(swt) never does anything for the sake of doing it. There is always a purpose behind everything that is done. Like wise, when Prophets(as) perform miracles, there is actually a reason why those particular miracles were chosen for that people over other types of miracles. The miracles chosen are often things that the people knew and understood well, or knew nothing about at all and therefore is a clear sign.

&gt;In this case, the Jews at the time of Jesus(pbuh) were actually quite advanced in the science of medicine. They had actually developed habits that were all about good health and it is actually in the NT, if one pays attention. As a sign to the Jews that Jesus, Isa(as) is a true Prophet of Allah(swt), Mary(as) conceived while still a virgin, something the Jews at the time knew was impossible. That is why the Quran make mention, that when they questioned Mary(as) about how Jesus(as) came about, she was told to refer to Jesus(as). Not only Jesus(pbuh) speaking as a new born baby, is a miracle, but it would confirm that Mary(as) was indeed a virgin, something they already knew because of her righteousness.

&gt;This is also why we see that many of the miracles of Jesus(pbuh) were also medical related, such as healing the blind, the crippled , the lepers and also bringing back the dead. The knew medicine well, and therefore knew that he was doing the impossible, unless given the authority from Allah(swt).",2015-12-25 01:28:40+00:00,cyakhn5,4.0,t1_cyak5hp,816.0,Christianity

6499,"Muslims are actually more Christian then Christians themselves. Christian, in the sense of following the actions and teachings of Christ, not Paul. We pray like Jesus did, we fast like Jesus did, we keep all the commandments like Jesus did etc.

To pass the threshold of today's Christianity into Islam, you would have to believe in one God, not a triune God. You'd believe Jesus is a Prophet of God. You'd have to pray to the God Jesus prayed to. You'd have to fast for the God Jesus fasted for. You'd have to keep all the OT commandments Jesus kept, with a little bit of an update. You'd stop saying Jesus died for your sins, pick up your own cross like Jesus said, and take on your sins for yourself. 

That way, you *actually* become a follower of Christ, and not of Paul. Muhammad only came to fix the image of Jesus that Paul ruined, so all that Muhammad taught, Jesus also taught. Christians like to say that Jesus was all love etc. but that's a lie. Jesus was passive because he was not in a position of power. He was being persecuted. Muhammad was also passive when he was not in a position of power and was being persecuted. 

When Muhammad gained power, that's when he led an authoritative role. Same thing with Jesus, he will return and have an authoritative role just like Muhammad had. He will wage war just like Muhammad did. Everything about Jesus and Muhammad is the same, from their character to their teachings. Jesus just didn't finish showing us his.

6502,"&gt;Having responsibilities has nothing to do with with reaching puberty.And I never said that said it's okay with me, just that it's a practise in some Muslim countires and the religious leaders support it.

The age of puberty differs, but not by much. If a girl gets her puberty at the age of nine 1400 years ago, and she's mentally mature enough to take on household responsibilities, then it would be fine for her to get married. Why wouldn't she? There's no college to go to, nothing to do but cook, clean, milk the cow. Delaying marriage until 18 would benefit with what in this girls situation? Nothing, so why not get married as soon as she could.  

&gt;And if the times are changed, as you say they did(and I agree with), how come most punishments are still kept the same?

Sharia is divine laws set by God. They do not change with time. 

On the other hand, reiterating the examples I used, the age of consent and means of travel are not divinely set, and can be subjected to time and change. Marrying a 9 year old would not look right in 2015, just as riding a camel to work instead of a car. Also, you can disagree with the punishments, but you still realize they are part of the religion you follow. If you don't, then that's what makes you not a *true* Muslim.

6503,"Oh, so you used a dictionary and came back. It's a great tool isn't it?

The Pharaoh was not simply drowned. The sea split for the Children of Israel to cross, then came crashing down on him and his army. Waves hundreds of feet high, crashing down to the seabed, would disintegrate parts of a body and leave it deformed, a body would not remain intact. Have you ever seen the body of someone who jumped off the Golden Gate bridge?It's a crumpled mess. It doesn't remain intact. That's leaving out the decomposition the Pharaohs body underwent before he was retrieved and mummified. 

Whats even funnier, is that no scripture speaks about this fact except the Qur'an. The Qur'an is the only scripture that claims the Pharaohs body would be *saved* to be retrieved in the future. The fact that we have his body intact and not deformed, is only proof of the Qur'an's claim. Why would a desert Bedouin say that God will preserve the body of the Pharaoh and allow it to be retrieved in the future? Why not just be vague like the Bible and not mention it at all? What significance would that do to his claim? Is it a coincidence that this Pharaohs body was *actually* retrieved awhile back? 

I understand that you're purposely being dense, and you want to prove to yourself that the Qur'an isn't divine. That's fine, many before were like you, and many after to come will be like you. But all your attempts fail, with no-one who actually studies the Qur'an claiming it contains contradiction. You're only fooling yourself. When the truth comes to you, and asks you of nothing but minuscule things for your salvation, you deny. The word has been proven, that many will never believe. Just as God says in the Qur'an:

&gt;Already the word has come into effect upon most of them, so they do not believe. [36:7]

&gt;And it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them - they will not believe. [36:10]

&gt;How regretful for the servants. There did not come to them any messenger except that they used to ridicule him. [36:30]

&gt;But they denied the truth when it came to them, so they are in a confused condition. [50:5]

You might think I'm a brainwashed apologist, but I was more similar to you then you think, when I used to be an agnostic. Islam and the Qur'an changed that. I only spent time responding to you, in the hope that you may change and seriously research Islam, even though I type a little rude =P. If you sincerely research the Qur'an, you will only help yourself. And ridiculing it without the slightest bit of knowledge about it, will only hurt yourself. If you *sincerely* research Islam and still think it's a lie, then that's fine. Your prerogative, but what you're doing right now is plain ignorance and denial, something I used to do as well, which is why I can notice it when I see it.

6504,"&gt;all the Muslims who have told me that, as a Christian, I am also accepted in heaven in their faith, they were wrong, lying, or misinformed?

Misinformed. 

&gt;How is ""Allah"" different from ""God""? He is supposedly the same one who sent all the prophets, no?

Allah is God. He is the one who sent all the Prophets, from Noah, Moses, Jesus to Muhammad.

&gt;And here I was thinking that at least Islam was more tolerant than Christianity in the respect that it accepted all people of the Book ...

You are people of the book. But you do not get salvation if you have received the *correct* message of Islam, and reject Muhammad as the final Prophet.

&gt;""Surely those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Christians, and the Sabians -- whoever believes in God and the Last Day and does good, they shall have their reward from their Lord. And there will be no fear for them, nor shall they grieve."" [2:62]

This verse is regarding to Jews before Jesus, and Christians before Muhammad. Once Muhammad came, if you deny him, then you aren't saved. Just as the Jews who rejected Jesus, weren't saved. What God says about Christians:

&gt;And they say: The Beneficent Allah has taken (to Himself) a son. **Certainly you have uttered an atrocious thing.** [19:88-89]

On Judgement Day, Jesus will testify against *all* Christians, that he never claimed to be God. The person you believe will grant you salvation, will throw you in Hell to save himself from the anger of God, for what you attributed to him.

&gt;And when Allah will say: O Jesus son of Mary! did you say to men, Take me and my mother for two gods besides Allah he will say: Glory be to Thee, it did not befit me that I should say what I had no right to (say); if I had said it, Thou wouldst indeed have known it; Thou knowest what is in my mind, and I do not know what is in Thy mind, surely Thou art the great Knower of the unseen things. [5:116]

Christians are forbidden to enter the garden:

&gt;Certainly they disbelieve who say: Surely Allah, He is the Messiah, son of Marium; and the Messiah said: O Children of Israel! serve Allah, my Lord and your Lord. Surely whoever associates (others) with Allah, then Allah has **forbidden to him the garden**, and his abode is the fire; and there shall be no helpers for the unjust. [5:72]

No he did not. He believed that semen mixed with menstrual blood.

And this is in fact what we find happening; **for the natural substance of the menstrual fluid is to be classed as prime matter**.” (Aristotle. Generation of Animals.English trans. A. L. Peck, Heinemann. 1942 edition, page 111, 729a.)

6515,"The Qur'an.

The Qur'an has no logical explanation of it's emergence. It is considered to be the *best* Arabic writing and is regarded by many non-Muslims as inimitable. 

&gt;And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon Our Servant [Muhammad], then produce a Surah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses other than Allah , if you should be truthful. **But if you do not - and you will never be able to - then fear the Fire, whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.** [2:23-24]

I mean, it's a very grandiose statement to make, when someone in the future would be able to imitate it, but the author knows no-one can, and no-one ever will. 

The Qur'an was oral revelation for 23 years. The people would ask questions or be living in certain circumstances, and the revelation would come. There was no editing process, Muhammad was illiterate and spoke the Qur'an at random. He did not say *Oh no, that's not part of the Qur'an, erase that.* No editing process, oral speech, yet becomes the *most* eloquent Arabic literature known to man, with uniquely formatted topics. Critiques who reads the Qur'an, will say this books structure is impossible to be oral speech, and it must've been written down and edited. 

We have *thousands* of primary sources, and not one speak about Muhammad contemplating what to say or make up. Muhammad was surrounded by people almost, 24/7.

* * *

The Qur'an gets historical accounts correct, while other scripture does not. The Bible calls the ruler during Moses and Josephs time Pharaoh, while the Qur'an differentiates and calls the ruler during Moses time Pharaoh and Josephs time King. This is accurate because of recent discoveries of the Rosetta stone and hieroglyphics, and consequently we know they called their rulers by different titles in different time periods. Egyptian civilization was dead during Muhammad's time, he would have not known. If he had copied the Bible, which is the dumbest thing I've heard, he would've copied that mistake. Bible for Moses:

&gt;Now when **Pharaoh** heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian; and he sat down by a well. Exodus 2:15

Bible for Joseph:

&gt;Then **Pharaoh** sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. And he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto **Pharaoh.** Genesis 41:14

Qur'an for Moses:

&gt;Moses said: ""O **Pharaoh!** I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds. [7:104]

Qur'an for Joseph:

&gt;And the **King** said: Surely I see seven fat kine which seven lean ones devoured; and seven green ears and (seven) others dry: O chiefs! explain to me my dream, if you can interpret the dream. [12:43]

Bible get's it wrong, Qur'an gets it right.

* * *

Another debatable historical accurate statement found in the Qur'an, that's not found in the Bible. The Bible claims 600k men+ their families were part of the Exodus, making it about 2M people. Archaeologists and historians have excavated the land that is supposed to be where the Exodus took place, and they have found scarce remains and proofs. Some say the whole event is fiction, while some say it happened, but the number of them was *very* small. The Qur'an:

&gt;And We inspired to Moses, ""Travel by night with My servants; indeed, you will be pursued."" Then Pharaoh sent among the cities gatherers

&gt;[And said], ""Indeed, those are but a **small band**.

* * *

The Qur'an is scientifically accurate, with many things in it that no human could know. The Qur'an is a timeless book, so we cannot claim that it's incorrect in regards to science which might change in the future, science is changing and the Qur'an does not. Only a few hundred years ago scientists claimed the universe was eternal and stationary, while the Qur'an said otherwise. Had we believed science, over eternal words of God, we would have discounted the Qur'an, when only future findings proved it correct.

&gt;Have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and the earth were of one piece, then We parted them, and we made every living thing of water? Will they not then believe? [21:30]

&gt;And the heaven We constructed with strength, and indeed, We are [its] expander. [51:47]

Those verses are explicit, while other verses are subtle. Subtle being:

&gt;And the sun runs [on course] toward its stopping point. That is the determination of the Exalted in Might, the Knowing. [36:38]

Now we know that the sun has an orbit. If the sun was scientifically proven to be stationary, it would debunk the the whole book. Why would a human being make such scientific claims, with the possibility of it being incorrect? 

* * *

Also, the Qur'an has numerical patterns all throughout it. God says Adam and Jesus are the same in his eyes, he told them *Be*, and they were:

&gt;Indeed, the example of Jesus to Allah is like that of Adam. He created Him from dust; then He said to him, ""Be,"" and he was. [3:59]

Jesus and Adam are both brought up 25 times, all in separate chapters and verses, in except 2 or 1 verses I believe. Man and women are brought up 24 times each. Satan and angel, both 68 times each. Dunya (this life) and akhira (hereafter), both 115 times each. Month(shahr), 12 times. The word for day(yaum), 365 times. All mentions are scrambled throughout the Qur'an, and it would be impossible for a human to deliberately get the word counts correct, while speaking orally, for 23 years, at random, with no editing etc.

Also, the Qur'an has 114 chapters in a sequence of 1, 2, 3, etc. The number of verses in each chapter vary, the longer chapters come earlier and gradually reduce, but not uniformly. Example being the 1st chapter has 7 verse, 2nd has 286 verses, 3rd having 200, 4th having 176 etc. The Chapter numbers alternate between even and odd numbers, 1 is odd, 2 even, 3 is odd etc. But this is not the case with the number of verses some being even a number of times, or odd a number of times etc.

If you add the number of verses in each chapter, with the chapter number, you'll get 114 results. Example would be Chapter 1, has 7 verses.The sum of the Chapter # and verse # would be 8. Now do this for all the chapters of the Qur'an. You get 57 odd number results, and 57 even number results. Now if you take the sum of all the even results, you get the number 6236. This is the total of *all* verses in the Qur'an. I.e 7+286+200+...6=6236. If you take the total of the odd numbers, the result is 6555. This is the sum of all the chapter numbers. I.e 1+2+3+4...+114=6555. Just as God says:

&gt;And [by] the even [number] and the odd [89:3]

So this book has been calculated to precision. Not the work of a human being.

&gt;That he may know that they have conveyed the messages of their Lord; and **He has encompassed whatever is with them and has enumerated all things in number.** [72:28]

&gt;There is no one in the heavens and earth but that he comes to the Most Merciful as a servant. **He has enumerated them and counted them a [full] counting.** [19:93-94]

6517,"&gt;Your precise explanation to circumvent the contradiction does not make sense: either pharaoh is dead, which is normal after drowning and his body is there, nothing to act as a proof of anything, or pharaoh survives drowning, which demonstrates the power of god, therefore enlightening unbelievers. The second explanation is much more plausible and logical in context of the story telling.

No it's not. Your being pathetic. Let me explain it to you like a 5 year old so maybe you'll understand.

God drowned the Pharaoh, he died. A normal human body would decay after a few years, let alone 3000 years. So God points out, that he will save his body and allow it to be retrieved in the future, to be a sign for later generations. It's not a contradiction, you're just being purposely annoying and dumb. If that's a contradiction, then it's better for you not to read the Qur'an at all. Go learn what a contradiction is first.

&gt;You can have either 1. a contradiction 2. non-sense. Your call.

It's not a contradiction, it just shows you can't critically read. 

&gt;But at any rate, the entire episode of jews escaping slavery in Egypt has now been demonstrated by most historians to be a legend. Archeological evidence massively contradicts the exodus, therefore the quran. Just one point of data among many, 2M people (600K + the mix) as told by the torah was more than half of Egypt population at the time. It would have left archeological traces... somewhere.

Actually no sweetie. Some historians and archaeologists claim that the Exodus might have occurred, but their number would have been very small, not 2M people. So while the Bible says it's 2M people, the Qur'an says otherwise:

&gt;And We inspired to Moses, ""Travel by night with My servants; indeed, you will be pursued.""

&gt;Then Pharaoh sent among the cities gatherers

&gt;[And said], ""Indeed, those are but a **small band**.

So based on historians and archaeologists findings, if the Exodus did occur, the group would have been very small. That would explain the scarce historical remains of them. The Qur'an gets it right again.

But I'm done arguing with you. You need to go learn what a contradiction is, before trying to accuse things of being one. Disabling future replies since a 5 year old understands what a contradiction is, better then you.

6521,"&gt; If I was to read the verses you quoted before about the pharaoh ""We save thee in thy body"" in a novel, it would clearly contradict the drowning. Only when you infuse the text with a wider, interpreted, supposed meaning can you erase the contradiction.

No it does not, I can read the verse and that is far from the truth. Let me quote the verses and explain them:

&gt;**فَأَرَادَ أَنْ يَسْتَفِزَّهُمْ مِنَ الْأَرْضِ فَأَغْرَقْنَاهُ وَمَنْ مَعَهُ جَمِيعًا**

&gt;So he intended to drive them from the land, but We drowned him and those with him all together. (Sahih)

So God drowned him, and as he was drowning, he repented to God:

&gt;**وَجَاوَزْنَا بِبَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ الْبَحْرَ فَأَتْبَعَهُمْ فِرْعَوْنُ وَجُنُودُهُ بَغْيًا وَعَدْوًا ۖ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا أَدْرَكَهُ الْغَرَقُ قَالَ آمَنْتُ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا الَّذِي آمَنَتْ بِهِ بَنُو إِسْرَائِيلَ وَأَنَا مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ**

&gt;And We took the Children of Israel across the sea, and Pharaoh and his soldiers pursued them in tyranny and enmity until, when drowning overtook him, he said, *""I believe that there is no deity except that in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am of the Muslims.""* (Sahih)

But God did not accept his repentance, it was too late:

&gt;**آلْآنَ وَقَدْ عَصَيْتَ قَبْلُ وَكُنْتَ مِنَ الْمُفْسِدِينَ**

&gt; Now? And you had disobeyed before and were of the corrupters? (Sahih)

So God tells him, he will save him **in body**, that he may be a sign for the future:

&gt;**فَالْيَوْمَ نُنَجِّيكَ بِبَدَنِكَ لِتَكُونَ لِمَنْ خَلْفَكَ آيَةً ۚ وَإِنَّ كَثِيرًا مِنَ النَّاسِ عَنْ آيَاتِنَا لَغَافِلُونَ**

&gt;""This day shall We **save thee in the body**, that thou mayest be a sign to those who come after thee! but verily, many among mankind are heedless of Our Signs!"" (Yusuf Ali)

&gt;We will **save your body** on this day so that you may become evidence (of Our existence) for the coming generations; many people are unaware of such evidence."" (Muhammad Sarwar)

Let me cut down the first 3 Arabic words for and how it's read by a laymen:

**فَالْيَوْمَ**: Today

**نُنَجِّيكَ**: We will save you

**بِبَدَنِكَ**: in body

God did not accept his repentance, and the Pharaoh was drowned. He did not receive salvation because it was too late. God didn't say he saved the Pharaoh in regards to eternal salvation, but God said he would save the Pharaohs **body**, that he may be a sign for the future. 

See how there is no contradiction, or am I reconciling something that you see as a contradiction, when there is none?

&gt;Same goes with the angels (that is in contradiction to nature btw), it is easy to imagine X numbers of annunciations to erase the obvious contradiction but could you do the same in the context of a novel or would it feel contrived ?

As I explained with the Pharaoh verse, there is the same explanation for the angels verse. But your ignorance makes you think I'm reconciling contradictions, when there are none at all. But if you don't want to take the time to enlighten yourself before criticizing, then I can't help you.

6522,"&gt;We haven't moved from the fact that in order to not see the contradictions, you need to be a believer or at the very least want to become enlightened. Faith will make you blind to the contradictions itself proposes. Isn't that the definition of a circular proposition ?

There are no contradictions. The site you linked is ridiculous and takes nothing in context. Like the one verse speaking about angels telling Mary she's going to have a child named Jesus, and then another verse, at a different time period, an angel appearing to her in the form of a man. That is not a contradiction.

You have to read the verses before, and after it. You have to read the context in which the revelation was sent down as well. That's why the Qur'an is unlike the Bible. We have contexts for each verse. Just as we have context for the verses about *killing the infidels.* You read the verses before it and after it to see the whole picture. If that's not enough, you can go to the primary sources to see when the verses were sent down and under what circumstances. 

I read it before being a *believer* and critiqued it as much as I could. I'm not blind to anything whatsoever, I just took extensive time to research all the misconceptions. If you actually took the time to do your research, instead of going to a website like the one you linked, then you would understand. Anyone who does what you did, would say that we are using *rhetorical tools and tricks*, when we clearly are not.

6530,"&gt;Just google them, there are plenty, and all the common ones are fairly obvious when the contradictory verses are read in context. Any non muslim and quite a few muslims will recognise at least a few of the contradictions.

No, quote me a few examples. Also, you would need to read the context of that verse as well. The problem with non-Muslims is that they don't *really* delve into the Qur'an and try to become enlightened. They read it with a certain attitude, and therefore it only confirms their preconceived notions. If people spent as much time researching religion, which their salvation depends on, as they do other things, they would find the truth which I did, and that is without a shadow of a doubt Islam.

&gt;My point is not to point at any specific contradiction but to the symmetry in christian/muslim/jewish/... position. Each will dismiss the contradictions in their holy text pointed at by the others.

I've read all of the texts as an agnostic, and none compare to the Qur'an. The Qur'an, along with the hadith and primary sources, give us a complete picture of the religion of Islam, something that Christianity and Judaism does not. 

&gt;What makes your specific position valid when the others, remarkably similar, are not ? Furthermore, could your starting point (ie. believing) put you at risk of confirmation bias ?

As I said, I have read them all with as much non-bias a person can have. I critiqued everything I could about Islam before accepting the religion, and the more I critiqued and learned, the more conviction I had which left me with no choice but to accept the truth. I literally had no choice but to accept it.

6531,"&gt;Hmm, most Muslims I know believe that though. Does Islam teach differently?

Muslims who think that haven't read the Qur'an properly. The Qur'an says God created the universe in 6 periods. 2 of those periods, while he was also creating other things, he was creating the earth. Earth was created in 2/6th the amount of time the entire universe, or 1/3. If you look at the ""supposed"" timeline of the universe, it is 15 billion years old while the Earth is 5 billion years old. So the earth is 1/3 the age of the universe.

&gt;But something I really don't understand is how Muslims look at the Bible. I've always been told (and I've also read it again somewhere on this subreddit) that the Bible is really the word of God (according to Muslims), but the Quran replaced it. So what if the Quran and the Bible contradict each other? I'm asking this out of interest by the way, don't take it the wrong way :)

Jesus was given the Injeel(Gospel). It was oral revelation that he preached to others, just like Muhammad. The Bible is a recollection of some of the words Jesus spoke, which means some of the Bible is revelation that Jesus indeed spoke. Most of the Bible isn't the words of Jesus, but commentaries and writings of men, such as Paul.

The Qur'an is also revelation from God, as was the Injeel to Jesus. The difference is that the Qur'an is *verbatim* his word and doesn't contain commentary of men. Muhammad was sent with the Qur'an to correct the false doctrines that men placed into the teachings of Jesus. The Jews and Christians were given the responsibility of protecting their own scripture, but they failed.

So God sent the Qur'an as guidance to join the Jews, Christians and Muslims. Since Muhammad was the last Prophet, God took it upon himself to preserve the Qur'an, so that we have a book that we can rely on. 

As Muslims, we say whatever of the Bible that agrees with the Qur'an, we accept. And whatever isn't, was written by the hands of men. If we had the Injeel of Jesus, not the Injeel of anonymous authors named Matthew, Mark etc., we would find that everything in it agreed with the Qur'an. Unfortunately, we don't have the Injeel of Jesus.

6562,"1. If you have gotten the message of Islam and deny, your end would probably be bad.

2. It doesn't matter if you lead a ""good"" life while being a disbeliever. What you consider a ""good"" life doesn't matter to God, what does matter, above all things, is that you believe in him and worship him. That is what's good to Allah. All the extra good things you do *then* would benefit you. Good deeds without belief will benefit with nothing.

3. This is fornication and is prohibited in Islam. You can't have sexual intercourse unless your married. It doesn't matter if you're only having intercourse with one person. If that's the case, marry her and make it permissible. That's if you decide to become a Muslim.

4. Not to be rude, but this question is ridiculous. If you don't believe in God, and don't believe in sin, then why are you asking if it's considered a sin? What's a sin to a Muslim, is not a sin to a disbeliever. 

5. Don't know much about that.

As the previous poster said, if your a disbeliever and do all the good you can, it will avail you in nothing in the hereafter. A person who donates millions of dollars to feed the poor, while being a disbeliever, is literally nothing in the eyes of Allah. If you think about it, that person is only alive because of Allah. They only acquired that wealth because of Allah, and they fed the poor from the earth of Allah. The only reason they would be rewarded for it, is if they do it, knowing they are trying to please their Lord, and knowing that all provision is from him.

Yes it is. Most Muslims have a basic understanding of your religion. Almost every Muslim would know about the trinity and that Jesus died for your sins. Christians think Allah is a moon God lol...

&gt;Give me a single example of a greek triune god? And no christianity is not comparable to greek mythology, the majority of greek gods were not involved in creation, and their was no concept of oneness amongst them, it was pure polytheism.

Have a [read](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_deity#Triple_goddesses). And yes, Christianity is the product of Greek mythology. From the trinity, to Jesus' two natures, it's all a product of greek mythology while trying to fit it into the Jew's monotheism. Thus, the Father is God, the son is God, and the Holy spirit is God, but they're not three gods but one....

&gt;Based on that logic i can just as easily say that ""the OT promotes plural monotheism but your just examining it with your tawhid indocrated mind""

No you cannot. God says he is *one* all over the OT, and he never says trinity. Find me one verse that talks about the trinity, while I can quote you hundreds about how god is **one**, never three in one. So as I said, anything about the trinity, is you reading into the verses. I don't have to read **into** the verses like you, I just have to plainly read them.

&gt;And warn them, [O Muhammad], of the Day of Regret, when the matter will be concluded; and [yet], they are in [a state of] heedlessness, and they do not believe. [19:39]

Well 19:39 is speaking about the Day of Regret, and how it's only getting closer, yet most of us are heedless to Allah's signs. And when the matter is concluded i.e They see what they used to deny, they will be full of regret. 

&gt;Do they await except its result? The Day its result comes those who had ignored it before will say, ""The messengers of our Lord had come with the truth, so are there [now] any intercessors to intercede for us or could we be sent back to do other than we used to do?"" They will have lost themselves, and lost from them is what they used to invent. [7:53]

Most people are only waiting to see the result of it, and will believe when it's too late.

&gt;How can people not still believe that the day is here when these signs are made manifest?

No, people will definitely believe on that Day, but their belief will avail them in nothing.

&gt; If Jesus is literally coming with two angels in saffron dress then how can they disbelieve? 

When Jesus comes down on angels, I'm assuming it will be too late for anyone to believe in Islam. Their repentance won't count as they have seen the unseen (angels) world with their own eyes.

&gt;Wouldn't this mean that the day of judgement isn't physical? Like it is a day or period of time but that the events are not physical but spiritual?

Judgement Day is physical. What will occur first is doomsday, when the last people on earth witness the disintegrating of the universe right before they die. Then I'm guessing the universe will fall back on itself, and bang again. It might take billions of years, but we will be dead in another realm so we won't notice. Just like how we didn't notice it's creation for 15 billion years. This time, the universe will have all new set of laws unlike the one we have now, and with new bodies that are a similitude of the bodies we have now. The new creation will be mostly Jannah, as Allah says Jannah is the width of the entire current universe. And a little space in the corner of the universe for the people of Hell. 

&gt;The Day when We will fold the heaven like the folding of a [written] sheet for the records. As We began the first creation, We will repeat it. [That is] a promise binding upon Us. Indeed, We will do it. [21:104]

So yea, Judgement Day is physical, but it's in another creation with a whole new set of laws. It's not going to be the same way we think of physical now, but a similitude of it.

The word I put in bold begins with *fa*, which would mean immediately after another. So the wrapping of the bones with flesh occurs synonymous or almost *immediately* after. Microscopic research on embryos confirms that bones develop before muscle and flesh does. First, the cartilage tissue of the embryo ossifies. Then muscular cells that are selected from among the tissue around the  bones come together and wrap around the bones. In John Allan and Beverley Kramer's book, The Fundamentals of Human Embryology, 2nd Edition page 148, it says the following:

&gt;Soon **after the cartilaginous models of the bones have been established**, the myogenic cells, which have now become myoblasts, **aggregate to form muscle masses on the ventral and dorsal aspects of the limbs.**

&gt;&gt;**The muscles and tendons become attached to the bony structures** so that they can produce their actions across the joints.

He goes on to say:

&gt;Although precursor cells (myoblasts, or primitive muscle cells) are present adjacent to developing bone, **differentiation into skeletal muscle attachments occur after the ossification process** in the shaft and ends of the bones has begun.

God is not a man. That verse is clear while Jesus is a man. You can make all the justifications you want for your indoctrinated mind, but you really only sound like a fool to someone looking from the outside. God is clearly not a man, while Jesus is.

God's will and his essence are two different things. God cannot change his essence, or he would not be God. God is immortal, and Jesus wasn't. God cannot be both at the same time. God is all knowing, Jesus wasn't. God cannot be both at the same time. God is self sufficient, Jesus wasn't. God cannot be both at the same time. God is all powerful, Jesus wasn't.

God is saying he will judge by their individual actions, not their family.

More justification for your indoctrinated mind. Ezekiel says that no-one shall bear the sins of another. Jesus dying for your sins is direct contradiction to that.

What I would suggest is to convert as soon as possible. You can hide the fact that you are Muslim from your family and friends for as long as you need to, until you are stable enough to rely on yourself.

Lock your room and pray your daily prayers. Read the Qur'an by yourself in your room. During Ramadan, lie and say you ate, walk around the kitchen as if you're going to eat, but don't. Stop eating pork and find excuses why. If your dad makes pork and gets suspicious why you don't eat any, take some and act as if your going to eat it, but find a way to dispose of it in private.

It's really not hard to hide being a Muslim, especially if you're a male that doesn't need to wear the Hijab. Allah will reward you immensely for converting, despite the tribulations you have to endure for a little while. As I said, the fundamentals can all be done in secret.

I wasn't threatening you, I was quoting the Qur'an and what our beliefs are, which you were falsely portraying as if you will be fine as a Jew or Christian on Judgement Day in Islamic theology.

Just worshiping him will eventually grant you salvation, no matter how long you are punished in Hell for the horrible things you did.

On the other hand, an atheist can do all the good they can, and if they deny God with knowledge of Islam, then they will most likely go to Hell.

They live on his green earth, they breath his air, they drink his water and eat from his provision, and all the donations they give are all, in essence, from Gods possessions . 

At the end of the day, God doesn't care that they fed the poor, they fed the poor from his earth. In reality, God is the one who fed them, because the food came because of his sun, his water, and his earth. He does care that you are grateful and acknowledge him though. So when you are thankful, that food that you fed the poor with, which came from God's earth anyways, will be good deeds for you, as if you fed them yourself.

Well if they never received the message of Islam, then God judges them accordingly. However, if they obstinately deny or arrogantly overlook Islam and the Qur'an, then they will probably go to Hell. You see, God not only reveals a person's speech, but will also reveal what's in every persons heart. If you were ignorant and unaware, then it will be known. If you were arrogant to the thought of God, and made fun of the idea, and obstinately denied it without an open-mind, and even worse, mocked it, that will be apparent as well.

6641,"&gt;Keep on practising your mental gymnastics. It is not me but Moses who said why God is raising a prophet

Alright. That verse is past tense, and the verses following it say:

&gt;A prophet will the LORD thy God raise up unto thee, from the midst of thee, **of thy brethren, like unto me**; unto him ye shall hearken; Deuteronomy 18:15

&gt;I will raise them up a prophet from **among their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.** Deuteronomy 18:18

So now future tense, God will raise a Prophet from the brethren of Israelite's, who will put words in his mouth, and he will only speak what God commands him. This Prophet cannot be an Israelite because no Israelite can be like unto Moses:

&gt;And there hath **not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses**, whom the LORD knew face to face; Deuteronomy 34:10

Let me summarize again to make it simple for you:

1. God will raise a Prophet from the brethren of the Israelites.

2. This Prophet will be like Moses.

3. This Prophet cannot be an Israelite based on Deuteronomy 34:10.

Whose the Prophet?

&gt;You can act to be dumb but I am posting this for the benefit of anyone reading this.

I'm sorry, no-ones acting dumb but you. And yes, I already have gotten PMs of people watching this conversation, and your said attempt at gibberish. 

&gt;Try to practise what you preach.

Says the one who quoted the NIV, and answered none of my questions, so let me repeat them:

1. Who is *that* Prophet to come after the John the Baptist and the Messiah in John 1:19-21?

2. What Prophet is Deuteronomy 18:18 speaking about that will be like Moses from the Brethren of the Israelite's, when Deuteronomy 34:10 says no Israelite can be as great as Moses?

3. God promised to bless the nation of Ismael and make it great, which Prophet came to the previously Idol worshiping Arabs and called them back to the God of Abraham, which made the nation of Ismael blessed and great?

4. Who is John speaking about in this verse:

&gt;""But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but **whatever He hears, He will speak**; and He will disclose to you what is to come. John 16:13

Which sounds very similar to this verse:

&gt;I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee; and **I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.** Deuteronomy 18:18

Is John 16:13 speaking about the Holy Spirit, if so, who does God need authority from to speak? Who is telling God what to say?

I'm not doing any mental gymnastics, says the one who quoted me the NIV that contradicts the **original** Hebrew Scripture.

&gt;How does from among their brethren mean not an Israelite?

Whose Isaac, the father of the Israelite's, brother? Ismael.

&gt;A prophet will the LORD thy God raise up unto thee, from the midst of thee, **of thy brethren, like unto me**; unto him ye shall hearken; Deuteronomy 18:15

Did you read that, **brethren**.

&gt;&gt;I will raise them up a prophet from **among their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.** Deuteronomy 18:18

Did you read that again, **brethren**?

&gt;&gt;And there hath **not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses**, whom the LORD knew face to face; Deuteronomy 34:10

Did you read that as well, no Israelite can be like unto Moses?

&gt;I just quoted the verse where God says explicity that His covenant is with Isaac alone. Again, the level of mental gymnastics here is amazing. You are fooling yourself only by such gymnastics.

Then where is the great and blessed nation of Ismael God promised?

&gt;And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee; behold, **I have blessed him**, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and **I will make him a great nation.**

How about you answer that.

&gt;Laughter is not a rebuttal. Since you can't understand the why even after I explained it you with quotes, I realize that you do not posses the capability to understand anything explained to you and any further discussion with you is fruitless.

You refuted nothing, all you did was throw red herrings and quote the NIV that contradicts the original Hebrew Scripture, and you say I'm doing mental gymnastics. As God said, truth next to falsehood will always blow it away.

&gt;Rather, We dash the truth upon falsehood, and it destroys it, and thereupon it departs. And for you is destruction from that which you ascribe to him. [21:18]

&gt;No. God will raise up a prophet from among the Israelites's

&gt;&gt;A prophet will the LORD thy God raise up unto thee, from the midst of thee, **of thy brethren, like unto me**; unto him ye shall hearken; Deuteronomy 18:15

&gt;&gt;I will raise them up a prophet from **among their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.** Deuteronomy 18:18

&gt;&gt;And there hath **not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses**, whom the LORD knew face to face; Deuteronomy 34:10

Can't be an Israelite based on Deuteronomy 34:10, thus must come from their Brethren, as Deuteronomy 18:18 said. Learn how to read scripture before debating.

6644,"&gt;Then answer this simple question, why is God raising a prophet in Deuteronomy? No idea?

What the heck are you saying? God said he will raise a Prophet from the Brethren of the Israelite's, who are you to ask why? I don't understand what you're getting at.

&gt;That is the why? God is raising a prophet because he will come from the brethren of Isralite's? That is the why?

No, God is raising up a Prophet because he sends Prophets all the time?

&gt;A prophet will the LORD thy God raise up unto thee, from the midst of thee, **of thy brethren, like unto me;** unto him ye shall hearken; Deuteronomy 18:15

God will raise up a Prophet from the Brethren of the Israelite's, the Ismaelites. 

&gt;according to all that thou didst desire of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying: 'Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.' Deuteronomy 18:16

This is past tense. Next verses are *future* tense:

&gt;And the LORD said unto me: 'They have well said that which they have spoken. **I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.** Deuteronomy 18:17-18

&gt;&gt;So God that He will raise a prophet for the Israelites from among the Israelites and instead of talking directly, God will talk through the prophet. So Muhammad is never that prophet.

Wrong again. Can you not read scripture? This verse says the Prophet like unto Moses, who will be raised in the *future* tense, cannot be an Israelite:

&gt;And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face; Deuteronomy 34:10

Lets summarize:

1. God will raise up a Prophet from the **brethren** of the Israelite's.

2. This Prophet will be like unto Moses.

3. This Prophet cannot be an Israelite.

So whose the Prophet?

6645,"&gt;You don't understand trinity.

As if you do. And it doesn't matter, it's not real anyways.

&gt;New International Version

*LOLOLOL.* Why are you quoting the NIV? Why don't you quote the *original* Hebrew Scripture:

&gt;נָבִיא אָקִים לָהֶם מִקֶּרֶב אֲחֵיהֶם, כָּמוֹךָ; וְנָתַתִּי דְבָרַי, בְּפִיו, וְדִבֶּר אֲלֵיהֶם, אֵת כָּל-אֲשֶׁר אֲצַוֶּנּוּ.

&gt;I will raise them up a prophet from **among their brethren,** like unto thee; and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.

See how you're trying to evade the Prophesy. I wouldn't expect anything less from you. Let me quote you, again, the verse where no Israelite can be that Prophet:

&gt; וְלֹא-קָם נָבִיא עוֹד בְּיִשְׂרָאֵל, כְּמֹשֶׁה, אֲשֶׁר יְדָעוֹ יְהוָה, פָּנִים אֶל-פָּנִים.

&gt;And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face;

So your NIV is falsely translating Deuteronomy. The Prophet cannot be an Israelite. But I expect nothing less, as I said, from Christians skewing scripture to fit their ideology.

&gt;God's covenant is with Isaac only, not with Ismael.

Again, you are really bad at reading. God established a covenant with both. Let me quote you the Hebrew Scripture again:

&gt; וּלְיִשְׁמָעֵאל, שְׁמַעְתִּיךָ--הִנֵּה בֵּרַכְתִּי אֹתוֹ וְהִפְרֵיתִי אֹתוֹ וְהִרְבֵּיתִי אֹתוֹ, בִּמְאֹד מְאֹד:  שְׁנֵים-עָשָׂר נְשִׂיאִם יוֹלִיד, וּנְתַתִּיו לְגוֹי גָּדוֹל.

&gt;And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee; behold, **I have blessed him**, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and **I will make him a great nation.**

So again, the Prophet like unto Moses cannot be an Israelite, and God said he will make a great and blessed nation from Ismael.

&gt;You have not yet answered a simple question I asked, why is God raising a prophet in Deueronomy?

Because he said so in Deuteronomy 18:18 LOL?

Let me address all my points again since you evaded most of them like the coward that you are:

1. Who is *that* Prophet to come after the John the Baptist and the Messiah in John 1:19-21?

2. What Prophet is Deuteronomy 18:18 speaking about that will be like Moses from the Brethren of the Israelite's, when Deuteronomy 34:10 says no Israelite can be as great as Moses?

3. God promised to bless the nation of Ismael and make it great, which Prophet came to the previously Idol worshiping Arabs and called them back to the God of Abraham, which made the nation of Ismael blessed and great?

4. Who is John speaking about in this verse:

&gt;""But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but **whatever He hears, He will speak**; and He will disclose to you what is to come. John 16:13

&gt;I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee; and **I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.** Deuteronomy 18:18

Did I say God is not Yahweh? I said Christians make a differentiation between Jesus and Yahweh, which is why there is a trinity. Jesus and Yahweh are not the same being, and doing so is a Heresy recognized by 3rd century Christianity, and still to this day. It's you who doesn't understand your own doctrines.

&gt;Which is a blank statement.

It's not a blank statement, you don't know how to read scripture. Let me quote Deuteronomy 18:18 again:

&gt;I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him. Deuteronomy 18:18

God will raise a Prophet from among the Brethren of the Israelite's that will be **like Moses**. The Brethren of the Israelite's are the Ismaelites. Furthermore, in the following verse, God says that no Prophet from Israel will be like Moses, thus Jesus is not that Prophet:

&gt;And there hath **not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses,** whom the LORD knew face to face. Deuteronomy 34:10

So where is the Prophet like Moses, that isn't a Jew but from the brethren of Israelite's, the Ismaelites? This is not a blank statement, it is a statement from verses found in your Bible. So make your case and stop throwing out red herrings.

&gt;~~""For this is the one referred to by Isaiah the prophet, saying, 'The voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make ready the way of the Lord, make His paths straight!'' (Matt. 3:3)~~

&gt;~~""The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. 2As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, ""Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way; 3The voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make ready the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.'"" (Mark 1:1-3)~~

&gt;~~'This is the one about whom it is written, 'Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You,' (Matt. 11:10).~~

&gt;~~""He [John the Baptist] said, 'I am a voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way of the Lord.' as Isaiah the prophet said,'"" (John 1:23).~~

All nonsense. You are putting your spin into the words of the scripture. Isaiah 40 prophesies John the Baptist making clear the way of God. In no way is that speaking about Jesus. And your throwing more red herrings without refuting any of the points I raised,

&gt;~~There [c]came a man sent from God, whose name was John. 7 [d]He came [e]as a witness, to testify about the Light, so that all might believe through him. 8 [f]He was not the Light, but he came to testify about the Light.~~

&gt;~~9 There was the true Light [g]which, coming into the world, enlightens every man. 10 He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him. 11 He came to His [h]own, and those who were His own did not receive Him. 12 But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, even to those who believe in His name, 13 who were [i]born, not of [j]blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.~~

&gt;~~14 And the Word became flesh, and [k]dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of [l]the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth. 15 John testified about Him and cried out, saying,~~

&gt;~~“This was He of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me [m]has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me.’” 16 For of His fullness [n]we have all received, and [o]grace upon grace. 17 For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth [p]were realized through Jesus Christ. 18 No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten God who is in the bosom of the Father, He has explained Him.~~

More nonsense written by John. These verses are written after the fact that people made Jesus divine and trying to fit the OT with Jesus being God. And it's all red herrings which you are using to evade the points I raised. Why are you quoting me new verses without addressing my original points?

&gt;Again blank statement. In the previous verse John says

Why are you quoting me John. Did I not show you how the writers of the Bible were fixing the story? Let me quote the Gospels again so your brain can comprehend the developing story of Jesus:

&gt;In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. Mark 1:9

&gt;&gt;Jesus was simply baptized here. Showing that John the Baptist had superiority over Jesus by washing away his sins.

&gt; Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heavens were opened. Luke 3:21

&gt;&gt;Jesus again, simply being baptized. John the Baptist still being portrayed as superior for being the one who washed away Jesus' sins.

&gt;Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John. But John tried to deter him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?” Jesus replied, “Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness.” Then John consented. Matthew 3:13-15

&gt;&gt;But now as the image of Jesus was being exaggerated, they needed to fix the fact that John was superior to Jesus by baptizing him. In Matthew, John says Jesus should baptize him instead. Why? Because they don't want Jesus to seem inferior to John, so they fix the story.

You can continue to call my valid arguments blank statements, when I am quoting you evidence from your scripture that the story has been changing. Calling my points a blank statement is saying that Mark 1:9 and Luke 3:21 are exactly the identical story and recollection of Matthew 3:13-15. They are clearly different recollections, which is evidence of a developing story, making Jesus seem superior to John, when earlier Gospels say otherwise.

Let me quote the verses again, so that you may answer them for me instead of evading them:

&gt;**“After me comes the one more powerful than I,** the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie."" Mark 1:7

&gt;&gt;As you know, John the Baptist and Jesus were both on the scene the same time. They were both preaching at the same time. So who is the one whose greater then John the Baptist, that comes **after** him? After him meaning, once he leaves. This verse is not speaking about Jesus, as Jesus was the Messiah at the *same time* that John the Baptist was a prophet, Jesus did not come **after** John the Baptist left. He came during, and all historians know this as fact. John the Baptist is also greater then Jesus, in every sense of the word, since he was the one who washed away his sins, thus Jesus is not the one more powerful then John. Let's summarize:

&gt;1. Jesus did not come after John the Baptist, but appeared during the same period. Thus, the one who is to come after John the Baptist, cannot be Jesus.

&gt;2. Jesus' sins were washed away by John the Baptist, thus making John the Baptist superior, even though the Bible writers tried to fix the story. Thus, in order of inferiority to superiority it would be. Jesus&lt;John the Baptist&lt;The Prophet to come after John the Baptist.

&gt;&gt;And even if you don't agree with point **2**, as that could be a *subjective* view i.e that John was greater then Jesus, point **1** still applies since it is an *objective* truth. 

&gt;&gt;But let's quote what John the Baptist was asked again:

&gt;19 Now this was John’s testimony when the Jewish leaders[a] in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. 20 He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, “I am not the Messiah.”

&gt;21 They asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?”
He said, “I am not.”

&gt;**“Are you that Prophet?”**
He answered, “No.”

&gt;**“After me comes the one more powerful than I,**

&gt;&gt;*That* Prophet, who would come after the Messiah and John the Baptist, is the one greater then John the Baptist, Muhammad. 

So before throwing out red herrings, address all my points. 

1. Who is *that* Prophet to come after the John the Baptist and the Messiah in John 1:19-21?

2. What Prophet is Deuteronomy 18:18 speaking about that will be like Moses from the Brethren of the Israelite's, when Deuteronomy 34:10 says no Jew can be as great as Moses?

3. God promised to bless the nation of Ismael and make it great, which Prophet came to the previously Idol worshiping Arabs and called them back to the God of Abraham?

4. Who is John 16:13 speaking about in this verse:

&gt;""But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but **whatever He hears, He will speak**; and He will disclose to you what is to come. John 16:13

Which sounds very similar to this verse:

&gt;I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee; and **I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.** Deuteronomy 18:18

Is John 16:13 speaking about the Holy Spirit, if so, who does God need authority from to speak? Who is telling God what to say?

&gt;&gt;When Jesus came it was the Day of Judgement for the Jews, when Muhammad came it was that same day for the Christians. Those who accept the next prophet enter the gardens of spiritual rebirth and join closer to closer in the next life?

I don't understand your question, but judgement day is not spiritual only. Jesus did not come to Judge the Jews as God will, he came as a new Prophet to lead them back to the straight path, so that they can enter Paradise. They rejected him. Same thing with Christians, who rejected Muhammad. None of the Prophets coming was a judgement, but a warning from God for his final Judgement. 

Heaven and Hell are not spiritual, they are physical places. ",2015-12-15 01:46:07+00:00,cxzd8uq,3.0,t1_cxzcdsy,1301.0,islam

6654,"Well Judgement Day isn't on *this* exact earth, Dooms Day is though. Dooms Day is something we'll probably be dead for, which is when the universe goes into Chaos on the last people living.

I don't know if we're resurrected while the universe is disintegrating, or after, but Judgement Day will still have it's own kind of chaos, with you know, something called Hell. But the believers won't be to stressed out. And no Jannah and Jahannam are not on earth. 

&gt;And when the hell is kindled up [80:12]

&gt;And when the Garden is **brought near** [80:13]

&gt;And the garden shall be **brought near** to those who guard (against evil), not far off. [50:31]

So Jahannam is not on earth, it's somewhere very small that is kindled on Judgement Day. And Jannah is brought near to us, so I'm thinking Hell is going to be surrounding us, and then Allah will bring Jannah close to us before our eyes as excitement for the believers and torture for the disbelievers, and then we enter based on our rank. The disbelievers get left behind in Hell.

6655,"&gt;How is it a vague reference? The exact reference has been given.

It says nothing about Jesus being God. You are making it say what isn't there. And if you didn't know, calling Jesus Yahweh in Christendom is heresy, but I digress:

&gt;Then they said to him, “Who are you, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?” He said, **“I am a voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ as Isaiah the prophet said.”**

John the Baptist is a voice crying in the wilderness, a Prophet of God, making a straight path for people to follow to God. Then Isaiah 40 says:

&gt;A voice is calling, **“Clear the way for the LORD in the wilderness; Make smooth in the desert a highway for our God.**

John the Baptist is whose prophesied in Isaiah 40, making clear the way for God. How does this have anything to do with Jesus? Jesus was just another Prophet who was making a straight path to God. Isaiah 40 was a prophesy of John the Baptist, nothing about Jesus being Yahweh. You guys exaggerate verses like the writers of the Bible did. For example:

&gt;In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. Mark 1:9

Jesus was simply baptized here. Showing that John the Baptist had superiority over Jesus by washing away his sins.

&gt; Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heavens were opened. Luke 3:21

Jesus again, simply being baptized. John the Baptist still being portrayed as superior for being the one who washed away Jesus' sins.

&gt;Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John. But John tried to deter him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?” Jesus replied, “Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness.” Then John consented. Matthew 3:13-15

But now as the image of Jesus was being exaggerated, they needed to fix the fact that John was superior to Jesus by baptizing him. In Matthew, John says Jesus should baptize him instead. Why? Because they don't want Jesus to seem inferior to John, so they fix the story. Just as God says in the Qur'an:

&gt;O People of the Scripture! **Do not exaggerate** in your religion nor utter aught concerning Allah save the truth. [4:171]

And a continuation of that topic is this verse from John the Baptist:

&gt;**“After me comes the one more powerful than I,** the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie."" Mark 1:7

As you know, John the Baptist and Jesus were both on the scene the same time. They were both preaching at the same time. So who is the one whose greater then John the Baptist, that comes **after** him? After him meaning, once he leaves. This verse is not speaking about Jesus, as Jesus was the Messiah at the *same time* that John the Baptist was a prophet, Jesus did not come **after** John the Baptist left. He came during, and all historians know this as fact. John the Baptist is also greater then Jesus, in every sense of the word, since he was the one who washed away his sins, thus Jesus is not the one more powerful then John. Let's summarize:

1. Jesus did not come after John the Baptist, but appeared during the same period. Thus, the one who is to come after John the Baptist, cannot be Jesus.

2. Jesus' sins were washed away by John the Baptist, thus making John the Baptist superior, even though the Bible writers tried to fix the story. Thus, in order of inferiority to superiority it would be. Jesus&lt;John the Baptist&lt;The Prophet to come after John the Baptist.

And even if you don't agree with point **2**, as that could be a *subjective* view i.e that John was greater then Jesus, point **1** still applies since it is an *objective* truth. 

But let's quote what John the Baptist was asked again:

&gt;19 Now this was John’s testimony when the Jewish leaders[a] in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. 20 He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, “I am not the Messiah.”

&gt;21 They asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?”
He said, “I am not.”

&gt;**“Are you that Prophet?”**
He answered, “No.”

&gt;&gt;**“After me comes the one more powerful than I,**

*That* Prophet, who would come after the Messiah and John the Baptist, is the one greater then John the Baptist, Muhammad. 

&gt;Explain to my why God is raising a prophet in Deuteronomy 18:18.

How about you read my entire response again. I explained it quite well. And as I said, if your going to oppose my argument, deconstruct all the points I gave. Throwing red herrings and vague verses does nothing to the points I raised, which are clear indicators of the coming of Muhammad in your own scripture.

Usually, yes.

She can wear it before if it makes her comfortable around her peers and not seem like the odd one out, or she can wait until her period. It's really her personal choice. 

&gt;What if she has a medical problem and is not able to get her period? At what point is she required to wear it?

Hmm, I'm not sure about this. My obvious opinion would be that once her body starts developing secondary female characteristics, she should start wearing it.

&gt;What if someone questions her about why she's not wearing it?

It's not really a big deal. Many Muslim girls, especially in the US, start wearing it at different times. No-one really cares unless you are obviously developing physically. If you look like a child, no-ones going to ask. 

And still, she can decide not to wear it. It is mandatory in Islam, but some women chose not to, and that's their prerogative.

I see nothing about him being God, dying for your sins, the Trinity etc. I see you trying to make it say what you want it to say.

On the other hand we have clear verses such as from John 1:

&gt;19 Now this was John’s testimony when the Jewish leaders[a] in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. 20 He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, “I am not the Messiah.”

&gt;21 They asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?”

&gt;He said, “I am not.”

&gt;**“Are you that Prophet?”**

&gt;He answered, “No.”

Did you get that? *Are you the Messiah?* No. *Are you Elijah?* No. *Are you that Prophet?* **No**. Whose that Prophet, a prophet that came after the Messiah? Muhammad. Lets continue:

&gt;I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him. Deuteronomy 18:18

This is not speaking about Jesus because he is not a descendant of the brethren of the Israelite's, and because he is an Israelite himself. God says in the following verse:

&gt;And there hath **not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses**, whom the LORD knew face to face. Deuteronomy 34:10

That no Prophet from Israel can be like Moses, so this Prophet can't be Jesus and must come from the brother of Isaac, Ismael.

So, God will raise up a Prophet, from among the brethren of the Israelite's, the Ismaelite's. Which Prophet descended from Ismael? Muhammad. Which Prophet revealed revelation that is the *verbatim* word of God, that has stayed the same ever since? Muhammad. Which Prophet was the *most* like Moses? Muhammad. James L. Dow states in his Collins Gem Dictionary of the Bible states under ""Moses"":

&gt;The only man in history who can be compared even remotely to him is Muhammad.

But just like God said about the Jews, that you wouldn't want to hear the voice of God, and that most of you would reject him.

&gt;according to all that thou didst desire of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying: **'Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God**, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.' Deuteronomy 18:16

And just like Isaac was blessed, so was Ismael:

&gt;And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee; behold, **I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly**; twelve princes shall he beget, and **I will make him a great nation.** Genesis 17:20

What blessed great nation is made up of the descendants of Ismael? The Arab and Muslims. They were idol worshipers until the appearance of Prophet Muhammad who called them back to the one God of the Children of Israel. Let me quote Deuteronomy 18:18 again:

&gt;and **I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.**

And now let me quote what Jesus said which is almost exactly the same:

&gt;""But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for **He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears, He will speak;** and He will disclose to you what is to come. John 16:13

First, this verse and the one that follows it have the most male pronouns in any verse of the Bible, not befitting of anything other then a man. Secondly, spirit in the Bible is used synonymous with Prophet, but you Christians still say it is the Holy spirit. There are various issues with this. First of all, the Holy spirit was there before Jesus, so why must he leave for it to come? This Holy spirit, according to you, is God. Why can't God speak on his own authority? Does God need authority? Also, who is telling God what to say...? 

Because he is not talking about the Holy spirit, which is archangel Gabriel, he is talking about *that* Prophet that John the Baptist was asked about. He was talking about *that* Prophet that would be raised from the brethren of the Israelite's, the Ismaelites. He is talking about *that* Prophet which will be just like Moses. He is talking about *that* Prophet who will make the nation of Ismael great.

That Prophet is Muhammad.

6678,"&gt;Quite simply the answer is whatever God wills it to be. If God wanted to be man and then be killed, he wld be.

God's will and his essence are two different things. He can will something, but he cannot change his essence or he would not be God. An essential of God is that he's immortal, thus he cannot will himself to die. An essential of God is that he is all knowing, thus Jesus not knowing the hour is proof he's not God. God cannot be immortal and mortal at the same time, God cannot be knowing and unknowing at the same time. These things would make him not God. These are only a few examples with the problem of saying God became Jesus.

&gt;If god wanted the death of one man to absolve sins, then it would.

Yes he could, but he continually says in the OT that no soul shall bear the burden of another, atonement directly contradicts this. The OT says God is not a man, Jesus being God directly contradicts this. 

&gt;Also people who believe in his death have no less certainty then those who believe he didn't die.

Actually yes, the NT is riddled with clues that he did not die, as well as early Christians not believing he died. This only supports the claim of the Qur'an that he did not die. There is more certainty he did not die, then there is that he did. The earliest manuscripts of the NT are more then a century after he left, thus allowing the exaggeration of his status to accumulate, as well as 94% of all manuscripts being dated to at least 9th century. 

Anyone that reads the history of this religion would know the Christianity had roots in Greek and Roman Paganism and they fit Jesus into that image.

Your destiny is set in stone because Allah could see everything. Allah could see all the choices you made in life and wrote it down before you existed. This doesn't mean that he chose anything for you, he simply saw your choices and wrote it down. If you are a non-Muslim and become a Muslim, you didn't change anything in your destiny. Your destiny was written down, so Allah already knew you would've became a Muslim.

You can't change your destiny since all the things you *think* will change your destiny, don't because all those changes were known before hand. 

It's not like Allah said, *""He will buy a Toyota instead of a Nissan""*. It's more like, you chose a Toyota instead of a Nissan, and because Allah could already see that, he wrote it down. It was your destiny to buy a Toyota. But what if you think you can change your destiny because you end up choosing the Nissan? Nope, because Allah already knew that you would choose it. It's all your choices, Allah just knows them before hand and that becomes part of your destiny.

If at this moment someone becomes a Muslim, he might think he changed his destiny, when he really did not. Allah knew that before hand and wrote it down, which is essentially what destiny is. Destiny is something known to Allah before hand, but it is your actions that determined that Destiny. 

The issue your having is with the nature of Allah. It was experienced already to Allah, but not to you. But Allah experienced it because he is not living under time. We are, so what we are experiencing in a forward motion, has already occurred to someone who is not governed by time. Allah experienced it already because he is not governed by time, you haven't experienced it because you are governed by time that is leading you in a forward direction. Still, all the things Allah experienced from you were on your own accord, he chose nothing for you. He just experienced it before hand because he is not governed by time.

6685,"&gt;But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. And Allah Knows, while you know not. [2:216]",2015-12-11 06:17:23+00:00,cxv340b,1.0,t3_3wbz9c,4935.0,islam
6686,"&gt; if that's the case, then our existence is still basically predetermined, since if I was destined to go to heaven, I would be pushed towards more virtuous tasks, rather than sin, and would be unable to make a true choice in that regard.

Don't think like that. Don't think that because you were destined for heaven you will do good deeds. Think of it the other way around. Because you did good deeds, and Allah saw this before your existence, it was destined for you to go to heaven.

Let me explain it in another example. You were destined to go to heaven because of the actions you did on earth that Allah could already see. You weren't destined for it because Allah chose it for you. You chose it for yourself, and since Allah could see all of this before you existed, it was already written on the Lawh al Mahfuz.

Another example. Your destiny was already written down for heaven or hell. But your destiny wasn't chosen for you by Allah, you chose your destiny for yourself. Allah just wrote it down before you existed because he sees everything all at once.

Did these help? The mysteries of predestination are only known to Allah, we can only try to make sense of them in our own limited way.",2015-12-11 05:27:54+00:00,cxv1uzg,5.0,t1_cxv18fw,1317.0,islam
6687,"Your issue regarding predestination I've explained already so I'll just copy it here:

&gt;Allah knows everything that has happened, *is* happening, and will happen. We are living in a universe that has *time* and are governed by it. Allah is not governed by time. He can see everything all at once. So when he knows where you go, it isn't because he chose it for you, it is because you chose it for yourself but he already could see what you chose and wrote it on the Lawh al Mahfuz. We see that the universe is 15 billion years old, Allah sees it as he just made it a second ago, or even less because to him, what is time? Allah is infinite, what is 15 billion years compared to infinite? It is *zero*.

&gt;Also, Allah already knows Judgement day. To him, it has already happened. As I said, this world is only a test for us, so Judgement day isn't for Allah to know who goes where, but it is for us. So when we go to heaven or hell, you understand why. Allah could've just placed everyone where he *knew* they would go, without giving us the test. But that would be unfair to his creation, we'd argue that had he given us the chance, we would have believed and done better. So Allah, being the most just, has placed us in this test so that we will witness against ourselves. We can't blame Allah and say, *""Well, had you let us on earth, we would have believed.""* He gave you that chance, so there is no excuses on that day. And as I said, even though he knows where each person is going, Judgement day will be for you to know why you're there.

&gt;Finally, Allah is *thee* infinite. Okay, say you go to heaven. We stay there for infinity correct? So we are going to be in heaven living in a *potential infinite*. Time will never end there so all our actions are going toward an infinite, but we are not *thee* infinite. The days will never end, so we are moving towards an infinity but we will never **become** the absolute infinity. Think about it like this, if you had never ending days, and you picked out one apple from a tree everyday. You'd have 1 apple the first day, 2 the second, etc. You will always be picking an apple as the days never end, so you will be working toward an infinity number of apples, but never actually reach it because the next day, you'll add one more. This goes on forever. On the other hand, Allah is the absolute infinite, he doesn't work towards an infinity like we will in heaven or hell, he **is** the infinity.

6691,"&gt;It very clearly says he gave her the bread and the water on her shoulder, and the boy and she he sent. See the difference between the truth and what you said?

You're still quoting the same verse which says he put him on her shoulder lol. Let's quote a commentary: 

&gt;&gt;and the child: (Gen. Rabbah 53:13) He also placed the child on her shoulder, because Sarah had cast an evil eye upon him, and he was seized by a fever so that he could not walk on his feet.

See whose lying? I'm quoting a commentary on your own scripture, not making up a fake scenario. 


&gt;No, Abraham placed the bread and water on her shoulder, she put her weak son under the shrub to protect him from the sun. Then she gave him water because he was too weak to drink himself.

*Applause*. Great fake scenario you made up for the fact that he was a baby. Just like how your Rabbi's say Ismael had a fever, and that is why he was placed on her shoulder. What a sad attempt at some bull-crap. But let me give you a ovation for your attempt. *Clap Clap*.

&gt;No, no darling. Scripture says one thing and you are saying something else. You are making things up to satisfy your argument. You don't know enough about this topic to talk about it. Do you know hebrew grammar? Hebrew language? You are using the poor translations you find on the internet.

Oh, so you have to speak Hebrew to become a Jew? Didn't know that.

&gt; Scripture says one thing and you are saying something else.

Let me quote you the exegesis again:

&gt;In the Rabbinic exegesis, Abraham put the child on Hagar’s shoulder. According to the calculation by the Rabbis, Ishmael was twenty-seven years old at the time, so then why did Abraham place him on Hagar’s shoulder? **Rather, Sarah had put an evil eye on Ishmael, thus inflicting him with a fever and illness.**

See, even your Rabbi's suck at making up excuses. I'm telling you, your scribes should've removed that story all together.

&gt;So you won't even address where you lied and said it would be a ""blessed nation?"" I guess that is how your kind operate. Just move from lie to the next and ignore all the evidence to the contrary. 

Great nation, blessed nation, not really different. Why don't you address what great nation did Ismael have? Is Pagan Idol worshipers a great nation to God? Is that what he promised Ismael? That his nation will be Idol worshipers, or that they would number the amount of stars in the sky and be a *great* nation? Muhammad was the one who made Ismael's nation great by making them worship the **one** true God. I think that fit's the description more then the crap you're saying. But I understand if it's hard to accept, you Jews are racist so it's fine. On the other hand, we Muslims accept you Jews, accept Christians, and accept all your Prophets, from Noah to Jesus. We are that great nation that number the amount of stars in the sky. While you stay at your standstill not growing at all. 

&gt;Why not? Not in the mood to discuss the evils mohamed brought to the world? The rape and murderof millions? That is wicked.

Let's discuss then. I'm sure I've read countless times in your scripture of Prophets engaging in war. Or does that not matter because they're Jews. The second it's an Arab from Ismael that's doing the war, your racism comes out. Hide it a little better. And why you don't you quote me the *millions* he has killed? Or are you making stuff up like your scribes did? You would've been perfect back then to make all the nice changes you wanted to make Ismael look bad. 

&gt;Based on what do you make this claim? Jewish scholars were aware of the practices of the pagans continuously. The talmud and midrash, which predates islam by centuries, talk about the many different pagan practices and false gods being worshiped. I think it is pretty easy to accept this wasn't some mysterious lost information. You are basically saying that he not only stole from the Torah but also the Talmud. Ok, I will give you that one.

Then quote me one passage from Talmud about the God's Abraham's nation worshiped. I would like a quote please. Not your racist, immature commentary. Bring your facts please.

&gt;No the koran is full of the lies perpetuated by power hungry conquerors who used a false religion to dominate their world. Fortunately for them G-d is merciful and forgiving. And how can you claim the prophets are false based on a line from those very prophets? You don't understand logic, do you?

You're throwing out so much red herrings to get off topic. I can claim they're false because your book was written scribes, not Moses. Just like how his funeral is written in your book, did Moses write about his funeral while he was dead? Our book is direct revelation from God. We know who compiled it, who gave it to us, we have direct sources leading up to the life of Muhammad. You on the other hand, have a book you don't know who wrote. Just like your own scripture says:

&gt;‘How can you say, “We are wise, for we have the law of the LORD,” **when actually the lying pen of the scribes has handled it falsely.'**

But let's continue:

&gt;I will raise them up a prophet from **among their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put My words in his mouth**, and **he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.**And it shall come to pass, that **whosoever will not hearken unto My words which he shall speak in My name, I will require it of him.**

Where is the Prophet that was raised from the brethren of the Israelite's, the Ismaelite's? Who was a Prophet and Statesmen like Moses was from the Ismaelites? Who forced emigration to Medina like Moses did to Median? Who brought down a new Law like the Laws Moses was given? Where is this Prophet your scripture speaks about? Isn't God telling you to follow him, that he will *require* it from you? Hmmm, seems like another requirement you Jews don't care about. 

&gt;Abraham was commanded to sacrifice the only son of his wife, Isaac, not the son of his servant, Ishmael

Oh really, not his wife? *Sigh*, let's quote your scripture again:

&gt;And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, **and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife.**

Your own scripture says she was his wife. Get your crap together, your all over the place. He was a legitimate son like your scripture continuously says. All throughout your scripture Ismael is referred to as *Son*. So when God says, 

&gt;And He said: 'Take now thy son, **thine only son**, whom thou lovest,

Why would he be referring to Isaac? The *only* son was Ismael for a long time before Isaac was. Why would God use the term son for Ismael all throughout your scripture, and then here even say thy *only* son, but you Jews think it's Isaac? How does that make sense, when was Isaac the only son? Why would God say *only* son? Why didn't he say *favorite* son if Isaac was even his favorite? Why all the confusion? Because your scribes changed the story, and they forgot to change that part. Just like the Jews who acknowledge the fact that Ismael was the sacrifice and became Muslim. From Encyclopaedia Judaica: 

&gt;&gt;""It is related that a renowned traditionalist of Jewish origin, from Qurayza tribe and another Jewish scholar who converted to Islam, told Caliph Omar ibn Abd al-Aziz (717-20) **that the Jews were well informed that Ismail (Ishmael) was the one who was bound (sacrificed), but they concealed this out of jealousy.**

And some more, Encyclopaedia Judaica, Volume 9, Encyclopaedia Judaica Jerusalem, pp. 82 says the following:

&gt;Another proof of our speech is reported by Ibn Ishaaq: ""Muhammad Ibn Ka'b narrated that 'Umar Ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz sent for a man who had been a Jew then converted to Islam and showed signs of true Islam. (Before his conversion), he was one of their scholars (He was a Jewish Scholar). So he (Umar) asked him: **which son did Abraham sacrifice? He replied: 'It is Ishmael. By God, O Commander of the Believers, the Jews know that but they envy you - the Arabs.'**

Seems like your own Jewish scholars knew who was the real sacrifice, and knew that you were just jealous. As obvious by the sad attempt of the Jewish scribes to bash Ismael all over your scripture. They couldn't even hide, it was plain obvious. Find me *one* Muslim scholar whose converted to Judaism, and I'll find you 10 Jewish ones who converted to Islam. 

&gt;I pity you more than I did previously. May G-d have mercy on you.

God will definitely have Mercy on me. I follow all his Prophet's and not reject them like you Jews do. I accept Jesus and Muhammad, and will gladly tell God why. When you get asked the same thing, good luck. God can go right into your heart and see your blatant racism and hate, you can hide it from me, but not God. Anyways, God will inform us about what we used to differ about, maybe he'll let the scribes go to Hell for you and forgive you for your racism, hate and ignorance:

&gt;And We have revealed to you, [O Muúammad], the Book in truth, confirming that which preceded it of the Scripture and as a criterion over it. So judge between them by what Allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations away from what has come to you of the truth. To each of you We prescribed a law and a method. Had Allah willed, He would have made you one nation [united in religion], but [He intended] to test you in what He has given you; so race to [all that is] good. To Allah is your return all together, and He will [then] inform you concerning that over which you used to differ. (5:48)

6692,"&gt;o, he put the bread and water on her shoulder. How about your quote it in the original language and dissect the word to prove your side. If you can't read and understand the original language, then what are you even doing here?

Lets see what the translation says:

&gt;And Abraham arose up early in the morning, and **took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child**, and sent her away; and she departed, and strayed in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.

He took the bread, bottle of water on her shoulder, **and the child**. Your text says he put Ismael on her shoulder...

&gt;Did you not read anything I wrote but what you wanted? He was likely tired because he deferred to his mother when it came to using the water. There are literally a million reasons why he could have been more worn out than his mother. You refuse to accept anything but your lies.

&gt;&gt;And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.

She placed the child on her shoulder, then placed him under a shrub. Then she gave him water to drink:

&gt;And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.

So the seventeen year old was carried on his mothers shoulder, she placed him under a shrub, and she also then physically gave him water. Sounds like everything you would do with a baby in the given situation, not a seventeen year old...

&gt;Nowhere does it say ""blessed nations"" about ishmael.

&gt;&gt;Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him fast by thy hand; for I will make him a **great nation.'**

He will make the descendants of Ismael a*great* nation. Is pagan Idol worshipers a great nation to God? 

&gt; All the conquest, raping, murdering, pillaging and more was truly wicked.

Don't even start with *truly* wicked. I could quote mine you your own scripture but I won't since I want to stay on topic.

&gt;Keep making up the lies and I will keep swatting them down.

Your doing a horrible job. Your scripture says one thing, and you're saying another...

&gt;So he knew some of the local pagan history because he was a pagan. Does that prove he had some special knowledge? No. He took Judaism, added in his own flair, modified it to suit his needs to be a leader and conqueror and then made up a story about an angel telling him what to write. ""Hey everybody, G-d wants me to be in charge and conquer and murder and do whatever I want. An angel told me so."" Totally credible, right?

There was no information from ancient Egyptian civilization during Muhammad's time. We only revived it with the hieroglyphics we found and translated the text with the Rosetta stone. All recent things. None of these things are mentioned in the OT, so how did Muhammad copy it from your scripture? Where in your scripture does it talk about Egyptian civilization and the main Gods they worshiped, the Sun, Moon and Planet Gods? Nowhere. 

&gt;You quoted from Jeremiah, one of the prophets. There aren't any prophets in the koran. Why would I bring up that false document?

There are plenty of Prophets in the Qur'an, difference is the're all correct accounts, not the false ones your scribes have changed.

&gt;Your pathetic lies can not hold up to the scrutiny of someone who knows the truth. I now see how you get so twisted if this is the pack of lies they drill into your head as a boy in a madrasa. Your ilk are a terrifying blight on the world. Please try to get some real education. You desperately need it.

I'm a female and am a convert to Islam and have read the OT and NT and they are what made me Muslim. Your scribes should have fixed that mistake. They also should have removed the verse about God raising up a Prophet from the brother of the descendants of Isaac. They should have also fixed the mistake where God tells Abraham to sacrifice his *only* son, which would have been Ismael for fourteen years before Isaac.

He put the boy on her shoulder, your petty attempt at twisting the words isn't going to work. 

&gt;She placed him under a bush for shade because he was weak from the journey and lack of water.

Lol, another sad attempt at trying to make your scripture work. Why would a 17 year old be tired but not his mother? 17 year olds have more stamina then their mothers. So it should be the other way around, unless Ismael was a baby. As obvious by Abraham putting him on Hagars shoulder and Hagar placing him under the bush.

&gt;There are plenty of Ishmalites. They existed for thousands of years before mohamed was born. Not sure what you are trying to prove here.

They existed as Pagan Idol worshipers. Is a blessed nation to God Pagan Idol worshipers? Or was it when Muhammad came and called them back to the one God?

&gt;Yes and yes. See above where he was weak from lack of water and needed assistance from his mother.

Why would he be tired but not his mother? He is a seventeen year old. He should be caring for his older mother. Unless he was a baby of course and couldn't drink himself.

&gt;Mohamed must have gotten a copy of a torah and modified it to make it seem like he had some new iteration of G-d's word.

Oh yea, Muhammad defintely copied the Torah. Where in the Torah does it say what Idols Abraham's nation worshiped? It says they worshiped many Gods, while the Qur'an says the worshiped the Sun, Moon and Planet Gods. A recent excavation of the land Abraham lived on shows what God's they worshiped [here](http://www.manyprophetsonemessage.com/2014/10/14/quran-reveals-lost-knowledge-about-prophet-abraham/). Where did Muhammad copy that from huh?

&gt;You are hilarious. You are trying to prove that the book is corrupted because one of the prophets pointed out that there was corruption that he was dealing with. Which one is it?

I didn't even bring up the Qur'an. I quoted you the Bible which shows the corruption. Your scribes should have fixed that mistake for you ;). Just like they forgot to change the ""sacrifice"" as *not* being the only son. Which would have been Ismael, as he was the only son for 14 years before Isaac. 

Your sad attempt at defending your scriptures fails.

6694,"&gt;It was Isaac, not Ishmael. It is obvious from the fact that is says Isaac. Their relative ages have nothing to do with it.

The relative ages do have to do with something. It shows that your book is corrupted. 

&gt;Genesis 16:3, “So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took her Egyptian maidservant Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife.

So Sarah gave Hajer to be Abrahams wife. The next verses are from Genesis 21: 14-21. 

&gt;Early next morning Abraham took some food and a full water-skin and gave them to Hagar. He set the child on her shoulder and sent her away, and she wandered about in the wilderness of Beersheba.

He put the child on her shoulder. Abraham was 86 when Ismael was born and 100 when Isaac was. That would mean Ismael was 14 years old when Isaac was born and this happened after Isaac was weaned, which would make Ismael 16 or 17. Did Abraham put a 17 year old on Hagars shoulder?

&gt;When the water in the skin was finished, she thrust the child under a bush

She thrusted a 17 year old man into a bush? Why couldn't he walk himself to the bush if he was 17?

&gt;then went and sat down some way off, about a bowshot distant. How can I watch the child die? she said, and sat there, weeping bitterly.

She couldn't stand seeing her 17 year old sun die? Why is the mother worrying about a 17 year old man who should be worrying about her?

&gt;God heard the child crying

So the 17 year old man was crying?

&gt;Go, lift the child and hold him in your arms

She is going to hold a 17 year old child in her arms? 

&gt;because I shall make of him a great nation.

Where is the great nation of Ismael that God promised? The only Prophet from Ismael was Muhammad, who called to the worship of Allah. No other person made Ismael's nation great, with an 2 billion and counting members. So I ask you, where is the great nation of Ismael that God promised?

&gt;Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well full of water; she went to it, filled the water-skin, and gave the child a drink.

So Hagar gave a 17 year old a drink? He couldn't drink for himself?

&gt;God was with the child as he grew up.

But wasn't he already a grown up based on the OT? Obviously Ismael was a baby so your story doesn't add up honey. We're not stupid to not be able to do some easy math. Your book is obviously corrupted by the descendants of Isaac who wrote the book with their own hands and made Ismael look bad. 

Just like your book says:

&gt;‘How can you say, “We are wise, for we have the law of the LORD,” when actually the lying pen of the scribes has handled it falsely.' Jeremiah 8:8

It's obvious the Jewish scribes were Ismael haters, just like you Jews are today.

&gt;And if you are trying to figure out whose side G-d is on, just look at the tiny sliver of land that has managed to thrive and stave off countless attacks when outnumbered more than 200 to 1 by enemies.

Oh, if your going to get nasty, seems like God was on your side when he let Hitler almost exterminate ya'll huh? You owning that land for what is a day in history doesn't mean shit. Muslims owned that land for far longer then what you have, which is less than one hundred years after that. It will go back to it's rightful owners when Jesus comes back and kills you and your false Messiah. And when you realize he was a true Prophet, you'll be just like the Pharaoh who made repentance as he was drowning following Moses. Didn't help him one bit, and his abode is now Hell.

I already discussed this. All the verses in the Qur'an were written and supervised by the Prophet and had 2 witnesses. Every verse in the compiled Qur'an was written in the company of the Prophet and had 2 witnesses. Do I need to repeat?

&gt;Nope I am telling you they could have made another one, but we just don't know about it.

The Bible, which was written, has a bunch of versions popping up all the time. The Qur'an which was memorized doesn't. 1400 years and not one different Qur'an. Hmmm...

&gt;Having one version only proves that people were careful with preserving it. It is not proof of divinity.

We were talking about it's preservation, not about it's divinity. As I said, all the verses that were compiled were written in the company of the Prophet and had two witnesses. This is other then the thousands who memorized it verbatim. 

&gt;Why would they lie as to time needed to memorise the Quran?

They're not, as I said, if you memorize 20 verses a day, you would memorize the entire Qur'an in less than a year. Arabs memorized poetry as a hobby and memorized the Qur'an even quicker then we can today.

&gt;lastly I get the eerie feeling you're not used to people having an opinion opposite yours on this.

Actually no. I love debates but you're arguing something which is baseless and has been continuously refuted, the authenticity of the Qur'an.

I am not one bit insecure with my beliefs. You use a passive aggressive tone all throughout your replies and then want to call me insecure for debating your nonsensical issue of the Qur'an's authenticity. 

&gt;Hostility when nudged logically on ones beliefs is not particularly charming. 

Your arguments are illogical. Qur'an has thousands of primary sources to back it up, was transmitted through mass memorization as well as written down with the supervision of the Prophet. If you deny the authenticity of the Qur'an using your logic, we would deny the majority of things in the history books which have much less primary sources then the Qur'an.

As I also said, based on your assertion it must only be a coincidence that Muhammad wrote the book and said that a fake God will preserve it and made it easy to remember, while we only have one version of the Qur'an for 1400 years. All it would have taken is one other version to invalidate the whole religion. 

&gt;Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur'an and indeed, We will be its guardian. (15:9)

&gt;And We have certainly made the Qur'an easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember? (54:17)

Just like God asks you to write a book like it if you are in doubt about it. Why didn't the *best* poets during Muhammad's time write a book like it and invalidate the whole religion? Why hasn't anyone written a book like it for the last 1400 years so they can invalidate the Qur'an and Islam?

6702,"&gt;As far as I have been able to read it does still take quite a while to memorize the Quran.

The Qur'an was revelation 1400 years ago. Arabs were famous for reciting poetry and memorizing it quickly, which is why God sent it down in the *best* poetry even the masters of the Arabic language couldn't rival, as well as it being very easy to memorize. 

Your attacks are pathetic. You googled a link and probably didn't even read it. If you memorize 20 verses a day, you would memorize the entire Qur'an in *less* then a year. Again, try better.

&gt;Or there were disagreements as to what made up the Quran but they were not written down or dissidents were silenced. I am sorry but this is not proof of anything.

You are the one who brought up the fact of them forgetting details. For them to all agree on the Qur'an, while forgetting details, that would mean they all forgot the *same* details, which is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. It's a new low, so at least I applaud you for that. 

No-one was in disagreement about what made up the Qur'an. The Prophet told them how many chapters there were, how many verses in each chapter, and the order in which the verses go in each chapter before he died. There was **no** disagreement about what was in the Qur'an. 

&gt;Also how are you 100% certain that there were not people who thought of different versions of the Quran? How can you possibly know?

Where the fuck is it then? If people memorize any other text, and as you said, memorization get's lost in translation, there would be *hundreds* of versions of that text cropping up due to people remembering different thing. But there is not even one for the Qur'an. That is in itself a miracle of the Qur'an and it's preservation.

&gt;Hasn't Arabic pronunciation changed in 1400 years? You know like every other language? Or is the Arabic language also magical?

There are 7 different ways of reciting the Qur'an, think of it like an accent. They read the same text but it sounds *slightly* different due to their accent. But the classical Arabic the Qur'an was revealed and compiled in has kept the language of the Qur'an intact for 1400 years. 

Even reputable non-Muslim scholars don't say the Qur'an is not authentic. You will try to find anything to deny the truth. Keep mocking, we will see who will mock who in a little while:

&gt;Surely they who are guilty used to laugh at those who believe. And whenever they passed by them, used to wink at each other (in mockery); And when they saw them, they said: Most surely these are in error; But on this Day the Believers will laugh at the Unbelievers. (83:29-34)

I hope you realize the truth before it's too late. 

&gt;Do they await except its result? The Day its result comes those who had ignored it before will say, ""The messengers of our Lord had come with the truth, so are there [now] any intercessors to intercede for us or could we be sent back to do other than we used to do?"" They will have lost themselves, and lost from them is what they used to invent. (7:53)

6703,"&gt;So to summarise you do think that if 2000 people memorised a 502 page book they would be able to remember it by the word and not one single detail would be changed or missing for 20 years?

First of all, the Qur'an is in poetry, the Arabians hobby was to memorize poetry before the revelation of the Qur'an. It's not a block of text, it's full of symbols, metaphors and rhymes. All the verses rhyme. Making it *very* easy to memorize. If 2000 people all memorized the same thing, and they missed multiple details, that would mean that all 2000 people forgot the **same** things for them not to make another version of the Qur'an. What another a coincidence... 

Also, the Qur'an was written down by companions of the Prophet. Every single verse was written down. It's like we make a verbal contract, but just in case, we write it down so you can't go back on it and change it. Every verse in the Qur'an had a written copy to it that was witnessed by people.

Also, yes every single detail wouldn't be changed. Go to a Hafs (person who has memorized the Qur'an) and *only* change the vowel sound of a word, not even the whole word, and they will correct you. 

",2015-12-10 02:35:47+00:00,cxtmzs8,13.0,t1_cxtmorp,513.0,islam
6704,"&gt;Not if the ""definitive copy"" of the Quran was compiled before others could arise. Which is exactly what happened with Uthman ibn Affan 25 years after Muhammad had left earth.

The Qur'an was memorized by *thousands* and if they did not agree on the compilation that Uthman approved, there would have been different versions. 

&gt;The Quran compiled by Uthman might be the copy we have today, but we have no way to be 100% it was as Muhammad intended it to be because he was not there to oversee it. It was compiled by mere fallible humans, not prophets.

As I said, people memorized the book by heart and if the version that was approved of by Uthman was incorrect, then other people would have compiled a different Qur'an. Thus we would have many versions. But we don't.

&gt;""So I started looking for the Holy quran and collected it from (what was written on) palm-leaf stalks, thin white stones, and also from men who knew it by heart, until I found the last verse of Surat at-Tauba (repentance) with Abi Khuzaima al-Ansari, and I did not find it with anybody other than him. (Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 6, p. 478)""

That verse was memorized by people, *they knew* that verse but needed a witness to it. Khuzaima was the only one who had the written part of that verse. For those verses to be part of the Qur'an, you would need 2 witnesses who agreed to it. 

&gt;Abu Bakr sent for me and said, ''You used to write the Divine Revelations for Allah's Apostle : So you should search for (the Qur'an and collect) it.'' **I started searching for the Qur'an till I found the last two Verses of Surat At-Tauba with Abi Khuzaima Al-Ansari and I could not find these Verses with anybody other than him.** (They were): Verily there has come unto you an Apostle (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty â€¦' (9.128-129)

What's actually funny is that the Prophet said Khuzaimas witnessing equals the witness of 2 people.

&gt;When we collected the fragramentary manuscripts of the Qur'an into copies, I missed one of the Verses of Surat al-Ahzab **which I used to hear Allah's Apostle reading.** Finally I did not find it with anybody except **Khuzaima Al-Ansari, whose witness was considered by Allah's Apostle equal to the witness of two men.** (And that Verse was:) Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah.'

As you can read, people already knew the verses because the Prophet used to recite them, they just needed a witness. So what a coincidence that the Prophet allowed Khuzaima's witness to be equal the witness of 2 people before he died. Thus making the case even more proof of the authenticity of those verses.

&gt;The others might have memorised it but how on earth are you 100% sure they got every detail right?

Because if thousands of people memorized it and all agreed on it, then it is correct. Your missing the point, if people had differing accounts of the Qur'an, there would have been *hundreds* of versions of the Qur'an. Especially since it was transmitted through memorization.

&gt;Why did they need to find it written down?

Because that's how the compilation of the Qur'an went. You still need the written verse and 2 witnesses for it to be part of the Qur'an. The fact that people memorized it, and all agreed to the same version, is only more proof of it.

&gt;If even the Quran states that they had trouble compiling it and almost completed it lacking a verse, doesn't that tell you something?

Where does the Qur'an state they had trouble compiling it? And the verse you are talking about, as I said, was memorized by thousands of people. To have it part of the Qur'an, you'd need two witnesses. What a coincidence that the *only* person who had that verse written equal to 2 witnesses by the Prophet of Allah, thus making it part of the Qur'an. Even more proof of the divine intervention of the preserving of the Qur'an. 

&gt;It was compiled not by a prophet or messenger but by mere men who are therefore susceptible to mistakes.

The Prophet memorized it and told his followers how to compile the Qur'an. He told them where each verse goes and in what order. He told them what order the chapters would be in and what the verses in that Chapter were. They knew how many verses were in each chapter, but needed witnesses to it. The fact that the compiler of the Qur'an knew the verses in Surah Tuaba, but just wanted a witness to it, shows that they knew those verses were part of the Qur'an. 

The fact that they all agreed on the compilation as well as the final version made, is only yet again, more proof of the authenticity of the Qur'an. Had people memorized different things, there would have been hundreds of versions of the Qur'an, but we only have one. Also, the Qur'an is written in ring formation and if it had been sloppily compiled on the men's own accord, it wouldn't be uniquely formatted as it is.

As I said, the fact of the matter is that God promised to guard the Qur'an from corruption.

&gt;Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur'an and indeed, We will be its guardian. (15:9)

If any other text were memorized, there would have been different accounts of that text and it would have had *hundreds* of versions. But not the Qur'an, it was memorized, agreed upon by everyone, and has stayed the same for 1400 years. As God also said:

&gt;And We have certainly made the Qur'an easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember? (54:17)

All your attempts at attacking the authenticity of the Qur'an fall short. Based on your argument of the Qur'an being made up, all it would have taken is one version of the Qur'an to be different for the statements to be invalidated. It must just be a coincidence that God said he will protect the Qur'an, and through all the memorization, there's only one version. It must also be a coincidence that God said he made it *easy* to remember, thus why no-one disagreed about the Qur'an. There are so many statements in the Qur'an that give you the chance to deny it. So many chances, if the Qur'an had been faked, to falsify it. Why would the writer of a book threaten you with statements that *could*, in the future, be falsifiable and invalidate the book? Because the one who made the book knows you will never be able to. So take refuge in it, or be from among the losers in hell. 

&gt;And yet, they [who are bent on denying the truth] assert, ""[Muhammad] has invented it!"" Say [unto them]: ""Produce, then, a surah of similar merit; and [to this end] call to your aid whomever you can, other than God, if what you say is true! (10:38)

&gt;Or do they say, ""He invented it""? Rather, it is the truth from your Lord, [O Muhammad], that you may warn a people to whom no warner has come before you [so] perhaps they will be guided. (32:3)

You can continue to question the validity of God and the Qur'an, but soon will you come to know. When it's too late. 

&gt;Of what do they ask one another? About the great event, Concerning which they are in disagreement. Verily, they shall soon (come to) know! Verily, verily they shall soon (come to) know! (78:1-5)

Also, in general, memorization is more susceptible to having many different words forgotten and added like you said. If thousands of people memorized a text for years, then we would have at least hundreds of different versions of that text by now.

For the caliphate to be established, Imam Mehdi must appear from Saudi Arabia. To know that he is the *true* Imam, a army will come to attack him, but God will cause the earth to swallow them up. If that happens, then he is the true Imam. This is the hadith of our Prophet giving us a outline of events until he comes:

&gt;""The Prophethood will last among you for as long as Allah (God) wills, then Allah would take it away.

This ends with the death of the Prophet.

&gt;Then it will be (followed by) a Khilafah [caliphate] Rashida (rightly guided) according to the ways of the Prophethood. It will remain for as long as Allah wills, then Allah would take it away.

This was the Caliphates of Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman and Ali that ended.

&gt;Afterwards there will be a hereditary leadership which will remain for as long as Allah wills, then He will lift it if He wishes.

This was the hereditary Leadership like Umayyads, Abbasids, Ottomans etc. which ended.

&gt;Afterwards, there will be biting oppression, and it will last for as long as Allah wishes, then He will lift it if He wishes.

This is the current stage we are living in with the revolutions and conflicts to do with most Muslim nations and their oppressive rulers. I.e Assad in Syria.

&gt;Then there will be a Khilafah Rashida [Guided Caliphs] according to the ways of the Prophethood,""

The internet gives anyone the opportunity to seem knowledgeable when most of them aren't. If they want something to study and *critique*, it should be their Bible, and if they critiqued it well enough, they'd be Muslim. 

ISIS was already for tolled to us by our Prophet. You can read the hadith [here](http://sunnah.com/bukhari/61/118). I'll highlight some points to make with some context:

&gt;""In the last days of this world there will appear some young foolish people who will use (in their claim) the best speech of all people (i.e. the Qur'an)

These people will claim that they are following the *true* Islam and will feel all other Muslims are inferior and should follow their way. Their devoutness, from praying to fasting, will make regular Muslims feel belittled as if, maybe this group of people are correct.

&gt;...and they will abandon Islam as an arrow going through the game. Their belief will not go beyond their throats (i.e. they will have practically no belief)...

They recite the Qur'an, but it only reaches their throat. It doesn't reach their *intellect*, because if it did, they'd know Islam forbids the things they do. Thus, their actions take them out of the fold of Islam. 

&gt;so wherever you meet them, kill them, 

So we're basically supposed to condemn them and want to kill them because they're making Islam look bad and will lead people astray. ISIS does not represent Islam, or else our prophet wouldn't say to kill them and that they'd be dogs of hell.

6747,"Well one of my best friends that converted with me to Islam is attracted to men. He speaks to many struggling Muslims about his battles and wouldn't mind that I speak on his behalf. He doesn't identify as being gay because he feels like he is in the wrong body. He'd be more, as put in Arabic terms, a mukhannath. 

&gt;According to the Scholar and hadith collector An-Nawawi (RA):

&gt;&gt;A mukhannath is the one (“male”) who carries in his movements, in his appearance and in his language the characteristics of a woman. There are two types; the first is the one in whom these characteristics are innate, he did not put them on by himself, and therein is no guilt, no blame and no shame, as long as he does not perform any (illicit) act or exploit it for money (prostitution etc.). The second type acts like a woman out of immoral purposes and he is the sinner and blameworthy.

He obviously knows that sodomy is haram so he takes pills that reduce his libido as well as fasting the way David Pbuh did, every other day. This has helped him reduce his sexual drive to almost nothing. He is one of the best Muslims and is my role model in regards to iman and faith. May Allah reward him in his struggles.

I think Muslims have to be more open minded and realize that there is variation in Allah's creation. Not all men are masculine and not all women are feminine. If you are attracted to the same sex, then that is your trial to see if you will over-come it.

The Prophet actually gave mukhannath's a high status during his time.

Ibn Abd Al-Barr who was a contemporary of An-Nawawi explains:

&gt;The Mukhannathun were given a high status in the times of the Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) as being ""guardians of sacred boundaries” and even gave them the privilege to guard not only the “harem” of women, but also the most sacred “harem” in Makkah and the one in Madinah. From the 12th century on it is reported that they were the dignified guardians of the grave of the noble Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam), a custom that held on until the end of the Ottoman rule over the two sacred cities.

&gt;Sadly the high place given to the mukhannathun in Muslim society did not survive the colonial times. It was the beloved Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) who first gave such a high position of authority to the Mukhannathun but when Ottoman rule ended then that is when Islams rule ended. 

&gt;When the kufaar regimes moved in, the high position of the Mukhannathun was over. So it is Islam which gave the Mukhannathun such a high position. Afterwards ignorance spread and unfortunately we are in a state of ignorance today about many issues and matters.

&gt;May Allah open our eyes and make us the best towards others. Ameen.

&gt;And Allah knows best in all matters

Anyways, a person with such difficulties should live a celibate life for the pleasure of Allah, knowing that his/her reward will be a great one with Allah, and that Allah is the *most* just in his judgement.

All the things they missed out on in this life, will be rewarded in the next one, the one that actually matters.

6752,"Well the Qur'an explicitly says to wear a headscarf and draw it over the front of your body as well.

&gt;**وَقُلْ لِلْمُؤْمِنَاتِ يَغْضُضْنَ مِنْ أَبْصَارِهِنَّ وَيَحْفَظْنَ فُرُوجَهُنَّ وَلَا يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلَّا مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا ۖ وَلْيَضْرِبْنَ بِخُمُرِهِنَّ عَلَىٰ جُيُوبِهِنَّ**

&gt;And say to the believing women that they cast down their looks and guard their private parts and do not display their ornaments except what appears thereof, **and let them wear their head-coverings over their bosoms...**[24:31]

During the times of Muhammad some women would wear a head-scarf and let it droop down from their backs covering their backside. Allah tells us to draw that same head-scarf over the front as well and cover our bosoms.

So the head-scarf is mandatory in Islam, you can choose not to, but you are not obeying one of God's commandments for women. It's also to differentiate you from the rest of women, so that it is known you are a believing one.

**Edit:** I watched some of the video and the women speakers are plain dumb. Nothing is against womens rights in Islam. Women were treated like crap before Islam and baby girls would be buried alive. Allah raised the position of women, and women are regarded highly in Islam more then any other religion. Also, she spoke about inheritance being half as much for women. Women receive half the inheritance of a man because they are not responsible to use it on other then themselves. A women inheritance is for her own-self and no-one can tell her what to do what that money. On the other hand, a man must take responsibility for his wife as well as children, which is why they inherit more.

If a married Muslim women chooses to work and makes 100k a year while her husband makes 50k, she is not responsible for using that money to take care of her children and husband as well as feed the family. She can do what she wants to do with it, while men have to use their salary to pay for their wives, children, mothers, as well as sisters.

6756,"Regarding your Question about God knowing so what's the point. This question has to do with Qadr, or predestination. I'll try to explain it the best way I make sense of it.

Allah knows everything that has happened, *is* happening, and will happen. We are living in a universe that has *time* and are governed by it. Allah is not governed by time. He can see everything all at once. We see that the universe is 15 billion years old, Allah sees it as he just made it a second ago, or even less because to him, what is time? Allah is infinite, what is 15 billion years compared to infinite? It is *zero*.

Also, Allah already knows Judgement day. To him, it has already happened. As I said, this world is only a test for us, so Judgement day isn't for Allah to know who goes where, but it is for us. So when we go to heaven or hell, you understand why. Allah could've just placed everyone where he *knew* they would go, without giving us the test. But that would be unfair to his creation, we'd argue that had he given us the chance, we would have believed and done better. So Allah, being the most just, has placed us in this test so that we will witness against ourselves. We can't blame Allah and say, *""Well, had you let us on earth, we would have believed.""* He gave you that chance, so there is no excuses on that day. And as I said, even though he knows where each person is going, Judgement day will be for you to know why you're there.

Finally, Allah is *thee* infinite. Okay, say you go to heaven. We stay there for infinity correct? So we are going to be in heaven living in a *potential infinite*. Time will never end there so all our actions are going toward an infinite, but we are not *thee* infinite. The days will never end, so we are moving towards an infinity but we will never **become** the absolute infinity. Think about it like this, if you had never ending days, and you picked out one apple from a tree everyday. You'd have 1 apple the first day, 2 the second, etc. You will always be picking an apple as the days never end, so you will be working toward an infinity number of apples, but never actually reach it because the next day, you'll add one more. This goes on forever. On the other hand, Allah is the absolute infinite, he doesn't work towards an infinity like we will in heaven or hell, he **is** the infinity.

Everything in the universe is governed by certain laws. Even our own bodies are governed by processes that go about in the way Allah made them. Your heart constricts and contracts, your lung inhale and exhale, all in his worship. The only thing that is free to chose what it wants to do is your soul.

You can chose to be grateful for the gift of life that God has given you, or you can chose to be ungrateful. All the blessings, from the air to the food we eat, are from God. The blessings are shown to us when God brings about a child that is blind, or a child that is deaf, or a child that can't speak. A reminder for the blessing *you* were given, and if you will acknowledge them. Will you be grateful for your existence, or will you be ungrateful, that is the test.

The ones that acknowledge the gifts with worshiping him for a few moments of their entire existence, are given a bigger gift, which is eternal life and heaven. The ones that are arrogant or in denial, will be recompensed for their ingratitude with hell.

An atheist will be asked by God, did I not give you air to breathe? Did I not give you an earth which sprouts harvest for you to eat? Did I not give you eyes to see? Did I not give you speech to communicate? Give you ears to hear? Did I not give you an intellect to find me? Did I not give you shelter and well-being? Did I not give you many trials to come back to me? Did I not show you the similitude of your resurrection in the earth you eat from? Did you think I created you without a purpose, when I created everything else with a purpose? You enjoyed all my gifts, yet denied me?

Your reminders are all around you. God has given us similitude's to understand that we will be brought back and held accountable for our actions. Our objective morality of right and wrong is an example of that. Another example is the earth we walk on. Does God not bring a dead earth back to life before your eyes? And you think the one who placed the process of bringing a dead earth back to life, cannot bring you back as well, when you become part of that same earth?

As I said, the ones who are grateful for all the blessings they were given, will be rewarded with an even better gift. The ones who didn't, will be given a life opposite to the one they took for granted here.

Obey him and suffer in life, which is basically 0 compared to infinity, and you are *given* eternity of pleasure. Notice *given*, because no human will every deserve heaven based on their deeds.

Well I think he is just created for the purpose of being a trial. I would think of him like the Pharaoh of Egypt during Moses time. He got high on his power and anyone who denied him as their lord, would be killed. Like his wife when she denounced him and professed her God to be the God of the Children of Israel. He brutally murdered her, but she was smiling all through-out the torture, because Allah was showing her Jannah in the sky.

He is like that, but the difference is he will actually possess abilities that will make people really believe he is God. So it's a *harder* test. 

&gt;Would anyone knowingly choose hell, especially the hell described in the Quran?

Well if you profess him as your God you go to Hell because that is associating others with God which is unforgivable. If you claim that you're God that's even worse. The people who follow him will be the lowest of the low, who are materialist and love the worldly life. They would do anything to survive and don't care about anything except what's in-front of them. So they get just that, everything in the worldly life, and nothing in the hereafter.

6788,"Dajjal is a trial from Allah to distinguish the *true* believers from the false ones. His message will be the *anti* message of Jesus who was trying to make people focus on the next life. That this life is temporary and you need to do whatever you can to get to the next one. Do not be fooled by the worldly things (basically materialism) but focus on eternity in the kingdom of Heaven. Allah tells us in the Qur'an:

&gt;Do men imagine that they will be left (at ease) because they say, We believe, and will not be tested with affliction? (29:2)

So the Dajjal's coming is a test basically, like the many test we all have in life. It's a form on purification, it separates the good from the bad. The Dajjal will make you profess that he is your lord so that you can enjoy what he comes with. Before the Dajjal appears by 3 years, the earth will with-hold 1/3 of it's rain the first year. 2/3 the second, and all of it the third. The world will be going through major famine and strife. Dajjal will be given powers to command the sky to rain on whom he pleases, and for the earth to withdraw it's vegetation to whom he pleases. The people who will recieve these benefits are those who declare him as their God.

The Muslims are warned to keep away from him, and to suffer through whatever they need to. If they have to starve to death, then they starve. We must not follow him at *all* costs even though it will be difficult not to. The whole point of Dajjal is to see who will follow him with the promise of everything the material world has to offer, and to see those who won't follow for the promise of Jannah.

You might think that's crazy, and it might be. But it really doesn't compare to eternity. Yes Muslims will have to suffer for a while, but all the suffering they had will be recompensed and more in Jannah. What is a couple years of suffering compared to infinity? Nothing. 

So that is the point of Dajjal. To separate those who *really* want heaven, from the ones who proclaim it with there tongue but can't handle a trial to *earn* it. ",2015-12-03 23:01:41+00:00,cxm8g8e,1.0,t3_3vc7wp,1507.0,islam

I have a friend from childhood who was *very* feminine and attracted to men. He was assaulted by men multiple times as a child so there's that. Don't know if that contributed to his sexual orientation or not...

We went to elementary school as well as high-school together. He was always super feminine, he even looks more feminine then many women. From his frame, voice, to his facial features, everything about him is girly. It's the way Allah created him and he's in his twenties now.

We converted to Islam together after researching it and visiting lectures/seminars. He gets flack from a-lot of Muslims which pisses me off so I always feel the need to defend him. Is it his fault he was molested and that he looks the way he does? No, but many Muslims are very narrow minded.

Anyways, he knows sodomy is haram so he takes some pills that help drop his libido. He also fasts every other day which helps control his desires. He is literally my role model in regards to faith and Iman. He has more Iman than the majority of Muslims and may Allah reward him for that. 

In Islam, this life is only a temporary test. Every person is given their own set of trials, and if my friend can be a good Muslim through all that he has to overcome, anyone can.

&gt;He was created from a fluid

He was created from a fluid, i.e Sperm.

&gt;**Emerging** from between the backbone and the ribs.

The Qur'an does not say *created* because that would be wrong. It says *emerging*. Meaning that the sperm that you ejaculate during sex, *emerges from between the backbone and ribs.* This is correct because although sperm is made in the testicles, it is *stored* in the seminal vesicles which is in the *abdomen*. The sperm is mixed with other fluids and enzymes and *stored* in the seminal vesicle for when you need to ejaculate.

Go look in the mirror if you're a male. Find your lowest rib which is *slightly* above your navel. Then trace your spine and it will end right before your anus. Stand sideways in the mirror and imagine a diagonal line from slightly above your navel or belly button, to the bottom of your spine or buttocks. The diagonal line will pass right over the bladder and seminal vesicle. 

Exactly where you sperm is *ejected* from, between the backbone and ribs.

&gt; bones coming before flesh).

Technically they form adjacent to one another but the flesh wraps up the bones. So for flesh to wrap bones, bones occur slightly first or there would be nothing to wrap over. Since you probably didn't read the links  u/root_access_7 gave you, I'll take some quotes and explain it here.

&gt;ثُمَّ خَلَقْنَا النُّطْفَةَ عَلَقَةً فَخَلَقْنَا الْعَلَقَةَ مُضْغَةً فَخَلَقْنَا الْمُضْغَةَ عِظَامًا **فَكَسَوْنَا** الْعِظَامَ لَحْمًا ثُمَّ أَنْشَأْنَاهُ خَلْقًا آخَرَ ۚ فَتَبَارَكَ اللَّهُ أَحْسَنُ الْخَالِقِين

&gt;Then We made the seed a clot, then We made the clot a lump of flesh, then We made (in) the lump of flesh bones, then We clothed the bones with flesh, then We caused it to grow into another creation, so blessed be Allah, the best of the creators.

The word I put in bold begins with *fa*, which would mean adjacent to each other or immediately after another. So the wrapping of the bones with flesh occurs synonymous or almost *immediately* after. Microscopic research on embryos confirms that bones develop before muscle and flesh does. First, the cartilage tissue of the embryo ossifies. Then muscular cells that are selected from among the tissue around the  bones come together and wrap around the bones. In John Allan and Beverley Kramer's book, The Fundamentals of Human Embryology, 2nd Edition page 148, it says the following:

&gt;Soon **after the cartilaginous models of the bones have been established**, the myogenic cells, which have now become myoblasts, **aggregate to form muscle masses on the ventral and dorsal aspects of the limbs.**

&gt;&gt;**The muscles and tendons become attached to the bony structures** so that they can produce their actions across the joints.

He goes on to say:

&gt;Although precursor cells (myoblasts, or primitive muscle cells) are present adjacent to developing bone, **differentiation into skeletal muscle attachments occur after the ossification process** in the shaft and ends of the bones has begun.

So the Qur'an is correct. 

All embryologists would say the Qur'an's explanation of embryological development is spot on. The point I was making was that Greek scientists got many things wrong, like that man was made from menstrual blood. For Muhammad to get it spot on, he would have to omit the wrong things, which is impossible.

What I think you should start doing is reading the Qur'an more. Read translations and listen to reciters, it makes a huge difference. It will bring you healing during these tough times. You might cry, but let it all out. The Qur'an's true power is made apparent in our times of difficulty. 

Regarding your prayer, you should start praying regularly. What might help in the beginning is using it to complain. Think about it like getting 5 times a day, to complain to Allah and tell him all your issues. Ask him for guidance and help, ask him for *anything*, and know the help of Allah is always near. This is what helped me establish regular prayer. Through my hectic life, I would find peace in complaining to the creator of the worlds, and felt *safe* no matter what happened.

What I usually like to tell people who have trouble praying is, when people see a progeny bust out some amazing compositions on the piano, what do people do right after? They give that person a standing ovation. Now look at the universe you live in. Don't you think that you should be giving a standing ovation to the one who made it? Your prayer is that standing ovation, *literally*.

I'm not married nor am I a parent that would be able to give you great advice regarding those matters, but I hope I gave you some advice regarding strengthening your faith and prayer. Remember Allah in your times of stability, and Allah will remember you during times of instability.

6813,"&gt;The Quran says rather clearly that atheists and polytheists (including most Christians) are going to hell fire!

No-one is going to Hell if they did not get the *true* message of Islam. If they received the *true* message and denied it, then they are held accountable. Do you think Allah is going to send the millions of Hindus in India who know *nothing* about Islam to Hell? No. Same thing for atheists. But if they try to mock Islam and spread lies about it, like many atheists do, then who knows what Allah will do to them.

Remember, no-one is going to Hell without knowing *why* they are there. Everyone will be treated justly and will accept the punishment they get, because they will be witnesses against themselves. All your secrets will be laid out, and will witness against you. An atheist might *reveal* that he doesn't believe in God for whatever reason, but many on the inside are arrogant and in denial. That arrogance and denial that is hidden from us in this world, will be revealed in a physical form on the Day of Judgement and will witness against the person. 

&gt;How can a merciful God send Gandhi or Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg (who is going to give more than 4.5 Billion to charity) to hell!

Again, none of these people are going to Hell for certain. But I think your confusing what is essentially *good* in Allah's eyes. Allah gave us an outline of what a good person is and who will enter Jannah. The first thing in being a good person is acknowledging Allah and worshiping him. Then all the other things like charity etc. are rewarded subsequently.

On the other hand, you can be an atheist that donates billions of dollars to help the poor. If you know the true message of Islam and deny it, as well as deny the creator then nothing you do is *good* in the eyes of Allah. It may seem good to us human beings, but the whole essence of our creation is to worship Allah. An atheist who denies Allah can do all the good things he can, on the day of Judgement, his good deeds will be like scattered dust. Helping him in nothing whatsoever.

&gt;Even Abu Talib went to hell, despite protecting the Prophet (PBUH)!

He knew the true message of Islam and denied it, that's why he is going to Hell. If he did not know the true message, he would've been tested accordingly on the Day of Judgement.

Qur'an verse:

The Qur'an says that the sperm you emit during an orgasm is emitted from between your backbone and ribs. It did not say *created* because that would be wrong.

And the Qur'an is correct. Although the sperm is made in the testicles, it is stored in the seminal vesicle which is right behind the bladder, which is in your abdomen. The sperm is mixed with other fluids and enzymes in the seminal vesicle to aid the sperms journey to the ovary. So when you orgasm, the sperm comes out from there.

Now if you go look in your mirror and find your lowest rib, it is slightly above your belly button or navel. If you trace your backbone, it goes down to almost the bottom of your buttocks.

One* And as I said, evidence for faith is *subjective*. I'm a natural believer in God and chose Islam as my religion because what **I** found to be evidence. No-one would be Muslim if they didn't *subjectively* find evidence that made sense to them. From all the prophesies found in the previous scriptures, to all the prophesies Muhammad gave us that have come true. 

&gt;Yes, you believe that New Testament is made up just like Christians believe Qur'an is made up. 

Obviously Christians believe the Qur'an is man made. They wouldn't be Christians if they didn't. As as a former agnostic wondering which faith is true, I came to the conclusion that the Bible was written by men by looking into history and reading the Bible. This is obvious throughout the contradictions found in it, as well as the synoptic gospels who were anonymously authored. On the other we have the Qur'an, which was revealed to one man in eloquent poetry which everyone called him a magician for. Basically acknowledging the supernatural nature of the Qur'an. We also have *thousands* of primary sources for Muhammad's life which would provide much more room for error and fallibility. Instead, the primary sources only confirm my, and many Muslims belief.

&gt;You mistake your facts with your believes.

I use the facts of what I have in-front of me, the thousands of primary sources of Muhammad and the Qur'an, to the things found in the Qur'an no human would know, to build my faith in the unseen. As I said, faith isn't a fact that can be proven objectively, or else there would be no point to it. 

&gt;And you started with saying NT is made up while Qur'an is true.

I said why **I** believe the NT is made up while the Qur'an is not. If he chooses to do his own research and agree with me, then that is his choice. If not, that is his own choice as well.

As I said over and over again, all you have to do is produce **ONE** chapter like that found in the Qur'an, and you would obliterate one of the worlds largest religion. We've been waiting for 1400 years. So call me when you do brat (brother in Polish, not calling you a brat) ;)

Faith can't be proven... If it could be objectively proven, then what would be the point. But if you're going to follow a faith, you'd follow one you believe makes sense and has more evidence to back it up, which Islam does. That is what I was replying to, I wasn't proving faith to an atheist, I was giving my view of why Islam is true while Christianity is not to a *believer* in God. 

&gt; Claiming one is true while other is not is just silly.

As I said, the Bible, written hundreds of years before Muhammad prophesied his coming:

&gt;And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which [men] deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, [I pray thee]: and he saith, I cannot; for it [is] sealed: **And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, [I pray thee]: and he saith, I am not learned.** (Isaiah 29)

But whatevs, I could care less what you think. When you figure out what caused the universe and why, give me a call. And when one of you makes just *one* chapter like the Qur'an, give me a call too. I mean it's just **one** chapter and you'd debunk one of the worlds largest religion. Until then, it goes in one ear and out the other.

And as I also said, the reply wasn't for an atheist, it was for someone choosing between Christianity or Islam. I gave him a reply for why to choose Islam and not Christianity.

6826,"&gt;You can claim exactly the same about Qur'an.

No you cannot. The Qur'an was revealed to an illiterate man who was preaching poetry the *best* in Arabia couldn't rival. They called him a magician because they knew what his poetry wasn't the works of a human being. It has things in it no human being would've known in that time. Obviously this means nothing to you, but to debunk the Qur'an is very simple. The Qur'an asks you to make only *one* chapter like it if you think it's not from God.

We've been waiting for 1400 years for someone to do it, yet no-one has. All we get is people saying the Qur'an is man-made. So until someone makes a chapter like it, the Qur'an's challenge stands. 

Also, as Muslims we believe that the Torah and Bible prophesied the coming of Muhammad. There are many examples but I'll give just one found in Isaiah of the Bible:

&gt;And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which [men] deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, [I pray thee]: and he saith, I cannot; for it [is] sealed: **And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, [I pray thee]: and he saith, I am not learned.** (Isaiah 29)

Anyone who reads the biography of the Prophet will know that he was told to recite the Qur'an by an angel and he replied **I am not learned** three times. A direct fulfillment of the Prophesy found in the Bible hundreds of years before Muhammad's existence.

&gt;Both religions are based on faith and not real evidences so saying that one disproves the other is silly.

What is evidence for us might not be evidence for you. It's as simple as that. It's called faith for a reason. What's silly to me is seeing a dead earth come back to life and not being able to fathom that the cause which placed that mechanism in place, could not place a mechanism to do the same thing to me in the future, when I *also* become part of that same earth. What's silly to me is believing that the cause which brought the universe into existence the first time, can't cause another one to exist. 

But anyways, the Qur'an has more subjective evidence then the Bible does and that's why we follow it. And that is why Islam is the fastest growing religion and why so many Christians convert to Islam. It would've been the other-way around had the Bible had more subjective evidence for people, but it does not. ",2015-11-30 08:57:56+00:00,cxhr5ul,3.0,t1_cxhqrf0,1585.0,islam

&gt;Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. Matthew 5:17

&gt;Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. Matthew 5:19

&amp; **nothing** that goes against it.

 &gt; “Let the People of the Gospel judge by **what God has revealed therein**” (5:47)

So Judge by what God has *revealed* in it, and not what your false writers have placed in it. Judge by what Jesus preached, not by what Paul taught and changed. But you don't have the Gospel of Jesus, you don't even know the *true* authors of the synoptic Gospels. Which is what God is trying to make you understand, that how can you say such a book is from God?

&gt; And We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], the Book in truth, confirming that which preceded it of the Scripture and as a criterion over it. (5:48)

And God sent Muhammad with the Qur'an to only confirm the **truth** of the Gospels and Torah, and remove all man-made lies.

&gt;The Messiah, son of Mary, was not **but a messenger**; [other] messengers have passed on before him. And his mother was a supporter of truth. They both **used to eat food**. **Look how We make clear to them the signs; then look how they are deluded.** (5:75)

Jesus was nothing a messenger like all the messengers before him. Jesus ate food, yet God is self sufficient. Look how *clear* God has made the signs for you, and then I'll look at how deluded you are. You follow *nothing*, but conjecture.  ",2015-11-30 02:28:31+00:00,cxhgdkq,6.0,t1_cxgts4g,36615.0,islam

6839,"I think the Muhammad pbuh was allowed more wives because he was a prophet. Prophets have more responsibility and more duties, especially since they're establishing a religion. Most of his marriages were for political reasons. He was married to his first wife for 25 years and then married the rest during his prophet-hood, which is when his responsibilities skyrocketed. Also, all his wives were widows except Aisha. And many previous Prophets of God were married to *much* more women than Muhammad pbuh.

If the average man who has *average* responsibilities is allowed four, Muhammad pbuh, who was *establishing* a religion and had exceptionally high responsibilities, should've been allowed more. And it is apparent because, as I said, before his Prophet-hood, he was married to only one wife. When his responsibilities increased as a Prophet, that's when he married the rest. 

And it's not like it really benefited him that he married that many wives though, they were all widows who *needed* a husband to support and take care of them. His favorite wife was Aisha, and I'm sure he would've been fine or even happier with *just* her, but the marriages weren't for his pleasure, they were for the widows livelihood and care-taking.

He quoted a verse in the Qur'an which correlates with a verse in the Bible as well as a hadith that correlates with a parable of Jesus. I don't find that odd because the Qur'an is from the same God of the Torah and Gospel so they would have similarities.

&gt;Muhammad grew up amongst christians and jews, he would have had acess to such text or oral message.....

Source please? &amp; Muhammad pbuh grew up among mostly idol worshipers. His first wife's cousin was a Christian who immediately converted to Islam because he knew Muhammad was prophesied in the Bible, whichever Bible he had at the time.

&gt;why does him incorporating teachings in previous religions to his new revelation prove islam is the truth?

It doesn't really. Islam is the truth for many reasons but I feel like your implying that Muhammad pbuh copied the Bible which has no basis. Many things in the Qur'an are not in the Bible. The Qur'an has many details correct regarding history while the Bible does not. From the differences in what Egyptians called their rulers during each respective time, one time the Qur'an addresses the ruler as a King, and another time addresses the ruler as a Pharaoh. This is information Muhammad pbuh could not have known as they had no information from Egyptian civilization. We only discovered Egyptian hieroglyphics recently which confirmed the differences in what they called their rulers, in each respective time period.

Another difference is that the Bible tells us that the nation of Abraham worshiped *many* Gods. A very vague statement while the Qur'an tells us what they worshiped in detail. Their major idols were the Sun, moon and Planet Gods. This is confirmed with a recent excavation of the land Abraham lived on. Another thing not found in the Bible that Muhammad pbuh would have never known.

The moon eclipsed when Prophet Muhammad's son died and they did not say the moon split, they called it an Arabic word for eclipse, so there was a difference between an eclipse and what they were seeing then. The people who were witnessing an eclipse would know what it was, and would *not* record in the hadith that the moon split in two, they would just say it eclipsed.

No, circumcision helps prevent diseases. Uncircumcised men have more chance of bacteria accumulating in the foreskin which also spreads during intercourse, so circumcision is still useful.

Alcohol impairs your judgement. It leads to many bad things like rape, incest and DUI's and murder. You can't compare alcohol to cigarettes, although they are still bad and probably haram.

Pigs eat anything, they eat shit and will eat their dead children. Pigs also have a horrible digestive tract which doesn't get rid of the toxins they eat.

For the reason that the news does not represent true Islam. True Islam is reading the Qur'an and Hadith as well as biography of the Prophet. 

When terrorism occurs it causes people to do research about the religion in question, and once they do they, they realize it is the opposite of terrorism and that it is the *true religion*, and what they've been looking for all their lives. They convert and their lives change for the better.

It was the same thing with 9/11 as well as 7/7. It created an appeal to learn about Islam and many people ended up converting.

6900,"&gt;Have you had a personal religious change? Or do you know someone (a friend) who had personal religious change? Have you/your friend become less or more religious over time? Why? Do you know anyone who has become a member of your religion or leave your religion? Why? Please explain.

In Islam there is a concept called Iman. It is almost like nearness to God. The more worship you do like praying and fasting, especially voluntarily, makes you feel closer. Imagine your heart is a cup. The more worship, the more that cup fills with Iman from Allah which feels like bliss. If your cup gets close to full you feel as if Allah is with you wherever you go, you feel as if Allah is listening to your call directly. The less that cup is full, the more you feel distant from him. Don't confuse this with *him* being distant, because he is closer to you than your jugular vein. But *YOU* feel as if he is far away from you when he is actually not. 

&gt;How does your religious community change locally, nationally and globally? Is this a good or a bad change? Why? Please explain.

I don't understand this so I will skip it. 

&gt;What is the understanding of God in your religion? Is God seen as Superman, Absent God, or the Arbitrary God? Please explain.

God is unlike anything. Anything you can imagine is not God. He is far above anything you can imagine but we are all in the palm of his arbitrary hands. He is *thee* infinite. Everything is grasped within his knowledge. When we go to heaven or Hell we stay there for eternity or infinity. But we are not infinite, we are living in a *potential infinite*. Meaning we will constantly be moving towards infinity but never actually reach it, while God is not *potentially* infinite but is the *absolute* infinite.

&gt;Is understanding of God alienating (isolating) or non-alienating (nonisolating) in your religion? Why? If alienating then what should be the nonalienating concept of God? Why? Please explain.

Don't understand this question so will skip.

&gt;How do you compare your religion with other religions? Do you believe that your religion is unique or repetition of the previous religions? Please explain.

Our religion is the true religion. All religions can't measure up to Islam and God promises us in the Qur'an that all religions will never stand a chance compared to ours. This is apparent as Islam is the fastest growing religion. Christianity and Judaism have their own scripture which is the Injeel and Torah sent from the *same* God. The Torah's original message was Islam and the people who followed the Torah weren't called Jews in their time, they were Muslims. The Gospels are the work of man and are influenced by Greek Paganism and the religion of Mithras. The Qur'an was the last revelation from God to bring us all back to the straight path. It is a criterion over the what is true in the Torah and Injeel, and dismisses the falsehoods which were done due to the hands of man. The Qur'an continuously addresses Christians and Jews to come back to the Path of God because the Qur'an was meant to put aside the man made differences, but Christians and Jews are arrogant and don't want to follow.

&gt;The differance is that nobody makes women to be half naked in non-muslim countries

You really need to understand your society a little better. The media is a driving force for how women should dress. Western women are in constant competition with each other to see who will get the most attention of men. The more *skimpy* a women dresses, the more men notice her. This leads to more women trying to dress skimpy to continue to outdo the other one.

Have a look at how clothing has changed. Go look at the way women dressed in the 1960's and 70's and you will see how modest they were. Heck, just go back a decade and you will notice a *huge* difference. 

It is exactly what subjugation of a women is. To make women feel the desire to seek attention from men, and the best way to do that is to dress immodestly. Basically, women dress that way *for* men to notice them, and you're telling me that isn't patriarchal subjugation? ",2015-11-23 23:30:23+00:00,cxaqivf,6.0,t1_cxaqcmt,281.0,islam

You have been indoctrinated to believe that what *you* have is freedom while Muslim women are subjugated, when it is actually the *exact* opposite. It's a paradox which seems correct, but when you *actually* look at it, it is the most disgusting type of subjugation to a women.

The Qur'an does not say *created* because that would be wrong. It says *emerging*. Meaning that the sperm that you ejaculate during sex, *emerges from between the backbone and ribs.* This is correct because although sperm is made in the testicles, it is *stored* in the seminal vesicles which is in the *abdomen*. The sperm is mixed with other fluids and enzymes and *stored* in the seminal vesicle for when you need to ejaculate.

Allah knows everything that has happened, *is* happening, and will happen. We are living in a universe that has *time* and are governed by it. Allah is not governed by time. He can see everything all at once. We see that the universe is 15 billion years old, Allah sees it as he just made it a second ago, or even less because to him, what is time? Allah is infinite, what is 15 billion years compared to infinite? It is *zero*.

Also, Allah already knows Judgement day. To him, it already happened. This world is only a test for us, so Judgement day isn't for Allah to know who goes where, but it is for us. So when we go to heaven or hell, we know why we are there.

Allah is *thee* infinite. Okay, say you go to heaven right? We stay there for infinity correct? So we are going to be in heaven living in a *potential infinite*. Time will never end there so all our actions are going toward an infinite, we are not *thee* infinite. Allah is the infinite, he is not potentially infinite like how we will be in Jannah or Jahannum.

6945,"Jesus was not crucified. Crucifixion would mean he had died on the cross which he didn't. The Qur'an tells us that they didn't kill Jesus it was only made to appear to them so. 

&gt;That they said (in boast), ""We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah"";- but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them, and those who differ therein are full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge, but only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killed him not. (4:157)

As God states, Jesus was never killed on the cross and anyone who has doubts is only following conjecture. This is proven in the Bible as all the disciples of Jesus forsook him and left and didn't actually witness his alleged crucifixion.

 Also, we can see time and time again that Jesus was never actually crucified. Crucifixion would mean he would have died on the cross, which just didn't happen. We can disagree but my stance on this is directly from the Bible. There are plenty of verses that show us Jesus was never really dead and was NOT resurrected. Even when Jesus appeared to his disciples in the upper room they were shocked. They had thought he was a spirit. As the Bible, or Paul tells us, that when a person is resurrected he is a spirit. We Muslims also believe that when we are resurrected on Judgement day we will be spirits. Here are some Bible verses with my dialogue:

&gt;""Peace be unto you"", he cried; but his little lambs ""were terrified!"" Luke 24:36-37 ""But they were terrified and affrighted and supposed that they had seen a spirit."" Luke 24:37

So here we can see they were terrified because they thought he was a spirit. So what does Jesus do to show them he is not a spirit and is the same man as he was before? After he greats them with ""Shaloam"" or Salam in Arabic he says:

&gt;""Behold (have a look at) my hands and my feet, that it is I myself (I am the same fellow, man!): handle me and see; for A SPIRIT has no flesh and bones, as you see me have. . . And he showed them his hands and his feet."" Luke 24:39-40

What was Jesus trying to prove here? That he was resurrected or was a spirit? Why does he demonstrate to them to touch his hands and feet? He tells them that a Spirit has no flesh and bones, and he does. So he was not dead and resurrected. Some Christians will say ""Who said that a resurrected person is spiritualised?"" We say Jesus himself. We see Jesus tell them this when Jewish men come to him concerning a Jewess who had seven husbands and they all wondered who would have her in the next life when they are resurrected. He tells them that 'Neither shall they die anymore'. Meaning that a spiritualised person will be immortalized and would not in need of food, shelter, clothing and sex. He goes on to say ""For they are equal unto the angels,"" which means they will be spirits. So to conclude, when Jesus tells them that a spirit has no flesh and bones as you see him have, he is proclaiming he is not a spirit.

&gt;""And when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hands and feet."" Luke 24:40

To prove my point some more, lets see what Paul says on the matter of spirits.

&gt;""But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? And with what body do they come?…so also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption…It is sown a natural body; **it is raised a spiritual body.** There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual"". 1 Corinthians 15:35-46.

Lets continue. To assure his disciples further Jesus asks,

&gt;""Have you here any meat', i.e. anything to eat? ""And they gave him a piece of broiled fish and of a honeycomb, and he took it, and DID EAT before them."" Luke 24:41-43

So Jesus presents his physical body as not a spiritualised one and further goes on to eat, when we know a spiritualised body does not eat, in this world anyways. He is trying to show them that he did not die.

We also know that the Jews wanted a sign from Jesus to know that he is for sure the Messiah.

&gt;""Master, (Hebrew — Rabbi, meaning Teacher) we would have a sign of thee"" Matthew 12:38

What does Jesus tell them would be his miracle?

&gt;""For as Jonah was THREE days and THREE nights in the whale's belly; so shall the son of man be THREE days and THREE nights in the heart of the earth."" Matthew 12:40

So he tells them that his miracle will be the same as Prophet Jonah. We know that Prophet Jonah was thrown off a boat, swallowed by a whale, prayed in the belly of the whale and was vomited on shore.

When Jonah was thrown of the boat was he dead or alive? He was *alive*. When he was swallowed was he dead or alive? *Alive.* When he prayed dead or alive? *Alive.* When he was vomited dead or alive? *Alive.* So he was, **alive, alive, alive.** Jesus is telling them that his miracle will be the *exact* same as Prophet Jonah. But Christians say Jesus was dead in the tomb. 

But how can this be so when Jesus said his miracle is that of Jonah. Meaning he will be alive in the tomb as Jonah was alive in the belly of the whale. Not dead and resurrected. It is either Jesus was lying, or Christians are lying saying he died. I choose to believe Jesus.

Thus, the Qur'an is correct and Jesus was never crucified. 

**Edit:** So when historians say he was crucified, they're *kinda* not wrong. For he was placed on the cross but he did not die. The act of putting him on the cross occurred and this is in line with history, but him dying and being resurrected historians will **never** be able to prove and is really something they shouldn't be speaking about. He could have been *presumed* dead as his disciples had thought when they were thinking he was a spirit (which he wasn't), but in that time people would be pronounced dead when they were just unconscious...There were no means of declaring someone **officially** dead like we have now.

6951,"The Qur'an does not claim the current NT is divinely inspired. Anyone who reads critically the history of Christianity will see how Greek Pagan practices influenced Paul and his teachings. It is shocking how Christians do not see this, it is beyond obvious. As God says:

&gt;So **woe to those who write the ""scripture"" with their own hands, then say, ""This is from Allah ,"" in order to exchange it for a small price. Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn.** (2:79)

But back to the point...

God revealed the Gospel to Jesus, he preached this Gospel orally, just like the Qur'an. 

&gt;And in their footsteps we sent Jesus the son of Mary **confirming the Law that had come before him. We sent him the Gospel**: therein was guidance and light, and **confirmation of the Law.** (5:46)

Is there are Gospel according to Jesus? No. &amp; Jesus came with a Gospel that only **confirmed** what the OT preached, not to change it. You can see hints of it all through out the 4 Gospels, mostly in the first one before the evolution of the story began to fit the Pagan influences of Paul. Paul disregarded many of the OT laws when Jesus only came to confirm them as the Gospel writers wrote Jesus *himself* said. 

The 4 Gospels were not divinely inspired and are a lie. As I said, anyone who reads about early Christianity and the progression of the story of Jesus will see how Greek Pagan ideas influenced the message.

&gt;Christianity (new testament) is divinely inspired then the safer bet is Christianity.

If you think Christianity is the safer bet according to Pascal Wager, you're vastly mistaken. The Bible is full of discrepancies and self contradictions. It's history can be traced to see the Pagan influences that made it what it is today. It is the most unreliable disheveled book I have ever read. To say that book was divinely inspired from God is such an insult to God. That is why God gave Muhammad the Qur'an to act as a criterion over the Bible and the Torah, agree with it where it is correct and dismiss the fabrications by those who wrote the book with their *own hands* i.e Paul. 

&gt;To thee (Muhammad) We sent the scripture(Qur'an) in truth **confirming the scripture** that came before it, and **guarding it in safety.** (2:97)

On the other hand you have the Qur'an and Muhammad Pbuh. The Qur'an was revealed orally and has been kept the same since then. When Muhammad Pbuh was revealing the verses during the 23 years, everyone thought he was a magician because the *best of the best* poets and Arabic linguistics couldn't rival his poetry yet he was illiterate (compared to the Gospels who were written by **dozens of authors** and took **hundreds of years** to compile). Who Muhammad was and what he was speaking couldn't be connected in any logical way to the Arabs, and even to us today, which is obvious because it is a divine revelation. Some people have even done studies to compare the Hadith (the sayings of the Prophet) to the Qur'an. What they found was that 75% of the words in the Qur'an cannot be found in the thousands of hadith. So anyways, everyone knew that what he was preaching wasn't the words of any human, which is why they proceeded to call him a *magician*. 

As I said, the book was revealed in 23 years and in fragments. It was not revealed in order, it was revealed all over the place. Yet, when it was compiled together, it has the most unique literary structure that no book has today. The author (God) knew what he was doing. No linguistic can duplicate the Qur'an which is why God repeatedly challenges people to produce **one** chapter like it if it isn't from him. **Challenge=failed for 1400 years.** If the *best Arabic poets* wanted to shut him up, they would've produced a chapter then and there, but they couldn't. From it's linguistic abilities to its outline of topics to it's scientific accuracy, it is the *only* book that would be the unchanged word of God. 

Also, the book has the most minute details right. For instance the Bible claims the family of Abraham worshiped *many idol gods* while the Qur'an gives in detail what Gods they worshiped which were the *Sun, moon and Jupiter God*. And what do you know? A recent excavation of the city where Abraham lived showed that the major Gods they worshiped were the Sun, Moon and Jupiter God. So any ignorant Christian who says Muhammad copied the Bible, this just shuts their ignorant selves right up. 

Anyways, obviously I believe with *conviction* it is the unchanged word of God, but for someone who is trying to take his gamble, the Qur'an would undoubtedly be it. Saying the Bible is the better gamble is, well just, asinine. 

And this without the many prophecies the Prophet Muhammad gave us regarding the end of times like this one:

&gt;...When you see barefooted, unclothed Bedouins competing in the construction of tall buildings. (Sahih Muslim)

Only 50 years ago Dubai and the U.A.E was full of barefooted Bedouins roaming around, and now they're building the tallest of buildings.
