So I always hear Sunni Muslims say Shias curse the companions, I've heard something called *La'nat*, and I've heard some Shias say ""*la'nat Allah* on so and so person etc."" 

But I don't want to remain ignorant and want to hear it from you guys. Is it a core part of Shia theology to curse the companions? Many shias say they don't, but that's not what I'm asking. I'm asking what Shia theology says. For example, a Muslim can say they are pro-gay marriage but their theology says otherwise, you get what I mean? 

If not, where does this misconception come from?

Please cite scholars on the matter. If there are scholars that denounce it, cite them. If there are scholars that affirm it, cite them. Give me all the opinions on the matter.

&gt;**مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَىٰ**

&gt;The heart did not lie [about] what it saw.

Here the translator says 'heart' and this is synonymous with 'mind' as the definition of the word **فواد** is both 'heart' and 'mind'. Obviously not heart as in the thing that pumps blood, but the spiritual heart.

http://imgur.com/sQRgSVc

http://imgur.com/diF296m

http://imgur.com/NM1V3QS

My question is, was this journey physical or was it mental, as in the soul/mind is what made the journey? Because Allah then says (swt) in 53:17:

&gt;The sight [of the Prophet] did not swerve, nor did it transgress [its limit].

Which would imply physical? But I was thinking it was analogous to our dreams. As in, our minds can see in a dream ( also feel, touch, hear, taste etc), but our physical eyes are not seeing anything if that makes sense. 

It would make sense to be spiritual, since when we die what remains is the soul/nafs/mind. Allah says in 75:26-30:

&gt;Truly, when the soul reaches the collarbone; when it is said, ‘Could any charm-healer save him now?’; when he knows it is the final parting; when his legs are brought together: on that day he 
will be driven towards your Lord. 

The soul is what gets driven to Allah (swt) at death. He also says in 32:12:

&gt;[Prophet], if only you could see the wrongdoers hang their heads before their Lord: ‘Our Lord, now that we have seen and heard, send us back and we shall do good. [Now] we are convinced.

Here the soul can see and hear. 

So yea, I don't know if this is a debated topic but it seems to be spiritual. Also he met with other prophets who had passed away, so I'm assuming he met their souls (?). 

I'm not sure, just wondering what your opinions are. I'm not doubting Allah (swt) could've made it physical, he raised Jesus (pbuh) physically, I'm just inferring on some verses of the Qur'an like I like to do when I'm bored lol.
