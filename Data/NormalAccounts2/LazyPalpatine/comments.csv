12,"&gt; Windu wasn't the only Jedi who suggested removing Palpatine from power. Ki-Adi Mundi did too, and all the Masters who went to arrest Palpatine obviously agreed.

That he convinced multiple people to do something doesn't mean it was the right thing to do, and it doesn't mean he did it for the same reasons they did it. Anakin's defense of me was perfectly in line with established Jedi teachings, but we both know he did it for the wrong reasons and it led to his fall.

&gt;Removing someone from power is not coveting it.

Yeah, except for the very next thing he said was ""The Jedi Council will have to take control of the Senate to ensure a peaceful transition to a new government and a new leadership for the Republic."" Removing someone from power *and then immediately seizing control for yourself* is symptomatic of a lust for power, and Yoda calls him out on it. He does it anyway.

&gt;he tried to arrest him and even a second time after Sidious was kicked over. However when he saw the full extent of his powers and how he would never accept surrender, he realised that no force, even the Jedi, could contain him and he had to be killed on the spot. 

This is just a flat-out lie. He never attempts to arrest me after the fight. He goes *instantly* to ""I will end this"" and ""he's too dangerous to be left alive."" Also, that's in direct contradiction of Jedi teachings, so he was betraying everything he stood for by trying to murder me.

&gt;I would also argue that destroying a Sith Master is also not evil considering the motive is defending the galaxy. It's not even nitpicking - putting down a rabid dog is merciful to the dog and its future victims.

Here we go again. Murder and genocide is a-ok if the person has a belief you don't like? Religiously-motivated violence is peachy keen as long as the victim has the *wrong* religion? Really, people of this religion are like dogs! Animals to be put down!

I'm sure if you think about your own planet's history, you'll realize this line of thinking has led to some very unsavory practices.

&gt;Remember Yoda also said 'destroy the Sith we must'.

Why, yes. The Grandmaster of the Jedi Order *did* advocate for a religious genocide on numerous occasions. Remind me of why it's ok for one religion, but not ok for another? Because the Jedi are the good guys in your mind? Maybe you should step back and ask yourself why you feel that way.",2016-10-12 13:58:40+00:00,d8oreoa,6.0,t1_d8niduw,76663.0,AskScienceFiction

Not through Vaapad, perhaps, but he certainly fell.

I'm not even making a fell-out-the-window joke. At the culmination of the Clone Wars, Windu has clearly fallen. He is tempted by power and jumps at the opportunity (*he* is the one who suggests that the Jedi should seize control of the Republic after they stage a coup on the Chancellor's office, a train of thought Yoda warns will lead to ""a dark place""). He is given the option to show mercy and compassion, but instead strikes out with his anger at (what he thinks to be) an unarmed, defenseless prisoner. He even had Jiminy SkyCricket next to him, telling him point-blank that cutting me down would be a betrayal of the Jedi way and an act of fear. He did it anyway.

This was his trial and his temptation, every bit as much as it was Anakin's. And both of them failed. Windu lusted for power, feared my influence, and reveled in his hatred for the Sith. Then, when given a choice between letting those things go for the good of the Jedi and the Republic, he rejected it and went all in for murder. That was when he fell to the Dark Side.

52,"&gt;If a villain is NEVER in danger of losing whether by 'will of the force' deus ex machina

In fairness, this is also why people believe Luke and Anakin were never in any danger. One of them is looked upon as literally being conceived *by* the Force *to* defeat me.

If you subscribe to the notion that the Force is some sort of deity with a mind that preordains the events of the galaxy and subverts the will of its inhabitants (a view shared by the Jedi and some rather unorthodox Sith such as [Darth Traya](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Darth_Traya)), then this is the only possible conclusion: danger is just as much of an illusion as free will. Just submit yourself to the Force and do what it commands. Don't worry. Don't fear. Don't mourn your dead. Just do what you're told.

The Sith, by and large, do not subscribe to this view. The Force is an energy field, not a magic, invisible man tinkering in our lives. It follows the orders of those with the will to command it, not some mystical [Father](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Father_\(Mortis\)) playing with toys.

As for Windu, yes, I threw that fight. Perhaps, if it were simply a measure of lightsaber combat, I was outmatched. Sadly for the Jedi, proficiency with a lightsaber is a poor measure of my power. He was a tough opponent, and his lightsaber form was difficult to account for, but as you saw at the end, I was never *really* too weak to fight. The moment Windu's relevance to Skywalker was completed (striking out with his passions to harm a Jedi Master in defense of a Sith Master was kind of a big thing for him, you see), I lit his ass up like a Life Day tree and threw him out the window. [My words there were in *direct* contrast to my feigned defeat moments earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29dInj73Bc).

There were plenty of times I was in real danger, though. Yoda's attack was actually surprising at first. He caught me off-guard and if he'd pressed the attack before I regained my balance, he might have won. When Skywalker and Kenobi tore Greivous' ship in half and crashed it into Coruscant, I was in danger. Everybody was in danger. Bane's balls, that was ridiculous. But in general, I specifically planned things to *look* far more hazardous than they were. I'm quite good at that, and it's much easier to do when nobody realizes you have any reason to plan such a thing.

-----

(Out of character: yeah, Palps lost the lightsaber fight. That was canon before Disney, and is probably soft canon now. Obviously, he was dicking around afterward for Anakin's benefit, as he effortlessly wrecked Windu's shit with the Force moments later, but the actual saber-on-saber action clearly didn't go his way. You can kind of see on Ian McDiarmid's face during the fight that Palpatine is not doing as well as he wanted and it clearly pisses him off *hard*.

Of course, Palpatine would never admit something like that, so I won't do it in-character, but it's there, plain to see.

80,"There's a lot of *bizarre* misinformation, here.

First of all, the Jedi are many things, but ""peaceful"" they are not. They have functioned as generals and special forces for the last three years during the Separatist crisis, and before that, they operated as an autonomous paramilitary pseudo-police/judicial body for over a thousand generations. They are all highly-trained warriors with years of experience with their Order's signature weapon, the lightsaber.

I must be frank: it perplexes me deeply that anybody could confuse them with pacifists of any stripe.

As for the rest, the records are very clear. Holonet transmissions of the last meeting of the Jedi Council confirm a plot to overthrow the Republic before Master Windu's midnight raid on my office. Clone troops confirm Windu's flight plan to my office in a military transport along with three other Council members, armed with, again, the Order's signature weapon. Audio recordings of that confrontation have been analyzed and confirmed by experts, proving that the Jedi announced their intent to commit treason, activated their distinctive weapons, and attacked. 

As is their responsibility, my Red Guard engaged in a heated battle against the Jedi and prevailed. With confirmation that the Jedi had aligned themselves to treason, attempting to overthrow the Republic, I was duty-bound as Supreme Chancellor to enact Order 66, one of many contingency directives passed into law by the Senate (without bias, mind you. Order 65, for instance, outlines the removal of the Supreme Chancellor should I be shown to be guilty of treason or acting against the interests of the Republic).

With this, the second instance of high-level members of the Republic attempting to topple it and destroy our way of life, I placed before the Senate a new proposal to reorganize the Republic into the First Galactic Empire so that we may root out our enemies and restore peace. Our democracy has been poisoned from within and without, and must be suspended until the purity of the process can be reestablished.  It is with great reluctance that I have agreed to this calling.

That I got a monolithic sense of personal accomplishment and satisfaction from it is irrelevant: any man performing his proper duties as Chancellor in that position would be obligated to do the same.

And what's more, the Jedi had recourse outside of treason. If they had had any evidence that I was a threat to the Republic, Order 65 would have allowed them to petition the Senate and have me arrested. *Legally*. With a warrant, like people who respect the society they live in.

This suggests a very large ship or powerful hyperdrive is needed to actually impact the planet.

What this would mean is that if you're plunging the blade into, say, a blast door, the blade will radiate *much* more heat as it burns through, resulting in a larger hole. If you're slicing a dude's arm off, you just swiftly slice through because skin and bone don't offer as much resistance as two feet of durasteel.

220,"Lots of replies in here about a full-fledged war between both powers. That's not what the question asked, though.

So, first off, it depends on what ship. You specifically say that it is an Imperial *diplomatic* ship, so we can rule out superweapons, space stations, and the like. While Star Destroyers were sometimes used for intimidation tactics in diplomacy, most diplomats were ferried to their destinations in smaller shuttles or passenger liners. Often *unarmed* shuttles, even. Meanwhile, the Federation tends to send its diplomats aboard heavily-armed starships (which is a little odd for a civilization so based on peaceful conflict resolution), but post-TOS the most common dignitary transport appears to be the [Excelsior class](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Excelsior_class). So, we'll choose the [Lambda-class T-4a shuttle](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Lambda-class_T-4a_shuttle) and the [USS Hood](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/USS_Hood_\(Excelsior_class\)).

The second question is when? Obviously you mean for the Hood to encounter the Empire, so that gives us about 25 years of leeway. I will put it just before ESB, as that is the height of the Empire and useful for finding a suitable shuttle (most of the named Lambdas on Wookieepedia are *Rebel* shuttles, which is a hassle). You also mean for the Empire to meet the Federation, but we know the Federation lasts for at least 7 centuries, so that's less clear. We'll say we're exchanging ships post-Farpoint but pre-Dominion War. Sometime during TNG's run.

So, in a flash of light, the Hood is lost *en route* to Starbase following the delivery of Tam Elbrun to the Enterprise. In its place is the shuttle Nexus, carrying Grand Admiral Zaarin from a trip to Coruscant for strategic operations briefings with myself back to his research facilities.

__In *my* galaxy__:

Captain De Soto orders a full stop. The crew quickly surmise that they are in a foreign galaxy, and detect *massive* subspace distortions from nearly every populated star they can see, as ships enter and exit hyperspace. De Soto, somewhat of a glory hound, sets course for the nearest populated world before his science team has finished analyzing the strange transmissions that will eventually be understood to be the local holonet. He has plenty of time to learn how the holonet works on the nearly weeklong journey at the outdated ship's maximum warp. 

The Hood arrives in orbit over Christophsis, a lovely Imperial world. After determining how communications are managed in our galaxy, he begins talk with various government officials. Eventually, he learns the lay of the land and discovers that the center of the Empire, Coruscant, is *on the far side of the Galactic Core*! Traveling there by warp would take *decades*, but ships here can reach there in mere hours or days (depending on the hyperdrive rating). This is phenomenal information, and De Soto attempts to barter for a ship with a hyperdrive for his science teams.

Unfortunately, his queries, mannerisms, and transportation technology are swiftly recognized as foreign to the Empire. Officials signal these oddities and scans soon discover the Hood hiding behind Christophsis' moon. A small armade of Star Destroyers is dispatched, traffic around Christophsis is grounded, and the Hood is engaged. De Soto, having no idea what these new ships are capable of, jumps to warp. Technicians aboard the lead Star Destroyer are confused, recognizing that the ship has traveled faster than light, but not understanding the technology. However, the Federation ship leaves its characteristic light show and ion trail, revealing its exact heading. Micro-hyperspace jumps are calculated along that vector, and the Hood is quickly faced with the fleet again. 

De Soto plays this game of leap-frog with the fleet for a few hours until a new cruiser arrives with the fleet. The Interdictor generates a massive gravity well, preventing warp travel and forcing a confrontation. De Soto recognizes that neither surrender nor combat will fulfill the Prime Directive's mandate of non-interference, orders a self-destruct. The readouts from the explosion are an oddity to Zaarin's successor in Research, but the various heretofore unknown metals are interesting. Future iterations of the TIE craft find themselves somewhat better armored, leading to a greater survival rate. The lack of Zaarin's attempted coup leaves plenty of ships and materiel undamaged, which might allow for more efficient harassment of the terrorists' forces throughout the Empire. Whether that ultimately changes anything in the long run is debatable.

__In the Milky Way galaxy__:

Zaarin drops out of hyperspace in an unknown system, in an unknown galaxy. There is no holonet. There are no reinforcements. Guiding the ship to an inhabited planet nearby, he is hailed in an unknown way. The communications officer in the cockpit manages to decode the transmission and the shuttle requests landing permission (well, I say 'requests.' Demands are made in the name of the illustrious Grand Admiral Zaarin, personal consultant to the Emperor of the Galaxy himself, etc). Upon landing, Zaarin's crew is met by bemused Starfleet officers and treated as foreign dignitaries. Within minutes, Zaarin works out more or less what has happened to him, has used his tenuous diplomatic status to gain basic computer access, and begins harvesting the starport's computers for navigation charts, political details, and other reconnaissance, which he transfers to his shuttle.

Starfleet will very quickly attempt to figure out exactly where Zaarin comes from, and will be very confused about his answers. Unfortunately, they won't be able to talk for long. Zaarin will quickly stage a raid with his personal guards kidnapping several officers and commandeering a warp-enabled shuttlecraft from the docking bays. The Nexus and the shuttlecraft will flee into space, and after the Federation craft feeds data into the Nexus' navicomputer, they will both flee the system. Out in the interstellar void, the two ships dock. Zaarin is fascinated by the different technologies of this new universe. He spends several days using the shuttle to plot hyperspace microjumps to throw Federation search parties off his trail, and then using the shuttle's warp drive to extend a warp bubble around the Nexus when it becomes clear that the followers are easily able to detect the spatial distortions of hyperspace travel. This game of cat-and-mouse ends suddenly as a massive ship arrives, catching the bound shuttles in a tractor beam.

The ship, NCC 1701-D, was dispatched following the successful resolution of the Gomtuu incident to discover what had happened to the missing shuttle and whether it had anything to do with the disappearance of the USS Hood. Over comms as the shuttles are towed aboard, Zaarin's ambitions and prejudices are obvious and distasteful to Picard. He orders a security team to accompany him as he meets Zaarin. This team is wiped out by Zaarin's personal guard in a swift firefight. Picard is captured and Zaarin demands control of the Enterprise in exchange for his life. Picard refuses. Zaarin contacts the Bridge to demand the same of Riker. Riker refuses. Riker has Data disable the shuttle using its prefix code, allowing him to beam Picard to the Bridge and Zaarin's entire crew to the brig.

Intense study of the alien technology at the Daystrom Institute ensues, as well as a very peculiar debriefing of the extra-universal visitors. Eventually, Starfleet declares that as the visitors are humans in Federation space, they fall under Federation jurisdiction. They are tried and imprisoned for their crimes for several years until some crazed admiral or a Section 31 operative or a series of invading parasite worms or something releases them and they wreak havoc for a few days before being killed. Standard Federation villain stuff.

The blasters and other incidentals are fairly uninteresting to Starfleet, but the intense power generators and this new hyperspace technology are *deeply* interesting. By the time of the Dominion War, the Jem'Hadar find themselves wildly outmatched by Starfleet's suddenly impenetrable shields and ability to deploy ships to the Gamma Quadrant in months with only probe telemetry to map the way. Voyager returns home within three years, calculating small hyperjumps on the fly. Everything seems to be going great until quantum singularities begin opening across the galaxy. Without Voyager, the Borg have lost their war with Species 8472, and the invaders from fluidic space ravage their way across the galaxy. Starfleet fights a bitter war as all the Federation's allies and enemies are devastated. Ultimately, an embittered and war-weary Captain Harry Kim of the USS Tucker gives the order to release a nerve agent that poisons fluidic space itself. His genocide is reviled, and his name is forever spoken in the same breath as Hitler, Kodos the Executioner, or Colonel Green. He dies in prison, cold and alone.

Everybody worries that they won't meet their full potential. Doubt hounds every man in one way or another. But whenever I am unsure, thinking about settling for peace and quiet instead of doing what must be done for the galaxy, I look back at the great philosophers who tell us that peace is a lie, that it is only through victory over our doubts that our chains are broken. It is passion that drives us to succeed, and it is that passion that gives us strength.

Many good friends helped me get to where I am. Sadly, many of them have succumbed to the rigors of age or mysterious plasma burns while all security systems in their dwellings were disabled.

If the clones failed to deliver, the Senate was already on the verge of legalizing a volunteer army before hostilities even broke out, and we know I can make *that* work.

713,"That depends on a few things. In almost every gaming system, pallies have to be Lawful Good devotees to a deity or a code (those last three words are controversial), and lose their status as Paladins if they perform evil acts.

So, let's get the easy part over with:

&gt;Devotees

Oh, definitely. Kidnapped as babies and indoctrinated until their late teens or early twenties? They're all devoted child soldiers, for sure. The Jedi [have killed](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/First_Great_Schism) over members just trying to peacefully teach controversial things on distant planets. Check and double-check.

&gt;to a deity or a code

If we're being strict about a deity, the Force is...well, it depends on which batshit nuts version of the magical space god energy they believe in. Unlike the Sith Order's practical view that the Force is an energy field and energy fields aren't magic space people with wills and desires, most of the Jedi seem to think the Force has some kind of *plan* for them. That's sort of a deity. Arguable but probably check.

And if we're allowing for devotion to a code, they're in for sure. Check.

&gt;Lawful

This is a point of great contention for me. *I* contend that plotting to overthrow a galactic government that has stood for nearly 40,000 years with no evidence of foul play *before* reports even came in of *rumors* that the government was run by somebody whose religion you don't like is solid evidence that the Order is fundamentally not Lawful. A Lawful Jedi Council would have brought accusations of my religious beliefs before the Senate and urged for my removal from office. They would have acted in the light of day, rather than sending assassins to my office in the dead of night with no warrant and weapons drawn.

No check.

&gt;Good

I don't even know how somebody could *argue* that the Jedi are good. There are essentially three types of Jedi: Jedi who do nothing at all (True Neutral), Jedi who do awful, reprehensible things in an attempt to bring about a greater good (Chaotic Neutral, *leaning* on Chaotic Good), or Jedi who ""fall"" to the Dark Side and murder puppies (Evil). There is basically no example of a Jedi who does good in the service of Good. You basically only get Jedi who do *less blatant evil* in the service of Good.

No check.

I'll get pushback on this, for sure, but it's irrelevant, considering

&gt;lose their status as Paladins if they perform evil acts

Holy *shit* do the Jedi fail, here. Qui-gon cheats at dice while betting somebody else's ship in exchange for slaves, Kenobi stole his best friend's lightsaber and left him to die dismembered and screaming in agony *and on fire*, Yoda did basically nothing but lie to Luke (explicitly or implicitly) the entire time they knew each other...on and on.

No check.

So, in conclusion, no. The Jedi are not paladins. While clerics and monks are acceptable substitutes, there are also [Knights](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Knight,_Variant_\(3.5e_Class\)), [Shamans](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Shaman_\(3.5e_Class\)), and [Battle Mages](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Battle_Mage_\(3.5e_Class\)).",2016-06-11 04:24:24+00:00,d44kdby,1.0,t3_4niki9,24749.0,AskScienceFiction

As such, Anderson worked with Hambly to find a way to slowly write Ming out over the course of Darksaber, without killing off the character.

1066,"So, Leia is captured after loading secret information into a droid. Then Han, who has been living his entire life as a drone of the Empire, releases her and steals a ship. They crash on Tatooine, where they are separated. 

Han meets Luke, a desert urchin who pilots the Falcon away from an Imperial attack. In space, they are captured by Obi-Wan, who is hauling Sand People. Greedo and Jabba show up, and Han/Luke release the Sand People to save Obi-Wan. 

They flee in the Falcon to Yoda's palace on Dagobah, where Han tries to ditch the Rebellion before Vader attacks Dagobah and kidnaps Luke. Han and Obi-Wan fly to Yavin IV, where they meet Mon Mothma. With the Death Star plans, they prepare to destroy the station by infiltrating it so that Leia and the other fighter pilots can destroy the station. 

On the station, Obi-Wan is furious to discover that Han lied and only wants to rescue Luke. In a hilarious turn of events, Luke has already escaped from Vader's clutches after they had a heart-to-heart talk without Vader's mask on. After they meet up, Vader kills Obi-Wan, Chewie shuts down the shields, Leia does a trench run to destroy the station, and then there are two lightsaber fights: Vader kicks Han's ass, then Luke beats Vader.

1169,"Let me see.

Maul is defeated, leading to the same results for Naboo. Kenobi is ordered to complete the Trials, as he has not just proven himself by killing a Sith. Qui-Gon continues to train Anakin against the Council's wishes instead of giving Kenobi special counsel right before his Trials. Kenobi succeeds and is granted the rank of Knight. Qui-Gon interrupts the congratulatory celebrations to demand that he be allowed to train Skywalker. The Council agrees, and Kenobi understands, but he has to push aside a moment of jealousy.

Qui-Gon raises Anakin as a golden child. His achievements are well-known throughout the Order, and Kenobi is happy for him. Really. Honestly. Even when he overhears somebody call Skywalker ""the greatest Knight Master Qui-Gon has ever trained.""

Eventually, things play out more or less the same until Kenobi calls for Qui-Gon's assistance from Geonosis. Qui-Gon, busy consoling Anakin following his mother's death at the Lars farm, does not receive the message, and thus does not respond until after Kenobi is captured. Kenobi is forced to face the Geonosis arena alone, barely escaping with his life before Qui-Gon and Anakin burst in with Amidala in tow to save him. The events of that battle are more or less the same. Anakin makes a joke at Kenobi's expense for needing to be rescued, but Obi-Wan lets it go. The three go to fight Dooku, with Amidala coming along. Kenobi, trusting in Qui-Gon's command of the transport, manages to catch Padme, keeping her on the transport. The Jedi step off to fight Dooku, and she remains aboard. Anakin turns just in time to see [this still happen](https://youtu.be/XIY9-oru8pk?t=3m28s). He rushes Dooku in a rage and is brutally maimed. Kenobi moves forward, expecting Jinn to work with him to defeat Dooku, but the Master instead rushes to make sure Anakin is ok (as his survival is paramount. His defeat by the Sith would be disastrous!). Kenobi is roundly defeated, only managing to keep his limbs because Qui-Gon finally joins the fight. Dooku is quickly captured when Yoda arrives. Kenobi feels both pity for Anakin's wounds, but also a guilty streak of abandonment over Qui-Gon's actions during the fight.

Dooku, running under Plan B, sows distrust and discontent among the Council as they interrogate him. My agents, on the other hand, sow unease in the Senate over the Jedi taking enemy generals as prisoners of war, interrogating people in secret in their Temple, and refusing to share what they learn. I, of course, publicly express my full faith that the Jedi would never hide military secrets from the Senate, nor would they refuse to allow someone to face civil justice simply because that person was once a Jedi. They are not some sort of secretive cabal, after all! Kenobi, seeing my relationship with Anakin, is repulsed by me.

Dooku escapes in a very daring raid on Coruscant, led by General Grievous. In the process, Qui-Gon is killed. Kenobi is tasked with stopping him, but Anakin loses control and goes ahead on his own. They are separated. Dooku is discovered by Kenobi, who has been training and is his match. The lightsaber duel is thrilling, of course, but what matters is the seeds of doubt and jealousy Dooku places as they fight...meanwhile, Anakin comes upon a man in a black robe. A man who seems to feed upon and feed into all of his passions. A man who makes him feel like it's ok to grieve, for Qui-Gon. For Padme. For his mother. The man reinforces his fears about the Jedi Council. About their jealousy. About their complacence that led to Anakin losing everybody that he loves. He puts his arm on Skywalker's shoulder in comfort...and this is what Kenobi sees when a wild swing of his lightsaber activates a holoprojector. Dooku, in a rare moment of restraint, does not attack him during this opening. He feels the opportunity in the Force. He sees the naked suspicion of Anakin. The jealousy. The *guilt* over the jealousy. The seeds of hate.

""You see, Obi-Wan? Qui-Gon's death was no accident. The Sith Lord killed him *for Skywalker*. And Skywalker is there, *nodding* at his murderer.""

After urging from the handmaiden, he reluctantly talks to *literally any other merchant on the planet* and is able to make a deal for either a new ship, exchange of currency for Republic credits, hyperdrive parts, or discreet transport to Coruscant. As the party goes to leave Tatooine, they are attacked by a Marauder piloted by Maul (whose recon did not allow him to discover their location early enough for a ground offensive). Being already damaged and not designed for combat, the Nubian craft is forced down again, irreparable this time. Maul, being far too brash for his own good, does not kill them from the air like a sensible person, but rushes out to face them head-on. Thankfully, Qui-gon was maimed in the crash, and dies quickly during the fight. Kenobi manages to fight Maul to a stalemate before a wounded Amidala crawls from the wreckage and shoots him from behind. The two survivors barely manage to find their way back to Mos Espa before nightfall. Destitute and desperate, Kenobi poses as a full Jedi Knight, demanding passage. This quickly attracts the attention of Jabba the Hutt, who has the Padawan restrained and takes Amidala as a dancing girl. Unprepared and still exhausted mentally and physically, Kenobi's escape attempt is quickly defeated, and Jabba has him disposed of.

They didn't know that. If they had, I wouldn't use that argument in character so often.

The more I think about it, the more I think the Jedi are only Good Guys because Lucas said so. Qui-Gon basically mind-controls every character in TPM (except Watto, because he can't, so instead he uses the Force to cheat at dice, instead), and the movie paints it as being ok because Lucas said so. Sifo-Dias actually commissioned the clone army behind the Republic's back (he was later killed and replaced by Dooku, but he 100% started that process on his own). And, most importantly, Palps was at least partially trying to convince Anakin that the Jedi were going to try to overthrow the Republic...and they did. 

I'm 100% with my character in that: Windu and co. were there to kill Palpatine because they wanted to take over. Windu and Mundi were talking PR with that ""to ease the transition"" stuff. I wish the scene had given us more about how that meeting went, because as-is it's not clear if Yoda is trying to shut them down for being power-hungry or just saying they have to plan their coup really carefully.

Episode III made the Jedi seem *super* sketchy. They became a whole Order of generals, then they get all pissy at Anakin because the government wants to put some government oversight into their secret strategy meetings (Palpatine's secret motives notwithstanding)? They order a dude to perform espionage on the Chancellor? Then they're gonna start ""arresting"" people with lit lightsabers in the middle of the night?

You have conveniently left out that their religion became illegal after they attempted to assassinate me so that they could topple the legitimate government and replace it with a Jedi theocracy:

&gt;**Mace Windu**: I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The Dark Side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.  
&gt;**Ki-Adi-Mundi**: If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous, then he must be forcibly removed from office.

1408,"My veil of obfuscation falls away from the Force. The Jedi regain their senses and are *absolutely horrified* by what they see in the Force: corruption and temptation at every turn, the rise of emotion and passion in every being in the galaxy, agents of the Dark Side openly operating within the Senate, and torrents of visions from the future showing bloodshed and death. Many of them will, ironically, give in to their fear or outrage. Some will leave the Order. Some of those will join the Separatists. 

In the face of this, Windu will attempt to tighten the Council's grip on its Knights, forbidding further defections. He will likely find support from Billaba and Mundi, and stark opposition from the independent-minded Masters such as Secura and Shaak Ti. Yoda and Kenobi will attempt to smooth over such disputes, but I'm unconvinced that they will be able to prevent a schism on their own. It will come down to Skywalker: without guidance or control, will he choose a side in this debate? He certainly hates the yoke of Council control, but his simple-minded approach to allegiance may lead him to consider those who leave the Order to be traitors. He will fail to see Yoda's urgings of patience and compromise as viable.

Dooku...*sigh*. He *should* use this disarray to choose a new apprentice and seed discontent, pitting Jedi against Jedi. He *should* attempt to reinstate the shroud that muffled the Jedi's connection to the Force. He *should* let my death advance the Grand Plan. Will he? I doubt it. He'll probably convince himself that he should press the attack before the Jedi or the Republic recover from the news of my death, shaking the Jedi out of their reverie and giving them a target to project all their disagreements onto. He will be killed without an apprentice and the Sith will fall (for a time, at least). That is why he was never meant to stand on his own. Perhaps Maul will manage to keep his shit together.

The Senate will fall into disarray, Jedi schism or no. By this point, bureaucratic malaise was at its height. Even I was barely able to bring the Republic together for the war effort. Regardless of any military victories, the Republic will fall.

When he arrives on Coruscant, the Jedi Council flatly refuses to give him loads of material goods to abandon his commitment to Naboo and distract from his task with rooting out the Sith, just so he can go *buy a person*. They send him off to Naboo, where he is killed by Maul. The Naboo pilots are unlikely to destroy the Droid Control Ship on their own (as it is obvious that they only succeeded due to Anakin). This leads to a massive, bloody slaughter of Gungans, which is just great for everybody.

Unfortunately, killing Maul will not end the occupation, and was simply a bonus for the Jedi Order. The key to Amidala's plan was for the space battle to succeed, thus destroying the droid army. With the Viceroy as her prisoner, she must now attempt to intimidate him into signing a surrender. Whether he does or not is...honestly irrelevant to the greater story.

Kenobi, distraught and rebellious, is made a Jedi Knight by the Council, but is refused his request to requisition goods to buy somebody the Council has never met. In a fit of pique, he defies the Council and leaves to buy Anakin (note: in the regular timeline, he baldly proclaims that he will train Anakin whether the Council approves or not, so this is basically what he threatened Yoda with *anyway*). This catches my eye, and very soon Kenobi will find himself *graciously* offered sanctuary under the auspices of the Supreme Chancellor.

Then you're flat-out wrong. Military coups are no more legal or moral than religious coups. If you want to treat them as military officers, then they're not only guilty of treason, but also of a host of charges under military tribunal, but they're *still guilty of treason*.

Just imagine if, on your little backwater, a general in the military stormed the White House with a team of commandos, guns drawn, in an attempt to arrest your President without warrant or authorization from anybody.

1747,"&gt; The Jedi are not mistaken. Sidious arranged a war to destroy the Republic, kill billions (trillions?) of beings and destroy the Jedi.

None of which they knew, or even had strong evidence of. One Jedi had said that a Sith told him there was another Sith running the Republic, and *that* Jedi's apprentice said that Palpatine was a Sith. None of that even reasonably *suggests* that Palpatine rigged the war to destroy the Jedi.

&gt;You forget that, not only do the Jedi know this, they feel it. It's like having an extra eye that's always seeing a flashing red light

Except they didn't. Even in Phantom Menace, the Jedi were talking about how the Dark Side had so clouded things that they couldn't see a damn thing.

&gt;And who can they turn to? The Senate is compromised, the courts are too, with whoever Palpatine appoints.

Did they try? They didn't even call up Amidala or Organa, both *militantly* pro-Jedi Senators, to see if there might be support for some kind of move.

You know why? Because they didn't wait until the Senate knew the war was over before trying to kill Palps for not giving up his power at the end of the war. That's fucking *nuts*, man.

&gt;Also; you forget, Anakin doesn't give a shit about ""justice"".

That's reductionist and silly. Anakin is poorly-written, but he clearly wants Palpatine brought to justice. That's why he told Windu in the first place. If all he wanted was Padme, he'd have tried to talk Windu out of his blitz on Palpatine, not given him a heads-up on what to expect.

1767,"These answers are rife with Jedi propaganda, but let's examine the truth:

The Jedi view life as a weakness in the Force, instead of the Force as a strength of life. 

It runs through their entire philosophy. Everything they teach is about sublimating everything in your life in favor of an imaginary guiding power dictated to them by the Force. They ignore their instincts, their passions, their loves, their families, all so that they can ""commune with the Force.""

But that's not even true. They don't ignore their emotions; they deny that emotion as a concept is even worth acknowledging! It's the first line of their Code:

&gt;There is no emotion, there is peace.

The third line shows that, similarly, they don't merely ignore their passions, they spitefully reject them *en masse*:

&gt;There is no passion, there is serenity.

And all this is in service of what? Their ultimate goal, not to live forever or to help others or to bring order to the galaxy, but to escape life entirely, to leave us *mere mortals* behind and prance off into some mystical communion with the Force. It's there in the final line:

&gt;There is no death, there is the Force.

The Jedi don't value life. Far from it. They *despise* life. It is a temporary affliction to them, which they seek at all turns to cast off. Most of them are just too cowardly to eat their lightsabers and let the rest of us get on living, so they feel compelled to hang on, pressing their ideology on the rest of us.

And that's why they don't seek to create more of it by fostering families and immersing themselves in love, one of the most life-affirming emotions we know. It would be tormentous to them.

Being the rash, headstrong folk that they were, the Jedi would immediately attack me.

In public.

With no provocation.

And, of course, during the chaos, I would give Order 66, causing the thousands of parading heroes to turn on the Jedi, cutting them down as they tried to attack me behind my cunningly ray-shielded parade float.

2127,"&gt; After the opening scene do the events of Episode IV basically take place over the course of a day (from Luke with Ben to destroying Death Star)?

Days. Hyperspace travel time is generally fairly substantive, though glossed over in dramatic renditions.

&gt;   Why did Jabba still want Solo even though Solo clearly had money to pay the bounty after saving Leia at the end of IV?

He says exactly why: It's not about the money, anymore. He can't just screw Jabba, kill one of his bounty hunters, disrespect him by promising prompt payment, run off for a few years, then suddenly show up with some credits and expect everything to be fine. He's disrespected Jabba in a fairly public way, and criminals feel disrespect as keenly as they feel financial misfortune.  

&gt;  Probably a popular one: why did Kenobi sacrifice himself/why didn't Vader pursue Luke et all when they were fleeing?

Kenobi was manipulating Skywalker into killing his own father. He first lied about his father's fate (Vader murdered your father), then deliberately arranged his own death to maximally wound Skywalker while also making him blame Vader. It was a sick game of getting a kid to unknowingly murder his own family.

As to why Vader didn't give chase, that's also stated: Tarkin released the terrorists with a tracker on the ship so that they could follow them to the terrorist base on Yavin.

&gt;    Where did Vader go after the Death Star blew up, they mention that Tie Fighters cant travel far, did he just radio in a local Star Destroyer?

Quite so. He [called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F1d3QWsyk0) for help.

&gt;    What does Vader do in his little throne that makes an appearance in Episode V when his mask is being put on? Why would he just sit in there with it closed?

It was a place of meditation and controlled atmosphere where he could take off that mask without his skin screaming in agony. It also let him fish bits of feeding pellets out of his little autotuner mouthpiece.

&gt;    Why do people like C3P0 but hate Jar Jar, on a rewatch as an adult 3P0 is just as damn annoying and unnecessary with his damn odds and doom and gloom attitude the whole time

What there *is*, is a lifetime of indoctrination into a cult that teaches you never to confront your emotions. Never to feel too deeply. Certainly, never to learn how to deal with your emotions in a healthy way or to use your emotions to grow as a person. So, what you get is a bunch of emotionally stunted people wandering around play-acting at wisdom because they're not clouded by the *eeeeevil* darkness that comes from *being an adult*.

2252,"Well, let's look at some of the mistakes here.

First, Luke *did* fall. He struck out in anger at me, exactly as I predicted he would. He also completely lost his shit at Vader when his sister was mentioned. You can review the footage yourself. He is 100% engulfed in his rage, even after Vader surrendered. I'll admit that I should have kept my mouth shut a few seconds longer, so he couldn't externalize his emotions and retreat into his Jedi shell, but that he fled from it doesn't mean it wasn't there.

Second, Luke stood no chance of defeating me. He had no idea that my Lightning was even a thing, much less that a lightsaber could block it. He barely knew which end of the lightsaber was the dangerous one. Were it not for his father's treachery, he would have died, screaming, on the floor whether he let Vader live or not. I was never in any danger from Luke.

Third, Jedi are not normal people. They don't deal with their emotions, and they're taught that feeling them is wrong. They're taught that once you feel an emotion to strongly, you're literally irredeemable forever. That's why Vader went from arguing for arresting me because killing wasn't the Jedi way to slaughtering children over the course of twenty minutes. If you're convinced that any failure is absolute failure, you can't *deal* with failure. Luke was trained by Yoda, who was one of the most outspoken mouthpieces for this belief for nearly a thousand years. It's been the primary way that Sith recruit Jedi for ages. Many Sith writings actively mock this idea, and there's actually lots of ideological debate in the holocrons over whether using acolytes poisoned by Jedi teachings weakens the Order more than it benefits us. Obviously, since my apprentices are never meant to become full Sith anyway, I consider it a moot point.

Ultimately, though, OP is right in that Luke was not a full Jedi, following the full Jedi mythology. He believed in redemption, which ultimately would have proven a problem, and I would have been forced to kill him and recruit his sister, instead.",2015-10-18 22:01:51+00:00,cw4g9u8,2.0,t1_cw11stu,265184.0,AskScienceFiction

Sith philosophy is heavily based on self-reliance and overcoming adversity. Healing others robs them of their chance to overcome their injuries. Healing one's own injuries is fine, and some Sith do so, though many consider that to be a way to skip adversity rather than to overcome it. Others feel that pain can be used to enhance their power, and thus consider healing to make them weak. Since some Sith have [more or less conquered death](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Darth_Sion) through an extreme application of that idea, it's hard to argue with them.

Others, like myself, keep injuries that are useful to them. My facial scarring would be easy to repair, but doing so would keep my very face from reminding people why the Jedi cannot be trusted.

Not to drop into character or anything, but the longer I spend trying to justify away Palpatine's actions the way Palpatine might, the more it seems like (with a certain amount of leeway) the Sith philosophy is actually pretty serviceable as a way to approach real life: embrace that things change. Embrace that you have emotions. Control your emotional responses to aim them at a goal, rather than just pretending they aren't there and hoping that's enough to get rid of them. In a world where having feelings doesn't turn your eyes gold and make you a horrible baby-killing monster just because you *felt* too hard, the Sith philosophy is actually pretty reasonable.

Granted, the murder-your-parents-to-gain-their-power part is a bridge too far, but hopefully not having a laser sword will temper your approach enough to get rid of *that*.",2015-10-10 08:53:57+00:00,cvun0cx,11.0,t1_cvumx16,456.0,StarWars

In actuality, the Force is motivated by your will. Can an edge of fear, or even absolute panic, fortify your will for a while? Of course, and so the Force can be used through your fear. However, as with most things that you do while afraid, your use of the Force will be reckless and likely pretty unreliable. Constant terror, of course, erodes the will, and thus is a self-defeating path (it also indicates that you're not facing the adversities that have inspired the fear, which inevitably leads to stagnation and decay anyway).

Really, though, the only emotion that will prevent you from effectively using the Force is the one the Jedi hold most dear: apathy. Oh, sure, they couch it in terms of peace and serenity, but it's always the same: don't mourn the dead. Don't get attached. Don't love. Don't fear. Just sit in this dark room and meditate until we tell you to do something else. Don't *feel*. Feeling is the *Dark Side*, and it'll make you into a monster. Disobedience is *feeling*.

This one is a Super Star Destroyer with a Death Star superlaser!) surrounded by *another* evil Jedi or Sith (this one's a clone of C'Baoth! This one's a clone of Palpatine! This one's *another* clone of Palpatine! This one's the founder of a new Sith Order! This one's the founder of a new new Sith Order!).

Yeah, great. I'm sure sad we lost all that creativity and now it's all stuff we've seen before, like what looks like a stormtrooper dealing with the horrors of war. *That* old song and dance.

&gt;Also, the merchandise has been majorly shitty since Disney took over. Cheaply made and expensive. I don't know how many times I've gotten excited over something, like ""ooooh, a R2-D2 trash can!"" only to find out it's flimsy shitty plastic, costs 15 dollars and would probably break in a week if actually used.

(Spoilers, obviously)

&gt;The Terminator

The first half-hour of the movie is a suspenseful building action, where people appear out of nowhere and start killing, stealing, and stalking. You don't know what's going on, or why. Then BAM! Come with me if you want to live! Exposition! Action! Yay!

The trailer...spoils all of that by telling you the entire plot before you start.

&gt;T2: Judgment Day

The twist was that Arnold was sent to protect John, not kill him. Guess what the trailer revealed?

&gt;T3

This one is the exception, because there was nothing to spoil. There was no twist or, really, much of any plot. 2 Terminators, 1 cup.

&gt;Terminator: Salvation

The twist was that Marcus was a Terminator. Half of the trailer was *just the reveal*.

There *is* no Dark Side. It's a Jedi myth that simply represents the use of the Force through concentration of willpower and passion, rather than the hippie-dippie ""commune with the Force"" stuff the Jedi teach. The Force has no will. It has no mind. It is literally just an energy field.

Sure, many Sith have done terrible things. So have many Jedi. So have many people with no connection to the Force at all. It is simply another tool, and like any tool, it can be used for any number of purposes, some more sinister than others. Hydrospanners can be used to beat men to death and durasteel made the construction of the Death Star possible, but that doesn't mean there's a Light and Dark Side to metal, nor that socket wrenches have a will that you must search your feelings to understand.

That's the official line, sure, but the Initiative ended up having mandatory service and the punishment for disagreement was having your mind wiped and *then* mandatory service.

Fuck your gun registration parallel, man. If we erased people's identities and forced them to become thought-slaves in the army for disagreeing with gun control, I'd oppose it, too.

Nevermind that he was attacked by SHIELD before the law even passed for disapproving of it, and had to go on the run because of that. Nevermind that he's talking to Spiderman, there, who *mentions that he's having doubts* and then Tony tries to *fucking murder him*. Oh, yeah, that's just standard gun registration, man. Nevermind the fact that these people aren't just going to a store and buying superpowers; many of them are *born* that way. There's a reason the mutants didn't approve of this bullshit: it's exactly the pseudoracist bullshit it was when we called it Mutant Registration.

3194,"There's a lot going on, here.

Perhaps the most relevant answer to your question is my apprentice, Darth Vader. He was a Jedi who fell to the Dark Side, joined the Sith, ""redeemed"" himself, and Returned to the Jedi. I'm certain you're aware of that story.

Another instructive case is [Darth Vectivus](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Darth_Vectivus#Personality_and_traits), a man who joined the Sith, but never ""fell"" to the Dark Side. He simply adopted our philosophy, lived his life, made a holocron, and died. He was no more or less cruel as a Sith than he had been before he joined (though it's worth mentioning that he was known to be ruthless beforehand).

Yet another variation is (the first) [Darth Traya](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Darth_Traya). Her past is unclear, but she's believed to be Arren Kae, a Jedi who fell to the Dark Side, founded a splinter group of the Sith (it happens), and arguably drew herself back out of the Dark and into a grey sort of middle-ground (or perhaps she was just fooling herself. It's hard to say). She also arguably either forsook the Sith teachings or expanded and refined them, depending on who you're asking.

A curious example is [Darth Gravid](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Darth_Gravid). Late in life, he went insane and tried to embrace the Light, seeking to combine the Sith and Jedi teachings into one. It's not perfectly clear whether his madness was caused by trying to combine the two, his madness is what pushed him to try in the first place, or even if he simply endeavored to join the two and (through the unrelated, yet tragic whims of aging) went insane before he could finish.",2015-08-20 19:07:01+00:00,cu9sqsb,1.0,t3_3hq3g6,15545.0,AskScienceFiction

3411,"There used to be a joke that said ""Nobody in comics stays dead except X,"" and over the years, X has been several people: Uncle Ben, Barry Allen, Bruce Wayne's parents, and Jason Todd were common choices at different times. I haven't heard that joke in a while, mostly because I don't think there are any good choices left.

Uncle Ben and the Waynes are the only ones that is currently dead, out of that group, though Ben was cloned (and then immediately re-killed) in a Deadpool comic, so people tend to shy away from saying he's dead permanently. People also shy away from the Waynes, since both of them were alive and kicking during the recent Flashpoint event.

Barry Allen stayed dead for 23 years between Crisis on Infinite Earths and Final Crisis (though, because of there being so much time travel in the Flash books, he did appear several times. It's weird). Jason Todd stayed dead 17 years from '88 to '05 before Superboy Prime punched reality so hard it started to break and Todd was revived. 

The only ones I can think of who aren't really obscure (like the male Dove, who refused to come back even for Blackest Night) are people for whom being dead is *their thing* (like Deadman, who is...well...dead. That's his thing). Or their universe ended.

3420,"Moving things with the Force and, really, using the Force at all, is an exercise of the will. It happens in the mind of the Force user, and is limited by that same mind. As far as anybody has been able to determine, there is nothing *physical* that prevents a Force user from moving any object, but if you're convinced that object can't be moved, it can't.

This is why initiates have so much trouble moving anything, but quickly progress into moving all manner of smaller objects. They then run into mental boundaries at what they consider to be physical boundaries: I couldn't physically lift that, so it must be hard or impossible to lift with the Force. It would take an atmospheric lifter to move that, so it must be hard or impossible to lift with the Force. Nothing is so strong that it can physically pick up and move a star, so it must be hard or impossible to move with the Force. On and on.

It isn't just a matter of knowing something is possible, either. You can consciously realize it's possible and still believe on a subconscious level that it can't be done (many people feel this way about things like World Peace or quitting Reddit), and that will stop you dead in your tracks. There's also a component of the will: all Force use is the exertion of your will on reality. If your will is too passive or too weak, you will find nothing but boundaries in your life, both in the Force and in all other things. You must be strong, and seek to become stronger, or you are doomed to fall short of your ambitions.",2015-08-05 14:09:40+00:00,ctsazcv,1.0,t3_3fu0q7,37798.0,AskScienceFiction

The main problems faced by the galaxy during the invasion were lack of political unity, weak military strength, and the inability to prevent the Vong from terraforming their way through our space.

Still, the terrorists' ""New Republic"" did substantially better than the Old Republic would have done had I never taken power, and that's largely due to my influence.

I'm not. You're trying to pretend that they had constitutional executive authority that they did not have.

The authority you're talking about belongs to the Senate, not the Jedi.

&gt;The Republic gave them the authority to lead it's armies, arbitrate it's courts, negotiate and act as diplomats in it's name.

Funny. I don't see warrantless arrests or violent coups on that list at all...

&gt;Or are you saying that, because of your rank, you are somehow free from scrutiny or transparency?

I'm saying that because of my rank, there are specific protocols for initiating legal actions against me. Again, if an ambassador stormed the White House with an assault rifle to arrest the President when no charges had been brought against him, he would be shot and labelled a traitor. He does not have the authority to do that. Neither do the Jedi. It doesn't matter how much you talk them up; They were not a branch of government. They had no right to attempt to overthrow the entire galaxy's leadership on a fucking whim or hunch. That's not how civil society works.

&gt; Are you arguing in favor of systematic corruption and that you are somehow above the law? 

Are you arguing in favor of a theocratic rule by a cult that refuses government oversight and seizes power through illegally murdering the democratically elected leader of the Republic?

A DC policeman cannot draw his weapon and burst into the Oval Office, unannounced, saying something about arresting the President. Even if he could survive such an attempt, the arrest would be illegal without a warrant, and such a warrant would be illegally issued without a vote in the Senate. It is the same in the Republic.

I don't understand why people think this kind of commando vigilantism is morally and legally correct, especially (and I cannot stress this enough) when Master Windu *himself* said before the Jedi Council that his intent was to overthrow the Republic government and seize control of the Senate.

&gt;They couldn't have legally held you for long if there was truly no evidence or case against you.

Washington spent a lot of time fighting in the cold, and would respect the Starks for their self-reliance and fair-minded approach to governance. He would start in Winterfell and immediately pledge himself and his men to Ned (despite all the Revolutionary War stuff, he worked fine as an officer in the King's army for decades beforehand) or Robb (INDEPENDENCE, YOU SAY?), depending on how far along things are. Certainly, even 35 men with muskets will be a fantastic boon to the North's cause, as will any cannon that they bring.

Temujin is a horse lord.

With any luck at all, he will soon unite all the tribes and it is a bad, bad time to be living in Qarth, Yunkai, Meereen, or pretty much anything on that continent. He won't abolish slavery, but...well, in the real world, without magic or anything, there are accounts out of China that mention ankle-deep currents of blood and fat from the slain running through the streets.

However, they weigh quite a bit and have been known to develop odd quirks and combative personalities, which requires lots and lots of maintenance to keep in check.

TIE fighters are not equipped with a hyperdrive, as they're meant to be short-range fighter support craft for carriers (such as the Star Destroyer) rather than independent, long-range craft.

Your entire argument has hinged on that exploration being that they accept the Jedi philosophy and join the Order. Otherwise, there will *be* no Vulcan Jedi.

&gt;If the Jedi truly believe in their light side ways, then they would have no problem with another group of force sensitives exploring them.

Then you know nothing of the Jedi. They have been known to resort to kidnapping and slave trading to bring Force sensitives into the Order, and much worse to keep other Force traditions from gaining power. The Jedi believe they are the only way to explore the Force, and they keep their secrets even from one another.

* About half of your screenshots for everybody in the Matrix being white are from the Woman in the Red Dress program in the first movie. Those aren't people in the Matrix. Mouse made that program.

* The Oracle isn't white, so you'll have to address that. She's clearly a part of the Machines' power structure, so that kind of hampers your bit about only white men being in charge.

* Several of the main characters who are not white are people from the Matrix. Morpheus and Niobe, for instance. Were they white while they were slaves in the Matrix? ...Actually, that would be a *great* headcanon: the Machines just make everybody in the Matrix white because they don't care, and it's only the people who have woken up and seen their actual skin that ever show up in the Matrix as anything else! Well, except the programs, obviously, who can be whatever. Maybe the Architect just slaps a white skin on humans (and himself) because race is just a weird thing about humans he doesn't get, like love or realistic dialogue.

* Here's the weird one: if all the people in the Matrix are white, then the movie is about white people being slaves, and apparently being rescued from slavery by shitloads of underground raving Brazilians.

I look forward to seeing what kinds of things Reddit can pull from all this.

4268,"&gt;Rise Of The Machines expresses the idea of Judgment Day being inevitable

Note: This isn't some metaphysical truth being stated by the writers, but the opinion of one cyborg three hours before the bombs fall. Skynet had control of half of the US military and all of the civilian Internet, and the military turned to Brewster's pet AI project because they realized they were about to lose nuclear launch control.

Judgment Day is inevitable because it is *already happening* during that movie. It just wasn't to the flashy parts, yet.

As to the rest, [this does a pretty good job of showing what's happened so far](http://i.imgur.com/d567c3k.jpg). We know Judgment Day's still in the works, though, because of the end-credits scene and the fact that they're making more movies.

The third movie goes one better, and suggests that the night before T2, John made out with Kate and would have met her father and become a military kid that way had the T-1000 not busted in. Further, it hints that John and Kate would have hooked up in the Vet's office had the T-X not busted in. This suggests that in all these timelines, John meets Kate, joins and/or forms the Resistance, and defeats Skynet (which sends an increasing number of terminators back in time, hoping that it can cripple the Resistance and undo the fact that it's losing the war).",2015-06-25 14:33:46+00:00,csi9292,1.0,t3_3auowg,161994.0,FanTheories

Christ, are you my landlady? She rants up and down about how new appliances are programmed to crash and break forever after two years because they have motherboards and she never buys anything with a motherboard because she hates motherboards.

Which is why we have a bunch of crappy appliances that haven't worked right in a decade or more, but which will keep right on not working right *forever*, damnit! So what if there's standing water in the dishwasher or the clothes dryer takes 4 cycles to dry clothes, and sometimes stains or rips clothes?

...said the guy advocating the violent murder of a democratically elected leader because he doesn't approve of the democratic process that elected that leader...

&gt;if your beliefs are added to the fuel you use to take out an Order of people with beliefs that YOU don't like, don't expect me to condone said beliefs.

I can say *literally* the same thing about the Jedi attempts on my life, and the numerous attempts by the Jedi to exterminate the Sith in the past. You're trying to separate the two, and failing.

&gt;And I don't see how you are right in what you did.

This isn't what we're arguing. You've tried to push off on this tangent several times, but this isn't about whether I'm right and wonderful, but entirely about whether the Jedi are any different. They're not. You've pretty soundly proven it.

&gt;I have yet to understand why you believe you deserve to be the ruler of a galaxy

Deserve had nothing to do with it. The Yuuzhan Vong were coming, and without a militarized galaxy full of experienced veterans and powerful gunboats, we stood no chance. You think I built a planet-destroying weapon for shits and giggles? The invaders' entire plan is built around bringing next to no supplies and terraforming planets *into* supply depots here. Once their terraforming ships reached a world and started crapping out toxic gases, the Death Star would ride in, destroy the world and their terraformers, and leave. They would be utterly destroyed, and we would be victorious.

As it is, the Jedi and their terrorist friends destroyed my Death Star, collapsed the strong central leadership, killed loads of my soldiers, and failed to remain industrialized or united. When the Vong arrived, they found a scattered, weak galaxy full of bickering factions with outdated ships and no Death Star. The end of the war was a *truce* where entire planets, including *Coruscant* were completely ceded to the invaders.

Most Sith, on the other hand, side with the pragmatic Jedi, but since the Dark Side is a tool for us, not a boogeyman, ""positive"" emotions just seem irrelevant to our usage of the Force. They can be good for helping to turn others, but to you, yourself, being in love or not is just...being in love or not. It's not a Force-based concern.

5152,"The Reliant was no match for the Enterprise in a fair fight. Had the shields been raised, the fight would have ended with the Reliant too battered to fight. At that point, one of a few things might have happened, depending on how much sense Joachim could talk into his master and friend.

Worst-case scenario: Joachim is killed in an explosion. Khan orders ramming speed. The Enterprise is still in good shape, but these ships are *not* designed for that. Most likely, both ships go down with all hands. The Genesis scientists are eventually rescued weeks later. The Reliant crew survivors (if any, and if rescued) tell Starfleet about Khan, and history notes this sad chapter's close. The whale probe destroys humanity. With nobody to solidify the Federation in the 24^th century, the Borg conquer the Alpha Quadrant, and then the galaxy. Sad times are had by all, followed by times where emotional states are irrelevant.

Best case scenario: Khan is killed in an explosion. Joachim surrenders. The crew, beaten and lost out of time, are tried and shown mercy. Some are rehabilitated, and show the Federation that genetic engineering isn't all bad. The embryos in Cold Station 12 are thawed and allowed to grow into healthy members of the Federation. Kirk and crew stay on at the Genesis Cave to get them back on their feet for a few days, and are not at Earth when the whale probe arrives. They go back in time in a functioning Enterprise and beam whales aboard. The Federation is stronger physically and morally by Next Gen. Humanity explores space without and their genes within, growing in every direction. The Borg are no match for this Federation. The Dominion sure as fuck isn't.

More likely scenario: Urged by his faithful companion, Khan orders a retreat. Kirk, wanting to know what the *hell* is going on before going further, proceeds to Regula I, and discovers the Genesis Cave, Chekov, etc. Without Khan to talk to, Chekov and Tyrell go insane and start shooting before they die. Since neither is willing to fire on Kirk, the Doctors Marcus are likely targets, as is Saavik. A grieving Kirk beams Genesis to the Enterprise. Khan attempts to strike the Enterprise while they're distracted. Kirk destroys the Reliant and returns to Earth Spacedock. After debrief, the Enterprise is sent to oversee scrapping of Regula I, where they can stop the whale probe as before.

&gt;Mace Windu: It will be tricky. The Jedi Council will have to take control of the Senate to ensure a peaceful transition to a new goverment and a new leadership for the Republic. 

Don't be fooled by the attempts to justify it away. This is blatantly two Masters talking about killing me and installing themselves as rulers of the Republic in my place.
