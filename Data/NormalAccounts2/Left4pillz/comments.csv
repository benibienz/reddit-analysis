127,"This is one of the reasons I don't generally buy multiplayer VR games, seeing as they often tend to lose the playerbase after a few weeks once the hype dies down. Same thing has happened for Hover Junkers, Battle Dome, and Out Of Ammo which all usually have around 5 players max when I look on the Viveplayers site, so people like me will be more careful when buying multiplayer games to see if they actually have enough longevity to be worth the usually pretty high price (Like Raw Data at a normal price of £30, one of the most expensive VR games to date, though Raw Data also has a singleplayer mode which helps to keep it alive).",2016-10-17 11:40:14+00:00,d8vkqfe,1.0,t3_57uci4,43131.0,Vive

Also something that might help to increase immersion for free is the mod that adds all the real logos to ETS2/ATS as well as fake billboard ads for places like McDonalds and Coca Cola, just makes the world feel a little more realistic.

The simple bare necessities

Forget about your worries and your strife

I mean the bare necessities

Old Mother Nature's recipes

That brings the bare necessities of life

Wherever I wander, wherever I roam

I couldn't be fonder of my big home

The bees are buzzin' in the tree

To make some honey just for me

When you look under the rocks and plants

And take a glance at the fancy ants

Then maybe try a few

The bare necessities of life will come to you

They'll come to you!

Look for the bare necessities

The simple bare necessities

Forget about your worries and your strife

I mean the bare necessities

With just the bare necessities of life

And you prick a raw paw

Next time beware

Don't pick the prickly pear by the paw

When you pick a pear

Try to use the claw

But you don't need to use the claw

When you pick a pear of the big pawpaw

Have I given you a clue?

The bare necessities of life will come to you

They'll come to you!

Fall apart in my backyard

'Cause let me tell you something little britches

If you act like that bee acts, uh uh

You're working too hard

And don't spend your time lookin' around

For something you want that can't be found

When you find out you can live without it

And go along not thinkin' about it

You just need to right click it on steam and go to properties, uncheck 'Use desktop game theatre', click on Set Launch Options and type in -vr into the box.

Once you've done that, go into SteamVR settings when it's running and click disable direct mode and wait for it to restart SteamVR, then just launch the game and you should be good to go (You can use the menu in VR and i'd recommend turning the graphics down a lot, even on a 1080 I still get the occasional bit of lag on low settings.)

I strongly recommend making an autoexec.cfg file with the following lines:

&gt;vr_translation_limit 100

&gt;bind b vr_reset_home_pos

Then placing that file into C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\cfg, as it allows you to move as much as you want IRL and allows for you to reset the seated position using B (Or any key you want to set it to, B was just an unused key for my game).

Will try it out in HL2 later on and report back for the 1080, which might give a little insight as to how well it may run on a 1070 if you lower the settings.

**Edit:** Just tried it out and it's a pain in the ass to say the least, basically there's two compromises:

1: Play with screen tearing (Disable V-sync) and have perfect tracking.

2: Play without screen tearing (Enable V-sync) and have delayed tracking.

So basically to answer your question, yes you can probably maintain 90fps in game but you're likely gonna have one of those issues, even if you set your monitor to 90hz and set the launch options to run the game at 90fps.

Putting it into a little context, imagine if you bought a game but had to buy an LG monitor to play it, then another game comes out and you need to buy an AOC monitor to play that, but someone found a way to make it work with all monitors but the companies actively try to break support meaning that you won't be guarunteed to be able to play the game.

Even still i've had similar things when demoing the Vive with The Lab and having people smash the controllers into the wall (Luckily they're fine), and even with the Rift DK2 back in the day when demoing ETS2, i'd have some people go nuts with the G29 wheel and shake everything on the desk like there was an earthquake. People just don't seem to understand the safety rules of VR the first time round, so generally I hope to rarely have to demo it to others even though at the same time I want them to be able to experience it.

Last note the best people to demo it to are elderly people, my grandad and nan both demoed it and never came close to hitting the walls as elderly people generally don't do loads of rapid hazardous movements and tend to be a little more cautious, which is really good when dealing with expensive equipment like this.",2016-05-09 14:54:22+00:00,d2ymv14,1.0,t3_4ihsbi,41856.0,Vive

That's about it though, the price is gonna be near enough exactly the same when you buy motion controllers (Maybe more expensive if you factor in separate shipping costs), they both have the exact same resolution and refresh rate, and they both apparently have the same sort of ergonomics with the back head strap balancing out the weight on both headsets.

Note that you will need to downgrade your Nvidia drivers if you're using an Nvidia card, not too sure about the AMD drivers but i'd assume that it could be the same situation.

All you need to do is get the earliest version of SteamVR from the betas tab, restart Steam, then ensure HL2 has beta enabled in the Betas tab, ensure that you DON'T run SteamVR, and then launch the game. Enable 'Virtual Reality Mode' in HL2 video options, then restart the game and click 'Activate Virtual Reality' with the Rift on and set to extended mode, and you're good to go.

Alternatively you could follow the Virtual Desktop method of running it like jdvbelle said if you want to stick to the 0.8 runtime, which is good for if you plan on playing games like ETS2, Elite Dangerous, etc and don't want to keep switching back and forth. Hope all this helps :)

The Rift is great for people who want a more affordable VR experience whilst sitting down or standing in place as it won't be bundled with motion controllers or full room tracking; and the Vive is great for those who like to move around and can afford the heftier price tag that will most likely come with it seeing as it has motion controllers bundled with it and full room tracking. 

Whichever headsets people buy it will be good for VR consumers as there will be more content available for different types of experiences, I just hope there aren't too many exclusive games brought to either headset that could split the community in two.

For optimisation purposes i'd suggest making a copy of the project and optimise it to run at 90fps in the current DK2 (Though there will be some graphics problems) as you'll definitely need to be hitting that for CV1. Obviously you should keep the optimised 75fps version for the current DK2, but it won't be any good for the CV1 as there would be some pretty bad judder, especially with the decrease in performance with the higher resolution of the CV1.

- You no longer have infinite body bags. Instead you can have up to 3 using skills, and as standard you have 1 body bag at level 0.

- Dominating guards no longer disables their pager, so there's no point in spending points on the domination skill for your stealth build.

- Most heists on the hardest difficulty have too many guards to take down as you can only answer 4 pagers, and can't dominate guards to disable their pagers.

- Some heists now call in an extra security guard once you kill 4 guards (E.g. Framing Frame Day 1 and 3.)

- There are various minor adjustments to individual heists making them a tiny bit harder (E.g. Four Stores has moved the ATM to stop you from hiding behind it.)

All things considered though, there are now new skills and perks to help make stealthing a little easier and most are free (Real money I mean, you still need to pay in game money and points). The best new ones in my opinion are the Sixth Sense skill in the Fugitive skill tree which allows you to grab items in casing mode, and the ambidexterity perk in the Hitman perk deck which allows you to dual wield handguns (For better concealment, and so you don't waste skill points in the fugitive higher tier skills that don't help in stealth.)

Giving trans people rights is a similar sort of evil to what it would be in that situation, where we don't actually help them out at all, we just tell them that they're fine and leave them to continue living their lives believing that they're someone they're not.
