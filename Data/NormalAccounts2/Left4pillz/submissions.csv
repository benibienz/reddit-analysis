Now, I don't know what the deal is with printers or why they fucking hate me so much, maybe I insulted the printer's mother at some point, but I have broken brand new printers just by touching them. That's it. Just by touching them at it happens every. single. damn. time I try to use the printer at home. My mom can plug in a printer and it works just fine, my sister, my dad uses it and nothing happens. But these things smell fear, I'm telling you. The moment I approach the printer everything decides to fail at once. I honestly have no idea what it is, it's like a curse and then we have no choice but to get a new printer every time I use the one at home. I cannot tell you how many printers we have gone through, but I remember one night I just snapped. I had to do a project on short notice (teacher's fault, otherwise I definitely would've done everything to avoid using the home printer). It was like around midnight and I had to have it printed for tomorrow first period. Guess what? The printer breaks and so do I. The next 30min - an hour was my mom having woke up and trying to calm me down because I have no fucking idea what happened but I was screaming and crying and shit like printers are fucking evil man like I really don't understand why every time I even touch our printer it magically breaks. Literally anywhere other than home, like at school or a library I can use the printer and not have to worry. But at home or at a friend's house I will be in raving fear lest I accidentally brush up against a printer because God knows I may have activated a fucking Decepticon with my all-spark genes or some shit and it'll come to life at night and murder my family, and my grade.

But I was wondering if it would be possible to get the Touch controllers and Touch tracking camera working with the DK2 seeing as it will all presumably run on the same SDK. I know it's a little far fetched to assume something like this, but i'm not getting the CV1 so I wanted to know if I could just get the controllers when they come out instead if enough good content is made exclusively for them and not made for the Vive. Thanks if anyone can help me out :)",oculus,Does anyone know if the Touch controllers may be compatible with the DK2?,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/4136h0/does_anyone_know_if_the_touch_controllers_may_be/

Note that this doesn't happen in any other game or demo even with the wheel plugged in, so I don't think it has anything to do with the Rift or wheel being plugged in.

Edit: On low settings with most things disabled and the refresh rate set to ""default"", it works okay but the graphics aren't great and it kinda ruins the immersion.

(Just to note, i'm using the Oculus 0.6.0.1 runtime and SDK, so the new Oculus updates aren't the problem as i'm not using them anymore due to lack of supported games.)

I have a friend who had the same problem and after telling him to revert his display driver, the problems stopped for him too, so it's not just me. 

Hopefully this helps some of you who might be experiencing this problem. Also leave a comment if you have the 355.82 drivers and everything is still working fine for you, I highly doubt it's a coincidence that both me and my friend have the same issue with the same solution.

Edit: I now have the 355.84 beta drivers and it's fixed everything except the standard Oculus Demo Scene, which isn't that important anyway. Thanks for the help guys!
