28,I was where you are right now. Before I got my DK2 I made my own hmd and I was surprised how good it looked and felt. But after I got my DK2 my mind changed immediately. Now I wouldn't even compare these two. With the google cardboard you have 60fps at max and with no low-persistense which makes a huge difference. Also the lenses of the cardboard has so little sweet spot that it limits your viewing area even if you are staring straight through the sweet spot. With the cardboard it's nice to see the depth in the picture (the 3D effect) but there really aren't much more that you could compare to the actual VR-hmd running with pc. IF you're happy with the Google cardboard your mind will be blown once you get the Rift on your head.,2016-03-05 20:50:50+00:00,d0ov12t,1,t3_4940pa,1629,oculus

He's a great fan of stoner rock/metal and classic rock and almost every genre of music as I am and I'm sure we would have great topics to discuss of but since I came straight with my smoking he started to treat me like a junkie. He couldn't bear the thought that his son smokes weed. Which is strange because he has admitted smoking himself when he was younger and he's always joking about the whole smoking weed thing like in some occasions: ""Just if we had a joint to smoke, it would so belong to this situation"" or when I'm smoking a cigar with him: ""Are you sure that is only tobacco ;)"". That cut our relationship to split and I haven't heard of him since. Mostly because of my own choise. I can't believe how someone can be such hypocrite person. 

Oh yeah.. Sorry about the rant. Have an upvote and many many great smoking sessions with your dad!",2015-06-29 08:00:37+00:00,csm7bgv,1,t3_3bgmtp,23361,trees
