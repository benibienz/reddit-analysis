Mostly downloaded videos by /u/evrydayvr straight from his ftp. Now I can't find them anymore. Now that the hype is too high and I don't own that DK2 anymore I really would love to watch some high quality gameplay videos again. The problem is that I play the videos with my phone and the quality in Youtube is very poor with it and it doesn't support 60fps as far as I know. So is there any site where I could download high quality Rift gameplay videos? 

;EDIT; I can get Youtube to play 1080p60 videos with my phone but youtube seems to compress the videos and because of that there seems to be a lot of compress artifacts. I can't see it with my desktop but the quality is poor through the lenses with the phone.",oculus,Is there any high quality gameplay recordings out there?,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/4cly3z/is_there_any_high_quality_gameplay_recordings_out/

It can take up to fiveteen minutes to get the speakers working. Earlier the speakers woke up immediately after I turned them on. When the speakers are active and working they keep having this little humming/buzzing sound. Earlier when I pressed the power on the humming started immediately but now the speakers are just dead and I just have to wait. When they start to have that humming noise again I know they're active and they're working. Would you happen to know any solution for my problem?

The S5 has 1920x1080 pentile display and I've always been aware of the screen door effect with it. It is very noticeable, I would say very close to DK2. I recently got an iPhone 6s and I just tested it with my home made hmd, just for gags. I was sure it would look terrible because the screen in the 6s is only 1334x750 but then it hit me. There was almost none of the screen door there. Yes the resolution was poor and I could see the pixellation on the edges of objects but the screen door effect was atleast 50% less noticeable than with my S5. I think the screen is lcd in the iphone though. I think in the end the resolution doesn't matter as much as the screen door effect so as they say the CV1's screen has been built to be used in VR and they have minimized the amount of the black space around the pixels I wouldn't be worried about the resolution.",oculus,Strange thing about the screen door effect,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/493xdq/strange_thing_about_the_screen_door_effect/

The freedom of movement and the fact that I would get the motion controllers along with the hmd is seducing me to the HTC's side but the comfort of the hmd and Palmer with his gang keeps me tight with Oculus. Please tell me why should I stay with Oculus and ditch the Vive? And yeah the option for buying both of them is out of the picture.,oculus,"Convice me staying with Oculus, please!",https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/48c4tv/convice_me_staying_with_oculus_please/

Sometimes it sounds cool to me so I add some drums to it. I've been doing this for a while and I thought maybe it would be nice to share my recordings and maybe have some feedback from it. So I decided to upload few jams to youtube.

I've played drums 'my whole life' but about five years ago I decided to buy a guitar and learn to play.

I really would appreciate the feedback not only from players with more knowledge and skill but also from any guitarist :) Thanks in advance!
