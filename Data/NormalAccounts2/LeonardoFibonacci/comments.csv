69,"&gt; Whew! That's a bit of an ass-kicker.

Ha, yeah.  Sorry if I came across as harsh or anything.  I realize it's a work-in-progress game and rulebook, and a lot of these things are pretty minor.

&gt; Ahh, I keep thinking about *initial* setup, and that the decks might all be packaged together. I'll consider revisions.

Yeah, I can see where you're coming from with this, but I think as long as the cards have different backs it should be reasonably clear that they're from different decks (especially paired with a component list).  The way you have it written now sort of sounds like they end up all in one pile and you have to sort them out at the beginning.

&gt; That's actually a bit that I haven't quite decided yet. I'm leaning towards the Financier going last, but no idea on the others. I'm ust not sure which order would make the most sense.

Well, you know a lot more about the contents of the deck and how the game actually plays, obviously, but I think anything would probably work fine.  Fixed order based on role, random starting player and go clockwise, or you could even let the players (or a specific player) decide what would be most advantageous each round.  That last one might lead to AP, though.

&gt; I'm actually considering changing this rule. Originally, ""In hand,"" should probably have been ""On hand,"" or ""Available,"" but what I'm considering now is changing it so that spent resources do not count, and that the resources must be spent at the time of resolving the Checkpoint. On Turn 30, all four players face a Checkpoint. 160 of each resource, except the Financier which pays 200. This would be the same turn that Vanguard starts playing 8 cards. Requiring such a large amount of all resources to be paid on this turn could mean that Vanguard completes all 8 actions, and could force players into a situation where if they haven't won by turn 30, they will most likely lose. I'd really appreciate your thoughts on this particular change.

It seems a little more intuitive to me to *pay* the resources than just to *have* them, definitely.  That would of course affect your difficulty and you might have to adjust some other things, but it sounds like a solid change to me.

&gt; Players can prevent as many of Vanguard's actions as they can afford each turn. They could potentially prevent every action on the first turn, and would therefore only have to prevent 6 actions. I'll consider revisions.

Got it.  That does make sense, but I think that section could be clearer.

&gt; I could potentially break down each of the round phases into their own sections including the different card types with each section.

I think that would make sense.  If you're worried about overloading readers with information, you could also begin the ""Round Structure"" section with a very brief overview (like one paragraph or so) of each phase first, then include more detail and information about the cards.

&gt; Apologies. I've only just kinda cemented how those would work. Essentially they track the turn number and mark off where all the checkpoints are. The Spy's second track shows the Spy's progress in finding Vanguard's location. There are action cards that further his progress. Vanguard's Tableau works in a similar fashion, except instead of checkpoints, except all of the information regarding his weight and card limits are on it.

No worries, I figured some things weren't quite set in stone yet.  I was able to get the gist of how they would function from what you said about them, but it would be good if they had at least a paragraph or two each.

Oh, and speaking of the tracks, the different players have checkpoints at different times and that's why everyone needs their own, right?  I wonder if you could merge them, so that there was only a single global player track that had the round number and everyone's checkpoints listed on it.  I don't know how plausible that is given what you have now (or if there are other reasons that players need to have individual tracks), but I think it's worth looking at.  The Vanguard could be included or not depending on how much space it takes up or how it looks.",2016-04-13 19:41:49+00:00,d21kxbu,3.0,t1_d21j9lz,1983.0,tabletopgamedesign
70,"So this is just feedback on your actual rulebook and not on the game itself, although I'll echo the other posters here that thematically it seems very promising, and I could see this being a lot of fun if the cards are interesting.

* A list of game components would be really handy.

* I'm assuming from the context that a player's tableau is like a personal board?  I would clarify that, or possibly choose a different word.

* The ""Please note"" about the Spy's setup is a little awkward.  I would rephrase that to be something like:

&gt; The Financier, the Hacker, and the Politician each take their respective tableau and pawn, and place the pawn on the ""1"" space of the track on the tableau.  The Spy takes their tableau and two pawns, placing one on the ""1"" space of the first track and the other on the ""0"" space of the second track.

* The cards are always in separate decks, right?  In that case I would get rid of separating them and just say ""place the Player, Vanguard and Event decks on the table near the game board"" or whatever.

* I would change ""Each player draws five cards at the start of the game.""  We know it's the start of the game because it's still the Setup section, and at this point there are multiple decks to draw from so I think you want to specify.  Easy enough to replace:

&gt; Each player draws 5 cards from the Player deck.

* The section that is currently titled ""Turn Structure"" would make more sense as ""Round Structure"" so as not to be confused with an individual player's turn or the Vanguard's turn.

* There's a typo under ""Players' Turn"" where it says ""Each play and their cards ... ""

* It says that players draw and then play ""in turn""-- how is this order decided?  

* The table with the turns and Vanguards' card weight is a little unclear.  When it says ""Vanguard MUST play at least X cards"", that means you continue to extrapolate the ""draw until you hit an eligible weight"" method, right?  That could be more explicitly stated.  (Also, another typo -- the Turn 3 line says ""Vanguard may pay cards ... "")

* The weight of the Event for each non-prevented Vanguard card must be less than or equal to the weight of that Vanguard card; does this mean that you draw until you hit an eligible event, or if the event isn't eligible nothing happens?

* It's pretty easy to miss the fact that resources replenish in the ""End of Turn"" section, so I would mention that somewhere else (in the Player Turn section, maybe?)

* The section on Checkpoints isn't at all clear to me.  If you start your turn on a checkpoint, you'll need to have the appropriate amount of resources by the end of that same turn?  What does it mean that it also counts resources in your hand?  This could also be repeated (or just moved) elsewhere, I think.

* Under ""End of turn"", you have two commas after ""If the player's pawn started on one of these checkpoints"".

* I would create a separate section for the endgame scenario from the actual ""End of Game"" section, and probably put it before.

* The phrasing in the endgame scenario section could probably be cleaned up; I had to read it two or three times before I got that you had three turns to prepare, I thought originally that you had to prevent all of them every turn (and thus the drawn cards would have to be prevented multiple times).  If I'm understanding it correctly now, players basically hunker down for three turns where the Vanguard only draws a card, and at the end of the third turn they have to beat all 8 of them, going in most-recently-drawn order for the three variable ones?  Or can they prevent them as they go, or does that make any difference?

* I'm assuming a card can't be played if the players who would pay for it don't have adequate resources to pay for it; it might be worthwhile to explicitly state that, since sometimes the player playing something is different than the player paying for it.

* I would consider changing the name of the ""Affluence"" resource for the ""Financier"" to something less easily confused with ""Influence"".

* The note about drawing a Location card in the initial setup would be better placed in the actual Setup section than in the Location Card section; it's kind of easy to miss here.

* The Player Cards section could probably go before the detailed information about the Vanguard turn; when reading the Vanguard turn section, I found myself a little confused by some of the terminology that hadn't been introduced yet.

* I don't know if this isn't finished yet, but there's basically nothing about the Spy's intel track in here besides mentioning that it exists.  It seems significant, so it's probably worth a whole section under ""Player Turn"" or somewhere explaining how it moves, what is significance is, etc. etc.

* Also, since there is a mechanical difference between the two tracks, you should explicitly state in the Setup section that the ""1"" goes on the ""regular"" track and the ""0"" goes on the Intel track.

* More images of things and examples (player cards, tableaux, location boards for the endgame, that sort of thing) would go a long way to making some things a little clearer.

* You mention in the Setup that Vanguard has a tableau and pawn, but never say anything about it for the rest of the rulebook.  Does it (just guessing here) increase every round and track the table of how many of what weight of cards Vanguard plays?

81,"Hi!  So this is just my stream of thoughts while I'm reading through it front to back.  There are some things that aren't explicitly stated that probably should be, and I've put those here, and then a couple of statements of rules in one section that would make more sense (to me) in another section.  All in all though it's pretty solid, especially the examples, which I love.  More rulebooks should include those.  If you want to ask for clarification on something feel free to let me know.

There were also a couple of spots where the phrasing or grammar were a little off, just as a heads-up.  I would look over it one more time and maybe have someone experienced with editing go through it as well.

Setup:

* Where do I put my team's character cards?  Just on the table in front of me?

* Can I arrange my PWNs however I want as long as they're all in my home zone?

* In general, I think it's a little better to refer to ""each player"" in the Setup section and then go to ""you"" when you're talking about specific player actions.

Starting your turn:

* I would clarify ""three tiles split any way you want"" by giving an example.  Something like ""You can move one PWN 3 tiles, three PWNs 1 tile each, or one PWN 2 tiles and another PWN 1 tile.""

* To be clear, it's the PWN/character that takes the damage if it moves into fire, right?  Using the word ""you"" is confusing here because I don't think players take damage.

* ""Take 1 HP"" is kind of a weird phrasing.  ""Take 1 damage"" or ""Lose 1 HP"" would be more intuitive.

* I wouldn't include the special effects from moving into the different terrain types here, that can easily be covered in its own section (which it looks like it is).

* ""With your PWNs in position"" is probably not quite necessary.

* ""your turn ends there"" would sound cleaner without ""there"".

Winning: 

* The player who has the only pawn left is the winner, right?  That actually isn't directly stated.

* What does it mean that it doesn't end as soon as the last opponent falls?  Just that the player's characters need to survive through their last turn as well?  That isn't really clear.

Turn length:

* This is a little confusing.  If you could, I would change this definition to ""round"" so you aren't using the same word to mean two different things.  Plus the concept of a ""round"" is already pretty well-understood.

Terrain:

* For water, I would say ""if they are pushed in or move in.""  

* Also for water, what does it mean that they move to the ""next unoccupied bordering tile""?  Is it random?  The next tile in the direction that they were moving?  Does it prioritize certain types of terrain over others?

* For ice, when you say ""fire can turn it back to water"", does that mean that if an ice tile would turn to fire it turns to water instead?  Can it happen with fire next to an ice tile?

* For holes, I would directly state that PWNs that fall into holes are removed from the game/dead.  Saying that they won't come out is flavorful but not really descriptive.

* What does it mean to directly land in the hole instead of just passing over it?

Cards:

* ""You may play only one card per phase of your turn"" isn't really necessary here because it was already stated in the turn description.

* The colors on the NRDM layout of the attack card are maybe a little confusing, since they're the same as the colors of the four card types but not really related.

Hand limit:

* I'm not entirely sure about this one, but it feels to me like you could probably put a table of hand sizes corresponding to number of players here and have the setup section refer to it.  Possibly vice versa.  It would be a good idea to remind players where they can find the hand limit for the remaining number of players in any case.

* This is a strange place to put the fact that you draw a card at the start of your turn, which seems kind of important.  I would move that so it's in the turn structure explanation on the first page.

Discarding cards:

* This section is a little unclear.  You choose to discard and draw at the start of your turn when you would normally draw?  Can you do both?  Does ""in exchange for one or more turn phases"" mean you can do this multiple times, but you skip a phase for each time you do it?

* You also say ""three cards"" here instead of referring to the correct hand size for the number of remaining players.

Colliding:

* If they're blocked from moving in the proper direction, how is it decided whether they move left or right?  Their controller?  The controller of the PWN that was knocked into them?

* If a collision is countered as a combat attack, does it not knock the stationary one back?  Does it prevent the damage to both PWNs or just the one controlled by the player who countered it?

Ivy example:

* How is it decided which way Yellow-B and Yellow-D move?

&gt; When ~ enters the battlefield, sacrifice any number of nontoken creatures you control.  For each creature sacrificed this way, put a grave counter on ~.

&gt; Remove a grave counter from ~: Put target creature card from your graveyard into your hand.

&gt; Target creature gains haste until end of turn.

Cool idea!  The rules don't let you have a sorcery in play as a creature, so this seemed like the best way of making the concept correct.  Personify is a little complicated to be a keyword by itself, I think, but you could easily do a cycle of these with just kicker.

&gt; **Choose Wisely**

&gt; Sorcery

&gt; Target player reveals a card from his or her hand, then discards all other cards.  That player searches his or her library and graveyard for any number of cards with the same name as the revealed card and puts them into his or her hand, then shuffles his or her library.

I corrected this to ""five or more"" because I assume that's probably what you meant.  Having it be exactly five could be kind of interesting, though.  

&gt; **Tyriod, the Invincible**

&gt; Legendary Creature - Human Soldier

&gt; Indestructible

&gt; If ~ would leave the battlefield, it remains on the battlefield instead.

I would say first of all that having indestructible is pretty redundant with the second ability.  Although also I would say that the second ability is kind of unfun; what about making it unable to leave the battlefield except to a graveyard or something like that?  As it is now, there's basically no way to get rid of him; even indestructible leaves alternatives (exile, -X/-X).  I get that that's what you were going for, but I don't know, it doesn't seem like it would be much fun to play with.

&gt; **Sacrificial Pact**

&gt; Enchantment - Aura Curse

&gt; Enchant player

&gt; At the beginning of enchanted player's upkeep, if that player controls no creatures, ~ deals 5 damage to that player.  Sacrifice ~.  Otherwise, enchanted player sacrifices a creature.

Again, I'm not sure if this is the neatest way of doing it but it works, I think.  Also, fun fact, negative Auras with enchant player are Curses.

&gt; **Grim Prophecy**

&gt; Enchantment - Aura Curse

&gt; Enchant player

&gt; Whenever enchanted player draws a card, that player chooses one:

&gt; * Enchanted player puts that card into his or her graveyard unless he or she pays [](/3).

&gt; * Enchanted player reveals that card and loses life equal to half of its converted mana cost, rounded down.

This also works, I think.  I'm not sure about the phrasing on the first choice.

&gt; **Protector of Worlds**

&gt; Legendary Creature - God

&gt; Shroud

&gt; ~ can't attack.

&gt; If a source would deal damage to you, it deals that much damage to ~ instead.

&gt; When ~ dies, you lose the game.

It's legal but massively overpowered.  Shroud is as close as I think I could get to your clause about removal.  I would consider maybe tracking the damage it takes between turns, maybe by using counters or something?

&gt; **Formless Destroyer**

&gt; Legendary Creature - Shapeshifter

&gt; Changeling *(This card is every creature type.)* 

&gt; Creatures you control have changeling.

&gt; Whenever a creature you control with changeling dies, put two +1/+1 counters on ~.

&gt; When ~ dies, put two +1/+1 counters on each creature you control.

Changeling is actually a separate ability from the Shapeshifter creature type, although I believe there aren't any non-Shapeshifter creatures that have changeling.  I made your +2/+2 counter into two +1/+1s instead; most of the time they should be about the same.

&gt; **Lava Golem**

&gt; Creature - Golem

&gt; First strike, haste

&gt; Wither *(This deals damage to creatures in the form of -1/-1 counters.)*

&gt; At the beginning of each end step, for each creature on the battlefield that was dealt damage by ~ this turn, put a +1/+1 counter on ~.

&gt; When ~ dies, it deals X damage to target player, where X is its power.

There's kind of a lot going on here for one card, but here you go.  Usually cards interact with either +1/+1 or -1/-1 counters, but that's also fine.

&gt; **Thrull, Orc-Clan Leader**

&gt; Legendary Creature - Orc Warrior

&gt; At the beginning of each upkeep, put a 2/2 red Orc Warrior creature token onto the battlefield.

&gt; At the beginning of your upkeep, if you control at least three Orcs, put a leadership counter on ~.

&gt; [](/0): Move a leadership counter from ~ to target creature.

&gt; As long as ~ has at least 1 leadership counter on it, other creatures with leadership counters on them can't attack or block.

I don't know if you intended for you to get a token *every* turn and only leadership counters on *your* turn or not, but that's the way I wrote it out.  I changed the third ability a bit too because it suffered from some memory issues.  Another alternative would be making it until end of turn only.

&gt; **Tomb Raider**

&gt; Creature - Human

&gt; When ~ enters the battlefield, return target card from your graveyard to your hand.

&gt; [](/X), [](/T): Return X cards from your graveyard to your hand.

&gt; [](/T): Target nonland card in your graveyard gains flashback until end of turn.  Its flashback cost is equal to its mana cost.

&gt; [](/3)[](/B)[](/B): Return ~ from your graveyard to the battlefield.

I'm not an expert but I suspect that this is horrendously OP.  Even giving things flashback rather than just playing them from the yard is a nerf (they're exiled after you play them) but this still does a *lot*.

&gt; **Mana Eater**

&gt; Creature - Insect

&gt; When you cast ~, you may sacrifice a tapped land.  If you do, ~ enters the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it.

&gt; At the beginning of your end step, sacrifice each untapped land you control.  Put a +1/+1 counter on ~ for each land sacrificed this way.

This is kinda neat.  I don't think I would ever play it, though.  The second ability is basically ""you can't ever do anything on your opponent's turn"".  The first has some cool potential, though.

&gt; **Cannibal Scourge**

&gt; Creature - Zombie

&gt; Whenever a spell or ability you control would destroy a creature, exile that creature instead.  If you do, put a +1/+1 counter on ~.

&gt; [](/B): Destroy another target creature you control.

This is a cool design.  Usually you sacrifice things you control, but requiring them to be destroyed rather than sacrifice is pretty interesting.

&gt; **Dangerous Game**

&gt; Sorcery

&gt; Each player reveals the top card of his or her library.  The players that revealed the cards with the lowest converted mana cost sacrifice all creatures they control and put the revealed card into their hands.  Each other player exiles the card that he or she revealed.

I see what you're getting at here, but that's a lot of punishment to inflict on a player basically at random.  I would at least let them keep the *highest* CMC, or let them play it for free or something.  Maybe both.

&gt; **Angelic Horn**

&gt; Enchantment - Aura

&gt; Enchant Angel creature

&gt; Enchanted creature has ""[](/T): Angel creatures you control get +1/+1 until end of turn.""

I like the idea of enchantments that only enchant a certain creature type.  I don't know if there's precedent for it, but I thought that ""Enchant Angel creature"" was clear enough.  That said, I don't see why this couldn't just be a global enchantment that's an anthem for Angels only.  It could be a lot cooler for requiring you to already control multiple Angels and be able to tap one of them.

&gt; **Harmonious Angel**

&gt; Creature - Angel

&gt; Flying

&gt; Whenever a nonwhite creature enters the battlefield, put a +1/+1 counter on that creature and ~.

""Doesn't share a color with ~"" is going to be ""nonwhite"" in this case like 99% of the time.  I feel comfortable with not keywording that.

&gt; **Time Bomb**

&gt; Artifact

&gt; X must be greater than 0.  

&gt; ~ enters the battlefield with X charge counters on it.

&gt; At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a charge counter from ~.  If ~ has no charge counters on it, sacrifice it.  If you do, destroy each creature without a protection counter on it, then remove all protection counters from all creatures.

&gt; Put a charge counter on ~: Put a protection counter on target creature.  Activate this ability only once each turn.

I assume you intended for it to be sacrificed when it blows up.",2016-01-20 06:45:32+00:00,cz4ybsx,1.0,t3_41sp8k,8018.0,custommagic
