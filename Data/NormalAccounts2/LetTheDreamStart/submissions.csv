I'm working in a project for my college where i have to study various types of VPNs. Right now I'm trying to study in a more indepth way the SSTP (Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol) technology, but I can't find any book or paper to guide my investigation. Do you have any recommendation?
Thanks in advance!",security,SSTP Bibliography,https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/4cfwu5/sstp_bibliography/
