I, myself, don't subscribe to this; regardless of how I dress, I am a trans woman-- doesn't matter of how boy I appear or not on any given day, how much I pass or not (usually I don't even try).
  
With that said, while people like myself like to say appearances doesn't matter, it absolutely does in society and that will never change; humans are vividly visual creatures and we recognize or accept a lot about a person based on visual ques and presentation alone-- and that's not only in the field of gender, but in every aspect of life. We have very evolved and defined visual roles as humans-- and only a small fraction of people will ever challenge those roles, and the impact of that challenge is no more different than throwing a pebble in the ocean for how vast the visual perception of roles actually are in the world. And I don't believe it to be as much a societal construct as it is a natural one; most species on earth put on visual displays between genders and how those differences are responded to... humans, while a more critically thinking creature, is still subject to their core nature. The visuality of gender roles are going nowhere, so we adapt and adopt to whatever degree we're comfortable with-- or hopelessly fight against them.",2016-09-14 17:10:25+00:00,d7mmf2p,1.0,t3_517ho9,827808.0,trans

And I don't call people who disagree with trans people or LGBT views bigots; some people just have a different view. If they go, ""I don't support trans/LGBT people, I don't agree with their 'lifestyle', but it's their life they can do what they want with it."" that's not a bigot... that's someone with a differing point of view.

But really, you need to wait to find out for sure... because you can develop out of it. My Doctor is prescribing me progesterone cream next month, as it's supposed to help possibly fix tubular development if caught early enough.... and if that don't work, surgery is the optional next step.

Attraction or lack of it is not a choice. You can't choose to be attracted to someone or something you're not, and to suggest that it is, it's borderline stupidity. It doesn't make them transphobic if they're not attracted to or romantically interested in someone because of some aspect of their life.

162,"I'm one trans person who doesn't really care about pronouns; when someone asks me, ""What do you prefer?"" my response always is, ""I don't care, whichever you prefer."" because I really don't care. I identify as female, I dress as a mix between boy/girl, and I don't care if someone uses ""he"". This is a statement I've made many times and it will never change: Other people do not define me, I do. 
  
Also, I know I'm a different type of woman than a cisgender woman. That's just a matter of fact, I was born with a male body, they were not, this is a critical life difference. But, here's the kicker: Acknowledging and accepting my biological state or origins doesn't make me any less of a woman or any less of a female. It just means I was born differently and I have to work harder to be myself; which is no different than any other person who was born with other kinds of physical challenges. 
  
Now, some will scream, ""You don't know the research, you are biologically female anyway!"" Well, I follow the medical research very thoroughly, probably more than most of the people on this forum do; from the biological brain differences to the very genes and their receptor lengths that are currently the prime suspects for causing gender to go haywire, so I'm very familiar with the science; from the endocrinology to the genetics. However, with that said, here's the one thing people often ignore about the science of gender: Whether you are biologically male or female is the average of the total sum, not defined by any one, singular aspect. But again, and this is the important part, this doesn't make a trans woman any less a woman or a trans man any less a man.... yet, trans people are usually the ones who have the most insecure perception that it does.
  
For me, being born a female in a male body; it doesn't make me less of a woman, because I have to work harder at it, I have to fight against a lot more resistance to be myself, and that doesn't make me less... it makes me more, and it makes me a stronger woman because of it. Why would I ever deny something that is the very source of my strength?",2016-07-21 01:59:10+00:00,d5kf7hj,1.0,t3_4tu6jd,6986.0,asktransgender

Simply not being attracted or sexually attracted to a trans person because they're trans is not transphobia... that's just your attraction, or lack of it, and that's just human attraction and sexuality doing what it does. If you're not attracted to a trans person, and you're not irrationally disgusted by them... you're not transphobic. You're just you.",2016-07-18 17:52:16+00:00,d5h23cw,1.0,t3_4tgavq,1725.0,TransSpace

So, when you eliminate the legal guns, the source of black market guns get smaller... with less black market of guns, the cost of black market weapons go up. With the cost of black market weapons going up, it makes them more difficult to afford for your average criminal. That's what happened in Australia when they implemented their gun ban due to too many mass shootings; the price of black market weapons skyrocketed from a couple hundred dollars to thousands, and in some cases tens of thousands (for more advanced rifles). Also, you cannot compare a refined, manufactured item like a gun to a plant like weed. Anyone with a gardening book can grow weed in their backyard or basement, but try engineering a gun. You'll find it isn't that easy without the engineering and millwrighting background to do it.

272,"I have nothing against genderfluid people, but I have a severe distaste for crossdressers, because my experience with them has been nothing but negative. I'm sure, somewhere out there, there are crossdressers who are sensible and sane, but I have yet to interact with them to find that experience. I'll quote something I wrote before on why I dislike crossdressers. Do keep in mind that this is a generalization and may not reflect your specific point of view, just mine and a number of trans people I know, so when I say 'we' I am speaking on behalf of myself and my friends:  
  
I've yet to meet one that isn't negatively obsessed. If I had met just one, out of the hundreds I have talked with throughout my life that wasn't like that, I may have formed a slightly different opinion. I have tried many times to give the benefit of the doubt on first contact, but they never disappoint to reinforce my experience that they are toxic towards trans women.  
  
Now, don't get me wrong. It's okay to be into crossdressing and obsessed with it, I am in no way saying it is wrong. However, I absolutely draw the line when crossdressers (and they inevitably do) try to draw me into their fetish and obsession by comparing my experience and interests as a trans woman with their experience and interests as a crossdresser. We are two very, very, very different and distinct beings.  
  
Yet, I haven't had a single crossdresser that didn't assume trans women were trans because of a fetish for women's clothes or for the sexual thrills. I get tired of messages, from every platform, that essentially hold the message, ""I love dressing up in women's clothes too, don't you love how it turns us both on? We have that in common!"" And then there's the ever popular presupposition, ""I love a chick with a dick, you'll top me while I dress sexy right, right?""  
  
Unlike trans women, crossdressers are men in dresses, and far more often than not, that's exactly how they behave, complete with the predatory sexual attitudes. Trans women don't wear women's clothes because it makes us feel 'sexy' or 'turns us on', we wear them because they are comforted, because we don't want to be naked throughout the day, because the colors or patterns or textures appeals to our senses and expressive nature, and most importantly... because it wraps us in a fabric that allows us to blend with our gender identity. Sure, there are clothes that we enjoy on a more sensual or sexual level, as every woman does, but it is neither our core nor our reason.  
  
Further more, we are (generally) not 'comfortable' with our bodies. Gender dysphoria is a very real thing, and to put it simply, it means our brains have issues with our bodies. The obsession crossdressers have with their dicks and getting off is a far fetched reality from our dislike or disdain of ours. Why would we enjoy someone else's obsession with one of our body parts that we wish didn't even exist? Let alone the very idea of 'topping' someone with it.  
  
So, crossdressers, when you hate your dick, experience gender dysphoria, and find the idea of someone obsessing over your dick as an unpleasant experience, then come back and tell me what you have in common with me.  
  
Until then, to me, crossdressers are like the dick pic of the dating world... to each their own, but I just don't want one in my inbox.",2016-05-30 05:31:41+00:00,d3ov1h8,1.0,t3_4lksc4,51163.0,asktransgender

How many times have you seen posts here from other trans women not wanting to look like man in dress? It happens almost daily among the various forums. There are plenty of us who strive to do our very best to blend the best we can we because we don't want that judgement from other people, because it can trigger our gender dysphoria when we encounter that judgement. However, here you say because she's in the most critical public eye, Caitlyn isn't allowed to have those feelings herself? You assert she's not allowed to express how she feels in regards to her image and presentation because of the people watching her? What the hell? Most of us spend a hell of a lot of time focusing on evolving our 'presentation' and wanting to look good... and any cursory glance through any trans subforum here on Reddit shows you how true that is.

You talk about how tough transition is among your friends and family... try doing it with millions of eyes watching you, and then tell me your presentation won't be highly important to you, and that being perceived as a 'man in a dress' by the world wouldn't trigger your dysphoria. 

The more I pay attention to things like this; the more I can see some serious hypocrisy in the trans community; what's allowed for some isn't allowed for others. If you're poor as pigs you're allowed to talk about your issues, presentation, and gender dysphoria, but if you're rich and successful, you're privileged and you're not allowed because you've never been poor and don't understand how it feels. Seriously? That's one hell of a skewed and self-absorbed perception to have there.

If you read the entire interview; you'll see Caitlyn says she is not a spokesperson for the trans community, she's only a spokesperson for her own life as a trans person, and that the media projects her as a spokesperson. She's reiterated this several times. If you think she's a spokesperson, you are projecting.

She's a trans person who has the right to feel and express herself and present herself however she wishes; if that's how she feels about her image that's how she feels... and how she feels has no bearing on your existence, you are not Caitlyn.

The things that do not work are not... not all medicine is synthetic. But, modern medicine is limited in the capacity that they only use what is researched and shown to work within acceptable safety profiles. Anything that doesn't yield visible and reliable results is not accepted into the field. Medicine isn't a field where they go, ""It's my way or no way,"" it's a field full of different kinds of people who are researching every plant, every remedy, and scouring results and finding ways to enhance what works. The bad thing about herbal remedies; for things not adopted into the medical field, there are no safety protocols, there are no oversights, there are no measures of what negative impacts it may or may not be having on your body... so sure, some things may work as they are, but then you're putting something in your body that has possible side effects you're entirely unaware of.

Myself, I wouldn't go the herbal route; there's more voo doo to it than scientific evaluation. Maybe the day comes when there's actual evidence to back up the claims, but the fact there is little to no actual evidence that herbal things work leading me to think otherwise, but there really just isn't. And while people like to say medical research ignores herbal remedies that work because they make money competing against it, the truth is... if herbal remedies actually worked, the medical industry wouldn't think twice about packaging that in shiny glitter and profiting from it substantially... proof is in the pudding as they already do it with things that do work in brand name vs no name medication.",2015-10-26 06:17:32+00:00,cwd4ax8,4.0,t1_cwcqyqb,24752.0,MtF

As for the murders, I feel there's just a lot more visibility than there was previously, and a lot more awareness. Before trans issues were in the public eye, a lot of trans people who were previously murdered were simply not identified as trans or went unreported, but just victim catalogued as 'men'. So, I think what's happened there's more 'reported' killings of people as trans, but I'd be willing to bet that the actual number of killings has not actually really risen compared to the statistical data, just the awareness and attention to it has. In 2013 there were about 14,000+ murders in the United States, 85 of those murders were transgender. There were 100 trans murders in the US in 2014. And people are calling it a trans state of emergency because they think we're at 25ish globally?

But, the fact that you use words like ""delusion"", ""arbitrary"" and ""silly fantasy"" shows that you have an absolute desire to ignore the medical sciences and simply indulge in your own fantasies of what trans people are or are not.

There's no 'fix', physically or medically, for the brain to adapt the brain to the body... but, we do have the technology to more so adapt the body to the brain's expectations. The purpose of transitioning, blending, and changing gender identity is to reduce or remove the dysphoria. There have been peer reviewed medical studies which has shown that male bodies can develop brains with female attributes (I mean, physical attributes) and female bodies that develop brains with male attributes. This has been shown in post mortem autopsies, and verified by other medical researchers. The amount of physical evidence via professional medical studies that exist is the reason why transexuality has been removed from the DSM as a mental illness, because Doctors are just starting to understand where it comes from. So, you see, transitioning is a solution to a medical complication that cannot be resolved via any other method. So, essentially, when you're intentionally calling down a transgender person by misgendering them, you're intentionally being cruel to someone who has a bonified medical issue. Now, I just have to ask, is that the kind of person you want to be in life? Or would you rather learn about what causes it, and try to have some understanding?

So, about a month ago, when I went to the first pharmacy with my first script to fulfill my estradiol valerate... they couldn't fulfill it, they couldn't even order it in, they didn't even know how. I had to go to another pharmacy, and they couldn't fulfill it at the time either... but they had an on-site compound lab, but what they didn't have was the compounds to make it. So, they had to order in the compounds to actually make the estrodiol for me. 
 
If you want to deal with a local pharmacy, you need to just phone around and find out which of your pharmacies have a lab. Once you have a pharmacy with a lab, they should have the capability to produce it for you, even if they need to order in the compounds. The trick is finding a pharmacy with a compound lab, not many small pharmacies have them.
 
Any pharmacy compounding lab that you 'want' to deal with will have the capacity to find what they need and order it in. If they can't, you don't really want to be dealing with that pharmacy... it shows a certain ineptitude on their behalf, and would you really want them dealing with your medications?

To be honest, that's often the way of things. She's a woman who wants/needs a man in her life, denying her life to move forward would be like denying you your transition to move forward. She did try, and that's more than most would ever do. You may find eventually, finding her as your best friend instead of your SO will be one of the best things that ever happened to you..... it just may be hard to see it now. 
 
I think a caveat that a lot of trans people miss is that ""love isn't enough"". People need chemistry, physical attraction, etc..... and when you significantly change something that attracted someone to you, it is a game changer, and for MtFs, you can't expect to be a ""woman"" and the ""man"".... it just doesn't work that way.
