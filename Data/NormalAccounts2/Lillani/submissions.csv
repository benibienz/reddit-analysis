The right wing will mostly be ""defused"" now that the election is over and they've won. It's not going to immediately mean the loss of rights or gains, etc. 

It's easy to imagine the worst case scenario, but the worst case scenario rarely happens.  The fight forward will simply be slowed for a few more years, but I really doubt you'll see things rolling back down hill. 

The legal system isn't going anywhere, it's still a recourse, and as much of a loss as a Supreme Court appointment is-- it just means the balance will stay as it always has been; you can't really get much more conservative than Scalia was, and marriage equality was still won. 

There will be the emboldened fringe element of violence, but they've always been there; you've always faced them.

Here's what I mean; if I run across a person who disagrees or doesn't really understand (or doesn't really care to) understand trans people or trans issues... I don't consider that to be transphobic. That's just a person who disagrees with something, and it can be a valid disagreement based on their own beliefs/feelings/whatever. I view it in the same context I disagree with religion and don't really want to put extraordinary effort in trying to see see things the way religious people do... it doesn't make me religionphobic, it just means I disagree with something... and I don't hate the people or what they do, as long as they don't personally involve me. I believe transphobia only comes into play when a person has a direct or active agenda against trans people and their issues; when they take action, react, or lash out with intentional harm. Personally, I think labelling ever person, thing, or situation that doesn't align or agree with trans people and our issues is a bit counter-productive on the whole and makes us seem a bit unreasonable at times. I know, myself, I have trans friends who I am on the verge of not being friends with, simply because I find their transphobic rants getting to be a little too much... they may as well hop on the other side of the fence for all the difference it makes in their spew of hatred toward every little thing they perceive to be transphobic. 
So, the questions... How do you feel about transphobia, and what's your take on it? Do you believe some people take it a little too far and label too quickly, or do you think for what you've witnessed so far, it's been appropriate? Have you found any situations where people went on transphobic rants on situations that really weren't transphobic at all?

For instance, my facial hair has lightened significantly... I can't really afford electrolysis, so I feel a bit damned in that respect, I suppose. :( Some things came quickly, a lot sooner than expect; like breasts. But, I feel like I'm going to end up caught in a quasi state of neither male/female.... and end up feeling to be neither and that's not OK with me. Tonight, I feel a bit lost, I suppose.
 
EDIT: Wow, a lot of wonderful stories and comments when I woke up this morning; it makes me feel a lot more hopeful, so thank you!. A big part of my issue is the financial costs; I own my own business, but it isn't a business that makes an atrocious amount of money that I can afford electrolysis (so this is the kind of thing that depresses me); there's a lot of days where just struggling to pay bills come and go. And I think to myself, ""How am I going to afford this if I can barely afford to live?"" I wonder how much financial worries and not being able to get the things you need to get play into the personal dysphoria; last night, I sunk pretty deep, but this morning seems to be a little chippier with the mindset, ""I'll take it as it comes and deal with what I can as I can.""",asktransgender,Older MtFs?,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/3kvpb2/older_mtfs/

I don't quite understand why they get angry or upset... yes, people will often ask questions they wouldn't (under any normal circumstances) ask people who are non-trans, but the way I see it as this; I'd rather these people ask me strange or awkward questions and take a direct interest in the process and talk to them through it, rather than give them a cold shoulder or blow off. Every time you blow a person off because you think a question is stupid or bad or insulting, you have one less person trying to understand you. That is one less person who may have stood up for you in the future. If a question makes you uncomfortable, don't get angry or upset, just explain that the question makes you uncomfortable and avoid the rants about why its a stupid question (which would probably take far more time to explain).
 
You see, people tend to naturally understand female and understand male, so they don't really have much in the way of questions for the female/male body process so there's few questions to ask, but what many people don't understand is transitioning or the transition process... so, when they're asking these questions out of ""ignorance"", they're generally not asking them to be offensive, they're asking out of genuine curiosity because it's something they don't understand and they would like to.... which is why they are asking. For me, I'm even okay with strangers asking about my body parts when they find out I'm trans. I get it, they're curious, they want to have an understanding of the process.. and I'm okay with that curiosity. To be curious is to be human.
 
The other thing a lot of people talk about, staring.... people will often stare at trans people when they're noticed. Of course, this does make a lot of trans people uncomfortable as well... but, I think a good thing to remember when this happens is that not everyone is staring at you because they think you're strange or you're a freak... people stare when they take an interest in something or they are curious about something. You are interesting them, while they are staring at you they are thinking about you, being curious about you, and wondering about you. Not all stares come from people judging you or disapproving of you... and that's something maybe people have to remember when they notice strangers staring. Don't feel bad because they are staring... instead, feel empowered because someone is taking an interest in you. Smile, wave, make them laugh, leave them with a positive impression of you, and you of them. It'll make both your days a little brighter. Of course, we all run into the occasional hater, but just remember... the haters don't make the bulk of the world and curious people are everywhere! Some will wonder through questions and some through stares.",trans,"Are there really ""bad"" questions?

It just so happened, that I was having a movie night with one of my ex girlfriends.

I found a pie. Not finding pie, in those moments, was the most devastating thing in the world, and I knew I was being irrational about it, but I couldn't stop being irrational about it. I simply wanted pie more than I wanted anything in life. And then, when I found the pie and got the pie back to my car... and I sat, physically beaming, in the car with the pie in my lap... I just about  burst into tears, it was all I could do to contain myself, as if achieving pie was the most beautiful and wonderful thing in the world. And my ex looked at me and was like, ""Are you really going to cry over pie??"" Logically, I knew the irrationality of the emotions I was experiencing over a simple pie was a bit insane, but I couldn't control what I was feeling... but I'll tell you this, even though the pie itself was very mediocre, it was best piece of pie I've ever had in my entire life.
