1,Girls had to have short hair. Was from a private Chinese school in Malaysia and they required girls to have their hair cut short (above collar) unless you have a valid reason not to. ie. You learn ballet outside of school which requires you to keep your hair long. ,2016-10-11 02:54:55+00:00,d8mtk8x,1,t3_56tenn,31473,AskReddit

3,I do collect pokecoins from gym battles as well but living in a city in Asia where there's a lot of players playing the most I could manage to stay in a gym is just 5-10 minutes =( so 150 pokecoins for 1 incubator would take me almost 2 weeks (if I'm lucky) to collect enough coins for just 1 incubator. So now I'm just waiting to collect up till nine 10k eggs then maybe I'll consider using real money.,2016-09-24 08:33:03+00:00,d7zxq51,4,t1_d7zxi5k,844,pokemongo
4,"I get where you're coming from, but I just don't like the fact that Niantic doesn't give us any other option besides spending real money or get incubators when you level up(limited and only certain levels gives you incubator). 
I would prefer if they open up other options (maybe walk a certain distance to earn new incubators?/receive incubators when you earned new medals? or like ingress where players can ""drop"" unwanted items for other players to pick up if they're feeling generous). 
And also it may only be 10 or 20 bucks for you (in USD) but for my country's currency it would convert to 4 times the amount so USD9.99 worth of pokecoins would be almost 40 bucks(I can buy 4 meals with that amount here!). Anyways I'm just here to express my frustration. I hope you can understand more on the context and not assume that I'm just whining. Thanks and have a good day/night! =)",2016-09-24 08:13:44+00:00,d7zxf6f,2,t1_d7zwgmc,3452,pokemongo

6,Haha! I will once I've collected all nine 10k eggs. I'll update you if it does feel better than sex...,2016-09-24 07:05:24+00:00,d7zw9mw,2,t1_d7zv4j9,3631,pokemongo
