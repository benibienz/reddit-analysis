Meaning they should get paid for making guides of their own but instead make it into a contest for their playerbase. If that is not the case, then i do not mind.

All this is not defendable no matter how much you type. I think everyone agrees that trion lacks in information sharing.

What happened to me on my first try was that when i taped it, the tape wouldn't come off after the cooling process. So i sat for an hour scraping it off with a tweezer, it was very annoying. Plus, i was trying to get the holes to close on one side and the whole piece kind of shrunk in size. The whole piece got really flat.

On my second try i managed to keep the volume but i could barely get any holes to close shut, how long do you reckon i should heat it for? (My black beads seem to close up much faster than the others so they are at risk of overheating and melting or being deformed).
