I am knee deep in a project and i have already invested so many hours and it just hit me, what if i cant post it anywhere and brag about it since i used a picture someone painted of a anime character aka fan art. So i tried to get in touch with the person who made it but i cant find the source. So now my question is this basically, do any of you have any idea what the copyright law says about fan art and to what extent can i use my bead art when it is finished? Can i take pictures of it and post it online and/or sell it even? 
Any thoughts will be helpful, i really appreciate it! 

Thank you so much in advance!
Sincerely, fellow bead fanatic",beadsprites,Question about copyright,https://www.reddit.com/r/beadsprites/comments/4llhi2/question_about_copyright/

Am i the only one in my twenties (22) doing this? I feel ashamed when i go into the craft stores browsing and inspecting all the bead bags. Maybe that's just me being silly!

So, dear reader, How old are you and what/who got you hooked on bead sprites?!

I'm 22 and my friend told me about it and i kind of brushed it off and tbh laughed in his face ''beads are for little girls'' now, here i am with over 60k beads 2 weeks later and several bead sprites and even more in my imagination!

|UPDATE|: Waow i loved reading all your stories. Certainly made me feel less alone in the craft. Thanks everyone!",beadsprites,Am i the only creepy 20+ here?,https://www.reddit.com/r/beadsprites/comments/4av3lb/am_i_the_only_creepy_20_here/

I live in Sweden so getting my hands on the US kind of beads are kind of hard for me. Do any of you know which kind of beads available in Sweden would be best suited for me to begin with? I plan on starting out with some small pokemons and such to get a hang on the heating process etc!

Edit :I managed to find Hama beads/pearls, they're 5 MM i think. So that's what i bought in Sweden.
