What annoys me is that we don't know what HI-Rez is doing, we don't know if they know about these issues, if they are even trying to solve them, we need feedback.

What worries me as well is that with their new game coming out, they might just not focus on this one a whole lot, and ignore the problems it has, and if the other game makes em more money, abandon smite, they have a tendency to do that ._.",2015-09-26 05:15:39+00:00,cvek5px,2.0,t1_cvek0ia,435.0,Smite
