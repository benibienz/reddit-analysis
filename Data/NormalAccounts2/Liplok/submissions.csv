The level you need to be to play ranked should in no way be 20, at level 20 i probably knew 1 map by the back of my head IF that.
At level 20 you are still fairly new to this game and barely have any experience, it also makes smurfing so god damn easy, id say bump it up to level 35-50.

Levels should be matched with levels between a fair rate, so the levels 50-100 should be matched with each other and the 1-50s should match with each others, this would maybe make queues longer but its also a life quality update.

Im sick and tired of being a level 120 Plat being matched with unranked level 20s that have no clue how to play the game, its been the 4th game i get kids that cant even score a kill on my team, it makes ranked not even fun to play.",Rainbow6,Ranked changes.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/5e8c3l/ranked_changes/

Either this or he shouldn't have a second shield... like what is the point of giving him a second shield when the first one already does enough work, its near impossible to peak him in windows if hes a good player, and all the shield needs is to block 1 bullet and the black beard hit 1 bullet.

So, im level 89 hunter and i've been black chinning since 73, the pkers have never bothered me, i mostly always escape and i get it if i die, im in the wild, but lately there has been masses of people, constant clans, constant pkers hitting me before i even reach 10 chins and i think the problem with this is that there are very few options you have when going singles pking.

You have green drags and black chins, thats about it, and i guess venny.

So my proposal is to make new skilling and money making spots out in singles pking to spread the singles pking community out a bit.

Ideas could be a small cabinet / room with a NPC in it that you could pick pocket, similiar to black jacking but it makes you B O N K.

Overall i just feel that the pk community for singles is stuck at chins for most of the time, so it sucks for them and it sucks for us hunters to be hit every 3 minutes.

It kind of sucks, while i'm sure she is extremely fun to play for some, its more annoying for the rest of the crowd that plays this game. Every time i'm against a Mei, no matter if shes countered or if shes useless she always finds a way to just annoy me, if its not me almost killing her than her turning into an iceberg and healing all her health back proceeded with a wall being put up and her running away, or her ult'ing me and stunning the whole entire team on the capture point for 5 seconds, to just simply walking up to me and freezing me, she always finds a way to piss me off. A lot of people argue that she isn't that good in competitive play, or just in general it doesn't change the fact that every game there is a Mei in the enemy team, i literally feel like leaving the game. I love your game blizzard, i really do, but i can't be the only one that takes Mei with a grain of salt and completely looses the feel to even play the game at times, same thing can be argue'd about bastion, but even him i can peek from a different angle and take out easily, Mei is by far a larger annoyance than he is.

Sorry for the rant, i just need a place to let out my anger or ''saltyness'' and i hope some people can agree that she could use some tweaking.

And just so this isn't a complete rant and i actually give ideas, why not maybe let us break her iceberg, so she doesn't go into complete stasis and heal? less health on her ice wall wouldn't harm either, or the stun on her ult breaking faster rather than it lasting 3 seconds + 1 second after it finishes. Maybe make a way to escape it?

The Run Down: i feel as if pharah gets countered by way to many things and for being a heavy armored soilder with a huge ass rocket launcher, the 200 health doesn't fit her playstyle, making her an easy pick for anyone, especially when ulting.

TL;DR: Pharah is weak IMO, Get countered easily, Low health, Rockets dont do much AOE dmg
