I am currently in the market for a ultrawide monitor. Currently I have a BenQ XL2420G and a DELL 27"" (can not remember the exact model) which I want to replace with one screen. I run a Gefore 980Ti and I have some questions;

2560x1440 vs 3440x1440

- Is the ppi acceptable for 2560?
- Is the screen resolution too 'fine' for normal desktop use? e.g. small chars
- The 980Ti would drive the 2560 obviously better then 3440, isnt that a huge plus?
- price would be cheaper?

That said, once its clear which resolution is preferrable, what is the best quality of all those techs?

- VA(?)
- IPS/TN
- LED/OLED

What tech should I pursue? e.g. no 'bleeding' and/or the higest color quality.
My BenQ has G-sync which is great, but the DELL has way better color quality.

I am lost in choosing, thanks in advance for any tips and/or advice.

I am a beginner using 3Ds max, but I am loving it. I try to import free assets from www.tf3dm.com, but I get a grey model without any material. I have worked with materials and multitiles, but with this model I am clueless in how to fix it. Can someone point me in the right direction? What stuff do I connect in the mat. editor to get a working render?

I have been trying to get a workflow from Daz3D-&gt; Unreal. So far, I export in Daz3D using FBX and import into 3DS fist. This is mainly to either delete all the bones (because I plan to use the Maximo rigger) or to rename the duplicate bones. Then I want to export it to either Unreal, to use as the seketon, or to Mixamo fist, and create animations.

The issue is that the eyes are white. Some other parts, like the lips, are also white, but these can be fixed by editing the created material (lips) and dragging the face texture into the editor, then linking it to the base color. This sometimes also goes for the arms.

The eyes though are a different matter. I followed some guides and I managed ONCE to get it to work. I think I removed all reflection in Daz3D and fiddled with the materials, by dragging different materials into the eyes and Iris (and sometimes the Sclera).
Then setting the blend top Translucent and hooking a constant of 0 or 0.1 to the opacity. The thing is, I cannot reproduce it.

Does anyone have a workflow for Daz3D -&gt; UE that I can follow, using the latest versions and Genesis 3 in Daz.

I am trying to create a VR demo and it would be nice to be able to use those characters.
