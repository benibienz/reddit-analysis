Racists aren't friends with p diddy, Russell Simmons or any person of color. Xenophobics arent open to the idea of having muslims as members of their cabinet. Mysogynists dont pick woman to run their political campaigns.

You ""tolerant"" and ""accepting"" liberals have your head so far up your own asses you've blinded yourself silly to the  hypocrisy that oozes off of you.

50,"The reason those types of original movies died out in the seventies was that directors passion projects were costing more and more and not returning the profits. Those were different times when studios had full faith in directors to turn a profit on their films. Then it all changed. Movies started to bomb left and right. Look up the movie Heavens gate by the guy who directed The Deer Hunter. Almost bankrupt the studio. It was around here that studios no longer wanted to invest in movies where profits were a gamble. They wanted action, superhero, and already established licenses only because they knew those were guaranteed profits.

Assuming this 6pk is about $16-17 (cost price not retail price and im sure it will be because bells last two special bba 6ers were that price) each beer would be about $2.80 (once again cost price). 12oz + 12oz equals 24oz so thats slightly more than a bomber at $5.60. Now obviously bells wouldnt set a bomber like this that cheap so lets say they put it at $8 cost. After youre local shop gets it and marks it up you would be paying $13-16, $16 being at the very very max and super overpriced bottle shop.

181,"Hey, beer buyer for a bottle shop in Hollywood here. Have some info not super specific to your wuestion but just useful info on ordering in general and other relevant stuff. If you want to open up a beer place first obviously you would need a liquor license. There are two types. An off premise license and an on premise license. Off premise means you can sell alcohol but not have people drink at your place. On premise means you can have people open up beers at your place but not take them home. You can also have both, a good example of that would be places like sunset beer in echo park.

As for distubuters there are many in SoCal or everywhere really. Their names and products change accordingly to where you're located. For example if i want to order stone IPA, I would go trough stone as they are also a big distributor, but say my store in another part of SoCal wants stone, i may not be able to order from stone to get it, I may have to order it from mission (another distrib). 

When ordering beer you will come to have a number of distributors you will deal with. Just an example of here are some distributors I deal with and some of the more popular brands they carry. Stone: stone, modern times, Oskar Blues, pizza port. Wine warehouse, almanac, delirium tremens, north coast. Unique craft: green flash, alpine, founders. Lime ventures, Mikkeller, parire, amager. Then there's craft beer guild: bells, knee deep, smuttynose etc.

As you can see there are a lot of distributors. I've only named a handful with some of their products, but there are a lot lot more. And some places depending on where you live also self distribute. Like el segundo brewing does that based off where I am.

Now the most annoying thing of buying beer is getting ""the good stuff"". For instance did you know that stone distributes Russian River and lime ventures distributes cantillion? Of course not because they don't tell you and they don't want you to ask about, hell even if you do, you won't get any. This is where the annoying game of you scratch my back I'll scratch yours comes in. To get your allocations (reserved cases of ""the good stuff"") be prepared to bring in a lot of unpopular or really slow moving beer. If you want bourbon county in your store get ready to bring in a lot of goose island year round beers. The most unpopular the better you're chances are of getting BCBS and variants when it's out. Works this way for pretty much any distributor. And it is by far the most annoying thing about ordering beer, especially if you have a smaller shop with limited space. As anything that is just sitting on your shelf collecting dust is costing you money. You could have something that moves really quick in that spot. So already a be willing to ask yourself is it worth it? Do I really want to bring in 6 cases of mike Hess in order to get that one case of breakfast stout?
It's an easy gig but something you need to be smart about. Especially when you're the owner and its your own money you're ordering with.",2016-01-26 22:10:54+00:00,czd34d2,1,t3_42ry4y,24346,beer

The same overtly douchy nightclubs and bars of Santa Monica. The feeling of being trapped in a bubble because you don't want to be stuck in traffic for hours to visit other parts of the city. Having friends not want to visit because of said previous reason.

Honestly got tired of the zero diversity the west side has to offer. Everything is new or trendy and overpriced, the place feels like it's losing its soul quick. Venice seems like it got a hold of the San Francisco flu where the place used to have some good vibes and nice diverse areas then all these faux rich hipsters moved in, drove up the cost of everything around them while dulling out the place by making everything in the area identical.

I used to live in Venice when I first moved here. I also didn't think I needed a car, boy was I wrong. Had a brother who lived in Hollywood. If I wanted to go grab  dinner with him one day I would literally have to make a whole day about it because it would take me two hours to get there and then two hour back by bus. Moved to k-town a bit more central and got a job in weho. Left an hour early to make sure the bus wouldn't make me late for my interview. The bus was 30 minutes late and on top of that the driver stopped at a convenient store to get  snacks on everybody else's watch. Not to mention the all to common problem of having every bus be late then having them arrive in pairs because these idiots can't seem to work a cohesive schedule. 

So my job at the time had me ending very late. Like at around midnight. Waiting for a bus at that time was the absolute worst. Walk to bus stop wait an hour for the next bus, bus arrives but it doesn't stop at all because it's packed to the brim with people. Wait another hour for next bus, next bus doesn't stop because it's so packed again due to the insanely long wait times between busses. Next thing you know it's 2am and you're still at the bus stop.

Public transportation in the city is a joke. Sure you can survive in this city without a car. But you are having to spend a massive chunk of your day waiting and riding busses.

Despite all this, we will never ever get Pliny (stone distributes Pliny in SoCal). It's ridiculous. All the meanwhile the buyer at whole foods a couple blocks away has the exact same rep I do and gets a case of Pliny each month. It's really frustrating.

Also that rule that some distributors have where you have to bring in a lot of shitty beer in order to get the limited stuff is annoying but makes sense. It's just how the game is played unfortunately.",2015-08-03 09:06:09+00:00,ctpqba1,2,t1_ctp7udh,42892,beer
