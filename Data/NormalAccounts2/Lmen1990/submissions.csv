Selecting none or changing the skin appears to be effective in the customazation menu yet while actually in game the skin remains unchanged from my old skin. Ive tried erasing the class and starting a new one yet that still diesnt work. Now my xcr is permanetly stuck with ugly crocadile skin.

We both signed the lease to be living there. She left a few days ago and put in her 30day notice to the management company who owns the building. I get a call from them saying they are worried I wont be able to keep up with the rent ($1440). I tell them Ill be fine and that if I couldn't afford it, I wouldn't be staying. They say they want me to come in and sign a whole new lease. Since our first year is up ive been on month to month. They say they'll keep me on month to month but they still want me to sign a new lease. Something doesn't sound right I thought.Whats the point of a new lease that's identical to what I'm on? 

then he also tells me ill need proof that I make 3x the rent in order to stay. Why?! I don't make that much, if I did I would be living somewhere nicer, not here. This isn't in the lease at all and I'm wondering if its even legal. I don't want to lose this apt, what can I do? I was thinking of asking if they would let mt father co-sign, but his credit isn't so great so I don't know what to do if he wouldn't be approved. 

I can easily afford to pay rent, being doubted and put into this situation before I even get a chance to make a rent payment on my own is degrading. Any legal advice would be very much appreciated. thanks

Edit: so as another kind user has helped me find out. Turns out i am in a rent controlled apt.

I get a call from DHL saying my package is being held by customs and that I need an attorney and a liquor license as well as other stuff to get the package cleared because apparently it says beer on the invoice. Confused, I contact Mikkeller and ask whats up. They said they didnt send any beer specifically for this reason. 

Now I'm annoyed but I would be even more annoyed had I actually paid a ton of cash for beer (plus mikkellers absurd shipping prices) only to have the package siezed by DHL. I dont understand. Importing alcohol for personal use is legal in California, the DHL clerk on the phone confirmed that. So why do I need a state liquor license and an attorney to due so? I cant even get a liquor license without owning a venue to sell liquor, this makes no sense!
