Damage Control by Sen.Kerry:


Now, I understand the concerns that were raised about fundraising activities of the Clinton Foundation. Let me start by saying that Secretary-designate Clinton and former President Clinton have voluntarily entered into an ethics review and disclosure process with respect to donations to former President Clinton's foundation that goes well beyond any requirements under the law or any applicable ethics regulations. This is an unprecedented situation none of us can contest, nor would we. There is no existing blueprint on which to draw here. Secretary-designate Clinton and former President Clinton have gone to considerable lengths to create a new review process tailored to these particular circumstances.
It is important to note that the pledges for future contributions by foreign governments will also be subject to this same review process. That was an issue of particular interest to me and some other members of the committee, and I appreciate the willingness of Secretary-designate Clinton and the foundation to address the issues during the discussions we had over the memorandum of understanding leading up to the hearing. Again, I and others preferred that those pledges might have also been subject to disclosure requirements.",2016-07-04 16:20:39+00:00,d4yws5z,1.0,t3_4r7x60,127.0,The_Donald

Gun control is great and we need more!! Here is a simple Army acronym to remember the fundamentals of fun control. BRASS. I still say it every time I pull a trigger. 

Breathe - Calm your breathing as best you can, become aware of that little window after you exhale and just before you inhale. That's where you wanna be 

Relax - Be as relaxed as possible. A white knuckle death grip will only make you shake and jerk. If time allows, close your eyes, listen to your breathing and sense your heart beat. Adjust your position to when you open your eyes in a completely relaxed state, your sight picture and alignment are perfect when you are at rest. 

Aim - look at your target, visualize where in space the exact point you want to aim at is. Now, bring your focus in on your front sight post (or reticle). Your target might blur a little, but that's ok. place your sight post right on that perfect little spot in space you are visualizing and make sure your sight alignment is still good and that you are still relaxed 

Squeeze- remember that heart beat that you have learned the rhythm to? Here's where the magic happens. Just relax. Don't rush. You have all the time you need to make the shot. If you don't, you shouldn't be taking it at that moment because a rushed missed shot is worse than not pulling the trigger. There will be a perfect window where your front and rear sights line up perfect, your pulse is between beats, you exhale the last little bit of air, you focus on your front sight and it's right where you want it, and everything just feels right, and you are at peace. At first you may need to sit there for some time for that moment to happen, but with lots of practice it will become second nature, and you will be able to put yourself into that zone in an instant. At that moment, and only at that moment, squeeze the trigger. Do not pull, jerk or slap it. Just put a little pressure on it with the pad of the tip of your finger. Don't try to ""feel for"" or anticipate the sear releasing, just increase the pressure until the hammer falls and the shot fires and let it be a suprise to you. You will know it when everything was right. You will know your shot is true before the bullet is even out of the barrel! Just stay relaxed and follow through with your squeeze while maintaining your sight picture and comfortable grip. Don't anticipate or fear the recoil. Just let it happen. Don't fight it. Welcome and embrace it. You will feel pure euphoria knowing you did everything right at that critical moment.
Or at least that's how it works for me...

1296,"While growing up, I was absolutely fascinated with electronic circuits. I remember I found a schematic for a project making a generator using a magnet no bigger than a pencil eraser, a germanium diode and very fine magnet wire. Part of the fun was making a device called a galvanometer out of a compass and more magnet wire. They are incredibly sensitive current detectors capable of indicating even the minuscule output of the simple generator I had built in the form of the compass needle jumping ever so slightly. Compared to r/EnoughHillHate's energy level, however, I had built the Hoover Dam. ",2016-06-25 02:46:36+00:00,d4n3psg,1.0,t3_4pp6ee,20955.0,The_Donald

1440,"Classic 40sw vs 9mm. For a long time, 40 was the clear cut winner. With modern bullet design and reliability, that is no longer the case. Know that either one can serve you well with proper ammunition. My personal preference would be the 9mm loaded with Federal 147 HST's for the following reasons:
Familiarity- I have shot thousands of 9mm rounds both in regular life and in the military, I have great confidence in my shot placement with this round, and proper placement trumps ballistics every time
Ammo Cost- Cheaper to practice, cheaper to stay proficient
Ammo Avaibility- 9mm is second only to 22lr in terms of mass production handgun chamberings
Capacity- For any given frame size, 9mm typically holds more
Reduced recoil- speaking from personal experience, your motor skills drop like you can't imagine in a firefight. I want every little dexterity benefit I can give myself for follow up shots
Reduced muzzle blast- the 147gn (non +p) round is subsonic and has less muzzle flash! This is HUGE. You won't be wearing earplugs or sunglasses and supersonic rounds will not do your senses any favors. 
Balistic performance- I feel that the negligible reduction of terminal performance with modern premium rounds (HST, Gold Dot, Critical Defense, Ranger-T, ect) is well worth for the numerous advantages listed above.

This is just my take. Again, both would serve you well. Best thing to do in your case is try to get a little range time with both.",2016-06-17 14:59:31+00:00,d4d3243,7.0,t1_d4coh66,35534.0,The_Donald
