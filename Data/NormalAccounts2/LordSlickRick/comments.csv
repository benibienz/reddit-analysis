6,"Telling me I'm playing the game wrong and need to re-evaluate doesn't ever help. It's actually a little insulting. 

For your ""counter points"" your making way too many assumptions. For the miss and kill scenario, your assuming im looking right at them in a 1v1 and they miss a shot. There's so many scenarios where people are flanking and running around, you lose track of people in 6s. In those cases its not just 1v1s. I jump around the corner theres a guardian sliding by and a I make a miss or partial shot. WIth a shotgun, its easy to just press and make the cleanup. With say a fusion, its much much harder to make cleanup, if they had a shotgun they can turn on you, easy set up for a misplay. The shotgun is just more forgiving for mistakes and scenarios where you don't get the kill. 

As far as closing the gap, theres plenty of gaps in destiny between doorways and halls that are very small. And you can't always lead someone out of them. Sometimes I have to go where he is. Maybe its control, maybe I got on the outside of the cap point at the end of a trials map, maybe the rift running is passing by in that room, and theres a person with a shotgun on the other side of the door. There are so many scenarios where the shotgun has a very heavy advatage and I need to press through a place. But If i don't have the shotgun, the disadvantage is real.

And when I do misplay which is inevitable for everyone, I step too close, I miss my fusion shot on a rushing shotgunner, or I'm a sniper out of position. Or I find someone in that scenario, the shotgun can capitalize on a mistake easier than most weapons, and that ease of use makes it such a good choice. 

So get your head out of the sand, realize not all destiny is team deathmatch and elimination, and try not to assume people suck or insult them. And maybe you can objectively make opinions about the game without sounding like an elitist ass. ",2016-11-18 14:09:56+00:00,da5mzca,3.0,t1_da50rwj,47597.0,DestinyTheGame
7,"Problem with shotguns is they are extremely good for destiny's mid air high mobility play style. You can one bang people at ridiculous ranges while soaring through the air. Two they are good with all the mobility exotics, if you run twilight garrison or bones bones or blink they work exceedingly well together. You can't blink fusion people because of the charge time or fly through the air with a sidearm without massive stability loss. Third they are unbelievably forgiving. If I misplay with a fusion, I'm dead due to chargetime. If I miss or miss headshots with a sidearm I lose the trade. If I miss a shotgun shot, its less than  a second to another easy kill. On top of that they have a low skill on aiming requirement. You don't need headshots for really long range kills, you can just aim for center of mass and boom, easy kills. And last there's no counter play after they are in range. With fusions and sidearms you can jump back and forth, or partially get behind cover to ruin kills, with a shotgun its just too last, boom dead. This also goes hand in hand with them being able to hold rooms really easily. When someone has a shotgun and you don't, if I can't smoke them out with a grenade, or you don't have one you often have to pick a different path to that area. You can't contest, in close quarters its just their win.


Really they just go really well with how the game is played, have high ease of use, and dominate with no competitors in their range. I really don't want to see the blanked range/impact nerf, that's uninteresting and does not help with the fact that low range and impact shotguns will remain useless. It would be fin to see if they could mix around high impact and low impact range stats and make meaningful choices. Not just choose matador and roll because nothing can compete.

55,"I like your initial thoughts, but consider these few things. 

1. If handcannons get the bloom mechanic removed, which I absolutely think is necessary, then they will require more steep damage falloff. If you take the crucible vendor the palindrome, or any high range HC's you will notice that the dmg falloff is pretty far out in pulse rifle ranges and they will take over the meta. 

2. The two lowest archetype pulses are in a great place, but the two higher impact are not. Nirwins archetype I think is fine as a beginner gun, much like hung jury scouts are. They have good range, stability and reliability. But may not be the most competative, max impact pulses need a buff. Personally I would like the dmg to go up, and the rof to go down more. Go back to that two burst, but make it take longer. 

3. Auto rifles need a buff, but they have to have a range nerf as well if thats to be the case. Dmg falloff would have to be pretty hard or they would just take over pulses in the mid territory. Frankly, because of the necessity of headshots for ideal ttk, only perfectly rolled autos are good, I always wondered what it would be like if they were like fusions, no crits, all body and head shots did the same dmg. It would make them alot more interesting as a close range, spray and play gun. 

4. Shotguns, I agree with the removal of rangefinder, but I think all the gun types need an overhaul. I would make all the max impact shotguns have low range and all the low impact shotguns have the highest range. Then it becomes a choice, do I one bang at close range, or do I try to get multiple shots off at long range? I think it would make them way more interesting.

305,"In order for Muriel to be a support class, she must be capable of supporting herself, and 1-2 other team members.

Read this and instantly said no. 

She should be able to support herself and one other teammate,  a strong laning choice/ carry protect. Or she forgoes supporting herself for team wide support, not good at laning, team fight focused.  You can't have all 3 without being a broken, always gamechanging monster that she was. 

""The fundamental problem is that these two abilities require your team mates to be relatively close together when you put the AOE shield down. Same with reversal of fortune, requires allies to be grouped up together to be worth using. This is a MOBA, exactly when should I expect my team mates to be bunched up to save them?"" 

This is actually why aoe shields are sooo strong and break games in most cases. They are incredibly game breaking, not weak. It allows her to go from mitigating 300 total dmg on one character to mitigating 1500 total dmg on a team. Aoe shields is what broke her, a grouped team fight suddenly would switch from a disadvantage to a huge advantage in terms of dmg needed to kill something. 

And finally having multiple of the same ability is bad for a character, and makes them very hard to balance. In her case it is the shield. Right now if she hits someone with reversal of fortune, then alactrity, and consecreated ground, she can mitigate 1385 dmg. That's actually a good bit of dmg mitigation, while providing a knockup, and a speed boost for the hero she is saving. On top of that she provides a shield in aoe, dmg and still has an ability to slow an additional target. 

The problem is her kit is entirely base on how much dmg can I mitigate? Too much and shes broken like she was. Too little and people yell useless. Her kit needs to be fleshed out more, less shields other support spells instead to make her easier to balance, and her total value isn't based on just dmg mitigation values.

She was given too much utility with not enough downsides/ trade offs. In addition, in proper scenarios her utility spikes massively, as in a close together team fight where people get grouped. Just nerfing the shields was probably the wrong choice to make here ""balanced"".

I would probably have reduced her main health more than anything else, and made all her shields scale of energy dmg. That way you can be the shielding force you want to be with proper investment, but because your not investing in health, proper positioning is very important.

420,"I don't think its being a pusher so much, as pushing lanes is vital. Yes ive dealt with the split pushing iggy and ive done it too, its hella fun and can win games. Mages more struggle IMO with translating that early game push into a meaningful mid game. 

IN an ideal situation, say I was a caster mage one of the ""pushers"" vs an aa hero in lane. It mostly goes how you would expect the first 10 minutes. I out farm, I push him from lane and in essence take the lead. THe ideal next step is that my power increase from out laning him, would allow me to then kill him if he tries to farm and overtake the lane, take the tower, and then move on to take other lanes or teamfight or whatnot, in which I was the stronger champ from lane dominance. 

IN paragon currently , I can outfarm and push aa characters out of lane, But because the kits are clunky and the ults are aoe focused and easy to escape, its difficult to translate that early game power into kills and taking the turret. too often the aa based champ or bruiser still gets that mid game power spike, and their auto attacks then outscale my abilities and boom, im back to losing 1v1's and being less of a contribution, and they actually farm faster than me at end game. Try to defend an inhibitor against super minions as gideon not using an ult (you literally just drop cosmic rift every once and awhile and say ""im helping..."", or a late game aa carry, the carry is cleaning them out much faster than you are. 

The issue for me isn't the position or how their idealized, but the kits not allowing me to properly translate early game dominance into mid late game victory. 

Things that need to happen is mana pools and cooldowns need to be upped a bit more late game. Kits need to be able to flow better and respond quicker. Spells should be harder to avoid, I should be able to effectivly fight bruisers and aa attack champs trying to get into range of me. ",2016-06-08 20:04:49+00:00,d41csfx,1.0,t3_4n6u1q,2457.0,paragon

Its a viable roll and strategy to be a split pusher. 
 
""To face the problem of not working in the late game, give them CC or debuffs/buffs."" 
I agree with this but its not really the issue, of the three primary mages now, all of them have a slow. cc is present, not hard cc which would be interesting on some but I find its not what holding them back. It's more about dmg consistency. Gideon is an easy example, all his dmg is tied up in two abilities, one of which is an ult. When your ult is down or your not in position, because lets face it positioning is key with it, your really just dropping cosmic rift, running in a circle and waiting till cosmic rift comes up. Then you just burden or blink if people get too close. But how can you have a character thats a threat if everything is dependent on hitting one, not that fast, aoe ability that lets you know its coming? you can't. Theres  no consistent dmg or threat late game. 

agreed burst mages are a danger territory. too strong they go crazy, too weak they suck it big time. AN effective counter to glass cannons are needed. A good assassin mage should be able to counter a wild aa carry, even with a support if their good. But its about not giving them too much dmg, and not too much escape potential. 

kallari is weird in that shes the imperfect assassin, too much escape, not enough dmg. really needs to either lose the jump or the  invis in favor of another dmg ability before she becomes a real assassin. 1 escape, either you initiate with it for a kill, or you wait attack and use it to escape instead, not both.

461,"I like the system, it reminds me of playing yugioh. Building decks, then making sure you pick and choose to play your cards right. However it definitely hurts the new player a great deal. I just started a few days ago, and some champs, especially mages I can't upgrade enough, I run out of flat energy dmg. A maga like howitzer I can't actually build energy pen right now because I don't have a blue energy pen item card. Talk about late game fall off, or God forbit your on an all energy based team and your opponents build defence for it. 

 I wish there was a more clear way to at least get one of each type, at least for core mechanics. Sure it can be rare to find that unique passive one or something like that, but for things like flat dmg or penetration, attack speed, cooldown, it should be easier to make full builds early on.

486,"if you look at the weapon, when you go to infuse it usually says what happens to the scaling. Some items like the sharp gem, increase the scaling with a certain stat, in this case dexterity. However it does hurt the scaling with strength. It makes it better for a dex build, but worse for one that uses a good bit of strength. 

THe infusion really depends on your stat spread. The claymore scales slightly better with strength, but is really a quality weapon. If you have a heavy strength low dex, pick the heavy gem(right name?), boost the strength scaling. If you have a split stat, dex and strength, boost the dual scaling with the refined gem, I think its called. Heavier on dex? You could sharp weapon it, but I would probably recommmend a better dex scaling weapon to start with. 

This page has a good breakdown of the stat scaling when you infuse. http://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Claymore

I think that if the rof was dropped more, and still allowed two burst it would be more interesting. It was sitting around .73ish before, really fast. What if it two burst around the .85 time slot?

602,"Yes and no, low impact snipers are good for popping off a guy even if you missed the first shot, either way you should be gunning for headshots. With both sniper if you had a fictitious 100% accuracy then the lower impact snipers would still be less efficient. In addition the 1000yrd stare variety can one shot headshot someone in every super except i think ram/ or max armor all shielded sunsingers. In that case the 1000 yrd stare is better for regular crucible too, can shutdown supers, other type takes several shots. 

In addition for poor old pve, the low impact snipers plus the low inventory really makes 100yrd stare or black spindle such a better choice. Right now theres really no reason to run anything else. 

I personally find that the low impact snipers have a very small niche of being able to take out 2-3 people in very rapid succession that higher impacts can't. A few times, and very few times ive got a triple kill by rapidly killing 3 people due the high ROF. But by and large, the low impacts don't have much on the high impact classes.

622,"Agree on those two points, although you can go farm out a imago loop pretty easily on the nightfall. Statwise its almost identical to the finnalas, 2 more range, for maybe 4 points in stability and reload. Lower aim assist, slightly better recoil direction. Slap Hidden hand on it and its a good gun. 

I won't agree for very good. Ive have some good imagos, I had a pretty good eyasluna, but the low recoil direction and aim assist makes it not ideal for me, even though it has that higher base stability. In the end I feel it just doesn't trade with scouts and pulses, at long range it shouldn't at close range I feel it gets hit off too much, ghost bullets really hurt it alot. In addition hit fire feels real bad if you ever need it. 

Either way I guess we agree to disagree. What do you feel about the higher ROF, lower impact hcs like the appellant, I feel the bloom hurts them alot more,  and I noticed you didnt mention, any of the omolon style ones. I personally don't like them at all, what are your thoughts. And there still seems to be almost no use for the max impact HC's unless your hunting low armor hunters for that two shot lol.

Just step back and look at the facts. If HC were truly top tier, streamers, youtubers and trials carry aficionado would be telling people, hey you, to step up your game, grab a eyasluna, or imago loop, or finnalas... It's what I use to carry... But that's not what's happening. Excluding TLW of course, but it hardly counts as a traditional HC. Sure, I imagine talented players often can use what is not exactly the most top tier, and through their skill still win regularly, but it does not make it an ideal or top tier choice.

I personally have a hidden hand rifled outlaw imago loop, and ya its ok, but its soo far from top ter its a joke. As far as a dmg buff, I would not. They currently, in the eyaluna archetype, one headshot and two body shot kill, at closer ranges. At longer ranges the dmg falloff really skews this. But either way with headshots they have plenty of dmg. The bloom is so much currently that you cannot re-aim properly to shoot at the ROF of the gun. Sure you could go to stability, but then you make the dmg cone so large form not specking into range that your phantom bullets go through the roof. There needs to be a fix to the cone, and the bloom. I think dmg is fine.

I really wanted the year one emblem before TTK. It was an interesting trio, full of ups and downs. Craziest moment was when the two of us died, and since the saudi arabian didnt talk we has no idea what he was doing, we were yelling at him to come out for revives because noone was on us, and he just ran inside on blackshield, and boom suddenly the other players were down, we won the round.

705,"""This means a shot is fired at the start of every 5th Frame. This is where Destiny's Frame Rate comes in. There is no such thing as half a frame. Unless you're running a game with some ridiculously amazing FPS (120+), your Frame Rate is gonna create inconsistencies with RPM. The lower the frame rate, the more this is a factor. This does not mean only certain RPMs can exist in a game, but it does mean that RPMs divisible by 3 will have to most consistent Rates of Fire. This is most likely why Mid Impact ARs have a 40% Drop in RoF, cause a 33% drop would put it at 400 RPM. ""

It seems to my that you are somehow implying framerate affects ROF, which I would say is completely untrue. Whether or not the game can display something does not affect the background coding that calculates dmg. You can't say fires every 5th frame, it could vary depending on when the gun was shot, when the dmg calculation began, which could be at different intervals during the same frame. Perhaps it always takes 5 frames do display, but that doesn't actually mean the dmg is calculated like that. At least I would not think so.

But what you should be asking is about not only response time, but input lag. 

What's input lag my good sir? Is it different from response time? Well I'll tell you response time is how fast the pixels change colors upon receiving input. Low response times mean your remove ghosting, which is when an image stays temporarily behind even though it should of moved. It creates fuzzy looks on the screen, and means the image is not updating properly. 

Now for the silent killer. Input lag, many people don't look into this but its the time it takes for the output from your game system to be changed into a image. Has nothing to do with the pixels, and their response times, but how fast your monitor processes image. I have a benq with about 10ms, input lag. Very good, but input lag can get really high, and well it just means that things are happening and the monitor cannot process images fast enough. I strongly, and I mean strongly recomment looking at this site and reading about input lag. They even have a database of monitors and tvs they did testing on.

2. They can't return fire. When you get hit back in a firefight, your accuracy drops just a staggeringly large amount. Can't tell you how many times you can get the first shot and then boom, thats it, you hit no other shots under that hail of pulse or auto rifle fire. You just lose. 

3. The bloom is too much. High ROF handcannons cannot shoot reliably at all near their max ROF. There is literally no reason to use one when the mid rof shoots just as fast as you needing to pace your shots with the High ROF ones, but have more damage.

1245,"The biggest issue I have personally encountered is range. It hard using handcannons as a versatile weapon without it. I farmed for finnala perrils like crazy playing Iron banner exclusively that week, but the best I got was a truesight, rifled barrel/explosive rounds, grenadier finnalas. Still no imago loops despite doing that strike every week, a few times a week. RNG is not on my side. So unfortunatley I don't have the imago or finnalas with rangefinder to test the benefits. But the finnalas with rifled barrel/ no rangefinder is just a better ace of spades, and I love it. On smaller maps ive had lots of success dropping down to the base 38 range and going with explosive rounds, but mind you on larger maps you cant hit the broad side of a barn past 15-20 yards. I have recently, as in a few days ago aquired an eyasluna but havnt tested it much. But it has low aim assist for a HC at 50 (most good ones sit around 70-90), so I strongly recommend truesight, sureshot, and hidden hand. 

But its hard to say with the december patch arriving soon, better aim down sights accuracy is coming. And depending on the strength of that, aim assist may lose some value, opening up more interesting choiced like icarus. Ranges value lies in the fact it really counters the nerf to HC's two fold, it allows it to perform at pulse rifle ranges, and it increases the aim assist, allowing for much better follow up shooting, another nerf. Well the followup shooting is getting a fix, so hopefully we see a surge. Unfortunatly were still stuck with very few guns stat wise, finalas, and imago being the best, eyas being good, along with byronic hero and gaheris d. I have the perfect roll gaheris-D, truesight, rangefinder and reinforced barrel, trple tap. but unfortunately that 7 round clip, and extended mag not anywhere in the perks, and triple tap being ineffective in pvp, its just can't perform, you reload constantly. Still need a water star, but I shy away from its need to get 2 headshots and a body for a kill, whereas all the rest are only one headshot and two body shots. 

Your finnalas and Eyasluna are the two best, depeding on how eyas followup shots are I would take that one despite low aim assist/ mediocre recoil direction, but remember if you don't like it, wait till the december patch, test then make a decision. 

Sorry if a bit lengthy, but I would say, keep your eyes out for eyas, imago and finnalas(whenever it comes back in a few months) with rifled barrel or rangefinder. Rangefinder seems to be best, because it can make a imago or eyas a very good mid range gun and allow it to still use explosive rounds or go for stability as well. The rangefinder and rifled barrel HC might make the range on these 38-40 range handcannons ridiculous and im waiting patiently for one to drop, it may be the god roll. RNG will always be the wall, but hopefully luck lets me jump it some day. Good luck guardian. ",2015-11-30 15:52:40+00:00,cxhz6x6,2.0,t1_cxeewl1,300603.0,DestinyTheGame

But you also have to consider theres a massive statistical difference between guns. Chances of getting a perfect roll ruin wake is, 1 in about 650. Way better odds than the 1000s that HC's have. ON the other hand most HC's arnt even servicable without great rolls. Every weapon has different odds depending on its build. Perfect hawksaws and most suros are in that 1 in about 650 for a perfect roll as well. The problem is some have terrible odds, others not so terrible.

1391,"No its just theres alot of general misinformation floating about, I don't have specific examples. ON the regular reddit someone just tried telling me Mida gets faster TTKs from hair trigger, and that just isnt so. I wish the sub was filled with more technical info, and I don't feel its the moderators fault, its just that alot of people say things they ""feel"" are true and don't often have a good reason for things. I have seen exxtroopers work, and its excellent i reference it constantly in TTK discussions on the reddit. Part of it may be just a personal issue with me, I get extremely technical and prefer extensive testing/ stats to make concrete arguments. Personal pet peeve. 

But when it comes down to it, outside the great info I pull from the things like your recent podcast with bungie, or a useful trials guide. It's too often full of new player looking for advice. Fore example front page is asking for advice on best Eirene scope. Everyone and his brother is going to tell him faucon, lowest zoom scope and they are right. But I knew this the second week of TTK. I'm glad its a place where new players can step in and discuss and feel out crucible, and on top of that its a welcoming environment. But for people pvping since the start, and follow it closely, there not much to glean on a regular basis. 

Hate to pick on you personally but another example is armsday. The main page article has a very extensive list of weapons and rolls. And staff picks, your dedicated megathread says ""lets discuss"" and is rather short on info, well because there is none. People post lots of great info, and some of the rolls, but i it doesn't get clear and to the main part, it just becomes a chore to shift through 900 complaints of Litc, to come across interesting thoughts requested by the mods. 

I know this is long, and I don't want it to sound like Im bashing on you, but realistically i get more information even related to pvp from the main sub on a regular basis. It may be just more people choose that one for more exposure, theres just way more people on it now. It would also be nice to see a bit more structure, but I have no idea how moderating works, and what type of time commitment you mods can make or choose to make. 

I appreciate the sub, but i feel there is definitely room for improvement. AN example would be a consice write up megathread for a few days that specifically points out the new, and very good info provided form the podcast. I would never of known by going to the sub, only because I subscribe to planet destiny podcast. Hope my thoughts helped and good luck.

1555,"I think it's very good. With the sunbro love/hype out there I think not many people are playing with it enough and realizing the potential. There is a very big mobility buff coupled with blink and topped off with armor reduction makes them very hard to kill in 3s. In 6v6, theres more distance to travel, so you see many get killed after their first 1-2 kills chasing after others, but in trials it only takes 3 to win. I think its placebo, people are like ive killed a stormcaller in 6v6 sure, but they aren't taking into account they probably took a few down first. I think its the super that's the most like bladedance season one. It required positioning skill, but once it has started the crazy mobility, and really the range that is good, obviously better than bladedancers need to be point blank, will allow it to just cruze through teams if they don't spread out and get a good team shot. The blink in super is such a good counter to being sniped. Blink through a door on top of someone and just melt, and the dmg time is not affected by the blink jump ready time nerfs. 

I know this is long but its prob in the top 3 for trials supers, it's gonna replace self res once people learn the new meta, and stop trying to play last years meta. ",2015-11-06 16:51:26+00:00,cwqsscl,3.0,t1_cwqsdp6,601.0,DestinyTheGame

1558,"The golden gun vs hammer argument lies in the vulnerability that golden gun forces you into. You have to expose yourself with line of sight for golden gun. Can result in trades with snipers and team shotters. Hammer with aoe tracking and armor, can survive when line of sight is established, but on top of it can get kills from the aoe without exposing themselves. Hammers aoe if prob a little too big. Ive had hammers fly past to clip a roof or wall and kill me, its a pretty forgiving miss. But when a titan sees someone on radar they don't need to wait to see someone to kill, just hit the doorway or wall they are behind and boom. Golden gun may have the fastest longest kill, but hammers have a safer easier to use super. Theres benefis to both, and they excel in different areas. Titans have the advantage in that if they are too far away to use hammers properly all the armor/ duration lets them close the gap even if activated poorly.

1559,"Excellent breakdown. I would of liked seeing the duration of the hammer of sol addressed. One of the big issues is that they can wipe a team at heavy, then cross the map and wipe those at that heavy as well.  I agree that compared to golden gun it may not be hitscan so they get dmg reduction, but there is an argument that tracking/ massive aoe is almost as good as hitscan. Sure i see you i hit you and you go boom, but you have to make line of sight. That means you can sniper trade/ super trade because you have to make yourself visible. Good titans who realize another has a super can just throw hammers near doorways and get kills without ever exposing themselves, the aoe is very good. Ive lost the GG vs hammer several times. You can dodge 3-4 hammers but then one will clip a wall and the aoe will trash you while they tank a shot, or a  good titan will hear that golden gun and just smash all the ground around the doorways essentially holding you back till your super runs out. Not only does it get armor, it allows you to fight without exposing yourself, which I think is very strong and underutilized by a lot of titans. 

Other thing that would be nice to address is that the super has so much room for error and success. It is extremely forgiving. Golden gun you can pop and miss the shots, shoot between the legs. Void bomb and titan smash your one and done, so if you hit a wall, land funny, your out. Self res is all about timing, but is a little more forgiving, but with res sniping these days it can just be boop dead. Stormcaller with blink is another pretty forgiving super, its hard to mess up, skill is in timing the blinks. But with aoe dmg theres no aiming, armor reduction helps.  Nighstalker same issue as voidbomb, that thing gets stuck on crap constantly, way to often the roof above you. But with the titan one you can just chuck hammers all over, and you just sorta hit a wall nearby someone and you get the kill, its one of the supers thats really hard to fail with, and I think thats another major issue. If you pop sunbreaker your guaranteed the kill even if you mess up maybe the first 3-4 hammers. Many a miss turns into a kill cus it hit the wall behind someone. I don't like that it is sooo forgiving. Even bad activations are not such a issue due to the armor. THere was a clip a few weeks ago of one being team shot, popping the super at 1/4 health, surviving and just wiping everyone.

It may be the go to pair for a sniper, very good swap speed too,  but having to hit two headshots instead of one right now is too punishing. If you can do it, the TTK drops to an excellent .73 seconds, but you would have to drop the range further and grab handlaid stock.

1707," break down of the weapons-

The Water star handcannon- low range, bad impact class that requires two headshots for a kills instead of one, and required giving up stability for range.  bleh.

Doctrine of passing- auto rifle- really bad base stability, but has persistence braced fram and can get counter balance. But really auto are not competative for pvp. so bleh.

The inward lamp- scout rifle- shoots fast with full auto, unfortunately this archetype needs to have lots of stablity, something this weapon does not have, and this scouts TTK isnt great. Bleh.

Reflection sum- pulse rifle- a nirwens mercy that gives up range for stability. Has army of one... theres much better pulse rolls out there. Bleh.

Glass promontory- sniper. Can't res snipe. but if your into fast snipers it is in the fastest rate of fire to body shot archetype. Has good perks. If your into it, sure. 

Elevating vision- fusion rifle. super high impact, slow charge. Take it to pve. Pvp, bleh. 

Binary dawn - shotgun - Highish base range? Yes, High impact yep, All impact range ballistics? YES, rangefinder? YES, HOT DAMN. Field scout? HOLY FUCKING BALLS OF FIRE YES! 
Do you wan this gun? YEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS for days. 

The tamarind- rocket- has good impact and velocity and can get proximity detonation. Depending  on number of rockets pulled with ammo boots and field scout, it could be the best impact velocity ammo ratio out there. needs testing, but il slap a yes on it. 

The unseeing eye- mg- good ballistics, sees the return of fieldscout, has zen moment and can get persistence or spray and play. High impact type, looks like a solid choice. 




Tl;DR, the primaries suck ass, the specials and heavies are great to better than average.

1722,"Well there is an it gun, its the pulse rifle for 4 reasons. 

1. It performs well at all medium and close ranges, especially due to the open low zoom sights available. They suffer at only the longest, and thats pretty far ranges. But not all because some roll with very good range and stability. 

2. Most of the maps are medium engagements, and long narrow sightlines. Its why handcannons were so great paired with a sniper. The exotic ones were broken from the massive range they could compete with snipers, but thats gone for the most part. 

3. Except hawkmoon, they are the only two shot kills in the game. Its the reason the messenger could compete with the exotic handcannons, and high impact pulses have gotten no nerfs. If they were competitive then, you better believe they will be super competitive now. 

4. Availability. Theres already 3-4 available very good pulse rifles anyone could of gotten. Sure you might have that perfectly rolled handcannon to go with your sniper, but you are probably 1 in 500,000. There is exceptions, but they will be few and far between. Also there is an inherent problem, the only roll a pulse rifle needs is stability, and not much. They all have decent range, average stability, and above average reloads, and they all received ammo buffs. To get great range and max stability, you give up almost nothing. In fact even average rolled ones are better than most archetypes, due to their excellent stat spreads. The best rolled handcannon with max range is going to have rally bad reloads or stability, not the case with pulses. ",2015-10-29 19:27:00+00:00,cwhi6w1,7.0,t1_cwhdusd,6019.0,DestinyTheGame

1. A low zoom scope with good field of view. Your just gonna have to find the one you like, theres different preferences out there, and theres no best. But large field of view/ low zoom is important. 

2. Stability- good stability is great, really important on high rate of fire snipers for follwo up shots, less important on the slower ones, but still helpfull. 

3. Ammo consumption perks/ other perks- most snipers pick up 4 shots a crate in crucible, (at least from my experience so far, was almost unanimously true in HoW)  but theres a few that pick up 6now. Perks people get are performance bonus and clown cartridge to maximize keeping ammo. Unflinching is a hotly debated one on effectiveness. I like it, others hate it. Firefly is also a notable mention, it can grab you an extra kill occasionally, but im not a huge fan. 

4. Aim assist, doesn't seem to affect bullet magnetism on snipers as much as other classes as per planet destiny's testing. (look at their website, they have a thing on it from somewhere in the spring). But it does affect how sticky the sights are to the target... Its hard to explain but it helps with headshots guaranteed. 

5. Impact- the most popular pvp sniper is the 1000-yard stare impact. It res snipes, one headshots people in any super except the sunbreaker (dissapointing I know), and overall they have decent stability and aim assist in that class. Others such as myself prefer the really high rate of fire, but they definitely have downsides. I like it because im not so mlg pro and the followup shots help alot. But if your great, stick to the 1000-yrd stare archetype.

Honorable mention range, theres range falloff now so having range is good, but theres alot of small maps. It may help on some of the larger maps though.

Handcannons are suffering form range issues right now, theres 4-5 legendaries out there that rolled perfectly can be extremely competative for pvp, but you know rng, maybe only a few people have one, if they even kept it. 

Auto's cna keep small range if they get a better TTK at their optimal range/ better stability overall. Handcannons need something else if they are going to keep them at such limited range. TTK is fine on mid upper impact guns at .8 something, a very competative time. It would be nice if they upped the flinch multiplier more to make them hit like a truck at short range so that they compete in close quarters.

Ive done a new sample to show better what I mean. The Ace of spades has 95 recoil direction. I did not aim at all on the first two sets. You can see with or without stability the gun moves almost straight up and down, minimal right left pull. I didnt touch the right stick at all for these. At 35 sec, I pulled down on the stick while firing. Then did the same for the stability version. The patterns are nearly identical, showing with or without stability, you create nearly identical patterns. Without stability you definitely need to pull down to counter recoil more, but its straight down, therefore needing almost no side to side correction but instead a slight pull straight down, the gun does not move all over the place. I do recommend giving up reload for range as stability will allow for less downward pull, but if you know your gun, its a consistent pull downward, doesnt require any thinking or correction.",2015-10-12 14:36:30+00:00,cvwxna8,4.0,t1_cvu6ols,233438.0,DestinyTheGame

The only swap I would make is a preference choice, Third eye for aim assist, and a recoil sight for an aim assist sight. But I strongly recommend this weapon for crucible. When you are leveling it, if you have a chance see if you can test the gun before and after rangefinder to see if you notice the range potential. Note the gun may not seem great till the major middle tier range perk is unlocked. Remember bungie confirmed range helps aim assist. Try it out, it sounds great. maybe A tier without the true sight or sureshot, im reserving s tier for absolutely perfect rolls.

The guns I did my tests with are the fulcrum and red hand IX, they both have recoil directions at 80 and 90. Maybe important, I did my tests both with truesight IS, target acquisition and recoil control. In my tests whether or not the stability was high, the guns did not veer right or left more than a few centimeters. ON the red hand when the stability went up to 100, there was an extremely small change in up down spread of the bullets. A very small change in fact. All handcannons will pull up a little, but with high recoil control, theres almost 0 side to side movement. If you have a fatebringer, or another high recoil cannon pref with truesight, test it without explosive rounds on (the make the gun shake considerably), and see if you notice a difference.

2030,"I recommend looking at planet destiny's site, its where I pull stats. http://db.planetdestiny.com/items/view/2279937629. Byronic hero has good aim assist at 71. Its really all you need. For sights, its really a preference, For me its truesight 100% of the time, my fav sight. Many others like sureshot, they both boost aim assist. Quickdraw in your case is a good pick, it ups the handling. When looking at s tier/ a tier weaponry for crucible for handcannons its about overcoming the range nerf, thats why I heavily approve of rangefinder/other range boosts. With 70ish range handcannons, I can regularly compete with pulserifles and scouts at medium ranges to some of the farther ones. Without large range buffs i can't recomment it being a highclass pvp weapon. Braced frame is close to useless as I pointed out in the article. I did significant testing with a braced frame red hand IX, it goes from 50 to close to 100 stability, and it makes no difference in bullet spread, or it was minimal enough that I did not see the effective bonuses. I would say meh to the gun overall, but for closer encounters, its fine pvp gun, but its really only fighting in closer quarters. It doesnt get up to S or A tier in my opinion.

It has lower range  at 24 when theres plenty of handcannons at 40ish, and new handcannons can get rangefinder and hammerforged to boost it further, this one cannot. Stability is a wasted handcannon perk, recoil direction is what matters. Its nice to drop stability for range, but its aim assist is stilll bad and you cant fix it, no hidden hand roll. The things middle of the road shite, theres much better out there, dont waste ur time.

Your all angry because of a perceived additional cost, whereas bungie is basically giving you something for free to catch old players up, and because the knuckleheads in this community won't look at what is a typical and competitive price for what it is, we are all just outraged and angry at bungie doing the norm. This is just silly and immature. ",2015-06-24 04:40:44+00:00,csgr0ss,1.0,t3_3aug9w,43673.0,DestinyTheGame

2301,"The handcannon is actually best in class base stability, and has much better range than the red hand. With extended mag or high caliber rounds in the middle, it makes the case for a very good pve handcannon. Word of Crotas main downside is that its of the low impact variety. Army of one  on six dreg is way superior to zen moment in pve. Granted the second perk sucks, but in reality so does phantom gift in most situations. Hive disruptor is the real bonus, again situational. I would say six dreg pride is top tier pve handcannon, and should not be passed up.

 I'm just not wanting to shell out 400 for xbox one when I don't think the console is bringing me anything better than ps4. Maybe down the road I will get it, but there seems to be nothing slated for xbox making it worth it. Ps4 is killing them in exclusives.

Private support would be nice, to make tournaments and such, but the game need way more weapon balance first. It's no dealbreaker for me right now. ",2015-06-16 20:08:04+00:00,cs8qw1o,1.0,t3_3a2u5p,136.0,DestinyTheGame
2311,"shotpackage or rangefinder. Rangefinder does give the most range, but shotpackage guarantees a hit with all pellets. Its usually a preference thing. any damage/ range perks such as aggressive or accurized ballistics being the best. Reinforced barrel in the mid column or rifled barrel is the best second. Hammerforge if you have an old one. Then either luck in the chamber or final round. But some people do like the army of one or battle runner but its not a damage increase.
