Here's a short explanation for anyone who doesn't know how it works. Every weapon has a imaginary cone with its tip at the nozzle of the gun. Bullets will land within this cone, because the cone is always getting wider, at longer ranges weapons begin to miss because the cone has gotten too wide. Stacking range narrows the cone, effectively increasing range that the gun is usable, in addition pushing out dmg falloff. 

Why it works for Bungie on handcannons. 

It guarantees that handcannons will never compete outside intended ranges. Bullets will no longer connect to targets outside medium range reliably. Thus they are guaranteed to be reigned in. 

Why its annoying.

Ghost bullets happen, what appears to be hits miss. The bigger issue is without max range, even at closer ranges bullets don't connect. This is why you only see eyaslunas, palindromes, and the occasional imago loop in crucible or pve. 

The compromise.

Make the max range cone that a palindrome or eyasluna gets with rifled barrel the default cone for all handcannons and don't let range change it. It's the same no matter what range you have. 


I think its fair to bungie because it does not buff the best handcannons in the game. The meta does not get changed, and handcannons do not gain an advantage over other guns. 


It works for the player because it will bring reliability to handcannons not at max range. In addition people will have a real choice between damage falloff range and another perk. Maybe I would like a snapshot palindrome for a smaller map, or extended mag/ reload speed for pve without nerfing reliability. It would bring reliability to hawkmoon and thorn without increasing their dmg range, and all the low impact handcannons that have lower range can actually be used without shooting the air to death. 

Of course our friend The Last Word is exempt.

Before strike keys getting random loot from strikes really was a bad method of dolling the stuff out. There was no control over when you got something. You just did strikes for days hoping for the best. 

However when the nightfall came, you could farm out whatever item you wanted. The strike drops were buffed and without any rotation you could farm a specific piece. I farmed the undying mind when it came out and received something like 30 imagos, along with a crap ton of titan marks. all together maybe 60 strike specific drops. That is a whole lot considering the amount of playtime. But I had to wait for it in the rotation. 

Now i get strike keys, which is great, sorta. I grind for the key then spend 10 minutes in the actual strike just to get the item I want. However long it took you to get the key, add 10 min to playtime to just use it. That bothers me, that time really adds up. And the drops are just all over the place. Some people say 1 every 10 minutes, but people often go on 30-40 strike droughts. at about 15 min a strike, 30 strikes is 7.5 hours of playtime. 7.5 hours!!!! that a ton of time with no rewards besides blues.  

Compared to the nightfall, i could play that for 7.5 hours and get 20-30 drops, without spending additional time farming the strike I want to use the key. 

If I could choose now, I would go back to the old system, because the nightfall gave you realistic chances at stuff. The drop rate is terrible now and I wish it would get a realistic change. I have no intention of playing the game for 7 hours, in a loot based! shooter for nothing. Granted I did that last week for the thorn quest and it was terrible. 

Edit: I saw a few weeks ago, either a comment or a post about the same thing and the best idea I saw was what if the keys worked like the raid keys. You got pieces from every strike, and occasionally a key just dropped. Would limit the rng to guaranteed key pieces, but with luck you can get actual keys to drop. Anything to limit rng is good in my opinion. Prevent massive dry spells which I think hurts more than anything else.

I think there are several reasons leading up to this. 

First, nature of the game. Having to collect the crest after a kill for any points to be obtain forces a the need for allies to survive fights. Take team A vs team B. Team A. Team A has 5 competent players (using 5 because most fights hit a max capacity of 5 in a location, usually there are 1 roaming, or someone is dead.) and team B is made of 2 competent players and 3 bad players.  A firefight breaks out at a choke point and Team A takes 5 kills and Team B takes 3. A bit in Teams A favor. But due to crests, the score suddenly becomes not 5 3, but 10 - 0, or maybe 8 -2. Advantages are taken much faster. 

Second is super energy. Picking up the crests gives super. Take the first scenario. Instead of one team having slightly more super, the team A now has double the super because they also got the crests. Team A now has a person get super and lets say nova bomb three people. Another person on A grabs the crests and the orbs. Well he may not have been that close to super but he has it now. Super trains run rampant in the game mode. Theres also no defensive play for super, securing a teamates crest gives no super, only enemy crests give super. 

Third the game favors shotguns over every other type of weapon. Why shotguns? Because you need to get the orb after the kill. Shotguns kill at the closest distance. In order to counter a shotgun you need distance, so you may pick a fusion or sniper, but every bit of distance you create is distance needed to be made up to get the crest. In addition shotguns take the advantage of being extremely effective while charging directly at someone. With the momentum, once you get a kill the pickup is extremely fast. If I use a fusion I am not usually running at someone, I'm going side to side or back pedaling. If i get the kill I have to change directions and that's just time lost getting the crest. 

Shotguns being the most effective weapon for the game along with super chaining had led to some super going completely out of control. Which supers are best? Ones that allow for several kills, can get the kills outside of shotgun range, have armor to tank shots if someone happens to get close enough. Stormcallers and sunbreaker titans. There is nothing more painful than having a stormcaller come through and you not having any counter. Typical counters would be snipers, but no-one has one because its terrible for the game mode. Hunters are totally left out, bladedancer is easily shutdown or traded by shotgun melee (especially them pesky warlocks). Nightstalker doesn't really farm kills at the same rate 3 kills max with quiver, and golden gun gives no armor so all those medium to long range kills don't turn into collected crests. 

All this together creates the total beatdown games. The other team has more good players or God forbit you hit a premade team, and they take the lead early. Anything you as a solo player would do to tip in your favor is negated by being hit be repeated stormcallers and sunbreaker titans. You get hit by repeated supers, your fighting for your life and any great play you pull off for a kill, almost never turns into a collected crest, or immediately gets shutdown by enemy supers. To top it off when heavy round hits, the better team almost always has more supers. 

I hate it, games when your on the good team are just smooth sailing to happy town, on the bad team its the beat down of a lifetime. 

I wish collecting friendly crests gave super energy so there was at least a defensive option to keep up, but right now I don't like how the games play out. There are not many close games, almost always someone wins by 30- 60 crests.

If a tank or a support wants to build tons of armor, then let them. Being unkillable should be a viable choice in the game. The bigger issue I feel is that while being unkillable, they are still able to kill you. The trade off is not enough. 

Rather than nerfing armor, I would prefer base dmg to go down, and dmg scaling to go up. That way If I chose to stack 300 armor, then yes it would be a huge pain to kill me at any point. But my trade off is that I can't kill you, my dmg is sooo incredibly low from not buying dmg items. In turn, carries should be able to do tone of dmg if they choose, but the cost is they become extremely squishy. A really easy target for an assassin.

In order to get them down you have to do, 3 ticks of dmg. Any dmg at all. But as we add more aoe heros, the turrets are unintentionally being downed and Iggy spends 100% of his time replacing turrets. As a result, you start doing less and less dmg in team fights despite what you build. 

Look at the last three heroes, 
Gresytone, his aoe ""make way"" just clears them, no effort. 
The fey, ""untamed growth"" again just clears them away, no effort. 
Narbash seems to be clearing turrets like crazym but im not sure how. Debuffs effecting turret? Not sure. 

Even before aoe of autos from fighters can get more than one turret down. And with the cast and activation time, I find that i spend an entire teamfight just dropping turrets till I run out of mana, none of them really doing antying because they get instacleared. 

This is just my observation, what do you other iggy players think. It would be nice if only direct auto attacks destroyed them, that way it would have to be a choice, not just something any aoe dmg character happens to do, constantly.

And over the past few days, Ive seen an echoing of the same thing in other well supported articles, asking for the same thing. But they keep saying, ""the next character"", or ""make a new character"". And Im here to say to Epic, you don't need to make a new character, you have the characters already, they just need tweeking. 

Look at our friend Howie. He has all the capability of being a good, and an excellent caster with a few tweaks. 

R2000 Missile- The bread and butter of the champ, and I think its should remain this. Currently its on a 11 second cooldown on average. Late game it's dmg is pretty mediocre as is. And its main downside is the stop moving to aim nonsense, that makes chasing down people and maneuvering during a team fight hard. 

I would say, leave the dmg and scaling as is, but drop its initial cooldown from 12.5s to 7s and have its max cooldown drop to 5 seconds. Remove stop to aim, and change it to smart cast like gideons ult. It just shoots where the cursor is. Just like that, you have created consistent dmg output in a caster, not reliant on auto attacks. 

I would not change land mine and slow grenade one bit. They have ok dmg and high cooldowns, they should be reserved for escapes or making big plays, and thats fine. Any lower cooldowns it would be obnoxious to see howie knowck himself around constantly. Or constantly slow people. 

Last the ult. It takes about 1 seconds to jump into the air and aim, then about 4 seconds till the ult impacts. Biggest downside, its 5 seconds total, from the time people realize your going to use it, till the time that the last rocket impacts. That really is a long time. 

A viable rework, First would be make the dmg all on one hit. NO prelim rockets then full dmg, just drop it all into one AOE burst. Second, make the cast time optional. When you jump and aim, if you fire the ult directly below you, it will impact in one second, for reduced by half dmg. If you fire the ult at max range, the impact will do the full amount now, but it will take the 4 seconds of travel time till impact. 

What this does for you is make the ult reliable and consistent. It also increases the skill cap. You make a choice for reduced dmg for a guaranteed hit, or if you have cc or need to head someone off you can at max dmg. 

And just like that howie, wave clears with the missile consistently and doesn't have to rely on auto attacks like a ranger. His dmg is consistent and he is a strong pusher and zoner in lane. In team fights he can do blindingly high burst dmg at a penalty, or reasonable guaranteed dmg if he can't afford to miss. 


This is just one example, but I feel a few tweeks here and there can save our failing characters. We don't need a new mage or assassin added to the game per say, but instead we can fix a current character. THis has two main advantaged, Epic can much more easily fix howie with some adjustments than building a new character, and we all get to test this sooner in the pipeline. 

(Bonus thought of the day, I played lol for a few years, and I just realized while writing this that Howie is literally just a poorly made ziggs. As I wrote this I thought, wow im just recreated a version of ziggs lol)

Well of course rangers are dominating, their auto attacks scale the best. 

By far most fighters have terrible scaling through abilities with high cooldowns. Look at our newest addition, greystone. His abilities are all looking to be .33 scaling. He can't be a true tank, he has basically no cc. He looks like hes supposed to be a bruiser. But why can a bruiser never fight a carry? Because if he uses his abilities to engage, and the carry counters, then you have no escape. You just get whaled on by autos either trying to disengage or chase. That jump is on a ludicrous cooldown, 27- 26 seconds. Look at any of the fighters engages, Grux, 16 seconds, khaimera 20-17 seconds, feng mao, 19 seconds. Then look at the average dmg scaling, .8 for auto attacks, .5 or less for abilities, and 1 or higher for ults. Everyone has the same dmg plus as build because all their dmg comes through auto attacks. 

So what's your point? Noone has low enough cooldowns to make interesting plays. The current meta is build as much dmg as possible then all in, if you don't make the all in you die. All thour dmg comes from your ult then auto attacks, other abilities are really pointless unless its cc or movement. If the carry has someone like dekker or riktor defending them, and they are ahead, its game over. 

Problem 2, all fighters and ""tanks"" who are fighters all build straight dmg. Why? Because there are no assassins and there are no burst mages. Its the natural counter to squishy high dmg targets to get burst down. Noone is every afraid of buing burst down from not building defenses. Rampage, would not be an issue if he had to build defense instead of straight dmg. A real burst mage would kill him before any of his health regen did anything. People would have to defend auto carries because they would be completely burstable as well. Would instantly end this multi aa carry all straight dmg fighter meta immediately. 

This seems plain and obvious to me, but it seems the creator at paragon just don't get it. Nothing they are doing seems to be changing this. There won't be interesting plays and builds until ability scaling trumps auto attack scaling on fighters, and burst mages/ true assassins make the scene. 

Im open to anyone elses opinions, but im tired of this auto attack heavy gameplay, with massively high cooldowns, allowing for low interaction between characters. On a sidenote, its stupid twinblasts op escape is on a lower cooldown of 12 seconds, a good 5 seconds lower than most engages characters have in this game. 

Edit: It seems people all have different opinions on burst mageas and assassins, so I thought I would put in my two cents on what I usually picture them as. 

Assassins - either ability or physical dmg based, can be auto attack or ability focused, but are usually ability focused. Their chief role is 100-0 a squishy character, but they can only do this from a short range, or immediately on top of an opponent. To do this they must have high mobility, to get in, and get out after securing the kill. Chief counter is cc, if they get ""caught"" or stuck, or mis-position during an assassination, they can easily get burst down. They are all in characters. 

Burst Mage- Usually have lower than average mobility. All abilities are dmg focused, with a mix of single target and AOE spells. On an even playing field, They DO NOT 100 - 0 people, but if significantly ahead they have the potential to. The burst mage if they combo all their abilities together can do 50% to 75% of a enemy's characters health all at once. Its valuable because it counters lifesteal and health regen. The counter to burst mages is high health, or armor or magic resist depending on type, to counter this all out assault. Usually have decent wave clear, and are a back line to a team fight, raining down dmg on the front line, and dumping all their dmg and an ult on a caught out fighter or adc to secure a kill.

Well actually yes, they feel like they are where they are. Early game dmg isn't great. Late game they scale well. But even late game they can still get wrecked by assassins and need peel. These are really where they should be. IMO

Mages, well well well, we all know how we feel about this. They were bad, they were good but because of auto attacks, now they are bad again. Well lets face it, they don't do enough through their regular abilities. They all have mediocre mana pools, their cooldowns are high, and all their ults hit like a truck and are aoe. 

I don't understand this class, and I don't understand what Epic wants. They want them to be able to ""wave clear"" and team fights. But its like they don't want this to be a carry position. Most mobas have an ability carry and a aa carry. Epic seems like they want mages to be some type of support, that zones for a team fight. Most of the community, does not like this, and would like to see ability carries. I don't see this taking shape until basic abilities, mana, and cooldowns get a buff. Granted if this happended ults would have to be nerfed a certain degree. I don't know what epic has planned, but I wish it would be simething significant. 

Assassins, high dmg, low health. Deal it in bursts. I think the key word is ""Burst"" there are very few champs who come close to true burst. Why? because there are not melee champs outside khallari who actually do all their dmg outside of auto attacks. The closest I find is feng mao. But his slow and shield and blink all have average scaling, not over one 1 scaling. He bursts some with his ult, but it still comes down to auto attacks for the majority of kills. Theres no real ability based characters that are melee, and I personally hate this. Granted Feng mao as an assassin, does his job well. Even late game you can jump a aa carry and wreck him. They in essence do the job well. 

Tanks? well there are none, and this goes with fighters. Everything is in the ""fighter class"" and it ruins the game more than anything else in my opinion. What are tanks? Ideally they provide cc or health shields, but they put out low dmg. But in this game, They Look at riktor, look at rampage. They have good cc, and can get an excessive amount of tankiness, while keeping a certain modicum of dmg that i feel is excessive. People are upset that rampage is an unkillable diving monster, with cc, but im not at all. What im upset about is his ability to kill people while being this giant health tank. Thats the problem. Tanks are not actually being pushed into the tank roll. They are just bruisers, with excessive amounts of health. This I think is the most unhealthy thing for this game right now. 

These are just some quick thoughts, Id like to hear what others see the future of ""roles"" morphs into. 

Last but not least, a role should be a guideline. All casters should not have the same amound of aa dmg and scaling. All caster ults shouldn't scale the same, or all be aoe. Same for all fighers, or all aa carries. Allow variety, and let the heroes be unique.

And yes, I know with fast travel leaving things will definitely change and people won't get to towers as fast most likely. 

First, I think theres too few minions. The previous amount was too much, but really theres too few now. I would add at least one more laser minion to the wave. They were instrumental in waves being built up. Right now it seems they always stagnate, lanes have a tendency not to push at all. 

Second, i wish minion health scaled less. In that mid game rut, it always seems that my full dmg character, in most cases feng mao, who has decent clear still takes too long to get a wave down to get it to the tower. I feel like it would be a great benefit to closing out games if I could run ahead, and completely clear the wave before my wave gets there and loses any health. But this never seems to be the case. 

Third, and this one is a maybe, I feel like the waves should come just slightly faster. I always get the feeling that my wave get cleared by the tower, and I'm just sitting there doing nothing till the next wave comes. It would be nice if there was a better pushing item to make minions move faster. I currently grab killdozer horn, (minions do more physical dmg) because it fits the build nicely and its helpfull for the split push. But I wish there could be an item that did more for that. 

What are other people's thoughts. I just can't get consistency for taking towers even when ahead. Before the minion change it was too easy, especially early game.

Heres a vid someone posted may 28th, this year. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoFaNB28zb8#t=6m55s

I think theres a clear difference in how long it takes to do something after blink. He melees rather quickly, vs right now, you cant shoot or do anything till you almost hit the ground. 

Heres blink without quickdraw... its terrible. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PvM888_t-M 

You basically do nothing till you actually hit the ground. 

I don't have any before this patch clips so I found one online that I hoped demonstrating the difference. If anyone else has a before this patch of comparison of blink, not in the super it would be appreciated.

And /u/cosmo dutifully replied to the post butignored the comments about the blink. NO I am not mad at him or begrudge him, i understand that before he should reply to something like that he needs to find out whats actually going on. But I would like to have some kind of response on whether or not its a glitch, intentional or what. 

But I for one have felt the nerf and it really affects blink. Its getting to the point that blink is just becoming one of the worst choices, and in terms of mobility, things like titan skating are really starting to outclass it which I find silly as titans are supposed to be the least mobile class with the lowest agility stats. Unfortunately without bones, all the other hunter jumps are pretty lackluster. Triple jump is ok, but its all verticle, in terms of map travel, theres nothing good on the hunter besides bones and control jump. If bungie is going to make blink just terrible, I understand a little, but then the other jumps need some kind of buff. That includes warlocks, I only play the voidwalker because of blink, without it i don't like floofing about, it sucks. So ya some clarification, and maybe some jump/floof related fixes are in order.

Game is won, I mean won. But im playing with the greatest set of dumbest inexperienced moba players ever. Whats the next play? push the last inhibitor while the other lanes push. When they send people to defend the core, you take the last inhib. Pretty standard moba stuff, close out the game. 

But noo, no, no, no, no. Peopel ignore the group and push commands and just roam around doing whatever tf they want. ONe guy runs for orb prime, while another runs off to randomly farm till he gets ganked. The orb prime guy tries to dunk it solo and dies giving it to the other team. And from then on out its downhil, noone will group for a team fight, noone will do anything. They get all their inhibs bakc and boom, we get our asses kicked all the way to the end because the other team can group more than 3 people together. 

The fact that I can't explain to people how to close out the game, or explain a strategy on ps4, when we have so many beginners who need to learn crucial information is just wrong. TO me this should be the next fix over everything else. Nothing has ever been do frustrating.

Now as it is, it is extremely hard to lane any kind of melee character against ranged characters. In my experience if you are in the unfortunate scenario of being melee against some type of range you can't get to, or are behind to, you defensively farm under turret. In paragon this is a nightmare unless you are grux and can pull the minions in. Any attempt to get close enough results in you just getting pummeled by basic attacks or in some case spells. In addition, due to how the turrets work, if they mistep into turret range, it's hardly punishing. They have time get back out before they are hit, and the dmg is pretty lackluster in alot of cases. 

Basically im afraid many of the melee characters or tanks are going to be stuck in terrible lanes. Where even if they don't die, they just get heavily outfarmed. 

Really I just wish the tower range was slightly larger, or maybe the caster minon range shorter so that they get into the turrets range more. Nothing worse than not being able to clear a bunch of caster minions form your own turret without just getting pummeled. 

We have to see what happens, but this is just an anticipatory thought. ",paragon,"With all the changes coming, can we talk tower dmg and range?",https://www.reddit.com/r/paragon/comments/4nolaa/with_all_the_changes_coming_can_we_talk_tower_dmg/

And well, none of the true casters really feel up to par, and feel more like they do ""support"" dmg vs true carry like dmg. Gideon, Howitzer and gadget all feel like they should be settling into this ap carry type roll but can't live up to it. 

Gideon: passive is fin, the wave clear is good, but only on cosmic rift, which is good dmg and utility. His blink seems to fall off hard late game(granted its usually the ability i don't rank in favor of dmg. and his slow is ok, but does miserable dmg, has bad scaling and barely operates outside of aa range. Then theres that miserable ult. The dmg is fantastic with great scaling, but it takes forever to come out, often making get melted before you can kill other people, can get interupted, and most aa carry's can walk or jump out without dying then initiate outside of your ults range. He needs cooldowns for any type of consistency, i find his versatilty goes way up when he can get several blinks off and reposition mroe often. 

Howitzer: Have I ever used a more clunky kit in a moba? Passive, good in team fights, not much use elsewhere. Slow grenade, does what its supposed to do, but its range is really meh... and its a tad awkward. r2000, the rocket, I really like this ability, except that it makes you stop to shoot it, it is so frustrating to try and chase down an opponent and your only long range shot forces you to stop? its stupid as hell. cool it works mid air though. land mine, one of the most useful abilities in the game, whats the problem? you have to use it defensively, has poor scaling and basically is just a long cooldown repositioning tool. like gideon, great aoe dmg, great scaling, but it takes forever to activate, and forever to dish out the dmg, with all the dmg backloaded, the re-positioning is great. You get a full ult out? fantastic, when does that happen? only if you have people like dekker hanging around. his kit has all the pieces but it doesn't flow, and it takes forever to dish out. 

Gadget: can my abilities get places slower? passive: useful for pushing and farming but her kit doesn't have near the potential of iggy and scorch. seek and destroy, sure slow an enemy and dish out dmg at a surprising slow pace, that is if they don't take a step to the side at any point to simply avoid it with ease. sticky mine, the ""bread and butter"" of the kit, good dmg and scaling, but its slow, has a high cooldown and then takes a whopping 4.5 seconds more to detonate. its painful to use, and if you stick someone theres no dmg for another 4.5 seconds! thats forever especially late game. Speed gate, usefull in alot of ways, dmg and scaling is trash, should just give more movement and skip the dmg. and there the ult, good dmg, good scaling, big aoe, but very avoidable, rarely get the full dmg off.... starting to sound familiar?

The bottom line is I'm no moba god or anything, but I feel all the caster kits are clunky, slow, and have all their dmg tied up in some aoe ult thats fairly hard to get full dmg out of. I have never played a game where I was like of hell, blank caster is coming through the jungle solo, I better run... The kits have fairly low kill potential in lane and in team fights are mostly countered by walking away for a second to avoid most of the dmg. In addition the range and travel speed of most abilities is lacking, and can't even compete with aa range chamions. At max range they are very easy to dodge, at close range you get way out burst for dmg. I find it exceptionally difficult to pressure aa carrys at any point of the game. IN addition every single one feels like they have to build cooldowns no matter what. and I mean try to hit the cdr cap to be useful, the cooldowns are really high, as so are the mana costs especially early game. 

SO ya in my limited experience they feel very meh. Supports feel strong and I like iggy and scorch as that bruiser caster, but the range casters are not really there.

Got one character to rank 3 then switched characters. Played wearing no shader, emblem, or class item for Iron banner, and did not turn in bounties. Later in the week I even started deleting the dumb medallions to slow progress more. And what did it get me? 0 , a big fat 0 Finnala's perils. Two characters at 3, a third almost to rank 3 part way through two, and I have nothing to show for it. 

What exactly is the point of Iron banner? At one time it was, hey the only way to reroll, made it pretty special, drop rates didn't even matter got one and you were gold. Later it was a way for pvp people to get max light if they had raid trouble. Now its not either, its a way just to get exclusive gear that's available for a week. But you know what? It's not that either. It's just a way for me to play pvp for an entire week, purposely underleveling in order to grind out something that just isn't going to drop. 

So tell me bungie? Did I play Iron Banner right? Or am I missing something.  Why do we even have Iron banner if you can't even get the Items during that week. I could go further and ask whats the point of regular pvp as well, nothing drops in that barren desert either. This is literally the most frustrated I have been with this game ever.

But lets imagine I work for x or run x popular youtube, or x gaming website and I want to show off the latest and greatest. But latest and greatest is behind a paywall to get it fast. 

Look at the new system, you get 3 packages a week unless you buy. (correct me if im wrong, but that was my understanding.) Chances of you getting a full set are actually super low. You get 3 things, but from a pool of several armor sets on different races, making a full set in any timely way is really low. Now I want this to show off to my viewers, but its competative, I don't want to wait 3 weeks - 2 months to complete my set. So I buy, and I buy a lot. 

It's scary because I just went over to check out Blops 3 because thats what people are comparing it too, and its scary watching streamers and youtubers literally spend thousands on packages to be able to get certain content out first. I guess its a cost of living in their case, but I can't help feeling like when these boxed things are made, its because the developers know that even if the community sales arn't stellar, anyone who is a content site for their game in some way is dumping significant money on it. 

But in destiny's case I'm very torn. We can see the money being actively used by to fund free updates like this one. And in that case, the money I spent on SLR seems worth it. What comes around goes around, and if bungie makes it feel more fair. Same with emotes, I don't need them, but it just makes the game fun when I use the one I picked. However if Im making content for the game, me and all my streamer buddies are likely going to have to buy some of the emotes to keep relevant. 

COD scares the shit out of me, rnging for in game weaponry that could actually make you better at pvp. I really don't want bungie to take that path, and it would be curious to see if the community can put on the pressure if they step wrong. 

Slippery slope is the word I see tossed around and I agree. We have 8 years left, I don't want year 10 to be a nightmare.

However I found the  exact opposite, it seems to make the accuracy a good bit worse.

Originally I was in the crowd saying, I want in game matchmaking yadi yadi ya, but I have begin to sing a different tune. 

Originally I bounced around through different lfg sites, Ive used destiny team finder, i have used destiny lfg, and destiny lfg.net, I have used reddit fireteams. And the nice thing is that the different communities have vastly different personas attached to them. 

Destiny lfg, the both of them tend to be very elitist. We don't accept unless you have x, we don't accept unless you have 900 clears or whatever. Personally hate these two sites, full of teens who think they are God's gift to gaming, who rage quit and flip out if the first run goes badly, or a trials match goes south. 

Destiny team finder is very much the teen crowd, and heavily the foreign crowd. I have played with brits, irish, croations, and saudis from this site. This is the one I used the most, and still often use for raids. I thoroughly enjoy playing with people not from the states in raids, makes for a fun change, and my first successful trials run was completed with a saudi arabian guy. Great fun. People here are usually nice, but the talent is very much hit or miss. 

r/fireteams- im sure this subs favorite and one of my own. Its usually the older crowd, im in my mid 20's and most people here are that or a little higher up. Most people are relaxed, chill, and don't have bad tempers. Trials teams here are always great, even without a win its fun. 

So what's the point? Having the different lfg groups allows me to find a community I a happy to return to. For me is r/fireteams and destiny team finder. If we had a in game matchmaking, different communities could not form. It would be a giant blob of the hardcore, the chill, the international, with no way to really sort or find the type of crowd I like to play with. The different sites allow this and now I really enjoy looking for my next pug group, instead of dreading the search. Things have changed a lot for me how I have found my groups, but in the last few months I've found the ""magic"" of lfg sites, and never want the in game matchmaking. 

Edit: typing is hard

Edit2: People are asking why still can we not have optional in game matchmaking. I can't prove my thoughts because we don't have it, but I think it would have inevitably hurt communities forming. If Destiny had a in game lfg, I would have never looked outside the game. In fact the idea was novel to me coming to desiny. I had in years passed used the WoW in game matchmaking and never even thought of using outside sources. I don't think r/fireteams and destiny team finder would be as unique, as populated and delightful a place to visit if in game matchmaking had existed from the start. I think forcing these communities to form has arisen to desirable communities, where the in game matchmaking would have hindered this. Instead we would have a frontpage of regular matchmaking complaints about the in game system, and people asking for a fix, when in reality, there would be no way to reign in a in game lfg to fit everyone wishes. I sincerely think that no in game LFG for endgame content was the best choice, and has led us to a better place than had it been initially put there.

2. You have susanoo, or the thesan fr4. One always has braced frame, the other is available with rolls every few weeks.

And I noticed the strangest thing. Sure there were the icebreakers and invectives and sidearms jumping out in round one, but there were so many people who opted for not starting with ammo. Just sitting there with their 1000yrd stare or conspiracy theory equipped.

To this I was shocked, quite literally. I understand not using icebreaker, because your not a silly try hard nub, or not using invective, it takes some time to charge. But there is never not a good reason to run a sidearm first round. Even teams in games 5-7 were doing this nonsense.

So heres your round one tips, for those smart enough to pick the sidearm.

1. check your opponents loadouts till the last second. I don't fiddle with mine, I just leave my sidearm there, because I assume they are doing the same, checking.

2. If they opt to not have starting ammo, push hard with your teams sidearms. Within proper range, it will beat almost anything, last word being the only real exception.

3. Winning round one should be a priority, and winning quickly. If they opted to not have special, round one, they won't have it round 2 if you make the round a quick one.

4. Use grenades effectively, especially aoe ones/lightning/skips. Without special ammo, its very hard to punish a hard rush. Especially if you dump grenades and come flying in with your sidearm. I personally love tossing a skip, and just blinking or sliding in, to 1 or 2 shot whomever it hit.

5. rez, rez, rez. You almost never get rez sniped/shotgun melee rez killed first round, prioritize rezing and make sure your helmet has angel of mercy.

Finally Win the round and swap weapons in the interim, or keep that sidearm. (personally I can never recommend it post round 1 for the same reason I never run a fusion. It can't rez kill effectively, making it a bad choice for trials.)

Edit: formatting

0 points, the anger about sidearms first round then switch is rather incredible. Whether or not you're upset doesn't seem to be a good reason to downvote advice how to use the sidearm first round, but oh well................

I think almost everyone can agree, primary weapons in general are ehhehe meh. Not great. Notable exceptions being TLW, Dop, and Mida. Note I am firmly in the camp that mida and Dop are not op, but in the ideal range ttk wise, but TLW performs a little too well IMO, not much just a little. 

But so what? What do we do? Currently the issue has become snipers are extremely prevalent, and have little to no way to challenge by most weapons. Do we nerf snipers? Some say yes, others no. Personally I would be ok if thousand yrd stare variety impact class was removed,  and all of them were pushed up into the black spindle impact class. Punishing if you miss, but still res snipe, do massive body dmg. 

But lets look at primaries. Buffs would be nice, especially accuracy for handcannons, faster TTK for all of the non -Dop variety auto rifles. Stuff we all can agree on. But will it be enough to challenge sniper rifles, make it not such an easy choice for a secondary. 

Well perhaps the answer lies in the perks. There are plenty of perks that I feel like don't do enough, but if they did it would be much more interesting. 

First and foremost, bungo has to stop designing weapons where you absolutely need stability to do anything with them. Look at DOP, absolute garbage without braced frame. Theres too many guns that need stability to do anything meaningful in the crucible. 


High caliber rounds/ explosive rounds. - Both great items for increasing shake of your opponents. However they cause accuracy loss. I think taking accuracy loss off would be an exciting move. Currently with weapons your already losing much needed stability by not picking braced frame, perfect balance. I think these would see an exciting return with the downside removed. In addition it would be a great way to challenge snipers with that additional shake. 

Lightweight- +2 agility. and single point sling, boost to ready and away by 50%, increase in movespeed. 

I think single point sling should not increase movespeed, instead 100% ready and away. Lightweight needs to be pushed up to +3 or maybe +4. being very fast would be an interesting choice over stability if it meant you could quickly duck in and out, and zoom by gaps faster than you can get sniped. 

But what else? Make more powerful perks like this exclusive to primary weapons. Differentiate more what primaries and special weapons can get. 

There are many possibilities for perks, but bungie seems to sit in the make bad perks camp. Things like graverobber or casket mag should not be in the game. Ive tried but the stability hit is just too much to ever run casket mag, especially when its always just a few bullets over extended mag. 

I think bringing more interesting and powerful perks to primary weapons could be the answer to increasing power without forcing the TTK down. Some things like HC stability are needed, and low ROF autos just need a slightly better ttk, but for everything else, why not make the game more interesting. Provide us with interesting choices for power, not just changing the dmg.

This way in 22 weeks (5.5 months), if you raid constantly on the same character, your guaranteed drops at max level. You have to raid constantly for 5 months to guarantee max level, but at least along the way there is always progression. Your never at 315 getting a 300 item or a worthless 310 from hard mode. This way we always push forward, granted slowly, but your guaranteed to get there as long at you put in your raid time every week, and get the completion. Raiding is meaningful, and you never feel like it was a complete waste. On the plus side for bungo, we play, every week, and we never feel like were not progressing.

I love this game though because of the interesting and new experiences the exotics bring. However I contend only one aspect of exotics are an issue. 

Lets list all of the broken exotics, or at least broken at one point. 

Suros Regime- exotic ability, high increase in dmg in second half of mag, heal on kill sometimes in second half mag, shoots faster longer held down. 

Hawkmoon- bnus dmg on random bullets

Thorn- bonus dmg, applied as burn to stop recovery

The Last Word - hip fire accuracy, fires faster in hip fire, bonus dmg in hip fire. 

Gjallahorn- tracking rounds, that nearly double the dmg of the weapon. 

Vex mythoclast- in its own dmg archetype, just outshot everything at one point. 

Seeing the pattern? Anything that just slaps bonus dmg on it ruins the weapons. Its about time they kept exotics to doing something special, something not flat dmg bonuses. I think this is the hill that the balance team can't get over. Exotics are cool, but really its about interesting gameplay, not just flat dmg. Im ok also with them having good stats. Best example is mida, its a fun gun, and its stats are great. But it technically does not have a faster ttk over its archetype. Same kill time as a High Road soldier or one/one synesthete.

Look at NTTE, infinite ammo, great idea. But it only falls short due to its lack of stability. (psst bungo, take out fitted stock, throw on braced frame)

How about queenbreakers bow, fun gun, got travel time in trade for lots of ammo. cool weapon.

Its all about how the weapon plays. what its like. How does it make the game interesting? Does it change my play style? 

Honestly with what I hope is a handcannon buff, changes need to be made. TLW already fires faster than any other HC, it needs to have the hip fire dmg removed. It will always be too strong with it. THorn? It needs to remove shield regen caused by a debuff, not just continuously apply dmg. 

Hawkmoon Hawkmoon Hawkoon, I don't know. Its ""balance"" is dictated by rng. It may be the only gun I say, let it still two shot sometimes... But im torn, and have no idea what to do. 

But start pulling bonues dmg and stick to healing, agility, ammo refund, or interesting things like telesto delayed explosion. But stop dropping dmg on weapons and breaking them.

[edit] TLDR; exotics are cool. most of them are good. I think they did a good job on 90% of them. But any that have flat dmg increase need the dmg increases removed. And flat dmg should not be the exotic perk on any weapon.

I don't understand what causes it, but its a big issue that needs fixing. That's all on you bungie, I really don't understand what causes that. 

Now lets look at the issues with the class as a whole. 

Pros!

1. They have good dmg per a shot. Allows you to dip in and out of cover dropping out bursts of dmg. 

2. Most have competative TTK's. 

Con!
Everything else. 

lol but really. 

1. For the PVE crowd mostly, whats up with reserve ammo, it sucks compared to everything else. Add a few clips in there please. 

2. For PVE and PVP, create guns with higher base reloads. I can use almost every other weapon type without reload gauntlets if I need to. Running Shotgun loader of something else doesnt hurt so much on other weapons, but theres no such thing as using a HC without HC gauntlets. It's so painful to reload most of them. 

3. Range. The nerf was really hard on these guns. Why? because of significant TTK increases. The imago loop class, the red hand, the fulcrum, eyasluna, the most popular one for ages was just that because it could one headshot two body shot opponents. Why was this so important? because HC's are unlike most other weapon types, they dont put out a flinching hail of bullets like ars or pulses. They are like close range scouts, except scouts are super accurate and hcs have magic bullets. But in the hayday of the AR, as long as you got the first headshot, it was competative to fight things like ARS whos flinch storm made most followup headshots hard to do. 

But now due to the range nerfs, at most ranges this impact class will not kill with one headshot 2 body shot. You often leave a guardian with a sliver of health. And then suddenly boom, your gun is not competitive at all.

As a result the only competative hcs and the only ones you see used are the imago loop, eyasluna, and finnalas peril. All three above 35 base range. After finnalas 37 range you drop way down to 25 range which just sucks. 

Well Why not just get more range. (see points 2 and 4. base stability and reloads are poor, which you have to give up.)

4. FOUR! (reddit keeps making my 4 a 1?) Increase base stability. Most base stabilities sit at around 35ish. Pretty low. Exceptions are the Vanity, uffern HC4, down and doubt, eyasluna. Vanity and HC4 has a whopping 70, but with no rangefinder roll and low range at 24, and terrible aim assist at 41 and 50 respectively, whats the point. Eyasluna is a crowd favorite for a reason, good range, good stability. However with the crap crucible drop rates, ive maybe gotten 2-3 in 6 months, and theres no way to farm it. 

So really what your looking at is a rifled barrel (range for reload), rangefinder, sights and 3rd perk up to you, Handcannon. All omolons cannot roll rangefinder, so they are for the most part obsolete. Leaves imago, eyas and finnalas. But as is eyas and finnalas are mostly unfarmable. imago loop is, but I think its only been farmable 2 nfs all year 2. 

Bottom line is that all Handcannons now need range like AR's and pulses need stability. However to top it off, reload time, stability, and range for most of them is just bad. 

Even if bungie decides, handcannons are working as intended, might I suggest these changes. Increase base stats on new handcannons. Really anything below 30 range is just bad. Allow rangefinder to be rolled on all handcannons. Don't make any HC's with less than 8 rounds (gaherid-D, 7 rounds no mag increasing perks besides triple tap. eww) Allow the reserve ammo to be higher. Fix magic bullets!

There alot of bad handcannons, only eyas, finnalas, and imago are decent.

Granted due to the current garbage loot system that totally irritates the hell out of me causing complete inability to get some weapons, let alone ones with a good roll, there are plenty of weapons I have not tried yet.

Basically is you start with a sidearm then switch between rounds you get sniper or shotgun bullets, a full clip. 

Bungo didn't limit special ammo, they just increased my need to swap weapons in rounds. Talk about dumb and more pointless work that does not add to the game. 

Edit: I wanted to add that there are some implications to starting sidearms every round. Its a close range weapon, it means that it pairs well with a scout or pulse but not ars and HCs. Due to this don't be surprised if every match starts with all mida ( or other top tier scout)/sidarm before switching to actual load outs the next round. It's just gonna make the game stale, and create added work.

2. shotgun melee, always trades because of the melee nature of the super. And melee that generates a shield plus shotgun always wins. 

I think the elegant solution that will fix most of this and not change the super much is to let the super cast its abilities while in the air. The biggest issue I think is that you actually have to be on the ground to cast the super abilities. This way even if the hit detection doesnt work, you can always just cast the aoe damage component, which already costs more energy and will get that person your not quite on to. Or you cast the one that runs along the ground and it drops from your position directly down. then travels forward. And pve, omg can you imagine being able to cast invis before you hit the ground. It would be so much more valuable.

There's quite a few posts about how ""good"" the Iron banner drops are now, and while they are in fact better, lets take a moment to look at how ""good"" they are compared to the previous Iron Banners and the game in General. 

Rewind, lets go back to the beginning. Vanilla Destiny's legendary drop system was similar to now. NO rerolling, and legendaries were acquired purely through RNG. Lets take a look about, consider what legendaries were prime weapons to have in the game? They were all raid legendaries. Outside a few outliers, vendor shadow price, The Devil you know (don't? they always confuse me), vendor New monarchy Auto rifle, it was all about getting raid weapons. They were the place to get competative weaponry. As a result It was all about running the raid for loot. 


Then there was Iron Banner, some good weapons some bad, but rerolling made a few just perfect. Just like a perfectly rolled vendor weapons, everyone could now have a perfectly rolled Iron banner gun. The shotgun and sniper being the most sought after. 


Then comes the dark below, not much has changed. We are all running after the coveted raid weapons, they are the loot to get. Sure theres some good vendor weapons here and there, maybe a well rolled such and such, but in general great legendaries came from the raid. 

Next we hit HOW. What a dynamic shift. Two important changes to the legendary meta came about.

 1. The End game content legendaries from POE are for the most part, really bad. Outside the sniper, that was still outclassed by other popular legendaries, there just wasn't anything worth getting. 


2. But we have rerolling, really we don't care that POE weapons are garbage, because we can make any legendary we want good. 

What major shift in playing did this make? For the first time players are actively farming strikes to get a specific legendary. The hop scotch pilgrim farm was real. And it was hard to get, but if you could get one, then you could make it fantastic. Even bad vendor guns could be rerolled into something decent. However Bungie did not compensate for the fact that some guns became entirely too strong. Mostly shotguns. Shotpackage was an overwhelmingly good perk. 

Now for the important part, when rerolling was a thing, think how many dropped weapons you kept with the rolls they actually dropped with. Its prob close to 0. Then think how much rerolling occurred. Tons, some weapons I rerolled 100 times just like other people. The reason? with the amount of perks possible roll combinations were in the thousands. 

Why is this important? Because it's a fundamental shift in loot acquisition. End game content legendaries lost all importance, mostly because they were just bad, and loot in the wild suddenly became highly desired. 

Trials of Osiris shows its head, and boom we have end game content guns that are good, and all other legendaries you find can be good as well. What a great time it was, so many guns to try out, perk testing and so much more. But the flaws in the system also were running rampant. Felwinters style shotguns and final round snipers were becoming increasingly dominant due to availability. THings had to change. 

We hit TTK and we see the changes. Rerolling is cut. Frankly I insist this was the wrong choice, the flaw wasn't in rerolling the flaw was in the fact the perk combinations existed at all. Other cahnges happened, shot package was removed, something I entirely agree with, final round was headshot only. Same things, good moves. But the pull from rerolling has moved the legendary economy to how it was back in vanilla. IF the vendor doesn't have that roll, then neither do you. 

So what do we do? Do we go back to raiding for the best legendaries? NO, in fact Bungie has given the worst end game pve weapons to date. Can I turn to Iron Banner? Well no not there either.  

Lets talk Iron Banana specifically. Rerolling was pulled. Now they put in Nirwens mercy near god roll, and in this one bretomarts stands roll was good. In addition to throwing in some plus 310 loot at rank 5. But how good is that really? One peice of infusion material? Really not that great. A really well rolled gun to buy, yest thats fantastic. But what happens when that gun isn't a perfect roll like Nirwens? Then your looking at this Iron banners Finnalas peril. The roll is pretty bad. So we do what bungie said and play the game to get one. But lets look at the odds. Theres 65,000 possible rolls on that gun. But lets consider I don't care if every node is perfect. I want one of the top node sights, so other nodes under don't matter. I want a perk in node 2 to be set right. I really only need the botton node in row 3 to be right. and node 4 I have 2 options I think are viable. THat still leaves me at 1170 rolls possible. Now lets look at  drop rates. Everyone gets different things cus RNG. I got close to 10 chest peices and only 1 gun so far. But lets assume that we have near perfect RNG. I wanted HC's I got nothing but HC's. AN unrealistic scenario, but lets say I got an extrememly generous 15 Handcannons during all my iron banner time THis week. That gives me a  0.012 chance at getting a gun I want. Thats just horrible. 

This is the Placebo. We went from close to 0 drops to 15 drops, with a few guaranteed ones along the way, and everyone is praising the generosity of Bungie because its better. But In the big grand scheme of things, the current game is the worst ever for acquiring legendary weapons. I simply cannot get a good finnalas peril unless bungie is selling it directly to me because of the odds. 

But it really isn't just Iron Banner, the entire game economy is like this. Let's look at strike specific drops. Say it's omnigul this week, and I want a grasp of malok. Ignoring the monstrous total rolls of having every perk the way you want, lets look at one ideal roll possibility. OAS, counter balance, braced frame, third eye. (don't care if you think another roll is better just an example)  Thats 3960 total rolls. I farm omnigul during nightfall like a madman and grab 30. That's a 0.0075 chance at the gun I want. Talk about horrible odds. 

And you may think, how can this not have been addressed before? Well its simple before HOW, noone cared about legendary drop rates outside of weapon parts and mats. The best weapons were the raid weapons. When the end game weapons got bad, you could reroll, so in reality you only needed one weapon to drop. 

Bet we are here, today in TTK, and Im telling you now, Iron banner drop rates are not nearly high enough to introduce any type of variety in the game, and neither are any of the legendary drops anywhere. And the evidence is clear. What Nirwens mercy are you using? THe one that you bought. Which version of any legendary are you using? Is is the vendor hung jury? Is it something that was literally given to you and everyone else from the gunsmith? I bet yes. Vendor 100yd stare? Most likely. 

The problem with iron banner legendaries and any legendaries in the game is that good rolls are so incredibly low that prob less that 1% of the destiny population has anything worth using from a drop. Sure we feel better with these few items here, oh its great I got infusion material, but in reality its a very stagnant legendary weapon field. 

Frankly, I think that all legendary weapon rates  drops need to be tripled and the dismantling of legendaries need to give only 1 mark to conpensate. Looking back at the grasp of malok example, say I got 90 instead, my chances would jump closer to 0.02, still bad but betterish. 

TL;DR. The game economy needs a serious fix. All the legendaries being used are bought from a vendor in some way. Legendaries dropping in the wild have a horrible drop rate considering the chances at a good roll. Iron banner drops are still horrible considering that rerolling is gone. Ignore the placebo, look at the facts. Unless bungie sells it to you, the chances of a good legendary roll is almost always 0.01 or less. You might get a good one in the next 15yrs....

The loot pool is actually really small right now. In HOW there was an entire year worth of weapons and two raids worth, but they are all gone now. I didn't really think about it at the time, but when the loot pool of options drops so much, is not surprising we are all using the same things, because there just isn't that much choice.

 It seems Destiny is going to go through cycles, with the summer being always the best time for destiny if they stay on a yearly set up. Every fall will be ""new stuff"" but the content pool will always be smaller with stuff left behind. Year two infusing will continue with whatever christmas/ early 2016 release, then hopefully summer release. Making the summer to late summer being the most diverse and interesting destiny will be as far as weapons go.

Hopefully we get another content release soon, don't care if its a raid, I just want more interesting exotic armor and weapon choice, new weapon sets and things to play around with.

I get it people don't like rerolling in general, supposedly it ""breaks the game"" which I entirely disagree with, the game is already broken if a op roll exists. But that aside, its really hard to get weapons with rolls I like. I dismantle 90% of everything these days. 

But i want to look at the case that bugs me the most. I want an Imago loop. Every few days I stop and just farm 5-10 of the echo chamber strike. I only takes 5:30 to run the full strike, pretty quick runs. I have had 0 drop. I know rng yaya, plenty have one, but lets look further. 

Lets look at possible rolls for the imago loop. 
There are 2 for the first scope, 2 for the second scope. Third is set at quickdraw. 

Second column perk has 13 possible rolls. (complete side note, so many of these perks suck, can we start getting rid of sucky perks and only have meaningful ones?)

Third column has 5 choices in the top and 10 choices in the middle. Bottom is pve dmg bonuses by type, I will never use them and don't care.

4th column has 10 rolls. 

Doing the math thats, 2X2X13X5X10X10, for a grand total of 26,000 possible roll combinations. (someone check my math, but that seems right) That's a shit ton of rolls, like too many. But say, im a poor beggar and not a chooser, and I say, I can settle with whatever scope is given. 6,500 rolls. Damn. Well all i absolutely want is the first column right, the row second column and the third column. Thats 13X10X10.  Well ok 1300 possible rolls. Not as bad. 

But think about it, where am I going to get anywhere near 1300, imago loops. Where Am I only going to get 10? With drop rates as they are, its so hard to get multiple of anything. Lets say, the echo chamber shows up as a nightfall, and I farm all week. Massive time investment. I get say 10. (people have crazy drop rate differences. Some people got capes for days on the flayers, i got 0 capes in 20ish runs.) Still 10 divided by 1300 is a 0.007 chance of getting what I want. I mean really. A year of getting 10 handcannons form the nightfall each week, 120 guns out of 1300, gets me a 0.09 chance at the gun I want. 

Bungie whatever the solution is, if not rerolling, then massive drop rate increases or perhaps removal of wasted perks, or even let us pay a fee to change one perk slot per a gun, putting the odds slightly in our favor. I don't know. But its so horribly weighted against us right now. Rerolling countered these odds, but its gone. What do I do now.

Side note, everyone has a good hawksaw, wonder why? The perk set up is much better on the suros style weapons. To get a hammerforged, counterbalance, smallbore/handlaid stock, whatever your preference gun and you don't care about the sight, its only a 1/320 chance to get it.  4 perks to choose on hammerforged, 16 to choose on counterbalance, and 5 to choose on smallbore/handlaid stock. 4X16X5 = 320. Really since 3 stability perks are all really enough its 4X16X3= 192. Talk about great odds. But grasp of malok is 1/792 in chances of perfect desired roll in 3 columns. The set ups are completely unfair. Pulses are not only good, but have much better chances at perfect rolls than handcannons as is. 

NTTE: drop rate % are so extremely low for certain rolls is ridiculous and should be addressed in some way. Discrepancy between different weapons chance at a great roll is really high as well. RNG, is fine, but There should be some kind of realistic expectation at getting a certain gun. 

Edit: stars do not work as multiply symbols.

Logged plenty of hours and play 5-7 days a week. I've tried hard mode, but not finished, Oryx defeated me in the end. Got ToM, but havnt got back in, mostly a pvp player here. I know many people, mostly streamers complained about the lack of content in HOW. But frankly, I didn't hit the too little content point until the last month, but then I was having fun in trials, finally beating skolas and hitting those accomplishment that I found hard in Destiny, mostly because i have no friends who play, i PUG literally everything.

I have two thoughts I want to share. 

1. Hitting level cap fast was not a problem. I still spend ages grinding out a perfectly rolled armor sets for different builds. Grinding out multiple weapons with multiple rolls. Some things I didn't get till right before the end, remember the hopscotch pilgrim grind? There was stuff still was there to get. 

2. Rerolling does not break balance. In fact it creates more balance. Every roll is attainable by everyone. I hate that some people can get a perfect roll, and others can grind for months and maybe get 3-4 of the guns and none of them are an Ideal roll. I recently started grinding for an imago loop, (i have an unhealthy handcannon obsession even if they are not great, please don't tell me its not worth it, I still want one.). But plenty of hours of doing the strike and still havent had a drop. How many times will I have to do it, to get a drop I want. Maybe a few thousand time? Theres a couple thousand possibilities for the weapon even without the sights roll included. Rerolling should return, it was healthy and caused everyone to get a chance at the best weapon. If theres an overpowered weapon roll possible, isnt better to identify the problem and fix it, instead of having a few blessed by rng have it.  Just think what if we all didn't get that conspiracy theory-d with rangefinder and a range perk. Imagine a game where the opponent has that gun blessed by rng and you don't. The advantage is real, and the way rng works it can literally be months to get that gun. It just adds things to the game that are statistically impossible to in any feasible amount of time. I want some degree of confidence of what I want being attainable. I am 100% for the rerolls to come back. If that is simply not an option, drop rates need to be tripled. Make legendaries dismantle for only 1 legendary mark, but give us realistic chances at weapons. Right now, a properly rolled gun i want has near impossible chances. People rolled weapons hundreds of times, how long do you think it would take to get that??

3. If grinding for gear is the way you get us to play more, then maybe you should make the content more re playable, so i don't play purely for loot. IN HOW i played pvp constantly, not for loot but for fun. PVE, i would solo Crota, for fun, had everything for the most part, never got necro but who cares. I don't know the fix for this, but please open up the strike playlists, and the pvp playlists. I miss the old content, build up, don't Isolate. 

4. Getting level cap and allowing time to dick around in the game is when this sub is the best. It fills with silly and fun content people do. Videos of people doing challenge runs, cool stuff you didn't think possible. People have time to explore and push the game to its boundaries, and are not spending all their time trying to get finish whatever, and it fill the sub with exciting things people accomplish. 

5. INfusions just sucks. The reality is it now takes way more parts and materials to level up from the mutiple infusions over the life of the item. Bungie said, use what you want, infuse whatever. In reality I can't infuse whatever I want, cus im stuck with whatever drops at highest light, cus if I infuse I drop light. If i want to take a complete set of 280 light armor to max light, i about 5 sets of armor destroyed by infusion to do so, and don't even get started on how you need two sets of max light gear to drop, in order to get that set infused to max light. Talk about nonsense. 

I know I wandered off topic, but I had the most fun in this game playing the second half of HOW than the first half. Honing my skill swith my fav weapons is way more fun thatn spending 2 months grinding for that weapon. Literally months in, and I can't get an Imago loop, still no eyaluna drop, another that would be nice. Had one byronic hero drop with a bad roll. I can't get handcannons I want, its too much work. Too much grind, and I can't compare weapons and decide if I can't even get them. Armsday helps, but theres such a small loot pool. 

TL;DR. Bring back rerolling, the game is the most fun when I have stuff to use, not spending all my time at a massive odds deficit of getting what I want.

Prudence 2 from new monarchy, my fulcrum perfectly rolled how I liked it. Preadyths revenge, ( a little opish), Unending deluge, low grade humility.

When you look at rarity of guns, exotic seems to come to mind. Guardians chasing that gjallahorn that never came. But now it seems reversed. I can get exotics through purchases, random drops and by farming three of coins. I have just about every one now except red death. Dont have all the swords, and not the exotics that are non hunter. I was a xbox player who switched at HOW to PS4, didnt have red death during the base game. When an exotic drops, I have about a 1 in 6 chance of it being the right slot, then 1 in however many exotics their are chance of it being what I want. Plus xur sells them, pretty good odds. And perks are almost always the same, armor I can reroll for a small fee. 

Now when you think about it, say I want an Imago loop. I have to grind alot, drop rate is very low. On top of that it could have horrible perks. In fact not including the sights, just the ideal perk roll is 1 in 2860. Thats low. Think how many times you re-rolled your favorite gun in HOW, maybe a few hundred times in some cases. Without rerolling, the odds of getting the gun I want are astronomically low. In face, what most people will use are guns where the roll doesnt matter as much. (look pulses, get 1 stability buff and ur golden).

The counter argument is well, everyone had the best thing. It's what caused op shotgunning snipers and the like. Well actually thats what Bungie said and it isn't true. What caused op shotguns is that the roll existed at all. And we see that this is the case, bungie pulled shotpackage and final round. They saw that even without rerolling, the perks were too strong. Even without rerolling it had to go. Same goes with blast radius of shotguns. But we never identified that it was a problem!! because we all couldnt expose it. Before bungie was content with a minority having op weapons due to rng. 

Rerolling didn't break the game, the break was already there. Instead Bungie is removing a problem for them, not for us. If rerolling exists it allows us to exploit mechanics. We can expose the cracks in the game and they have to fix them. Now we can't do that unless we just get super lucky. Sucks for the guy who isn't. 

Theres a second issue with the everyone has the best argument. The problem is that there is a set best. There is no meaningful choices in perk selection. Shotguns will still all be dismantled if they don't have rangefinder. Most guns without stability perks. 
http://db.planetdestiny.com/items/view/3052681344 look at the imago loop and look at its first colums set. 4 out of the 13 are legitimate, with rangefinder just being the best period for pvp due to how aim assist range works. I mean I have never yet said I don't want this gun, it has rescue mag (chance to refill mag on use) instead partial refund( chance to return part of mag on assist) cus lets face it they are both garbage. In fact handcannons of this nature are in such dire straights due to the sheer number of just trash rolls.  

Rerolling was a fantastic addition because it meant I could play the way I wanted to. Im not stuck with third eye when I wanted hidden hand due to RNG not lining up the other perks. Rerolling lets us expose issues so fixes actually happen, otherwise a select few just have a serious advantage. Rerolling needs to return, it's not the issue, its the perk selection, and its Bungie's unwillingness to fix things regularly. 

The only exception is the gunsmith, but its time gated rerolling essentially, that takes up space in my inventory and is super limited in weapons. 

TL:DR - There is no problem with rerolling, currently good rolls are rarer than exotics. Rerolling was great because it exposed game issues, which are only a problem if bungie doesn't regularly fix them.

(in case anyones wondering, its a graphical error in the databases and on the weapon i believe too, nl shadow 701x is actually in the highest ROF class scout)

Edit: in case anyone's wondering TTK of mida class isnt what made it op its was its mobility. TTK is at .9 with 3 headshots and a body shot. .9 is slower than many TTK's right now.

Were coming up on the 2 month mark from the 2.0 major changes, and theres plenty of things identified as an issues, that I think most (of course not all) people can agree on. 

1. Handcannons. They are mostly bad. Range nerfs, I get it, but literally all the stats are poor on them these days. Bad reloads, bad stability, bad range, bad followup shots. 

2. Auto rifles - TTK is still not great. Couples with many still don't have the stability to perform. Sure zhalo is good at close ranges, Ive been melted plenty of time to know that. But outside the exotics, the class is suffering. 

3. Supers - Sunbreaker and Stormcaller are amazing right now. Sunbreaker, we know the issues. Most armor, longest duration, healing, can get tons of kills, aoe, tracking... ya. Stormcaller, great range, high mobility, blink. Just blows up your screen with lightning that chains about and turns corners, plus a good neutral game with grenades and that super long melee. Its doing so much better than self res warlocks right now.    

Plus looking perhaps at the old classes. Bladedancers are not doing great. Blink and arcbolt made the class, both got nerfed pretty hard. The super is prob the easiest to counter in the game, and the neutral game has been slashed. (side note, pve there literally no reason to ever run this class again lol) The rest seem good right now, none of them seem super underpowered or overpowered right now. In fact its nice to see the rise of more voidlocks, its a pretty solid counter to sunbreakers with the right helmet. 

** The most important thing of all**

Please please please please, do not go overboard with that nerf/ buff thing. I swear I cannot listen to this sub complain about sunbreakers being made useless for months. I don't play titans, I don't have one and I dislike using them, but do not ruin them. It seems to be the trend of game developers of just destroying things that were good. I played alot of LOL, and wholly shit did come characters get killed during the nerfbat times. I would 1000% rather have sunbreakers be nerfed too little and remain a little op than have them wrecked. Same with the buffs, suddenly having the only hunter class to be be bladedancers would kill me, I would rather stick to my Golden Gun. Can we just keep the nerfs and buffs realistic this time? Thanks. 

Edit: also occurred to me, can we just pull rangefinder too? It's just shotpackage again, minus about 1.5 feet. 

Edit 2: Fusion rifles/ sidearms. Are they bad? are they good? Personally I don't think fusions or sidearms are awful, but the rangefinder shotgun is still overpowered/ruining what the meta could be. Until rangefinder is pulled as well, I don't see there being place for anything else, even if it is buffed some.

Here's my thoughts I placed on another post.

break down of the weapons-

The Water star handcannon- low range, bad impact class that requires two headshots for a kills instead of one, and required giving up stability for range. bleh.

Doctrine of passing- auto rifle- really bad base stability, but has persistence braced frame and can get counter balance. But really auto are not competative for pvp. so bleh.

The inward lamp- scout rifle- shoots fast with full auto, unfortunately this archetype needs to have lots of stablity, something this weapon does not have, and this scouts TTK isnt great at .93, but thats only the ideal with a high stability roll. Bleh.

Reflection sum- pulse rifle- a nirwens mercy that gives up range for stability. Has army of one... theres much better pulse rolls out there. Bleh.

Glass promontory- sniper. Can't res snipe. but if your into fast snipers it is in the fastest rate of fire to body shot archetype. Has good perks. If your into it, sure.

Elevating vision- fusion rifle. super high impact, slow charge. Take it to pve. Pvp, bleh.

Binary dawn - shotgun - Highish base range? Yes, High impact yep, All impact range ballistics? YES, rangefinder? YES, HOT DAMN. Field scout? HOLY FUCKING BALLS OF FIRE YES! Do you wan this gun? YEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS for days.

The tamarind- rocket- has good impact and velocity and can get proximity detonation. Depending on number of rockets pulled with ammo boots and field scout, it could be the best impact velocity ammo ratio out there. needs testing, but il slap a yes on it.

The unseeing eye- mg- good ballistics, sees the return of fieldscout, has zen moment and can get persistence or spray and play. High impact type, looks like a solid choice.

Tl;DR, the primaries suck ass, the specials and heavies are great to better than average.

Edit2: I got excited over the shotgun.... :p, but remember theres no range boosting middle column perk. I personally love field scout for the bonus ammo, and if it performs well I will use it. Your conspiracy theory will kill at farther ranges. It's not the godliest of rolls, but it suits a slightly different playstyle, (never having to run out of ammo) and doubles as a great pve gun.

No super should wipe people at heavy, cross the map and kill people at the other heavy in one super, all while being an unkillable death machine. But whats the solution?

NERF IT TO OBLIVION!!!!!!

of course not. I dont even play titans bet lets face it ruining the class makes pvp uninteresting and titans will not have their pvp super. 

So what to do? Well there was a very interesting post about game design and motifs of classes. What fantasy does it fill? An easy example is the golden gun class, its a run and gun, throwing knife, jump around risky class with large payoffs. Bonuses are dmg and mobility, sacrifices any armor/survivability. 

Ok well what should sunbreakers be? The previous post mentioned siege engines. Unstopable foes that rain down fiery death on those in range. AOE blasts, zone control, you need to get far away or hes gonne wreck you. This I see as the TITAN, FIERY GOD OF DEATH. 

So things im ok with, highest armor in game. Good, fine titans are tanks. Aoe dmg, range, survivability? Yes im good with that. What I am not ok with? Mobility/ length of time. I wish the mobility was decreased.  Note !!!! only while in the super. I think its fine they can hold down any spot solo. If they are near, the heavy ammo is theirs. That capture point? Theirs. People hear the hammer and run! and yes that fine, getting out of range should be an option. 

Applicable nerfs i could see would be, 

1. titan supers drain faster depending on distance traveled. Makes a choice, 7 hammers here, or 4 hammers everywhere. 

2. Titans cannot jump in hammer of sol. Works well with sunspots your supposed to stand in them anyways, prevents really fast cross map travel. Upward mobility is a big hit here, so it might not be the best option. 

3. Standing in sunspots increase super duration. Makes it so staying in an area makes it more effective. Again 4 roaming hammers, 7 if you hang around your sunspots. 


Theres options without destroying the class, if they want to be an unstoppable sieging tank, Im fine with that. They just shouldn't kill people on both sides of the map with it.

AND IM TALKING SPECIFICALLY PVP. 

Lets do a breakdown of all handcannon stats and look at whats important. 

impact/ rate of fire. handcannons primarily fall into 3 impact classes. 94/81/68. There are some new impact classes with Ttk, but the only interesting one for pvp is the 74 impact class. 
The best impact class is solidly in the 81 category. 

Reasons why, it takes one headshot and two body shots for a kill. Its rate of fire allows for a excellent sub .9sec TTk. Lower impact classes require more headshots, and under fire its often too hard to get. The higher impact class only requires two headshots for low armor opponents, but the TTk is simply too high if they happen to have a slightly higher armor rating. Something I feel we will see alot more with the armor boosts based on subclass now prevailent on armor. (note: i do not have and cannot test, if the 74 impact can one headshot two body shot, it may be worth looking at, if anyone knows please comment)

Now that you have your 81 impact gun, lets look at remaining stats. Range, Stability, Reload. Range is a immensely important stat, with the range nerf its invaluable. And now the knowledge range increases aim assist, (https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3nu380/bungie_designer_jon_weisnewski_explains_accuracy/) its even more important than ever. 

Ok, now for the shocker to most people, stability is close to meaningless on handcannons. You may be like, no way can't be true. But its the case, its a pointless stat. Stability affects how fast you return to your target after a shot, because of the Rof of 81 impact cannons, you will return to aim in time with only about 20 stability. Any more and its a complete waste. I've done significant testing with the fulcrum and red hand with braced frame, whether max stability or base stability or red hand or lower with fulcrum, your bullet spread will not change. Same with ace of spades, reduce its stability, spead really doesnt change. 

Now for reload, I find it low on importance, most handcannons get about 9 shots, thats three kills with no misses. Almost never will you engage 4 tagets at once and have to reload quickly, 95% of the time either you won or lost the fight, if you won you have plenty of time to reload. 

Now for the other important stats, the hidden ones. Aim assist, equip speed, recoil direction, zoom. Lets get rid of the pointless ones, zoom and equip speed. High equip speed is nice, but will almost never save you. Zoom is 15 on all handcannons, maybe one exception but I can't remember. 

Now we all know aim assist is important, adds bullet magnetismishness. After using lots of guns, I would say its safe to have 70 or higher, with the truesight or sureshot giving any extra you need. 

Now ask yourself what does every good handcannon have in common? Its recoil direction. Fulcrum, red hand, Devil you know, Ace of spades, Fatebringer, all guns that have 80+ recoil direction. Its the single most important perk except for range. Its what will make you land shots. Its what closes you bullet spread together, its the most important thing. Whats a solid gun on paper but in reality was pretty mediocre due to its bad recoil direction? Jewel of Osiris. Most people didnt like the feel, it was meh, its because its recoil direction is at 60, pretty lame and you could feel it. I can't stress enough how good high recoil direction is. 

So now that we looked at the stats, we see recoil direction and range are the most important stats, with 70+ aim assist sitting in there nicely as important, but now quite as much. So what handcannon do I want? The best gun in the game is the fulcrum. I own it, counterbalance, rifled barrel, truesight is, and whatever else you want. It gets about 70 range, over 90 recoil direction and 80+ aim assist. Its high reload makes rifled barrel a low hit to its reload speed. But its a relic of the past, you need a new gun.

 SO whats out there? 1. Hunters, ace of spades with reinforced barrel is an amzing gun. I use it in pvp alot, i regularly get a high kd and outgun most things. Beautiful weapon. DO not use perfect balance its a complete waste. Its recoil direction at 95 is amazing, but its aim assist is a tad low at 60, the aim assist from truesight and its massive range seem to pick up the slack. 
I can't comment on the first curse, I have started the quest, but its a few arms days away from me. 
From the legendary selection there really is only a few guns. I do not own them because rng blah blah blah but based on stats heres going to be the best you can get for pvp. Two important changes to note, it seems handcannons can roll rangefinder again, but counterbalance has been pulled. 

1. Finnalas peril, the iron banner gun. It has a excellent recoil direction at 94, and good aim assist at 71. High range at 37. A perfect roll would be rangefinder, reinforced barrel/rifled barrel, then perk of choice, third eye, icarus, luck in the chamber. I havnt and cannot at this moment test rangefinder, but more range is fantastic on these guns. If its not great, I would heavily recommend rifled barrel (reload for range), and a reload perk like spray and play or outlaw.
If rerolls are allowed for iron banner only again, this is a must to get. 

2. Imago loop, Fatebringer 2.0.  Nearly identical stats as the finnalas perril slightly higher range at 40, slower reload, but its aim assist is low at 60. Hidden hand can fix this but might not be necessary like ace of spades doesnt need it due to the range boost, other than that, follow the above. 

3. Honorable mention, the water star. If its perks remain identical to the jewel, with its new perks which it says in the database, but really who knows till we see it. I can recommend with hammerforged, and rangefinder, If  and only if someone can prove rangefinders accuracy increase somehow ups the recoil control, without counterbalance, at 60 recoil direction it just doesnt cut it. 

4/5. Honorable mentions, not s tier but could be really good still, mostly subject to rangefinders effectiveness. Byronic hero and Gaheris-D. Both have good recoil direciton and aim assist, with byronic hero having an amazing 100 recoil direction.  Both can get rangefinder and with average range around 25 this may help alot, and both have decent stability which can be sacrificed for range in reinforced barrel. Could be solid picks, again rangefinders effectiveness needs to be tested. 

Hope this helps and clears up some stat misconceptions!
TL;DR, range aim assist and recoil direction matter, for legendary handcannons, get imago loop or finnalas perril and boost the range up. 

Edit: I can't spell when I type.

Edit 2: any guardiant out there with rangefinder on a handcannon, any testing on its effects or apparent boost to range is appreciated, if you have any info please post below.

Now that rerolling is gone I was hoping the drop rate would increase but now it seems total garbage. In addition the end game xp boost was removed, another huge blow.

This is a huge step back from when bungie added crucible only legendaries with a decent drop rate. The intention was to have pvp be on par with running strikes if your not much of a pve person. There was supposed to be good rewards for crucible but now it been nerfed back to complete garbage again. Doesnt come close to comparing to strike rewards.

In case you dont know how the trials bubble train works, is you set up 3 defender titans. As soon as the first bubble is available, you just drop it on the capture point. Then all three stand in the capture point, just taking turns bubbling. They just wait out the time till they win every round. 

The problem in trials is that if you dont know its coming, if they all switch to defender just before, there is no way to prepare the proper supers. Especially because switching supers, deletes all the energy. For example, sunsinger can't do anything at all to a titan bubble. Forcing you to switch to voidwalker, lose your energy, then still if you nova bomb it, the other one just has a super waiting. ON top of it, they all run suppression grenades, super and they can still stop you if theyre fast. It at most can give you a win one round, and if you win, they still have a bubble for next round. It just becomes a race of, who can get to the capture point fastest. 

Unfortunately on maps like today, one side a has a major advantage in terms of distance to the center, outside capture point. 
Frankly weve all seen the vids, its a total nightmare and incredibly hard to stop, especially when you realize too late.

What i hope is that you take the year one exotics, do a quest, learn some history and lore, and then it creates a new, different but still strong year two version of the gun. 

Example: icebreaker, go through quest, get a version with a bigger mag/ but slower regen time. Maybe switches elemental type. 
Thorn could become the rose version. Plus all the great background history is revealed in the quest. 

Thunderlord would lose its stupid sometimes electricity explosion for a cool chained lightning effect, get a good mag size and remove field scout, so your not pidgeonholed into that perk. 

The idea is the old exotics you acquired you get to keep forever, but they change along with you. It also allows for continual balance to be made to them, without straight nerfs/buffs.

Wait for inferno playlist. I unfortunately dont have a void primary so it was all shotgun for me. Heres the tips.


1. Don't play the objective. 
Ya i know its poor game strategy but its what you need to do and its only for a few games. I went about 31-33 kills and 5 deaths, and we lost. But thats about 150 points of the bounty. 

2. Patience!!! If you see someone run by, look the way they came from then follow. I dont know how many times i waited for 2-3 enemies to pass on the way to an infernal control camp point, to just kill them, last one in line, then the next, then the next, following straight up to the person at the front of the line. 

3. Avoid their best player! That guy with thorn wrecking your team around point B all the time? Just don't go to B. Clean up all the average players running about the sides. 

4. Camp the special ammo. A shotguns greatest enemy at close range is a shotgun. Unless you camp the special spawns. grab the special at first spawn, and run ur ass to the other closest one and take it too. Monopolizing special starves the other teams ability to counter your shotgun. 

5. Run like a bitch if your hit by thorn/ anything at range.
Cant stress this enough, its inferno, no radar. If you get hit, run. Hide, its often very hard for them to find you.  Then come back around to shoot that guy in the back. 

Follow these tips plus common sense you can finish it fast. It took me less than 10 matches, prob around 7 to go from 50 points to maxing it out in one night. Good luck Guardians!!
