People feel like the establishment forgot about them and just don't care, and when you look at where all the money goes it's hard to tell them they're wrong.

Then a guy comes along and says he recognizes that these people have been left out in the cold, and that he's going to make everything okay. He provides no plan or information about how he's going to do it but at least THIS guy recognized that they were struggling, something no one in the establishment appeared to care about.

22,"You mentioned you are having trouble against ""Gang fighters"" and I'm going to assume you're referring to swarms of 6-8 low point ships. There is a decent post on tactics for this over here: https://www.reddit.com/r/XWingTMG/comments/3u29rx/help_me_beat_6_ties_with_crack_shot_came_close_1/ 

Literally the worst thing you can do against swarms is attack them head on. As a TIE swarmer, whenever someone comes directly at me I smile and thank the force. You can make good use of X-Wing Pilots like Wedge with BB8 + Push The Limit to outmaneuver TIE Fighters and shoot them from their blind spots.

IMO the keys to beating swarms (and I've lost more than a couple times) are two fold.

1. Shattering their formation, so you're never on the business end of all guns at the same time.
2. Doing everything you can to stay out of arc. Higher point and higher firepower ships do better the longer they're on the field. Eventually even the best defense dice come up blank. Any turn where you would have to make a decision to get a shot and be shot, or have no attacks take place at all, the latter are a small win for you.

Focus on picking them apart when they're out of position. It isn't going to be easy by any means, one of the reasons swarms are so effective is because they push the boundaries of the games mechanics. The game is designed to be small squad fights, but when you're running 8 ships the mechanics start to crack a little bit. 2 dice 8 times at 50% hit per die vs 2 defence dice 8 times at 37.5% evade per die means unless you can control the movement phase and stay out of arc... well I don't want to be the Golden Droid who tells you the odds so I'll just leave it there.

Also: This guy's youtube channel really helped me understand the movement phase a lot better: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3OjjNUu1hA ",2016-10-19 16:00:41+00:00,d8yvhrr,1.0,t3_589tx0,15253.0,XWingTMG

27,"I grabbed an addon that shows my current mana %. When Evocation is off CD I pop Arcane Power, throw down a rune, and spam AB at 4 stacks (also cast AM when procs) until oom.

Then use Evocation, then do a build/dump rotation trying to stay around ~70% mana (save AM for when you're at 4 arcane power).

Once Evocation is ~15-20 seconds from CD you can start burning again.

Biggest tip I have, that I see arcane mages forget, is always use Aluneth ability on CD with 4 stacks and a rune of power (if that's your spec). Aluneth ability actually does a ton of damage.

Blood Elves are wise to remember that their Racial will give them 3% of their mana back, which can help you recover from mistakes during your conserve phase. Arcane requires a lot more discipline in my opinion, it's very rewarding when you hit your stride correctly, but very punishing when you F*** up.",2016-10-14 13:02:05+00:00,d8ro2gh,3.0,t1_d8rn6y2,1650.0,wow

Hanging out on an icy planet when a storm blows in so I dip into a cave. While in the cave I'm walking around scanning every plant, bug, rock, everything. Everything, that is, until I stumble upon this little pod that doesn't want to be scanned so I go check it out.

Square to open... ookay sure.
Some crazy glowy orb? Looks cool, don't mind if I do! So I scoop it up. Well apparently that was the Sentinels favourite orb ever because I'm instantly level 3 wanted and I've got 2 drones and a crazy laser cat chasing me through the caves now. I'm running for my life, periodically turning around to fire at my oppressors while fleeing further into the catacombs. Eventually I manage to evade/kill the sentinels and as I stand over the wreckage of the laser cat thing proud of my accomplishment I look around and a wave of dread washes over me.

I'm completely lost.

I try to retrace my steps to no avail and have no grenade mod on my multitool with which to blast a tunnel out of here, I decide to pick a direction and just-keep-going.

As I'm exploring these catacombs I stupidly got trapped in, I stop to pick up every glowy orb I see and butcher every sentinel who shows up to try to reclaim it. After ~3 hours I finally see a crack of daylight and jetpack out of the pit!

This reward comes with risks: more powerful enemies, contaminated areas which you may not have access to, and most of all other players who know you have loot.

Did you just open a DZ chest in front of 3 neutral agents? You'd better make sure no one is tailing you to the extraction, or you risk losing your reward. 

Massive did a good job balancing the risk and reward of rogue status and DZ loot. Does it suck that the dude behind the box rekt you as you were extracting? Sure. However it was your decision to trust him, you could've just as easily walked away from the extraction and tried at another location solo.

Finally I agree OP, Rogues need to measure potential gain/loss before turning rogue.

1. Running is how you die. If you're in a new area take your time and walk around, this will lower your enemy detection radius by sound and has saved my bacon a number of times from baddies that would have otherwise been fang-deep in my liver while I'm curled up on the couch visualizing my ""safe place"".

2. Charge attacks are more tasty than Reese's peanut butter cups. Basically I spent the first week of the game walking around poking everything with R1 because I figured that I didn't have time to charge up an attack.

&amp;nbsp;

Still picturing the end result in my mind’s eye visualizing how each individual part fit together I deconstructed the blade in my mind piece by piece and put it back together in reverse order over and over as I had practised for half a decade. Polished metal aligned with reinforced bolts, the pommel spun effortlessly against perfectly crafted threads and at the heart of the blade a sky blue gem whose power pulsed through the hilt.

&amp;nbsp;

I visualized how the parts all supported one another, how the weapon would react to the commands given by a true master, a reliable blade for a true hero. A hero who could challenge the greatest foe and…

No, must focus like my master instructed.

The weapon would be unique, it was my masterpiece. Off in the distance a faint hissing grows louder as if to rush me to completion. I begin to seal the blade and wrap the handle in a soft exquisite leather embroidered with the name of the craftsman, my name.

&amp;nbsp;

Footsteps. He’s come so soon. I’ve only just finished! I leap to my feet and snatch up the blade prepared to greet my visitor. His hissing heaving breaths precede him as he storms through the entryway clad head to toe in black armor, a great cloak over his shoulders. He eyes the weapon I’ve just finished constructing and with an emotionless voice he speaks from behind his mask,

265,"Wow this got out of hand :P

tl;dr - I think it would be cool to give us randomly spawning opportunities to collect special high tech loot, to build specialized ships for our personal fleet.

The easiest way to add satisfying content to this game is to add a loot mechanic to the game.

Give me a reason to raid strongholds, other than that the bulletin board asked me to. Give me a reason to take on a pirate Anaconda other than the eventually pointless bounty on it.

Specialized loot, I believe this is the key.

Set the scene: A rare NPC spawns somewhere, a smuggler who rips around in his incredibly fast Cobra Mk III, he's a tough one to catch and even harder to kill! You and your wing of 2 buddies finally corner him in an Alliance system and pull him out of warp but he boosts off and your wing gives chase, knowing it's only a matter of time before the authorities arrive! You take out his shields and disable his thrusters, he sits adrift.

Queue your wingmate who cracks open his hold with a hatchbreaker and out comes several tons of *expensive commodity which you can sell for lots of money* and military grade hardware. Not just ""Class 1 Grade F Gimballed pulse cannon"" but rare and exciting hardware. Prototype shield units, a cloaking device or experimental FSD that uses significantly less fuel per jump. Something that you can't just go grab from a station for ""n"" credits.

Then you kill him and unlock his sweet paint job for any Cobra you fly in the future.

And you can have legendary Pirates who drop specialized weapons, and repurposed ship designs (Viper with less fuel and internals but higher cargo capacity? Asp with less internals but bigger guns? A Cobra Mk III with a built-in charging ram which does massive damage to hull?)

Navy research facilities which you can raid to get specific faction weapons. A Navy particle cannon that fires faster and generates less heat? A Federal gunship that allows any weapon to behave as turreted without losing damage, but increases power usage and heat for you to highjack.

My point is that there is no challenging content right now aside from PvP. There is no benefit to doing anything difficult outside of the 100,000 credits you're going to make.

Convince people to get up to no good, give people a reason to turn over stones and blow things up. Make losing some things hurt! Make it hard to replace some things and give me an opportunity to be proud of something other than ""I flew really far and was the first to find a red dwarf no one has seen before"".

I want to lose, and I want it to FUCKING HURT when I lose.

I want to win, and I want to feel glorious in victory.

I want to find shiny things, and then I want to lose them in an epic battle so I have to go find some more loot.

350,"the 'stick' for a trader, so to speak, is that they need to generate capital to make margin profits. In a game where the ""market"" is local and no global there's no real financial risk once they've got the capital, at worst they can sell back at a very minor loss. The Carrot of course is the steady and reliable increase in wealth and the stick is the chance they get blasted out of the sky.

Piracy on the other hand is: Risk of getting blown out of the sky by players, other pirates and maniacs, a trader with friends, the police and if you manage to evade them all you STILL get the stick by a game enforced bounty and fine for being aggressive.

That's fine, risk is required otherwise it would be super boring, unfortunately the reward just doesn't balance out, stolen goods are sold at below market value, black markets are becoming few and far between because crime doesn't pay, piracy missions are frustratingly difficult compared to bounty hunting/mining/smuggling missions (I swear it's impossible to find a trader carrying fruits and vegetables...).

EvE online is growing at a drastic rate because of their marketing (see: This is EVE trailer), community content (see: Wingspan Delivery Services), and the gaming community at large professing interest in it (see: Fall of BoB, and the battle of B-R).

The fact is that a group of 5 scrubs who have been in for a month and focused on something specific can beat a group of 5 bitter vets who have 60m SP crusing around in battleships because win/loss in eve is calculated not by ""Did we pwn them all"" but by ""How much damage did we do?""

You can throw 5 stealth bombers at 5 battleships and if you're clever enough, wipe the field using surprise, range, and ewar. However even if you don't clear the field the odds are that when you exchange blows and take down 2 battleships, and maybe lose 1 or 2 of your bombers before retreating you've won the engagement by a score of &gt;600m to ~140m and that's with like 1-2 months skillpoints. If you went in against a carrier with a blackbird/falcon on deck? forget about it, you're risking like 500m against 2b, that's a good trade.
