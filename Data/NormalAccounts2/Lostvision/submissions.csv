I'm hoping someone can help me understand whether or not a specific configuration option can be implemented for ease-of-use for my office.

I was recently asked to have hanging up a call immediately return you to the main screen on the phone.

For example: You go into directory and search a name, dial the person and have a nice chat but when you hang up you're still in the directory. Now rather than having to hit Cancel&gt;Exit&gt;Back so you can call someone from speed dial (or whatever) just have the action of hanging up auto-return you to the main screen.

Is this kind of behaviour configurable?

I'm the newly branded administrator of our voip system and I have absolutely zero experience so please forgive me if I sound ridiculously underinformed, because the truth is I probably am...

My call manager + unity system directs all calls out a PRI with ~50 lines available for calls to and from external sources. We have no satellite offices coming over a WAN or anything exciting like that.

My CIO recently asked me if there is a way that I can monitor the number of lines currently in use on our PRI, just so we can be aware that we're running low and get another (you know, be proactive). I've found the RTMT but there seem to be at least a half dozen performance monitors in here that *could* be the data I'm looking for but who knows!?

Basically I guess I'm just hoping someone else who is more experienced with these tools can lead me in the right direction.

thanks!

tl;dr: can I monitor current PRI lines in use in my environment, and if so how?

I played as the glorious Duo, Syndrael and Avric, bound by honor to stop the evil sorceress Eliza Farrow from completing her dark blood magic ritual and end her rein of terror.

The adventure begins as our heroes make for the closest magic barrier protecting the sorceress, when a pair of hellhounds spring forth!

Our heroes pause for a moment, Syndrael slices through the smaller of the two-wolf pack like a hot knife through butter as Avric prepares to shatter the nearby rune.

Emboldened by their early victory, the two make short work of the remaining wolf, destroy the protective rune and sprint off down the hall towards the next objective.

*CRASH* Avric is sent flying as a giant club smashes between the heroes. A giant 2 headed troll emerges from the shadows. The duo look behind, and contemplate retreat, any ideas of that are dashed as they see a pair of undead staggering towards them reeking of death.

Syndrael goes low, slicing at the Ettin's legs. The monstrosity stumbles and falls onto its hands and knees and Avric delivers a blow to the back of the skull. The Ettin vanishes in a cloud of dust, vanquished, and the duo sprint away from the approaching minions towards the pulsing rune.

Meanwhile in her sanctuary Eliza weaves dark magicks, blood pours from her face and mouth, slowly collecting in the altar before her as sorcerers work tirelessly to keep her from dying. Her screams of pain grow louder and more shrill as the ritual continues.

Our heroes explore the darkest most filthy of all the corridors, moving towards a *click click click* sound in the distance, and away from the tortured screams behind them. At last they come to the room that must contain the final rune. When Avric opens the door, Syndrael shoves him to the side as an enormous eight legged beast buries its fangs into her wooden shield.

Syndrael tries to slice through but her blade found no flesh, Avric weaves healing magicks, and Syndrael's flesh knits back together as fast as it is cut apart by the monsters. One, Two, Three! The pair burst through the door in a frenzy, dropping two of the spiders at once! Syndrael dismantles an undead and races to crack the rune as she hears Avric cry out from behind her. She shatters the rune with the hilt of her blade and looked behind her to see Avric struggling with a rotted corpse, unable to free himself from its grasp as he desperately fights for his life.

Syndrael rushs to his side and as she separates the horrors head from its shoulders. Sparing a moment to rest, the pair drink and heal before pushing on. For the first time since entering this cursed place they heard, silence.

No snarling of beasts, no clicking of fangs, no dragging of limbs. The floor was littered with blood and corpses and then all at once... laughter.

The blood from the fallen began to gather into streams and etched dozens, hundreds, of glowing symbols into the floor and walls. The two made to sprint for the cursed chapel but found themselves frozen in place. Blood began to stream from their wounds and carved magic symbol in their own flesh.

Avric peered out through his helm and saw the undead piecing themselves back together. Two had already begun feasting on his partner and the largest of them began to make its way over to him. Terrified and unable to scream he closed his eyes, trying to find inner peace.

He found his new reality contained darkness...
Darkness, and laughter...

There were 3 of us so we split up to attempt to open all of the DZ and medium chests before everyone else who was at the pad.

The party leader was sprinting for a chest closely behind a neutral agent who just barely got to the chest ahead of him. He made the split second decision we've all had to make.

""F*** you, that's my loot!"" he says, emptying his AK-47 magazine into the agents spine, turning us all rogue!

It turns out, however, that we exited the subway in the wrong direction and ran right into 4 other agents who immediately began to rain hellfire down upon us. We escaped into an alley and holed up at the top of a ladder and here's where the fun began.

&amp;nbsp;

There was 1 entrance and 3 of us with ammo-refreshing health boxes, and range increasing pulses. every time someone tried to get up to attack us we ended the assault before it could begin.

It wasn't long before it became a manhunt. People constantly trying to climb up to assault us and getting cut down before they could mount an effective attack.

In the distance an eerie bell tolled menacingly and before long three other bells began to resonate with it. I could sense a change, I was not alone...

The Hunters descended upon me in an instant! The first one, brandishing a spear, lunged at me with ferocity while one of his allies peppered me with buckshot. Rolling to the side to avoid the attacks I began to sprint, my intention was to attempt to split the three of them up and I would stand a better chance 1v1.

After a skirmish which left us both fairly bloodied the spear wielding foe slipped into a pit of poison and aside from the screams that escaped the pit I can only guess what was awaiting him down there. The other two had followed me, drunk on blood and aching for battle the front man chambered a menacing attack with his axe!

Fearing for my life I dodged away between a stone wall and a gravestone, and he followed, snarling and baring his teeth.

Now safe from the shotgun wielding hunter I dodge back out of reach of the axe hunter, sprinting back in a moment later to sink my daggers into his flesh. I follow up with a flurry of quick slices and stabs, piercing his knees and elbows and dodge again narrowly avoiding a skull splitting swing. I'm back in, slicing at his arms and torso before finally landing an ending blow to his neck, the hunter falls and vanishes before my eyes, back to the dream with him.

The last of the trio attempts to box me in, the safe cove I found soon to be a prison if I let him succeed.

I sprint out right past him, whipping around and rolling to my right to avoid another blast from his blunderbuss.

This hunter swipes at me with a saw cleaver, predictably draining all of his energy in a misguided flurry of attacks which met only air. I begin to feed him the same meal I'd just given to his counterpart when he dodges backwards but I'll give him no time to prepare another assault. I charge after him and bleed him dry.

As he retreats back to the dream I realize there was a moment where this could have gone differently. When these intruders first saw me and gauged me, seeing my feather adorned cape and twin daggers. There was a chance for them, but they readily threw it away. Perhaps next time they dream they'll give thought, if they do they'll realize that I learned from the best.

(all below is speculation... obviously...)
After the death of Grand Moff Tarkin, Vader saw an opportunity to take full control of the Navy and eventually use it to support him in overthrowing the Emperor.


To assist with this he systematically executed people above Piett eventually promoting him to Admiral to ensure he had a competent and fully loyal commander of a large portion of his naval forces once he took over control of the Empire.

Perhaps he might have even promoted him to Grand Moff after securing the mantle of Emperor. Vader was probably hoping the Emperor would be able to succeed in turning Luke to the dark side, so he and Luke could team up and take out Palpatine, then he Vader, would take control of the empire and give his old role to Luke, his apprentice. Having Piett in control of the navy would ensure any rebellion or change of heart from Luke would be limited in scope.

Depending on where your skills are your ability to get money through different paths would determine what kind of ship you're able to fit for the final FFA at a pre-arranged location.

We order desktops from a manufacturer with Windows 7 installed. Now since it's 2015 and we're being all futuristic they have decided to just tattoo the activation in the BIOS. My concern is now that I don't have an activation key readily available to me in simple text format, I won't be able to activate any new devices I clone an image to.

&amp;nbsp;


In the good ol' days I would just change the activation key and enter the one on the sticker but these new fangled whatchamacallits have made it a bit trickier!

&amp;nbsp;

As of 13:34 a manhunt is in full effect in Providence region following a series of terrorist attacks in the region by GoonSwarm in coordination with the Imperium. 

&amp;nbsp;

The total tally of damages is not yet known. The nature of the manhunt appears to be a group of local alliances making a concerted effort to halt the Imperium onslaught in the region, one source was quoted as saying:

&amp;nbsp;

**“…these idiots don't even have Intelligence I trained when going to war in Providence.”**

&amp;nbsp;

While an effort is being made to stop these harassing incursions into Providence space, Imperium forces are undaunted following a recent announcement from Imperium command marking the beginning of a coordinated assault on Providence’s forces. Imperium leadership stated: 

&amp;nbsp;

**“… I don’t expect there to be much of a defense fleet [in Providence].”**

&amp;nbsp;

Even if a defense force is marshaled, the distribution and diversity of the Imperium fleets may pose a fair challenge when the sheer numbers of a full Imperium invasion is underway. The current time table for the engagement should have the campaign wrapped up by the end of 28/08/2015, depending on the defense forces that Providence leadership can marshal.

&amp;nbsp;

When questioned about long term occupation and staging plans the invading leadership responded:

&amp;nbsp;

**“… We are living in Providence, this is offensive occupation… kill everything, ruin the game-play for the people who are in Providence, reduce indexes, blow up their hubs, TCUs, shut down Station Services. Just burn it to the ####ing ground.”**

&amp;nbsp;


The commander then continued to encourage his navy's commitment to a shock and awe strategy stating:

&amp;nbsp;

**“When you are sitting there in your system, and you’ve hacked everything, you’ve burned everything, you’ve trolled in local as much as you can and there’s nothing to do there, you go NEXT DOOR, and you find something to burn.”**

&amp;nbsp;


What is still unknown is that with the bulk of their forces committed to a campaign in Providence, if Imperium will be able to mount an effective defence of their own territory should a rival navy move in to strike while their forces are out of position.

&amp;nbsp;

Further action on this campaign is expected to begin later today.

One group gets 39% of the votes and makes 100% of the choices for 100% of the country. Even if it ends up being a minority government we can just slide right on passed the elected bodies and use the senate, who no one even checked off on a ballot, to override the decisions of officials elected in a horribly inefficient FPTP electoral system that in no way represents the will of the people!

&amp;nbsp;

Every few years we get to elect the next temporary 'dictator' who can choose what (s)he wants to do with the country for a few years, usually with little to no real trouble from the opposition. As it stands regardless of what the voters want, the Conservative majority senate can just overturn all of the bills that go through the elected body anyways.

&amp;nbsp;

There are far too many tools at the disposal of the powerful minority to completely subvert the will of the majority of Canadians. Once 1/3+1 of Canucks decide on something your vote means nothing for half of a decade.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm fed up with this unrepresentative, unfair, and  phony excuse for a democracy whose silly construction is a relic of a bygone age where most Canadians were not educated enough to make informed decisions about our desired direction for our country.

&amp;nbsp;

The world is changing at an impressive rate and we're still stuck in 1867 when we were a few scattered farming communities and 1 or 2 big cities. Is there any wonder why the younger generations feel that their votes are worthless? They aren't far from the truth.

&amp;nbsp;

It's time to move this country forward, with better structures to chose our leaders, make votes truly count with a Single Transferable Vote, and if we must keep the senate then we ensure that they too represent the will of the people and make it an elected body while limiting their power to influence policy.

&amp;nbsp;

I've had enough of it, but maybe I'm alone. If I am just scroll on by and ignore me, but if not... if you think we can do better then SAY SOMETHING! Tell your representatives! Tell them that to get your vote they have to prove they care about DEMOCRACY! That you don't want to be ruled by the minority of Canadians any longer! Tell them. (#myvoicematters)

I hollered so loud my wife looked at me as if I had finally lost my mind and I finally felt like I had achieved the holy grail of Destiny, because I had. Shortly after that Mr. Xur sold me an Ice Breaker for the low low price of: all of my strange coins.

However, from that point it meant that I was one of the ""Gjallarhorn guys"".

No more MIDA Multitools or Hard Lights, I'd have to save my exotic slot for the Gjallarhorn. I can't be sword bearer because they need me to use Gjallarhorn. Better to let someone else use the relic. No more Hawkmoon or Bad Juju. I asked around if there was a way that I could use something other than G-horn and still be the most optimized hunter I could be and no one had any Super Good Advice for me.

So I'm actually looking forward to the few best exotics being brought in line with the others, so I can give my Montecarlo and The Last Word an honest shot, but I also can't help feel like they aren't just nerfing my weapons, but nerfing me as well. Over time I've become one of the reliable heavy hitters, one of the wolf pack shooting, ice breaking, super powered pigeon holed guardians people have been able to rely on.

It feels like Bungie has unlocked my cage, and now I'm afraid to leave my home.

--------------------------------------------------------- 

Earth UTC 02:32 - Met a contact in LTT 7488, member of some resistance faction pushing back against the Empire. He wanted my help smuggling out a handful of slaves before the Guard showed up, had a contact a few stars over willing to help relocate these souls.

I'm no freedom fighter but if the money's right I'll carry just about anything, just about anywhere, regardless of who's in my way.

Undocking with cargo is always more fun than the other direction, blasting through the security on the outside of the airlock faster than a bat out of hell and running the engines hotter than a red giant. Every ship in 100km runs a scan on you but they've got no chance to chase you down and by time they can yaw around and burn after you the FSD has already got you two systems over, and so it was for us today, me and my cargo are en route to the destination system.

Earth UTC 03:12 - A detour to keep outside of civilization left us a little low on fuel. Scooping hydrogen from a star while running with no shields is always a little nerve wracking but we made it through, albeit with a slightly cooked port thruster.

Now we sit, my cargo and I, 10,000m from the airlock slowly drifting to match the rotation of the station waiting for my heat sig to cool down. 

Docking is, as it should be, the exact opposite of undocking. Where Undocking is a full throttle, high adrenaline filled version of flashing your arse at the law, docking is much more subtle. Cooling your signature down to below freezing, powering off every LED and slowly drifting as silent as a ghost.

The rest is all up to the pilot.

Thrusters online and a seven second burn puts us at 160m/s. All thrusters offline and we're sent drifting towards the dock.

7000m - Enable sensors and comms array just long enough to get docking clearance from the station computer, cleared for landing at bay 14.

6000m - Close thermal vents to hide any residual signature, and slowly melting my electronics in the process.

2000m - Watch as a Security Force Eagle comes so close to us that I could read his insignia on the hull, and pray to any of the ancient gods who might be listening that he doesn't see the light from my HUD.

500m - Thrusters online and sensor controls enabled, a few last second adjustments to correct my vector and I'm right on course with the airlock, I punch the throttle and blast through the last few meters while scraping the paint on the topside of my hull on the way through thanks to my damaged attitude thruster.

I align myself with bay 14 and prep landing gear while venting heat from my ship into the atmosphere around me, a safe and secure landing.

Unloading cargo is always more sketchy than bringing it on-board, no one knows who they can trust, whether or not it's a sting, and if I'm going to get paid in credits, or bullet wounds. We negotiate the price around a little and I decide to cut my contact a deal after one of his boys offers to fix the thruster I melted a couple of jumps back. 

Before I leave they offer me a new job, it seems there's more people that need freeing in LTT 7488, but they don't want to run and hide like the lot I brought here. They want to stand and fight back, and I'm to bring the arsenal.",EliteDangerous,"Smuggling Tales: Slaves, Guns and Drugs",http://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/3ddwxn/smuggling_tales_slaves_guns_and_drugs/

The only feasible interaction between players was predator and prey. I understand PP tried to get people involved in factions to make you kind of work together for the greater good of your faction but wings still feel clunky and clans/guilds are nonexistent.

Worse yet I don't even know what you'd do together if you COULD fleet up with 16 other pilots and storm around the galaxy since there aren't really any big goals to work towards other than the next big ship, or part/mod. It's not like by working together we can raise enough credits to run the %item name% market or blockade the %star name% system.

Lack of kill-mail means it's fun to shoot pilots but really you have little knowledge of how much impact you had on the player.

Basically this game feels like it was intended to be a single player game and that the online universe was just tacked on to make it modern and maybe this is the case.
