14,"I've been following this conspiracy theory from the start. For a while in the wikileaks emails there was a bunch of talk about Pizza, dominos, hotdogs, cheese, hankerchief's that are ""pizza related"".

No body knew what the fuck any of this was about till someone put together this is code for human trafficking. Suddenly the emails began making sense, espacially since the nominclature used is Identical to that already used in deep web pedo forums.

Before saying it is absolutely bonkers to think the government would have anything to do with pedophilia I would suggest learning about the following before digging down this rabbit hole

* Conspiracy of silence - An english documentary about an american pedo ring that was pulled off the air last minute and ordered for all copies to be destroyed that was leaked on the internet 10 years later https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY-F5JoHoho
* The finders cult - an incident in virginia where abused children and massive amounts of child porn were found by local police, then FBI &amp; CIA stepped in and took over the case. No charges filed, children released back to their abusers

Now why do people think this is code for child abuse? This video explain it well. Again there is no DEFINATIVE PROOF, just lots of coincidences that make no sense any other way. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9itWsqzFMVo

There was also a ""pizza"" related site found in the wikileaks emails that linked to an open dirrectory with files that were WAAAAAAYYYY larger than they should be, and has been confirmed to be using stenography that no one has been able to crack. (Many do not want to crack because they suspect it is a CP payload, however other things have been cracked on it)

* https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5b17hj/testing_the_pizza_pages_wtf_have_i_found/ original discussion.

Then there is the emails where podesta is having hottub parties with 6,9 and 11 year olds for ""entertainment"". Again, may be nothing, but sure as fuck is fishy. 

Finally the deepest part of the rabbit hole. The Podesta brothers match the description of the kidnappers of Madiline Mccann and have been see multiple times with a young girl who looks like age accelerated drawings of madaline mccann look like https://imgur.com/a/rjzt7#frGYRMK

Hillary has alligned herself with a religion that makes her the enemy of over 70% of the country. Hillaries values are litterally against the very moral fiber of what most people have been taught their whole lives to fight against. (To some people, her winning is a sign of the anti-christ).

But not illegal. I guess what blows my mind is all her other actions fall against most peoples religious beliefs too, yet were not an issue before. In my eyes breaking the law AND shitting on morality is worse than just shitting on morality.

20,"Before you guys jump down a rabbit hole accusing this of being a cover for CP, I have a more logical explaination on why this may be the case.

California is trying to pass some insane laws on porn where all porn made in California. It's the Condom law, however the way the law would be implimented would force serious OSHA liability on the producer. Sounds fine and dandy, except in the modern era of internet commerce most of the stars are also the producer and opens them up to ridiculous high insurance premiums, fines and costs all overseen by a single self apointed moral arbitor.

This position would only be able to be changed by a the US HOUSE, not even the california gov could overturn or block this position. 

I recomend listening to the Brandi Love episode of porn director podcast for more info on the subject. But given pay to play system and California being a blue state, it seems more likely the porn industry is using a shell company to lobby indirectly than secret CP shell laundering.

There was a post on the 8chan group where someone threatened to dox all of maddoxes friends and said that even if Dick called it off it wouldn't stop. 

It then ""doxed"" maddox's gf. I say ""dox"" in parenthasis because all it did was link to all her social media and work emails. no phone numbers, no addresses. 

within a few hours, it was deleted off of the same 8chan board with the rape list. Then shortly after screen shots of maddox disavowing his book and saying to his friends do not accept friends you don't know, dick is sending people after me came out.

The only way that 8chan post could of been deleted off of the board is by hotwheels himself (who refuses to delete shit like that) or the creator of the board.

Good Humor podcasts:

* Distorted View (only for those with strong stomachs). One of the oldest podcasts around for over 10 years, all things sick, fucked up and weird in porn/news/youtards. Beware, there is kinda a gross out factor here. Highly recomended, frequently updated. This is tied for my #1 spot, and will have you laughing hysterically and 

* The Last Podcast on the left. 3 comedians cover morbid topics. Cults, murderers, disasters, all joked about. Like a tamer version of distorted view. As informative as it is funny, the guys seriously do their research.

* Drunken Peasants - Excellent podcast, but best viewed on youtube and 2 1/2 hours long each. Excellent show but there is a lot of LONG continuity gags and youtard beef, great podcast though and Ben adds a alot to the show so it's just not the amazing athiest talking shit for an 2 hours.

* Classic loveline with Adam and Dr drew. Yes, they got the lost archive episodes and are re releasing them, alot of them are lost episodes too. 

* Rucka Late Night Power hour. Not for everyone. Rucka Rucka Ali is known for his racist/sexist parody song humor, and his call in show was quite funny if you like that kinda humor from a white guy pretending he's black who hates weird al. Limited run, but thats okay

* The Meto-cast. If you are familair with the well known (or rather unknown) internet troll Jim for sparking off GamerGate then leaving because it became too autistic for his taste, he came back 6 months later and got back too shit talking and trolling. The Metocast (name came after doing a few of his news stream commentaries) covered politics and was some high quality stuff. His commentaries on the raw footage of Black Lives Matter, Shitting on jeb bush, the San bernadino shootings, Baltimore in flames, and all things news/culture/politics related. Unfortuately Jim deletes his shit all the time so you have to rely on archive channels for much of the content

I see an option two... She's gonna turn on them all. What does the gaming insider scene have to offer her anymore? They can't hire her. The indie darlings have been bleeding the excess money they'd normally had have before they were exposed so I'm not sure if they can afford to give her a hush money job to keep her silent (especially after 3 big names dropped over $30,000 each to keep Anitas new project from failing).

Not even a patreon where they all chip in to pay her to shut the fuck up would work because given her line of work it can be argued that she is laundering illegal money for prostitution. 

Everyone of her ""friends"" are in a position where they cannot give her money because they may be under a prostitution investigation if they do... They can't even give her under the table hush money because they have to account for income for rent and such.

With ZQ, there was never a direct exchange of money for sex. The quid pro quo was always in tangible making it legal and able to be disputed. With ZQ, it was unethical, but very much just more a weird cultish power collusion. If you ever hang around BDSM communities, its not uncommon they all fuck each other, have tons of drama and help each other out. ZQ and all implicated are only of guilty of being nepotist unprofessional cliquey cunts...

5. Wait a minute, why is the price of muh info I'm selling of my retard users going down?

It's too big to fail. This can't go down and be worth less guys.... r-r-r-ight?
6. Oh shit, it just might not be too big to fail and since Google and FB are already eating over 90% of the pie when it comes to the money I want to make and there are too many people fist fighting for that extra 10%. being #3 or #4 just might not be good enough.... fuck.

Silicon valley takes the money they get from the acquisition then dumps in into non taxible charities that don't pay for anything.

When it comes to the internal audit of something like a groupon it is easy to stare at it from the distance we are at and see what is happening, but when you consider that IP law does make it real and they did balance it out, it checks out. At that point it's a disconnect between who is reviewing the financials and who is negotiation the deal, which you are right is on the VC. 

In that respect lets point to something like the housing collapse, it should of been clear that if you took all the homes of the people you tricked with the teaser rates you would have too many homes on the market keep having the steady rise that was forecasted to never go down. But no one was taking supply and demand into account. No one gave a shit. 

With tech, you are seeing low overhead costs (because you only have a few hundred employees serving millions, and the cost of servers and bandwidth) and potential to make cash plus massive assets in IP and marketing reach. Looks good right? 

Then you look at how they are counting/valuing users. How they are valuing IP. How so many shitty startups are all flooding the market at once. How many of them are not innovating a service but rather offering a different UI for the same things. How there is an assumption that online ad dollars are limitless and plentiful and all valued equally or with minor variation. Then the assumption there will be growth in gov spending to get data with a premium on persons of interest.

177,"So your whole argument for why I am wrong is the semantics of my analogy? Did the phrasing of ""bubble"" trigger your balloon oriented pronouns? /s

Luddite is a pretty extreme phrase and shows you didn't read or comprehend the argument I put forth. If I was arguing that tech was going away, why did I say Google and facebook were the huge winners in this because they found the right strategy and will be fine? 

Also great indepth anaylsis of ""People throw money at the wall to see what will stick all the time.  Eventually they realize they can't invest it blindly..."" clearly any knowledge I had or any points I have brought up about grey areas in accounting when it comes to valuing a web sites assets or service is moot with this argument. I mean how can I compete with people throw 'money around at shit and make it rain'. It's not like they ever look at the financials when investing, no clearly this is a case of sad saps buying blue chip stocks hoping on serious bank. Clearly, I am the fool here. 

Attention on a platform = value POTENTIAL. However if the potential is not realized, the bandwidth of the service is just a massive expense. More users = mo' money to spend serving them. 

The people who will get hardest hit is anyone looking for capital that is not facebook or google. Who will invest in a start up after MULTIPLE companies have been doing the shit groupon has. It's been over a decade, why is the revenue so small, but the value in assets for these companies high? How many online advertising dollars do you think are out there in the market? What do you think ROI is on spending money to advertise to someone online as someone selling a product? How much do you think the NSA is shelling out for meta data? How much are marketers paying to do the same? 

The current model of sites making money is flawed and relies heavily on fooling VC into thinking they're worth more than they are and with the right expense cutting it'll be a profit making machine.

178,"Because the rules for online assets are not clearly defined when it comes to how its claimed. 

With GAAP what you are talking about is something similar to a head hunting agency claiming the new employees job ENTIRE earnings as their earning. In the case of Groupon, even though in reality they only make a percentage, they ""own"" the entire coupon (according to them). There for when it is used 100% of their product was acquired, then they lump the expense in a general nonbroken down expense format. I know what you are thinking ""HOW THE FUCK IS THAT NOT FRAUD?""

Because the laws have not caught up to ecommerce and they can use IP as a legal justification. The way they are reporting it is that coupon pitch and service is 100% theirs, and what they pay the company is just an expense that they can lump somewhere. After all, those ads are SO FUNNY XD! How is that coupon NOT 100% THEIRS? /s

Thus revenue LOOKS more than it is. Back to the head hunting example, it'd be like claiming the entire wage of the employee you got a job for as your revenue, but the % of the part you don't skim off the top as some expense somewhere as a lump sum. To a VC they would look at that and say ""Well this is an easy problem to fix, we just need to cut costs and the revenue stream will make us profitable and with your current rate of growth, there is no way we won't be rolling in dough.""

Except even after firing the dead weight, you start to notice an relationship with certain revenue and cost... and by that point you already signed the check for the privilige of firing the staff.

182,"The tech bubble is imploding. This is multi-prong (not just the piss poor social justice crap, but it's a part of it). I have a business admin degree so let me break down some of it:

1. The Social Justice bait on TOS has a negative growth effect. Growth is a businesses bread and butter. You have no growth, you gain no people. 

2. Bandwidth costs money and the monitzation strategy has been sketchy at best. (keep this in mind as well, web owners are SELLING a LIABILTY to investors/advertisers as an ASSET. If this were an accounting class, how would you mark the bandwidth of users on a ledgar?)

3. cooking the books: Here is the story you are not seeing, there are no accounting rules for how to label assets when it comes to the web, let alone if there is any depreciation value, what is a liability, asset, etc. What you are seein (like in the case of groupon) is start-ups acquire low-mid teir wall street workers (anyone top teir either works for the bigdogs at google and facebook, or wants no part) and cook the books in ways like over valuing their accounts, creating fake accounts to inflate users (see reddit), or double claiming assets. Groupon natoriously double calimed its assets to defraud investors, except its not considered defrauding because there are not rules that are well defined for internet monitazation. 

4. When pitching to investors they are relying on NSA NDAs to cover parts of their budget they don't want to disclose or inflate how much money they are recieving. They basicly say to investors, give us more money because the NSA is giving us a undisclosed cash cow for user data, and they will give us more if you help us grow because reasons.

5. The current monitization strat is a house of cards. Data broking will either get sophisticated enough to where different users have value based on spending or the amount of info they share online, or be taken down by privacy law the people are clammoring for. In other words, the data of suzzy mcSMASHthePatriarchy is worth less because she shares he info publicly every 5 seconds and it doesn't change often or reveil anything new, and unless her spending habbits are through the roof, why waste emarketing money buying xer info trying to sell her anything?

6. It's winner take all. Google will stick around because they are their own marketing company, thus are paid dirrectly for advertising and do a good job advertising. Facebook is #2 in the game and they get paid everytime gov or a private interest want to expand censorship or buy personal info, Facebook is also a good at capitol investing then turning those companies into a suction cup for facebook. They have such large market share they is no point going to a #3 or #4 to get what you need data or ad wise from someone getting a service from them.

I want to end on this note. If you think Walstreet is a problem, look at silicon valley. Say what you want about Walstreet being greedy, but they are at least RE INVESTING what they have, which grows the economy, builds buildings, makes goods, etc. What you are seeing silicon valley billionares do is take large sums of wealth, then stash it in large tax exempt ""non-profit"" ""education"" based ""charities"" that have almost no overhead. These charities are an issue for 2 reasons. #1, they are being used for the current social justice push you are seeing now. #2 they are hoarding large amounts of wealth, and they are not using it in anything else.

Downvote me to oblivion, but I think Jim was right in many respects. I don't think KIA is about ethics in videogames anymore.

221,"I've noticed a pattern, it starts with a close knit community. That community has their own injokes, culture ect. It becomes like a home. Then it grows. 

There is a problem after the growth. You start getting people who begin demanding things change for them, attention whores who try and be the center of attention 24/7, people who actively try and purge those who don't follow a group think, the original community slowly going away or even worse bitching about how much things suck rather than making good content. Then shitty sociopathic people who have no lives become mods to mod the growing community and powertrip to make up for the helplessness they feel in real life. 

Reddit was able to avoid death throws for so long because of subreddits. Subreddits meant you didn't get stuck running into the same douches all the time. Then Reddit figured since they avoided slowly dying like the websites of yore, they could do whatever they wanted. 

Reddit now goes against the very core values it used to stand for. The content is slowly becoming neutured to accomidate new users feelings/advertisers. They are a safe space, not a free speech zone. They tried making the changes drastically, and there was a revolt. Now they are no longer transparent and make changes hoping they don't get noticed kinda like how they are selling all our data to anyone who will buy it.

The worse part is they told you that they tried giving you free speech but you couldn't handle it, and so many of you were stupid enough to believe it because it was easier to buy the bullshit than go without your dank maymays.

Unlike last time when there was a revolt people can tell something is slowly changing and they can't put their finger on it but the fun is gone. You know whats changed since Pao was fired? NOTHING! Certain mods powergrab and have no consistancy in moderating because its not about the good of the comunity, it is about pushing out ideas you don't like.

Implying? He never IMPLIED any of what you suggested. He refered to it as an untapped market blindsided by a marketing strategy that was successful after the videogame crash. 

And jesus, the whole post is based on what some guy on tv implies? Have we seriously become such oversensitive pussies we now make up slights and make defenses based on opinion with no sources? You fucking kidding me? Shit no wonder Jim left GG.

262,"no skin off my back, do what you want. I'm just past the point of dancing for approval we'll never have or trying to convince fence sitters (there aren't any anymore. only those who care and chose their side and those who don't). 
As I said, I come here for the news which has branched to multiple different subjects. Unless something truly worth attention happens I'm past the activism phase. 
I don't speak for most of GG. I probably don't even speak for half. But honestly I don't care what we are labeled as anymore. The people who became the lynch pins of GG are pirahas in their own right (with or without us). GG is so over blown and ridiculous in media no one knows what to believe. I wouldn't say we won, I say we made a dent where no one was able to make a scratch before (damage at gawker). It's something, but I'm done crusading or winning hearts and minds. 

If someone slaps my girlfriends ass, I don't slit their throat and fuck the wound, I break their nose and make sure they get the message. 

GG turned out to unravel something bigger than I could of imagined. A pc push to make ""safe spaces"" perfect for governments wanting to shut up pesky julian assange types with rape charges, companies who want to advertise but don't want that chaotic element that comes with the internet, and whiny people who can finally feel important and have the power they never could get from hard work.

I'm sorry, but as of late NPR and PBS have been garbage and just as guilty of un fact check dribble. Don't worry, I brought examples:

* I heard this on my way to work. It was after finding out the san bernadino shooters were muslim, had contact with ISIS and planned in advance. So what does NPR report, that the [shooting may of been instigated by white supremacy gangs](http://www.npr.org/2015/12/04/458427047/police-still-searching-for-motive-in-san-bernardino-mass-shooting)... No way trying to build a narative there
* Then there was a recent garbage on planet money where they argued that DC is better than alternating current [by using the exact same arguments Edison used to fear monger people into choosing DC against Tesla's AC](http://www.npr.org/2015/12/02/458127706/planet-money-ad-versus-dc-power-grid)
* There was a piece today that was about how useful websites censoring and monitoring behavior can be used to make the internet a safe space and that tech companies need to step up and remove content, software, and speech that goes against their morals (I don't have the exact peice. I wanna say [it's this one](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/01/29/382435536/pro-isis-messages-create-dilemma-for-social-media-companies) but it only briefly touched on terrorists using messaging and it doesn't sound like the one I heard.
* Don't get me started on the Garbage web stuff PBS shits out as educational programming on gaming and such the use to [push hipster douche ideology](https://youtu.be/seq7EYDyIGE) I mean for fuck sake, for their gaming channel [the guy who hosts it who spews reject philisophical bullshit doesn't really care for videogames or play them regularly](https://youtu.be/ZJMvzLbazwU) 
* But lets not focus so much on the liberal adgenda stuff, lets remind ourselves when PBS tried to show the documentry [because they didn't wanna lose that delicious Koch bros funding] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Koch)

I'm not saying defund PBS or NPR, I listen to it and think it's a public good, when it's not pushing this shit or hiring a bunch of reject philosophers. I've only started seeing this NPR shit become almost buzzfeed levels of garbage since the San Bernadino Shooting. All PBS web content is terrible.

Oh no, I believe in standing for all speech even if it hurts peoples feeling and if somebody overly sensitive considers it hate speech. MY WHITE CHRISTIAN MAN GOD AND STARS AND BARS, I MUST BE A CARD CARRYING MEMBER OF THE KKK! /s

&gt;So let's run through your arguments real fast

may wanna take your sweet deluded furry time there, Some of like to actually think before we speak rather than regurgitate what tumblr ""educated"" us on. 

&gt;-Because some feminists get away with hate speech towards men, that makes hate speech ok.

Who said anything about okay? My argument isn't hate speech is right. It is Vile. Look at the WestBoro Baptist church, they are disgusting. However I would never impose on anyones right to speak their mind, no matter how hateful. I'd much rather know who the people I don't want to talk to are than have them conceal it. 

&gt;Shouting fire when there's a fire, so you do think that all muslims are just terrorists waiting to strike.

No, But american born and raised muslims are not repressentative of islamic nations as a whole, and when you look at the statistics you start having things that I believe you would refer to a ""problematic"" in your silly tumblr speak. The countries where it is intertwined with government because there is no seperation of church and state you have police who represent the church and are legally santioned to beat women. I mean women aren't allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia. Why is it you hate women so much? Why do you see it as okay for these countries to deny women education, the ability to drive, or any basic human rights? Just because someone CHOOSES (yes chooses, Islam is not a race they are a religion. Middle eastern is a race, ask the Lebonese who were murdered and became refugies because those pesky ""one or two bad apples"" started a civil war. Amazing how one or two bad sunni apples took over the whole country, and displaced 76,000 people. I'm not saying we need genocide. I'm not saying all anyone is anything, because I'm not a retard who assumes the moment you meet someone they adhere to a cartoonish stereotype. What I am saying is Islam has serious issues that have created oppressive and barbaric living in the middle east, but we can't because people like you refuse to have this discussion because people like you consider hate speech. Hate speech that if a lunitic reads and decides to go nuts and does something horrid, according to Ms. Lynch is now speech that she will prosecute (because after an ISIS terror attack, what we should really be concerned about is the feelings of terror cells /s). You refuse to address it and call anyone who wants to discuss why this is a problem a biggot. Man, I thought red pillers were misogynistic, but you take hating women to a whole new level. To defend countries that literally stone women to death, or to defend Saudi Arabia, a country where religious police will beat any woman who tries to drive her self to work. I mean damn dude, why do you hate women THAT much? 

&gt;You think that because some of Islam's beliefs are violent, their followers are violent. 

Oh, have you not been paying attention to the terrorist war that has been going on since 2001? Clearly America needs to stop being oppressive shit lords and realize all ISIS (or any of the other insane iron fist terror groups who act in the name of islam before ISIS ever existed) is trying to do is create a safe space.

&gt;Dude you're going to freak the fuck out when you find out the Bible also says you should murder homosexuals and women should be subservient and covered from head to toe (Peter, if you're wondering). 

Sounds like a pretty shitty book. I've read bits and pieces here and there but never got through the whole thing, I like my fiction ton be a lot more fast paced and better written. Man Imagine how crazy it would be if people who said what a crazy horrible shitty book it was were prosecuted for anti-christian speech, especially if some crazy spree shooter took their criticism (or even blatant hate speech) committed acts of violence because they are insane? That would be HORRIBLE. Good thing we have a separation of church and state (even if shitty horrible people try and work around that), don't we prosecute people who speak ill of christian for hate speech even if a lunitic uses those words for inspiration for violent acts. It's also a good thing our country prosecutes individuals who commit homophobic murders in the name of God instead of letting them have their own police force that can act as judge, jury and executioner.  Good thing we don't live in a world where people would try and prosecute speech that is critical of religion... oh wait...

&gt;Turns out that the overwhelming majority of people don't follow their religion strictly. There's over a billion muslims on earth. I think if they all actually did want to kill all non believers, we'd all be dead.

TIL 1 billion people somehow can overtake the other 6.125 billion on earth who don't fall into that 1 billion camp. You aren't very good at math. It's okay, maybe if you spent less time hating women and defending countries that allow for degrading horrible treatment of women in the name of islam, and more time studying math you would be better at it.

&gt;Pointing out the flaws in a religion is not the same as people saying ""We gotta get those fucking muslims out of our community by any means necessary before they kill us and rape our daughters, they're all terrorists and if we wait they will kill us in our sleep."" 

Huh, someone should tell Charlie Hebdo that. Last I recall they tried making valid tounge and cheek criticism and jokes and they got called biggots who were mocking a marginalized oppressed group of people. But again, we can't talk about how middle eastern countries where islam is not seperate from religion, that's hate speech and racist (even though muslim is not a race).

&gt;But then again I'm guessing you have 0 problem with Bill O'reilly saying that George Tiller ""Had to be stopped before he kills another infant"" repeatedly until someone listened and murder Tiller. That was just free speech, right?

Does it get tired building straw men? I'm waiting for you to tell me my white privilege is blinding me. I believe Bill O'Reilly had every right to say what he did, no matter how disgusting I find it. In the end the individual who commited the murder is the one who is responsible. I hold people accountable for their actions. Bill O'Reilly did not murder anybody or put a bounty to commit murder. Bill O'the-Clown was an asshole. If it wasn't Billo, it would of been someone else who convinced that insane murder to commit murder. Hell, look at Mark David Chapman. He blamed Catcher in the Rye. People who commit acts of violence aren't releaved of the responsibility of their wrongdoing because the ""the devil made the do it.""

&gt;And yes I will go masturbate to furry porn. I advise you try jacking off as well with all that deep seeded hatred you have in your heart. 

I'd much rather have sex with my girlfriend. I'd explain what that is like and what the inside of a vagina feels like, but given how much you hate women and love to defend people who brutally oppress women I have a small feeling you might not be interested. 

Explains why you feel a need to masturbate to anthropomorphic animals with so much deep seeded hatred in your heart. Now just out of curiosity, are you a pedophile? When browsing there is such a disproportionate amount of furry porn involving furries being cutesy babies. I mean it's creepy.

&gt;It might do you some good to relieve some tension you've got from thinking every muslim is your enemy.

TIL I said every muslim was my enemy. Man, we should contact Ms. Lynch to let her know what a horrible racist (even though islam is not a race) I am and put me in jail for thought crimes ASAP. Is reading not a strong suite of yours either?

352,"So what anti-muslim speech would be considered prosecutable? Shouting to kill all muslims? Isn't the SCUM manifesto litterally calling for the death of ALL men? Or maybe insulting the prophet mohamed and drawing pictures of him. After all that is considered an act of agression against islam. 

Oh, maybe shouting fire in the back of a crowded theater WHEN THERE IS A FUCKING FIRE, might not warrent the same response creating a false sense of urgency that causes harm. But let me guess, islam doesn't have a problem and they need to be coddled in a safe space no matter how much they abuse women, murder homosexuals, ect. In fact we better not address it at all, after all it could LEAD to a hate crime, and islam has a pretty low bar for what counts as anti-islam speech.

* SJWs are brave enough to speak the truth even when we get caught lying about facts and people are to scared to deal with uncomfortable topics like rape which we use as a trump card to silence dissent or discussion and make anyone who questions us pro rape, racism (fill in the ism)
* look how thinskinned all these staright white males (yes all straight white males, even the female and minority ones because race and gender are social constructs) are when ever we 'truth tell' by accusing them of being rapists who are racists. Lolololol u mad bro le trollface?

Therefore by even existing I am simultaneously the strongest and most oppressed.

Just because someone is out and just because don't mean they are anti-GG all of a sudden. Just means they are tired of talking about it, keeping up with it, writting emails, ect. 

But yeah, I don't blame him. The movement goes to cringeworthy places sometimes. I stopped talking about it on social media because it's pretty exausting to do so all the time and honestly... At times you guys get preachy, at times you guys are so desperate for a win or to not take something as a slight you'll do mental gymnastics, sometimes you guys are too tone-police moral fag, but most of all you guys do go overboard on the identity thing from time to time. 

Don't get me wrong, I still follow KIA news. I like GG as a watchdog. Some fun news still comes out now and again. Pretty much all GG means to me now is

1) you think games journalism is corrupt garbage
2) You think games awards show are rigged by douches helping their douche friends
3) You know that the media colluded to push a narative and is doing what ever it takes to not admit fault no matter how damning the evidence.
4) Zero tollerance for SJW culture

I'm not gonna tell you how to run your shit. After all I still come here and read stuff and anything I don't like I downvote (Much like many do to me when I shit on KIA on here). But I think Jim had a point, I think we get pretty circle jerky, and I think a lot of people here wear this as an identity and some people let this consume their life.

They will have to beg for whitelists. Patreon and websites like it will become the new norm for websites/writers ect. People will whitelist for non clickbait garbage. 

Right now you are seeing websites pandering to the lowest common denominator to get ads. It's why you see SJW pandering and Right wing retard pandering. These are people too dumb to know how to use this stuff, but they're learning. Once the gospel of adblock and Tracker blockers spread you'll see less pandering to these tards because they will be too stupid to whitelist. 

You'll see a bunch of websites that will fake not working because of tracker blockers and ad block, but rather than turning them off people will just go elsewhere. 

Expect to see a rise in sites like patreon. Then expect to see a crash when they don't get their legal shit together or end up funding CP rings and CP sharers and refusing to remove them despite being given evidence (See Sarah Butts). I do not feel sorry for any of them. Good riddence.

Yeah, right now since we're fleshing out gameplay the story would need to be fleshed out. The one thing about the story, is each playthrough would have different antagonists. So far the main ones I have thought up is a person using you as a Pon, A person doing it for the lulz,a misguided vigilante that thinks you're part of the problem and wants to make you suffer, parents of a victim. I want to have a minimum of at least 6 different types of antagonists that a player can get, all with different things that piss them off. While the gameplay would remain the same (solve puzzles, get clues, find out things that are shocking and uneasy, put together clues outside of the game to build a bigger picture) the levels where sent, the antagonists, and what the story is for why you are putting it together are revolving (much like the ohc game had revolving set peices). 

I wanna flesh out the story more with /u/white_noize once we find a programer. The plus side to this game is it doesn't have to be the prettiest so level design shouldn't be super taxing. White_Noize said they already has experience with texturing and has good ideas so far that i've really gelled with.

The main focus would be putting together clues of real life cases of abuse to solve puzzles the antagonist(s) are making you solve for whatever motive they have (depending on the antagonist). When people dig deeper and learn these are all real cases, the things alleged and Things like the Sad Satan clone are actually real it will leave them horrifed and uneasy. 

I agree though, rely too much on gore and it becomes a cheap 'scare'. Not even a scare so much as a gross out factor. I feel keeping with the same vein of the original game, but building on the previous two would be best. ",2015-08-10 16:53:11+00:00,cty45l8,2.0,t1_cty2rjw,2108.0,sadsatan
501,"I **love** the idea of the attacks via text. I'd go easy on the Gore after the initial first level on either mode. but if it was something that was random, like you never knew when it was comming or if something you did pissed off the person on the other end (Missing something you were supposed to get, missing a clue). I'm mixed on the idea of a sanity meter, it can be done correctly but what made Sad Satan so creepy was there was no fail state. You just kept going and kept being subjected to disturbing messages, and all you could do is minimize it. 

I would want to keep that same feeling of hopelessness, terror, and need to either see it through to the end or turn it off out of fear  because it was too much. My fear with a sanity meter or a health meter would it would tell the player how to feel, which would take them out of imertion. Where I do see it working though is as a gauge (and a wonky one that can be switched) of how the antagonist feels towards the protagonist and how it effects gameplay. 

I would absolutely want Sad Satan to fuck with the user like it does in Eternal Darkness. One thing I thought of is say we could get the game Green Lit I'd want the game to send them coupons/items in their inbox that send them messages like the notepad messages OHC received. I'd want it to screw with peoples head, especially when they learn that the clues are to real events. 

I'll shoot you an inbox message I really want to find a programer and get some of their input. 

The last touch of what I would want to do, is every play through I would want a couple different type of people to be the ones fucking with the protagonist. All with different motivations, all with different reasons and different responses. Each time you would uncover who it is. Some will be doing it for the lulz. Some will be using you as a pon. Some will be parents of victims who want you to connect dots. It keeps you on your toes and keep you coming back. 

I'd also want to alternate between when the main character is asleep plauged with nightmares, in sequences similar to what we know as Sad Satan. 

There are a few things I am unsure that we may have trouble with, one is some of the royalties. I'm sure Zeplin wouldn't allow for stair way to heaven to be released for such a game. Also I'm unsure of the legality of using real life cases. ",2015-08-10 03:07:55+00:00,ctxkkk2,4.0,t1_ctxfb2b,9465.0,sadsatan

504,"I do agree about the Gore to an extent. I feel the Gore of the clone should be left in because at the very least it gives people the experience of the ""clone"". Continuing down that road would be overkill, I'd rather focus on true cases. This is a game that was supposed to be over the top. Many of the people who would take on this game would do so because of the myth of the game. I would be okay. An option to turn off Gore (as well as other features) I feel would not take away from the game. 

**Binurial Beats:** I would not want it to be something that gets overused. I see exactly what you mean. I feel an option to take it off would again work. 

I do realize some elements world be too much, giving people options that are clear before begining the game would cater to many different people. An option to take off Flashing for light for epilepsy prone, a option to turn off binurial beats (or simple just play through speakers since it would not have the same effect as headphones), and no gore (although I feel playing a game about child abuse and not being able to handle gore is odd) is possible. The reason I'd want to leave in the gore is to simulate why the clone was the game people fear playing without the risk of CP or botnets. 

I'd love to workshop some ideas to bring this to life with you. If you like we can write back and forth, come up with an dead and your ability to texture would help a LOT! 

Sad Satan is a terrifying idea for a game. I feel it should exist. I'd want to make it a Adventure/Puzzle/ARG.",2015-08-09 22:57:09+00:00,ctxc9ba,2.0,t1_ctxbd1s,1683.0,sadsatan
505,"If you can find someone who knows how to program, I'd love to write it (story and script). There is alot that can be worked with given the lore. 

The clone version honestly I believe embodies what a game about child abuse form the dark web would be:  It's ugly, sickening, evil, illegal, sickening and terrifying exactly like the subject matter the game covers.

What impressed me is if you wear headphones, the soundtrack uses binureal beats that make the player neasus, so it makes you physically sick to play the clone (the part in the someordinarygamers play through he gets sick you can hear them). 

If someone can do some programming I would love to write (story and script) or help write a workable version of the game. I believe it should touch on the previous 2 versions as well. 

My pitch:Not do the same EXACT game as the 2 versions that exist, and to add some plot, maybe go meta.

I think an interesting starting point on a meta angle could be the clone, Include the 1st level that is from the clone, cut out the cp leave the gore. This is suppose to be an ugly game about an ugly subject that is supposed to rub you the wrong way and strike fear into you.  

I think it should also go full meta, I would make the clone version the catalyst to a story about someone who gets wrapped up in this ugly world that they were curious about. Someone who had to know the hype behind the game and thought that they could handle it. Have tasks and solve something bigger, and a persistent omnipresent oversear who finds you through the botnet virus in the game, sends you messages, and places you on your journey to find the answers or become a victim. 

The idea of binurial beats to cause physical sickness in the game is a concept I really like. In a game like this where there isn't much consequence if you do not immerse yourself or play along, it adds a level of consequence that has not been explored as a mechanic. 

There is a lot of subject matter that can be covered as well, from Johnny Gosch/Jeff Gannon, The Franklin Credit union cover up, the BBC, the people covered in the OHC version of Sad Satan. There is tons of layered Alternate Reality that can be put into to for people who want to go beyond what is put the game. 

Touch on lucifer being the bringer of light. The sad truth that all the subject mater in the game is very much real. The game should have in game tools to solve puzzles like a recorder to play back audio forwards. A text app that decodes wingdings. A smart phone would make a perfect tool ingame as a way for the faceless antagonist(s) to contact the player.

That's just my pitch off the top of my head. If people are going to make it this is the direction I'd like to see it go.",2015-08-09 20:56:59+00:00,ctx89c7,1.0,t3_3e6zkx,1583539.0,sadsatan

The botnet is pure evil and I would love to hear an FBI investigation of what it is being used for (more than likely illegal shit). If you wear headphones, the soundtrack uses binureal beats that make the player neasus, so it makes you physically sick to play the clone. And then of course the CP that makes it illegal. It's genuis in a sick fucked up way and was the perfect troll to both OHC for the fake game to promote his youtube channel trying to pretend that the dark web was some kind of toy to promote himself, and to the fans who wanted to delv into a game about a sick uncomfortable subject of child abuse on the deep web without having the stomach to see it or ever experienced it first hand themselves. It's ugly, sickening, evil, illegal, sickening and terrifying exactly like the subject matter the game covers.

It was one hell of a ballsy troll that added more to the lore and brought the ugly truth in front of everyone.

Semantics. But if that's how you feel it's a moot point.

&gt;Huh? You're going to have to explain some of these things for me, because I clearly do not take this site as seriously as you.

/r/neofag was /r/tumbrinaction for neogaf where they make fun of how stupid neogaf. When all FPH subs were banned, there were new fph subs that were banned and became a game of whack a mole. They even banned wrong subreddits like /r/whalewatching which was litterally whale watching. Meanwhile /r/neofag who did not try and start any other subs saw /r/neogafinaction got banned for ban avoidance despite that they existed before /r/neofag. There was never any harassment on either sub. 

Meanwhile /r/beatingwomen2 which is in existance to avoid a ban is still up.

Selective rule enforcement of unclear rules. SRS brigades, harasses and contacts employers all the time but gets a free pass because /u/kn0thing and /u/ekjp agree with their ideology. 

If it's something you don't give a shit about then you'll never give a shit about it. I enjoyed laughing at neogaf, now making fun of neogaf is ""harassment."" 

The rules make no sense and they've took away stuff I enjoy under the guise of a rule the things I enjoy weren't breaking and refuse to address or respond to the issue. ",2015-07-07 18:14:31+00:00,csv8dc8,6.0,t1_csv7kgl,1147.0,videos

Yishon has even said Ellen is getting a lot of flack for stuff that he screwed up on (not that she is blameless). However rather than /u/kn0thing standing behind the community or atleast helping them after /u/ekjp makes a mess after making a bad call (that wouldn't be an issue in any other type of company) he 100% backs her and mocks the community.

We allow organized campaigns to reach appropriate points of contact, but not individual employees who have nothing to do with the issues.* **It's better than the non answer before, but the problem is the selectiveness in enforcing rules and in all honesty still doesn't tell us anything. SRS harasses regularly, and /r/beatingwomen2 is a sub that was created for evade a ban. /r/Neofag didn't harass users at all, it made fun of neogaf and was the same as /r/tumblrinaction .**

LMAO, glad I'm not the only one who noticed. It's probably because Hunter S. Thompson put telling a good story around a narrative where he injected himself in the middle of it all above getting the facts 100% accurate. 

The difference is Thompson was a character with personality and a warped view of the world that made reading his work an adventure and a joy. These SJW cunts are self absorbed carbon copies of carbon copies who are a dime a dozen. Going Gonzo is pointless if the person injecting themselves into everything is not worth reading about.

693,"This was really poorly thought out. He didn't go into anything in the bill other than saying it is something. What is that ""something"" Is it like the Tennesse bill that makes saying anything that hurts someones feelings illegal and a jailable offense? Is it a Revenge porn bill that further complicates our copyright system? Why is looking at pictures of Anthony Weiners dick okay and the fappening not? 

He clearly didn't research his examples (One of which the FBI said was sending threats to herself and wasting their time and resources) and one minute says ""Police should do something when this happens"" then at the end says that we shouldn't tie up police resources with every mean threat. 

Also what do you plan on doing in international cases. Harassers in the case of Anita Sarkesean were in Brazil. Briana Wu was caught sending threats to her self and was caught lying about leaving her house. 

This was poorly done. I don't know if he is railing against harassment or revenge porn. To use the victim blaming argument doesn't gel well with the internet because certain things ARE preventable on the internet and people should take proper saftey precautions rather than expect everyone to look out for them no matter what info they post online.

I only got less than $20 worth of games. It was stuff thats not popular enough to ever get sales below 50% (Strife &amp; Grapple) and two daily deals that were too good to pass up (Blade symphony for $2.99 for 2 copies, and farcry 1 for $2.50, and Hateo Boyfriend for &lt; $2) 

I was hoping the MKx seaon pass would of had *any* discount or Divinity Original sin would be 66% off, or 50% off hotline Miami 2, or $9.99 Wolfenstein NWO.
