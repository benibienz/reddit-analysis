And I find co workers and clients literally upset to the point of tears. I had to explain to them everything would be fine, that everyone would make it through okay. I refrained from bragging about who I voted for, because 'time and place'. To say the least I was not walking with the MAGA swagger I thought I would.

I sincerely hate that the media has made Trump into this nightmare boogeyman who is going to end us all. Honestly my doomsday scenario would of been either Jeb or Hillary because I do not want unprovoked war with Russia (I would not of been in tears, but I would not be all smiles in the morning). I never saw people this upset. Not when Bush won, not when Obama won, this is kind of heart breaking since so much of it is directed at a straw man caricature. 

All the hate towards one another, all the online censorship and colusion, all of the media collusion. All for what? Are you happy now? These people are suffering real pain for what this coordinated effort put in their head as 'truth'. It's not a game, these are real people's mental well being.

Just wondering if anyone has had similar experiences.

His own response video contradicts itself (mainly the did not split over artistic differences, then admits artistic differences was the reason mid way through). 

He had legit arguments with the accounting, had he gone into detail and said ""look the truth is its boring as fuck accounting issues, I feel he's a shit friend after the leaked convo, and our ideas did not gel. Trust, money and friendship matter.""

Instead he pulled a shit argument where he pivots and changes the subject of the accusation at every turn. 

But I can live with that. The trying to make it sound as if Dick condones rape through out of context editing a convo where he says if women get black out drunk they SHOULD expect rape as a possible outcome, then blaming a fanmade (or maybe not fan made given that it attacked guests) on 8chan. As proof Dick has a rapelist.

It's an insult to our intellegence, addresses nothing for the break up (accept accounting issues, that could be legit). 

Dick straight up admitted he didn't like maddox and saw it as a biz relationship. Maddox came off as a cry baby jealous girlfriend with hurt feelings.

Maddox also leveraging connections he made to condemn Dick and ban him from ucb for a faux rape support accusation (the same guy who wrote an instruction guide how to get away with grouping women) and seeing him continue his ban/block spree is disgusting.

Many of them have garbage degrees in bullshit that they weren't taking advantage of humans will click on content that causes outrage or fear. Without a job saying outrageous shit for attention they have no redeemable skills, no value to society, and nobody who respects them outside of their delusional cliques.

However, being the hypersensitive narcissistic butthurt losers they are who can't deal with the hard reality they are worthless... they like always will create a delusional reality to protect themselves like all narcissists do.

Get ready everyone for a very hillarious month. With south park setadily getting ready to hammer home a brutal season shitting on sjw types and people getting sick off their narcissistic Bullshit because these people are not only disgustingly weak human beings, but entitled and hypocritical, they are now going to try and dispell this the only way sjw parasites know how, living in a made up world of delusion where. Create a narative that they are 100 percent consistent and that if you ""really think about it"" (which seems to be sjw code for 'listen and believe'  the mental gymnastics I'm coming up with) sjws are actually as strong if not stronger than an iraq war veteran and everyone else is beyond weak.

I can already see the excuses they are going to use and for the next month (I say a month because that is usually how long it takes for all the tumblrinas to finish regurgitating and ""adding to"" the same talking point) 

* SJWs are actually stronger because they are smart enough to see all the racism, sexism, (add your own ism here) and are brave enough to call it out and demand other people take action on their behalf censor things for their feels
* SJWs are brave enough to speak the truth even when we get caught lying about facts and people are to scared to deal with uncomfortable topics like rape which we use as a trump card to silence dissent or discussion and make anyone who questions us pro rape, racism (fill in the ism)
* look how thinskinned all these staright white males (yes all straight white males, even the female and minority ones because race and gender are social constructs) are when ever we 'truth tell' by accusing them of being rapists who are racists. Lolololol u mad bro le trollface? 
* My life as a nonstraight white male (even if a straight white male because race and gender are social constructs) means I am under constant attack (after all I place atleast a silver  in the oppression Olympics, also do you see how humble I am for only taking the silver?). Therefore by even existing I am simultaneously the strongest and most oppressed.
* If you ""think about it"" we complain less than (use any humorist, radio host or shock jock who has topics of discussion) the only difference is through harassmen... I mean strength we raise awareness and censo... I mean cause possitive change and not a single straight white male we used as an example ever did that and if you bring up any evidence to the contrary you are cherry picking.
 * Some eff your strength standards nonsense similar to landwhale Tess Munster eff your beauty standards (have you noticed her weight is the only beauty standard she says fuck you to? Not photoshopping her cellulite, not makeup, not being objectified? Only the onle she some how magically falls short of because sexism?) and it will most likely be something along the lines of ""pretending da racism sexism and twitter ptsd doesn't exist doesn't make you strong"" and ""real strength is being brave enough to tell everyone what you feel knowing you'll have to hit block because everyone is too weak to hear it""

Steven even says in his own article he has no confirmation as to why he was cut off by everyone at those companies, and that fact that not even one member of the staff is willing to come forward and speak up says something very different.
If this were a corporation blacklisting forbidding all employees from speaking up, there would be one intern, one production assistant, one ANYBODY who would be willing to come forward and say ""yeah look, they have us signing NDA agreements, no dice Kotaku"" as an anonymous source. Instead we got Totillo whining about what he speculates the reason why is (and somehow this all begins a year ago after GG? Not sayin these companies are GG, but they probably saw that Kotaku is garbage when they doubled down on saying fuck the audience, devs, and anyone not in our clique).
This is Totillo we are talking about. His accomplishments include:

* Defending his staff as labeling David Jaffe a misogynist 
* Defending Nathan Grayson after multiple proofs came out he was dating his subject and providing coverage to promote her
* Writing off Patricia Hernandez's entire garbage fuck ups as innocent mistakes
* Throwing a temper tantrum over DeepFreeze.it
* Not being accountable for the actions of his staff or what his staff shits out
* Justifying GameJournos pro as not comparisons and trying to whitewash gamers are dead narative pushing and buying gifts for their subjects

This isn't a guy who uses his Masters degree in journalism (Whatever that means anymore) to uphold ethics, standards and practices in journalism. He's more like a defense lawyer. He uses what ever knowledge he has to weasel his way out of whatever shit his client (Kotaku) got itself into.

I put my resume online and got contacted by this one company looking to hire for AT&amp;T (what do ya know, I am more than qualified) I figure why not. I go in and it is easily the worse experience I had.

Place gives me the creeps. Some obese creepy old black trainers hit on me touching my chest on my blazer telling me how cute I was. I deal with it. Whatever, I need work and I have a gf. I just need a possition in the mean time while I look for career work or tuition re-embursment for certifications (even though I already have a fucking bach degree).

Then I got a good ol' jesus heaven hell lecture from the wanna be preacher security gaurd in the lobby. He went full heaven hell mode after mentioning I was in the state because most of my family was dead. 

I know not to disparage anyones religion (although it is fucking annoying hearing about my dead family members from a wannabe preacher), and I thought I'd be A-Okay taking the card, letting him talk about jesus, heaven and hell let him give his whole speil and smile and nod. Be polite. Don't rock the boat.

However, different trainer (doing pre-screen interview) apparently did not like that I threw away the evangelical preacher of a security guards church business card away once I completed my testing segment

I got the classic ""don't call us, we'll call you"" speech. I'm 99.9% sure I sealed my doom.

This Subreddit has pretty much 100% cracked this thing in a shocking amount of time for an ARG. 

The short of it? A youtuber made a game and rather than release it, decided to do exclusive lets plays of the game with a mysterious backstory and shocking/creepy subject matter: child abuse. The ARG of Sad Satan was challenging enough to have people try and solve, but easy enough for people to come together and crack it. Someone eventually decided to make a version of this game saying the youtuber did not upload the full version of ""*their*"" game, and uploaded a game that was exactly what you would expect from a game that came from the dark web: ugly, sickening, evil, illegal, and terrifying. 

**My thoughts on what is dubbed the clone version**: I don't condone it, it is pure evil. I do understand it in a sick way, it is exactly what the author intended it to be. I'm actually impressed by the effort the troll went through to fuck people on the clone. The botnet virus in it that took advantage of the urban legend is pure evil.  If you wear headphones, the soundtrack uses binureal beats that make the player neasous, so it makes you physically sick to play the clone. And then of course the CP that makes it illegal. It's genuis in a sick fucked up way and was the perfect troll to both OHC for the fake game to promote his youtube channel trying to pretend that the dark web was some kind of toy to promote himself, and to the fans who wanted to delv into a game about a sick uncomfortable subject of child abuse on the deep web without having the stomach to see it or ever have experienced it first hand themselves. It was one hell of a ballsy troll that added more to the lore and brought the ugly truth in front of everyone. It is honestly a terrifying game (if not for the game play, for the atmosphere and danger the person is in for playing it) that is an honest to god horror to play. It is the only game that I am too scared to play myself and never will. Not like I'm going to act like it was the right thing to do. It wasn't, but given the lore of the game, it is the only game that lived up to the terror. 

**My thought for making this a real game**: Not do the same EXACT game as the 2 versions that exist, and to add some plot, maybe go meta.

* I think an interesting starting point on a meta angle could be the clone, Include the 1st level that is from the clone, cut out the cp, leave in the gore. This is suppose to be an ugly game about an ugly subject that is supposed to rub you the wrong way and strike fear into you.
* I think it should also go full meta, I would make the clone version the catalyst to a story about someone who gets wrapped up in this ugly world that they were curious about. Someone who had to know the hype behind the game and thought that they could handle it. Have tasks and solve something bigger, and a persistent omnipresent oversear who finds you through the botnet virus in the game, sends you messages, and places you on your journey to find the answers or become a victim.
* The idea of binurial beats to cause physical sickness in the game is a concept I really like. In a game like this where there isn't much consequence if you do not immerse yourself or play along, it adds a level of consequence that has not been explored as a mechanic.
* There is a lot of subject matter that can be covered as well, from Johnny Gosch/Jeff Gannon, The Franklin Credit union cover up, the BBC, the people covered in the OHC version of Sad Satan. There is tons of layered Alternate Reality that can be put into to for people who want to go beyond what is put the game.
* Touch on lucifer being the bringer of light. The sad truth that all the subject mater in the game is very much real. I'm familiar with the works of Crowly. If practical occult elements would be brought in I feel they could be handled tastefully. The common thread in much of this Satanic ritual abuse lore isn't that they do it because they ""believe in satan"" it is done so that if someone comes forward nobody believes a crazy story about satan worshiping pedophiles and makes the abused seem crazy. 
* The game should have in game tools to solve puzzles like a recorder to play back audio forwards. A text app that decodes wingdings. Picture altering filters to find hidden things. A smart phone would make a perfect tool ingame as a way for the faceless antagonist(s) to contact the player.

I have no programming skills (I went to school for business) however if a programmer likes my pitch and would like to help make Sad Satan a real game that is more than just a youtuber trying to cash grab on subscribers or a troll infecting the curious with a botnet virus and CP. I want to at least help write but I could also do anything with book keeping, incorporating, ect. I think this can become a real game, that makes people uneasy, and is truly terrifying. A real horror game that doesn't rely on jumpscares. ",sadsatan,If there is anyone interested in making a real version of this game I would be interested in working as a writer for it.

I've been noticing posts of delusional things that KIA has been saying. Trying to claim victories of stuff that isn't. It's as delusional as Ghazitards trying to say they was never a Sarkesian rant against video-games. I think we need to have a reality check (no, not tone police time. I mean a introspective look at some of the stupid shit we have been patting ourselves on the back for.)

- This Jon Stewart shit. No, Ghazi is not wrong or taking it out of context. In case you didn't watch the whole video Jon Stewart goes into how it is okay to go after peoples jobs for their actions, and he's not using ad letter writing campaigns as an example. He's talking about people getting fired for having a confederate flag on private property and defending PC tone policing.
- This GamerGate shot in the new Batman https://twitter.com/HarmfulOpinions/status/613769165107806212  is NOT a win for us. I saw a post saying that Ghazi is dumb because they think its about us. News flash, it is... and it's not about any changes we made or good we've done. It's making fun of us. You should be laughing that they are shitty and terrible when porting and anti-GG rather than doing mental gymnastics to make it seem like the agree with us. 
-  ~~The Honey Badgers (as much as I love 'em) Fucked up. They took the $30,000 they raised and hired a disbarred lawyer https://imgur.com/XjDjgsp . If no real lawyer wouldn't take the case, I would of been fine with them doing other stuff with the money (like paying some 8chan server fees). I love me some honey badgers, but get fucking real guys. This was a huge waste of GG money and you know it.~~ 
-  Blizzard at bliz-con was more than likely referring to us. I thought it was dumb at the beginning that when blizzard made their no online harassment statement that so many clung to that GG wasn't named by name. The truth is many blizzard employees were kissing sjws asses on twitter. Many weren't. After all, a company isn't a hive mind of all their employees. The Blizzard statement was as non-offensive as they could get about the issue. They don't want to lose GG customers, they don't wanna lose SJW customers. End of story. Stop pretending they are discussing Anti-GG. They are against harassment in general and are too busy to research shit or are directly befitting and want to keep their positive connections going.
- George R.R. Martin wasn't on ""or side"". To be honest he could give two shits about GG. He seems like he was trying to play peacekeeper. He was not happy with Sad Puppies, but sad puppies was never OUR fight. He didn't want SJWs to become the facists they became, but don't delude yourselves. 
- InternetAristocrat didn't do an AMA on here. Trust but verify went out the window when that AMA ended up on the front page of KIA. I get being excited, but Jim admitted he's never done any Q&amp;A outside his streams. It was conformable it wasn't Jim... many of his answers like he doesn't visit 8chan anymore are in conflict to things Jim has said. Jim is gone from GG, some say good riddance, some want him back, but we all look dumb when a fake AMA ends up on the front page of KIA. 

Look, we've had some huge victories. Gawker got stomped in the nuts. More devs are turning on SJWs (based Milo has confirmed) but like any good business they don't want to alienate ANYONE. They will just let SJWs throw their tantrums about what ever the mary sue (A site named after a type of character development that leads to poor writing and bad stories) tells them to be outraged about this week.

I will never be a ghazi-tard. I hate political correctness and I was alive in the 90's when this was a thing and it got stomped out for being less ridiculous than it is today.

However I don't want GamerGate to become delusional. If we become delusional people trying to twist every stupid thing into a win, we're no better than them. We're not even losing. Indie devs are starting to go down the toilet like crazy where as before they had a bunch of people who'd buy their game for $3 on a sale just because a game site said it was a good buy. Zoe's BF can't find work and lives off Zoe's hipster welfare. Devs that openly have contempt for games are shutting down doors. Leigh Alexander is begging for hipster welfare on twitter. Many turds have been flushed. 

We're not gonna have victories 100% of the time. People we like will occasionally let us down. Ghazi will occasionally have a point or two. Don't take it personal.

 PR companies will use influence to do shady shit. Laugh at people who go against us when the SJW feels frenzy turns on them and mock them. Just don't try and delude yourselves into thinking everyone is your friend. 

**EDIT: apparently The Honey Badgers are not being represented by the disbarred lawyer. ""That lawyer won't be representing them. He's getting their case together for a much lower fee and handing it off to someone that CAN represent them. And it's perfectly legal. And this is based off of what others here have said is canada law. look it up yourself. ""**",KotakuInAction,"[rant] KIA, we need to talk.
