&gt;The big warning sign is she doesn't talk about her Foundations work and neither does the foundation. The less eyes looking that way and picking apart what they did or did not spend money on is not something they want. For such a big massive helping charity, they are awfully secretive.

The foundation does talk about their work (they have a website, try visiting it), and they are not secretive, they release plenty of detailed financial information. The reason Clinton did not talk about it is because feels beat facts this election, and people *feel* that is nefarious and cherry pick things to support that conclusion. For example, you cherry pick the fact that they only give 10% to *other* charities and ignore the fact that the majority of their money goes to *their own* charity work.

64,"The private / public one is just pragmatisn and one of the ones that reaffirms why I like her actually. Copying from an earlier post I made

Here is the full text of the speech, understand the context. 

&gt;You just have to sort of figure out how to -- getting back to that
word, ""balance"" -- how to balance the public and the private efforts that
are necessary to be successful, politically, and that's not just a comment
about today. That, I think, has probably been true for all of our history,
and if you saw the Spielberg movie, Lincoln, and how he was maneuvering and
working to get the 13th Amendment passed, and he called one of my favorite
predecessors, Secretary Seward, who had been the governor and senator from
New York, ran against Lincoln for president, and he told Seward, I need
your help to get this done. And Seward called some of his lobbyist friends
who knew how to make a deal, and they just kept going at it. I mean,
politics is like sausage being made. It is unsavory, and it always has been
that way, but we usually end up where we need to be. But if everybody's
watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you
know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both
a public and a private position. And finally, I think -- I believe in
evidence-based decision making. I want to know what the facts are. I mean,
it's like when you guys go into some kind of a deal, you know, are you
going to do that development or not, are you going to do that renovation or
not, you know, you look at the numbers. You try to figure out what's going
to work and what's not going to work. 

The idea that the people try to claim is that the public and private positions are opposite to each other, which isn't what she's saying. Instead they work together:	for example, you may personally believe the minimum wage should be $15, but you know that's impossible to achieve in the current political climate so instead you publically try to achieve $12. Then later you can possibly try and achieve $15. She cites Lincoln pushing the 13th amendment as an example, which is a great thing to read up on, it gives an example of what she is talking about right there. This just reaffirms that hillary is a pragmatist and goes for realistic goals, instead of going for ideals that may not be possible.

&gt;Seem to be hearing this line a lot this election.

Well we can't undo the decision, we can only hope that you guys were right about Trump. 

&gt;Feel free to save the post and post a screenshot of it when Trump sends people to conversion therapy to name and shame me. 

To be clear, you understand that I'm referring to parents being allowed to make their children to go to conversion therapy, not trump rounding up gay people and sending them to conversion therapy in some sort of weird nazi-esque scenario. And its already legal in most of the country, no screenshots required. Instead we will see if he obstructs efforts to outlaw them, along with the other anti-lgbt policies that the GOP supports. 


Edit: I will add tho that Chris Christie was against conversion which is definitely good if he ends up near trump

&gt;The government is controlled by Republicans, by slim majorities. Which is why I said Trump will need the support from Democrats if he wants to push through a pro LGBT agenda.  

&gt;At the end of the day, the election is over.. I'm not trying to convince you to vote for Trump. All I need is for democrats in government to support Trump when he actually does the right thing.

It's actually the other way around tho? Democrats are always going to be fighting for LGBT rights. If trump decides to be pro LGBT, Democrats are gonna be *all over that*. Republicans are gonna fight that. YOU guys, the new Republican party, need to change YOUR party. But that can only happen if you can acknowledge the anti-LGBT issues and real fears of the LGBT community, not pretend they don't exist.

140,".**4** this is one of the ones that reaffirms why I like her actually.

Here is the full text of the speech

&gt;You just have to sort of figure out how to -- getting back to that
word, ""balance"" -- how to balance the public and the private efforts that
are necessary to be successful, politically, and that's not just a comment
about today. That, I think, has probably been true for all of our history,
and if you saw the Spielberg movie, Lincoln, and how he was maneuvering and
working to get the 13th Amendment passed, and he called one of my favorite
predecessors, Secretary Seward, who had been the governor and senator from
New York, ran against Lincoln for president, and he told Seward, I need
your help to get this done. And Seward called some of his lobbyist friends
who knew how to make a deal, and they just kept going at it. I mean,
politics is like sausage being made. It is unsavory, and it always has been
that way, but we usually end up where we need to be. But if everybody's
watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you
know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both
a public and a private position. And finally, I think -- I believe in
evidence-based decision making. I want to know what the facts are. I mean,
it's like when you guys go into some kind of a deal, you know, are you
going to do that development or not, are you going to do that renovation or
not, you know, you look at the numbers. You try to figure out what's going
to work and what's not going to work. 

The idea that the above site tries to push is that the public and private positions are opposite to each other, which isn't what she's saying. Instead they work together:	for example, you may personally believe the minimum wage should be $15, but you know that's impossible to achieve in the current political climate so instead you publically try to achieve $12. Then later you can possibly try and achieve $15. She cites Lincoln pushing the 13th amendment as an example, which is a great thing to read up on, it gives an example of what she is talking about right there. This just reaffirms that hillary is a pragmatist and goes for realistic goals, instead of going for ideals that may not be possible.",2016-11-03 14:10:27+00:00,d9jygfs,1.0,t3_5awllk,3671.0,askhillarysupporters
141,"Thank you for actually providing the emails that provide you concern, this could be a good thread.

.**48** Here someone floats the idea to podesta to use the fact that hillaries server was never shown to be hacked as a defense of hillary. Podesta says he doesn't want to use that defense because it would imply that hillary used a personal server for security reasons. This email does not reveal anything new because hillary didn't claim she used the server for better security, she claimed she used the server for convenience.

The above site uses a false dichotomy and strawman to claim the email shows intent, implying the only two reasons that she could have the server was ""for better security (strawman) or to dodge FOIA requests"", then claims the email eliminates the first reason so it must be the second reason. It ignores hillaries own stated reason for using the server the whole time.

&gt;I just want to say, Trump never said Mexicans are rapists. He said Illegal Immigrants are rapists. And we are in fact losing jobs to China. Not trying to be rude, but when taking those quotes out of context they do seem racist.

Sure, look at the transcript and provide the context where he says illegal immigrants. You'll notice he never says it, its very ambiguous as to what he is referring to and could very well refer to legal immigrants.

146,"&gt;Normally I'd agree with you, but his income on his tax returns are going to show to be severely reduced because of all his tax write-offs.


&gt; Nope! It won't show details like that. Only the numbers that come in and out, but not their source (in most cases). Schedule E of tax returns would be the best bet at locating the source of any income, but I'm not optimistic you'd find it there.

Okay, thank you for the clarification!

&gt;He does use himself. He's said it in the debates that the loopholes in the tax code are ridiculous.

Yea, he said that *after* his tax returns leaked. Kind of not what I meant, lmao, it's not the same if he is forced to admit it

&gt;This is part of his plan to boost the economy. Lower taxes -&gt; More disposable income -&gt; more spending -&gt; more movement of money -&gt; stronger economy

That goes into a separate economics debate that id rather not get into, but I will say that that's also exactly what a person who is only in the running for self-gain would say. Which is why I have the problem - nothing here suggests a person who is willing to work beyond self interest.

149,"Sorry for the late response!

Okay, so thanks for the information, I see that many of the things people are saying that his tax returns will reveal are overstated. Can't really agree that it is ""just dust in the wind"" tho..

Of course I am much less familiar with tax returns than you are so feel free to correct me if I am wrong anywhere

&gt;Also, tax returns are only for one fiscal year. We'll see his income for 2015, but that doesn't show how wealthy he is. I'm a mortgage loan officer and see tax returns everyday. I've had borrowers who make over $250,000+ a year, but they spend their money as fast as it comes. They make a boat load of money, but they're not wealthy because it disappears so quickly. They don't invest it. They spend it. I've also had borrowers who make only $50,000 a year, but have over $150,000 in the bank because they are smart with their money. So, the tax returns won't really show you wealth or give you any good indication of wealth.

I think most of us are asking for more than just one year right? Most presidential candidates have released more than one year as far as I know. It's why we still want to see them after 1 year was already leaked. And while it shows income and not wealth, I'd argue income is definitely useful to have if there's a few years of tax returns. After all, his campaign is run on a platform of claiming to greatly improve our economy, not maintain our current trend. While I agree that a small income isn't necessarily an indicator of him being bad at business or being unhealthy, I think it should be fair game to criticize since he builds much of his campaign on hyperbole. 

&gt;It won't show his relationship with Russia (if it exists) because once again, tax returns don't go into detail. On his schedule E you'll be able to see the property that he personally owns and their addresses, but that's only if he rents them out and collects income off of them.

Won't it show income he received from Russian sources? In the same way Clinton was accused of having a relationship with the banks because she received income from them through her taxes? Won't that give some evidence of relationships? Recurring income sources? Could be completely wrong here

&gt;It WILL show you how much he has donated to charity for that particular fiscal year. That it will show under ""charitable donations"". It may be a high number, it may be a low number. I think it will be a pretty high number because of all the fundraisers he has held and the entire celebrity apprentice series. I think people will pick at him by comparing his charitable donations to his income and saying that he should donate more, but hey. He can do whatever he wants with his money.

I think its very important, but Ill come back to that in a second.

&gt; which I don't understand because who the heck wants to pay taxes? I don't think anyone in the history of history has looked at their tax bill and said ""Oh, that's it? Here, let me give you more because you're definitely not taxing me enough"". Even if you're not self-employed, you still want to pay as little in tax as possible right? Well, you can do that too if you have a good CPA that knows what they're doing!

I partially agree, but two issues here. First, is tied with the charity point above. Lets say I'm super rich, I completely agree that I would want to pay as little tax as possible. But to make up for that, I would make donations to charities. you say that "" It may be a high number, it may be a low number"". Perception right now, is that it is a low number as far as I can see. Sure, I don't have any polls to back that up, but a google search of ""donald trump charity"" is way more negative to me. Poor evidence, i know. But it is a common left talking point that he doesn't. It shouldn't be a matter of assumption. Trump should be able to demonstrate that he donates to charity, not expect me to take him at his word.


2nd issue is hypocrisy here, at least to me. Other things he's said about taxes:

*""Facebook billionaire gives up his U.S. citizenship in order to save taxes. I guess 3.8 billion isn't enough for @TheRealSaverin. He's taking off to Singapore but will continue to enjoy the fruits of the U.S.""*

*“The hedge fund guys are getting away with murder,” ""They're paying nothing and it's ridiculous. I want to save the middle class,"" Trump said. ""The hedge fund guys didn't build this country. These are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky.""""*

*“You do have a large percentage of people not paying taxes,” Trump said. “You do have a large percentage of people that feel that they’re entitled.”*

Okay, so I can agree that it's perfectly okay to legally minimize your legal burden. But then why is he attacking other people for doing the same thing? He's not attacked the system here, he is attacking the people for not paying their fair share.  Why is he not being *honest* about his use of loopholes also?
If he *sincerely* wants to fix the issue, why not use himself as a prime example? He had no problem using the same argument when it comes to corruption, saying how he bribed other people.

Also continuing on that argument, you said 

&gt;""I don't think anyone in the history of history has looked at their tax bill and said ""Oh, that's it? Here, let me give you more because you're definitely not taxing me enough"".""

Except look at this? https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/21/new-york-millionaires-who-want-taxes-raised

Sure they didn't just *give* the government more money, but they are clearly working against their own interests to ask them to be raised

Whereas trump has proposed a plan that will *lower* his taxes. (yes everyone's taxes I know) Which kind of doesn't jive with the idea that he is interested in closing loopholes that will cause him to pay *more*



&gt;Why hasn't he released them? Most likely because most of the nation is tax return illiterate and they won't know how to properly interpret them. They'll assume whatever they want to fit their own narrative, so it's really a no-win situation for Trump to release his returns.

Sorry but I'd say this applies to every presidential candidate. Clinton certainly didn't gain much from releasing hers and her foundations tax returns, that just gave people the speeches to banks scandal and now people just comb through them looking for tenuous connections between people who donated to her foundation and anything political. It's also a bit insulting to those of us that DO have a bit of more factual basis to our opinions. I also disagree that it's necessarily a no-win situation, if he DID have large charitable contributions he could easily shut down the whole ""you didn't pay taxes"" argument. It's such an easy, *compelling*, argument to make, ""I didn't pay taxes because the government sucks, instead i gave to our country directly,"" The stuff really writes itself. The only reason I can see for someone not playing that argument is that they don't have the charity donations to back it up.

As we have a positive view of Hillary and you (probably) have a negative view of Hillary, our assumption will be positive while yours will be negative. You can't really have an argument with that.

To back up my positive assumption, I will say that Hillary is known as a policy wonk. Like other people have said, this would be an obvious question and not something she would really need to know in advance to prepare for.

And that's pretty much how all conspiracy theories work.

Until I had the bold the words and make them gigantic?



&gt;1. People got fired
2. Outside sources(CNN video, wikileaks email dumps, social media pictures &amp; video) validate information stated in these videos, going so far as to place several of the people on video at the scenes in which they later brag about the things they did at those scenes.
3. the media despite their best effort has offered zero evidence to suggest these videos are fake.

I'll start with 1, that's easy, simple counter example

##People got fired for acorn too, and it was proven fake. 

I'll only respond to 2. and 3. If you admit firing is not proof of videos being real, because if you can't admit that's not evidence there's really no hope for you in this argument

&gt;That's suggesting tunnel vision. They are trying to pin it on Russia, there for are working it backwards trying to determine Russian motive as evidence.

This is your unfounded accusation. There is no reason for an independent company to be ""trying to pin it on russia"", that would undercut their reputation if evidence comes out that they are wrong. Indeed, it seems you are working backward from your conclusion ""there is no evidence""	to decide that they are somehow trying to pin it on Russia with no evidence.

202,"&gt;However they are making their own evidence and conclusions, not working off of the government evidence

While they aren't working with the government, they did work directly with the DNC. Therefore, they had access to evidence, they aren't making their own. Also, you are drawing your conclusion with no evidence at all.

https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/

*""CrowdStrike Services Inc., our Incident Response group, was called by the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the formal governing body for the US Democratic Party, to respond to a suspected breach""*

&gt; Thanks for the link. I should warn you that I am a software engineer, so perhaps I understand what they are saying far more than the average Internet user. 

Of course, and realize that person who wrote that post works in cybersecurity (unsourced claim, but so is yours =P). Working in software engineering may not give you full understanding of netsec issues. It's a bit silly to say ""i work in a different computer field, so I know why this cybersecurity firm employing multiple professionals well versed in cyberecurity are wrong""

&gt;The fact that certain tools only used by certain people, these are not things that anyone can know unless they have seen the hackers computer. 

It doesn't have to be the same exact person, it could be multiple people in a group or whatever. These people weren't script kiddies using publically available tools. 

&gt;Instead we can see techniques, and many techniques are public knowledge. Seriously.

And of course, some aren't,  which is the whole point of the argument.

&gt;An analogy would be to claim a gunshot wound to the head is an MO in and of itself 

Flawed analogy, like i said above, the whole article is about how their tools and techniques are unique, with evidence. Your analogy would apply to a script kiddie, not this actor.


&gt;without access to the server that was hacked they have no idea what didn't work

They did have access to the server that was hacked.

&gt;And the final flaw is the suggestion that any information identifying the type of hack can be known from the leaks themselves. This is a largely illogical leap to make. If they wanted to make it they should have explained better how, unfortunately they never did. 

I'm not sure what suggestion you are talking about. It's more about motive, which is a valid thing to draw conclusions from.

And yes, you can see how when they link to any politics thread they actually visit the subreddit and change the comments to anti-clinton, that's why they were banned from linking to the subreddit. 

Furthermore, r/politics has always had a consistent slant of pro liberal. In the primaries, sanders was the favorite candidate, so everything was overwhelmingly anti clinton, not pro trump.

269,"First off, thanks for the in depth respectful response, and I apologize for being combative! 

&gt; and a lot of controversial ideas that he probably could've nailed this election if he dropped. Yet he didnt and thats because he sticks to what he truly believes and does not lie about what he would do for votes.

&gt;Love him or hate him, a certain amount of respect is owed to him for sticking to what he thinks.

I really don't see this. He definitely backs off a lot of his controversial ideas, and changes his mind alot.

From changing ideas on a deportation force, muslim ban to extreme vetting, guns in classrooms vs no guns in classrooms, japan should have nukes to they shouldn't, the military should break the law when he tells them to no they shouldn't, knowing more than the generals to listening to them, from ""certainly would not"" do first strike to maybe he would, get rid of federal min wage to raise it, his changing tax plan

I mean, the whole general ""build a wall, and less immigrants"" is consistent I guess.

I know this is obviously a biased list here and thus a bit nitpicky:
http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/full-list-donald-trump-s-rapidly-changing-policy-positions-n547801
But it's all trump quotes and I feel he is just all over the place

&gt;And if you don't want to take my word for it, take Jill Steins word for it, someone whose ideas are much more left wing then even hillary, and has no reason to support someone like trump: ""A Vote for Hillary Clinton Is A Vote For War’, and has stated that under a trump presidency she wouldn't sleep easy at night, under a hillary presidency she wouldn't be alive to sleep. 

And Bernie's ideas are also super left wing and he is steadfastly adamant that we need to vote for hilllary =P 

Clinton has been endorsed by way way way more left wing people than trump lol

Just defeat isis and take the oil? You say that like it wouldn't need a huge ground campaign and require us to occupy those areas as we take that countries natural resources. Just think about it.. that's not just an in and out thing... That's not a defensive strategy at all.

275,"&gt;So basically if I was feminist and still believed that the 19th amendment should be abolished, would I be a defender of women's rights??? 

Bad analogy, and an oversimplification. In your example, you would be moving backwards in terms of rights, as women currently have the right to vote and you would be that taking away. Hillary has always been for more rights for LGBT, not less.

A better example would be someone in the 1910s who was for women voting rights, but against a women's right to abortion.
That person would still be considered a moderate feminist, because at the time they had none of those rights. So that person was in favor of women having MORE rights then they had at the time.

Whereas if you take the exact same views in a modern environment, you wouldn't be considered a feminist. Women have both the right to abortion and the right to vote already, so you would be trying to take away rights they already have. (like the GOP is trying to do)

&gt;That still doesn't explain shit like Sunday night when they posted the article about Trump putting her in jail like it was a rallying cry only to delete it when they saw all the old posters flood in to agree that she should be put on trial.

There's definitely a feedback loop where the pro Hillary jerk and downvoting drives out people that aren't pro Hillary but there's also very clearly CTR astroturfing that sets the tone of all discussion that is allowed to happen. 

Are you accusing the mods of politics of being shills? I don't know what thread you are talking about. 

And the 9/11 point you are making is absolute speculation , you could just as easily explain it as all the Clinton haters rushing back to politics to post about it (because it obviously was huge news), Whereas Clinton supporters didn't have a compelling defense of it (I know I mostly stuck to pro clinton subs to discuss the effect it would have on the campaign)

Think about it, when are you most likely to visit and post alot in r/politics? When a big scandal hits the candidate you hate. 

In fact if CTR was actually shilling,  you'd think during a scandal like that is when they'd be out in full force, because that's the point right? To suppress anti clinton stuff?

On the otherhand, the clinton earpiece story was easily debunkable just by looking at any of the other photographs of the event, and the truepundit never even published a retraction of the story. **THIS IS POOR JOURNALISM** and the fact that you would believe anything from this publication means you are *gullible as fuck*.

These accusations were met with counter-accusations of misogyny, and from there, the movement had drawn enough attention to warrant people threatening on both sides.

If the original basis was actually about journalists promoting shitty games and not about sexism, why wasn't the scandal directed towards the journalist?

419,"&gt; Again, it being a conservative source does not discredit it

Of course not, I never made that argument. I was pointing out that the only way to discredit the claim IS to discredit the source. So when your first comment says ""convince it's wrong *without* attacking the source"", its a bit silly.

Now to give you evidence, lets follow the source. 

Torontosun.com cites [Truepundit.com](http://truepundit.com/under-intense-pressure-to-silence-wikileaks-secretary-of-state-hillary-clinton-proposed-drone-strike-on-julian-assange/) as the source.

Truepundit claims ""anonymous State Department sources"" as the source.

Now, obviously, we can't independently verify those sources. So the next best step is to look at the credibility of truepundit.com

A [previous article](http://truepundit.com/nypd-hillary-clinton-was-wearing-invisible-earpiece-to-receive-stealth-coaching-during-live-nbc-tv-town-hall/) by them claimed that ""NYPD sources involved with the NBC forum’s security detail confirm Clinton was wearing an ‘inductive earpiece,”""

[another article](http://truepundit.com/rigged-damning-video-busts-hillary-using-hand-signals-to-trigger-lester-holt/) promoted the theory that Clinton used hand signals to signal Lester Holt during the debate.

They also claimed that [clintons little shimmy](http://truepundit.com/astute-trump-notices-hillary-shaking-with-eyes-closed-at-debate-looks-to-his-family-mumbles-seizure/) was actually in fact a seizure, on live TV.

723,"&gt;The decision to withhold a rating had nothing to do with concerns about the Clinton Foundation’s charitable work. Further, Minuitti said citing only the 6 percent of the budget spent on grants as the sum total spent on charity by the foundation — as Willis and Fiorina did — is inaccurate.
She referred us to page 10 of the 2013 990 form for the Clinton Foundation. When considering the amount spent on “charitable work,” she said, one would look not just at the amount in grants given to other charities, but all of the expenses in Column B for program services. That comes to 80.6 percent of spending. (The higher 89 percent figure we cited earlier comes from a CharityWatch analysis of the Clinton Foundation and its affiliates.)
“That’s the standard way” to measure a charity’s performance, Minuitti said. “You have to look at the entirety of that column.”
Minuitti said it is also inaccurate to assume all money spent on travel and salaries does not go toward charity. Depending on the nature of the charity, she said, travel and salary could certainly be considered expenses related to charity.

I would dispute that.

Is the concept of an African American child going to elementary school noteworthy? No, it is only noteworthy if it is the 1960s and she is the first one going to a formerly all white school. 

I agree, I think gender isn't a good reason to vote for someone. 

I think preferring to vote for someone because of they are the first of their gender to possibly achieve president of a country where they were historically second class citizens is reasonable. 

Which brings me to my second point, which is that it's not the *only* reason. 

If the Clinton was a male and trump was a female, I don't think the entire women vote would suddenly go to trump. Other things other than gender matter too. 

Its a dismissal because you are implying that democrats are *only* voting because of her gender, and not because of her policy and etc. Its like if I said im voting for her because of her stance on education, and you said 	""wow you must not care about gun control at all then"".

You are understating the importance of having the first African American elected. Its an accomplishment in itself, even if there were no major benefits outside of that. 
If electing an African American to the highest position in the government of the united states is ""pandering"", I think the African American community is perfectly fine with that. Its progress, and better than what the other side is offering. Same reason why Clinton is getting the woman's vote.

No shit, I never said they wont admit they aren't in a safe space (half the time, because plenty of people are also denying that its a safe space in those threads). The point was that The_Donald is not a safe space for *satirical* reasons, but for practical reasons.

&gt; Anywhore, I don't get your issue with it. Hypocritical? Sure,

Point out where I said I had an issue with the_donald being a safe space? The only point I made, from the beginning, is that it is hypocritical. I see nothing wrong with the_donald being a safe space at all. Like you said, even ""nimble navigators"" on that thread kind of see where its hypocritical. It's literally the only point i was trying to make.

846,"&gt;In fact, this is the first sentence I see that clearly acknowledges that TD would be OK with some versions of safe spaces. Thank you for seeing my point.

I said 
""For soldiers with ptsd? Sure, I could see them being okay with that""
I thought that was a pretty clear acknowledgement.

&gt;Can you tell me where I might find such a clue on this site? I mean, it's pretty obvious to me, since I have a pretty good idea on how English sarcasm works. 

Our Company -&gt; About us -&gt; What if I want to sue is a clarification. The Daily Currant, About us explicitly states it is satirical. (I have to wonder, did you even look for 30 seconds? It's quite clearly stated) It's not even about having an explicit mention though

As you said, ""It is pretty obvious"" to you. There's obvious indicators that' If you search, you can figure out that it's satirical. It's easy to demonstrate how its satirical, even if it wasn't explicitly stated on the website (and it was)

&gt;Liberals these days seem pretty determined to not get jokes,

You are trying to paint this as me determined not to get it, but quite the contrary, I am literally begging you for evidence that it is satirical. 

Cmon. I searched ask trump supporters and found threads on the issue.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/4ev6ar/is_there_any_evidence_for_and_against_that_rthe/

Literally nobody says that the point is to be satirical. The majority of it is justifications on how their safe space is justified while other safe spaces aren't, or claiming that it is not actually a safe space, for *reasons*

Why are you making the same argument again?

Some form of safe space they would agree with, okay. The specific form of safe space that the_donald is, that's the type they rail against. That is *undeniably* hypocritical. 

And yes, there has to be *some* indication of satire. Otherwise you could just defend anything as satire. ""This person being hypocritical? Nope! Its satire!""

850,"&gt;And I think that's by design, don't you?

LMAO, no fucking way, i dont think so

&gt;If asked in a sincere conversation, you'd see a wide range of support (or derision) for the spectrum of safe spaces. 

lmao, Just a few posts ago you agreed that an overwhelming majority would be against them. This is pure speculation that is only fueled by wishful thinking, all the evidence speaks against that.


&gt;But by being the epitome of a bad safe space (aka, an echo chamber) they're forcing people to acknowledge that safe spaces can in fact be bad.

I mean I give you props for coming up with this response. There is pretty much only one way you can justify being a complete hypocrite, and that's if you were to do it on purpose, to illustrate a point, in a satirical manner. 

Whats your evidence for this, tho? Your reasoning is basically ""They are being hypocritical, so it must be satire"". Why? I see no evidence that this is the case. There is literally nothing that points to this being the case. How is this not, again, wishful thinking on your part?

For example, compare this to SRS. [SRS plainly states in its faq that it is intentionally hypocritical.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/o0pdv/meta_srs_faq/) Meanwhile, The_Donald gives straight reasons why it has strict bans in its faq. None of them are satirical.

Speeches a bad sign? Sure, perfectly reasonable criticism.

Can you *suspect* that she may be more forgiving to wall st? Okay, understandable.

Are the speeches proof that she's been bought out by the banks? No.


&gt; What issue has she ever spear-headed while it was politically unpopular? That's a real question. I'm not aware of her ever being at the front of anything that wasn't politically beneficial to her career. 

Isn't [Hilarycare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton#Health_care_and_other_policy_initiatives) a perfect example of exactly that?

&gt;In January 1993, President Clinton named First Lady Clinton to chair a Task Force on National Health Care Reform, hoping to replicate the success she had in leading the effort for Arkansas education reform.[155] Unconvinced regarding the merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), she privately urged that passage of health care reform be given higher priority.[156][157] The recommendation of the task force became known as the Clinton health care plan, a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance organizations. Its opponents quickly derided the plan as ""Hillarycare"", and it faced opposition from even some Democrats in Congress.[158][159] Some protesters against the proposed plan became vitriolic, and during a July 1994 bus tour to rally support for the plan, Clinton wore a bulletproof vest at times.[158][159]
Clinton greets U.S. troops at Tuzla Air Base in Bosnia during a visit in December 1997.

&gt;Failing to gather enough support for a floor vote in either the House or the Senate, although Democrats controlled both chambers, the proposal was abandoned in September 1994.[158] Clinton later acknowledged in her memoir that her political inexperience partly contributed to the defeat, but cited many other factors. The First Lady's approval ratings, which had generally been in the high-50s percent range during her first year, fell to 44 percent in April 1994 and 35 percent by September 1994.[160]

&gt;Republicans made the Clinton health care plan a major campaign issue of the 1994 midterm elections,[161] which saw a net Republican gain of fifty-three seats in the House election and seven in the Senate election, winning control of both; many analysts and pollsters found the plan to be a major factor in the Democrats' defeat, especially among independent voters.[162] The White House subsequently sought to downplay Hillary Clinton's role in shaping policy.[163] Opponents of universal health care would continue to use ""Hillarycare"" as a pejorative label for similar plans by others.[164]

you are *SO* full of shit. Your entire argument is based on the (flawed) premise that ""hillary is corrupt"" and therefore everyone should choose bernie instead, and thats why bernie supporters shouldn't compromise and the democratic party should. Then you fail to see why Hilary supporters and the DNC wouldn't be swayed by your ""plain math""!

&gt;Bernie supporters unwilling to compromise vote for Hillary = so principled, standing for their beliefs Never said this. These Bernie supporters do not want to align with a corrupt party nor a corrupt candidate. You won't change my mind on this. The DNC and Hillary are both unethical and its a shame the democratic party allowed this to happen. I'm sorry you and your party have put on such a dismal display that you can't get the Bernie supporters to support your candidate. Its not my fault she has such low approval ratings. 

aka ""Bernie supporters unwilling to compromise = so principled, standing for their beliefs"" instead of aligning with the ""evil corrupt DNC""

the fact that you deny that's what you are saying and then immediately say it is pretty funny

&gt;DNC unwilling to **compromise** (recognize there is a fracture amongst democrats and bernie voters who do not support Hillary which could easily be fixed by nominating Sanders instead of Hillary= selfish (yes!))

Yes the word for that would be called *compromise* if that were to happen, by **definition**, since the democratic parties choice was Hilary Clinton, not Bernie. What you described is the *reason* they would be compromising in this fantasy scenario

I love when people try to wriggle out with semantics! At least try harder tho

&gt; For whatever reason, you seem to believe that Bernie Supporters hav an obligation to stopping Trump and getting a Democrat in the White House. They don't. In my view, only established democratic party members have this obligation TO THEIR PARTY. I don't believe in Hillary, I don't trust in Hillary, and I certainly do not find the democratic party all that appealing. Why don't you try to sell Hillary to me instead of cramming her down my throat with threats of Trump? And that's the problem right there, you need to sell Hillary to these people. But you can't because she is a vile, establishment career politician who will do anything to get into office. In no way is there hypocrisy here. You simply have one side who wants to get a democrat into office, and the other side who wants to get a solid political figure into office regardless of party affiliation. Bernie is the man for the job and Hillary is just a divisive figure who will never gain the support of people in the latter grouping. 

bla bla bla more ""our candidate is a pure holy saint and your candidate is the devil""... sure this argument totally isn't about whether hilary is good or bad, *riiiight*

&gt;Now before you say something stupid like ""Well this is the reason why sanders supporters should follow Hillary"" let me make this point very clear. The DEMOCRATIC PARTY has this obligation to do whatever it takes to get a DEMOCRAT into office. The VOTERS have an NO OBLIGATION TO ANYONE.

Oh man! But how do we choose *which* democrat the party should support? 

Like lets say if half the party wants one candidate, and the other wants a different one?

I know! We could hold some sort of election, maybe a nomination process! And then the voters in that party could decide who best supports their interest! And then the rest of the party could rally around them, once the nominee is chosen, with the focus of putting that democratic candidate in office. 

And then later, a bunch of outsiders can come into the party, lose while continually insulting us, then expect to be catered to because ""they don't compromise and also hilary is literally the devil""

im sure that will work out well!

Second of all, I would argue that your interpretation of your definition is wrong. Its broader, not narrower. Somebody who *gets a sex change* is certainly not conforming to societal gender norms or rules, and thus would be considered transgender. If you disagree, I would love to hear your reasoning.

Honestly tho, I just used a ""magical sex change"" for simplicity. If you want to define trans as """"noting or relating to a person who does not conform to societal gender norms or roles."""", then I'll just say that it seems obvious to me that you can be non-conforming to soecietal gender norms or roles without feeling distress and dysphoria over it.

&gt;In my opinion if you have had a sex change you are no longer transgender, you are the one you transitioned to.

“So if Secretary Clinton really were an expert at what's classified and what’s not classified and we're following the manual, the absence of a header would tell her immediately that those three documents were not classified,” Cartwright remarked. “Am I correct in that?”

Comey called it a “reasonable inference.”""",2016-07-11 15:26:35+00:00,d57y2su,11.0,t1_d57wmt4,2075.0,politics

1051,"So you chose to latch onto one word and decided it meant the foundation wasn't doing good charitable work, even when your own source *explicitly, multiple times* says not to draw that conclusion? 

&gt;""Our removal of The Clinton Foundation from our site is neither a condemnation nor an endorsement of this charity. We reserve the right to reinstate a rating for The Clinton Foundation as soon as we identify a rating methodology that appropriately captures its business model.

&gt;What does it mean that this organization isn’t rated?

&gt;It simply means that the organization doesn’t meet our criteria. A lack of a rating does not indicate a positive or negative assessment by Charity Navigator.""

From the article I posted and you ignored:

""We spoke by phone with Sandra Minuitti at Charity Navigator, and she told us Charity Navigator decided not to rate the Clinton Foundation because the foundation spun off some entities (chiefly the Health Access Initiative) and then later brought some, like the Clinton Global Initiative, back into the fold. Charity Navigator looks at a charity’s performance over time, she said, and those spin-offs could result in a skewed picture using its analysis model. If the foundation maintains its current structure for several years, she said, Charity Navigator will be able to rate it again.
The decision to withhold a rating had nothing to do with concerns about the Clinton Foundation’s charitable work. Further, Minuitti said citing only the 6 percent of the budget spent on grants as the sum total spent on charity by the foundation — as Willis and Fiorina did — is inaccurate.
She referred us to page 10 of the 2013 990 form for the Clinton Foundation. When considering the amount spent on “charitable work,” she said, one would look not just at the amount in grants given to other charities, but all of the expenses in Column B for program services. That comes to 80.6 percent of spending. (The higher 89 percent figure we cited earlier comes from a CharityWatch analysis of the Clinton Foundation and its affiliates.)
“That’s the standard way” to measure a charity’s performance, Minuitti said. “You have to look at the entirety of that column.”""

&gt;You don't think that a politician being directly paid millions of dollars over the course of a couple years by wall street banks will be at all beholden to those banks for the money given?

How do you think this works? Do you think they just revoke the speaking fees if she doesn't listen to them after she gets in office? This is conjecture. 

&gt; In politics, being paid a large sum of money to talk to a room for a few minutes is a legal loophole that allows people to pay politicians for access or favors.

Conjecture


&gt; By being paid for a ""service"", no matter how flimsy, they are able to sidestep the inconvenience of being arrested for bribery.

Conjecture

&gt; If a company pays a politician $250,000 to talk to them and their close associates at dinner and then that politicians supports a bill in congress that said company needed passed would that not seem at all to you like bribery by other means? It's bribery.

Sure, but what evidence has this happened?
Note that the important part is that the politician changed their policy in favor of the company. Why is just a donation evidence of a bribe? Companies make donations to politicians all the time, do you think every single donation is a bribe?

Note that these speaking fees are pretty typical. 

 &gt;The thought that those companies give her, personally, millions of dollars and that she owes them nothing in return is incredibly stupid and I actually don't believe that you truly don't understand this.

What's sad is that you repeat pure conjecture as fact, and then try and paint me as stupid when I don't agree with you. But that's not even the point I'm making, I'm just illustrating your bias.

I see your perspective here. You are weighing a ""risk"" of suicide vs permanent changes. But this is an unfair comparison. The real situation is ""risk"" of suicide vs ""risk"" of regretting permanent changes right? You have to compare the risks of both options, and the severity of the consequences if you choose wrong.

Look if I change the words, I can make the same argument you are making in reverse:
***
""A *preventable* Risk of sex change regret is less detrimental than finality of Death.

Sex change regret is a regrettable risk which can be mitigated beforehand, Death is a change that will never be undone if it turns out the person really needed the acceptance from his/her parents.""
***
There are two options, to support your child or not, and they both have detrimental risks.

The data on suicide regret isn't conclusive. But so far, it does suggest that the risk much less likely to happen than suicide.
Death is undeniably a consequence worse than regretting a sex change operation.

I think reducing the risk of suicide should be the MAIN goal - and currently the evidence we have suggests that emotional support for your child is the best option to do that. And its not like risk of suicide is the only negative effect that occurs when you deny them the support - it has negative mental effects along the board

1254,"&gt;Transphobic perhaps in the sense of being afraid of such a huge and potentially destroying change in his daughter's life. I'd say it's a good thing and reflects actual care and consideration as a parent

It's always good to be cautious, and to take careful consideration of risks. No one should just ""jump in"" to such a major change in life. That being said, that person is not being ""cautious"", but is actually 100% against his child transitioning no matter what. (at 18 no less, so lets not try and make this about children transitioning at young ages)

Now consider this data.

http://transpulseproject.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Impacts-of-Strong-Parental-Support-for-Trans-Youth-vFINAL.pdf

&gt;First and foremost, our findings show clear associations between the support that trans youth experience from their parents and numerous health outcomes . The most significant differences show that **trans youth who have strong parental support for their gender identity and expression report higher life satisfaction, higher self - esteem, better mental health including less depression and fewer suicide attempts**, and adequate housing compared to those without strong parental support . These findings draw a direct relationship between strong parental support and the reduction of significant risk factors for trans youth .

http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19361653.2014.910483

&gt;Multiple regression analysis indicated that the exogenous variables of family rejection, social isolation, and loneliness were significant predictors of both transgender and cisgender adolescents’ reported levels of depression, suicidal thinking, and sexual risk behaviors

http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2

&gt;Social support, reduced transphobia, and having any personal identification documents changed to an appropriate sex designation were associated with large relative and absolute reductions in suicide risk, as was completing a medical transition through hormones and/or surgeries (when needed). **Parental support for gender identity was associated with reduced ideation** (suicide).


If you actually care about your child, you would support them in this, **even if you disagree with trans everything.** Actual care and consideration is being able to overcome your own views for best result for your child, even if they are ""betraying generations of women who had fought for women's and lesbian rights"", ""full of contradictions"", and ""living a lie."" Who cares? What good is all of that if your child is dead from suicide? And to make it clear, I dearly hope that nothing of that sort happens.

&gt;the overall mortality rate was only significantly increased for the group operated before 1989. However, the latter might also be explained by improved health care for transsexual persons during 1990s, along with altered societal attitudes towards persons with different gender expressions

Also, there are multiple reasons for a higher suicide rate, it is not caused purely by the dysphoria, but also from lack of acceptance from society. 

Furthermore, there are other studies that conclude what I was saying.

http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/handle/1871/23255/189321.pdf

quite well psychologically, socially and sexually

reassignment  increases  the  well-being  of  transsexuals,
but   it   should   not   be   considered   as   a   cure-all;   it   is
rehabilitative   relieving   gender   dysphoria,   but   some
transsexual subjects may still experience other problems
(e.g.   comorbid   psychiatric   problems,   social   isolation,
troubled relationships, prejudice, and discrimination)


http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-009-9551-1

&gt;In conclusion, almost all patients were satisfied with the sex reassignment; 86% were assessed by clinicians at follow-up as stable or improved in global functioning.

http://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095%2815%2930533-6/abstract

&gt;Significant decreases were found in the subscales such as anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, and hostility. Furthermore, the SCL-90 scores resembled those of a general population after hormone therapy was initiated.

&gt;A marked reduction in psychopathology occurs during the process of sex reassignment therapy, especially after the initiation of hormone therapy

Also realize that in general, the quality of the studies on the topic are on the low side, its not like you can do a double blind test and set up a control group or anything, there are ethical issues involved with that.

&gt;""Pooling across studies shows that after sex reassignment, 80% of individuals with GID reported significant improvement in gender dysphoria (95% CI = 68–89%; 8 studies; I2 = 82%); 78% reported significant improvement in psychological symptoms (95% CI = 56–94%; 7 studies; I2 = 86%); 80% reported significant improvement in quality of life (95% CI = 72–88%; 16 studies; I2 = 78%); and 72% reported significant improvement in sexual function (95% CI = 60–81%; 15 studies; I2 = 78%).""

I actually think thats cuz most of the userbase was kind of bad, and worse players tended to the larger mechs while better players played lighter mechs, and it takes a bit more skill to use larger mechs - doesn't necessarily that the smaller mechs are overpowered. I actually very much enjoyed playing larger mechs because i got to shut down scouts that were used to players not being able to track or predict their movements. that being said i think its more of a matter of lighter mechs being much more easier to play, not overpowered

1318,"&gt;And you are dramatically simplifying everything then proceeding to have a go at me for making it sound dramatic. What can I say other than ""surgical illusion"" and ""artificial""

Why do you need convoluted descriptors to describe it? It's a way to pad an argument to make it sound more compelling, but you shouldn't need it if your argument is compelling by itself.  The *only* reason to constantly refer to it as ""artificial"" is to make an appeal to nature. The fact that the vagina is artificial is self-evident. This is a common thing in arguments about the medical field. Many people will refer to alternative medicine as ""natural and organic"", while referring to real medicine as ""artificial"". If the reasoning behind your argument is sound, you shouldn't need those descriptors.

&gt; Making an appeal to nature? I'm making an appeal to what is normal and legitimate. A cis vagina is actually a vagina, a trans vagina is a male system modified to look and partly function as though it is a female one.

Right, and there's literally nothing wrong with that, right?
For example, if you could make a perfectly identical in functionality women's vagina from a males genitals, would it matter that its fake? it wouldn't be ""normal"", nor ""legitimate"", but why would that be a problem? 

Its literally what an appeal to nature is.

Like hmmm i get it, you don't want to call it a trans ""vagina"" cuz in your mind that gives it too much legitimacy right?
but that's quite unfair, lots of medical literature refers to it as such. At the very least, will you accept the term ""neovagina"", which is also a term used often?

&gt; there is definitely something inherently wrong with cutting off a mentally ill person's healthy sex organs to make them feel better about themself. 

Like this is a completely separate line of argument then what I'm addressing and id like to get to the meat of what you are saying, but we need to trim the fat from your arguments first. You cant have a straightforward argument if you make exaggerations and use loaded language and appeals to emotion. That's why you usually cant even attempt to have arguments with people who describe a complex surgical procedure as ""chopping your dicks off"" - they are only interested in exaggerating the facts to ridicule it instead of actually considering the facts of the situation.

UTI's as far as i know usually such but resolve in a week.. is that really a big deal?

Heres my issue here - you are clearly working from a default biased position of ""TRANS VAGINAS ARE BAD"" and then trying to justify that, to a point that you are being unreasonably critical and I don't even think you are really thinking your own points through. Seriously - UTI's?

all in all for nothing - I ALREADY STATED THAT I KNOW THAT SRS IS FLAWED. you aren't really achieving anything by pointing out every single flaw. 

Remember my original purpose was to contend with the statement 

""to replace them with non-functioning, artificially maintained, placeholders to aesthetically replicate the opposite sex.""

Im not asserting the surgeries are perfect

Now you've got 
&gt;""It is impossible for falsely replicated trans genitals to have the same level of functionality as natural/organic genitals."" 

&gt;""They are not completely useless, but they do not and presumably never will have the same level of functionality as true, natural genitals. "" 


Better.. but..

Let me elaborate on what I meant earlier about loaded language. You are trying to find the words with the most negative possible connotation and sprinkle them in any way you can, to a point of ridiculousness - 

&gt;Ok sure buy lube for it then, artificially lubricate yourself. 

Why the word ""artificially""? This is something plenty of normal girls do for sex too.  

&gt; ..falsely replicated trans genitals...

What do you mean by ""falsely replicated?

By sprinkling stuff like ""surgical illusion"" around every reference to a trans vagina, and sprinkling the words ""natural"", ""organic"" when referring to a cis vagina, you are clearly trying to make an [appeal to nature](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-nature). Otherwise, why have those words in there? There is nothing inherently wrong with having a ""fake"" vagina. 

It doesn't even make sense, especially in a discussion about medically solving a problem. The medical field is all about artificial solutions to natural problems!

lmao, you do understand how an argument works right? You made a claim about vaginas. Hence, I am arguing bout the vaginas.
If you wanted to support your claim with evidence about penises then you should have made your claim about penises :)
Either support your claim about vaginas or cede it and launch into a separate point about penises.

&gt;You also ignored my point about vasectomies, again underplaying the importance of full genital function. 
&gt;You still ignored my point about it never looking true to the real thing because of bone structure and cervix. Ignored point about natural sexual properties like self lubrication on arousal, etc. Expansion/constriction, obviously impossible because it is not actually a vagina. You instead just evaded that by going on about how much it doesn't really matter that it can't be used for reproduction

Once again, I was never saying trans vaginas are AS functional as a regular vagina.

Merely, that most are, at a minimum level, functional.

Note that none of those downsides prevent a trans woman from having sex and achieving sexual climax, which is the function I am referring to. Most can pee just fine too!

&gt;Perhaps I should reword it to

&gt;""It is impossible for falsely replicated trans genitals to have the same level of functionality as natural/organic genitals.""

&gt;Something like that. 

That's not rewording, that's completely changing your position. 

You do understand that the statements ""trans genitals do not have the same level of functionality as cis genitals"" and ""trans genitals are non-functional"" are not equivalent right?

Having sex is an important, major ***function*** of genitals. Most trans vaginas can perform that ***function***. Hence, to describe them as ***non functional*** placeholders that are merely there for aesthetic reasons is a completely untenable position. You can describe them as LESS functional, but not NON functional.

Why do you refuse to cede that point?

You are starting to do serious damage to your credibility because it's really just a common sense argument at this point. 

""this vagina is dry! Literally UNUSABLE""

lol wat no, lube that shit up! Go have sexy fun times!

""Shit I'm sterile. Sorry, I can't have sex honey, my penis is nonfunctional""

Wat! no dude, go fuck that lady!

Remember when I said, WAY WAY back when that you are using ""tons of loaded language that appeals to emotion.""?

All this ties back to your original paragraph. Why you are insistent on trying to paint them as completely useless when this is clearly not the case?

&gt;Have a read of the potential issues associated with these two key functions you describe. Particularly issues with urethra extension. 


First of all, your statement was ""Functional vagina? I don't think so"", not ""functional penis. I don't think so""

There is a reason why I specified vaginas, they are way more successful than the penises

Second of all, *potential issues*, right?

that means when the surgery goes right, those problems don't exist


I feel like there was a miscommunication somewhere here. 

You seem to be making blanket statements that trans genitals are non-functional, I am disputing your blanket statements. I am not saying every trans vagina is functional, because there are some that are not. Most are though.

As far as I'm concerned, I'd put the minimum criteria for functional genitals as

1)You can use them to have normal sex, and receive sexual pleasure from them

2)you can pee through them

Functional and perfectly functional are two different things, and genitals have multiple functions. I would argue that most people would consider an important function of genitals is to have sex and receive sexual pleasure. Making babies is also an important function. Yet..

If a guy is infertile, but his penis works fine for sex, would you describe his penis as non-functional?

If a girl is infertile, but her vagina is perfectly identical to a normal girls vagina, would you describe her vagina as non-functional?

Plenty of guys even want to give up their fertility and opt for vasectomies - its hardly a **necessary** aspect of genitals.

I'm not disputing the fact that making babies is also an important function - it is. As such, it would be valid to say trans vaginas are **less** functional. You could also say that trans vaginas are completely nonfunctional when it comes to making babies only, which would be true, but probably an abuse of the english language. 

However, you said they are non-functional, which is false because they CAN and DO serve the functions that genitals are most commonly used for.

* toronto man in women's shelter going by the name jessica
* virginia man named richard rodriguez in womens restroom
* Los Angeles Man dressed in drag - named Jason Pomare
* two male students - University of toronto

That's not why America's mothers and fathers are up in arms.

Okay, VERY interesting start. - This is an interesting claim on a conservative website - Just for fun, lets see the other articles on this site

https://pjmedia.com/tags/gender-issues/

Yep, as I suspected, all overwhelmingly anti-trans. Maybe this article is different? but the title implies otherwise...

 &gt;The push to now say that all men, regardless of their lifestyle, can just use the ladies' room if they feel like it, and any woman or man who objects is a hate-filled bigot, is a DAMNED MENTAL ILLNESS. It is an illness I will not be subscribing to. Department stores declaring that men can go into any dressing room or bathroom they want to is a damned disaster of Titanic proportions and when the raping, robbing, and murdering commence...

&gt;...NO ONE is scared of transgendered people....

&gt;..Further, these stupid new rules are endangering....

Interesting wording. Where are the department stores declaring that **men** can go into any bathroom room they want?

As far as I know, the wording of the trans policy for target was

#""we welcome *transgender* team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity.” 
There is no mention of allowing men into whatever bathroom they want.

This statement is literally identical to the one she made in the beginning (that she said she is okay with). Note that this is also not a ""new rule"" but a reiteration of where target stands. Target has always had this policy and it is nothing new - like she said was no problem in the beginning of this post.

http://www.snopes.com/target-transgender-bathroom-policy/

&gt; she would not shop at Target anymore because of their latest PR disaster of a bathroom/dressing room policy that endangers women and children while seeking to gratify .01% (or less) of the population

&gt;The other thing that comes with that is trans and non-trans people who will abuse the system to their own unsavory behaviour.

How is the system abusable? If you dont explain your reasoning for why then I can't argue against it. How would a trans person be abusing those laws? How would a non-trans person be abusing those laws?

&gt;It's not entirely unreasonable for a parent to be concerned about their 10 year old daughter being in a public bathroom in a stall next to a 40 year old man transitioned/tranisitioning to female. 

It actually is completely unreasonable. Trans women have been already going to the women's bathroom for decades with pretty much 0 incidents. How is this concern in any way rationalized? A 10 year old child is way, way, way more likely to be victimized by someone the child knows than a trans person in a bathroom.

As far as I understand (which could be wrong), the genetic material for both genders is present in male people. (hence why its X+Y instead of YY). It's actually the hormones that control the development of ""female biology""

1367,"&gt;I'm saying it is obvious that a person will feel better if you allow them to conform to their delusion, and that doing this is not the right final solution. 

Obviously i disagree with this, but actually want to address your second paragraph

If you dissect it you will see you are making many unfounded claims with tons of loaded language that appeals to emotion. 

Sentence by sentence.
&gt;""I'm saying it's a lot of work which needs a lot of bodily mutilation to result in the mental health benefits.""

This is just your last sentence phrased in a more emotionally manipulative way. Yes its a lot of work, there are many surgeries that involve alot of work. There are plenty of procedures that can be described as ""bodily mutilation."" 

&gt;My objection is to the amputation of healthy, functioning body parts...

Is the fact that the penis was ""functional"" relevant? So if the trans person had a damaged, non functional penis to begin with, would it be okay for them to have srs surgery then? 

&gt;to replace them with non-functioning,

Modern MTF SRS surgery results in a functional vagina that can be used for sex no problem. Unless you are using a different definition of functional then what I'm using.

&gt;artificially maintained 

Tons of medical procedures require maintenance after the fact, nothing new

&gt;placeholders to aesthetically replicate the opposite sex. 

Once again, functional vagina. Also there's nothing inherently wrong with surgeries for aesthetic purposes.

&gt;No matter of surgery will truly transform you into the opposite sex, only surgical illusion

So? If it's good enough, whats the problem?
""Surgical Illusion"" is just more emotionally manipulative rhetoric. Medical procedures are often approximations instead of real body parts, this is nothing new. We can't actually just grow body parts just yet AFAIK.
And who says the surgery can't truly transform you sometimes in the future? The only thing I would imagine to be completely 100% impossible is the chromosomes thing. And there are plenty of women without perfect chromosomes so..


Lets rephrase that part of the paragraph in terms of actual facts, instead of emotionally manipulative rhetoric.

*""It is a complex, extensive procedure with proven health benefits, but irreversible. It involves removing a penis and replacing it with a mostly functional approximation of a vagina. It is not a perfect and flawless recreation of a women's vagina and the procedure will probably never be able to achieve that, but it is a reasonable replacement both in terms of aesthetic and functionality.""*

&gt; If only there was the time and money

You acknowledge that there are limited resources for research, good.

&gt;create treatments through medication, psychotherapy, any other methods of the mind, to treat dysphoria and allow a person to live a life without feeling so misaligned.

This is interesting. The brain and mind is the most complex, and probably least understood organ in the body. 

you agreed that ""Psychotherapy alone doesn't work and it never will.""

So the only other options (that I am aware of) is using medication, or brain surgery.

You spend all this time pointing out negatives and flaws of sex reassignment surgery. Do you honestly believe that the options you propose, if doable, wont have flaws and negatives? Medication is almost GUARANTEED to have side effects. Brain surgery - how do we even know that its even possible to surgically alter the gender of the brain?

&gt;Money should be going into this research and development, not improving how closely surgeons can falsely replicate sex organs. 

This is an incredible conclusion to come to. We have a flawed, but mostly effective procedure.
You propose that an entirely perfect mind based procedure **could** exist, so we should halt all of our *limited* funding for the effective procedure and put it towards the hypothetical one, one that could be *potentially* harmful (I'm acknowledging your point that evidence on psychotherapy being harmful could have been tainted by poor research methods). How is this logical?

1368,"I understand your criticisms of the potential pitfalls of studies in general. Studies aren't perfect. thats why we prefer a consensus of studies to just one. For the study you posted, one possible issue is actually the fact that srs is a rapidly improving procedure. Since it deals with a longer, older dataset (Sweden, 1973-2003), it may not be AS indicative of current care for trans people.

&gt; I'm just trying to highlight that the outcome of the data can change significantly depending on the sample population. Hence, trying to reinforce my argument that large-scale, comprehensive and in-depth studies should be done on broad sample populations before we can draw a truly definitive conclusion.

That would be ideal, sadly its not always that simple for various reasons: funding, time, accessibility to subjects, etc. We usually have to deal with [a lot of little articles](http://www.cakeworld.info/transsexualism/what-helps/srs) instead of one big super study. 

But this train of thought really doesn't seem like a counter argument to anything. Sure there may be nothing ""truly definitive"" (if there exists such a thing), but we have a decent amount of research to work with. You agree that theres ""the obvious mental health benefits of having the surgery for most people"".. so I'm having trouble understanding the ""anti-trans"" position you are supposed to be taking (trying to avoid strawmanning you again, lmao)


As an aside argument, let me address this part that you posted:

&gt;""Of course it does, letting someone look like what they think they are will help, doesn't really say much about the nasty procedures that have to be done like artificially inflating the new wound between their legs to stop their body from sealing it. Not to mention being permanently sterile. ""

I mean, there are countless medical procedures that have pitfalls and side effects and negatives. Usually the benefit of the procedure outweighs the negatives, so the surgery is still acceptable. I'm not seeing your objection here.

that study does not lead to the conclusion you are drawing from it

IN THAT VERY STUDY

"" It does not, however, address whether sex reassignment is an effective treatment or not.""

"" Our findings suggest that sex reassignment, although alleviating gender dysphoria, may not suffice as treatment for transsexualism, and should inspire improved psychiatric and somatic care after sex reassignment for this patient group.""

Note the word suffice. That does not mean we get rid of the treatment, only improve it!

""For the purpose of evaluating whether sex reassignment is an effective treatment for gender dysphoria, it is reasonable to compare reported gender dysphoria pre and post treatment. **Such studies have been conducted either prospectively or retrospectively, and suggest that sex reassignment of transsexual persons improves quality of life and gender dysphoria""**

&gt;I think my post had an argument in it (even though it was also a mockery of the previous poster). To me that gender argument based on a rare chromosomal anomaly is like saying ""you can't humans have 2 arms because a fraction of them are born with 1, 3 or 4"". Sure in a way it's true, it's a possibility. But it won't redefine the number of limbs on a human (or the way we think about it).

You may have thought that argument in your head, you didn't put any of it into words tho. 


If there was a statistically significant amount (protip: 0.2% is a huge amount) of people that were being born with 1,3, or 4 arms, then yes, it would be wrong to say 
That ALL humans are born with 2 arms. In the same way, your claim that chromosomes are the ONLY signifier of gender is also wrong. There are exceptions. You are trying to generalize ""most""	to ""all"", which does not logically follow.

They admire him. They might even vote for him.

1437,"&gt; Sorry for the late answer, I've been quite busy for the past few days.

Its all gud!

&gt;Ok, first of all our fundamental difference in opinion is probably that I think it's political and you think it isn't. Let me say that if I wouldn't see it as political, then I would consider the outrage to be stupid. On the other hand, I tend to believe that if you would see it as political, you would have at least some understanding for the dislike (even if you might not agree). Am I correct?

Somewhat correct. The fundamental argument I'm making here is that nothing about this particular character and paragraph of dialogue is inherently political, but that's not our only fundamental difference in opinion, nor is it the only argument I could make. If you would make me see it as political, I would still see nothing wrong with it because I believe theres nothing inherently wrong with putting in something for a political reason (like i said above). That argument is pretty irrelevant if we don't even agree if it's political or not however.

&gt;The point is that inconsistencies are bad, but in a complex story hard to avoid so mostly forgiven as long as they are not very obvious. 

Yep, completely agree

&gt;If I need to think more than a second about whether something is inconsistent, it's probably not that bad. If I know immediately it's inconsistent and can't fathom how the writer didn't notice it, it's pretty bad. Some of this is certainly subjective.

&gt;Which might be a reason why most people here think it's political and due to subjectivity of the severity of inconsistencies you don't think that way. Maybe.

Sure, the ""severity"" of the ""inconsistency"" could be subjective.

However, I'm saying that its not inconsistent ***at all***. I have two points there: one was disputing the fact that it is an inconsistency, and the other was saying that even if it was an inconsistency, it would be a minor one.

How can you make an argument that it's a severe inconsistency when you haven't even shown that it is an inconsistency in the first place?

Whether something is an inconsistency is pretty on the objective side btw. Does the dialogue contradict with the rules of the world or not? Where and how?

&gt;But there's another reason why it's considered political. That character, as written would actually fit far better in the real world. Which let's one think that the character is there to make a statement about ""the real world"" (skipping some arguments, text is long enough as it is). Which, in conclusion would make it a political statement.

As far as I can see this is just the same argument restated? For it to ""fit far better in the real world"" You are saying that ""it doesn't fit well in the game"", which is something that's still in dispute. Not only do I disagree with your premise, I also disagree with the logic you used to reach your conclusion although theres really no point in going into why, because don't we have enough threads of points and counterpoints going on already? You have to show that it doesn't fit will in the game to make this argument, which ties into above with my point about it not being an inconsistency. 

I mean like I said in my last post.. you are going into all these abstract concepts which is fun to argue against but it doesn't do anything if you can't apply it to the direct issue at hand.. Heck, I can source the offending dialogue right here if you want to reference it

    ""When I was born, my parents thought me a boy and raised me as such. In
    time, we all came to understand I was truly a woman. I created my new
    name from syllables of different languages. All have special meaning to
    me; it is the truest reflection of who I am.""


&gt;(Note: we are only talking about that character, but the game obviously had dozens of other problems, many of them having nothing to do with any ""SJW"" kind of writing)

Transgender means you identify as a different gender then what you are born as. Key word **born**. Do you know what the word **born** means?

&gt;A trans person is obviously not biologically their preferred gender or else they wouldn't be trans.

extremely simple concept, again. If a person is born male and raised as male, and transitions so that they become perfectly biologically female (by the use of advanced medical science, magical potion, or fucking aliens it doesn't matter), they would still be considered transgender. The only way you could change a person from male to female and not consider it transgender by definition is if you went back in time and changed their gender in the womb, 
so that they were always considered one gender. Again, its a really extremely simple concept, its just the basic definition of the word. One gender to another? Transgender. Am I using simple enough words here? Let me know.

Whats extra hilarious is that arguing over your obviously incorrect understanding of what the word ""Trans"" isn't even necessary, because the character never even calls themselves trans. I will post the offending dialogue here for reference in all its glory

1461,"gonna quote you in a somewhat random order

&gt;Your linked article misses the point completely, because there is a difference between consistency (relevant for immersion) and realism 

Video games have inconsistencies all the time, and the ramifications of unrealistic elements and how they would affect the world are often ignored. I figured you would bring this exact point up, which is why the paragraph before is pointing out a potential example of that very thing.

&gt;...I also I'm not quite sure why you are explaining what trans is. While correct, I don't see it having any relevance to what I wrote

...

&gt;Being trans is not inconsistent with the world. Not using the solutions available in the world is, however, inconsistent, immersion breaking...

This is exactly why I wrote it. Note that I said in my last post ""a trans character would actually go for a magical sex change, you are completely correct."" Why are you saying she didn't use ""the solution available?"" She probably DID use the solution available. There's no inconsistency there.

&gt;Yes, there are a ton of stereotypes in all forms of media, but they are not solely introduced to make an obvious political statement.

This is an example of you interpreting ""every 2 is a 3"".

What is it that makes it an obvious political statement? In circles we go. 

&gt;There is a reason why there is a disdain for characters that noticeably serve as a mouth piece for an authors opinion. In writing ""don't make mouth pieces for your opinion"" is writing 101.

Haha this is so completely wrong. The ""reason"" there is a disdain for characters that noticeably serve as a mouth piece for an authors opinion is because that character is noticeably poorly written. Writing, and indeed some forms of art, are often ""mouthpieces of author opinion"" and there's nothing wrong with that. That's not even the point I'm trying to make though, lmao

&gt;Btw, I first thought of James Vega, but while he doesn't shove any political message down anyones throat, he's not actually a well written character. Not a good example for ""how to do things"". Vega is pretty flat and boring. I still have no issues with him (in other threads you can actually see him being mentioned as ""well done"", but I wouldn't go further than ""passable"". If you look in other threads there are many other examples, mostly in games I haven't played....

Right ... so you agree that whether its a well written character has no bearing on whether or not its a political message right? Now if only you could define what ""shoving a political message down anyone's throat"" is, and how mizhena is an example of that..

&gt;...But not only have many people in KiA explained many ways to improve this character while still having a trans character included, but they also mentioned many characters with differing sexualities that were at least decently done. Claiming that we are never satisfied is just counterfactual.

Correct in a way. There were a lot of people saying it would be better if it was more subtle. I should have really said ""everything you guys think is a 3 is actually a 2"". You guys are fine with 2s as long as they are exactly the way you feel they should be. (aka the last paragraph of my last post)


The best thing would be if you could focus on why this particular character and paragraph of dialogue is an issue, instead of trying to explain your abstract ideal of what a trans character should be.

&gt;Opposite example: Mass effect 3. It was clear that the whole krogan arc was the feminism arc. Including Shepard having a moment of utmost stupidity when she assumes Wrex had the idea with the worm, and not that female Krogan whose name I couldn't be bothered to remember.

I dont need examples to understand the concept. It's a very simple concept to understand. I *am* mildly tickled that you used a character thats not even in gaming as an example of a positive trans character tho.

&gt;It's obviously a political statement because they opted for drawing parallels to real world transitioning instead of just using a magical sex change (which a trans character in that world would actually go for), because they obviously took most of their writing effort to make the character ""trans"" rather than you know ""human"" - so, an actual character.

This is the first part of the post where you actually try to address the argument, and why you think its a political statement, So I'll start here.

a trans character would actually go for a magical sex change, you are completely correct. And then still be trans. You don't stop being trans because you transitioned, lmao. Being trans means you identify as something other whan what you were *born* with. 

In fact, an easily obtainable sex change would almost undeniably wreak havoc on how society handles gender, that we can only speculate about. Are you mad about the fact that they haven't explored THOSE ramifications? Did the lack of that exploration break your immersion? ITS A VIDEO GAME. Tons of implications of things are often ignored. 

http://www.pointandclickbait.com/2016/02/transgender-character-breaks-immersion-game/

&gt;Why is it so fucking hard for SJWs to write an actually good gay/trans/female/indian/whatever character? Instead opting for stereotyped cardboard cutouts, apparently thinking ""oh, I made the character a minority, guess I'm done with writing.""?

&gt;I want actual diversity, not characters on one side and stereotypes for political purposes on the other. Is that so hard to understand?

Actual diversity IS shittily written trans characters as well as well written ones! 

""characters on one side and stereotypes for political purposes"" my ass lmao! There are tons of shitty of characters and stereotypes in gaming no one makes a big deal about.

1477,"

&gt;And the way one makes something as inane into a political statement is you go out of your way to make it all about that statement. The issue isn't that this is a character that is trans. The issue is that is the centerpiece of the character. That's what this character is all about. 

*Nonsense*, something doesn't become political just because it's shallow. To illustrate this concept, replace the ""centerpiece"" of the character with literally anything else non-political. ""Oh, this character is all about painting"". ""Oh, this character was born deaf."" ""Oh, this character is all about being a gamer."" **The only way your argument makes sense is if you consider making a character trans a political statement in itself.** 

let me remind you of your original post:

&gt;It still just baffles me that they would consider my sex, race, and orientation to be political statements. 

continuing on

&gt;This character is put into the story for the purpose of shoehorning the writer's distorted sense of diversity into the game.

This directly contradicts with your earlier statement that its not about the fact that the character is trans. Shoehorning means ""force into an inadequate space"". Distorted sense of diversity means you believe the writer had an unrealistic idea of how many trans people would be in the game. Since the writer only added **ONE** trans character, you are saying that there should be no trans characters. 

&gt;We are talking about a world where a simple spell can cause a person to completely switch sexes and magic is incredibly abundant in the Forgotten Realms. 

Not sure how this is relevant. All it means that a sex change operation is instant instead of a long drawn out permanent process. This would probably make trans people MORE common, not less.

&gt; To make it clear, Characters that are trans, gay, etc. do not bother me in the slightest

Alot of people think this, but if literally [""ONE PARAGRAPH""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__6nFM5GER8) of an NPC describing how she chose her name based on her becoming trans bothers you then you are only lying to yourself.

&gt; What bothers me is when, for no good reason other than for a ""diversity"" crusade, these attributes are shoved to the top. 

Refer to my first paragraph above. 

&gt;It just reeks of tokenism.

Whats hilarious is that tokenism is ""a perfunctory gesture towards the inclusion of members of minority group"". Complaining about tokenism is actually making a statement about the lack of minorities and how there needs to be more of them.

I was referring pretty straightforwardly towards ""unabashed racists"", in regards to the value of banning them. I'm not conflating anybody. Remember I'm making a point about about the principle of letting EVERYONE speak.

&gt;censorship is the bane of modern society. 

In 90%	of ""censorship"" issues that Reddit complains about, it is actually not an issue at all. At least in the us, censorship is not a major issue. 


&gt;no one in their right mind is against showing basic human respect to women and minorities. 

If you criticize someone for not showing basic human respect to women or minorities, prepare to hear ""triggered""	and ""go back to your safe space"".  In practice, this is not true. 


&gt;what people are annoyed about is PC culture's darker side and how it can be used as a political tool to simply silence people you disagree with.

This is what people who complain about ""pc culture"" say. In practice, there is usually no silencing involved, only criticism. 

&gt;As a left-wing person who was raised thoroughly in and around tolerant, liberal culture, there's value in hearing people out. even if they're a ""bigot"", 

Common oversimplification. There is not always value in hearing people out.	How many times do you have to debunk and listen to someone who insists that 1+1=3? Where is the value in letting an unabashed racist continually rant about blacks being inferior? 

This also ignores the fact that there can be value in banning a racist from a forum. You aren't subjecting the minorities in the discussion to the same tired racist nonsense (How's that for basic human decency?). You don't let your site become a recruiting ground for stormfront. You prevent your userbase from gaining even more racists. Sure, its easy to ""decry""	one racist in your userbase. If you have slot with each backing and inviting each other, its harder. 

""Free speech""	has never extended everywhere and to anything, and it never should. If people really want unfettered free speech, there's always 4chan. Tons of ""value""	at /pol/, I'm sure

&gt;I've been ""victim"" of one of the SRD/SRS brigades, and while it is a minor inconvenience, I can see why some people would find it hard to get away from those types of users.

&gt;Are you using targeted harassment to illustrate that targeted harassment is bad?

To be clear, i don't approve of SRD brigades, and I don't think SRS brigades in any amount that has any effect on anything.

Really, its telling that out of all the many, many subs that brigade (including kia), srs and srd are the ONLY ones complained about. In fact, the trump sub recently brigaded one of our comments to under -1000. Not an exaggeration.

And no, people are fighting against racism and bigotry, not targeted harassment, which is something that has negative consequences that go much further than a minor inconvenience.

&gt; Not in your or my lifetime, no, fighting it will only make it worse. Have you noticed how PC intellectual-fascism has turned off quite a few of the top comedians? Have you noticed how Twitter, with it's invasive censorship policies and 1984 bias council is floundering in spite of it? (I'd argue in large part because of it)

lmao cmon now, I'm trying not to respond with sarcasm but you make it so hard, seriously, you filled that with so many buzzwords I'm surprised it doesn't have +100 upvotes already. The idea that twitter is floundering because ""censorship"" is a stretch, at best. Yes, there are some comedians that disagree with it. There are alot of people that disagree with it. Thats nothing new. Thats never stopped social change before.

&gt;I very don't think it's a valid endeavor to pursue as it'll inevitably kill of quite a large sub-set of comedy, political satire, literature, and art if you're no longer allowed to be ""edgy"".

I mean, I just literally said last post we aren't for making this stuff illegal. It's still telling that you think that pursuing less racism will result in the collapse of the arts.

Do you think it CANT change?

For example, in gaming communities it used to be super common to say you ""raped"" someone, now its much less accepted. Sure, a minor change, but to imply things can't change at least slightly for the better is wrong. 

Of course, thats ignoring the fact that people don't always complain to effect change, sometimes people complain just to vent. anti-sjws do the exact thing btw

Pretty sure independence day has as much cultural weight, if not more. At the very least it was more widely seen, and had over twice the box office. I find this nitpicking.

&gt;Honestly I probably agree that the reaction was an overreaction, but then so is everything on the internet. 

Not everything on the internet is an overreaction, and thats a definite oversimplification. In fact if you actually examine and think about it, you can find certain categories of stuff that is much more likely to garner an overreaction. One of those categories is anything that could be loosely tied with feminism.

&gt;it isn't an unfounded suspicion to think that the film would rely heavily on stereotypes and tropes rather than being a well written comedy that just so happens to feature a female cast

If you know nothing about the movie other than that it has a female cast, it IS an unfounded suspicion. Which is the point.

&gt;The only films I see quoted are Spiderman

Referring to the list of links in the beginning of the post 

&gt;I don't think an all guy film is the default, mostly guy yes but an all guy would be something like Expendables. Which is also pandering and condescending, it is made to be that way and people treat is as being very low-brow because of it. 

Yes but you would never see the same reaction to a pandering all guy film, which is the point

&gt;Watch Jessica Jones for an example of it being done well, you probably wouldn't even notice at first that almost all of the main characters are women, because they don't advertise it that way or play up gender roles and stereotypes, they just made a show with good female characters.

The point was that even before any advertising or ""played up gender roles""	there was outrage about the all female cast of ghostbusters. To be clear, I agree with many comments about the trailer, it looks poorly written and probably will no way compare with something like Jessica jones. We are really talking about the overreaction to the film, not whether it's good or not


&gt;As for the last point, I agree, that's why I find the above commenters use of it kind of worrying.

1608,"&gt; Honest truth - SJiA was created as a containment sub to keep the super serious anti-SJW posts off TiA/KiA. The community have this misguided idea that Reddit's voting system will do the moderation for them so we decided to let them have a go. Given the response in SRC and such to us deciding to just step in and ban the idiots I think you'll understand.

...So you agree that the idea of self-policing is ""misguided"", you just don't want to deal with the fallout of making the rule change? Okay, I can see that, but I would still stay its better off for the community if you push the rule changes through anyways. But really, the point is, when SJiA was made from the beginning, it should have already had rules against ""comments which promote malignant bigotry"". If you dont want it in your community, ban it straight from the getgo.

&gt;That's not really what happened. As much as SRD likes to downvote me for refusing to blindly circlejerk about how awful any sub not aligned with the feminist POV is, SJiA did not get taken over by these individuals. The community downvote it, make it clear that they don't want it there, yet the people posting it had absolutely no appreciation of that to the point that it was essentially just spam.

You just finished saying that the problem was escalating. Like it or not, if you allow people to continually post racist shit, even if they are being downvoted, they become part of your community. The more of them that are there, the more they will influence vote totals. Sure, outright racist stuff will be still heavily downvoted, but then you'll find that more subtle racist stuff will be more likely to be upvoted.

&gt;I've always found arguments about ""enabling"" to be very flimsy. I'll ban people for their behaviour, not their political views

My point about enabling is for behavior - Posting outright racist comments is behavior. if you allow outright racist comments on your sub, then that is enabling behavior. Never said anything about searching through peoples post histories

&gt;Well we agree on that. That's why we took the decision to ban that shit on SJiA, we tried letting the community police it but the problem was escalating.

&gt;Nonetheless trying to put forward that trying to let the community police itself is enabling/supporting those positions is unreasonable.

Why let the community police itself? Why is that taken for granted to be better? Think about it. For example, no one ever thinks that communities should self moderate spam, or completely off topic content. 

A ""community""	 isn't static. 

If you change your stance from ""this is not okay""	to	""you decide if it's not okay""	then you are enabling the community to shift toward racist / sexist types, because they have a place where they won't get banned.

1660,"&gt;He's talking about Black History Month, not racism at large. He is not saying that the way for racism to end is to pretend it doesn't exist, he's saying the way is to stop trying to draw attention to differences between people.

&gt;Everybody understands the context to his comments,

You say this but there is a large percentage of comments in this thread saying ""But we shouldn't stop talking about racism!"" (which is a good thing). The fact that they are saying that means that they thought Morgan was saying stop talking about racism. The fact of the matter is that the question was ""How are we going to get rid of racism"" and he answered ""Stop talking about it"" and many people are going to take it at face value, like it or not.

My original reply was simply pointing out that you were misrepresenting the blackladies post, among with many other posts that are strawmanning them...

&gt;You're deliberately being disingenuous so that the next time you see it posted you can copy-paste a link, then plug your ears and yell ""Debunked! Debunked! Debunked!"".

&gt;IMO the biggest problem is the label ""privilege"". It makes it seem as though white people start at 100 when in actuality its that white people start at 0 while minorities start in the negative. It's not a privilege to not be fucked over by the society you live in, but ""white privilege"" is easier than ""perpetual minority disadvantage"". 

&gt;By using the term privilege, you automatically attract conflict because it implies that white people dont have to work as hard to achieve. 

Privilege just literally means advantage. If one side had a disadvantage, then that means the other side is advantaged. A bias in favor of white people is exactly the same as a bias against minorities. Assigning arbitrary numbers to it means nothing. 

And yes, by definition, if you accept that minorities are disadvantaged then you also have to accept that you may not have had to work as hard to achieve success.

You can't claim that there are inequalities between the races and then say that both races have equal chances of success unless you believe those inequalities really aren't anything. 

There's no reason for you to be bothered by the term. If you worked hard for your success, no one is taking that away from you on the individual level.

1699,"&gt; something we agree on so we can maybe leave this on a good note.

We can still finish in disagreement and id say it is ending on a good note, as long as the discussion was respectful, which id say it was. :)

&gt;I suppose what I'd like is just to strive for clarity of language (kind of the same reason I wrote trying to distinguish censorship vs self-censorship and why the two have to be considered differently). If you think someone is being a bigot, say so, and explain why. I don't think, ""politically correct"" is a particularly good, accurate, or descriptive word to add on

I really don't see what you are saying here. Like I said in my last post (and you seem to have agreed with me? correct me if wrong, not trying to ""gotchya"") the typical and most common chain of events is:

""Someone will make a bigoted comment, someone criticizes them for it, and then they complain about how the ""PC police"" are taking over.""

Your post seems like a criticism of GG, not aGG. People don't usually go around criticizing things for not being ""politically correct"" enough, they usually **ARE** calling out the comment for its bigotry. Who is bringing the term politically correct into the discussion? The term is almost invariably used to deride ""sjws"", because the term itself has a negative connotation.

You say they have to explain why they think the comment is bigoted? ..but, often the reason is self evident - its often not hard to see why a comment could be construed as racist, sexist, etc and usually the racism/sexism is intentional. Even with explaining, the response is still something along the lines of ""stop being so offended, something something pc culture.""

And once again, I do think that ""PC"" goes too far sometimes but I just don't think the positions are equivalent.",2016-01-21 23:15:30+00:00,cz740lw,,t1_cz56p8v,118813.0,KotakuInAction

1701,"&gt;Hay, got completely sidetracked and had meant to respond after you took the time so sorry.

Sure, no prob. I'm glad you finally responded.

&gt;I guess I'll just shortly say that I think there is a difference between a refusal to engage, engagement, and an attack. An attack being different from addressing someone's beliefs/points intellectually or academically, i.e. engaging them.

&gt;If I refuse to debate someone who wants to debate me then I think that's my right.

Of course, and I agree. Not sure what attacks have to do with what I was saying there though, so I'll elaborate on my point.

I was addressing a common sentiment among gg'ers, which I saw in your post: which usually boils down to ""You need to be exposed to alternate and opposing viewpoints to challenge your own views."" You said it as ""this type of dialog is fundamental to science"" (as I understood, correct me if wrong), but it is often expressed through mocking ""sjws"" for their ""echo chambers"" and ""safe spaces"".

Now, the core sentiment by itself is good, but once again like the free speech discussion, its just abused by misapplication. There are plenty of times where you don't want or need to be exposed to alternate and opposing viewpoints, in both science and outside of it, hence my example. 

&gt;The problem is that I think we've taken ideas like ""political correctness"" and made the synonymous with bigotry without the weight of calling someone a bigot (hence the cartoon).

I wouldn't dispute that it happens. Being politically incorrect does not necessarily mean you are bigoted.

However, I'd argue that the majority of time ""stop being politically incorrect"" is invoked, the person IS being bigoted. Someone will make a bigoted comment, someone criticizes them for it, and then they complain about how the ""PC police"" are taking over. Complaining about ""political correctness"" is being used as a shield from criticism of bigoted values, which is where the main complaints from the socjus side come from.

&gt;And that does have a silencing effect (even if I don't think I'd call it censorship per se, maybe, grey area). I know this because I write stuff like this: The Harm of ""Rape Myth"" Myths, under a pseudonym because I know I'd be kicked out of my department if I wrote it under my own name. I'd lose my job because it's ""politically incorrect"", though I think everything I say there is justified by the facts and I don't think I say anything particular controversial. 

&gt;I don't think there are many people at all out there advocating for banning books or preventing Free Speech but they contribute to a climate that I find concerning. 


I agree with you, it definitely would be a case of political correctness going too far to fire you for something like that. 
It is a very delicate subject and it doesn't help that discussion of it is often done in bad faith by people looking to confirm misogynistic views. I don't think there is a good solution for this. I think if Ghazi crosses this line its valid to criticize them for it but I don't think it's fair to say Ghazi is really in favor of excessive political correctness like that.


&gt;It's like when Bahar Mustafa was charged. I think it was perfectly in-line with the kind of legislation that Ghazi tends to advocate for but only because they don't see it being applied to themselves. People were worried something similar might be the case here with SU hence all the concerns about ""being consistent"". 

I cant really comment on this because Im not sure what types of legislation that you are talking about. (I suspect I may read less ghazi than you do). I think the fact that Ghazi treated the SU case the way they did should be at least an indicator that they have some self-awareness of the dangers of legislation like that.

1710,"And now we've gotten to pretty much the meat of the argument, here's a post I can safely disagree with pretty much 100%.

&gt;I can't get past Ghazi's (in general) approach to Free Speech. Even just the mocking ""Freeze Peaches""-bit. Now I get the teasing at the expense of some of the people here who don't seem to get the nuance of the back and forth we've both been having.

&gt;I actually find it genuinely terrifying the way that Ghazi seems to brush aside this thing that is integral to a modern, scientific, democratic system. 

I mean you say you get it, but then you don't. The mocking of ""Freeze Peaches"" is almost entirely mocking misapplication of the principle of free speech, not the principle of free speech itself. In the same way that ""Muh Soggy Knees"" is mocking misapplication of accusations of misogyny. 

This would be a problem if it was used to mock legitimate instances or concerns of free speech issues. I maintain it is not. 

it's brushed aside because its irrelevant to the discussions that GG claims it is relevant in, like the self-censorship examples you give.

If you agree that ""allowing for a platform provider to censor 3rd party content on their own platform"" is free speech, then ghazi is more for free speech than GG in many instances. Even in the SU issue, ghazi maintained that CN had a right to self-censor. Top post on both threads I saw.

Even if there are ghazi who are against free speech, id argue that it isnt what the movement is defined by.
The goal of ghazi isn't to be for or against free-speech.

&gt;Even just the ""political correctness"" ranting. Like they'll point to things like this the other day: https://www.instagram.com/p/BAVKJRiL6Ue/

&gt;and I'm thinking more about academics being able to publish books like the Bell Curve. The book hand fundamental errors. But establishing wrong the authors were wrong was fundamentally important to understanding some of the most important issues related to education, race and culture. 

Why? Why are you thinking about that? Where are the ghazi's that are banning politically incorrect books, or any media?

Here's ghazi on banning games for example:

&gt;It was certainly a politically incorrect book (an factually incorrect in many cases) but that sort of dialogue is fundamental to science. The notion that we'd even discuss doing away with that sort of thing is something I don't even want to be near.

I find this interesting because there are numerous situations in which scientists refuse to have a dialogue or debate with all sorts of wackjobs, or give them a platform to speak.

1711,"Hey sorry for the late reply!

&gt;If you get a chance, I'd actually love to hear any minor differences you'd have. 

Mainly, if a platform provider censors 3rd party content on their own platform, I'd call that regular censorship. Which is why I say censorship is not always bad, because there can be valid reasons to censor your own platform. We agree on the important underlying point, its just a disagreement on word definition. Semantics.

&gt;As a little bit of an aside though, I found it odd that you labelled yourself as Ghazi earlier on...  
&gt;Anyway, this is a long-winded and somewhat undirected way to say I don't think you need to label yourself like that. The group you associate with doesn't decide what you think (or it shouldn't). Labelling yourself like that creates unnecessary assumptions about the other ideas you might hold that may not be true. Particularly here, where people may have biased views of ""the other side"" (vice versa being true for Ghazi as well).

Well, I labelled myself as a ghazi because I was entering a GG discussion when my views are pretty generally on the side of ghazi. Its a helpful label because I generally hold the same views as ghazi, and also because part of my post was an observation that those are the views that ghazi hold. Part of my point IS to address the assumptions that GG holds about Ghazi.

&gt;I wrote explicitly in the article, I'm not a GGer. I agree here and there. I think they have the better axioms of the two groups (Ghazi vs KIA kind-of) in so far as they value the right things even if they (KIA/GG) seem to get constantly unfocused on completely the wrong things (like Milo). Hence why I try to write to them.

Well, i mean, on paper, sure.
I am assuming you are talking about Free Speech and ethics in game journalism (not saying it in a mocking way), which are both not bad in themselves. But your statement that ""GG focuses on completely the wrong things"" is really the crux of the issue. I feel a more central ""axiom"" of GG is being anti-sjw and anti-feminism, in a way that even overrides the ""free speech and ethics"" axioms. Self censorship being a good example. Just look at the reception of your articles:
Criticism of Ghazi ""hypocrisy""? 200+ upvotes, but supporting self censorship couldn't reach 5.  

The GG view is that generally censorship, and self-censorship is always bad, which you disagree with.  
Ghazi view is about criticizing the reasons why it was censored, which people paint as hypocrisy because ""we are okay with some censorship but not other censorship"". The semantics of ghazi may be wrong (""only government can censor"" I disagree with), but I think ghazi holds the better position here.

1719,"I mean, I agree with the majority of what you are saying, and I already agree with your reasoning in regards to self-censorship, as I said before. 

&gt;I think that given that CN basically owns SU, that there are pre-agreed parameters for their relationship and creative remit; that it was self-censorship based on those pre-agreed rules with distributors and broadcasters. Though the SU team might have largely free reign to do what they want, they'll also understand that certain things have to fit within the Broadcast guidelines. So they would know ahead of time that adding a sex scene would be a no-go for instance. 

I mean, this is true even if CN doesn't own SU, right? And it's something I doubt they knew ahead of time would be censored, because remember it aired in the US no problem, and I doubt CN gives SU regional broadcast guidelines, but this is all really just speculation at this point...

so what im getting to is

&gt;Censorship, one group silencing another that wants to and has a provided or public outlet to speak, is always wrong.

1721,"&gt;""Right in some situations"" and ""good or bad"". Are these not contradictory? How can something be the right thing to do, but then not be good or bad?

No they aren't, it's a pretty straightforward statement. 
censorship sometimes right and good. censorship sometimes wrong and bad. You may disagree with it but its not contradictory.

&gt;When is it a bad/wrong situation to use censorship, when is it right? You speak like obviously there are situations were such things are certain, but as soon as you change your point of view, those things don't stay the same. What makes the act okay, and what makes it not okay?

When is anything good or bad? Have you never encountered a grey issue in your life? The point is to have discussion based on individual context.

&gt;My point was I agree because it aligns with my view. Yes, I don't want those things to be said, but I also don't want to force people to stop speaking. I agree it's okay because CN has the rights to broadcast what they want, but it still a situation that is not advised and your scenario does not accept any compromise or discussion as a solution

Why does it align with your view?  
Why did you decide censorship is okay in that case?  
Are you not making a judgement on whether it was right to censor that content?
Commit to a stance! You cant have both ""those things shouldn't be said"" and ""I don't want to force them to stop speaking.""
Why is the situation not advised? Yes, that's part of the scenario, and the SU team refuses to compromise on their artistic vision.


&gt;there is no universal right and wrong to censorship (which you avoid by doing the ""gotcha"" and switching the subject).

1723,"&gt;I'm saying that if censorship as an act is okay, it has to be acceptable for anyone to use it for whatever reason

Why? Why can't it be a grey issue that is only right in some situations? context matters.

&gt;What you deem the right and correct situations, others will deem it wrong. There is no objectivity to morality.

Exactly why I am arguing that censorship is a grey area, not black and white good or bad.

&gt;You can think it's wrong to censor something because of it's specific content, but it means nothing if there is nothing wrong with the act. 
&gt;How can it be wrong to do something if it's allowed? 

I'm not sure what you mean here. Censorship can sometimes be wrong, yes.

&gt;And I listed objectification, not as a ridiculous example, but as something that generally seems okay to censor from what I've seen from Ghazi. It's okay to cover up women, shrink their busts, crop them, etc. If there are right things to censor, I would assume you thought those were okay considering your circle. Do you find those acceptable because you feel they portray women in a bad light? Or are those ""wrong"" forms of censorship as well?

Depends on context of individual situations. I would not universally say they are right, I would not universally say they are wrong either.

&gt;As for your ""gotcha"" scenario, yes, I would likely agree because it lines up with my views. 
&gt;But if my views were the same as the show writers, my opinion would be of course not. This is the whole ""different view point"" thing

So you agree that its okay for CN to censor in that situation, while apparently maintaining the position that all censorship is not okay. Mentioning that different view points exist doesn't get you out of the ""gotchya"" scenario, the view you are holding is still contradictory. You either have to agree that censorship is okay in some situations, or condemn CN for censorship in that situation.

1728,"This is really interesting to read and see upvoted here because as a ghazi, AFAIK this has a lot in common with the ghazi position on the issue. It also has a much better grasp on what censorship is than most people on both sides of the issue. (Mostly because the term has extremely negative connotations, so like you said it's easy to view it as ALWAYS wrong, so ghazi instead of saying self-censorship is okay, instead says that self-censorship is not censorship, which imo is also not correct).

What I would dispute is your criteria for when ""self-censorship"" becomes ""Censorship"".  
lets look at your example:

&gt;I mean I would say that in this instance Cartoon Network, who owns SU, looked at their market and decided that the same sex dancing might make UK/EU audiences ""uncomfortable"" (their words) and removed it. To be clear, they made the wrong decision, as I've said, and I think people should call that out.

&gt;Now had they had an anti-gay group hammering on their twitter, telling them they should have removed it I'd call that straight up old fashioned Censorship. 

Why does that become the major distinction? In both cases CN is appeasing the anti-gay group, it's just that in one case the group remains silent and in the other case the group is vocal about their criticisms. 

In your blog post, you use an example of a game with a furry element, where the furry element is self-censored"" so as not to freak too many people out and hopefully get more customers"". If people where making it a vocal complaint on your twitter instead of you just guessing, is it not self-censorship still? In the end you still have the choice whether to remove it or not.

Starting off with an insult, great start

Show up at his house? Any of the other laughable and unfounded bullshit made up about ""GG""? We're supposed to suffer such inane trash because he came polite with his first step?

*So let me get this straight.*
These are the most negative posts he made:
&gt;""My regular account is also tied to a bunch of creative business stuff I do. All it takes is one crazy person. shrug.""

&gt;""That's not the side I was worried about""

and these are posts you guys made

&gt;If ghazi found out you were saying nice things to those goobergators, your job would likely be in peril. (+138)

&gt;One wonders why that doesn't make you reconsider the side you chose. You know, if you realize that you face persecution, doxxing and consequences with your job just for being nice to people on this sub?
I mean, really, at what point do you realize that you're the bad guy? .  (+132)

&gt; Oh. Wait. If you actually are SJW your friends likely are as well. And so they would crucify you for any sort of basic human compassion. Understandable. (+31)

&gt;I hope that you manage to slink out of the Ouroboros that is the increasingly totalitarian and authoritarian social justice sphere before it eats you alive for outrage value. (+3)

So please, keeping that in mind, please tell me in this thread, which side is characterizing the other as ""all monsters""? (And please respond ""well it's different because we are right though"" because that would be an impressive way of missing the point)

&gt;Stop being so dramatic.

Oh my, goodness me, I'm sorry. I bow before your clearly logical posts which had no hyperbole nor exaggeration at all. What do I know, I'm just a craaazy sjw

EDIT: Oh yea and I  forgot to respond this fun tidbit

&gt;And yes, the tune of ""lol I'm not worried about what people on my side would think if I was civil to you lot"" is pretty dishonest and some hilariously schoolyard-tier crap

So you are saying that his comment ""That's not the side I was worried about"" is simultaneously 

1. insulting to you because he believes gg is all monsters, but also

2. dishonest because he must be lying, and hes REALLY actually scared of his own group and not gg?

What, do you believe that someone who holds views contrary to your own cannot exist or something?

&gt;Those are the critics' OPINION and an average even, not a consensus by a long shot. They don't all agree and even if they were, you would have to ma
ke the judgement to prefer a critic's opinion over your own, first, which is a subjective judgment call and not a given (and it would make your argument circular to assume that you should always do so because critics are objectively right.)

What do you consider a ""general consensus""	 to be and why would you consider these not a consensus? The definition of consensus allows for some dissent.

&gt;It's true. 

Right..  There's a reason I didn't say i didn't say it was wrong, I said it was a meaningless statement. Reducing value to just a personal level only makes the term rather useless, because like you said, there's a subjective level to ALL value. 

For an extreme example, there are indigenous tribes that have mostly avoided interacting with modern civilization. To a member of such a tribe I doubt that a hundred dollar bill would hold any value. Yet we don't go around saying that the value of money is subjective, because generally we agree on what it is worth. 

&gt;There is no such thing, at all. 

Well this is just ignoring reality. You can disagree with the concept, but to argue that ""there is no such thing as a general consensus on good or bad music"" is objectively wrong. Go to metacritic or any aggregate review site for an easy reference on albums that are generally critically acclaimed or generally critically panned.

ezpz. Of course if you suddenly stop development out of nowhere, people are going to try to find out what caused it, idk why you guys tried to pretend there was no reason? No one would hate you for it. 

Ill admit, the refusal to release the current progress doesn't make that much sense in that context either. 6 years releasing builds, Nintendo ignoring you the entire time, and suddenly the legal threat is so scary that releasing the current version, even to the community, is too dangerous? Can you see why that's unconvincing, or at least frustrating?

CASE IN POINT - sickle cell anemia

The very article you linked explains that ""It's Not a 'Black Disease"", did you actually read it?

&gt;""What we've discovered is that where malaria is prevalent in the world (in areas that are now or once were hot and humid – ideal breeding grounds for malaria carrying mosquitoes), sickle cell is also prevalent. This is because people who carry sickle cell genes are more resistant to malaria.

&gt;Malaria has been around longer than humans have and has always acted on human populations. Therefore, since our beginning, malaria has been 'selecting for' the sickle cell gene (it kills non sickle cell/non malaria resistant people and leaves behind sickle cell carriers to reproduce and pass on the sickle cell gene). This explains why, despite our racial assumptions about sickle cell, the disease is for example rare in South Africa but prevalent in Greece. Sickle cell does not follow dark skin. Sickle cell follows malaria. ""

Thought experiment!
You agree that it's extremely stupid and offensive. Think about it. What makes it offensive? 

Also, the etymology of the word is a completely different issue. Do you also have the same complaint about the word xenophobia? the suffix phobia can also mean hatred, dislike, or contempt.

And finally, there are different levels of transphobia. Obviously intentionally misgendering someone is not on the same level of going out and saying that all trans people need to be locked up.

&gt;I think people should strive to communicate correctly, so that others don't struggle to understand them. 

No one struggles to understand use of the word literally as an intensifier.  Unless you struggle to understand it? Then the fault would be on you, as use of literally as an intensifier is common knowledge. 

&gt;It's the same argument when someone doesn't know the definition of a relatively easy word, e.g. curmudgeon.  It's not my fault they're illiterate, why should I dumb down my vocabulary?

Use of the word as it is commonly used is not illiteracy. 

&gt;No, my point is literally is bad because it has valid and useful definitions, of which an intensifier isn't one.  

This is an arbitrary judgement you are making. Its also completely wrong since the modern definition of literally includes its valid and useful use as an intensifier. 

&gt;The fact that myopic young people are proudly butchering language doesn't make it cool, it makes them morons.

The fact that older people cling on to antiquated definitions and are unable to adapt to changing language doesn't make them ""correct"", it makes them morons. lel

What makes your opinion more valid then the other opinion ""banning a rapist from their venues in order to make other players more comfortable is actually right?""

Lmao, no thats not what im claiming at all

""The weapon is broken in pubs because the teamwork is not as strong as competitive""

The arrogance is that you think the entirety of pubs should change instead of the weapon. You don't just balance for the highest skill level, you balance for pubs too. They are 99% of the players you know. If something consistently makes pubs not fun it might be a problem

&gt;Again your bias is showing. When I state ""your suggestion the weapon needs nerfing would cripple engies,"" your response is ""I don't care."" It's very clear you make your claims NOT in the interest of well-balanced gameplay, but in the interest of servicing your own preferred classes.

kek way to misread

crippling =/= boring

I cant take anybody seriously who thinks engie is crippled without gunslinger

wranglered lvl3s are still a thing

And as for the rest of your post Ive literally never heard of people having trouble with scouts in a pub.. When I deal with a team with a lot of scouts its actually FUN cuz fast moving jumping targets are fun to fight. A frustrating experience is shooting down stationary targets that autoaim one after the other aka **minis**.
At this point I'm just going to assume you aren't good. By pubs do you mean like valve servers? Because yea I don't touch those with a 40 foot pole

2024,"&gt; By this logic, level 3 sentries are about just as bad 

If you read my post I specifically addressed the difference between minis and lvl 3s

&gt;However, again it would be a mistake to claim the Gunslinger is in some way flawed or an oddity within the community; many weapons and classes function just as you've laid out. It functions just like everything else

Lol ok, lets see all these examples

&gt;Wanna play Scout but there's minis? Don't go where they're at. 

Thanks to their quick building and low metal cost and still decent functionality, chances are wherever you want to be has a mini. God forbid if there is 2 gunslinger engies.

&gt;Wanna play Heavy but there's a pro enemy sniper? Don't cross his sightlines, or only do so under very safe circumstances (maybe he just headshot a teammate for example so you know the sniper lacks a charge shot

Okay, sniper sightlines are an almost similar situation, except it actually requires skill and aim, and heavy has tools to deal with it. There is also plenty of interesting counterplay, like juking. Compared to minis, where the counterplay is boring. 

&gt;Wanna play Spy? Better hope half the fucking server didn't have the same idea, because if your team lacks a front line almost entirely

I fail to see how this situation is comparable, pretty much any specialist class is ineffective if you already have 4 of them

&gt;And wanna play Sniper but there's a competent Spy who wants to shut you down? You NEED your team.

Ya I also find this dynamic way better than minis too. If a spy wants to shut you down that hard he has to devote 100% of his life to doing it, which I could pretty much do the same thing with the majority of classes, and sniper also has plenty of tools to deal with spy, as well as audio clues. It also requires a competent spy like you said

&gt;and it's boring."" As I said, this is your personal opinion

lmao I don't think ive met a person who has said they enjoy fighting minis. Don't try and act like this is some personal annoyance of mine, TONS of people will gladly tell you that minis are dumb and boring to fight

&gt;But please, let's not act like your opinion holds some objective high ground here. You hate the weapon and consider it OP or ""bad game design.

I think it's pretty objective that if it's not bad game design, then it is at least worse than most weapons in tf2, being
-unfun to fight against
-poorly skill indexed
As well as the other reasons i said in my last post.
Id say I have some pretty good objective high ground


Im just gonna ignore your loose cannon rant as I don't really think its relevant, for all you know I think that weapon is op too

&gt;arrogantly claim the weapon is ""bad game design

Lmao you sit there claiming the entire pub world doesn't get it and if they would just play the game right the weapon would be fine but I'm the one who's arrogant for critiquing a weapons design

smh

&gt;Engie would get super, super frustrated and bored a lot of the time because he simply wouldn't have much in the way of combat ability

I don't really care, honestly its pretty boring to play with minis to me. Just because engie is boring to play doesn't mean he deserves a poorly designed weapon to ruin pubs with

&gt;Minisenties fill a very neccesary niche of allowing engies to be more involved with front-line combat while also providing a much needed counter for scout spam.

Lmao, no, there is no necessary niche there.

You don't see medics complaining that they can't DM in front-line combat, or spies

Engie comes equipped with a perfectly good shotgun actually so front-line wise he already had it better than 2 specialist classes

&gt;a much needed counter for scout spam. Dunno about you, but I hate scout spam.
&gt;Also of course there's heavies on pubs, but it's undoubtedly the least common class

Lmao I swear to god tell me what pubs you frequent because less heavies! more scouts! That sounds FUN AS FUCK

2025,"Do you even play pubs lol? tons of people love playing heavy, which also can cause issues

And tons of weapons work fine with ""pub culture""
There are plenty of weapons that have good skill curves, and won't shut down an ""I feel like playing *insert class here* today"" moment.

Once again, there's the mildly condescending ""the games name is TEAM fortress 2 duh"" mentality there. You can claim anythings balanced in the name of teamwork, and having to use a specific class to deal with specific weapon is probably the least interesting form of teamwork tf2 has to offer.

Earlier post on mine about the subject:

&gt;The whole thing that balances the concept of an auto-aim sentry is set up time. You can ""claim an area"" by being a sitting duck whacking on a sentry for 7-8 seconds while you bring up a level 1. When you have a sentry up, you and your team around the sentry is pretty much free from flanks. If your sentry goes down, its an accomplishment for the other team.. you have to build again for 7-8 seconds in order to get your auto-aim sentry again, and sentries are easily destroyed if they are shot at during this time. A balanced concept that rewards you with a powerful method of flank denial while also having good counterplay for the other team.

&gt;Minis on the other hand, go up in 3 seconds and you aren't vulnerable while placing them (you don't have to whack them). While you are pushing, you can plop down a mini and protect your team for flanks for free almost instantly. If the team shoots your mini down - it's no accomplishment. You can have one up again immediately. It's no longer just an area denial tool for places you already control, its a free auto-aim weapon that you can bring into combat with you. The enemy team now suddenly always has to deal with your sentry, even when defending a push. Flanking becomes way less important and long range attrition becomes more important.

&gt;Sentries should be never be an easy to use offensive weapon. It's bad game design and its boring.

In a pub id take 4 scouts over 2 gunslinger minis or 2 heavies any day. It takes some aim to do okay with scout, most pub scouts just aren't that good. If you are in a situation where you are getting gangbanged by 4 players thats hardly an issue of class, any class will wreck you 4 on 1.
&gt;Pubs being pubs again, it doesn't often occur that people say ""hey how about you go soldier/heavy/demo and I go medic to shut down that mini spam"".........If it weren't for pub culture being what it is, the damned thing would never have a bad name to begin with.


Or perhaps some people realize that it was poorly designed. I hate when people act like they are the only people to realize that yes, it is easier to deal with minis when you switch to an explosive class and have a medic up your butt. You aren't the only person to have this epiphany. It's still a poorly designed weapon.

Second, the overwhelming majority of full time workers already get benefits, it is the law in most cases

I never said McD's should make everyone fulltime and I know they won't. Part timers will often still need to get a second job. Nothing you are saying is contradicting what I am saying.

You just pretty much repeated your last post, so I'll repeat mine. 
There is no evidence that supports your narrative of fast food workers having zero work ethic who are just ""content in their skilless job"". 

Geez, have you even worked fast food before?
In my experience, it's a miserable, stressful job, where you are caught between antagonistic managers and antagonistic customers. My current desk job is way less stressful and easier (although it takes more skill). Working fast food will never give someone a ""life they want"" even with a $15 min wage, because it will always be part time, no benefits, shitty unstable schedule, and not an enjoyable job in the least. Believe me, I doubt many people work there because it is the job they want.

[you should read this](http://www.businessinsider.com/five-huge-myths-about-working-in-fast-food-2015-4)

&gt; To those of us that work 50 hours a week after working through school and not having much more than what they are given for nothing makes no sense. Why would I do this for only a marginally better life? 

This is crab mentality. If you are working 50 hour weeks after an education and only making marginally more than a livable wage then you are being undervalued. That has nothing to do with fast food workers.

2103,"&gt;One politician's opinion does not outweigh how our society actually works.

Franklin is not just ""one politician"", he is the president who signed in the Fair Labor Standards Act which gave us the federal minimum wage. If you don't want to take his very relevant ""opinion"", try this:

&gt;(whenever wages) “are less than the cost of living and the reasonable provision for maintaining the worker in health, the industry employing her is in receipt of the working energy of a human being at less than its cost, and to that extent is parasitic.”

This is from [""Commission on Minimum Wage Boards""](http://radioboston.wbur.org/2012/06/05/mass-minimum-wage) from 1912, which is the first minimum wage laws ever passed. The intent is very clear. 

&gt;You are the one who is dead wrong, which you should be able to see considering minimum wage is not livable in nearly any state

well no shit, that's the problem. The fact that todays min wage is not livable does not mean that the original intent of min wage was for the min wage to not be livable.

&gt; In America they are a starting point for entering the work force, you have to work your way up. Those are the principles America was founded on

America was ""founded"" on fucking slavery, sweatshops, and child labor, there was no minimum wage. Those are the principles America was founded on. Either society progresses or we can stay in the 1800's.

Lmao, McDonalds is still one of the biggest and most lucrative restaurant businesses in the world, with 35,000 outlets worldwide. They are not anywhere near anything ""forcing their hand"". At the very least, a gradual wage increase over 5 years for ~2% of their restaurants ( &lt; 800 in ny) is not going to be the thing that does it. 

&gt;admit that the job will certainly be more competitive

This is true, but in the end, its still not much of a difference. I don't think people understand how shitty fast food jobs are. Part time, no benefits, scheduling often requires you to be very flexible and is all over the place. I'd much rather work 9-5 at $13 rather than part-time fast food at $15. And plenty of people who work in the industry are hard workers in the first place, they just don't have skills or education.

Crab mentality. Personally I thought $13 would be a more fair wage, but the ""other jobs don't make that much"" is a poor argument regardless

&gt;I generally see three cashiers at a given time at a McDonalds.

You must live in a major city with extremely busy restaurants or something, I rarely see more than two, and sometimes I only see one person staffing the register, 3 would be the max

Your calculations also miss the fact that there would still need to at least 1 person working register regardless to ""assist"" if needed, or for people who just don't want to use the computer (look at france, they have kiosks and a large amount of people just don't like using them)

and finally, your savings calculation seems to be the difference between an $8 and $15 wage for cashiers, not savings for moving to automation, but lets play this game. 800 mcdonalds in ny (im rounding up). lets say it costs $200k yearly to raise wages to $15 per location (double your estimate).
That comes out to 160,000,000 - which is still a small fraction of mcdonalds 5 billion annual profit (3%)

But again, all this is ignoring the fact that this situation has already happened and has turned out fine.

2167,"&gt; ""My bias"" is a red-herring. I was alluding that the people complaining don't play Engineer often, and so they're in no position to make authoritative statements on the changes.

I know what you were saying, and yes it is a bias. You don't have to be an engineer main to judge game balance. If you are playing the ""oh you aren't qualified to comment"" card, then I'm playing the ""I'm a higher div and have more comp and general experience than you"" card. Both cards are dumb, but hey.

&gt;Class experience doesn't necessarily transfer from one class to another, and different classes have different things that they need to be aware of so that point's irrelevant

Yep exactly, each class has class specific knowledge that doesn't necessarily transfer so pointing out that engineer takes some class specific knowledge is pretty irrelevant, that's not something unique to engineer. And would you look at that, that's exactly what I was saying in my last shitpost

&gt;Something being difficult to use, and being weaker are two different things. The Gunslinger is significantly weaker than it was Pre-Gunmettle. As I said earlier, I'm complaining because pretty much every weapon can destroy a mini sentry in one hit before it finishes building, and manually building mini sentries means you're going to eat spam and not be able to contribute as much DM-wise to a mid-fight you're pushing into. If the enemy team are paying attention, you can't do much.
&gt;Nice shitposting.

Lmao, yes, sounds like a nerf

idk if you were paying attention to my shitposting but im not sure why you keep trying to illustrate why it is a nerf, I already agreed that it is.

&gt; Gunslinger just isn't very good offensively anymore.

And this is pretty much the whole point. Sentries should have neeeeverrrr been made into an offensive weapon. offensive aimbot weapons have no place in a multiplayer fps, its bad game design. sentries = area-denial and that's the way it should be. Did you read the post I linked in the last thread? If you wanted to play a class that contributes hugely DM-wise to a mid-fight, play a DM class. Minis are still amazing for shutting down flanks and single class aggression. And before you complain that minis were nerfed to the point of uselessness, I bet most engineers will still run minis to mid instead of lvl1's so they obviously still have a use

&gt; I just see the contradiction in claiming the Gunslinger deserved to be nerfed because it wasn't skillful enough,

I never said gunslinger should be nerfed *because* it takes no skill, the point I was making that most people do abuse it without any skill and get disproportionate results because of it. It should have gotten nerfed because the concept of easy to use offensive sentries that you can pop out easily is broken. Again, comp isn't the only thing in the game, referring primarily to pubs here. And I'm sorry, but if the point you are making is that backburner is skillless I can guarantee you that skillless player gets waaaay more mileage out of pooping minis everywhere than holding wm1 at people

I don't really care for getting into long arguments over tf2 (if i wanted to get into dumb arguments Id go to spuf) so If you don't have any interesting points to make I will probably just shitpost in reply, a friendly warning",2015-07-17 13:51:47+00:00,ct6jcvb,6.0,t1_ct68ud0,32300.0,tf2
2168,"&gt;I play Engineer in UGC Silver

It's good you play comp, but comp isn't the only thing the game is balanced for. I'm technically plat with most of my experience in gold, but I don't preface every statement I make with it, especially since not everything is comp (and this isn't even a competitive forum)

&gt;A lot of people in this thread have no idea what they're talking about because they don't actually main Engineer, and it's probably one of their least played classes

Have you considered that as an engineer main who plays in ugc silver this may be the fact that makes you biased?

&gt;but they think they can make authoritative statements like ""The people whining are the people who were abusing it mindlessly."" 

This is true, I probably shouldn't have generalized that hard. I would say most of the people were abusing it mindlessly to great effectiveness.

&gt;The skill of using the Gunslinger came from the Engineer's game sense, experience and DM

Like literally every other single class in the game

 l e l

except no one else gets free auto-aim sentries rip

&gt;The changes don't make it more difficult to use

So then why are you complaining?

&gt;Having to manually build mini sentries means you're going to eat spam and makes it easier to focus both you and your mini
&gt;They just made it inconvenient to use, and provided significantly more opportunities for counterplay.

Yep this is very much a nerf, good observation

&gt;You place down a mini sentry and it gets destroyed in one hit before it's even half built.

Yes you can't place free sentries while you are under fire now, rip

&gt;Hell, you spend more time punching and pre-building mini sentries than you do using your DM so I'd argue that it takes less skill to use.

You could make this argument, but it'd be a poor argument

&gt;Also find it ironic that the Pyro Main with a 51,000 kill Backburner is arguing the Gunslinger deserved the nerf because it wasn't skillful enough.

&gt;Totally agree, it's a huge ongoing problem with /r/bestof[2] . I only bring up bestof because it highlights a difference in intent, and is relevant to harassment. 

Oh absolutely I agree, intent is definitely important

&gt;That may be the case.

And I'm taking this as a tentative agreement that antagonism does not necessarily fall under harassment.
Maybe we can start making progress on what should fall under harassment. *Generally speaking*, is a sarcastic response to a question harassment?

&gt;Well, I think you'll find that I'm not contending that vote manipulation falls under the new harassment policy, but under the other long standing reddit rules of vote manipulation

Okay, true, but I was never contesting the fact that SRS used to do this stuff years ago. 

&gt;...and continues to do it today. It also serves to show that the other case of vote manipulation I linked to from just a few days ago represents behavior that's been going on for years.

If this is consistent behaviour that is continuing today, then you shouldn't need evidence from years ago, right?

&gt;It's not

Thank god we finally got that one sorted out :)

&gt; if you're going to make the counter point that ""this isn't vote manipulation, clearly all of these downvotes are coming from non SRS users

I never made that counter-point in reference to the link you posted. My counter-point was ""this isn't *evidence* of vote manipulation, because the downvotes *could* be coming from anywhere else but srs.

&gt;you don't know how burden of proof works

The default position is that a subreddit doesn't vote-brigade. If you want to claim that a subreddit DOES consistently vote-brigade, then yes the burden of proof is on you. If I claim that it doesn't, again I'm just maintaining the default position. Also known as ""innocent until proven guilty""

Which is something you can't really prove. the fact is (Now this is a provable claim I'm making) that the majority of SRS post votecounts are visibly unaffected in any way. Lets drop the harassment issue for now and focus on vote-brigading.
Lets take a thorough look at the SRS front page. 25 posts. One is a meta post which doesn't have any vote count information so disregarding that off the back.

These are the posts which are deleted so they really can't tell me anything either(

and these are the posts where the vote went down:

[**(1)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/3d3bzg/on_pedophiles_i_almost_think_theyre_heroes_20/)
 - This post is the only post that went into the negatives. Notice that there are multiple posts calling the linked comment out, and none of them are from SRS'ers. Can you admit that this is more likely a general change of opinion than a SRS vote-brigade? Read to the end of my post before answering.

[**(2)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/3d2drj/in_response_to_a_woman_in_a_very_nicely_made/)

Once again, ran redective on the comments that called the linked comment out, none of them seem to be SRSers.

 - This post is only down 8 points. Same exact situation as the other comments. Same question. 

[**(4)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/3cyhrt/in_a_thread_about_harley_quinn_and_poison_ivy/)
 - This post refers to 2 comments, one went up a few points, the other went down 10 points. Same situation, same question.

[**(5)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/3cxdub/if_two_men_get_married_and_divorce_how_does_the/)
 - This one went down a substantial amount (-600) but is still at a good positive 3k. This one has a loooooot of comments calling it out. I don't have the time to username check 200+ comments so I can't tell you how many SRS posters posted there. I'm betting once again that it was the tons of posts calling out the OP, and not an SRS vote-brigade, that caused the vote change. 

&gt;None of this has anything to do with anything we're talking about though. You've just pointed to an instance of SRS being arguably falsely accused of something? So? It's not necessarily fair to SRS but it happens all the time, and I'm not falsely accusing them of things that were actually perpetrated by an entirely different group of people.
&gt;As for you implying that I'm coming from a place of ignorant SRS hatred.  I'm not.

Of course, people who are coming from an inherently biased position and are letting it affect their opinions aren't likely to recognize their biases. 
Hold in mind the statement that you made about SRS vote-manipulation
&gt;""consistent behavior from SRS of ... vote manipulation. It provides context that this isn't just a singular instance I'm picking out of a hat

Now lets try some questions in relation to the downvoted SRS links I posted above.

Looking objectively, can you admit that comments like ""I almost think pedophiles are heroes."", ""I think hot chicks in cosplays are just paid to be there"", ""Because northern bigots believe that southerners are all bigots who hate black people"" are all innately very controversial?

Would you admit that plenty of people who are not SRS'ers would downvote those comments? (maybe even you?)

Would you admit that these could all be good examples of what the admin alienth said here?
&gt;What will oftentimes happen, even when SRS is not invoked, is someone makes a comment which is controversial, it gets voted up, someone replies pointing out that it is controversial, then the discussion gets noticed by everyone and lots of voting occurs. 

Now keeping in mind the claim I'm making that ""the majority of SRS post votecounts are visibly unaffected in any way"", and the secondary claim ""the posts that do get downvotes, could be easily explained by things other than a SRS vote-brigade"", Do you think that the front page of SRS is indicative of a ""notorious vote-manipulator""? Do you think that SRS gets undeserved flack for being ""The biggest vote manipulator on reddit""? Do you think that the average person posting a controversial statement should be more worried about SRS downvoting them or just the average redditor? Do you think that a subreddit that is shown to generally have negligible effects if any on post counts should be banned for vote-brigading? Do you think that cherry-picking one of those examples to cite as evidence of vote-brigading would be a bit deceptive?

2228,"&gt; 2 year old not wanting to be picked up. 

It's funny you keep saying this because this is easily your most disappointing and logically flawed post yet. I made straightforward and structured counter-points and then you kinda went and vomited all over the place. ew

&gt;There's a difference between /r/bestof[1] and SRS. Let's not be so intellectually dishonest that we can't even agree to that. One gives positive reinforcement to good posts, another harasses users for being in the same thread as 'bad people.'

Both wrong and irrelevant, wrong because r/bestof will downvote posts that don't agree with the bestof'ed post, irrelevant because I never even mentioned bestof when making that point

&gt;First off, this is a pretty large argument in my mind for why we shouldn't be banning anyone at all, but you've been arguing that these bans are justified. I'm just saying that if we are banning people for violating these new harassment rules, SRS should be included. You're essentially agreeing with me in this point as a way of defending your sub, which is exactly what I'd be doing if we were arguing about whether or not we should have these bans in the first place.

lmao no, literally none of that follows from the point i made. 

Its a simple point, that ""antagonism does not necessarily fall under the harassment policy"", none of your conclusions can be made from that

At this point I'm questioning your ability to make or understand a logically structured argument. I fear I may have overestimated you.

&gt;And in doing so they were very clearly deliberately antagonizing other users. And I'd argue in a systematic fashion that is consistently demonstrated.
&gt;Because I have evidence of SRS doing it and it was literally the first thing I clicked on off the front page. Other subs absolutely do not behave like that, with that consistency, with that intent. (Maybe some do, they should be banned as well according to the new rules)

Again, you have a fundamental misunderstanding (or intentional refusal to understand, idk) of the point I made in my previous post above

&gt;""your link from 2 years ago is not valid evidence""
&gt;Okay! My link from 2 years ago isn't valid evidence because you say so and are not willing to take it as valid evidence. 

Because the rules aren't being applied retroactively, so previous behavior years ago is irrelevant 

&gt;So if a vote count is still positive after SRS there's thousands of active users who are exercising a great deal of restraint, but when a vote count is negative following an SRS link that read it as positive, SRS users are only a mere few hundred and could never influence such a small number. There's literally no piece of evidence I can give you that you would recognize based off of what you claimed I needed to give you and your reaction to it. Again 2 year old not wanting to be picked up.

I swear you are soooooo close to getting this point, but it is still flying over your head.

I never said there's thousands of active users who are exercising restraint, just that if a vote count goes up after SRS links it, then it's clearly not evidence of a vote-brigade. Maybe there is thousands of users downvoting it. Maybe there isn't. Maybe aliens actually came and abducted the commenter. If none of this is clearly visible, how is it evidence of anything? Maybe you have the words EVIDENCE and CONJECTURE confused.

As for posts going down not being strong evidence, feel free the read the last few paragraphs in my last post again, maybe you'll understand it this time.

&gt;Whoa whoa whoa. I tried explaining this very point to you earlier but you wouldn't accept it. So I'm not going to accept it either. I gave you the best evidence I had available to me or you. Either you can find better conflicting evidence or you can just come up with contrivances for why you're right and I'm a silly sardine.

Rofl, no no no, not the same thing

You said ""If I had the tools to see it I would totally have evidence of vote brigading""

I said ""Well you don't have the tools so you don't have evidence of vote brigading""

Your ""best evidence"" is circumstantial at best. I dont have to find ""better conflicting evidence"", just shoot down the weak evidence you have. You are making the accusation of vote-brigading, the burden of proof is on you. But for better conflicting evidence, Ive already posted multiple statements about the situation by the admins. 

This is getting a bit boring now, prolly gonna give up on you soon, so I'll just link something for fun

Lets retread the reddit definition of harassment again

&gt; Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them.

Okay, starting with your first point. Basically my argument here is twofold:
 
 1. a handful of comment brigaders does not constitute harassment, and 
 2. the comments that were posted by SRSer's, while they may be antagonistic, are not harassment

alright, 

Reasoning for point one: Following linked threads in small numbers and commenting is not against the rules. It happens in every meta sub in both directions - people follow into the linked thread, and people from the linked thread follow through to the meta sub. If you want proof of this, I'm sure I can find and cite a decent number of recent examples, none of them being SRS. If you consider that harassment, then a large amount of the site would need to be banned.

Reasoning for point two: First of all, antagonism is not usually harassment, although it can be. As you may know, antagonistic comments are a staple of any healthy internet discussion.  If every instance of antagonism is harassment, Reddit could not exist, because a good portion of the userbase would be banned. So, are these comments ""systematic and/or continued"", to ""torment or demean"" someone? Well, they were all on topic and relevant to the conversation. The prompt being ""WHY IS THIS SUB NOT BANNED?"", a clear starting point for discussion. Some posts were sarcastic, but they were all made to make fun of and dispute the argument that SRS is a major site rule-breaker and that there are ulterior motives that SRS isn't banned. I do not consider mocking an argument tormenting and demeaning someone, especially when that argument was clearly prompted. Once again, if you consider antagonism like that harassment, why aren't you asking for the entire site to be banned? Every subreddit will have comments like that.

To summarize, I do not believe those posts are evidence of harassment.
(note this is not my full argument on why SRS isn't worthy of a ban of harassment, I'm just focused on countering your point)

...

Now on to your second point:
First of all, your link from 2 years ago is not valid evidence because like I said, the current state of SRS is what is up for discussion. The new harassment rules were made in may.
Your other link... well, down like 15 points? Rather weak evidence. boo. Let me help you out: https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/3cuf6x/pao_right_in_the_kisser_1308_and_rising/

When linked today, this comment was at +1300 and rapidly rising. Now this comment is at [-800](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cucye/an_old_team_at_reddit/csz1bf6). WOW WHAT A BRIGADE. But wait a second how could SRS manage such a brigade with only ~300 active users at a time? that's 2100 downvotes. The highest voted post in SRS for the entire past month is 1800, and that's with a full month for members to upvote it. This linked comment underwent that change in under 10 hours. SRS does not have the userbase to compete with announcements so this is not an example of an SRS vote-brigade. 

Now for your evidence to be definitely evidence of vote-brigading it relies on the following assumption ""If a vote-count goes down after being linked, then it is an SRS brigade."" But I've found an example where a vote-count goes down after being linked and it was not an SRS brigade. Therefore your assumption is wrong. The post could have went down due to a brigade, or just down on its own. Without analytics tools and admin tools, an occasional post that drops in vote count is not evidence. Now, better evidence would be if the majority of posts linked by SRS went down in vote-count, because then the chances of them all being random drops in vote-count is very unlikely.

To summarize, these are not evidence of vote-brigading. 

&gt;Also, we won, so suck it bithc.

2278,"Wooooo, this is a doozy. Okay, might skip around a bit for this one, hope you dont mind

&gt;You say that doesn't count, now show me 10 more people!

&gt;Hey I know you found evidence that I asked for of brigading, but I'm not going to be willing to accept it until you show me X more. Now help me move these goalposts.

Lets make this clear: **You are the one who claimed there was literally dozens of people harassing and brigading in that thread. 
You claimed that thread was completely brigaded, that it was flooded with cancer, that there were tons of people now forced to deal with a SRS brigade in that thread.**

You said this, not me. 

I didn't ask for 10 *more* people. Just 10 in total, including the 4 I found, so you could actually back up the claim you made, because as far as I'm concerned, none of those statements you made are true. I'm actually impressed if you did actually find 3 more, because I checked as well as I could and I couldn't find anymore. 

I'm not moving the goalposts and asking you to show me MORE evidence. I'm asking you to actually back up what you are claiming as evidence. 

Okay, now, ready for this? If I made a point saying that SRS never brigades, then I am retracting it.  If a handful of comments is all takes to make a brigade, then SRS is brigaded all the time because tons of people come into linked SRS threads through the bot, just like ""Trevizzle0101"". Like I said before *commenting in linked threads is not against the rules of reddit*. Harassment is, and vote-brigading is. I guess it comes down to what comments you actually consider harassment.

for me, I only found 1 comment that could maybe be be construed as ""harassment"" according to the official harassment policy, and that person claimed to be an SRSer, but has never posted in SRS. 

&gt; I'm now telling you that the point is not that you're better or worse than the banned subs, but that you people harass and brigade people constantly

but that IS the point, every single sub that links to another sub in any way is going to have a handful people who comment in the linked thread, the only way to stop that is to have a complete ban of meta subs....

&gt;you're far worse than neoFAG though, and basically roughly the same as 'shitniggerssay.

....and once again I don't know anything about neoFAG or shitniggerssay all I know is that fph was easily banned under a harrasment policy where they were clearly violating it on a ""over the top"" level, with comments that were clearly made to ""torment or demean people. They are on different levels and if you can't see that difference we might just have conflicting worldviews. 
If you want to argue in comparison to neoFAG and/or shitniggerssay you'll have to find a different person to argue with =P

&gt;I didn't say that. I said I'm showing you evidence of an antagonizing comment brigade...

&gt;I'm showing you evidence of it. You're saying ""this doesn't count because of this loophole I made up and then discovered."" Ie. (vote counts haven't gone down 

Read the full quote and context of what you said and idk how you can interpret ""im showing you evidence of it"" anyway else. 

and yes, I knew u ""couldn't deliver on it"", because even if SRS vote-brigades, it's not even on a level that's clearly detectable, and even if the comment goes down, it's not really proof. SRS links to comments with karma as low as 20 and they still usually go up. Are you telling me that SRS can't vote-brigade a measly 20 karma comment down? cmon now.
Compare that to FPH, where there was ""found the fatty"" comments in the triple digits. How would vote-brigading on an undetectable level be ban-worthy? Furthermore, why is it up to me to prove that SRS isn't vote-brigading? Isn't the burden of proof on the accuser? And of course you refuse to believe the one person who actually has access to all the analytic tools so at that point we are stuck on this issue too. rip

2286,"&gt; at the very least a show of good faith, and I think it's telling SRS doesn't use them.

Why does SRS have to make a ""show of good faith""? They enjoy being the villains of reddit, especially because they know they aren't nearly as bad as people act they are. The only thing this is ""telling"" is that SRS is a circlejerk sub, which is true. 

&gt;What you're talking about is your amended position

To state my position explicitly, which may have got away from me:

Reddit defines harassment as 

&gt;Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them. 

SRS does not engage in harassment, at least not nearly on the level of FPH (and the other 4 subs, im sure they were doing similar things but I have no proof so whatev). . 

SRS does not engage in vote brigading

&gt;...you'll see that it has been completely brigaded by SRSers...

&gt;...with SRS's absurd reaction....

&gt;...flood of cancer...

&gt;...dozens of people now harassing ...

&gt;...I found 3 of them, and now there are considerably more...

&gt;...despite literal dozens of people from our sub coming in...

**holy hyperbole, batman!**

Lets play find the SRSer. If you can find even 10 out of the ""literal dozens"" of SRSer's you claim are harassing people in the linked comment thread, I'll gold the shit out of you, I swear on my reddit karma

I found 4: beccaface, TommorowsAshes, michaelceltic1888, and humanysta.  Out of those comments, all of them were in reply to a comment made wondering why srs isn't banned yet. 2 are a sarcastic defense (""well duh, its because we control reddit and sleep with the admins!""), 1 is the vote count defense you keep ignoring, and only 1 is a post that could be considered harassment (We like making you people mad!). This post was made by humanysta, who has *never even posted in srs*, but I'll give it to you as an SRS'er.

&gt;The fact that it's not serious doesn't mean it's not an SRS person coming in right after the thread was linked and disrupting the comment section and people within, and implicitly calling them assholes after someone (other than OP, the person presumably being bad) pointed out that it's absurd that SRS hasn't been bad. That's all the person that comment was responding to was guilty of, and here you have some dipshit from SRS thinking they deserve some dishing out of good old internet justice by insulting them

**Holy biased narrative, batman!** That little paragraph was so biased It'd make fox news jealous.

Okay, my turn!

*""It doesn't change the fact that ""Trevizzle0101"" just got mad and exclaimed that SRS should be banned (implicitly calling them rule breakers and assholes) when all SRS was doing was innocently discussing the racist comment in the safety of their own sub. Then this dipshit from r/videos decides to go to SRS after it was linked to disrupt their thread and accuse them of brigading! A few SRSers tried to defend their subs unbanned status with 2 of reddit's favorite things (sarcasm and logic) but tragically they were downvoted into oblivion. RIP""*

Aren't words great? you can twist what actually happened into two completely different narratives so easily, its fantastic

&gt;Yet they say nothing about the net effect of their brigading and vote manipulation. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/gloriouspcmasterrace/comments/1r01ny/glorious_masterrace_hear_me/cdih50a?context=2

At this point, there's either 2 things you can believe. Either the admins are right, or the admins are in bed with SRS and covering for them. 

&gt;I'm showing you evidence of it. You're saying ""this doesn't count because of this loophole I made up and then discovered.

What do you think *evidence* of VOTE-BRIGADING is?

You can't just say ""oh this comment was vote-brigaded, it was definitely downvoted by SRS, you just can't see it but it totally happened, if I had the tools to see it it would be there"" and call it evidence.

nope. this isn't how this works. This isn't how any of this works .jpg

&gt; a reasonable person, faced with an SRS brigade, would likely feel uncomfortable posting and sharing their opinions on this site.

Lmao, yea, that person was really made uncomfortable from that SRS brigade. with a whopping 500 upvotes and a whopping **ZERO** replies from SRS'ers 

That's right, there are 9 direct replies to that comment and according to http://www.redective.com/ NONE OF THEM HAVE ANY POST HISTORY IN SRS.

The 2 SRS posts in that thread are in response to a comment asking why they haven't banned SRS. They aren't even in response to the linked comment. That dude probably never even saw them, nor did they have anything to do with him.  Theres no ""influx of comments"", however many times you want to repeat that.

IDK how you aren't getting this, you are the one who posted the definition in the first place. It's a very simple concept. 

If I say 1+1=3
and you say ""that's wrong because you are a retard"" - thats ad hominem!
If you just say ""wow im not even gonna respond to that. You are a retard"" - That's not ad hominem, that's just an insult!

2303,"sure, lets play ""intro to logical fallacies""

lets analyze that statement!

&gt;I wrote a reasoned response and then I saw your username. Wanker confirmed. Go fuck yourself

Well lets see. Is he responding to your argument by attacking your character rather than the content of your argument? WOW! wait a second, he's not responding to your argument at all! You even admit that it isn't a response and its just name calling. ""Well, ls777"", you might be wondering, ""If that's not a response to my argument what is the point of that statement!""

Well lets see. I would say that this is a deductive argument that is completely unrelated to your previous argument, as it has 2 premises and a conclusion.

Premise 1: Your username is PaoIsACunt

Clearly verifiable and true.

Premise 2: Anyone with the username PaoIsACunt is a wanker. (a clearly implied premise)

This is also clearly verifiable and true, by the theory of common sense. Who else but a wanker would have a
 username like that?

Therefore the following conclusion must follow: You are a wanker. See, completely logical reasoning. Note again that the conclusion that you are a wanker has nothing to do with your previous argument nor is he claiming it does. No ad hominem here. 

^NOTE: Before you get confused, the part about the deductive argument is sarcasm. Not everything is an argument. You can call someone a retard with out it being a reasoned argument. fallacies only apply to reasoned arguments.

This is why the mods are quick to ban and why the rules to keep it a circlejerk are so stringent. It may come off as asshole-ish, but part of the appeal of the sub is that for once we're the majority. It's our space and we don't have to make room for people who don't ""get it"".

Yes, I do believe context is important. Throwing all kanyes songs into shuffle definitely diminishes the impact of certain songs, not to mention skits would be nonsensical. 

I guess it all depends if you view an album as a loose collection of tracks or a cohesive work.

I think music is best when in a stylistically cohesive album, so I would definitely prefer to listen to 5 albums by kanye than 50 mixed and shuffled singles by 50 artists with styles that would jar from one song to another.

2424,"The whole thing that balances the *concept* of an auto-aim sentry is **set up time.** You can ""claim an area"" by being a sitting duck whacking on a sentry for 7-8 seconds while you bring up a level 1. When you have a sentry up, you and your team around the sentry is pretty much free from flanks. If your sentry goes down, its an accomplishment for the other team.. you have to build again for 7-8 seconds in order to get your auto-aim sentry again, and sentries are easily destroyed if they are shot at during this time. A balanced concept that rewards you with a powerful method of flank denial while also having good counterplay for the other team.

Minis on the other hand, go up in 3 seconds and you aren't vulnerable while placing them (you don't have to whack them). 
While you are pushing, you can plop down a mini and protect your team for flanks for free almost instantly. If the team shoots your mini down - it's no accomplishment. You can have one up again immediately. It's no longer just an area denial tool for places you already control, its a free auto-aim weapon that you can bring into combat with you. The enemy team now suddenly always has to deal with your sentry, even when defending a push. Flanking becomes way less important and long range attrition becomes more important.

Sentries should be never be an easy to use offensive weapon. It's bad game design and its boring.

2430,"It's a combination of factors that caused that, a big part I'd attribute to the ridicule from the rest of the internet and the general social stigma, it forced them into their own sites which caused them to feel less like just fans of a show and more like parts of a community. It's pretty much impossible to discuss the show at all unless you go to one of these websites. Then consider the show itself - it emphasizes friendship and positiveness more than any other show that has a large fandom - and of course these values are all being heavily ingrained on these fans. 

So you end up with these super welcoming and friendly communities filled with tons of socially ackward dudes, gaining social acceptance at a level that they don't usually get from any other internet community - its not surprising that many end up self-identifying as a culture, and not just as fans of a show. Very cult-ish, in a way. The interesting thing is I think the furry fandom evolved in a very similar manner, so its not completely a novel concept.
