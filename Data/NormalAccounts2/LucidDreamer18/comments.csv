-He's still brand new to your home. It typically takes a month or two for a dog to really settle down and feel comfortable. Don't rush into things or expose him to stressful situations if you don't have to. No new people, no dog parks, etc.

-Do not force him to do anything. If he's plastered himself against a door or wall, leave him alone. Don't put him in a situation in which he feels the need to defend himself. The more he practices a bad behavior, the more ingrained it will become.

If he's truly in the way of your family members when you're gone, consider crate training him or just locking him in your room so he's out of the way and can't bother anyone (and nobody can bother him).

-These situations aren't ""out of nowhere"" or ""for no reason,"" he's doing it because he's scared. Read up on positive reinforcement training and better manage his environment.

23,"&gt;Was I correct to lock Rex with his bed and water in a smallish room, ignoring him following this?

No. Once the event is over, the dog has pretty much forgotten about it. Even if you were standing in your backyard when this happened, by the time you get him all locked up, he has long forgotten what's happened and has absolutely no idea why he's locked in a bathroom.

He also *doesn't* know he's done something wrong.

I think the biggest issue here is that you're staying and talking with these people. Once your dog reacts, he needs to be removed from the situation immediately. Hanging around the dog he's reacting towards, even if he seems calm, is only increasing his stress and you're getting closer and closer to that point where he will snap. You're also running the risk of him believing he *needs* to attack sooner if he wants the threat gone.

Predatory drift is also an issue in *terriers* (it's not solely a bully breed trait, as the other user wants you to believe. Any terrier, from a fox terrier to an Airedale is at a higher risk of being dog selective and exhibit predatory drift), in which the dog's prey drive is ""activated"" by smaller dogs, cats, etc., especially when they make yelping or squealing noises.

Get yourself a board certified veterinary behaviorist NOW. You need to begin working on creating positive associations with other dogs, working on reactivity, and learning how you should be managing your dog's quirks and environment. 

Do not let this dog around other dogs until you've spoken to a behaviorist (not a trainer).",2016-11-19 16:51:59+00:00,da73393,1.0,t3_5dt574,1884.0,Dogtraining
24,"It's an unnecessary way to train a dog to want to do something, IMO. [And that tactic can potentially be harmful]( http://clicktreat.blogspot.com/2012/06/is-it-harmful-to-attach-aleash-to-your.html?m=1).

It doesn't convey to your dog what he *should* be doing. In his doggy brain, he's doing what he's supposed to. He walking outside, exploring the world, and having fun. He doesn't know the exact thing he's doing wrong. This method teaches him to fear doing something wrong, but he doesn't have an idea of what actual rules he's supposed to follow.

By using rewards (treats, play, whatever motivates him the most), you're setting him up to continually practice rewarding behaviors. If you make walking on a loose leash super rewarding, and pulling unrewarding (he doesn't get to go where he wants to by pulling), he's much more likely to continue those rewarding behaviors.

Also, IMO, when it comes to training difficult behaviors (remember, walking nicely on a leash is very difficult for many dogs. It requires slowing down to our tortoise-like human speed and exercising impulse control), you should use whatever is the most rewarding for the dog. To conduct a class in a way that removes the most valuable reward for the majority of dogs is ridiculous. Dogs need to be set up for success, and that involves meeting them halfway. If you're going to require rules and structure, they need to see value in following those rules. When you have a notoriously independent breed mix, showing the dog the importance of listening to you is especially important. With independent breeds, if they know there's nothing in it for them (or the reward doesn't outweigh whatever other plans they have in their head), you're on the losing side of the battle.",2016-11-19 15:01:23+00:00,da6zcn9,1.0,t3_5dnryh,76110.0,Dogtraining

You can absolutely influence the behaviors the dog demonstrates, but you cannot change the underlying reaction by ignoring it, nor make it worse by addressing it with comfort. One of the things you're supposed to do when dealing with something like noise anxiety is to be a huge treat dispenser and just shell out treats for your dog to try to make the dog view the thunder as a sign of incoming treats. If I start dispensing treats like a madwoman while my dog is leaping around and barking his face off, I'm indirectly rewarding the jumping around and barking. But if I work up to only treating him when he's sitting quietly, I'm rewarding for his quiet response to the thunder.

Just as an arbitrary personal story, my dog is insanely afraid of loud noises. He washed out of gun dog training and is gun shy (I didn't train him, I adopted him after the breeder took him to a shelter). What helped him *tremendously* was to coddle him and show him I'm not scared and he's not dying. He used to pace, bark, try to force himself into small spaces looking for a ""den"" (his crate has never been good enough), and was just a fucking pain in the ass. But now we climb into bed and I spoon him until it's over. He's quiet, he's nervous but calm, and he only paces when things get *really* bad. If keeping my dog happy means I have to stop whatever I'm doing and go spoon him, whatever.

But you definitely won't harm your dog by soothing him/her :) ",2016-11-15 23:32:12+00:00,da1zkfh,6.0,t1_da1xqf5,2503.0,Dogtraining

54,"Yeah, unfortunately you've created a bark-quiet chain. In his mind, he's only getting the treat when he can trigger your command, so he barks. Give him the ""quiet"" command throughout the day, even if he's just sitting there. Reward each time. You'll also want to reward him for his silence whenever he's just hanging out and being quiet. It might seem like you're treating ""for no reason,"" but what you're actually doing is rewarding him for the silence you want to see. Reward him whenever he's doing what you do want him to do, even if he doesn't know he's doing it.",2016-11-15 22:47:35+00:00,da1xlm2,1.0,t3_5d4m0r,10697.0,Dogtraining
55,"I *mostly* agree with you, but here are a couple of things I'd like to comment on.

&gt;Your dog fights another dog for being in ""her"" bed? Remove her and the bed. She doesn't get to sit in the bed she wants.

Removing her from the thing she's guarding and removing ""her"" thing together can (and probably will, since this behavior is pretty ingrained) backfire and cause her to believe she needs to protect her things even more so. What should be done, until a professional can come in and instruct otherwise, is manage the environment so that the dog has *no reason* to guard these things. That means keep the other dogs out of the room and away from the bed. If there's nobody around to start raising those stress levels and get her feeling defensive over her things, she won't feel the need to guard them.

&gt;Have her sit on one side of the room and one of the other dogs on the other. Treat generously, verbally praise for calm sitting and looking at the other dog. If that is too much, put a barrier like a baby gate between them and try again. 

I believe /u/sweetromina should just avoid any conditioning until they have professional supervision. A professional needs to come in, evaluate the dog's threshold and triggers, and then start. If the dog is over threshold in the slightest, nothing will change, and that constant stress will just add to the problem.

&gt;Oh and do not try to soothe her when she's barking/acting up/being aggressive. This only reinforces the behavior. Ignore it instead.

The idea that you can reinforce fear is actually false. You cannot reinforce fear. Fear is an instinctual reaction to a stimulus, and that reaction needs to be changed. If soothing the dog is what gets her to start being more accepting of the stimulus, and its conditioning a different reaction to the stimulus, then its perfectly acceptable to soothe the dog.

If you're extremely afraid of spiders, and I bring one to you and tell you you're okay, you're doing fine, and there's nothing to worry about, will you become more afraid of the spider? No. If I put the spider on you and just stand by and watch you panic, you absolutely will become more afraid of that spider because you were left feeling defenseless, betrayed, and alone.

&gt;edit: oh and start video taping some of her behaviors. It can be helpful for the behaviorist without having to trigger the dog unnecessarily.

This part is very important, OP. Some behaviors will not occur with a stranger in your home, so you'll want to be able to show your behaviorist what is going on. Don't trigger her reactions on purpose just for the video, and obviously never put others in harm, but if you have someone with you who can record for you while you focus on controlling your dog, that will help a ton.",2016-11-15 22:27:02+00:00,da1wnd5,4.0,t1_da1p7dv,9008.0,Dogtraining

My initial belief is that this trainer uses things like shock or prong collars to stop the dog's reactions, but does not do anything to treat the underlying issue. But I'd have to see a website or something to be sure.

If you have a bad flu, and I give you medicine to combat the symptoms, does that mean your flu is gone? Absolutely not. You need to be treating your dog's underlying feelings in these situations and change the way she reacts to triggers. Aggression often stems from fear, so you want to show her that these things aren't scary.

Any prong/choke/shock collars, run the fuck away. Alpha rolling, establishing yourself as pack leader, or competing for dominance, walk away. It's bullshit, and those aggressive tactics will make things worse for you.

If you have fields you can walk through, or any plot of land she doesn't go to that you're able to walk on, take her there. She doesn't need to be in an actual park if there are other options. Let her run and sniff (on a long leash) if there are no dogs or people to encounter. 

Amp up her mental stimulation. Get some interactive puzzle toys for her and start working on nosework. I know you're probably very busy with a young child, but your dog needs at least 1-2 hours of your direct attention. Kick the other dogs out of the room, and hide treats around for her to find (get the baby out of the room just in case). Get her using her brain as often as possible. Freeze her meals in a Kong and let her quietly eat it in her crate without the other dogs even watching her. If she doesn't like being locked in the crate, start properly crate training her (there's a TON of information in the sidebar and wiki).

It's also important that you do not hire anyone who uses punishment. Punishment and aggressive training tactics WILL make things worse for you. Her behavior needs to be *modified*, and it isn't just trained away.

It sounds like a lack of exercise is severely hindering you, too. When you get a professional, you will HAVE to figure out how to exercise her well (I haven't read through other comments on here, so I don't know if you've mentioned her exercise further). Running around the yard is NOT exercise, and it is NOT mental stimulation. If anything, it's simply just stressful. If she's constantly on edge, ready to fight other dogs, she's too stressed to form any positive associations with others.

It sounds like you have resource guarding issues, as well. Do not leave food or toys around, ever.

Bring a good behaviorist in to observe your dog, especially in the way she interacts with your son. Just because she's aggressive with dogs and strangers does not mean she'll attack your son, but you need a professional to come in and help you.

98,"You've gotten good answers, but I just wanted to chime in with something I realized with my current dog (and I'm not trying to deter you, but I believe it's important to think about if you haven't already).

In my opinion, when it comes to high energy dogs (like you seem to be used to), there are those that are ""easy"" to exercise, and those that are more difficult.

For example, my high energy GSP is ""difficult"" to exercise because he can't be let off leash, doesn't give a shit about fetch or flirt poles, and gets bored on jogs.

IMO, something like a border collie is traditionally ""easier"" to exercise, because they're often so handler focused. Fetch, frisbee, training...they're all fun and exciting for collies.

Most malamutes will fall into my (broad) category of ""difficult."" They're very independent dogs. 

So, just think about that since it'll be so, so important to keep the dog well exercised and mentally stimulated, especially when your nephew comes over.

Also check out the wiki to read up on basic training. It sounds like your methods (popping him on the nose) are a little outdated. Independent dogs don't take well to punishment. You have to make them enjoy working with you, otherwise they'll blow you off. Punishment will not make him like working with you.

101,"You're really fighting a losing battle here.

Here's something important to understand: **she doesn't know she's done anything bad**. Her guilty looks are appeasement behavior. She's saying to you, essentially, ""Look how sad and pathetic I look. Don't be mad at me."" She doesn't understand *why* you're mad, only that you're mad. She's come to learn that when you walk back in the door, you're mad, but what she doesn't (and will never) understand that you're mad because of an action she performed a long time ago (in doggy minds, you have a matter of just a couple of seconds for them to connect behavior and result).

Going through the garbage and counter surfing will always be rewarding as long as she's able to do these things. Cakes and bones are fucking delicious, and as long as those things are around, there's no reason for her to stop.

You HAVE to play the management game. Things need to be put away. Nothing left on the counters, garbage behind a closed door. Otherwise, she needs to be crated or securely contained away from these areas. But if there's nothing for her to get, there's nothing to reward.

112,"&gt;Those are the most trained dogs on earth, and they aren't coddled with positive reinforcement at all. 

As a matter of fact, police and military trainers are beginning to use positive reinforcement instead of punishment-based training (they don't alpha roll their dogs, either, even when they are trained with aversives) because it *works*. Breeding, raising, and training a working dog is *expensive*, and so, so many burn out and don't make it through the system because of harsh training. When you use positive reinforcement, fewer dogs wash out of the system.

It isn't coddling, it's psychology. It's proven to be more effective than dominance and force based training.

There simply is no human-dog battle for dominance. Wolves don't do it, dogs don't do it. Do your research. You're literally traumatizing your dog for nothing when things could be so damn easy with positive reinforcement training.",2016-11-03 23:12:04+00:00,d9kph1q,5.0,t1_d9klmxt,5172.0,Dogtraining

124,"You cannot actually reinforce fear. Fear is an emotional response. What you can do is change that emotional response through conditioning.

What worked for me and my dog's fear of thunderstorms/fireworks was to in fact baby him. Most of our storms here happen in the middle of the night, so he would start barking, pacing, getting on and off the bed, and just doing a fantastic job of keeping me up. I realized that when I was able to get him to settle down and lay with me, he calmed down when I spooned him. After a lot of practice and encouragement, his automatic response to storms is to come to me so I spoon him. He's still scared, but calmer, and his fear reaction is no longer to pace, bark, and freak out. It's now spoon and wait for it to end. 

I would try two things.

One, if cooking does not require two people, one of you go play your dog's favorite game, or even just get him out on a walk. My dog's favorite game is tug of war, and he LOVES destroying fabrics, so when I know there's a storm or fireworks coming, I'll have a stockpile of old shirts ready for him to tear up. During the scary event, we just play endless tug of war. It keeps him distracted, and it makes the scary event less scary.

Two, have a Kong frozen with something super, ultra high value ready and waiting in the freezer. Whenever you're about to start cooking, give him the Kong and let him work on it quietly elsewhere. Again, keeping him distracted.

You should also take care to never correct the dog or establish yourself as alpha. Dominance theory is based on a very outdated and discredited study of wolves that has since been retracted by the researcher. Even wolves do not establish dominance in that way. There is no need to try to be alpha, and doing so can actually cause way more harm than good.

Edit: It's important to remember that the dog is only doing what it was bred to do. He's a guardian breed, and is only doing what is instinctual.

You need to find an amazing trainer or board certified veterinary behaviorist to work with you. It will cost money, but think of it as an investment. If you don't spend the money on essentially prevention training now, you're looking at spending a ton of money on lengthy and difficult behavioral adjustment training later (which, in all likelihood, would require an expensive behaviorist). 

You need to separate these dogs NOW. They each need to be trained, raised, and exist as if they were each adopted by different homes. Separate vet visits, training sessions, play sessions, feeding times, socialization sessions, etc.

But it takes more than a generation or two to really weed out the genetic problems you'll encounter. You also have to consider genetic issues that don't appear until later in a dog's life. It's really too soon for anyone to be breeding a genetically sound designer breed.

And even then, you have to find someone willing to compromise their favored breed's standards to create designer dogs. And, let's be honest, there isn't really any benefit to 99% of the combinations out there, so what's the benefit to the dog or breeder to spend time breeding designer dogs when you could be spending time breeding healthy dogs of your preferred breed?

With all the severe health issues (and more and more behavioral issues) cropping up in popular breeds, like Goldens, there's no responsible benefit to going on to breed Goldendoodles. A breeder that truly cares about the breed would want to breed dogs without the genetic disposition for cancer, allergies, or behavioral issues.

Does that make sense? I'm having a tough time phrasing what I'm trying to say haha

This is resource guarding, and the shepard's reaction will only continue to get worse as the situation goes unaddressed. The dogs need to be fed separately, in different rooms, and food and toys need to be put away when they're in the same room.

These can't *really* be trained away without a lot very intense training (to the point where it's not even worth it in a lot of cases), but what you can do is make these movements and noises normal.

It sounds weird, but if she does more squealing, ducking, whatever more often in front of the dog (with him on a leash, at a distance, and you rewarding with high value treats for calm behavior), you'll make the weird triggers less exciting for the dog, so he'll react less and to a lower degree.

307,"I think it mostly comes from this idea that you need well trained dogs. And we look to movies and police/military dogs for the definition of ""well trained."" Well trained can me whatever you want it to mean.

My dog pulls like an ox on the leash, and after 4 years of training I've just given up. But he's still well trained to me. He doesn't destroy the house, doesn't chase the cats, knows how to settle down when I tell him to, and knows how to ask for attention/food without being annoying. That's fine by me.

But then people build unrealistic expectations for some dogs. I'm sorry, but it'll take a monumental amount of time and effort to have a husky that's reliable off leash. Don't set the bar so high.

But *that's* when people think they need the fast, painful methods. They think ""my husky defies me and doesn't come when called, so I need to teach him to come *or else*."" That's nothing more than being a bully and expecting way too much out of an animal.

Add in the e collar and their method of training, and your dog will be even more stressed out, and you'll destroy any progress you've made. 

Dogs don't understand punishment as precisely as we do. Say you're out on a walk and your dog starts lunging, barking, growling, and snarling at the sight of another dog. For humans, we want the shock to mean ""stop doing all these things."" But for the dog, the meaning can be anything from ""I experienced pain, this dog must cause pain, other dogs are bad"" to ""stop pulling"" to ""a red car passed at the exact moment I felt pain. Red cars are bad, too."" They don't have the ability to understand exactly what the message is, so they can only make their own associations.

First, I *highly* suggest you find yourself a good positive reinforcement trainer in your area. You can find trainers near you on APDT.com and clickertraining.com. You definitely need a professional to help you with your reactivity problems (information in the wiki).

Pulled from the [posting guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/guidelines) within our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/) (I recommend you read through both):

""[Dominance theory](http://www.apdt.com/petowners/choose/dominance.aspx) has been discounted and should not be used as a basis for making decisions about dog behaviour or training, so [forget about being alpha in your pack](http://www.kathysdao.com/articles/forget-about-being-alpha-in-your-pack/).""

""We do not support [positive punishment](http://psychology.about.com/od/operantconditioning/f/positive-punishment.htm) to control or train dogs. Prohibited methods and tools include shock collars, prong/pinch collars, choke collars, leash checks, spray bottles, spray collars, alpha rolls, hitting, kicking, and invisible fencing. Our stance on positive punishment collars can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/prongandecollars).""

Dominance theory is a very old school method that has since been discredited and shown to be much less effective than positive reinforcement training. The study that ""proved"" dominance theory is based on a study of a group of unrelated, unfamiliar captive wolves. In natural environments, wolves exist much more similarly to the way human society does: two parents are in charge of the children. Eventually, the children leave to find mates and start their own packs. There is no fight for dominance. Even **if** dogs fought for dominance, dogs know we are not dogs.

Prong collars are also problematic because they don't actually *teach* your dog anything. The most effective dog training comes from you teaching the dog what they *should* do. All a prong collar (or similar tool) does is give them some general idea of what they shouldn't do. But should your dog not bark? Not lunge? Not pull? Not sit? Not wag her tail? You're not communicating anything significant. 

Even if the prong collar did end up working for you, take it away and it's very likely that you'd be right back where you started, because the dog wasn't actually taught how she should behave. 

Before starting any training, you need to make sure your dog is being exercised and mentally stimulated. A walk is not good enough. Get a flirt pole and get her running. Start clicker training and teach her new tricks. Ditch the food bowl and only feed her meals out of puzzle toys, frozen Kongs, or through training. A tired dog is a good dog, and a energized dog cannot focus long enough to learn anything.   

Yelling will not help you. Hitting, alpha rolling, scruffing, etc. will not help you. You need to take the time to show her how she should behave. And it *will* take some time. This takes a lot of effort on your part, but it will pay off big time in the long run.

Head over to YouTube and check out Zak George and Kikopup. They both have a TON of training videos. Their methods differ slightly, so pick the one that works best for you.

If your main goal is to have a companion for your other dog, don't get another dog. In my experience, when you're gone, the dogs will mostly ignore eachother. If separation anxiety is a problem, the other dog can also develop it after watching the anxious dog panic for hours. Dogs don't need the companionship of another dog as long as you're meeting their basic needs. Some dogs *can't* be in the presence of other dogs, and can still live absolutely happy lives.

Female-female aggression is not uncommon. To be safe, you're better off going with opposite sexes. Make sure both are spayed/neutered.

2 dogs means 2x the amount of food, toys, exercise, vet bills, grooming (if applicable). It will also suck up more of your time. You'll have to spent time training the new dog (away from the first dog), and the change has the potential to cause a regression in training in your first dog, so you'll want to address that.

Poodles are incredibly smart dogs, which means you have to outsmart them. When she's barking, you need to treat her for every moment of silence, not just after she becomes quiet after barking. If that means feeding her treats continuously for 5 minutes, that's what you need to do. Better yet, pull her attention away from the window and engage her in a game, *fun* training, or give her a puzzle toy to work on.

Dogs bark because it's fun and relieves stress and boredom. It's self reinforcing. To end the barking, you have to relieve the boredom. Getting mad at her won't solve that. You need to be proactive, and devise a plan with your family members to make sure she's being cared for. If your kids are capable of feeding her, they're capable of running around with her. 

Show your kids how to do training sessions with her. Teach them clicker training. Have them watch Zak George on YouTube (I think he's engaging enough to keep young minds interested).

Yeah, just keep rewarding. You can also try to be quicker with your rewards. If you're using a food reward for recall, have it ready and just toss it to him as soon as he gets there. Don't turn it into a process of ""come"" &gt; ""good boy!"" &gt; reward. Shorten the sequence. ""Come"" &gt; ""Good boy!"" + Reward/affection/treats

I hope that makes sense.

427,"&gt;I can get him to come to me sometimes on command but if he does he quickly runs away right after.

Recall/""come"" is a VERY hard behavior to train. It takes months to years to train, depending on the dog.

It's entirely possible he's trying to play (many dogs like to play chasing games. though don't do this yet), or he thinks you're about to pick him up, which you already know he doesn't like. 

For now, reward him for coming to you. Every single time. You can add in other requirements later (no reward until he stays, no reward until he sits next to you, etc.). Don't try to add too many requirements at once. You have to build on the behavior.

&gt;I also notice that when im not looking or i'm out of the room when his crate is open that he comes out but when i re enter the room or get closer to him he quickly runs back into his crate.

This is completely normal. He's still nervous, and is just exploring his new environment. His crate is his safe space. Just let him do his doggy thing and you'll find him more comfortable around you eventually.

&gt;I tried some things allready for the leash and picking him up but that hasnt helped as of yet

These things take time and will not happen overnight. You're moving too quickly. 

&gt;How long does it usually take for dogs to not be really scared anymore of their new owner(s)?

It really depends on the dog. My dog was comfortable with us after about 2 weeks, but didn't fully settle in until about 3 months. Just give it time.

&gt;Also when im outside for example or indoors but dont have any toys, is it okay for me to firmly say ""no"" when he does something i dont like?

Some people on this subreddit believe a firm ""no"" is okay, others believe it is not okay. I'm in the ""not okay"" group, especially with a new and nervous dog.

Teach a [positive interrupter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBvPaqMZyo8) instead.

&gt;Well he just started chewing on the blanket thats over his crate and right when i look he stops but i can see he chewed on it.

Does the blanket need to be there? It's not absolutely mandatory to cover the crate with a blanket. It helps some dogs, but if he's chewing it, you might be better off without it. 

Is he only chewing it during the day? If so, remove the blanket during the day. 

When you catch him chewing on something he shouldn't be, get low to the ground (small dogs don't like people towering over them), get excited, call him to you, and play with the toy with him. Play tug of war, fetch, whatever he likes to play. Make that toy (or chew toy) more exciting than whatever he was previously chewing on, and calmly remove the item you don't want him chewing.",2016-07-03 17:22:44+00:00,d4xtyhm,13.0,t1_d4xt3ni,1461.0,Dogtraining

Do not force him to do anything. The leash is causing problems, so take it off (what are you attempting to accomplish? You can probably train it differently). Also make sure you put *everything* that you don't want the dog to have away. Shoes, leashes, garbage...act as if you're baby proofing your home. Anything you don't want the puppy to have needs to be put away. Make sure your son understands this, too.

You have a mix of two breeds that are known to be *very* mouthy during play. He needs to be taught [bite inhibition](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/nipping).

You may find that these issues clear up once he settles in to your home, but you also need to change your training approach. Forcing him to do anything will only make things worse. You've had him for two days and he's terrified. Don't make it worse.

This isn't something that can be solved in 5 days, but if you give him space and address his issues properly, you should definitely see some small improvement in 5 days.

Make sure your son understands to stay away from him for a little while. Just let the dog figure out his new world without being bothered. 

You should also seek the help of a professional, **always** one that uses positive reinforcement.

445,"You can use his regular dog food as training treats for the easier tricks (sit, down...anything in low distraction environments). In fact, I suggest not feeding out of a bowl and just feeding through small training sessions throughout the day. When it comes to harder things (walking on a loose leash, recall, etc.) use high value treats, like hot dogs, cheese, or boiled chicken. Anything he goes crazy for. But, like I said, he may just still be a little scared and unwilling to eat something that isn't high value (regular dog food is pretty boring).

With the toys, he might simply be too scared to play yet. It also takes more than just simply showing them to him. Get a variety of toys (plush, squeaky, crinkly, hard, soft, etc.) and make them exciting by playing with them yourself. Keep low to the ground so you're not towering over him.

For being picked up, many dogs don't like this. In your reading, you'll learn about counter conditioning. You'll want to apply this to teach your dog to accept being handled, but avoid picking him up unless you absolutely have to. You can even start training commands to get him to do the things that you'd normally pick him up for (I taught mine ""jump"" for jumping onto/into different areas).

And as far as a training class goes, it's more for teaching YOU how to teach your dog. The trainer will honestly have very little direct interaction with your dog. It's all about having an outside observer watching and guiding you. But if a trainer truly isn't an option/desire for you, post some videos of your training sessions and we can help point out some things you're doing well and some things you can be doing differently. I personally consider myself pretty knowledgable about dog training, but I still catch myself doing things wrong while training my dog. 

Don't be so hard on yourself. Things will be stressful while both of you warm up to eachother. Things will get easier for each of you as time goes on. For now, keep things simple.

Dog training takes effort, but it's really not so hard once you have a strong understanding of how dogs think and operate. 

Keep in mind, you've only had him a week. It usually takes dogs 2-3 months to fully feel comfortable in their new environment. He could be comfortable enough to start accepting treats in a week, or it may take a month. If a dog is stressed, they usually do not accept food.

Food also isn't the only way to train, it's just often the easiest reward. But I actually live with a chihuahua who LOVES play, so I've been doing a lot of his training with play as a reward. 

Make sure to also check out kikopup, tab289, and Zak George on YouTube as visual examples will help you a lot.

But do not expect to be an expert dog trainer overnight, just as you cannot expect perfectly trained behaviors overnight. It's takes a lot of time for both, and some are much harder than others.

I highly recommend getting into a positive reinforcement class. APDT.com and clickertraining.com both have a search tool to help you find trainers in your area. If you'd like, and if you're in the US, PM me your zip code and I can pick a few good ones out for you.

It's a challenge, but stay positive and calm and you can do it. If either of you begin to get frustrated at all, end on a good note. Once you figure things out, dog training can become a ton of fun :)

Well, think about it. He trusts you're not going to hurt him, but maybe he doesn't trust your girlfriend. One thing you can do is to get her much more involved in his training, exercise, and general care. I highly recommend getting the three of you signed up for a clicker training class, even if he knows everything. It'll help build a strong bond between the two of them, and help to make sure all three of you are on the same page. 

A trainer will also help you evaluate these situations (though definitely seek out a certified veterinary behaviorist if things get worse). You can find a trainer on APDT.com and clickertraining.com.

(From your original post)

&gt;He quickly growled and did a short, low bark as he thrashed his head and open mouth toward her. She was laying next to him, so he made forceful contact with her face

Obviously I wasn't there to see it, so correct me if I'm wrong, but to me that sounds like he was just close to her face, so sort of hit her in the motions. My dog does this to me all the time (he's a klutz), so that's just what I assumed happened. If so, that's really just incidental. If not, remember that he still could have done actual damage to her and chose not to. That's still actually a good thing.

&gt;Maybe this is simply not possible, but in that type of situation I'd like to train him never to be aggressive at all.

Our definitions of aggression differ her. For me, true aggression means the dog is going to do what he can to actually injure you. Your dog did not do that. Your dog communicated his discomfort, which he is allowed to do. As he gets more comfortable, you may see his communication relax a bit. ",2016-07-01 02:37:14+00:00,d4uut5h,,t1_d4u5r3v,,Dogtraining

Dog training is a completely unregulated field. *Anyone* can just start marketing themselves as dog trainers. That means that you have some trainers that have uneducated experience, some with educated experience, and some with neither. When choosing a trainer, look for one that's certified with an organization like CPDT or KPA. Clickertraining.com and APDT.com have search tools to help you find one in your area.

Sorry your experience here has been negative. I promise we're not always grumps. Just keep an open mind, don't argue when presented with information (civil questioning and conversation is fine!), and make an effort to understand your dog and you shouldn't have any problems :)

484,"First, dominance theory (which is what I'm 95% sure is what you're hinting at) has been discredited. The original researcher has even retracted his theory and is now a positive reinforcement trainer. You do not have to worry about establishing yourselves as leaders, and you do not have to worry about him claiming the bed as his or dominating you. It's all bullshit.

In fact, if you happen to be using any dominance theory techniques like alpha rolling or grabbing him by the scruff, you're making your situation much, much worse. Aggression is always met with aggression, whether that happens right away or builds up over time depends on the dog.

Now, it's also important to remember that any dog can and will snap at you. We don't like it, and it's best that it doesn't become a normal occurrence, but its a form of communication. It's his way of saying, ""Hey, I don't like what you're doing and you're REALLY pushing my buttons.""

But you know what he did despite your girlfriend pushing his buttons? He restrained himself. Think about it. A dog that size can easily kill someone, but all he did was warn her. That's exactly what you want! You want him growling and even giving a quick warning snap instead of immediately jumping to biting. NEVER punish any of these early warning signs. Sure, in an ideal world he'd just growl instead of snapping, but as a rescue dog (I'm assuming) he may have previously been punished for growling, so he thinks this is how he has to get his message across. Do not make him feel the need to progress to the next step, which would be biting. 

Now, any number of things could have happened here.

He could have simply felt uncomfortable with what was happening (look up dog body language. I almost guarantee he was throwing around early signs that you didn't pick up on).

He could have been asleep and she scared him.

Or he's resource guarding (but then you'd be seeing the behavior much more often). 

Decide if you want him sleeping on the bed or not. If not, start teaching him to sleep elsewhere. If so, start making a habit of calmly asking him to get off before you try to readjust the blankets. Then call him back up. Train him to only get on the bed with permission. ",2016-06-30 14:57:35+00:00,d4u0oa1,1.0,t3_4qlyq2,1577.0,Dogtraining
485,"Shar peis are independent dogs and they're NOT a very affectionate breed. This isn't an easy going lab. Check out the book [When Pigs Fly](https://www.amazon.com/When-Pigs-Fly-Training-Impossible/dp/1929242441/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1467297303&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=when+pigs+fly).

Get the notion of ""ignoring me because he doesn't respect me"" out of your head. He's ignoring you because it's more beneficial for *him* to do other things. Those independent dogs are often the most intelligent. They know how to do things that benefit them. Chewing on things is fun. Counter surfing yields food and good smells. Jumping up on things grants both of these.

You need to look at it less as ""how do I correct bad behavior?"" and more as ""How do I set my dog up for success?"" Because, as someone with an independent dog, I can *promise* you, any corrections, even only mildly negative like a strong ""NO,"" will have your dog thinking ""Well, I want to do this thing that's way more fun than whatever Windfish wants, so...yeah, I'm going to go ahead and do this thing. Probably when they're not looking, too.""

So, the most effective ways to set your dog up for success is managing the environment, training incompatible behaviors, and ignoring bad behaviors.

**Managing the environment**: If your dog is counter surfing, you can do a couple of things. First, *never* leave food out on the counters or tables. Put everything away behind cabinets and closed doors. This also means clean up after yourself(s) and do not leave crumbs. Second, you can also use baby gates to block off unsupervised access to the kitchen. Or you can do both. 

**Training incompatible behaviors**: You want to train and proof behaviors that make it impossible for your dog to perform bad behaviors. For example, if your dog jumps on guests, train a strong ""sit."" Your dog cannot jump on guests and sit at the same time.

**Ignoring bad behaviors**: This does *not* mean, ""Ignore the dog while it's getting into the garbage."" This means ignore any bad behaviors where the reward is your attention or access to something else, like the yard. If your dog is barking at you for food or attention, you have to 100% ignore him until he stops because even the *slightest* interaction, even if it's you yelling at him, rewards him. His barking got your attention. 

So you have to adjust your mindset a little. Your dog is just being a dog. He's doing things because it benefits him, not because he lacks respect or because he's trying to spite you. You have to *earn* an obedient dog, and corrections of any kind will not allow that.",2016-06-30 14:45:52+00:00,d4u05dx,1.0,t3_4qlveg,1937.0,Dogtraining

515,"I think you're worrying about a problem that doesn't even exist.

Should you just drop your baby in front of your dog and walk away? Absolutely not. No small child should *ever* be left unsupervised with any dog, even Lassie. 

But is your dog going to kill your baby because it has a strong prey drive? Probably not. Even dogs with *extreme* prey drives understand what's a human and what isn't.

You also need to make sure your dog is being properly exercised. It sounds like your dog is burning off energy in ways you don't like.

And your dog isn't giving you dirty looks. It's all in your head. You're seeing what you want to see because you're expecting this dog to go ballistic any day now. 

Either seriously find professional help for both you and the dog (a positive reinforcement trainer and a therapist), or rehome the dog to a breed specific rescue group.

You can't just get a dog that would fit in your life, you'd also have to consider what would fit in their lives), or you'd just have a bored and lonely dog sitting at home waiting for the dog walker to come by again.

Dogs are incredibly social animals. These are little lives with needs. What you're pretty much looking for is a toy for your days off. Any *good* breeder and any good shelter probably would not give you a dog with this schedule.

Dogs don't understand punishment like we do. You have a matter of a couple of *seconds* to punish him effectively. To be honest, properly punishing a dog is much harder than it sounds, and it's much easier (and much more effective) to set your dog up for success and reward him for the good things you do like.

Setting him up for success in this case would be crate training. He can't do the wrong thing if he doesn't have the ability to tear up the carpet.

Anytime anyone needs a trainer, both on Reddit and in real life, I tell them to go to APDT.com and clickertraining.com to find a trainer. You get certified, and you get on those sites. YouTube has millions of channels, and dog training isn't a popular enough topic to get you noticed. YouTubers like Zak George and kikopup established themselves before joining YouTube. 

As for the breed, that's entirely dependent on your lifestyle. If you're busy and/or not very active, most of those breeds would be pretty miserable. There's also no reason you can't go with a rescue that has an established personality (foster families would be able to tell you if a dog has any quirks.

One (minor) thing I look at when looking at trainers is what kind of dogs they own. If it's all border collies, that's cool, but that doesn't tell me they have experience working with a more difficult breed. If they own hounds or something more independent, then I know they're likely to have enough experience to work with my extremely independent dog.

/r/dogs has a breed questionnaire you can fill out to match you with the right breed.

Edit: Also, a Beligian shepherd/malinois is too much for most people. I know highly experienced trainers that would never own one.

I only got my DSLR last week (D5500). Before choosing that camera, I lurked this sub, Googled, sat in the library reading photography books, and watched *hours* of YouTube videos. For every article saying the D3300 is the best entry DSLR, there's another saying you should buy a Canon. For every ""buy a Canon/Nikon"" article, there's something saying you should consider buying a Sony. You read a million reviews nitpicking about autofocus points, touch screens, wifi, weatherproofing, get one with features/don't get one with features. Then you have to consider accessories like straps and bags. You come here, and you read, ""Just get one you like/your friend has/looks cool."" By the time you get set to buy one, your head is exploding.

Photography isn't an easy hobby, and it's definitely not a cheap hobby. 

And there are other subs to ask questions on, sure. But many are dead, or you'll get one or two responses. Why post in an unhelpful sub?

Nah, not really. Unless the border collie is antagonizing the husky, or the husky reacts to dogs that are off leash. But if your dog minds his own business, and the husky is enjoying himself, there isn't a problem. 

You can even get the husky a longer leash (I use 15 feet for hiking/trails). But use a harness, as a dog can easily injure its neck or even strangle itself on long leashes.",2016-06-20 00:23:13+00:00,d4fyyxq,3.0,t1_d4fy06e,1591.0,Dogtraining

576,"Most dogs actually do not do well in dog parks. There's no actual need for a dog to be in a dog park.

It's most likely prey drive causing the husky to go after small dogs. It's not uncommon, and it's not something you can change since its instinctual.

Huskies are also notorious for being escape artists and having poor recall. It's pretty unrealistic to expect a husky to be good off leash.

If we're comparing the two dogs, your border collie is one of the most biddable (willing to work with you) breeds out there, and huskies are one of the most independent. It's unfair to attempt to try to gain the same behaviors your border collie might display (good off leash, easily trained, focused on you, etc.)

So, there's no reason to be in the dog park (*especially* not if the dog isn't good with other dogs), and there's not a whole lot you can do to change his reaction to small dogs.

578,"For me, it's because I've had a lot of stupid bugs and glitches to deal with on every single Windows (and android) machine/device I've ever used in my life, and it's rare for me to have a major issue with an Apple product. The worst thing I ever had happen with an Apple product was the ambient light sensor on my 4S died, but I replaced it myself without a problem.

I don't care about specs. I don't care about which device has better apps available. I want to pay for something that works for me, and that I trust to last me a few years.

My SO and I bought laptops at the same exact time when we started college a few years ago. I got a MacBook Pro, he got a Dell Latitude. Mine was only about $200 more expensive than his (his was loaded with all the bells and whistles). His Dell was pretty much useless after about 2 years, whereas my Pro was still running beautifully. Now he's using my 3 year old MacBook Air while his Dell is collecting dust.

So, *for me*, it's a matter of paying more up front, but holding onto the device for much longer. I know that my iMac will last me years. I know that I can go buy a first gen iPad Pro in a couple of years and STILL have that last me a couple more years.

584,"The Kelpie is a herding and working breed. This means the dog needs a job to do, lots of exercise, and lots of mental stimulation. Without meeting those needs, a Kelpie becomes an out of control, neurotic mess.

Which is what you're seeing.

He needs way more exercise. He needs to be running. Jogging, biking, hiking, whatever. He needs more strenuous exercise (check with your vet before starting any intense exercise). Then he also needs some mental stimulation and a job to do. Ever see those border collies, Belgian malinois, and Australian shepherds that do crazy tricks that seem impossible to train? Your dog is made for that. Pick up a clicker, learn how to use it, and start training everything from basic obedience to weird and crazy tricks.

But the key is to exercise the dog before attempting training. A dog cannot properly learn if he has too much energy. It would be like giving a four year old a pot of coffee and then expecting them to learn how to read quietly. It cannot and will not happen.

And the both of you have to dedicate time to this dog. Stop comparing your two dogs, and just focus on addressing the needs of each. Your small dog will probably be content after a long walk or two. Awesome. Then you can take your kelpie on a bike ride without having to worry about the other. 

The both of you also need to both be active and consistent in the kelpie's training. If you're the only one to train, the dog will only listen to you. 

You should also try to find an experienced *positive reinforcement* trainer. Bonus points if they use a clicker, but you can use one even if they don't. (Clicker training is a form of marker training, which pretty much all positive reinforcement trainers will use)

614,"&gt;He tries to pee around the house

This means he isn't house trained. It's also important to note that whenever you bring a dog into a new home, they tend to ""forget"" house training. They don't understand that the ""don't pee in the house"" rule applies to wherever they go unless they've had experience being in multiple houses. So, if a major priority for you is adopting a house trained dog, that's not really a thing. You will almost certainly have a few messes to clean up until he understands. [Here's how to house train](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/housetraining). Do NOT startle him, punish him, or rub his nose in it. 

&gt;I know they pee a lot more since their bladder is smaller.

Not really. Their bladders are smaller, but they also produce less pee. It all scales down. I live with a chihuahua now, and he could definitely last 8 hours if he ever needed to.

&gt;I plan to keep him in the crate while I'm at work and was hoping to have a pee pad

This is problematic for two reasons.

One, pee pads teach dogs that it's acceptable to pee in the house. If he's even remotely house trained, you're setting him up for a ton of confusion, and you're setting him up for failure.

Two, you should never encourage a dog to pee where it sleeps. Crate training is a huge part of house breaking for a lot of people. What you'd be doing is encouraging him to pee wherever he wants, regardless of where he sleeps. That means your bed, his crate, your couch, and wherever he feels like it.

Seriously, just take the dog outside. On days you can't get home to him, call up a trusted friend or dog walker to take him out. Find a dog walker now, and hire them for those busy days. Or even just a trusted neighborhood kid. 

Not using pee pads will make your life a hell of a lot easier. If you look back through this sub and check out any post asking about house training, you'll find a lot of them are dogs that were originally trained on pads, and now they're going everywhere in the house. Because the dog has learned that he's allowed to eliminate on any soft, porous surface. I strongly advise against them.",2016-06-16 16:13:39+00:00,d4bqt3j,1.0,t3_4oe1ha,1001.0,Dogtraining

637,"Head over to /r/dogs and fill out the breed questionnaire to see what kinds of breeds would be good for you. Do not get a specific breed based on looks. A husky will be absolutely *miserable* in your current situation, and you'll be even more miserable with all the howling, barking, destruction, and insanity you'll have to deal with. Pretty much all of the breeds you mentioned are huge barkers, and that will get much worse if the dog is left alone all day.

Pee pads teach a dog that its acceptable to pee inside. Do not use these.

You work schedule is pushing a dog's limits a bit. A healthy adult dog can hold it for 8-ish hours, but waiting nearly 9 hours (adding in your commute time) is really pushing it. You would almost have to hire someone, even just a trusted neighbor kid, to let your dog out midway through the day. 

I also understand being turned off by the idea of a dog walker because expenses add up so quickly, but dogs are a huge financial commitment. With your schedule, that's really something to strongly consider, and if that's already off the table, then a dog isn't right for you at this time. Obesity, destruction, and cleaning your floors will also add up in the long run, so either way, you're paying for that dog. 

But my opinion is that, no, this is not the right time for a dog. You have all your lives to get a dog. Wait until your living situation allows for one.

Edit: Trust me. I was in your position where my SO and I were dead set on getting a dog despite living in an apartment. We didn't do our research, and fell in love with a dog at the shelter. We were told he was low energy for his breed (GSP), and they were SO wrong. We've made it work, but it is hard. We don't get to go out like we want to because we have to be home for the dog. We can't just leave whenever we want, because we have to make sure the dog is exercised first. We don't have money to spend on fun stuff because it all goes to the dog (and student loans...ugh). He has noise anxiety, so we don't get to have fun on July 4 or other ""noisy"" holidays, and we have to watch the weather forecast as if its our religion, so we can be home to take care of the dog.

A dog is like a child. Its needs will always surmount your own. You're young, you're in a fun city (I creeped on you a bit. Sorry XP), and you have your whole life in front of you. Enjoy it while you can.",2016-06-15 14:59:06+00:00,d4a89r0,1.0,t3_4o7nsm,678.0,Dogtraining

I'm a beginner too, but one thing I keep reading over and over again is to really play around with where you're orienting the subject of your image. Not only follow the ""rule of thirds,"" but just try things other than centering your subject.

For example, in your skyline image, the tallest building is off to the right. To me, it looks really good because the most noticeable part of the image isn't dead center.

With Sileo, you have to give it 30 minutes to 1 hour before the storm starts, and then you can give an additional dose every 2-3 hours (I *think* for 2 more doses), which is kind of crappy if you're at work, or not expecting something like fireworks.

720,"At no point did anyone say operant conditioning doesn't exist, or that it has no influence on dog training. 

But the most effective and humane dog/animal training uses positive reinforcement and negative punishment. 

Your anecdotal evidence about your intact dog doesn't offer much. You simply have an untrained dog.

There's a whole movement in the hunting community to try to push for force free training. And these dogs are much more successful, and you see far fewer dogs washing out of the program. You can even get formerly gun shy dogs hunting again. You cannot do that with positive punishment/negative reinforcement.

Even the highest drive breeds can thrive with positive reinforcement. There are working malinois and German Shepards used in the military and police force that were trained force-free. Again, fewer dogs washing out of the system.

Altering a dog doesn't remove drive or change a dog's personality. It simply decreases it's hormonal response to its environment.

For my senior thesis in college (psych degree) I wrote about modern dog training and researched its efficacy. My professor emailed me a few months later and said I had a huge positive impact on his relationship with his dog because he changed from positive punishment to positive reinforcement. The dog's breed? A vizsla.

Dominance theory has been debunked, and holds no scientific value, really. The original researcher is now a positive reinforcement trainer. 

Dogs/wolves do have social structures, but it's not a snarling, violent affair. Either way, dogs know we are not dogs. They do not try to dominate us. Dogs are opportunists. What we see as them trying to ""dominate us"" is really just a dog doing his dog thing to get what benefits him.

And dominance theory training techniques are nothing but harmful. At absolute best, they're confusing and an ineffective way to teach anything.

761,"&gt;what could we have done better in this situation?

I would strongly consider gating off your kitchen (I'm assuming you spilled in the kitchen) since food is usually the number 1 guarded resource, and that's where food exists. Any dropped food becomes fair game, so it's best to limit his access to the whole room, especially when cooking or eating.

Is there anything that can be stuffed in a Kong and frozen for events like this (where he just will not leave something alone) that is the king of all treats? Something like canned cat food or tuna? If you can find something he absolutely loses his mind over that he rarely gets, figure out how to freeze it in a Kong, and keep it in your freezer for those moments you need him gone.

Crate training would also help, if you haven't already. You can put him in there while you clean/cook/eat.

&gt;is there an appropriate punishment for this or is there nothing we can really do? 

Not really. Dogs don't understand punishment the same way we do. And if you punish guarding, you're telling him there is a reason he should be protecting his valuables. You want him to see you more like someone he can trust not to take his things, not someone who punishes and then takes stuff. The most effective training involves rewarding good behaviors, and managing/redirecting/ignoring the bad behaviors.

Also, as part of your training, be sure to return items to him often. If you're constantly trading up and taking, he won't get any better about it. You have to show him that sometimes he will get the item back. Use different objects whenever possible. If he has a tendency to guard socks, turn an old sock into a toy/training item. Start with low value stuff, and work up to the high value items. Move at his pace.",2016-06-03 15:20:06+00:00,d3ujp73,1.0,t3_4md7jo,1807.0,Dogtraining

https://www.youtube.com/user/kikopup

&gt;we just rarely have a chance to train her together

It's not absolutely vital that you two train together, but you do have to remain consistent. Sit down together, look through the links I've supplied, and come up with a plan (or get into a class). Talk through how you're going to train each behavior, make a list of training priorities and just go through week by week. Week 1, ""Sit."" Week 2, ""Down."" Week 3, No jumping, etc. Some behaviors will take much longer (leash walking), some won't take long at all (sit), but work together to accomplish the same goal.

&gt;We have tried to discipline her several different ways but she does not respond to any of it

I'm assuming you're referring to punishment here, whether thats a firm no, spanking, or yelling.

Punishment isn't nearly as effective as we like to think it is. Dogs are opportunists. If your dog is barking her face off every time someone walks by the house, you can yell at her all you want, but the point is barking is *fun* and she has no reason to do anything else. 

Some punishment can also be harmful. If a dog is pulling on walks and reacting at the sight of other dogs, someone may opt to use a prong collar to control the dog. The problem is, the dog doesn't understand that its feeling pain as a result of pulling on the leash. All he understands is that when he sees a strange dog, he feels pain. So, strange dogs = pain, so the dog will become even more aggressive. 

Good dog training largely comes from rewarding the good behaviors you do want to see, redirecting/setting the dog up for good behaviors, and ignoring bad behaviors.

Now, this doesn't mean that if the dog is going through the garbage that you should just walk away until she's done. It means you need to redirect her to an appropriate activity (frozen Kongs are a great way to give your dog something better to do when you can't actively do something with her), and set your dog up for success by making the garbage inaccessible. Put it behind a closed door or get one with a locking lid (Bed, Bath, and Beyond sells them, though I've never used one).

You should also think about *why* the dog is displaying behaviors you don't want. It's most often out of boredom or lack of training. Going through the garbage is rewarding because dogs like to scavenge, and she's finding awesome treats. 

Jumping is rewarding because you interact with her (even negatively). If you push her off of you, you're playing her game. Turn around/back up and completely ignore her until all four feet are on the floor, then reward her with the attention she wants the instant she's not jumping. Dogs will catch on quickly if your timing and consistency is correct.

&gt;I expected better results at this age

It doesn't matter if the dog is 6 months or 6 years old, if the training isn't there, the good behaviors won't be there. Lower your expectations and recognize that she's misbehaving because you haven't effectively trained her. She's just a dog being a dog. 99% of bad behaviors are the owner's fault in some way. We're the ones with the stupid human rules. It's our job to help our dog to understand those rules and develop a common language and reward system.

&gt;but if she's only acting badly how are we supposed to find good actions to click on?

Again, you need to set your dog up for success. 

Exercise her so she's more receptive to training and so she's less likely to perform bad behaviors. Then train the good behaviors you want to see and use incompatible behaviors to end the bad ones.

For example, if she's jumping, ask her to sit. Sit is the behavior you do want to see, and the one you want to reward. It is also incompatible with jumping. She cannot jump if she's sitting. Show her what you do want her to do and reward her for it.

&gt;Neither of us have tried clickers before and we don't want to mess this up if it could potentially be the solution to our problems.

Clicker training isn't the magical solution, but it is the best way to communicate with the dog. It's much more precise and unbiased (the ""click"" can't convey frustration, anger, or even happiness; though you should also use a verbal marker at the same time, like ""Yes!"" or ""Good!"")

On the plus side, you have a lab. They're pretty forgiving as a breed, and often very food motivated. They just aim to please. You just have to give them the right tools.

Check out Zak George on YouTube. He almost exclusively clicker trains, and he loves working with high energy dogs. His leash training method is also the most engaging (start with his newest leash training video as that one has the best information IMO).

And always check with your vet before starting any new exercise routines. Forced running (jogging, biking, etc.) can be hard on joints, so you'll want to make sure your dog is ready to go before you start anything intensive.

Generally, I like [Zak George's method](https://youtu.be/b0bYJANdmbY) for high energy dogs. It's much more engaging and turns it into a game. Just make sure you work on a solid ""look at me"" since it's pretty much a big aspect of that method.

Also, make sure you're not trying to use that walk as exercise. Exercise the dog before you attempt to do any training. An overexcited dog cannot focus or learn.

It sounds like you were having success with your penalty yards. That's good! You just pushed the dog too far too fast. If it's working well 90% of the time in your yard, move to the driveway. Completely drop your goal of taking a successful walk for now. It will not happen right now, and you're just setting yourself up for frustration, and your dog failure. Your goal should just be 90% reliability in the driveway, then the sidewalk, then down the street, etc. for now.

810,"Late to the party, but here's my two cents.

I recently made the switch from a FitBit Charge HR to the Vivosmart HR.

I liked the FitBit, but I was having some issues that I just couldn't get over. For one, I just didn't like the way it looked. But I was also having an allergic reaction (or something) to the band/clasp that was leaving sores on my wrists.

The sleep tracking was good, and I liked that it tried to auto detect workouts.

But I think overall, I like the Garmin much better. It looks nicer, the touchscreen is great, and I love that it's water resistant (the FitBit never broke on me despite wearing it in the shower, but I definitely felt I was pressing my luck). 

The sleep tracking is *okay*. I don't like that you have to set a bed time and wake time. I have an irregular schedule, so some days I might not go to bed until 3 am, other days I might sleep from noon until 5, or I'll sleep normally. It doesn't seem to be able to handle deviations, so it really is kind of like a glorified stopwatch. I think they're making improvements to it, but if you're super concerned about accurate sleep tracking, I'd look elsewhere.

The floors climbed rarely works for me. Maybe my stairway just isn't long enough.

One sort of annoying thing is that the water droplets in the shower will actually mess with the touch screen. Every morning for the last few days, my music will randomly turn on while I'm in the shower. I do like the touch screen, but it shouldn't be so sensitive to warm water.

The app is a little difficult to get used to. I like the intuitiveness of the FitBit and Jawbone apps, but I figured it out after messing around with it a few times.

I have been having a problem with it syncing automatically in the mornings. I think it's because I'm waking up earlier than my ""normal wake time"" that it asks you to set.

The band feels a little cheap or delicate, but I have yet to break it. I'm super worried about scratching up the touch screen though. I might have to find a screen protector.

I honestly think you'd be happy with either device. I wouldn't say no to a FitBit again, but I'd have to figure out that skin reaction first.

Let me know if you have questions :)",2016-05-28 03:39:53+00:00,d3mm9rb,1.0,t3_4ktv33,308942.0,Garmin

One thing to keep in mind is that your dog will need to get used to running those kinds of distances. Think of it like marathon training.

I read an article a long, long time ago about a dog with similar roadblocks. IIRC, the dog's problem was that he would only track familiar things.

Now, this is all from poor memory, but I *think* what they did was much more practice with unfamiliar people. 

They'd start with the dog meeting the stranger (who would be acting excited), and then (I think) the person would run off, dropping a hat or something of theirs in the process. Then the dog would smell the hat, and go searching.

The excitement level of this person running away made the dog want to go find them. And then when the person was found, they would act even more happy and excited than they did during the initial meeting.

Let's just remove the e collar and ""possible abuse"" variables for a second. Training isn't as easy as ""this guy trained my dog to do X, so X is a permanent behavior."" It doesn't work that way. Dogs pretty much only listen to the one who trained them. They don't understand that behaviors carry over to everyone.

The dog counter surfs because it's more reinforcing than not counter surfing. You need to either remove every single interesting thing off the counter, or you need to completely block her access to the kitchen.

Resource guarding is something that can be addressed, but it sounds like you don't want it to be an issue around the baby. You should *never* allow a child around a dog with food/toys anyway.

The way the one in my area works is the dogs are put in the actual play room in shifts. The rest of the time, they're crated. They play room is very small. Might be okay with a small dog that doesn't mind other dogs in small spaces, but really shitty if you have a large dog like I do.

I don't know how it works at other locations. You'd have to ask.

Those daycares in peoples' homes are sometimes just as good as ones at large facilities. See if you can find a Yelp or rover.com review.

Then, we created a game where we run forward, then stop, and he has to stop and sit in position. He LOVES this game. Then we turned this game into different speeds and distances. So, maybe we'll run as fast as possible for 50', stop, and then walk as slowly as possible for 10'. 

So, in doorways, we put him in a heel and slowly walk through.

Sounds like some anxious running? My dog gets very anxious about weird situations like that. Pretty much anything in which he's not 100% sure about how he's supposed to conduct himself. But, he's also not very handler-focused, so training is hard. We turn every training opportunity possible into a game.

911,"&gt;She likes to eat food off the floor or out of the trashcan

Pick stuff up off the floor, teach ""leave it,"" and put the garbage can somewhere she cannot get to it, like behind a closed door

&gt;She has recently started to go into bathrooms and tear up toilet paper

Close the bathroom door.

&gt;If she wants to chew on something she will continuously try to get it even  if we take it away and move it higher up

Give her something you DO want her to chew on. Don't just expect her to go find her own fun. Because that's exactly what she's doing. She's bored, so she's going to find something fun to chew on. And I bet it gets a reaction out of you when she grabs something she's not supposed to have. That reinforces the fun of that object. ""Hey, look! They play my game when I grab this item!"" And I bet you don't show her nearly as much attention as when she actually grabs one of HER toys. What's fun about those toys if they don't get you excited, too?

&gt;She is sent to her cage for punishment several times a day

leads to

&gt;She whines and paces in her cage for hours

The crate should NEVER be used as punishment. And, just in case this is what's going on, she shouldn't be in there for hours for punishment. She literally has forgotten what she's done wrong as soon as you even just close the door.

Dogs don't understand punishment like we do. You have a matter of a few seconds for her to understand that she's being punished for something she's done. Sounds like you've been doing a lot of punishing. Has it changed anything? Of course not! She's not resilient or stubborn. Punishment is largely ineffective unless you're conducting it absolutely *perfectly*! So stop with the punishment.

In fact, I can promise you a large part of the reason she seems to independent and doesn't want to spend time with you is because she only sees you as the person who randomly (remember, dogs don't remember their behaviors) gets upset and yells at her and sticks her in the crate. You're doing nothing to create a bond in which she actually wants to hang out with you.

You're creating this loop where she seems like an awful dog (and, likewise, one in which your other dog seems so amazing).

Untrained dog does something bad &gt; you get mad and punish her &gt; she wants to spend less time with you &gt; you don't like her as much because, hey, this other dog is SO AWESOME! &gt; she's still untrained &gt; you're still punishing &gt; she still doesn't want to spend time with you &gt; you still don't like her as much as AWESOME DOG!

You like trained dog &gt; you spend more time with trained dog &gt; have better bond with trained dog &gt; this dog is AWESOME

You see what I'm getting at?

&gt;She also doesn't listen and will stare at us when we give her commands or straight up disregard

How much time did you spend training these commands, proofing them in different environments, and then gradually fading the reward? Better yet, HOW did you train these behaviors? Did everyone in the family participate equally and consistently in training?

When a dog doesn't follow a command, a few things are happening.

Either the dog just legitimately doesn't understand the command (and this includes ""dog doesn't understand that the command still applies in this new environment she isn't in often""), OR you haven't given a good enough reason to do that command.

Think of ""come."" If you call her to you away from a squirrel she's chasing, her reward for coming to you better be 100x better than that squirrel. And if you punish her because she ignored the command 5 times before coming, the ONLY thing she's learned is ""I'm not coming back next time, because all that's going to happen is I'm going to be yelled at!""

You need to go back to the beginning in your training and make sure you're using 100% positive reinforcement methods. Read through the sidebar and wiki before you do ANYTHING. I have a previously abused, independent dog. Trust me when I tell you that it's VERY hard to rebuild training a second time if you're not doing things absolutely positively. Change your command words, too, so she has no prior association with the commands (""come"" = punishment is a bad association you don't want).

You need to entirely change your viewpoint on dog training and behavior. That's not a criticism, either. That's just how it is. You've found a new learning opportunity. Take advantage of it.

You also need to make sure she's getting enough exercise and mental stimulation. Most of her bad behaviors are a result of being bored. It's your job to make sure she's not bored. Learn about clicker training (Zak George on YouTube) and start mentally exercising her that way.",2016-05-14 15:51:24+00:00,d35bvvg,1.0,t3_4jbotj,3544.0,Dogtraining

If the crate is made to be a negative thing (dog is thrown in when owners are noticeably upset, he's left in there for long periods of time, he's put in there repeatedly, etc.) you're setting the dog up to not enjoy being crated.

973,"Okay, some of this might sound harsh. I don't intend it that way, so please do not take it that way.

He should never have been taken to a facility like that.

Your dog was exhibiting most of those behaviors out of fear because, as you said, he's an anxious dog. What has really happened is an anxious dog was thrown into a completely unfamiliar environment, most likely trained with some very outdated, not nice training methods, and the progress you saw is a result of the meds (if they worked; not every med will work for every dog and it takes a few weeks to start seeing results), him getting used to this new environment, and just not being exposed to his regular triggers.

He never needed a boarding program. What he needed, and likely still needs, is a board certified veterinary behaviorist (or a really, REALLY good **positive reinforcement** trainer) to help teach YOU how to counter condition and help your dog understand that these scary situations aren't scary anymore.

Training isn't as simple as ""this guy spent four weeks with the dog. He's fixed now."" Training occurs with you. What often happens at these places is the dog behaves well for the trainer, but then comes home and doesn't behave well for its owners because the owners spent very little time doing any training. 

It doesn't sound like you had an untrained dog. You had a anxious, scared dog who was doing the only thing he knew how to do to make the scary things go away. You need to learn how to better manage the environment, keep him under threshold, and help change his reactions to different triggers.

So, please, find yourselves the proper professional. If this boarding trainer tells you to use any training collars, alpha rolling, scruffing, extreme ignoring, or anything like that, DO NOT DO IT. You will only make things much worse for yourself.

Edit: Also, if they were using outdated, harmful training methods (which, honestly, they most likely were) then your anxious dog would have shut down and the behaviors were suppressed, not trained out. This is a form of learned helplessness, not training. You'll see those unwanted reactions again once he's back in his normal environment and he's not experiencing pain or intimidation anymore.

Also, of course they're going to send you pictures of him having the time of his life. They're not going to send you pictures if he looks miserable. Marketing 101.",2016-05-04 06:35:22+00:00,d2s59iv,1.0,t3_4hqw8p,29783.0,Dogtraining

981,"Frankly, you're not doing things correctly.

When training, if he barks and jumps, you need to reward the *second* he's sitting quietly. Don't try to wait for a 10 second sit or something. That would be pushing him way too far. Literally the very moment he's quiet and sitting, engage in play with the toy.

With biting, all three of those things you listed actually encouraging biting. Pushing into him makes it a game, bitter apple makes your hand interesting (some dogs even *like* the taste), and ignoring to allow him to continue to chew just allows him to have fun with whatever you have. Ignoring is a great tool, but you're not using it for the right circumstances.

Instead, when he bites, you disengage immediately. Stand up and turn away from him (just once; don't turn it into a spinning game). If he immediately settles a bit (isn't jumping or biting at your legs) then begin playing again. If he's jumping or biting your legs, leave the room and completely ignore him. Use baby gates to prevent him from following you. The second teeth touch skin (or he uses a specific amount of pressure; some people don't mind gentle mouthing) the game is over.

When he's chewing on things he shouldn't be, trade up with a different toy. If he has a slipper, grab a tug toy or a bully stick and engage in play with that.

And, honestly, that's a management issue. You need to pick your shit up and put anything you don't want turning into a toy away. That's just a basic rule of owning a dog. If you don't want it destroyed, put it away.

Jumping, same as above. Just walk away and end play. It only needs to end for 1-2 minutes. Anything past a minute or two and he won't understand anymore.

Barking. You need to 100% ignore it 100% of the time. If you've *ever* given in at any point ever, he's learned that if he's persistent, he'll eventually get what he wants. When you're extinguishing the behavior it WILL get much worse before it gets better. He's going to bark his absolute face off before he realizes that barking doesn't get him anything. But you also need to reward him when he's actually quiet. 90% of dog training is rewarding the behaviors you do want to see, and ignoring/redirecting the ones you don't want to see.

That being said, barking is a symptom of a problem, not a behavior you can just throw a training collar at. The collar *might* stop the barking, but it doesn't treat the underlying issue (boredom, attention seeking, fear, etc.) and can actually cause many more issues than they solve. You need to think about WHY he's barking, and then address the issue at the source.

Second, when was the last time they were all at the vet, particularly the oldest one? Dogs are really good at hiding pain and illness, but it will make them quicker to snap. You should make sure all of them are healthy.

Spaying would be a good idea. Note that if these behaviors have just become habits, spaying won't break them, but it might help. Female dogs often fight with other females, and having them fixed can help dial that down in some cases.

Thundershirts are really hit or miss. Like with any other tool, you aren't supposed to just throw it on and call it a day. You want to actually do some counterconditioning so that the dog's trigger isn't as scary. The Thundershirt, when it works, will bring the dog back under threshold (essentially the point at which training will become impossible because the dog is so freaked out) so you can start addressing the issue.

When they do fight, what you should do is grab the back legs of the aggressor and sort of wheel barrow them away. Just grab the legs, lift a little (front legs still on floor...you don't want to hurt them), and pull backwards. With small dogs, you might still get bitten, but it'll be harder for her to bite you.

1003,"&gt;It won't take very many instances for your dog to get stressed out because someone they didn't know came up and surprised them by touching them or reaching out and they react with a little bark or a nip which makes the person withdraw

This is actually why its so important to actually allow him to meet strangers. You don't want it to be a surprise when some random kid, who likely doesn't know that it's not okay to approach strange dogs without permission, comes running at your dog. You want him to understand that when he's in public, people are going to touch him.

At 10 weeks, you're nowhere near the age where you can expect him to focus on you entirely. That's completely unrealistic, and, as someone else said, it's MUCH easier to teach a dog to be handler-focused (especially when that's already a common breed trait) than to teach a dog (who is prone to being protective, and aggressive if unsocialized) that nothing bad is happening when some random kid comes up to him. Does that make sense?

You need to set your dog up for success. Unless you're a police or military officer and this dog will be actively doing that kind of work every day, you need to first and foremost train the dog to be a pet and polite member of society.

IMO, what would be best for you guys would be to find a rescue organization that places many of its dogs in foster homes. Let them know what you're looking for in a dog, and they can help you find a dog that will fit nicely in your home. Some dogs are perfectly happy being left alone for 8 hours, others lose their shit if they're alone for more than two. There's a breed trait to this, but you also have to consider personality. Separation anxiety can be a real pain in the ass to fix (though it's doable).

So contact some shelters in your area, ask if they have anything that would suit you, and fill out an application.

/r/Dogs also has a breed questionnaire to help you get some breed ideas. From there you can find a breed specific rescue.

-Took him camping, I'm assuming for the first time considering his age, and expect him to settle. You also made him sleep in a strange location, and the both of you weren't with him right away.

-Took him to a dog park he normally goes to, but didn't go inside.

All of these are situations in which he doesn't know what the hell he should expect, or what exactly is happening. Add in the fact that he's still a puppy, and *of course* he won't be able to settle down.

I struggled to design something with a purpose. My teacher made a point to say that it should reflect us in some way.

1173,"26/F from the Chicago area. I'm a graphic design student. I'm VERY new to graphic design, but I absolutely love it so far. I discovered graphic design by accident, and I'm so happy I did!

I was an athlete in high school, and gained a small amount of weight after I graduated because I wasn't actually active anymore. But I was working a physically demanding job, so it wasn't anything too serious.

Then I started taking antidepressants and mood stabilizers. Oh my god, the amount of food I consumed would probably put a cow to shame. Add in the fact that the meds weren't working, so I didn't want to leave the house AND the side effects were so bad that I didn't want to get off the couch, and you're practically begging for obesity. At my lowest point, I gained about 70 lbs in 2 years.

Since about 2014, I've done a lot of different things to try to lose weight. I walked more, CICO, tried the Insanity workout...nothing was working well enough, and I couldn't stick with anything. My weight and poor body condition makes even medium-impact activity too painful.

So, I've been focusing on portion control and preventing myself from reaching that point during the day where I'm so hungry I feel the need to eat everything I see. So, I'm still allowing myself to have junk food and the things I actually like to eat, but I'm working on not eating half of a Large pizza and listening to my body when it tells me I'm full.

1175,"I don't have a reactive dog, but I do have an escape artist, so *maybe* my story will help?

My dog is a GSP that is just so fucking independent when he's outside. It's been almost 4 years now (I think), and we've only made a tiny dent in his independent streak. Inside, he is almost as biddable as a Golden or something. Outside, I can't get his attention for ANYTHING.

So, when this headache of a dog (I love him, of course, but he truly is a walking headache) learned that he can jump/climb fences, the nightmare began. Not only can he escape from yards, but his recall is awful because training has *barely* occurred outside because he's just too damn distracted. 

So, I had to make adjustments. 

I live with my mom (damn you, student loans!), but my ""room"" is pretty much just the living room (it was easiest this way because, when I moved back in, I was essentially condensing a 2-bedroom apartment into a tiny studio apartment haha). This room is right next to the front door, and has easy access to the back door. I had to put up baby gates and use his crate to confine him to that room so he couldn't escape.

Outside, he is NEVER unsupervised.

In the car, the car door doesn't open wide enough until I have a firm grasp on his collar/harness/leash. I just got a harness with a seat belt restraint, which I plan to use. 

My life has pretty much become a game of, ""Can the dog escape? If so, how do I prevent that?""

So, it's entirely possible to keep your dog, but you have to put a lot of effort into changing up your routines and habits. Get a seat belt restraint so the dog can't jump out of the car until you have his leash. Keep him supervised in the yard, like you've been doing. Muzzle train so that he can't do a whole ton of damage if there's a bad encounter with another dog.

1214,"Should you hire an expert? Yes. Definitely. Should it be a boot camp? Definitely not.

Boot camp type places are really shitty for numerous reasons. Just off the top of my head:

-Your dog is suddenly placed in a scary environment, with people she doesn't know. Dogs do not handle change well, and a scared dog is literally incapable of learning anything.

-Training needs to occur WITH you. You don't just teach a dog something and then assume the task is done. Training is a lifelong process. Dogs are always learning. Having someone else train her would also result in a dog that listens to the trainer, but not you. You need to actually put forth the effort.

-You have absolutely no control over the care and treatment of your dog. Many of those boot camp places use very outdated, scientifically disproven techniques that can actually cause much more harm than good, and can make your situation much, much worse.

-The triggers exist in your home. Sure, she'd probably display the same behaviors elsewhere, but it's within your home that you're actually seeing them, with your other dog. That means training needs to occur with those triggers present, in her normal environment.

A couple of other things. 

KBDs are predisposed to be dog aggressive. Of course, that doesn't mean it's guaranteed, but there's that potential there. They were bred to hunt dangerous animals, and they can be aggressive around other animals by nature.

What sort of training methods have you used, and what have you taught each dog? What do you mean by ""correct?"" How do you react when these fights occur?

As for the professional, you need to find a certified behaviorist, not a trainer. There's a link in the sidebar to help you choose a professional. You should choose a professional who uses force free/positive reinforcement methods. Punishment-based training WILL make the situation worse.

You also have a management problem. It sounds like she's predominantly resource guarding. Therefore, the dogs should never be around each other when food is present. Keep them in separate areas, or feed them in their crates. If there's food around, at least one of them needs to be in a crate.",2016-04-10 22:12:42+00:00,d1xr4pv,1.0,t3_4e7qkb,1989.0,Dogtraining

Hello, everyone!

I'm 26/F. I currently weigh roughly 227 lbs. I used to weigh about 160 lbs when I was in my best shape and really muscular, so I'm trying to get back to that.

I've fallen off the wagon a few times, but I think I'm doing much better this time around, so I'm excited. I've actually found drinking a ton of tea helps me lose a small amount of weight, *and* keeps me ~~de~~hydrated (I have no idea why my phone autocorrected to that), so if you want to talk tea, I'm your girl.

Not sure what else to write without sounding like I'm whining!

In a nutshell, I blame portion control and mental health for my weight gain. I gained 70-something pounds in about 2 years. I have bipolar disorder, and those meds make you want to eat everything in sight, so I did. But they also make you never want to leave your bed/couch, so I didn't. 

I ""woke up"" after I realized I went from a student athlete in school, with a body I was at least content with, to someone who sweats after walking up a flight of stairs. 

I think I also have an attitude/motivation issue. I've always hated things like jogging or lifting weights. I like sports instead. I want my physical activity to actually be fun for me. But most physical activity causes me pain in some way, whether its my back, knees, shins (shin splints are horrible), or pretty much my entire body. BUT, I decided to just go back to doing the things I liked to do when I was a teenager. So, I'm buying some rollerblades soon (don't hate on my blades), I'm going to try to get back into street hockey, and my SO and I recently realized we kind of like golf (granted, this is a driving range, so walking is minimal, but I worked the hell out of my back muscles!)

Most dogs also need to go out a *minimum* of 3 times a day. I know my dog wouldn't be able to hold it for very long if he were being taken out only twice a day.

If you're serious about dogs, get out of that place and find a trainer who is handling their business well. In general, board and train facilities are not good places for dogs anyway.

Yeah, I really kind of messed this one up. My teacher told me he didn't really like the low poly *after* I had already finished that part. Then he just told me to ""do a simple, abstract background,"" and I didn't know what that meant so I just did something I liked.

Any ideas for a ""simple, abstract background,"" *or* a quick fix I can make to the dog to make the background and dog have matching styles?

1294,"Well, first, you've only had her for three days. She's going through some majorly stressful life changes right now, and she's going to display behaviors that may not even be natural for her. 

Second, you have to actually spend time training these behaviors. Dogs don't come with the ""come when called"" instinct, and there's honestly no reason you should expect her to have perfect recall when she spent most of her life locked in a crate and ignored.

Take a positive reinforcement class with her, but accept the fact that there *will* be some behaviors that you may not be able to perfect. Not every dog can be an off leash dog. It's a great goal to work towards, but don't get upset if you find that she's not one of those dogs.

1437,"&gt;he agreed to send her to dog training but has no hope it will work

A board and train situation may very well fail you for this problem.

Board and train places train the dog in an unfamiliar, stressful environment. The dog will learn how to behave for the trainer, but even with those ""This is what we did"" overview sessions, *you* didn't spend time training the dog, so the dog isn't going to behave as well for you.

With board and train, you also completely lose control of your dog's care and well being. Many of those board and train places use very outdated, harmful training techniques. 

In fact, if you are disciplining your dog, you may very well be making the whole situation worse.

You need to find a certified veterinary behaviorist to come work with you, your dogs, and observe the environment the dog is living in right now.

What these methods really do are suppress behavior (make her stop barking, for example), but they don't really *teach* anything. 

You dog doesn't understand *why* there's no reason to bark. She doesn't understand *why* you're ignoring her all day (dogs thrive on human attention, and ignoring her all day is excessive and useless). All she's learning is that when someone enters the house, loud and scary noises occur. 

You need to find a good positive reinforcement trainer. The behaviors you were having issues with are totally normal, and there are much kinder, easier ways to fix them. 

Go to clickertraining.com and APDT.com and use the trainer search tools to find trainers in your area. I also highly recommend you read through the sidebar and wiki so you start getting an idea as to why this trainer was a bad choice.

1468,"He's brand new, and you have to give him a chance to settle down before you can start determining what his actual personality is like. Some things he'll get used to on his own, other things might need some work, and still other things he may not even truly be afraid of, but the fact that he's overwhelmed is making him fear those things.

&gt;When he is inside, he runs circles around the living room

This is likely due to three things.

One, he doesn't know the rules of the house yet.

Two, he's part ACD, which is a high energy breed.

Three, he's overwhelmed, so he's expending his energy in the only way he knows how to.

&gt;He is afraid of his toys, especially the squeaky ones, so he won't go near them

Either he'll come around, or he just won't care about them (but the terrier in him means he'll probably come around)

&gt;he does chew everything else

Dogs often chew to relieve stress

&gt;If it's time to feed him, I sometimes have to carry him down the hallway to his crate

Let him approach his food on his own. By carrying him, you're not giving him the opportunity to figure it out on his own. A healthy dog will not let itself starve. 

&gt;My parents are frustrated

All of you need to take a step back and realize that this dog is absolutely terrified. Dogs don't handle change well. They don't understand *why* their entire lives have changed. He doesn't understand that this is his home now. You need to be patient and understanding. This is *completely* normal for a rescue dog. 

&gt;Is there any type of training or behavior modification techniques that I can implement at home now

Always, always remain positive. If you're practicing dominance theory (alpha rolls, scruffing, asserting yourself), stop. If you're using positive punishment (yelling, hitting, prong/choke collars), stop it. Neither of these will help at all, and they may very well do more harm than good (plus, science has shown them to be much less effective than other forms of training).

DO reward him for the behaviors you want to see (if he's sitting quietly, give him treats and walk away). DO be patient and calm. DO allow him to figure your home out without unnecessary interference (don't force him to do anything, but allow him to check out new areas when he feels like it).

In my opinion, its too early for a professional. Give him some time to settle down. Yes, he'll display some bad behaviors, but once he calms down and breaks out of his shell, you'll see which of his behaviors truly are his, and which are just a result of stress.

What you can do is go through a rescue group that places dogs in foster homes. That way, most of their personality can be observed, so they can match you with a dog that will suit your needs.

1519,"I *definitely* recommend doing the questionnaire on /r/dogs before adopting. Pits are fantastic dogs, but they aren't for everyone. They're powerful dogs that need a lot of dedication.

That being said, it's important to think about prey drive and dog aggression. Not every pit will be dog aggressive, but just like any dog, there will be some that cannot be around other dogs. A dog-aggressive Golden will just be viewed as an unsocialized dog, but a dog-aggressive pit will be viewed as dangerous. The media has really ruined this breed's reputation, so if it bothers you that someone may view your dog as out of control or dangerous for a very common issue, this breed isn't for you.

Prey drive is also a concern. Terriers were bred to kill things like rodents, so their prey drive is strong. In a calm environment, a pit may seem perfect around cats, but all it takes is for that cat to start running to potentially excite that prey drive, and then you have a dead cat. Occasionally on this sub we'll see posts about a pit/terrier that killed someone's cat/puppy/chicken and it becomes ""Should I euthanize?"" It's a natural instinct and you cannot blame the dog for honestly being set up to fail.

Does this mean the dog will try to kill a cat or fight dogs? Absolutely not! But that potential is there, and when it comes to owning a breed so feared by the media, you have to be an ambassador for the breed. If your lifestyle suits the breed, and you're prepared to have some people avoid you or look at you funny, go for it! But if anything I've said makes you hesitate for a bit, it might not be the breed for you.

If this specific dog isn't for you, go through a rescue that puts their dogs in foster homes. They'll be able to match you to a dog that suits your lifestyle.",2016-03-28 17:21:02+00:00,d1gjnnh,1.0,t3_4cars9,4557.0,Dogtraining

IIRC, cats ""bury"" things, not to save them for later, but to cover their tracks to avoid predators and prevent prey from knowing the cat is around. Our cats cover anything from food, to urine, to spilled soap on the sink. 

But if you're hinting at the cat causing the dog to believe she's not allowed to eat or something because the cat claimed it, you have nothing to worry about.

Your dog is marking because he's intact, and it's going to be a VERY hard habit to break (not impossible, but you have your work cut out for you).

Have you or your parents ever yelled at him for peeing inside? Ever. Even when he was a puppy/when you got him. If so, that's why he's doing it when you're not watching. He's learned it's not okay to pee in front of you, but not that it's not okay to pee in the house.

What you need to do is supervise the absolute hell out of him. Eyes always on him. He's either tethered to you, or he's in a crate (crate train, don't just suddenly shove him in there). Take him outside frequently so he always has an opportunity to go outside, and throw a fucking party when he goes outside, even if he currently pees outside without a problem. You want to show him that good things happen when he pees outside. If he marks inside, you're the one that messed up, so all you can do is quietly clean it up with an enzymatic cleaner and move on with your life.

And, like you, I think it's...irresponsible? Selfish? Negligent? (I don't know the right word I want to use) to reproduce knowing you have certain conditions.

I come from a family that is just full of mental illnesses, Alzheimer's (extremely strong on both sides of my family...I'm fucked), and heart disease/obesity/diabetes/all of those top killers. No cancer that I know of though, so I guess I've got that going for me.

Point is, as happy as I am to experience life and all that, it's just like, what the fuck, mom and dad? I have to deal with a lifetime full of mental illness, but the positive is I'll die young or my brain will turn to mush so I won't know what's going on? Thanks.

I have four siblings. 2 of them are almost guaranteed to have kids. One probably will, and the other seems to be on the CF-fence. 

I don't understand the appeal of bringing a child into this world, one that you should love and want the absolute best for, when there's a great potential for suffering. There are millions of kids of all ages looking for homes all over the damn planet, but you have to produce your own because, what, you want a carbon copy of yourself? (I don't understand that appeal, either)

I understand that it's insanely expensive and tedious to adopt a child, but if you want a child *that* bad, isn't that worth saving up for? Plus, I would imagine it wouldn't be as expensive to adopt from the state (if you're in the US) versus a private agency or another country.

As a kid, I didn't know you were allowed to not be a parent. When I was really young, I was absolutely terrified because I thought some day I'd have to pop a watermelon out of my ass. When I got a little older, I learned that you can adopt, so I decided that when I was at that point in my life where I was forced to have kids, I'd just adopt. When I learned you weren't required to be a parent, it was like winning the mental lottery. I was SO relieved!

My dog is pretty much bald on his underside, so the neoprene is really nice. Fleece is okay, but if its thin enough, the webbing can still cause issues.

1621,"&gt;First of all, is having human food, in itself, a bad thing?

Not really. You'll need to make sure he's getting proper nutrition, and not eating anything toxic (chocolate, onion, etc.) though. Will he eat dog food if it's been soaked in beef or chicken broth?

&gt;Second, how do I get out of this situation where I can't train him by rewarding

Rewards don't have to be food, but that's just the most commonly accepted reward. You can also reward with play or access to things the dog wants. I recommend finding the book ""When Pigs Fly.""

You can also use her meals as rewards instead of feeding out of bowls (I recommend doing this anyway). Turn every meal into a training session, and try to break it up into 3-4 training sessions, if possible (so, smaller portions at each meal).

&gt;Should I just deprive him of human food and leave dog food in his bowl so he'll eat it eventually once hungry enough? 

You *could*, but you're right, convincing your girlfriend might make it difficult. I would instead gradually phase out the human food and/or mix in something the dog does like into the food. What dog food brands/types have you tried? What human food does the dog eat? What are you feeding him every day?

&gt;Should I keep experimenting with different treats until I find one he likes?

Definitely. Even highly food motivated dogs have certain treats they favor more than others. And those preferences can change, too. A year ago, my dog *liked* hot dogs, but not enough to take them in highly distracting environments. But at some point, he decided he *loves* hot dogs, so his favorite treat is a mix of hot dogs and kibble (the dry dog food soaks up the moisture from the hot dogs, making them hot dog flavored).

If you look through old posts, you'll find all kinds of rewards people use. Be creative, just make sure you're careful not to give the dog anything toxic (onion is going to be the hardest to avoid).",2016-03-20 19:24:09+00:00,d16zxxl,1.0,t3_4b8smg,1138.0,Dogtraining

1639,"&gt;Usually relieves himself on the pads but sometimes at random, wherever he wants

Pads are problematic because they teach the dog that it's okay to go inside. Dogs often don't understand that the pad is the *only* place they're allowed to go.

&gt;His vet attributed to him not being neutered

Depends if he's marking or not. If the dog is marking, it's very unlikely he'll pee large amounts (as if he's emptying his bladder), but will typically go smaller amounts in different areas of the house. If he's peeing large amounts at once, he's probably just peeing. 

&gt;I understand that training a Yorkie requires patience, but how far can I realistically get with a 3 year old

Training ANY dog requires patience. If you put in the time and effort (including research!), you can achieve a lot with an adult dog. The hardest part is training out ingrained behaviors.

&gt;my girlfriend is not very cooperative, constantly praising her even when I try to discipline

Punishment truly does nothing, unless you have it timed *perfectly*, and are using a punishment of the correct caliber (severe enough to make him not do it again, but not so severe to traumatize him). It's really pointless to try punishment.

Now, that means managing the environment, and rewarding for all the good things you *do* want to see happening. Throw a huge doggy party *every single time* the dog pees outside. If he pees inside, you need to calmly clean it up and move on with your life. 

&gt;Not interacting in any meaningful way

Some dogs don't like interacting with people, especially not if they're the source of punishment and negative things

&gt;barely responding to his name. Never coming along when ask

If he was never trained to come when called, he's probably not going to do it. Very, very few dogs have good recall without solid training. 

&gt;would not continue to sit for 1 sec after I remove (gentle) pressure

This is not how you train a dog to sit, and it's not the way to get a dog to like you any better OR want to interact with you

&gt;One thing I notice that is different is the near absence of eye contact

Eye contact can be problematic for some dogs. You need to train them to give it to you.

It's also important to remember, the dog just experienced a major life change (moving homes). Dogs don't handle change well, and it can take a while for them to settle down. If these behaviors did not occur when the dog was living with your girlfriend's parents, they may go away on their own, or be very simple to train out.

I don't really have any specific sources for biddability (is there something specific you're looking for, or just more information?), but a Google search brings up some stuff. 

Here are a couple of links I found. I only skimmed them, so you'll have to fact check on your own.

When I was 11 or so, my friend got a brand new Gameboy Advance SP. We were in my laundry room because I had to grab a stack of towels for my mom, and she stupidly put the thing right next to the stack of towels while she tied her shoe or something dumb like that. I didn't know it was there, so when I picked up the towels, the Gameboy went crashing to the floor.

I don't remember quite how it broke. I *think* the screen/lid/clamshell/whatever was loose, but I do remember it still worked.

Of course, she immediately left my house absolutely LIVID because she JUST got the thing. Naturally, she blamed it on me, and knowing her, probably told her parents I threw it against the wall or something.

I didn't see her for a really long time after that, and she avoided me at school. After that, she started hanging out with people of her own race and at my school, races did NOT intermingle if they didn't have to.

Oh well.

Another quick one. This one I actually feel a little guilty about, but I don't think you can blame me for this one.

I was at this same friend's house. I went to use her bathroom, and when I was washing my hands, they had a fancy soap dispenser and one of those boring plastic Softsoap dispensers. Well, of course, I wanted to use the fancy one! I pushed down on the dispenser with my little girl hands, and it completely slid out from under my hand, hit the wall, went crashing to the floor, and broke. It slid out under my hands so easily because it was empty, so it had no weight to it. Apparently they just had it for decoration.

1661,"Intelligence is a pretty poor term to use. I think a better one would be something like, ""willingness to learn.""

All dogs are intelligent. Sure, there are dogs who can learn an extensive vocabulary, and some who can't even figure out how to roll over, but every breed has something to bring to the table. A border collie may be able to herd sheep for 12 hours a day, but they could never do water rescue like a Newfoundland, no matter how smart the dog is, because they weren't built for that kind of job.

The real issue is biddability. This is how eager a dog is to work with you. You can have an insanely ""intelligent"" dog, but if they have no biddability and are more aloof and independent, you might not get much out of them.

I have a German Shorthaired Pointer. They're typically considered highly intelligent dogs. They're #17 on your list. We typically call him ""dumb"" because he just doesn't really enjoy learning or training sessions, no matter how I structure them. In his mind, he has WAY better things to be doing, so he just doesn't work with us. He is not a biddable dog. But if you put a bird in front of him, oh my god, you can practically see the neurons firing. He will do everything in his power to figure out how to get to that bird (which has led to us needing to use special harnesses he can't escape from, drastically restrict his freedom in the yard because he knows how to get over the fence no matter what part of the yard he's in, and we can't open the windows more than a few inches because he knows he can pop the screens out). He truly is insanely smart, but learning only occurs when it benefits him. 

With a biddable dog, your mere existence can sometimes be enough to motivate them. With an independent dog, motivation will always be a more important goal than the actual behavior you're trying to train. You can also easily ""ruin"" an independent dog.

Say your independent dog escapes out the front door, and ignores every ""come"" command you yell at him. When you finally get him back, you're pissed, and you yell at him. He'll remember that, and you've just damaged your recall. How does it benefit him to come back to you when he's just going to get yelled at? Chasing that cat is WAY more beneficial to him. So you have to be very careful.

I like to tell people that the independent dogs are the smartest ones. They're the ones constantly analyzing a situation and figuring out what is in *their* best interest. The biddable ones are the dumb ones. They'll give up chasing a deer for a piece of hot dog, just because you asked. But *we* see the biddable one as smart because it learned the command so easily. But really, what it is is that they never learned that they *can* disobey to get what they truly want.",2016-03-17 18:57:00+00:00,d13l197,1.0,t3_4arwqv,42833.0,Dogtraining

I will miss the potential for really unique exchanges. I hope gradually more exchanges are introduced to allow for those unique exchanges. The open ended exchanges are good, but you're much less likely to get matched with someone who understands why you like the things you like. 

For example, I was hoping we'd get an X-Files exchange (before I knew the exchanges were dropped to 3). We got a Sci Fi exchange this round, which works.

Not uncommon. Comes from a lack of socialization. 

Again, agreeing with you, but I still think you're selling rescues short. Puppies can still display/develop those unwanted behaviors, and older dogs can be retrained/reconditioned. 

To say, ""I don't want X behaviors, so I must get a puppy!"" would be absurd to someone who doesn't want a puppy. I have A LOT of dog experience, and have puppy experience, and I would NEVER get a puppy. WAY too much work just to avoid the potential for bad behaviors. Having a puppy is like having an infant that is capable of destroying your house. I'd much rather roll the dice and potentially end up with a dog that resource guards (which I can easily fix) rather than pull my hair out for a year or more because I got a puppy. 

Not to mention, just like breeders, there are good shelters and there are bad shelters. Shelters and rescue groups that send their dogs to foster homes will be able to match you with a dog that fits into what you're looking for. Your local animal control doesn't have those resources available to them.

1727,"Is this your first dog? How much experience do you have with dogs? High energy dogs?

First, it's important to note that you have a young dog whose life suddenly changed. You're going to see some behaviors for a few more weeks that may or may not disappear, or at least lessen, as she settles into her new home. It took my dog about 3 months to fully come out of his shell. Some dogs take longer, others do not take that long. It just depends on how well she adapts.

She's also technically still a puppy. Granted, labs are high energy dogs, but you do have a puppy. You're going to see obnoxious behavior until you get on top of her exercise and mental stimulation, and actually train her. 

Now, what you first need to do is seriously consider your lifestyle and if you have the time to dedicate to owning a high energy dog. Many high energy dogs can exist perfectly fine in households where the owner(s) is working every day, but you HAVE to be able to dedicate time to the dog. This means a minimum of 30 minutes of running, or 60 minutes of fast walking. Or, you need to be able to walk long distances at a normal human pace. 

You also need to be able to dedicate time to mental stimulation. As a dog gets more and more physical exercise, it builds up endurance. But mental stimulation can be just as effective as physical exercise at tiring a dog out, without building up endurance. You can do things like clicker training, feeding out of puzzle toys and frozen Kongs, and playing scent games (my dog LOVES when I hide his food all over the living room for him to go find). Pretty much, you want to completely ditch her food bowls and figure out ways to feed her meals in ways that require her to use her brain. 

House training takes a lot of consistency and it can take some time. There's a great wiki page dedicated to house training [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/housetraining).

And [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/looseleashwalking) is our page on loose leash walking.

It's also important to point out that dominance theory (your brother's form of training) is based on very outdated, debunked science. The researcher who first posed this theory has since retracted his theory and is now a positive reinforcement trainer. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/cesarmillan) is a good page to find more information on that. [Here](https://apdt.com/about/position-statements/lima/) is information on the LIMA approach, which is what we advocate for on this subreddit.

Honestly, your issues here are not uncommon, and not unfixable. But they will require some time and effort. You don't have a bad dog, you just have a dog who is just as stressed out as you are, under exercised, and untrained. Remember, dogs don't come preloaded with all the behaviors we want them to do. We actually have to take the time to train them. 

I highly recommend a group training class (exercise her before you go!). APDT.com and clickertraining.com have great trainer search tools to help you find one in your area.

If you can afford it, your dog will benefit from just one day a week at daycare. Ideally, every other day would be best, and oftentimes daycares have package deals or monthly memberships. It may seem expensive, but it's a wonderful investment when you have a high energy dog.

So decide if you're able to dedicate time to this dog. It's entirely possible to give your dog her dinner frozen in a Kong while you tend to your housework or whatever you need to do. The most important thing is that you'll need to be doing less sitting on your butt watching TV, and more walks/hikes/jogs. ",2016-03-13 17:45:53+00:00,d0ydwcd,1.0,t3_4a8f1k,13267.0,Dogtraining

First, pick up [this](http://www.amazon.com/Positive-Gun-Dogs-Training-Sporting/dp/1890948330/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1457646719&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=positive+gun+dog+training) and [this](http://www.amazon.com/When-Pigs-Fly-Training-Impossible/dp/1929242441/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1457646751&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=when+pigs+fly).

My GSP is 5 years old, and is *insanely* independent outside. Inside, he listens so well I could probably train him to write my essays for me, but outside, holy crap, you'd think he were blind, deaf, and I didn't exist.

&gt;we used to have a rescue Weimaraner who we got when he was about 5 years old

Your first step is to stop comparing this dog to your last dog. Completely different breed. Completely different individual. Look at this dog with a fresh pair of eyes, and recognize that he's an individual, with his own needs, desires, and flaws.

You HAVE to keep him on leash, 100% of the time, unless you're in a fenced in area. That includes those open fields where you can still see him. Because all it will take is one bird to get him into trouble. Believe me. I have so many stories.

What we do for our GSP is we have 3 leashes of different lengths. A regular 6' leash for walks, a 15' leash for walks in fields/on trails, and a 50' leash for open fields and parks. This works out exceptionally well because we can control the amount of distance he has (and thus how much running and sniffing he can do), but still keeps him safe and in our control. Just be sure to use a harness with the longer leashes because your dog could very easily hurt himself if he goes darting to the end of the leash or gets wrapped around something.

Every single time he gets away from you, it's reinforcing the idea that he's *allowed* to go that far and chase things. Even if you started training recall like absolutely crazy, if he's allowed to get away and ignore your recall, he's learning he's not required to be near you or come back to you. This kind of freedom will only hurt your recall, and any future off leash training you may try to do.

This will also be exponentially harder as long as he's intact. Intact dogs wander, and if he ever senses a female in heat, you WILL lose him. He WILL disappear. And he could very easily get hurt or killed.

GSPs are very smart, but they're very independent dogs. They were pretty much built to run off and do their own thing, and then wait for you. But that doesn't mean his instinct is all you need for a well trained dog.

&gt;My dad is of the opinion that this behaviour is acceptable a) because he's a hunting breed so he's just following his instinct

And his instinct can *very* easily get him in trouble. Hunting dogs go through months and years of training before they're ever put to work. You can't just grab yourself a gun dog, wait until he's old enough, and then say, ""Well, now I have a hunting dog!"" No. You have a hunting *breed*, but you don't have a dog ready to hunt. He needs training, and lots of it.

&gt;because he's still a petulant adolescent

He'll actually get worse with age/experience because you're continuing to allow him to display unwanted behavior.

&gt;because 'he always knows where we are and always comes back'

He will not always know where you are, and he will not always come back.

Story time. We took our GSP to the dog park (he was about 2 years old) on a unseasonably warm January day. We were watching him run around the fenced-in park, when suddenly he saw some geese standing out on a frozen pond about 50 feet outside of the dog park. His *instinct* kicked in, he climbed the 5' fence, and ran out onto the ice. He fell through the ice. My boyfriend went after him, onto the ice, and as soon as he pulled the dog out of the water, the ice broke under him and he fell in. He had to be pulled out of the water and taken to the hospital. The dog knew where we were, but refused to come back because he wasn't done chasing the geese. Somehow, some firefighters finally managed to grab him.

Your dog will not always come back. And he will likely *never* come back when you actually want him to without training. 

Keep him on leash, start training, and make sure you and your dad are on the same page. If your dad is letting him off leash when walking him, he's going to ruin your training. I *highly* recommend you take a class together. You can find good trainers in your area on clickertraining.com and APDT.com.",2016-03-10 22:11:19+00:00,d0v9t4u,1.0,t3_49vkle,2792.0,Dogtraining
1768,"I have a fence jumper. 

Number 1 thing is supervision. NEVER leave him outside unattended. Ever. That even includes if you decide to use a tether since dogs can easily injure themselves on a tether.

Watch for that ""I'm going to climb this fence now"" glimmer in his eyes and get him back to you BEFORE he makes that decision. Watch for triggers. For my dog, he'll jump the fence if there are birds/animals immediately on the other side, or if I'm not in the yard with him when something startles him.

Number 2 (though a VERY important #2) is recall. There's a guide to teaching recall in the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/recall). It's important to remember to not try to assume his recall is good enough too early. Every time he's in a position to ignore your recall, it ruins the command. 

Number 3 is exercise and mental stimulation. He (most likely) climbs the fence because there are fun things on the other side. If you keep him tired and well stimulated, he'll have less of a reason to climb the fence.",2016-03-10 20:15:16+00:00,d0v4d02,1.0,t3_49v3kf,1798.0,Dogtraining

The point is you want to make *something else* more rewarding than the unwanted behavior, OR you need to manage the environment so that the bad behavior cannot become rewarding. 

So, with the garbage, unless you have some magical treat or toy, you're probably fighting a losing battle. With the garbage, you need to make it so the dog doesn't get into the garbage in the first place, so they can't practice the behavior.

But true ignoring becomes useful for other things, like jumping up to greet someone. Dogs jump because they want to greet you face too face and/or they're just so damn excited that they can't contain themselves. But, if you ignore the jumping (turn away from the dog so they're not rewarded with ANY interaction, positive or negative) and reward them with your attention when they are performing the desired behavior, such as sitting quietly, then you're successfully training by ignoring the unwanted behavior, and rewarding the correct behavior.",2016-03-09 23:48:06+00:00,d0u1chm,2.0,t1_d0u0q8h,984.0,Dogtraining
1779,"(I only skimmed the article because, well, I'm lazy)

I think it depends entirely on the dog and the way the marker is used/presented. 

I've seen +R trainers using pretty harsh NRMs (such as ""UH UH!"" and ""NO"") in their training classes and when running agility with their own dogs. But I've also seen trainers successfully train without NRMs. 

With my own dog (who is kind of a dunce, so I'm sure this doesn't apply to every dog), I have to find a good middle ground.

When I first started training my dog, the only classes we could find that were +R were at Petsmart. Our trainer was awful. She previously only trained horses, and with aversives/+P, before she did the training or whatever to be a Petsmart trainer. While everything she was teaching was +R, she threw in some ""illegal"" aversives, one being her version of a NRM. And, let me tell you, this was quite a negative marker. She wanted a very quick, harsh ""UH UH!"" and wouldn't drop the subject when we refused to use it on our dog. So we ended up using it (though much more gently) and, obviously, the dog reacted poorly. It's already very easy for him to shut down, so using a NRM was just flipping that switch and making class time pointless. 

However, when I finally introduced him to clicker training, he would absolutely shut down if he didn't understand what I was asking of him. He wasn't getting any feedback either way (because he couldn't figure out what I wanted), and so he shut down.

I had to reintroduce the NRM, but keep it within the realm of a very calm ""Close, but not quite."" I use a very short, quiet ""Ut"" sort of noise. It took a long time, but he grew to realize that it didn't mean, ""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, YOU HORRIBLE, AWFUL DOG?!?!"" but that it meant, ""You're getting there. Try again."" 

Long story short, I think it depends on the communication between owner and dog. I think some dogs, especially confident ones who LOVE to learn, can survive just fine without any NRM. 

Mine just happens to not like to learn, and not really like to please (honestly...he's a dud), so I had to tread lightly in that area and figure out how to effectively communicate with him. 

Does that make sense? Ironically, I'm having trouble communicating my point right now haha

Edit: Forgot to mention, I also phase out the NRM and just withhold reward. For example, as just happened right now, when we feed him, he's required to wait on the couch in a down position. When he's overly excited, he tries to cheat and his butt starts to creep up so he can pounce on his food more easily. To show him that I know he's cheating, I essentially freeze and give him ""a look,"" and his butt slowly hits the ground again. I don't have to use the verbal NRM in this case because he understands that I'm looking for a specific behavior, and he will not get to eat until he performs that behavior.",2016-03-09 21:53:57+00:00,d0twocv,1.0,t3_49pmty,9054.0,Dogtraining

Museums during the summer? Get there EARLY, before the park district summer camp groups get there. Go see the things you absolutely want to see, then work back towards the things you'd like to see, but wouldn't be upset if you missed. 

Outdoor venues, like Millennium Park? There will be kids, but it's usually not so bad that it'll hinder your experience. If you go in the evening, not only is it beautiful, but quieter.

Zoos? The Shedd? Good luck (at least during warmer months). During the winter, the zoo is EMPTY (best time to go!), but the summer? You'd have to be there right when they open the gates. Sometimes when storms are on the radar, the park district trips are cancelled, so if you're willing to risk getting wet (there are a lot of buildings), that would be a good day to go.

For food, hang around The Loop. Mostly tourists and businessmen/businesswomen. I highly recommend The Chicago Diner :) It's pretty rare to see kids in there, and when they are there, they're very well behaved.

The original study was based on captive wolves that were not related, nor were they familiar with eachother. Actual wolf packs do not behave that way in the wild. And even IF they did (which they DON'T), dogs are not wolves. Dogs were domesticated over thousands of years to work WITH humans. How would it make sense for an animal we domesticated to constantly be in some imaginary war with humans?

1842,"I think it depends on how much work you want to put in.

There's nothing wrong with seeking a different behaviorist if the current isn't working out. Even the Top 10 professionals in any field will have some failures.

Just like with humans, not every med will work for every dog. Maybe the Prozac isn't good enough.

I also personally wouldn't use a Gentle Leader with a reactive dog, but I'm not a professional, so speak with one about that (preferably a new behaviorist). If this guy isn't being helpful, then he's not the one for you. I don't know anything about your behaviorist, but based on what you've written here, I don't know that I like him too much. He seems a little dismissive. But that's just an assumption I'm making based on pretty much nothing.

Plenty of reactive dogs live happy lives without the dog parks and the long walks in the pretty park. It's not easy, but it's doable.

You can also get a bike lock to prevent the gate of the tennis court from opening.

But, if you're in over your head and exhausted mentally, physically, and financially, see if there are any lab rescues or rescues that take in rehabilitation cases that will take him.

1847,"Honestly, I'm not a behaviorist, but I think you may be seeing the more negative aspects of a cane corso (if that's really what he's mixed with). They can be dog aggressive, and aggressive with strangers. It *could* be something you may just have to manage unless you're willing to put in A LOT of work.

Now, almost everyone here will tell you to get rid of the choke chain (including me), but I think it's important to point out that unless you're using it *correctly* (which most people don't...it has to sit perfectly right behind the ears and the correction has to be perfectly timed) but also *consistently*. Having it on ""sometimes"" is literally doing nothing. You need to pick an actual training method and stick with it for weeks or months until you either start to see improvement, or you decide to try something else because there isn't even the smallest sign of improvement.

I personally like Zak George's leash method (YouTube), especially for high energy breeds. It's important to point out that timing is everything. I haven't watched his videos in a while, but if I remember correctly he doesn't do a fantastic job of mentioning that it's important to change direction BEFORE the leash is even tight. That's important. Treats aren't necessary for his method, though they'll help if you can find something he likes.

But it'll be very important for you to find a certified veterinary behaviorist or a very, very good trainer. Check out BAT training at even LAT (Look at That!) training. Keep calling around until you find someone who will work with you. If someone tells you they can't take on an aggression case, ask for referrals. Your goal should be to find a positive reinforcement trainer as aggression can get worse if you use punishment (including your choke chain).",2016-03-04 01:57:54+00:00,d0mtflk,1.0,t3_48urur,6925.0,Dogtraining

1856,"&gt;We've been giving him mostly diced up hot dogs and cheese for treats lately. He's pretty picky and won't eat crunchy treats

What you can do is put some of his food in a tupperware full of hot dogs and cheese (refrigerate it). The dry food will absorb the juices from the hot dogs and cheese, which will make it a little more interesting for training treats. 

&gt;It seems like the smellier it is, the more he loves it

That's the general rule with dogs, really. If it smells like absolute garbage, the dog will probably love it. And as long as it's okay to eat (no toxic ingredients like onion or chocolate) it'll probably be a winner.

&gt;He loves playing tug

Tug is an excellent way to wear him out. And if he likes it enough, you can actually train fetch that way as well. When you get the toy from him, toss it just a foot or two away from you so that he has to go get it, and then continue the tugging game. Whenever he lets go again, throw it again. Very gradually throw it further and further.

&gt;He tends to get worked up when he sees either of us getting ready to go out, but he loses his mind if we get ready in a weird way.

My dog had horrible separation anxiety when we first got him. It took a lot of work, but what helped a ton was finding something that he loved so damn much, he WANTS me to walk out that door. For him, it's tuna. So I mix tuna up with different things. Sometimes I freeze it if I'll be gone for longer than usual, but I only really need to get him interested enough in it that he doesn't care that I'm leaving.

How long are your walls? Walks are good, but it'll help much more if you're doing something that tires him out so he'll just want to sleep once you leave/he's done with his Kong. That downtime before you leave *might* be a little detrimental (since he's able to watch you get ready), but I'm not sure.

Also, along with this, is actually seems to help that I do things in a routine way, which is often not the case. If I get ready to leave in a specific order of events, he excitedly runs to his crate and waits for his Kong. If I randomly change what tasks I'm doing (like if I'm rushing) it stresses him out because he's not sure if *we're* going somewhere, if someone is coming over, or if I'm leaving.

1880,"&gt;The only thing I can think of that may have made it worse is having to segregate Thor from us to keep my son safe, which I feel makes the problem worse by making Thor resent my son more for being able to be with the family.

No, this actually is what you need to be doing. Your son is stressing your dog out, and the dog is doing the only thing it knows how to do to keep your son away (when he snaps, you take your son away, right? Snapping = kid goes away).

You need to keep them separate until your son is older. Every time your dog becomes stressed out by your son's presence, he builds upon the negative association he's already formed. Add in any panicking, yelling, and/or punishment you may or may not be doing when these events happen, and you're not doing your dog any favors.

It doesn't matter how gentle your son is, the dog still perceives him as a threat. Until your son is old enough to be taught dog body language/communication and learn to leave the dog alone when he's stressed, you need to keep them separate, or at least prevent your son from getting close enough to the dog to stress him out.

Dogs don't feel resentment. That's a human emotion that dogs aren't really capable of. They can form negative associations with people, but he can't grow to hate your son just because you need to keep them separate. Just make sure you're spending time with the dog, without your son around.

A trainer can absolutely help you, but you need to prioritize finding a **positive reinforcement** trainer.

1913,"First, good on you for doing your research and trying to change your mindset. We all know how difficult it is to change an ingrained behavior!

I'm on mobile, so I'll try to keep this brief.

Essentially, you want to look for ways in which you can reward the dog for doing the thing you do want him to do, and/or manage the situation so he can't misbehave. 99% of the time, if the dog is doing something wrong, it's actually your fault.

So, if he jumps up on you, train him to sit and then ask him to sit instead.

If he pulls on the leash, you haven't spent time training him, so you can't get mad at him for that. Pulling will occur until you teach him otherwise. And training needs to happen at **every single walk**, and consistently so.

If he's chewing on something he shouldn't be, redirect him to a proper toy and make sure you're putting everything out of reach or supervising him and stopping him before he ever gets the idea to chew on your couch or table. 

You're also bringing in a puppy. You're going to see some bad puppy behaviors, and some bad ""scared new dog"" behaviors. Just accept that, and remain positive. You WILL find pee somewhere. You probably WILL experience barking (especially the first time you leave him alone). You just have to address what you can as it comes up, and let some other things go until you've trained him.

Edit: Check out Zak George on YouTube. If I remember correctly, he used to use some P+ a long time ago. Now he's strictly positive reinforcement. He has very solid information for high energy dogs, which you will find yourself with.

And definitely find a good positive reinforcement class in your area. APDT.com and clickertraining.com have trainer search tools to help you.",2016-02-26 15:15:15+00:00,d0emizj,1.0,t3_47p8ou,2597.0,Dogtraining

The dog is going to be scared, and may exhibit some strange behaviors until he fully settles in. Just be positive and patient. No yelling or punishing, since these don't communicate much of anything to the dog anyway. Expect accidents.

1949,"&gt;I have seen zero improvement over two weeks.

It will take MUCH longer than two weeks.

You're starting 5 Steps above what he's ready for. You need to start in a very low distraction environment (like your living room) and gradually work up to more distractions. So, the sequence could be something like living room &gt; basement &gt; yard &gt; driveway &gt; sidewalk &gt; pet store &gt; empty football field &gt; dog park, depending on your dog. For example, with my dog, the pet store is much less of a distracting environment than even my backyard, so my order would change. 

Before you even start training, change your word and do your research (recall is REALLY easy to screw up). It's likely you've ruined your command word by allowing him to continue doing whatever he's doing after saying the word. You cannot say the word if you don't either have a way to reel him in and then reward (long leash and a harness) or know that he'll come back to you the first time you say the command. If you aren't in a situation where one (or both) of these is true, you are not in a position to train your dog at the moment. Right now, he's learned ""come"" (or whatever your word is) means ""Hey, come here if you want to. I have treats."" He needs to understand that ""come"" means ""Get over here now!"" So change your word and completely start over with your training.

Your rewards also need to be fantastic. You need to make it more rewarding to come to you than to sniff that tree or chase that squirrel. Make it a treat that he loses his mind for, but only gets during recall training. You'll have to play around with different options to see what he's obsessed over. 

Head over to YouTube and check out Zak George, kikopup, tab289, and Victoria Stilwell. All of them have recall training videos (and more!) and you'll get a good idea of where to start.

So you first avoided her, avoided her, and kept avoiding her, but never said anything...expecting her to just take the hint (which didn't happen...teens actually aren't fully capable of picking up on those sorts of things until they're young adults...brain development and all), and then just snapped at her?

You could have easily talked to her, said, ""Hey, my dog is in training, so we can't allow him to approach you or your dog,"" and she would probably have never tried again. 

It's also not her fault, thus she's not the one who should have been yelled at, that the dog is untrained. You could have also nicely suggested ways to teach the dog how to walk nicely on a leash.

But that may also not be something the family cares about. Some people just don't care if their dog pulls on the leash, and that's their choice. 

Or, maybe one of her parents are working on training, and the dog is using different equipment with the girl. If she's using a collar, maybe dad is training in a harness. Dogs can differentiate in that way.

I realized last night while watching the episode that Einstein and Miller *really* only exist because Scully needs someone to science with, and Mulder needs someone crazy enough to think like him and go rescue him.

But there's no reason Skinner and Reyes (or Doggett, if Robert Patrick had agreed to come back) couldn't have filled those roles. Scully seemed to really like Reyes (until she found out what Reyes had been doing for the last 14 years), and if I remember correctly, Reyes was competent enough to at least follow along with Scully's scientific babble.

And Skinner is a badass, and would have pulled the goddamn trigger.

1983,"&gt;But, is there any way to train him to the point that I can let him off again, despite his instinctive priority?

I truly believe any dog can be taught to be off leash. However, the means to achieve that could be beyond your capabilities. Definitely train a recall command, which will be super beneficial if there's ever an emergency and he gets loose.

So, if you're willing to put in the work, and you have the means to remain patient, consistent, and are willing to do your research and really understand how to accomplish off leash skills, you can get back to that ability. 

But ask yourself if it's so incredibly important that you do. While I fully believe any dog *can* become an off leash dog, I also strongly believe that not every dog *should* be an off leash dog. I believe there are far more important things to teach your dog (like emergency recall, basic obedience, etc.). Off leash reliability is a cool thing to have, but it's not for every dog. It would take one bird for me to never see my dog again (we lost him for 11 hours once, and he was found next to the tollway). That's not a risk I'm willing to take.

&gt;I enjoyed taking him to that trail so much, he got great exercise, adventure, and I got to enjoy the nature.

You can definitely still do this, regardless of whether or not you get his off leash training perfected. With my dog (who could NEVER be off leash) we use a 50' leash when we want him to have a lot of room to run, and a 15' leash when we want him to have room to sniff around, but can't allow him endless space. It works out really well, and he loves when he sees the 50' leash because he knows he gets to run around. Just use a harness with these since you don't want him injuring himself when he hits the end of the leash.

&gt;His lack of listening is crippling my ability to give him the exercise he needs.

There are tons and tons of dogs out there who absolutely cannot be off leash, and they're happy, well cared for dogs. Huskies and similar breeds are among those that, as a general rule, cannot be off leash. Yet, they're also one of the most high energy breeds. Their owners find other ways to exercise them. Off leash exercise isn't the only option for you. You just have to be creative and figure out what sorts of things the both of you enjoy.

Sounds like you might live in a heavily wooded area? Do you have a lot of deer? You can teach him to find antlers (which you can then sell, if you wanted). Or you can teach him to find truffles. You can take him hiking, or you can get some of [these](http://www.inlinewarehouse.com/Powerslide_Metropolis_SUV_All_Terrain_Inline_Skates/descpage-908074.html) and go nuts (don't have him pull you on rough terrain, but do allow him to run with you)! If he likes fetch or frisbee, get a 100' leash, take him to a football field, and play fetch. 

Think of an activity you want to do, and you can almost certainly do it with a leash.",2016-02-19 22:51:45+00:00,d06fs67,3.0,t1_d06f02h,1227.0,Dogtraining
1984,"&gt;I could let him off the leash on the trail I took him to daily, and he would follow and stick with me, and respond to my calls. However, he stopped responding to my calls, and now just runs off and doesn't come back.

This is likely due to age. Puppies typically stick around you and don't run off too much. But as a dog ages, they start gaining their independence. Coonhounds were not bred to really be off leash dogs. They were bred to go out on their own, find raccoons, and wait for you. Safest thing to do is to keep him on a leash (you can buy various sizes for different purposes).

&gt;He now barks uncontrollably at the cats, ignores my commands unless they benefit him (will only sit and stay, etc, if it means he gets a treat), and pulls without restraint on walks.

This is likely mostly due to lack of exercise and part of his genetics. Coonhounds bark A LOT. And I mean, A LOT. The humane society I got my dog from (not a coonhound) had A TON of coonhounds and the #1 reason they were all surrendered was because they barked too much.

Of course, you can train a ""quiet"" command, but you'll also just have to learn to accept the fact that coonhounds were bred to bark. They're intended to lead you to raccoons from long distances. 

Coonhounds require an hour or more of exercise, yes, but this isn't just an hour of walking. This is an hour of rigorous exercise. Start taking him biking or running (check with your vet to make sure he can handle exercise like this), get into nose work classes, and look into other dog sports he might like. 

You should also increase mental stimulation. Mental exercise is just as important as physical exercise, with the added benefit that it doesn't increase your dog's endurance like physical exercise does (you won't be required to add more and more exercise to keep him tired). 

Look into clicker training and feed all his meals that way. Get puzzle toys (like the Kong Wobbler), and play treat finding games (like hiding treats all over your living room). 

&gt;If I use treats, he just does what is required to get the treat, and goes back to doing the same thing.

This is actually a good thing. You have a food motivated dog that will still work while in high distraction environments. 

Training takes time, and you cannot expect fast results. The treats can eventually be phased out, but you're nowhere ready for that step yet. 

&gt;How do I go about regaining control?

I *highly* recommend you do three things.

1. Buy the book ""When Pigs Fly."" You should also head over to the recommend reading list (sidebar) and pick up some books. I highly recommend Patricia McConnell. 

2. Head over to YouTube and look up Zak George, Victoria Stilwell, kikopup, and tab289.

3. Find a good positive reinforcement training class. Bonus points if they use clicker training. APDT.com and clickertraining.com have great trainer search tools you can use. Classes should cost you about $100-300, depending on the class, but they'll be absolutely invaluable for you. Classes teach you how to teach your dog, and will help you understand your dog, build a strong bond, and address the issues you're seeing. Plus, training is a wonderful way to drain some of his energy. ",2016-02-19 20:18:59+00:00,d069jgb,1.0,t3_46mi99,865.0,Dogtraining

If CC wanted to scare some Americans, he could have done WAY better without using Muslims. If he wanted to show us, ""Hey!

SPOILERS, probably.

Episode 1: Aliums! Except, not? Mulder loses his shit, becomes more Scully-like. I don't know. It just didn't feel right.

Episode 2: same crap

Episode 3: I thought this was funny, and loved this episode, but let's be honest, the monster was pretty tacky.

Episode 4: This episode could have been SO GOOD, but another trash golem? Really? And his defining feature was a band aid? And then Scully losing her shit, not *really* because her mother just died, but because of her kid that SHE GAVE AWAY TO PROTECT, but she thinks she gave threw him away like garbage? WAY too forced. 

She's a doctor. She diagnosed Mulder with depression, which is why their relationship ended, pretty much. Yet she won't get into therapy or something to deal with her William issues? Isn't that like a MAJOR slap in the face for Mulder?

Episode 5: I always HATE when any show I like brings in new characters. Always. I usually come around to the good ones, but some I will ALWAYS hate and want nothing but for their world to burn (I'm looking at you, April from Grey's Anatomy).

This new Agent Einstein? My new April. I want to see her abducted and tortured. I hate how these agents are pretty much the extremes of Mulder and Scully.

However, you'll have to first address the off leash behavior of your dogs in the presence of people. I strongly recommend you find yourself a very good positive reinforcement trainer (APDT.com and clickertraining.com have good search tools) and start working on basic obedience. Once you have basic obedience down, you can move to off leash obedience.

I guess my problem right now is, does my dog really NEED medication? His anxiety isn't so severe that I fear he's going to have a heart attack, but concerning enough that, in addition to be really fucking annoying (details to follow), I feel horrible if I know he's home alone during a storm.

His triggers are thunderstorms (noise and sound, not static as far as I know. He doesn't freak out until he actually hears the thunder. If it's lightning only or just raining, he's *usually* tense, but okay), fireworks, and random noises that he wasn't expecting (like car doors slamming).

During storms, for example, he paces in a circle, won't sit down ANYWHERE, pants, barks (he's not a barker), and shakes/shivers so much that his hair falls out even if I've recently brushed him. He'll settle down during a storm if we can convince him to stay in bed and we spoon him, but during fireworks he's absolutely a mess and nothing helps until it's over (though we did have success this past July 4 with room darkening curtains, closing the windows, turning the AC on, and turning a bunch of loud fans on).

I know my vet would first tell me to use Zylkene (she suggested I try it anyway; she's a friend of the family) if I went to her for anxiety help.

It's noise and vibrations, as far as I know. Storms and fireworks are the worst, and he doesn't start panicking until he hears that first bit of thunder (so I know it's not the static electricity), but it can also be kids playing outside if they're making noises he's never heard before, or if something startles him like a car door slamming.

2181,"I lived just off campus (University Village on Providence) for 3 years (2011-2014). Walking to campus, I had to walk past all the Greek houses.

I honestly never had a single *positive* experience. It was always negative or neutral.

Some things that come to mind:

-Who the fuck is playing the bugle/trumpet at 5 am every morning? At first, I thought it was the ROTC students, but that building was way too far away for how close it sounded.

-Why, Why, WHY do you guys have to have loud parties ALL NIGHT on a goddamn Tuesday? Seriously. I can't tell you how many times I've heard drunken yelling at 4 am on a motherfucking Tuesday during the school year.

-WHY DO YOU HAVE TO SHOOT OFF FIREWORKS ON THOSE TUESDAY MORNINGS? WHAT IS THERE TO CELEBRATE? ""DUDE! I FINISHED MY HOMEWORK!"" NO.

-Why was it so funny to stick a dollar in a pile of *human* poop and watch as people went to pick it up? (Thankfully, I wasn't dumb enough to pick it up, but seeing 5 faces snickering out a small window gave you guys away anyway) And who was the lucky bastard that had to handle poop?

I don't think I ever had an issue with sorority girls, other than the shrieking (can we stop shrieking, please?) and the fact that the entire street smells like a bad perfume shop on Friday nights.

For me, I kind of look down on the whole thing, to be honest. I just don't see the appeal. I don't understand why some people think it's funny or cool to behave like animals. Don't you want to be viewed as mature adults? Did you get sick of people treating you like you were children in high school?

And it's not just that one guy. It's always a big group of guys causing the most problems. 

I loved Mizzou and Columbia, but dealing with Greek students was the worst part, by far. I paid $35k a year and I'd be more than happy to bump that up to $40k or something if it meant there was no Greek Life or the students had to be much more mature before they were allowed to join.

2187,"I'm on mobile, so I'll be very brief, but I feel like I can point you in the right direction.

As far as conflicting information goes, you're right, there's a TON of information out there! The key is to figure out what the general idea of the current knowledge says. So, current knowledge would include things like positive reinforcement, reward-based, and in many cases, negative punishment (removing/withholding a reward to decrease the occurrence of an undesired behavior). 

I understand you can't hire a professional, but you really need to make an effort to figure out how to. Your dog is in a state of fear. This is very much like if your child had a panic or anxiety disorder. You'd get your kid help, right? If you're in the US, look into CareCredit. I'm 90% sure they cover the costs of veterinary behaviorists, which is who you would ideally meet with. And even if you can't afford a behaviorist, a good positive reinforcement trainer and some personal research will take you a long way. A trainer will cost you anywhere from $100-300, depending on their demand. Don't cheap out here, but you also aren't expected to drop thousands of dollars on one. If you'd like, you can PM me your ZIP Code or city and I'll see if there are some trainers in your area I'd personally approve of (and I'm pretty picky!)

The position you put your dog in most likely isn't calming him. Look up ""Learned helplessness.""

If he's becoming reactive or nipping, you've pushed him too far. Avoid putting him in situations where he will act out. He's communicating his fear, even when he's biting. The fact that he's biting means he's been pushed WAY too far. You cannot let it get to that point, and that means avoiding people and situations until you've worked up to the point where you can start reintroducing those things.

Search his sub and wiki for discussions about counter conditioning. Your situation isn't uncommon, and you'll find a lot of great information if you're able to spend some time doing a bit of digging and reading.

There are great links in the sidebar, wiki, and past posts. The role you take is that of whatever you want to use to describe yourself, really. Caretaker, partner, friend, family member, whatever. For me, I view my relationship with my dog as that of a partnership or family. I don't need a hierarchy, because the concept is meaningless to me. I've set a few key boundaries for my dog, like don't chase the cats, but otherwise he's free to exist as he wishes (most of the time that's staring at birds out the window!)

But I HIGHLY recommend a positive reinforcement trainer. You're engaging in a brand new philosophy, and a trainer will aid you along the way.

Make sure you're making staying by your side (or just with a loose leash) rewarding. Use food or play to make it more beneficial for her to be in the correct position. Pulling ahead needs to have 0 benefit (moving forward continues to benefit her, so stop walking).

I like Zak George's leash walking method (YouTube) for high energy dogs. Check that out, go back a step in basic leash walking, and see if it changes at all. It will take consistency and time.

What it sounds like happened, and this happened with my mom's cats/dogs, is the dog got overly excited when the cat performed the behavior, and directs his excess excitement towards the cat in a negative way.

If your cat is scratching for attention, you scolding him is still giving him attention, so he still wins the game. You need to redirect the cat to an appropriate surface to scratch (cats scratch for a lot of reasons, including to stretch out and file their nails).

You need to stop scolding the dog and redirect him to appropriate behaviors or objects. Remove scolding and punishment from your arsenal and find ways to redirect the behavior or set your pets up for success.

2226,"You have two big issues here.

1. Unless you absolutely need to (and I'm talking NEED, not ""it's more convenient""), you should not be teaching your dog to pee indoors. This is insanely confusing for the dog, especially if you ever take him to pet stores or other people's homes. Not only that, but you're teaching your dog it's okay to go inside! He will never 100% understand he's only allowed to pee in the tray, which is why he's going wherever he wants. You NEED to take him outside. That's part of owning a dog.

2. Stop with the punishment and scolding. Dogs do not think in terms of right and wrong. They think in terms of what's most beneficial to them. So completely remove punishment from your training process and think of ways to always reward the dog for the behavior you want to see. If you want him peeing outside, reward him generously every time he goes outside, and ignore it/rush him outside if he's about to pee inside (ignore if the deed is done, there's nothing you can do at that point, take him outside when he's showing signs he might have to go). Your punishment is the reason he won't go in front of you guys. You've taught him that it's not okay to pee in front of people.

You have a matter of *seconds* for a dog to have a small CHANCE of understanding why he's being punished. That means, if you did not witness him peeing inside, punishing him is absolutely meaningless and just makes him think you're being an asshole for some other reason, such as sitting on his bed or chewing on a toy. That can cause a whole ton of other problems.

For the dog, they begin to believe that they're not allowed to pee in front of you, so they'll start sneaking off to pee, or will stop peeing outside if you're out there with them. Obviously, this is a problem. DO NOT PUNISH. If the dog pees inside, the fault is only your own as you were not watching for her signs OR waited far too long to take her outside (even if she's signaling reliably, you should still be taking her out regularly without her having to ask).

So, if you catch her in the act of peeing, interrupt her and take her outside immediately. No scolding, no startling, just an interruption. Then praise when she goes outside.

If the deed is done, you can do nothing except calmly clean it up and remember to take her out sooner next time. She's still very young, and you cannot expect perfect house training yet. 

Dogs don't think in terms of right and wrong. They think in terms of ""What is most beneficial to me?"" If she's rewarded heavily for peeing outside and ignored for peeing inside, she'll want to keep peeing outside. So keep rewarding every time she goes outside.

And stop using the crate to punish. Again, dogs don't understand punishment, so all she knows is that she's being locked in a crate. That's all she knows. Do it enough, and in a negative way, and she'll start avoiding all crates. 

Instead of thinking of ways in which to punish the dog, think of ways in which you can reward for the behaviors you want. Reward for peeing outside. If she is jumping on you, reward her for sitting instead. If she's chasing the cat, reward her for coming when you call her. Work on removing all sense of punishment (except for ignoring and withholding a reward; called negative punishment) from your training practices and you'll have a much happier, better behaved dog AND a much better relationship with the dog.

He needs much more socialization than this.

It doesn't work like that. In the *least* you need to find a puppy socialization class.

&gt;What would he learn that we can't teach him ourselves?

Training is easy now, but there may very well be commands that you struggle to teach, and you'll want a professional's guidance. He's a puppy now, so he looks to you for everything. Once he's the doggy equivalent of a teenager, he'll become much more independent and test his boundaries. He will regress in training. 

But, above all else, GSDs are very driven, motivated dogs. If you're not giving him a proper outlet for his drive and energy, he's going to be a nightmare, and he will be miserable.

Are you luring or trying to shape behaviors? If you're trying to shape behaviors, you may be starting out 10 Steps ahead of your dog. He doesn't yet understand the ""game"" of shaping. Start luring.

Also, keep in mind his physical limitations. You likely will not be able to teach him to sit because many greyhounds literally cannot sit like other dogs. You will have to teach ""down"" instead. But then you also need to remember that he might be very reluctant to lie down on cold or rough surfaces.

2304,"First, as far as off leash recall goes, you have a breed that was intended to more or less work alone. He was not bred to follow your commands or look to you for guidance. This may very well be a dog that you will never be able to have off leash, and there's nothing wrong with that. You just need to find other ways to exercise him that do not involve being off leash in open areas. Take him biking, running, hiking, and/or get a long leash (I use a 50 foot leash).

You have a very independent breed. It is not a biddable breed (doesn't live to work for you). You need to find what motivates him. This can be anything from a specific type of food, to access to the environment. I highly recommend you find the book ""When Pigs Fly,"" which will be invaluable to you.

Find a better trainer that has experience with difficult dogs. Positive reinforcement is the answer here. Think about it, if you shock your dog whenever he doesn't listen, why would he listen to you? You've given a dog that is already prone to not caring about you even more reason to not care about you. APDT.com has a good search tool that will allow you to find a positive reinforcement trainer in your area.

Rita is not a dog friendly dog, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. But you can't throw a puppy into the mix, who knows no boundaries, and get mad at Rita for it. Just like how sometimes you don't get along with other people, she doesn't get along with other dogs.

But the puppy is only learning all the wrong ways to interact with other dogs. You may very well be creating an aggressive dog.

And if your SO can't conduct herself properly around Rita, what is she going to do when the puppy starts hitting her teenage years? Puppies turn into monsters as they age, and if your SO can't remain calm and patient now, she's going to do the same with Rosie. The fact that you've had to tell her not to yell or hit multiple times is concerning.

2369,"I lived in Missouri for a few years in a college town with a MASSIVE Blues fan population. If I was wearing any Hawks gear, especially on a Hawks v. Blues game day or after we'd just beaten the Blues, it was likely someone would call me a bandwagoner (you stay classy, Blues fans). Much of this is probably because I'm female. Missouri doesn't have very many female hockey fans, or at least Columbia didn't.

Side note: Living amongst all of these drunk brodude Blues fans is what's made me HATE everything about the Blues. I want to see nothing but bad things happen to that team XD

But I was born in Chicago. I grew up in Chicago. I saved up my meager allowance and lunch money and bought my first jersey (Daze) when I was 12. 

So, it's whatever. *I* know I'm not a bandwagon fan. Plus, I don't think I'm really bothered by bandwagon Hawks fans. For one, a good chunk of those bandwagon fans may come to be true Hawks fans. Don't forget, hockey was pretty dead in Chicago until 2010, so it wasn't very easy to be a hockey fan unless you grew up with hockey.

I hope you never find yourself needing to submit an academic paper because they would laugh in your face for confusing such a simple, basic concept.

If you are ADDING a shock, it's positive punishment. Adding (+) punishment. It's as simple as that. The positive/negative has absolutely NOTHING to do with how the animal feels about it. The reinforcement/punishment is the ONLY part that has anything to do with how the animal feels about it.

This sub promotes positive reinforcement and negative punishment. Adding a reward (treats) when the dog does something good is positive reinforcement. Removing or withholding something from the dog to prevent him from repeating a behavior is negative punishment. You're removing (-) to punish. This is often done when you're trying to get your dog to stop jumping, for example. If the dog jumps, you turn away and don't make any contact or give the dog any attention. You're removing what the dog wants (attention, which would be a reinforcer) to prevent the jumping from continuing. 

You need to look past the conventional notion that positive is good and negative is bad because those definitions do not apply here. Look up ""Operant conditioning.""

You can't just use other people for your dog's entertainment. Working dogs go through years and years of intense training in order to do stuff like this.

I have a pointer. If I just decided one day I was going to teach him to point and used your cat, you'd probably be really fucking pissed.

If I was a resident in that property, and I'm leaving my apartment one night and have your dog come running up to me, off leash and barking, I'd be fucking pissed.

Third, look into doggy daycare in your area. Even if you can just get him in on days when you know grandma will be coming over, you can get his energy out OR, depending on the time of day, you won't even have him to be around to bother grandma.

I would also like to say that it's important for grandma to understand that this is your home, and this is how your choose to live your life.

Most aggression and reactivity is fear-based. She's afraid. As she goes through life fearing everything, that fear and resulting aggression will get worse. She won't just get over it. If she's afraid of large men, she will always be afraid of large men, unless you teach her and condition her to enjoy the presence of large men.

So, if I were in your position, I wouldn't avoid a good trainer simply because I couldn't afford it (believe me, I know all about not being able to afford things haha). It's just one of those things you need to take care of, just like if you had a sick kid. If you would literally experience financial ruin if you tried to hire a trainer, this dog is not for you (and you probably need to rethink owning a pet at this point in your life). It's better to realize now that you cannot handle a dog with special needs rather than waiting until her aggression/reactivity is so bad that you're forced to put her down (not a guarantee, but always possible).

Clickertraining.com and APDT.com have good tools to help you find a trainer in your area. APDT has an advanced search tool that will help you find a trainer that can deal with aggression. There is a link in the sidebar to help you choose a good trainer. Always, always remember that you cannot fix aggression with aggression. If the trainer you're interested in uses any methods that cause fear, pain, or intimidation in your dog, even if it's just a startling ""UH UH!"" type of noise, look for a new trainer. You need to look for a trainer that uses 100% positive reinforcement (and gentle, fair negative punishment, like withholding a reward). 

In my area, most trainers cost about $100-200. Not horrible. If you want, you can PM me your Zip and I can see if there are any trainers in your area that *I* would personally choose for my dog.

So, everything is scary. They're still learning what stairs are, what different environments are like, how to behave in a home, and how they're handled.

Even the ones that never end up racing still don't live in homes. 3 months in a foster doesn't help address everything. 

Patience is key. Don't force her to do anything. Keep everything positive. You can do things like sit on the couch with the harness near you and just feed her treats, gradually working up to putting it on her (at her pace!) She may even come around to the harness when she realizes that she gets to go on walks when it comes out.

Is the harness heavily padded? A basic nylon harness will rub and chafe, causing pain. This will not help her to view the harness as a positive thing. Make sure the harness is lined in something like fleece and will not cause problems with her delicate skin.

So, I spend a lot of time working on a loose/casual heel. I don't require him to lock eyes with me and stick to my side like glue, but I require that he not get too far in front of me and, most importantly, walk through the house. 

So, really, you can do whatever you want. If there's a new behavior or trick you want to teach, break it up into small sessions.

I was only enrolled in the math sequence because I've heard that Grad schools like a full calculus sequence for prior to applying to a CS program. But since I'm not planning on doing strictly a CS program, I don't think I have to worry about more calculus.

Part of the reason I like DePaul's program is because they don't require a GRE or letters of recommendation. I didn't do terribly in undergrad, but I didn't try hard. Only one or two teachers even knew my name, and the classes weren't even related to my degree (elective courses). It would be very hard to get into a selective school. But I'll definitely be applying elsewhere. I just believe DePaul will be where I end up going.

2554,"You don't really have a single behavioral problem here. What you do have is a human problem. You don't seem to understand dogs or training (that's okay! We all have to start somewhere!), and you have very, very specific expectations. 

Dogs are individuals. Not every dog will be your shadow. 

First, as /u/Sinkip said, dominance theory is bullshit, and you need to remove every single ""pack leader"" idea from your mind immediately. Absolutely nothing good can come from trying to establish dominance, and you are actually creating a dog with real behavioral problems. 

Let's break this all down :)

&gt;she is not afraid of loud voice, gestures and even loud sounds, there is no way to make her be scared

You DO NOT want your dog to fear you. This is a horrible thing to do to a dog. Would you want your children to fear you? The fact that you have a chihuahua that isn't afraid of anything is absolutely wonderful! Chihuahuas can be quite timid little dogs. Do not try to break this dog.

&gt;it is not possible to have her lie on back or hold still

Stop doing this. This is one of the quickest ways to create an aggressive dog.

&gt;always gets to the highest possible spot

There's nothing wrong with this unless you don't want her on the furniture. This has absolutely NOTHING to do with her trying to dominate you. This is about her wanting to see what's going on, wanting to be on your level to interact with you, and wanting to avoid being stepped on.

&gt;may stay 8 hrs at home and there is no evidence of ""desperately"" missing me

This is actually a wonderful thing. Take a minute to go through the past posts on this sub just from the last week. Do you realize how many separation anxiety posts we see here every week? I have a dog with separation anxiety, and it's a horrible thing to try to combat. Consider yourself lucky that your dog isn't desperate to see you!

Don't take it so personally if your dog isn't bouncing at your feet and barking her face off whenever you walk in the door. If you've been practicing dominance theory and trying to make her fear you all this time, it's no wonder she doesn't seem excited to see you! If you want her to be happy to see you, you need to treat her positively!

&gt;always ""tail high"" and chest forward pose

This is meaningless. 

&gt;no reponse to commands whatsoever even ""come"" except for the name if she knows she's gonna get something yummy

What reason have you given for her to come to you? Have you actually trained a good recall in a positive and effective way? Probably not! She's also a puppy! She's going to test her limits. If you haven't spent time training her, she doesn't know what the command means. You can't get mad at her for that.

&gt;no barking

I have a 6 month old chihuahua puppy. Count your lucky stars that she hasn't figured out barking yet. Oh my god, so much barking.

&gt;doesn't like cuddling

Not all dogs like to cuddle, especially not when you've spent 3 months trying to establish yourself as a ""pack leader."" You are literally damaging your relationship with this dog by doing this. Puppies in general don't often like to cuddle. They'd rather go out and explore things and do their own thing. As she matures and the puppy stage ends, she may become that velcro dog you're looking for.

&gt;steps out when trying to place a hand on the head

This is actually pretty confrontational for a lot of dogs. Most dogs don't like people approaching them in this way, especially not when you're 100x their size!

&gt;I doubt if I can turn her in a loveable, sweet puppy that loves me

Because you've simply approached the issue in the absolute worst way. Get your butts into a positive reinforcement group class. Positive reinforcement and clicker training are absolutely fantastic ways of building a strong bond with your dog. A stronger bond means a relationship in which she WILL be more likely to listen to you and cuddle with you.

Check out clickertraining.com and APDT.com to find good training classes in your area. You should also check out Zak George, kikopup, tab289, and Victoria Stilwell on YouTube. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/books) is an extensive book list for you.

So before you do some serious damage to this dog, stop everything and do your research. Look at the links I've shared with you, go through the wiki, read past posts, and PLEASE remove every training idea you have from your mind. There's a TON you need to learn, but you CAN have the dog you're looking for if you start over.",2016-01-03 21:24:01+00:00,cykr3dl,1.0,t3_3zag6x,15841.0,Dogtraining

They simply cannot be in the presence of other dogs. But that doesn't mean they're necessarily lacking anything. Spend time doing other things with your dog. 

If you still find yourself in a situation with a dog, do the best you can. Remain calm. If it's a loose dog, try scaring it away and just working your way home. Avoid going to places with a ton of dogs.

2561,"&gt;I've immediately pulled her away on her leash and chastised her, told her that she was being bad

Stop doing this. This teaches her that there IS something to hate about seeing other dogs. Dogs don't understand punishment like we do. *We* think we're teaching our dogs that reacting that way is bad, but what we're actually teaching them is that seeing other dogs means bad things are about to happen.

Punishment is largely ineffective in general. You need to stop putting her in situations in which she'll feel the need to react. The fact that she's getting close enough to react and display aggressive behaviors means you're failing to manage the situation. From now on, when you see another dog you're about to encounter, calmly turn around or go across the street. Do not let her interact with strange dogs.

I have three family members that work different, non-medical positions for a large animal hospital. I worked there as well for a short time, and another family member worked there for a couple of years. We know a lot of vets, and are given a ton of information. 

I can tell you first hand that vets are fed a TON of information and marketing from major food companies, like Hill's and Purina. These companies throw big seminars, have meetings/lectures, and give out free crap. Everyone loves free crap.

But you know what happens when companies give out free crap? They're building positive associations with the company for these vets. Look at the food the vet stocks, and I bet you they'll be recommending that brand. The place my family works at stocks Hill's. An animal hospital I used to go to stocked Royal Canin. 

Is it convenient? Yes. But every vet will have a different recommended brand. But what you should be choosing is what works best for your dog.

If your dog does best on Orijen, feed Orijen. If your dog does best on shitty Iams, feed shitty Iams (except don't. I'm just making a point). My dog has a sensitivity (not allergy) to chicken and white potatoes. He does best on Zignature. Our vet told us to try Hill's, and we did. Not only was he experiencing digestive issues, but we had to feed him SO MUCH per day because of all the fillers and empty calories.

So I stopped using it, and use incompatible behaviors instead (if my dog is jumping, I tell him to sit). When it comes to my dog doing the incorrect behavior (like if I ask him to sit while putting on his harness and he's still continuing to bounce around), I use a very soft, but audible (""uh uh"") and wait for him to do the right thing. My negative marker is never jarring or punishing because 99% of the time my dog is misbehaving is MY fault, not his, so I shouldn't be punishing him.

So, I am of the belief that a negative marker is unnecessary and just continues the idea that our dogs need to be punished, even mildly.

That being said, I know several people who want pure bred dogs. When I tell them to just go to a shelter or rescue group because they have that breed, they decide against it because for the $500 adoption cost, they can be THOSE people and go to Petland to get a puppy for the same price.

And if it's a kill shelter, even very low kill, you aren't doing the dogs or cats any favors by making adoption fees that expensive.

When we adopted our dog, we stopped at the humane society while we were actually waiting for the time to come for us to meet a dog at a foster home. We were just trying to waste some time, and were planning on getting this foster dog with a different organization.

We fell in love with one of the dogs at the humane society, and decided to cancel the meeting with the foster home. The adoption fees with the rescue group were $300. The adoption fees at the humane society? $40. We had the money, but it was easier for us to hand over $40 rather than $300, and then we were able to buy higher quality dog food and more toys than we had planned.

We didn't want to spend much, but our dog is insanely well cared for. I buy more stuff for him than I do myself. And I think the amount of animals ending up with crappy owners is smaller than you'd expect. They won't all be star owners, but they won't all be running dog fighting rings either.

If you want to see a positive turnover rate within the shelter, you're not going to do that with $500 adoption fees. That humane society we got our dog from is having $2 adoption fees this weekend! Hopefully tomorrow they release a statement saying how many animals were adopted.

2693,"&gt;she cajoled me into getting a prong collar

That's what I had assumed would have happened based on how you described the trainer.

A prong collar does not actually teach your dog anything. Some dogs can also develop reactivity and aggression issues because they don't understand that the pain is occurring because they're pulling on the leash. All they know is ""I experience pain whenever I see another dog. This dog must be causing me pain."" I *highly* recommend you take the prong collar off and focus on positive reinforcement.

&gt;The walks was during the hottest of the summer. We would get there and he would collapse. I always kept him hydrated

Once summer comes around again, I would look into getting a cooling collar or vest. For the winter, get him a coat and some good dog boots (the salt they use on icy sidewalks can damage a dog's paws).

Pits are very intelligent dogs and often very easy to please. In my opinion, using aversive methods (like a prong collar) is very much like bullying the nerdy kid in high school to get him to do your homework. You can achieve SO MUCH with positive reinforcement and clicker training. Clicker training is also fantastic at providing mental stimulation for your dog, which will help tire him out. 

As far as durable dog toys goes, look into Kong, Starmark, and Kyjen, but only use the Kyjen toys while he's supervised because they can be destroyed.",2015-12-11 22:43:52+00:00,cxvv5qm,3.0,t1_cxvu8d0,1565.0,Dogtraining

My reasoning is this: the walk is more for the dog than it is you. Sure, it's good for your health, but if you didn't have the dog, would you be walking that route every day? Possibly, but probably not, right? The walk is for the dog, and if that's how he wants to do it, then let him. 

Now, obviously, there will be times where you need him to go faster, like if you're in the parking lot of a pet store or something. Does he respond at all if you get all excited and start jogging? I'm not saying run him the entire time, but see if he perks up and gets his little legs moving if you make the walks exciting and quicken the pace.

2696,"See if the spay/neuter clinic offers vaccines (all the ones in my area do, but I know that's not universal). Some humane societies, shelters, and even animal control might offer low-cost services, too. 

(If you're in the US, and maybe Canada) Petco and Petsmart also have low cost vaccination clinics. This is what I use. It's about $100 for all basic vaccinations, plus a heart worm test and a tick panel, and then you get a discount on heart worm medications ($50 for a year, I think?)

&gt;I was looking for personal recommendations that you might have missed teaching your pups and regretted, too.

The #1 thing for me, and my post history will reflect this haha, was teaching recall and loose leash walking. These two things are my dog's number one downfall, and had I found a very good trainer as soon as I saw a problem, instead of just going with the cheap Petsmart training option, I'd probably be in a much better place as far as training goes. But my dog is also...unique, and most other people don't have as hard of a time training recall and loose leash walking.

You should check out clicker training, if you're not already, and start throwing some fun tricks in there to build confidence and attention. Our training suffered at first because our trainer only taught the basics and our dog wasn't having fun. As soon as we threw in those stupid tricks, like crawl and ""paw,"" our dog starting having much more fun training and it was easier to teach the basics because he was more willing to work with us.

House training takes time and consistency. Two accidents in two months is a good sign that you're on the right track. Keep up what you're doing and you'll see improvements. Just think, it's entirely possible that the very last accident he had will be the last for a long time (barring any health problems)!

&gt;He's afraid that Hiro will run into our TV and damage it

Mount the TV on the wall or get a really good TV stand. My SO was always afraid that our dog would knock over the TV, so we got a very sturdy entertainment unit from IKEA and have yet to have an issue. We got [this one](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/30285153/) about a year ago and it's been fantastic so far. 

Pits require a lot of exercise and mental stimulation. They're strong, powerful dogs. Look into puzzle feeders and mental stimulation games (there are a ton of past posts on this if you do a little digging), and figure out a better way to exercise him. 

&gt;but it was a 5 mile walk to her and hiro couldn't do it anymore 

He couldn't do it anymore because of the walk? Or just because she moved? Honestly, a 5 mile walk before a training class would do you wonders. That 5 mile walk, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, would do a lot to get him to settle down in the house. Sounds like a ton of walking, but it'll help a lot.

But in the end, mental stimulation is far more important.

You should also check out Rover.com to see if there are any people in your immediate area that offer a small, in-house doggy daycare with a fenced yard so he can run around, especially when you're at work, assuming he's good with other dogs.

I would also check out Zak George on YouTube. He has very good advice for high energy dogs. 

&gt;Anyone know a good method of teaching pit Bulls?

Be careful with breed-specific training. In some cases, and if I remember correctly, there's a trainer in Chicago who does this, finding pit bull-specific training will lead to some questionable trainers. I don't know if this guy is still in Chicago (can't find his website with a quick search), but he was VERY heavy on positive punishment, which is completely unnecessary (see the sidebar link about LIMA and the wiki).

2699,"&gt;since she has no medical history I hesitate to take her to the local dog park

She should be taken to the vet as soon as possible if she hasn't gone yet, *especially* if she's interacting with other dogs. She can give other dogs worms or other parasites, or she could contract diseases if she hasn't been fully vaccinated. 

In all honesty, I think the very best thing you can do in this situation is get your boyfriend (and whoever else is interacting with the dog on a regular basis) into a positive reinforcement training class. 

My boyfriend had owned dogs when he was growing up, but his family never trained them. When we got a dog together, I started showing him how to train a dog, but he wasn't really ""getting"" it. So we enrolled in a class, and it was smooth sailing from there (for the most part). He was able to learn from the instructor, and learned how to troubleshoot setbacks and behavioral issues from the feedback given to other owners.

Plus, you'll be able to socialize her much more in a group class. APDT.com and clickertraining.com are fantastic resources to find a good trainer in your area.

Just the other day, I had to bring one of my mom's dogs in for vaccinations. This dog is small, but can get aggressive. The vet and vet tech worked at the dogs pace.

The fact that the vet dismissed you and then made you feel like a bad owner makes them a bad vet. They should know better.

Personally, I would never recommend a pit or pretty much any other bully breed to the inexperienced owner. They're fantastic dogs, but they are terriers and they can be a nightmare if not handled properly. They need an insane amount of exercise, they have a prey drive, and there's the potential that they're dog aggressive or reactive. It's just not the type of dog for a first time owner.

As an inexperienced owner, would you be able to handle a special needs dog like this? You would need to make sure he can't escape your house or yard, you'd have to throw a ton of money at a really good behaviorist, you'd probably want to muzzle him if he goes out into public, and especially muzzle him if you're going to the vet, finding boarding for him if you ever need to go on vacation will be pretty impossible and if you have someone come by during your vacation you have to be absolutely certain they won't let him escape...it's a nightmare.

I've changed majors...8? times, and I'm still in school trying to figure my shit out. 

Like you, I was choosing majors based off of things I found interesting, yes, but also because I wanted to make money. Plus, with the amount of student debt I've accrued while trying to figure myself out, I NEED to make money. But I was never choosing fields I was passionate about (mostly because I like a little bit of everything, but I don't LOVE anything). 

In the end, I graduated with a BA in Psychology, not wanting to do ANYTHING within that field, and now I'm toying around with different career fields.

My advice to you is to finish your current degree, but spend your last semester taking classes you want to take because you're interested. If you need to take another year, go for it! There's no shame in taking 5 years to finish. You could always tell your family you're going after a minor or certificate, which takes more time.

2739,"After reading your post and comments, I have to say (reluctantly) that euthanasia is your best option.

Do not take offense to what I'm about to say, but it sounds to me like you and your family are all inexperienced dog owners. That's okay! We all have to start somewhere. However, this dog is NOT the dog for inexperienced owners. Inexperienced owners make mistakes. With a non-aggressive dog, mistakes can often just be forgotten about (to a degree). But with a dog-aggressive dog, a mistake can be fatal. An aggressive dog needs to be handled with kid-gloves. If you do something like lose your cool and start yelling at him, or think ""We're only going on a short walk down the street. We don't need a muzzle,"" you're going to find yourself in a bad situation.

And you know what happens when you find yourself in a bad situation? It doesn't end well for the dog. 

Let's say your dog gets loose, ends up going after another dog, and kills it. What's going to happen is the dog will either be removed from your care by animal control and euthanized, taken to animal control and stuck in a dog run for weeks or months while lawyers and everyone involved figures out what should happen to this dog (often just euthanized anyway), or, if the dog is still at large when the police show up (and they will. People love calling the cops on pits because of all the media hype and poor portrayals of the breed), they'll probably just shoot him. All of those things result in a terrified, and then dead dog.

OR, you can do the humane thing and euthanize him. Where he's surrounded by his family. 

But, if you and your family want to keep him (this is really up to your parents, since it sounds like you're a minor?), it's going to take a HUGE amount of effort from ALL of you, and it WILL cost money. Good behaviorists are not cheap. You literally cannot afford to be cheap with this sort of thing. Your parents need to make a financial commitment to helping this dog, or you'll be right in the same place again. 

But it does not sound to me like you're capable of handling a dog with these sorts of special needs. I consider myself an experienced dog owner, but I know I could NEVER handle a dog like this. I don't have it in me to do it. But other people ARE able to handle it, and that's great. 

Show all of these comments you've received to your parents. There are very valid points on both sides of the debate. But in the end, it's not your job to convince them. It is your parents' decision. ",2015-12-07 17:38:27+00:00,cxqgcc3,1.0,t3_3vrhgn,38283.0,Dogtraining
2740,"So, the [link](http://www.whole-dog-journal.com/issues/18_9/features/Rocket-Recall_21300-1.html) that /u/hammy-hams posted pretty much outlines the bulk of what I was going to say to you.

-NEVER punish your dog for not coming the first time. This includes things like leashing him up, taking him home, or showing your frustrations. Now, of course there will be times where you need to leash him up for whatever reasons, and there will be times where you need to leave so you need him to come to you. That's fine, but limit the amount of times you do this. As I said, recall is VERY easy to damage.

What I do with my dog when we need to leave is I'll do a few recalls and releases, allowing him to go back to whatever he was doing, and then I'll do a final recall, throw an absolute party, and then leash him up to leave. 

-Don't overuse your recall. He needs to come to you the first time you say it. Don't just repeat ""Come. Come! COME!"" as he ignores you. If he didn't listen the first time, he's not going to listen. Figure out a new way to get him, whether that's walking over to him and grabbing him (nicely, and as if he's done nothing wrong) or running away so he chases you.

This also applies in the house. We actually just had to change our recall word because we were using ""Come"" WAY too often, allowing him to ignore us. At night, our dog turns into a lazy pile of goo, and he refuses to move unless we're taking him outside. So we'd call him to us (to give him food, to play with him, whatever) and he'd ignore us. He learned that ""Come"" means ""Do what you want,"" instead of ""Return to me instantly."" So now we have to change our command and use it ONLY when we know he's going to return 99% of the time (this also means some retraining). 

-PRACTICE. You need to start in the house, then move to your yard, then your driveway, then maybe the pet store, then a really boring park, etc. before you can EVER expect him to come at the dog park or while hiking. And this means don't throw him in the deep end. If you're in an area where you know his recall is going to be horrible, and you're not at that ""step"" in his training yet, don't attempt it. If you're at the dog park, but he's just barely reliable in your yard, he's not ready to practice recall at the dog park. Just allow him to do his thing and don't put him in a position to ignore you or fail.

-It should ALWAYS be fun. If you're getting frustrated, or he's getting bored and more prone to ignoring you, training is over. His recall has to make him want to ignore birds, squirrels, cats, and other dogs, and if it's not fun for him, he's not going to want to do it. If that cat he sees is more exciting than whatever you have to offer, why would he come to you?

So, I guess I didn't really have a step-by-step process for you, but more of Do's and Don'ts. Recall as a concept is actually pretty easy, but in practice can be difficult. 

I recommend looking up kikopup, Zak George, tab289, and Victoria Stilwell on YouTube, as they all have recall videos to check out.",2015-12-07 17:16:01+00:00,cxqfeio,7.0,t1_cxpgaq4,73560.0,Dogtraining
2741,"That's what I thought about my trainer at first. She seemed to know what she was talking about, seemed positive reinforcement all the way, and wanted to see our dog succeed so she offered us free private lessons and allowed us to come in to practice around distractions. But then she began letting us down and it was apparent that beyond the very, very basic information, she didn't know what she was doing and just wanted to resort to the fastest results, rather than the most ethical process. 

Since he's so smart, see if you can find a training facility that does everything from basic obedience to dog sports like agility and flyball. In my experience, it seems any organization that also does complex training, such as for agility, realizes that positive reinforcement and clicker training are the most effective and safest ways to teach a dog. It's very rare that I come across a place that uses positive punishment if they also train for dog sports. ",2015-12-07 16:27:26+00:00,cxqdfw6,3.0,t1_cxqd06x,672.0,Dogtraining
2742,"First, ditch the trainer. Even if everything else they do is something you feel comfortable with, the fact that they resort to a slip or martingale, instead of looking at other leash training options (there are more methods than just stopping) is a red flag to me. Our last trainer wanted to put a choke chain on our dog because he didn't respond to the stop-and-stand technique. We refused, and I later learned that she wasn't qualified enough to be able to work around ANY difficult situations. So find a new one. APDT.com and clickertraining.com have great trainer search tools.

Second, while your vet is great with medical advice, most vets aren't so great with behavioral advice. It would be like going to your family doctor to get therapy. It's not what they specialized in, and it's not what they're familiar with. If your breeder is a reputable breeder (not a backyard breeder), they're going to have a lot of good advice. But your best bet is a good positive reinforcement trainer.

Next, like you read, [your dog is at risk for serious injury](http://clicktreat.blogspot.com/2012/06/is-it-harmful-to-attach-aleash-to-your.html?m=1) but you're also hurting your dog's trust in you. Dogs don't understand punishment like we do. He doesn't know WHY he's getting leash corrections. He just knows you're being a jerk.

Martingales aren't really the best training tools. They're much better for dogs who can slip out of a collar. I have one on my dog. The limited slip prevents them from choking, but they still convey very, very little information from your dog. Dogs learn best when they're told what to do, not what not to do.

I love [Zak George](http://youtu.be/jBN2_YuTclU?list=PLMssKIjsDxXkZk77nE0r0sdPoTuuDo-Oh) for everything herding/high energy breeds. Most of what he does is geared towards the high energy dog. He has border collies, so he knows how to handle that level of crazy. He's very good for the basics, but once you get past that, there's a whole new level to dog training. But start there :)

You also have to remember, you have a 6 month old puppy. Puppies are assholes, and you absolutely cannot expect good behavior from them. It takes a lot of training to have a well behaved dog, and it's unfair to him to start resorting to aversive treatment while he's still learning. You have an insanely intelligent breed. Take advantage of it! He's insanely smart, and using harsh methods on him is exactly like the bully beating up the class nerd.

Poke around on the wiki, sidebar, and old posts on this sub. You'll find a TON of information :)

Edit: Also, it doesn't matter what sort of tool you use, you still have to actually train him to do what you want. Tools just allow you to better manage the situation, but they don't actually teach your dog anything. This also means you can, theoretically, use whatever harness or collar you want.

My dog failed on every single no-pull harness. He completely worked against them, causing injury and wounds, leaving the situation worse than it was before. Then I got a sled dog harness, which was designed for pulling, and he walks so much better than the no-pull harnesses. It's not perfect, but we're making a lot of progress, and he's WAY better than he was on the first walk we ever took him on when we rescued him.

Find what you want to use, and then train him. If you want to use a heavily padded harness you found at Petsmart, do it and train him. If you want to use a Freedom No-pull harness, do it and train him. It's up to you, and entirely dependent on the amount of work you put into it.",2015-12-07 15:49:30+00:00,cxqbzs3,1.0,t3_3vspaj,2563.0,Dogtraining

2804,"My opinion is this:

Regardless of whether or not you believe in their training philosophy (or lack thereof), and whether or not they believe in yours, there needs to be consistency across the board, at least for your dog. Whatever it is you want for your dog, they need to respect that and follow your protocol. 

Have you actually sat down with them and explained to them WHAT they should do, HOW, they should do it, and WHY they should do it your way? If you're just going at it with an attitude of ""You're wrong and your dogs are monsters,"" they're going to get defensive and they're not going to work with you. But if you sit down, have a civil conversation with them, and help them to understand what you want from your dog, then they'll be a little more likely to help you out.

Your husband also needs to be on board. This is his family, and he needs to let them know it's unacceptable to go behind your back to fill their own ""agendas.""

Discuss what you want from your dog, and what they want from their dogs. If they want their dogs to be rewarded for breathing, let them. If you don't want your dog being rewarded for nothing, they need to respect that.

Now, while we're on the topic of each party's training method, there are aspects where you are right, and aspects where they are right.

It's perfectly acceptable, and not at all detrimental to training, to treat your dog for no reason once in a while. Now, if the dog is doing something like jumping up or another unwanted behavior while being treated, the dog can learn to repeat that behavior to try to get more treats. But if the in laws are treating your dog while sitting or lying down or some other behavior you'd like to see more of, by all means, allow them to treat your dog. In fact, you can say to them, ""I'm fine with your giving my dog treats, but please ask her to sit/lay down/roll over/whatever first.""

As far as grandma letting her out to get the paper, that needs to end OR grandma needs to work on recall. The BEST way to build a great recall is with treats, so the dog SHOULD be given treats for coming back in, but the treat needs to be ready to be given immediately upon the dog's return.

&gt;she knows how to do this and she should not still need treats to follow through

Even if she's 10000% reliable in a command, she should still be rewarded occasionally so that following the command is still rewarding enough to her to want to make the effort. If she isn't rewarded EVER for ignoring those tempting squirrels, those squirrels will eventually win over coming back to you.

All that being said, it sounds like you still have a lot to learn about *effective* dog training, and I don't mean that as an insult. Just based on the information you've given and your vocabulary, it doesn't sound to me like you're really up to date on the best way to train a dog. For that, I recommend you poke around the wiki and the sidebar of this sub.

So, are you totally wrong? No. But they're not completely wrong either. The biggest issue here is that nobody is being consistent or respecting the other party. They think you're full of crap, and you think they're being ignorant.

For me, it's a moral issue. I hate people. I've always hated people. I've always loved animals.

So, in this modern day, if there is a more ethical way to exist in this world, why wouldn't I do it? Why contribute to the harm the beings I connect with the most in this life?

Could I be doing a better job? Yes, of course. One of my favorite items is my pair of leather boots (though I bought these second-hand). If I planned my meals and budgeted better, I could probably afford to go fully vegan. If I had more self control, I would opt to cook my own meals instead of ordering a pizza.

My youngest sister just became 100% vegan a few weeks ago, practically overnight. I respect her for that. When I was her age, I did the same, but I eventually shifted back to just vegetarian.

So, for me, it makes sense to me that someone with this personality type is or is considering vegetarianism.

2850,"&gt;Like with infant humans they have benchmarks for approximately when they should be walking, talking, etc

Humans and dogs cannot be compared in this way.

For babies, those are developmental milestones. Humans are born entirely dependent on their parents, and gradually develop the ability to walk, talk, and fend for itself. That's a survival aspect.

For dogs, things like sit and stay are learning milestones. A dog can survive perfectly fine never being taught how to sit or stay on command. The world won't go up in flames if a puppy doesn't learn how to sit until he's 9 months old. Think about shelter dogs. My dog was a puppy at some point, but didn't learn how to sit until we adopted him when he was 2 years old. 

Nothing bad will happen if your dog learns one thing before another. Training needs to be done at his pace, not yours. Maybe sit will take a really, really long time to master, but he picks up stay like it's the easiest damn thing in the world. That's okay!

2858,"Chihuahuas are interesting little things. They think they're guard dogs. I live with a 6 month old chihuahua, and he barks CONSTANTLY.

The biggest thing is to make sure he's getting enough exercise and mental stimulation. He won't bark if he's tired. But this also means I have to get him tired early in the day, so that might mean you have to wake up early.

The other thing is simply getting him used to common triggers. I live in a full house, and everyone is always coming and going. Two of my siblings don't live with us. When my sisters come over, he only barks for a few seconds before he's happy to see them because he knows they're not threatening. My brother, however, is pretty much an animal hater, so he ignores the dog. When my brother comes home (he lives with us), and especially when he brings his girlfriend over (who also ignores him), the dog barks his face off because there's been no positive interaction in the past to let him know things are okay.

So, exercise him well, keep him mentally stimulated, and create positive exposures for him. Pretty much just follow protocol for socialization, which you can find in the wiki.

Edit: And don't scold or hit him. That's the complete opposite of a positive interaction, and you're actually teaching him that bad things happen when he sees one of his triggers. He's doing what dogs do. He doesn't understand he's being hit because he's barking. All he knows is that when he sees that neighbor, he gets hit. When he sees another dog, he gets hit. When he sees that kid on a bike, he gets hit.

If he was truly aggressive, you would have known immediately.

It's also important to remember, that with a background such as his, combined with a severe lack of exercise and stimulation, as well as being in a brand new home, he's going to be displaying some scary and confusing behaviors for a little while.

2898,"First, forget about being an alpha. That is a very outdated, unscientific way of thinking, and trying to ""establish"" yourself hurts more than it helps.

Second, you have to seriously evaluate your life/lifestyle/time/needs and decide if a time-intensive dog is best for you and your family. We can spew out all kinds of training advice and link you to every video on YouTube, but if you and your husband are not on the same page, it will be remarkably harder to fix your problems. 

GSDs are very, very driven dogs, and they NEED a job to do, lots of enrichment, and lots of exercise. You have a young child and a husband who is being less than helpful. Do you see your circumstances improving within this dog's lifetime?

It's perfectly fine to admit that this dog is too much for you. It's far, far kinder to relinquish this dog to a breed specific rescue (**not the pound**) where he'll have an opportunity to live the life he deserves. As long as you're unhappy, he's unhappy, and that's not fair to anyone.

If you and your husband are ready to step up and make the commitment this dog needs, the very first thing that needs to happen is figure out how you're going to exercise him. Even the most well trained dog will find it impossible to behave if he's not being exercised. So figure out what you're going to do. Take him jogging, biking, get into dog sports, get a flirt pole, play fetch...find something you guys enjoy doing and do it.

Then, find yourselves a good **positive reinforcement** trainer. Go to clickertraining.com or APDT.com and find a trainer in your area. 

But, seriously, if you love this dog, do not keep him if you don't have the time for him. 

Edit: Also, look up resource guarding. You should NEVER leave a child unattended with a dog, especially not around food or toys. Even the most passive dogs will let you know when they're not going to put up with little hands in their bowl anymore.

A regular dog mix will require certain things and have certain traits. For example, a husky mix will require a TON of exercise and is known to escape from yards, but a hybrid needs a SHIT TON of exercise and is a roamer. They will escape and they will roam and not come back. That's just how it is.

If your dog is 25% wolf, then one of the parents would have to be 50%, which is why I asked to see a picture of the wolfdog parent. Personally, *I* don't see much more than a malamute mix, but I'm not an expert. I can see the traits, but I've also seen purebred malamutes that made you do a double take because they looked SO MUCH like wolves. If you have it, a picture of the wolf grandparent would be perfect. But you're right, you don't have to prove anything to us.

But your training method absolutely does matter. The training book you chose, while definitely not the worst thing you could pick up, still isn't very good. While, yes, the monks focus a lot on positive experiences and positive reinforcement, they also use aversive techniques and focus on being the alpha of your pack. You can find more information in the wiki, but there is absolutely no need to be the alpha. And with a dog who already is going to be one of the most independent pets you'll ever own, using these techniques will not make him inclined to listen to you. Do things incorrectly, and you can end up with an aggressive dog.

The way he sees it, if he pees, he gets in trouble. He doesn't understand that it's because he's peeing inside that he's getting in trouble, because he doesn't understand that peeing INSIDE is wrong. 

So why would he pee outside, in front of you, when it would get him in trouble?

You need to be actively rewarding him and engaging in play every single time he goes outside, and ignoring and just quietly cleaning up the mess inside. Once he's done it, there's no point in punishing it. Dogs live in the moment, so you have to catch them the INSTANT it happens, or you've lost your opportunity to do anything about it. But, again, punishing him will make him sneak off to do it where you can't see him.

2932,"Stop comparing your dog to other dogs. You started off by saying your dog is great, but then move on to say that your brother's dog is great because he punishes the dog.

Every dog is different, and not every dog will be a robot. If I remember correctly, you didn't mention breeds, so I'll use an example.

Say your brother has a German Shepard from working lines. His dog is already programmed to be the dog equivalent of a robot, and GSDs can take a beating once in a while (not that you should do it!)

Let's say you have a husky. Huskies were bred for a completely different set of skills! They were bred to be independent, pull like freaking crazy, and are very hard to train, and nearly impossible to turn into that robot-dog your husky has.

It also has to do with training. Training takes time. Positive reinforcement takes time. Even punishment takes time, but you're damaging your dog's trust in you. Why would he want to listen to you, and why would you want that sort of relationship with your dog? Hitting your dog conveys very, very little information to your dog. Dogs learn best when they're told what to do, not hit for something they've already forgotten about (you have a matter of a couple of seconds for them to actually know why you're mad, and even that's a gamble).

Find a positive reinforcement class (clickertraining.com or APDT.com) since it sounds like you're new to training (and that's not a bad thing).

As far as eating poop, that's a management issues. You can work on leave it and recall, but you need to pick up your dog's poop, and you need to ask your neighbor to do the same. If it's an apartment complex or something, speak to your landlord. You can also bring your dog out on a leash and bring him to areas where there isn't poop.

Even if your dog knows the basics, you're entering into brand new territory where your dog is learning that he's allowed to make choices now. Training with positive punishment (shock collars) pretty much teaches a dog that he's not allowed to make decisions on his own, so he'll struggle at times.

APDT.com and clickertraining.com have really great search tools to use

Edit: Plus, training classes are essentially for you, not the dog. Take a clicker training class, and you'll have a whole ton of doors opening to you that you would never be able to accomplish with a shock collar.

Edit 2: I'd also like to point out that you don't actually have as big of a problem as you think. It's part of the training process to need to fade the lure. And it's an issue much, much more favorable than having a dog afraid of you because of the shock collar.

I'm actually testing a mini-version of this. I bought a regular canvas training dummy and put some pheasant scent on it. I bring it out, get excited, the whole nine yards to see if he showed more interest in it the next time I brought it out. I'm doing it with a boring-ish toy so I can teach him drop it and such with a middle-of-the-road value item. But I'll graduate up to the pelt or something if it goes well!

We'd actually have to take a class below his level whenever we take a new class. Most of the trainers I'm interested in require you to take at least one of their basic obedience classes if you've never taken a class with them before, some require all of their basic classes before you take any advanced classes. So you make a good point. It might be much easier for the both of them to work together. I'll look into finding a good trainer!

Retaking a foundations class might work well if I can't get him to retake an obedience course. I'll have to keep that in mind. He definitely does better when I've sort of ""primed"" the dog first, so this might work well.

3025,"Separation anxiety was definitely an issue. I don't know how much different it is when dealing with a puppy since he was an adult when we adopted him, but I imagine what I did will still work. We were also in a small apartment, so you may have to add a few more steps to what I did.

The in-a-nutshell version is you have to give him something so high value that he WANTS you to leave. And this has to be something he ONLY gets when you're leaving so it's that much more special. 

What I did was make a Kong with his favorite thing (tuna). I'd give it to him in his crate (he was perfectly fine being closed in there, as long as we were still home), close the crate, and then I'd just sort of just do chores and wander around the apartment, gradually spending more and more time out of eyesight. 

Then, we put him in there and sort of just spent some time hanging around the front door. Just kind of sitting there, looking out the window. 

Then we graduated to stepping out. We made sure to come back in *before* he started getting worked up. 

We added more and more steps, slowly. Things like stepping out to get the mail or bring groceries up from the car. Eventually, we were able to go to class and be away for 1-2 hours. Now, he's fine being alone for about 6 hours before he starts losing his mind and needs to stretch his legs.

It's a process, and needs to be done at *his* pace, not yours. If you can, get him into doggy daycare a couple times a week, at least, once he has all of his shots.

And you'll also want to eventually vary the treat he's getting. If we know we'll be gone for a few hours, we'll give him something like [one of these disgusting things](http://www.petco.com/product/113175/Merrick-Naturally-Stuffed-Twin-Hoofers-Dog-Chew.aspx?CoreCat=OnSiteSearch). Be creative.

&gt;Any chance he'd be interested in some sort of ""fun"" training

If things went well, yeah, I think he would have fun with it. But he's reluctant to take any other classes because when we did basic obedience with our dog (granted, it was Petsmart because we didn't have any R+ classes in our area), the dog was completely checked out. He'd do okay for a few minutes, but for some reason, learning anything new caused him to just shut down. He just doesn't seem to *like* to learn, or gets way too overwhelmed way too easily, and just shuts down, which is what gets my boyfriend so frustrated. BUT, I'll see if there are any simple, fun classes both of them might excel at!

I'd love to do agility with him, but I just don't know that it will work out. If anything, I think we'd have more success with something like nosework or barn hunt. 

I'm bookmarking those links, but he doesn't take rewards or praise anywhere outside of the house. He never has, and we haven't really figured out why. Somewhere, there's a major disconnect between us and the dog the second we step outside of our house. Outside, in the yard, on walks, in other people's houses... doesn't matter. He doesn't even glance at us 99% of the time. He does *okay* in pet stores.

And he's been like that since the day we adopted him. When we first met him, he didn't engage with us at all. He just sort of watched what was happening beyond the fence, running back and forth along it. When we approached him, he just trotted over to the other side of the little yard we were in. We just assumed he was an understimulated, nervous shelter dog, but that never changed.

3029,"I have a 5 year old GSP. Adopted him when he was 2 years old after he washed out of gun dog training.

GSPs are great dogs, but absolutely demand routine and consistency. My dog lets me know when I'm 5 minutes late in feeding him, when it's time for my SO to wake up and take him out, and when it's time for everyone to go to bed.

I'll give you a few options for leash training in a second, but absolutely start leash training now and be consistent. We've been working on leash training my GSP for 3 years now and it's a freaking headache. Mine only cares about getting what he wants, so build a crazy strong bond.

GSPs also don't handle aversive treatment well. If you plan on training him for hunting, get the book [Positive Gun Dogs](http://www.amazon.com/Positive-Gun-Dogs-Training-Sporting/dp/1890948330/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1447370558&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=positive+gun+dogs). I also highly recommend [When Pigs Fly!](http://www.amazon.com/When-Pigs-Fly-Training-Impossible/dp/1929242441/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1447370588&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=when+pigs+fly).

As far as leash training goes, the most success I've ever had was with [Zak George's Method](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMssKIjsDxXkZk77nE0r0sdPoTuuDo-Oh). You'll find one of your dog's absolute FAVORITE activities is running, so a method where you're constantly moving keeps them engaged.

The ""stand like a tree"" method did nothing for my dog. He's a pointer, and is perfectly happy standing at the end of the leash, staring at birds! So keep him moving :)

&gt;Could it be too cold for him?

My GSP gets cold VERY easily. If it's less than 70F, it's not uncommon for him to start shivering. We bought him [this](https://www.etsy.com/listing/64734787/german-shorthaired-pointer-tummy-warmer?ref=shop_home_active_6) for Fall/Spring, and [this](http://www.amazon.com/Hurtta-Collection-14-Inch-Winter-Jacket/dp/B003TWKXHG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1447371225&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=hurtta+dog+coat) for those Chicago winters. You'll also want to invest in some booties because...

Exercise needs to happen DAILY. Whether it's raining, snowing, 100F, or -10F. You will have a monster on your hands if you don't. Even a well trained GSP cannot show his best behavior if he's under exercised. 

The face nipping is normal puppy stuff. There's stuff in the wiki and in past posts to help you out with that. Essentially, teach him that being calm gets him what he wants, whereas nipping and jumping doesn't get him anything. This will take a ton of consistency.

And start clicker training! They're a super smart breed, and you'll be able to teach your dog a ton of stuff. Find a great positive reinforcement class (clickertraining.com and APDT.com are good places to look), get through basic obedience, and then pick up a dog sport or two! 

But remember, exercise, exercise, exercise! Check with your vet to find out when he's ready for exercise like running or biking.

Edit: Also, find a good harness. [Collars can be dangerous](http://clicktreat.blogspot.com/2012/06/is-it-harmful-to-attach-aleash-to-your.html) for a lunging, jumping GSP (just wait until that bird brain kicks in!). Also, another user recommended a Gentle Leader. I highly recommend you do NOT get a Gentle Leader. A dog can still injure himself if he lunges or pulls against the head halter. My dog injured his neck in this way. As your puppy is growing and learning, he'll want to chase after birds, and that can be dangerous if he tries to do so while attached to a Gentle Leader.

3041,"I should have been more clear. It's not that he's refusing to read the books, it's that I never asked him to. He's not a big reader, so I kind of see it as I have one chance to get him to read a book, so I was looking for the one with the best information. If ""When Pigs Fly!"" happens to be the best option, I'll ask him to read it.

But YouTube, yeah. Again, he doesn't refuse to watch them, but he kind of zones out and loses interest, so it's kind of a waste of time. But I'm looking around to see if there are any that he could sit through and/or spit out quality information in an interesting way. Like, he likes TED Talks and ExtraCredits (I think that's what the channel is called?), so I'm kind of looking around for something like that.

As I said in another comment, what he's lacking is the understanding of WHY we do certain things in dog training. I used the example of a math equation. He knows he needs to use a certain equation to solve the problem, but I'm trying to show him WHY he needs to use that equation versus other equations.

I'm definitely going to start contacting some trainers I've been interested in to see if they can help (both with a difficult SO and a difficult dog haha)

I suppose it's most frustrating because, unlike your SO, mine is not a dog hater. He wanted this dog just as much as I did, but got frustrated and shut down once he realized we didn't adopt a dog as biddable as the Golden he had growing up. He's sort of just reaping the benefits of dog ownership when it's convienient for him, but I'm on my own when it comes to sculpting a dog that behaves in the way he expects. But that might be an /r/relationships issue haha

I mean, you've seen my posts about my dog's refusal to walk on a loose leash. A big issue there is my SO gets frustrated after a couple of minutes, says, ""Screw it, it's not working,"" and then just allows the dog to pull or starts yanking on the leash (dog is in a heavily padded harness, and it's more like two-finger tugs than rough jerking). So I'm stuck in a world of ""I expect dog to behave like this, but I'm mad because the results aren't instantaneous.""

3042,"He DEFINITELY views it as a chore. And I get it. Dog training is frustrating and oftentimes much less rewarding that you want it to be. He does seem to have fun if I sort of ""pre-install"" knowledge of a trick into my dog. For example, I taught the dog how to heel in the house, and now my SO has fun rewarding the dog for it now that he doesn't have to do the initial training. 

He has fun with training, but not if he has to experience any setbacks or roadblocks.

&gt;you start out by saying he understands, and then ask for resources

Yeah, I wasn't totally clear. I had deleted a few paragraphs originally, and never put back vital information.

He understands the basics, but has a hard time understanding that dogs are CONSTANTLY learning, and that even if a behavior is ingrained, it can still change. 

An example being recall. Our GSP's recall is reliable 50% of the time. My SO has a hard time understanding/remembering that we still need to heavily reinforce the recall, and that for every ""come"" that goes ignored, the dog learns he doesn't NEED to come every single time. He thinks that, with the amount of time and energy we've put into training recall (almost 3 years now!) that the dog understands what we want, and is just being a dick.

So I guess a big part of what I'm looking for is how to address his emotional response to the situation, but also start addressing those more advanced aspects of training. Sort of the how's and whys of dog psychology, beyond just ""you click the instant X happens.""

Sort of the difference between remembering a math formula. He could spit out the same mathematical formula over and over again and produce the correct answer each time, but I'm looking to help him understand why we use that formula and why that formula works better than a different formula for the problem we're trying to solve. 

But kudos to you for trying to figure out what aspects of dog training you enjoy. Agility has always seemed like a ton of fun (my dog is too bird brained to ever be able to do it, so I have yet to try it), so I hope you continue to enjoy it!

Set yourself up for success. Don't decide that starting tomorrow, you're not going to eat more than 700 calories (I'm just throwing numbers out there) and you'll avoid every piece of junk food you come across. You won't make it through that kind of sacrifice. Instead, tell yourself that for dinner you'll make a low calorie meal and just try to be smarter about what you eat throughout the day. Track everything you eat (seeing the data does a lot to keep you motivated), but don't worry about immediately staying under your daily caloric goals.

If you find yourself thinking, ""I can't do this, it's too hard"" and reaching for a Pop Tart, take a step back and think about where you set yourself up for failure. If you tried to go all day without touching sugar, that would be where you progressed too quickly. 

You can do things like completely cutting out pop from your diet and instead go for tea and water. Then gradually cut back on other things and add really good fruits and vegetables into your diet. Plan your meals, and try to stick to those plans.

Dogs have teeth and they WILL bite you if you don't respect their warning. You did not respect her warning. She set a very clear boundary for you, and you essentially said, ""Fuck you.

So just stay out of her face! It's not difficult! Don't allow kids to hug her or get in her face. Don't allow strangers to hug her or get in her face. Learn to read her body language so you can remove her from a bad situation before she bites.

3210,"&gt;Abbie wakes up early barking 5AM, 6AM. I jump out of bed and I let her out of the crate.

This is exactly the information I was looking for.

I can't comment on the peeing, but the barking is happening because she knows that if she barks, you'll come running. Whether that takes 2 hours or 2 minutes, if she barks, you come back.

Instead, she needs to learn that barking will *never* bring you through the door. Even if that means standing outside your door for an hour, barking NEVER brings you inside the front door or gets you out of bed. As soon as she stops barking, you can reward her and let her out or enter the condo.

I had to do something similar with a senior dog we had. He had trouble holding his bladder (he lived to be 15 or 16 years old, so it's not surprising!), so we immediately took him outside whenever we heard him making noise, assuming he needed to go out. That turned into shrill, ear piercing barking at all hours of the day, just because he wanted to go outside. So, when I first heard indications that he may need to go out, I would wait until he was quiet, walk over towards the back door, and keep moving as long as he was quiet (no eye contact, no words from me). If he barked or started getting worked up, I would freeze in my tracks. If he didn't stop barking, I started taking steps backwards. When he was quiet again, I would move towards the door again. It took a few weeks (the rest of my family didn't do this AT ALL, so it took WAY longer than it should have) but he got it.

Just be consistent and do not ""reward"" the barking with attention. Even screaming at her is attention and rewards the behavior.",2015-10-24 01:54:31+00:00,cwar4td,1.0,t3_3pzdci,649.0,Dogtraining

3281,"I have a high energy pointer, so I know how it feels to have a dog that's more than you bargained for.

The best advice I can give you is to figure out a way to get him the exercise he needs. Whether that's doggy daycare, biking, hiking, dog sports, whatever, you need to figure it out before you have any hope of having a well behaved dog. You cannot have a well behaved, under exercised dog.

Those board and train places are most often a waste of money. You could have someone else train the absolute hell out of your dog, but if you don't have a hand in that training, the dog will not listen to you. It's also incredibly hard to make sure your dog is being treated well, taken care of, and is happy.

Find yourself a good positive reinforcement trainer. There are links in the sidebar to help you choose one, and APDT.com is a good place to start. Your dog would absolutely thrive in some sort of dog sport like agility or flyball, and they have the added bonus of building a better bond between you and the dog.

It's also important to increase his mental stimulation. There are a ton of ways to do this. One of the easiest is to stop feeding out of a bowl and start feeding out of Kongs and puzzle toys.

In the end, if you can't keep this dog, find a rescue (not a shelter) to take him.",2015-10-15 02:29:27+00:00,cw07qd7,1.0,t3_3oszb7,1186.0,Dogtraining

And then when Mulder gave her the sunflower seeds as a little way to remember him/reminder that things will be okay...be still my heart.

Anyway. I think it definitely took a while. She cared about him deeply from probably around her abduction, but it slowly grew into something so much greater than that.

David's Tea is okay, IMO. I prefer their accessories more than their tea (go on their website and check out their adorable infuser mugs!). They have some cool flavors, but I can't seem to brew a good cup of tea from them. It always comes out so weak and begging to have stuff added to them, which I hate doing.

So my vote is Adagio, at least as you're figuring out what you like. And if you have a store nearby, check it out. Mine will brew almost any tea for me to try, but I'm not sure if that's a standard practice because one of the employees wouldn't do it for a friend of mine (I wasn't there, so I don't know).",2015-10-07 04:31:42+00:00,cvqynux,1.0,t3_3nre9c,24752.0,tea

My mom's do this all the time. They can exist absolutely perfectly when the cats are hanging around, but all it takes is for one of the cats to just walk a little quicker (like in the case of calling one of our cats, or getting their dinner ready), and BOOM! they're chasing the cats.

Every time she finds something more interesting than you, you're gambling with the likelihood she'll listen to your command. Hounds were bred to work on their own, unlike a border collie which was bred to follow your every command. 

If she gets out the door, you use your recall command, and she comes back. There's not much room to practice her ignoring you because the only context you've used the command is one in which she's heavily rewarded (if you're doing it correctly). 

Does that make sense? Not really sure how to best articulate what I'm trying to say.

3453,"&gt;Is my wife overacting on this or am I being naive?

A little bit of both. 

Often, even if a dog shows the fiercest dog aggression you can think of, it doesn't necessarily mean that the dog will also exhibit aggression towards humans. This is how you can have pit bulls and similar dogs bred and trained to fight, but they rarely ever harm a human. 

But, if the dog shows resource guarding towards dogs, you shouldn't be allowing children to stick their hands in his bowl because a dog will only tolerate so much before he does snap. He may even be throwing out silent warning signs and nobody is picking up on them.

Do you have to rehome him? Absolutely not, if you are able to manage your environment. Keep his food, toys, and treats in a safe area away from other dogs, and don't let any children tease him with food or approach him while he's eating. 

Resource guarding is so, so common and so misunderstood. The dog believes he needs to protect the item, so he growls, and the human instinct we have is to immediately scold or punish them for growling and/or take the item away, but this actually makes it worse. 

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/guarding) is a great starting point for resource guarding. Do things correctly, learn about warning signs and your dog's triggers, and manage the environment well and you don't have much to worry about.",2015-10-04 03:21:22+00:00,cvnfl7q,1.0,t3_3netqw,3214.0,Dogtraining

It's not about entertaining her every minute of the day. It's about spending enough time exercising her so she can relax instead of being on high alert every time she's outside.

3500,"I don't want you to give up hope because for some dogs it definitely can take longer than four months, but I've been working with my dog for two years. HOWEVER, my dog is pretty unique. He isn't really the type of dog you'd expect out of a pet. Some combination of his personality and past history just makes him severely independent, so right now I'm focusing on breaking that independence and leash walking has been on the back burner for a little while.

Gentle Leader didn't work for us, and he actually ended up injuring his neck because he just pulled against the thing. It didn't phase him in the slightest. A front clipping harness (of multiple brands and varieties) did not work because he figured out how to pull against it anyway and sort of walked sideways.

What DID work was buying a heavily padded harness built for sled dogs and a 6 foot leash (I had previously been using a 4 foot leash with everything else). It gave him more room to be a jerk, but he stops so often now (newer development) that my arm is rarely extended for long.

So, whenever I see one of these posts about a chronic puller, I like to tell people to be creative. It's easy to go out and buy a no pull harness, hoping that it will give you even a tiny bit of control, but that may not even be the issue. It sounds like in your case, much like mine, you have a very independent dog (at least when it comes to being outside). So, find a way to break that independence. Google ""Look at that!"" training, which might help you if your dog is hyperfocused on specific things. Make sure to exercise your dog before attempting to do any training. Buy equipment that is comfortable for both of you. There's no sense in using a Gentle Leader if your dog absolutely hates it, and you hate it because he hates it. If a front clipping harness works for you, great! If you prefer a back clipping harness, fine! You can train a dog to walk in whatever you want to use, but you have to first find the main issue.

Good luck! Remember to keep training sessions positive and short. If you get frustrated the minute you walk out the door, training is over and the walk is just about what he wants to do.

If you've never owned a dog before, a husky, malamute border collie, pit bull, shar pei, airedale, and akita are probably not for you. 

Also, be realistic about your lifestyle and needs. It's great to want a running buddy, but if you're the type of person who only runs on weekends, your dog is going to be hyperactive during the week. Just like they say don't buy a ""10% car"" (like a massive SUV when you'd only need that extra space occasionally), don't get a 10% dog.",2015-09-30 19:33:03+00:00,cvjnamj,1.0,t3_3mzzzi,3312.0,Dogtraining

**Loose leash walking:** There are a bunch of different methods for teaching this, but for a high energy dog, I recommend [Zak George](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMssKIjsDxXkZk77nE0r0sdPoTuuDo-Oh). His videos are often geared to high energy breeds (and he's a border collie guy, himself) so watch a bunch of his videos.

It's important to exercise your dog well before you attempt *any* training. This includes loose leash walking.

**Recall:** If you've never taught recall (which, I'm just assuming you didn't formally teach it), he doesn't know to come to you when you call. More Zak George [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl3IP6YUTfo) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwldfBjFsdE).

**Leash Reactivity:** [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/reactivity)

**Calm greeting:** [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/jumping).

There's also nothing wrong with wrestling with your dog. Many dogs love rough housing, but you just need to teach him when play is over, which you mostly have.

For those times when he's misbehaving around guests, it helps to teach him how to be [calm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wesm2OpE_2c) and [go to his bed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2c5EkytNU0).

However, you could train the absolute hell out of this dog, but he will still misbehave if you aren't properly exercise him. You chose a high energy breed. You waived the privilege of having lazy days as soon as you brought a high energy breed home.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1lv1ug/what_are_some_good_options_for_mental_exercise/cc3127a) is just one of many options for mental stimulation for your dog (which is just as important as physical exercise). If you search this sub, you'll find a TON of good options for exercise.

But, in the end, I highly recommend you find a positive reinforcement trainer. You can take classes in all kinds of things: basic obedience, dog sports, trick classes, and specialty classes (including reactivity).

3609,"Honestly, I get the feeling your views on training might be a little backwards.

Just because you use treats for training, does NOT mean you're stuck carrying treats around with you for the rest of the dog's life. The posts on here about people with dogs who only respond to treats are, more often than not, people brand new to dog training or this style of training. 

And, I promise you, if you ever get to the point where you're trying to teach recall to your dog, a pat on the head and praise will fall short. You need to give your dog a reason to leave every bird, tree, and squirrel alone and come to you instead. All three of those are more exciting than a ""Good girl.""

If you don't want to use treats, you can use play, but that still means you need to do more than just pat her on the head. Dog training isn't about what the trainer wants, it's about what the dog will respond to. Some dogs don't respond to treats, and will only respond to tug of war. Other dogs would laugh in your face (if they were capable) at the thought of doing anything for you without treats. But that still doesn't mean you have to use treats for basic sits and downs forever. You need to [fade the lure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tQ7crqrlU).

The clicker is also a wonderful tool. It's used to mark the exact moment a behavior happens. Sure, you can use other markers (such as a ""YES!""), but using your voice can convey different meanings. If you're getting frustrated, a vocal ""YES"" will reflect that, and your dog won't be having fun anymore. You could be so mad you're about to hit the wall (stop training before it ever gets to that point), but a click will always be a click.

Also, it's not a good idea for only one person to be in charge of training. Your boyfriend needs to be involved, too. Just because your dog does a perfect sit, stay, down, and come for you, does NOT mean she'll do it for your boyfriend if he's never taught it to her.

Also, she's only 4 months old. As she gets older, she's going to start pushing her boundaries and she won't be as interested in you. The world will become insanely more enticing for her, and your current reward system will fail you.

I think it's awesome that you're being proactive in your dog's training, but you're not choosing the most effective route in doing so.",2015-09-21 16:47:53+00:00,cv95w10,1.0,t3_3lti06,2633.0,Dogtraining

First, exercise (check with the vet to make sure he's healthy enough for exercise). A tired dog is a good dog. If you/your mom can get him tired before she leaves for work, he'll be easier to manage by the time she gets home. Mental stimulation is also important.

Second is management. Put garbage cans behind closed doors, put food away in cabinets, put litter boxes in other rooms, and block his access to anything you don't want him to get.

And then third is training. This will be tougher if your mom can't be consistent with it. And it will be especially tough if he's not being exercised. But a dog of any age can learn, it's just harder to break bad habits.",2015-09-15 04:32:04+00:00,cv20t3f,1.0,t3_3kzmx2,9222.0,Dogtraining

Personal example being my mom bringing home a 6 week old chihuahua puppy. The vets she works with (she's a non-medical hospital manager) all told her 6 weeks is fine, however, SHE is not in the position to properly raise a 6 week old puppy (and that responsibility then fell upon me).

While I won't say your trainer is full of BS, I will say that I think they aren't really thinking about the problem in the correct way.

Yes, with a harness, it *can* make their pulling stronger, but do you want the potential vet bills associated with a pulling dog? (Please take your dog to the vet, and get a video of the dog's behavior if possible).

I personally don't like head halters. Any tool you use will not teach your dog to stop pulling, that's your job. My dog injured his neck because the gentle leader didn't stop his pulling.

So you can use a harness, as long as you teach your what is expected of them.

Story time: I have a heavy, stubborn puller. He has been walking/training in a harness 95% of the time we work with him (we tried ""silky leash"" for a while, which is done best with a collar). While he still pulls in a harness (he's a work in progress), it's WAY better than he was when we adopted him. Yesterday, I had made the decision to just attach the leash to his collar because I originally was just going for a car ride. Then I realized I needed to stop at the pet store and figured it would be find because he does so well in pet stores. He pulled like he's never been on a walk in his life. He was terrible. Had I used his harness, he would have been fine, but because he's never been trained with just the collar, he didn't know the ""no pulling"" rules still applied.

Point is, you can absolutely use a harness. You can use whatever you want, but you need to actually teach her what you want.

3755,"This is why I don't advocate for shock collars.

I'm going to throw in a personal story here. When I was a kid, one of my friends had this little Boston terrier and decided to use an electric fence.

Once, just once, they forgot to take the collar off the dog when they took her in the car. As they backed out of the driveway, as one would expect, the dog was shocked. After that one incident and that quick shock, the dog was absolutely traumatized. She absolutely refused to even go in the front yard (where the driveway way), panicked if they tried to put her in the car, and absolutely lost it when she heard beeping noises (the warning tone from the collar) of any kind.

Is that the kindest, most effective way to keep a dog in the yard? Absolutely not. I would much rather see a dog exercised on leash than with an e collar on. It's so much more ethical to find other means of letting your dog be a dog than to use fear and pain to keep them on your property.

Not to mention, your dog absolutely can still get out of your yard, and then has no way to come back in. Or an unfriendly dog or wild animal can wander onto your property, leaving your dog trapped or with no choice but to run off.

I know I didn't answer your question, but honestly, you are witnessing the bad effects of that system. Do what's best for your dog and look into safer alternatives.

I think [The Promise of Sleep by William C. Dement](http://www.amazon.com/Promise-Sleep-Medicine-Connection-Happiness/dp/0440509017/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1441851245&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=promise+of+sleep).

It was an online class, and I usually just half ass my way through online classes, especially when I have 5 other classes to deal with (it was a messy semester!). BUT, I decided that it was one of those classes that could prove to be useful and interesting, so I read the book.

Holy cow, I'm so glad I did. It's so well written and doesn't put you to sleep (see what I did there?), and has some extremely useful information. Definitely among my favorite books, and definitely my favorite nonfiction book.

My family is very Polish (I'm a second generation American), and a weird thing we do is obsess over rye bread. That rye bread you can buy at Walmart or another major grocery store, found next to the Wonder bread? That's not real rye bread. You have to go to a real deli, preferably a Jewish or Eastern European one.

Well, being right in the middle of Missouri, there were no Jewish delis in my area. I was rye bread-deprived and sad.

So, when my birthday rolled around, I arrived home from class one day and saw a giant box sitting right outside my apartment door.

I FINALLY got him walking in the house 75% of the time. FINALLY! It's almost three years of work (we adopted him November 2012).

In a nutshell, the way I did it was require him to walk to the backdoor to go outside in a loose heel. If he ran ahead, he had to come back and get back into position. The same rules applied when we were going back inside (he's a door bolter, so he's behind a couple of gates preventing him access to the main hallway, so he doesn't get to practice running in that area).

I won't lie; sometimes positive reinforcement seems to take FOREVER and you'll think, ""Can't I accomplish this so much more quickly if I used X form of punishment?"" But 99% of the time, training shouldn't be about using the quickest method, but the safest/most ethical/most effective methods. 

Good news is, you have a GSD, which is a very loyal, pretty ""tough"" breed.

&gt;How do I go about regaining her trust in me, if even possible?

It's entirely possible, but you first need to do a lot of research on positive reinforcement. There's a ton to learn, but to just get the ball rolling, check out Zak George on YouTube. He does a good job of getting the point across to people new to positive reinforcement.

As far as regaining trust, head over to Petco/smart and buy a [clicker](http://www.petsmart.com/search;pgid=Zex0S38eLflSRpeNwcUIyGkQ0000DfzZNsUs;sid=mZVZfA3DNuRafFgsg38YeD_J8DzABMIdC1nNl464?SearchTerm=clicker) and a bunch of really good training treats (Zukes, freeze-dried organs, cheese, low-sodium hot dogs).

Then, pick a trick and start clicker training! Clicker training helps a dog build confidence, and since there's no punishment required, you'll be reforming that bond with little extra effort.

&gt;And if I don't catch her in the act of doing something wrong, do I even attempt to punish her?

Nope. Punishment honestly is pretty ineffective for dog training. You have a matter of *seconds* for your dog to make the connection, and even then, there's no guarantee that your dog will understand why you're mad. 

&gt;And how do you punish a dog?

Short answer, you don't. Dogs learn best when they're told what to do, not what to do.

The only real ""punishment"" we advocate here is negative punishment, which means you're taking something the dog desires away. So, say your dog is pulling on the leash and is determined to move towards that dog way up ahead. You stop and don't let her move forward. The forward progress is the reward she wants, so you stop moving completely to take that reward away until she calms down enough to stop pulling.

There are a TON of great resources in this sub's wiki. Remember, training should be FUN for both you and your dog. If one of you isn't having fun, you're doing it wrong.",2015-09-08 17:34:17+00:00,cuumbec,1.0,t3_3k3zh0,4189.0,Dogtraining

We decided it would be fun to give him something ironic. My SO and I are both vegetarians, so obviously we wouldn't be hunting, and we were adopting a hunting dog, so we went with Hunter. 

In the two years since adopting him, we've learned just how ironic his name is. He doesn't know how to swim (GSPs are supposed to be versatile dogs, able to act as a retriever (swimming), pointer (pointing), and spaniel (flushing)), he has insane noise anxiety (gun dogs need to be reliable around gun shots), and he is the least biddable dog I have ever met (hunting dogs need to be biddable, as they're supposed to work WITH you).

My cat's name is Bug. We actually named him Bug because I wanted to call him my little Lady Bug. We actually thought it was female at first, so it was an adorable name for him.

&gt;She knows that it's wrong

Nope. Not at all. Dogs aren't capable of that sort of logic. Her displays are merely her attempts at appeasement. She's essentially saying, ""Don't yell at me, because that's what I expect you to do now when you come home.""

&gt;I point at it, say ""bad dog,""

This does nothing but confirm her suspicions that she should be afraid of your return. She literally cannot make the connection that she's in trouble for something she did even one minute ago.

[You also shouldn't use a collar with a heavy puller](http://clicktreat.blogspot.com/2012/06/is-it-harmful-to-attach-aleash-to-your.html).

As far as regular collars go, look into martingale collars. They're designed for dogs with necks thicker than the head. I recommend [this one](https://www.etsy.com/listing/120236853/buckle-martingale-dog-collar?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=martingale%20collar&amp;ref=sc_gallery_4&amp;plkey=7a4b7aa1a2981ceb9f5fc3191a5431357aadf15d:120236853) which I have had on my dog for over a year without any issues with quality.

There is also a ton of excellent information [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/prongandecollars) about prong collars.

Now, not a single piece of equipment out there, even the most well designed, will teach your dog not to pull. That's your job. Tools only help you to manage the symptoms, it's your job to treat the problem. 

In your case, it sounds like your dog gets too excited when she sees another dog. That's a very common problem and you can find similar information about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/reactivity).

It's simple. It's something he wants, and he's telling you not to take it from him. By forcibly taking it, you're teaching him that he DOES have a reason to guard those high value items, which will make things worse.

Instead, you need to teach a solid drop it and ""trade up"" when he has something you want. If he has a glove, offer him something higher value (like cheese) in exchange for the glove.

As a GSP owner, I can *promise* you that if you use any forceful methods on your dog, you'll wind up with problems. GSPs are very sensitive dogs, and do not handle positive punishment well. Read up on clicker training and positive reinforcement.

I would instead see what kinds of other daycares are in your area. A good one will have a good way of dividing dogs up based on play style, energy level, size, and even age. An even better one doesn't use things like alpha rolling or squirt bottles when dogs get out of hand.

And even if you're not finding any good daycares, see if there is someone in your area that has a large yard with a few dogs of their own that you can leave your dog with for a few hours.

3884,"Okay, I'm going to try to be delicate here.

Are you doing it right? Yes and no. There's no denying prong collars and other positive punishment tools are effective. They get the job done. So if all you care about is getting your dog to stop pulling, then, yes, technically you're doing it right.

But, *should* you be doing it that way? Is your way the most effective? No. And you'll find that using a correction collar and yelling at him won't work when you get to higher level obedience, and *definitely* will not help you if/when you try to create a bombproof recall. 

The sidebar and wiki have *tons* of information that I *strongly* recommend you read, so I'm just going to give you the abridged version of it all. The basic, TL;DR version of it is, look into positive reinforcement and clicker training instead.

First, the best training happens when the dog *wants* to work *with* you. There is absolutely no need to use positive punishment (adding an unpleasant stimulus) in animal training. Even the most stubborn of animals will thrive with positive reinforcement (adding a desired stimulus). Have you ever seen someone try to train a tiger with a prong collar? You'd lose an arm!

A dog who is having fun during training will be so much more eager to work with you, and you can accomplish so much more than resorting to yelling and leash corrections. Say you had a job that you were only doing for the money. Maybe it was something you wanted to do at first, but your boss is always yelling at you. Are you going to put in 110% at work? Probably not. You'll probably come in late, leave early, do the bare minimum, and think about quitting every day. Do you want your dog to give you 110%?

Second, prong collars can be dangerous on multiple levels. [They can be physically dangerous](http://clicktreat.blogspot.com/2012/06/is-it-harmful-to-attach-aleash-to-your.html), and *some* dogs can eventually develop reactivity and leash aggression from the use of corrective collars. Say every time the dog sees another dog, he pulls on the leash. You give a pop on the collar, but the dog doesn't understand he's experiencing the pain because he's pulling. All he knows is that he sees that dog, and suddenly he's experiencing pain. If this happened every time your dog saw another dog, eventually he'd become aggressive in anticipation of experiencing that pain (and anyone who says prong collars don't cause the dog pain is misinformed).

Third, you're not really teaching your dog anything. Dogs learn best when they're being told what to do, not what not to do. You tell him not to jump on you when you get home from work. Fine, but what is he supposed to do instead? He isn't capable of easily making decisions like that, and suddenly he's being yelled at again because he doesn't understand what he should be doing instead. If he's jumping, you tell him to sit.

Finally, do you want to be the source of discomfort for your dog? I can guarantee that what you're seeing isn't 100% learning. There's some repression in there. He's learning how to avoid that collar, not learning how to walk with you. Why create fear when you can create an amazing bond with your dog?

So ditch the collar, bust out those treats, and start having fun with it! Training should be fun for the both of you!

3893,"1. My favorite color is red. I don't know what it is about red, but it has always been my favorite color. For some reason, it's very hard for me to buy shoes in any color other than red! Right now I'm wearing a well-loved pair of red Converse.

2. My favorite show, hands down, is The X-Files. You can find me posting over on /r/xfiles once in a while, though I mostly lurk. I also like The Big Bang Theory, Grey's Anatomy, Falling Skies, American Horror Story, ER, Face Off, and a couple of others I can't quite remember.

3. I think JFK is my favorite movie, but I also love Jurassic Park, Terminator, X-Files: Fight the Future, Young Frankenstein, Help!, and A Hard Day's Night.

4. My bucket list isn't very complex. I think visiting the Smithsonian is the most exciting thing on my list. I haven't really traveled much in my life, and I LOVE museums, so Smithsonian seems like a good place to visit.

5. I think my greatest accomplishment would be graduating college. I faced a lot of setbacks and roadblocks, and I really started to question whether or not I would make it through, but I did it! Now I'm still in school, still chugging along. I think I can, I think I can, I think I can...

6. I always wanted to go into the medical field. I was pre-med for a little while, and was so close to being ready to take my MCATs but, ironically, some medical issues prevent me from ever becoming a doctor.

7. If I could travel absolutely anywhere, and money and food (I'm a vegetarian, and lots of places are less than veggie friendly) were not an issue, I think I'd like to visit Poland to see where my family came from. My grandparents came from Poland, but I know very little about their lives there.

8. &amp; 9. I'm new here :)

10. Pay off my student loans and credit cards. I would do that instantly, before buying *anything*. Then I would probably do the stereotypical buying a car, a house, giving some money to my family, probably donate some to charity, etc.

11. I don't really have a favorite book. I like to read, but I don't really form strong attachments to any books. I do love Harry Potter though. I guess that counts.

12. I think the last book I read cover to cover was a dog training book called ""When Pigs Fly."" I'm about to start ""Looking Backward"" for a history class.

13. Tofurky. Honestly. Tofurky is delicious. 

14. Sort of. I wouldn't really call them strange, and I can't quite classify them as true phobias, but I have a few strong fears. First is fire. This is a pretty long story, so I'll hold back on telling it unless anyone is genuinely interested (don't be shy; I don't mind). Second is water. I never learned how to swim. I took classes as a child, but the teacher (read: teenager that didn't want to be there) pretty much said, ""Okay, now go dive off the diving board into the water where it's 10 feet deep, without any floatation devices, and don't die"" when I was far from ready. I had a panic attack and never went back to lessons. I then experienced *at least* four times where I did nearly drown over the next few years. So, now, I'll drink it, I'll bathe in it, I'll deal with the rain, but I absolutely cannot justify getting into large bodies of water. And then being buried alive, but that's pretty common.

15. I have a dog and a cat. I also live with 5 other cats and 4 other dogs. It's a zoo.

16. Yes and no. I currently live in a suburb of Chicago, and it's just so boring and...not Chicago. I'd prefer to live in a quieter part of the city (I need some quiet once in a while!). I also wouldn't say no to moving to Toronto, Seattle, or Portland. Maybe Boston.

17. Oh, man. Nothing too terrible, but when you have an anxiety disorder, all those little things pile up. Off the top of my head, I recall a period of time in my life where any outsider would think I was in love with my school's safety resource officer person. This was in 6th or 7th grade, so I was about 12 or 13. I spent a lot of time in his office helping him with different things like going to get other students from their classrooms and printing stuff out. I was like a little mini secretary. But because I spent so much time around him and talking about random stuff with him, I talked about him a lot because it was the only exciting thing going on in my life (I was a boring kid with very few friends). So everyone thought I had a crush on him. Oh those awkward teenage years.

18. I met Kyle Cease once. He's a semi-famous actor and comedian. I don't remember meeting anyone else.

19. Just one: English. I did learn basic Russian in college, and I absolutely loved it, but I've forgotten most of it. If you give me simple sentences, I can probably read/hear them and understand what it says or what you were saying, but I absolutely cannot speak it. I'd love to learn Polish some day, but it's hard to find Polish classes unless you want to spend a lot of money.

20. I'm more of a mid-day person. I'm often in bed by 10 or 11 (the only reason I'm still up now is because I'm supposed to be writing an essay!), definitely asleep by midnight. And then I usually don't wake up until around 8, and don't really leave my bed until 10 or so.

I'll preface this by saying that I'm brand new to actually caring about hair, but I have some things to share that I've come across in my research that I *think* are true (hopefully someone will *gently* correct me if I'm wrong).

&gt;The last 2-3 inches of my hair is completely dead/screwed up.

When was the last time you had it trimmed? Even if you're trying to grow your hair down to your butt, you need to have it trimmed once in a while to get rid of split ends and keep everything healthy. I learned this from a stylist because my sister was in that boat. She wanted to grow it out, but didn't want to cut it because it seemed counterintuitive, but had split ends.

&gt;I've gone through 5 boxes of drug store color in the past 3 weeks. 

That's definitely not going to help any damage your hair has, and will probably make things worse. Hopefully someone else will comment on how to care for damaged hair :)

&gt;I can't justify spending 100+ on cut/color.

I can't justify that for myself either. I understand why some people do it, and good for them, do what makes you happy...but it's not *that* important to me that I'd drop $100 on my hair.

Instead, I've gotten pretty good at just dying it myself. Since I previously didn't care too much about my hair, I just got a cheap haircut (pixie cut, so pretty easy) at Great Clips ($15) and then a box of dye ($10). Boom. Hair.

Since cost is an issue, I contacted my local cosmetology school. They do haircuts for $10, and the supervisor/teacher sits down with both you and the student to decide exactly what you want done, and then the teacher makes sure the student is doing it correctly. Maybe that's an option for you.

4016,"Haha of course. I was on mobile so I was trying to keep things short. Most of this is explained in the sidebar/wiki and that book (I cannot emphasize this enough: get that book).

When you're working on recall, your reward should always be like your dog has just won the lottery, *especially* with a breed like yours. You want your dog to think that returning to you is the greatest thing they could ever do in their life. So, let's keep things simple and say your dog's highest value reward is cheese (that book will help you figure out your high value rewards). Let's say your dog is roaming around, you use your recall command, and your dog returns. Your dog just won the lottery and you're going to be like a cheese slot machine. You're not going to just give her one crappy treat. You're going to get a small handful of that cheese and throw a party. Returning to you needs to be more rewarding than sniffing that tree.

When working on recall, you need to make sure your dog is never in a position to ignore the command, and you're never found without your high value reward. Let's say you're in your backyard, you don't have your reward, but you need your dog to come back to you. You know if you don't have a treat, she's not going to come, so don't even try it. You'll weaken the command if you allow her to ignore it. Instead, go grab her (don't chase her) or do whatever else you can to calmly get her back inside. But do not use your recall word. So, always, always have treats on you, and invest in a long leash (and a harness! Dogs can seriously injure themselves with a collar and a long leash). If she's on a leash, you can use your command (ONCE!) and reel her back in gently. Reward even if she only came back because you had to pull her all the way over to you. 

Now, as far as a new recall word goes. You said you used ""come,"" which is common. But she's learned that ""come"" doesn't mean ""come every single time,"" but instead ""I may or may not have treats, and you should think about coming back to me."" It also means, ""Remember, I have a short temper, so you might see some of that, too."" You want to use a word that you can condition to mean ""Come to me because I have the world's greatest treats and we're about to have a fucking party!"" With independent breeds, the slightest frustration can make your dog less likely to come back to you because what's in it for her? Why would she come back if you're just going to leash her up/bring her inside and she gets nothing? 

Make sense? Recall is a delicate and very difficult thing to master. By all means, keep practicing using your current command, but change it (your training will take a few steps backwards, but that's okay) once you read that book. It's something that can take months or years, and some dogs will never have it down perfectly. Also, huskies are one of those breeds that can never be off leash in an unsecured area, so go ahead and don't aim for that. It *could* happen, but I've met incredibly experienced trainers with independent breeds that they could never let off leash. ",2015-08-20 01:44:30+00:00,cu908ch,3.0,t1_cu8yt98,2494.0,Dogtraining

However, you're definitely going to want to find ""When Pigs Fly"" on Amazon or half.com and read it like your dog training bible.

Otherwise, read through the sidebar and the wiki. Do not overuse the recall word because it can do a few unwanted things (like teach your dog that it's okay to ignore you the first time you give the command), and start thinking of a new recall command that you will use ONLY when you can heavily reinforce it and ONLY when your dog will not be in a position to completely ignore it. Don't even try the command until you've read through that book I mentioned and understand it completely.

4023,"So, dominance theory is actually bullshit, so you can drop that mentality right now. Dogs *do not* try to dominate humans, and being assertive and aggressive is definitely more likely to make this dog's issues worse, rather than solve them like you think you're doing.

Every time you ""assert"" yourself, and aggressively take the item away, you're telling the dog it *does* have a reason to guard that item. Also, since it's a popular practice within dominance theory, I'm assuming you or your friend are punishing the dog for growling.

Instead, focus on positive reinforcement, which will help build a very strong bond between you and the dog. And try to get the girlfriend to participate in training as much as she's able/willing to, given the circumstances.

Since you don't know this dog well enough, avoid the dog park. This dog's world just got very confusing, and dogs do act differently when they're being handled by people they don't know well.

So, when I moved away to college, and couldn't have a single pet, not even a goldfish, I was lost. I eventually got a dog.

Now, I'm living with my mom again, and we have 5 dogs in total (1 of them being mine). I can't imagine myself with just a single dog. We were looking into adding a second dog for a little while before we decided to move in with my mom.

My SO doesn't want many pets for financial reasons. But if you can handle the financial burden, you can handle the hair, and you can handle any training issues that arise, I think getting a second dog is a fine option.

In your situation, I would recommend fostering one. That way, you can see how your current dog reacts without finding yourself in a permanent situation. ",2015-07-30 19:58:19+00:00,ctlxlyy,1.0,t3_3f6kuf,9767.0,Dogtraining

Pits aren't like your average lab. They play hard, work hard, and are very powerful dogs with a ton of energy. But they're also very smart and tend to be very biddable (willing to work for you).

Start reading through the sidebar to get an idea of how to train a dog (I get the feeling you're generally new to this, which is fine! You gotta start somewhere!), pick up some awesome treats and a clicker, and start with your basic obedience. It will also help if you find a good positive reinforcement trainer in your area.

As others said, she's going to need a ton of exercise. She could definitely exist just fine on her own while you're at work, but she's going to need to be well exercised. Otherwise, you'll be facing destruction, noise, and behavior problems.

Dogs aren't just born being calm and obedient. You need to teach them what is expected of them. If you don't have the time, patience, or energy to create the kind of dog you're looking for, then this is not the dog for you. You need to be willing to cater to this dog's needs, as well. It's just like any relationship. You need to give as much as you're going to take. You don't want her tearing up your house? That's perfectly acceptable, but then you'll need to take up jogging. You don't want her biting you? Perfect. But you'll need to teach her what you do expect of her instead.

Telling her ""no"" every time she does something you don't like isn't actually telling her much. No what? No biting? No sitting? No holding this toy in my mouth? Think of all the hundreds of things she's doing at the exact moment you tell her no. What do you want her to actually stop doing? SHOW her the acceptable thing to do. If she's biting your hands, give her a toy instead. If she's grabbing things she shouldn't have, put them away and give her an acceptable toy. Dogs learn best when they're told what to do, not what not to do.",2015-07-29 16:29:02+00:00,ctkeyx0,1.0,t3_3ezm2j,44163.0,Dogtraining
4117,"I just finished my first Fenzi course not too long ago.

Honestly? Most dog training is information you can get almost anywhere. What you're actually paying for is the guidance of the trainer. I lucked out with the bronze membership because there were Gold members who had dogs similar to mine, so any questions they asked about their dogs, I was able to use on my dog.

But otherwise? I really could have gotten that information from anywhere else on the internet. Hell, I *know* people on this sub have taken that exact course and could have given me that information if I asked the right question.

I would instead save up and find a group class for your dog. Even something like Petsmart's trick training class would be good (I think it's about $125). Most classes won't cost you more than $100-something. There are links in the sidebar to help you find a good trainer.

You can also just decide what you'd like to teach your dog, and do it! The hardest part is figuring out how to break up one task into smaller steps. If you're not clicker training yet, now is a great time to start, and it will make training those tasks much easier.

Just head over to YouTube and look at Zak George, kikopup, and tab289 to start with. All three have fun trick videos to help you.

4140,"To me, it doesn't sound like you're ready for a dog.

You're 22, still in school, and you don't know where you'll be a few years from now. You might find yourself relocating to an expensive city where you can't find an apartment that allows dogs that is within your budget. Or maybe you'll be working 10 hours a day, with a commute, so you're barely home. What if your parents don't want to help pay for the dog? What if they start having financial problems? What happens when your savings run out?

You want a highly trainable dog, and that's perfectly fine, but those highly trainable dogs tend to also be high energy. A couple walks a day won't be good enough. If the dog's energy needs aren't met, you can find yourself with behavioral problems (your neighbors won't appreciate the barking), destruction (your landlord won't appreciate having his walls torn up), or both. Smart dogs find their own fun.

Can you afford a trainer, or even a behaviorist (if you should need one)? Those can get costly quickly. If this is your first dog, I *highly* recommend finding a good positive reinforcement trainer. 

Are you ready to give up your social life? With a dog, there's no more staying out all night partying. No more coming home drunk off your ass (not making any personal judgements here; just making a point) because that dog will need to be taken outside once you get home. Are you going to climb stairs or use an elevator, and then bend down to pick up poop, when you're drunk? (I promise you. It's HARD haha). Having a dog is like having a child. It isn't as simple as, ""Ok, I'm leaving. See you at some point."" If that's what you want, a cat is a better option for you.

Start working on recall like crazy. We also bring the highest value treats possible out there with us every single time we take him out. If he comes when I call, he gets treats. If he comes back to me without me calling, he gets treats. If he's just hanging around me, he gets treats. I'm making it more rewarding to stay by me than to go over the fence.

Make sure she's getting getting enough mental and physical exercise. My dog is much less likely to try to jump the fence when he's tired. When he's bored and has a lot of energy, it's almost a guarantee that I'm going to risk losing him again.

Not regularly. I've only just started going, and only went off and on in the past. I'm working on being better about it though :)

&gt;If he's always next to you and always on a leash

The heeling is a new addition to our walks (and I haven't even used it on walks yet. We're still working on it indoors). Previously, he really set the tone of the walks. Walks were always about him (he used to be a nervous wreck on walks), so he does have frequent moments where he has to pay attention to me because he'll be trying to go one direction, but I'm asking him to go in the opposite direction.

The problem with him is that he gives absolutely 0 shits about us when we're outside. He's a needy velcro dog inside, but the *instant* that door opens, we're just sacks of meat holding him back. He doesn't play outside, doesn't take treats, and doesn't even glance at us. It's all work, work, birds, work. He's a failed gun dog that was left in an outdoor kennel all day for the first two years of his life, so I don't think he ever learned how to work WITH people, if that makes sense. I could be holding a bird in my hands, but if it's not flying around, he wouldn't care at all.

&gt;Would it be possible to try the 'new' harness (with the optional biking ring) on a bike with only one gear?

I definitely agree that it's noise related *at least to an extent*, but I'm really not in a position to buy another bike.

&gt;pick up the pace

That's the majority of the reason walking him is *tolerable*. I naturally walk pretty fast, but I picked up the pace and he does do a little better. But my SO says that when he goes faster, the pulling (away from the bike) gets worse. He says its not in a ""I need to get away from this bike/noise"" kind of pulling, but a ""Hey, I want to go this way now!"" kind of pulling.

However, he did seem to do better this morning. Despite not taking treats outside, my boyfriend was able to get the dog's attention by shaking a bag of hot dogs. He still loses interest in the hot dogs almost instantly, but the pulling stops momentarily. 

He has his good days and his bad days. He LOVES to run, but wants to do it with his own agenda, which we don't have a good set up for.

Correction collars were definitely the tool of choice in Missouri. And it makes sense. Tons and tons of hunters and just very traditional people. I can't tell you how many times I had a big burly hunter-type come up to me or my SO and ~~recommend~~ be baffled by the fact that our dog wasn't using *at least* a prong collar, if not an e-collar (he's a German Shorthaired Pointer...bird dogs were insanely popular in that area).

In the Chicago-area, that presence is still there, but I think I see dogs without correction collars more often than with those tools. Dominance theory is still big, but positive reinforcement trainers are starting to advertise better. But it seems for every one positive reinforcement trainer, there are probably 3 positive punishment trainers. 

There's a local pet store that seemed to be ahead of the times. They don't carry any positive punishment tools in their stores and they were constantly advertising for local positive reinforcement trainers. But they sent out an email about a week ago advertising for a trainer that likens herself to Milan, and that was pretty disappointing. 

But there's also a lot of general misinformation and lack of education out there. Just the other day, I saw some kids (couldn't have been more than 15) walking their small (maybe 30 lbs?) terrier mix in a choke collar and a retractable leash. They kept letting it get a running start, and then locked the leash, making the dog hit the end of the leash...in a choke collar...

And my SO tried to teach his grandmother how to use a clicker. She still thinks it's either used as an interruption tool, or a dog should automatically know what it means.

With more education and better advertising (and fucking Milan being taken off the damn TV), I think things would be moving in the right direction MUCH faster. But as long as Milan is still popular, it'll be a battle.",2015-07-14 23:05:46+00:00,ct3ilum,1.0,t3_3d9viz,21497.0,Dogtraining

Haha I'm just being a jerk. The truth is, we've been working with him on his leash skills for 2.5 years, and have never tackled his pulling problem. We got him to the point where my arm isn't at risk for being ripped off my body, but he still pulls. 

&gt;regular harness

Any recommendations? He's a Pointer, so he needs a heavily padded harness, otherwise it rubs him raw. And because of his pulling, it needs to be super durable.

&gt;drop it if he pulls

Yeah...no. He'd be GONE. He once went missing for 7 hours because he jumped the fence (got startled by fireworks). When we're outside, anything I do/try/have is the very last of his priorities. 

&gt;Have you done any group obedience classes or worked with him with a trainer at all?

We had 3 trainers. All of them sort of threw their hands up and told me they didn't know what to do. One wanted me to use a choke collar on him because he's so difficult. But I have found a new trainer I hope to try sometime in the next few months. She's KPA certified and has good reviews, but only offers two classes that would benefit us.

Edit: I'm currently working on teaching him a default (but loose) heel.

We also don't like the same types of games (I game a little). He likes to mostly play campaigns and story-heavy games. I just want to get headshots on 12 year olds who think they're badasses swearing up a storm before their mommies come home from work. So while we both like Call of Duty, he wants to play the campaign or Zombies, and I just want to play multiplayer.

4352,"I have a high energy breed with separation anxiety, so I'll see if I can offer you any good information.

When we got our dog (now a 4 year old German Shorthaired Pointer) 2 years ago, his separation anxiety first manifested as pure destruction. He pulled things off of walls, shelves, and tables, pulled our laundry out of the basket, and put ALL of our shoes on our bed (THAT was something you don't hear about every day!), so we decided we needed to crate train him.

You can Google crate training, or find it in the wiki, so I won't go through all of that. But we failed to *properly* crate train the first time. We sort of half-assed it. He went in there pretty willingly, so we figured all was well...until I decided to record him with my iPad. Lo and behold, he substituted his destruction with barking, howling, whining, and spinning in circles. We lived in an apartment with VERY thin walls, and less-than-understanding neighbors. 

So, we started working on leaving him for only very small increments at a time. It helped that I wasn't working at the time, but figure out a way to do it. If you've got vacation time to burn, now is the perfect time to use it.

The key was to NEVER return unless he was quiet. I don't know *how* smart this was (it could potentially reinforce the behavior, but it did work for us) but when I was leaving, I would close the door and then silently stand right outside the closed/covered window right next to his crate (we had a walkway in front of our unit) and I'd lightly knock on the window if I heard him start to whine or make any noise. This quickly shut him up, *I'm assuming* because he thought it meant I was just on the other side of the wall, not abandoning him forever.

It's also important to mix up your ""I'm leaving now"" routine. Put your shoes on and then just plant your ass on the couch and watch TV. Wear your coat while making breakfast. Grab your keys before heading for the shower. You want to make all of those items/actions meaningless.

We also HAVE to leave him with a kong or something else to chew on. We're at the point now where I don't have to leave him with something that will last forever, but something of a high enough value so that he practically WANTS me to leave so he can get that treat. We use things like tuna, canned dog food, high-quality canned cat food (in moderation), and meaty bones (find your local butcher or natural pet food store). Sometimes we freeze the Kong, especially if we're going to be gone for more than four hours (which isn't often). 

But the absolute number one necessity? Exercise. Talk to your vet about what she can/can't handle, but you have to figure something out. I think swimming is good for HD? Find a hydrotherapist (I think that's what it's called...) or find a good dog beach and go when nobody else is around. It's important to try to do this before you go to work, but if you can tire her out in the evening, sometimes it's enough to hold her over throughout the next day. You should also look for ways to tire her out mentally. Done correctly, and you can actually tire a dog out faster with mental stimulation that with physical exercise. If you search through the subreddit, there's a post practically once a month asking how to mentally stimulate a dog, and posts about how to tire out a high energy dog (in which people discuss mental stimulation).

Also, check with your vet. She could be in pain, making her whine all day. She's already stressed because you're gone, and that can aggravate any pain she's experiencing. I don't know much about HD, but look into whatever treatment plans that can help her. I do know that sometimes a dog's HD is so severe that their quality of life is just too low. Seriously consider her pain and decide if she's living a good life, despite the pain. I only mentioned this because I don't know how severe her HD is.

I *think* I covered everything. Ask questions if I missed anything :)

It can be done, it's just not an easy fix and does require a lot of effort on your part. Part of the ""joys"" of owning a high energy breed haha",2015-07-08 23:03:44+00:00,cswrq7v,1.0,t3_3cl1om,14187.0,Dogtraining

It doesn't work like that. It took months for my anxious, formerly ignored dog to fully settle down. He previously spent all of his time in a dog run/kennel, only interacting with humans for gundog training. Suddenly sticking him in an apartment was extremely stressful and he didn't know how to exist. It's pretty much the same deal here.

If you decide to try again, you're going to want to find a behaviorist that uses positive reinforcement. When there's aggression involved, a trainer usually isn't qualified enough to really conquer the issue. 

Do I think there is hope for this dog? Yes. But unless you're going to take him, it sounds like his fate is sealed. Rescues and things won't take him because there are tons of dogs who aren't aggressive that would be put to sleep if they're not pulled from a shelter.

But there's a ton of stuff going on here that only a behaviorist would be able to evaluate. 

It could be as simple as he's not getting enough exercise (he is a collie, after all), or as complex as fear towards a specific set of qualities.

This means ABSOLUTELY NOTHING and, I'm sorry, but just sounds so stupid.

You are literally creating all of his anxiety and fear. You are literally doing nothing to help this dog, just suppressing his outward displays of this fear.

Dogs do not try to dominate humans. You are not a dog, and your dog knows this. He NEVER tried to dominate you. It's not a thing.

[Here](http://www.whole-dog-journal.com/issues/14_12/features/Alpha-Dogs_20416-1.html) is just one of a gazillion articles explaining the dominance theory myth. Even the researcher that first hypothesized the theory has since revoked it.

There's also clearance sections, discount stores (like Marshall's), and eBay.

4474,"&gt;an orange toy on green grass looks, to a dog, like a light brown thing on a grey surface

Thank you for mentioning this. I was doing a little research, and most of what I was reading was telling me to get a white dummy, so he could see it against the grass. But some of it was telling me to get an orange dummy because hunters/trainers typically just jump ahead and start with those anyway (though it's a little harder). I think I'm going to buy one of each and see how he does.

&gt;You can also put one of those 'dummies' at the end of a flirt pole


Like almost any toy, he LOVES to play...but only inside. But if I can somehow get back to the basics and train this as a job, maybe I'll eventually get him to the point where he does his job outside, too. I think he equates the outdoors with work only, so he doesn't want to play.

I'm going to start ordering some supplies this weekend, after I go through the book fully again. I'm also going to do some more research on traditional gundog training to see if I could pinpoint the general stage he may have stopped at. 

My SO and I talked briefly, and he's just as intrigued as I am about this, so we're going to work hard to see what sorts of things we need to change in our training and routines.

4488,"[Sorry for the essay. I don't expect you to respond to everything. I'm just excited with this new insight haha]

That's an absolutely fantastic theory/epiphany! My knowledge of gundog training only goes so far, so I never knew the exact way training was started. If he did begin training on a harness, then that's spot on. In fact, I'd say all of what you said is pretty spot on.

&gt;The dog won't grab the pheasant

He killed a robin a few weeks ago. But, to be fair, I think it had a broken wing already, and it wasn't moving, so he may have originally thought it was dead and just got too excited when it tried to fly away. Not really important, just a funny story.

&gt;why he's such a nightmare on walks (which I hope are getting better)

They're *slowly* getting better. He has his moments, but if I look back to how he was when we brought him home 2 years ago, he's made a giant improvement. 

&gt;I don't think he advanced far enough in the gundog training to have gathered a target

Again, I don't know much about the actual process of gundog training, but he would have certainly been surrendered to the shelter sometime after it was discovered (or he was pushed to be) gunshy. His noise anxiety is *horrible*. So horrible that we're thinking about adding Xanax to his desensitization routine. So, I don't think he got far at all.

So it sounds like he's ""stuck"" in whatever stage he left training, right? I always wondered if I should be doing specific training to cater to his breed. I bought [this](http://www.amazon.com/Positive-Gun-Dogs-Training-Sporting/dp/1890948330/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1435156373&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=positive+gun+dog) book, but it was honestly pretty disappointing. But I'm going to go back through it today and see if I can use anything from the book since I have this new insight into his little bird brain.

&gt;When you're out and playing like this, transition your dog to a back clip harness in a controlled environment, not one of the no-pull harnesses

We use [this](http://www.canadog.ca/dog-harness-shorty-ripstop-vivid/) harness for most things, and [this](http://www.ruffwear.com/Web-Master-Harness_2?sc=2&amp;category=1131) one for biking (if it matters). I think I'll soon be replacing those with [this](http://www.alpineoutfitters.net/scripts/prodView.asp?idproduct=177) for walking, and a harness that clips at the side (which I can't seem to find right now) for biking.

I prefer back attaching harnesses for him because he does pull a little less than with other harnesses or his collar. Do you think I should make one of the harnesses his ""working"" harness, and use it specifically when training/working/playing with the launcher?

Also, though I've never tried working with a training dummy, I cannot for the life of me get him to play outside. *Maybe* things with the dummy will be different, but even when I put bird scent on his toys (pheasant, if I remember correctly) he didn't care about it. He does play indoors, so we've moved play into the basement so he can run (there's barely anything in our basement), but have never been able to get him to do anything outside. 

I'm also pretty nervous about that launcher. It's supposed to imitate the sound of a gunshot. Not only do I not have any fields or (unused) parks in my immediate area, so I'd be freaking out my neighbors and their dogs, but my dog would probably piss himself with fear. But we tend to put off mowing our lawn so the grass gets pretty tall. Maybe that would make it a little more exciting. Maybe.

But thanks so much for all of this! This has opened a whole new wealth of information for me! ",2015-06-24 14:47:35+00:00,csh3489,8.0,t1_csh0wyb,3907.0,Dogtraining

The ONLY example I can think of right now is if it came to something like fence jumping. I have a fence jumper. He jumps when he thinks nobody is watching him, when he's chasing a bird, and when he's startled. Not that I would ever do this, and I never have, but if I could punish him the instant I knew he was making that decision to go over the fence, before he's gotten over it, in an attempt to keep him safe in the long run, then so be it. And the fact that this lesson would potentially be saving his life (we live very close to an interstate highway), then the benefits of that sort of training would outweigh the risks.

But to punish something that has already been done, and to do so in a way where you're risking building upon any anxiety or reactivity, is just pointless. It's just a knee-jerk reaction that will not solve the problem.",2015-06-24 05:50:25+00:00,csgsmw5,5.0,t1_csgs202,1594.0,Dogtraining

I might be wrong, but I heard that Chris Carter thought the show could go on for decades with different cast members, but wanted to end the show at season 7, but Fox renewed the series so he had to continue the show.

&gt;I was pissed off that Scully gave William away.

I think I understand the reasoning. She got rid of him to protect him. However, that logic is flawed because had anyone really wanted to find William, it wouldn't have been hard at all.

- Where will you be during various points in your dog's life? Where will you be 10 years from now? Will you be able to afford the costs associated with an elderly dog?

- Can you afford a trainer? Can you afford a behaviorist if you find you need one?

- Do you like going out on weekends? Where will your dog be?

- Do you understand, and are you willing to meet, the socialization requirements of a puppy or even an adult dog?",2015-06-16 22:55:25+00:00,cs8x85t,2.0,t1_cs8snki,7417.0,Dogtraining

4606,"I get the feeling your whole mentality towards training is at least a little out of date. I know you said you practice positive reinforcement, but anything dominance-related needs to be removed from your brain. I'd start in the sidebar and start doing some research.

I also recommend getting into a class. I don't mean for this to sound rude, but it doesn't really sound like you know what you're doing. It sounds like you have a general idea, but you're pulling bits and pieces from different methods and it's not working out for you. There's a link in the sidebar to help you choose a good trainer. After all, a dog trainer is training YOU how to train your dog. ",2015-06-16 16:58:51+00:00,cs8j1vh,3.0,t1_cs8iw9i,219.0,Dogtraining

You also need to take a minute and reflect on yourself. Do you have an anger issue? Is this something that's ingrained because of years of believe dominance theory, or because it's your default response to anger? ",2015-06-16 16:27:08+00:00,cs8hr43,1.0,t3_3a1x3h,483.0,Dogtraining

4610,"In my opinion, you're asking for too much out of your dog.

Heeling, which is essentially what you're trying to do, is a very complex task that requires a ton of impulse control and self discipline. You also have a very large dog with a large gait. It doesn't take more than half a step to be in front of you. Humans are also incredibly slow compared to dogs. So what you're actually asking your dog to do is pay attention to you 100%, walk drastically slower than is natural, ignore every distraction out there, and pay attention to your position.

So, ask yourself, is walking in the perfect position that important to you? You already said you don't care about a few aspects of her training, so why is this one so important? Even seasoned trainers don't usually require their dog to walk in a perfect heel.",2015-06-16 14:55:20+00:00,cs8ea3c,1.0,t3_3a0ntk,22887.0,Dogtraining

It's his cat. If he doesn't want them interacting, then don't let them. It'd be like walking into a pet store, letting your dog loose, and saying, ""No, really, it's okay. He's not hurting anyone!""

His cat, his rules. Your dog, your rules. If you can't trust him with your dog while you're not around, crate the dog or leave him at doggy daycare.",2015-06-16 12:41:16+00:00,cs8aaj3,1.0,t3_39znmi,37793.0,Dogtraining
