I'm looking to buy my SO a DSLR. He doesn't really need anything fancy, so I was looking for an older model, trying not to spend any more than $150, if possible.

I have a Nikon D5500, so I'm really looking for another Nikon so we can swap lenses. He does need to be able to shoot in RAW format, in manual mode, and have a *minimum* of 8 MP (all required for some classes he's going to take).

It would be nice if we could also share the same batteries, but I'm sure that's asking too much, and isn't totally necessary.

I found a D5000 and a D3000 on eBay that seem to be in great condition, coming in at $140 and $125, respectively. However, I'm not sure if I should be looking at something else, or if these cameras have some fatal flaw or are incompatible with my lenses for some reason.

Probably important, he *wants* a D5500, like mine, but doesn't *need* it at this point. He needs a good balance between ""good for beginners/students"" and ""can last you a few more years.""

Any advice or recommendations?

I just wanted to get an early introduction post up since I'll be super busy this weekend and probably won't be on Reddit much.

My name is Cody. I'm 26/F. I was on Team Pollen last challenge, and kind of fell off the wagon towards the end. It was a rough few months, so while I didn't gain anything, I didn't lose much at all. So, naturally, I got discouraged and stopped trying.

But I'm setting myself up for success this time around. My goals are going to be smaller. My largest goal is I want to reach Onederland by the end of this challenge (September?). I'm also going to hang around here and /r/loseit every single day to hold myself accountable and help others who might be struggling.

At my heaviest recorded weight, I was 235 lbs. I would not be surprised at all if I hit 250 lbs at my heaviest ever.

I got so heavy during college. I was struggling with some severe bipolar/depression and cognitive problems (caused by meds). My meds made me feel permanently hungry, so I was eating everything, but I was also experiencing body pain and drowsiness as side effects, so I rarely left my couch. That's the perfect way to gain 70 lbs in 1-2 years.

But I'm generally doing better now, so I'm trying to get my weight under control again.

My overall goal is somewhere around 150 lbs, and muscular.

I have two beginner questions for you.

I'm using a Nikon D5500 with an AF-S 50mm Nikkor 1.8G lens (I'm not sure the proper way of identifying lenses)

1. I was taking some pictures yesterday (in manual mode; RAW format) and in my viewfinder, Live View, and the playback, the thing I wanted to focus on looked perfect (by my low standards). But when I uploaded the image(s) to my computer, it turns out that I actually focused on something else.

Why is it that everything else expect the final image on my computer appears correct?

2. Right now, I'm sort of playing around with taking pictures of different things. I don't have a solid preference of subject yet. I'm interested in trying to do action sports photography (or even just sports in general). What sorts of settings and gear would I need to do this kind of thing?

A while ago, I got copies of the 1920 and 1930 census for my great grandfather and his family (maternal side). This is from Chicago, and the addresses have changed since then.

I was wondering if someone know what these addresses might be today. I tried to figure it out myself, and the location I determined was wrong (this was a few months ago, and I don't remember the answer I came up with).

The 1920 census says they were living at 1337 Holt St. in Chicago (Ward 16).

The 1930 census says they were living in Ward 33, Block 120, House number 1450, also in Chicago.

FWIW, my great grandfather immigrated in 1907, but I have yet to find out where he was living. The rest of the family came in 1912, and they went back to Poland sometime before WWII.

I'm a graphic design student, so I spend a lot of my time using Adobe programs. The absolute most I ever have running/open at one time is Safari, Spotify (or iTunes), and some dual combination of InDesign/Illustrator/Photoshop (usually Illustrator and Photoshop). That's the maximum. Usually it's just Illustrator, Safari, and *maybe* Spotify.

Problem is, even if it's *only* Photoshop running, the computer will sometimes freeze, the program will crash, or I'll get an error message in Adobe that says some form of ""Cannot display GPU preview.""

Is this a sign I need to upgrade my RAM? Or could this be some other issue?

I had assumed 8 GB RAM would be good enough for now, especially since I'm not doing any insane art, but maybe I was wrong?

[This](http://i.imgur.com/ZpUC6g4.png) is what I have so far. 

After speaking with my teacher, the plan was to kind of give it a mosaic/stained glass sort of look. But now that I have my dog's spots finished, I feel like it will quickly get WAY too busy. Plus, I don't really want to bury his spots in with the rest of the design. I was thinking maybe something like stars or octagons for the rest of his body?

Does anyone have any ideas? Any styles or methods that would work really well here? I've only been using Illustrator for a few months now, so I'm still discovering new things people are doing with the program.

Also, does anyone have any ideas for a good background? I want to do something awesome, but I don't want the overall design to look too busy. I was thinking if I did stars for my dog's body, I could do some sort of trippy space-looking background. But I don't want it to look dumb.

It's come time for me to replace my dog's (70 lb GSP) harness, so I've been looking around a bit, and was hoping someone had experience with any of these harnesses I've found.

What I need from a harness:

-Heavily padded, or padded/soft enough to not chafe my dog (has almost no hair on his stomach or behind his arms)

-Insanely sturdy. Not only is he a heavy puller (working on it), but we use the harness when we allow him to run around fields on a 50 foot leash

-Hard to back out of. There are rare occasions where he'll see a bird (or thinks he sees one) and he'll immediately begin thrashing, pulling, lunging, and jumping. While on walks, this isn't too big of an issue, but when he's 50' away (and *completely* ignoring recall), he can easily slip out of a harness before we get to him

I would also love if it didn't have any thick chest or back plates to slide around. When he's running with the 50' leash, he runs in a counter-clockwise direction ONLY, so harnesses like Ruffwear's Webmaster or Front Range slide off to the side

The contenders (in order of how much *I* think I like them): 

[Balance Harness](https://www.cleanrun.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=product.display&amp;product_ID=4206&amp;ParentCat=202): I just wish this were padded...any good ways to do this?

[Original Fleece Lined](https://www.cleanrun.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=product.display&amp;product_ID=3930&amp;ParentCat=202#panel2)

[Crossover Harness](https://www.cleanrun.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=product.display&amp;product_ID=3997&amp;ParentCat=202): Not very adjustable; how easy would it be to escape this if it didn't fit perfectly? Is it a solid harness, or are there some weak parts that could be a problem with a puller?

[Easy Sport](https://www.cleanrun.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=product.display&amp;product_ID=3725&amp;ParentCat=202#panel1): I don't know, PetSafe products always felt a little low quality to me, but I like the design

[All Safe car safety harness](https://www.cleanrun.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=product.display&amp;product_ID=3577&amp;ParentCat=202#panel1): Just because it would be nice to have something I *know* is intended to not break with force, plus it would be nice to have something to keep him safe in the car (though I'm sure there are higher rated ones). There's no reason these can't be used whenever a harness is needed, right?

Also, does anyone think any Hurtta harnesses would work? They look escapable, but I've always liked the quality of Hurtta products in the past.

I kept falling off the wagon. Between stress, mental health issues, the holidays, and general ""The only food we have in the house is junk food"" moments, my weight loss journey stalled big time. 

And I was getting insanely discouraged because this was, I don't know, probably my fifth time making a significant effort to lose weight. I was doing everything right. Counting calories, exercising, eating better things...it just wasn't working.

So, this time around, I changed how I was approaching the issue.

I already knew that I wasn't eating *horribly*. I don't eat the best things, but I'm not eating at Taco Bell every day. 

I also already knew that I'm burning an acceptable (to me) amount of calories in a day (Thanks, FitBit).

But where I was really struggling was with adding more exercise due to pain, and portion control. 

I knew I couldn't do much to address the pain at the moment, so I decided that I'll add more exercise once I've lost enough weight that the pain isn't as noticeable. It'll take longer to get to my goal, but if that's what I have to do, it's what I'll do.

That meant tackling my portion sizes. Over the years, I built up a stomach that could eat an entire frozen pizza as if its what I was designed to do. It was becoming extremely embarrassing, but I never felt satiated unless I ate huge portions. 

I started by being hyper aware of when I started feeling full. I'd still get my normal portions (I know, wasteful. But my SO ate most of the leftovers for his lunches at work), but would make sure to drink a lot of water (seriously, guys. If you can drink about a bottle of water [16.9 fl oz] before you eat, it helps A TON with portion control) and eat a little slower. 

And, guys, I'm finally at a point where my stomach is telling me ""you're full now,"" again! It had been years since I'd gotten the ""you're full"" message instead of the ""OMG, why did you eat all of that?"" message.

I also added ""Fiber Choice"" brand chews to my diet, and it's working out wonderfully well. I'm still not eating the best I can be, and my portions are still bigger than what I'd like them to be, but I'm *finally*, after I don't know how many years, seeing actual progress and positive change.

I have a question about what I am/am not allowed to do when pulling inspiration from another source.

I participate in Postcrossing (sending postcards to strangers in other countries), and realized I could save some money, as well as have a lot of fun and practice refining my skills if I created my own cards. *Maybe* even sell them if I like them enough (which is where my problem comes in).

I really love [Postallove's Greetings from...](https://www.postallove.com/Postcards/Greetings-from/Greetings-from-USA) cards, and was thinking about doing something similar.

Good thing I figured out you don't have to have kids just because you're married.

I still live with cats though.

Anyway. I'm lucky enough that my high school sweetheart/boyfriend (been together for a little over 10 years now!) also hates kids (so much so that he hopes like hell that none of our siblings ever pop out any so he has 0 contact). He's more than supportive of me getting sterilized. 

So, I found out a couple of months ago that a doctor at my closest Planned Parenthood is on the list of CF-friendly doctors, so I decided I would find out if my insurance covered it.

I kept putting it off, but finally called them today. Sterilization would be covered in full after a 30 day waiting period! Well, a tubal would be. The lady from the insurance company wasn't 100% sure if Essure is covered (which is what Planned Parenthood does), but she advised me to just start the process and don't worry about it (tubal vs Essure) unless it becomes an issue. 

So, my next step is to make an appointment at Planned Parenthood! 

This is exciting! I'm nervous, but excited!

I hope this is allowed here. If not, let me know and I'll happy move it somewhere else.

I'm trying to decide what to do with my academic career, and could use a little outside opinion and advice.

**Background:** I have a BA in Psychology. Until this current semester, I had not taken *any* form of art class in about 15 years. I never saw myself going into the arts, and honestly didn't ""get"" art. But as I grew more and more frustrated by not finding anything I loved enough to want to pursue as a career, I started looking at the arts.

I've just started taking Graphic Design courses this semester (currently in an Adobe Illustrator class, and an Adobe InDesign class) and, holy crap, I *love* it. I'm not totally sure *what* I want to do within graphic design (I love some aspects of certain jobs, but not other aspects, but that's a different issue), but I'm just so happy to have found it.

**Currently:** I am back at my local community college, taking Graphic Design courses to work my way up to an Associate's in Applied Science in Graphic Design. I'm only one semester into it, and it would take me 2-3 years to finish, depending on how many classes I take each semester.

**Question:** Would an AAS in Graphic Design (with my completed BA in Psychology) be good enough to land a stable job? Or should I continue on to get a MA/MFA in Graphic Design (or a related field)?

On the one hand, I have always seen myself going to graduate school. When I was in high school, that was always a goal of mine. I know I don't *need* it, but I *want* it. 

But it's so damn expensive, and I wouldn't be able to get into the field right away.

Are there real benefits to getting a graduate degree? Could it possibly turn into a situation where the demand for graduate degrees increases, thereby making me more employable?

Is it worth the investment, beyond just making 16-year old me happy? Because 16-year old me also thought I'd be a scientist of some sort by now, and this is a completely different field. 

Should I wait it out until I actually have an idea of what I want to do within the field?

We would be getting the 98 inch counter top (SÄLJAN weighs 82 lbs, 10 oz; EKBACKEN weighs 62 lbs, 6 oz), and then would be using 3 ALEX units (one on each side, and one in the middle). 

Would the ALEX units support the weight of the countertop in addition to our two desktop computers? Or should we just stick with a regular desk (we're looking into the MALMs, but wanted the extra space the countertop provided).

He's fed primarily out of puzzle toys of some sort 90% of the time, and usually that was just freezing his food in a couple of Kongs.

But then I discovered a new way to drive him nuts.

First, I piece of bread at the bottom of the [Orbee-Tuff Snoop](http://www.planetdog.com/orbee-tuff-snoop) (the lip of the toy pulls out so you can get stuff under the edges). Then, I laid one of [these](http://aussienaturals.org/store2/all-natural-dog-chews/salmon-cigar-half/) in horizontally. Then I put canned tuna on top (the bread and the skin absorbed the tuna water so it didn't turn into a mess), and inverted/closed the lip.

Note: This toy probably isn't a very good idea for dogs who have a tendency to destroy their toys. The rubber is very tough, but if the dog were to pierce the rubber, he could definitely tear it apart. But the toy is top-rack dishwasher safe, and actually cleans quite nicely.

My dog has all of his other puzzle toys and feeders figured out. This one took him from 10 am until 7 pm (when I relented and gave him the skin) of near constant interaction. He only stopped to drink and come say 'hi' to us as we came home from school/work. 

Because the salmon skin becomes moist, it's very difficult to pull out of the hole, so it kept him VERY busy. He's currently dead asleep, and hasn't even asked for dinner yet.

Try it! You'll absolutely love it!

Edit: The toy can definitely be destroyed. Little chihuahua puppy teeth shredded part of the lip.

I bought this car new with 12 miles on it. It was my first car, so I treated it like my fucking child. But it's always been a bit of a lemon. Within the first week of buying it, I had to bring it back to the dealer to get the radio antenna replaced. 

I have a list of issues that have cropped up in the past, but it seems like this winter is causing all of them to become an issue at once. Kia wants a *minimum* of $99 to just look at the car (which I don't have), so I'm looking for some advice (including if I should dump money into repairs, or just start saving for a new/new-to-me car).

-About a year or two ago, the radio stopped working. It will only work on Auxillary, and the buttons do not work. Volume and power work, but I cannot change to radio, CD, etc. On the rare occasion the buttons work, I can switch it to radio (or if I unplug the aux cable, it will switch to radio) I cannot switch it back. Very randomly, it will switch to Aux when we push the button. 

-For about a year now, the car makes electrical buzzing noises. The best way I can describe it is like if a fly or a bee were repeatedly flying towards your ear, and away again. Very short, but audible Bzzd, Bzzd, Bzzd noises. With this, the dash lights flicker, the heat/AC/defroster stops working for anywhere from a second to not working at all. Often occurs if I'm using more than one component, such as the headlights and windshield wipers, at the same time. The entire radio console shuts down, heat/AC/defroster shuts down, and the car becomes silent, as if the engine has shut down, but the car still drives normally. This shutting down lasts about 3 seconds.

-Air bag lights are on (so, no air bags). We brought this in to Kia because there was a recall on *some* Rio VIN numbers for an airbag sensor, but my VIN is not included in this recall. They said all they would be able to do is replace every single sensor and air bag component because they do not know which is failing. 

-Car is sluggish in less-than-perfect weather. If it's freezing, mildly cold, mildly warm, hot, rainy, etc. the car is very sluggish when pulling away from the curb/out of the driveway. It also sort of jolts forward when I press the accelerator. Sort of like there's a delay in the car's recognition that I'm trying to accelerate. Only last for a second or two. This occurs whether I allow the engine to warm up first or not.

-The car would not start on two occasions, despite installing a brand new battery last winter. The first time, the car had worked normally (well, normal for the car) at 4 am, in the cold, and was able to get my boyfriend to work without an issue (about 2 minutes drive away). When he tried to come home for lunch at about 8 or 9 am, when it had warmed up a bit and the sun was out, the car would not start. It clicked, but would not turn over. So, boyfriend stayed at work. When he got off his shift, the car started without an issue.

The second time, we were in a parking garage (not terribly cold, but not climate controlled). We were only parked there for about 20 minutes, after driving about 15 miles without an issue. The car would not click, would not turn over. It started when we turned the car off, shifted to neutral, tried to start it, turned it off, put it back in park, and tried starting it again. It started up again a little slowly, but didn't have another issue.

Both of these occurred on consecutive days. I think it was a Wednesday and a Thursday.

-Most recently, the heat/AC/defroster do not work **at all**. We were driving home one day when the heat (which was on the highest temperature setting, but at a 1 or 2 power/strength setting) just shut off completely. There was no noise, no air, nothing. The next day, when we tried it again, you could hear the very faintest of noise, like something somewhere was trying to work, but nothing was happening. I have to drive with the windows open so the windshield remains clear.

Randomly, the heat/AC/defroster started working again yesterday. I didn't test it fully (I'm so scared I'm going to do something that will make my car die completely), but it seems to be blowing at about 75% power.

We believe this all may be an electrical issue, but Kia and an independent mechanic both told us that we can pay a lot of money for them to explore the issues, or we have to wait for the car to die completely and have it towed. I get it, but I don't want to have to wait for this car to break down somewhere.

As I said, battery was brand new last year. UTD on basic maintenance. We were questioning whether or not we needed a new alternator, but a mechanic (who we did not end up bringing the car to) said he didn't believe it was the alternator, but the battery. There are no visible signs of corrosion or excessive wear under the hood.

Ideas? Advice?

Should I ditch this car? Or would all of my issues be solved by fixing something simple?

I've only recently found this sub, and have done a little lurking. 

I have a Bachelor's, but I wanted to change my major before going to grad school. 

Originally, I was just going to do a general MA in Computer Science, so I was taking basic CS classes at my school (I have NO background in CS, so I needed to learn the basics). But now I believe I'd like to go into UX. [This](http://www.cdm.depaul.edu/academics/Pages/MSInHuman-ComputerInteraction.aspx) is the HCI program I'm interested in.

So, if I want to go into UX, what classes should I be taking at my current school this coming semester (Waubonsee Community College, if anyone wanted to look around for any reason)?

Right now, I'm enrolled in Java Programming and Calculus II, but I'm willing to change those.

-Is UX/HCI math and physics heavy? Should I continue my math sequence and eventually take physics?

-Should I be taking some graphic design or computer drafting courses?

-Should I be taking art or design classes? (I'm not artistic or creative at all, so it'd be nice to begin building a foundation somehow)

-Should I just continue to focus on coding/CS classes?

I ask because he's a Pointer, so there is the potential that he spots something he wants to chase. In the past, when he's running, he's pretty good at not pulling, but there's always that risk.

I'm pretty much new here. I *might* have lurked around here (or someplace similar) in the past, but it's been quite some time, so I apologize if I'm stepping on some toes or posting a repeated question.

The time has come for me to choose my Spring semester classes, and I'm looking for some advice and opinions.

Some background that is only partially necessary: I graduated with a BA in Psychology in 2014 and decided my senior year that I didn't really want to have anything to do with a career in Psychology, but it was too late to explore other options, so I had to stick with it.

Now I'm back at my community college, both to keep my loans in deferment and to figure out a more suitable career field.

Graduate school has always been on my radar. It's just one of those things that I need to accomplish to feel complete. But I'm still sort of exploring fields. 

I *think* what I'd love to do is design mobile apps, especially if I'm freelancing or working from home. So, right now, I'm working towards that.

Plus, a local university has a Human and Computer Interaction Master's program that sounds pretty interesting.

But, anyway, **my question:**

I'm still getting the hang of coding, so my plan is to take a coding class and an ""easy"" class that still fulfills my gen eds/required courses as electives. 

I was thinking that a course in some sort of art or design might be helpful in at least a small way, but I'm concerned that I'd end up taking a pointless class.

**Would an art or design course help with mobile app development?** 

My options are: 

-Art Appreciation (a recommended, but not required prerequisite for other art classes...plus I know *nothing* about art. I was always a science-oriented girl) 

-Drawing (more for me, but the skill might help on some level)

-Design (might require expensive software) 

-or a combined Technical Drawing/Computer Aided Drafting class.

So, what do you think? Helpful? Waste of time? Is there some other field that might be helpful but offers easier courses?

Ninjaedit: I've already taken a web design course, as well as basic programming (Python), but that's pretty much it. I plan on taking Java, which is the prerequisite for my school's mobile app development course.

I've posted about my...unique GSP multiple times. I've started doing some major out-of-the-box thinking (I'll be posting in the future about how I taught my dog ""Get it!"") and I'm starting to see improvements in my dog's training.

The problem is, my SO doesn't have the kind of patience I do. Dog training isn't a hobby of his like it is for me. In conversation, my SO completely understands the basics of dog training. He fully understands things like dominance theory being crap, don't punish growling, dogs don't understand what they're being punished for, and much of our responsibility is management to prevent bad behaviors. He *understands* it. 

The problem is, he's impatient and once he's angry/frustrated/disappointed, he sort of ""loses"" that understanding. He's definitely not violent or abusive in any way, but he yells at the dog(s) (we live other dogs that are not mine), cannot handle training sessions longer than a couple of minutes, and would rather not deal with the dog(s) when it comes to training/managing bad behaviors.

Our dog is incredibly frustrating, and I understand that, but it's not the dog's fault.

What sorts of books can I pick up for my SO to help him understand how dogs operate and how to address issues as they come up? Something that doesn't read like a scientific paper, but also isn't dumbed down would be best. 

I own ""When Pigs Fly!"" and ""Bones Would Rain from the Sky,"" but my SO has never read them. Is there anything else that would be helpful?

I've been there twice since finding it, and overall I've been extremely pleased with the cuts I've received.

The problem is, the girl who cuts my hair lacks a lot of confidence, and while her teachers are very nice, I don't know if there's anything I can do personally to help boost her confidence.

As a client, I'm VERY patient. I have a very strong, ""Psh! It's just hair! Go nuts and have fun with it!"" attitude about my hair, which sounds like is extremely rare in the whole hair-cutting world. I sometimes have to remind her that I honestly don't care if it ends up looking horrible, and she has seen first-hand how ridiculously fast it grows, but she's still extremely hesitant, and I *think* I saw her trying to hold back tears while she was cutting my hair.

I feel bad for her. It sounds like she's getting yelled at by some clients (why go to a beauty school and get mad when you don't witness perfection?), and she's completely capable, but is just struggling a little. I'm also her very first repeat customer, despite the fact that she's been doing this for almost a year.

So is there anything I can do? I gave her a big tip and told her I'd return (which I would have done even if she didn't look like she was about to curl up in a corner and cry), but can I do more? Should I keep reassuring her? Say something different? Stop talking? Let her gain her own confidence?

If it matters at all, I bring in pictures of the style I want, and the teachers tell her how to do it without an issue. Would it help if I just told her to do something cool that she's always wanted to try? I could add her on Facebook and tell her this plan ahead of time. Should I send my boyfriend (who has a similar ""it's whatever"" attitude) to her for more practice?

I've gotten great advice here in the past, so I'm hoping for more excellent tips!

[Here](http://imgur.com/iU3SXNq) is the most recent hairstyle I got, which happened sometime during the last week of August, if I remember correctly, so I'm overdue for a trim.

[This](http://imgur.com/OabXGb4) is how the haircut looked. This picture was taken as soon as I got in my car on a windy day, so it's mostly still how the stylist left it, but the wind did mess it up a little. 

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/AVXvx) is what my hair looks like today. I'll be getting it trimmed sometime next week.

Overall, I was extremely happy with the cut I received. It was one of maybe two times in my life where I got almost exactly what I was asking for.

However, I've always wanted a cut with a little bit of waves, and I've never really known how to accomplish this (I'm a moron when it comes to hair).

I want to try to get some waves like [this](http://imgur.com/dyFFzY4) or [this](http://imgur.com/LUfMh7A).

My stylist gave me some [Texture Touch](http://www.amazon.com/WELLA-Texture-Touch-Reworkable-2-51oz/dp/B004XJI9RU) which works pretty well, but I'm not opposed to buying other products.

My main goal is to be able to do something like that without a curling iron or blow dryer. As simple as possible, really. Is this possible?

Is this just a matter of ""training"" my hair to maintain that shape?

I'll preface this by saying I'm fairly new to deciding to get my MLIS. I have a BA in Psychology, but I never really wanted to do anything with my degree career-wise, so after graduating, I've been taking classes at my local community college for a few reasons. Primarily being, my university will not release my diploma or transcripts until my bill is paid off (I have about a year left on it, unless I get about $1800 to pay it off before then). I therefore also need to take at least 6 credit hours each semester to keep my loans in deferment. And, finally, I just don't never knew what I really wanted to do.

I've only recently realized I want to get my MLIS, and I *think* I'm leaning towards archival studies, but that may very well change as I do a little more research. 

Now, my actual question.

There are essentially two things I can do until I'm able to enroll in graduate school (about a year).

**Option 1:** Keep taking classes at my community college until I'm ready to enroll in grad school, with a focus on computer science/networking classes. I have enough credits to be able to get an Associates in Computer Science, though, if I remember correctly, I can get a Certificate in Networking. 

I've heard it's good to have a background in computers and networking to boost job options in the field.

From here, I would likely just apply to SJSU and go there. I like their no-fuss admissions.

**Option 2:** Go to the neighboring community college, pay *slightly* more for tuition (roughly $30 more per credit hour) and get an Associate's in Library and Information Technology. This would take me about two years to finish, but I'm honestly not in a HUGE rush to get into grad school. I can spend the extra time taking the GRE, getting to know professors for better letters of recommendation, and boosting my credit score/paying off some debt.

One of my prospect schools, Dominican University, supposedly offers a 50% discount on tuition for their core MLIS classes if you have a LTA degree, which is nice. 

**Option 3:** You tell me.

I'm leaning towards Option 1, but I don't know if some other option would make me more employable or make my graduate school experience easier. As much as I would love to attend classes on campus, online learning fits into my lifestyle the best, especially since I'm not really in the best financial position to move.

So, what do you think?

I've also been doing online classes for a while now, so an online degree doesn't deter me.

The problem is, he becomes so overstimulated and overwhelmed that he trembles, and eventually shuts down.

We always thought this would get better as we trained more with him outside. It wasn't. So we started just doing things like putting his leash on and not going anywhere, sitting on the front porch, and walking around the front yard. 

I noticed today that things have gotten much worse, to the point where I almost feel like we might be traumatizing him.

I tried to get a video today, but my phone's camera doesn't pick up the trembling well. It's about the same sort of trembling you would experience if you were out in just-above-freezing weather. Not quite convulsions, but definitely like strong shivering. And he'll do this whether it's 95F or -10F.

If I were to theorize on what's going on, I would say it's overexcitement mixed with uncertainty, lack of confidence, and eventually leads to a total shut down, especially if I try to wait it out or we don't get moving right away. Needless to say, he won't take treats or play at all once he starts trembling, but it occurs so quickly, there's no real threshold I can work with. It's like a switch is being flipped.

Once we're actually moving, whether that be on a walk or driving, he does eventually calm dog again. It isn't instantaneous, but you can tell he's relieved pretty quickly once he figures out what we're doing. But if we just stand there, and especially if we ask for something like a sit or just ""wait"" (he's a door bolter) he panics.

So, what do I do?

I've tried things to calm him for his storm anxiety without much relief, and those mild effects didn't transfer to this problem. I can't really afford medication for him at this time, but I could probably figure something out of there's no further conditioning/training I can try.

Today I discovered that the AC was turning on, even though the dial was in the OFF position, for a split second. It happened three times during one trip: once after sitting in the car (running but in park) for about 2 minutes, again after about 2 more minutes (still in park, hadn't driven yet), and then once more just a minute or two after reversing out of my driveway (coasting, so 10 mph?).

At the time, the headlights and radio (using auxiliary) were on.

This was the first time I ever experienced this, but my SO sort of shyly said, ""oh, yeah, that's happened a few times to me too,"" which pretty much means, ""it happens a lot, but I didn't tell you because we're not getting rid of this car,"" (I hate this car; it's always been a lemon).

Other things wrong with it that might hint at a main issue:

-radio not fully functional. We can power it on and off and can change the volume, but none of the other buttons work. If the mode/input is changed (such as when it switches back to RADIO if the auxiliary cable comes unplugged), it will be stuck there for weeks until it magically decides to work (this is very rare, and we've never figured out a pattern. We'll randomly push the button for auxiliary in the hopes that it will work and suddenly it works, but ONLY to do that)

-air bags do not work (my VIN number was not part of the recall and they want $1000+ to fix just the passenger side alone). Air bag light has been on for about 6 months now (I know, it's unsafe, but I'm a college student with no money)

-In the past, we've had issues with things not working if too many components were being used. For example, if we had the radio, headlights, and windshield wipers on at the same time, the headlights would dim a little every time the wipers moved. This issue *mostly* resolved itself when we changed the battery (turned out mechanic gave us the wrong battery, and a very low quality brand). Before we figured out the battery was the issue, we assumed the alternator was starting to go.

-AC does not blow cold air. If you're in park, right before you've gone anywhere, the AC will blow cold enough to make the cabin temperature tolerable, but once you drive it just blows air

-Transmission (automatic) *might* be starting to have issues. The car vibrates/bounces when idle at a stoplight, but typically only when on a long drive (1+ hours) in bad weather (extremely hot/cold). If it hasn't been driven longer than 24 hours, it does suddenly lurch forward when coming out of park, but only if it's put in drive (like with street parking). I'll push on the accelerator and nothing will happen for 1-2 seconds and then WOOSH! it's like I floored it.

That's all I can think of for now. It is due for an oil change, and probably some other fluids, but last time it was taken in, the mechanic said all of the belts and hoses looked good. He just said to start saving up for the timing belt since it should be changed sometime soon (but was in good condition at the time).

So, what is this dumb little car doing now? I need it to survive about another year, though I'd definitely keep it around if it didn't turn into a money pit.

When I was a teenager, I wanted my first car to be a Baja. I don't know why, but I was just drawn to the Baja.

Instead, I ended up with a crappy Kia Rio. 

I bought my car new, kept up on all the maintenance like I was supposed to. I wanted my first car to last me a long time. Well, despite all of that, I now have a car with no AC, no airbags, a transmission that is starting to go, faulty electrical, and paint is falling off like it nail polish; plus now needing things like the timing belt, struts, etc. soon. All of this being less than 10 years old, with 85k miles on it. The car is now worth about $3k, IF I were to fix it up first. I don't want to pour money into a car I hate.

So, I've been thinking about trading it in and getting a Subaru, but I would be ""downgrading"" a bit. I'd probably be looking at car slightly older than mine, with more miles.

First, is this dumb?

Second, can Subaru reliably fill that need, as long as it was well cared for previously? 

Third, which models/years should I be looking at to get the most reliable Subaru?

Rumor is that my grandfather's (mom's dad) family lived in the US, but returned to Poland just before WWII started. My grandfather joined the Polish Army, and later became head of a Displaced Persons camp in Germany. Story is, he used his available resources to try to find his family (brother and parents), and even went back to their house in Poland, only to find that the house had been destroyed (we're assuming bombed). 

Is there any way to find out if they were in fact killed during the war? Or if they survived? I do not have an Ancestry subscription (or any subscription), but I'm hoping to get one once I have a little more debt paid off.

On my mom's side, I'm Polish, and maybe Russian. As I understand it, my grandmother's family was from Poland, but she and her family lived in Russia for a while.

While in Russia, my great grandfather supposedly owned a car company (around 1913, I believe?). His surname would have been Palinska, unless he changed it or something. I figured, with how dedicated some people are to cars and transportation, I'd be able to find this company. I haven't found *anything*!

Rumor is, it was called Ursos (or something similar), or maybe just the Russian word for ""bear"" (медве́дь).

Also, as a side note/quick question: rumor is that this same man (great grandfather), or maybe my great-great grandfather (same side of the family) was a guard for the Russian Tsar, but was probably Polish.

I'm so glad I stumbled upon this sub today! Obviously, I'm new here, so please let me know if I leave out any information or if this belongs in a different sub! I apologize for the length of this post.

For starters, I'm a complete tomboy. I never learned how to properly style or even take care of my hair. I just sort of wash it and get on with my life, getting it cut every few months when it really starts to bother me. And even then, it's just a trip to Great Clips for a $10 haircut. I dye it once in a while, but I do it on my own with boxed dye. I have all kinds of different products, but have no idea what I'm doing.

I have had short hair for a few years now and don't see myself going back to a longer length. However, my face shape seems to not work well with short hair, and even my stylists seem a little hesitant to keep cutting it so short. But, since I know pretty much nothing, I don't know how to have that conversation or what I should be doing.

So, without further ado, [here is my general face shape and evidence of my complete lack of style](http://imgur.com/a/Edb2d). 

I don't have any particular styles in mind, so I'm open to any suggestions. I tend to gravitate towards really edgy cuts. I also like Anne Hathaway, Emma Watson, and Ginnifer Goodwin's short hair styles, but I don't know if I can pull those off.

I also prefer something that's low maintenance or simple to style. Doesn't matter how short it is, the shorter the better, but I'd be incredibly grateful for any tips on how to explain it during my next haircut.

My hair is thick and isn't styled easily. Currently, I'm using Style Sexy Hair Slept In, which is okay.

And while it may seem like a small feat, this is a monumental accomplishment for my stubborn dog. And sorry for the length. I'm pretty excited about this achievement. 

I have a 4 year old GSP who is what I like to call a ""failed hunter."" He began gundog training at some point early in his life, but washed out somewhere along the way. We adopted him from the humane society when he was 2 years old and he was quite a character. He was selectively food motivated (we've *mostly* figured him out), rarely toy/play motivated, and entirely too focused on birds when outside. So much so that it took *at least* a year to get a sit out of him even 10% of the time when outside.

Now, considering we barely got him to sit outside, it's no exaggeration to say his recall was *terrible*. Recall was one of the most important behaviors for us, and it just wasn't happening, even two years later.

A year ago we moved into my mother's house and while her yard is fenced, it is only 3.5' tall and lower in some spots because it's old and starting to fall over. It didn't take long at all for him to figure out he can get over the fence to chase birds near the pond. He clears it effortlessly.

This led us to have to double up on our recall training, led to the discovery that he absolutely panics if tied up, even with us standing right there, and required us to have to monitor his time outside closely and coordinate bathroom breaks with times when birds weren't around, when it wasn't storming, and when there was no chance of fireworks (which is much more difficult than it sounds in our neighborhood).

So, I decided to try something. I stole some tactics for different things I had read online. Here's what I did.

-High value treats every single time we were going outside. Every. Single. Time. This meant a lot of hot dogs, different cheeses, and high quality puppy/cat food (Orijen was great for this).

-The high value treats didn't come only when I've called him to me. They occurred during the entire process of going outside. From the second he's let out of my ""room"" (my ""room"" is pretty much the living room, and I had to block off both entrances because he was learning to stick around the front door and wait for someone to open it so he could bolt) he was put into a loose heel, rewarded every few steps with those high value treats. Sort of a ""Hey, this is what I have for you, so pay attention"" exercise.

-Sit and wait to go out the door. This was doubly important because we had a senior greyhound he knocked over a lot, and small dogs he tends to trample. Treats for the sit and the wait. Pretty much treats for everything good he does.

-Treats every single time he returned to me, whether or not I called him. At first this caused a minor issue because he recognized that I was a giant hot dog dispenser, so he would come back to me and never pee. He eventually got over that idea when I gave him a couple of extra treats for returning after peeing.

-Doggy party whenever he returned with the recall command. Frequent recalls and then releases.

-If he didn't listen, I calmly got him, gently grabbed him by the collar, and brought him inside. If he didn't listen, his time outside ended. 

This whole ordeal occurs every single time he goes in the yard. He still has moments where I absolutely cannot trust him not to blow me off and chase a bird over the fence. There are also times where he makes a mad dash and nearly escapes.

HOWEVER, the silver lining is, now I can actually sit down (I previously had to stand and wait in case I had to run after him) and when he's done doing his doggy things, he'll calmly sit next to me on the patio and watch birds from that spot.

I absolutely cannot trust him off leash, and I absolutely cannot leave him outside for longer than a few minutes, but it's reduced my anxiety a little and it's taught him that he *does* benefit from hanging around me.

The pulling is getting to the point where the entire seat and mechanism are twisting around, and my SO (who takes him biking) is getting quite frustrated.

Is there a better apparatus out there?

And do you think a harness that attaches at the side, like [this one](http://www.petexpertise.com/dog-collars-dog-harnesses/urban-trail-custom-fleece-dog-harness.html) (with the optional biking ring) would be better?

I've just always wondered how I would approach the issue, and figured it's better to know too early than too late.

My dog has never been boarded. We never go anywhere. But I would be surprised if at some point during his lifetime he will never need to be boarded.

He is a very anxious dog, and panics if we simply visit someone else's house. He does okay at daycare, but I'm told sometimes it takes him a while to settle in (he hasn't been to daycare in over a year because we've since moved and never found a good one in our area).

He absolutely cannot be left with a sitter or family member. He wouldn't hesitate to jump a fence, break out of his crate, or destroy everything he sees if he's left in a home.

So that brings us to boarding. How would I make the stay the easiest for him?

Do I use a boarding facility that integrates the dogs into their daycare during the day (preferred)? Or do I board at a vet where he'll be in a concrete dog run 23 hours of the day (where they have anxiety meds)?

How do I deal with him when he gets home?

And what sorts of things should I ask a facility? Obviously I avoid any place using positive punishment/dominance theory like the plague, but they're far too common in my area.

It's probably entirely my fault because I don't have the most stellar attention span during seasons 8 and 9 (I don't feel like I've missed *that* much, either), but I'm not entirely sure what's going on during this arc.

Sometimes it seems like they're hinting that Mulder isn't the father, then Anderson confirms that he was conceived during ""all things."" Then there's alien stuff, then religious stuff, some people want William dead, some want Mulder dead, some want both dead, and some want both to live.

So what am I missing?",XFiles,(Spoilers) ELI5: William story arc,http://www.reddit.com/r/XFiles/comments/3arb8x/spoilers_eli5_william_story_arc/
