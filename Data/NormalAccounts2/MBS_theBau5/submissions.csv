I mean I knew from reading on here that it was painfully one-sided, but holy shit. I honestly don't even know where to begin so I wont even touch on it; some of you have already posted reviews about the movie that more than cover what I was going to say. However, I was talking to my mom about it at the end (shes in serious denial about me telling her I'm not a christian anymore) and telling her how I was expecting there to be reasonable debate, and the whole movie is just designed to paint atheists as jerks, and play off of emotions of christians. It basically came down to her saying ""I wish you weren't so irrational and close-minded about the movie."" You may need to read that last sentence to let it sink in. I just watched a heavy pro-christian movie with obvious bias, and she thinks I'm close-minded because I didnt let pseudo-science play off my emotions. YOU THINK AN ALL KNOWING INVISIBLE DEITY CREATED THE UNIVERSE EVEN THOUGH NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN HIM. And I'M the one being irrational.
