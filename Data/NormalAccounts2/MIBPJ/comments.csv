If you see interviews with him he kind of jokes about the hold out and seems to really enjoy being a Charger.

Also worth noting that while Telesco might be on the extreme end of things, the league as a whole seems to agree that safety is a devalued position. Karl Joseph was the highest drafted safety since Mark Barron in 2011. Rarely are they taken in the first half of the first round and many years there are no safeties taken in the first round period.

In his time with the Colts they never grabbed a safety earlier than the 4th and in his final five years they didn't even draft a single safety period.

People act like you can take away a WR or TE and the team keeps chugging along whereas you take away a DT and the whole team falls apart.

Last year when Keenan Allen went down the Chargers also scored 8 points per game less. When the Bengals lost Geno Atkins for half the season they averaged 18.4 points allowed in games with him and 19.3 in games without him. Positional value should have told me that losing a top end DT should have had a much bigger effect than TE or WR but here thats not the case. I'm sure I can find a good example of losing a DT derailing and defense but Gronk and Allen seem to undermine the notion that they played low value positions.

108,"Here's the basic argument for why they should have done what they did:

Back in June when they closed the case Comey had a big press conference explaining this controversial decision and also making it clear that Clinton was not entirely blameless in this affair. The reason he felt compelled to make this press conference in the first place is that the Department of Justice had decided it to recuse itself from the decision of whether or not to make charges and instead follow the FBI recommendation. Its unusual for the FBI to be in this position and so they felt compelled to explain their decision to the public.

Weeks before the election they find evidence that gives them reason to reopen the case. Comey could have quietly reopened the case, but since he made such a big affair closing it in the first place that this would be viewed as sneaky (announcing when its closed but quietly reopening it). Instead he decided to let congress know that the case was reopened just like he told them when it was closed. Keep in mind, keeping it secret that the case was reopened also influences the results of the election. If Clinton had won and Republicans found out that the case had secretly been reopened days before the election they would be within their rights to be upset and that the FBI was acting politically. 

So basically Comey was stuck between a rock and a hard place. He took what was basically the most politically neutral and transparent approach he could and due to circumstances and timing he couldn't help that his course of action would have some level of impact on the election.",2016-11-12 19:06:11+00:00,d9xghfc,1.0,t3_5cln50,2804.0,changemyview

So let me get this straight: 

The defense held the Broncos to the fewest points they have scored all season and much of last season. That score would be lower had ST not turned the ball over in FG range. They forced two turn overs. They caused a safety. They sacked Siemian twice and gave him his worst yards per attempt of his career. 

Meanwhile the special teams muffed a punt in FG range, muffed another punt after the safety, and failed to recover an onside kick. The offense only put up 265, turned the ball over twice, and scored 6 points in the second half.

Lets not also forget that Wiggins muffed the punt after the safety and that only reason that Siemian (who had the lowest yards per attempt of his career that evening) had a shot at tying it up was because special teams failed to recover an onside kick.

I would say that the McCoyBall point does have some legitimacy but I feel like the criticism varies too week-to-week. 

&gt;Chiefs loss: Why didn't he just give it to Gordon and let him grind down the clock?!

&gt;Broncos near win: Why did he keep giving it Gordon when it was clear that he wasn't getting it done?! (BTW, Gordon had a better yards per carry in the second half against the Broncos than the second half of the Chiefs)

&gt;Broncos loss: Why didn't he keep giving it to Gordon?! He was killing them on the ground.

&gt;Titans win: Why did he keep giving it to Gordon?! Put the ball in the hands of Rivers and let him close out the game.

You can criticize McCoy on a game-by-game basis but when you try stringing it together into a season long narrative of what is going wrong it kind of falls apart.

199,"MVP - Rivers

Offensive Player of the Year (not named Philip Rivers) - Gordon.

Defensive Player of the Year - Bosa

Rookie of the Year - Bosa

Breakout Player - Gordon. Going from 0 TDs to leading the league is about as breakout as you can go.

Most Underrated Charger - Palepoi or Toomer. Both are quietly playing very well.

Best Position Unit - Crazy to say but probably linebackers or d-line. I'll go with linebackers because I think the depth is pretty good.

Best Offseason Free Agent Signing - Mebane. You could make the case for Slauson but he kind of fell into our lap so I think of it less of a smart signing and more of luck

LVP - Kaser. He's definitely redeemed himself and I hold no grudge or anything, but you could make the case that he's cost the team two games (against divisional opponents nonetheless). Can't say that about anyone else on the team.

Most Overrated Charger - Liuget. I've been thinking this for a while. Everyone has said ""He's a monster. Just wait until you see him with talent around him"". Now he's got talent around him and he looks to be the least talented among them.

Most Impactful Injury - Keenan Allen

Worst Position Unit - Safeties.

Most Heartbreaking Loss - Chiefs. Biggest giveaway. Divisional game. Season opener.

448,"I see your point by but disagree with it. The instantaneous peak distance between expected outcome and eventual outcome seems to be a better measure of the unlikliehood of an outcome than choosing arbitrary time point. 

Thought experiment:

Game #1: Team A runs up the score huge in the first quarter (lets say 20-0) by the end of the 1st quarter. They then proceed to sit on that lead. By half time its 20-14. By the start of the third quarter its 20-17. By the 2 minute warning they're now losing. They eventually lose the game 24-20.

Game #2: Teams battles it out so that its tied at half 14-14. Team A has a few quick scores is up 31-14 at the start of the third. Team B suddenly starts coming back. Ties up the game as regulation expires and comes back to win in overtime.

What single time point captures how unlikely it was that team A lost both of those games. If you chose half time then you would have no sense that team A made their loss in game 2 highly inprobable. If you chose the final two minute warning you would have no sense that either games was anything but neck and neck the whole time.

451,"Ok now I'm seeing your point with those edits. I apologize because going back and rereading the conversation I realized that I might have been clear on everything. I do think that win if a team *peaks* at 75% then it overestimates it because peaking at 75% means that you never made it to 100% which means you lost which means it overestimates it as you said. 

Where I think I disagree with you, and agree with the article, is that I feel measuring peak win probability *in a loss* is a 100% accurate way of measuring how improbable the loss is (and by its converse how improbable a win is for the other team). I think that as it pertains to peaks in the article that my interpretation is correct but I agree with your point that if you peak at 75% then yes will not win the game. I was responding to your point that ""taking the peak over the entire game is a flawed way to do things"", which I still disagree with.  ",2016-10-11 06:11:38+00:00,d8n0d7s,13.0,t1_d8mznhj,1581.0,nfl
452,"Here's the thing: you're correct in that one team will end the game with a probability of 1.0 and the other team with 0.0, but the route which they get there is non-trivial. In the Browns-Patriots game the odds that the Browns would win (the opposite of what actually happened) were very low through out so the largest difference between the probability and the final win probability was very low for both teams. That game could have been predicted with very high likelihood.

In the Chargers case the within-game win probability and the final win probability were very distal in all of their losses (well not so much with Raiders loss). Their routes to a 0.0 win probability was very atypical and you can attempt to quantify the sum total of ""atypicalness"" multiplying the probability of games together but I don't think its wholly inaccurate. Low probability odds multiplied over a huge number of iterations yields reasonably probable events.

Its a probability based on historical data that include whether a team is home or away, the down and distance, score difference, time remaining, and field position. No one is claiming it represents the true and unknowable win probability. Is there any outcome that you can truly be predicted.

b) Thats not even a critique. Browns didn't have a 50% win probability at the outset of the Patriots game because the 32nd ranked team does not beat the 1st ranked team 50% of the time.

c) No. You're doing a thought experiment on a single game. If you look at all the teams that have had a 50% win probability at some point in the game what percentage of them go on to win the game? Probably 50%. Beyond that your thought experiment isn't even internally consistent. If one team has a 50% win probability then the other team has a 50% win probability as well.

Not much to say about the safety group. They're probably the weak point of the defense if not the whole team. We just let All-Pro safety Eric Weddle go and haven't really replaced him. We went into the season with UDF Jaleel Addae and recent acquisition from the Colts Dwight Lowery. No one was too excited. Addae just fractured his collarbone and his shoes are about to be filled by Dexter McCoil a player from the CFL who received a lot of offseason and pre-season hype.

Too lazy to write up the linebackers and d-line. A lot of exciting stuff there which I'm sure someone else will fill you in on. The long and the short is that last year our front seven was one of the worst in the NFL. The D-line has been completely revamped and that doesn't even count the addition of 3rd overall pick Joey Bosa. The starting linebacker crew hasn't really changed but has solid depth with at least one rookie, Jatavis Brown, pushing for a starting role.",2016-09-23 17:04:48+00:00,d7z2t40,1.0,t3_545lsw,1744.0,Chargers

They replaced Trevor Robinson, who PFF ranked as the worst lineman in the entire league, with Matt Slauson, who PFF ranked as the 6th best guard in the entire league. Slauson was cut by the Bears for almost no apparent reason (a fact that Bears fans are still salty about) and signed below market value by the Chargers. So far that has made a huge difference. Football Outsiders currently ranks the line as the 4th best in the league based on performance in the 2016 season. On paper this line should be good but I think most fans would have been happy with just and average or maybe even below average line, so to have it perform so well is a very pleasant surprise.",2016-09-23 16:53:12+00:00,d7z29c1,1.0,t3_545lsw,1048.0,Chargers

On a related note, I think that this early in the season the passing leader is just going to be a function of which QB has gotten to play the bad defenses. Rivers is currently ranked 2nd and he gets the luxury of playing the 30th, 31st, and 32nd ranked defenses and the Saints (currently ranked 23rd) in the next five weeks so I'm betting he takes the passing leader title by midseason.

Melvin Ingram (outside linebacker) also quietly a very good season racking up 10.5 sacks. We also had a couple free agency acquisitions who hopefully can make an impact. Those are Brandon Mebane who reportedly has looked really good at nose tackle and was chosen as team captain. The other is Casey Hayward who was a very solid nickel corner for the Packers.

The safety position looks weak. Lowery and Addae just don't seem like starter material. They seem to make the corners' lives a little harder.

Run defense looked pretty bad. Having said that, I know that Bosa (obviously) was not there and Mebane was not in on a lot of the plays were they got really gashed so I'm not sure how warranted this concern is.

Splash plays notwithstanding, I'm not sure if Flowers is back. He gave up some big completions in that Arizona game. 

The scheming seemed a bit off. That big Diggs play in the Vikings game was due in part to him being covered by linebackers. 

Having said all of this, there were few plays were the first team defense was on the field (well none really because Bosa is part of that first team) and when they were on the field they seemed to at worst bend not break.

2) He didn't outright say ""none of the first overalls got offsets and deferrals"" but he did say that in so many words when he insisted that Clowney, Fisher, and Winston got one or the other.

&gt;Look at it this way, if you're the Chargers GM, do you dig in your heels? Or do you compromise and give him one of the two, knowing the consequences?

To be honest, I would have given him the shit back in May and been done with it. Its dumb they didn't. They could have given him those perks and told anyone down the road that those are reserved for top 5 picks. But now its gotten trickier as the standoff goes on. At this point if they give in then they show that they give in to standoffs. 

Look at it this way, you run the Chargers and you have this rookie who wants to disrupt to your ability to bargain with players because he wants a minutely better contract. You think this rookie will make a huge impact but in order to even get him on the field he's forcing you (and in another sense you forced him to force you) to cave to a hold out. Okay, maybe its no biggie maybe it changes nothing and other players view it as you granting an exception. But maybe not?

1034,"Thats where I disagree with you. Its not virtually all as there have been a number of high picks that had both offsets and bonus deferral. While the point about 3rd overall pick is true, it should also be true of 1st and 2nd for it to be a valid argument. Instead, this is the first year that 1st overall DIDN'T get a deal that included both offsets and bonus deferrals. So Bosa's initial contract offer was very similar to that signed by Eric Fisher, Jadaveon Clowney, and Jameis Winston and his new offer is better than all of theirs. 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th overall have signed contracts like this but it just so happens that 3rd overall hasn't (in part this is due to the Jags repeatedly picking at 3. They and the Rams are unusually generous with first round rookie contracts). So no, I don't think the market makes the Chargers contract stand out in a meaningful way. They fall in a minority of teams that don't offer ""added perks"" but its not a tiny minority and includes at least the Chiefs, Texans, Cowboys, and Bucs. 

Lets say, however, this contract is unusually bad (which again I disagree with). What then? Well what the Chargers doing is complying exactly with the CBA and offering the contract negotiated with NFLPA. They're not failing to do things that they're compelled to do, they're just not going above and beyond like some teams over the last 4 years have elected to do. The removal offset language and bonus deferrals is optional and they're choosing exercise that right to not include those perks. If the inclusion of one of this perks was intended to be compulsory for top picks then the NFLPA should have fought to include it in the CBA.",2016-08-28 08:27:07+00:00,d6zrlgk,4.0,t1_d6zr98y,1179.0,AroundTheNFL

Lastly even if those two were accurately stated it still wouldn't be true because you are wrongly indicating that Bosa's offer is unique. Not every first rounder gets one or the other.

During the season he had statistically the worst season of his career and there were a number of plays where it was clear he wasn't playing at 100% effort. Then went to the press again called out specific players for slacking off. Then there was the halftime performance in which a number of Charger's players kids performed in the halftime show.

1147,"First, I get that 60-40 is worse. I just don't see how it's categorically worse. Second, to me neither of those reasons seems very valid. The whole ""RBs are devalued"" argument doesn't make sense. First off, draft position tells you how much they value the positition. If RBs weren't valuable then he wouldn't have been picked at the top of the draft. That would be like the Chargers justifying their actions by saying he's a 3-4 DE and is inherently less valuable than a a 4-3 DE like Folwer picked at 3. If anything RBs should get better deals since they take a bigger pounding and have shorter careers. Again though I don't think the position being played should affect pay since draft position inherently tells you value.

The second reason also seems kind of weak. Elliott is lucky to be playing in state without income tax. Bosa has to pay income tax now. From a tax perspective 60-40 and 65-35 are still very similar.

1) Bosa cannot meet with or work out for teams. You could argue that these aren't important but if they weren't teams wouldn't do it. You could argue he met with teams this past cycle but who know if those will be the same teams that pick at the top of the cycle this go around.

2) He won't be able to participate in the combine. Again, you could say he did so last season but its not unheard of for players to get out of shape due to lack of training or injured due to training. Having said that, I think he can participate in pro days so this might no be huge.

With the offset language its the amount of money that a team would pay to a first round pick that was so bad that he got cut by his team (or $0 if he doesn't get cut).

So if Bosa is guaranteed $4 million by the Chargers and the second team offers him $100k. Then exclusion of offset language only bumps him up $100k vs the offset language contract ($4.1 million vs $4 million). The bigger the second contract the more he stands to gain from exclusion of offset language. Thats part of what makes Bosa's insistence on it strange. Its really only going to pay big dividends for him in the unlikely even that he gets cut and then gets a big contract from the second team. Why would that team pay big money if he got cut?

&gt; No, the offset language is better for the teams, and I cannot understand why any other front office waives it.

Yeah definitely. Its really not very manner other teams that do it though. The Rams and Jags were the only teams to do it this year.

Thats true but the difference is kind of trivial. Bosa wants all of his singing bonus ($17 million) by December. Chargers want to give half in December half in March.

Even if that money was very well invested that is like $200k difference (less than 1% of the total contract value).

The article does point the finger at them is but here's the other finger being pointed: 

&gt;That's why Bosa should point the finger of blame at his fellow players as well as at Chargers management. On multiple occasions the NFL Players Association has ""strongly discouraged"" agents from agreeing to contracts that include offset language, particularly in rookie deals, but each year the number of deals featuring that (and deferred money) increases.

&gt;For instance, none of the 12 players selected with the second, third or fourth picks in the 2012-15 drafts agreed to deals that included offsets and deferments. However, this year, the picks immediately before and after Bosa -- Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz at No. 2, and running back Ezekiel Elliott at No. 4 -- signed deals with both provisions. Not surprisingly, the Chargers are arguing that Bosa's contract should feature that same framework.

&gt;There is nothing in the CBA that says a player must agree to offsets or deferments, yet players are willingly doing such deals. Each time they do, it's more leverage and a bigger hammer for teams to swing in negotiations.

They were both first round picks that never made it to their second contracts.

What constitutes that 3% is **salary bonus deferral** (do you get your signing bonus now, or do you get most of it now and the rest in March) and **offset language** (if the Chargers cut Bosa and owe him $4 million and the Cowboys pick him up for $2 million, do the Chargers owe him $4 million or does they now only owe him the $2 million to bring it up to $4 million). Bosa wants all his bonus money up front **OR** no offset language (i.e. in the scenario laid out above he would get $4 million plus $2 million). Chargers want to give him neither. 

Both sides have their arguments. Bosa's camp is pointing out that 80% of players picked in the top 5 get one of those perks, some players get both, and every player picked at the three position has gotten one or the other. The Chargers point out that 20% neither (including players picked at even higher than three) and that he'll get the standard contract laid out and negotiated in the collective bargaining agreement. 

In the end I think both sides are stupid because this is getting dragged out for such small amounts of money. Another redditor did the math and this could potentially be a fight over what amounts to $50,000-100,000 on a $25 million contract (i.e. 0.2-0.4% of the total contract).

1508,"Just to be clear, I'm on Bosa side (or at least I'm against what Chargers are doing) buuuuuut its not as black and white as that. Basically the Chargers guaranteeing he will get the full amount of his rookie contract no matter what. What the Chargers want is the inclusion of offset language which says that if he gets cut and some other team picks him up than the Chargers are only responsible for the difference in what that second team wants and what that they've garaunteed. So if for example if the Chargers garauntee $4 million in 2020 and he gets picked up by the Cowboys for $2 million then the Chargers now only owe him the $2 million to bring up his pay to $4 million. The criticism of this is that it seems like the team doesn't believe in the player and is hedging their bets in case the player busts. Bosa wants this language removed so that Chargers would still pay $4 million, the Cowboys would pay $2 million, so now he gets a total of $6 million. The criticism of this is that its a) seen as double dipping and b) it seems like the player doesn't believe in himself and is hedging his bets. For what its worth most players, rookie or veteran, have the offset language.

Where I think the Chargers are in the wrong is that Bosa is giving them an option to include the offset language and that is to pay his entire bonus by the end of 2016, but the Chargers are refusing to take this option. 80% of top 5 picks get either the removal of offset language or get their bonus money up front so its reasonable that Bosa should expect one of the two.",2016-08-04 23:27:22+00:00,d64n2h5,4.0,t1_d64lx4z,1674.0,nfl

Instead they directly attribute everything to adiposity. Here's the entire conclusion section:

&gt;In the global climate of an increasingly aged population, with rising levels of obesity, it is critical to establish the full health impact of an increased body mass. The results of our study suggest that increased adiposity has a significant impact on brain structure, that it modulates the relationship between white matter volume and age, and that such effects may be equivalent to an increased in brain-age of up to 10 years in overweight and obese individuals. These results support the hypothesis that adiposity confers a significant risk of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.

Criminal charges have the standard of being beyond reasonable doubt. Perhaps no charges are being brought because they don't think they can meet that standard in court even if there is some evidence that supports suggests he did in fact shoot himself. Not that that is necessarily true, but just throwing that out there as a possibility. As we've seen with the Brady case, the NFL's standard is much closer to a civil trial in that they can levy punishment if its ""more likely than not"" that they committed an offense.

As for your point about a moral argument, both sides are moral arguments. It's not that one side thinks their argument is immoral. The difference is absolute or relative moralism. You're taking an absolutist view which is that killing civilians is wrong no matter what and that therefore the dropping of the atomic bomb was amoral. The relativistic argument is that allowing the war to get prolonged and lead to an amount of deaths far exceeding that of the atomic bombs is less moral than quickly ending the war with a comparatively lower number of deaths. To my mind both have their valid events but the relativism clearly relies on a bit of a numbers game (which I personally buy).

B) You stated he's a ""6'4"" beheamoth"" but he's actually 6'2""

C) You stated in another post that you don't know much about Allen's rookie season which completely undermines your claim that he hasn't improved. How would you know?

D) Also in another post you stated that Allen has not improved over the past 4 years which is a bit surprising of a statement considering he's only played 3 years. 

E) You stated that Allen won't be top 15 in 20+ yard catches anytime in the next 5 years which is kind of a bold statement considering that in 2013, his rookie season, he was 1 catch outside the top 15 (he had 16. 17 would have made him top 15).

F) Similarly, your statement that he'll never be a top 10 receiver seems a bit bold considering he was top 7 in yards per game last season. If he stays healthy next season he very well could be a top 10 receiver.

A second big issue, and I would say more conceptual issue, is that now your basically picking and choosing who can and cannot vote based on the ideas that they hold. Thats dangerous. You can get into an Orwellian situation when you say the content of your head is what is going to decide whether you can or cannot vote. Who gets to decide who is sufficiently understanding of an issue so that they can vote? What if someone is well researched but comes to a conclusion that is far outside what the ""voter decider"" considers a valid stance? What if someone has such a black and white stance on something they don't feel it necessary to learn the details and nuances on the other side? 

Related to that last point, here's real life example of ""uninformed voting"" that happens in America that I want your opinion on: There are those in America that flat out do not want guns in America. If there is a proposed law to limit the size of ammo clips they would vote for that. If there is a law proposed semi-automatics they would vote for that. There was a recently proposed law that aimed to ban guns that fit a certain set of criteria including, among other things, having something called a barrel shroud. Now if I'm anti-gun I don't feel I need to look up what a barrel shroud is because I'm anti-gun and it doesn't matter what a barrel shroud is because its part of a gun and I don't want anyone to have any guns, period. There was, however, a news clip where Fox News embarrassed a proponent of this law by showing that she did not in fact know what a barrel shroud is despite want to ban guns that contain them. More generally, guns rights proponents use opposing side's the lack of knowledge about guns to try nullifying their position. Is this valid or is it sometimes okay to be uninformed on an issue?

That means if you got the same shitty team playing the same schedule you would expect 6 wins. The easier schedule this year could buy one extra win.

It it only kind of does. Departments might err on giving A's because if a student takes a class outside the department and ends up with a C (something the the student's home department might not be able to do) the GPA could fall below 3.0.

Also some students might apply for individual fellowships and sometimes you have to enter your grades (NRSA fellowships being an example). It behooves the department to give better grades so that they are more likely to get fellowships.

I guess each program is different but I don't know of any student in my class that ever got a C.

1682,"First, I actually screwed things up a little mentally because the Bengals game he actually did go for two (trying to make up for a missed Lambo PAT). The Lions game was the (only?) one with egregious, in my opinion, decision to not go for two. 

Second, I can understand that rationale you laid out if it was early in the game but it wasn't. It was with three mins left in the third and instead of tying it up 21-21 he settled for 21-20. You might not get another chance to tie it up so easily. Think about the mental calculation, or lack thereof, that went into that decision. If they go for two and miss. Pat makes it a one point game, successful two point conversion makes it a zero point game, unsuccessful its two points. Now imagine the different scenarios from there:

Lions score a field goal-&gt; In the one and two point games you're going to need a TD not lose whereas in the zero point game you could have tied it. So a PAT and a failed conversion are just as bad as each other and not as good as a successful 2-point conversion.

Lions score a TD -&gt; The failed 2 point conversion allows the Lions to put it out of reach with a TD, but it just delayed the inevitable which is that you need a 2-point conversion at some point. At least trying earlier lets you know where you stand.

Lions don't score-&gt; Now you have to make it all the way downfield and get with scoring range to take the lead. That was true whether it was a PAT or an unsuccessful 2 point conversion.

When McCoy chose to sit there like a flaccid penis and let the Bengals run down the clock rather than use a time out and hand the ball to the offense and thereby risk something bad happening

Yeah, the TE pick was a little bit of a headscratcher at the time, but the way the Chargers use the TE position you needed someone there in addition to Gates. Not did Gates say he's expecting to play a limited role this year, but you also want the next tight end to learn under him while he's still around.

Its hard to say how much the Ohio State hype fed into his decision to get another player from that school. ILB was a position of need after letting Butler (not that he was an asset) and Law walk and Perry was arguably the best player available at that position.

He should be solid depth and he'll have the chance to compete for a starting position, although I'm skeptical that he can beat out any of the starters.

Chargers o-line sucks but thats mostly because of the interior and not the tackles (and we have a pretty competent swing tackle as depth). If we got a tackle he would have likely red shirt him. Add to that the Chargers have an offense that can move the ball even without an elite left tackle because the scheme relies on getting the ball off quick. So Chargers fans didn't want the 1st round pick spent on a tackle.

Second, IF they were to get a tackle then people thought it should be Tunsil. Nearly every scout had him as the top tackle of the draft. Of course, that was before the tweets that caused him to become the third tackle taken.

Yes, the man who is currently our OC.

I just don't see why you would prioritize the offense when the defense is worse. The offense can't run but can throw. The defense can't stop the pass or run. You can choose how you're going to attack the other teams offense. You don't get to choose how the other team is going to attack your defense. There's reason to think that new coaching can revamp the offense. There's no such reason to think that with the defense. ",2016-04-28 21:08:59+00:00,d2l7q2e,4.0,t1_d2l78ro,653.0,Chargers
1827,"&gt;The Chargers had the #30th ranked rushing attack in 2014 and they had the #31 ranked rushing game in 2015. The left tackle for both seasons was King Dunlap.

And the year before Chargers had the Dunlap playing left tackle and they had the #12 rushing attack and #3 offense overall. The difference? A we changed to a shitty predictable offensive coordinator AND we've had a revolving door in the interior. Robinson was rated the worst offensive lineman in the league. Franklin missed most of his games and Fluker missed a number of them as well. Going into the season Franklin was rated as the best lineman on the team and his biggest flaw was missing game time. Fortunately Hairston seemed to fill in pretty well.

Moreover, this team seems to thrive on passing the ball. In 2014 they had the 30th rushing attack yet were the 10th best offense overall. That's because they had the 7th best passing attack and most yards come from passing. As bad as the offensive line is, this is not a horrible offense. 

You also can't talk about how bad the offense was at running the ball without talking about how bad the defense was at stopping the run (or the pass). Last season they had the 25th ranked defense overall, the 22nd worst passing defense, and the **32nd** run defense. Teams can run all over the Chargers. 

The last time the defense outranked the offense was 2012 and that mast mostly because the offense stunk rather than the defense getting better. This team needs to step up the defense. ",2016-04-28 20:40:38+00:00,d2l6geb,2.0,t1_d2l59to,1553.0,Chargers

He said that if you get Deforest Buckner you can come back in the second round and get this one offensive tackle (don't remember his name) and sit him for a year and then get a corner in the third. Those both seem like horrible ideas. You don't get a 2nd rounder that your planning on sitting for a year and tackle is arguably not a position of need. And corner is pretty set and is maybe even a bit crowded talent with Verrett, Hayward, Flowers, Mager, and Williams. In my opinion thats one of the best corner groups in the league. Not a position of need either. 

Even his opinion on Buckner seemed a bit weak. I think everyone here believes that he is probably the best d-line prospect and that d-line is a position of need. The argument against him, which Miller didn't address, is that he's not all that much better than the 2nd, or 3rd, or 7th best d-lineman whereas Ramsey or Tunsil are so much better than the next best guy at their position.

When asked how much they smoke those users estimated 79.2+/-72.7 which is, as other have pointed out, an absurd amount and probably a huge overestimate.

Edit: They didn't actually ask them how much they smoke (in terms of weight). Here's how that number was derived. They had the user estimate how many times a day they smoke and how many days a month they smoked. Multiply those together and you have the number of times per month they smoked. Then they had that user weigh out an amount of basil they thought was comparable to the average bowl/joint they smoked. They took that weight and multiplied it by the amount of times per month and now you have a weight per month. Its wildly inaccurate but doesn't really undermine the results since this weight did not figure into any inclusion criteria.

I feel like 1st round has to be a defensive player then and the first four picks should be D-line, safety, center and TE in no particular order.

""Bringing in Tunsil to shore up the offensive linemen sounds like a good idea when you say it in a general sense, but makes sense less when you dive into the details. Currently Chargers have three tackles on the roster: King Dunlap (LT), Joe Barksdale (RT) and Chris Hairston (backup swing tackle). Barksdale was a solid starter who played all 16 games and Hairston is a competent backup. The biggest issue is Dunlap who was rated the best member of the O-line going into the season but couldn't manage to stay on the field. So you would really just bring in Tunsil to replace Dunlap who is on contract and who is competent when healthy. That might be a decent move in the long term but its not the sort of win-now move you do when you have a good QB in his last few years.

It also doesn't fix the bigger problems in the interior. The biggest problem is center. A few games into our season the center, Chris Watt, was IRed and replaced by the even worse Trevor Robinson who was ranked by PFF as the worst offensive lineman in the entire league. Both guards, Orlando Franklin and DJ Fluker, a missed a ton of time due to injury even (6 and 4 games, respectively) even though both had only missed 1 game in their entire careers until the 2015 season.

To me the best move(s) the Chargers could do to fix the O-line would not be to get Tunsil, but instead to get a starting center and find get decent depth at guard.""",2016-03-28 17:48:34+00:00,d1gkwc1,2.0,t1_d1gk4k9,1026.0,nfl

It just adds fuel to reputation of the Chargers as a team that doesn't take care of its veterans and that probably scares of a FA or two.

1993,"Chargers fan here. His play did drop off a bit last season, but the defense as a whole was playing pretty poorly. I think most of it was the fault of the front seven. They just couldn't stop the run and a few of the times that Weddle got really badly burned this season was because the front seven screwed up and he had to try catching an RB in the open field. Teams knew that the Chargers couldn't stop the run and consequently ran the ball a lot (Chargers defense experienced the third fewest pass plays in the league). Less passes by the offense means less interceptions by the defense. 

The front seven started to click towards the end of the season when they benched (and have since cut) our ILB Donald Butler and replaced him with the rookie Denzel Perryman. He was ranked by PFF as the best rookie ILB by far and the second best run stuffer in the league at any position, rookie or not, just behind Mohammed Wilkerson. Things vastly improved but at that point Weddle was out with a groin injury so we never really got to see him playing with a solid defense last year. 

A lot of people will tell you he sucked, or that he was saving his body for his next team, or whatever. I don't think its true. I think he just got stuck playing along side a pretty bad defense in a season that quickly became apparent was a lost one. ",2016-03-15 02:27:10+00:00,d105x0f,2.0,t1_d0zqda7,23136.0,ravens

2013,"Redskins were the consensus worst team in the league going into last season and a lot people had the Colts, Ravens, or Eagles going to the superbowl. Its hard enough to tell where things are at even right before the season starts let alone before free agency, the draft, training camp, and pre-season. 

In addition to these general things about how hard it is to predict performance there are a few things that ought to make one optimistic. First, is that the Chargers weren't as bad as their record. I know everyone is going to say that about their team, but one good metric for validating that is to look at the teams actual record and their pythagorean expected wins (how many wins you would expect given points scored and points allowed). You would have expected six wins for the Chargers and the amount by which they undershot this, 2, is the biggest in the NFL. In other words, no team outplayed their record more than the Chargers. Second, I'm actually pretty excited for Whisenhunt coming back. I had forgotten how good the offense was in 2013. According to football outsiders, it was the #2 offense in the league (behind the historically good 2013 Broncos offense). Unfortunately the defense was #32 and dragged the team down. If Whisenhunt can put together something remotely similar and Pagano can do a halfway decent shot this team could be pretty good. Also, and this relates to the previous point, the run game could not have get any worse than it was this year. It can really only get better. I also think the high draft pick is something to get excited. If we add Jalen Ramsey or DeForrest Buckner to the roster we could have a real play maker on defense.

First, probably personality. Bill seems like someone you'd want to have a beer with, Hilary does not. Not very valid, but I think it feeds into it. Second, Bill oversaw the prosperous Clinton era whereas Hilary's major political career has been during the disasterous invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan (which she helped authorize, and continued bellicose rhetoric in regards to Libya and Syria) as well as the financial crash (although the seeds were sowed by Bill much earlier, she hasn't done much to distance her self from the financial sector that caused this). Its a political era that most would have rather seen not happen and she, rightfully so, is part of the face of it. And finally, the massive influx of cash the Clintons have seen have occurred after Bill's official political career, but during Hilary's continued career. If money is making Bill impartial, so what? He's only selling his personality and unofficial influence. If money is making Hilary impartial thats a big deal.

There has been lots of pharmacologically based studies but few (to my knowledge) using some of the more cutting edge technologies such as virus, transgenics. I actually met Larry a few years back and he said they were working on a transgenic vole. Has this happened? Any plans to use CRISPR? Where do you see the field 10 years from now?

2) Do you think that as you discover more about the complex social and emotional world of voles (pair bonding, grieving, and now consoling) that it makes the ethics of using them as a model system more complicated? Do you as a researcher have any qualms about the kind of research you do? Not intending that as a loaded question.

Scaryberry is also forgetting how fucking expensive it would be for Spanos to move. Yeah the stadium is essentially free but it would cost $550M to move there plus he wouldn't be full partner (and he would relinquish that $100M). 

The NFL also clearly wants the Chargers (and the Raiders, but they'll probably move) to stay put. They not only are giving them money to stay put but also chose the stadium option which puts a team in LA while at the same time giving the Chargers and Raiders the ability to threaten to move to LA.

Its also nice because its shape makes it really easy to plan a trip (go north to south or south to north). Hanoi was my favorite city but there are a lot of other really cool places around. There are two overnight trips from Hanoi that are must-do's. One is to take a train up in the the highlands to visit Sapa. Its this very idyllic region with terraced rice paddies, hiking and indigenous people. The other day trip from Hanoi is to Ha Long Bay which is this really serene bay with this very cool rocks jutting out of the water. Check out the pics of these two places, you'll be sold.

My second favorite city is Hue. Its the old imperial capital and has a mausoleum tour where you get to see these really resting places of the old emperors. They were built centuries apart (I think) so each is quite different.

Another good spot is Hoi An. Its got a very cool old small town feel and is a Unesco heritage site. Another cool spot is Ninh Binh. Its sometimes called inland Ha Long Bay and has the same very cool rock formations. 

Places that I wasn't so hot on: Saigon/HCMC. Big bustling dirty city that didn't have the charm of Hanoi.

2104,"&gt;I simply can't convince myself that this is the only solution.
Have we truly exhausted all other methods of research that we had to take an approach such as this one?

There's the problem right there. No is suggesting this is the only solution, or even the best one. The research does not claim to bring about a new age of autism research that will do away older methods such as transgenic mice. 

I do research on another autism related gene so let me tell you how I see this research. The gene that they altered, MECP2, has been tightly linked to a form of autism called Rhett syndrome. Since this discovery there has been a TON of mouse research. A pubmed search shows 966,626 results for MECP2+mice. When I add the search term autism it goes down to 1,481 studies but that still a lot. Well what if everything we learned about MeCP2 in mice only is true in mice?  More generally, what if all the research into the molecular mechanisms of cognition only teaches us how it works in mice and using it to understand higher species is in vane? Wouldn't it be nice to get a thumbs up and show that when you manipulate a gene in a mouse you can expect it to result in a similar phenotype if you were to do that in an organism more closely related to humans?

I feel like this study fills that role. They show that indeed manipulating an autism gene in monkeys results in the phenotype similar to what is seen when you manipulate that gene in the same way in mice and both phenotypes are similar to natural mutations that occur in humans. This research will be an extremely useful citation and I feel validates our current models of autism more than it provides a new avenue for autism research

2108,"I agree. There is something categorically different between the 2015 Broncos and other successful teams this year and others. This year the Broncos have had 11 games that were decided by a touchdown or less. That is an NFL record. No other team has ever had that many games decided by that few points. 

Then you add to that the fact that no only did they play 11 very close games, but they ended up having 8 of those 11 games turned out to be wins. I know that close games are not coin flips (good teams know how to get wins out of close games) so we shouldn't necessarily expect 5-6 or 6-5 but 8-3 does seem unusually good. When we include the two playoff games they become 10-3 in close games. 

These facts together make them somewhat of an anomaly. Lots of wins, not lots of dominant wins. In fact, no other one seed has had such a low point differential (+59). Since the current playoff format was enacted only one other team (the 2003 Eagles with a point differential of +89) has had only a double digit point differential.

16.7% of lead roles are played by minorities.

0 / 40 nominations for minorities.

Obviously the nomination rate is not 0.00% (its just been that way for a while) but I can do some back of the envelope calculations to get a better idea of what that rate is. In total there has been 59 oscar nominations given to black people with the first being given in 1939. Over that 75 year there should have been ~1500 nominations so blacks are being given nominations at a rate of ~3.9% despite blacks making up about 16% of the population. So there has to be some level of bias going either in casting or nominations to get to that level of skew.
 
Lets ask whether there is discrimination going from leading role to nomination. I can't find a list of all minority nominations but I can easily check the last 5 years. During that period there were 50 nominations for leading roles and since leading roles go to minorities at a rate of ~16% there should about 8 minority actors nominated but the actual number is just half that (4).

""I actually think [Spanis wants to stay in SD]. He's been given offers from San Diego to help pay for a stadium but all have been inadequate for him this to actually get done. Over the past few years all this LA talk has heated up and he sees an opportunity. If he can act like he's really serious about moving to LA and really wants to preserve what fanbase exists in LA he can: a) use that to scare SD into ponying up the money that money he wants for a new stadium, and b) sue the NFL for loss of his LA market share whenever a team does move in.

Could be but in my opinion that is a separate issue from whether it was also contaminated with Halbach's DNA. The routes of contamination just seem to be two distinct enough that the logic just does not follow from one to the other especially since Halbach's DNA was not found in the negative control.

&gt;Furthermore, shouldn't these tests be anonymous - i.e. the testers are testing based on an ID/Number rather than knowing specific names and communicating directly with the prosecutor and investigating detective?

They should be, but I believe that its pretty standard that its not done that way.

I'm going to go against the grain a bit here and say that I actually think that while I think the DNA scientist is a bit sloppy that I agree with her decision to override the protocol with common sense. A negative control is there to tell you what you should expect when no experimental sample should yield a positive result and in this case the negative control showed that even when no sample is added that there is a background level of DNA from the experimenter. Is that ideal? No. Should it prevent you from making any conclusions about the sample? I don't think so. I also think the nature of the contaminant calls for overriding protocol. Its not like it was an unknown person or DNA from another case or something like that. Its DNA from the person running the experiment and there's a plausible reason for why its there. I am curious though whether her DNA also showed up in the other samples or only the negative control.

In short, I think the DNA expert is a bad technician and a sloppy scientist, but I agree with her decision to override protocol.

2243,"Scientist here with a little bit of a different perspective at least on your first objection. 

The FBI guy and the analytical chemist could both be right depending on the circumstance. The FBI guy was saying that the blood could not be from the vial because the test came up **negative** for EDTA. The point the analytical chemist said boils down to being able to tell whether it was a **true negative** or a **false negative**. A true negative is that your tests showed an absence of something and it truly was absent (this is the FBI guy's interpretation of the results). A false negative is when the test shows a negative but its false and that compound is truly there (a possibility suggested by the analytical chemist and the defense). 

How can anyone distinguish these two? You do a positive control. By that I mean you test whether the test itself can detect EDTA at or below the concentration you would expect in the sample. So in this case you would test the RAV4 blood alongside blood that does contain EDTA (and it would be better if it is a gradient of EDTA concentrations that span the probable concentration expected in the blood sample). If the FBI's test did these positive controls and found that it could detect EDTA at all reasonable concentrations I would have no problem with him stating he felt fairly confident that EDTA was absent. If he did not then he has his head up his ass. Its unclear from the footage in the documentary whether these positive controls were done.

He also benefited (as did LT as a Charger) from having a fullback but the team doesn't have a true fullback. 

He also hasn't had the time/opportunity to build confidence. The team is typically playing from behind and has to abandon the run, so he doesn't get much experience.

Third, they did do proper controls. They did a secondary comparison of depressed mothers vs depressed mothers on antidepressants to try ruling out the confound of depression itself.

A) In general a student knows at the beginning of the course when the finals are. If he or she can see that they will have a unfavorable finals schedule then they could drop or add a class to make it more favorable.

B) Across students, schedules, and terms you would expect your issues to wash out and somewhat level the playing field. Even in your example in total the two students had the same number of easy, medium and hard tests. Even if they didn't you would expect that due to random chance across terms the two students would face similar numbers of favorable and unfavorable schedules. Across a tenure as an undergrad you would expect both students to get the GPA they earned.

C) To the extent that college is supposed to prepare you for the real world, one should not expect everything to be fair all the time.

They can't individualize the testing schedules to optimize it on a student by student basis. Do you have a suggestion to fix what you see as broken?

2348,"&gt;I know you love yards and touchdowns, but there is a reason turnovers are the biggest factor in winning.

I don't think you are not a fan. I just think you're take on him is at odds with reality. Turnovers are critical but River's is not exceptionally turnover prone. [Here are the career interception % leaders](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_int_perc_career.htm). You'll notice that he's got a better rate than a lot of good QBs (Brees, both Mannings, Luck, Romo, Newton, Dalton, Palmer). You would never look at this and say ""Wow he has a turnover problem"".

Just for comparison: Rivers, Manning and Eli all joined the league in 2004 but the Rivers didn't start until 2006. Rivers has 275 touchdowns and 130 interceptions. Rothlisberger has less TDs (266) and more interceptions (140). Eli has barely more TDs than Rivers (283) and waaaaaay more interceptions (195)

He hasn't really fucked the Chargers at all this year. If anything it becomes painful to imagine how bad they'd be without him. He's probably the only top 10 player in his position on the entire roster.

Even in the game on Sunday they only scored one offensive touchdown. They're just not sooo bad that they pull down their bad offense. As of last week the Chargers have the 12th best offense (according to DVOA) and the Broncos have 26th. The big difference between the teams is the play of the defense (1st vs 30th). In terms of the offensive improvements Broncos have made, the biggest change has not been getting rid of Manning's play calling duties but to get rid of Manning all together.

49When Jesus’ followers saw what was going to happen, they said, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?” 50And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.
51But Jesus answered, “No more of this!” And he touched the man’s ear and healed him.

&gt;Are you serious? Jesus himself basically endorsed a separation of church and state.

I am serious. Perhaps you didn't realize the seperation of church and state is not the same thing as being a pacifist. You can be for the separation of church and state and pro-violence, for the separation of church and state and pacifist, for the union of church and state and pacifist, and for the union of church and state and pro-violence.

That is, it's exactly the same problems that are fixed by those 90% of the abortions that are done because the woman doesn't want her life to get all screwed up in those ways.

All this seems like you're saying its good because it leads to more abortions which leads to less unwanted babies, but again you're ignoring the very large portion of the country who either doesn't believe in abortion period or doesn't think it should be used in the same way you might use other forms of birth control.

&gt;If you're genuinely saying that about women too, I've got no quarrel with you. (Well, a different quarrel, anyway - one that's not relevant to this post.)

Yep I mean it about both sexes. 

&gt;When the woman tells the man that she's pregnant and he's the father, he should take it very very seriously before deciding to opt out. Because odds are good that that decision will significantly increase the chance that she'll decide to abort the child or give it up for adoption. That's a serious thing. But becoming a father would seriously alter the course of his life, and that's a serious thing too, and he deserves the right to make that decision for himself.

Again, all of these decisions could be made before he chooses to engage in an act where the creation of a baby is a possible (if not predictable and intended) outcome. You seem to think that consequence free sex is like some kind of inalienable right men should have. If you're not ready to have a kid maybe you're not ready to have sex and if you decide to take that risk anyways deal with the consequences.

&gt;Does that emotional damage not apply to the man, too?

Yeah.... not sure where you are going with that though.

Honest question, do actually think that men should be able to opt of parenthood or are you taking that point of view just for the sake of doing so? And if so, at what point in the pregnancy and birthing process do you think there should be a cut off for the father opting out if there should be a cutoff at all?",2015-11-27 21:23:19+00:00,cxf2gln,11.0,t1_cxe2u96,85915.0,changemyview

2406,"Thanks for that correction and yeah thats totally what I meant.

I get what you're saying about the double standard but I think a) that somewhat boils down to biology. The baby is cared carried to term by the mother. She gets more control. b) I really don't think letting men opt out of paying for a child they helped create fixes anything.

As for my personal opinion, I think that people of both men and women should be prepared for a predictable consequence of having sex. If you don't want to be a parent or pay for a kid then maybe you shouldn't engage in an act whose entire evolutionary purpose is to create a kid. Yeah, abortions and adoptions are one option but you seem to suggest those decisions can/should be taken with the same levity as deciding to get your hair cut. Abortion ends the life of someone who would otherwise be born and the process can be both emotionally and physically damaging to the women. Adoption can also be emotionally damaging for both the mother and the child who could be raised in foster care. I'm pro-choice but I could understand why others actively oppose abortion or choose not to do it. The viewpoint is also pretty sexist as it expects women to deal with literally every single consequence of pregnancy and men to be responsible for literally none. 

As others have stated, the policy suggested by the OP also has HUGE downsides in practical terms. It would mean that unwanted kids get less money and without having to worry about paying for kids men would be more willing to engage in risky sex since they don't have to worry about getting women pregnant.

2407,"&gt; I think that the majority of people support the laws allowing women to abort. (I might be wrong about that - there are lots of pro-life people out there. But my quarrels with them are different ones - I wouldn't make this particular ""if you support this right for women, you should support it for men"" argument to them.)

This is not true. Its about 50-50 in America (not sure if thats where your from as well). Its trending upward so it might be somewhat higher support among pro-choice but certainly its not so overwhelmingly accepted that you can say that its ""Society has accepted it to be okay...""

&gt;I think that the majority of people support the laws allowing women to give up the child for adoption. (I'm just guessing on this one, I don't actually know any numbers. Although one point is that every US state has safe-haven laws[1] .)

Of course. The number of people who are against adoption has to be tiny. The number of people is much smaller for those who think that a woman should be forced into an adoption because the other person that created that baby doesn't feel are responsible for it.

I think most pro-choice people are supportive of women who choose to abort for any of those ~90% most common reasons for aborting[2] like ""too young"", ""don't want a kid with this particular man"", ""not financially ready"", etc. That is, I think it's extremely rare to hear pro-choice people saying, ""Well, I guess technically you have the right to abort and I support that, but I strongly condemn you for doing so - I think abortion should only be done in cases of rape or medical issues, not to weasel out of your responsibility as a mother."" And I think it's much more common to hear pro-choice people saying, ""It's 100% reasonable for you to abort, you're not ready to be a mother yet and that's totally fine.""

How about lets forget stats all together and just do the eye test? Well thats what PFF does. Right now they're putting him as number 10. In fact, if you look at various rankings you would be hard pressed to find one where he is not in the top 10. 

I think you'd have to be delusional to say he's not top 10 and there is a pretty good case for being considerably higher than 10.

2516,"&gt;What are you attempting to say when you say that they weren't categorically more injured than other teams if not to say that they weren't a more injured team than other teams?
I'm curious what distinction you're attempting to make here.

That they're on one end of a continuum of injuries but they're not soooo much more injured than the rest of the league that can't be expected play at the same level. The Giants on the other hand are categorically more injured.

I think the entire premise that you're pushing is a bit flawed (injured teams can't do well) and the numers your giving have actually further convinced me. Consider 2013. Of the top 10 most injured teams in the league 7 of those teams made the playoffs. The Colts have been the 30th ranked team in AGL the last two years and in those two years eliminated the 2nd (KC) and 1st (Den) healthiest teams in the NFL. In fact, over the past decade the Colts and the Patriots have been among the most dominant teams in the NFL and the most injured. 

&gt;Dismissing the fact that the Giants were incredibly fortunate to get a ton of injured players back, while also lucky to be in a terrible division in which 9-7 is a first place record and gets them in to the playoffs, is rather suspect. I'm thinking that's there's nothing more to be said here.

I'm dismissing it for several reasons. For one, you keep going on about how they got healthy players when other teams had unhealthy players but ignore that also means they had unhealthy players when other teams had healthy players. Its also easy to say they lucked into the playoffs but when the win multiple playoff games and eventually the superbowl it says something about the quality of teams. And finally, as I stated already, injuries have no ability to predict success. This year highlights it. Two of the most injured teams faced off in the Superbowl. 

Do we at least agree that AGL does not predict success?

2517,"It's not really all that ironic, regarding Coughlin. They went 9-7 that year and were incredibly lucky in two ways. One was that that was a good enough record to make the playoffs, the other was that they happened to get healthy right at the end of the season, getting a bunch of players back right when most other teams are starting to lose them.

It is pretty ironic. You implied that he can't coach a team to wins yet he coached one of the most injured teams to a super bowl win. The fact that those injuries were assymetrically distributed doesn't negate that fact. Belichick also coached one of the most injured teams in the league to the Superbowl. In fact, if you run the number (at least for 2014, which I did) there is no correlation between team success and win-loss record. Injured teams don't do poorly, healthy teams don't do well.


&gt;My point with bringing up the statistic, anyways, was your claim that the Chargers weren't any more injured than other teams last year when there's statistics showing that they were the 2nd most injured team in the league last year. There's obviously some revision going on that's effective your perspective.
 
I never at any point said they weren't injured. You probably misread my statement that they weren't **categorically** more injured than other teams. In 2013 they were 28th in AGL meaning that there were 4 teams that were more injured and the difference between them and the 32nd ranked team was equal to them and the 5th ranked team. They were by no means an outlier. In 2014 they 31st but the difference between them but again were not outliers. 

&gt;As for why we shouldn't fire him? Because it would be absurd to expect any coach to win consistently with what we've put on the field the past two years.

You seem to be focused entirely on win-loss record. Like I've said, there seems like plenty of stuff to judge him on beyond that. You don't like those but your argument essentially boils down to the idea that McCoy's coaching ability is a complete mystery because the team has been injured.  

&gt;I can think of another team owner that would expect ridiculous results from coaches without giving them the tools to succeed, unfortunately he died. I miss having Al Davis up there, guaranteeing that his teams would stay irrelevant by needlessly rotating through coaches the moment they didn't polish the turd.

Ever heard of recency bias? Al Davis also brought three Superbowl Championships to his team. They only petered off as a force in the last decade or so and that had more to do with them not having a good QB rather than them not having a good coach. You want to know a team that gives their coaches a few years to prove themselves and fires them when they don't? Every team. This isn't a Raiders thing.

There are coaches that can lead injured teams to success. Also Coughlin also has proven success so you give him some slack in a down year. McCoy hasn't proven anything so far. 

&gt;All the rest of the rhetoric about how he deals with the media, unsourced rumors, or nit picking at a call or two every couple games is irrelevant to me.

The media thing has more to do with the fact that he doesn't seem to have any rationale for anything he does. And some of the unsourced rumors are not unsourced. Weddle (yes I know the caveats with him) came out said people were slacking of and low and behold we get trounced by the Raiders. And that call or two thing isn't just a minor thing. In some of these games it could have meant the difference between winning and losing.

&gt;If we were losing with talent on the field, like we often were with Norv, I'd go grab my pitchfork and join the angry mob... But that hasn't been the case.

Again, they were scoring every single time they got the ball so I suspect that a opening drive three and out would have netted the same result as a two and interception. Also the only reason it was even remotely close is because the Raiders took their foot off the gas and the only reason they did that was because the lead was so big. 

That game was a thorough whipping on both sides of the ball. I personally think the defense played worse but I don't think you can honestly say that either side played even remotely well.",2015-10-31 17:26:57+00:00,cwjlxp8,4.0,t1_cwjkkpl,2376.0,Chargers

Thats more or less a pure defensive stat.

2541,"&gt;Total DVOA is useless to post for this question. You would've looked more objective had you posted passing and rushing DVOA for both situations.

I disagree. Teams can survive by going pass heavy or rush heavy. While I think that its good to strive for a balance I don't see why you would ding a team for being pass heavy or run heavy so long as it gets the job done. It also doesn't change much.

Here's those numbers:

Offensive pass DVOA: 5th
Offensive rush DVOA: 30th
Defensive pass DVOA: 23rd
Defensive rush DVOA: 30th

So the offensive is very pass heavy and not very run heavy, but the defensive is bad in stopping both kinds of attacks.

I agree with your points about the offensive doing a lot of stupid things. I just think at this point they're not the thing dragging us down. I also don't know that agree with some of the mitigating issues for Pagano. He doesn't have great talent but thats probably in part to his inability to develop it. He's had 4 years to get this defense going and its been in the bottom of the league all 4 years. During his tenure two first round picks have been defensive and two have been offensive. In the last draft four out five players drafted were defensive. In the draft before it was 50/50. We've also picked up free agents like Flowers and Freeney. He's had one of the best safeties in the league in Weddle. He's been given tools and year after year the Chargers remain one of the worst defenses in the league.",2015-10-30 17:30:49+00:00,cwiklpm,2.0,t1_cwhvvev,57868.0,Chargers

2568,"I don't think anyone, Gordon included, could say how he's doing. Poor coaching, poor personnel choices, and injuries to the O-line have never given him a chance to show us what he is capable of. Our O-line is awful, both due to bad players being on the roster and injuries to good players, and he is frequently stopped behind the line due to penetration by the defense. Holes just are not opening up for him. The play calling is really bad too. Its seems like he is always either running out a shotgun draw formation (which never seems to go anywhere regardless of who is running) or Rivers is undercenter and its incredibly obvious to the defense what is about to happen. In both cases he is ran up the middle for almost nothing. On these rare occasions though the runs go to the outside and he seems to get big yardage. Not sure why the coaches don't run him to the outside more. Overall he seems to get in the zero plus or minus two yard range or he breaks out a big one. Nothing between the two. He's definitely shown flashes of being really good, breaking tackles, and being very elusive. He needs better play calling, a better line, and possibly a fullback to see what he can really do.

He does have one big issue that you have to put somewhat on him: fumbling. He's fumbled 4 times this year which is tied for highest in the league. Given the small number of runs he's been asked to do that pretty remarkable. He's got to work on that. If he had some help then this could go away.

2589,"The phrase is lowest common denominator. Least common denominator is a math phrase.

People don't disagree with you because of some Philip Rivers circle jerk. People are disagreeing with you because it flat out doesn't make sense. Here are the main issues.

1) Rivers has not been playing bad. He played bad last game but he was lights out vs Green Bay, Detroit, and Cleveland. He leads the league in passing yards, attempts, and completions, but not interception. Of course he's got a few interceptions (who wouldn't when they throw the ball that many times) but he's not an outlier in terms of interceptions as an absolute number or a percentage. His interception is slightly worse than Roethlesberger and slightly better than Palmer. Consider also that two of seven interceptions were grabbed after bouncing of the hands of a receiver so his numbers are a bit inflated. 

2) Clemmens is NOT good. He played well in Minnesota but that was in garbage time. Look how much of an outlier that game was in terms of passer rating: http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/ClemKe00.htm. Most of his games hover in the 30-60 range. He played like crap in the preseason. He's not only not good enough to take the reigns from Rivers, but he actually might be the worse backup QB in the league. 

3) Gordon and Rivers are in two completely different positions. Gordon can be benched because he when you take him out you can replace him with the RBs (three if you count Brown) that are arguably better than him. Even if they weren't better you can thrive even when you are forced to abandon the running game. Rivers backup is nowhere close to as good as him and a team cannot succeed without a good QB. Gordon also is a outlier in terms of how he has been playing. He leads the league in fumbles despite his few touches. He is not very good in yards/attempt. I chalk the latter up to the bad line but the fumbling is a very big problem.

On the flipside our two guards were rated worst in the league last week but one of them is getting bumped out of the starting line up by Franklin's return. 

As for the secondary, we're less worried by the absence of Weddle than the presence of Flowers. Weddle has been unusually quiet this season, making few plays and getting torched a few times. Flowers on the other hand has just been pure garbage and stands out from the crowd. Hopefully his back ups Williams and Robinson get more play time. They have both gotten interceptions in their limited play time and both are looking pretty good.

They didn't actually go for it and maybe they had no intention of doing so but the aggressiveness earlier in the game probably helped draw them offsides. A defensive lineman who think he's going to need to stop someone from running a half yard is going to be in a different frame of mind than one who thinks he's just trying to be drawn offsides. Just shows how being aggressive vs conservative really causes ripples that can affect the rest of the game. 

Also while everyone has been cursing Reich for not running the ball enough, I think Sunday was really successful in part because they almost explicitly abandoned the run.

Two things changed at the same time. You can't say one was causing or the other. The team got bad and it got increasingly difficult to see them. Which one is the cause? You're saying its the losing because you've already made up your mind. I'm saying its the traffic because LA has a long history of supporting bad teams. The Rams had an insanely bad losing record from 1959 to 1964 but still remained in the top half or quarter of the league in attendance. Lakers have been awful lately and still are among the top teams in attendance. Dodgers have been in the top half of the league every single year in LA.

2751,"Interesting. Very well researched answer. I appreciate the thought that went into your response. You've got me convinced that both teams did indeed have low attendance their final few years. I'm still not sold on that being the reason they left. 

The Raiders had a pretty open disagreement with the city over the stadium and it was cited as the reason they left. Articles written at the time make this clear and don't even mention attendance as a contributory factor. See [here](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/22/sports/pro-football-fast-money-could-lure-raiders-back-to-oakland.html) and [here](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/07/sports/football-davis-ready-to-do-battle-returns-to-oakland.html). These articles mention Al Davis' attempts to fleece the city and stay which doesn't make sense if he wanted to leave because of poor attendance. Seems like the attendance causing the teams to leave is retrospective. Also the slump in the attendance for the Raiders doesn't go back very far and if the move to Oakland was because of low attendance it must have been poorly thought out as it doesn't increase after they move and still hasn't. If a few years of poor attendance would spur teams to move then the Bucs and Lions should have done so as they have consistently been in the bottom five in attendance. 

As for the Rams they did have poor attendance for the final few years but again the poor attendance only goes back a few years. As much as you don't like the Anaheim excuse the attendance did drop off big time when they moved to Anaheim. They were top of the league in LA and then went to middle and low in Anaheim. So I guess its not so much that you don't think there wasn't a drop-off as much as you don't think its a valid reason for not going to the games? Also like the Raiders, the Rams were pretty public about the reason they left and like the Raiders it had to do with stadium issues. 

It just seems to me that given how open both teams were about why they moved, given how brief the periods of poor attendance, given the fact that there have been numerous other teams who have had multi-year attendance slumps and not moved, and neither move has increased attendance (although that could be due to poor calculations) the idea that they left because of poor attendance doesn't make sense.

2752,"This seems to get at how stats are so often misapplied when analyzing football. You have no idea what the true odds of success are on an individual play. Just because some play has a league wide 50/50 chance of succeeding that doesn't mean that you have a 50% chance of succeeding if you call that play. If you're the Patriots playing the Bucs you likely have a higher chance, if its the opposite then it might be lower. Even when you hone in on the team and the player you still can't take averages to mean true probabilities. If you're normally good running back is getting stuffed all night you can't assume that he's going to get his season wide averages.

Thats why Bayesian stats are much better. They were also really relevant to the discussion of the final play of the SB. There was the should-have-run circle jerk and then the everyone-who-thinks-they-should-have-run-is-an-idiot counter circle jerk.

2768,"I agree with what you guys said in the episode about McCoy's decision to let the clock run down at the half. The best argument I have heard is that he and Marvin Lewis were having a sort of Mexican standoff where neither would stop the clock and if McCoy were to stop the clock Lewis would have gone for it on fourth. To me this doesn't make much sense because it seems unlikely they could read each others intentions that well and it seems unlikely that the Bengals would go for it on 4th given their 8 point lead going into the half. I think it was a poor decision.

But let me play devil's advocate for a minute: As great as Rivers is he has a tendency to get turnovers more at the end of halves. This week he got a turnover in the final minutes of the game. The week before he got a turnover right before half time. Last year his overall passer rating 93.8 was but his passer rating in the final 2 minutes of a half was 74.2. In the 2014 season opener against the Cardinals the Chargers tried rushing down the field and with a few tens of seconds left the Cardinals picked the ball, set up a field goal, the Cardinals won the game by one point, and the Chargers missed the playoffs by one game. Maybe McCoy's rationale was that why put Rivers on the field at a time when he plays the worst, especially when we're down by a single possession (or two since McCoy never goes for it on two until his hand is forced)?",2015-09-24 17:39:01+00:00,cvcs7yo,1.0,t3_3m7lbz,7164.0,Chargers

2771,Yeah its crazy and its being said by people that inherently in a poor position to be making that judgement and by people who are outright rejecting data to the contrary.

2772,"&gt;I mean be real though. Who do you think has the largest fan base in LA?

Twitter data mining indicates that Chargers and Raiders fans have nearly equal fan bases with the Raiders having a little more. Polling data indicate that all three teams have about equal support with Chargers perhaps having the lead. 

&gt;Second, Dean will have to spend millions of dollars to effect what has the potential to be only an incremental change in the percentage of new fans

Its not only about gaining new fans its also about losing fans up North. Greater LA has 18 million people whereas SD has 3 million. Any team (and especially multiple teams) moving to LA will significantly cut into Charger's share of the LA fan base. 

&gt;LA fans might've driven to SD for games but SD fans are not going to be driving up to LA, at least not at the same rate as it currently is.

They would also be in a city with a greater population, be closer to OC, Riverside, and San Bernardino. I think some people would be driving up but it almost wouldn't matter if they didn't. The number of people within say a 50 mile radius of the Chargers would have vastly increased. 

&gt;Plus, it'd be one thing if the Patriots moved to LA. They're currently top tier and have won championships in the modern era. The Chargers have 0 titles in the modern era and are a perennially good team on paper that somehow manages to overcome all obstacles in their way in order to remain average.

I think the impact of something like that doesn't matter as much as you might think. The Browns sucked but when they moved to Baltimore and became the Ravens that didn't matter. By the same token, the Baltimore Colts never won anything but when they moved to Indianapolis the locals certainly took a liking to them. The idea that a team would move somewhere and then be rejected by the locals simply has no precedent (in all of sports to my knowledge) and plenty of examples of teams with no championships or teams made from scratch providing counterexamples.

2773,"I find the idea that there is no market and Spanos doesn't know it to crazy on multiple accounts. First, and simplest is that most observations indicate there are indeed a large number of Chargers fans in LA. Twitter data mining suggests that about 9% of NFL fans in LA are Chargers fans compared to 40% in SD. There idea that there are no Chargers fans in LA is mostly said by people who do not live there and refuted by those that do. Go check /r/LosAngeles posts about NFL. Its pretty clear when you get into a subreddit affiliated with the city and not a particular team, there are lots of Chargers fans in LA. Given that LA is nearly three times the size of SD this means that a significant number of fans live in LA (not to mention OC which is ""closer"" to LA given that most of OC lives in the North County). Second, Spanos and the NFL have access to marketing research that we simply don't have. For example, what percentage of Chargers jerseys are bought buy LA residents? I have no idea but they do. 

I want Chargers to stay in SD as much as the next guy but I just find it bizarre in logic.

To me it was inexplicable. We had two time outs and could have forced them to play the whole field and the run. Who knows how far they could have taken it. Then there were the two wasted time outs in the second half which seemed to not help the game given that they were followed by a sack and a Bengals TD.

Chiefs haven't won a playoff game in twenty years, including the Turner era. The only reason you can't nominate the Chiefs to the ultimate choker category is that they either never make it to the playoffs or never make it past the first round.

Reid has been the head coach for two seasons. In one season the Chiefs ended with a better record, but were swept by the Chargers and didn't make it as far in the playoffs as the Chargers. The next season they had the same record as the Chargers and neither team made it to the playoffs. You act like they have been dominating the AFCW since Reid has been at the helm. 

&gt; Even with a ""better QB"" the Chargers offense was worse than the Chiefs last season. 

The Chiefs had **five** more points last year but considerably more yardage. As you rightfully touted, you had some of the best special teams in the league. So tell me again how it is that you have a better offense and better special teams and only scored five more points?


It seems like everyone is ranking Chiefs and Chargers neck-and-neck or at least in the same general level (ESPN: SD 13, KC 14; r/NFL: SD 15, KC 14; Sports illustrated: SD 9, KC 15; CBS: SD 16, KC 18; SBNation: SD 15, KC 10) and most Chargers fans are saying ""Yeah, we're pretty close"" but for some reason the Chiefs fans think they're waaaaaaay better probably because they have an inflated sense of their offense.

2913,"There's a few things that I recall reading that I was curious to see if you had anything to add to (or correct me since you obviously know this subject matter very well).

The first is that part of the reason that Allies didn't want to have a German court deciding the fate of German war criminals was the complete failure of the [Leipzig War Crimes Trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig_War_Crimes_Trials) after WWI. Essentially what happened is that the victorious allies submitted to the German government a list of 900 names of people they believed had committed war crimes. The Germans refused to extradite these individuals to the Allied governments and were allowed to conduct their own trials instead. The result was a complete farce with Germany trying only a few individuals, acquitting most, and handing down extremely light sentences to those who were convicted. This set precedent that the allies could not trust the Germans to prosecute their own war criminals. The Allies were well aware of the issues of impartiality associated with assigning judges from the allied powers, but they had essentially tried the alternative already and it failed. 

I also recall that some of the criticism was that the trial was conducted in an odd format was essentially made for the trial. The weird format stems from the fact that France, Russia, and Germany use a civil law legal system, whereas the US and the UK use a common law legal system. I don't remember the exact differences in how this affects the conduct of a trial but I believe its substantial. The civil law system lays out the case and all the evidence before the trial whereas the common law systems lays out the case and evidence as the trial is conducted and can bring to light new evidence (don't quote me on that). To accommodate all the major parties they formed some amalgam that no one was quite happy with and that some critics said was a sham.

2919,"Interesting. I was in Dresden last September and I recall correctly the current rail station is in the Altstadt are and was fairly close to the region that got bombed. Could that be why this region was more heavily bombed? I don't know if the old station was in the same location as the new one. 



 &gt;But please keep in mind, do we really justify crimes with the result? I respect your opinion, but in my eyes, nothing justifies massslaughtering thousands of civilians. And especially not revenge, because the civilians were not the men executing orders on the front.

Its morally complex. To me it boils down to the cold calculus of trying to get as few civilian deaths and the difference between sin by omission and sin by commission. If the Allies let the war draw on longer the civilian death toll would have been much larger than taking the measures necessary to hasten the end of the war. Not bombing Dresden would not have killed those Dresdeners, but the war would have arguably gone on longer an a different group of civilians would have died instead. Bombing Dresden would potentially hastened the end of the war, but at the cost of the German civilian lives. The first is a sin by omission with a larger death toll whereas the second is sin by commission but has a smaller death toll. I think the later option is the lesser of two evils. To accept that the bombing of Dresden saved lives in the long run (not that you necessarily agree with this point) but was still wrong requires a sort of moral absolutism that is almost untenable in trying to understanding WWII. 

&gt;Also, the numbers of deaths is quit disputed.

True, but even with the high (and even absurdly high) numbers like 100,000 were talking about the number of civilians killed by German in the span of a week or so. 

I hadn't heard of those eye witness reports, but I'll have to read up on that. 

P.s. Modern day Dresden is an awesome city! Definitely one of the gems of Germany that a lot of tourists overlook. I don't want to take the attitude of the other guy who was basically saying ""fuck Germany. they got what was coming"".

2920,"As I understand it, and obviously you might know better, is the idea that Dresden was a city of culture and not war industry was a largely a myth created by Goebels. [This lists of some of the war related industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II#Military_and_industrial_profile) that was supposedly in the city. In addition the city is/was a major railroad hub. Its part of nearly straight line that runs from Vienna to Prague to Dresden to Berlin. Its also the Eastern most major city in Germany and access point to the Eastern front. At the time of the bombing the Germans were in the process of their retreat from the East and bombing Dresden both slowed this process down and prevented reinforcements from arriving from the West. These all seem like valid war aims. 

The civilian toll was large (~25k) but Germany was killing roughly that number of civilians every four days in the holocaust and that number would be hit about every two days when you include the Russian civilians. The war needed to be stopped.

Whether price gouging is moral or not is subject to debate and a quick google search will reveal that a lot of people think it is not. Certainly if we are to label a group of people that should be immune from price guaging you would think that children would fit that bill. The other thing is whether movies are truly luxury items especially for teenagers. Movies are a big part of our culture and a teenager who is out of the cultural loop is might be somewhat stigmatized at a time when they are most sensitive to stigmatization. I know that's perhaps a bit overly sensitive, but essentially it seems like price gouging of movie tickets would prevent poorer kids from being a participant in something that constitutes a large part of mainstream culture.

&gt;Whether or not a 14-16 year old can legally ""hold a job"" varies by jurisdiction, but there's no reason they can't earn money, either - there is a difference, and it isn't (or at least wasn't) uncommon for teens to actually work for money (the old babysitting, paper route, odd-jobbing work was common back in my day). 

That's really going to vary quite a bit. The legal ability to work is going to vary by district (but I doubt there is anywhere a child can work at 13), but also by family. Most 13-17 years are not working and the working one is an exception, not the norm.

I buy it, vegans do live longer. But you'll notice that along side that they published another article along side this analyzing what they eat besides meat and found [""Thus, although vegetarian dietary patterns in the AHS-2 have been defined based on the absence of animal foods in the diet, they differ greatly with respect to the consumption of many other food groups. These differences in food consumption patterns may be important in helping to explain the association of vegetarian diets with several important health outcomes.""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25247790).

Even vegans call it a lifestyle rather than a diet. Do know of any study carefully controlled study which has shown that a healthy vegan diet is healthier than a healthy non-vegan diet?

Also worth noting that the US Strategic Bombing Survey which you quoted did conclude that the bombing is what led to the end of the Japanese surrender and its conclusion that the bombing was not necessarily required to end the war was noted to be retrospective and not something the decision makers of 1945 necessarily could have or would have known.

3031,"From a utilitarian standpoint I find it almost impossible to say that the dropping of the atomic bombs did not a save lives. Operation Downfall was projected to costs the lives of millions and millions. Look at Battle of Okinawa which was fresh in the minds of those planning the war. Japanese losses were at 120,000 soldiers killed (many of which were hastily conscripted by the Japanese army) and up to 150,000 civilians killed or committed suicide. This was a case study of how the invasion of Japanese mainland could play out over and over. And thats just the Japanese. To quote wikipedia on potential American losses:

""The Battle of Okinawa resulted in 72,000 US casualties in 82 days, of whom 12,510 were killed or missing (this is conservative, because it excludes several thousand US soldiers who died after the battle indirectly, from their wounds). The entire island of Okinawa is 464 sq mi (1,200 km2). If the US casualty rate during the invasion of Japan had been only 5% as high per unit area as it was at Okinawa, the US would still have lost 297,000 soldiers (killed or missing). ""

Also bear in mind that Japan was killing Chinese civilians at a rate of 20,000 a week and creating a man made famine in Vietnam that was killing at about the same rate. When you add in the human toll in Burma, the Philippines, Laos, and so on you're talking maybe 50,000 deaths a week. 

And the argument that they were on the brink of defeat anyways is pretty weak. The German had essentially lost the war by 1943 and by June 1944 it had dragged on long enough that generals had plotted to kill Hitler in order to hasten the war's end and it STILL dragged on for another year. Yeah, Japan loss was eminent but whose to say it wouldn't have dragged on another year or two.

&gt;You've supported the first, not so much the second (there are plenty of claims that he's actual very liberal.

Since when is being a flip flopper or misrepresenting your true stances seen as a strength?

&gt;I'm fine if you use it as weak evidence. You seem to using it as very strong evidence (going from 50/50 to 90/10 is a Bayes factor of 9), which I think is only justified if validated.

Where did you get 9 from? I never put a number on Trump except to say that it was considerably less than 50%. I never said that his win probability would be as low or lower than Romney's. I said that Romney had a low win probability despite having some advantages over Trump. 

&gt;In the absence of data, the correct thing to do is become less confident (or revert to your uninformative prior); you're having a very high confidence based on ""common sense"", which I disagree with.

Where did you read my high confidence from? Was it when I used strong words like **seems** and **pretty** as in ""It seems pretty improbable..."" or was it when I used specific and not at all vague word ""considerably""?

Not everyone feels that their opinions needs to be validated with statistical models especially when there is no data to even build a statistical model. When the data for these does come in I expect them to accurately predict the outcome of the election but not to be wildly from predictions based on intuition and a reading of popular opinion. In the mean time, while we wait on this data, do you expect people to just be quiet and not talk about election outcomes or something?

&gt;Could you elaborate on this? What model do you have that outputs 10% chance or so? My claim is that you can't get very far based on opinions on polarizing in the absence of polling data; I'll reconsider that if you can demonstrate that such a simplified model does well in predicting past elections. If you don't have such an analysis, I don't see how you can justify putting a strong weight on such information.

I've linked something showing that he's an outlier in terms of Republicans and his ""outlier-ness"" puts him right of anything the democrats could want. 

You're being pretty pedantic with this statistical model approach. I stated a fairly reasonable opinion, if popularity is any measure of reasonability, and you're expecting me to substantiate this view with polling data and bayesian models with clearly defined priors and posteriors and so forth. Even Nate Silver, the statistical model guru, knows that they have limitations that often made up for by things like common sense. That's why Sabernomics approach has not killed the baseball scout and fivethrityeight has not killed the old fashion political pundit. In the absence of polling data, our common sense and knowledge of similar historical situations are a fallback. Both of these should tell you that if in the agreed upon unlikely scenario of Trump winning the nomination he would not draw even with eventual democratic nominee.

It was [8 percent on the eve of the election](http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/03/nov-2-for-romney-to-win-state-polls-must-be-statistically-biased/)

&gt; Third, have you validated your polarization model? If not, then I'd argue your prior should be 50/50, and without new relevant information, that's where it stays. Using an unvalidated feeling of ""polarized"" shouldn't move the number that far, which is why I argued above that the number is close to 50.

I'm not building a statistical model or drawing on non-existent polling data for my ""polarization model"" that is validated. Its an opinion based on what people think of Trump, his stances, and a history of other candidates who have similar shortcomings. If Trump wins the nomination he'll have a very [difficult time playing the center or even really getting his base fired up](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/donald-trump-is-the-nickelback-of-gop-candidates/). Candidates who fail to do either one of those do poorly. George McGovern failed to convince America that he was a moderate look at that election result. 

Also, Hillary is also almost certainly going to win the democratic nomination after an a shorter, less mud slinging filled Primary. If so, she'll have more time to campaign for the general election and will have that edge over Republican candidate. 

&gt;Also, he's currently not expected to win the nomination by pundits, so conditioning on that yields a lot of information; presumably it would only happen if he became less polarizing.

Basically he was called to court as a statistical expert in a case where there was some baby formula that increased the incidence of some disease or condition in babies (can't remember the exact details). The statistical test showed that while babies on this formula had an increase incidence of this condition the p-value came out to p=0.07. The baby food's manufacturer kept trying to get him to admit that according to commonly accepted scientific standard that the test showed that there was no statistically significant difference, while he kept basically saying, ""yeah, but that p-value cutoff is an arbitrary one and the data indicates its highly likely that this food makes babies sick. Based on these data I think the baby food is making them sick and would not feed it to my kid"".

3074,"While everything you said is true, the p-value here is being yielded in the incorrect way. The p-value cutoff is 0.05 but this is arbitrary and if something had a p-value of say 0.08 its more than likely to be true even though it didn't reach statistical significance. Moreover, because of the low sample size it would be almost impossible for anything to reach statistical significance. The low sample size probably means that the statistical test is underpowered. Power is a that measures the ability of a statistical test to find a statistically significant difference, if one were there, given the data set. Power analysis gives a value called alpha which measures that likelihood and it's cuttoff is usually set to 0.95, the inverse of the 0.05 cutoff value. This means that you want your data to have a 95% chance of detecting a difference if one were to accept.

To truly accept the the null hypothesis (the balls were not deflated) you would need a p-value of more than 0.05 and an alpha value of more than 0.95, which is probably unlikely. Without these two criteria met you can only make statements like ""while the statistical test was did not show a significant difference, the data is underpowered and indicates that its more than likely that the balls were deflated.""

3080,"Notice how in your example you chose something where the value was highly concentrated on a small number? That aint no accident. When you're discussing assymetric or biased distribution of something, a case can only be made when the numbers are near the extreme ends of things. Here's an example: 

How about this one: when a regular person goes before a grand jury there is a 99.94% chance of indictment. When a cop goes before a grand jury there is a 1.2% chance of indictment. Here's the source on that: http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/ferguson-michael-brown-indictment-darren-wilson/

Very clear special treatment. But as the numbers move from those extreme ends your case weakens until as your reach 50%. Thats the value at which things can be the least asymmetrically distributed. This is just a property of numbers. 

So if lets just pretend that grand juries indict only half the time and the percentage of time a cop is indicted by a grand jury is unknown. In that scenario if a cop was not indicted it would be hard to say that he got special treatment because it would have been a coin flip even if he was just a random person. 

Moreover, your logic is hugely flawed because even if you assume that the distribution is as biased as possible (the indicted half are poor, the non-indicted half are all wealthy and powerfully connected) you would have to assume that half of all people are highly connected, influential, people.

3091,"Here are what I see as the biggest issues with the TSA:

A) Its invasive. Being x-rayed is one thing but the TSA is often submitting people to full body scans and occasional strip searches. Its also time consuming and annoying. You might not mind this because you don't remember a time when it wasn't this way, but if you did remember this or you were of a race (which you may be) that was subject to more invasive examination more often than you may feel differently. Its also a slippery slope when you start compromising liberty for security but thats a longer argument.

B) Its useless. [A recent study](http://www.citylab.com/commute/2015/06/airport-security-astoundingly-expensive-and-95-percent-ineffective/394778/) found them to be 95% ineffective.

[They weren't even able to recognize](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tsa-fails-identify-73-employees-terror-watch-lists-n371601) that numerous aviation employees had active links to terrorism.

C) Its expensive. As of last year the budget of the TSA was $4.6 billion. That's not a huge amount of money when you compare it to things like defense spending or social security but is a lot when you compare it to less funded portions of our government and when you consider that its ineffective. [Here is the National Institutes of Health's Budget](http://report.nih.gov/categorical_spending.aspx). You'll see that we spend about $5.5 billion each year researching cancer. You could essentially double the amount cancer research in this country if you were to liquidate the TSA and put its budget towards better purposes.

So basically were sacrificing liberty, allowing strangers to invasively examine us, spends gobs of money and are no safer because we did so. That's a high price to pay for the illusion of security.

3097,"&gt;Sure, Golden Retrievers and Labs have bitten people; but it's always a quick snap and release. They're warning bites and normally occur when something accidental occurs (like stepping on the dog's tail). 

[This woman begs to differ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabelle_Dinoire). She was the first woman to receive a face transplant and had to do so because she was attacked by her own labrador retriever in her sleep. 

I think the biggest issue in with your view is that you give much consideration to the fact that many pitbulls are the breed that is selected by man to be most vicious. There are many people that raise pitbulls to be vicious either as guard dogs or as fighters. While pitbulls certainly do bite the most, other factors are more predictive of biting behavior. For example:

[""There is no shortage of more stable generalizations about dangerous dogs, though. A 1991 study in Denver, for example, compared a hundred and seventy-eight dogs with a history of biting people with a random sample of a hundred and seventy-eight dogs with no history of biting. The breeds were scattered: German shepherds, Akitas, and Chow Chows were among those most heavily represented. (There were no pit bulls among the biting dogs in the study, because Denver banned pit bulls in 1989.) But a number of other, more stable factors stand out. The biters were 6.2 times as likely to be male than female, and 2.6 times as likely to be intact than neutered. The Denver study also found that biters were 2.8 times as likely to be chained as unchained. “About twenty per cent of the dogs involved in fatalities were chained at the time, and had a history of long-term chaining,” Lockwood said. “Now, are they chained because they are aggressive or aggressive because they are chained? It’s a bit of both. These are animals that have not had an opportunity to become socialized to people. They don’t necessarily even know that children are small human beings. They tend to see them as prey.”""](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/02/06/troublemakers-2).

So these non-breed related factors have a huge ability to explain the inter-dog variance in biting behaviors. If we suppose that pitbulls are more likely to be male (by selective adoption or something like that), less likely to be neutered, and/or more likely to be chained you can explain the higher biting rates in pitbulls without having to suppose some innate tendency towards aggression.",2015-07-28 15:24:59+00:00,ctj23fi,1.0,t3_3evypf,13323.0,changemyview

3155,"&gt; I forgot the main reason why I can't call this book one of my favorites. It was all telling. It was hard to visualize the environment because the narrator (Watney, for the most part, though it carried over to other characters), described things to us like an engineer would. It just fell flat. I don't think there was one paragraph of environmental description in the whole thing other than, ""The crater sat blah kilometers away from the Hab. I have to get there. Wish me luck!""

Totally agreed. I just finished the book today after powering through it in a couple days. As the book was almost over I realized that I had gone the whole time without really picturing Mars. Like really imagining what it looked like. I also didn't really picture the characters in my head. They were just talking voices. I sometimes get annoyed with overdescribing of how a character looks (""he had a long slender nose buttressed by his high cheek bones that clashed with his ashened black upturned mustache blah blah blah"") but at least give me something to work with. I really appreciated the attention to detail on the science end of things but this is definitely a **SCIENCE**^^^fiction where the authors inability to create complex interesting characters and inability to draw the reader into its world really hurt it.

3172,"I'll address what I see as the problem with each of your points.

1 - I think we can agree with the idea the more rights is better, but I take issue with the idea that rights should be limitless and that one given up never come back.

The issue with rights, as it relates to the vaccine debate, is whether you have the right to put your child and other children in danger in your exercising of rights. Do you have the right to make chemical fertilizer in your garage? No, because it could explode and kill your neighbors. Put other people in danger is not a right. 

Given up rights is not necessarily a a one way street. People had the right to drink, then they lost it, then they got it back. People had the right to smoke marijuana, then they lost it, and they're slowly getting it back.

2 - The fact that governments don't always have the best interest of the people in mind does not mean that it never has the interest of the people in mind. In this case its following the opinion of the vast majority of the medical profession in deciding to penalize those who do not vaccinate. This is a pretty good sign that they are acting in our best interest. I think you're going to have to decide empirically and on a case by case basis whether the action of the government are in the best interest of the people. 

3 - The legislation is following the science and there is no reason to think that it will not continue to. Right now (and for decades) the science is saying that it is in our best interest to be vaccinated. This is firm science in an era of unprecedented scientific advancement. If this conclusion were overturned, which I think is unlikely, I think legislature will act accordingly. People used to think cigarettes were healthy but when people realized that doctors were wrong the lawmakers did an about-face and made it very difficult to be a smoker in america.

&gt;Again, find me an example of when he has ever done this, I don't even need to point out that the vast majority of things he's known for aren't about his research.

This is ridiculous on three accounts. First, I'm saying that Tyson is a scientists because he does science experiments and publishes their results. I don't know how him being better known for other things somehow negates the fact that he does science. Bill Nye does not do experiments and is therefore not a scientist. Second, you don't think he communicates his finding to the public. What do you think a scientific publication is? They're not little secret notes that he sends to himself for his own satisfaction. They're communications of his results to the public. Third, I'm going to assume you mean communication of his results to a lay audience. If that is the case do you really expect me to go through his talks and find he is talking about findings he contributed to and when they're findings of others? [Here's a list of his publications](http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/curriculum-vitae#research) in case you want to do that for yourself. It doesn't matter for my argument so I'm not going to do it. 

&gt; I didn't know experimentation wasn't a part of the scientific method.

What experiment has he done and what did he find? He doesn't have any publications so am I to assume he just doesn't share these findings or what?

&gt;You don't understand how engineering works.

Let me state the obvious: you have no idea how science works. Science produces knowledge, engineers produce things. The science-engineer distinction is pretty accepted among scientists and engineers. Its not universally accepted distinction but its a very prominent school of thought. The fact that you think that because I belong to that school of thought I have no idea how engineering works tells me you're neither a scientists or an engineer and think that if someone disagrees with you it means they have no idea what they are talking about. In your weird blurred distinction where engineers are scientists do scientists get to call themselves engineers or is its application asymmetric?

&gt;As for all of your questions (and for Christ's sake please use quotes next time),

Pretty ironic that you feel others should help you read their writings when you spit out the following beast of a sentence...

&gt;**the fact that using scientist to not mean what you already think it does means it's hard for you to draw a nice little rigid box does not do anything to back up your argument.**

I pointed out that using the definition of a scientist as an expert is problematic because expert is imprecise. How much knowledge must be acquired before your an expert. Its vague. One person may think that he's an expert and therefore a scientists and the other might say he's no expert and therefore not a scientists. So its bad in terms of ambiguity and imprecision. The bigger issue, however, is that it doesn't even contain a requirement actually doing science and using the scientific method.

Personally, I think that using dictionary definitions in a debate of the meaning of a word is pretty problematic, because it was just a definition decided on by a group of people and is ultimately just a veiled appeal to authority. On top of that, the definition of a scientist as an expert is highly problematic because where do you draw the line as an expert? If I watch a Nat Geo program about giraffes am I suddenly a biologist? How expert do I have to be? 

The definition of a scientist as someone who conducts research is much more clearly defined and its the one used by philosophers of science who are interested in defining the ""scientist"" in a meaningful way that cannot necessarily be crammed into two sentences but does have a direct relationship to the practice of science and to the scientific method.

He does research, has publications of novel findings, and communicates those findings and the findings of others to the general public. To me its a pretty clear line in the sand, if you use the scientific method, engage in genuine conjecture, and publish your findings then your a scientists. If you don't, then you're not a scientist. 

The idea that an expert or a communicator are scientists seems like a way more problematic definition. When does someone become an expert? Is some who took biology in high school a biologist? What if they took AP bio? What if they major in biology in college? What if it was just a minor? If a bachelor's degree isn't enough, is a masters enough or do you need a doctorate? Definitely a lot of gray area but if you say that someone who engages in scientific research is a scientists then its fairly cut and dry. Same goes for the communicator route.

When the number of observations of something is low than each additional observation lends increased certainty that a true phenomenon has been observed and thus early replications meaningfully add to science by reducing uncertainty. After a large number of replication the effect of each additional iteration of the experiment is negligible (in terms of reducing uncertainty) and its more of a demonstration of science.

Russia certainly suffered and inflicted the most casualties, but were only able to do so with because of money, food and weapons made or paid for by America and Great Britain. Casualty statistics also can be a bit misleading. First, Germany's enemy in Russia was the weather just as much as it was the Russians. Its kind of hard to give Russia any credit for that. Second, they give no recognition to the British and American bombings of munitions factories and other important parts of there German war machine. These bombing runs don't generate large numbers of casualties on either side but they have huge impacts on the course of the war.

3206,"Nope. Thats totally incorrect. Just plug the numbers in to the equation: Vf^2 = Vi^2 + 2xgxd where vi=0 and g=9.81

Final speeds: 

2m fall = sqrt(2x9.81x2) = 6.26 m/s

4m fall = sqrt (2x9.81x4) = 8.82 m/s

Speed will increase as the square root of height, not the square. The kinetic energy increase as the square of speed so it kind of ""cancels out"" and energy increases linearly with height. That can be seen with the potential energy equation PE=m*g*height

It seems like Pinker is acknowledging that its possible that its pure chance but concludes its unlikely in part because the long peace has also been accompanied by a plethora of changes that indicate that we've become violence averse. So not only are we having less wars we also see an increase in the rights of people of other colors, creeds, and of women, children and even animals, a decrease in the levels of all crimes including murder and rape, and expansion of the kind of institutions that are predictive of peace. So basically while the period of peace has not gone on long enough to demonstrate that its occurrence is due to anything other than chance, the multitude of other changes it is embedded within suggest that its not in fact due to chance.

3218,"Yeah, I live in LA too and agree. The idea that there are no Chargers fans up here or that they make up only 3% of fans (or whatever number people use) is just crazy. Raider presence is definitely there in East LA but I think that has as much to do with the brand and trying to be like NWA as it does with the team itself. West LA is more of a mix and I think that if the Chargers did end up moving to LA they would dominate take over the Westside.

The idea that you can use the fan make up of a teamless city to predict whats going to happen has no validity at all. The people follow those teams because they don't' have a hometown team to root for. That would have been like saying in the mid-90's, ""Baltimore is Redskin's territory. If you try moving a team there no one is going to jump on board and the team will fail"". You can say the same thing about the Titans moving to Tennessee, the ""new Browns"", the Texans, the Jaguars, and even the Rams and Raiders. If there's a team in town, people start liking them. There just isn't a case where a team moved somewhere and failed because the team couldn't pull people away from whatever team they were already following. Has that happened in any sport?

I think that almost everyone, myself included, can agree that the Chargers staying in SD and facing no competition from an LA team is the best possible outcome but them moving to LA is far from the worst. It really comes down to whether you would rather have them stay in So Cal but move a few hours up the road, or would you rather see them have there market completely undercut and end up who knows where?",2015-06-19 16:16:49+00:00,csbz8rv,4.0,t1_csbo5mw,28765.0,Chargers

That equates to a decrease of 7.5% per year. If you do the math the 50% decrease in overall pollution levels between 2001 and 2011 is about -7.5% per year so it could be reasonable to say that pollution levels in the 60's are 50 times higher than they are today.
