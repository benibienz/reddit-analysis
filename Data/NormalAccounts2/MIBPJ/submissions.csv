Telesco might be on the extreme end of devaluing the safety position but the NFL as a whole seems to devalue the safety position.

**Telesco won't be drafting a safety in the first:** There is no way we get a safety in the first round. I'm almost certain that Telesco has stated that safety is a devalued position (although I can't find the direct quote). He let an all-pro safety walk and replaced him with a no name. Three of the four safeties on our roster weren't even drafted into the NFL. In Telesco's time as the director of scouting Colts they never grabbed a safety earlier than the 4th and in his final five years they didn't even draft a single safety period. He wasn't calling the shots and maybe it was just a GM call not to draft safeties, but in his four drafts with the Chargers he hasn't drafted a single safety. That means he hasn't been involved with drafting a safety in nearly a decade. Not one. He might draft one in 2017 but it ain't in the first.

**The NFL devalues safeties:** The Chargers are headed to be picking at least the top 16 and probably higher than that. The list of safeties that teams valued enough to spend a high draft pick on is probably shorter than most other positions. Here they are:

2007 1-16th overall safeties: LaRon Landry (6th)

2008 1-16th overall safeties: n/a (earliest was 31st overall)

2009 1-16th overall safeties: n/a (none in first round, earliest was 33rd overall)

2010 1-16th overall safeties: Eric Berry (5th), Earl Thomas (14th)

2011 1-16th overall safeties: n/a (none in the first round, earliest was Rahim ""Mile High Miracle"" Moore at 45th)

2012 1-16th overall safeties: Marc Barron (7th)

2013 1-16th overall safeties: Kenny Vaccaro (15th)

2014 1-16th overall safeties: n/a (earliest taken was Calvin Pryor at 18th overall)

2015 1-16th overall safeties: n/a (earliest was Demaryious Randall at 30th overall)

2016 1-16th overall safeties: Karl Joseph (14th)

This isn't just about being a DB. Over the past 10 years the first half of the first round includes 6 safeties and 19 cornerbacks. There are actually more RBs taken in this range of the draft than safeties even though this the go-to ""don't draft high"" position. I point all of this not to say ""Other teams are not doing it so neither should we"". Instead point this out to suggest that spending a high draft pick on a safety is probably a poor use of draft capital. If anything, trade back and pick up a safety or draft one in the second (or later). If the season were to end to day the Chargers would be drafting 8th overall which means that there second pick would be ~40th overall. There are draft were that could get you the third, second or even first safety off the board. 

I personally think that they should use high value draft pick on a high value position. Offensive line, defensive line or maybe linebacker. Keep on bolstering the defensive front, retain the elite CB group and it *almost* doesn't matter who you have at the safety position.",Chargers,Spoiler Alert: Tom Telesco won't be using a first round pick on a safety (nor should he),https://www.reddit.com/r/Chargers/comments/5dp7g1/spoiler_alert_tom_telesco_wont_be_using_a_first/

1) It was a small brisket, 2 lbs. It was really just a test brisket for the larger one that I am making for the house party. On the other hand, I will have to cut the larger one into smaller chunks to accomodate my equipment.

It gives analysis and projection for the 2016 season. Its pretty mathematical but also includes some qualitative analysis. 

They see a 37.2% chance of Chargers playing in the post season. Here's what the see as the probability of different ""season types"":

On the Clock (0-4): 8%

Mediocrity (5-7): 31%

Playoff Contender (8-10): 42%

Super Bowl Contender (11+): 20%

Super Bowl Odds: 4.6% 

Other highlights:

""Bosa, Attaochu, and Melvin Ingram have the potential to be one of the best pass-rushing trios in the
league. Ingram is closer to his peak than the other two after his first 10-sack season in 2015. If Attaochu continues to improve
on the other side and Bosa (with Brandon Mebane) offers a greater presence from the inside, Ingram’s job should only get
easier.""

""The Chargers have the makings of a very good pass defense
with the potential to be a capable run defense. They can
mitigate the impact of their run defense if the offense plays
to its potential and forces opponents into shootouts. ""

""Addae is a carryover piece whereas Lowery is a
proven, consistent veteran who has been brought in to replace Eric Weddle. Lowery isn’t as good as Weddle but the gap isn’t
as wide as their reputations would suggest.""

"" At the very least, Benjamin will perfectly complement
Allen and Stevie Johnson’s ability to work the short and intermediate
routes with Antonio Gates. Gates ~~is undoubtedly in
decline as he enters his 7,000th season as the Chargers starting
tight end. He~~ is still a reliable weapon for Rivers and he
won’t need to be relied upon as often with the emergence of
Allen and the addition of second-round tight end Hunter Henry
(Arkansas). Henry is a receiving tight end who should fit
perfectly as another possession-type receiver in the Chargers’
passing game.""

There is a whole bunch of interesting stuff in here about the teams tendencies and where they rank against the league. For example, Chargers are 2nd in the league in playing in shotgun formation and 32nd in play action. Surprisingly they're a bit above average in terms of going for it on 4th (although that might just be an artifact of McCoy's hand being forced by playing from behind).

The move to LA didn't play an integral part and was kind of in the background. The fact that they have a 1st overall pick QB competing for a starting job just doesn't seem to pop. The heroes all seem to think this is a mediocre (at best) season and I kind of agree. In light of that, what team should have been picked? Who would have made a more compelling season. Here is the list of Hard Knock eligible teams along with a few reason I think they could have been good:

Chargers: This is my homer pick but I would have loved to see the curtain pulled back on the whole Bosa situation. Also Rivers (and surprisingly Brandon Mebane) seem like big personalities. Plus, Mike McCoy has a hot butt.

Raiders: A team on the rise and a very young team. It could be interesting to see how they're dealing with the pressure of being the next hot team.

Jags: Essentially everything I said for the Raiders is also true for the Jags plus Gus Bradley has a hot butt this season.

Bills: Lot of turmoil and disappointments already in the preseason. Could be interesting to see how they roll with the punches. Any bit of annoyance created by Rex and Rob Ryan will get converted into comedy by the ire of Marc Sessler. Rex has perhaps the hottest but of them all.

Bears and Saints: No compelling stories to me. Maybe the issues going on between Sean Payton and the Saints' FO?

Ghosts of Cannae seemed to indicate that the elephants would almost immediately get scared during battle and start trampling Carthaginians and Romans alike making them tactically useless. Both sources seemed to agree that the elephants served a propaganda purpose as the Roman survivors would report facing an army of the biggest animals they ever had seen.

One one hand the Ghost of Cannae gives a more sober and less fanciful assessment of the situation that I am biased to agree with.

I want to have my view changed that our defense and not our offense is responsible for our woes this season. Every game I see people talking about the need to fire McCoy or Reich but Pagano and the defense have gotten relatively little heat. Here's my case that the defense is our problem. 

**Defense:** 31st in DVOA. So far the Chargers have allowed 198 points. Only 3 teams have allowed more: the Texans (199), the Lions (200), and the Jags (207). Chargers rank 31st in the league in terms of opponent yards/play and 27th in opponent points per game. The Chargers defense has allowed 24 points or more in each of its first seven contests this year. They’re only the third team in the past 25 years to do that. The defense also seems to have less injuries than the offense so has less of an excuse. Overall they've had a few good showings but they also let the Browns and Raiders drop 30 and 37 points on us in home games. 

**Offense:** 12th in DVOA. It has put up 165 points which among the top of the league (7th) and we have the most total yardage and yards per game. Play calling may be uninspired but its kind of getting the job done to a certain extent. I know that the offense is under performing for how many yards they get (1st in yards per game but 12 in points per game) but it seems like the worst you can say is that the offense is mediocre where as I don't see how you could call the defense anything but horrendous. Moreover, most of the key injuries (Gates, Johnson, Franklin, Dunlap) have been to the offense.

Also, I know this isn't proof or really evidence of anything, but I've noticed that when outsiders talk about how bad this team is playing they seem to talk more about how bad the defense is. Grantland podcast called the defense one of the 5 worst units in the NFL. The Around the NFL podcast also emphasized how bad the defense is when they forked us the other day.

Edit: Just to add to things here are Defensive and Offensive DVOA as far back as Pagano has been the coordinator. 

2015: Offense 12, Defense 31
2014: Offense 10, Defense 24
2013: Offense 3, Defense 32
2012: Offense 24, Defense 18

So 3/4 years the offense (lead by 3 different coordinators) has been better than the defense and the only year that the defense was better the offense and that had more to do with the offense tanking than the defense getting better. That means on average our offense outranks our defense by 14.",Chargers,"CMV: The defense, and not the offense, is responsible for the Chargers lack of success.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Chargers/comments/3qrrnj/cmv_the_defense_and_not_the_offense_is/

After about a month in the bucket I finally tried a sample and it was only slightly sour. Much less sour than I expected or wanted in a final product. But since its my first sour beer I'm not sure how sour I should expect it. I know that sour beers are supposed to age and develop for quite a while but as I understand it most of that time is conditioning and cleaning up the off products rather than producing the sourness and acidity? I am thinking of pitching some pure lacto into beer but I just wanted to see what more experienced sour brewers thought of this option and whether any intervention was necessary at all.,Homebrewing,Sour ale not very beer after a month and a half.
