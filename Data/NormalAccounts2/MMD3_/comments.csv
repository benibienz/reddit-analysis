&gt; Consider R* games with a avg. dev time of 5-6 years. I mean if you want your money back you can always try but IMHO they have NO obligation do give you your money. You pledged for a game that was never supposed to be finished within a couple of years.
&gt; 

I pledged for a game that was never supposed to be finished within a couple of years? then why did they initially ask for $500,000 and promise a finished Squadron 42 within 2 years? My main issue is that when I do check for updates I see all kinds of high production value advertisements and promo pieces that I don't give 2 fucks about, I just want a playable game and they are spending ridiculous amounts of money on marketing to bring in more backers.

I saw the show from seats once and I've seen plenty of videos of the songs so it doesn't bother me to miss the screen a bit but it is a huge part of the overall experience. If you get the side of the b-stage rather than the part closer to the catwalk you can see the screen alright and actually see the band members in it, but if you're right along the catwalk the angle of view is too extreme to see the band in the screen. I'm sure they'll be using the same screen when they bring the show back out on the road next fall after the new album is out but hopefully they will have changed up most of the visuals.

30,"The Roxy show was incredible luck really, the stars just aligned for it. The listed capacity for the Roxy is something like 460 so there weren't more than probably 500 people in the room. As far as I know there were 3 ways to get into that show. The most common way is you won them by calling into KROQ. I'm guessing 350-400 people won tickets that way, they claimed you had to be a California resident however which I was not but it didn't stop me from calling probably 300x over the several days I was in LA leading up to that show. The second way to get tickets was, you were a celebrity with a good agent who knew the right strings to pull. A few of the celebrities I saw in the audience were Sean Penn, Aaron Paul, Courtney Love, Judd Apatow, Colin Farrell, Jimmy Iovine, etc. So that was one way to get in. I managed to get in through a random drawing of 4 people (8 counting +1's) through the band's official fan forum. How I was picked out of all the people who commented when they announced they had a few to give away I have no idea. People were offering $3000 for tickets on Craigslist. 

I have met the band on a few occasions, but just as a fan waiting for an autograph, never more than that. They are extremely gracious though and every big U2 fan who has followed them at all has stories to share about awesome things they've done for their fans.

Some of the shots in this set are from a surprise appearance in NYC by Adam and Edge at a 20 year anniversary party for one of their biggest fan sites, atu2.com I happened to be lucky enough to have been asked by the atu2 staff to come shoot the party so it was just another right place at the right time moment. It was certainly a big highlight of the year seeing them just drop in for a couple of songs with cover-band Bono &amp; Larry.",2015-12-05 03:56:32+00:00,cxnqpyg,2.0,t1_cxnpwnf,1719.0,photography
31,"Yeah, there's just sooo much stuff. I can edit it down in multiple directions depending on what I end up deciding the format for presentation is. This is from 20 shows plus all of the before and after fan stuff. So I probably have 20-30 selects from each show. In some cases pruning down to 5 shots for a show just isn't enough to tell the narrative from that show.

Here's an example where it might make more sense:
http://www.justin-kent.com/u2-chicago3/

This particular show took place the day after the supreme court marriage equality ruling took place and the same day as the Pride parade in Chicago. The guy in the red sleeveless tee is a long-time U2 fan &amp; gay man who brought his rainbow flag with him to the show. He helped run the general admission line that day (overwhelmingly full of joy) and so most of the people on the floor that night had probably come in contact with him at some point that day. In the middle of Pride he ran from the B stage down the catwalk to throw his flag on stage, I followed him expecting something good would probably happen and managed to catch the moment. It was probably the best performance of the song on the whole tour. You can see how it played out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbwPJIjoTtI#t=2m10s

I appreciate the offer, will certainly keep it in mind when I get to that point. Really I just need to figure out how I want to present it. A book would probably be logical at some point but I think I want to get set up to sell some individual prints first and then maybe build towards a book.",2015-12-05 03:37:13+00:00,cxnq6ef,2.0,t1_cxnpipx,1357.0,photography
32,"I mean if you have a system that you appreciate then by all means...  These were the benefits to me. I was still shooting with a 5dmkII and was waiting to jump to a 5dmkIV. When Canon announced the 5Ds w/ it's specs I was very unimpressed. It was a clear signal to me that Canon was falling behind Sony &amp; Fuji and not really listening to what their users wanted out of a camera. 

The 5Ds while a solid camera didn't make any significant improvements over the 5DIII unless you were really looking for higher resolution files. I don't shoot any studio work really and can't remember the last time a client asked me for a specific image resolution (I've never heard ""it needs to be at least 5,000px on the long side"" from a client). 50MP raw files to me really just meant a slower workflow. It took me a while to get over the idea of dropping from 24MP (5dmkii) to 16MP (x100t and xt1) but after making some 16x24 prints from the files the x100t output and finding them to surpass my expectations I was able to swallow that one. 

The next thing that happened was I bought the x100t and shot with it as a carry-around camera for more every day stuff. I just put a lens hood on it, lost the lens cap, and treated it like a rangefinder. It was AWESOME. I rediscovered the joy of photography and didn't dread lugging my DSLR around. I shot a friend's wedding as a favor and took my x100t along with the 5DMkII (mostly using a 16-35mm f/2.8). Not only did I find myself wanting to go back to the x100t more often than not for how easy it was to snap candids but I also preferred the output when I went to edit. The out of camera jpeg's that you can get with Fuji's built-in profiles are beautiful, I played with all of them for a while before deciding I prefer the standard ""provia"" look for it's punchier tones. I began shooting jpeg+raw and using the wifi to send jpegs over to my phone to email to friends or post to instagram on the fly, instant gratification. When I import my raw files into lightroom I use a preset that applies the Fuji profile that I was shooting with to the raws so it saves me the step having to find the vsco profile I want to apply or do a lot of tweaking to colors.

So to summarize... what I'm appreciating about the Fuji X series so far is... it's more compact, it's lower cost (I could buy 2 xt1's for the price of a single a7rii), the glass (at least what I've shot so far) is top tier quality and less expensive than Canon or Sony glass, and really it's just a joy to shoot with. I love the dial layout on the camera, I love having an exposure compensation dial at my fingertips as well as ISO &amp; shutter speed dials. I love the EVF for getting an accurate sense of exposure in low light situations. I love that when I'm shooting with the x100t people aren't intimidated by it and I am constantly being asked if I'm shooting film.

I bought into a platform because I appreciate everything about Fuji's approach to making cameras and it's clear that they are listening to their users with frequent firmware updates to add useful functionality. In my opinion Canon &amp; Nikon aren't hungry enough so they aren't innovating fast enough and Sony is too arrogant to think they don't need to listen to user feedback in designing their user experience. I bought the XT1 knowing that the XT2 is probably not more than a year or so away and I could buy both an XT1 &amp; XT2 for around the same price as an a7rII. Sony also still doesn't have a 24-70 f/2.8 equivalent and that's sort of the most important all-purpose lens in my opinion. Fuji's lenses lineup is already really solid and lens-for-lens they're roughly 70% the cost of equivalent quality Zeiss or Canon L glass.

At any rate, that's my pitch. Maybe I'll kick myself when Canon announces a 5DmkIII, but the 5DS just wasn't built with the event photographer in mind. I don't need 50MP, I need low light sensitivity. The closest thing to what I would want out of a camera spec-wise is an A7S but Sony clearly designed that for videographers (12MP is a little too low of resolution, sorry). 50MP raw files would slow my workflow down significantly and I'm frequently being asked to quick-turn images overnight.

Hope this helps. It's certainly a conversation that interests me. It took me a LONG time to convince myself to ditch Canon.",2015-12-05 03:26:17+00:00,cxnpuxz,2.0,t1_cxnok86,2670.0,photography

It does mean I retain all ownership of my photos for now though. I'm of the opinion that booking a tour like that is all about who you know and being in the right place at the right time. I could be wrong, but it's pretty difficult to line something like that up. 

I've tested the x100t out in low light and it performs very admirably. The lenses are quick and the leaf shutter allows for some impressively slow hand-held shots assuming the subject is stationary. Haven't put the xt1 + 23mm f/1.4 through the paces enough just yet, will have to keep using it for a while longer but so far so good.",2015-12-05 03:04:31+00:00,cxnp88s,2.0,t1_cxnnqly,2997.0,photography
