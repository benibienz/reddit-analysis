I just finished organizing my photos from the Innocence &amp; Experience tour. I ended up seeing 20 shows counting the Roxy and the Atu2 party (okay so maybe that doesn't count as a full show). Full galleries of all the shows are up on my site. Feel free to AMA about GA life or tour experiences. I'm super glad I did it, I met some wonderful people and made some unforgettable memories.

4,2016-01-03 19:42:41+00:00,self.starcitizen,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/3zb4iv/refund_denied/,False,"I politely submitted a refund request, I honestly haven't been actively following developments for a while but got sick of waiting for any sort of game as described in the campaign to materialize so I emailed RSI asking for a refund for the $140 I pledged for a hornet back in October of 2013.

This is the response I received:

Hi there,

We have reviewed your account status and regret that we are not able to accommodate your request for a refund since it was received outside of the statutory 14 day period.

Your pledge was made as part of the crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for the development of “Star Citizen.” As such you were aware that the funds would be actively applied after receipt for this purpose, not idly maintained in a bank account, and therefore could not be subject to a refund once used. As you may know from the extensive information on our website Robertsspaceindustries.com, Cloud Imperium Games has been working diligently over the past 3 years on the development of the game, and now employs over 270 staff in four studios. 2,538 reports, updates and web shows have been made available during this time, and first modules with limited gameplay were offered as early as in fall of 2013 – by now hundreds of thousands of gameplay hours have been played on our servers. The development of the game is proceeding steadily, and a substantial part of the promised game offering dozens of gameplay hours has been made available to the backers in early release versions (see further detail below).

Pursuant to the terms of your agreement (see Sec. 4 of the Commercial Terms, and Sec. IV.A of the subsequent Terms of Service, as applicable, https://robertsspaceindustries.com/tos), your payment was a deposit to be used for the “Game Cost” (as defined therein), and such deposit has since been “earned by CIG and become non-refundable to the extent that it is used for the Game Cost...” You further agreed to “irrevocably waive any claim for refund of any deposit amount that has been used for the Game Cost and Pledge Item Cost in accordance with the above.” The only exception would be a return of unearned funds remaining in case of an abandonment of the project. If you pledged on Kickstarter, you agreed to these terms when you transferred your pledge account to robertsspaceindustries.com.

These terms are consistent with the specific nature of crowdfunding and the foreseeable use of your pledge – we hope you appreciate that we cannot ask our hard working personnel to return some of their salary nor that it would be appropriate to use current backers’ funds provided for game development as a refund for an earlier and committed pledge.

While a substantive part of the promised gameplay is now available, we acknowledge that delivery of some game elements has been delayed due to expansion of Star Citizen’s scope. This expansion is a result of the community’s declared desire to have the initial release version of the game developed to a much greater depth than contemplated originally upon start of the campaign. It is inherent to the nature of crowdfunding that such an adjustment to the project may occur. Ultimately, this will benefit all backers including yourself, since every backer will be receiving a much greater value for his/her pledge, but it may – as in this case – cause an extension of the delivery dates.

We acknowledge that some individual backers may find the additional wait undesirable. However, as per Sec. VII of the ToS, you did “acknowledge and agree that delivery as of such date is not a promise by RSI since unforeseen events may extend the development and/or production time.”

We’d like to point you to the significant gameplay which is now available; https://robertsspaceindustries.com/feature-list and if you haven't already, we encourage you to download the installer from this url: https://robertsspaceindustries.com/download and patch up to play the latest version of the game.

Star Citizen is a project for gamers, by gamers. Delays and changes are always unfortunate, but in our case they are also one of the reasons the project is so special. By financing the project using crowd funding, our team is not beholden to a publisher who would insist we ship a game unfinished or broken to meet a particular date. Thanks to continued backing of our community, we have the needed creative freedom over the project, to create a unique game, and we feel the results, such as unparalleled immersion and fidelity, are already speaking for themselves!

We sincerely hope you enjoy the updates both current and future in the Star Citizen 'Verse.

Thank you.

Last year I lost my job and split with my longtime partner in the same month. 

Seeing as tickets for my favorite band's tour went on sale right around the same time I received my severance and I had plenty of money in savings I did the only rational thing and spent the last half a year doing something that made me happy. 

I'm a professional photographer and it's been a dream since I first started shooting concerts with film back in 2001 to eventually shoot a U2 tour. I went and did it and it was a hell of a lot of fun. 

I'm still working out what I'll do with all of the photos, this is a fraction of my total selects. As a whole there are many narratives running through them following my friends &amp; fellow fans.

A vast majority of these were shot with only a Fuji x100t (fixed 35mm f/2) with the last batch of shots in Ireland shot on with a Fuji xt1 with a 16-55mm f/2.8. It was a really fun challenge doing what I could with just the x100t. So far I have no regrets ditching all of Canon gear for Fuji.
