0,"I attended the Daymond John Academy a couple of years ago.  I agree that the intro seminar was a hard-sell but I did signup for and attend the three-day event. It was $1,500 when I attended.

The three-day event was okay.  The vast bulk of it was delivered by people who work for or are associated with Daymond. Nate Holzapfel from Mission Belt Co attended and spoke.  He and the other advisers were also available for questions throughout the weekend. 

Most of what was presented was basic stuff I already knew.  That said, there were some interesting snippets, for example on investing in tax liens.  I also got the opportunity to practice my pitch and have my idea scrutinized by one of Daymond's partners.  (He said he wanted to present it to Daymond and would I be interested but nothing ever came of that).

At the end of the weekend, there was a sales push to sign up for mentoring in the order of tens of thousands of dollars.  I couldn't afford that and to be honest, I'm not sure it was worth it.

Did I feel my $1,500 (plus travel and hotel) was worth it? Not really.",2015-12-21 22:27:33+00:00,cy736af,1,t3_3xr3oa,3707,Entrepreneur

14,"You don't sound like an asshole at all - at least to to Aspies and people who know what that entails.  You sound very normal to me.

Okay, so everyone's different but typically, Aspies are hard-working - given the right work and the right environment.  We have certain traits and skills that are extremely valuable in the modern workplace **if** we're matched to the right role.  Jobs around things like computer science, accounting, engineering can all be beneficial.

Without knowing your skillset and interests, it's hard to be specific but here's what I have learned from 30 years of working as an Aspie.

I can't work in an office.  I don't *do* people and people sure as hell don't do me.  My greatest work pleasure has been in outside (largely solitary) jobs or working from home.  Given the choice I would prefer to be working outdoors but that's not always easy due to physical limitations.  So I work from home.

I have a telecommuting role and a boss who luckily for me understands what it means to be an Aspie.  When I started working for the company I gave him a 'user manual' to help him understand how Asperger's affects me personally.  All in all, we've got along really well.  Occasionally, my Asperger's will flow through and a misunderstanding will happen but we usually manage to laugh it off once it's corrected.

At the end of the day, it all comes down to your skills, your Aspie talents and how much training or retraining you want (and can afford) to do.  Doing freelance or telecommuting work means you can do what you're strongest at without too much interaction.  It does have it's downside in that you need to be very disciplined and also, for freelancing, work can be sporadic until you build a strong client base.",2015-12-14 16:33:57+00:00,cxys2wt,1,t3_3wqv8b,41003,aspergers

For tried and tested, an internet search for the product should bring up the manufacturer and distributor.  You can then send a well-crafted email to try and gain interest.

For new to market, why not scour the crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo? A message sent through the system should reach them.  A donation might get even more attention.

22,"First of all, congrats on getting to market - not everyone who starts the journey gets that far.

As to your question, it would depend on many factors, including what the person will do (2 x SM post and 3 x blog posts isn't a huge amount of work), how much value they bring and whether you can work with them long-term. Remember that if they have equity it could turn into a huge pain in the posterior if things go sour.

There are some individuals and companies that work solely for equity but they have to be totally convinced that the company and product are going to be a success.  The downside in your situation is that many of the ones worth engaging won't get out of bed for less than 10%.

In order to get quality, I would recommend expanding what you're going to have them do and offering a little more equity in return - not quite ""co-founder"" status but close.  That should get you an all-round marketing professional rather than an intern-level person.

Feel free to hit me up if you want to discuss it further.",2015-12-10 17:51:36+00:00,cxub6vo,1,t3_3w7uma,18202,startups
