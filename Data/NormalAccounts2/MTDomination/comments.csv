-If someone spams pick ND roll long enough it will eventually trigger help defense. With defensive settings this could be fixed.


- Offensive Settings, there are only two ways to score when playing Blacktop, Pick &amp; Roll or ISO. More offensive options would benefit this mode greatly.


- Too many Contested Shots are made in this game mode. Definitely needs a tone down.


-Technical Fouls are completely useless and unnecessary. Who ever at 2k HQ thought to them selves this would be a good Idea needs to be fired.

16,"Being honest, 2K really improved alot this year.

Gameplay fells way better than last year.

 MyTeam rewards are probably the biggest improvement out of everything.

 MyCareer is definitely better than last year with the new connections/endorsement system. Also the badges and archetype system was a great improvement from last year.



---One of my biggest problems with the game this year is the Bugs/Glitches, Servers are still trash, MyPark didn't change and is more cheesier than ever, also everything increased in price.  

Honestly if I knew how many Bugs and glitches were in this game at launch I wouldn't have pre-ordered it. I couldn't play MyPark for like 3 or 4 weeks because of the ""Shot Meter Glitch"". Also wasn't able to use my ""Slasher"" archetype for another 3 or 4 weeks because ""Relentless Finisher"" was broken. The connections were broken for about  3 or 4 weeks so you weren't earning any of the ""extra VC"" you were suppose to be earning.

Tips:

-Avoid corners unless you're going to shoot from the white dash line.

-Try and shoot a couple steps away from the middle, directly facing the basketball goal.

-Sim to next season just in case you messed up your long range FG%.

- Just keep shooting, any long range three you make could be the last one needed to unlock the badge.",2016-09-25 03:47:03+00:00,d80xxtm,1,t3_54diyb,1184,NBA2k

Draymond Green isn't a All-Star. If you take him off the Warriors he is just a little above a average NBA player. Also if Klay wasn't such a great defender. I wouldn't call him a All-star, his shooting is inconsistent a'f. One night he can go 7-10 from three and another night go 2-10.

What i'm trying to say is that It's more of a mental thing, when Curry goes on a shooting spree, everyone on the opposing team panics.

Example 2: Warriors and Cavs tied, looks like it's going to be a good ball game. But Curry comes Alive hit's consecutive threes Klay starts hitting threes and Warriors are up by like 10 or 15 in a couple of minutes. Nobody on Cavs wanted to respond.....every time they were passed the ball they looked to give it right back to Lebron, who was getting doubled or even triple teamed every time  he would drive.

Such as, when you are playing defense and stand directly in front of the person you are defending, his teammate  passes the ball to him and instead of letting me take it, the ball just goes straight threw me......Literally. 




Or when you are take a shot get a green release and hit. But then take the same shot, release it at the exact same point you released it at when you got the green light. But instead of getting a green, the meter lands directly on the white line (When this happens I already know for sure I am going to miss it), and you miss the shot........................................................................................



That is what I mean by ""ALGO"", the CALCULATIONS that decide when you get a steal, make a shot, get a rebound, draw a foul etc. IMO this should be up to the player, not the CPU.

417,"Exactly, I think the max for a card should be at the most around 300k to 500k. Anything higher than that and you will probably never get that card before 2K17 comes out unless you spend real money and buy packs. 


IMO, You should be able to make at least more than 10,000 MT from a one regular game because getting only around 900 ( 1,000 if lucky)  from a game which took around 40 minutes to beat is such a let down. I barley even play challenges anymore because it takes so much time away from my day for rewards which aren't worth it. The Gauntlet is my favorite part of myteam because it doesn't last that long and it is fun to relax and throw half court lobs and take deep threes......but 200 Mt is useless in this game unless you are just starting out. MT is to scarce  for them to allow people to put up auctions for more than a 600k.

""OP was 'running up the the 3pt line' every possession too 🙄""

I worded that wrong what I meant was I was dribbling to the top of the three point line to call plays and call for screens, and I would bump into the person that was guarding me and I would drop the ball. I wasn't running to the three point line to shoot. 

""Also, OP, I bet you all of your players were running on less than 80 stamina.""

I know how to call time outs and put in subs. I have my minutes spreed out evenly so I don't have to put in subs manually.

""But I'm sure since you were too busy trying to cheese your way out of a slump with Kyle Korver threes that those things don't matter to you lol""

I ran plays to get Kyle Korver open for a 3 it wasn't like I was just running to the three point line and just throwing it up with him.",2016-04-22 18:41:52+00:00,d2ddy3x,3,t1_d2d2xjr,14971,NBA2k

""There is a lot of bs in this game but scoring 0 in the 4th is your fault man. If your shots arent hitting you have to try something new. Get some points inside instead, run some PnR's, do cuts, drive, post up etc. Be careful with your passes and hold L2 to protect the ball. And you shouldnt miss many wide open shots, maybe they were semi contested which made you miss?""



Nice tip never knew about hitting L2 to protect the ball. It's just this had never happened to me before. I had never lost a game in Rttp till this one and I only needed one more game to get to seed 4.

But every time I inbound the ball I would run up to the three point line and I would just lose the ball like the ball would literally just fall out of my hand when he bumped into me, this happened so many times back to back I almost quit the game. So I started cheesing the 91 Fist play and would get Kyle Korver wide open for a corner three and he would miss every time even tho I would release right on the white line. This is the only game I've played were I feel like 2K robbed me out of my win.

Also the only way he would score is when I would loose the ball or miss a wide open shot. I held him on defense when it was his possession .         ",2016-04-22 09:51:09+00:00,d2cvg3l,2,t1_d2cux6n,2097,NBA2k
