MYPark- MYPark is my favorite game mode in NBA 2K16 but the reward you get after a MYPark game is pretty trash. 200 VC? Atleast like 700 VC - 500 VC would be great. I know that you don't want to give us the same amount of VC we get for playing a whole game. But 200 VC isn't that much of a reward, especially if you are upgrading a player from scratch.


MyTeam-  MyTeam this year (IMO) was the worst yet (content wise). There was only one challenge that had a reward worth grinding for, and that was the diamond Kareem challenge. Most of the reward cards they were going to realease didn't even get released, they just put them in a pack for you to buy. RTTP was broken for me because of the arbitration error bullshit, and it got to the point were it wasn't fun anymore but just aggrevating. 


GAUNTLET was the best thing about MyTeam, and was a new and fresh way to earn MT and Rewards. But 2K just decided to say ""Fuck the promises we made about NEW gauntlet boards, lets just make them open more packs."" 


DYNAMIC CARDS were updated reguarly at the beginning of the season but towards the end its like they were to lazy to update them. All they had to do was look at the stats and type in a number, which would take them like 3 or 4 weeks to do.


FINALLY MT POINTS there was no legitimate way to earn alot of MT this year. Challenges only last like a a couple weeks but after that there was no other way to earn more than 2,000 MT (unless you count flipping cards on the auction or buying packs, in which I don't). So how am I suppose to earn the 750,000  that 2K expects me to have  to buy Steve Nash from the black market?

I actually thought the team I was rooting for, OKC, was going to take the Warriors out. But when Curry and Thompson came out hitting everything...........It caused Westbrook to try and go at Curry, and fail......And it caused KD to play hero ball, he stopped passing.

I have finished both historic domination and regular domination, finished the 10,000 and 5,000 board in the gauntlet, did all the challenges except for the weekly challenges and I still only made around 500k Mt off of all of those things which took me around a month to finish. But 2K just expects you to make 750k MT from just playing the game regularly ?..... 




The only other way I could see making that much MT would be  getting lucky opening packs, which in that case you would have to get a diamond multiple times to make 750k. 



Is 2K aware that it is close to impossible to earn 750k MT playing Myteam regularly ?
