1,"1. so if youre going lane to lane, with no enemy heroes, your hero damage would be low anyway.... proves my point, thank you  
2. like i said, if you make consistent bad plays, it shows on the leaderboard.  
3. it should still show in the leaderboard  
i know this is a bit complicated for you to understand so may you shouldnt contribute to the topic. stick to silver hero league plz",2016-11-16 21:28:55+00:00,da3axqk,4.0,t1_da2mbuo,34122.0,heroesofthestorm
2,"1. you could make an algorithm that figures that out by calculating how much of the damage that hero did to a particular hero vs how much damage the rest of the team did to each hero. if 1 person does a vast amount more damage to 1 player than anybody else, then obviously he was just sitting in 1 lane and not contributing to team fights.  
2. first of all tanks would have to be calculated based on damage taken per death ratio. bad plays are a part of a game and while occasionally a bad play results in a loss, it usually takes mutliple bad plays for it to result in a loss and that usually is reflected in the stats.  
3. for this you would have to make an algorithm that calculates how much healing li li usually does (hotslogs already has a section on this) and then calculate how many times their teammates died. if li li has lower than average healing and her teammates died a lot then it's most likely because there werent enough heals.  
  
i know it would be complicated but it would add a lot of enjoyment to the game as opposed to some new additions would. after all making a game is complicated in itself",2016-11-16 11:38:07+00:00,da2lwb5,2.0,t1_da2lqtz,516.0,heroesofthestorm

28,"The 2012 olympics got me into weightlifting because of Behdad Salimi among others. i watched all the men's olympic lifting matches this year and recorded the 94kg one but unfortunately didnt record this one because my hard drive was running out of space, otherwise id make a video pointing out what i saw, but ill try to explain.  
  
to me it was a very obvious scheme by the olympic comittee. They pulled the same shit in 2012 in a wrestling match, I forget who the Iranian was, but they gave his competitor negative points for no competitive reason, more of a political reason it seemed like. (i remmeber the ref was french, if anyone wants to find this match)  
  
Don't get me wrong, the Georgian lifter was very good and the crowd were very assholeish for booing but i still think the olympic comittee is totally corrupt.  
  
The georgian lifter's 3rd lift was as good (if not worse) than salimi's first lift, yet he got 3 white lights and salimi got 2 red lights. also on his 2nd attempt i think they purposely made him keep the clean and jerk in the air and delayed the lights so that they could spread the blame between the judges AND jury, and also to make him too tired to even be able to attempt his 3rd attempt, which is exactly what ended up happening.  
  
i dont think the georgian team was in on this, i just think the olympic comittee was staunch on preventing iran's success. they even tried to get rid of olympic lifting and wrestling after 2012 because russia and iran did so well and america did so shit (its true, go look it up), but too many people were against it for them to do it without seeming obvious.  
  
maybe salimi would've got silver, maybe he would've got gold, who knows. he did have surgery and had issues, but he also broke a world record and did better than the georgian for snatch. the point is that nobody can know for sure, and for that the whole competition is trashed because now we dont know who actually would've won because of the corrupt officials.  
  
either way, they both did a good job. i dont think iranians should blame georgians or the georgian team for this. the georgian lifter did get caught doping, but we dont know the extent of which any of these lifters dope, and they most definitely all take steroids to some extent. just very disappointing that the world's biggest sport event has become a shit show. i was so excited for this year's olympics but now i dont give a shit about the olympics anymore.    
  
and btw they did the same shit in the group B with the syrian lifter, but the israeli lifter did just as shitty of a lift as the syrian, yet the syrian got 2 red lights and the israeli got 3 white lights. i didnt care about that because the israeli was weak as shit anyway, but just saying.

47,"Sanskrit and Avestan[edit]
The English word ""Aryan"" is borrowed from the Sanskrit word ārya,[8] आर्य, meaning ""noble"" or ""noble one"".[5][7][15] (However, as a translation of Latin Arianus, 'Aryan' has ""long been in English language use"".[5])

In early Vedic literature, the term Āryāvarta (Sanskrit: आर्यावर्त, abode of the Aryans) was the name given to northern India, where the Indo-Aryan culture was based. The Manusmṛti (2.22) gives the name Āryāvarta to ""the tract between the Himalaya and the Vindhya ranges, from the Eastern (Bay of Bengal) to the Western Sea (Arabian Sea)"".[2][16]

Initially the term was used as a national name to designate those who worshipped the Vedic deities (especially Indra) and followed Vedic culture (e.g. performance of sacrifice, Yajna).[5][17]

Proto-Indo-Iranian[edit]
The Sanskrit term comes from proto-Indo-Iranian *arya-[8][note 1] [18][19] or *aryo-,[20][note 2] the name used by the Indo-Iranians to designate themselves.[21][8][note 3][20] The Zend airya 'venerable' and Old Persian ariya are also derivates of *aryo-,[20] and are also self-designations.[5][22][note 4]

In Iranian languages, the original self-identifier lives on in ethnic names like ""Alans"" and ""Iron"".[24] Similarly, the name of Iran is the Persian word for land/place of the Aryans.

61,"first of all, just gonna say i play both. i spend half the day playing pokemon go solely, and while i do other stuff i play summoners war.   
i havnt noticed lots of ppl leaving. this sub still has the same amount of active users, and my in-game channel hasnt changed at all.  
i think some people are temporarily switching cuz pokemon go has a lot of hype, but look at it realistically.  
summoners war is a passive grind game. you play it while you do anything else, and the only thing you rly manual is pvp or toa(h). its pretty annoying to play summoners war while out because you cant touch it, have to keep it on, and tap something every 1-3 minutes.  
meanwhile pokemon go is a game you cant play at home, you need to play while on the go, and you cant do anything besides pokemon go when you play pokemon go.  
doesnt really compete with each other.  
another thing is that i was a long time pokemon player. i know more about pokemon that i probably should. this game is really cool with collecting, but they fucked up many things, and i think its gonna lead to it's quick downfall once the hype is over and people get bored. ill explain why:  
1) the battling system absolutely sucks. dont think anyone denies this, even hardcore fans. you spam tap your screen for battling and you only have 1 ability, and cant even battle your friends. there is no competitiveness or strategy involved whatsoever, aside from picking which pokemon you want in battle. the 2nd ability that pokemon have isnt even useful because its not worth it to use, and there are only 2 abilities per pokemon.  
2) rare pokemon dont feel like rare pokemon. you dont have a rare pokemon that you feel happy about simply catching, because you'll need to catch a lot more of it in order to make it good. this kills the feeling for me tbh  
3) your pokemon dont get better by battling, they get better by catching more pokemon like it. you really lose the feel that your pokemon is bad ass  
4) you dont hunt down pokemon, you just go loops for poke stops and then hope you find a rare pokemon. a lot of the fun of the original pokemon games was to hunt down rare pokemon.  
5) you dont catch pokemon in the wild or while hiking or something, you catch them while in populated areas like parks, downtowns, etc. they should've made it so that the populated areas had lots of pokestops, but unpopulated areas had more and rarer pokemon.  
6) you cant trade pokemon.  
7) idk how theyre gonna do legendaries, but currently the way to improve your pokemon is to get candies which you get from capturing or hatching those pokemon or their greater or lesser forms. you can only get 1 legendary and they're going to be events. are they going to make it where legendaries will suck cuz they cant get improved? cuz that would be lame. or are they going to make legendaries strong by default? which would be stupid because whats the point in even building pokemon that are the same type?  
pokemon go has a lot of problems. they can fix some of it by updating certain things, but other things simply cant be fixed without reworking the game in general which i dont think they will do.  
for the time being collecting pokemon from the real world is amazing and i have a lot of fun doing it, but it really cant take summoners war away from me, because summoners war makes everything i do more fun and doesnt really get in the way of anything, and im not sure if pokemon go has a future.  
edit: some more....
8) pokemon go requires you to walk around to min/max. you can check your phone every few min, but you're just gonna find 1 pokemon and usually it's gonna be trash tier. eventually i think people are gonna become lazy again when the hype dies down and not care anymore. maybe if it was competitive people would push themselves to not fall behind, but like i said in another point, literally no competition.  
9) pokemon go has a lot of bugs, lots of instability, and lots of hackers. people are gonna get fed up with this shit if something isnt done about it. gps hackers are easily getting way ahead of people and if there ends up being any legitimate competition they're the ones that will get ahead. the bugs and instability is already pissing lots of people off due to losing rare pokemon and not being able to play while the boosts are up (boosts are 30 min long, so even 5 min of server downtime is a big deal if you're f2p). once the hype dies down people are gonna really start getting pissed off about all these problems.

121,"those don't make up 5% of the population of all players. you obviously have never gotten anywhere on any of these servers. literally every top guild has multiple ppl running bots 24/7. just play on lordareon for a while and see how many bots get bans every time. these bots get banned for 10 or 30 days, and yet they ban dozens everyday.  
there are also many players who dont ever talk in global or communicate with each other. thats because they live in foreign countries where they cant communicate to anyone besides people they know irl. i have met people in iran, russia, and china like this. if they can speak english they can only speak a little and still only group with people that they know, so you'll never hear from them or talk to them.  
it's funny that you think this so far only constitutes 5% of the population. i'd say it constitutes 30-40% of the population of each server minimum.  
and lastly, as an american player, there are only 2-3 guilds on each server that are american either way, so i cant even raid if i dont go on a big server.  
after all this, you can compare the global chat on lordareon to kronos for example (havnt played on dalaran, but dalaran has the same pop as kronos roughly, and i played on kronos), and the difference is night and day. you cant even find groups on kronos for 5 mans, and on lordareon there are usually multiple groups for heroic dailies, heroics in general, low level dungeons, capped normals, each.

it doesnt matter that you can kill camillas. if you couldnt kill camillas pretty sure a ton of people would just simply quit. ti's the fact that it's so unbelivably unbalanced and overpowered compared to any other monster on AD, and the fact that she takes so long which is a problem in this game with rush hour. just imagine how many people avoid camillas and therefore allow you to passively stay higher rank.

all top players agree that seara is just a better version of pungbaek, so not sure how you're gonna argue against that. its pretty obvious that he is...  
teshar is not really that squishy compared to pung. he only has 3k less hp and slightly less def than pungbaek's 10k-11k base hp. both can survive dungeons pretty easily and both will get destroyed by a wombo. the problem isn't their base stats, but their kit overall. teshar has no wasted skills and it has a consistent aoe. that's what makes teshar much better.  
so you're suggesting that mons design considerations should be based around this bullshit rina/camilla meta? that's laughable. his 2nd skill isn't even a counter to rina/camilla becuz his 1st skill will still do more damage even if his 2nd skill ignores their passives, and the buff block doesnt do anything if you can just kill rina or camilla in 2 turns anyway with basic attack. so moot point there.

pungbaek's basically an exclusive single target nuker with a chance to aoe. his basic attack sleep chance is so abysmally low that every time i see it happen, im kind of surprised.  
he's definitely not a support, but this is the problem with pungbaek, he's confused about whether or not he's a support or nuker, due to the fact that the devs refuse to give him a unique 2nd skill affect from the other pioneers (even though 2 of them have different ones completely). his 2nd skill is typical of a support mon, but it cant crit, so it's counter-productive to his lead bonus, awakening bonus, and 3rd skill which is just a nuke.   
it's funny because chiwu who is almost always runed as a support has the exact same base stats, typing, scaling, 1st skill, and 2nd skill as pungbaek, the only difference is that pungbaek has a single target nuke associated with his 3rd skill whereas chiwu has a buff strip, and evne then chiwu is runed as a support. kind of goes to show how terrible pung is if even a better version of him is runed as support instead of dmg.

183,"Add pungbaek to the list of mons that need tweaks to be good.  
First of all, a mon that is good should have one specific use that it's good for, or atleast competitive with other options. For example, pungbaek and seara are both wind nukers. If a mon doesnt have a very clear use, it'll never be good, like so many nat 2s, 3s, and even 4s.  
Second, a mon needs to be able to not work against himself. This is pungbaek's biggest problem because his lead and awakened bonus are both crit, but his 2nd skill cant even crit. Im sure there are other cases like it. Also, Pung's entire kit is based around his 3rd skill which will not always AoE. ......   
Third, it needs to have good AI. This is the biggest problem with Emma vs Bella. Emma has a way better heal, and way more utility, but the AI is so terrible with the heal that Emma will just heal even when nobody has taken any damage Lots of other cases like this as well.  
Finally, going back to my first point, a truly good mon will have more than 1 purpose so that you dont feel like  you're wasting your runes if you put your best runes on him. Even mons that are amazing are sometimes neglected as being considered good because theyre good in only a few situations (Example being Emma). Take Seara as an example. She is amazing as a farmer, GB10 speed teams, AO, GWO, some AD/GWD, and Raids, and maybe even Necro. You would not think twice about putting your best runes on her. Now compare to Pungbaek. Pungbaek is only really good in GB10 if you have Lushen or some other AoEr to weaken everyone first in addition to needing Galleon and also his casting animations are so slow that it's not really a good idea to bring him if you have better options; he's terrible for farming because he needs good runes to do aiden hell and even then his skill animations are so long that it's not worth it, so you might as well just bring a better mon to farm something else; he's an alright AO/GWO, but if you dont kill something with his 3rd skill it's basically a lose becuase his 2nd skill is so useless; and he's not used in raids or necro like seara is.   
The reason I compare Pungbaek to Seara so much is that they both have a single target nuke associated to their AoE but Seara is so much better than Pung. They both fit pretty much the same roles, but Seara is just so much better. Pungbaek is still underpowered compared to Teshar, Lagmaron, and even Amir.
