This also happened last olympics in wrestling in 1 match which made Iran lose a gold medal in wrestling.  
This was salimi's last olympics im pretty sure (rezazadeh retired at 26 too), and now Georgia stole Iran's crowning streak for the world record and gold medals since 2000 over bullshit.  
For those who didn't watch it, the difference in quality between the Gerogian lifter and Salimi was nothing. In fact on the first attempt Salimi lifted better than the Georgian lifter on his 3rd attempt, yet the Georgian lifter got no red lights.

right now, auto-select gives no benefits. bonus exp means nothing when you get placed with a hero that you already have leveled and play frequently enough where you're past 9 and don't care about leveling it up even further. on top of that there's no account-wide exp past level 40.  
  
to me it doesn't really make a difference if i don't know what to play, but when i actually want to have some fun, maybe have a little surprise and pick auto-select for a bonus reward, i won't be inclined to play auto-select just for the hell of it, and the same goes for a lot of other people.  
  
having a bonus of gold isn't really that appealing either.  
  
my suggestion is to revamp the auto-select to be it's own little thing. create a game mode on the current 1 lane map where everyone has to go with auto-select. on top of that, make auto-select it's own level with cool perks, like portrait and gold like a normal hero, but also a new mount instead of a new skin.

Since the patch, idk if it's because of the introduction of unranked draft or better matchmaking or both, but the games are so much better. I finally have consistently good team's.
