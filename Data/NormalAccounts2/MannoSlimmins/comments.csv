65,"One thing you constantly hear around contract negotiations from both players (Example: Buffs contract negotiations last season) and management is that Hockey is first and foremost a business.

If you were a business owner, and every time you denied someone a raise + extra benefits + specific (favourable) work conditions, they would walk out and not come into work, you would fire their ass. Why? Because if you gave in to them, everytime someone comes up for a raise, they would know all they need to do is wait you out and they'll get what they want. Especially if your paying your employees millions of dollars a year.

I like Trouba. But I also liked Frolik. Frolik wanted too much at a time TNSE couldn't put that money in front of him. He found a team that could offer him the money he wanted. I'm sad he's gone, but he made his choice.

And Trouba is making his. The difference is, he's an RFA, and the Jets own his rights to the NHL for 4 years. So, if he doesn't want to sign what TNSE is putting in front of him, he can either make a counter-offer for a shorter term and hope to renegotiate at that time, or he can carry on sulking like a child and sit out a season of NHL hockey. Or, if he still wont budge, 4 years.

I'll be sad to see Trouba go, and wish we had him on the team. But I don't think TNSE should be giving in to his demands when by all accounts they're offering him a shit tonne of money. If he's not willing to play the left side and *then* try to get traded so he can play on the right, or work with TNSE while he's playing to get the preferable right side, then he can lose out.

71,"&gt; You refused to ask \/u/Tok-A-Mak entered into the agreement. Therefore, cease assuming why. I previously told you were assumption was erroneous.

Lol no. You're still absolutely nuts to think it's a legally binding contract 

&gt; You are delusional.

Uhhhh, I don't claim to have something that's been [debunked several times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_hypersensitivity#Diagnosis)....

Though I'll agree with wikipedia

&gt; Complaints of electromagnetic hypersensitivity may mask organic or psychiatric illness.

Especially the latter.

&gt; I previously cited my posts on this. I will recite them:

So, the sources you're going to cite about other people doing stuff are.... you? Your sub (With a post submitted by you), your posts. That's not anywheres near and acceptable citation

&gt; Obviously, you don't give a damn about TIs being tortured and assassinated and not getting any help from reddit.

I care about mentally ill people not getting the help they need. I have a few resources, and can also direct you to a well known youth psychologist on twitter who'll be happy to help you find more resources.

&gt; Again, you made an erroneous assumption.

Not really. Nothing you have said has contradicted that =/

73,"&gt; FUCK LAWS THAT SIDE WITH SCUM LIKE THESE.

Where I live, the laws were changed a few years back. They made eviction *very* easy for the landlords, but severely limited the reasons landlords could evict. Before, landlords could evict you or refuse to renew your lease for nearly any reason (Except discriminatory or retaliatory reasons). Now, they can evict you for 2 reasons. Failure to pay rent, and being a disturbance (E.G: Lots of noise complaints, threatening other tenants, etc).

They also changed the timetable for eviction. Before it was after 30 days you could provide 30 days notice. Now if you don't pay your rent on the 1st, they can give you notice on the 15th, have their tenancy board hearing and have you evicted by the 30th.

Of course, there are tradeoffs. Landlords got a lot less leeway. For instance, where there once was a 1-1.5% limit on rental increases (it changed each year), there's none now. But if they're even 24 hours late providing notice for a rental increase, they have to wait another full year. That's how i got out of a pretty big increase just a few days ago. They had to provide notice by the 31st, they didn't even contact us before the 1st. No rental increase for me.

Lots of pros/cons to the new tenancy regulations. Only thing that really bugged me was it was applied retroactively to existing leases (instead of waiting until the lease was renewed).",2016-11-05 02:47:22+00:00,d9mfoif,2.0,t1_d9m6mh3,14210.0,AskReddit

78,"&gt; What are my wild crazy ideas?

That you have a legally binding contract that occurred over PM for a link in the sidebar.

What damages or relief would you be seeking? In what way were you damaged by him removing a link to your subreddit from his sidebar?

Can you prove he actually wrote that? Can you prove that at the time he did send that, that he had the capacity to form a contract? What if he was drunk? What if he requires medication to function normally, and wasn't on them?

You're trying to turn a ""If I do this will you leave me the fuck alone?"" message into a legally binding contract.

Are you seriously telling me you would be willing to sue him, stand in front of a judge and say ""Your honor, he removed a link to my subreddit! He violated our contract! See, this contract, written in this PM right here""?

Also, you believe in free speech I assume? You know that freedom of association is a core principal of free speech, right? What if he no longer wishes to associate with you or your subreddit? Do you want to violate his free speech? Are you *trying* to censor him?

&gt; /r/targetedenergyweapons was never dead. 

Oh, sorry. I figured if I had to scroll 3 pages to find a single post from a user that wasn't you, it could safetly be considered ""dead""

&gt; quickly removed the referral due to pressure by his replacement 

[citation needed]

Even if that's the case.... who cares? Are you saying that he's required to link to your subreddit forever? That doesn't sound very equitable. In fact, as he's getting nothing out of it, this supposed contract seems entirely one-sided. 

&gt; They didn't want to refer any TIs to outside subs. Hypocritically, they wanted to keep all TIs in their sub but remove posts on topics

For instance, you have a right to travel between states, right? I think we can all agree that is a right Americans have. 

But do you have a *right* to drive a car? Well, no. Driving is a privilege. You need to have a license, vehicle registration, and proof of insurance.

So, the type of person we mock are the sovereign citizens/freeman on the land who believe that the right to travel means they can drive without a license. They'll claim they are ""travelling"" in their ""private conveyance"".

There's so many different ""brands"" of Sovereign Citizens. Those that make travelling argument, the ""Organized Pseudolegal Commercial Argument"" Litigant. These people are a special brand of crazy ([Some background](http://www.macleans.ca/politics/court-decision-with-a-cult-following/), [wiki page for the court case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemen_on_the_land)).

But what you *normally* see on the sub is the more ""funny"" stuff (The OPCA litigants, travellers, etc), but that's not what makes Sovereign Citizens so scary.

You know when you get banned, you get that notification from reddit that your posting ability has been revoked in that sub? If you read it, you would see

&gt; **Reminder from the Reddit staff**: If you use another account to circumvent this subreddit ban, that will be considered a violation of [the Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy#section_prohibited_behavior) and can result in your account being [suspended](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205687686) from the site as a whole.

Now, I can't speak for *all* mod teams, but at least where I mod, if you get banned, and come back with a different account and follow the rules, we'll turn a blind eye, even if it's obvious. But from what you're saying, you kept doing the same thing that got you banned over and over. At some point, they're going to get tired of dealing with you, and message the admins with a list of your accounts.

While it sucks that your accounts get suspended shortly after being created, you really did bring this on yourself by failing to read that message from the admins at the end of each ban message you received, and continuing with the same behavior that got you banned in the first place.

&gt; I understand that I did make mistakes using the site but I just want to be a regular user again. I had thought that /u/spez [+2] mentioned that shadowbans were for robots only

Your accounts aren't shadowbanned. The ones you linked are suspended. There's a difference.  And the whole reason they brought out suspensions is so they can be transparent about site-wide punishments, while keeping shadowbans for bots.",2016-10-17 16:29:19+00:00,d8vw0je,1.0,t3_57xv65,4158.0,help

We went back to free after the one month. I was basing it off of memry

&gt; I said we've gotten most of the previous spam issue under control, which the data support. Posts eventuslly removed as spam as being exposed to users nearly 70% less frequently than just a year ago.

That's actually great. Do you think some time reddit could do a blog post about spam stats? I think a lot of mods would like to see some of the progress you guys are making

&gt; I think it's really just an issue of vocabulary more than anything — there isn't a good word for content that users don't mind seeing, but is posted for illegitimate reasons (eg karma farming accounts). More importantly, it's much, much harder to detect and prevent without creating harmful user experiences like not allowing new users to post.

&gt; I would love to hear suggestions about what you all think might be a good solution

Honestly, the only way I can see is the mods going ""full nazi"". It would require vetting every submission and comment to stop the account farming.

But that solution isn't workable for any sub. Not just because it's more work than even /r/science could handle, but because it would effectively off reddit.

Personally, I'd love to see (And /u/achievementunlockd put in a ticket to get it considered. I forgot the ticket # though) youtube channels being blacklisted on a global level like domains are.

I can understand reddit being more cautious in its approach to banning. Could you imagine if seo_nuke banned all domains when it detected someone had posted a little too much? Some legit sites would be banned because of it (Some very common, high traffic ones, too). Reddit also isn't in the financial position to have a bunch of people go through lists of suspected spam domains. Hell, they try to work through the /r/spam backlog but are so understaffed, that rarely, if ever, happens. At the rate people submit there, whatever small amount of time they put into dealing with the backlog doesn't even make a dent.

We brought this up when reddit started allow self posts to gain karma. The reply from /u/drunken_economist was ""I think reddit has spam under control"". And while I don't doubt reddit has done a lot to fight spam, I'd really like him to see this post by /u/cwenham .

264,"&gt; And /r/aww is one of the highest targeted subs because it's the easiest content to spam.

Actually, based on the spam accounts i've been seeing, they're starting to target some of the ""less desirable"" subs to start gaining karma before branching out elsewhere. I've been seeing a lot of account farmers popping up that have been using /r/KotakuInAction and /r/The_Donald to farm karma (And even spam as they'll just attach a clickbaity title and get it to /r/all).

I've messaged both subs about the same. Whatever your feelings are about those subs, KiA has at least done a lot to stop this type of spam, including adding /u/yt_killer. The_Donald, on the other hand, takes the opposite approach. They just approve any filtered posts, so even getting domains banned by the admins for spamming doesn't even work.

/r/aww /r/videos /r/funny and now that fucking self posts give karma, /r/askreddit and /r/jokes (Mine :( ) are still targets. But i'm seeing more and more spammers targetting those other subbies",2016-10-08 20:44:33+00:00,d8jmdz5,2.0,t1_d8jg8dc,9141.0,ModSupport

315,"Okay, so a faceoff in hockey is when 1 forward from each team meets in the center of the ice (Neutral territory - should be universal across most sports). A referee holds the puck above the very center of the ice, and when it is dropped, both of the forwards compete to gain possession of the puck, and typically pass it to another player.

That's what happens at the start of each game, at the start of each period, after each goal, and after every single stoppage in play (Though it may not always be the center of the ice depending on the reason play was stopped). In this case, the ceremonial faceoff is where somebody special drops the puck between the two players while posing for a photo. There's no competition to try to actually gain possession of the puck. Shortly after the ceremonial puck drop, the guest leaves the ice, and a referee starts the game.

In baseball, it's simpler. The pitcher throws the ball across the plate, and the player on the opposing team tries to hit it. Throwing the first pitch in baseball is similar to the above. It's meant as a photo op. For instance, a current or former U.S president, an actor, or somebody notable in the community. The player with the bat doesn't attempt to actually hit the ball, and it's not part of the normal gameplay.

I don't follow rugby, but after looking at this [article and video](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/rugby-world-cup/11869120/What-is-a-scrum-Rugby-World-Cup-rules-explained.html), it's like the referee who places the ball between the two teams during the scrum, but where neither team is actually trying to win the scrum and it's done for publicity/photo op.

365,"&gt; I would love to know why Derek Smart is allowed to post on this subreddit after having been shadow banned from reddit? If he were anyone else he wouldn't be allowed to post again. 

Shadowbanned users are users that were punished site-wide, not on the subreddit level. Derek was shadowbanned before they made the [conversion to suspensions](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3sbrro/account_suspensions_a_transparent_alternative_to/). Today, shadowbans are only used for spam accounts. Those shadowbanned before suspensions became a thing were not converted to the new system.

So, *why* can Derek post? Because shadowbanning was meant to be a way of stopping spammers, it would be counter-productive to let shadowbanned users know they are shadowbanned. Everything that a normal user can do, a shadowbanned user can do. But you cannot view their profile, and anything that a shadowbanned user submits/comments on is automatically sent to the moderation filter for manual review.

In all likelyhood /u/BoredDellTechnician saw that Derek responded when checking the mod queue and manually approved it.",2016-09-23 00:46:27+00:00,d7y8rqt,5.0,t1_d7xyh55,14959.0,DerekSmart

434,"Just FYI, for those wondering, depending on where you are, cops don't need to provide you their badge number in Canada (Rank + name, yes. badge number, no).

Found that out when I took my landlord to tenancy court. Got a call from a ""sergeant"" and I was under the impression he had to give his badge number. He wouldn't. So I hung up and called the real cops to report someone, likely an employee of my landlord, impersonating the city police. They said cops aren't required to provide a badge number, but that a sergeant would never be dealing with a civil matter. It would be a constable.

Ended up getting out of my lease early just because of that phone call. I got served papers a few months later by the sheriffs office to be a witness in a criminal case. Apparently it was the landlord himself who either made the call or specifically told an employee to do what he did.

Libraries aquire books in several ways. 

* Bulk purchases - They get books at a severely reduced price purchasing in mass quantities usually from the publisher. These are usually done for all library branches at once to make get the best discount

* Individual donations/book drives - I have donated my book collections to libraries in several provinces in the past. If I moved and couldn't bring the books with me, they got donated. Libraries are more than happy to accept them. You can see this in action in pretty much every library in North America. Go into the religious section, and if you see a book about Scientology (written by Scientology), there's a good chance that those were donated by Scientologists.

I don't get this argument. Most of the people buying used games wont be buying the game at full price either because A) They can't afford full priced games, or B) They've been burned way too many times.

The ""no used games"" concept is ridiculous. It takes away the only perk of having a disk copy of the game: Actual tangible ownership.

When you own something, you can lend it out, sell it, trade it, give it away, or intentionally break it. Publishers crying about lost sales would prefer people didn't realize that they still received money from the original sale.

We heard he wants to leave, we heard he loves this city and wants to stay, we heard he believed in what the Jets were building and wanted to be a part of it, and we heard he wanted to play on a team with a chance of winning the playoffs.

Every other week the stories changed to whatever the new rumor was, even if it was in direct contradiction to everything else they were telling us before.

So unless I see something from Trouba or his agent stating that he doesn't want to be part of the Jets, and wants to go to a different team, here is what I believe:

He's currently with the Jets, and is currently signed until the end of the 16/17 season. If we sign him before then, great. If we don't sign him, we'll likely trade him just before or at the trade deadline.

As for him wanting to be here, not wanting to be here, wanting to be with the jets, not wanting to be with the jets, or any other unsubstantiated statement that doesn't originate from Trouba or his agent? It holds less water than a colander.

Lets face it. TSN, Sportsnet, and all the other hockey sites out there have a interest in pushing rumors on pending signings: It plays on fans emotions, and drives clicks.

555,"&gt; Meh. I don't think kids should ever get this involved in politics

I agree. I went to school in Ontario when they started a program where each federal election, they would hold a similar mock election in the schools. Local candidates (Or, because Ottawa, sometimes party leaders) would show up and have debates that were mandatory attendance. 

The reason for this is they wanted to compare the votes from the schools to the votes in the riding, and in the overall election to see how it compares (and maybe start documenting a future political shift? who knows).

Anyways, the first year they did this, had our votes actually counted, Canada would have had a government consisting of ~90%  communist party (Who have never won a seat) and the other 10% being other random parties",2016-08-22 16:42:57+00:00,d6s17po,4.0,t1_d6ryjl7,3542.0,politics

Are you saying you *do* have access to those mod logs? Did he share those with you on a constant basis? If so, that seems a little odd...

""Hey baby, wanna see my reddit moderation log ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)""

&gt; I would like to see how he's somehow NEVER broken their activity rule

Are you sure about that? Because he's stated he doesn't remove and he doesn't ban. Again, in our slack conversations which I know you *really* hate me talking about because it's been absolutely destroying this neat little story you're trying to push.

&gt; I'm pretty sure the article lists all the ties he has with Breitbart

From the article 

&gt; &gt; Jeffrey Minter, known on Reddit under the username /u/Kwiztas, has previously been interviewed by Breitbart in relation to censorship on Reddit and has expressed his support of both Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos and Donald Trump. He has also previously provided technical support work for Yiannopoulos.

Why would someone who only supports Milo and provides the occasional technical support have a yiannopoulos.net email address? But, to put what he does for Milo into his own words:

&gt; i am on the trump train

&gt; and i work for their lord milo

Later:

&gt; nah i am a web admin and free speech researcher

&gt; pretty much a research assistant minus the web admin stuff.

&gt; [In reply to someone laughing at Breitbart/Milo doing research] they don't it is for milo lectures

&gt; **i work for milo**

And, at a later time:

&gt; why i love milo i even slept in his bed once in the standard in west hollywood

Also, why would Kwiztas use his position with Milo to get himself unbanned from /r/the_donald?

&gt; and I'm pretty sure he disclosed that to the team, 

So your accusation is that Breitbart is unethical? That's a startling revelation i'm not sure most of the world is ready to accept just yet

&gt; I'm pretty sure he's never received a Breitbart paycheck

So... he did web administration and free speech research for free? Does sleeping in milos bed count as compensation?

&gt; You're talking about a person with a severe, physically debilitating conditions, one that actually restricts his activity. 

And i'm supposed to know this... how? Despite his physical condition, he (and you) made this bed. Don't get cranky now that we're forcing you to sleep in it.

&gt; We obviously have different definitions of ethical.

Well, i'm pretty sure if I went running to cry to a gossip rag that I worked for that I had been fired from my volunteer job for being inactive, I'd consider it *ethical* to, you know, disclose that I worked for their tech editor.

&gt; You seem to very ethical, of course, with your baseless accusations and double think.

My accusations are based on A) The article, B) Chats in the slack group. So, not really baseless. I have the records to back up my claims, and so do 325 other redditors that currently have access to the slack group (including multiple mods of this sub if they want to verify)

&gt; Unless you've modded with him, or have access to some modlogs that show THE WHOLE TEAM'S activity, then stop talking. 

Do *you* have access to the mod logs? Can you see the whole teams activity? No? Then take your advice, and this drama you two started may die down (Or not, because just today he ran back to Breitbart... again)",2016-08-16 03:05:59+00:00,d6j863n,13.0,t1_d6j78hv,1497.0,SubredditDrama

That's what, 45 minutes across an entire month to dedicate to mod actions. I'm pretty sure he spent more than that talking about frozen peaches and how he would never remove anything from /r/politics, even if it's blatantly rule breaking in the slack group because ""censorship"".

But he couldn't even find the time to do less than 2 minutes/day worth of mod actions.

So, he got booted, now you two go running to the alt right version of Buzzfeed to lie.

By the way, why *did* they lie about his involvement with Breitbart and Milo? Or was that you and him lying?

Or was he lying when he said he did research for Milo? If so, why does he have a yiannopoulos.net email?

670,"&gt; Do you think some of those people aren't trying to spam, just share content? Or not?

There is a difference in the two. And if it's not obvious that a user is trying to spam, and just wants to share their own content, but is doing it a bit too much, they'll get a friendly message letting them know about reddits guidelines saying 10% or less should be to your own content.  With the specific user you mentioned it was actually spam. Same with the ASMR guy. The guy *only* posts his own content on reddit and only commented on his own submissions. If there was any activity from him that wasn't posting his own content, our interactions would have been different.

&gt; Because I'd feel like a douche if I was that rude to them, if it was just a misunderstanding.

Understandable. I come off as an ass sometimes, but wont apologize for it unless I'm actually in the wrong. And it's happened a few times. In fact, one of the *main* things a user can do to make me rethink the ban is to message us about it. If they respond to the message my first action is to go through and make sure I made the right call. Because i've messed up in the past, and on a few occasions accidentally banned the wrong guy. Mistakes happen, so if I get a modmail about my ban, I'm going to double check everything, and even be more thorough than my initial analysis. 

As for why I wont apologize: I have no tolerance for spam. As far as I'm concerned, you have 1 chance. If you step over the line from ""maybe spam"" to ""just here to spam"", i have no reason to be polite. If someone I ban for spam comes back in 6 months and asks to have a second chance, and their history shows that they're submitting from a diverse group of domains, and it's not just their own content/website? Yeah, i'll give them a shot after enough time has passed. But some of those spammers, the ones I was really rude to, are the ones I've been dealing with for months, who have dozens of accounts, and who do nothing but waste my time. 

&gt; Also how can you tell when someone has multiple accounts

If you look at another screenshot i [posted above](http://i.imgur.com/77lYRg4.png) you'll notice there's a screenshot within the screenshot. We have a database of all youtube links submitted to /r/sports since the yt_killer bot was added and can easily search it.

671,"&gt; Do you ever screw with people?

Not in /r/sports. I do it in /r/jokes, though. But that's mostly because it's /r/jokes, and no one takes us seriously. [We do things like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/40lhzp/3_mods_walk_into_a_bar/) ([OOTL Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/40oivr/so_what_did_that_joke_about_3_mods_walking_into_a/)), and the community actually enjoys it. So we'll look for ways to use our mod powers to joke around when we can.

&gt; I'd do stuff like ban a spammer and then tell him that I'll unban him if he jumps through a bunch of hoops.

There was one guy (also /r/jokes) that made a pretty bad mistake. Few things we instantly ban for, and he managed to do 2 of them in 1 comment. He apologized in modmail, was pretty polite, and as a joke told him to write a 5,000 word essay on a certain topic (can't remember. it's been so long).

674,"Shadowbanning is used on spam accounts. To the user, nothing has changed. They can see their profile, they can post and comment all they like, but their posts/comments go straight to the spam filter, and regular people can't view their profile.

Multiple accounts: Not to give too much away, but we have an off-site database that links every youtube channel to the username that posted it, either in a submission or in a comment, and can reference it at any time. When a new channel keeps popping up that has no views and little to no subscribers moments after being posted, there's a 99% chance that the channel belongs to them. 

So if someone has multiple accounts, i can just put in a link to the channel or the individual youtube link, and it'll pop up every time that channel has been posted in /r/sports, who posted it, and a link there. So when you have a known group of spammers spamming select youtube channels, you can easily blacklist them, and get them before their posts go live, regardless of how many reddit accounts they create. 

On top of that, I also have an RSS feed setup for youtube links in /r/sports and manually review each one and if it looks suspicious, also the user history. If it turns out to be a spammer, that channel gets added to the blacklist.",2016-07-28 21:19:34+00:00,d5v0e8e,7.0,t1_d5v05ou,319.0,sports

712,"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2015/06/dont-let-crowdfunding-be-your-doom

&gt; Here’s what you or your business can learn from this case, so that crowdfunding does not become your “Doom:”

&gt; 1. Keep your promises when crowdfunding. **If you promise rewards, give them.**  If you promise refunds, provide them.

Just because you change your terms of service the night before you are required to provide refunds doesn't absolve you of the requirement to provide refunds.

But even if that *was* the case, and companies can randomly change contracts and make them retroactive, then CIG is still required to provide refunds under ***kickstarters*** terms of service.

 https://www.kickstarter.com/terms-of-use?ref=footer

&gt; Kickstarter provides a funding platform for creative projects. When a creator posts a project on Kickstarter, they’re inviting other people to form a contract with them. Anyone who backs a project is accepting the creator’s offer, and forming that contract.

&gt; [...]

&gt; When a project is successfully funded, the creator **must complete the project and fulfill each reward.**

To date, RSI/CIG/ABCD has not fulfilled their requirements under Kickstarters ToS. An alpha != the final product

&gt; Throughout the process, creators owe their backers a high standard of effort, honest communication, and a dedication to bringing the project to life. 

Changing the terms of service right before they have to give refunds for not delivering a product doesn't sound very honest, nor should it holding themselves to a high standard. In fact, I'd say that standard would be typical of Rogers (Comcast if you're American).

&gt; There may be changes or delays, and there’s a chance something could happen that prevents the creator from being able to finish the project as promised.

&gt; If a creator is unable to complete their project and fulfill rewards, they’ve failed to live up to the basic obligations of this agreement. To right this, they must make every reasonable effort to find another way of bringing the project to the best possible conclusion for backers. A creator in this position has only remedied the situation and met their obligations to backers if:

&gt; [...]

&gt; * they work diligently and in good faith to bring the project to the best possible conclusion in a timeframe that’s communicated to backers;

Again, changing the ToS to take away the right to get a refund for not getting a product you helped kickstart is most certainly not working in good faith

&gt; * they’re able to demonstrate that they’ve used funds appropriately and made every reasonable effort to complete the project as promised;

After seeing all the expensive crap they have in their offices, they certainly haven't been using backers funds appropriately. 

&gt; they’ve been honest, and have made no material misrepresentations in their communication to backers; and

honest: Uh, no. How many months has it been since Star Marine was ""weeks away""? [This article](http://www.pcgamer.com/star-citizen-fps-module-is-weeks-away-says-chris-roberts/) is dated July 19th, 2015. Almost 1 year ago.

[Material representations](http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/material+representation): See above

&gt; * they offer to return any remaining funds to backers who have not received their reward (in proportion to the amounts pledged), or else explain how those funds will be used to complete the project in some alternate form.

They did offer to return pledges.... until they decided they no longer wanted to right before they were required to do so under their own ToS.

From an outsiders perspective, can you understand why a lot of us see this as a moneygrabbing scam? I've been following it for awhile, waiting to buy into this. RSI/CIG/LGBTQ isn't really making those that are on the fence about buying in confident that they aren't actually going to take the money and run with no actual game",2016-07-15 22:37:21+00:00,d5dwwf9,10.0,t1_d5dvxn6,1553.0,starcitizen

723,"&gt; To me, sports and other live broadcasts are the only kinds of shows that actually still fit the old model (because you can't binge-watch an entire season of basketball if they haven't played the games yet :P), so that really is the only valid sales pitch.

The only thing that the NHL streaming service has that cable doesn't is the ability to watch past games (Though apparently, after they switched to the new streaming service, historic games aren't available anymore). So if there was a moment this past season I wanted to relive, I could. Can't do that without recording with a DVR, and you only have so much space on those.

&gt; Even then, if they focused their resources on providing a 'netflix for sports' kind of service that was reasonably priced and worked reliably well with good definition, I'd rather that than cable any day.

Thats what they had before. Before, they were with a company called Neulion ([Company](http://www.neulion.com/), [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeuLion)) and the service was actually pretty good. They could have had less blackouts, but that was pretty easy to get past. Being on the east coast watching Jets games, I never had to really worry about that. The problem with Neulion, however, is [that it was easily bypassed](https://www.reddit.com/r/NHLStreams/comments/2m7kaq/fuckneulionv22_no_more_butt_rammings_and_french/)

But right after the All Star Game this year, they transferred over to a new system. They have a partnership with the MLB to use their system to stream. I really looked forward to this, because if any sports league had done streaming right, it was the MLB. But, the NHL underfunded the servers making the games literally unwatchable for weeks after launch, removed the ability to watch historic games (May be back by now, but i wont be paying for it), and then wonder why they're still having issues.

You know who isn't having issues? The pirates. Because just like Neulion was bypassed, [so was this new system.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NHLStreams/comments/4bqe8x/getting_started_with_nhl_streams/) 

I'd happily accept a compromise from robelus: Sell us a $0 cable package. We don't get a cable box, we don't get to actually watch anything on TV, but you allow us to add single channels to the $0 package (E.G: $5-10/month for TSN). That way, we can just go to that companies website and stream it. I can stream through TSN.ca and Sportsnet.ca with my friends bell login.

I'd opt into the basic cable idea if I could add a single sports channel to the bundle. TSN3 and/or Sportsnet so i can watch the Jets, and i'd pay for it. I'd pay a bit more than what it would cost to stream, but the quality would be better and have less issues than the new NHL streaming service",2016-07-14 19:15:31+00:00,d5cc64i,5.0,t1_d5ay2sp,87332.0,canada

[28]      While all of that would be concerning enough, L.S.’s revelations regarding alternative treatment were even more shocking.

It would be more of an issue if your PM was the head of state, but no, he isn't. Your Queen is.

If you don't want to go through the examples in the DoPS video, here's a recent one where there was contact: [Byfuglien absolutely demolishes Stone](http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/gotta-see-byfuglien-absolutely-demolishes-stone/)

edit: For some reason TSN.ca deleted their video about that hit. It was called ""The Anatomy of a Clean Hit: Big Buff delivers devastating, but textbook, hit to Stone"". It went point by point why head contact was acceptable in that situation",2016-06-29 19:14:09+00:00,d4sykra,3.0,t1_d4sqx1h,9197.0,sports

Thankfully two Canadian teams won the first 2 draft spots (Though really, Toronto stayed at #1, and winnipeg moved up 6 spots for #2), neither of them Edmonton. I'm not a Toronto fan, though I hope with Babcock they can start improving to the point they can make the playoffs again (And having Austin Matthews wouldn't hurt their chances, either).

Winnipeg is the most likely ""underdog"" team to make a playoff push in 2016-2017, though not enough talent to win it. However, Winnipegs GM has been absolutely genius with his long-term planning. We have an amazing pool of prospects, and [Hockey News magazine is expecting them to win the playoffs in 2019](http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/meet-your-2019-stanley-cup-champsthe-winnipeg-jets/).

Some issues I think should have been caught before release, but the rest is just issues with balancing gameplay, which is being worked on constantly, and some performance issues (I got a pretty big performance increase when I updated to the beta build).

&gt; Dale Martin Jacobi is a disturbing character. Though he is Canadian, he was a leader of the Montana Freemen back in the 1990's. The Montana Freemen holed up in a ranch after an abortive attempt to seize and hang a judge after a trial in a ""common law court"". It was the longest FBI siege to date. 

&gt; How disturbing? How about this [Dog? What dog...](http://dneiwert.blogspot.ca/2015/03/tales-of-montana-freemen-girl-and-her.html):

&gt;&gt; Jacobi took Brush’s 8-year-old daughter, with her dog in tow, out to a remote part of their land. He carried with him a stool and a piece of rope. Under a tree, Jacobi set up the stool and placed the little dog on it. Then he made a noose with the rope, placed it over the dog’s neck, and slung it over the tree. He pulled the open end of the rope tight and held it at a distance from the dog, then told the girl to come stand in front of him. Call the dog, he told the girl. She did. It jumped off the stool and hung itself as Jacobi held the line taut. 

&gt;&gt; The girl was in hysterics when her father returned home. Enraged, he asked Jacobi why he did it. Jacobi told him he felt the girl needed some toughening up, and that this would help her. Brush screamed at Jacobi to leave and never come back. Jacobi packed his things into his car and left. 

&gt; I make a lot of jokes about Sovereigns and Freemen and Moors and so on. They deserve it - as human beings, they are contemptible. Scum. But ... that's not all they are. They are your proverbial bad neighbors. And Dale Jacobi is a prime example.

&gt; Unsurprisingly, Associate Chief Justice Rooke has some things to say about that: [Perreal v Knibb, 2014 ABQB 15](http://canlii.ca/t/g2jtm).

&gt; Meet the Freemen/Sovereigns. They hate us. They despise the fact we care for one another. They loath that we want to build a better society. We are just dogs to be kicked off stools, while those who care for us scream.

1219,"&gt; Canadians love hockey, but you'd never know it from visiting here

On a related note, before the mod drama happened, me, /u/lucky75 and /u/perma were talking about having a ""Hockey Night in /r/Canada"" event at the start of 2016-2017 season. Sort of have a theme for a few days (Starting when the first Canadian team has their season opening, ending after the last Canadian team has their season opening) with some custom CSS. We thought it would be interesting to try out something like that.

As someone who has been here for a long time, what would your thoughts on something like that be? Would it interest you (Even if you weren't interested in the sport?), do you think /r/canada should do something like that?

&gt; so I've seen it go from a natural sub about Canada, covering a wide range of topics such as music, hockey, nature, photos, news and politics among other things, to being heavily moderated into just news and politics.

I'll agree with you there, though I know some changes (regarding images) happened due to community demand. I, personally, would like to see some of the rules changed to be more lenient towards those types of posts, instead of being categorized as ""low content"" posts. And it's something that we do talk about in our slack group. Scheduling conflicts do make it difficult at times for us to have a proper discussion about changes, though. But it something I can we are working on.",2016-05-19 21:59:22+00:00,d3c6c9x,9.0,t1_d3c62oa,400.0,canada
1220,"&gt; but it's not contorting itself into anything with heavy moderation.

Well, to be fair, it's really hard to have heavy moderation when you have mod drama every 2 days, and oust all the mods every 4.

&gt; But many things about Canada and Canadians are not reflected by /r/canada because they are moderated out.

Which Canadians? The left has a stranglehold on /r/canada and metacanada/conservatives/the right aren't being banned from here for no reason (I've yet to permanently ban one. Some have received short temp bans depending on how often they break the rules).

If anything, conservative opinions gets drowned out by liberals, both in number of users  and by downvotes. But that's not ""being modded out"". That's individual (non-mod) users downvoting opinions they don't like away",2016-05-19 21:48:31+00:00,d3c5wnu,7.0,t1_d3c5rm2,205.0,canada

1275,"&gt; I really wish the admins would change that quirk so that you mods could see who is reporting

They won't, nor shouldn't. It's a privacy issue to them, and I agree with them. They can, however, offer us tools to block people reporting while maintaining anonymity. 

They can either 

1. Set a report limit like a post limit. If you keep getting downvoted in a specific sub, reddit is going to start rate limiting you. They could do the same with reports. If x% of your reports are approved, you should start running into a report ratelimit.

2. Allow us to ""block future reports"". We wouldn't be able to see who is on the block list, but would allow us to block future reports based on reports we already have.

3. Add a report counter to reports. If someone has reported 20 things in the last 24 hours, have ""x20"" appended to their report or something similar. After awhile we would have a understanding on what the average person who reports posts/comments looks like, and can forward those that are well above that norm to the admins to revoke those reporting privileges.

A few ideas, none of which will ever happen, though. Some users, though, make it painfully obvious who is reporting what. They receive a warning, and if they continue, they'll be banned (Hasn't happened here. Has happened in my other subs). Why a ban? Because banned peoples reports don't show up.

&gt; Can I ask if you have been getting pushback on this? 

Not pushback to the idea, though some of my suggestions, and for understandable reasons. For instance, I suggested /u/soul_shot, who mods NotTheOnion, and has experience with large queues. Regardless of who all gets brought in, I want one person who has a mod history in a large sub, with a large mod queue, because they wont need much instruction. soul_shot was denied because it would make it look like the mod team had a specific bias (He's also the top mod of /r/ndp).

None of the pushback on my suggestions has been unreasonable. I know enough mods around the sub that I can point and say ""This spot would be perfect for X"". But, this isn't /r/sports, /r/jokes, or other subs like that. This is /r/Canada, a country-specific subreddit. It's not unreasonable to want mods who actually live in the country. The problem is, most mods I know are either Americans, British, or Canadian ex-pats.",2016-05-17 20:39:21+00:00,d39aj2n,7.0,t1_d39a18x,645.0,canada
1276,"Part of why the mod queue was abandoned is because of how people use the report function here.

If I didn't touch the mod queue at all, or went on a 3 day vacation and no one touched the mod queue, it would be back up to the 1,000 hard limit in 24 hours.

People use the report button as a super downvote button. They'll also get pissy and start going through somebodies history and report every post or comment that user has ever made in /r/canada. 

This is a situation i've only seen in this subreddit. It's why I've needed to contact the admins on numerous occasions to have ""report fairies"" reporting privileges revoked here.

If, as a sub, people used the report function for what it was supposed to be used for, the other mods wouldn't have felt that way.

It's very aggravating to deal with the mod queue, refresh it, only to see an additional 20 items in there, only to deal with those and upon refreshing seeing another dozen or so items in there.

Before I started replying to you, the mod queue was clean and sitting at 0. Looking at the toolbox bar, it's now sitting at 25. That's 25 reported posts or comments in less than 2 minutes

edit: 23 of those 25 were in /r/canada. 2 were from new account reports in another sub.",2016-05-17 20:17:06+00:00,d399hrc,5.0,t1_d39907s,620.0,canada

1278,"&gt; so there isn't actually a record of them.

Well, there is. Admins can still see it. Wish we could. 

But no, we don't have automod set to remove at a certain report threshold. In fact, this is the only sub I'm a mod in that doesn't have it. The problem with that, though, is you need to be careful. As soon as someone realized that the threshold was ""3"" in /r/sports, they started abusing it, reporting with multiple accounts to get things off the front page. So, we had to up it. And we've had to up it a few times now. Once people realize they can easily cause a removal of something they don't like, they'll abuse it.

Well, at some point, I'll either get the help I need, or I'm going to step down. The queue needs attention (needy little bugger), and I can't be the only one giving it some.

1283,"I agree with that.

I've been asking to bring on more people to help for awhile now, and I've only been a mod here for 2 months.

Before I was brought on, the mod queue was abandoned. I spent a few hours shortly after being modded dealing with the 1,000 (hard limit set by reddit) items in the queue to make it clean and able to actually be used. Since then, I think i'm still the only mod that works the actual queue.

The queue is where any filtered posts (Such as by new accounts) or reported posts/comments go to. That means if you reported something before February 23rd, it probably wasn't looked at unless a mod saw the report while browsing the actual post.

I get why some people may consider my actions ""biased"" if I take action on one person, and not another. A few times in modmail i'll get ""But why was mine removed when this is allowed to stay"". The reason is i'm too busy dealing with a queue that rapidly fills up instead of being able to keep on eye on other threads. Sometimes I wont see an entire comment chain, just the reported posts in it.

And I know the mods here have tried in the past to get people to stop reporting every little thing when it doesn't break the rules. And I really wish people would start reporting only things that break the rules. Is someone being an asshole or trolling? Report that. Did someone say something you disagree with? For the love of god, don't report it.

The admins have actually had to step in to the sub a few times and revoke a few users reporting privileges because they were mass reporting every comment by specific users (While we're on the topic: Whoever is using a bot to automatically downvote a certain users posts, yes, we know it's happening. Yes, the admins are looking into it).

To put it into perspective: I mod 2 defaults with 12,841,389 subscribers combined. Their mod queues, combined, is less work than /r/canada.

Which is why I've been pushing the other mods to bring new, *active* people in. ",2016-05-17 18:09:53+00:00,d393f9n,8.0,t1_d392w5n,660.0,canada

1285,"&gt; I don't think the solution is more mods.

I would actually disagree with you, but only because I see what the queue is like, and the mod log.

There are 2 solutions.

1. We need more mods. 

2. We don't need more mods, but need *more active* mods. 

When one mod is doing 63% of the mod actions, and automoderator is doing 33%, you need more mods or a more active team. The remaining 4% is from all the other mods *combined*.

1292,"The way reddit works is top mod is the top of the mod team. In /r/jokes I can remove or edit permissions for every mod under me, but not a mod above me. 

Reddit wants to give autonomy to the mod teams, with only a few site-wide rules imposed. The rest is up to the mods/community to decide. They don't like to interfere with that. Some exceptions are when the sub is being used for spam and the mod(s) aren't active, they may ban the sub until it's requested, or for subs violating reddits content policy.

However, sometimes mods abandon reddit, and people will make a redditrequest for those subs (For instance, I was recently awarded /r/commonwealth which i need to figure out what to do with as my original plan isn't going to work). Because of backlash about mods squatting top mod spots, reddit has imposed the same rules on active subs with an active mod, but for top mods. If they're inactive for 60 days (following the rules of /r/redditrequest), reddit will agree to intervene and remove them. But until then, they want to give that person a chance to come back and be active.

No matter what system they put in place outside of a system that allows for sub-specific context, there's going to be unhappy people. If they looked at /r/canada using the specific circumstances for our sub, not only has QG not been active since April 1st, but he has not had any mod action here whatsoever for at least a year (the mod log only goes back so far).

So, they *will* remove qg (And there was actually a period where the mods here could have requested it but probably weren't aware. I wasn't here at that time), but they need to wait until he has 60 days of inactivity.",2016-05-17 16:59:29+00:00,d39012u,8.0,t1_d38zjsj,611.0,canada

/u/Gargatua13013 - She is someone everyone on the mod team actually agrees on, and has been approached at least twice in the last year. She's very active in the sub, posts good content, and is level headed. Unfortunately, she's a panel mod on AskScience and takes up her modding time.

/u/Hero_of_Brandon - Doesn't have the experience with large mod queues, and currently only mods /r/winnipegjets and /r/moosehockey. I suggested him because he's well respected in the sub, and in /r/hockey where he isn't afraid of calling out jets fans for being dicks

/u/Harborcoat84 - No mod history, semi-active in /r/canada, but same as above, well respected by the communities he is active in.

1336,"From the quatloos link in the video (from 2013)

&gt; He was released, I presume on bail, after three days in remand. He faces trial sometime in the next month.

&gt;Finney is employed as a movie theatre cleaner. Or so they think...

&gt;In reality Steve Finney is leader of the International Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State (http://itccs.org/). His incarceration? As a political prisoner!

&gt;&gt;Steve and Amy have been outspoken critics of the Childrens' Aid Society (CAS) and the police of the Kitchener-Waterloo area for their involvement in trafficking local children. The couple have picketed local CAS offices and called on residents to ignore the ""false jurisdiction of crown courts"". In response, CAS officials have seized their five year old daughter Amber.

&gt;&gt;Both Steve and Amy are declared citizens of the Republic of Kanata.

&gt;&gt;""We need everybody to come down here tomorrow to the courthouse to see what's happening"" said Amy in a telephone interview this morning.

&gt;&gt;""This is a police state. Steve's name wasn't even listed on the court register this morning when he appeared, and they still aren't charging him with anything. They wouldn't allow a bail hearing today even when Steve asked for one because he has a job to go to. They're trying to destroy us for our beliefs and 'cause we know what they're doing to our children. But we won't ever give up.""

&gt;&gt;The Kitchener ITCCS and local Republic of Kanata chapter have called a media conference for 9 am tomorrow, Tuesday October 1, along with a public protest, outside the Kitchener-Waterloo Criminal Courthouse. The address is 85 Frederick street in Kitchener, Ontario.

&gt;&gt;Come and rally to defend this targeted family, and an innocent man: brave defenders of liberty and our children. Don't let them crush us one by one!

&gt;&gt;Issued by ITCCS Canada and The Provisional Council of The Republic of Kanata (Winnipeg)

&gt; His release? Secured via intervention of powerful international entities!

&gt;&gt; In response to such flagrant political persecution, the ITCCS and its United Nations affiliates have dispatched two accredited human rights observers to Kitchener to attend the Wednesday, October 2 bail hearing of Steve Finney.

&gt;&gt; ""We were shocked to learn that one of the conditions for Mr. Finney's release on bail is that he disaffiliate himself from any involvement in our Tribunal"" said ITCCS legal advisor George Dufort today in Brussels.

&gt;&gt; ""Such a bail condition is certainly not lawful and violates all of the accepted norms of due process. We are appalled that such overt political persecution can go on within Canadian courts. If this is indeed the case, we will be pressing for sanctions and legal action against the government of Ontario and its Attorney General, John Gerretsen; and we will be urging Amnesty International and others to adopt Steve Finney as a Prisoner of Conscience and a recognized political prisoner in Canada.""

&gt;This ITCCS thing sounds like it has an important job. Did you know that the Childrens’ Aid Societies are child-slavery rings? It’s true!

&gt;&gt; Steve Finney and his wife Amy Smart, another vocal common law and Kanata activist, have already paid a price for their beliefs. Last month, their five year old daughter Amber was unlawfully seized by Childrens' Aid Society (CAS) workers and kept away from both of her parents.

&gt;&gt;The CAS makes $100,000 for every child like Amber that they kidnap and place under ""crown wardship"", resulting in a multi-billion dollar child trafficking industry that Steve and Amy have actively denounced with leaflets, placards and in-their-face confrontations with the ""authorities"". And that activism has made them beloved by local residents, and hated by police and judges.

&gt; Thankfully Steve is unbowed by the experience … nay, invigorated!

&gt;&gt;""I feel fantastic"" said Steve Finney in a brief telephone interview soon after his release.

&gt;&gt; ""I'm more determined now to keep fighting than I was before the arrest. What I saw in Maplehurst prison was sick, like, men sleeping on the floors and these overcrowded dirty cells. But the 35 guys in my cell all know their rights better now after I told them about our work and how Canada is dissolved. I'm going to be out on the street tomorrow fighting for those guys and for our common law rights.""

Huge difference between the departures of Kane and Ladd. I don't see us obsessing over him, though I do think he'll get a warm reception when he plays at the MTS center.

When Kane left, it was in the middle of a lot of rumors about him and the team. The comments he made after about the fans/winnipeg just made it a hell of a lot worse.

Ladd hasn't had those issues, and if anything has shown he wants to play with the Jets. He may not be everyones favourite player (He certainly isn't mine), but we can't deny all he's done for the team.

1463,"&gt; If the government can renegotiate Treaty and uphold their promises, then why can't First Nations disregard treaty and take back land?

Because it's two completely separate things?

Renegotiating a treaty requires all parties involved to come to the table to make changes. That means in order for the renegotiation to be successful, the government and the First Nations involved in that treaty need to agree. If one side or the other doesn't, it falls apart and nothing is done.

Disregarding a treaty is more of a one-sided action where one party makes an action that the other party may or may not agree with.

We may not have always treated them right, but renegotiating a treaty where they can ask for more (or alternatively, don't need to sign it for less) isn't exactly an abuse by the government",2016-04-22 16:21:55+00:00,d2d7pdg,9.0,t1_d2d592c,3335.0,canada

&gt;  It was at one time the largest landowner in the world, with the area of the Hudson Bay watershed, known as Rupert's Land, having 15% of North American acreage

To show just how big that was, here's a map of Rupert's Land https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Ruperts_land.svg/1024px-Ruperts_land.svg.png

At 3,861,400 km^2, Rupert's Land would be the 7th largest country in the world by landmass

&gt; A parallel may be drawn between the HBC's control over Rupert's Land with the trade monopoly and government functions enjoyed by the Honourable East India Company over India during roughly the same period. Viewed as a major competitor, the HBC invested £10,000 in the East India Company in 1732

I don't think banning opinions is right. I think banning the way people express their opinions or arguments is just fine, though.

You don't like muslims? Fine, that's your choice. You want to post something negative about muslims? Fine, that's you're choice. But if it breaks the rules, it gets removed at the least, and possibly banned depending on severity/history of similar rule violations.

I wonder what insurance companies did before direct-to-consumer genetics tests were available. It must have been a nightmare :(

This entire article tries to paint insurers as the good guy. Does anyone really believe that insurers care about *lowering* your premium? All they want is to extract as much money out of you while paying out the least (or, preferably, no) money.

The super gave me a copy of the camera footage for that time that shows the CP driver did nothing. Canada Post didn't care, and wouldn't take my complaint as I was the receiver. So I sent the footage to the shipper who filed the complaint.

The other thing you can try when Canada Post is fucking up is to call the call center and off the bat ask for a supervisor. When the agents try to assist without the transfer, they'll tell you that they can't the delivery center. It's true, *they* can't. But I've had a lot of luck having a supervisor message the depot to contact me. A supervisor at the depot will call you back within an hour or so, and correct the problem.

1590,"&gt;If you and your fellow moderators have a revolving door of employment with Nordic Games

So if Nordic Games or Golem Labs had an job opening for community manager, they shouldn't look at people who have already been actively managing fan communities for their games?

&gt; private communication channels

I fail to see how this violates reddits rules at all. I understand certain freeze peach crusaders hate admitting that mods are, in fact, people, and communicate with a wide variety of people, but believe it or not, talking with the people who run a game/service that you run a fansite for is not violating reddits rules

&gt; material help

Oh yes. I'm going to make so much money off their custom css for my subreddit. Wait, no. I'm going to make exactly $0. The only thing I'll get out of it is less time designing. Still not breaking reddits rules

&gt; signed statements

NDAs, like everything else mentioned before, do not violate reddits rules. Reddit as a company doesn't care if you post something in violation of an NDA signed by the poster, but they also don't care if mods sign an NDA. If the dev team/publisher is communicating upcoming changes to their game, or a release date, and only discloses that under an NDA, that doesn't break any rule, written or not.

If Golem Labs contacted me saying ""Hey, we just set a date for when we are going to release. Would you be interested in doing something on release day? We just don't want you telling people before we do"" and I agree, that breaks what rule?

&gt; gifts

You'll need to be more specific about ""gifts"". Is it stuff to give away to the community? Are they gifts with strings attached (E.G: No expectation of mod actions in exchange for gifts)? If so, they don't violate any rules

1621,"&gt; For some, naturopathy is a great thing.

And for a majority of the population, naturopathy is a danger to society.

Here's some stats for you:

* The longer naturopaths are in naturopathy school, the less supportive they become of vaccines. ([source - nlm.nih.gov](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18674581))

* Surveying Canadian students across all 4 years of study for naturopathy, only 12.8% of those students supported the recommended pediatric vaccine schedule [[source - nlm.nih.gov](https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/naturopathy-vs-science-vaccination-edition/)] (Though 74.4% would recommend a partial vaccination. Obviously based on their extensive medical experience)

* A similar study in Massachusetts (instead of students, actual practitioners) has the same findings. Most did not recommend vaccination [[source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10632255)] [[full text](http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=348533)]

* Care from a naturopath is associated with fewer vaccinations and a greater likelihood of vaccine preventable disease [[source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19760163)]

* A survey of children’s records from an Ontario naturopathic clinic identified 8.9% of children had not been vaccinated. [[source](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/115/3/e338.short)]

Lets also take a look at some resources from the [Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicines library](http://lrc.ccnm.edu/polaris/search/searchresults.aspx?ctx=3.1033.0.0.1&amp;type=Browse&amp;term=Vaccines&amp;by=SU&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;limit=TOM=*&amp;query=SU=%22VACCINES%22&amp;page=0&amp;searchid=1). Now, I'm not going to pay to read this bullshit, so I'm going to be pulling other peoples testimonials.

* Vaccines - The Risks, The Benefits, The Choices

This is a video, and someone uploaded it to youtube. You can find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdLMeULoujM). This video has helpful slides titled ""What should you do if you're 'forced' to vaccinate your children"" and ""Bioterrorism - Keep vigilant about protecting your rights"". Their slide about Polio calls it ""a simple viral infection"". Apparently being concerned about mumps is ""unfounded"". I'd go on, but I'm about to blow my brains out with the crazy in the video, and because I looked at the YouTube comments.

* [Perspectives in vaccinology](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/22107622)

Not going to comment much on that one. The full text is available for you to read it yourself.

* What your doctor may not tell you about children's vaccinations

""This is an essential guide for parents about vaccinations. Dr. Stephanie Cave explains their pros and cons and the book provides information to help parents make a knowledgeable, responsible choice about vaccinating their children.""

They can help you determine which fears are legitimate and how you should react to them and how you shouldn't (E.G: having weapons all over your house), and which ones aren't.

2. Lethal Force: AFAIK, you can only use as much force as necessary to prevent harm to yourself or others. If someone comes barging in with a gun and threatening to shoot, you probably wouldn't get in trouble for shooting him. But if someone comes in unarmed to rob what they think is an empty home with no intent to harm you physically, you can only use as much force as it would take to subdue him.

1662,"From Golem-JL on the Steam forums:

On our Facebook page, this week we talked about politics, trials and popular opinions. In The Guild 3, there will be many political positions (less if your city is smaller), separated into chambers. Even if you can be elected to just one position at a time, you can also influence other chambers (e.g. through putting a family member) - but up to a certain point. Like we discussed Wednesday, popular opinion is something that can boil over. If the population suspects that the system is corrupted, they could turn on you, even riot in front of your house!

This offers gameplay to every elected positions, and incites you to hold on to offices and put as many people as possible in several positions. It also allows you to advance positions, while opening and closing doors along the way. For players who attain high levels of power, this reality creates interesting situations where you can't simply rule with an iron fist. If you do, the population might revolt. You have to work on multiple levels, and at least give the impression that you're taking the popular opinion in consideration. 
Of course, popular opinion is something that can easily change. You know, with a couple of scandals here and there... 

If you want to read a story about politics and scandals, and to grasp the little hint on today's picture, go on http://theguildgame.com/politics-and-trials/ right now!",2016-04-01 17:55:17+00:00,d1m1k3t,1.0,t3_4cx022,24.0,theguild3

1731,"&gt; If your friend comes to you and says ‘I was sexually assaulted,’ you believe your friend. But you also use your sense of scrutiny for everything else you do in life and sometimes you have questions. When it comes to a criminal trial, you have to dig down when there are those questions because someone else’s life is at stake and someone else’s liberty is on the line.

Nailed it

&gt; We can support women who say they have been sexually assaulted. We can have resources available. But when it comes to a criminal trial, to #believe everything a woman says, says “Let’s just throw out the trial and convict the guy.” We would be using some sort of different justice system where no one gets a fair trial because the woman said this happened and that’ll be it. That would be a major setback. There are countries throughout the world who are desperate for our system of justice and there are people who have been convicted of things that they didn’t do. And one case that jumps out is that Neil Bantleman, the Canadian convicted overseas in Indonesia of sexually assaulting a child. The general consensus is the gentleman probably didn’t do it and did not receive a fair trial. The quality of the evidence is horrendous. But if it was #believekids that’s exactly what you get. Which is, “You’re convicted, the kid said it.” That’s full stop. We cannot regress to that justice system. We just can’t.

1808,"&gt; She even blames the Crown for not interrogating/investigating it out of her before the defence did. The problem with that is that everything the Crown discovers has to be disclosed to the defence as soon as possible

The problem with that is the police don't try to force anything out of you when you're a victim of sexual assault (And that is normally a good thing). This is to make the reporting much easier for victims in the hopes they'll come forward.

Were they supposed to treat her as a suspect and demand to know if she ever lusted after Jian? No. But when you leave out things that are actually relevant but could hurt your statement, it doesn't give the police (or the crown) time to defend against that when it eventually comes out in court.

TL;DR: Be truthful when reporting shit, or it'll come to bite you in the ass later. Who knows, if all three hadn't so blatantly lied under oath and to police, maybe the judge would have gone from ""probably guilty"" to ""guilty"".

Send your character to the infirmary for a cold, go to town hall for a lawsuit ect. breaking this even slightly seems weird.

I'll have to look into it more, but I think that's only for certain things, like applying for office, or a new title.

The closer to the center, the more points you get. If you can't get where you want to go, the strategy is to get your opponents stones out of the circle.

The yellow team didn't have any stones in the middle, but was still winning 6 points to 2 based on the position of their stones.

1893,"#Warning

It is very likely that this account is an ""account farmer"" or karma farmer!

Account farming is creating many accounts and posting low-effort content in an attempt to age them and build karma so they can be more useful for spamming, SEO, or vote manipulation.

Also known as ""account fattening"" and ""karma farming"", account farming is presently dominated by Hindi/Urdu speakers, with clues suggesting the major hubs are in Pakistan and India. When questioning some of the users we've identified as farmers, we've been able to glean that some are following tutorials posted on YouTube, which means that there is a cottage industry that has grown up around using reddit and other social media sites to make money. 

It is not clear that they are all organised into a handful of companies directly hiring people to spam reddit—although that is happening as well—but that there are hundreds and possibly thousands of independent opportunists who hear about ways to make money online, read a few blogs or YouTube videos about it, and start following one of the many tutorials available.

##Monetisation

The main ways they make money from account farming appear to be:

   1. Promoting monetised YouTube channels and accounts

   2. Promoting/SEO-ing an ad-supported blog or web site

   3. Selling seasoned accounts to account dealers such as [rm'd, banned link]
   4. Selling seasoned accounts to vote manipulation firms such as [rm cant use this link]

   5. Spamming porn or streaming video sites

They need accounts with age and karma in order to overcome the account-based obstacles that reddit and its mods have erected to deal with the spam problem. /r/videos uses AutoModerator to remove any posts from accounts below a certain karma level, for example. Creating a subreddit (popular with the streaming sports video spammers) now requires an account above a certain age and karma level. And the bot that auto-shadowbans accounts reported to /r/spam ignores accounts above a certain karma level.

We also suspect, but do not know, if reddit discounts upvotes from new or low-karma users, but it would explain the use of account farming from those intending to sell the account to vote manipulation firms.

##Characteristics

This list is constantly growing as the more sophisticated or ambitious account farmers try new techniques. In the beginning (only a year ago as I write this), it was rather easy: FirstLast## account names (eg: ""JohnSmith56"", ""MaryStuart47""), new user, low-effort posts, and robot-like posting. Many continue to try the FirstLast## formula, and they are probably newcomers reading old tutorials.

Unfortunately, the leading characteristic is still a poor grasp of English and a general ignorance of western culture, which means you need to be careful and avoid banning an innocent user. You are not Deckard, and sometimes you can retire a human by mistake.

   * Their user history starts out in /r/aww, /r/wallpapers, /r/pics, or /r/funny

   * ""Cute cat"", ""Cute dog"", ""Funny animal"", ""Funny amazing dog"", ""Amazing pic"", ""Nature beauty"", ""Amazing place in the world""

   * New York City skylines, Sidney Opera House, the Eiffel Tower, or London's skyline / Big Ben — these are their top Go-To pictures, although we don't know why

   * Stock nature photography or novelty pics with bland titles ([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/44xece/nature_image/))

   * The title implies a gallery of many pics, but there's only one. EG: ""10 amazing places to visit in New York"". This may be because they're reposting something by re-uploading the first pic to imgur to get a new URL, but are too lazy to copy over the entire gallery ([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/451s8o/traditional_dress_fashion_history_17001900/))

   * Their user history starts with posting a monetised YouTube video to /r/videos, receiving their automated notice of removal for low karma, and then quickly start posting to aww, wallpapers, funny and pics.

   * Asking banal questions in /r/AskReddit

   * Using /r/AskReddit like a quiz show (asking a common trivia question or trick question, then waiting for someone to give the correct answer, or providing the correct answer). We think these are attempts to build comment karma

   * Posting old yawners to /r/Jokes. One of the YouTube tutorials we found (now removed), explicitly describes searching Google for jokes and posting them on /r/Jokes 

   * Word-for-word reposts where the title implies ownership of the pic or subject (eg: ""This is my dumbass cat""). These can be detected with [KarmaDecay](http://karmadecay.com), and I recommend installing their browser extension to make it easier to use

   * Comments stolen from the imgur-hosted thread, or the YouTube-hosted thread (recommended: install the [reddit image info script](http://absurdlyobfuscated.com/reddit/) and it will identify comments in a reddit thread that were copied word-for-word from the corresponding imgur thread.)

   * Comments stolen from elsewhere in the same thread

   * Comments stolen from other web sites. If a user's history seems to switch jarringly from awkward or simple English to sophisticated use of language, try cut-n-pasting a sentence of their sophisticated comment into Google. You can often discover that their entire comment was stolen whole-cloth, or frankensteined from other sources

   * Pics of familiar western cultural icons, but with titles that suggest the OP doesn't know who/what they are. EG: Spongebob Squarepants is ""funny animal"" or Boo from Monsters, Inc. is ""funny cartoon girl""

   * Posting lots of stock photos, especially beauty-shots of major city landmarks and natural wonders

   * An old account (4+ months old) with no posting history at all until very recently. This may be a purchased account

   * Little to no comments in their history, or extremely short and low-effort comments

   * Bizarrely mis-titled posts, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/44vvh3/soccer/)

   * Crap-pics with mis-spelled titles, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/44vq6c/antic_cutlery_set/)

   * Reposting something that's still at the top of the front page

   * Awkwardly naive or child-like enthusiasm in comments, as if they're trying too hard ([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/44t0fz/took_off_in_england_landed_in_ireland/czso46h?context=3))

   * ""Magic upvotes"" on posts that have been quarantined by AutoModerator. A YouTube tutorial we found included instructions for pasting the URL of new reddit posts into a private Facebook club, where other spammers will upvote and comment on them for you

   * Comments from other suspicious users with ""wao nice pic"", ""nature beauty"", and other inane compliments

   * ""It's my cake day"" posts on accounts that aren't anywhere near a year old, yet

   * A series of rule-breaking posts (especially animations or memes) from different accounts that have no other history and are all exactly the same age

   * Posting holiday greetings on the wrong day (eg: ""Happy Valentine Day"" when it's the 15th in every time zone)

##Anti-characteristics

As important as the above are disqualifying behaviours, since there are lots of users who can exhibit the above characteristics but turn out to be false-positives anyway.

   * Meaningful comments that Google or Ctrl-F can't confirm were stolen from somewhere else

   * Pics that Google's reverse image search, or TinEye can't confirm are reposts

   * Self-purchased reddit gold

   * Multiple gilded posts or comments, especially if they cover posts spaced apart more than a few weeks

   * Trophies other than ""confirmed email"" or a yearly trophy. EG: a gilding trophy, secret-santa, ""orangered/periwinkle blue"", etc.

   * Talks and engages like a human being when directly queried in comments, private messages, distinguished removal reasons, or a ban notice

1896,"From Golem-JL on [Steam Forums](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://theguildgame.com/scenario-map-magdeburg/):

Finally! Here it is: a larger shot of the Magdeburg city map and its beautiful cathedral, which used to be one of the most impressive buildings of all eastern Germany. The city of Magdeburg itself was huge, rich and important in the late Middle Ages, but then lost a lot of its importance in the Thirty Years War (1618-1648), when the catholic troops burned down the protestant city completely in May 1631. 

Madgeburg being the place where coinage was minted (with copper from Harz), the city has known its fair share of tribulations: the city was first ruined by Boleslas in 1013, burned down in 1190 and sacked by Othon IV in 1214. But every time it bounced back up, stronger than it was before. The fertility of the lands of Börde always guaranteed the city's survival, as well as a robust commerce and trade.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail#Bail_Reform_Act_of_1966

&gt; In 1984 Congress replaced the Bail Reform Act of 1966 with new bail law, codified at United States Code, Title 18, Sections 3141-3150. The main innovation of the new law is that it allows pre-trial detention of individuals based upon their danger to the community; under prior law and traditional bail statutes in the U.S., pre-trial detention was to be based solely upon the risk of flight.

&gt; 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f) provides that only persons who fit into certain categories are subject to detention without bail: persons charged with a crime of violence, an offense for which the maximum sentence is life imprisonment or death, certain drug offenses for which the maximum offense is greater than 10 years, repeat felony offenders, or if the defendant poses a serious risk of flight, obstruction of justice, or witness tampering. There is a special hearing held to determine whether the defendant fits within these categories; anyone not within them must be admitted to bail.

- Posts generally lacking any content will be removed.
- **Posts which do not relate to Canada will be removed.**
- Posts which relate to Canada only in passing (e.g. mens rights vs womens rights arguments) will also likely be removed.

- What content is allowed on /r/Canada might change according to overall trends. For example, during the last election, it became more necessary to enforce the ""No Editorializing"" rule due to a trend of users submitting increasingly editorialized headlines.
- We will sometimes remove multiple posts along the same theme (i.e. if 5 users submit threads about Tim Hortons trying to one-up each other and they all make it to the front page) in order to diversify the content of the subreddit.
- Memes using standard images (i.e. the Fry meme, Scumbag Steve), or standard ""Canadian stereotype"" posts will generally be removed, particularly if they reach the top few posts. Again, this is mainly to encourage the submission and discussion of more important and interesting issues.

- Likewise, please try not to use clickbait headlines.
- Keep the title consistent with the overall intent of the article
- If linking to an editorial or anything being presented as an opinion, please tag the title of the threads with [Opinion] to help differentiate between that and hard news. At some point in the future we might look at using link flair for this instead. *This will likely not be enforced, but we ask that users differentiate such posts.*

- If making a post for the purposes of asking questions or holding a discussion a topic not directly related to the article in question, use a self post.

You can't just pass any bill you want if you want it to succeed. If you want to make a smaller change, like eliminating mandatory minimums, then yes. It's relatively easy (Well, ""government"" easy).

What we're talking about here is creating a regulatory framework, getting cooperation from the provinces, and taxing something that is currently a restricted product.

And, if they just waved their hands and said ""Weed is legal. You have to pay 15% GST + provincial tax"" people would be pissed they half-assed it. Because what would happen is you would have end up with a clusterfuck like the current alcohol system across Canada. You know, the [system that charges people for buying alcohol in one province where it's cheaper, to drink in another](http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/beer-battle-brews-as-n-b-man-challenges-liquor-import-law-1.2530841)?

So, the Liberals, despite having a majority at the federal level, still need to seek cooperation on the provincial level. That way, they can create a system that works across the country, and doesn't vary widely between provinces.

After they get cooperation, they then need to draft the bill. This draft doesn't go straight to parliament. Lawyers go through it over and over to make sure the government is covering its ass, and it'll survive court challenges.

Then it can go through parliament. [Here's all that has to happen to pass a bill](http://www.lop.parl.gc.ca/About/Parliament/Education/ourcountryourparliament/html_booklet/process-passing-bill-e.html).

- **We will sometimes remove multiple posts along the same theme (i.e. if 5 users submit threads about Tim Hortons trying to one-up each other and they all make it to the front page) in order to diversify the content of the subreddit.**
- Memes using standard images (i.e. the Fry meme, Scumbag Steve), or standard ""Canadian stereotype"" posts will generally be removed, particularly if they reach the top few posts. Again, this is mainly to encourage the submission and discussion of more important and interesting issues.

2089,"Thanks for your submission to /r/Canada, unfortunately your post was removed because it does not comply with the following rule(s):

##[2] Rabble-rousing:

- Posts which are intended to only stir up trouble will be removed. If you have a legitimate issue regarding 
something, please first try messaging the moderators, as we're generally more than happy to discuss things with you. If there is an issue which we feel should be discussed by the subreddit, we will then make a thread about it. Please notify us first so that we can contribute to that discussion. 

- Posts which do nothing but dismiss others and repeatedly accuse them of unfounded accusations could be subject to removal and/or banning. This includes the use of the word ""shill"" or similar adjectives used in a context meant to falsely brand someone as not worth listening to.

- We reserve the right to remove any blatantly racist, sexist or antagonistic posts. Posts that contribute nothing but attack others will likely be removed. If you use repeated hate speech or abusive language you may get a temporary ban from the community. Repeated violators will be permanently banned.

- Be reasonable and have some common sense. We shouldn't have to outline a full set of ""forbidden words"". That's silly and most of you are more than capable of determining right from wrong, honest from disingenuous.

Some Guidelines:

- Don't be rude or hostile. By choosing not to be rude, you increase the overall civility of the community and make it better for all of us.

- Don't conduct personal attacks on other users. Ad hominem and other distracting attacks do not add anything to the conversation.

- Troll. Trolling does not contribute to the conversation.

- Make posts that lack content. Phrases such as ""this"", ""lol"", and ""I came here to say this"" are not witty, original, or funny, and do not add anything to the discussion.

Please do not bring petty squabbles to us. We're not interested in interjecting ourselves in arguments that you can't win through honest discourse, and we'll be less likely to give weight to what you have to say in the future should it become a pattern.

**TL;DR: You stay classy, /r/Canada. Don't cause trouble, don't be rude. We will remove posts which do and are.**

##[7] Image Content

While images are always nice to break up the monotony of news and political threads, we decided to limit submissions because we tend to be overrun with repetitive types of 'canadian stereotype' images (i.e. facebook posts, scenery, currency, tim hortons, 'isn't it cold', 'so canadian', etc). We've also noticed that many people don't tend to downvote these sort of posts, even if they're reposts or utterly useless. For an explanation of why this might occur, please see [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/1s9247/a_few_friendly_reminders_and_slight_tweak_to/cdve8do) thread.

TD uses Carlson Marketing when you have a credit card offer on file. It's probably cheaper to outsource to an established outbound call center then either taking their own agents off the line, or hiring new agents and doing it themselves.

Rogers, Capital One, CitiFinancial, Scotiabank, Blue Cross and others uses a company called SQM Group for Quality Measurement. If you've ever called a call center, and gotten a call later on asking how you felt regarding your call, it's likely SQM Group or similar companies.

2197,"&gt; The amount charged? $126.58 CAD. Now, $53.97 USD would be $72.93. The actual charged amount comes out to $93.67 USD - a $40 USD shipping charge to send three packages from Ontario to BC, when other packages of similar size can include shipping in their prices, which themselves are less than this company's shipping costs?

What they likely did is initiate an authorization on her credit card. What that does is places a hold on funds so when they go to claim the amount, the funds are guaranteed to be there.  Take a look at this site: https://www.merchant-accounts.ca/understanding-credit-card-pre-authorizations.php

&gt; Even worse, the company refused to refund the purchase when they were contacted and told that she had not completed the sale. We had to go through the bank to reverse the charges.

They can't ""refund"" an authorization. Depending on who they use to process their credit card payments, they may be able to cancel the authorization hold on the card. Most companies either don't, or can't. After 5 days, if the merchant has not ""captured"" the funds in the authorization hold, the hold is released, and the funds are made available on the card again. If this is a VISA/Mastercard debit card, and not a regular credit card, the removal of the authorization may take longer than 5 days.

I would give it a few days. If they capture the funds, contact them again demanding a refund. If they refuse to provide one, contact your credit card company and initiate a chargeback",2016-02-27 19:36:03+00:00,d0g2bnv,1.0,t3_47x6lh,2671.0,canada

3. To prevent her from obtaining employment.

&gt; Dear MannoSlimmins
 
&gt; I am writing in response to your e-mail of September 23, 2015, regarding naturopathic doctors.
 
&gt; The term “naturopathic doctor” is a protected title in Nova Scotia under the Naturopathic Doctors Act. This means that only individuals that meet the requirements set out in this legislation can use the title “naturopathic doctor”. Several criteria are included within the legislation, including graduation from an accredited naturopathic school and successful completion of the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examination. If you would like additional information regarding criteria under the legislation you may find it through the following link, http://nslegislature.ca/legc/bills/60th_2nd/3rd_read/b177.htm.
 
&gt; Nova Scotia is one of six jurisdictions in Canada that regulates the practice of naturopathic medicine.
 
&gt; While I appreciate that naturopathic medicine is not something that you personally support, many individuals in Nova Scotia, and across Canada, access and benefit from services provided by naturopathic practitioners.
 
&gt; Thank you for taking the time to write me and for expressing your concerns.
 
&gt; Sincerely,
 
&gt; Original signed by
 
 
&gt; Leo A. Glavine
&gt; Minister

My reply is a ""tad"" hyperbolic. 

&gt; It's a damn shame that the provincial government, one of 5 others, have made fraud and preying on the sick and elderly a protected title in this province.

&gt; Now, just so I'm clear: If I want to defraud the sick and elderly in Nova Scotia, do I NEED to have gone to school to do so and obtained a title that gives a giant middle finger to the scientific process and actual, real doctors that have the education and ability to treat illnesses, or can I set up a private enterprise to defraud the sick and elderly as long as I register with the Registry of Joint Stocks and pay taxes on my fraudulent earnings.

&gt; I am extremely disappointed the NS Government and the Minister of Health have fallen for such a scam, and ignored every single piece of scientific evidence, research, studies, and actual doctors, and provided these charlatans with a title that only serves to deceive the general public.

&gt; You, sir, should be ashamed of what you and the NS government are doing. It seems you guys have fallen for the one active ingredient in homeopathic ""medicine"": Bullshit",2016-02-20 05:17:19+00:00,d06s1ur,3.0,t1_d06ryu1,193.0,canada

Coaches go to great pains not to talk shit about refs when they deserve it. And I don't blame them. If they're the only ones speaking out, they're going to get shit on worse.

But what if every GM/Coach, or at least for the teams that wont make the playoffs, came out and stated that the referees in the NHL are incompetent, and that Bettman refuses to do anything about it?

2511,"&gt; Shadowbanning is still a douchey practice. If she's broken the rules, ban her and give a reason, doing this passive-aggressive crap to real users, even shitty ones, is not only childish, 

The admins do very few shadowbans manually now that account suspensions are a thing. The *vast* majority of shadowbans come from /r/spam, and reddits automated systems that detect spam.

This happened recently in /r/nhlstreams where a user claiming to be a developer on the new Nhl.tv clusterfuck wrote what went wrong with the service from an internal POV, and somehow ended up shadowbanned after a few posts. [It was quickly resolved](http://i.imgur.com/4gr67O2.png). Usually when reporting to admins someone was shadowbanned improperly, they tell us to get them to contact the admins. This time they didn't because their system made a mistake.

So, when do admins manually shadowban people? When you submit to /r/spam and the bot doesn't catch it, you need to modmail /r/spam to get it processed manually. So, admins deal with the backlog, and hand out shadowbans to the spam accounts. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that since the transition from shadowbans for everyone, to the new suspension system, 100% of shadowbans handed out manually by the admins have been for legitimate spammers.

So Randi likely posted something that tripped up reddits spam detection system, OR she was participating in brigading/vote manipulation, and her account got whacked. All she needs to do is modmail /r/reddit.com or email contact at reddit.com and she'll have her account restored fairly quickly ",2016-02-14 06:40:34+00:00,czzc1kg,2.0,t1_czz3w1f,15913.0,KotakuInAction

2594,"&gt; If you live frugally, you can save upwards of 50% of your income even on a minimum wage.

I don't agree with all the hyperbole going on in the thread, but this statement is not true in the slightest. And I'll break down why

NS Minimum Wage: $10.6/h

37.5h/week (deducting unpaid breaks) * 10.6 is 397.5, so each pay you get 795 before taxes assuming no missed time due to illness, and no extra hours worked.

Using [T4032 Payroll Deductions Tables](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/pyrll/t4032/2015/menu-eng.html):

* $32.69 to CPP

* $14.95 to EI

* $105.20 to federal taxes

* $65.80 to provincial taxes

* Total deductions: $218.64

* Take home pay: $576.36

Assuming 2 pays in a month (Sometimes 3, but more common for 2): $1,152.72 for 160 hours of work

I live in a relatively cheap area in the HRM. My rent is $630 for a 1 bedroom. There goes 54% of my monthly takehome pay. We're already beyond ""saving upwards of 50%"" of our minimum wage paycheck.

Power rates here are absurd. My last power bill was $96 and change, so $48/month. We're now at 58%.

If you want to be frugal, ~$150 for food and you're now sitting at 71% of your take home pay gone.

You don't drive because you can't afford a vehicle and insurance, but bus passes are $78/month. We're now at 78%. Driving would be more expensive considering insurance, gas, and any breakdowns. Even an experienced driver here would be paying ~$80-85/m just for insurance.

So, if you wish to live a bare minimum lifestyle on minimum wage with 0 optional bills (Cell phone, internet service, or anything else), you can save a whole $246.72/month, or a whopping 21% of your paycheck.

But we're talking about investing here, right? Unless you're going for free ETFs, any amount of money you use for investing will get chewed up in fees. That $246.72 you started with will turn into maybe $150 in terms of investing. Especially considering you're going to have to bus it to the branch. Remember, this person is saving money by having 0 optional bills. That means no internet service. They can't use their banks online investing platforms, questrade, or anything similar. (And even then, for some platforms you need a minimum $2,000 before you can even do anything. So your money can sit in limbo for over 8.5 months)

So congrats, you made it! You managed to invest a grand total of $150/month, or 13% of your monthly take-home pay. Sure, if you try to withdraw any money from your investment, you'll likely lose the majority of it to fees, but what matters is you live a life where you live to work and absolutely nothing else, and gave the rich people 13% of your income. You lucked out! If you were a member of a church, they'd only take 10%! Could you imagine having to have a whole $34.58 each month to yourself?

2600,"&gt; I realize there's a significant amount of stuff that gets posted here that is of dubious merit. We try to exercise a light touch with the moderation so we tolerate some silly complaints from people that don't really understand what they're talking about. Like it or not, subs like this function as a kind of barometer of general user discontent. Flairing links lets people have their say, but without giving too much weight to their post. It's hardly ideal, but I believe that heavy moderation here would very likely drive the content to another sub.

Here we completely agree. It's why /r/jokes doesn't have a large mod team, and mods trying not to interfere.

&gt; Unfortunately there really are no official solutions for all but the most flagrant forms of mod abuse and our senior admin clearly has no idea about how to resolve the matter.

Also agree. The more I hear spez talk, the more concerned I become.

I don't really agree it's harassment. However, for posts like this we do have weekly threads that are pinned, and ""unlocked"". Meaning anyone, including you and anyone here, can come in, and post comments. Also, if you read the replies in that thread, it wasn't exactly a condemnation of SRC. I haven't exactly hid how I feel about some of the stuff that gets posted here, but there is enough reasonable posts I'm not going to condemn absolutely everything (See [my reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/DefaultTalk/comments/44yw03/subreddits_like_subredditcancer_undelete/cztwi4t) in that thread)

&gt; Notanestleshill has a well known vendetta against those parts of reddit that have taken any interest in transparency and mod abuse.

A lot of mods do. Including myself. But I think a lot of it is due to things I think even SRC is getting fed up with (The ""wah, i got banned from this sub for ~~breaking the rules~~ no reason"" posts you've been tagging), and users like /u/blueredscreen who ""hate mods"", but at every opportunity [beg to be modded to large subs.](http://i.imgur.com/d1dOPFf.png)

The worst of the community tends to dictate peoples perception of it, especially when the worst comes out a lot in the subs early days. I would say that while I don't really like this sub, I'll at least come here on the rare occasion /r/jokes gets posted here to provide the full context (Worked wonders so far), whereas I wouldn't venture into Blackout2015 without an extra large shill check. No matter how much a sub cleans up their image, the initial perception is always there.

&gt; Letting him post in there is one thing, but having him as a senior mod is a serious error of judgement. He has already tried repeatedly to get into our subs and shut them down and now that this has failed he's doing everything he can to destroy us from the outside.

NANS has full permissions because he's a ""delegate"" for one the subs he moderates. If you look through the mod list, you'll see the majority only have POSTS permission. Delegates get ""full access"". I'm the delegate for /r/jokes, which is why I'm there as well. As for him being a senior mod, you'd need to talk to /u/tizorres about that. But in my interactions with nestle (either in slack, or as part of the /r/jokes mod team) I haven't found anything to be concerned about.

&gt; I would not be the least bit surprised to learn that he is pestering the admins to have us shut down as well as all the stuff we know about.

If he is, he's not doing so in public channels on the slack group. I've seen him request vote-manipulation checks, and reported things that come into /r/jokes modmail (automoderator detecting phone numbers/emails/etc). Hell, while a few others have reported frankenmines new account, nestle wasn't one of them.

TL;DR: We don't agree on a lot of things. If you want to post, there's a weekly open thread with participation open to the public. Nestle is a weird guy, but i have no concerns about him",2016-02-13 01:29:39+00:00,czy0uqq,2.0,t1_czxzr21,2044.0,subredditcancer

Based on my history in cabs, it's not like cabbies really had all that much experience with the city, anyway. Why else would they opt-out of using the bridge they just drove past to use the next one, adding $20 to my cab fare? 

But seriously, the only thing I can *kind* of agree with taxi drivers is, if we do open the floodgates to Uber, more services will eventually start up. That's not bad in itself, but if you have a city with hundreds of extra taxis that are unneeded, the amount of money you'll make from driving full time is not going to be enough to support yourself and your family.

On the other hand, because the local governments have kept the amount of taxi licenses artificially low in order to jack up prices, you run into a situation where unless you know somebody looking to sell or lease their license to you, you're never going to become a taxi driver, because no spots will ever open up",2016-02-12 16:01:24+00:00,czxede5,2.0,t1_czx8vl7,9883.0,canada

2619,"&gt; From the start of it the cards were stacked against Odolecki. The state was granted a pretrial motion to removed his [Odolecki’s] mentions of Parma police misconduct that was stated in his videos. The judge granted this because it wasn’t related to the case at hand but in reality it was.  If the police weren’t violating people’s rights (which leads to lawsuits) Odolecki wouldn’t be out filming the[m].

""These roadblocks are unconstitutional because I say so, and I know better than the supreme court! My insane ramblings need to be admitted into evidence!"" 

Bitch, the state did you favour.

&gt; lso the state was allowed to show a DVD to the jury that they made showing snippets of Odolecki’s CopBlocking. Even though those clips weren’t taken on either day he was arrested but from other times out CopBlocking.

""These videos totally aren't relevant! Who cares if they show a pattern in my behavior! My behavior isn't on trial!""

Uh, yes it is. 

&gt; Furthermore, the state called the mother of the kid who had attempted suicide as a witness and she kept on about her poor, mental ill, son. Another fact that had nothing to do with the allegations against Odolecki but were more about sympathy for the police and their job that day. 

Yes. The state showed that his paranoid delusions resulted in real consequences and over-complicated an already over-complicated situation. Have *you* ever tried to console a person who is suicidal? Probably not.

&gt; All of this, and more, despite the statements by judge O’Donnell that she wouldn’t allow facts outside the scope of the charges to be heard in her courtroom.

And nothing outside the scope was shown based on your published complaints so far.

&gt; To be fair, 

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA

&gt;those weren’t the first signs that O’Donnell had a tidbit of hypocrisy in her. Odolecki’s case hinged on a freedom of speech aspect and that was the issue to be decided in court.

You would think the guys lawyer would have brought that up, then, now wouldn't he? Not sure about the states, but where I'm at, if a part of a case relies on actions that could possibly be protected by the charter, the case gets referred to the provincial supreme court, that issue is ruled on, and, if applicable, sent back to the criminal court.


&gt; Yet, I was removed from the proceedings for ‘making a face’ 

I'm sure it was just ""making a face"". If it was, i'm sure it was repeated multiple times

&gt; and  snapping a picture from the empty Justice Center hallway. 

Isn't photography forbidden in courthouses? Or just courtrooms. Were you aiming it inside the courtroom?

&gt; That’s when I was told that if I took any pictures or video I would be removed from the building. So while Odolecki and his legal team were hoping O’Donnell would uphold freedom of speech, she was oppressing it in the hallway just outside the courtroom.

""I knew photography wasn't allowed, did it anyway, then cried like a bitch when called out on it""

&gt; This brings me to ask. . . How can a building with the name Justice Center explain locking a man up for holding a sign?

He wasn't. He was preventing police from doing their jobs

&gt;  For filming cops who were in public space and did a poor job at explaining the situation (Odolecki had no idea it was a minor and a suicide attempt and might have just left he wasn’t barked at first)?

Odolecki had no right to know what the police were doing there, what they were doing,or who they were speaking with. Odolecki is full of himself. While you like to bitch and moan about your rights being violated by those evil po-pos, the police would be violating the privacy rights of the minor they were dealing with if they explained to Odolecki why he needs to shove his camera up his ass and fuck off. Last I heard, these cop-block idiots cared a lot about all forms of their privacy, but I guess they don't mind the state violating peoples privacy for youtube views.

&gt; We also know that jails weren’t built for people who hold signs and video cameras. If you believe they were than you’re part of the problem because I know I wouldn’t give my money up for such ridiculous reasons.

Great. I'm a Mennonite. We don't believe in self-defense. I know I don't want my money going to fund the military or bombing people. But, sadly, it does. It's a sad, fucked up reality, and I gotta live with that.

&gt; The CDC’s National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey added ""being made to penetrate"" as a separate category in 2010. For the 2010 and 2011 surveys, a result that surprised many commentators was that t**he 12 month prevalence of ""being made to penetrate"" for men was very close to the 12 month prevalence of rape for women.** Women make up almost 80% of the perpetrators of ""being made to penetrate"".",2016-02-10 19:04:45+00:00,czv2cbv,3.0,t1_czuwm85,7881.0,canada

2668,"&gt; Considering the tone on this subreddit about women's behaviour after non-consentual interactions, I just might.

So, you wake up, you make him breakfast. Okay, that's understandable. You feel unsafe, and do what you must to get out of the place without further abuse. No one will fault you for that.

But, after breakfast, he says he needs to go to work, and drives you home.

You're now safe, he's at work. You have 3 choices.

1. Go to the police and file a police report, and get a rape kit done ASAP.

2. Do absolutely nothing. Don't report him, just sit at home and forget it happened.

3. Keep going over to your rapists house day after day to make him breakfast until he gets tired of you, then report him to the police more than a decade later when all physical evidence is gone, and you haven't been in danger during that span of time.

When all you have is testimony about events that happened a decade before about women who say they were sexually assaulted, but kept going back to make breakfast despite being safe and having the ability to report the person to prevent further abuse, you can't blame society, or even the justice system, and consider the accused to be innocent",2016-02-10 18:47:43+00:00,czv1lew,3.0,t1_czuy9dj,4545.0,canada

2670,"&gt; I'd expect it would be about $20 a gram

Well, I'm willing to bet that the price will differ depending on the province. If you live in a province with a high tobacco tax ([Taxes by province as of October, 2015](http://www.smoke-free.ca/factsheets/pdf/taxrates.pdf)), you'll likely end up paying more for weed.

&gt; with heavy fines for ""unregulated"" marijuana.

Just made another comment in this post regarding that, actually. I'm assuming that marijuana is going to be regulated similar to tobacco, and either a different section will be added to the excise act, or section 220 will be modified to allow personal growth exceptions, though limiting on how much you can grow based on family size

&gt; 220 A person who grows tobacco on his own land or property and manufactures the tobacco into common Canada twist or cut tobacco solely for the use of himself and such members of his family as are resident with him on the farm or premises on which the tobacco was grown, and not for sale, does not require a licence for so doing, nor is the tobacco so manufactured subject to excise duty, but the quantity so manufactured in any one year shall not exceed fifteen kilograms (15 kg) for each adult member of the family resident on the farm or premises.",2016-02-10 18:18:37+00:00,czv0bh6,4.0,t1_czv04ip,255.0,canada

Pot is going to be legalized, and it should be – but the new regime will not be a free-for-all. As with alcohol and cigarettes, that means regulation to keep pot out of the hands of minors, taxation and public education campaigns to discourage use.

They forget to add that while it'll be possible to grow your own (for personal use), you'll likely be limited in how much you can grow based on the size of your family, [similar to tobacco.](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/e-14/page-61.html)

I got my mom involved in getting her to a doctor without any wait (My moms worked for half the doctors in the city. Connections :P), and got her shortlisted for a good therapist.

I didn't like her, but I spent days that I should have been looking for work, cancelled a job interview last minute due to her issues, and worked my ass off to make sure she had a support network here, had a reliable therapist, and was sticking with her medications. I did that because while it benefited her, it benefited my friend and his kid. Lessening her at-home issues made life better for them.

Then she wanted to throw all that away to move to another city last minute, walk out on their lease, leave her therapist, her new family doctor, and go to a city where there she had none of that. Friend would still have his job as he could just transfer to a different store.

We got into a fight. Told him if he left, he would lose his girlfriend, his kids, and he'd be living paycheck to paycheck paying for his own crappy apartment and supporting someone who didn't want to get better.

And, what do you know: 6 months later, she was pregnant again, left him, took the kid, gives him no custody unless she's running off with some other guy and needs ""privacy"". She's off her meds, has no family doctor, no therapist, no mental health care whatsoever.

&gt; I can't believe nobody stopped to think that an org created for that purpose might not produce fair and unbiased results.

Especially after the issue in the states where 1 single lab worker was caught lying about results, and put into question every single result they had. Which was tens of thousands of cases.

Now, if you're sitting in prison on drug related charges, your lawyer is going to look at this and go straight to court to get a retrial. And that's exactly [what is happening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Dookhan#Impact).

&gt; In January 2015, Benjamin Keehn, a prominent defense attorney with the Committee for Public Counsel Services, said that as many as 40,000 people could have been falsely convicted as a result of Dookhan's actions

&gt; In May 2015, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that defendants whose convictions on drug charges were based on evidence potentially tainted by disgraced former state chemist Annie Dookhan can pursue retrials without having to face more charges or tougher sentences

Under the Torrens-style land registration system that operates in this Province, title by adverse possession cannot be acquired once a certificate of title has been issued. Nor can adverse possession give rise to title in respect of Crown lands. 65 66

In Nova Scotia:

&gt; In plain language that means you must be using the land in a visible and public way that is known in the community where the land is located. **If you are claiming to own land that belongs to the province, you must have total control of the land and you must be able to show that you or others who used and occupied the land before you have been on the land for a total period of 40 years without any breaks in time**. Your activities on the land must demonstrate that you believe that the land is yours and that the person with the deed to the land has no right to the land. **If you are claiming land owned by a private individual, you need to show 20 years of continuous use and occupation.**

The problem with that is they don't just spam your sub. They spam many different subs.

There have been many occasions where I've sent either a single account or multiple accounts to /r/awww mentioning they were spammers using the sub as a way to pad their karma.

While I don't expect the mods there to police every single post (Which may not even be a possibility), had they caught these accounts and noticed that many usernames with the same format were only posting there, they could have put a stop to it, and even sent a quick modmail to /r/reddit.com to prevent spam elsewhere.

Especially after the issue in the states where 1 single lab worker was caught lying about results, and put into question every single result they had. Which was tens of thousands of cases.

Now, if you're sitting in prison on drug related charges, your lawyer is going to look at this and go straight to court to get a retrial. And that's exactly [what is happening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Dookhan#Impact).

&gt; In January 2015, Benjamin Keehn, a prominent defense attorney with the Committee for Public Counsel Services, said that as many as 40,000 people could have been falsely convicted as a result of Dookhan's actions

&gt; In May 2015, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that defendants whose convictions on drug charges were based on evidence potentially tainted by disgraced former state chemist Annie Dookhan can pursue retrials without having to face more charges or tougher sentences

2920,"I don't think that someone with a history of depression should be able to go to the doctor, get the prescription to end their life (or appointment), and that's that. Take sexual reassignment surgery as an example. It's a long process to go through before you can go under the knife. On top of the hormone therapy, there's also the fact that in most places, you need to go through counselling first to make sure this is something you really want, and won't regret.

I think that if you suffer from depression that is resistant to therapy, resistant to drugs, and a combo of both, then you should have to go through a long period of psychotherapy with weekly followups at the latest. If, at the end, they can't make progress, and the person still wants to take their own life, then it should be allowed.

I think that everyone should have control over their bodies and their life. If someone wants to end their life, they should be allowed to do so humanely. But for the government to fund the medication that will take your life, the very least we can do is ensure that those who do wish to end it at least has to go through a process to ensure that it's what they want.

&gt; It's possible that if we create research programs to give these individuals with no hope a possibility to help future hopeless individuals, it'll give them a purpose. 

Speaking from experience, there's probably not much you can do long-term to make someone reconsider.

3144,"&gt; Here's an analogy which might make this point a bit more clear: suppose I open up a club in an area with high amounts of racism against a particular group. I make it clear that people of any race are welcome there, but, **if a person of race A chooses to harass or even physically abuse a person of race B, then I won't do anything about it**. I won't kick them out of the club, I won't point them out to police, I won't even tell them to stop. People of race B, even if they aren't explicitly banned from the club, are unlikely to go there, even if they're interested in any other benefits it might have, because they'd be silly to want to put themselves at risk. They have essentially been forced out of this club. Do you see what I mean?

Your analogy completely fails in context to /r/jokes. From the /r/jokes sidebar:

&gt; Personal attacks will not be tolerated. 

We hand out bans for first time offenders for those who attack individuals and depending on the severity, have contacted admins in the past about it.

3157,"&gt;  In New Jersey, Ronald Ottaviano’s company offered a debt elimination plan that purported to draw money from a secret bank account maintained by the U.S. Treasury in each citizen’s name. Potential customers were told that these fabricated accounts were set up to allow the government to borrow against each citizen’s earnings, and that individuals who file the right papers can gain access to the accounts. After his own employees turned him in, Ottaviano defended himself against charges of fraud, money laundering and tax evasion. He told the court that he didn’t believe he was subject to U.S. taxes.

3177,"&gt; I'm not sure why you have this policy of not removing jokes based on content

Because we don't feel we should be the arbiters of what is humor and what is not. What is funny to me may not be funny to you. I have a dry sense of humor that doesn't work well with everyone. If I removed everything I didn't find funny, or everything I found offensive, there would only be the few jokes left that I got a chuckle at. I also like Mennonite Jokes, which are [somehow even drier than dry jokes.](http://www.mennojoke.com/).

But what if /u/notanestleshill has a different sense of humor than me and starts deleting jokes that I liked?

Our main rule, what what we ask every mod to bring on to follow, is ""if it's a joke, it stays"". It doesn't need to be a good joke. And in the case of when I post Mennonite jokes, it doesn't have to be the funniest thing ever. Each joke can stand on its own merit.

&gt; Jokes that encourage hatred towards specific groups, especially socially disadvantaged groups, are only really funny if you're not the one being made fun of.

So, joking about certain groups of people or certain topics is off limits, 100% of the time? Who gets to decide what groups get to be joke-free?

&gt; There are plenty of funnier jokes that don't feed into tired and harmful stereotypes or encourage hatred and bigotry

Oddly enough, when the economy was doing well, I struggled a lot. Now that the dollar has gone to shit, I'm doing pretty good. Managed to get a lot of debt paid off, and have started putting a small bit of money aside",2016-01-17 15:56:25+00:00,cz1kpyi,1.0,t3_41c5ur,38874.0,canada

The fact we re-signed the goalie coaches makes me want to puke. They obviously can't do anything with Pavs or Hutch, as there was little progress (Or, in the case of Hutch, huge regression), and fucking hell, if they ruin Hellboy, they need to be sacrificed or something.

Intent doesn't really factor in to it until supplemental discipline comes into play. And even then it matters little. He did what he did, and he needs to be in control of his body and his stick.

https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/40oivr/so_what_did_that_joke_about_3_mods_walking_into_a/cyvwqyt


The joke said exactly the same thing as it does now.

The humour of the [""3 mods walk into a bar"" joke](/r/Jokes/comments/40lhzp/3_mods_walk_into_a_bar/) was in how the body of the post always was ""[deleted]"", something which implied that a moderator had deleted the rest of the joke. The joke was then in this form upvoted quite highly. 

Once they saw it, the mods then played along with the joke by deleting all the comments, locking the thread to prevent further comments (other than those made by mods), and flairing it 'removed'. In addition, they also [stickied a mod's comment of a link to a gif](/r/Jokes/comments/40lhzp/3_mods_walk_into_a_bar/cyvu57n) from the subreddit /r/modgifs, which spawned a little thread of moderators continuing the joke. That [gif](http://gfycat.com/UnlawfulIncompatibleIndianjackal) is from the film 'The Boondock Saints', but with the addition of altered subtitling to make it relevant to moderation, although with comical exaggeration. The post itself was not removed, something that can be seen by how it can be found [by searching](/r/Jokes/search?q=%223+mods+walk+into+a+bar%22&amp;amp;amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;amp;amp;sort=relevance&amp;amp;amp;amp;t=all), as well as its continued presence on /r/jokes.

This was not, however, simply a spur-of-the-moment decision on the part of the mods. Essentially identical jokes [show up with quite some regularity](/r/Jokes/search?q=deleted+OR+removed&amp;amp;amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;amp;amp;sort=relevance&amp;amp;amp;amp;t=all) on /r/jokes. Earlier, for example, when one [such](/r/Jokes/comments/3gm7qp/i_wrote_a_haiku_about_admins_and_mods/) was posted around five months before, many people had suggested to the mods [such as with this report](/r/Jokes/comments/3gm7qp/i_wrote_a_haiku_about_admins_and_mods/ctzxsgi) that they should remove that thread, as doing so would be funny. When so similar a joke cropped up again, on this particular occasion, they decided to have fun with it.",2016-01-13 02:54:22+00:00,cyw64fk,5.0,t1_cyw6256,99.0,hockey

Right now, I love Nik Ehlers. But currently, he doesn't have much of that ""star power"" on the team. Will he eventually? Maybe, if he can start scoring more. Same can be said for Hellebuyck. He's kicking ass right now, but what about next season? Or the seasons after? We still don't know what to expect from him in the future. So right now, Nik and Connor are only one small part of the team. Players like Ladd, Wheeler, Little, and Byfuglin are what defines the Jets as a whole.

Ingredients:  

* 3 eggs  
* 3/4 cup sugar  
* 1/2 cup applesauce  
* 1 cup sifted flour  
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder  
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda  
* 1/4 teaspoon salt   
* 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon  
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves (optional)  
* 1/2 cup chopped walnuts  
* Powdered sugar (icing sugar) for dusting 

Filling:

* 12 oz. of cream cheese  
* 1/4 cup sugar  
* 4 tablespoons milk 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees

Beat eggs till thick.

Gradually add sugar beating well.

Add 1/2 cup applesauce.

Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt &amp; cloves.

Fold into egg mixture along with the walnuts.

Spread in greased and floured 15 x 10 x 1 jelly roll pan. I updated this step and used parchment paper that I lightly greased.

Bake in 350 degree oven for 15-20 minutes.

Immediately loosen sides and invert onto a kitchen towel.

Pull parchment paper off and cover with powdered sugar.

Roll the cake in the towel and let it cool completely. It will be a nicer roll if you roll it on the short side.

Prepare the filling by beating the cream cheese, sugar and milk together till smooth.

When the cake has cooled unfold it and spread the filling evenly on the cake.

Roll the cake again carefully, discarding the towel.

Wrap the whole cake with foil (I sprayed the foil with cooking spray) and freeze. This will make it easy to cut when ready to serve.

When ready to serve, unwrap the cake, dust with powdered sugar (icing sugar) cut slices and serve with ice cream or whip cream. ",2016-01-04 16:15:53+00:00,cylm3oe,1.0,t3_3zepuy,10959.0,winnipegjets

Hellboy will get most of the starts, with a possibility of doing a goalie rotation like we had with Pav-Hutch, as long as pavs can play well.

Hutch will sit out the remainder of the season until his contract expires and he parts way with the Jets.

The only way I see us re-signing Hutch is if every game after tonight he gets a shutout, we make the playoffs, and win the cup with every game being a Hutch shutout.

3748,"&gt; I would very much want to hear whether these mod tools are considered enough

Well, I mod 2 seperate defaults (/r/jokes, /r/sports  ) and a few smaller ones. Thread locking, modmail muting, and sticky comments make the job a lot easier, even if the subs I'm in don't need to use them all that often.

I think that, while there are still other tools that would be great to have, the above list is a very good start.

As for communications from the admins: Previously, it was hit or miss if you would even get a reply. Now, at the very least, they'll let you know that they're looking into the issue, though they don't always say what they're doing about it (And that's fine, they wont discuss what punishments they hand out to others). They are more responsive to answering questions in modmail about policy.

So yes. I think that it's a good start. There's still a lot of room for improvement, but with the deadline coming and going, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt because of the changes that have already happened",2015-12-31 16:06:33+00:00,cyhdddl,3.0,t1_cyh75c1,18087.0,AskReddit

I'll always give Hutch another chance. Last game made me have more confidence in him. But, I still think that unless his game dramatically improves, chevy shouldn't re-sign him after this season. 

I know Pavs is streaky, but Hellboy has only looked bad in one game so far, and I think he deserves the chance to advance to the NHL permanently. The question is, will it be next season and we don't re-sign hutch, or will it be 2016-2017, and we don't re-sign pavs.

So, some simple math: This guy is 94 years old. He came here when he was 2. So, he's been living in what is now Canada for 92 years or since 1923.

Any British subject living in Canada for 20 years prior to 1947 was automatically a Canadian citizen.

A murder conviction for someone that falls under the Youth Criminal Justice Act will face 10 years. 6 years in custody + 4 years under conditional supervision.

IANAL, but i'll assume breaking the conditions of the supervision is an offense under the act, punishable by more time in custody.

4055,"My community: I'm actually outside of a Mennonite community at the moment. I live in an apartment building where my neighbors are non-mennonites. The closest Mennonites to me that I'm aware of is a 20 minute drive away, and they are pastors in a church funded by the Mennonite Brethren Church (MBC) but the church itself is non-denominational (Mennonites do not seek converts to their religion).

The community I'm from: The community I'm from has changed a lot since I left, and is one of the fastest growing areas in Manitoba. A place called Steinbach, Manitoba. The community itself was made up of mostly ""new order"" or ""modern"" Mennonites. These types of Mennonites are almost indistinguishable from everyone else. They dress modern, they use modern appliances, cars, computers, internet, etc. What sets them apart from, say, a catholic or a protestant, is their belief in Mennonite teachings: Plainness (May have modern clothes, but they are typically not flashy), non-violence, and non-resistance (Meaning, even in the situation where your life is threatened, you may not defend yourself using violence.) amungst other teachings (Here is a[ decent list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schleitheim_Confession) of anabaptist beliefs).

The community my grandparents come from: I'll start this part by saying my mother was the first in my family to be what is considered a new order or modern mennonite. My (edit:Grand)parents are ""Old Order"" mennonites. I can't say I know a lot about how Old Order Mennonite communities work beyond what was explained to me. Essentially, Old Order communities think about technology in the following way: ""Will using this technology bring someone closer to, or drive them away from God"". You will find some communities, like the one I spent some time at here in Nova Scotia, that have computers, electricity, and cell phones. However, they are not allowed internet service. The reason for this is the community felt that computers can help with bringing someone closer to their faith/God, but with the internet comes too much temptation for one person, and so that is forbidden because it will make someone stray from their faith/God.

Other communities do not allow cell phones, or computers. In my *limited* experience visiting Old Order communities across Canada is different communities come to different conclusions. Not one I've met has allowed the internet, however.

Sorry if this was kind of long. But it is a basic breakdown of my knowledge of the differences between old order and new order communities",2015-12-20 02:45:54+00:00,cy53v97,8.0,t1_cy53ifh,627.0,funny

4323,"&gt; I think the threat is overblown because he didn't even care about the other 2 in the video once he got a hold the one.

The other two were in compliance. As long as they remained that way, there is a completely different set of rules. If someone is resisting, you use force to make the arrest. If someone is complying, you don't throw them to the ground or use force at all. If the officer used force on the two that were in compliance, instead of giving directions verbally to finish off the arrest, he deserves to be fired

As for the ""flinching"". If you look in the video (and read the article), she refuses to take her hands out of her pockets

&gt; Plamondon ordered the girl, [bullshit removed], to get her hands out of her pockets. She refused, and he approached her with handcuffs.  

That's not a ""Take your hands out of your pockets because i'm being petty"" order. That's a ""take your hands out of your pockets, because i'm [within 35 feet of you](http://www.policemag.com/channel/patrol/articles/2007/10/rethinking-the-21-foot-rule.aspx), and I don't know if you have a knife"" order.",2015-12-15 18:41:04+00:00,cy00n8u,11.0,t1_cy0091z,553.0,canada

Right. And, as a cop, when they are placing somebody under arrest that is resisting, they need to determine if force is necessary to make the suspect comply and if so, how much force.

So yes, the cop got away with assaulting somebody.... because that somebody was a suspect who was placed under arrest, and resisted. It's an unfortunate part of their job",2015-12-15 18:19:26+00:00,cxzzpze,9.0,t1_cxzvptt,5681.0,canada

Probably last season while Hutch was on a roll. I wont underplay the role Hutch had in helping us make the playoffs, and the role he had in lighting a fire under Pavelecs ass.

4333,"&gt; Even with all of that cap space – and a potential buyout of Ondrej Pavelec’s $3.9 million cap hit thanks to the fantastic play of Connor Hellebucyk – that’s a lot of money to tie up in four players.

Why are people suggesting we buy out Pavelec? Yes, he's a *very* streaky goalie. But if we're going to base it off how they have been playing this season, I'd keep Pavelec and get rid of Hutch

Also, if we end up trading Buff, I'll be sad as fuck. I'll probably even cry a little the first time we play against him. While Ladd is our captain, I feel Big Buff is a much bigger part of the team.

I understand the reasons for trading him (Better to trade and get something in return than have him walk and get nothing), but if it does happen, I'll be incredibly sad",2015-12-15 16:15:16+00:00,cxzui77,1.0,t3_3wy9oy,1432.0,winnipegjets

4540,"Well, if you don't get the job, or are looking for a weekend job, I know my weekend job has positions in Winnipeg. I could see if they're looking for people there. (This goes to anyone here, btw.)

There are benefits, and setbacks. One big benefit is, as long as you get your work turned in before the deadline, you get to set your hours. You set when you go out and work. So if you work mon-fri, you can do it sat/sun.

Bad part is, depending at how fast you learn the system, you can get the job done fairly quickly. I was only getting 6-8 hours my first few weeks before i had to force myself to slow down and take more time. Now I'm doing about 20-25 hours/week.

They pay for your mileage and travel time after the first 30 minutes. If you bus, they pay your bus fare, and travel time after 30 minutes. So if it's an hour both ways, you get 1.5 hours of pay for travel time + mileage or bus fare (both ways).

The bad part is, if you take the bus, you have to submit paperwork. It's annoying, so I don't bother with it. I lose about $40/pay ($20 bus fare, ~20 travel time). If you drive, it's just a checkbox when you submit it.

The job is also pretty mundane, so i've found a way to ""automate"" it. 

Anyways, if you don't get your job, or want a weekend job, send me a message and i'll check our availability for ya",2015-12-07 22:40:37+00:00,cxqt56t,2.0,t1_cxqr6kj,2856.0,winnipegjets

No, actually. Those colleges like everest are actually really damn expensive, especially for the education you are given. The teachers in the class hardly understand the subjects they are teaching.

Do you have a criminal record? Well, if you try going to college for a certification/degree in a market that requires a clean criminal record, the college is going to deny you.

When people found out what apartment I was in, they started knocking on my door. Thats one of the biggest reasons why I switched to an ecig, and planning on dropping that soon. As soon as people found out I wasn't buying smokes any more, no one talks to me again.

There are certainly good things to come out of GamerGate, which certainly has my support, but there's also a lot of bullshit. Turning it into another ""us vs them"" fight is, to me, the worst thing they could do. However, if a consumer rights issue comes along, I'll certainly become involved again.

During the time where I was more into GG, I decided to do something beyond being a ""keyboard warrior"" and actually try to make some positive change. For the past 12 months, I've been in regular contact with my MLA (Canada) to change the consumer protection laws in the province. Right now there are a lot of good protections for online purchases (14 days to return with full refund, the right to chargeback with no penalty if refund is not provided within that timeframe, etc), but it specifically excludes digital downloads.

So what I'm trying to convince my provincial government to do is keep the exclusion for digital downloads, unless the digital download is a ""license"". For instance, with Steam, PSN, Xbox, etc they can take away your purchases at any time. When you get refunded, it also means losing access to the games/movies/etc that you purchased, even if they were already downloaded.",2015-12-05 18:09:20+00:00,cxo7xuc,7.0,t1_cxo7hv5,793.0,SubredditDrama

This is his reply:

&gt; Dear MannoSlimmins:
 
&gt; I am writing in response to your e-mail of September 23, 2015, regarding naturopathic doctors.
 
&gt; The term “naturopathic doctor” is a protected title in Nova Scotia under the Naturopathic Doctors Act. This means that only individuals that meet the requirements set out in this legislation can use the title “naturopathic doctor”. Several criteria are included within the legislation, including graduation from an accredited naturopathic school and successful completion of the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examination. If you would like additional information regarding criteria under the legislation you may find it through the following link, http://nslegislature.ca/legc/bills/60th_2nd/3rd_read/b177.htm.
 
&gt; Nova Scotia is one of six jurisdictions in Canada that regulates the practice of naturopathic medicine.
 
&gt; While I appreciate that naturopathic medicine is not something that you personally support, many individuals in Nova Scotia, and across Canada, access and benefit from services provided by naturopathic practitioners.
 
&gt; Thank you for taking the time to write me and for expressing your concerns.
 
&gt; Sincerely,

&gt; Leo A. Glavine",2015-12-04 11:13:59+00:00,cxmt8ll,5.0,t1_cxm6ntk,46656.0,canada

4872,"Breaking the promise would be not doing it. For instance, if they only decriminalized marijuana, and didn't bother taxing it, or making it legal, it would be breaking their promise.

When new information comes along that requires you to revise your statements or promises, it's not ""breaking a promise"" just like it's not lying. If you say that the new cancer drug announced has shown to be 100% effective, and then it comes out later that the researches completely fabricated their findings, would that make you a liar? No. You would take that information, and you would revise your future statements about that drug. It means you were working with faulty data.

Trudeau was working with one set of data during the election campaign. Based on the information he and his advisers had, he made the promise that they would bring in x amount of refugees by December 31^st, 2015 11:59:59pm. Trudeau has since won the election, and his government now has access to information they did not have while making those promises. He takes that information, and he revises his statements, and his promises.

Now, if Trudeau said ""We just got new intel, and have decided we aren't taking *any* refugees"", then yes. He would be breaking his promise. If Trudeau waiting until January 1^st to revise his statement and promises that he would bring in x amount of refugees by December 31^st, 2015 11:59:59pm saying they need an extra 2 months, then yes. I can call that breaking his promise. He had access to the information he needed, and waiting until after the deadline to say he needs more time. Plus, it would have becoming very apparent that his timetable was unrealistic long before the deadline.

In this case, he revised his promises within a reasonable timeframe (He's been in office less than a month) when new information became available.

4988,"&gt; The shadowban could very well be an accident and if it was, you kinda ruined the guy's user history.

Depends on how they do it. The admins can set it so that those comments/submissions are not visible, similar to how a mod would remove a post/comment from their sub. The trickier part would be if it was by mistake, how they would be re-approved. One option could be when shadowbanning, their post history is filtered, so it requires manual mod approval or removal. That way at least legitimate content stays up, even during the shadowbanned period.

The other option is they could flag the removal as done by the admins, and if they re-instate an account, anything flagged as removed by admins would be re-approved.

In past wars, we blasted our way into militants' hideouts, displaced thousands of civilians, reduced towns to rubble with artillery, used inaccurate aerial bombardment in order to get a few enemy fighters. Now we use a single drone strike against a single house!

Yes, sometimes we hit the wrong house, but by any historical comparison the rate of civilian deaths has plummeted because of drones. Civilian deaths were once considered an inevitable by-product of war. Today, if we accidently kill 5 civilians in a drone strike, it's the front page of every newspaper in the world. 5 civilian deaths in Vietnam, Korea, WW2...wouldn't have caused a ripple!

I work two jobs. None of which provide health insurance.

Considering it's a minimum $80 just to see a dentist, it's not exactly something I can afford.

Glasses? Well, I've been without for 10 years. With the second job, I can get some cheap frames, and I can likely convince my family doctor to get me a prescription due to headaches, which means my eye test will be covered by MSI. So after that it's just the cost of frames/lenses.

Though I'll concede it's still pretty early in the day. Though, looking at their [traffic stats](https://www.reddit.com/r/mensrights/about/traffic/), it doesn't seem to get all that much traffic, even for a sub of their size.

For comparison, I'll use /r/sysadmin, which is similar in subscriber count and has open traffic stats:

Uniques by month:  
MR: Highest just under 350k unique  
SA: Excluding the one really high month, they are all low 400k

Uniques per hour  
MR: Highest tops out at just a bit over 1k uniques in a 1-hour period  
SR: With exception of weekends, averages 2.5-3k uniques in a 1 hour period  

Low-High new subcribers:  
MR: 44-166 new subscribers per day  
SR: 55-173 new subscribers per day.

Why make the comparison? Because people seem to make a big boogeyman out of /r/mensrights, just like their ideological opposites tend to make a boogeyman out of /r/shitredditsays. Both of those subs are, essentially, toothless. One has a higher subscriber count, but doesn't see a lot of traffic comparable to other subs of similar size, and the other is a neutered version of its former self.

* A case saying women can indeed be tried as rapists. Not sure how that's bad.  
* Article about male suicide rate. The horror!  
* Article about how only boys in singapore get physical punishment, and girls dont  
* This article crossposted, to be expected  
* Guy protesting alimony. Meh.  
* another version of this article, but with a more appropriate title.  
* an article about someone caring about mens rights getting laughed out of parliament. Meh  
* article on shelters for males suffering from domestic abuse.   
* video on a woman physically abusing her boyfriend and withholding his daughter from him. Sounds like he could read that article on shelters for men I mentioned above.  
* A guardian article titled ""men are pretty terrible people"".   
* A guy seeking advice about his abusive ex-girlfriend that contacted him again claiming to be pregnant  
* female judge telling a guy he's going to get raped in jail every day

* woman making false rape claims escaping jail

6010,"&gt; I think there's a good reason to push for a gender-equal cabinet

Pushing for it is one thing, forcing it is another. A party going out of their way to get qualified women running for their party so they gain cabinet positions they are qualified for is one thing. Telling someone who is qualified ""Sorry, we had to choose her for the quotas"" is another. It's also sexist against women. How would most women feel knowing the only reason they won something was because they are female, and not because they earned it?

&gt; It's been shown that women have a harder time seeing themselves in politics and voters are averse to women candidates

At yet we have a record amount of female MPs that will sit when Parliament resumes.

&gt; partially because there are not enough women in prominent positions setting the example. 

Which is why parties should be trying to get qualified women to run in the nomination process, and then if they win, run for the Liberals/NDP/their party in the election.

&gt; We end up with a catch-22: women don't see themselves as fitting in to politics, so they don't run, and politics doesn't change.

So, use sexism to fight sexism. 

&gt; This government has roughly 50 female MP's

[Exactly 50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_42nd_Canadian_Parliament), most of any party. 47.6% of all female MPs are in the Liberal party.

&gt; and it's expected to be easy for them to find the ~13 qualified enough to fill half the cabinet.

If the Liberals can get a 50/50 cabinet using the best candidates, then all the best to them. They shouldn't, however, be using the 50/50 as a quota, but as an ideal situation",2015-10-26 17:02:43+00:00,cwdja5a,4.0,t1_cwdizx6,414.0,canada

&gt; The Criminal Code of Canada continues to be used as a means to address the issue of FGM. For example, it can be used to control the transportation of female children outside the country for the purposes of obtaining FGM.[28] Canada has recognized fear of gender persecution as a ground for claiming refugee status since the early 1990s. In May 1994, the Immigration and Refugee Board granted refugee status to a woman whose 10-year-old daughter would have been subjected to FGM if she had been forced to return to her country of origin.[29]

&gt; As a result of the growing recognition of FGM as a violation of human rights, in October 1994, the then Ministry of the Solicitor General and Correctional Services[30] issued a memorandum to all Chiefs of Police and the Commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police, explaining that FGM is a criminal offence, and informing them of the investigative and charging procedures for offences related to FGM. The Ministry of the Attorney General also sent a memorandum to all Crown Attorneys on the prosecution of charges related to FGM.

FGM: The Canadian government considers it a human rights issue. Teachers, social workers, hospital staff, etc, all have a duty to report FGM, as it's considered child abuse. But circumcision? Nah, that's alright",2015-10-26 05:01:18+00:00,cwd2oyl,7.0,t1_cwd2m6o,196.0,canada

6108,"Canada has multiple ""outs"" to our constitution ""The Charter of Rights and Freedoms).

The very first section of the charter states:

&gt; The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it **subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society**.

So, our free speech rights aren't as strong as in the U.S. For instance, in the U.S, you can have people like Hal Turner calling for the lynching of black people on his radio show, but in Canada that will get you thrown in front of the Human Rights Tribunal.

We also have the notwithstanding clause of the charter where the provinces can basically give a giant middle finger to the federal government, and pass laws contrary to charter rights.

We do not have a right to bear arms, or even to bare arms (Get it?). See: http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/is-gun-ownership-a-legal-right-in-canada-1.2723893

So, to finally answer your question: We have a right to free speech, but A) It's not as strong as the protections in the U.S and B) It's not the first, but the second part. So they are also wrong on two counts. We do not have a constitutional right to own guns.

And I think the reason for that difference between us is how we gained ""independence"" from Britain. The U.S won independence through revolution, Canada earned independence through bloodshed in the World Wars. Without Canadas exemplary record in WW1 and especially WW2, I doubt we would have the autonomy we do today. Yes, technically the Queen is still our head of state. But the Monarchy exercises no power over Canadian legislation, and the Governor General, the Queens representative, is appointed by the Prime Minister and follows the PMs ""suggestions"" unless they are blatantly unconstitutional.",2015-10-25 03:30:53+00:00,cwbujnj,4.0,t1_cwbu924,619.0,ProtectAndServe

I'm not anti-cop, but I agree that cops caught abusing their power should face stricter punishment than what a normal citizen would face, even if it's just adding on a breach of public trust charge. But I don't hate all cops for it.

I don't hate SCs for exercising valid rights, but I'll laugh when they make up random crap.

But, I'm also somebody who would rather take the path of least resistance. For instance, this recent election in Canada, elections laws had changed, and there was a larger burden placed on voters to identify themselves. You could either use a picture ID, or 2 non-photo ID's from a list of valid identification cards or bills. I advocated people bring their photo ID because it has all the information they need, plus the photo, and it takes them 2 seconds. It takes a bit longer with multiple IDs. After being delayed by a single person for 5+ minutes while waiting in line, and getting through in seconds because of Photo ID, I figured it would be best to not delay voters. Others get pissy when you mention photo ID and voting, saying it wasn't required.

Strangist version of the [Mennonite Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCmmrHK4HNk) I've ever played). Got into the church, and you see the Men sitting on the left, and the women sitting on the right. As service hadn't started yet, I asked the guy who invited me what was going on. The Mennonite churches I had attended had men and women sitting together.

While Mennonites in general take the bible more literally than some christian religions, the Old Order take it ***very*** literally. And this guy was prepared for the question. He mentioned some verse or other (I believe 1 Timothy 2:11-15 based on google search), and said the church interprets it as separate seating, though some women will leave part-way through the service to teach kids at sunday school.

The exception to this was while they were singing. While Women weren't permitted to speak during the service, they could sing.

6246,"&gt; which has lead to an increase of crime.

Wut? Maybe an increase in unsolved crime.

All types of crime have been falling since the mid-90's, with the exception of ""other crimes"", which saw a very small increase in the LATE 90's, but is still at the lowest levels since 1980.

Violent crime is decreasing, just not as fast as other crimes. Both murder and attempted murder are at nearly half what they were in 90's at their peak.


 Property crimes have taken several dramatic dips since its peak in the early 90s, and is at the same levels as it was in the late 60's.

Overall, crime is decreasing.

Source: [StatsCanada - Canada's crime rate: Two decades of decline](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-630-x/11-630-x2015001-eng.htm)


&gt; Several factors commonly mentioned by experts as possible explanations for the decline in crime may be related primarily to certain types of crime. For example, multivariate analysis performed by the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics indicated that changes in inflation tend to have the most association with changes in crime that is financially motivated (i.e., robbery, break and enter, motor vehicle theft), while changes in alcohol consumption and unemployment rates are correlated with changes in the homicide rate, and changes in the population's age and gender are associated with changes in the rate of break and enters.

&gt; As well, legislative changes introduced in Canada—such as amendments to the Criminal Code regarding sexual assault and the Young Offenders Act, which was followed by the Youth Criminal Justice Act on April 1, 2003 (Department of Justice)—have the potential to affect crime rates by expanding definitions and criminalizing certain behaviours not previously considered a crime, or by decriminalizing others.",2015-10-21 16:40:34+00:00,cw7rke0,4.0,t1_cw7o7or,4822.0,canada

6256,"Well, apparently in Vancouver where they have dispenseries already (Because of course they do), the cost of weed is very similar to what blackmarket rates are.

You need to remember that blackmarket means higher prices. The person that grew the weed needs to make his money back, which means they will need to price the product assuming a portion of it is going to be seized. Of course, they're also going to price it to also generate a profit.

So, with that risk gone, the price goes way down. But, it's also taxed at a similar rate to tobacco products, so the price needs to reflect that.

So, what you end up with is legal weed priced similarly to black market rates, but instead of that money going to organized crime, it goes to small business owners (and their employees), and the taxes go fund social programs, infrastructure renewal, and more.",2015-10-21 15:00:00+00:00,cw7nf4i,4.0,t1_cw6slrs,67025.0,winnipegjets

Oh, as for piracy. Until TPP gets passed, the only criminal charges related to IP piracy are for commercial operations. Except TPP has a fucked up view of ""commercial operations"", and according to KEI ""TPP has criminal sanctions for copyright infringement on commercial scale, even when not carried out for commercial advantage or financial gain""

Or how about patents for ""new uses for known products""? Here's an extreme example: Ibuprofin (known product) re-patented for blood thinning properties (new uses).

I guess we should be happy, though. After all, according to the Aussie government FAQ on the TPP, the IP chapter of the TPP isn't covered by the Corporate Sovereignty provisions.

6785,"&gt; I think the national anthem is important and should be about Canada and our national heritage

Completely agree. But as Hero of Brandon pointed out, sporting events are one of the few places you hear the anthem anymore. You hear it in school until the end of high school, and then maybe once or twice a year at Canada Day and Remembrance Day if you attend the ceremonies or watch it on TV.

Having something like this allows fans to become part of an anthem that is slowly becoming extinct outside few select dates or events.

&gt; I think inserting corporate names or (as the article discusses) university names or whatnot is slightly disrespectful and a little bit greasy.

I do 100% agree with you on that. But we don't really ""insert"" a corporate name into the anthem. The words stay the same, but it happens to also be the name of a corporation that owns the Jets.",2015-10-12 16:33:42+00:00,cvx1vpn,2.0,t1_cvx1qbh,232.0,winnipegjets

This is the most surprising thing of all. I've been saying all election it doesn't matter which way I vote because Leslie has a firm lock on her seat, so I'm going to vote for who *I* think represents my interests best.

Now it seems she may not get re-elected. That's actually pretty shocking considering the Liberal candidate who is tied with her is a nobody.

It's fine for party leaders to support israel. They should support any democratically elected government in words and actions when they deserve it.

But what Harper has for Israel isn't support. Harper is the creepy stalker who follows you around demanding your attention, thinking you can never do anything wrong. That's not the type of ""support"" we want any of our leaders showing any country.

Israel does good? We should praise them as we would praise the UK, the US, or any other country.

Israel does bad? Then we should be able to criticize them like we would any other nation without the whining about how criticism, even valid criticism is anti-semetic and anti-israel.

First things you need to check: Did you select the proper stream? Remember, you need to pass ""home"" or ""away"" as an argument. This game would be ""away"" if you want the Jets stream. If you did ""home"", you would get the 6 second clip error trying to get the jets stream.

The other one is, did you modify your hosts file?

Open up your command prompt, and type in:

    FIND /C /I ""nlsk.neulion.com"" %WINDIR%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts

If it returns ""---------- C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC\HOSTS: 1"", you're fine. If not, you didn't edit the hosts file.

Download[ this file](https://mega.nz/#!1Eo1HBwB!OXKM328nrkNaUWB_HANeuI5iI4NWnO8PZWhIaj9QaPQ) and run as administrator. It'll automatically add it to your hosts file.

Also something to check is the command prompt where you are running FuckNeulion. It should say ""Houston, we have liftoff"". If it says anything else, something went wrong. If it mentions something about buttramming (heh), hit cntrl+c 3 times, then run it again.

While in command prompt type ""java -version"". It should say Java Version 1.8xxxx. If it's less than 1.8, you need to update java. ",2015-10-04 04:17:56+00:00,cvnh5hf,2.0,t1_cvngwwn,540.0,winnipegjets

Some provinces, such as Nova Scotia, have specialized courts for Mental Health cases. You aren't let off lightly, and you may even wish you had taken the 15 days in jail instead.

Essentially, if you're accepted into that court, they will get you in touch with a social worker, and you'll need to go back into court every month for awhile for status updates. The longer you're part of the program/court and showing progress, the less often you need to go.

When the crown/judge feels you are mentally stable, will continue with your medication, and will do well without the case worker, they'll release you from the program.

http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/other-autre/clp/faq.html

#Are there any exceptions to this?

&gt; The Criminal Code provides ""close in age"" or ""peer group"" exceptions.

&gt; For example, a 14 or 15 year old can consent to sexual activity with a partner as long as the partner is less than five years older and there is no relationship of trust, authority or dependency or any other exploitation of the young person. This means that if the partner is 5 years or older than the 14 or 15 year old, any sexual activity will be considered a criminal offence unless it occurs after they are married to each other (in accordance with the ""solemnization"" of marriage requirements that are established in each province and territory, governing how and when a marriage can be performed, including the minimum age at which someone may marry).

# Are 16 and 17 year olds also protected against sexual exploitation?

&gt; The Criminal Code protects 16 and 17 year olds against sexual exploitation, where the sexual activity occurs within a relationship of trust, authority, dependency or where there is other exploitation. Whether a relationship is considered to be exploiting the 16 or 17 year old will depend upon the nature and circumstances of the relationship, e.g., **the age of the young person, the age difference between the young person and their partner, how the relationship developed and how the partner may have controlled or influenced the young person**. As well, 16 and 17 year olds cannot consent to sexual activity that involves prostitution or pornography.",2015-09-25 19:36:36+00:00,cve3c24,4.0,t1_cve14j6,3411.0,canada

7583,"Because I don't really feel like going into a whole long explanation about Mennonites 5 minutes after I wake up:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Order_Mennonite

&gt; Old Order are those Mennonite groups of Swiss German and south German heritage who practice a lifestyle without some elements of modern technology, who dress plain and who have retained the old forms of worship, baptism and communion.

Specifically under beliefs and practices:

&gt; Other aspects of Old Order Mennonite life are concerned with plainness. The concept of plainness dictates the distinctive dress of the Mennonite. Plain to a Mennonite is the opposite of showy or ostentatious, and is considered a virtue. It is based on the belief that a person's true worth does not lie in their clothes or appearance. It is this aspect of their beliefs that regulates the dress style, giving Mennonites their distinctive look with straw hats or bonnets, and plain dresses or pants.

So, how do they enforce plainness?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schleitheim_Confession - Look at ""The Ban"" (Actually, look at all of them. They are the core tenants of the Mennonites, Amish, and other anabaptists. It's interesting, even for non-religious)

&gt; A Christian should live with discipline and walk in the way of righteousness. Those who slip and fall into sin should be admonished twice in secret, but the third offense should be openly disciplined and banned as a final recourse. This should always occur prior to the breaking of the bread.

If you're interested in learning more and like to read, check out Canadian author Miriam Toews book ""A Complicated Kindness"" that deals with shunning in general, or Beverly Lewis' book ""The Shunning"" which deals with shunning specifically for dress. While the latter is Amish, not Mennonite, there are many similarities between Old Order Mennonites and Amish, which isn't surprising as the Amish were at one point Mennonites",2015-09-25 14:03:01+00:00,cvdqj6o,3.0,t1_cvdlwee,11947.0,canada

Now I wanna tell my funniest call center story.

So, working on call center for a popular consumer electronic manufacturer. Get the notice that they're laying everyone off to move the operations to the phillipines. Fuck you guys.

Unemployed for a few months, doing odd jobs to pay bills. Get another job at another call center for a fortune 100 enterprise electronic manufacturer. Doing cases where outcomes are unclear, and I need to ""judge"" the merits. I always likened myself to a judge. Customers had to make their case why they should get an exception to the service they paid (or didn't pay) for. If I make an exception, no one can overrule me. If I say no, they can appeal the case.

Few months into this new job, I see a case with the name of the old call center attached. I grab it immediately and tell my coworkers any calls on this go to me, i'll drop whatever i'm doing.

Part of the terms of service under contracts, is you need to tell us where the parts are physically at. If you want express, 4-5 hour service, we need exact location. If you want next business day service, we need to know the country. Because we stock warehouses accordingly.

Anyways, former fucktard callcenter had parts that were fully 100% covered under contract, but they were listed as installed at my former workplace. You know, the place that laid me off so they could send this to the Philippines? Guess where they wanted this sent? Yooooouuuuuu guessed it.

I send them the standard denial email, and sure enough, they call in to argue their case. I get the transfer, and flat out tell them no, I don't care if they're going to lose their contract, they will not get an exception from me.

They ask to speak to someone else, or the duty manager. I replied to the guy ""Sir, every single individual on my team has, at one point or another, been employed by your company. None of us have good things to say about it. If you like, I can get my duty manager on the line, who will have final say, but I must warn you, she also got laid off and she's already backed me on my decision to say no.""

Not sure what they ended up doing, but I know for a fact they never got those parts replaced.",2015-09-25 03:01:35+00:00,cvdd50p,5.0,t1_cvdbl51,2809.0,TumblrInAction

7592,"&gt; Doesn't matter if the customer hardcore misgenders you, unless they start abusing you verbally you've got to stand there and just deal with it. And if they abuse you verbally call your manager over to help you out.

I worked a lot of call centers. Living in Canada, but dealing with a U.S cell company, every once in awhile we would get somebody that would ask to be transferred because ""I don't want to speak to a woman"". So, they would usually transfer the call to me in escalations. My job was literally to just do escalations or problem-customer calls all day.

Normally, if a call gets to me, we do what we can for a customer within reason. These types of calls got nothing, but I kept them on the line long enough to check what cell towers they pinged. A lot of people would sign up for this local cell phone company that had no long distance rates or roaming rates anywhere in the U.S, and pretty cheap prices. But, if you went 3 months or more outside the coverage area, we would cancel you.

Most customers I found a reason why we could cancel their service.

Every once in awhile, my department wouldn't be busy, so they'd stick us in the regular queue to help out. Well, one day I got the opposite of those calls. I got ""I want to be transferred. I don't want to speak to a man"".

Well, those customers were in for a treat. Because I, as an escalations rep, was not allowed to transfer to another escalations rep. If an escalation came up on a call, I would identify myself as a ""customer care supervisor"", and treat it as an escalation.

For someone that didn't want to speak with a guy, she spent over an hour arguing with me how she wanted to speak to a female rep.

Well, think of it like this.

If you have an original iPhone, and you need it replaced, you can't get the exact same model of phone, right? But what if your company required a certain phone, because their systems are only setup for the original iPhone. They're going to have a support contract with Apple or their phone provider to ensure that there is stock of the original iPhone in case they need it.

These support contracts typically get renewed every year, or every x years, depending on how they are setup.

Now, in this scenario, the Hajj needs 3 original iPhones in 3 different spots within 4 hours. But instead of paying Apple or a Phone Company to carry the original iPhone in local warehouses, they're demanding that Apple / phone company spend a lot of money to grab those original iPhones that are currently warehoused in the U.S as a backup for companies that *do* have those support/end-of-life contracts in place, and fly them over immediately. Mind you, the warranty has long since expired, and they have never paid for it to be under contract.

Why should Apple take those iPhones that are to be given to the company that has those support contracts in place, and give them to someone else?

It's not a case of ""They should have paid us more money"". It's a case of ""They never paid us at all, these haven't been manufactured in a decade, and what little stock we have is because Verizon has paid us millions of dollars to keep these sitting in a warehouse until they need them""",2015-09-24 17:49:40+00:00,cvcsnk0,7.0,t1_cvcscwx,433.0,worldnews

And not just from a human logistics standpoint, but from a technological standpoint. Working with a logistics company that deals with networking equipment worldwide, every year you get the people setting up the Hajj calling in saying:

We need this really rare part you stopped manufacturing 5 years ago and don't even have on the continent i'm on, but ours broke, and while we didn't pay for out-of-life support so you could stock it locally, we need this within 4 hours.

Because their networking equipment being down (meaning no streaming, etc) could lead to news reports specifically mentioning the company, leading to bad PR, someone from corporate usually gets involved and gives them really fucking expensive equipment at no cost. And we still get shit on, because during Hajj it's impossible to get something delivered at that service level.",2015-09-24 11:50:50+00:00,cvcg2ya,3.0,t1_cvce7ze,7378.0,worldnews

7802,"&gt; What about Canadians that live in Canada and don't pay tax

What Canadians live in Canada that do not pay tax?

Those on welfare? Are they somehow exempt from tax? Know why they don't pay income tax? Because their annual income will be so low, any money paid to the CRA would be returned. Oh, but if they get a job, and get above the minimum amount in the tax year, they are financially penalized for being on welfare or even employment insurance.

But they *do* pay sales tax. Even people on welfare need to eat. You can't walk into a grocery store and show a welfare card and get out of paying taxes.

&gt; I stand by my statement that expat Canadians should be allowed to vote. 

Sure. As long as they come back to the country for a short period every 5 years.

&gt; We ARE Canadians. Just because we are not in Canada at the moment doesn't make us less Canadian. 

Yes. You are Canadian. You get the benefits of being Canadian while doing nothing to carry your share of the burden required of Canadians. And you complain that you can't decide how a country you no longer live in has denied you voting rights?

You aren't even denied from voting. You *can* vote. You just need to be in the country. When you return to Canada, you don't need to make an application to Elections Canada to restore that right. You can go to any polling station and do the thing you claim we are denying you access to.

&gt; The laws enacted in Canada affect us every day

Oh give me a break. How are you affected by C-51? How are you affected by mandatory minimum sentencing? How are you affected by the budget? How are you affected by any piece of legislation passed federally or provincially with the exception of the recent change to take away long-term expats right to vote?

&gt; By removing our right to vote you are disenfranchising a segment of the population of the country we both identify with and lay claim to. 

And I identify as a freeman on the land (/s). I reject the notion the notion that there are world borders. I should have the right to vote in the U.S election, the Mexican elections, the UK election, the Australian election, the Russian Elections, the Japanese elections, and any other election. Why? Because I said so.

We aren't disenfranchising any of our population by taking away long-term expats rights to vote. 

As of April 1, we had 35,749,600 people living ***in*** Canada. You aren't included in that number, because while you are a Canadian *citizen* (Giving you the right to enter the country at any time), you are not a Canadian *resident*.

&gt; You are forcing us to live by laws we have no say over.

Again, tell me how any law beyond the fair elections act affects you, someone who does not live in our country. They affect me, but then again I'm currently in the country, and will be for the foreseeable future. Hell, one day I may take a vacation overseas. But I'll still be able to vote, because my vacation will be considerably less than 5 years.

&gt; I didn't become an expat worker to avoid paying taxes in Canada

No one said you did. I, however, did say that you're trying to claim all the benefits of being a Canadian resident, while not being a Canadian resident.",2015-09-21 15:43:58+00:00,cv93gds,10.0,t1_cv92u1q,992.0,canada
7803,"&gt; Of course there is a difference. Both are still illegal and both are still violations of the same law.

Okay, killing someone is illegal, right?

If I see you on the street, and shoot you, I'll likely be given a lengthy prison sentence.

However, if you attack me, and I'm in reasonable fear for my life, and in self-defense kill you, I likely wouldn't even face a charge of manslaughter.

But....but.... killing people is *illegal*. 

The liberal candidate did the political version of a non-criminal misdemeanor, and was punished for it.

The conservative *party* did the political version of premeditated murder, and still hasn't been brought to justice.

You know you don't need to be in government to create proposed legislation? Hell, you could do it at home! Likely wouldn't ever be brought to a vote, but still.

What you seem to be assuming is that the Liberals haven't been preparing in the slightest for this, haven't done any research into this, and haven't worked out a timeline if they form government.

And it is actually pretty simple to, within their first month, call a vote on a bill that does nothing but repeal the relevant parts of the criminal code so people wont be arrested/charged for it.

7928,"I agree with the vast majority of what you said.

I wasn't trying to mock the natives here. My comment about neither party having the moral highground was just in how people treated each other in the different videos.

Though, personally, if I had to choose a side between Gary McHale and the Natives, I'd choose the natives. They're angry about something (The land dispute, as you mentioned), but while they're loud, they aren't violent, and that's the most important thing in my eyes.

Whereas Gary seems to intentionally be starting shit and when the natives attempt to block him during their protests, as soon as there is even a light touch he starts yelling ""I ARREST YOU"".

And that's why this video is here. Basically to make fun of this mindset. Somebody with such a skewed sense of the law thinking they can place an officer under arrest for choosing not to continue a citizens arrest.

I'm still going through the wikipedia page. This hole situation seems overly complicated, and I can see why the courts have a hard time dealing with this.

I always got the ""Jet fuel can't melt steel beams"" meme, but I never thought that steel needed to melt to break, just to be weakened. According to that article, I was right (YAY):

&gt; Jet fuel burns at 800° to 1500°F, not hot enough to melt steel (2750°F). However, experts agree that for the towers to collapse, their steel frames didn't need to melt, they just had to lose some of their structural strength

&gt; ""Steel loses about 50 percent of its strength at 1100°F,"" notes senior engineer Farid Alfawak-hiri of the American Institute of Steel Construction.

For instance, the Mennonite Brethren Church have people in Iraq and Syria to provide relief and supplies to those affected by the civil war/ISIS, and help people escape the country (without compensation).

In other conflicts, Mennonites have attempted to use their bodies as shields by standing between two warring parties hoping to bring conflict to an end (Doesn't always work out well).

Dexter also promised not to raise taxes. Yet income tax and the HST were both raised. If Mulcair wants me to look at the NDP history in regards to budgets, it means Mulcair is either misleading us about balancing the budget, or he's misleading us about refusing to raise taxes.

Okay. Lets look at the NDP balancing the budget in Nova Scotia:

In 2011, they balanced it, but fuck everyone else. The raised the HST by 2 points despite promising not to, making us the highest in Canada at 15%, removed tuition freezes ([and as of 10 hours ago started bitching that we face the highest tuition increase in Canada](http://nsndp.ca/ns/tuition)) and, despite ""belt tightening"", decided to spend millions to save a pulp and paper industry that closed up shop anyway.

And while it's not part of balancing the budget, your government also introduced a ""cyber bullying"" law that was highly redundant (It was already covered through existing laws), and imposed criminal penalties on individuals where the accused didn't even get to defend themselves in court. That goes against everything this country stands for. It's something you would expect to see from a dictatorship, not a parliamentary democracy.

So, I don't have a lot of faith in the NDP being able to balance the budget without pulling a CPC move and gutting every program that they can.

I guess it's a good thing I'm not voting based on who can balance the mudget, eh Mulcair?",2015-09-10 03:14:19+00:00,cuwdyzs,1.0,t3_3kc7gm,2645.0,canada

Doctors make between ""enough"" and a damn fine salary, depending on how their offices are setup. If you are a doctor working out of an office by yourself, your overhead is going to be insane.

If you're a doctor that shares an office with 3 other doctors, your overhead is much lower, and split 4 ways. My mother works for a family doctor like this. Until last month, there were 5 doctors in her office, she booked for 3, and the other receptionist booked for the other 2 (The other 2 decided to choose different software, so they hired their own receptionist). While I don't know how much the other receptionist earns, she makes a good deal less than my mother who is also a (former) registered nurse.

8354,"Worth mentioning employers can't deny you a request to take a short time off work to vote

&gt; By law, everyone who is eligible to vote must have three consecutive hours to cast their vote on election day. If your hours of work do not allow for three consecutive hours to vote, your employer must give you time off.

&gt; For example, if you live in a riding where voting hours are 9:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. and you usually work from 11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., your hours of work will not allow three consecutive hours for voting. To give you three consecutive hours to vote, your employer could allow you to arrive late (at 12:30 p.m.), let you leave early (at 6:30 p.m.), or give you three hours off at some point during the work day.

&gt; ***Your employer has the right to decide when the time off will be given.***

Oh, and you have the right to be paid for it, too:

&gt; Can an employee lose pay for taking time off to vote?

&gt; No.

&gt; Employers cannot impose a penalty or deduct pay from an employee who is taking time off to vote if required by the Canada Elections Act. An employee must be paid what he or she would have earned during the time allowed off for voting.

8388,"&gt; Your comment clearly says that climate change is not in your top ten priorities.

Yep, my *personal* priorities. I also stated that I would never vote for anybody that says the environment or climate change isn't an issue.

&gt;  a) is directly related to our future quality of life, threatening to greatly diminish it, and b) is tied fundamentally to everything about how we do business / live in society...

Is addressing climate change going to put food on my table? Is it going to make jobs appear that pay above minimum wage?

Will addressing climate change change the fact the cost of living is skyrocketing, and yet wages are stagnating?

What about climate change will ensure my medical expenses are covered? I'm lucky enough to have a static $175/m in medical costs. Will addressing climate change help lower that cost so I have less of a burden in other areas?

What about undoing the damage already done by the current government? What about pushing through trade deals that are detrimental to the entire country, but scores them political points, and makes other countries happy, while eroding our nations ability to govern itself?

What about homelessness? Will addressing climate change get people living on the street into an apartment, a stable job that allows them to keep up with cost of living?

If so, wow, this climate change thing is a miracle worker! Every politician should address it!

Except it does none of those things. So, I'm more concerned with voting for those that address the issues that I deal with, even if they aren't the issues you circlejerk about. But I also wont vote for people that deny climate change is an issue, just like i won't vote for people that think 9/11 is an inside job, believes in chemtrails, that vaccinations cause autism, and so on.

&gt; but you'll only vote for someone who DOES think it is a priority?

Here, let me make it clear, because apparently people can't read words *and* understand what they mean: 

Politician: Yo, climate change. It's a thing.

Me: ""Okay, great. What about the other parts of your parties platform""

Or:

Politician: Climate change: It's not an issue. Who cares

Me: Well, that's a pretty unscientific approach. I don't think i can trust you to deal with other issues in a scientifically honest manner. I'd rather not give you my vote.

Small businesses are Canadas biggest private sector employers, with 69.7% of Canadians in the private sector working for a small business [[source](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/061.nsf/vwapj/KSBS-PSRPE_August-Aout2013_eng.pdf/$FILE/KSBS-PSRPE_August-Aout2013_eng.pdf)]

So here is my line of thought: Stop being a twat telling a province you don't live in not to accept refugees from a conflict that would make any of us, including you, piss themselves from fear if we were caught in the middle of, then realize that they likely won't be here forever.

The current Queen is fine. She has a long history we can look back on to know she isn't going to do anything stupid by trying to flex the monarchy muscles.

My worry is not this Queen, but any future King or Queen that sits on the throne that chooses to exercise powers that are viewed more as ceremonial these days.

I think the best thing that could happen for the commonwealth nations is after the Queen passes on or abdicates the throne, the monarchy codifies that they are in a purely ceremonial position, and willingly give up their power to decide the laws of other nations, and especially give up the power to pull those nations into wars.

8580,"Funny you mention Munster. That was (one of) the events that lead to the formation of the Mennonites. Menno Simmons (Who my username is based off of) was one of many Dutch Anabaptist leaders who denounced the actions of the Munster Anabaptists. That group of leaders went on to form the Mennonites, named after Menno Simmons.

Anabaptists have certain tenants agreed upon in 1527 (Ironically, before Munster happened). One of them being ""[The Sword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schleitheim_Confession)"", AKA Christian Pacifism/nonresistance

&gt; Violence must not be used in any circumstance. The way of nonviolence is patterned after the example of Christ who never exhibited violence in the face of persecution or as a punishment for sin. A Christian should not pass judgment in worldly disputes. It is not appropriate for a Christian to serve as a magistrate; a magistrate acts according to the rules of the world, not according to the rules of heaven; their weapons are worldly, but the weapons of a Christian are spiritual.

Mennonites expand on this in their [confessions of faith](http://www.mennolink.org/doc/cof/art.22.html). I'll paste the commentary from the page instead of the official article, as it's less religion-y

&gt; he biblical concept of peace embraces personal peace with God, peace in human relations, peace among nations, and peace with God's creation. The Old Testament word for peace (shalom) includes healing, reconciliation, and well-being. Peace is more than the absence of war; it includes the restoration of right relationship. [...]

&gt; Nonresistance means ""not resisting."" Our example is Jesus, who endured accusation and abuse without retaliating. Jesus did sometimes confront wrongdoers (Matt. 23:1-36; John 2:13-22), but he did so in a nonviolent way that shows us how to overcome evil with good 

&gt;  Peace and justice are not optional teachings, counsel that Christians can take or leave. 

&gt; . In continuity with previous Mennonite confessions of faith, we affirm that nonparticipation in warfare involves conscientious objection to military service and a nonresistant response to violence. Our peace witness also includes peacemaking and working for justice. Peace witness is needed even when the nations in which we live are not at war. Ministries of mediation, conciliation, and nonviolent resolution of everyday conflict can express our commitment to Christ's way of peace.

One notable way that certain Mennonite groups have been attempted non-resistance peace initiatives is in the Israel-Palestine conflict, where Mennonites would stand between Israel and Palestine forces to try and prevent hostilities. This, of course, led to this wonderful article entitled ""[Key Mennonite Institutions against Israel](http://jcpa.org/article/key-mennonite-institutions-against-israel/)""

8651,"&gt; I'm deciding between the jets and leafs.

Well, the leafs don't exactly have a great record for winning games. They have an insane amount of fans across Canada, they bring in so much money from merchandise and ticket sales, but they can't manage to form a winning team. The fans have started getting fed up, and have started throwing jerseys onto the ice after embarrassing loses.

That being said, they have a new coach who may be able to whip the team into a regular winner. May not be this season, but I'm hoping to see them get progressively better over the next several years while they work to rebuild themselves.

&gt; How is Winnipeg as a holiday destination?

I no longer live in Manitoba, but most of my vacations have been south of Winnipeg, camping, going to water parks etc. Can't really help you with that beyond saying that there are a lot of places in Manitoba to go to get lost in Nature and enjoy yourself.

&gt; And how would you honestly rate the jets arena?

One of the best in the league! And not based on seating layout, concessions, or even the sexy new scoreboard. The reason why the Winnipeg Jets have the best arena in the entire NHL is the fans.

When tickets first when on sale after the team was moved to Winnipeg, tickets sold out in 15 minutes. When the first playoff tickets in 19 years went on sale, they sold out in 5. Despite being a smaller city, Winnipeg has a very dedicatated local fanbase, and it shows.

Most teams getting swept out of the playoffs will see their fans silent and disappointed. Winnipeg? Hell no, [Winnipeg kept cheering the jets on long after game 4 ended in a loss](http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=764800). When Lee Stempniak scored the first playoff goal in Winnipeg since 1996, the Jets fans ""[resembled the rumble of a jumbo jet](http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/winnipeg-whiteout-becomes-avalanche-of-playoff-excitement-1.3041479)"".

&gt; ""The record for the loudest sporting event was set last September by nearly 80,000 spectators at the Kansas City Chiefs' Arrowhead Stadium. Guinness World Records acknowledged the crowd noise reached 142.2 dbA.""

&gt; Following Stempniak's tally, the Winnipeg crowd reached 124 dbA. A sizeable gap from the record, but impressive considering there were 65,000 fewer fans in attendance.

Being a fan of the team doesn't just mean you get to watch amazing hockey. It means you get to interact with some of the most dedicated hockey fans in the NHL.

That's my pitch for why you should pick Winnipeg over Toronto. In the end, choose whichever team you like. Be a Toronto Fan, or an L.A Kings fan, it doesn't matter.

Here's the backstory:

From Raymond Feist

&gt; In 1975 or so, I fell into a game with some friends at an apartment off campus (UCSD). It was called ""D&amp;D"" but it wasn't. By the time I came aboard, they'd already tossed most of the original rules as being ""dumb"" and replaced them with ""house rules"" which we got on xeroxed sheets. If you're old enough to remember the original white box of D&amp;D, you'll understand how incomprehensible most of the rules were. Anyway, Midkemia was original a bunch of unrelated dungeons, but by the time I came aboard, they had started running overlands from dungeon to dungeon. We got into keeping ""real time"" and having the DM keep the character sheets. That eliminated a character being run in multiple-dungeons at the same time (common in D&amp;D back then) or suddenly showing up with massive treasure and weapons while still in another dungeon (also common) and other irritating stuff along those lines. Cities were begun as a place to do stuff between adventures, and became environments of their own. It was Conan LaMont who coined the name ""Midkemia"" and he said he had no idea what it meant--he just liked the sound. The environment has evolved for over 20 years now, with tens of thousands of hours of creation by dozens of people.

From Stephan Abrams:

&gt; The first 'true' Midkemia game/campaign started in 1976. It was mostly composed of a group of University of California, San Diego, students and graduate students. At it's most active (early to mid 80's), there were as many as 12 active GMs, each controlling and developing pieces of the world, varying from single Cities (and 'dungeons') to entire continents (like Ray's Novindus). There are a handfull of groups out there that got seeded with rules (mostly by someone leaving San Diego and starting a new group). Local role-playing has unfortuneately taken a backseat to work and raising families but we're working on a new 'adventure' as we 'speak'. I guess I could be called the 'original GM' with Jon Everson #2 (you know, Abramsev and Evdem [no, we didn't make up the names, just got pasted with them]).",2015-08-21 20:48:33+00:00,cub3hln,5.0,t1_cub39t3,338.0,TumblrInAction

8936,"Wifi and electromagnetic frequencies can harm you - This has been debunked since 2005/2006, and every respectable publication since has made similar findings. She started talking about it in 2011 about the new ""Smart Meters"" in BC. To be fair to Ms. May, the effects of electromagnetic frequencies/wifi are still being studied, so it's far from ""put to bed"". But the current consensus contradicts what she talks about.

Homeopathic medicine, ""traditional"" medicine, etc - This was in their platform until someone actually read it, pointed it out, and the country had a good laugh. They wanted the federal government to cover the costs of non-medicine. While it was pulled after wide-spread mockery, I don't believe their position has changed

GMOs - They call them completely unsafe. Whatever your opinion on GMOs is, the fact of the matter is we wouldn't be able to purchase that type of food if it wasn't. If May was only pushing for the labeling of GMO food, I'd still disagree, but I wouldn't call it anti-science.

Abiotic Oil - It's theory from Stalinist Russia that petroleum is not derived from biological matter, but is rather a geological substance dating to the origins of the earth. It's also been routinely debunked and has no evidence to support it. The green party had a 2-part blog on the ""evidence"" for abiotic oil, [which has since been pulled, but not deleted](http://www.greenparty.ca/blogs/12489/2012-08-28/more-evidence-abiotic-oil). 403 error code means you need to be logged in.

Cancer - I'm still on the fence if I should criticize May for this, but i'll add it here. She has talked about Canadas Cancer Epidemic. While yes, cancer rates today are higher than cancer rates 40-50 years ago, what Ms. May fails to take into account is a very large population of baby boomers. Here is a breakdown on age range , and the percentage of cancer diagnosis in that age range ([source](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/incidence/age#heading-Seven))

Age Range | Percentage
---|---
0-14 | &lt;1%
15-24 | &lt;1%
25-49 | 10%
50-74 | 53%
75+ | 36%


Those considered baby boomers are born between 1946 and 1964. So the age range is 51-69. That means they are all within the age range where the majority of cancers are diagnosed.

&gt; The first-sale doctrine is a legal concept playing an important role in U.S. copyright and trademark law by limiting certain rights of a copyright or trademark owner. The doctrine enables the distribution chain of copyrighted products, library lending, giving, video rentals and secondary markets for copyrighted works (for example, enabling individuals to sell their legally purchased books or CDs to others). In trademark law, this same doctrine enables reselling of trademarked products after the trademark holder put the products on the market.

8970,"&gt; Can you source this? It may be instrumental in possibly changing my vote.

Doubt it, as it's bullshit. Just like how those who claim to be ""alergic to electromagnetic waves"" flocked to the U.S [National Radio Quiet Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Radio_Quiet_Zone), and has shown to be all in their heads, wifi signals are the same thing.

The earliest wifi claim from May I have seen is from [2011 on twitter](https://twitter.com/ElizabethMay/status/96091744076177409). It talks about both wifi AND electromagnetic frequencies.

According to the Wikipedia page on [Electromagnetic hypersensitivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_hypersensitivity) (EHS), the WHO concluded in 2005:

&gt; EHS is characterized by a variety of non-specific symptoms that differ from individual to individual. The symptoms are certainly real and can vary widely in their severity. Whatever its cause, EHS can be a disabling problem for the affected individual. EHS has no clear diagnostic criteria and there is no scientific basis to link EHS symptoms to EMF exposure. Further, EHS is not a medical diagnosis, nor is it clear that it represents a single medical problem.

And there is [this double blind study](http://www.bmj.com/content/332/7546/886.full) from 2006

As for the very specifics about *wifi*, in 2007 the British [Health Protection Agency said](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6677051.stm): 

&gt; The Health Protection Agency points out that a person sitting in a wi-fi hotspot for a year would be exposed to only the same amount of radiation from a 20-minute mobile phone call.

&gt; [...]

&gt; The World Health Organisation says there is no risk from low level, long-term exposure to wi-fi networks.

In other words, Elizabeth May, the leader of the self-proclaimed ""Party of Science"" was making a claim that was the exact opposite of what the actual science was showing at the time. There was 5 years since the first study on EHS to Mays first post about it. The Party Of Science had plenty of time to familiarize themselves with the actual science, and not the conspiracies.",2015-08-01 04:26:55+00:00,ctnmyqu,7.0,t1_ctncc0n,21230.0,canada

But thats not the *worst* part of it. On top of that $3 for the ticket, they also take another 10% because they are taking that money off your pay check.

9018,"&gt; That's fucking sick. Are you serious

In the 80's the Supreme Court of Canada threw out the portion of the criminal code dealing with abortion, and thus the limits to abortion.

*However*, that doesn't mean if you are 8 months pregnant, you can get an abortion. No doctor in Canada will perform an abortion after the 24 week mark without a damn good reason. Are you 25 weeks pregnant, perfectly healthy with a healthy fetus, and there is unlikely to be complications with the birth? Guess what? No abortion for you! 

Are you &gt;24 weeks pregnant, and the pregnancy poses a serious health risk? Guess what? The doctor will consider it (After likely speaking with the physicians college and speaking with the hospitals legal department).

Now, that's if you have *access* to abortion services. Some areas, especially in Eastern Canada, do not have access to abortion either within a reasonable limit (N.B) or within the entire province (P.E.I)",2015-07-24 12:48:10+00:00,ctei28l,5.0,t1_ctehmo2,1033.0,worldnews

However, just because there is no limit set by government there are ethical guidelines imposed by the colleges that act as limits.

It's easier for a doctor to break an ethical guideline and say it was in the best interest of the patient in front of other doctors  than violate the law with the same excuse in front of a lawyer and judge",2015-07-24 11:56:15+00:00,ctegucx,3.0,t1_ctebgkr,19194.0,worldnews

http://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(05)00078-4/abstract

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190740904000349

&gt; In 1996, the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect (NCCAN) investigated more than two million reports alleging maltreatment of more than three million children. More than one million of these children were identified as victims of abuse. Of the one million children, 12% were sexually abused. **The sexual abuse of children by women, primarily mothers, once thought to be so rare it could be ignored, constituted 25% (approximately 36 000 children) of the sexually abused victims**. This statistic is thought to be **underestimated due to the tendency of non-disclosure by victims**. This paper examines the statistical data regarding sexual abuse by women, the psychological profiles of these women, how and why society excuses female abusers, the impact on the sexually abused children, and available treatments for the perpetrators.

Whelp. Statistically AND morally incorrect

&gt; or murder.

Oh god, i'm only going to post a few examples, as women are the [primary murderers of children](https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/media/publications/bjs_study_murder_in_families_1994.pdf).

* find accounts on the device - This is, essentially, for pre-3.0 devices to maximize compatibility. ""It uses an existing connection for Google services. For pre-3.0 devices, this requires users to set up their Google account on their mobile devices. A Google account is not a requirement on devices running Android 4.0.4 or higher""
* read your own contact card - Not sure why this is scary... It allows them to confirm you are who you say you are.
* add or remove accounts - If Uber has any integration with the accounts section of your android device. Similar to how Kobo allows you to add your account so you can access your library, or Google allows you to add multiple accounts to use in google account connected apps

**Contacts**

* read your contacts - Not sure why they have this

**Location**

* approximate location (network-based) - uh, this is kind of needed
* precise location (GPS and network-based) - a more precise location, which is needed

**SMS**

* receive text messages (SMS) - this is used to verify your number. When uber sends you a text message, they can read the text, and automatically verify you in the app. According to them, the scan is limited to 60min

**Phone**

* directly call phone numbers - Uh, you wanna be able to call your driver, right? Because android doesn't have click-to-call (Because Apple decided to sue over it), this is a ""workaround"" to it

**Photos/Media/Files**

* modify or delete the contents of your USB storage - *any* app that stores data, such as account credentials, needs this permission
* read the contents of your USB storage - Same as above

**Camera**

* take pictures and videos - they apparently do this to scan your credit card. This is probably so they can lower their credit card fees to show you had the card on you at the time of processing (There are different fees depending on what type of security you use to process credit cards. Having someone with the credit card present at the time of purchase would be cheaper than doing it directly over the internet without that verification)

**Wi-Fi connection information**

* view Wi-Fi connections - if you're not connected to wifi, you have less precise GPS. Considering you want a car to pick you up at your current location, they use this to look for nearby networks
* Device ID &amp;amp; call information - ""This permission is used in conjunction with your own contact information to prepopulate your mobile number and country during registration. You can edit these fields, and the updated values are sent to Uber once your account is created. This permission is also used to obtain your Android device ID, which is sent to Uber's servers and used in fraud prevention efforts."". I believe that. 
* read phone status and identity - same as above

**Other**

* receive data from Internet - do... do you WANT to connect to the internet? You can thank Google for having a bunch of redundant permissions
* control vibration - Eh, not really sure why they have this, but i'm not sure whats so spooky about it
* use accounts on the device - Once they store the account, they kinda need to access it, right?
* read Google service configuration - required by certain google play services, such as google maps
* prevent device from sleeping - self explanatory
* view network connections - ^
* modify system settings - eh, this one is kind of spooky. They also don't give a sufficient explanation
* full network access - yes, internet applications need network access",2015-07-17 02:34:57+00:00,ct64s9d,2.0,t1_ct619et,6637.0,canada

We would be saving money from social programs which would save different provinces different amounts of money based on # of recipients, welfare rate, and any benefits from welfare (E.G: Cost of medication being covered, dental insurance, etc)

We'd be able to close a few different government agencies, or at the very least reduce staff as programs are no longer needed, such as employment insurance, CPP, GST/HST+provincial credits, etc. If there is a ""variable"" rate for mincome (E.G: Additional mincome for children, being a vet, etc), thats more money saved from cutting multiple departments.

We would be able to reduce or completely cut funding to job search agencies, such as the YMCA.

I'm not sure if there would be any impact on transfers to native communities.

So, there are a lot of ways we could cut a lot of costs by a minimum income. In terms of raising more money? I'm not sure, to be honest",2015-06-20 19:02:35+00:00,csd40wu,2.0,t1_csczvz8,8442.0,canada

If the CRA is even remotely competant (I wonder at times) they have historical data.

Every call center i've worked for determines its staffing based on that same day the last few years, and if recent history has broken those historical norms.

If the CRA gets more calls around a certain time of the year, maybe hiring a 30+ people on a temp basis would help with the seasonal high. If you see a lot of people are calling in on GST day, 1) Have an IVR message saying ""We can't help you until the 15th"" (As that's true. They can't resend cheques until then) and 2) Staff accordingly.

As you said, it's not fucking rocket science.

The main periods the CRA needs to worry about, as I see it:

Tax season

RRSP contribution date deadline

Quarterly GST payments (Reps should be pushing for direct deposit on every call at this point anyways)

UCCB/WIB/CCTB dates: For same reason as GST payments. Also pushing direct deposit (Seriously guys, Government is phasing out cheques and dealing only in direct deposit soon)
