2,"Again, this might be the wrong play and feel free to call me out on it but like I've said MP is a much looser player and I didn't want to give him a free card because hands like 67 or 68 are definitely in his limping range. From what I understand now though it was definitely a bad move to call all 3 streets especially since I was making good folds in this session. I felt like if I was ahead on the flop, I would be ahead on all 3 streets with how the hand played out. In hindsight that was the wrong read and I'll be more careful to give this player the respect he deserves and watch for him slow playing big hands in the future.

But as far as your concern of 'humanitarian reasons' goes - who gets to define what constitutes reason and what doesn't? Who gets to decide who should intervene? And don't you see the potential for abuse here? If our allies are doing it, that's fine. If we don't like the people that are doing it we'll intervene. That double standard exists even today. Egypt buys US weapons and protects Israel so we won't intervene in their revolution. Turkey gives us space to setup military bases so they're okay too. Saudi Arabia has all the oil and influences global prices, so they can keep pummeling both their own citizens and Yemen but we'll completely ignore that. Assad flirted with Russia so to hell with him. Gaddafi is a goat shagger so we'll go after him too. Are Libya and Syria even better off for our intervention? I'd think not.

192,"**I HATE HOW EVERYONE BELIEVES SUAREZ IS A RACIST BECAUSE OF THE NARRATIVE AROUND THE INCIDENT AND THE FACT THAT HE WAS BANNED FOR IT SEEMS TO LEAVE NO DOUBT IN PEOPLE'S MINDS THAT THE OFFICIALS MAY HAVE GOT IT WRONG.** 

Suarez may be what most call a 'dirty' player and sure, he dives (he'll admit it himself) and his game is pretty physical, but it's no less than he receives (and you'll never see him diving off of no contact, if anything he'll exaggerate contact that's already there). Yes, he's bitten players. It's fucked up but I don't see that in the same realm as when players go into malicious tackles purposely or start kicking others when they're losing. One of those has the potential to end a career, the other just leaves some teeth marks. But all of this is on the field.

On the other hand, the fact that most people just blindly think he's racist because of the Evra incident maligns his character based on something that is entirely false that most people just assume because of the allegation, the media attention and his baseless ban. Here's what actually went down, because it pains me to see such a great guy's character be assassinated like that.

Did Suarez use the word 'negro' in an argument with Evra? Yes, he did. 

Does the word 'negro' mean the same thing in Spanish as it does in English? Absolutely not. In Spanish, it's pronounced *neh-gro*, not *nee-gro*, and all it means is 'black'... nothing more. It most certainly has no racist connotations to it, and can be used to refer to someone with dark skin or dark hair. It implies no rejection or discrimination and is used in a friendly manner - many Latin American players actually have the nickname El Negro or El Negrito. Of course, Evra accused him of saying 'nigger' (which isn't even a word that would occur to a native Spanish speaker who can barely put together a sentence in English) and later retracted his accusation and changed it to 'negro', but imagine the media's excitement to indict a 'dirty' player.

What some people refuse to accept is that the argument took place in Spanish, not English. Evra came up to Luisito and asked him in broken Spanish what amounts to 'Why you hit me?' Suarez's incredulous response was 'por qu√© negro' because he thought it was pretty hypocritical of a defender, who spends the whole game kicking players why he kicked him. Now of course, Evra, who barely speaks Spanish related this incident to the officials as Suarez saying 'porque eres negro' which translates to 'because you are black'. Of course, the subtlety of the difference between 'por qu√©' and 'porque' is totally lost on the English officials.

Now people will say, ""But he said 'black' so he's a racist."" You've gotta understand that in Spanish this is completely normal way of addressing people, as is 'gordo' (fat), 'rubio' (blond), 'guapo' (handsome), etc. There was no attache insult - he didn't say 'black this' or 'black that'. But he used the Spanish word for black and got an eight game ban for it and was forever branded a racist. 

Any time I see someone on Reddit talk about him as a racist, it breaks my heart a little. He's not always been the cleanest on the pitch (and you can clearly see the huge difference in his demeanor regarding diving since moving to Barca because he doesn't need to since he knows he'll get past the defender anyway), but he's certainly a great guy off it. Hell, even on the pitch he'll set up teammates when they're in a better position than him when he would probably have scored anyway. Luisito Suarez - I loved him at Liverpool, but I love him at Bar√ßa even more and I hope he'll finish his professional career here with us before moving back to Uruguay. Hope this helps.

And sorry for the spammy bold font on top, I just think that this incident deserves to be brought to light more often since I've been seeing these allegations repeatedly in r/soccer every time Suarez is brought up, and I didn't want people to ignore it just because it's such a long post. :)",2016-08-18 08:14:29+00:00,d6mctay,1.0,t3_4y8pj0,33902.0,Barca

197,"To begin with, let me address your concern with Sweden's victories - the fact that possession should translate to a win every time. If that were true, my favorite team, Barcelona would win every game because they've maybe been outpossessed 3 or 4 times since 2008. Similarly, Leicester City wouldn't have won the Premier League last season since there were very few games in which they won the possession battle. While possession and shots on goal are somewhat important, it doesn't make hanging back and hitting your opponent on the counter attack any less valid of a tactic (sure, it may be boring and many purists decry it as negative tactics, but it's still a legitimate way to win a game). 

Now onto the question of PKs:

PKs are only a feature of knockout games. You won't see them in a regular league where the champion is decided by most points (3 for a Win, 1 for a Draw and 0 for a Loss). Like some people have mentioned here, it'll significantly affect the quality of a game. Soccer players run around 7 miles per 90 minute game, when compared with sports like American Football (1.25 miles over 60 minutes of play, where no one is in play all the time), basketball (2.7 miles in a 48 minute game where again, players keep switching in and out), and baseball (negligible amount of running and very little actual exertion per game to the point that a 162 game season is possible). 

You won't be surprised when I say that scoring plays in the other sports I mentioned are much more common, whereas the average number of goals per game in all soccer World Cups to date is 2.78. That is under 1 scoring play per 30 minutes. Eventually, as a game goes to extra time, teams tend to get even more rigorous defensively, since a goal against you amounts to a knockout more often than not. 

Furthermore, I reject your premise that PKs are essentially a coin flip. Sure, an element of luck is most certainly involved but there is a lot more that goes on behind the scenes in training, both on the part of the penalty takers and the goalkeepers. I'll point you to two examples:
 
1. 2006 World Cup Quarterfinals when Germany and Argentina went to PKs after neither side could break the deadlock after 90 minutes. The reserve German goalkeeper, Oliver Kahn shook hands with the starting goalkeeper, Jens Lehmann to wish him luck, but also slipped him a chit of paper with vital research on which side each opposition penalty taker was likely to shoot. It isn't luck that led to Germany winning the shootout. 

2. 2014 World Cup Quarterfinals when after 120 minutes, Netherlands and Costa Rica were both goalless (reason in itself to go to penalties and put us out of our misery). The Dutch coach held off on making a third substitution just so that in the 120th minute, he subbed off his regular starting goalie, Jasper Cillessen for Tim Krul, who went on to save 2 of 5 Costa Rican penalties (and guessed the right way on all 5). 

It certainly is a test of skills, and that by definition would make it more than a coin flip. Also consider this, England have lost 5 penalty shootouts and only won 1, in 1996. On the flip side, Germany have only lost one penalty shootout - all the way back in 1976 and have all 5 that they've been in since. Coincidence? I think not. 

When after a sufficient amount of time, if a winner can't be decided, it would be considered a draw in league play (and it goes down in the record books as a draw even in knockout rounds). Adding unlimited periods of extra time will significantly disadvantage a team that had to play say 60 minutes of extra time over a team that didn't have to play any. You have to remember that these players are already playing longer than most other sports when they play a regular 90 minutes and are covering much more ground than other professional athletes, for considerably less return (scoring plays) than other sports.

&gt;The oceans have absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 700 meters (about 2,300 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.302 degrees Fahrenheit since 1969.

&gt;The number of record high temperature events in the United States has been increasing, while the number of record low temperature events has been decreasing, since 1950. The U.S. has also witnessed increasing numbers of intense rainfall events

&gt;Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the acidity of surface ocean waters has increased by about 30 percent.12,13 This increase is the result of humans emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and hence more being absorbed into the oceans. The amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the upper layer of the oceans is increasing by about 2 billion tons per year.

Besides, there is much more than 30 years of data for a variety of indicators for climate change. Here is but one, courtesy of the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association/American Meteorological Society](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/bams?ts=arctic_seaice):

&gt;The Arctic continued to warm; sea ice extent remained low. The Arctic land surface temperature tied with 2007 and 2011 as the highest since records began in the early 20th century, representing a 2.8¬∞C (5¬∞F) increase since that time. Average sea surface temperatures across the Arctic Ocean during August in ice-free regions ranged from near normal to 8¬∞C above average. Increasing temperatures have led to decreasing Arctic sea ice extent and thickness. In February 2015, the maximum sea ice extent reached its largest footprint of the year, and was the smallest in the 37-year satellite record, at 7 percent below the 1981‚Äì2010 average. Minimum sea ice extent in September 2015 was 29 percent less than the 1981‚Äì2010 average and the fourth lowest value on record.

[Here's some more data and explanation about warming sea surface temperatures SINCE 1880.](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-sea-surface-temperature#ref6) The datasets are in the footnotes.

Also I just wanted to point out that you are being extremely pedantic thinking that the day we hit 30 years of evidence for indicators that have only 27 years of data will be the day we can confirm or deny climate change.",2016-08-16 09:09:50+00:00,d6jhevu,2.0,t1_d6jevv4,7878.0,AskTrumpSupporters

'Millions of people' refusing to hand over their guns has NOTHING to do with Hillary nominating a SC judge. So 2 is invalid.

As for point number 3, besides it being absurd like you said and thereby just utter horseshit, it is also invalid because passing such a constitutional amendment once again has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with Hillary picking a SC judge.

229,"Fair points there, but Hillary has more in common with a traditional Republican candidate like Mitt Romney or Jeb! on many issues than those two have with Trump. Now don't blow up at me for saying that, let me explain. I agree that this election has completely blown the traditional American spectrum away with Trump going further right than was thought possible and Bernie's movement dragging the Democratic party a little further left. 

I'll rephrase, Hillary is extremely progressive on social issues and for all intents and purposes we can look forward to meaningful legislation and executive action under a Hillary presidency. However, when it comes to foreign policy, I think she is a total neocon. I don't think you'll argue with me when I say that Hillary's foreign policy will basically be a continuation of Obama's hawkishness - a barrage of drone strikes, meddling in Middle Eastern politics trying to export 'democracy' on one hand while still counting on the Saudi royal family and Erdogan as strong allies, continued support for the TPP, etc. I obviously don't think she'll go full Dubya and invade countries on a whim.

In terms of fiscal policy, she is running on a relatively progressive platform of tax breaks for the middle class, working towards a $15 minimum wage, and reinstating Glass-Steagall (this is new and quite contrary to her voting record) among other things but in all honesty, I'd prefer to wait for some of that to be implemented before I deem her truly progressive. 

To sum it up, I agree that she's come a long way in her political career and definitely moved further left since 2008, but being a huge international relations/economics nut, her foreign policy and chumminess with Wall Street really leave a lot to be desired. That isn't to say I can't appreciate Hillz for her progressive social platform and promise of some fiscal reform. Thanks for the link btw, it really made me think a little more objectively.

That is ~3% of all votes likely to be cast. All of this doesn't even account for the fact that most of these large crowds are in historically red states that are bound to vote R anyway, but let's not complicate this with the complexities of the electoral college. Furthermore, this reasoning also completely overlooks a large part of Hillary's likely voters: people that don't particularly like her and won't show up to listen to her speak, but will still vote for her solely to keep Trump out of the White House. I think rallies and emotion at said rallies are a very poor way to gauge the preferences of an entire country. Just look at how large Bernie's crowds were, and how passionate his movement still is. Hillary still managed to get more of the popular vote AND more delegates. I fully agree that a lot of fishy things went on behind the scenes with the DNC collusion and the MSM completely ignoring his campaign, but the fact stands that she beat him by nearly 4 million votes (see how insignificant this number is in the scheme of things?) in the democratic primaries which in most states was basically only registered democrats voting.

276,"Absolutely the most underplayed shot in the game - especially at the junior level. I used to be considerably smaller than most of my opponents, and this shot got me a lot of wins over much physically stronger players. If done right, it makes it really hard for your opponent to generate much pace while volleying a ball that's literally dropping out of the air into the corner. 
You'll want to lunge super low and use a much shorter swing than normal - with your racket starting around waist or knee level. As you swing, you'll want to go almost vertically up, aiming as high on the front wall as you can (don't worry so much about getting it across the court initially, that'll come as you get the feel for the shot). A continuous, but not exaggerated follow through is just as important. You want it to loop over your opponent (presumably at the T) well above his reach so that he's retreating backwards and you can take his place on the T, and hopefully be able to pounce on a weak return.
I'd recommend practicing with a partner - 
Either a boast-lob drill or boast-drop-lob. 
Once you get better at the shot, you can do the more advanced version where player A and player B are switching positions since its a 3 shot drill, which is boast-lob-volley drive (much harder, and I'd recommend going for a shorter amount of time and aiming to do it with intensity as opposed to just barely getting a rally going for 10 minutes)",2016-07-31 06:19:24+00:00,d5y28m2,1.0,t3_4un5rk,433173.0,squash

Bigger racquet, smaller ball. 
The 'tin' on the front wall (17 inches off the ground) which is equivalent to the net in tennis.
The ball cannot hit any point outside the boundaries of the court which are on all 4 walls (highest on the front wall, lowest on the back and diagonally connecting the two on the side walls), whereas in racquetball the entire court is a playing surface - including the ceiling. 

I'm not quite sure about the scoring in racquetball, but squash is best of 5 games, 11 points a game (win by 2).",2016-07-31 04:29:06+00:00,d5xzcks,3.0,t1_d5xyzq0,690.0,sports

285,"Protective eye wear is mandatory at junior and college level squash competition. It isn't at the professional level. Luckily, there haven't been too many eye injuries at the pro level since these guys have been playing for ages and can pretty much hit the ball to within an inch of where they intend to most of the time. Plus there are a lot of rules regarding clearing space for your opponent once you've played the ball, and if you fail to give your opponent enough space, he wins the point anyway. So no real need to play the ball in a potentially dangerous situation. :)

Edit: Protective eyewear is actually quite annoying. It's a hindrance on the face and also often during a long point a little drop of sweat will get on the lens and you're basically playing with one eye for what could be a crucial point. A top women's player in America that I know even turned down a $50,000 sponsorship from US Squash because it required her to wear protective eyewear in all her matches.

The joy with which he plays the game reminds us why we love the beautiful game in the first place, not unlike a certain Ronaldinho. His transition at such a young age from Brazilian football where he could coast through on sheer talent alone, to Barcelona where he has become stronger, faster, and more disciplined both on and off the pitch has been nothing short of remarkable. He has stopped diving and become a better sportsman and team player - all qualities that deserve the utmost respect, and are a great template for young kids to follow. As far as these accusations go, regardless of their veracity, let's take a moment to accept the fact that no one is perfect. Not Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Messi, Maradona, Pele, Cruyff, Zidane, or for that matter any human being. We admire all of them for what they brought to the game, and most of them are amazing people. If we start to nitpick at every little flaw in each of these players, we will quickly run out of heroes to look up to.

329,"I don't think Busi was in bad form as much as other teams figured out how to effectively thwart him. In both those particular games, he was starved of service by at least 2 players who would either block access to him, or pressure him as soon as he received the ball. As far as Rakitic is concerned, I think he's been a declining influence this season, but I think our lack of depth on the bench has been the real problem. Xavi and Iniesta always had someone snapping at their heels to keep them on top of their game, and if they were off the pace in a game, they could easily be substituted with someone who may not be as talented, but still knew the system inside out and could blend in seamlessly. Arda has been underwhelming, Roberto, for all his incredible achievements this season is still not the finished product (no one is in their first full season), and unfortunately Rafinha was injured for what looked almost certain to be his breakout season. Pity. 
Still I think Messi would have been more effective staying on the right wing where one moment of magic can change a game (his goals against Bayern come to mind here) rather than in the center of the park building play with his main targets Alba and Neymar out of form.

332,"Messi needs to stop dropping so deep with such regularity. In the games against Atleti and Real recently, we looked rather blunt. Yes, players were tired from the international break but with Messi constantly dropping into midfield and trying to make plays against a tightly knit opposition, Suarez and Neymar had barely any width to operate off of. Alves fills in well to balance it out SOMETIMES, but defenders know he's not the same threat that Messi is on the right wing and don't need to double up on him. Also there's that little matter of the little master cutting in from right, wriggling past 2-3 defenders and curling one inside of the left post from just outside the box. I miss those goals.
