Villain limps from UTG (Super tight, pretty aggressive image). 1 other caller in MP. Folds around to hero who checks. 

Flop comes up 9 7 2 rainbow.

Hero leads out for 3 BB. UTG reraises for 7.5 BB. MP folds. 

Turn is a Q, no flush draw. Hero checks, UTG bets 11 BB. Hero calls.

River is a 10. Hero checks, UTG bets 15 BB. Hero calls.

Villain tables pocket Aces to win the pot.

Could I have played this any different? I felt the board was pretty dry and villain wouldn't be in the hand UTG with marginal hands like 68 or 97, so I figured the only hand in his range that was beating me was A9s.

Once again, Ramy Ashour proved that the normal human limits of physical performance don't apply to him. Competing in his first full tournament since March (1st round retirement at El Gouna notwithstanding), Ramy once again completed his return to competitive squash by winning the first tournament he played in, much like his 2014 World Championship victory. But that isn't the point of this post.

At the HK Open, we saw a new Ramy. Sure, he was still quick, explosive and played at a really high pace but you might have noticed through the tournament that he was able to win it without conjuring magical shots out of thin air. Sure, he still had his otherworldly touch and still relied on his ability to hit winners (the way he came out firing in the first game against Gawad was a treat to watch), but what was more impressive was how he was able to win matches by virtue of just outplaying his opponents and by moving them around rather than blazing past them in 45 minutes with 5 backhand volley nicks every game. 

Ramy's length all through the tournament was absolutely biting. He always sets up by moving his opponents and it may be that I haven't seen him play in a while, but he just seemed to play a much more intelligent, purposeful game as opposed to when he just knows he's better and will win regardless of what he does. He had a few lapses in concentration here and there but we all know he can't get going until he has at least one comeback from 0-2. Besides select few moments, his shots were more conservative than we're used to and for the most part it worked out well for him since he wasn't gifting too many points through unforced errors. As much as I love watching superhuman Ramy playing ridiculous shots and blitzing opponents off court, I really enjoyed seeing that he can play a different game and still win. He's just THAT good.",squash,A Different Side of Ramy's Game - Notes From his Win in HK,https://www.reddit.com/r/squash/comments/506yw0/a_different_side_of_ramys_game_notes_from_his_win/
