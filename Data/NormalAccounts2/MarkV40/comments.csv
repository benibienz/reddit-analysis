I've been told the Rick isn't that good on anything other than Rock/Metal but I haven't tried one myself. I feel like the Jazz Bass is a passive version of the T-Bird, weighs less and you will find it easier to find a case/bag for; The T-Bird because of its shape, size and weight is a bit harder to carry around.

74,"Yea I get that, though to get enough money to buy an upright I'll have to save for about 1.5-2 years (I'm a student) and I can't possibly wait that long. From some videos I looked up about the HB it seems to be decent, not overly good but not too bad either. Now, also spending 600$ for a bass that is primarily going to be my ""play for fun at home"" seems to not be worth it. I like to experiment with different sounds etc but there have been no instrument sellers in my city since ~2009-2010 because of the economic crisis and I cannot go and check out anything unless I buy it.

I currently have a gtx 770 2gb which doesnt get me anywhere around 60 fps on the latest games, is it possible game on a lower resolution than 1440p on a 1440p without having that much of a problem (does it look weird/warped) ? Would dropping your game res to 2560x1080 be good ? I can't buy both the monitor and the GPU together so I'll have to choose what to buy first and I thought buying the GPU would be better considering I can use it right now to game on my current monitor and upgrade to a 1440p later but considering what you told me I think I want a 1440p more than I want a GPU atm :)",2016-05-23 15:51:46+00:00,d3ghjie,2.0,t1_d3gau6e,10899.0,ultrawidemasterrace

It can be extremely powerful on a campaign where the main enemy is an undead wizard/warlock, a lich etc. but in general most of the damage players receive is fire damage. I think it's a nice addition anyway, but having damage scaling on life's flame might be a tad better, OR adding cold damage immunity on Grim Reaper might be an even better idea so you can protect your teammates in case you implement what I suggested in my previous comment regarding casting a spell at 9th level.

162,"To put it simply, if you want to make it look better you will have to spend about ~300$ worth of stuff. You will have to buy replacement cables for your PSU, buy a new CPU cooler, although that might be difficult considering your size limitations, an AIO liquid cooler might look horrible in there (if youre going anyway for one buy one with LEDs on the pump. It will make it look better). For the PSU shroud, if the fan is on the bottom it should not interfere in any way. If you're going to make one make it in a rough black textured metal and design something to put on top (your favorite GPU/CPU manufacturer, your name or a name for your build, throw some LEDs there as well, under the logo). You should be able to find a backplate for your GPU but they tend to be a bit pricey. I would also recommend getting an RGB led strip (the NZXT Hue+ is amazing) to break the monotone colors of the build.
