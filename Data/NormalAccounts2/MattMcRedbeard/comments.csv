1,"I see what people are saying about Lidstrom, it can't be denied the Wings defense has been lost at sea since Lids retired, but I'm going to be biased and unbiased in my saying that I dont think there is a captain to lead their team better than Yzerman ever, he's one of the greatest 2 way players, he knows how to motivate a team and when it comes down to it he knows how to pull through anything, players dont want to let him down, his grit and determination are much needed now more than ever. So I'm gonna say THE Captain.",2016-10-16 01:13:11+00:00,d8trogv,1.0,t3_577ebv,263216.0,DetroitRedWings

7,"To start I dont want to come off as an asshole, perhaps you caught me in a sour mood, this isnt anything against you, but being a tattoo artist who genuinely takes an interest in what I tattoo on my clients, especially when it comes to cover ups to avoid tattooing over tribal with black roses, which is basically the equivalent of a bandaid, this is sad to look at, the roses are very poorly executed, the lines are choppy, thin, the shading doesnt make sense, and the top 2 look like rocks piled on rocks, and all of the pictures the artist referenced are within the first couple of pages of a google image search, the lack of creativity is unreal, the compass looks like it was done well, the cogs are cogs, but when 3/4 of the tattoo is taken over like this it makes it hard to bite your tongue, hope this doesnt upset or offend you thats not what I intended, but in the interest of having something to be proud of thats on your skin forever dont settle for this kind of work, it can be fixed definitely but for future reference take time to look at portfolios, shop around and get the right artist, even if this artist was still an apprentice he has no business touching a cover up if this is where is capabilities are, you dont just tackle something like this, you work your way up to it.",2016-09-22 17:12:25+00:00,d7xop1b,1.0,t3_53ynl9,17587.0,tattoos

20,"Thanks for the constructive criticism, though the effect I went for was intended, the neo traditional style I was going for doesnt touch entirely on realism, I'm from a coastal town where the sky at night is often colourful with blooming, not always full or flat transparent clouds where you can see the stars behind them so I went with a more vibrant sort of scheme, definitely not everyones cup of tea, but its what I was aiming for.",2016-09-18 03:38:03+00:00,d7rdfs6,3.0,t1_d7rcthj,1047.0,Art

I aimed to convey the emotion that though Venom had finally killed Spider-man theres a feeling of bittersweet mourning.
