I have been looking everywhere and can't seem to find an answer, I have the Samsung Galaxy S7, my headphones that came with the phone just recently broke, the issue is is that I loved how comfortable they were, but I cant find replacements of them anywhere except for cheap fake versions of them on Amazon, anyone know where I can find these online? Or suggest another comfortable version of non in ear earbuds?",samsung,Replacement S7 Headphones,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/58yxxy/replacement_s7_headphones/

I'm as die-hard a fan of the Red Wings as it gets, and a big fan or Datsyuk as well. I will say the man, the myth, the legend and his unbelievable puck skill will be missed, its no doubt the end of an era, which to some can be terrifying, but put this entire situation into perspective.
Datsyuk when he announced his retirement had no idea what kind of position he would be putting the organization in, he assumed he'd just be hanging up his skates and walking away from the $7.5m. he was afforded for his final season, it was worth that much to him to see his daughter grow up that he put it all on the line, and it all blew up in his face. I genuinely believe we could have had a better playoff run if not for going into the playoffs with the black cloud and all the drama surrounding the team and Datsyuk in general.
On one hand it will be hard to move on from such a dominant player, and to fill the void in his salary cap because of the +35 rule, next season will be a tough one and I don't think anyone expects otherwise, but Datsyuk is in a bad spot right now, is not better to play from the heart rather than obligation? So many people and news articles are pressing for the will Datsyuk return scenario, when in all fairness I think what we need is to move forward without him, build a base we can work on rather than live in shadows of the past.
I don't in any capacity think Datsyuk will screw our team over in the one season he has left on his contract, but its in the air, his hearts not in it anymore, I feel as though it's time to welcome the new, and give Datsyuk the sendoff he deserves, push him to find success wherever he wants to be, celebrate him for all of his past efforts, hang his jersey to the rafters when hes eligible and welcome the new, and try to get rid of that $7.5m. instead of fight to make him play another season out of obligation.
