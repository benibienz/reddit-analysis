35,"CB - Would love a vet corner but the FA class doesn't look too strong. Trumaine Johnson would be a big upgrade as would Morris Claiborne. DJ Hayden is someone i've always had a soft spot for so maybe that's someone they'd look at.

ILB should be a priority so Dont'a Hightower is someone i'd love. Maybe Kiko Alonso could be a low risk high reward type signing. Timmons would be the big vain in the middle of Dick's D so he's the guy I would think has the highest chance to land here. Also, I have no idea and that was merely blind speculation.

WR - People will say Alshon but coming off a PED suspension i just don't think it would work out here. Terrelle Pryor would be a perfect fit for this team. Also, Michael Floyd has had a bad year (partially bc i don't think Palmer is that great) and he would be a sneaky fa signing that could boom. So far J.

528,"Confession time:

Last week at the game I was walking to my seat, minding my beeswax. I walk out of the tunnel and turn toward the aisle. A dude tries to cheers my beer and i leaned back to say something to a friend. The random guy shoved my shoulder pretty hard causing me to spill a lot of beer on myself and my friend. 

I squeezed my beer can onto the guy after he shoved me. Around 7 or so ounces directly into that jerks face.

But I instantly felt really horrible about it. It's about having fun, not acting like an ass hole in front of families and kids. No one got in trouble and there was no fight, but he whole thing just kind of ruined the day. 

So this is my apology to anyone that saw that and might have had a negative experience because of me. ",2016-09-16 14:28:40+00:00,d7p91mc,1.0,t3_531wv3,3192.0,Tennesseetitans

981,"Why DeMarco Murray could have a bounce-back year for the Titans: It seems as if Murray simply wasn‚Äôt a good match for the Eagles, who traded him to Tennessee this offseason after just one season with the team. Murray appeared to dislike running so many outside-zone plays, which caused him to run side to side before he could find a crease and cut up field. On Wednesday he said that he was excited by how his skill set matched the Tennessee running game.

In 2015 the Eagles were the most zone-heavy team in football, running some variety of zone concept on 95 percent of their runs. Tennessee was just 15th-highest, with only 62 percent of their runs involving zone.

While the Eagles barely ever dabbled in man-blocking gap concepts ‚Äî just 4 percent of their run plays ‚Äî the Titans ran that on almost a third of their running plays at 29 percent. Tennessee ran a far more balanced rushing offense with a near equal split of inside zone, outside zone and gap concepts.

The issue, however, isn‚Äôt the volume of outside zone the Eagles ran, but rather how they were running their zone plays. The Eagles actually ran far more inside zone than outside (59 to 36 percent) in 2015, but they ran it from the shotgun, forcing Murray to receive the hand-off running laterally and exposing him to the inevitable penetration that was routinely destroying the play.

In Dallas in 2014 he was taking the ball from the shotgun just 12.4 percent of the time, but that number was 86.0 percent in 2015 with the Eagles. When he took the ball from under center with the Eagles his average was still 4.5 yards per attempt, or just a hair below the 4.8 it was with the Cowboys the year before.

Only 21.4 percent of Tennessee‚Äôs runs came from the shotgun in 2015, and if that is at a similar rate this season, that increased Murray‚Äôs chances to bounce back with a big year. His 2014 season was not simply a product of an excellent Dallas offensive line, but a perfect schematic match for his skills. His marriage with the Eagles was an ill-fated one, but the Titans should be a far better fit.",2016-06-23 14:49:24+00:00,d4ktvw5,1.0,t3_4ph3fd,26.0,Tennesseetitans

1450,"For those who don't want to read the whole article, here are the Titans picks:

#1 - Jalen Ramsey, CB, Florida State
Back in Mock Draft 4.0, Ramsey grabbed the top spot and he remains the pick for the Titans. He‚Äôs an excellent all-around player, capable of playing underneath zone coverage while providing the best run support in the draft of any cornerback. The upside is what separates Ramsey. He has the size and athleticism to develop into a top man-coverage corner, but he‚Äôs not there yet, and at worst, he‚Äôs a versatile zone/man corner that‚Äôs also capable of playing free safety. Ramsey gives the Titans a lot of options on defense.


#33- Vernon Butler, DE, Louisiana Tech
Butler fits Tennessee‚Äôs 3-4 defense as a defensive end, as he‚Äôs strong in the run game (fifth in the nation in 2015) while showing the ability to push the pocket from the interior.


#64 - De‚ÄôVante Harris, CB, Texas A&amp;M
An unsung corner, Harris has strong movement skills that led to the sixth-best coverage grade in the class in 2015 at +11.5.

So, in closing, it's the NBA's fault that I have to use a 3rd party site. I can look the other way at the ""crime"" I am committing because the nba viewing restrictions are bullshit.
