Sankey was always a fan favorite here. He was so valuable that we made him the 1st running back taken in the draft! Does that get the trade juices flowing??

Bishop Sankey isn't just a regular running back. He's a hard-working grinder that was raised with a military background. He's going to be the hardest worker on the team. So if you need a guy that brings his lunchpail, Sankey is what you are looking for. He's from a military background and has incredible work-ethic. 

Extremely disciplined! All-Around gym rat! Very strong!

So in short, We promise he'll be worth whatever you're willing to trade. We really don't want to get rid of him ,becuase he's really good we swear, but I guess we could make an exception to any team out there that's interested. 

Also, his dad was in the military. So you know he's going to work hard.",Tennesseetitans,To NFL GM's looking to trade for Bishop Sankey,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennesseetitans/comments/4p1az6/to_nfl_gms_looking_to_trade_for_bishop_sankey/
