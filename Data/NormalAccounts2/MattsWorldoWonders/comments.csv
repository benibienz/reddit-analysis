0,"I had an SVT fridge and got tired of maintenance issues and weight.  I shopped around and bought an Aguilar TH500 and SL410.  Never played the SVT at a gig again.  I traded it for a B15 that hangs out in my studio.    
 
I loved my SVT, but there's just not much of a need for it with my current gig.  I'm either playing in a small club where I can't crank it enough for the signature tone, or I'm on a big festival stage where they refuse to mic it, only DI.  
 
Not dumb at all. It's time for some new toys!

6,"I can't remember who I ripped this off from, but I've used it for years. 

got a piece of PVC pipe, 3/4"" I think, and glued an end cap on one end.  It's long enough to contain my strings.  I take the strings off, stick them in the tube, then soak them in denatured alcohol at least an hour or so.  Once they're out I wipe each one down with a clean cloth, let it air out for a while, then hit it with the cloth again.  It cuts the crud off, and they don't sound brand-new after.   
 
While it's soaking, I clean the fretboard with a Murphy's Oil Soap solution, dry it, apply linseed oil, dry that, then wipe the whole thing off and let it dry again. 
 
So far it's worked, and I don't have to worry about wearing in new strings.",2016-11-12 18:40:30+00:00,d9xfh1a,2,t1_d9w0ywd,92612,Bass

My band recorded our entire library over several rehearsals.  Each song is recorded EXACTLY the way we perform it live, so I'll go over at least three songs just to warm up.   
 
Next, I'll pick a particular lesson, drill, or technique I'd get something out of, then work on it to a click track or YouTube drum track. 
 
Finally, I'll go back to the session rehearsals and run through two or three more songs, especially the tougher ones.

127,"I'm not OP, but a 25 year cop with experience in patrol, detectives, SWAT and leadership.  Short answer is that it's helpful in some areas, but not in others.

The most useful training I received wasn't in college.  I had a few management and police administration classes in my degrees, and while they were useful, my most valued leadership training was police-specific and wasn't in college.  

I've seen high school grads or ex military cops outperform college grads to the point I don't put much weight on college education in hiring.  That goes for just about any profession, as I feel that way about many career fields in my country when talking about college.
 
Videos like the one that spawned this conversation have been the largest game changer in my profession.  I saw it start when we got in-car cameras in the 90's.

 Again, IN MY EXPERIENCE, the toughest issue to overcome in our profession in terms of leadership and public contact is the failure to understand the difference between physical and emotional courage.  You can teach police to have faith in their training and run toward gunfire to stop an active shooter.  It's tougher to train someone to not be an asshole.  The vid we're talking about on this thread exemplifies that.  That cop may be the guy you want with you in a shitstorm, but he didn't show the emotional courage to handle that situation differently.

Every problem I've had, or even heard of, with an all-tube is in the power section where all the insanely high voltages hang out.  Also, the ""hybrid"" types lack the giant power section transformers so they're much lighter.  Honestly, I think the difference in tone is negligible compared to all-valve, but weight and all the other factors I mentioned make the pro series the way to go.  Tube preamps with solid state power sections in the bass world are a much more viable option than with guitar amps.

I planned to tell them they needed to leave, but one of them took me aside and told me they were taking an out-of-town friend on a snipe hunt as a much deserved act of revenge.  I couldn't resist and joined in.  Winks and nods were exchanged, I called my shift on a radio back channel and the snipe hunter was called front and center.  I informed him that the snipe is an endangered species and the act of hunting one was a felony punishable by 10 years in prison and a $10000 fine.  All of his conspirators denied snipe hunting, saying that they were just stargazing and didn't know the guy doing the hunting.  He was standing there, wide-eyed and literally holding the bag with his snipe stick in the other hand.  He stuttered and stammered an excuse and insisted the conspirators were lying.  About that time, three more cruisers appeared, lights and all.  As if choreographed, we all stepped aside and the sheriff himself made an entrance and assessed the situation.  Dead silence.  After he made the inquiries, we all busted out laughing.  The whole otherwise very slow night was captured in a group picture, complete with the victim, his friends, my shift, and the sheriff.
