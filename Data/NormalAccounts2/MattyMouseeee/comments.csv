7,"Right off the bat, the lighting in the beginning of the video is very dim. I noticed it got brighter later into the video but it is important to be consistent. Second: I think it would be better for you to present  you experiments with the camera facing your front and not your side. That way there is a clear view of all your materials and your work space. Finally: If you creating a video teaching people how to do something, make sure that you do it the correct way in your video as well.
