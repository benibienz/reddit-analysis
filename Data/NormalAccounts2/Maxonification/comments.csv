0,"I forgot to mention that we do have 2 of a similar shelf but the acrylics are in the white staples totes. It's really hard to stack them in those boxes, so they are just thrown in them. Super annoying. 

Would you suggest I lose the totes and just stack the acrylics? ",2016-09-21 08:16:56+00:00,d7vrogc,2.0,t1_d7vlqm5,15171.0,Staples

3,"I am working this position right now and have been the last two weeks as well covering the usual guys vacation. I was working 430-930 on Saturdays. And 4, 4 hour opening shifts the rest of the week. As soon as I get in I usually check thr signage menu for any tags from Home Office. Tuesday's I did the audit. Thursday I did clearance tags and shot any missing tags. Friday's I tore the tags for the ad for Sunday. And Saturdays I'd go in and pull expired tags and do the take down report and as soon as we closed put up the ad as fast as possible. Doing a full time job with part time hours made it so I had to work faster, and be organized. When tearing tags I found it best to just tear all the tags and then sort them by aisle and paperclip them off, grab a hand basket with the red tag covers and the clear shelf tags and go aisle by aisle. Let me know if you have any other questions. ",2016-07-10 09:45:59+00:00,d56ig2w,1.0,t3_4s4ov6,4797.0,Staples
