On the other hand, they argue that bitcoin shouldn't be a payment system for everyone, but a settlement layer for banks and companies.

Progressives want the network to continue to be a payment system for all, basically digital cash.

2219,"&gt;Because as the people started to adopt bitcoin

And here starts the problem with this reasoning. We are still very far from people starting to adopt bitcoin, and there 's a huge stone wall front of bitcoin currently (1MB limit).

In analogy, what we have seen in the past 7 years is merely the segmentation of an egg, very far from the actual birth of the organism.

There are billions of internet connected people, the current level of adoption is such a small fraction, if bitcoin disappeared tomorrow, the world wouldn't even notice it.

&gt; If I am correct, the relevant 'security' is in regard to the supply cap and the capacity cap. 

I believe that you are partially incorrect.

The supply cap is very important, it's the basis of it being sound money, no arguments there.

Crippling the capacity however is not remotely a security feature. Implying otherwise makes me think that you haven't comprehended the incentive structure of this system and cannot comprehend how valuation works.

Small blockists often argue that rising the cap will lead to centralization. I strongly oppose to this idea.

By limiting capacity (obviously it's much below the limit the infrastructure could allow), you inherently limit the number of entities that the network can accommodate.

By limiting the number of entities you basically put a cap on the level of decentralization the network can achieve paralelly. 

What size of userbase can achieve better decentralization? A userbase of 5million or 500 million? (think about the fact, that a fraction of the potential users could overpower all the current bitcoin miners easily, and even a tiny fraction could outnumber the existing nodes)

The 'rising the limit = centralization"" argument falls on its face again, when you consider why Bitcoin has value and how its value is secured, and that all the proposed layer 2 solutions require a much bigger blocksize limit.

Bitcoin has value because humans value it, humans value it because it's useful. By useful, I mean all aspects of usage, from spending, savings, basically all forms of value transfer or placing records in the blockchain.

If you consider the evolution of money from barter to fiat currencies, I think it should be clear that money has network effect. The bigger it is, the stronger the money is.

The standard you speculate based on Nash's work cannot function on a system which is crippled and cannot be used and is not open to people directly.

Miners have a very limited task for which they get a bitcoin subsidy during the bootstrapping phase (basically ending in 2040) and tx fees which gradually supplement the reward.

By limiting capacity, you cannot ever supplement the reward, hence you basically destroy the incentive to secure the network.

The other aspect of security is valuation itself.

Note how the 1MB limit was put in place when bitcoin did not have value. It defended against a flood attack as it was basically free to fill up the blocks. As bitcoin gained value, now the limit makes it cheap to attack the network.

This makes me wonder:

If you keep the network crippled without making it permissioned, how can it ever be reliable basis for systems on top, when a hostile entity could just create a persistent tx flood attack, meaning perpetually escalating fees?

How can it be any kind of standard, when it's trivial to disrupt?

Furthermore, It's highly unlikely if not impossible that the status quo can be rendered powerless without violence, especially not in my or my children's lifetime which ultimately matters.

Without demolishing the status quo, you cannot make them use your ideal money standard. They will imprison/exterminate people before they would let their power vanish, or if they go broke it just opens the door to yet another violent power grab.

So, no, your interpretation of Nash is not just incorrect in the context of bitcoin but inadequate to explain the BlockstreamCore agenda.",2016-04-26 00:51:09+00:00,d2hb4c1,12.0,t1_d2h88rd,4367.0,btc

If the limit would be lifted completely, you wouldn't see huge blocks, as the size of the blocks depends on 2 factors, the number of transactions in the mempool and the miner's preference.

Well, the blocks are consistently full, while inherently limiting the network to about 2.8tx/s.

The 1MB limit became an attack vector.

The number of daily transactions are steadily growing since the network started, observable on the blockchain.

You are full of shit just as any other blind or hostile small blocker.

The possible use cases for bitcoin has been expanding front of our eyes, so your point is idiotic.
