As I see it, if we win this war it will further prove that Bitcoin is antifragile and will certainly boost the confidence of many investors and users on the sidelines, and it's the only path enabling growth.

I think it would be important if everyone understood that even a split is beneficial for all parties and enables people to vote with their wallet who otherwise do not run a node or mine.

The best course of action when the time comes is to dump cripplecoin for Bitcoin.

Competition usually solves comparable issues on markets.

This thought occured to me while working in a remote location.

Provider A enjoyed government warranted monopoly of providing internet services to the region for years, as you can imagine they have never invested anything back.

To this day, they offer 2Mbit/256KBit ADSL.

Provider B noticed the issue and started to offer 20MBit/10Mbit over wireless.

It took about 2 years since the roll out and now provider B has 99.9% marketshare in the region, while provider A just started to come back with better offerings.

I find the following scenarios likely:

- Paid to support Borgstream

- Developed a mental illness

- Replaced by TPTB

I find it less likely that he geniunely changed his mind, as he seemed to hold very strong libertarian values and shared the original vision of bitcoin for years.

While progress has been explosive prior to the blockstream takeover, since then it's basically stagnation only, so I find it hard to believe that someone involved for so long could make such a bad judgement.
