So many academics decided on incomplete understanding, and an outright contempt of the subculture, that they knew what was right. Some even thought they had the wisdom to shape that culture.  Guess what?  That input was insulting and it just reinforced the idea that scholarship is disconnected from the real world. 

Also, many many people were not just unintentional aggressors, they were intentional aggressors.  They used their academic work to reinforce their own prejudices and spread shoddy research.  Those people are poor scholars and other academics should be ashamed of them.

General FAQ
Q: What is the size limit on mods?
A: There is no size limit!

Q: If I delete a mod from Bethesda.net, is it permanently removed from Bethesda.net?
A: Yes. However, any users who have downloaded the mod will still have a copy locally. If they delete it, they will be unable to download it again.

Q: What does the [M] or [Modded] mean in my saved games list?
A: If you run with Mods active, any saves created are specially flagged as a Modded saved game. We create a separate character filter, so users can easily find their modded vs non-modded characters and saved games.

Q: Can I access my local Mods in game if I'm not logged onto Bethesda.net?
A: No, but we are working on an update to allow this in future update.

They're all award nominees. Some of them are award winners. They've written dozens of bestselling novels. Many of the women in this bundle have written Star Trek tie-in novels. Others have written for popular games. And of course, we've written in their own universes. They're here to share their universes with you.
