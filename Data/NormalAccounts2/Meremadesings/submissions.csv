The allowed/disallowed list will also have some changes.  Gematsu and Gameranx will be moved off the disallowed list. Most people responding to the discussion post didn't care about Eurogamer.

Gameranx  has updated their ethics policy and appears to be sticking to it.  A write up can be found here:  http://blogjob.com/oneangrygamer/2015/06/gamergate-gameranx-updates-ethics-policy/
