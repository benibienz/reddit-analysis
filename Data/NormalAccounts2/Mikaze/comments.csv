Questing forces you to slow down with the attack range decrease on any hero with an attack that can go offscreen. In any PvP or PvC scenario, the two opposing teams are so close that this effect is not even noticeable. The only reason to nerf the range is to slow down quest completion.  

6-30 boss that goes invincible on his first attack just wastes time and could be done without this unnecessary effect.  

Unusually high armor or resistance on monsters that force you to take extreme amounts of time to kill even with the highest amount of penetration available on two attack slots.

160,"Removing tanking for allies is a direct buff. When her passive activates, she is **forced** to take damage for allies which makes her comp more focused on keeping May alive rather than Yolofort + anyone.  

The damage tanking also knocks May back significantly which is the main gripe I have with SSB (no knockback on May wtf?). The only thing we need to fix on May is one of the following:  

1. Damage  

She deals far to much damage for how easily her passive is activated. She self procs on almost every enemy attack including autos. For example, look at Dorothy. 1/5 the HP, requires 4 blocks and only removes buffs 5 times at best while damage is shit in the current Metagame.  

2. Health  

Far too much for a damage dealing type character. Defensive stat based damage have no downside on their upgrades compared to pure DPS units who require sacrifice of defense to deal more damage.  

3. Too many hits  

Her debuff effect applies with every spinning hit and this also allows her to bypass physical defensive tanks such as Joan and completely ignore Mew's SBW as well. Lower the hits to 3-5 and scale damage accordingly.  

4. Class  

Being a Paladin, May gains access to some of the best skills in the game (AoP, Revo, SoC). Moving her to a warrior would have been better as there are less skills that would allow her to tank as well as a pure tanking character (Alex).  

5. Base stats  

Why would a 1000% HP scaled damage dealing hero be given more HP than Roland, more Res than alex and a higher CD and CC berry cap compared to DPS heroes. It makes no sense whatsoever.",2016-03-24 08:59:08+00:00,d1bk8ea,2.0,t1_d1bh3yq,10976.0,crusadersquest

321,"Necron at it's current state is far too powerful only because his minion has no set duration and there is absolutely no punishment for it dying. I would actually like to see more SBWs like Demona's where they trade off other stats to excel at something else.   

Look at Korin whose passive is a shield generates with her chain-3 that absorbs damage from allies. And Necron whose minion is **able to be healed**, can chase off allies or himself for a massive 20k piercing damage fireball and has a base 50% damage reduction and take damages for all allies like Alex.  

Both heroes utilities are completely skewed even with SBWs. And this is where you can see the unbalance between two heroes. Korin's only passive is her shield and ability to deal damage against high attack foes but Necron who is a jack-of-all-trades type of character outshines her in every way.  

NHN needs to get more players into its development such as having a mix of new and veteran players test unreleased SBWs/Heroes and give their opinions on them. The reason for new players is so we can get insight on how fresh players view the game since we want them to keep playing the game and add to the community.  

Nevertheless, I would like to see more buffs to heroes to make them stronger in the areas they would normally specialize in.

Farming for that one particular SBW, the weapon upgrades, gems spent on rerolling weapon slots. All these were not even considered.   

For example everyone that wasted their gold re-rolling Thor's SBW. Did I see them giving the players who had invested into the hammer time a few days before the nerf a free upgrade of their choice?  

Not at all. Over millions of gold wasted and not a single compensation worth a damn. A few thousand iron won't cut it compared to giving the players a re-forging ticket and upgrade of their choice.  

Everyone who spent gems and rerolled to a D/D just shot themselves in the foot and no compensation to boot.

483,"The current reigning SBWs are owned by Himiko, Abel and Necron. The only free SBWs that are able to compete is probably Mew and Hanzo. Maybe Yeowoodong and Korin too.  

But the difference between the free and the premium weapons are that the free SBWs require *perfect slots and upgrades* while Himi, Necron and Abel can just be splashed on since they all have such high utility that regardless of the slots, can still dominate the meta. 

Abel is the buffed version of pre-nerf Thor. I main him with a perfect A/D SBW and full berries and he **NEVER** dies. He can proc himself without chasing, can heal off every hit and his SBW effect basically does 8-9 slashes every 5th reflect that hits for 1.7k (3.3k crit) each in Colosseum. Also, those slashes can pierce and he also charges forward like Uzimant which is also a plus.  

Necron is self-explanatory. Self-buff, healing, 50%DR and a disposable Alex with a summoning condition as easy as Lilith getting tMS. Also hits like a truck but is only made broken due to Himiko. Speaking of her...  

Himiko. Free chain-3s, so much debuffs that you can't play any character that relies on attack power to deal damage. Necron is only viable in Colosseum due to Himiko's free chain-3 proccing the fireball attack so quickly and reliably. Is also tankier than Nurspy even though her abilities already negate half of the hero pool from being used.",2015-12-30 12:38:07+00:00,cyg2juj,6.0,t1_cyg2f8b,472.0,crusadersquest

Even then, getting the weapon required to even compete is going to be tedious. They can't do FoS 8 like us everyday. The moment they hit level 60 is when they instantly get paired up with endgame players like us in their colo matchups.  

I think the game itself is not getting any new players due to the steep incline at the start of the game. There is no way for them to catch up since general rate ups are now gone and retuning players like some of my RL friends just get wrecked if they don't have either Himiko, Abel or Necron's SBW.

Once you unlock the kiss or break-out secret, you can instantly raise the rank back to pink just by tapping the dialogue line and performing the necessary actions.  

To kiss the character, the character in question will first ask why she has to move closer (?) then she will inch forwards and close her eyes. At this point, just tap the character's lips and the rest is self-explanatory.

Neptune was still on the bed, her legs spread apart with male fluids leaking from her used orifices.  

The man felt a presence closing in behind him but he could not feel his legs respond to his desire to run. His vision began to dim as he tried to grasp for air only to find that his body was impaled to the wall through his heart.  

Through his blurred vision, a figure's hand found its way to his throat and their grip began to tighten like a vice. The man's throat was filled with his own blood, unable to cough it out due to the hand strangling him.

Taking out a handkerchief from her pocket, Uni cupped Nepgear's cheek and steadily inched the hand holding the cloth towards her face.  

As her hand moved closer, Uni could not help but stare at those alluring lips coated and smothered with sauce. Leaning her face closer, the thought of their lips only a few moments away from touching...

If we had more heroes who specialized in dealing with buffs, SoI and tMR would not even need to be touched since there are counters readily available for use.  

Most of the problems on heroes stems from Colosseum/SSB and not PvE. Nerfing heroes all because of one type of game mode that favors high initial burst damage over sustained fights makes the game feel boring.  

After all, why bother wasting gold training hero X or getting skill Y when they're going to be nerfed anytime. Take for example Hanzo gets nerfed. His role is just going to be taken over by Arona's SBW. Then what? Everybody is going to start complaining how Arona is overpowered with SBW.  

A hero that is exactly like Hanzo, they're both heroes that no one bothers about until they see use with SBW.

Being able to bypass every form of defensive buff (especially after Korin's SBW got nerfed) whilst killing the backrow with high damage is really a pain to deal with. I think removing his buff removal would be a reasonable nerf while keeping his utility high as a armor shredder due to the influx of berried heroes.  

I agree with what you're saying but I feel that buffing heroes should be prioritized over nerfing popular picks. Creating counter-play should be what the developers need to strive for. We **DO** have a large pool of heroes after all.  

Another unrelated note: We've just done a hammer and skill time event. I think nerfing heroes/skills immediately after everyone has spent gold perfecting their desired character may cause quite a lot of rage.",2015-12-02 16:48:55+00:00,cxkitvk,6.0,t1_cxkihfy,501.0,crusadersquest

Hanzo just needs to be tweaked slightly by replacing his buff removal ability with a stronger armor shredding to counter berried heroes. This way, heroes such as Maria, Alex and even Joan with SBW will hard counter Hanzo since he won't be able to remove their buffs.

805,"Mandy has line damage that can guarantee a hit with her shots unlike Sneak's block skill Consecutive Fire which has a random spread applied to it. Sneak actually suffers from having blocks stacked to 2 or 3 chain while Mandy can utilize any chain extremely well. The lack of instant burst damage without 2 or 3 chaining with Mandy may sometimes affect whether you win or lose.


With the release of Roland and Rochefort, ease of block generation actually improves the use of Mandy since she fires 2 more times with each ally block use. This makes her much more block efficient than Sneak and most other hunters in general.  


Along with having block efficiency, she also has a lot of utility such as being one of only three characters to be able to reduce resistance (Hikari SBW and Sentinel are the only others). This makes her pair well with magic dealing leads since she only needs one block to reduce resistance. If you run her as leader, 1 and 2-chains will provide damage, knockback and stun as utility.  


Another thing to note about Sneak is that he needs to be run with extremely good weapon upgrades or a Susanoo to truly show off his damage potential but with the current state of Colo you may not be able to survive with a glass cannon team as AI keeps cheating.

1004,"It's not that she's useless but rather what she uses as her damage type (Magic damage). There are few heroes that can reliably reduce resistance Archon/Mandy and one requires a chain-3 while the other is a premium only hero. 

With the abundance of tanks like Alexander, Thor and Roland, premium hunters overshadow her in burst damage with fewer blocks as well as having access to Susanoo for armor shredding. Having the lack of burst puts her at an extreme disadvantage because she won't be able to kill the back-row in a single burst while still having the absurdly long animation that only hits the front line tanks with absurd resistance.

Also note that I am using a HA/Great HA%/Great Rpen weapon on Teresa (+3) before this patch and she can't even kill a +3 sneak in a single chain-3 and Hunters are supposed to have low resistance.",2015-06-25 05:58:57+00:00,cshz6a9,7.0,t1_cshz0pq,437.0,crusadersquest
