Next is his damage reduction at 2/3 of his max hp. My Korin does normal damage up till he reaches about 200k hp where the damage suddenly drops to about 200 to 300 per talisman which is absurd.

**Latest Revision: 2nd January, 2016**  
**Changes include: Adding Secret dialogue names. Noire is no longer free with App download.**  

Note: This guide is for the Japanese version of the App.  

Contents:  
1. Introduction  
2. Settings  
3. Alarm  
4. Schedule  
5. Profile + (Costume images)  
6. Character Select  
7. Gallery  
8. How to unlock secrets  

**Introduction**  
Let's begin! First, take a look at the [main screen](http://i.imgur.com/5CxU10X.jpg). On the top left you will notice a familiar symbol you might find in the games. That will be your Love (Lily) rank.  

It starts from green and rises every 2-3 days if you return to the app and press the 'Touch Communication' button at least once each day. It will rise to yellow followed by pink.  

Failing to return to the game for a day will cause your rank to drop back to the previous level. Rank images [here](http://i.imgur.com/hLvj0bJ.jpg)  

Tap the 'Menu Open' button on the bottom left of the screen and you will be brought to a [menu](http://i.imgur.com/kHSfwnd.jpg) which surprisingly, is in English.  

Lets go through the stuff starting from the bottom but I will leave Gallery for last since it's going to take a long while to write about..  

**[Settings](http://imgur.com/QLa9y2s.jpg)**  
Once you make it into the settings, this is the menu that you'll be greeted with. From the top, the first button you will notice is actually a birthday setter.  

To use it, tap the button and you will be greeted with [this](http://i.imgur.com/RHVvLo1.jpg). Input your birthday and get a special dialogue on that day itself. On the left is the month and on the right is the day.  

Below the birthday setter is the volume controls. BGM for the music, SE for the effects you get when you tap menu buttons and Voice is... voice.  

I have no idea what the thing below the volume does so just leave it on.  

The voice skip enables you to skip voices. The option below the voice skip is a backdrop selector.   

You can choose from many different locations in the Ultradimension for your character such as the Basilicom or the Japanese style Lowee. Also note that the BGM will change according to the backdrop used.  

**Extremely important!** Do not press the option below the backdrop selector / above the Compile Heart advertisement. It completely wipes off all affection and unlocked secrets and resets the character back to nothing.  

**[Alarm](http://i.imgur.com/aumFCv9.jpg)**  
The alarm interface is pretty simple. On the left option, you set your alarm in Hours and Minutes respectively. Picking the right option, you can choose how long the snooze will last. From 0 to 20 minutes. Once the clock reaches the set time, your active goddess of choice will wake you with different tones depending on your current Love (Lily) rank.  

**Schedule**  
It links to your phone's own schedule but I found it very annoying to use. I have little to no experience with this one...  

**[Profile](http://i.imgur.com/MVbQpFI.jpg)**  
Everyone's favorite menu. You can view the current goddess's information and full body view of all costumes unlocked.  

Information from the top include the VAs name, presiding nation, height, weight, bust size, cup size, waist size and hip size. Scrolling to the right of the box will show the goddess's favorite type of game and some bio that I can't read.  

Character|Outfits Available|

**[Character Select](http://i.imgur.com/l8ZbQOj.jpg)**  
Here, you can view all characters you have unlocked. Menu icons in blue are the costumes and icons in green are the purchasable dialogue lines. The app itself includes Neptune for free but Noire, Nepgear, Vert, Blanc and their respective costumes &amp; lines must be purchased individually.  

**[Gallery Mode](http://i.imgur.com/o01McsW.jpg)**  
I'll be splitting this part of the guide into two separate parts. The menus and how to unlock the secret dialogues.  

From the top, the box in cyan indicates dialogue lines that are included with the costumes. e.g Noire's Strawberry Polka or Classical Maid Neptune.  

The box in green holds the compilation of all dialogue lines available for that character excluding costume lines. Either included with the download or purchased, they can all be accessed and rewatched from this menu.  

The last box in dark blue is the menu for the secret lines. The type of secret lines are the same across all characters but the difference is how they respond and react to you.  

**How to unlock secrets**  
There are 6 secrets for each character. The 3rd, 4th and 5th secrets are unlocked in the same way for all characters. The final secret (Confession) is unlocked when the prerequisites are fulfilled which are to unlock the other 5 secrets.  

The 1st and 2nd secrets require the swimsuit and alternate costume respectively.  

The swimsuit costume unlocks the ""わたしの１番好き？"" dialogue. This is translated as ""Do you like me the most?"". To unlock this secret, go into the cyan box and locate the current goddess's swimsuit dialogue box. This will be the second from the top for Neptune, Noire and Nepgear and the third for Blanc and Vert.  

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/qacTA3T.jpg) is what it looks like expanded. See the first dialogue ""な、なんで水着..."". Press that and you will return to the main screen to listen to the dialogue. Repeat this 10 times to unlock the 1st secret.  

This picture shown is for Noire. For the other goddesses, just go to their swimsuit costume lines and press the first option from the top and repeat 10 times.

Charater|Costume Required|
:--|:--|
Neptune|シトラスフリル (Citrus Frill)|
Noire|ストロべリーポルカ (Strawberry Polka)|
Nepgear|ストライプモー二 (Stripe Money)|
Vert|マーメイドパレオ (Mermaid Pareo)|
Blanc|朱花/水着 (Vermillion Flower Swimsuit) |
         

For the 2nd secret, ”そっちこ行くよ” You will need the alternate costumes for each character. Below are the names of the costumes you will need to have.  

Charater|Costume Required|
:--|:--|
Neptune|パーカーワンピ (Parka One-piece)|
Noire|クリアドレス (Clear Dress)|
Nepgear|スマイル・スパイラル (Smile Spiral)|
Vert|プリンセスドレス (Princess Dress)|
Blanc|シロ (White) |

To unlock the 2nd secret, similar to the 1st one, go to the relevant costume for the goddess of your choice and run the first option 10 times. This secret allows you to view the goddess attempt to come to your side through your phone screen.  

The 3rd, 4th and 5th secrets require you to purchase **all** dialogue lines and have a maxed out Love (Lily) Rank. To unlock, go to the green box in the gallery and run through **every** dialogue line starting from the [top](http://i.imgur.com/bGGXiCs.jpg). Do this for all sub-categories in the green box.

1. Shields and Necron's SBW.  
In SSB where the damage reduction is much higher than Colosseum, effects that reduce damage % or grant a fixed damage protection become much more powerful than intended. Needs to be rebalanced to fit the damage reduction.  

2. Healing.  
This one is completely unecessary. Why do they even need to reduce the healing in SSB to the point where the only reasons to put a priest into your team is for block generation (yeo/mew) or utility (Himiko/Dara/Woompa). At this point, every other healer that excels at healing are completely useless at their jobs and ruins certain teams.  

3. Invincible respawn.  
This one is a bit of a hit and miss. On one hand, it punishes players that sustain through the first wave and have no beast upgrades while players who just respawned have no block advantage other than the first 5 blocks and have to face sustain teams that already have their engine going. It is unfair to both sides and needs to be addressed.  

4. Distance.  
The length between the two beasts during the start of the fight is far too wide. It gives massive advantage to heroes that have a linear hit skill (d'art/Necron(SBW)/hanzo) while heroes such as Sasquatch, Wilhelm or r-0 can't do anything to the enemy. By that time, they'll probably already be dead or severely damaged.  

5. Beasts.  
Still super smash Bella.  

6. AI piloting.  
After someone leaves a match midway, the AI will begin to pilot their team. Has no respawn time and still gets invincible on respawn. It should be one or the other and not both. Also occasionally h's a bug where they become godmoded and don't use blocks.  

7. Colosseum ranking.

**Grand Mechanic Himiko** (Hunter)  
As a child, Himiko was ecstatic at tinkering with machines and decided to study mechanics. She soon became the greatest mechanic in Himiko and sworn her oath to protect the Himiko Empire.  

**Fire God's Mechanization**: Calls forth a mechanized flame spirit that fires (5/10/20) barrier bullets each dealing 20% of the hero's attack power as magic damage based on the chain number.  
**Passive**: When hitting a debuffed enemy, reduces (Damage/attack speed/Critical Chance) by (17.25%/20%/20%). If a Fire God's barrier is active, deal additional 5% of the hero's health as neutral damage on each hit to enemies within the barrier.  


**Empress Himiko II** (Paladin)  
A Clone of the original Empress Himiko. When her powers were discovered to be not as strong as the original, she was planned to be disposed of by Himiko. Saved by Grand Shaman Himiko, she now plans to use her powers to end the empire that created her.  

**Fire God's Divinity**: Slams a divine barrier on the ground dealing (100%/100%/250%) of the hero's attack power as physical damage. Barrier surrounds around allies, increasing (Armor/Resistance/Damage Reduction) by (75%/75%/35%) for (3/3/5) seconds depending on the chain number.  
**Passive**: A block used after an ally chain-3 skill is treated as a chain-3 skill. If enemy is debuffed during the activation of Fire God's Divinity, effects are doubled.   


**Ofuda Master Himiko** (Warrior)  
Training in the art of talisman crafting since she was born, her talismans have been spoken in legends to be feared by the apostles themselves. She aids the heroes brought forth by the Himiko goddesses by granting them talismans of protection.  

**Mark of the Chosen**: Deals (100%/200%/350%) of the hero's attack power as physical damage and places talisman on (enemy/enemy/ally) that (reduces/reduces/increases) the affected targets' (resistance/critical damage/Armor) equal to the hero's own respective stat for 5s depending on the chain used.  
**Passive**: Enemies hit with the mark of the chosen take damage equal to 50% of the hero's attack every time they try to attack whenever the hero is buffed. If [Death Messenger Himiko] is in the team, on every 20th critical hit summons the onusa and ofuda serpents dealing 1000% of the hero's and hit enemy's own attack and reduces damage dealt by hit target for 95% for the next 5s. (Activates once in 15s)  


**Himiko of Balance** (Priest)  
Seeking tortured souls trapped by the apostles, Himiko roams the world freeing these tormented spirits. The Life and Death Goddesses granted her their strength to protect herself from the apostles lusting for her power. With both goddesses in her soul, she is able to temporarily rewrite the boundary between life and death and she uses this power to protect her allies in the everlasting battle against the apostles.

**Death and Rebirth**: When a block is used, rewrites the boundary between worlds for (1/1.25/1.5) seconds. Damage taken and dealt by allies are nullified and the hero heals allies by the same amount reduced.  
**Passive**: Whenever an allies' health drops to 0, deals neutral damage equal to 200% of the amount healed to each enemy.  


**Dragon Barrier Himiko** (Archer and included dragon with every patch)  
Himiko feels that there are not enough dragons in the game. So she brings forth more to fill in the surprising lack of dragons. She also has a secret crush on Fergus's vault.  

**Dragon Barrier Infinity**: Summons (1/5/7) dragons depending on chain number dealing 1% of the hero's attack power as damage.  
**Passive**: Each time the dragon hits a debuffed enemy, explodes into 10 more dragons (Passive applied). 

**Members of Himiko Empire**  
Himiko the Legendary Blacksmith  
Himiko the Skillmaster  
Colonel Himiko  
General Himiko (Not to be confused with the hero General Himiko)  
Himiko Droids  
Himiko foot-soldiers (Yes, they're all named Himiko)  

**Guest Appearance**  
Goddess Himiko  
Empress Himiko I
