The only exception to this would be if you have a boat or were to rent a pontoon or a waverunner and watch the fireworks from Crab Island, the lights exploding above you, illuminating the dark night (no lights out on the water) and reflecting off of the Gulf all around you. It's pretty amazing and easily the best way to watch the fireworks, especially if you have some acid. Just kidding. Kinda. That or they offer helicopter rides during the fireworks, that's pretty cool. Both options are pretty expensive but if you've got it like that, go for it. 

If you want to charter a boat or hop on one with some good people (maybe pitch in on gas), let me know. Both Harborwalk and Baytowne do fireworks at 8pm and 12am, so you could do the water thing at the Harbor for the 8pm show and then go to Baytowne for the countdown, or vice versa. Both places turn into a 21 and up party around 9 or 10pm so I guess it depends on what you're looking for. Where you're staying would factor in too, as they're literally on completely opposite sides if Destin and traffic will be a dangerous nightmare.",2016-11-14 16:36:58+00:00,d9zyegl,3.0,t1_d9zx708,1577.0,Destin

125,"The Chronicles and Legends trilogies, along with Summer Flame, are the core stories.

All that is from memory so if may be a little off. 

After that you can go forward into the Fifth Age or backwards to learn about the history of Ansalon, including how the Heroes met (Meetings) and their journeys during the 5 year gap before they all met back in Solace at the beginning of Chronicles (Preludes). There's a ton of short stories that take place during the War of the Lance (Tales) but you can also learn more about whatever races you're interested in (Elves, Dwarves, Kinder, Minotaurs) or older historical figures like Lord Soth or Huma and even the gods. Nothing is really required reading after the main books but you can get as deep as you want. Reading Chronicles and then the books that Weis and Hickman came back to write and fill in the gaps (Dwarven Depths, Highlord Skies, Hourglass Mage) should catch you up and help you decide if you wanna read any further.

A weekend doing Ibogaine sounds scary to some people, a lifetime of struggling with addiction sounds scary to others; I guess it's just a matter of perspective. There's no hallucinations, it more like therapeutically going to battle with the root of your addiction and overcoming it. A lot of facing the music for all your bad decisions and reliving your past regrets. A lot of tears. They start off sad but they're happy tears by the end. Some people will go their entire lives taking different drugs to numb themselves and supress all of that rather than face their demons. That's scary.

I suppose if your job is at stake and the people who are telling you what's best for you are the same people who can complicate your life even further, maybe you should do what they say? I don't know man, I will never condone using Suboxone and I will tell you this: you can either rough it out and see how well this bout of sobriety works out for you or you can conform and get on Suboxone but I promise you that however difficult you think staying clean is right now, it will be literally a thousand times harder when you inevitably come off of Suboxone. Not only that but while on Suboxone you will completely lose your libido and possibly your will to live (depending on how intertwined those two are) and I can honestly say that for me, after 15 years of abusing any and all sorts of drugs, the years I was on Suboxone were the worst years of my life. I don't know how you feel about Methadone but it's more similar to Suboxone than people (doctors included) will admit. I was a zombie on Suboxone and ended up hating the way I felt when I was on it. That misery was only surpassed by how I felt when I didn't take it. You know how it goes. Completely trapped.

If you're forced onto taking a highly addictive substance against your better judgement, you're gonna wanna take as small a dose as possible. Like cutting an 8mg strip into 32 pieces and taking .25 mg. Seriously, the tiniest bit of Bupe is effective and no one needs 8, 16, or 24 mgs a day. Personally, in your situation, I'd spend a couple days at an Ibogaine clinic before letting myself become addicted all over again but I guess that's not an option for everyone.

183,"Here's the [first post on the All Star Batman #1 Turner variant on CBSI](http://comicbookinvest.com/2016/07/26/double-feature-suicide-squad-1-star-batman-1/) a full 2.5 months before it was released. From there, we went to the Aspen store and waited for the pre-order. Some of these exclusives have a very small print run and sell out in a matter of minutes. I just got a Black #1, from Black Mask, Comics Heating Up variant and only 250 were printed, it sold out in less than 48 hours. The Turner variant for Batman #1 sold out in like an hour. 


Again, these exclusives have a set print run. A typical set is 

*•3000 color variants*

*•1500 B&amp;W variants*

*•500 Secret variants (these can only be ordered in sets along with the other 2)*


This is totally different than retailer exclusives (1:25, 1:100, 1:1000). These are sold to retailers to help them make up costs from ordering the abundance of comics they need to to qualify. For example: a retailer needs to order 100 regular covers to get 1 of a 1:100 variant. So if he orders 500 copies of the regular cover (500 X $2 = $1000), he'll get 5 1:100s and he might sell them for $100 apiece to help absorb the cost of all those regular copies (5 X $100 = $500). Now he's only got $500 into the 1,000 regular covers so it's a little better if he gets stuck with a ton of them. There is no limited print run to these. If retailers order 100,000 regular covers, they will print one-thousand 1:100s, two-thousand 1:50s, four-thousand 1:25s and ten-thousand 1:10s.  Does that make sense?

There is no way to know how many retailer incentive variants will be printed but with store/artist exclusives, it's become common to tell buyers exactly how many will be printed.

185,"Comic book speculators know about all releases in advance, that's our job. Comics are shown to the public months ahead of time so vendors can order and Diamond knows how many to print. Individual artists like J. Scott Campbell and John Tyler Christopher do a lot of exclusives on their websites, as do retail stores and online vendors like Aspen (Michael Turner) and The Comic Mint and Frankie's Comics.  Unfortunately, there's not just one site that compiles all of this information; you really need to have your ear to the street to know the what and when of spec-worthy comics. 

Here's a few sites to get you started:

www.comicsheatingup.net

www.investcomics.com

Google+ groups like Comic Book Speculation and Investing (CBSI) is an invaluable forum and its members usually know about and post information on something the day that it is announced. Be warned that keeping up with everything is a full time job and if it wasn't, everyone would be doing it. 

There is a big difference between retailer incentive comics - which have no limit on how many will be printed and depend on how many regular covers are ordered - and exclusive that have a stated print run.

211,"Not a whole lot to it, a friend of mine's cousin was real tight with him in Miami. He'd been trying to get me to make the 3 hour drive down there to party for awhile, I finally gave in. We met up with Rodman and his cousin and the after-party of some little event that had just ended. There were a few other minor celebrities and Rodman had a little squad with him that was just hanging out, trying to look important.


We made plans to meet at a nearby stripclub and that's where my disdain of celebrity worship was solidified. I won't say he was a tool because the bar was probably set too high, him being famous and all, and he just turned out to be a normal everyday weirdo but after we started getting drunk I asked him if he did bumps (cocaine) and he replied that they don't do bumps, they do piles. Which came out exactly like you see in the clip: 


""Nahmanwedopals."" Pals? 

""Yeahmanwedopies."" Pies?

""Piseman, pise"". Ooooooh... piles! You do piles of cocaine. 


Okay. Any other interaction went about the same: anything you spoke about he had already done and done bigger and better than you did it or ever will do it and his posse just nodded along in agreement, encouraging everything he said. It was the least stimulating conversation I've ever been a part of and I felt dumber for having been there.

Then my friend made a comment to one of the girls that were hanging around just outside of our circle just to say that they were close to Dennis Rodman and I guess he didn't like it because he had my friend kicked out. They said I could stay, as if that privilege were even in the realm of possibility.


We were pretty fucked up when we left but we made it to another strip club with about an hour to spare before they closed. Unfortunately we never made it to the door because we were laughing so hard in the car. I even literally fell out of the driver's seat once and was ROFLing in the dirt parking lot. My friend was from Jersey and to this day he's the funniest guy I've ever known personally. By the time we were able to compose ourselves the club was closed and we were left wondering a) how in the hell we just sat in my car and laughed until the sun came up without realizing it and b) what the hell we were even laughing about in the first place.

216,"If you've got a kitchen in your condo and you like seafood, I highly recommend saving some money and shopping at Sexton's Seafood. I worked there for almost 20 years and whatever you buy will literally be the freshest seafood you've ever eaten. Even if you don't buy anything, stop in and check it out. People come from all over the country to fill up their coolers and take seafood back with them. Everything is local and unloaded daily and we cut everything fresh every day right in front of you. It's truly a spectacle. Tell em Odom sent you and to give you a local discount.

If you want to eat out, there's a great restaurant called Callahan's that you could eat the lunch specials at every day and be blown away every time. Zoë's Kitchen is also a great lunch spot, the chicken roll-ups are to die for.

Harbor Docks has great sushi and Thai food for lunch (Thai fried noodles... omg) but their seafood and dinner menu is a bit overpriced. It's a Destin staple and that's really what you're paying for, though everything is very fresh and you can watch the boats unloading from the deck.

 If you like oysters, head to the little dive called The Boathouse and try the Action Oysters or Oysters Rockafeller. Even if you don't like oysters, like me, you'll love those 2 dishes. Ask if Rich is working and mention my name to him, he'll hook you up.

Casual Mexican - Pepito's. Nice Mexican food on the Harbor - Crab Island Cantina.

For wings, Island Wing Company has a million flavors and decent wings. If you wanted the biggest and best wings you've ever had in your life you'd have to shoot over to Buffalo's Reef in Ft. Walton Beach, about a 15-20 minute drive.

McGuire's is THE place to go for a steak and is directly across from Emerald Grande. It's an Irish steakhouse and is a little pricey but it's totally worth it. 

There's a thousand seafood restaurants and about 95% of them suck but if you don't mind paying a little more and getting what you pay for, try Dewey's on the Harbor, Marina Cafe, and Louisiana Lagniappe. Those are the 3 best restaurants in town - the latter two are fine dining - and everything they serve was caught in Destin. Boshamps is decent if you wanna save a little money but still wanna eat fresh local seafood.

Jim &amp; Nick's is the best barbecue in town, hands down.

The Donut Hole is the best spot for baked goods or breakfast, the The Waffle House is a contender (seriously). Another good breakfast spot, though this is where you go when you wanna impress, is Another Broken Egg Cafe.

Osaka for Hibachi. So good.

If you want a great burger, go to TOPS. It's a drive thru but it's locally owned and you can't beat it for a quick inexpensive meal. Surfside Subs is right next door, killer subs.

Yogurt Mountain is a must for desert. Also Shakes for frozen custard. And, as I mentioned before, Popcorn Jungle. They have hundreds of different kinds of popcorn from sweet to savory to chocolate covered and everything in between. Try the Chicago. Also vintage and rare sodas that you'll probably never see anywhere else.

La Famiglia is the go-to for Italian.

Merlin's is the best place for delivery pizza. Jordano's is the next best thing but they only deliver to the easternmost part of Destin, the side opposite the Harbor. Mellow Mushroom doesn't deliver but is amazing, though they have them all over Florida.

If you just want a quick sandwich but don't wanna go to Subway, check out Lenny's Subs. The chicken cheesesteak is life changing.

These are all locally owned restaurants that have been around for years and are the best at what they do. You can always hit up Bonefish or Ruth's Chris or Olive Garden but you can hit them up all over the country at any time. If you want some Destin-only flavor, these are the spots. Avoid touristy places like The Back Porch and AJ's. The view might be great but the food sucks and is NOT locally caught.

These places are also right in the heart of Destin so if you venture outside of it, your options will increase. If you head east out of Destin towards Rosemary or Blue Mountain Beach and Seaside (where The Truman Show was filmed), make sure to eat at Red Bar. Their menu is only 5 items and it changes every day but it's probably one of the best places to eat in Florida. ",2016-10-18 04:50:40+00:00,d8wtzy2,7.0,t1_d8wrmm9,4258.0,Destin

225,"That's a decent budget, you could pretty much have your pick during the off season. If staying directly on the beach is not a must (Jetty East/Holiday Isle) I would recommend just staying at the [Emerald Grande](http://www.emeraldgrande.com/harborwalk-village). You'd have to take a 3 minute drive to get to the beach but if you stay on the harbor, everything else you could possibly want to do is within walking distance from the EG. Shopping, dining, nightlife, kids activities - it's all right downstairs. Their rooms are spacious and super nice, plus its loaded with amenities - gym, pools, spa, Commanders Palace, Starbucks, room service, Popcorn Jungle (my personal favorite). You can walk to Coyote Ugly, AJs, Harry Ts, Crab Island Cantina, and about 20 other restaurants and bars. There's zip lining and rock climbing, hamster balls, etc. for the kids. Take a pontoon boat out, sunset cruise or glass bottom boat and see the dolphins. Or take a charter out and go catch enough fish to freeze and eat for a year. You can stroll along the harbor and watch the boats unload (tourists love that shit for some reason). You'd literally never have to get in a car if you didn't want to.

That's your 2 options: the harbor or the beach. If you'd rather stay on the beach let me know and I'll recommend something else but if you're okay with the harbor, you can't beat the Emerald Grande.",2016-10-17 22:18:45+00:00,d8wdg18,3.0,t1_d8wbxzx,1982.0,Destin

Even worse, I can't recall ever telling him that I loved him and appreciated him; our family just wasn't emotionally open like that. He left my mom and my sister and I when I was 13 and I never got to forgive him and tell them that I understood, that sometimes people just grow apart and I get it. I know he died feeling guilty for that decision all those years ago but he didn't have to, I should've told him sooner.

A friend of mine lost her dad after a 2 year battle with something or another. Towards the end he had become pretty angry at the whole situation and apparently lashed out at her often. His last few years were spent in and out of hospitals having tests ran and looking for a cure or whatever but at least she got to spend those last couple years with him, even though he was not the same kind man as before.

Now she has PTSD. She has insisted that his death has pretty much ruined her life. This is all on display on Facebook, she never misses an opportunity to bring up the fact that he died and she's in such bad shape because of it.

I try to tell her that she's actually lucky that she got to say goodbye and get some closure and that's a small consolation that she could take away from this whole thing but she's holding fast that I'm the lucky one because I didn't have to deal with the grief and watch him get worse and eventually pass. Well it's been almost 8 years and I can say that I would give anything to have been there and watch his health steadily decline just so I could tell him all the things I never got to say. I'm convinced that after enough time has passed, a majority of people looking back would rather deal with being sad in exchange for closure.

It's an interesting scenario either way, just wondering what other people thought about it.

817,"• PS4

• GK EE

• 10pm EST - Sept. 2

• PSN - bigshrimpn83

• Have a mic, know the steps, don't suck

I've done all 6 steps multiple times and died on the boss fight twice, both times when Nikolai was smoking and on the verge of being beaten. I know how to do everything and I can get all steps trophies done really early from all the practice I've had. The problem is that everyone I play with goes down on the steps. They go down when trying to run around and hit the bombs. They go down trying to protect the mangler, or they accidentally kill it. They have only shotguns when it's time to do the module step. They have unupgraded guns on the Groph step. It's ridiculous man. And I've gone through about 20 Undead Man Walkings trying to make it easier for them.

I NEED someone who is confident that they can complete this EE and/or has done it already, multiple times would be even better. I've seriously attempted this EE like 40 times and I have a 1 year old so every time I waste 2 hours that I could've been catching up on sleep it's infuriating. I'm begging someone from the sub to help me get this gateworm. 2 people? Even better. 3 or 4, it doesn't matter as long as you can just fucking stay alive. I know everyone slips up here and there once in a while but this is getting absurd. We just took our time and got everything ready and a dude throws a monkey, hits his bomb at tank factory, and then goes down. How? Monkeys, dragon strikes, shields, Mk 3, Gauntlet, PaPed guns with AATs... how do you go down on round 18 with this arsenal??

I'm always the last one alive and I just can't carry everyone through these steps and the more players there are the more zombies there are and the harder it is, which isn't that hard as long as you can hold your own. The bomb step seems to be 50X easier on solo, that's nuts! That does not make sense!

I'm Master Prestige level 175, I have 10 UMWs, Perkaholics that I don't even use, multiples of all the GGs, I can do this EE first try if someone who can pull their own weight please help me tonight (Friday) around 10pm. I'll also post in the party-up thread tomorrow just in case but dude, if you're one of those awesome people that just jumps on and helps random people do EEs, I could really use your help.

873,"Having something to do can not be understated. Personally, my favorite thing to do is a concert or, even better, a music festival, which combines the two things you seemed to enjoy the most: listening to music and dancing. Plus having a bunch of other people around that are also tripping doesn't hurt. Last time I took 300mcg and went to a club with 3 different DJs in 3 different sections. Dubstep, drum &amp; bass, trance... I think those were the different styles but I'm not really sure the differences in EDM, I just know there was a very distinct difference in all 3 and each was amazing for its own reasons. This was in New Orleans after a Tool show so people were passing around joints like it was nothing and I was gone but I had an amazing time until we left at like 7am. I can usually take a hit and be pretty sociable but at this dose I had no desire to communicate and only wanted to trip out on the music and the visuals I was getting. But yeah, have a plan next time. Even if you don't stick to it, at least you won't be bored. That's gotta be the worst feeling when you're tripping.",2016-08-22 20:23:31+00:00,d6sbjwh,1.0,t3_4z192o,15342.0,1P_LSD

905,"Courtesy of u/GeekAesthete , whose post was gilded 24 times. Is Glenn Beck seriously not gonna give credit??

&gt;Imagine that you're sitting down to dinner with your family, and while everyone else gets a serving of the meal, you don't get any. So you say ""I should get my fair share."" And as a direct response to this, your dad corrects you, saying, ""everyone should get their fair share."" Now, that's a wonderful sentiment -- indeed, everyone should, and that was kinda your point in the first place: that you should be a part of everyone, and you should get your fair share also. However, dad's smart-ass comment just dismissed you and didn't solve the problem that you still haven't gotten any!

The problem is that the statement ""I should get my fair share"" had an implicit ""too"" at the end: ""I should get my fair share, too, just like everyone else."" But your dad's response treated your statement as though you meant ""only I should get my fair share"", which clearly was not your intention. As a result, his statement that ""everyone should get their fair share,"" while true, only served to ignore the problem you were trying to point out.

That's the situation of the ""black lives matter"" movement. Culture, laws, the arts, religion, and everyone else repeatedly suggest that all lives should matter. Clearly, that message already abounds in our society.

The problem is that, in practice, the world doesn't work the way. You see the film Nightcrawler? You know the part where Renee Russo tells Jake Gyllenhal that she doesn't want footage of a black or latino person dying, she wants news stories about affluent white people being killed? That's not made up out of whole cloth -- there is a news bias toward stories that the majority of the audience (who are white) can identify with. So when a young black man gets killed (prior to the recent police shootings), it's generally not considered ""news"", while a middle-aged white woman being killed is treated as news. And to a large degree, that is accurate -- young black men are killed in significantly disproportionate numbers, which is why we don't treat it as anything new. But the result is that, societally, we don't pay as much attention to certain people's deaths as we do to others. So, currently, we don't treat all lives as though they matter equally.

Just like asking dad for your fair share, the phrase ""black lives matter"" also has an implicit ""too"" at the end: it's saying that black lives should also matter. But responding to this by saying ""all lives matter"" is willfully going back to ignoring the problem. It's a way of dismissing the statement by falsely suggesting that it means ""only black lives matter,"" when that is obviously not the case. And so saying ""all lives matter"" as a direct response to ""black lives matter"" is essentially saying that we should just go back to ignoring the problem.

TL;DR: The phrase ""Black lives matter"" carries an implicit ""too"" at the end; it's saying that black lives should also matter. Saying ""all lives matter"" is dismissing the very problems that the phrase is trying to draw attention to.",2016-08-16 22:45:25+00:00,d6kd11x,1.0,t3_4y1mr8,8616.0,politics

Either way, I do commend you for admitting your mistake and not deleting the post. Pretty fitting that Trump just admitted today that he was mistaken in claiming that he had watched some top secret Iran video when even his own party was telling him it didn't exist.

1033,"For me, a Salvia trip has more in common with a DMT trip than an acid or mushroom trip. It hits you instantly, unlike the gradual onset of L or Psy. You have no notion that you're on a drug because their is no you. It's instant ego loss and transportation to another dimension where you're receiving some ancient wisdom that's impossible to comprehend once you return. Crazy geometrical patterns and alien looking shapes and something intelligent just beyond your ability to see it. I don't know, man, it's pretty hard to describe; I'm really not one of those types like on Erowid that can write an entire story with a plot about their experiences. It's not like that for me, it's very disjointed and I feel like I forget most of the shit I experience, like how you know you just had an insane dream but you can't remember what it was about.

I should add that this is smoking DMT I'm talking about, which the dude above me referred to when he specified a trip that's ""counted in minutes"". DMT can also be ingested and when I went to Peru and did Ayahuasca, I was quite struck to how similiar it was to a mushroom trip, with a few very noticeable differences.",2016-08-01 01:57:54+00:00,d5z233l,7.0,t1_d5z17a9,1423.0,AskReddit

1079,"Actually, your first statement is incorrect. Your second is a strawman: I never compared the odds of the side effects to the odds of catching the disease. I'm only saying that I'd rather risk getting mumps than risk those side effects. 

You seem to like analogies. Let's say there's a lottery for 1 billion dollars. I'd rather buy one $1 ticket and have less odds of actually winning than buying a million $1 tickets. Yes, my odds are increased if I buy a million tickets but if I don't win I'm fucked.

Especially when the end result is the same: as long as I play (whether I get the vaccine or get mumps) I get the consolation prize (immunity to mumps). 

There's no advantage of taking that large of a risk when a) you might not even get mumps b) the effects of mumps are not serious, and c) you're guaranteed a life long immunity even if you do get it, something that the vaccine does not 100% guarantee.

Anyway, check out what you've got on the eBay sold listings. One other thing I'll mention is that the grading process can get expensive if you're only sending one or two or a few books in; the way it makes more sense financially is to save up a bunch of books and send them all in at once so the shipping doesn't break you. Plus it can take 4-6 months to get them back. Also if you sign up for the $150 tier with CGC, they give you $150 grading credit, so you can basically get 7 books graded (it's $18 apiece for modern books, the credit doesn't count towards the shipping and insurance). Sometimes you can find a 9.8 on eBay for around $30 and it'd be better to grab it that way since you're guaranteed a 9.8 for about the same price.

Overall it's a pretty complicated process, you have to really know how to grade and what will be worth sending in for it to make sense. It's definitely not just easy money or everyone would be doing it. An easier alternative is to so to a convention that CGC will be attending and just drop them off there, you'll also save on shipping that way and yoi dont need to pay for an annual membership. But I'd wait until you get a good idea of how to grade and maybe until you've accumulate a good amount of books to send in. Then you have to value each one going by current prices (this is where knowing how to grade them is really helpful) for insurance purposes. I waited a couple years before I started sending books in. But you'll get the hang of it quick so if you can afford it, take a few books that are in really good shape and send em in, see what happens! You can always learn as you go! The only thing is I've seen plenty of 9.8s go on auction for around $10 because there's just not that 
much interest in them. I'd hate for you to spend $30 and wait months for a book to come back and get a perfect 9.8 grade and then lose $20 on it.",2016-07-29 15:40:27+00:00,d5vzv1v,,t1_d5vlufs,31317.0,comicbookcollecting

If so, you can get a good idea of the different values of different grades on comicpriceguide.com but the best place is eBay sold listings. I only get keys graded or comics that are highly sought after because you can get a random comic graded but if there's not much interest in it, you're just gonna be sitting on it. If you have a particular issue(s) in mind I'll be happy to let you know what I think. A good rule of thumb is that a 9.8 (usually the best grade you can get) will triple the value of a comic. If that's a triple from $100 to $300 that's obviously worth it but if you're tripling from $10 to $30, it's not worth the $30 to get it graded, especially if it's not gonna come back a 9.8. If you've got a small crease or corner bend or a ding that'll knock it down to a 9.6 but you'll still typically double your money. More than one small flaw and then you're getting down into 9.4, 9.2, 9.0, 8.5 territory where only really valuable comics will be valuable in those grades. Any modern comic should be pretty much flawless to qualify for grading unless, again, it's a really valuable key like ASM #300 or Batman Adventures #12.

But my suggestion is to search eBay sold listings for whatever you have and see if it's worth the $30 to get it graded. As for the condition, if you don't know how to grade, check out Overstreet to get an idea or even post a scan or HD pic here and must of us can help you out.",2016-07-29 05:38:51+00:00,d5vjwrh,,t1_d5vfm21,7923.0,comicbookcollecting

1105,"Comics fluctuate in value from week to week, it's nearly impossible for a comic shop to keep up. Every time I pop into my LCS I find a little surprise nugget, this week was the Civil War: Kingpin - Black Panther variant for $10. It's going for $20-25 on the Bay. A few weeks ago I found the 1:25 variant for Justice League #40, the first appearance of Grail, for $10. It's going for between $50-100 so I paid $30 and sent it off to get graded which should increase the current value to between $150-200 as long as it comes back a 9.8, which it should. Not bad for a $40 investment. 

Digging through longboxes of back issues is tedious but you'll likely find some issues that have recently increased in value due to being optioned for movies and shows or because of recent events in the comics.

1132,"Oops! Yes, he'll be 1 on the 31st. He's been taking steps for a couple months, as well as making sounds that he associates with objects (calling his duck ""di"") - and if he's in the bath and you say ""whale"" or ""boat"", he'll look directly at the toy you mention but he won't attempt those words yet like he does with his duck. He'll also say ""MA MA MA MA MA"" when he's fussing but he's said that since he was a couple months old and I don't think he associates it with mommy so I don't count it as his first word. ""Di"" for duck is as close as we've come to that.

With his walking I mean he takes steps while I'm holding him up by the hands or armpits, and now he'll walk beside me so long as I'm holding one of his hands for him to balance with, even though he doesn't really use it. For the last couple weeks I've been standing him up in front of me and letting him take the 3-4 wobbly steps towards me. He's gotten better at it, though he'll still fall pretty often. He'll also stand up just fine when I place him down, sometimes for 10-20 seconds, so I know he can but other times he'll drop straight to his knees and start crawling. He can get around so fast by crawling, maybe it's a convenience thing. He's been crawling since like 4 months and I let him crawl up the stairs shortly after, with me behind him in case he falls, of course. He's really good at stairs and has just learned how to turn around at the top of them and lower himself back down to the next stair so that he can go all the way down the flight of stairs on his belly.

1337,"Okay. I give up.
Vaccines do not cause autism.

Autism is a behavioral diagnosis. In order to receive the diagnosis of “Autism” a child must exhibit a certain number of behaviors over a certain time frame. If he or she does not do so, the diagnosis of “autism” is not warranted.

There is no blood test for “autism.”

“Autism” can’t be confirmed or “ruled-out” by laboratory analysis. It’s strictly a behavioral diagnosis.

Therefore, anything that causes physiological damage cannot directly “cause” autism.

Ergo… vaccines cannot “cause” “autism.”

Vaccines cause other stuff.

Vaccines cause encephalitis.
Vaccines cause seizures.
Vaccines cause immune system deficiencies.
Vaccines cause gastrointestinal problems.

Encephalitis causes mood swings.
Encephalitis causes extreme pain.
Encephalitis causes inattention and impulsivity.
Encephalitis causes aggression.
Encephalitis causes balance problems and difficulty relating to one’s environment.

Seizures cause mood swings.
Seizures cause inattention and impulsivity.
Seizures cause alterations in conciousness.

Immune system deficiencies cause children to have more frequent bacterial infections, such as ear infections, upper respiratory infections (URIs), sinusutis, and strep infections.

Immune system deficiencies cause children to have more frequent viral infections, such as stomatitis, “fevers of unknown origin,” “viral rashes,” hives, conjunctivitis, and gastrointestinal viruses that cause vomiting and diarrhea.

Immune system deficiencies cause children to be more vulnerable to “everything that’s going around” and to have a tougher time getting over things than their peers.

Gastrointestinal damage from vaccines causes diarrhea.
Gastrointestinal damage from vaccines causes nausea, reflux, vomiting, and the recently discovered “disease” now known as GERD (Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease).

Gatrointestinal damage from vaccines causes increased vulnerability to viruses and bacteria, which leads to increased administration of antibiotics, which leads to overgrowth of pathogenic yeast.

Pathogenic yeast overgrowth leads to intestinal hyperpermeability (“leaky gut syndrome”).

Pathogenic yeast overgrowth leads to constipation.
Pathogenic yeast overgrowth leads to food allergies.
Pathogenic yeast overgrowth leads to skin eruptions, “drunken, silly behavior,” inattention and impulsivity, and cravings for bread, sugar, ice cream, milk, and carbohydrates.

Technically, vaccines do not cause autism because techincally there is no such thing as autism.

Vaccines cause the underlying physical conditions that result in the pain, neurological damage, immune system disorders, gastrointestinal damage, and yeast overgrowth – all of which combine to produce the behavioral symptoms that result in the “autism” diagnosis.

Gastrointestinal damage is the most obvious result of vaccine damage.

When a previously healthy child suddenly starts having multiple episodes of watery and extremely stinky diarrhea every day, and this happens shortly after receiving vaccinations, it is notable as a “vaccine injury.” What is not so obvious is that when the child’s gut is permanently damaged, he or she is no longer able to absorb nutrients necessary to produce neurotransmitters necessary for proper brain function. So when the child develops mood swings, sleep difficulties, and learning disabilities several months later, these issues are not recognized as being related to the vaccine injury because the initial damage occurred many months earlier.

I don't know what else to tell you, man. These are all side effects of vaccines; they can all be found on the inserts that most doctors won't give you or on the CDC website. If you can't see the correlation, again, I don't know what to tell you.

It's pretty amazing to see an entire social media site this willingly oblivious and resolute in their decision to not even look at anything that could be damaging to the vaccine movement that's got 271 new vaccines in the pipeline.

People go on and on about how you can't change an anti-vaxxers minds but it's actually the pro-vaccine people that are stuck in a bubble, this whole thread is a perfect example of that. OP posted two undeniable, undebateable facts - you can literally look them up right now - and you called him Mr. Tinfoil Hat. Are you fucking serious? Do you even know what tin foil implies? 

I am not an anti-vaxxer and my ten month old is fully vaccinated. However, he's coming up on 12 months and is due for the MMR vaccine and I did a lot of research before making the biggest decision I've ever had to make because I'm not gonna put the safety of my first child in the hands of the reddit hivemind. I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I don't believe in chem trails, I'm not religious at all, I'm a Bernie supporter, I support GMOs, I'm not a fucking idiot. I want my son to have the measles vaccine, I want him to have the mumps vaccine and I'm not opposed to the rubella vaccine, it's the untested version of mixing all 3 that is the problem. That's where it all started and that's all Dr. Wakefield did was say that he could not support the combination vaccine because it hadn't been tested. Merck took the single vaccines off the market because they had so much money invested in the MMR vaccine and so now I don't have the option of vaccinating my son for measles or mumps because they only sell the MMR vaccine, [they've sold 40 million doses to the US government over the last 10 years and they're currently involved in a lawsuit from two former employees WHO ARE GODDAMN SCIENTISTS for defrauding the government](https://healthimpactnews.com/2014/judge-lawsuit-against-mercks-mmr-vaccine-fraud-to-continue/). This is public record, not some conspiracy theory. People are so quick to label anyone who questions the motives of a pharmaceutical company as someone who ""doesn't believe in science"" but what the fuck, here are two scientists that worked for Merck saying that they defrauded the government. Are these scientists anti-science? More likely, the people don't hear about these things because they don't have a child that's about to get the MMR vaccine so they've never done the research, they just assume that because so many people agree that every vaccine is 100% safe and should be administered no questions asked, they must be right.

It amazes me that a majority of reddit doesn't trust the government or Big Pharma, thinks politicians are corrupt, and knows the media is lying to them but no one is allowed to even question the safety and efficacy of vaccines. Think for yourself, question authority.... except when it comes to vaccines. Seriously?

You want a source? Like providing a source somehow lends credibility to your statement? You post a Wikipedia link about Andrew Wakefield and you think you've made some kind of point? Okay, here's a video that wasn't made by Rupert Murdoch. Not that you'll watch it but it's a source nonetheless, [straight from the horses mouth](https://youtu.be/mT0VzAvfnb4). I met this guy less than a week ago, he's not some fucking lunatic with an evil agenda.

It's quite unbelievable how uninformed people are yet they're so quick to hurl insults at anyone who wants to do some research and not just take the media's word for something that's so important. But whatever, this entire post is a waste of time because you're rolling on the floor laughing that someone posted a couple facts that are in direct opposition of what you've heard. You're so desperate to be part of the majority but to anyone who knows anything about this subject, you just look foolish. Just keep on ROFLing and when the time comes for you to have to risk your child's health, maybe you'll do a little more research and not just parrot the things you've heard in an attempt to sound like you know what you're talking about.

1503,"When I was 13 I started working in a seafood market in my little harborside town. There was a cute girl that worked there and I started flirting with her. Her dad, who also worked there, didn't like that. He would do little things to torture me and make my job ridiculously difficult but I persevered and not only stayed on at that job longer than he did, but I also ended up losing my virginity to his daughter, who was also a virgin. We dated for like a year so it was all good.

Anyway I'll never forget something he told me long before it had gotten to the point of banging his daughter. There was some bait that had been left out of the cooler room over night and when we came in the next morning it was rank and stunk up the entire building. We finally found the source and he told me to stick my nose in there and get a good whif. I did and it was potent. The stuff of nightmares. He looks me straight in the eye and says ""if you ever get a girl naked and her pussy smells like that, eat that motherfucker up. Just bury your face in there cuz that's the best pussy you're ever gonna find.""

I believed him for the longest time. And though his daughter's pussy smelled nothing like rotten fish, I longed for the day that I stumbled across this holy grail of vaginas. After breaking it off with his daughter, I set out of a fucking spree, mostly because I was in love with the act of sex, all the while measuring each vagina I came across to the memory of that smell. It didn't take long. I think the 4th girl I fucked smelled so bad that the stench would fill up the room and linger. I hate to disappoint anyone reading this but once it finally happened and I had that chick laying there with her legs spread, the nauseating odor overwhelming, I realized then that he had been fucking with me. Because he hated me. Then it all made sense. I still hit it and I may have ran directly to the shower afterwards, eyes watering and throat closing up along the way, but I'm proud to say that I did not eat that girl out. Fuck you David.

I think a little sex education may have prevented me from seeking out rotten pussy.",2016-05-30 15:13:24+00:00,d3p7fjz,1.0,t3_4lnhpc,45800.0,AskReddit

1565,"So, you as the player, wanted to just leave before finding the treasure and end the game like that? I know that I, as the player, was like ""fuck that, I've got like 10 years invested in everything that has led up to this, I want the treasure!"" So it's unfair to say that the player's interests don't align with Nate's, here's why:

The overarching theme of the entire game is Nate's inability to leave his old life in the past. He's having trouble adjusting to normal life and misses his treasure hunting days. So early on we're shown that saving Sam is Nathan's  top priority (Nate is willing to forfeit the treasure once he knows that Sam's life is not at risk [aka choosing the normal home life over the treasure hunting life] and he's willing to lie to his wife and risk everything to save Sam [aka choosing the treasure hunting life over the normal family life], the priority is always Sam). This is followed close behind by what we'll call a tie between his new normal family life and his exciting treasure hunting life. Now, whichever one of these aligns with his top priority of saving Sam, that's where Nate's interests lie. If going home with the team to his normal life AND saving Sam is an option (which it is because we now see that there is no threat from the drug lord and it's likely that leaving Sam to fend for himself on the island is the opposite of saving him), that's the one he'll take, as we see with Nate deciding to forsake the treasure and leave on Sully's plane with Sam in tow. But when Sam gets separated and decides to go back for the treasure, we now have his exciting treasure hunting life aligned with saving Sam, so that's where his interests lie. Though it's never spoken outright, it could be that secretly Nate wants to continue to find the treasure even though he concedes and agrees to go home (leaving us right where we started, unable to adjust to home life) and that Sam going back is exactly what Nate wanted. What we do know for sure, however, is that this inner struggle of which life he should lead is only solved when his wife buys the business and he is able to combine his normal family job life with treasure hunting, so it's not as if he ever ended up chooosing one over the other. Choosing to go home without the treasure would've been a complete waste of the player's time, as there would be no progression of Nate's character arc and no final resolution with Nate getting his treasure hunting business/happy ever after.

Saving Sam was always the priority and because Sam's life was at risk upon being seperated, we as the player and Nathan's interests are aligned in going back for the treasure, the only way to save Sam (and possibly the only way for Nate to find peace). Saving Sam and finding the treasure are intertwined and as such, take priority over going home. 

TL;DR - Just because Sam lied doesn't mean we (the players and Nathan) no longer want to save him. Nate doesn't continue after him based on whether or not he's the source of conflict, Nate does so because Sam is his brother. We, as the players want a happy ending for Nate above all else, he go back for Sam for this reason.",2016-05-22 19:24:57+00:00,d3fhchb,1.0,t3_4kiti1,16820.0,Uncharted4

But if one person mentions that a particular vaccine like MMR may not be as safe as Merck is claiming, dozens of people who know very little about the subject come out of the woodwork with chants of ""vaccines save lives"" like that's an absolute rebuttal that can never be disputed. So Big Pharma is evil, doctors and politicians are paid off by corporate sponsors, and the media is lying to you... those are all a given here on reddit. But Merck, the only maker of the MMR vaccine who is under investigation for falsifying data, whose employees have been convicted of insider trading, and whom is being sued by 2 former employee whistle-blowers for defrauding the U.S. government by causing it to purchase four million doses of mislabeled and misbranded MMR vaccine per year for a decade... those guys are angels who only have our best interest at heart and definitely don't care about profit.

Arthur Dayne is only the most legendary fighter is Westeros and was Kingsguard to the Mad King Aerys and also best friends with the Mad King's son, Rhaegar. He wields the legendary sword Dawn and thus retains the title ""Sword of the Morning"", which only a Dayne who is considered worthy can possess. He's kinda like the Thor of Westeros, but with a sword instead of a hammer. The sword is said to have been created from metal from a fallen star and has been passed down in house Dayne for thousands of years. Arthur was most famous for killing The Smiling Knight of the Kingswood Brotherhood and also for knighting Jaime Lannister. He is rumored to have helped kidnap Lyanna Stark (though whether she was kindnapped or went along willingly, being in love with Rhaegar, is heavily disputed), leading to his death at the Tower of Joy at the hands of Ned Stark and Howland Reed. No one knows the exact circumstances of the battle, as Ned is very secretive about it and we haven't even seen Howland Reed in the books.

If you like the show, I highly recommend the books.

You shouldn’t have to do a virtual Kessel Run in under 12 parsecs just to get your copy, know what I mean? 

&gt;This time around, there’ll be no need to merge orders and wait for shipping refunds!

1927,"So I want to thank everyone that offered advice, it was truly helpful. What ended up happening was I saw that one of the sellers on eBay happened to be located in Jacksonville, where I live. I asked him if he had a physical store that I could visit and possibly save money on shipping. He answered that he did indeed and it was located about 2 miles from where I lived. He said he was closed on the weekend but he happened to be going by there yesterday and he'd pick me up whatever I needed and meet me somewhere close by since it'd be near impossible for me to make it there on a weekday because I'm a stay at home dad with an 8 month old. I told him I was looking for Standard size Mylites2 (725M2) and full-backs (700FB) and he told me he could do $11 a pack (of 50) for each so I got 100 bags and boards, totalling $44. This was $19 cheaper that the lowest price I could find online and they were basically delivered same day to my doorstep, what are the odds??

As for the bags themselves, I think I may try Current next time as the Silver Age and Prestige format books [fit snugly](https://imgur.com/SqyGzFs) in the Standards but all my newer books have a [pretty big gap in them](https://imgur.com/DjQeULQ). I did read that Current only fits books from the last 15 years but that's about half my collection and majority of the more valuable issues. The good thing is they don't really slide around in the Mylar bags but I'd still prefer a slightly tighter fit. 

Thanks again for helping out.

100 M2 w/ half-backs - $46


50 M2 w/ full-backs - $43

1967,"Man, I have history with that Batman #227. So I got in touch with a guy that was selling some comics on Craigslist. We texted back and forth a few times and I ended up going over to his house to buy some Batman comics. He said he had bought this entire collection from this old man and every issue was graded (by the original owner) and had the issue number, artist/writer, and date of release hand written on the back. This guy didn't care for Batman comics so he sold me every issue he had from #250-400 for $1 apiece. Most were labeled M/NM but there also a lot of NMs and a few VF/NM. It was almost 100 issues altogether and he ended up throwing about 40 Detective Comics ranging from #400 to #600 for an even $100. There was the 1st appearance of Black Mask in M/NM condition, the entire NM run of Hush, and pretty much all the other keys, plus quite a few M/NM issues in the 200s.

Then we got around to what I had come there for, Batman #227. It looked flawless!! I had been searching for that issue for so long and here it was, in my hands, in near perfect condition. He said he didn't feel comfortable selling it or any of the pre-200 issues until he had priced them out but he had no clue that there was anything special about that particular issue and said he'd sell them to me for a fraction of the Overstreet value guide. I should've made him an offer he couldn't refuse right then and there, $500 cash or something, though he probably would've taken $2-300. 

I, of course, lost touch with the guy after a few more texts asking if he had priced them out yet. He was really busy with work and hadn't gotten around to it, though he promised he would soon. Alas, it wasn't meant to be. But for one night I held a 9.6-9.8 copy of that issue in my hand and cursed myself ever since for not offering him a couple hundred bucks on the spot for it.

I did make some money off the rest of the issues though, and I sold most of them on r/comicswap, so some good people got some good comics from my very own mini-Church collection. But that issue will always be the one that got away.",2016-04-11 01:37:50+00:00,d1xyfd9,7.0,t1_d1xx4ab,2210.0,comicswap

So I usually buy any random 9.8 New 52 Batman issues I can get for less than $18, as that is the minimum you'll ever spend to get a comic graded through CGC, with no guarantee that'll come back a 9.8. I got this slab for $16 shipped back in January.

I also bought an ""investment lot"" of 5 issues of Batman #21 for $10 on eBay when it was first released just because I really liked the cover and the idea of a new Batman origin story. Another copy came with my complete run set. They seem to be going for $20-30 on eBay right now, making #21 the second most valuable regular cover behind Batman #1. 

I have every combo pack variant so naturally I have a #21. I just wish I would've bought more copies when it was going for $6, as it's now selling for up to $100 sealed.

The 1:25 We Are Robin #1 was an auction I won for $3 from a seller I had already bought a few things from, so I was just trying to add some cheap retailer incentive variants since the shipping was already paid.

The notion that sex is inevitable just because she touched my cock seems naive when you've been with someone for a long time. 

If we're binge watching a show for hours one day and we've already fucked a couple of times and she pulls me out and just caresses me or strokes me or even puts me in her mouth, that doesn't always lead to sex. If you expect to have an orgasm every time you get turned on, you miss out on a lot of the things that just feel good, like OP mentioned, because you're partner is thinking ""I better not get him started unless I feel like fininshing him off"".

Waited and trapped him again, put another 3-4 entire clips in him and he still wasn't dead. Ended up downing from the insane amount of zombies pouring in after the trap wore off. I'm thinking that shotguns like the Brecci and Haymaker are far superior to the Drakon.

It's a bit more for pre-1975 comics and even more if they're more valuable. Cons might be completely different and I think the having them witness a signing for the Signature Series costs more too.

My LCS drives their comics to CGC in Sarasota three times a year and picks them up on the next drop-off. It costs $25 each (a little more for pre-1975 issues) to have them graded, which isn't bad.

2220,"My A/C went out one summer and I was told I'd have to get a new unit and quoted $7,500. I was pretty broke at the time and living in Florida so it was hot af. It stayed that way for 2 years before I could fix it. I had one night stands get up in the middle of the night and apologize for leaving but it was just too hot and the couldn't do it. I learned to deal. I had a chick that I really liked make it through the night a couple times so I started freezing a 2 liter bottle of water and putting it front of the fan at night which blew directly onto the bed. This actually worked and I'm sure she appreciated the romantic gesture.

Anyway I also had a cat which I let go in and out as he pleased. He had a bite taken out of his ear and would come home with wounds he acquired from taking on the neighborhood dogs. He was declawed so he had to fight like a 30's style boxer and his smack was pretty powerful. I would leave a small window in the laundry room, which faced the front of my house, open and that was how he got in and out. One day I was out front on a hot July day and the 200 year old neighbor lady, who lived alone and whom I rarely saw and had only spoken to a couple times, mentioned that I shouldn't leave the front window open because it would let all of the cool air out and cost a fortune on my power bill. I informed her that I didn't have A/C, hadn't for years, and that, considering I hadn't eaten in a couple days, A/C was the least of my worries. That was about the extent of our conversation. 

Later that evening there was a knock on my door and I opened it to this nice old lady handing me a huge bowl of homemade chicken noodle soup and a $20 bill and saying, ""no one should have to go hungry."" My first instinct was to politely decline but it was obvious she was set on this act of kindness and who am I to deny her that? I really hadn't eaten in at least a couple days and before that was a steady diet of McDoubles whenever I could scrounge up enough to change to buy one or two so I devoured the soup after thanking her profusely and promising to repay her.

I bought a pack of cigarettes since I also, as a regular smoker, hadn't smoked in a couple days. And before that was a couple good sized butts from an ashcan outside of a gas station so I was pretty hardup. I felt bad buying smokes with her $20 but I figured she'd understand. 

I started working a few weeks later and upon receiving my first paycheck I brought her some fresh shrimp home from work and handed her a folded up $100 bill. I'm not sure if she was even aware that I was paying her back with interest because she was old and probably well off and didn't make any mention of it in the future but it felt good to do it. 

And that's probably one of the reasons why I'm sensible to Bernie's ideas of Socialism and so against the notion that people shouldn't recieve help and should pull themselves up by the bootsraps. In this example, helping me out actually made financial sense for her in the end, with her being repaid 5X her initial investment. I think helping people get to a better place is something we all should do regardless of finances but the return is a nice little bonus.

Anyway I forget what even prompted me to write this or what even OPs original comment was. Go figure.",2016-03-09 15:00:43+00:00,d0tebl7,4.0,t1_d0t3459,32672.0,AskReddit

Yeah they patched that.

I used to get so many kills while 3 people crowded the catwalk splitting what was leftover. Now it's a death wish to stay down by power, which sucks. They didn't make the catwalk harder, why are the people that would actually play legit being punished? You can't train down there because of people shooting from the catwalk.

So now I stay in spawn or, if the doors to Kuda haven't been opened, I use the alley strat. It's is just as easy and boring as catwalk with 2 or 3 people but is pretty damn challenging when you're by yourself and everyone else is at catwalk.

64. Deadpool #7
65. Mockingbird #1
66. Black Widow #1
67. Power Man and Iron Fist #1
68. Avengers Standoff: WPH #1

In other words, for the sake of clarity: if you *were* including Black Widow #1 and Mockingbird #1 but *not* Black Panther #1 in your original total of 67, then we're on the same page. If not, then I'm missing 2 or you're off by 2.

Actually if you're not including next week's Avengers Standoff #1 and Power Man and Iron Fist #1 in your original number of 67, then we're actually off by 4 and also completely fucked. I've got all variants and a checklist I've added to every week so I don't know how I can be off.

I was watching tons of vids and realized that none of the pros or high round guys use it, a discovery that was very comparible to my realization that no really good bowlers throw the ball straight, they all curve it. My headshot game has improved so much since I stopped relying on aim assist so heavily, which means my ammo situation has improved and my TTK has been drastically reduced. Honestly, I was kind of at a skill level plateau and it wasn't until I started learning how to headshot hip fire, aim without aim assist, and use the ADS without spamming it that I started getting a lot better. I also never used snipers before BO3 and now I can crush with the Drakon or the Locust.

So hip firing increases your chances of missing with one of the bullets after the split, correct? But ADS doesn't 100% guarantee that both will hit.

I guess point my is that the statement ""it doubles the damage but only whilst ADS"" is incorrect. It's still possible to receive double damage while hip firing and it's completely dependant on your aim.",2016-01-10 20:47:12+00:00,cyt8e4r,8.0,t1_cyt5kuq,4085.0,CODZombies

2753,"The value on modern variants is still yet to be pinned down. I'm mostly into investing and here's the thing: the value of older comics has pretty much been determined. They may fluctuate a bit as a result of a new film or something along those lines but from an investment standpoint, older comics are a long term investment and since the valuable ones are already valuable, they eat up a lot of your investment money.

On the flip side, modern variants have the ability to skyrocket in a matter of weeks, an important factor for short term flippers. This goes for modern non-variants too and the investment is minimal. If you're buying comics from a vendor online and paying ~20% off cover price, it's gonna be really hard to lose money and the potential for a sudden increase in value is much higher than Silver Age books.

Just a few weeks ago, IDW gave us Back To The Future #1 for $3.99. I paid $3.20 for it upon release and it's going for around $10. That doesn't seem like much but that's 3X what I paid for it in a month. In how many other investment opportunities are you likely to see returns like that? Look at the Star Wars #2 action figure variant, a $3-4 investment is now going for $75 all day. That's 25X profit in just over a year!

Now of course there's no way to **know** which issue is going to increase in value to such extremes as in that example but that goal is to recognize the potential for an increase in value. There was no 100% way to know that the #2 Han Solo variant was going to be worth 4X more than the #1 Luke Skywalker variant but it's a pretty safe bet that they're gonna be collectable so you just buy them all. I've paid $3 for each one upon release and I see dozens of any particular issue going for &gt; $4-5 every day so there's literally no risk! I always put my money down on no-brainers: your Batman #1s, your Back to the Future #1s, your Harley Quinn and Suicide Squad #1s, your Deadpool #1s; pretty much all #1s. Statically speaking, #1s have a far better return on your investment. No one saw The Walking Dead #1 becoming what it has but if you didn't see the relaunch of Batman increasing in value, you weren't looking.

As far as investing goes, it boils down to two things, the same as all collectables: rarity and popularity. IMO, as long as you're getting a good deal on them, retailer incentive variants are a pretty safe bet. I have dozens of the new ANAD Marvel 1:25 variants and the most I paid for any one of them was $5.85. Most of them I win in bid style auctions on eBay for ~$4. Thats the same price you'd pay for the regular cover price in stores, which I also pick up. The 20 or so 1:50 variants I have - ASM, Invincible Iron Man, All New Avengers, Uncanny Inhumans, Dr. Strange, etc. - I won for &lt;$10 apiece. Actually $8.35 was the most I paid for any one of them. They're up for auction all the time and it's hard for me to pass that up. I've yet to see how much they'll be worth in a year or so but I figure worse case I can get my money back on em. On the flipside, this is **NOT** always the case with the high demand variants like the recent J. Scott Cambell or Gwenpool variants. If you're paying $50-100 on release, the chance of you doubling your money in a year are pretty slim. The exception to paying full price for variants, and what I've shown in these pics, are limited prints like these Hoknes variants. There will only ever be 100 of these, they go for $14.95, and there's not a super high demand for them because the quality and popularity of the series has not been established yet, so they seem like a good investment. I've watched this Niobe: She Is Life #1 variant sell for between $75-100 over and over and over again. The **Only** time it's sold for less is the last time one sold on eBay and that was for $43 to me. I bought it to keep the value up around the $75 range and corner the market. If it goes for any less than that, it's going to me. The Super Zero variant is a new series by Conner and Palmiotti of Harley Quinn fame so I'm willing to drop $15 on another potential Niobe. If they do well with Super Zero, it'll give Aftershock Comics a bump and that's why I consider the others a safe investment. Garth Ennis and the plot behind Sreaming Eagles seems like a safe bet.

I saw an article last week that Legos have been a better investment than gold since 2000 and I believe it. With comics, you have even more of an advantage because once they print how ever many copies of a certain issue, that's it. That's all there is no matter how well it sells. They'll make a 2nd print and a third print and so on but that's all of the first print covers there will ever be. I bought the $400 Lego Death Star after word from an insider that it would be discontinued soon, causing it to soar in value. But until then, anyone who wants one can go on lego.com and buy one. It's sold out pretty often but they'll just keep making more. Hell, if the sales are that good, they'll probably keep making em for that much longer! That's not the case for comics. Once the initial first print sells out, you own something that can no longer be purchased on the distributor level and therefore your only hope is to buy on the supply and demand controlled aftermarket. 

My theory is that you might not make a heap on one single issue like you may a Silver Age comic, but the math is in your favor with modern age comics. If I can sell my $3 comics for $6 (nevermind those that skyrocket in value), I've literally doubled my money. Again, that may not seem like much but doubling your money on any investment, with an added chance of doing far more than doubling, is a good thing. You're not gonna find ASM #300 and flip it for double your money anywhere. With my strategy, it's quantity over quality. I may only make $2 on each comic I buy but if I buy 1,000 comics, that's a $2,000 profit. Using these numbers, $50 worth of modern variants is going to net you far more than a Silver Age Batman issue for that same price over a short time period.

I hear people say all the time that comics are a bad investment and I disagree. With the rise of digital media fornats, printed collectables are just becoming more and more rare and sought after. Add in the sending of a batch of keys to CGC a few times a year, which will dramatically increase the value and maintain it for years to come, and comics are a pretty solid investment. At least I'm willing to bet that it is.. and these are pretty big wagers. But again, I've got about 8,000 comics and if I make $1 off of each one, that's $8,000 in the black. If I made $5 of even half of them, just as an average between the ones I'll make $10 off of, that's $20,000.

From an investment standpoint, and only an investment standpoint, modern age and variants are the safe bet, as long as you're buying in bulk. Which is something you're also not really able to do with Silver Age comics and a small initial investment. I might get lucky and flip a $1,000 Silver Age comic for $1,200 and make $200. But with that same $1,000 I can but 300 modern comics and hopefully make an average of $2 off of each one, netting me $600. That's 3X the profit for the same investment. It's a lot more work to sell 300 comics than it is to sell one but that's where the love of comics and enjoyment of collecting and selling comes in. If my goal for the month was to sell one comic, I'd be hella bored throughout the month.  

It's a gamble, sure. But it's a low risk gamble with a lot of potential for profit.

Also I got Deadshot, which I always considered a waste of a perk slot, as a free perk one game and that changed everything too. I definitely get it over Speed Cola now (when it spawns instead of Stamina Up) and using it with the Drakon or even a powerful automatic like the Gorgon is so badass. 

Trying new strategies and playing with guns or in areas that you're not comfortable with keeps you on your toes, keeps the game feeling fresh, and improves your ability. I could see The Giant getting old for people that buy their guns and perks and sit up on the catwalk for 20 rounds until they go down (so fucking boring) but I've found a way to improve my playing as well as the enjoyment.

Kratom completely alleviates opiate withdrawal symptoms; I've tested this time and time again and so many of my friends have done the same. It works. Now if she's looking to nod off and experience roxy-like symptoms, she might be disappointed. Though, after years of being on Suboxone (which I was on to get off Oxys, which I was on to get off of heroin), I can honestly say that I did get that warm opiate feeling for the first few weeks on 2 gram doses. Months later I don't get that feeling anymore but I haven't felt PAWS in so long and that in itself is a miracle.

I will say that daily use is the only thing that kept me on this path. I can skip days or even weeks now and only experience minimal discomfort but for that first couple weeks, until all the opiates were out of my system and my body and mind had adjusted, I needed daily use. If she only takes a pill or once a day, she should be fine with just dosing K in the morning but if she felt like she needed another dose halfway through the day, at least for the first week or two, that's much better than feeling like shit and seeking out a pill.

Lastly, dosing on a COMPLETELY empty stomach can not be stressed enough. The only problems any of the people using this method and not feeling results had were the cause of dosing after eating or eating too soon after dosing. Once they got the hang of it and dosed first thing in the morning and waited an hour or two to eat, they were convinced. Not one of us has relapsed.

I know what doses Suboxone comes in, trust me. I know everything you've stated and more because I researched the fuck out of it when I was trying to get off of it.

We're just gonna have to agree to disagree. Be sure to report back in a few additional years and let us know how great you're doing on Suboxone.

There's a host of other issues I have with your post, like your 1mg Suboxone idea. I was started, by my doctor, on 24mgs of Suboxone. I didn't take thst,much because I didn't feel I needed it but nevertheless, that's what the docs in my area start new patients on. I literally don't know anyone who is prescribed 1mg of Suboxone unless they're in the final stages of tapering to get off of it. Where did you even get that number? Would you care to wager on if or not OP is in fact on 1mg of Suboxone?

Another is your shortsided comment that it's Subs or dope. You're wrong. There are other ways and just because your doctor is not telling you about them doesn't mean they aren't available.

But I don't have time to address your entire comment, nor do you seem like the type to be receptive of any information that doesn't align with your perception of how beneficial Suboxone is.

2880,"I didn't say anything about being on Suboxone being similar to being on heroin, though it is a lot similiar than the average person would expect; the main reason being that it hasn't been classified as an ""illegal"" drug yet. Dont forget thst heroin was a presription medication for a long time too. It's a fact that Buprenorphine is 50 times stronger than morphine and as such, is highly addictive. Trust me, I and all of my addict friends thought Suboxone was a miracle when we made the switch from dope. Fast forward a few years and almost all of them are pulling the same tricks to get Suboxone that they were pulling to get dope.

Because sobriety is being free from addiction. It gets rid of the craving and stops the withdrawals but then what? Then you're craving Suboxone and withdrawing from it all the same, just for a longer amount of time.

Again, my goal is not to discourage OP but to educate him/her. It doesn't ""qualify"" as getting high? To who? The doctor prescribing it or the manufacturer giving him kickbacks to push it on desperate addicts? This is the same justification that addicts use to make themselves believe that they are doing the right thing, which may only be the lesser of two evils.

People have been believing the narrative that you're reinforcing for far too long. Suboxone is dangerous when used long term and anyone taking it should know that. I've seen it ruin lives in exactly the same way that heroin did. Downvote away, I could not care less when someone's well being is at stake. If there's a 0.001% chance that my comment makes OP reconsider what he/she has learned about addiction and sobriety, it's worth as many downvotes as you all can muster. 

Believe me, I was on opiates/opiods for 8 years and Suboxone for 4, I like to think I know what I'm talking about. Whether that qualifies me as being ""that guy"" depends on how you meant it. But again, OP, if you have any questions or would like any evidence of my claims, feel free to PM me. Whatever you do, work towards getting off Suboxone and becoming free as soon as you can.

2881,"No one is arguing that he/she shouldn't feel proud but it's a disservice to anyone who's kicked Suboxone to claim that you're ""sober"". Having been on opiates/opiods for 8 years and Suboxone for 4, I believe I'm uniquely qualified to express my opinion on the matter. 

Buprenorphine is 50 times stronger than morphine, the chemical that Heroin is converted to in the body. 50 TIMES! Mark my words: when the long term effects of Suboxone are fully realized, it will be considered as dangerous, if not more, that currently prescribed opiates. 

I'm not here to shit on someone's progress but that doesn't mean we should sugar coat it. I have friends in the medical community from my years of running the Oxycontin Express that have knowledge of behind the scenes studies on the dangerous effects of Suboxone. Aside from that, one of my former doctors won't prescribe Bupe because he believes it to be morally wrong to do so. If anyone thinks coming off heroin sucks for a week or two, I will tell you: it doesn't compare to the year of post acute withdrawal symptoms from Buprenorphine's binding to your receptors. That was hell, a long, drawn out hell. 

It's very kind to congratulate someone on their recovery but I don't think we should neglect to inform them that being on a prescription medication used to treat addiction is not sobriety. If someone was on Methadone for all the reasons you stated, would you call them sober? How about heroin back before it was a schedule 1 drug? When doctors were still commonly prescribing it, were the patients ""sober""? I cannot equate being addicted to a substance and sobriety.

I don't think encouraging someone in recovery to redefine what they consider sobriety based on what they've been informed by pharmaceutical companies is the evil thing you all are making it out to be. 

Anyway, OP, if you'd like to progress further in your recovery and end the cycle of addiction and would like some information or advice from a longtime addict who pulled it off, feel free to PM me.

2971,"I respect that. I just think that Avery is a twisted murderer. I don't think he was a criminal mastermind that was able to clean up a crime scene to the point of not leaving even a trace of microscopic DNA. If you do believe  he was capable of such logical plotting, you'd also have to believe that he would've used the crusher to dispose of the victim's car instead of leaning some branches on it in an attempt to... what, hide it? So he meticulously cleans up  the garage, the bedroom, and anywhere else where the victims DNA could've been left behind, which is everywhere, but he doesn't even attempt to clean the vehicle or DISPOSE OF THE KEY? He has 40 acres of junk to hide or bury the key in - that's not including the idea that he could've driven somewhere and thrown it in the woods or into a river - and he hides it behind a bookcase in his bedroom? Okay, but he had the foresight to bleach the garage, completely ridding it of all traces of DNA, and then reintroduce his DNA back into it so that they wouldn't suspect that he had cleaned it?

Furthermore, this good ole boy who has been poor his entire life and wanted nothing more than to be free after 18 years of being unjustly incarcerated and marry his fiancee is about to be a millionare when he decides to randomly commit murder on a whim and happens to be so good at it that there's not a single witness nor shred of DNA? Then he burns the body in a pit behind his house and parks the car a few dozen feet away?

So is he a bumbling murderer or a criminal mastermind? He can't be both.

As I said, I respect your opinion on the matter, I just don't see how anyone could come to that conclusion, especially when you believe that Dassey is innocent. No DNA anywhere?? Not a hair? I'm sorry but this guy is not a maniacal murder genius. Even without all the conflicting evidence and shadyness of the authorities, I just do not think he was capable of murder, much less perfectly covering it up. I don't know him personally, but I'm from the south and I know plenty of poor rednecks just like him and there's just no way.",2015-12-21 01:05:51+00:00,cy62u7q,5.0,t1_cy5wyql,9866.0,MakingaMurderer

2974,"Yeah, it's basically:

Serial
•0 physical evidence against Adnon
•Most incriminating aspect is hearing him talk 
•People come out of the woodwork to defend him because of his squeeky clean image
•He couldn't' have done it, he's such a nice guy and from a well to do family

MaM
•Loads of physical evidence against Avery
•Biggest sign of his innocence is hearing him talk
•No one defends him because of the reputation of being riff raff
•He had to have done it, he's poor and not very smart and from a trashy family

This is like the anti-Serial. If anyone thought it was a tragedy that Adnon was convicted, I don't see how those same people can't be up in arms about Avery's. But with Adnon it was ""there wasn't enough evidence"" whereas this is more like ""he didn't do it"".

I'm tough to gift, I can't think of a whole lot that I haven't already gotten for myself; my family hates buying for me. But I'm focused on moderns right now and Image especially. I only buy NM so I only read TPBS and I'm really here more to give than receive but I'm a huge Batman fan. I love TWD and have all issues from 130 through 148 and I'm trying to fill out my Sex Criminals set, of which I'm missing 2, 4, 5, and 6. I'm also into variants with eye appeal but again that's mostly as an investment and I'd really like something to read. You literally can't go wrong and anything will be greatly appreciated. Looking forward to hooking one of you dudes up!!

I hope my interests aren't too specific. Again I'm really hard to buy (gift) for. I'm also a big Grant Morrison fan and into more mature reading (again, a lot of Image titles fit this bill) and not so much the super hero stuff
 but if you're a fan of it and you think it'd make a good gift, you can't wrong! Cheers!

You start with 500 points, Player 1 use that to open the first door and use beast to open everything and do the ritual with all 4 players. 

Now players 2-4 all have 1000 points (500 to start plus 500 for ritual. Player 2 knife 2 zombies, giving him a total of 1260 (1000 + 130X2). Open the next door and use Player 2 beast mode to open everything. 

Complete ritual #2. Player 3 and 4 now both have 1500 points (1000 from starting points and 500 + 500 for both rituals). Each one opens the last 2 doors and ritual sites. All doors to each district are open. 

On top of this, 2 Margwas will spawn, 1 on ritual #2 and one on ritual #4. That's 1500 points each (500 points for each head X2) for one player or you can share the 3000 points however you want by each killing a head. Then you have rituals 3 and 4 for 500 each to every player and you've only killed 2 zombies on round 1.

3213,"In my experience, I tapered down from 8mg/daily to 2mg daily before I jumped off. I then waited through 3 days of hell before taking the K I had ordered. I didn't have high hopes and I wanted the contrast of effects to be noticeable. It was that and then some. I haven't touched Suboxone since then, after a decade long opiate habit. Afterwards I really pondered whether the 3 day wait was necessary and I've turned a couple other Sub friends onto K and told them just to wait as long as they could but definitely at least until the next day after their Sub dose and preferably when they're feeling the WDs pretty bad. One made it 24 hours, one closer to 36, and they both said it made their WDs disappear instantly and they felt great and are both completely off Subs now. I know that Bupe has a long half life and the WDs don't get too bad for the first couple days but if you're an addict and have been on them for years, you're psyching yourself into early WDs when you haven't taken your daily dose. Anyway, there were no adverse effects for any of us and I'd advise your friend to just hold out as long as he can and the longer he waits, the better of an effect it'll have. But there's really no need to mix the two; imo he should switch to K and get off the Subs because they're terrible. Good luck.",2015-11-20 08:36:18+00:00,cx6py9k,1.0,t3_3tirps,19683.0,kratom

Then they go down somewhere else in the map and you have to go find the part? That's a design flaw; there's too many people that simply don't know what to do and don't care to learn. Good players shouldn't be punished for that. Even a shared inventory would work, but when the team can't progress because of one person, that sucks.

It reminds me of the people who rush to pick up drops like it's a race. Just got an instakill and a nuke drops? They race to pick it up, wasting the instakill. Just finished a dog round and got the max ammo and the first zombie killed on the next round drops another max ammo? Hurry hurry, pick it up before anyone else can even though we don't need it!!!

These are the same people that pick up the double points in spawn in Mob before round 1 even starts and whatever drop is in the room in Shadows that you open up in spawn. No strategy whatsoever, just picking up everything they can. And wasting the beast fountains just to roam around and do absolutely nothing. Then you have to go find a fountain that's further away from the item you're trying to obtain or the room you're trying to open up. So fucking annoying.

3470,"Well her plan is 4 years old and she receives 8gb a month (which she only uses half of) and is $113/month. That's two years after her two year contract was up, so her 4S is more than paid for. It's hard to imagine a worse plan than that. 

I'm thinking I might just stick with Straight Talk as it'll be the same price as Cricket for the 5gb plan and I wouldn't have to worry about porting my number and I if I'm not mistaken, I could just take the SIM out of my current 4S and and put it in the new 6S. Do you know if they accept the same SIM? 

As far as her plan, we'll check with Verizon and see what kind of plan would be best for her to switch over to. It'd be nice to cut her rate in half by only buying a new phone.

She definitely needs unlimited talk and text but as far as data, she's mostly on wi-fi as well, with half of her time being spent at work and half at home, both on a wi-fi connection. She has averaged about 3gb per month with her biggest being just over 4; she's never hit 5.

I read here that Cricket throttles you to 8mbps, which I'm totally fine with, but what's the cap? At what point do you get throttled? 1gb?

I've been collecting comics for years now and watching them increase in value is fascinating. Some are a gamble, for instance: Suicide Squad #1 ungraded came out in November 2011 and is now selling for about $90. It's original price was $3. In a little under 4 years, it has increased in value by 2000%. But investing now is risky because its value is inflated due to the soon to be released movie. Now I don't see it ever going below its initial retail value, so there's absolutely no risk in buying when they come out, but if the movie tanks it will drop dramatically. On the flip side, if it's a record breaking release, it's value will increase exponentially. The same goes for comics like the new Ms. Marvel or the new female Thor. They came out in 2014 and are already worth at least 5 times their cover price. What else in this world can you buy and sell a year later for 5 times what you paid for it??

Batman #1 is a sure fire investment and will only go up and up as physical forms of media become more obsolete in the digital age. Having it CGC graded means it's sealed air tight and will still be as pristine 40 years from now as it was when you bought it. I see people saying there's no guaranteed investment but if you get in at the right time, comics are exactly that.

3561,"Well, personally, I've been medicated for half of my life for chronic pain so I'm in no rush to get off of it. Aside from that, I've no doubt that PAWS can last for about a year after such heavy Suboxone use but I took a couple week break from Kratom at about the 3 month mark and I felt fine. If there was any withdrawal from such small doses of K, I didn't really notice them. The main thing was a desire to take it again to relieve my pain but that's probably not going away until I get surgery. But I'm convinced that the more time I get in between Suboxone and quitting K, the better I feel. I'll skip a day here and there every couple weeks and I almost feel like back to normal again. I'll stop taking K when I feel like I'm ready and see how a couple months off if it feels.

I, again personally, started out with Herbal Salvation, as did my friends. I've tried a few other, cheaper vendors but I feel like I've had to take more to get the same effects, which really doesn't make it that much cheaper at all. Maha Kali really does the trick for me, I'm partial to reds, but the Red Borneo from HS is fire right now and a little cheaper. On the other hand, the Hulu Kuapis (or whatever) isn't doing anything for me. I got a couple reds from Fresh Kratom that were decent too. The White Horn I got from Fresh is good but is a little too stimulating for me. I'd get a sample pack like many here would suggest and just see what works best for you. A couple of my friends agree that reds are a great replacement but my other female friends swears by greens, says reds don't do much for her. Everyone is different, you just gotta experiment. That goes for dosage too, but if you are seriously WDing, 2 gram will feel like the definition of relief. If you're looking for something more, you might need to take more. If you want to not WD, 2 grams is all you need. Play around with it, any strain or amount will come out to be exponentially cheaper than any medication, and your body and mind will thank you.",2015-09-06 02:19:42+00:00,cus3t57,5.0,t1_cus28bj,3295.0,kratom

I took my last quarter and waited 3 days before taking K, just so the effects would be that much more noticeable by contrast as I didn't have high hopes. I was wrong. Kratom took away the WDs instantly and because I had waited so long and was WDing so bad, the difference was drastic. I had been on Subs for 3 years and a ridiculous amount of opiates for 8 years before that. It's been 5 months since I took any opiate besides Kratom and I feel like a new person. Subs were literally the worst drug I've ever been on. I've turned a few other opiate addicts on to K also and it's worked for every single one of them, though I told them they might not have to wait the 3-4 days and most of them started taking it the day after their last Sub dose. We all started at 2 grams, most of them are still at 2 and I'm taking 3-4 grams twice a day. I took 2 grams 3 times a day to begin with for the first 3 weeks, then went down to twice daily. 

Good luck man. Any questions, ask away. But believe this: if you wanna quit prescription opiates, Kratom is a miracle.",2015-09-06 01:08:13+00:00,cus1qwv,3.0,t1_curxpf8,8272.0,kratom

3565,"I've been keeping track of complete Batman runs for about 3 months now, and I finally made my grab last week. I got Batman 0-41, all first prints in NM condition, along with Annuals 1-3 and the first print 23.1 Joker 3-D issue. I went for this lot because I already had the other 3 first print 3-D issues and was only missing the Joker one. The buyer included an unopened 100 pack of bags and boards and gave me free priority shipping. I paid $230. 

Now this was a great buy, and that's why I jumped on it. I've seen similar lots go from between $250-$400. I'm gonna leave my notes here just in case it may help you out. They include the dates each one sold, what all was included (annuals, variants, 3-D, Future's End, Convergence) and if it sold as an auction or through Buy It Now, the latter of which seems to fetch a higher price. The cost of each lot has the shipping factored in. NCS = no condition stated

In my opinion you'd be best off selling it as Buy It Now and just waiting for the right buyer, though there are quite a few on eBay currently and at $500+ it might take a while. The most comparable lot to yours only contained 1-33 and #1 was graded 9.0, it sold on August 8th for $461. 

Hope this helps, good luck with your set!!

3576,"It doesn't, you just have to play for a bit and get a minimum amount of kills for the system to establish an average of how good you are. Basically, you're arguing that it shouldn't average your play and that a few good or bad games should define your rank, which is the opposite of how it should be. Besides, grinding for hours on end is exactly what Zombies is about. The tally marks and blue eyes are all that you receive for the amount of time you play; I think the actual ranks are good for determining the caliber of a particular player. I don't think that dedicated players are rewarded for more hours played, you just need a minimum amount of time played to establish an accurate ranking. If 1 game of getting to round 35 should get you a high rank, what should a second game where you get downed early and don't do too well get you? It's about averages, that's how ranking works. Playing more doesn't get you a better rank.",2015-08-30 03:46:02+00:00,cukeztz,15.0,t1_cukemwu,766.0,CODZombies

The current system is not as flawed as you think it is; the simple fact is: any players that play any game often are going to progress in rank/level, there's no stopping that. But someone who plays every day is probably not going to get knives or shotguns unless they're good. BO2 only rewards you so much for playing often, beyond that the skull, knives, and shotgun rank are pretty good ways to assess skill level. 

I have knives btw. It took me 2 years of playing at least 2-3 times a week but I never started a new account and I have knives with the same account that I had 98 downs on, plus many other games with 20+ downs.

3603,"I like the idea of a drop that gives you half price perks, but for only 15 seconds, so you'd really have to choose which perks to buy. I could make my way around to all 4 perks in 30 seconds on smaller maps (Town, Nuketown, Farm); with 15 seconds I'd have to make a difficult choice on which one(s) to race for. I guess for bigger maps, especially the size that SoE is supposed to be, 30 seconds wouldn't be as OP and would allow you to get to at least one or two perks if you were nowhere near one when you picked it up.

I agree it should be nerfed and here's how: for the entire 15 seconds, your current perks are ineffective. They could temporarily go dark like they do in Tranzit with the power off. So in all likelihood, you'd have to survive without Jugg (and whatever other perks you have) for 15 (30) seconds to obtain additional perks for half price, making whether or not to even pick up the drop at all another difficult choice. At the end of the 15 (30) seconds, your previously purchased perks become effective again, along with the new perks you've acquired. 

I honestly think that just that small addition would add another layer of variation and difficulty. Really like this idea.

**EXAMPLE**: *you're playing with 3 randoms who all go down leaving you to kill off the last of the zombies on round 30. You only have Jugg. You kill about half of the final horde, using the last of your ammo, and Half-Price Sale drops as you dodge the horde to sprint towards your fallen comrades who are on the verge of bleeding out. You know that if you pick up QR on the way, you're chances of reviving at least one, if not all of them, will be greatly improved, but you only have 1,400 points. The HPS will reduce the cost of QR to 750, but it will be 15 seconds after you pick up the drop before it will affect your revive speed and, more importantly, your Jugg will be ineffective while attempting to revive. On the other hand, you could pick up the drop, buy QR, get another gun off of the wall or hit the box, all for half price. In this scenario, it'd be better to avoid the drop... or would it?*",2015-08-23 21:14:35+00:00,cud6kpo,1.0,t3_3i4cej,874.0,CODZombies

Then I ordered from Fresh because it was so much cheaper and with the Red Bali I felt no relief with anything under 4 grams and I had to take 6 grams of the Green Borneo to get the desired effect, which was still a significantly lesser effect. 

I'm constantly wondering if it was tolerance kicking in at about the 2 month point but I think that's way too much of a coincidence with switching vendors. I'm convinced that I just got some leaf with a lesser alkaloid content. 

I just ordered again from HS and I plan on only starting back at 3 grams and see how it compares to the Fresh leaf. I guess my question is: have you noticed your tolerance increasing around the 2 month mark? Or have you noticed a difference in the amount you needed between HS and Fresh leaf?",2015-08-19 02:46:33+00:00,cu7u0yb,4.0,t1_cu7tj6p,851.0,kratom

I also like to buy Galvaknuckles before anything else - including a wall weapon, Jugg, or the first door - and I try to do so before rd 5 and try to have all 4 perks before rd 7. This makes the beginning rounds a lot more fun and the Galvaknuckles are 1 hit until rd 14 so I usually don't hit the box until rd 16.

I'm going off of what I've experienced personally, and I think that it's kills to DEATH ratio, not downs, and that you have to have a certain amount of kills to qualify. In other words: starting a new account and getting 500 kills and 1 down won't give you shotguns because even though your KDR would be 500:1, you don't have the minimum amount of kills. People think it's high rounds because along with high rounds comes a lot of kills, so it confuses people.

So if your list remains as is, you're looking at $315 and a substantial boost in your Batman collection. That's a $63 discount altogether from my original prices, and I'd like to think  a far better deal than trying to find all these issues individually. Obviously you can get this total down significantly by dropping keys and older issues, but it's not every day that these issues are available in such grades. Alternatively, I've also updated the post with several issues below the #370 threshold, all the way down to #200, if you'd like to add to it. 

I figure I could ship everything securely with cardboard and bubble wrap for $10 through media mail (as long as you're in the US). If it's any more than that, I'll cover it. If you'd like to do priority, I've no idea how much that'd be but I'd be willing to pay half if it's significantly higher. So that's what I've come up with, let me know what you think.

As it stands, we have no insight into their nuclear programs and many believe this is a better alternative.

3898,"That's what made Mob my favorite map. They're all optional but they made playing a lot more enjoyable. In Buried the buildables were useful - though even that is debatable -and in Die Rise the Sliquifier was cool but neither that nor the Trampolsteam, nor the buildables in Tranzit, were near as effective as the extras in Mob. Nor were the Mob weapons necessary for the EE, like the staves and Maxis Drone and upgraded Monkeys were for Origins. But at least building the staves and upgrading the Monkeys were fun!

That being said, I don't think the buildables were the problem; I think their intention of giving you more to do was a great idea. But they need to be fun to use, fun to obtain, and effective. How many people actually used that damn buildable in the power plant of Tranzit, or the one at the farm? It was pointless. But every time I play Mob I'm after the 6 blue skulls for my Blundergat so I can obtain the Golden Spork. And I'm not even sure if the Redeemer actually does anything more than flash a third time when you charge it and turn blue but I still go through the process of getting it because IT'S FUN! Lasting a round without shooting, then throwing the Retriever in the lava and going into afterlife for the Redeemer was fun, and sometimes challenging. Finding parts and building them at a table is not. Even building the parts for the Blundergat wasn't bad because the reward was worth it, as opposed to the Jet Gun.

With the dude behind Mob and Origins at the helm, I'm thinking the direction they'll go in will meld all the best aspects of previous maps. I was sad to see JZ go but I think Zombies is in good hands.",2015-06-28 02:00:43+00:00,csl1kia,4.0,t1_csl0af0,2947.0,CODZombies
