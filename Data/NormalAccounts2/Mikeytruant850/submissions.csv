Someone mentioned that there was some interest in Detective Comics issues so that, combined with the recent change back to legacy numbering and the [auctions from last night that were getting multiple bids](https://imgur.com/gallery/BuJRX), motivated me to list [this long box of high grade Tec issues](https://imgur.com/gallery/sHAyZ).

95% of these copies came in the same collection that I bought from the old manÂ  who had all the Batman issues. He was the original owner and they are all NM or better. I've been through them all when changing out the bags and boards so I'm not gonna do that again *until you claim them*. In other words, I'll list them all as NM or better and if you want any of them, I will double check when I pull it that it is in perfect condition. The exception are the Bronze Age books with slightly lower grades; I'll post those grades. Consider everything else NM or better in brand new bags and boards. If you buy it and I double check it when I'm putting your order together and it's *NOT* NM or better, I'll let you know (highly doubtful). I just don't have time to look at over 100 issues I already know are flawless, unless they sell.

I usually put everything here before I go the FeeBay route to save a little money and so I can help my fellow swappers. If you wanna wheel and deal or make some offers, come at me Bros.

Pricing on issues starting at #553 will be as follows: single issues you need to fill gaps in your collection that aren't part of a straight run - $3. Keep the runs together and buy multiple issues (from groups of 2 consecutive issues [#582-583] to 3, 4, 5+) and I'll let you have them for $2 apiece. Buy a run or total of 10 issues or more and they'll be $1.50 each. 

This is just a chance to fill some Tec gaps before we reach issue #1000! Any questions are welcome. Shipping will start at $3 Media Mail, packaged securely, or Priority if you wanna spend the extra few bucks. PayPal only.

I woke up to a phone call from my brother telling me that my dad had died. He had a heart attack out of nowhere, died before the ambulance arrived and that was that. We were pretty close and actually business partners but I hadn't spoken to him in a couple weeks because of our hectic schedules and I never got to tell him goodbye. Even worse, I can't recall ever telling him that I loved him and appreciated him; our family just wasn't emotionally open like that. He walked out on my mom and my sister and I when I was 13 and I never got to forgive him and tell them that I understood, that sometimes people just grow apart and I get it. I know he died feeling guilty for that decision all those years ago but he didn't have to, I should've told him sooner.

A friend of mine lost her dad after a 2 year battle with something or another. Towards the end he had become pretty angry at the whole situation and apparently lashed out at her often. His last few years were spent in and out of hospitals having tests ran and looking for a cure or whatever but at least she got to spend those last couple years with him, even though he was not the same kind man as before.

Now she has PTSD. She has insisted that his death has pretty much ruined her life. This is all on display on Facebook, she never misses an opportunity to bring up the fact that he died and she's in such bad shape because of it.

I try to tell her that she's actually lucky that she got to say goodbye and get some closure and that's a small consolation that she could take away from this whole thing but she's holding fast that I'm the lucky one because I didn't have to deal with the grief and watch him get worse and eventually pass. Well it's been almost 8 years and I can say that I would give anything to have been there and watch his health steadily decline just so I could tell him all the things I never got to say. I'm convinced that after enough time has passed, a majority of people looking back would rather deal with being sad in exchange for closure.

I really feel like the bug rounds are holding a secret. There has to be a reason that the bugs die off, like they don't want you to have unlimited time to go around searching with the spark. I also feel like since the bug rounds always come on round 5 or 6, they're giving us time to hit the gobblegum machine once per round before the bug round, so maybe we need a special gum? It's  definitely interesting that bug rounds effect gobblegum usage.

I'd love to, though I can't say that my experience is an accurate representation of the Kratom community as a whole. 

As I'm sure you've learned, there are people from all walks of life coming out in support of keeping Kratom legal: athletes, veterans, and addicts alike. I fall into the latter category. Like many addicts I was placed on prescription opiods after a car accident in 2006. What started as a legitimate way to manage my pain spiraled into an opioid addiction after years of dosage increases with my medication. Opiods have a plateau effect and when your dosage is no longer adequate for your pain levels, your dosage is increased. 

After a few years of crippling doctor bills and increasing negative side effects from the medications, I wanted nothing more than to be done with them and just feel normal again without having to take a pill and see a doctor every month. That's when I was placed on Suboxone, which is a maintenance drug used to replace opiods and eventually be tapered off from. That turned out to be a lot more diffucult than I was led to believe and after many more years of battling with Suboxone and continuing doctor visits and financial instability due in part to costly additional and unnecessary illicit drug testing, one of the conditions of being a Suboxone patient, I found Kratom. My doctor disregarded it every time I mentioned it to him but I decided to try it out of desperation. I'm happy to say that since I took my first 2 gram dose of this miraculous plant, I have yet to take a single prescription medication. 

This plant has helped me with anxiety so I no longer take benzodiazepines and has managed my pain so that taking opiods has been completely unnecessary. There are thousands of people who have experienced this exact same recovery. I'm now able to enjoy my life with minimal pain, near negligent side-effects, and without going into debt to pay for prescription medications that insurance rarely covers. 

As I'm sure you've also learned, this plant has been used medicinally for thousands of years so the placing of it into a schedule 1 category is absurd to say the least. This ""emergency"" ban has disenfranchised a lot of people who now believe that it, and the DEA alike, are purely motivated economically to take this plant away from thousands of people who have come to rely on it for a better quality of life. 

It's frightening to think of what these people will have to resort to if they can no longer afford expensive medications or who, like myself, have no desire to get back into that dangerous cycle. Looking at the consequences of the May 2016 ban in Alabama is enough for anyone who is paying attention to see that there has to be a better way. I've no doubt that we will see an immediate increase in heroin overdoses if Kratom is banned and a nationwide uptick in the casualties of the opiate epidemic we now find ourselves, as a nation, in. 

In my opinion, Kratom is the best solution to this out of control problem and banning it is counter-productive. This doesn't even take into account the thousands of upstanding citizens who will instantaneously become felons if they continue to live their life as they do now, which is for some people the best way they know how.

As a state, Florida had just proposed legislation to ban Kratom that did not pass and died in committee in March. I believed at the time that it's failing may have somewhat been in response to the near unregulated pill mills that had plagued us in the last decade and that perhaps someone higher up realized that Kratom has helped thousands of these people who may have been victims of unscrupulous doctors who were only interested in short term profit instead of the health of their patients. Now we're looking at a ban at the federal level and I can't help but feel like this is just another instance of government overreach. Have we learned nothing from the recent state-level re-evaluation of Marijuana?

I am just one person and though my story may be echoed by countless others in a similiar situation, there are, as I said, innumerable amounts of people from all walks of life who are currently benefiting from the legality and availability of this plant. To disregard their concerns, our concerns, is not only criminal but immoral. I implore you to reach out to some of the veterans whose only path to comfort and a pain-free life has been through Kratom. Their testimony will undoubtedly carry more legitimacy than that of just another addict such as myself.",kratom,My response to a local journalist who is asking people to share their story.

Speaking of cost, $46 was about the lowest price I could find on eBay for 100 Mylite 2s with boards, anyone know a better price?

And speaking of boards, are the full-backs just twice as thick as the half-backs? Is that really necessary considering how thick the Mylites already are? Is there any other difference?

If anyone happens to have a pic of a modern comic in a Mylite 2 so I could get an idea, I'd really appreciate it. Possible a Silver Age and a Modern/Current to compare? One of the listings says that the Modern/Current Mylites 2s are the size of BCW Silver Age bags, is that the case?

Seriously? How did Treyarch overlook this?

I also just finished a game where one dude was using Glitching Queen's Undercroft Storm Bow PaP glitch. Round 28 and I'm running on the bastion, the upper courtyard or by the pyramid, basically wherever I move to when one of the other 2 come running to my spot all willy nilly spamming their bows.

Speaking of bows, watching both of the randoms I was playing with sit in the tomb and wait for me to feed the last dragon is pretty sad. One rushed to the weather vane to claim the Storm Bow and the other has already checked out the paintings and is hitting them before I even pick up my Wrath of the Ancients. This doesn't bother me because I can make and use any bow but c'mon. 

So we play for a while and once we get into the 20s and everyone is set up, they start going down. It's pretty much the same routine: get downed, I revive them, they strait tohe PaP glitch where they sit for the rest of the round, then they go buy Jugg. Then on round 28, one of them comes up to the bastion where I'm running with the Void Bow and the other one goes down. We rush to pick him up and he's red but we still have time to revive him and as soon as we turn the corner to see him in front of the teleporter gate, he disconnects. Game over. I had zero downs. Guess he wanted to save his GGs or whatever, I think it's bullshit. He wasn't even gonna bleed out. Not that it matters on DE, you can bleed out and go pick your upgraded bow up and be right back in the game. That's why DE is by far the easiest map to date and why anyone whining about buffs just honestly  needs to play more and get better. Camping on the catwalk or in the Wundersphere or in between the trams in spawn and spamming the Storm Bow does not make you better. If anyone's highest round is *NOT* DE, then you just haven't played it enough. It's almost too easy.

Which makes me wonder why people need to use glitches. I'm a fan of Glitching Queen, I enjoy her videos and the hard work she puts into them but videos like her latest one with 4 ""invincibility spots"" really does a disservice to the community. I know she didn't discover them and it's not her fault they're there or whatever but when you compile them all into one nice little video for every 12 year old that sucks at zombies to exploit, it's gonna get exploited a lot more.

So not only do we have huge training areas and OP wonder weapons in DE, we also have multiple spots where you can just fire the Storm Bow every few seconds and make round 70 and *NOT ONLY THAT*, but we now have 5 (and counting) glitch spots where the zombies can't hit you. Queen mentions in her video that they're great if you need to take a break or do something AFK *but that's not what they'll be used for.* That's also not how Zombies works. Get a friend to save a crawler or do what you gotta do but I think anyone caught using these glitches should have all their stats reset back to zero. They should lose their rank, their GGs, their unlocks and their high round records and their combat record should be wiped.

Making high rounds used to be something to be proud of, now anyone can do it. And out of the 4 games I played tonight, every single one ended with someone disconnecting. It's ridiculous. 

Then you got one douchebag sitting in the QR door glitch where the zombies don't even come to him!! At least the PaP dude is getting kills! Wtf is this dude doing? The zombies just ignore him... how is that fun?

I used to relish leaving the QR door closed...

No longer.

Playing in pubs used to be fun in BO1 and even in BO2. BO3 has just made it unbearably frustrating to even attempt. I used to never play solo because I enjoy the challenge that playing with people less skilled than you brings. Shitty players will get you killed faster than the zombies will and avoiding that made me as good as I am today. Now I don't even wanna play public matches because 1 person can end the entire game anytime they feel like it and a majority of people do just that. These are problems that literally ruin a huge aspect of zombies and they all can't be patched soon enough.",CODZombies,Black Ops 3 is the nail in the coffin for public matches.

Recently, our wi-fi was down so I went over my 5GB of data and was throttled down to 2G and I let my service expire for a day or two before I got another refill card. When my service was reactivated, it seems I'm still throttled and the difference is very noticeable. I'm back on my home wi-fi so I haven't really bothered contacting customer support because the only time I've ever needed to do so was a nightmare. I figured this was the perfect time to make the switch; who knows if I'll be able to get this fixed and even if I do, I'm still not getting 4G LTE on my 4S.

I've been eying Cricket for awhile and now that I'm a stay at home dad, the 2.5GB plan for $35 is right up my alley. Especially with Cricket offering the Galaxy S6 for $250. I've been using an AT&amp;T SIM on StraightTalk so I assume coverage will be the same, which is great. But where do I order the Cricket SIM? There's a Cricket store right around the corner from my house, which is a pretty big factor in my decision, do I just go in? Is there an activation fee? How much are SIMs and should I buy one cheaper elsewhere?

What about porting my number? I wanted to buy the S6 now but wait until the end of my service month since I just refilled. I signed up for autopay this last time on StraightTalk.com, will it charge me again if I switch to Cricket? Do I need to actively go in and cancel the autopay or will that be taken care of when I switch? Is the cancellation of my StraightTalk plan and activation of the new phone/SIM something that can all be taken care of with a quick visit to the Cricket store?

I was set on buying my girlfriend and I new IPhone 6Ss but I've learned I'd have to buy a new SIM anyway so now's as good a time as ever to show my girlfriend that you don't need to spend $750 on a phone and $100+ a month at Verizon to get good service. Any help is much appreciated. 

Also, if anyone knows a good site to buy Galaxy S6 accessories, especially with Cyber Monday deals, that'd be great.

Her contract has been up for a year+ and I don't have a ton of money, but enough to buy us both new IPhone 6Ss. After reading through the sub, my plan is to buy a 6S from Apple, or eBay if I can find one cheaper, and port my number from Straight Talk to Cricket. 

I've gathered that I need to buy the T-Mobile 6S and order a SIM from Cricket, correct? Then contact Cricket to have my number ported over? 

She is convinced that signing a new 2 year contract is the best way to get her 6S cheaper. I'm trying to explain to her that it's not cheaper and if we have the money to buy the phones outright, we should just do that and go no contract. She wants to stay with Verizon because she needs reliable service for her job and swears Verizon is the best. If she gets a 6S from Verizon, even without a contract, will she be able to bring that phone over to Cricket in the future? Or is only the T-Mobile version compatible? Should she just stick to the Verizon prepaid plan if she buys the phone outright? 

Is Cricket the way to go for me? It seems to be the general consensus on this sub. I rarely talk/use talk minutes, I'm usually at home on Wi-Fi and I don't text much, only to my mom and gf and a couple others here and there, so I though about going with Ting - paying for only what I use sounds appealing because I hardly use anything. Would the process with Ting be the same as Cricket? The big 4 carriers also offer plans with limited talk minutes (100 or 300) and around 5GB of LTE data for comparable prices, should I stick with that? 

If you wanted the 6S and a new carrier, and were under no contracts, what would be your personal plan of attack?

Guess I should've been a little more specific in my first post and taken the time to price everything out. Basically, I've been doing this a long time and while I'm open to any offers and I will beat any Ebay price, I'm not likely to let keys go for a couple bucks. If you're trying to fill gaps, this is a good chance to find collector grade copies for cheap without having to search for them one at a time; I really appreciate everyone who dropped a list, it helps a lot. 

**No need to repost your list if you posted in my first thread, I will respond to each of you individually and I have a lot of what you're looking for, it's just pretty time consuming. Plus my son is due on August 3rd so I'm a little tied up with his mom throughout the day.**

I also hope to get rid of some keys and older issues at a fair price. Feel free to make me an offer on anything you're interested in. 

I will add that a lot of these Batman issues, especially the older ones but also many in the 400, 500, and 600s, came from one older gentleman's collection and he was the only owner; he graded and bagged and boarded them on purchase and changed out these bags and boards every few years. He hated to let them go - I got really lucky with that one - and in my opinion he graded very conservatively; I could see a lot of his VF/NMs actually being NM and the NMs being NM+. But for the sake of fairness, I'm sticking with his grades. You won't be disappointed. 

I know it's hard to fill gaps and my helping you complete yours will leave me with nothing but gaps but ""something something put your kids first"" and all that so I'm just hoping you all can at least get some high grade $2 comics that you need without having to do much searching, and possibly even some keys and older issues you don't see for sale everyday. All comics are 1st prints unless stated otherwise.

Thanks for looking.
