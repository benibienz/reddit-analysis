I made some small talk with her to ease her frustration and showed her how to jump-start her car with the jumper cables she had. She was so happy that I showed her and, in her mind, I had solved the problem...this lady really didn't have a clue that she needed to replace her battery even though I kept telling her she needed a new one too. 


While I was at it, I checker her oil, coolant, transmission fluid, and a few other things and they were all so BAD. Dark oil and extremely low, transmission fluid looked horrible, coolant was low, you name it, she didn't have enough of it or she need it changed. I was straight up with her and said if she didn't start taking care of her car, she was going to have some serious problems in the near future. She flipped the fuck out. She claimed she took care of it, drove it easy, had no accidents (LOL), and that is was running fine! I explained to her about simple maintenance and why it was important, but she was having absolutely none of it.  Of course, I was fighting an impossible war with this clueless woman so after a few ""fuck you's"", ""don't tell me how to spend my money"", and trying to reason with her, I went on my way.

201,"Here is the comment for reference. The thread was an askreddit thread and asked, ""Has anyone ever witnessed an objection at a wedding? What happened after that?""


My reply:


I was at a wedding when the ""funny guy"" (we'll call him Bobby) in the groom's friend group decided to stand up when the question about objecting came up.


Before he could get a word out, another friend of the groom yelled out and said, ""Sit the fuck down Bobby, you ain't got nothing to say!"" Everyone laughed because we didn't really know how to react and Bobby sat down without a single word. He basically made a fool of himself in front of 75 people and made the rest of the ceremony really awkward.

286,"In high school I had an interview with Discover Card to work as a telemarketer at the beginning of summer. I was a decorated junior tennis player with goals to win state titles in the upcoming season...I lost in the semifinals later that year, but that's besides the point.


Anyways, the interviewer reviewed my resume beforehand and noted some of my tennis accomplishments. She began to ask me about the upcoming high school season, my commitment to training, and my involvement in junior tournaments. Stupid me didn't prepare at all for the possibility of any of these questions so I literally froze up and just looked at her in disbelief. My ignorant high school mind thought it wasn't fair that she would ask me such hard questions.


With some thought and a hesitant answer, I just replied ""Oh well, I'd just quit tennis to focus on this job.""


Totally not buying it she replied ""Really? you're going to give up the hard work you've put in and just quit tennis? How do I know you wouldn't do something like that with your job?""


My response was something like ""Ummm well, I guess you would just have to trust me and give a chance.""


Not buying it and visibly annoyed by now, she told me ""You're losing my trust really fast and I think you're lying about your tennis."" Didn't take her more than 10 seconds, but I don't think I could have fooled anyone with my responses and demeanor. 


After a little more back and forth and minimal discussion, she thanked me for coming in for the interview and that she would contact me with further information. Not surprising, but I was not contacted with further information.",2016-08-19 19:03:32+00:00,d6oejtg,1,t3_4ykg19,2196,AskReddit

337,"Okay different kind of cheating people are expecting, but I'll mix it up a little.


For the record, this wasn't me, but it happened during a house poker game I was playing in. I went to a poker room where whoever had the dealer chip would shuffle the cards and deal the hand to all the players (including themselves). When you shuffle, it's typical to split the deck into two and mix them together from there. This guy looked at the bottom of both halves of the deck and made sure the better card of the two would be the bottom card of the deck. As he dealt, he would give himself the high card on the bottom of the deck in an attempt to improve his overall hand. 


Now this doesn't guarantee that you'll win the hand, but any upper hand you can get is a huge benefit in poker. For the sake of details, the person in the ""dealer"" position also has the best betting position which was an added benefit as well. 


After a bit, someone noticed and without knowing, the cheater was being watched by everyone. This was just to confirm the accusation was correct and it could be handled ""properly"". Well, it didn't take too long for everyone to know he was cheating so the leaders of the entire operation took him into a room and I'm assuming they beat the shit out of him. They also left his money on the table so he never had a chance to get any of his winnings or the money he had brought back.


Since the players at the table had been cheated, the head guys of the operation distributed a few chips into the pot from the cheaters stack each hand to give us a little extra incentive. Not a surprise, but we never saw the guy back there again.",2016-08-14 23:30:44+00:00,d6hn3ak,1,t3_4xql7k,1877,AskReddit

339,"Everyone thinks my best friend is my cousin. During our Freshman orientation of college, we met each other, found out we had a lot in common, and just naturally got along well. To top it all off, our last names are ironically the same.


Since we hung out quite a bit and had the same last name, people would ask if we were related so we just started telling everyone we were cousins. In our friend group (10+ people), everyone was sold that we were cousins, but there was the occasional skeptic that would come along. It's funny because we didn't really have to defend our lie. 


Since everyone just defended it for us, it got to the point where we couldn't just tell our friends the truth. I mean, it was a joke that turned into a bigger lie and they'd get so adamant defending us whenever it came to question! 


It was even more awkward when they'd ask us about holiday plans. Things like Thanksgiving and Christmas plans were a complete lie since we had to make it seem like our families celebrated together. Being from the same state and city didn't help much either and just fueled the fire...for all the wrong reasons of course.

408,"Wasn't healthcare reform awesome!? If only they went to the root of the problem and dealt with the incredible corruption of pharmaceutical companies. Also, (I know people won't agree) but how about cutting some costs for medical school? The drowning debt makes it impossible for a new Dr. to get on their feet unless they are pain ridiculous salaries (which they are) after their 12+ years of training (including undergrad). 


Edit: Just one more note, the cost of these drugs that pharma companies are selling to hospitals, pharmacies, clinics, etc. is absolutely outrageous. And guess what, those hospitals need to make a profit on them too, so they up the charge you even more! Start with that problem and maybe an insurance company won't need to charge their clients unrealistic amounts with unfair plans. 


Who knows if they would even change though? If it were up to me, I'd ditch insurance completely, make my own contract with 20 other healthy families for each of us to set money aside monthly. When something happens to someone, they just take from the pool. Obviously there are more details involved that would need to be figured in, but the premise of the idea would be similar to insurance without the crazy percent increase in what the price should be. It's so awesome though, if I were to do something like this (which I would) I'd get to pay an awesome fine to the government for being uninsured when my plan and approach are likely better!

432,"My aunt is an internal medicine Dr. with a specialty in sports medicine.

While traveling on a plane to some conference, the pilot came on the intercom asking if there was a Dr. on the flight and that they must come to the front of the plane immediately. Apparently someone was having severe chest pain and it did end up being a heart attack...don't worry, the patient did ended being okay, but not without some care on the flight and on the ground.

Anyways, My aunt reported to the front of the plane as well as another physician who specialized in primary care. Cardiac issues aren't exactly what my aunt sees everyday and the primary care doc hardly ever has to deal with any sort of immediate emergency within a clinic. Needless to say, the situation wasn't either of their strong suit and out of their comfort zone. Lucky for both of them, a cardiac nurse was also on the flight and my aunt said she basically did the entire assessment and plan for immediate care. My aunt said the nurse was an absolute rock star and things would not have gone so smoothly if she hadn't be there to help.

My aunt will be one of the firsts to say that nurses don't get the credit they deserve for their knowledge and skill-set. This was just one more situation, among others, that my aunt said a nurse saved her butt in a situation. The medical team would truly crumble without great nurses and the value they provide.

466,"Death is something I've seen a lot of and I've grown pretty accustom to it. From working in a human cadaver dissection lab and 2 emergency departments, I've seen some things. 


I saw one case with a physician I worked with, of an 80 year old patient who came in with dizziness and a headache. The physician ordered some basic labs, a head CT scan, and a few other routine workups. About 10 minutes after speaking to this patient and seeing him fully alert, I walked by the room to find him completely unresponsive, eyes glazed over, and basically on deaths doorstep. I immediately informed the physician and he was out of his room in seconds. I've never seen someone be rushed to the CT room so quickly to be honest. Unfortunately it was too late and even if the medical team had gotten him back in time and diagnosed, it wouldn't have been much longer until his brain bleed put him away.


Because everything was done correctly and a brain bleed not being something to really suspect initially, there wasn't any immediate aftermath. Other than informing family members of what had happened, the day carried on as usual.",2016-07-10 09:23:42+00:00,d56i3z0,1,t3_4s4rau,1841,AskReddit

Whenever my friend and I would pick each other up, we'd send each other immature messages to indicate we were at the front of the house (I know pretty immature, but it was high school). Anyways, I meant to text my friend ""Come outside you bitch"", but I mistakenly sent it to my mom. I was pretty mortified and she texted back within seconds with just ""huh?"". 


I ended up taking about 30 minutes to reply since I didn't know what to say. I ended up lying and telling her some stupid kid got a hold of my phone and thought it could be funny to text that to her.

477,"My Grandfather volunteers his time for a religious reform program at a local prison near him in California.


For those who don't know, California has a ""three-strikes law"" which means if a prisoner commits 3 felonies, they are automatically sentenced to a life sentence. This can be 3 separate crimes or 3 felonies all in one situation.


One story he told me that stuck out most, was from a prisoner who was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. I forget his name, so we'll just call him Bob. Bob was asked by a friend of his to take him to the local convenient store to buy a few things. They drove up to the store and his friend asked him to wait in the car and he would just be a few minutes. It turns out, the friend ended up robbing the store and murdered the store clerk in the process. When he got into the car, he had his mind made up that he was going to kill Bob as well, so he shot him in the head. Miraculously, Bob survived the gun shot, but has the dent in his head and physical impairments to show for it.


I don't recall all of the details or charges, but Bob accumulated 3 felonies from the situation and was sentenced to life in prison for being involved in a crime that my grandfather says, he had no intention of being a part of. Just a guess and an attempt at recalling the details, but I believe he had some sort of charge associated with the murder, the theft, possession of a deadly weapon, or possibly something involved with driving the vehicle.


No matter how you look at it, the situation is very sad from every angle.",2016-07-07 08:37:20+00:00,d52l52z,1,t3_4rnboy,4354,AskReddit

573,"My aunt is an internal medicine Dr. with a specialty in sports medicine.


While traveling on a plane to some conference, the pilot came on the intercom asking if there was a Dr. on the flight and that they must come to the front of the plane immediately. Apparently someone was having severe chest pain and it did end up being a heart attack...don't worry, the patient did ended being okay, but not without some care on the flight and on the ground.


Anyways, My aunt reported to the front of the plane as well as another physician who specialized in primary care. Cardiac issues aren't exactly what my aunt sees everyday and the primary care doc hardly ever has to deal with any sort of immediate emergency within a clinic. Needless to say, the situation wasn't either of their strong suit and out of their comfort zone. Lucky for both of them, a cardiac nurse was also on the flight and my aunt said she basically did the entire assessment and plan for immediate care. My aunt said the nurse was an absolute rock star and things would not have gone so smoothly if she hadn't be there to help. 


My aunt will be one of the firsts to say that nurses don't get the credit they deserve for their knowledge and skill-set. This was just one more situation, among others, that my aunt said a nurse saved her butt in a situation.

663,"When I was 19, I went to visit a good friend of mine down in Texas for his birthday. We'll call him James. James lived in a pretty small town in a close-knit neighborhood where he literally knows everyone in a few miles radius. 


Anyways, during the last day of my visit, one of his neighbor asked him if he had an experience with plumbing because his toilet wasn't flushing fully. James and I, with absolutely no plumbing experience whatsoever, decided we'd tell him we've dealt with plumbing problems of our own so we'd probably be able to fix whatever this issue was. The guys said he'd pay us if we could solve the problem so we just figured ""what the hell, let's make a few extra bucks"". Complete bullshit answer by the way since we had no clue what kind of shit we were getting ourselves into...literally.


After taking apart half of the toilet and just generally trying to clean up shit to fix the issue, we felt like our job was done. We put everything back together to the best of our abilities and decided a test flush was necessary to make sure we did it all correctly...Well that was the hope and a terrible idea... The water filled up almost instantly and completely overflowed with backed up sewage and the smelliest, most disgusting mess that is humanly imaginable was made. Keep in mind, my friend's idiot neighbor isn't home this entire time and for some reason completely beyond me, he trusted a couple of teenage guys to fix a pretty complicated (well to me) plumbing problem in the first place. After 2-5 minutes and a flood of shit, we figured out how to turn the water off and minimize the damage that had already been done.


We seriously had no idea what to do so we just left....and waited. 


1 hour later my friend's door was basically knocked down by his neighbor. I was prepared to die honestly or have my ass completely beat down. I felt like I wouldn't have even had the right to defend myself if it came to a fight for the hell we must have caused this man. Anyways, the conversation did not go well, as expected. I was pretty nervous during the conversation, but was relieved he didn't get physical with us. Unfortunately we were not compensated for all of our hard work and the neighbor (who I still think is an idiot for trusting us) cussed us out with every curse word in the English language. Thankfully for me, I got on a flight home the next morning and never had to hear from that guy again. 


Poor James helped clean the mess the next day and even volunteered to chip in and pay for some of the damages. He asked me if I would be willing to help with the damages and I insisted that I had helped enough. Anything extra and I just didn't feel right...okay okay I still thought the neighbor was an idiot and I wasn't go to pay for his poor judgement. 


**TLDR: Visit friend for his birthday, his neighbor asks us to fix plumbing issue, things got shitty (literally), neighbor got mad**",2016-05-29 09:13:50+00:00,d3nvihg,1,t3_4ljojd,3773,AskReddit

922,"I was at a friend's apartment about 5 years ago for a ""moving in"" get together with about 10 others. Halfway through the party, I used the bathroom and when I went to wash my hands, I noticed he had not gotten around to buying hand towels yet. Giving him some slack and understanding it was his first place, I figured I would just grab a few squares of toilet paper and simply dab my hands with that. Not a big deal, but the roll of toilet paper was empty so I just dried my hands on my pants and let my friend know he needed to replace the roll.


After I tell him, this mother fucker walks into the bathroom, grabs what he thought were the ""cleanest"" squares of USED toilet paper from the trashcan and wraps them around the empty roll. I don't know what the hell those squares were used for or what possessed him to do something so unsanitary and absurd, but I didn't end up staying at the party much longer to ask him why.

992,"My Uncle had a heart attack when he was about 40 years old while he was in the hospital getting some blood work done. Anywhere else, he would have been dead without question.


He ended up coding (heart stops or rhythm is unable to sustain life) and he was brought back after about 45 minutes of CPR and defibrillation of his heart. After that, he was placed  in the cardiac ICU in a medically induced coma for the next week for his body to recover. He claims to not remember anything prior to the heart attack, but says he began hearing everyone's voices shortly before coming out of his coma and being able to communicate.


My uncle calls his heart attack the greatest thing that has ever happened to him and my entire family agrees. Prior to the event, he was a severe alcoholic, had tried every street drug at some point of his life, was recently divorced, and was essentially in a downward spiral. Since the heart attack and his recovery, he has really gotten his life together and gone above and beyond what any of us could have imagined. He now works full time as a teacher, just finished his masters, works part time in the summer at the hospital that saved him, and works as an usher for his favorite major league baseball team. While all of that is great, he says his greatest success is the fact that he's been sober for 15 years, hasn't touched a street drug for even longer, is now happily married.

1037,"Hands down the most painful experience I've had to experience was the rash I had from shingles. I've broken bones, had ligaments torn, and even a nail go straight through my foot, but nothing compared to the constant burning that shingles put on my abdomen and back.


When I was only 20 years old, I was under the stress of school, and the physical stress of playing tennis for my university. The combination of mental stress of classes, physical stress from workouts/practice, and lack of sleep really took a toll on my immune system which is probably what caused me to get sick in the first place. Shingles is a sickness that lasts for a few weeks and the entire course of my bout with the illness lasted for about a month.


Shingles effects a single nerve branch in your body and mine happened to be on the right side of my abdomen on my ribs and back. During my first week, I was completely unaware that anything was wrong and I was actually worried that I somehow had broken my rib. Since I didn't have any past injury or trauma, I just decided to tough it out and continue with my routine with school and practices. After 1 week, I noticed a few small blisters with quite a bit or redness surrounding them so I knew something was up. A friend of mine suggested educating myself about shingles and it didn't take long for me to be convinced. About 10 days after noticing pain in my ribs, I had a full fledged rash consisting of over 1000 tiny blisters wrapping around my ribs to my back with constant, severe pain. Wearing a shirt was like having an iron placed on my body and taking a shower was like being stabbed with 1000 needles. It's honestly pretty debilitating and really prevents you from getting a lot done. Anything tennis related and workout related was also completely off the table which was really disappointing at the time.


After about 12 days, the rash and pain worried me so I went to the campus clinic and was prescribed a dose of antivirals. I was told they wouldn't cure me since it was a viral infection, but rather speed up the course of the illness and I would start improving in a matter of days...which it thankfully did. The doctor said it was the worst and largest shingles rash she had seen during her time as a physician and was shocked I didn't come in earlier. Honestly though, I wish I would have gone to the clinic right when I noticed the first blister, but you live and you learn I guess. It was also suggested by the physician that I take a low dose of pain meds twice a day which for some idiotic reason I refused. Again...you live and you learn.


Anyways, the next 2 weeks consisted of the blisters healing and a giant scab forming across one side of my body. Slowly they pealed off and a nasty scar took it's form. The scar has improved drastically, but I still experience nerve pain along the nerve that was affected and I have noticeably less feeling on the surface of my skin. 


My advice for anyone who had read this far; if you have skin pain on any part of your body and notice a rash forming a few days after, DO NOT wait for it to worsen and get some relief from your doctor.

The guy was always so clean cut, had a high position working for GoDaddy and suddenly, he just didn't seem to be acting himself. His clean cut look changed to long hair down to his shoulders with a beard, the normal conversations about his son turned into stories about him and his buddies going to party or going to the big game, and that just seemed to be the tip of the iceberg from the few observations I was able to make. Him and his wife had a very nice home, stable, happy life, and then he started buying pointless expensive items that I'm not sure he even used (well he used some of them like the new Tesla he bought). He also bought a drone, jet-skis, a boat, Dirt bike, and who knows what else. 


Unfortunately the guy ended up cheating on his wife and they ended up filing for a divorce. Can't say that I was surprised, but I felt sorry for his wife and also their son who seemed to be a good kid. He was always respectful and didn't act spoiled in any way.

After eating, we went to the craps table for a few hours to gamble. My 3 buddies called it a night after doing well and I decided to stay and ride the wave of luck I was experiencing. I stayed for about 30 minutes after they had left, when I began experiencing some of the most severe and explosive stomach pain of my life...unfortunately, it was too late for me and I couldn't be saved. I cashed in my chips and got out of the casino doors in an attempt to get to my room, but I simply couldn't make it in time. I took a few more steps out the door when it happened...straight fucking water, all down my leg. I took one more step with my butt cheeks clenched so tight, but it was to no avail. I was so astronomically fucked and there was nothing I could do to save myself. Diarrhea was flowing out of my in a way that I can most closely describe as a sink turned on to the highest level and the smell was truly indescribable.


I stood outside the casino doors motionless and called one of my buddies, Brent, to tell him the situation. Brent brought me a towel, a pair of basketball shorts, a new shirt (yes shit was on my shirt), and some flip flops so I could change. The pair of black bucks, jean pants, and button down shirt were a total loss...luckily I wasn't wearing a pair of socks or they probably would have stuck to my feet from all the shit that had run down. I left my clothes in a bathroom where I changed, used the towel to clean myself up and I went back up to our room to sleep.


The next morning, I told my other buddies what happened and took the best double tapered shit of my life. I kid you not.   ",2015-12-15 20:28:05+00:00,cy05c6w,1,t3_3wzcwn,1680,AskReddit

It's pretty common for other general household cleaning products to be high in ammonia...instead of using Windex or something to that effect, I'll just pee in the bottle and sanitize the entire house while I'm at it.

You're still really young...so am I (only 23) so you've still got a lot of life learning to do, as do I! Don't be afraid to introduce yourself to successful people, schedule meetings with them to ask for advice, if you start a business... learn the right ways to raise capital, don't be afraid to invest your own money in your own ideas. If you don't feel comfortable investing your own money in, an investor sure as hell won't either. If you ever want to get venture, seed, or angel funding, ask these successful people for their advice first! Successful people love giving their advice and seeing you put it to use. One of the most important things I learned when getting funded was: don't go into a meeting looking for an investment, go in looking for advice...if you ask for money, you'll get advice and if you ask for advice, you'll get money.

1364,"Oh man, I've got a perfect story for this one! My girlfriend and I sat near a couple at California Pizza Kitchen who looked like they were on a first date. The guy bought himself and his date both two full sized, rather large pizzas. A cheese for his date and a pepperoni for himself. My girlfriend and I could tell the date was somewhat awkward because there wasn't much talking so we keenly listened to every interaction they made with each other. About 10 minutes into eating their pizzas, the guy with his pepperoni pizza told his date ""you know why I got pepperoni pizza?"" She asked him why and he said he replied: ""Because I was pepperlonely before I came to pick you up and was hoping you'd keep me company tonight."" To our astonishment, she was very receptive to the line and the entire mood of the date picked up from it's boring awkwardness. From what we saw and could pick up verbally, the date instantly turned to a sexually tense encounter with what looked like a race to eat as much pizza as fast as they could so they could get back to his place.


What looked to be a risky move by pepperoni guy seemed to have paid off.

I literally could not get a single word in for a good 45 seconds, but felt horrible if I were to hang up so I let him talk...plus I run the risk of him calling back.

I'm going to let you go so you can call who you need to talk to."" 


What happened next, still baffles me to this day...there was a pause for 2-3 seconds and the guy just busts out laughing... He replies and just says something like; ""Yeah I know I called the wrong number! I'm just fuckin with you and wanted to see how you would respond!""

1424,"Alright here's a crazy one. The patient originally came in to the ER 4 hours prior because she was having an active heart attack. The patient was transferred to the cardiovascular ICU and a cardiologist was called in the do a cath to see what further treatment may need to be done for the heart. During the cath, it's discovered that the patient is having an abdominal aortic dissection. This is basically when the patient has a tear in the aorta and they are internally bleeding at a rapid pace. Shortly after the dissection was discovered and the surgeon is called, the patient codes (patient goes into V-fib/breathing stops...basically dead if she's not in the hospital). She coded for about a minute and was shocked back into a rhythm relatively quickly. The patient was fully alert minutes after the shock and the ER doc who was called down to work the code was communicating that she needed to be intubated and the surgeon was on his way to treat her. While vomiting, all the patient said was: ""do what you gotta do.""

Long story short, the patient made it. That's one of the rare cases where the initial heart attack landed her in the right place at the right time ultimately ended up saving her life.
