As some of you may know from past posts, I love trying homegrown AZ companies and sharing my experiences with the community. Being involved with the AZ startup community, I heard about Great Pros a few weeks ago at a local event just after they had launched. 


Since I needed some trees removed in my front yard, I decided to give it a shot and use the website. The process was pretty simple and involved me filling out a few simple questions and sending my project to local Phoenix companies. I had a few messages on the website and decided to hire who I felt was the best fit. From there, the job was completed without any issue or gimmicks.

**Pros:**


* **Free to use / variety of prices from pros:** The Great Pros service is completely free for customers and according to the guy I hired, it was currently free for him. It was nice to see a variety of prices from companies responding to me as well.

* **Simplicity:** Very simple to use. Within 2 minutes I was done with the questions and waiting for companies to contact me.

* **Multiple Categories:** It seems like they cater to a large number of home service categories which will make me refer back when I need something else done around the house.

* **Real Companies:** No responses from average Joe's. Great pros claims their businesses are all background checked, licensed, bonded, and insured. From the companies that responded to me, this was true.


**Cons:**


* **Limited expansion:** The company is new, so they are only located in Phoenix. Seems to be off to a good start so other areas could see the service soon.

* **New:** Hitting on this again, response times were mildly slow, but I still had multiple within a few hours.


**Verdict:**


My overall experience was all positive. The companies on the Great Pros platform who responded all seemed to be professional and I wouldn't have any hesitation to use again.

I am an advocate for Arizona based and grown companies and always love to share my experience (both positive and negative) with my fellow Phoenix friends. This is my second installment after I received some positive feedback on my [Tuft and Needle mattress](https://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/5675nh/an_honest_review_of_phoenix_based_companies_tuft/) review so I figured I'd keep it going! 


While ReplyBuy might not be the best option for buying tickets, I really can't deny its convenience. After choosing the team I wanted to receive text deals from (the Phoenix Coyotes in my case), I signed up and was immediately texted to confirm my use for the service and add a payment method. From there, deals are supposed to be texted for each home game and if I am interested in an offer, I just reply ""BUY COYOTES"" with the quantity of tickets I wish to purchase.


**Pros:**


* **Deals:** On top of the ""deals"" I was offered, I also received $10 off of my first purchase which is always nice!


* **Convenience:** After replying ""BUY COYOTES 2"" My tickets were texted to me with QR codes in a matter of seconds. This saved the time and hassle of printing tickets like when I've had to using similar services like StubHub or TickPick. 


* **Simplicity:** On top of the service being convenient, it is super simple and pretty self explanatory. 



**Cons:**


* **Price:** ReplyBuy offers deals on regularly priced tickets, but some of the deals don't even come close to what I've been able to snag using competitors. 


* **Limited Team Selection:** Yes, I realize they are a local company and still new, but they aren't fully expanded on a national scale yet.


**Verdict:**


My overall experience with ReplyBuy was very good! I was able to use the service for opening night of the Coyotes game and don't plan on unsubscribing from the text deals/updates any time soon. There were no issues with delivery and the QR code upon entering the arena, which was something that initially worried me. One thing to note: the time savings and convenience don't fully outweigh the time I'm willing to spend to find a better deal on a competitor site. The service isn't fully for me, but I will let it send me more deals in hopes of some bigger savings in the future.",phoenix,An honest review of Phoenix based companies: ReplyBuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/589c89/an_honest_review_of_phoenix_based_companies/

When I needed a new mattress, I immediately thought about all the billboard ads that read ""check out tn.com"" or ""mattress companies are greedy"". The campaign was catchy, it caught my eye, and eventually led me to purchasing a Tuft and Needle Mattress. 


Tuft and Needle is headquartered in Phoenix and seems to be disrupting the mattress industry with their reasonably priced, high quality products. The company develops multi-layered mattresses with the goal of reducing back pain, provide support, comfort, and giving a better night sleep.


**Pros:**


* **Price:** I paid $750 for my king sized mattress when I easily could have spent double for something that was the same exact quality.


* **Sleep:** I'm a pretty heavy sleeper as it is, but I do think I woke up with less aches and more comfort overall.*


* **Design:** It's nice, sleek, and I don't have any complaints about it!


* **Customer service:** The team is great and the 100 day money-back return policy doesn't hurt either!


**Cons:**


* **Firm:** The mattress is a little more firm that I'm used to, which isn't a huge deal. I sleep on my side a lot and it's only a little uncomfortable at times. 


* **New company:** The 10 year warranty is nice, but since they are new, it's hard to know for sure that they will be in business or that long. If I ever need to redeem my warranty, will I be able to?


**Verdict:**


Tuft and Needle has reasonable prices, is Phoenix based, and selling a good product overall. I've had my TN mattress for 3 months now and am very pleased with the purchase. I really feel like I got a good deal, and would highly suggest TN to anyone looking to buy a new mattress. If anyone has thoughts or any similar experiences, I'm interested in hearing about them! I'm looking to review a few Phoenix based companies that I have used and will be using in the near future.

My company was founded with my 2 other partners on a very small pre-seed round of $26,000. All based on an idea. We're now a year and a half into this startup roller coaster and haven't paid ourselves a single penny. We're on the verge or revenue and have been building value for this year and a half as we have all taken this venture on full-time for the last year.


Next week we are closing a strategic partnership which will be our first $25,000 in revenue (not recurring, but terms will be renegotiated after the first year). We're also closing a $100k seed investment with the possibility of raising another 50k-100k. We're very lean and stingy, but all agree the time has come to pay ourselves something.

After the recent explosion of Tesaro Inc. due to encouraging phase 3 clinical trials or their drug Niraparib, the hype continues to grow in the industry.


Then there is Medivation’s drug, Talazoparib. The company claims their drug is the best in the class of competition and has declined multiple offers in what looks to be shaping up as a bidding war for their drug. They had an encouraging conference call today and are pointing at data and claiming that their drug is 50x more effective than Tesaro's recent blockbuster. Clinical results are also expected before their anticipated date.


And then there is Clovis Oncology and their drug Rucaparib. If you compare the results of both Phase 2 results: Rucaparib vs. Niraparib....You'll see Rucaparib has better results. I know this not an indication of how good Rucaparib phase 3 results are going to be, but if this trend continues, Rucarparib will be superior to Niraparib. Plus, Rucaparib's RUCAPANC trials for Pancreatic Cancer look promising as well. FDA approval or FDA NDA acceptance of (Ariel-Ovarian cancer treatment) along with positive Phase 3 trials will send this stock on a rocket ship to the moon. With every positive news and positive press release from the PARP Inhibitor group, Clovis has seen the benefits.


Expect similar benefits tomorrow and in coming weeks-months as the value of Medivation’s drug, Talazoparib increases and preps for an acquisition. If clinical results are as good as they are hinting at, and since we've already seen the results of Tesaro's drug, Clovis will more than likely see the same or they will literally crash and burn. Of all the competing drug companies in the PARP bubble, Clovis is undoubtedly the most undervalued and possessing the most upside.

Recently I threw away my cartridge razors and tried out a double edge razor. My experience wasn't the greatest at first, but shaving with a DE razor has quickly become my normal and has even been quite enjoyable. 


I wrote a bit more about it on my blog and am interested to hear what kind of shaving practices you all use! I'm looking to venture into shaving with a straight edge and trying new things, but still getting used to DE shaving first. I never thought I'd find enjoyment out of shaving or that it would even turn into a hobby, but it has really been growing on me!

After writing a guide for buying a suit, I wanted to write [a guide](http://www.artfultailoring.com/blog/how-to-care-for-your-suit-7-tips-to-proper-suit-care) for those not looking to buy a new suit, but rather provide proper care for their suits.


Here is a quick preview and one of the tips I included :)


Avoiding Moths:

Adding on to my last point, moths are basically a death sentence for any suit. Moths will lay hundreds of eggs in your material and once they hatch, you better get ready for another trip to your tailor. So the question becomes, how can you prevent moths from invading your suit in the first place? Some suit enthusiasts will suggest mothballs, and while they will do the job, the smell can be strong and unpleasant. An alternative that I would suggest, is taking some dried lavender leaves, placing them in sealed pouches, and putting them into empty pockets. This will prevent moths in your suit and it will do so without the smell. Additional measures to prevent moths in your suit include keeping your closet clean and vacuuming the space you place your suit frequently.

What is a bespoke suit? Whether you have a few suits or are looking to purchase your first, you have probably heard a few terms thrown around like: ready to wear, bespoke, or made to measure suits. While each suit has their pros and cons, it is no secret that purchasing any bespoke piece of clothing is the ultimate experience in tailoring. Simply put, a bespoke suit will give you complete control of your purchase. Your clothing will be almost entirely handmade, it will be individually cut to a paper pattern, and you will have access to a wider selection to a wider selection of fabrics among other things. Listed below are some of the most important tips to consider when buying a bespoke suit.

Along with Cisco, IBM, and Palo Alto, they seem to be one of the top leaders in the rapidly expanding cyber security sector. For the last 3 months the general trend has been poor, even after earnings that exceeded estimates in July, FEYE has been trending downwards. I've been watching closely and planned on dropping a few thousand to get in long, but learned today one of the insiders sold 188,000 shares on 9/11. 


What kind of effect can something like this have? I'm assuming in the short terms, effects will be negative which causes me to be wearing of jumping in long at this point. Would an insider trade like this likely have any long term effects? I'm pretty new, only been trading for a few months, so I'm interested in any feedback anyone has.
