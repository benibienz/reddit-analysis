0,Thanks for the reply it really helps. I just feel bad because I know it will inconvenience them and I don't want to look like a p.o.s. They're a great company but I just think that the other job is really what I want to do. I will give it some thought and try to follow your advice.,2016-04-06 17:39:04+00:00,d1sdur7,4,t1_d1s877h,7062,AskEngineers
1,They will want the contract within the next week. The interview probably wouldn't happen for at least one and a half to two weeks.,2016-04-06 15:25:49+00:00,d1s7hag,2,t1_d1s6a1a,1585,AskEngineers
