I am a mining engineer that was recently laid off. Following my unemployment,I was lucky enough to find a job posting and get an interview. I ended up getting the job and it seems like a great opportunity. Since I had no other options at the time, I gave them a verbal yes and have just received a contract to sign. 
Now on to the problem. I was also just offered an interview with a government agency and in speaking with them, it seems like I would get the job if the interview went well. This job is much more closely related to my degree and seems like it would be really enjoyable. I have not signed the contract as of yet but as I basically told them yes, they cancelled all other applicants. So what should I do in this situation? Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated!
