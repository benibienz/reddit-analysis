429,"From another thread:

First grade! Mr. R was probably in his 60's and over six foot, not someone you'd wanna mess with. Normally, he seemed nice, playing kickball with the kids and trying to make lessons interesting. Unfortunately, he also had a love of telling stories to the class. These stories were usually very inappropriate for our age group and of questionable validity. Picture this: a bunch of rapt seven-year-olds listening to this guy go on about the time he talked a drunken man out of shooting him on a camping trip, or the time he got a parasite from eating a banana... the list goes on. Of course, when I came home and told my mother she was mortified. When confronted, he first thought she was praising him and he started bragging. He defended himself well enough that nothing ever happened, but he was kind of a dick to me for a while after.

Second grade was better for me, but the teacher was almost as bad, and much worse to others. She was completely biased towards girls and really seemed to dislike most of the boys in our class. Apparently she swore under her breath at some kids. Well, this came back and bit her in the ass. One kid developed serious hearing problems, and she was required to wear a microphone that fed directly into his earpiece. When he came home spouting obscenities to his mother, she flipped her lid.

481,"Three robed men approach the clearing. Their crimson attire contrasts with the bleak forest, and each appears to glow with a dull aura which weakly illuminates the area. In the center sits a great stone slab. It is chipped and weatherbeaten, eroded by centuries of harsh rain, and seems to greedily absorb the already pitiful light there.

One figure approaches. He strides with purpose to the slab, and, in one quick motion, retrieves a stick of chalk from an unseen pocket. He clambers up onto the slab, lifting his wiry body with an unnatural strength, and proceeds to scrawl on its unyielding surface. Great circles he draws, inscribed with archaic runes and connected by a great pentagram. As he works, the other two begin to place small candles around the outside, symmetrically placed, lighting them as they go.

After several agonizing minutes, their work is complete. Silently, the two subordinates move back to pre-determined spots around the slab. The first draws from his belt a small pouch which pulses slightly, moving in a quietly unsettling rhythm. From it he draws a human heart, inexplicably still beating, and places it in the center of the circle. He steps back into his place in the formation.

Starting low and soft and growing in intensity, the trio begin to chant. The long-dead language sounds strange here, grating against the very nature of the earth around them. As the last words leave their lips, the heart erupts into a huge pillar of fire, stretching high into the sky. The two subordinates vainly shield their faces from the blinding light and blistering heat, but the third gazes with lustful eyes upon his work, taking in the terrifying spectacle with a crazed look upon his grizzled face.

As the flames recede and die down, a figure becomes visible. The heart is no more; in its place stands a massive hulking beast. It stands about nine feet tall, rippling with red muscle thinly covered in sheets of ragged, slick skin dripping with blood. It tests its weight on two powerful cloven hooves, and swivels its ram-skull head around to meet the gaze of its awe-stuck summoner.
“Master…” it says, its voice deep and guttural. “What is your bidding?”

The old man, snapping out of his reverie, pauses a moment to consider the query of his newest subject. “I could really go for a cappuccino right about now.”

560,"To lighten things up a tad: It was my sophomore year of high school and I was in biology. The class itself was pretty bad: the teacher, who taught a heavily evolutionary course, was a creationist, and I was sat in front of the biggest stoner in our grade, so it wasn't the most enjoyable thing I did that year. We were doing some activity in which the class was split into a few groups, each of the groups going to a certain station to complete an activity and rotating after a short while. I managed to get into a group with some friends. After a few rotations, we came to a lab table with a laptop on it. We completed the activity early (it was some online quiz, I think) and were sitting around talking. I, in all my 16-year-old maturity, decided to ""cage"" the laptop. (For those who've not yet been graced with this beautiful online addition, add the ""ncage"" extension to your Google Chrome. It turns literally every picture into a picture of Nic Cage. Every. Single. One.)

Well, turned out it was a student's laptop, briefly loaned for the exercise (our school had a laptop program so every student had one). She had no idea it was an extension and could simply be disabled through a few clicks, and went through some long ordeal with the computer technicians to fix it. They tried to get someone to confess, but my lips were sealed. They never caught me.

I had nothing against the girl, but the thought of those bitchy, passive-aggressive computer ladies perplexed by an overabundance of Cage it still hilarious to me.",2015-08-08 06:35:33+00:00,ctvpdul,1.0,t3_3g5p4g,43305.0,AskReddit

You can explore caves and the sky, unlock different NPCs who will sell you new items, and build redstone-like creations to slay your enemies or get you around faster.
