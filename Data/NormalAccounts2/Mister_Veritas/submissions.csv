After probably too long fucking about in the character creation screen, he's into the game, and we're giving him the best advice we can. For someone who doesn't do much gaming and has very little experience with an XBox controller, Jack doesn't absolutely suck. We're so proud. That is, until we get to Big Daddy Iudex Gundyr. He runs in, gung-ho, and gets soundly beaten down time after time. This is not terribly unusual for someone of his skill level (negligible), but upon further analysis, it seems half his R1's are translating into kicks. I am stunned. Neither I, who has done a decent amount of research into the mechanics of this game, nor my other friend, a Dark Souls veteran(ish), can do consistent kicks. Jack here is waving his boot unconvincingly at Gundyr with relative ease. Investigating his playstyle, I notice Jack is subconsciously nudging the left analog stick forward with each R1. And that, friends, is how I learned how to kick.",darksouls3,A learning experience,https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/4wunvo/a_learning_experience/

I had been summoned after putting my soapstone sign next to the bonfire and headed into the Chapel, to find a player who looked as if she was still in early game. We dueled for a bit, but although I am no PvP savant I still came out more or less on top. A particularly hard hit got her down to a tiny sliver of health. To my surprise, she walked back to the bonfire, turned towards me, and did the ""Toast"" emote. I waggled my sword in acknowledgement, but she just sat there. She conceded. Still unsure, I did a running R2 from a ways away to give her to time roll, but she sat there and died, unwilling to move or fight.
