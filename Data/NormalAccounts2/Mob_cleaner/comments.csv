58,"Basically, I had already been suspended twice, and with my mental disability the school felt that it had to step in and do something, and their approach was, and still is, ""punish him constantly until he learns how to be a normal person"" so I changed house (might be a Brit thing, but in my school there are six houses with 30 kids in them in each year, and you basically spend much of your time with them. I was moved to one where I knew about 3 people, and two are incredibly antisocial and slightly annoying)

I also lost my music scholarship, so instead of doing music, latin and history I only did latin and history, and I was moved down a set to make way for it.

I'm also constantly shadowed by ""Learning Support Assistants"",  which ranges from great teachers who are easy to get along with, to total fucknuts who are either:

* Completely negative with everything they say, and when you ask them to stop they'll tell you ""that's strike one"", and write a little sad face like I'm a fucking four year old.

* constantly talking in my face, telling me everything I have to do even when I'm doing it right as their speaking, then get annoyed *with me*, take my book from me and do all the rest of huge work themselves.

* get really close to me all the time egg sticking hands into my face! leaning over me! breathing onto me, and refusing to stop.

* all of the above. And worse.

Oh, and every single one sits right next to me.

Lunches are shit, since I know no one in my house anymore except the 2 silent, antisocial ones I always end up sitting with in a really awkward ritual of slicing our chicken, raising it to our jaws and munching it silently. Then be followed out by a ""Learning Support Assistant"" who's either negative/talkative/touchy/annoying etc.

And recently a chapter of my home life has (hopefully) ended, which was one of my worst experiences ever, and i don't even want to mention it.

Alright then. Considering Valencia was not always Novo Elefante, they might be easier to convince. I'll say 3 or lower converts the city for this reason. [[1d10]]

Greendew Camp, however, will be almost impossible to convert, as the citizens live in a country that hates foreigners (such as the Castriyan missionaries that will be going there), are at war with Castriya and their government is making it absolutely clear they will hunt and kill all Achintyans, meaning that the citizens will most likely not convert out of fear, and the Castriyan missionaries will not be allowed to speak out as loudly as they planned. For this reason, only a 1 will convert the city. [[1d20]]

Ramponea and Ivetria, however, will be reasonably likely to convert. a 7 or lower will swing the populace in favour of Achintya. [[2d10]]

There. Enjoy my new nation!

**Nation Name:** Huihang

**Leader Name:** Baomin Shen

**Lore:** Huihang is an ancient culture, being in existence for over thousands of years, although back then the inhabitants of Huihang were simple farmers, irrigating the land. The lands of Huihang were - and still are - divided into four different orders, although the other three accept Huihang as the most powerful. 

These nations dwell on top of the mountains of central Ma'at, between Cazador and Bulkhai, and live monastic lifestyles, although they are different to the monks you might know today. They believe that they are a Guardians of the Earth, and to protect the earth they must learn from an early age how to do combat, ninja-style. If they were to come across anyone digging up worms or anything to build a cinema there, they would combat the shit out of them (and that was a good reference, no matter what you say :P)

Despite this warrior lifestyle, the Four States of Huihang live completely monastic lives. No one is 'rich', they rarely fight, and they live together as a community. Because of this, the Four States do not war each other, and are instead reasonably fond of each other. In fact, every year at Summer all the people of Huihang would go to the capital to compete in mock battles, in honour of the Earth and their physical prowess. The Four States include:

**Huihang:** The most powerful state of them all, and where the powerful Baomin Shen resides. This state is where much of the international debates between the Four States. If you want to know about the Four States, Huihang is the first place you would go. Huihang is made up of two cities, Shan and Xingzhi, with Xingzhi being the capital of Huihang.

**Renzhe:** A more militaristic-focused state of the three, but are nevertheless focused on religious teaching over actually attacking. People from this state often win the physical games, but they remain very friendly to the other 3 states.

**Heshang:** Famous for it's grand Monastery of the Earth, a large building draped in beautiful fauna and natural decorations. This Monastery is considered the greatest holy site in all of Huihang, and because of it the people of Heshang are the most devout people as well. 

**Damai:** Usually considered the weaker of the four, Damai is only famed among the people for their exquisite cuisine. Radish and Barley Cakes freshly grown from the tops of mountains, the ingredients used really make travellers go to bed on a content stomach.

**Government:** Early Theocracy

**Agenda:** Pray to the Mother Earth and prove their prowess in combat to other nations.",2016-07-17 19:30:37+00:00,d5fxhw0,1.0,t3_4p7xi3,2228396.0,CivWorldPowers

678,"Well, considering all the factors, the city-state is very likely to be converted. I'll give it a 85% chance of winning, 10% chance of drawing (not too bad/not too good), and 5% chance of failure

**1-30**: Complete conversion. The Zhao people were more than happy to adopt the religion, so much so that they've built shrines and memorials in places where the founder used to reside. Also, now tied by faith, the Zhao people love the Divine Storm Tribe, send 100 gold to thank them for their religious services. Nice!

**31-45**: Complete conversion. Everyone bar a few are willing to adopt the religion, and now tied by religion relations with the Divine Storm Tribes improve dramatically, declaring that for the next 5 years they will remain your loyal allies, remaining loyal no matter how much gold someone gives.

**46-66**: Complete conversion. The populace of the city are incredibly appreciate of the religion arriving at their city, and accept it with open arms. Zhao now follows the religion of Aumwen.

**67-85**: Mostly converted. The populace mostly accepts the religion, enough for it to become a majority in the city. However, the better educated among the people reject the ways, and hate how it's become a majority of the city, so they claim that, officially, it's not the state religion, but individual fools cannot slow the progress of the might of Aumwen!

**86-95**: Half converted. Your priests weren't entirely convincing, and only half of the nation converted to your religion. Divided between Aumwenists and Atheists, the tension in the city grows. a roll will take place which group has more citizens, so as to decide if the religion is a majority. And, in the future, an internal conflict may arise from the situation.

**96-100**: Slight Conversion. The conversion attempt fails, with only a tenth of the citizens admitting themselves to Aumwen. Most of the rest of the citizens hate your priests' 'ridiculous' preaching, and so throw them out of the city. And, there's a chance that Zhao relations would've gotten sour enough for the alliance to be cancelled!

684,"Should be a very easy conversion, I'll give you odds of around 80%, with an additional 10% resulting in a draw.

1-20: There had already been many believers of Aumwen, and due to the lack of religion beforehand almost every citizen is converted. And, as a bonus, the citizens are willing to construct temples across the country, and as a result you will gain 5% extra money a year in tithes!

21-55: The priests were incredibly well taught, and after such long period of preparation easily convert all of Tetk'in. Aumwen is now the majority religion in all your cities.

56-80: After months of conversion, the priests felt sure that the citizens of Tetk'in would follow Aumwen without question. However, they left the cities isolated of further conversion, and over the months the religious hold on the city of Pasaj Yokib waned over the months, and have returned back to the ignorant existence they lived before.

81-95: The priests set out, with aims to convert all of Tetk'in, but the people dismissed this strange, foreign pantheon, and so only Tz'amtanak'al and Ch'ajal have embraced the religion. This division may split the country later on.

96-100: A terrible snowstorm forced the priests to stay inside the capital, and by the time spring came about the citizens of the country refused to believe that a messenger of a God be trapped for a whole winter, with some of the priests even dying in the cold. Only Tz'amtanak'al is converted, and even they are skeptic.

4: Inside a reasonably large hut he finds vast racks of sickle-like swords, and murals of warriors bearing these weapons to slice the heads of their enemies.

Secondly, I know that it can be hard to wedge yourself into a group of people at a school or something. People at school only really think about doing things that they think will make them cool, and if that's means talking the loudest or being the funniest, they'll do it. I've got aspergers and ADHD, so it's not been particularly... easy for me in social situations, because I ended up either overthinking things, staying almost completely quiet, or doing stupid things no-one else would do. However, I've managed to forget about it and just try to get on with the people who aren't dicks.

Remember, there are a lot of dicks in school (luckily not so many in my one, but still). When you get older people mature (mostly) and will learn who you are and accept you for it.

Over time, we conquered more and more neighbouring villages, but we were beginning to overstretch ourselves.

Or we could have them on an isolated island where it'll take a while for human and beast contact to occur.

So, let's say that two hundred years before the start of the game an extremely powerful warlock built a massive tower in the middle of the forest. Using all the power he can, he built a long-lasting magical barrier around his enchanted forest, where nothing magical can leave and nothing normal can enter (this could be broken eventually). He used his relative isolation to create many enchanted creatures, such as giants, witches and trolls, who created their own nations and created diplomatic relations between them. In this little part of the world, the Warlock watched on, pretty much a God in his forest. But, when the barrier collapses, can wands and witchcraft defeat cannon and gunpowder? Soon, we shall find out...

All eyes turned on him, for even without the attention he was bringing onto himself he was a sight these people were unused to. A large, rat-like tail protuded from his rear end, his hair, although on a rat's standard was very clean and well kept, was all over his body and graying. He the only clothes he wore was a light-grey garment around his legs (for grey is the national colour). And his claws and teeth were unmissable.

Slowly he walked to the side of the stands and called down onto the panting Edmund. The audience struggled to understand what he was saying, as Genadelose was not an expert in human tounge. He would lengthen the vowels and pronounce the hard constonents; ""Very impressive, Edmund Larderhoof. The result definitely did not reflect on your skill. The rules and techniques of your duel has intrigued me, care if I join in on a fight?""

And with that the ruler of Spardshock lept down on the floor below, and picked up two blades from the arena side. Edmund laughed and approached Genadelose. They shook hands before the fight, moved 4 paces apart and prepared to spar.

The 2 to 3 days after you stop watching porn will be incredibly difficult, as the dopamine in your head stops you from being 'happy'.

1097,"Alright, let's get this underway! The Spreadsheet says that the numbers are 39Lionans VS 54Orovgon, but Liona does have the surprise, so Orovgon will only have a slight advantage.

[[1d100]]

1-15: The Lionan ships catch the Orovgon navy unprepared, and by the time they realise the Lionans are coming it's too late. Most of the Orovgon fleet catches fire and sink under Lionan hails of arrows and catapults of fireballs, and the rest flee back to Orovgon.

16-45: The Lionan catch the Orovgon army with their pants down, and start launching fireballs towards the enemy. The Orovgon, battered and bruised, set up in their formation, but already a large chunk of their navy has been destroyed.

46-55: The Orovgon navy spy the Lionans sailing towards them, and order themselves into their battle formation. The Lionans start by shooting a volley of fireballs at the enemy, sinking several of their ships, until the Orovgon get up close to them. In close combat the Orovgon dominate slightly, making up for their losses before. The number of ships sunk are roughly even.

56-80: The Lionans do not catch the Orovgon off guard at all, and the massive bulk of the Orovgon navy sails right up to them and begin punishing them. The Orovgon navy are applying the pressure, not allowing the fireships to ram or set fire to ships efficiently.

81-100: The Orovgon were blessed with a very alert sailor who spotted the Lionans a mile off, and they easily get in position before they arrive. When they come the Orovgon quickly smash into them, carefully staying out of range from the dangerous ramming spikes, and very soon flank and surround the Lionans. Ship after ship is sunk, and the Lionans have almost completely lost hope in this battle.

45-70: The giant gang welcomes you, but aren't willing to help you. They prefer to stay in their caves and hovels. If you stay too long they won't like it.

71-85: The gang is suspicious of your attempts of diplomatic actions, and you begin to wonder what they would do if your soldiers weren't there. Might be best to leave them alone.

86-95: The gang openly expresses their distrust of you, beating their clubs against their shields. If you do not turn back they may turn vicious.

96-100: The gang shows their distrust of you, and begin insulting your exploration party. One of the runners takes offense of this and attacks and kills one of the gang members. Combat is inevitable, the only question is what formation you take up.

86-100: Coincidently, the spot you chose is a natural flamingo mating grounds. The flamingos will not leave their babies no matter what happens, as well as making them more aggressive than usual.

1291,"The admiral of the Oglivian fleet realises that if the Kievans land, the day is lost. In a last ditch attempt to regain the situation, the Oglivians sail right at the Kievans, to attempt to ram and board their ships before they land too many soldiers. The Kievans retain the same strategy.

[[1d100/u/rollme]]

0-20: The Oglivian's new strategy works very well, easily managing to punch through the Kievan's front ships and manage to board their transports, and easily slaughter them. The rest of the Kievan fleet flees, but they still have managed to land half of their army.

21-50: The warhsips of Kieva are smashed and boarded during a successful ram, but the transports still live and are landing more and more troops. Naval wise, however, the situation is back in control.

51-60: The Kievan ships take a battering, but board some of the ships succesfully and begin to regain the advantage. But even though they seem to do well, the Kievan army has almost completely landed now. Maybe with one more push we can kill those who haven't made it yet?

60-85: By being on the defensive the Kievans manage to sink several of the Oglivian ships before they even reach them. The Ogivians simply cannot reach them before being shot down with arrows. They do manage to batter and bruise some Kievan ships, but it's obvious that the Kievan sailors are far more superior.

85-90: The Oglivian navy sailed itself into a trap. As they sailed straight towards the enemy, they forgot they were sailing upwind, making their ships considerably slower. The Kievans nimbly duck out and surround the sluggish ships, bombarding them with several hails of arrows. If nothing is done the fleet will shatter quickly. It may be best to evacuate the fleet before all is lost.",2016-05-30 13:33:51+00:00,d3p4c0k,4.0,t1_d3oyqi5,17974.0,CivWorldPowers

31-55: As the Kievans sail around the enemy fleet in a staggered line, the Oglivians open fire. The Kievan frontal ships are lost, but the transport ships are still fine and are heading towards the shore to drop off the army. [[1d15/u/rollme]] Kievans are lost.

56-65: The Kievan staggered line is successful in holding off the enemy, but the Oglivians are managing to block the Kievans from landing on the shore. A stalemate is developing, but either side could attempt to adopt a new strategy to defeat the other. Both sides lose [[1d10/u/rollme]] ships.

1-20: The flanking ships quickly arrive to help out with the situation. Facing horrendous odds, the Stouffers are completely routed, but they will easily be mowed down by the military when they try to get out of the water. The port is now Oglivian.

21-55: The Oglivians decimate the Stouffers during the hand to hand combat, but [[1d5/u/rollme]] of the ships are set on fire, with only [[1d200/u/rollme]] Stouffers leaping off the boats in time, and only [[1d50/u/rollme]] Oglivians perishing. The port is easily Oglivian now.

56-75: During the combat phase, several Stouffer men, realising their imminent peril, set their own ships on fire in order to take the enemy down with them. All the Stouffer ships are ablaze, and all the Stouffer men are dead, but so are [[1d2000/u/rollme]] Oglivians who perish in the fire. The Oglivians have won, but at a heavy cost.

76-85: The Stouffers have adopted a fireship strategy, but strangely while they were still on the ships. [[1d1000/u/rollme]] of their sailors perish in the flames, but as they ram their ships into the Oglivian navy the fire spreads, killing [[1d1000/u/rollme]] Oglivians and setting several of their ships on fire. The battle has strangely stalemated, despite massive Oglivian pressure.

86-100: The Stouffer army are still filled with their resilience, and completely devastate 500 of the Oglivians who attempt to board their ships.

1360,"**Oglivia**: The military begins to check out the city and head towards it. The Oglivian navy faces up against the petty force of the Stouffer navy. the numbers are 43v17, and the numbers mean that the day should be won almost before they even start fighting.

1-20: The Oglivian ships devastate the Stouffer defenses. [[1d17/u/rollme]] ships are sunk, and the rest are overrun and captured with almost no losses. Their sailors are devastated.

21-55: The Oglivian sailors ram into the ships, sinking [[1d5/u/rollme]] ships. During the boarding stage is when the Stouffers are completely routed, with most of their men dying almost instantly and minimal losses on our part. Our ships are mostly fine, with a few needing minor repairs.

55-75: We are definitely pressing the advantage against the Stouffer navy. We have sunk one of their ships at the cost of one of ours, and are beginning the boarding stage, even though their sailors are proving particularly hard to defeat.

76-90: The battle is surprisingly stalemating, as the enemy sailors are fighting with all their spirit and patriotic zeal. Each nation has lost roughly the same amount of ships, with [[1d7/u/rollme]] lost on the Oglivian side and [[1d9/u/rollme]] on the Stouffer side. However, it's obvious that if we were to continue which side would waver first...

91-100: The Stouffer navy fight back with resilience almost unheard of in both nation's history. In a brave act of courage they duck and weave between the Oglivian ships, expertly sinking [[1d12/u/rollme]] Oglivian ships at the cost of [[1d8/u/rollme]] Stouffer ships being lost.

6-25: The natives are fully on board with a defense, and send all their female and male fighters to join the last-ditch defense of the island.

26-45: The elite male fighters are sent to join the cause against the foreign invaders. These powerful 100 man strong army should be very useful.

55-60: The natives plan to stay neutral, hopefully meaning they can stay in the good with whichever nation wins the war. Cowards!

61-70: The natives decide to side with the Oglivians, in an attempt to get in with the inevitable winners. Several women and men go to the port to meet the Oglivians with baskets of fruit in a declaration of friendship.

71-85: The natives have always been disgusted with the Stouffers, so any oppprtunity to destroy them is to be taken completely. The messenger is killed, and the elite soldiers of the natives join the Oglivians.

86-100: The natives are furious that the Stouffer even think that they could help them. After finding out that the Stouffer military is hidden in the forest, they kill the messenger, and send all their men to join the Oglivians. They will soon tell them of their position.

Strangely, a large smoke cloud can be seen in the distance. It shouldn't be a worry though. The first step was to entice the civilians to join the cause. What do they say?

1-10: A mixture of joy that they are liberated from the crushing taxes and fear from such a large army means that pretty much every civilian you meet joins you.

11-35: Many of the civilians join you, thinking your going to liberate them from the Gehfehrlich. some are distrusting of you, but they are far too few in number to stop you. The fools!

36-65: About half of the civilians join you, mostly due to fear about what you will do to them after you defeat their nation. The rest attempt to retreat into the smoking forests. Let's see how well that goes.

66-80: Only some join, and those are the biggest pussies in the towns. The civilians generally view your as oppressors, and are willing to die than join your cause to defeat their own nation.

81-100: Nobody joins your cause. Mylkthyns believe that patriotism comes before anything, even their very lives. In what they believe is a last ditch attempt they band together *against* you, if only to slow down your march.

56-75: The walls begin to take damage, but the archers on the walls are very efficient. With no cover to hide behind your troops begin to die. The losses are even.

76-95: The trebuchets aren't set up yet, so they could not fire. The archers, however, fire their bows open the enemy. A bowmen match begins, with the Mylkthyn garrison having the upper hand due to the cover they have.

96-100: Terrible news! Most of the archers have run out of ammunition by now, and the trebuchets need to be set up. As the troops are unsure as to what to do, the garrison fires upon your troops. Several hundred die, with only 1 or 2 Mylkthyn troops dying.

I'm doing a separate rollme for the swordsmen and keshiks, with the keshiks being decide after the outcome of this one.

0-18: Their shield wall, with the recent break from the side and the constant barrage from the bowmen, have far too many gaps in it to defend properly. The swordsmen completely overwhelm them, and pretty much every one of their men are killed.

19-50: The swordsmen take losses from the barrage of arrows hailing onto them as they charge, but the amount of losses they take means that they could not defend properly at all. Their shield wall is broken completely, and their archers are left entirely vulnerable to attack.

51-66: The amount of space between the Gehfehrlich and the Mylkthyn was quite far; in the time it took for the Gehfehrlich to traverse it a considerable portion of the horde died. When they arrive a melee begins between their swordsmen and yours, with you still managing to get an upper hand over them. If you continue the attack, their swordsmen should fall.

67-90: Their archers were barely hit at all by your barrage, therefore the hail of arrows onto your men as they charge is considerable. Many of them fall to the ground, and when they reach the enemy they certainly have the disadvantage against them. This battle is slipping out of your control!

91-100: The trebuchets did not have enough time to set up, and your archers proved themselves inexperienced under pressure. Barely any of their men died, and as a result your swordsmen are met with a volley of arrows as they charge. Many of the men are struck down, and those alive are forced to turn around and rebuild a much smaller shield wall. The attack was a failure, and the keshiks receive no help.

What are the results of the keshik pincer movement?

0-25: The archers couldn't kill enough of them to cut the effectiveness of the attack. Since pikes aren't a thing yet, and no spears were used, the horde easily shoots down most of their army within minutes. Their shield wall collapses, and realising defeat is inevitable the men begin to flee.

26-55: The archers quickly shift their attack onto the keshiks, but they still managed to get round their flanks and begin dealing serious damage to their archer units. Their archers are now shooting at the horses, so that frees up the rest of your army.

56-70: One of the flanks does make significant headway into their forces, but the other flank is running into problems; their horses are becoming terrified by the fires, and aren't doing what they're telling them to. In the panic, those keshiks begin to dwindle in numbers. 

71-90: The enemy swordsmen from each side of the shield break off to form a new defensive wall on either side, blocking off some of the keshik arrows while the archers fire back. Their archer's attention, however, is diverted between the horses and the main army.

91-100: A bugle is blown, and the enemy swordsmen break off from each side, and begin forcing the keshiks into the fires behind them. Both flanks are pinned in, with an inpenetrable shield wall in front of them and an unstoppable fire wall behind them. If something isn't done all the keshiks could be lost in one swoop!

The Mylkthyn troops will definitely be exposed, but the fire, if left uncontrolled, could burn down the entire jungle. For now though, let's see what happens with the Mylkthyn troops:

0-15: Terrified by the fire and prospect of being burnt alive, the troops scatter in all directions. Only a thousand man army remains, and should be simple to defeat. The scattered troops may resort to guerilla warfare in the future, however.

16-40: Knowing they could not win in open combat, the Mylkthyn troops curse the fire and retreat back to the forts. The way ahead lies open.

41-45: As soon as their position was revealed, the Mlkthyn troops charge at the horde, hoping to do as much damage as possible with such abismal odds.

51-70: The troops drop down from the trees, and form a massive shield wall with as many men as they could. The archers at the back begin firing upon your troops.

71-85: The troops retreat roughly one mile back, then build a last defense on top of a hill. You must go through or by them in order to get to their main cities.

86-100: Filled with anger that their forest is being burned down, all the Mylkthyn troops drop down upon only metres away from your men. They will fight until the last breath has been drawn from their bodies.

[[1d100/u/rollme]]

Also, to find out how many soldiers died in the fire. We'll do it out of 1000 from each side, since the Mylkthyn were hiding in the forest that was burning at this moment, but the Gehfehrlich ad more people that could possibly have died.

1710,"So the Mylkthyn lie in wait by a large marsh, one that the Gehfehrlich are likely to reach. It will take a while for them to arrive, due to the rough terrain, but when they do the victor will almost certainly be decided.

Firstly, we muct find out how many people from each army died to disease, dysentry and wild animals. Ultimately Mylkthyn should lose less, due to knowing these lands and being a lower amount of men, and the Horde are using horses, which are likely to get caught in the mud.

The amount of Gehfehrlich that died before battle: [[1d2000/u/rollme]]

1711,"Alright then, sorry for doing this late, I had to go somewhere. With this information, Does Mylkthyn decide to launch a counter-attack?

1-15: The Horde's army is far superior to their one, so many believe they are doomed. Half of the army surrenders as soon as this news arrives, lest they anger their soon-to-be overlords. The rest are demoralized by this.

16-75: They know their forests and valleys - it would be wiser to have this fight in lands they know and ones that the Horde are unused to. By waiting at boggy marhses and swamps that the Gehfehrlich Horde are likely to pash, places that calvary would be completely useless, and people would find it much harder to move as they tried traversing the swamp.

76-90: They will charge into enemy lands, for they know that since they are likely to die, they should attempt to do as much damage as possible by striking at their heart. For the Glory!

91-100: They decide on using a round-about route to get right round the invading army. They will attack whatever countryside they come across, and when they arrive at the enemy army bogged down in their marshes, they will pounce on them and kill as many as possible.

1714,"Alright then, I've done some calculations, and Mylkthyn have 3,000 swordsmen, 3,055 composite bowmen and 400 elite soldiers. Obviously they are undermanned, but with very good tactics and a lot of luck they could gain an advantage. Firstly, let us find out how much each side knows:

---

1-10: The Gefehrlich horde has learnt of a secret courseway in the forests of Mylkthyn, which would lead them right around the enemy soldiers!

11-60: They have learnt the enemies exact numbers, and roughly where they plan to be located. This war will be easy!

61-75: They know roughly what they are up against, but believe they are being led by an exceedingly good general. Maybe if they leave the fighting for 2 more weeks they'll realize what they are fighting?

76-95: The Gehfehrlich horde's knowledge of the enemy is very limited; they will have to improvise their attack.

96-100: Not only does the Gehfehrlich army know nothing about the enemy, but there's also been a rumour spread by enemy spies that they also have a similarly sized army to ours. This does not look good for morale!

---

And now, what Mylkthyn knows (btw, if the fist roll is in fact between 96-100, then they obviously have spies in your territory, so 60 points will be added to the second roll unless it's already above 60)

---

1-5: Mylkthyn not only doesn't know anything about the incoming invasion, but they also have angered their spies so much that they are defecting! They will soon reach the Gehfehrlich horde with valuable intel.

6-45: The Mylkthyn know nothing of this attack, they believe that the Gehfehrlich would not dare attack them or else risk lowering international opinion.

46-60: The Mylkthyn have heard of rumours that they could possibly be attacked, but their military does not believe it, believing that the horde must be thousands of miles away.

61-70: Several spies have reported an attack, but only half of the army is mobilizing. The other half is led by a general who does not believe the attack is actually going to happen.

71-80: Mylkthyn has always been wary of a surprise attack from such a warmongering neighbour, so they have always had a large portion of they're army camped on the border. However, they do not know of the attack.

81-95: Mylkthyn has always been wary of a surprise attack from such a warmongering neighbour, so they have always had a large portion of they're army camped on the border. They are also very aware of the attack, so they're army, no matter how limited, is ready for war.

96-100: Suprisingly, the reason why they launched their own attack was because they knew everything about the Gehfehrlich attack and decided to take matters in they're own hands. They're launching a sneak attack which the horde has no idea about, using hidden course ways they know about deep in the forest. This does not look good!

1. I'm good with this, although doesn't that mean if one economy crashes then everyone else will suffer?

My reasoning for this is that I currently don't have full control over my citizens, and they are liable to eat anything they see. So it's not because I don't want you guys in, it's because I don't want to be accused of having all your people killed.

3. I would like to exempt from the first point, for the same reasons as above. It will probably not be good if your armies train with mine, expecially for you.

Name: Tagaarchek Nomadic Empire/ Khanate

Leader: Fhegüghin Majyarek

Lore: The Tagaarchek tribe had humble beginnings in the great, snowy steppes of the east raidings merchant settlements and other nomadic tribes. After pillaging an agricultural settlement in the south, the secrets to growing sustainable food was far more valuable and manageable than raids and dependancy on attacks. Upon settling in the humble village of Hägarfin, the Taagarcheks were instantly targeted by five surrounding tribes. After a series of large-scale sieges and clashes of bloodshed, the Taagarcheks remained, but their infrastructure was badly damaged due to the war. After rebuilding their agriculture and government, the Taagarcheks (or Taagars for short) are known for their prominent horse-culture, agriculture, honor but are infamous for their warmongering, heretic shamanic followings of Tengriism and lack of order. 

Color: Dark maroon.

Location: Between the Suon Wasteland and the Erian Peninsula, stretching down until meeting the axis revolution. Or if it is randomly chosen, a location in which a tundra meets a plains with plenty of hills.

Additional facts: The khanate has a strong, cavalry-centered military with plenty of horse archery and lancing, but stable yet stale agriculture and order.

86-95: The natives fight back, and the nobles living in these lands sport some sort of army. 2,000 of your men are killed. But the nobles are defeated and their men flee south, plotting their return.

I am in favour of building a city for both of us, preferably close to the mountains where my people will be working. You live above ground, we live below. And we need to find a way to make sure my men don't eat you.

My citizens are used to the underground, and have so grown to be very good miners. However, it does seem that 30% is a little low considering we're providing a workforce for you. Could I suggest the following terms?

We give you:

* A large workforce of miners to obtain gems, marble and ores during peacetime.

* A military to protect you during wartime.

You give us:

* 30% of profits (I don't need too much money)

* Extra fish in return for the low percentage of share, to supply my people. This is on top of the food we negotiated beforehand.

* Your backing if we decide to expand northwards.

The rest of the 1,000 Overlende soldiers a killed easily, but Overlende just about manages to close the walls in time. The Ziet archers begin to fire.

0-35: The Overlende archers hide behind their walls, so they are mostly unaffected by the attack. They do, however, manage to kill 2,500 Ziet soldiers on the return fire.

36-50: The Overlende archers, anticipating a surprise attack after noticing the effectiveness of the horsemen, decided to man the walls beforehand. They were ready for the attack, and during the arrow fight they come up on top, only losing 1,000 to the Ziet 3,000

51-90: There were only a couple hundred archers on the wall. Unsuspecting of an attack, they are all picked off easily. There are still people left on the walls, but it would be harder to attack.

91-100: The Ziet archers are just as powerful as their horsemen. They easily shoot down every single man on the walls, and only take a couple hundred casualties. The only defenders left are now inside the city

1-75: The horsemen are dispatched easily, with not too many casualties on the Overlende front.

76-85: The horsemen kill a hundred Overlende soldiers, but most of them are dead now.

86-95: The Overlende soldiers are suprised by the effectiveness of the Horsemen, and so they are torn down easily. 500 are killed now, and only half of the horsemen lie dead.

96-100: The Overlende soldiers that were sent out were new recruitments. Suprised by the skill of the supposed 'raiding party', the Overlende soldiers are devasted, with only 4 of the horsemen dead. The rest of the Overlend soldiers attempt to flee back into the city, leaving the gates wide open.

0-50: They think it is just a normal raiding party and send out a thousand men to deal with it

51-70: They think they are a raiding party from Ziet, and so, knowing how powerful they are, send out 5,000 troops instead.

71-95: They shoot down onto the 25 horsemen with arrows

96-100: A scout reports to Overlende about the Ziet army, and so they are fully aware. They reinforce their gate and man the walls.

Greetings, most powerful Mob Khan, ruler of the glorious steppes of Siberia. For many years your Hakka Riders dominated North Asia, bringing about a glorious new age for Siberia. Our nation rose up from the ashes of North Asia, and was quickly subjugated and starved of land. However, the fire of the people never wavered, as we won war after war, battle after battle, until we became the ever righteous rulers of North Asia, casting out all the foreigners that dared touch our sacred land.

Oh glorious leader, your people's pleas are heard once more, calling you to raise them to victory and claim the steppes as our own. Will you rekindle the fires of Asia, and build an empire unparalleled by any before it? Will you build a nation that will stand the test of time?",2016-04-01 08:12:32+00:00,d1lk5aj,,t1_d1l1nhj,,CHGMods

* Many people wished to create their empires as a democracy. I know that it is very unrealistic, but I'm not stopping people just because their nation is a democracy. 

* /u/TheSlimeXY named his leader Eric von Nottenheim. I won't change it unless he wants to change it.

* Again, that's not in my capabilities to change. People call their nations modern names, and so I cannot change them.

I think we're both looking at it the wrong way. Perhaps instead of changing people's nations, we should change the lore behind the nations. Remember that all these people originated from a very futuristic civilistation, and so maybe they've managed to preserve modern ideas during the Ice Age?

Carruita is right on the tip of the Ugric sea.

My nation is actually on the remains of Spardshock. If you look on the political map it's called 'Spardshock' (such originality).

2693,"Sorry for such a late reply. I'll tell you what's happened since the start.

The first big thing that happened is that we took over the ERC. Lurking, like the coward he was, surrendered all his lands to us, save for Venice, which went to SHADE, and Dvin which went to Mallock. We then invaded Dvin, killed Mallock (or so I thought) and attacked SHADE so that I could burn Venice to the ground. 

The war with SHADE amounted to nothing, with no side being able to get an advantage. We then formed the Glorious League with the Don, Mongol Khalasar and Funland, and together we attacked the Bearpunchers (at this point the Don also ruled the Grand Alliance). While we got some gains, the Don and the Mongols were less lucky. Reformer and Lungora got married, and fr the rest of the story in detail you can read my Speak of the Devil series.

Killing people for fun is the best type of killing. We are called Funland, after all.

exactly. Thank you for pointing out how evil he is for me.

&gt; he had to in order to stop you because you were killing people

Funny, isn't it? If he didn't try to stop me, I wouldn't have hated him so much, and therefore no (or less) genocide. So he could've stopped this by not stopping this.

&gt; But then you get mauled by a bear and die because everybody hates you so much at that point that even the Bearpunchers side with the bears against you. Yes it's that bad.

Ludicolo...

I AM A FUCKING GOD!

my whole reign I've dealt with the scum of the ERC shits

But now my work is for naught, simply because they are allowed to breed in countries I can't control.

I will control them soon.

But you have always backed my nation.

You've never let me down.

Yet.

Ludicolo, Unlike you I have seen this world. No-one in it is happy, and that I is the one thing I can't stand.

But if we were to join forces, imagine what we could do?

Power changes people, Ludi. I cannot go back.

I need to hunt down all of Lurking's legacy, which I cannot do on my own. If we were to help each other, we could finally end the true evil of this world.

Think about this. Who has helped you since birth?

Who was there at Gateon's founding?

Who believed in you, when other's shook their heads?

I did, not any of the scum of this world.

So this is going to be a polandball series I'm thinking about doing. It will be an elimination style thing, but I've thought of many themes that I would like to propose to you, and you can vote in the strawpoll which one you like the most:

* **WWE style cage match**: This will have all the civballs in a WWE style cage match, with the last one not KO'd wins. It will be one, long album, and eliminations will happen one at a time.

* **Hunger Games/Battle Royale**: All the civs are put in an arena, and the last one alive wins. It will be around twenty albums of around 30-40 pictures, and they'll be one elimination per part.

* **Hypothetical Wars**: Hypothesises what a war would be like if it happened. There can be as many parts as I'm bothered to do, and each part will involve a random war with one side coming out on top.

You can also use the SDK to play a gamemode I call Rising Tides (I know, I know, but it's the only thing I got). Every 25-50 turns you go into the SDK and:

* Turn all coast by the ocean into ocean

* Turn all flat terrain by the coast into coast

* Turn all hills by the coast into flat terrain

* Turn all mountains by the coast into flat terrain

* Any cities on flat terrain by the coast is flooded and removed. If a capital is removed then place a palace inside their most populous city remaining. If no cities a left, then it's game over.

Enjoy!

Since it's a test run though, we could maybe test the idea that when someone buys some mercs, those units go to where they are needed the turn later. For the pricing, see below:

Let's say the ERC want to purchase 1 Comp Bowman. In civ 5, to purchase 1 Comp Bowman costs 320 gold, but people would not buy them at that price from you because they could buy one for the same price for them to keep forever, not for a war. So my suggestion is to put them up for hire at maybe 75-80% of the costs, which would be 240-256. This sound good?

Base Civ: Persia

Colours: Yellow and Pink

Leader: Mob the Glorious

Leader/ Civ icon: dunno yet

UA: One Thousand Smiles - +2 happiness for garrisoned units. Great works of propaganda add combat strength to melee units.

UU: Tickle Monster - Morbidly kills it's enemies through excessive tickling. 20% stronger, and also gives whatever unit it hits the Laughing promotion (-40% strength for one turn). Does not require horses, unlike the lancer it replaces.

UB: Clown College - replaces the University. On top of the normal bonuses from universities, Clown Colleges provide Great Musician/Artist/Writer points dependant on happiness (the more happiness, the more points).

5645,"The Dictatorship of Funland is one of the newest factions in the realm, but certainly not one with the smaller history. It's roots run deep into the annals of history, beginning the same time as the Party Pals, for that is where Funland emerged. /u/Mob_cleaner was on board the ship that the Party Pals took, and experienced it's crash. And, like the rest of the men on that ship, he settled down in Gateon Port.

But trouble began when /u/Mob_cleaner began to grow restless. He was one of the more fanatical people in that faction about happiness, and he sometimes found people depressed in Gateon Port. Against all his ethics, /u/Mob_cleaner was enraged, and left the city in search of a happier future.

But in the other factions it was worse. Violence and mayhem was lurking behind every corner, especially in the Isles of Rum. Mob could not handle it. Finally he cracked, and when he found the nearest village he could he entered it, proclaimed he was now leader, and built a wall around the village so no one could leave. Although it was a small wall, it stopped them leaving and they began listening to his every order. Anyone not happy would be shot, and happy birthday would be played at their funeral. Within months his circle of influence grew, until he was classified as one of the 20 competitors on the world stage. Due to his roots with the Party Pals, they maintain close relationships, but he will never forget the sadness he saw in the men of the other factions.

5647,"Some ideas I've come up with for uniques for your civ. Hope you enjoy these.

UA: Since this faction is about parties, I think the best UA would be revolved around golden ages, but instead of golden ages they are legendary parties that'll be remembered forever. So my suggestion is that during golden ages either all cities enter 'we love the king day' or citizens actually provide happiness for 5-10 turns after the end of the golden age, or both.

UU: Since this faction is not interested in fighting wars, I think a UU that maybe has bonuses non-war related, but can be used often is ideal. Therefore, maybe either a scout replacement (because they stay around most of the game) that requires no maintenance and increases relations with other civs when next to their borders, or a Great Muscian that provides double culture when during a golden age.

UU/UB/UI: since this civ isn't militaristic, you probably don't need two UUs (unless you got an idea or want to use both ideas stated above), so here are some ideas I'm running out of my head for UBs and UIs:

* UI - Theme Park (I would suggest Architecture needed) - Provides +1 gold and +2 happiness. Bonus increases to +3 gold and +3 happiness if next to wine/sugar/Cocoa. Cannot be built 4 tiles close to another Theme Park.

* UB - Party House (Replaces Opera House) - removes the culture bonus, but Provides +0.5 happiness per citizen in city.

* UB - Party God Shrine/Temple (Replaces shrine/temple depending) -
1 Happiness provides +1 faith in this city.

Anyway, I dont come from Party Pals, but as an ally I wanted to share some ideas with you.

5718,"thank you! Maybe to deal with the amount of rebellions these rules below could be put in place, or some variant of it?

There could be three different types of rebellion; **Rebellion**, **Civil War** and **Independence War**, each rebel group having a different goal dependant on the type of war.

**Rebellions** are when the population of a civ want to change something about the way it is run. They can occur if the nation is unhappy, over-expanded, has a weak infrastructure or running on severe debt. Rebellion uprisings have no cities, but a decent amount of low level units. They are at war with the nation they are rebelling against, and when they make peace they go away.

**Civil Wars** can occur when the leader of the faction has proven to be weak, deceitful or a pain in the ass. When a civil war is declared, up to half of the empire's cities could go to the Civil Resistance group, and the rest goes to the Royalists. War will go on as normal between them, but peace is not allowed and the war must end with one of the teams victorious over the other.

**Independence Wars** can occur when a city (or cities) that used to belong to another civilisation rise up to claim independence from their overlords. All cities in the empire of the overlord that was originally founded by the rebelling nation will convert to their original nation, but they won't have too many units and may rely on the alliance of another civ. The war will continue as normal, and whatever lands the independence seeking nation has by the time the war is over they get to keep, so it is basically a normal war. If the independence war is lost, then the same type of war cannot be declared for another 50 turns.

Tell me any changes you think could be made to this list, or if you think no changes should be made and it's good. Thanks for reading!",2015-11-28 19:39:20+00:00,cxfz5lv,3.0,t1_cxfybmi,1451.0,CBRBattleRoyale

5776,"Well, I have Asperger Syndrome and I found out when I was eleven. Luckily for me though I had a lot of help from my school, my parents and my local authority, so I managed to stop myself from doing dickish stuff too often. So maybe what you could do is teach the life lessons you learned to this kid, because I know learning you have Asperger syndrome at a young age could actually help, because then you learn how to live with it before you become an adult.

I also feel that people with Asperger's really love compliments that mean a lot to them. For example, I was playing TF2 one day, and when I left the server a person told me that I was a very good medic, and I didn't stop thinking about it for the rest of the day. So you could also try that.

One last thing that I thought of, is that it might help to find one thing that this guy really loves and help him become better at what he loves. I personally like rapping and beat boxing, and whenever I feel pretty shit I just write some lyrics. So if you find something he's very passionate about, and remind him how good he is at it, he'll appreciate that way more than you think.",2015-11-14 19:59:47+00:00,cx06w52,4.0,t1_cx01zl0,9335.0,civbattleroyale

I don't know the guy in person, but I feel that if someone you care about is really struggling, it's almost impossible to not detach yourself to try and help them, but you should try and get to their level and help them realise that you really care about them.

Chile vs Argentina
Inca vs Brazil
Mayans vs Buccaneers
Mexico vs Texas
Canada vs America
Blackfoot vs Sioux
Inuit vs Iceland (lets see who raps coldest)
Ireland vs England
Norway vs Sweden
France vs Portugal
Germany vs Rome
Poland vs Finland
Sparta vs Byzantium
USSR vs Huns
Israel vs Ayyubids (Battle of religions!)
Carthage vs Morocco
Mali vs Ashanti
Kongo vs Ethiopia
Boers vs Zulu
Armenia vs Persia
Timurids vs Afghanistan
Mughals vs Sri Lanka
Sibir vs Yakutia
Mongolia vs Tibet
Korea vs Japan
China vs Vietnam
Burma vs Champa
Philipines vs Indonesia
Kimberly vs Australia
Maori vs Hawaii

This will probably be the first round battles, and since there are an odd number of nations, Arabia will probably be the one to get a by.
