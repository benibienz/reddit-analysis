Endless darkness, swirling and swooping and howling around him, struck his corpse and bit his feet. The God had laid like this for a hundred years, and many on earth did not expect him to return. That, or they hoped he didn't.

---

*Mob stared Lurking in the eyes. He saw the hate and disgust radiating back out him, the absolute loathing that filled every crevice in his heart. Mallock's cry of pain could be heard, meaning Lurking had immobilised him for now. The thunder and lighting of warfare rumbled around the palace, defeating any sort of thought process. But Mob could process one thing. And that was the fact that everyone here wanted him dead.*

---

The earth shook. The weeds that for so long had choked the life out of this titan began to recoil, and slowly but surely, like the essence of millions of Polish workers gathered together, the corpse reconstructed and reformed. But this was unlike anything the plebeians on that rock had seen before. This was the final vengeance of Mob. And he was beginning to stir.

---

*Een was informed that the coalition would arrive any day now, but the powerful leader knew victory would be swift and efficient. The Polish town of Lovovov lay in ruin, and it's civilians eaten alive. The military of Spardshock had been trained with extreme profession, and a deal with Rema and the Sect stated that they would bring 13,000 troops in to aid Een's armies. And if all that failed, Operation Bulbo would commence. A Spardshockian named Bulbo had recently been purposefully infected with a zombie-like strain, and the results was devastating. If Spardshock couldn't conquer the world before, the world will need to prepare now...*

---

An eye flickered. Slowly the god awoke, shaking off the last of the vines and plastering the last crevice. Then, he looked up. Billions of stars scattered the sky, each clammering to be seen and appreciated more than his neighbours. Then he saw the moon, the hulking, sleepy force that cast it's shadow on all those stars. Whenever it wanted it could wake up and silence those insolent blots forever. And thinking about this made Mob remember who he was, and what he will be. And what he will do.

---

*Mob sat with his fellow leaders. Shandorin, the leader most known for his unshifting worship of radiation. The various American Congressmen, who seeked to wipe out the cultures of the rest of the Old World. And those people in Australia who did so little Mob has forgotten their leader's name. The EU Politburo was not present, but that was for obvious reasons. The men had gathered in a War Council, and we're discussing the potential of wiping out the entire EU, with a weapon so destructive even The Lord in Antarctica feared for his life. Even though these men were evil, Mob led the most heated arguments against the Politburo. He would not rest until either Paris lay in ashes, or Siberia would return to the instable war zone it was before the Schism. Mob took a deep breath. The decision was made.*

---

Slowly the dawn light invaded the earth, and the stars shrank away. Mob looked down and saw a valley that stretched across the horizon, from mountain to mountain. Mob bent down and touched grass. The soft dew sent pulses of life shooting through the sinews that kept him alive. Throughout the process of Awakening he remembered the people he was, the times when he was younger and weaker. Now, however, he had aged. Men had gathered before him, migrating from towns and villages and hamlets to gaze up the the god. One by one they knelt down to Mob. The god sensed the thousands of stars before him, giving their light to the moon. And he knew there were thousands more stars left. And one by one, their light would go out.",CivWorldPowers,Milis Mobkraan,https://www.reddit.com/r/CivWorldPowers/comments/5bcofc/milis_mobkraan/

But for now, the land was still.

Many years had past, and many incarnations had succumbed to disasters that lay beyond the fourth wall, in a realm known as 'real life'. A strange concept, I know. Some claim that he had to fight hordes of immortal legions there, only by himself as retribution for what he brought upon this world. Some say he exiled himself to find his true motive and meditate on his life. And some fucking retards say he had 'homework' and 'exams' and 'a stressful life'. But don't listen to those guys. They probably get zero pussy.

However, now was the moment. The earth remained still for too long. Nations grow too tall, and search for more land to sprawl into and  infect with their bacteria-like colonies, sometimes even fighting their own brothers for claims upon this rock of a planet. Not like I've ever been guilty of that.

And now that the new world had been discovered, the very embodiment of fear and thunder would return. Not as a joyful dictator, not as a post-apocalyptic rat overlord, not even as a ruthless elephant-worshiping Inuit. This will be the time he brings his true form to this world.

In January, a robot was taught to play Go, an incredibly complex game, and managed to beat a grandmaster five games in a row ([link here](https://www.wired.com/2016/01/in-a-huge-breakthrough-googles-ai-beats-a-top-player-at-the-game-of-go/)). If you're too lazy to open the link, the way they achieved this was first inputting about 30 million moves into the robot played by a variety of experts, and then allowing the AI to teach itself how to beat that strategy, and how to beat that one, until it had a vast range of strategies to go on, and thus being able to beat even the greatest player in the world. This, in a nutshell, is what 'deep learning' means.

So, shouldn't this be possible with civ? If Firaxis gathered millions of moves professional players have made, and then creates an AI to come up with a strategy to beat those moves, and beat those ones, and over time it would have a much more 'human-like' response to things. For example, maybe the first 10 times the AI plays a game it embarks all it's land units into the ocean to reach an enemy city. Once it realises that this strategy results in it's units dying, and subsequently losing their defence and getting invaded, it will rethink the strategy until one fateful day the land unites *actually stay on land* (crazy, I know).

Obviously I'm no expert, but obviously neither is the civ AI, and I made this post in the hopes that maybe it could create a game where AIs could potentially not only make moves like a human, but then mould it's strategy to make it even better than one. And once that's done, we can have a Deity level AI that actually knows that a melee unit is needed to conquer a city, and one that won't need a gazillion bonuses to even keep up with a professional human player.",civ,"I'm not an expert, but maybe something like this could help improve the AI?",https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/5a2o8b/im_not_an_expert_but_maybe_something_like_this/

This is a list of every country in the world where children go to school when they are less than 4. Yet, [according to this map](https://iq-research.info/en/page/average-iq-by-country), there does not seem to be any obvious correlation between starting school earlier and being smarter. Getting a headstart doesn't help you at all.

Also, have you seen a 4 year old? Do you honestly think 4 is a good age to send children to a school environment, where it's likely they've never been away from their parents for a long time at all. You think a 4 year old can be dumped into 5 days a week at school, where they have to follow a regime and stay away from their parents and with people they don't even know? Who's idea even was this?

at 4 years old, the gap between the smartest and dumbest child is considerable. You got children who can read books and write out the alphabet, and some children will still be wearing nappies. If you are a parent and you think that sending your child later to school is bad for their progress, teach them yourself! Or better yet, let them stay at nursery or - as the Americans call it - ""pre-school"".

You think a 4 year old can go to school and strike up a conversation easily? They've got barely any social skills! Some of them can barely speak, and you want them to learn who Shakespeare is or teach them their multiplication tables? Why don't you start school when they actually do know how to speak, let alone read and write? You think they won't be scared those first 2 years? They're going to be taken away from their parents every day, forced to do work and talk with children they don't know.

I'll end this post with my final source - [English children are among the unhappiest and stressed in the world, just behind South Korea](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-33984082). Notice that in the survey the 4 other countries where children start school under the age of 5 aren't included, but South Korea came last out of 15 countries, and SK is a nation that focuses heavily on increasing child education, forcing out policies that make it more and more mandatory for children to spend much of their time at school. Among the highest rated ones are Romania, Colombia and Israel, vastly contrasting with South Korea, and yet their youths are far happier.

I was moved to one where I knew about 3 people, and two are incredibly antisocial and slightly annoying)

I also lost my music scholarship, so instead of doing music, latin and history I only did latin and history, and I was moved down a set to make way for it.

I'm also constantly shadowed by ""Learning Support Assistants"",  which ranges from great teachers who are easy to get along with, to total fucknuts who are either:

* Completely negative with everything they say, and when you ask them to stop they'll tell you ""that's strike one"", and write a little sad face like I'm a fucking four year old.

* constantly talking in my face, telling me everything I have to do even when I'm doing it right as their speaking, then get annoyed *with me*, take my book from me and do all the rest of huge work themselves.

* get really close to me all the time egg sticking hands into my face, leaning over me, breathing onto me, and refusing to stop.

If you wish to join the nation, be prepared to follow the rules of the state, rules written be the Supreme Leader Mob the Glorious himself!:

* Anyone not seen smiling or laughing can be arrested on sight

* Each house within the borders of Funland must have a minimum of 5 balloons on it at any given time.

* Each citizen over the age of 21 must have a PhD in Clown Comedics , Tomfoolery, Balloon Making or Bouncy Castle Enthusiast. 

* Each post or discussion must end with the phrase 'Glory to the Hilarious Empire of Funland!'. Not having an exclamation at the end could be punishable by death or imprisonment.

* If the Empire is not the the happiest nation in the world, 1 in every 10 people will be executed.

If you have committed a crime punishable by death, the most common form of execution is to be fed to the grizzly Tickle Monster.

If a particular citizen has been loyal and extremely happy, I may be inclined to promote you to mayor of a certain town, but if I find your populace are below the national happiness level, I will send you back to Clown College to re-educate you. If your lucky.

This is a revelation, for the religion of Optimism has been born. It's entire premise is too long for a mere ""reddit post"", so I will first teach you of the important details:

1. Optimism is all about happiness, or as followers call it, eudemonia (you-die-moania, but meaning the opposite). Smiling is the most acceptable way of living, and if someone has shown you kindness, smiling is the ultimate thanks.

2. Miror has bestowed upon me the knowledge of how worship should be run, in a special ceremony known as 'parties'. Groups of friends, family, strangers and foreigners gather for the spiritual celebration of life, and to thank Miror for all the happiness bestowed upon us. And obviously, the best way to thank Miror for happiness is to show happiness through entertainment and laughter.

3. Frowning is frowned upon. If a follower is caught frowning/moaning/crying/depressed etc. then he is liable to be punished through several hours/days of exile from the community, dependant of how severe his sin was.

4. Eudemonia doesn't only mean personal happiness, but happiness for all the community.

I will be travelling the world to share this religion. If you have any questions, or wish me to visit you, then ask in the ""comments"".

Plotting against other nations, waiting anxiously for the part to come out, and when the parts stopped coming out, we were so engrossed in the story that the OC continued for months afterwards.

I'm making this post now for all you who miss that. I've become a lot less active now that it feels like the fun of the CBRBR has run out, and I'm sure many of you would want to revive it. Let's wipe the current Mk. II (it's fine if you want to keep the civ, however), and recreate the joy we had almost a year ago.

My pillow has been pushing my head forwards so that my neck feels like it belongs to a 500-ton junkie, and I'm feeling more and more like I'm being trapped in my room. I've barely moved all day, to the point where my pyjamas begin to feel like a second layer of my skin, and I'm getting that weird smell that you get when you binge-watch movies all day on Netflix. Every time I move, I get a massive headache, and I have an overall feeling that I've wasted a whole day of my life. It wasn't an easy decision, but as I was watching a YouTube video I had an urge to fap, maybe as a way to feel a bit better about myself. I did something I didn't expect to do…

I made a change.

I got out of my bed and left my room like one of those fat people at the end of Wall-E. I took a massive cold shower, then put on some new clothes and stepped out of my house, hoodie on and shoes laced up tight (I took a risk today and didn't wear Velcro, cause I'm all about change!) From now on, I'm going to be different. Maybe I'll go cycling today, maybe tomorrow I'll finally start planning that book I've always thought about writing. Perhaps on the weekend I'll start a YouTube channel dedicated to rapping (because that's one of my biggest hobbies), and I'll start spending more time on schoolwork and less time on playing video games, watching YouTube and fapping. Because, at the end of the day, I've only got one shot, and I certainly not going to miss this chance to blow.

I am Marco Foster. I'm 14 years old and I'm from London. I've been suspended twice and about to go into my GCSE period. If I carry on fapping and wasting my time on my arse, I'll be thrown out of school, or fail all my GCSEs. I'm going to change the direction of my life right now.

I don't know how many people will read this, or how many of you will give a fuck, but you won't hear from me so much from now on. I won't be as active on reddit as I have been, only stopping by to post stuff on /r/CivWorldPowers. I would just like to leave you by saying thank you.

Slowly, more and more Glacian soldiers were transported into the city, looking over the civilians as they worked like dogs. Even Mob went to visit to laugh at their miserable state.

Suddenly though, things were about to take a turn for the worse. Due to the putrid conditions the citizens were forced into, local authorities reported an outbreak of a horrifying, deadly virus. It could replicate at an advanced rate, and fatal in 100% of it's victims (although, being in the medieval era, nobody knew what the fuck this shit meant). Panic swept the empire of this terrible disease, and after 3 days of public terror, Mob ordered the entire town to be cordoned from the outside world. Glacies would be saved. The citizens and soldiers inside Onoma Okole...no one wanted to think about what would happen to them. Even Mob seemed to remorse slightly, although that may have been from not being able to kill them with his own hands.

Many families prepared to see the result of the cordon. Would they be saved? Will this virus doom us all.

Their citizens will be ours at all costs, and so we must destroy all remnants of their fleet. Having recently researched Compass, we have just upgraded all our previous ranged dromons into Galleasses, huge hulks of vessels that will tear through the pitiful Houkole navy. Also our navigation has improved thanks to the Compass, hopefully allowing us to outmanoeuvre the enemy ships. Lastly, no navy in the world matches that of the Glacies Commonwealth, sporting **182 Galleasses** and **88 Triremes**, which should absolutely wreck havoc against the enemy.

Are formation is relatively simple. Our triremes will line the front, and will be specially built to take a ton of punishment due to extra shield layers being used. This comes at an expense of less attacking power. Our main firepower will come from our vast fleet of Galleasses, which will rain hell from behind our triremes. Two groups of 20 Galleasses each will sail up each flank and attack from the side and the back, allowing no escape from our superior navy.

He is of very little significance because it will be another, completely different magistrate who will be involved in this story, a man by the name of Sir Harlfjor Rasher. The reason him specifically? He is an expert spymaster, and he was entering Mob's office now.

Sir Rasher rapped on the door thrice, no more and no less. Five raps was definitely out. After the three raps exactly, he entered the room, where the large, intelligent and unnaturally handsome figure of Lord Mob stood. Rasher bowed low, but held his head high to show Mob his large grin (for it was rumoured Mob loved it when people smiled). With his introduction, Mob pulled up a chair and sat down with Harlfjor.

""Sir Rasher, may I begin by thanking you for sparing the time to come by my humble abode""

""The pleasure's all mine my liege!""

""I'm sure you are aware of the recent Elephant War that has rampaged across the continent of Ullr...""

""We live in Pan Gu, sir""

""Really?"" Mob looked questioningly, then realised his mistake and laughed ""My apologies, I was simply experiencing déjà vu. Anyway, I chose you because you are a firm believer in Achintya, are you not?""

""It has ruled my life for ten years, sir""

""That's good to hear, Rasher. You see, we have made some secretive deals with certain nations, and as part of those deals we are tasked with a little, harmless piece of espionage. You have heard of the Lungarns, Rasher? Abominations of people who have been persecuting those who follow Achintya there?

""I have heard of them sir, and I want nothing to do with them""

""But Rasher, for the foreseeable future you will have *everything* to do with them. You must travel to the land of the Lungarns and watch every move they make, by setting up an intricate and invincible spy network in their lands. But before you go, a little task to test your loyalty to my allies.""

With those words the door burst open to reveal two guards dragging in what appeared to be a bedraggled hobo. On his forehead was branded ""Pagan"".

""This man follows Novo Elefante, and threatens our faith Rasher. Your tasked with one simple task,"" a small, similar smirk hung on Mob's face. ""Kill him""

Harlfjor Rasher gasped, and looked at Mob in confusion. This leader has helped led Glacies through an era of irrelevancy, seeming almost to promote the cohesion between the two different faiths that balanced the nation. And now he threatened to kill this person. But very soon, and I mean very soon because my iPad is at 2% charge, he knocked the man out and disposed of him. Without saying a word he marched out, set out to do his task.

And as he left, he heard a strange, ominous laugh echo from Mob's office.",CivWorldPowers,I Spy with my Large Spy Network...,https://www.reddit.com/r/CivWorldPowers/comments/4yl28c/i_spy_with_my_large_spy_network/

Most of the time he's a completely normal guy, but when he gets angry he turns into the Hulk, which he feels he has little control over. The reason I brought this up was because I feel that this is exactly how people dealing with PMO is like. Most of the time this person will be reasonably normal and most likely sane, but as soon as you get an urge, if you don't know how to stop yourself, you'll undergo a transformation into some angry dick-wanking whore. And I'm sure we all don't won't that.

So, in order to have a better chance to succeed and last to whatever goal you've set, you need to know how you horny self will try to convince you that it'll be alright to watch porn, and how your rational self will try to counter that. See, trying not to wank is literally a battle between you and your dick. Your dick, when it's horny, will ALWAYS make up some excuse that watching porn is fine (at least, from what I've observed about myself). For example, I am a 14 year old, and whenever I think about watching porn or I'm just sitting on my computer doing seemingly nothing, my dick always says **""You're only 14, all the people on NoFap develop problems when they are far older than me. It'll be alright to wank *just one more time*""**. This has always been difficult for me to cope with, since at the time I'm also horny as fuck. But the rational part of you needs to create a counter argument quickly, otherwise you'll be fapping away like it's nobody's business. So, my personal comeback is always along the lines of **""Everyone starts wanting at about 12 or 13, and if you don't stop now you'll have a terrible life. Plus, if you manage to quit, you'll have a social one-up on all you're friends for the next 10 years""**

Apologies for what will be a wall of text, and if I come across as the dick I am, but this one strategy could save you from relapsing at that one crucial moment in you're life. If there is a certain phrase you use to try and convince yourself into porn, saying it in the comments could be useful so that we can see what the general direction these temptations take.

Half the people believed that elephants are complete deities, and follow the Catrisyan religion of Achintya, whereas others believe the elephants main purpose on earth is to guide us through our life in a holy way, and follow the Salvadarean religion of Novo Elefante.

Serbia is definitely not *the* most powerful country in the world, and because of this it's difficult for the government to keep it's citizens in line, especially when they need to protect from the Ottomans.

The best grapes from Italy and apples from Greece are brought to Bulgaria, where it is then made into the greatest taste our fictional citizens know and love today. The only downside is that it's incredibly intoxicating. However, this luxury has not been sold outside of Bulgaria's borders. If we were to sell it to other countries, we're sure to make a profit. On the other hand, if we poured it into the Ottoman water source, they may become too drunk to fight...

Great universities stand tall and proud all around the country, and even children of 12 know how to build a car from scratch, or heal a soldier with only a twig and some decently sized leaves. Some further investigation into the education system could help boost our science, or we could tech our students how to build other things - bombers and tanks, for example...

**Morocco**

Spain has fallen. It has been over 500 years since Islam lost it's last holding in Europe, and now that Europe is distracted and the Iberian Peninsula is more split than ever. And now that Morocco is in a powerful position, we can afford to buy a new advisor - a general, military scientist, mechanical engineer and an experienced spy stand out as a few choices.

**Switzerland**

Switzerland is blessed by strategic positioning in the Alps, where all over us are high mountains that stop any hostile forces attempting to invade. It's one of the reasons Tibet is even still a thing in the CBR (or the lack of interest in them). But now our advisors are urging us to convert our farmland into citadels to block off any invading force completely. But should we really turn what little farmland we have into more defense, or should we attempt to improve our agriculture further?

Ever since we have accepted vassalage under Britain we have been relatively safe, which has now resulted in an increasing population. While this seems good on paper, this has lead to the problem of food shortages.

Because of this, young rogues have taken to the streets, stealing food from the innocent nobles. One thief has stuck out in particular, as he's proved to be a reoccurring problem. Only last week he stole bread from a kindly merchant, and in the police chase that followed killed a fire-eater with his own flames and a nail-sitter with his own nails. The police ended up drowning in a barrel of shit.

It doesn't stop there however. The dangerous youth has unfortunately stolen a magic carpet of some kind from an unfortunate dead pharaoh's tomb, and seems poised to use it against the government, and well has his sidekick monkey and the genie he's enslaved, even though it's expressed will to be released. Not even the princess is safe, as the criminal keeps kidnapping her from her balcony and encouraging her into unprotected sex. Surely defeating this criminal should be our number one priority?

This, as can be imagined, has been a huge blow to the nation of Huihang, who has given away  1,000 to no avail.

Once the messenger arrived at the Baomin's Court and revealed the news the officials were in turmoil. Leaders bickered over the greediness of the city-states, and whether more drastic actions should be taken place to reclaim their gold they were so rudely stripped of.

""We must prove to them that they cannot make fools of our people!"" spat a Zenzhe general, known as Zhanshi. ""If we have no military, these Lowlanders will *never* take us seriously!""

""We have not fought a proper war in many centuries,"" breathed the Baomin, ""We cannot expect our monks to be capable of fighting the Lowlanders by their mere ninja training""

""Our men train their whole lives to fight, and they never do!"" screamed Zhanshi. ""Besides, we don't need to fight them, simply scare them enough for us to be capable of installing our own diplomats as the rulers of the states!""

""We cannot gain favour from Nature by pursuing pointless fights, we will be instructing them about Nature's ways!"" Baomin's voice was raising at this point. 

""We will never gain favour from the Lowlanders when our military is so pitiful! Why are we giving nations weaker than ourselves gold, when they have already proved themselves greedy enough to take our gold and turn us away without second thought!""

""What are you going to do about it then, Zhanshi?""

The Zenzhen General glowered at Baomin, and then a familiar, wry smile formed on his face ""I will take the reins of the country from you, scoundrel!""

A gasp filled the room, and a sullen silence hung soon afterwards, as if Nature herself was shocked by the turn of events. No-one had dared defy the Baomin before, not like Zhanshi just did. No-one knew what would happen either.

The Baomin raised up, staring angrily at the proud general of Zhangshi. Slowly, intensively, the Baomin stepped throughout the room eyeing the officials, who stood as straight as possible so as to not offend the Baomin. He, coughed, then said:

""I do not approve of the young man's defiance, but I am a man of peace and courtesy. Therefore, we shall have a vote. If you want me to continue doing the great pursuit of protecting the peace of the people, keep your hands down by your sides.

On arriving, they are shocked to find the city wasn't razed after all, and that the Albions and Wodenburgens decided to hold it. Knowing this, Mob's army knew that sieging the city outright would be foolish. Therefore, they hid themselves in the dense forest, on the other side of the River Olioli, and when the Albions attempt to cross it (to get to Funland), and half the Albions were across and the other half were on the other side, the Funnish soldiers would reveal themselves and attack.

The Funnish archers would shoot from across the river at the people on the other side, while the Longswordsmen would attack those who managed to cross. Once we push them back to the other side of the bridge (or ford), the Pikemen will set up formation on the bridge/ford, stopping the enemy from getting across, with the longswordsmen dropping behind them. Our archers will continue to fire until none are left.

#**Things to note**

**Albion Advantages:**

- They picked up Steel weapons from the corpses of the previous battle, although they would've had absolute minimal training with them.

- They would be well-rested, unlike the Funnish who would've had a long march from the capital.

- Their army has fought a battle, allowing them battle experience over my new batch of soldiers.

**Funland Advantages:**

- We are more experienced with steel weaponry than they are.

- We would be taking them by surprised, meaning we have a strategy and they don't. This is very important as well because they definitely wouldn't be ready to fight, giving us the initial advantage.

- Our army comprises of 3,000 soldiers, whereas they have 1,258 men. That means we've got well over double the men they have.

- We are fighting in our home country. This isn't incredibly important, but it does mean we'd be well supplied and shit.

One was a strange man from a foreign country, known only as [REDACTED]. He seemed reasonably twitchy, and rightly so. Far away from home and in the middle of a war-torn, politically unstable country, his life was exactly guaranteed. And the fifth person had his signature greedy smile plastered across his face.

The wiry foreigner coughed once, possibly to get Mob's attention (but more likely due to all the smog). ""Ehm, Mob, do you want to get down to business now?"" Mob looked hazily through his eyes, and gave the man a slight nod. Knowing his cue, the man reached under his seat and brought up a bulging sack. After heaving it onto the table, ducats upon ducats spilled across the table. The general and the advisors all stood up in shock, but Mob remained seated, his smile growing ever wider.

* Wodenburg asks for Albion's help, because he's not strong enough by himself.

* Facing battle, Wodenburg changes it's national focus to help with the war effort. This will come back to bite them...

* Salvadare threatens Mob with war if he pillages the trade route with Wodenburg. Mob argues a lot with Salvadare.

* Funland attacks Kainz. After an intense fight the walls collapse and Kainz is Funnish. After hearing all the citizens crying Mob, quite justifiably, razes the city to the ground.

* Albion declares war on Funland, since the treaty between them expired. They move on to Seapearl. Albion also changes it's national focus to aid it during war time.

* Albion marches on to Seapearl and overruns it. The island is now united under the Albions.

* Nexus denounces Funland for their purgings of the Sadland and Wodenburg people. Mob declares war on Nexus for denouncing them.

* Due to their change in national focus, and subsequently their abysmal governing ability, a plague breaks out in Kainz, which Wodenburg isn't able to contain. The virus spreads to Albion and Nexus, the two other people Mob was at war with (how lucky). Although Albion and Nexus cure it, Wodenburg does not and is overrun with plague. Perditia Nova also catches the plague.

* Facing bankruptcy, plague, war and chaos Wodenburg has reached it's breaking point. Slowly the leader crawled to the feet of Albion, pleading for a protectorate status under them, under the circumstance that Albion would destroy Funland entirely. Albion accepts, and sets sail for the Mainland.

* Gateon Port is the first target. Due to the Funnish army being mostly destroyed, the city falls, and plans begin on razing it.

The day was completely chaotic, with both Wodenburg and Funnish men collapsing into the blood-soaked mud. The fighting was intense, but at the end of the day, the Funnish soldiers crumbled the walls and massacred the soldiers. Women and children screamed as they entered, but on the rubble above them, standing tall and smirking proud, was the man they dreaded. Mob the Glorious.

The populace was rounded up by Mob's feet, shocked looks scarring their faces. They look at the smiling, crazed man above them, and the Soldiers in Pink, grinning equalling large. A large, horrifying beast stood by the side of Mob, drool dripping down it's cheek. Hungry for blood. Then, Mob began to speak.

""Greetings...pitiful shits"", he exclaimed, his grin growing larger. ""Your pathetic defenders tried defending your city, did they? Well, look how good a job they've down at that!"" He laughed at that, and kicked a dead Wodenburg archer down the rubble to prove his point. ""The real question is whether I should leave you alive, however. Because, quite frankly, I've got an idea of killing every single one of you""

At that, several children in the crowd started crying. Their mothers tried to comfort them, but it was too late. A hint of mad fury glinted in Mob's eyes, as he screamed, ""Soldiers! Find those fuckers! They'll learn to follow the Funland way!"" With that, the gleeful soldiers hacked through the crowd to get at the dismal wretches. Quickly enough, the children were hauled to the front, crying their eyes out. Nothing could save them.

The soldiers threw their faces onto the ground, and within a moment began the terrible deed of beheading them. All the women of the town screamed now, and with that the fate of Kainz was decided.

""Raze the city!"" Roared Mob, the crazed scream taking him over completely, save for the large grin on his face. ""Kill everybody that frowns!"" The soldiers nodded, and set off, hacking and burning and pillaging. Women screamed, Tickle Monsters charged, and babies died. The spirits of the dead joined those from Sadland, and by the end of the day there was nothing left of the city.

Mob looked onto the wreck of the ruins. And grinned ever harder. With that, he gave the order to ride back to Gateon Port, where his soldiers would feast and celebrate, like they did every night.

Effect; Kainz is razed, and every citizen killed (albeit a few who managed to escape). This means Kainz will no longer be a city, and the Wodenburg army cannot gain supplies here if they pass by.

The way Albion and Wodenburg sided with each other more and more in international debates, and that with each month they seemed to hate Funland more. Although he had no proof, since he was rivalled to them both, it seemed very likely that, as soon as the Albion peace treaty expired, they would pounce on Funland, which would be an attack Mob would not survive.

So, although it would be a hard war, Mob had been preparing. Finally his researchers had discovered the information to give him the upper hand in wars: Steel. With this significant advantage, Mob knew that if he did not fight on his own terms, he would be forced to fight a two front war he couldn't win. 

Therefore, the next day, Mob decided to declare war on Wodenburg, without the intent to invade Albion afterwards. The Funnish Tickle Monsters shall walk into the city of Wodenburg victorious!

Months past after Mob woke up in the 'village by the sea'. Soon, many of the local men were drafted into the military, and many of the artists were forced to include Funnish propaganda in their works. Walls were built around the town, and the town became a castle. Mob's Palace had been built.

Mob felt a weird aura around these people, almost as if a supernatural...*thing* possessed this place. There was a dead look in their eyes, and a massive smile on their face. As the days grew older, so did their smiles, almost growing wider and wider. Of course, for Mob, this was exceptionally pleasing; everyone was actually *willing* to smile in this place! But why were they like this? These people barely spoke, only smiled...

Mob's empire expanded quickly; the herds of Tickle Monsters nearby and the devoutness of his citizens made this simple. Soon the towns of Smiling City and Gateon Port was founded, but these men weren't as devout. In the early days, it wasn't easy. Many... misguided civilians had to be relocated to specifically made camps. If they didn't smile, the Tickle Monsters would be the last things they saw. Some men walking near the camps are haunted yet by the terrible laughter erupting from within the walls. Then silence.

Still, Mob enjoyed the genocide. Who wouldn't? It's one of the two things Mob lived for (the other being unquenchable joy, of course). But now the time for expansion may no longer be through colonization, but for conquest. Several nations have appeared on the border. First, the Albions. After the founding of Seapearl, the Funnish traders met with this nation, and although friendship with them would be acceptable, wouldn't it be so much better to control the land for themselves?

Second, was the nation of Wodenburg. At first glance, they seem to follow a strange pagan religion, and have strange barbaric traditions. This culture, thought Mob to himself, shouldn't be allowed to thrive in this world.

But lastly was the nation Mob learned to hate as soon as it's name was whispered through the winds. *Sadland* it moaned out. *Sadland is back*. Mob shivered in rage. He heard of this nation before, but in a life he wished not to look back on. Sadland was the complete antonym of Funland. Where Mob the Marvellous laughed in a joyous thunder, Pub the Pessimist's misery brought the rainclouds. Sadland was full of dejected villains, whereas Mob's citizens would look out with smiles across their faces and deadness filling their eyes. No, cursed Mob, Sadland cannot be allowed to exist. And, while walking back to his palace that day, the cold winds still called out at him, chilling his spine further.

A blurry, hazy smog surrounded him, suffocating him. Hacking and coughing, he stumbled out through a door. Throwing the cowskin flap open, he blundered outside, hit in the face by immense sunlight. He took a deep breath of pure air, gulping it down in frantic gasps. Then, when he took in his surroundings, he noticed just how beautiful this land was.

He was standing on top of a beautiful, shrub-rich coastline, casting it's gaze over an opal ocean. Large shoals of fish danced about in the shallows, light shimmering on their gills as their swam about. And, along the bright yellow sand of the beach, was a humble little fishing village, with children laughing and parents working. This truly was a glorious place, for a glorious person.

And yet a strange figure stood by him. Turning around, Mob witnessed a man whose like he never saw before. He wore clothes made of silk and gold, and in one hand he held a sceptre, and in the other a globe. But, strangest of all, he possessed an alien, rat-like tail, which protruded from his rear end.

""I see you have woken up, Mob"" Spoke the figure, surely about to tell Mob something wise he needed him to know. ""It's about fucking time, mate. I would've thought that all those candles and smoke would've woken you ages ago""

""What do you want from me?""

""I want nothing from you, only that you succeed in this life. I have decided to bring you back to the world of the living, a world full of new people to spread the word of Optimism. A world with no Lurking, or Mallock, or any of those ERC scum. A world where Funland shall prosper! I have bestowed upon you a new beginning, with what you want to do with it is your decision. These men will do your bidding, and no one elses."" And with that he turned to walk away, off into the distance.

""Where the fuck are you going?"" Shouted Mob after him

The figure turned around. ""I'm going back behind the 4th Wall, where the rest of my kind spend there days. And, if you come across it one day, do not destroy it. A guy called Denny said not to do that?""

""Then why did you just break it?""

""I'm fucking God, I do what I want""

And with those wise words, the figure was gone. Mob was left by himself. The first thing he would do, he told himself, would be to instil a sense of happiness into these people.

Beaten, but not defeated, Mob retreated back to the Roman lines. There he met with the Roman generals friendly enough to fight his cause. They began to discuss tactics moving forwards, but Mob knew that there was more he needed to do.

Throughout the war council, the Romans noticed the increasing distant look on Mob's face. Finally, Mob excused himself, and left the tent for his own chambers. In rage, he blasted his stool across the room, and, suddenly finding himself with nowhere to sit, threw himself on the floor, huffing in defeat. His initial rebellion had failed, and it didn't look promising for the Roman invasion. There was nothing left to do. Slowly, he unsheathed his dagger, and raised it above him. Then, suddenly...

He spied something propped up inside the tent. Slowly, he walked towards it, and raised it up. Tossing it from side to side, and whirling it around, a smile grew on his face. He knew what to do.

An hour later, a young soldier burst into the camp.

""Sir, Mob of Byzantium and a 50 soldiers from our Byzantine division have been seen running towards the enemy!""

In a hurry, all the leaders rushed to Mob's room. They charged in, where a surprising - and unusual - scene met their eyes. A large hole was carved into the tent-side, the tent flapping cleanly.

His army marched across the plains of the Balkans, presumably, they thought, to defeat the Spartan scum, but thanks to Mob's foreign allies his civil war - so long remaining a vision in his mind - would come to fruition.

If everything went to plan, he would remain Emperor of Byzantium. Forever.

As soon as night fell that day he ordered his troops to set up camp. When it was finished he sent out an order to all his armies to gather round him, as he delivered his speech.

""MY FELLOW BYZATINES!"" He roared, ""You are the people in our empire that truly brings pride and prestige to our glorious nation! Each soldier has proved himself worthy to dine with even the God Mars himself!"" A mighty roar erupted from the crowd. ""And I have made sure that each of you have been treated just how you deserved to be. Which Emperor was the one to recruit more brave men like you, to increase each of your wages by double the amount, and who personally rode with you to battle? Indeed, I have rode alongside you as brothers, but unfortunately I cannot do so for much longer. As we speak, the cowards who don't dare fight are gathering at Constantinople to decide who will be the next Emperor, but do you honestly think that he will treat you as well as I have? As soon as the next claimant overthrows me, your wages will be cut and you will be treated like strategic pawns, not dear brothers.""

""So this is what I ask of you, of each of you. Tonight, we feast marvelously, dining on a more extravagant meal than you've ever seen in your life. Then, tomorrow, alongside our foreign friends, we march onto Byzantium, taking city by city until the pitiful administrators at Constantinople are forced to give up the thrown to us, and then we shall spend the rest of our lives in glory, wealth and extravagance.

I asked her out 5 days after meeting her, because there's no way I'm letting her go out with someone when I had a perfect opportunity to ask her out.

For weeks now I've been telling myself that I'm better than all my friends, that they all watch around three times a week and I only did it about once every two weeks.

Please, I don't want to force her into doing something to satisfy my penis, or to view her only as a source of pleasure.

Bulbo Boggens was a poor rat. He spent his life living off other people's success, like a leech, theiving and pickpocketing.

This did not matter to Bulbo at all, however. He spent his days and his money on his son. Him and Frudo played together all the time, especially with their sackball they treasured so much.

Then Bulbo realised. He wasn't going to a diamond mine.  Something terrible was going to happen to him, which he had no power to stop. But he also knew that it would be far better to let them do whatever they wanted than to force his son to see him die. He asked the man if he could have one last talk with Frudo, which was allowed. He walked over to the playroom, where his son was rolling the sackball around the floor.

""Hey, Frudo, I've got to go now. I'll be back soon, okay?""

""Alright dad. And when you come back, we can play sackball together, won't we?""

""Of course son. We always play sackball together. Before I go, remember that I always loved you, okay? I would never let anything bad happen to you""

""Dad, I know you love me. Why are you saying this?""

""Promise me you'll be a good boy and...and that you'll remember about you're dad while I'm gone""

""Dad, what's happening? Where are you going?""

Bulbo pulled him into a hug, holding him tightly around his chest. He promised himself that he would never let go, that he would hug him until the last drops of life were gone from him. ""It's going to be okay, Frudo. It'll be okay. Just okay.""

General Gundelf burst into the room. He tried to drag Bulbo away from Frudo, tearing with all his might, shouting at the poor man. Bulbo couldn't remember when, but at some point an incessant screaming filled the room. It was coming from Frudo. He tried to reassure Frudo, tell him that he would be back soon, but he was out cold too quickly. Gundelf had knocked him out.

The last time Frudo ever saw his dad - alive at least - was that moment when his cold body was dragged out of the burrow. Frudo tried to shout, but his voice was choked back from the constant flow of tears masking his face.",CivWorldPowers,An Unexpected Journey,https://www.reddit.com/r/CivWorldPowers/comments/4luy2j/an_unexpected_journey/

The hairs on his back were growing greyer by the month, even though he tried to hide it from his subjects. The fact was, soon his days would be numbered, and he currently had no heir to continue his lineage. That is, if there even is a Spardshock to hand to an heir.

Reports have come of a massive army, well over 20,000 in size. There was no way Spardshock's half-killed army would survive. Despite recieveing a force of roughly 14,000 in the near future, it still might not be enough to defeat the Ronans. Then suddenly, Genadelose got an idea. It was a terrible one, but might be the only way to save Spardshock.

""Bloediger, come here. I've got a plan!"" Since the army offices were so closeto Genadeloses rooms (he himself was a general after all) the Chief of the Armies, Bloediger, entered the room within minutes.

""What is it, most powerful Een?"" 

""As your aware, a very large amount of Ronan forces will approach from the north. Despite soon receiving forces from our friends of [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], it won't quite be enough to guarantee victory, and as you know, we must guarantee it wherever possible""

""That is true, glorious leader. What strategy do you plan on deploying?""

""I know this will cause a lot of unrest, but it's necessary to save the country. We must move a large amount of citizens north, preferably from outside of Spardshock. Between 5,000 and 10,000 will work well.""

""Sir, with all due respect, you can't honestly expect mere citizens to win this war for us? I know they have training, but they still cannot stand up to a force that strong! We'll be crushed!""

""Normal citizens would, dear Bloediger,"" explained Genadelose, ""but I have heard of this...disease, apparently it's come from Formosa. It...revives the dead, turns them into monsters that don't know pain, monsters that live to eat the flesh of humans, monsters that cannot die! These 'things', especially if the infected were those of our nation, would devastate the enemy army. They would infect their soldiers, turning them against themselves, monsters that crave to kill. Victory would be all but guaranteed.""

Through Genadelose's speech Bloediger listened in silent horror. His own leader was asking to purposefully commit genocide against his own nation, just to kill the Ronans. ""Sir, what the fuck are you suggesting?! Killing our own families, turning them into monsters?! Destroying our own nation just to destroy theirs? Just listen to yourself, Genadelose! It's fucking crazy!""

""If we don't do this, many more innocent lives will perish, and the flame of Spardshock will be gone forever. It's this or defeat, Bloediger""

""If you want to carry this out, find another fucking man. It's insane""

""Bloediger! This is the only way! We'll make it as painless as possible for them. We'll select criminals and murderers first, we don't want to rip families apart too much. You've got to understand; this has to be done.""

Realizing the truth in Genadelose's words, Bloediger came to his senses and calmed down. A simple 'fine' was all he could whisper, as he walked out the room to start the transportation north of the 6,585 criminals that were currently either locked in a dungeon somewhere, or even suspected of a crime and still living outside. They all had to move.

Strangely enough, they weild weapons never even heard of before in our times, ones that emit a beam of light that kills anyone that it hits instantly, and round, ball-like weapons that explode, disintegrating any man anywhere near it. How on earth could this be?

The more intelligent people in our race have delved into our history, and have discovered that around 100 years ago, the city of Spardshock actually used to be the capital of the world, easily dominating any primitive tribe it came across. The world was completely under the whim of the First Nation, who fought bows and swords with lighting and fire. They descended from the skies,   nestled in metallic cocoons. These men must've been sent by the Gods to enlighten the world. Maybe they were Gods.

But then the men who came down began fighting amongst themselves. Fearing they were overcome with evil, the omnipotent lords above killed them all in one powerful blast, leaving only the most benevolent people left. These people, however, had to bear the brunt of their fallen friends sins by being cursed with their rat-like features. The scientists and religious figures of Spardshock now predict that the Gods want Spardshock to prevent others from being so foolish, by teaching them of the Gods and saving them from the Big Bang. These  enlightened people, however, have grown disgusted with the way the militants are behaving, believing that evil has taken them over yet again. In the shadows they practise their religion and plot on forming their own order, one that was purely holy and made to serve the Lords of the Sky. 

And one day, they will end the madness of Genadelose Een...

**Effect**: A religion is formed in Spardshock, known as *Kern Gode* (followers are called *Kernites*). Mil/Inf ratio is changed to 80/20 due to these people's hatred of fighting, and so instead they become priests and scientists. A seperatist group may form up soon to create a nation solely dedicated to practicising and spreading their religion of Kern Gode.",CivWorldPowers,The Descent of the Gods.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CivWorldPowers/comments/4loyy9/the_descent_of_the_gods/

But seriously, I fucking hate it. I'm not even out of school and it seems like my life could be a disaster. If I don't study as hard as I can I won't do well in my GCSEs, and if I don't do well in those I won't be able to take my A-levels, and if I don't do well in those I won't be able to get to a good university (because I'd need to get a scholarship, otherwise it'll cost a fortune and, possibly due to capitalism as well, my family aren't the richest people out there), and if I do badly at university I won't be able to get a great job, and if I don't get that I won't be able to support a family if I were to have one. Now, I'm not too worried about jumping those hurdles, but what if you fell over at one point? Do you just give up, knowing that society may end up dumping you with being a McDonald's worker for the rest of your life? Imagine knowing that you'd have to accept being in that position?

Can society just shut the fuck up for a minute? Why do we need to be in a constant competition with each other to get the best job, to marry the perfect wife, to buy the most expensive house? Why is there such a big difference between the richest and poorest? Seriously, there's got to be a better way of living than to be forever struggling to make a living until the day you die.

The northern-most Ronan lands were ceded over, plus 50 criminals were handed over for the triumph. And, most importantly, they still had an army to continue their conquests. The rest of Monablade can wait.

The parade started with the triumphant warriors marching through the street-tunnels, hissing and whooping as they went, riling up the cheering crowd. Following them were seven soldiers they managed to capture before peace was declared, plus the 50 criminals negotiated for in the peace.

The saviour of the rats from democracy and corruption, and the man who would forge an empire for the rats. Men cheered until their throats bled, and when Genadelose reached the end point of the parade, he stood up to announce his speech;

Everyone here is invited to the gladiator match between the 57 enemies, all fighting at once, and their bodies left over will be given to our chefs to turn into a delicious feast for the whole city!""

A whole minute of unmatched thunder followed, and afterwards Genadelose walked out to his private office. A few jubilant generals met him, and congratulated him on such a great speech. Een merely nodded, and looked at his generals in a serious tone.

Leader: Mob the Glorious

Location: North Korea
Description: Funland is an upstart nation, founded by the intrepid ruler of Funland, Mob the Most Glorious. Mob began his humble life in a party cult in Hawaii, on the island of Lanai. The Party Pals, as they were known, lived their lives in a constant state of partying. And to know the story of Funland, you must also know the story of the Party Pals.

---

The Party Pals began life as a simple, happy community on the island of Kahoolawe. They were content and peaceful, and as their community grew, so did their need for food. Suddenly the tiny island could not support them all, and it became painfully obvious they needed to move to a larger, more abundant island. One fateful night, the Prophet of the Pals, known as Rain Shower, led his people to the island of Lanai. On the trip there many died, either drowned or blown off-course, but the majority made it safe and sound. The Rain poured down that night, and for the first few days of the Party Pals existence the people lived miserably, having little to eat and little to care about. Over time, however, their new settlement of Gateon Port grew in size, and eventually became the capital of the Party Pals we all know today.

---

It was in the time of depression, however, that Mob cracked. He was one of the most fanatical people about happiness in the country, and seeing so much unhappiness disgusted him. Seizing a small canoe boat, and several of his most loyal followers, he left Gateon Port to create a more powerful - and happier empire. After a month of sailing they arrived in Northern Korea. They arrived at a town of simple farming people, and wielding superior weapons such as muskets and bayonets against their pitchforks and swords, Mob's invasion force easily subjugated them. After building his palace by the sea, and building large walls around the city to stop them escaping.

---

The citizens were then forced to Mobs fanatical laws. Happiness was the main principle of Funland, and he promptly founded the following laws:

**1.** anyone caught frowning or crying was charged with defying Mobs orders and were executed by Tickle Monster. 

**2.** Each house within the borders of Funland must have a minimum of 5 baloons on it at any given time.

**3.** Each citizen over the age of 21 must have a PhD in Clown Comedics , Tomfoolery, Balloon Making or Bouncy Castle Enthusiast. 

**4.** Each post must end with the phrase 'Glory to the Hilarious Empire of Funland!'. Not having an exclamation at the end could be punishable by death or imprisonment.

**5.** If the Empire is not the happiest nation in the world, 1 in every 10 people will be executed.

It was spring, 478, but this was not to be a season of rebirth. This was the day that, deep underground in the bunkers and subways of Spardshock, a bloody and destructive conflict was about to take place. It would rip apart communites and families, and nobody would know who to trust. It was the Spardshock Civil War, soon to be one of the bloodiest battles known to man.

The fight was to be fought between the Loyalists and the Militarists. The Militarists accused The Orator that he was far too weak for such a powerful nation, and that they should be forging an empire instead of forging friendships. They believed that after the deal he made with Antilla, where the Spardshockians would mine diamonds for Antilla in return for large resources of meat and some of the gold, was like their own government forcing them into slavery, but even worse was when he proved himself an incompetent war leader, after losing most of their elite soldiers to *barbarians!* The Militarists were led by a man called Genadelose Een. The Loyalists believed The Orator was a righteous leader. They had mostly lost their animal sense of bloodthirst and cannibalism, and some even went so far as to delve into science. They are naturally led by The Orator.

The war started with a Militarist attack on The Orator's underground fort. The walls didn't last long under their bloodthirsty barrage of tooth and claw, and soon the battle heated up to an extreme point. At first the suprising effectiveness of the Militarist attack pushed them back, but with nowhere to go the Militarists were pinned in, and the losses grew. Finally they fled the castle, losing slightly more than the Loyalists.

But the war is not over. The Loyalist army leave the safety of the stronghold, and give chase to the Militarists in the streets. Soldiers, bandits and bystanders were caught in the fray, slicing off heads and claws into the ribs. The big decider was when the bystanders, seeing the disgust and hatred in the eyes of the Militarists, decided to side with The Orator. Finding themselves hemmed in from all sides, what was left of the Militarists fled even further, all the why back to Genadelose's camp. It looked as if the day was lost.

However, at their darkest moment, they formed a plan. Genadelose ordered his men to dig above thhe tunnels, right above the enemy. As they were besieging the camp, they dug downwards, and thousands of rat-men seemed almost to fall from the sky. The Loyalists were squashed and suffocated underneath, and were soon slit in the throat. This battle only lasted 30 minutes, but in that time thousands upon thousands of loyalists were killed. In their worst moment, the Militarists proved to be excellent fighters, and cunning tacticians. Everything was even now, and it came down to the last battle in the mines.

The last battle was fought in the mines because The Orator was planning an escape. Fearing the worst, he and a couple thousand soldiers charged into the mines, with a few militarist scouts watching them go. After the massacre of the rest of the Loyalists, the Militarists soon swarmed into these mines. The fighting grew fierce indeed, this time with each force crushing into each other brutally. It's said that those who died in this final battle continued to be propped up by the people around him, that's how intense it was. 

The battle seemed to last forever, but finally the Militarists cleverly manged to collapse the mine on the Loyalists. All were wiped out, included the hated Orator. Genadelose was victorious!

THE AFTERMATH

---

Soon Genadelose was instilled as the solitary ruler of Spardshock; an absolute ruler, ruler with all power. Even though many died, the military was still reasonably formidable, enough to hold of any attack from the outside. In the meantime, Genadelose is shifting more and more focus towards military. Best not undermine them now.

And for the Orator? He was killed during the mine collapse, but his body was recovered. His head was immidiately torn off his body, and his torso was to be consumed by the bloodthirsty rats who once followed him.

It seemed he forced his own citizens to slave for another country, mining the precious gems in the Pelley to give to the filthy foreigners. His behaviour was disgusting.

Instead they were lied to, as much of the army was under-trained and sent on a mission with too many risks. Their safety wasn't considered, and weren't properly instructed how to attack the encampment. Therefore they struck a structural weak-spot, and the mountain collapsed on many of them. Then the barbarians descended on them, killing half of those who managed to live. The attack was a failure.

Many of the citizens now looked on at The Orator in disgust. They wanted to become the militaristic nation they had every right to be, and yet he proved himself to be weak. He made friends with everyone he met, and sent his military in suicidal tasks. Their hate soon turned to a want of bloodthirst, and regularly went to illegal gatherings held by their leader, Genadelose Een.

Every day the rats became more civilised, and more and more gemstones flowed in from the Pelley mountains. Their fighting force, despite not being quite the most effective, was becoming less efficient. Hand to hand combat, no matter how ferocious and devastating the warriors were, could only get you so far.

And with this, The Orator had a plan forming in his head. There was a large barbarian encampment in the mountains, which kept killing many Antillan merchants that passed through. To solve his military issue and take care of these savages, Spardshock needed to organise an elite fighting force, which would specialise in fighting in the mountains.

Therefore the military generals, keen researchers and the top advisors were called to work on the 'Alpini Warriors'. They were to be located mainly in the mountains, and when there enemy is walking along the cliff edge, the expert warriors would dig underneath them, collapsing the ground beneath and sending many of the tumbling down the mountain, to a painful death below. Then, when they got rid of enough soldiers, they would dig up right beneath them and drag them underground, where they would meet a gruesome death.

But for this task they would have to fight with more than just their hands. Longer, metal claws would be attached to their hands (M: think Wolverine) to help them in combat and in digging. And light armour would have to be worn, to help them move and offer some protection. But for these weapons they'd need a metal no-one's heard of before. Scientists were sent to mix the metals that have been mined in the Mountains, and, perhaps, they may create something powerful. Then the world will surely crumble...

Planets were torn apart by viscious slaughters, and whole suns were ripped open to gain control of the empire. Soon the old Empire crumbled, leaving the colony on this planet by itself. But they didn't expect the second disaster to happen so soon, the Civil War. A rogue general in charge of a large army led an attack on the Council of Spardshock after being turned out of the council. His name was Darth Mao, and slowly but surely he destroyed all that's left of the First Nation. Eventually he was brought to his knees, but in a last ditch attempt he fired a nuclear warhead straight at the capital, obliterating all the buildins and nature that the First Nation ever built. Only the ones that hid in bunkers and deep subways survived, but they would pay for survival very heavily. They became mutated, ugly monsters. They became the Slum Rats.

* **Appearance**: The Slum Rat looks exactly what it sounds like. Large bristles spike out of it's back, and they have matted hair on the rest of their body. They have claws instead of fingers and toes. They have sharp teeth and large eyes, and are accustomed to seeing in the dark. They've got to, as they must live underground, only coming above the surface at night. This is because the radiation has made their skin very fragile, and so direct contact with the sun is extremely harmful, almost fatal.

* **Mining**: Of course, due to being vulnerable to any sort of firther radiation, - including that of the sun - added to the fact that the mutated people had forgotten most of their pre-war skills, save for eating and scavenging, they are obviously terrible farmers. But recently, working for the Protectorate of Antilla, we have found a new cause: mining. Slum Rats are exceptionally good at tunneling, and have already built causeways across quite a good chunk of the Gorom Peninsula. Mining into the mountains, our people have come across valuable gems, and in return for giving it to Antilla we get a large portion of the money, plus large quantities of food, enough to feed all our citizens well. It is in this way we get our nutrition.

* **Warriors**: Another skill my people have excelled at is combat. Slum Rats are carnivores, and they can and will eat anything. That includes human meat. If you walk in the vicinity of Spardshock at night, you may here the earth beneath you rumble. Then, almost magically, my people would spring up from the ground, sometimes even sinking the earth beneath their target. Their skin may be weak, but yearsof scavenging and fighting each other off has led to them being incredibly inept at fighting. Their claws aren't there for show.

It is for this reason I ask to stay out of the free movement of citizens. You aren't fully safe in my lands as of now, but I am working on getting them to be more accepting of humans.

I know this may not be much information, but understand that we do not really have our own cuisine, or culture, or traditions, or anything really like that. Even though are nation's ancestery can be traced all the way back to the dawn of man, we are pretty much an entirely new creation. I have full confidence that this new breed of humans I rule over have the potentional to be just as powerful and influential as any human nation was before them. Thank you for your time!

CivWorldPowers is an idea that I had about two months ago. It's based on civ5, but in order for many more people to be involved and so that we don't have any laggy AI only games, the stuff is done on a map. People create their nations, and interact with the world around them. Basically, you create your nation and RP your way to greatness.

#**Is it too late to join?**

It's never too late! The point of this game is to get lots of people to interact with each other in a fun game. If there isn't enough space, it's very simple to add a whole other continent for a whole new batch of players to have fun on. Don't get put off just because you joined half-way through!
#**That sounds cool. How do I create my nation?**

To create your own nation, you can follow the instructions on the gloriously named Nation Creation Station, built for the sole purpose of generating your nation. I will then add you as soon as possible to the Nation list, plus to all the maps that are on the sidebar.

#**Can you run me through the maps?**

The Political Map shows what land each nation controls. White spaces shows unoccupied land, and each nation has a different colour showing what land they control. The political map is the more important map of the lot. The Religion Map shows what religion each hex follows, and can be used to declare crusades, defend others of the same faith etc. The Resource Map shows what each hex has, and exists so that you know what your land is worth. The Feature Names map, made by the amazing /u/bantha-food, shows what different parts of land are called, so that no one fucks up the names. And lastly, the City Map, which includes the main cities of each nation. I created this to help with OC posts, and so that people know where the cities are when they want to go to war.

#**So, I created a nation, but you haven't responded. Have I not been accepted?**

I want to take this opportunity to say sorry to all the people I haven't responded to yet. At the time of this post I have been receiving a ton of nation applications, so I haven't been able to respond to barely half of them. I have read through most of your things, but due to me being a mere mortal I haven't responded. If there is a problem I'll let you know, but if it's fine I probably won't respond. Sorry!

#**Ok then. What do I do now?**

Well, right now I'm working on adding a new continent to harbour all the new nations, but once you've been added onto the map and you're officially created, you can begin interacting with those in the world around you. You can post OC threads about what you're nation is doing, you can attack or befriend those around you, or you could just post a shitpost every day. But, on the topic of RP, if you think it can be canon and isn't virtually impossible, post what you want. Do whatever you like!

#**Wait a second, how do I post stuff?**

Once you create your post, you should flair it with the flairs provided by the mods. I would think about which one of these flairs best suits your post:

• Event - for any event that does not fit under the other flairs.

• Meta - An entirely out-of-character post. Typically questions about the game, suggestions/complaints etc.

• Diplomacy - Diplomatic interaction with another country.

• Art - Used on meta days to post interesting art (paintings, portraits, commemorative paintings, artifacts, objects, replicas, music, poetry, stories, etc) that occurred in your nation during this time period.

• Colonization - Your attempt to colonize something, this includes hexes as far or near as you like. These don't need RP, just which hexes you want to claim and why you think you deserve them. If multiple people desire the same hex, it's up to them how to decide the matter, and until the situation is resolved it will be labelled as contested.

• War - A declaration of war on a country/political entity. Needs RP, either in the post or as a pre-post build-up.

• Battle - A battle between 2 or more belligerents. Contains strategy, troop types, movements, plans, replies from other belligerents, resolution by mod etc.

• Civil War - Rarely used by players and rather a tool for World Mods, Civil War is for a post announcing a civil war.

• Secret - A post whose contents remain unknown to you in-character. If you consider yourself mentally strong and capable of not (even subconsciously) using the knowledge you obtain from other people's secret posts when planning your own move then you're free to look at it. Otherwise it's generally advised to not open a secret post.

Almost all of these need RP, so make sure you get you're writing fingers ready. 

#**Alright then, but before I post I want to know what era we are in.**

Right now we are in the early Medieval Era. If you look at [this Techtree that you are all familiar with](http://www.civfanatics.com/gallery/showimage.php?i=3877&amp;original=1&amp;c=36) we have researched all the Ancient and Classical Era techs, and we are just about ready to move on to the medieval. Researching techs is decided like everything else is; RP. When you feel that your nation has discovered a tech, make an RP post about your discovery. The nations around you then have the excuse to learn this thing from you (unless you are a conservative dictatorship, enemies etc.), and therefore your tech will spread across the land.

#**Alright then, I've just made a battle post. How will it be decided?**

Any post that requires some sort of neutral body deciding the outcome will be dealt with by a Mod using /u/rollme. To call for a Mod, either tag one in your post, or say the handy command 'Calling Mods' in the comments of the post, and AutoModerator will instantly call all the available battle mods for you. I will leave an example of it in the comments of this post. Please DO NOT spam the AutoModerator, as it gets very annoying, and I could use it as a reason to ban you if you do it too much.

#**Can I become a Mod?**

I am still up for taking in anybody who is willing to decide battles and stuff. If you:

a) Familiar with using /u/rollme and the system of decision we are using

b) Fine with possibly being tagged a lot

c) Willing to help someone if they do tag you.

Then you are qualified to become a battle mod! Please say that you are willing in the comments, and I'll add you to the AutoMod list ASAP.

#**How do I win the game?**

THERE ARE NO WIN CONDITIONS! I felt that, if we did have 'wins' in this game, people wouldn't RP as their nation, and instead do whatever they could to dominate the world. Seriously, I don't won't people backstabbing friends they've got a strong relation with just so that they can 'win'. You can't win. 

If one preson does end up controlling a large portion of the map, it's likely that I might start a large rebellion in that country to level them out again. But I'd only do that if I feel they're trying to win the game.

#**Can I found a religion?**

You most certainly can! Just like nations, there isn't a cap on the amount of religions, but you should know that if you belong is a large religion group, it's likely that your brothers in faith will be more willing to protect you. If you want to spread your religion, say so in an RP post, and any results will be decided either by a Mod or the player of the nation you're converting. They may decide to resist btw.

Oh, and crusades are certainly a thing. Deus Vult!

#**Do I have to add cities?**

The City Map is definitely not overly important. I made it so that sieges and RP was easier for people to do. I still heavily recommend that you add around 2-4 cities to your nation, and more can be founded later. 

#**Who created this beautiful sub design?**

Even though I'd love to claim it, the sub design was made by /u/poom3619. Yes, that is the same guy who designed the /r/CBRBattleRoyale sub. He's pretty good, tbh.

#**I couldn't help notice the Colonization Flair. Is colonization a thing?**

Yes, it certainly is! I decided to leave most of the actual map blank, so that the New World is more unknown, and can add that extra bit of excitement when it's time to colonize. When you decide to settle a 'white tile', no matter how near or far it is, you use the Colonization flair. These don't require as much RP as other posts, but it would still be appreciated if you did.

As a basic rule, you can explore over deep ocean when you hit Astronomy. However, since this is heavily based on RP, so you could definitely go over deep ocean before that, just make sure you've got a good RP reason explaining why. If you are a Polynesia-style nation, then it should be pretty easy for you to explain it.

When you form a colony, make sure you give it some sort of colonial name, like 'New Spardshock' or 'Funlandian Barelands'. Colonies can decide to become independent from you. If a Mod decides that they've been separated long enough that they would want independence, and the strength of the colony plus their allies is equal or greater than their overlord's and their allies, then they're likely to declare independence. Once a colonial nation gains independence, they act the same as an NPC nation until a human player picks them up.

#**I still have questions!**

If you still have questions now, that's very understandable. Please say so below, and I'll add it to this Q&amp;A, along with it's answer.

Spardshock was once the largest and busiest city in the world. Flying cars would whizz by, and shops selling all kinds of exotic spices and herbs were seen everywhere. Their army was unparalleled, with lasertanks and laserswords and laserguns. Pretty much everything had lasers in it, far superior to the petty bows and arrows that their neighbours wielded. Only pity restrained them from taking over this entire planet.

Then, almost without warning, the bomb came.

A rogue general had declared a Civil War against the Rankers, the governing body of Spardshock. The war itself was terrible. Fathers killed their sons, and brothers fought till they had nothing more to give. That's the worst thing about Civil Wars; they rip families apart, never to be fixed again. Millions died that month.

But many more died with the bomb. The rogue general, realising he couldn't win, launched a nuclear warhead straight at the capital, Spardshock. It was the most destructive bomb ever seen. All of the First Nation was destroyed, incinerated instantly. Most people were dead before they even heard the explosions, but for those who did, the roaring seemed endless, with their ears almost exploding in agony. 

The only people who lived were the ones who hid.

Underneath Spardshock, the mutated people lived, gnawing on radiated chicken carcases and mouldy meat. These people, known as the Slum Rats, roamed the subways and bunkers in gangs, usually attacking any other gangs they met, sometimes even eating them in desperation. They needed a leader to unite them. And that leader would be The Orator.

The reason he would be their leader was for two reasons. One, because he was the least mutated out of all of them, but the second reason was more important. He was a very ambitious man. After seeing the fall of Spardshock, he knew that the survivors would have to rebuild their once great Empire. And, by discovering and creating new tunnels through the underground, he knew what he had to do.

He will make the world bend it's knee to his people.",CivWorldPowers,[EVENT] The Orator,https://www.reddit.com/r/CivWorldPowers/comments/4dq0ai/event_the_orator/

If you're from r/EmpirePowers or r/CBRBattleRoyale, then you are very familiar with the whole idea of RP and writing OC, but for those of you who are new to it, here's basically what you need to do. When you write a post about something in your country, you are no longer 'you'. You are now the leader of your country (not necessarily though), and you must write through his eyes, but don't write something really pathetic. Here's something you should and shouldn't do;

* DO THIS; Mob the Glorious looked upon the yellow splodge on his map with hatred flowing through him. Lurking had been exiled, but his legacy remained a thorn in his side. He knew he couldn't rest until his goal was accomplished; burn Venice to the ground, and salt the fields around it.

If you need a Mod to come to look over you're OC, then you can do so by saying 'Calling Mods' in the comments. **Please do not spam this, or any other AutoModerator command!!! It will result in being banned if you do it too many times!** You will need a Mod to come over when we need to decide the outcome of a certain event or OC, such as when you declare war on someone, a *neutral* mod will decide the outcome of the event. 

If you are:

* Going to be an active member of the community

* Fine with possibly being tagged a lot

* Willing to help out the person who tagged you with what they ask, short of anything crazy.

**Posting**

When posting something, make sure you flair your post with one of the following tags. Note that I did copy this from r/EmpirePowers, but I really like the concept of it, and I thought that it would be very useful in this sub:

• Event - for any event that does not fit under the other flairs.

• Meta - An entirely out-of-character post. Typically questions about the game, suggestions/complaints etc.

• Diplomacy - Diplomatic interaction with another country.

• Art - Used on meta days to post interesting art (paintings, portraits, commemorative paintings, artifacts, objects, replicas, music, poetry, stories, etc) that occurred in your nation during this time period.

• Colonization - Your attempt to colonize something, this includes hexes as far or near as you like. These don't need RP, just which hexes you want to claim and why you think you deserve them. If multiple people desire the same hex, it's up to them how to decide the matter, and until the situation is resolved it will be labelled as contested.

•War - A declaration of war on a country/political entity. Needs RP, either in the post or as a pre-post build-up.

•Battle - A battle between 2 or more belligerents. Contains strategy, troop types, movements, plans, replies from other belligerents, resolution by mod etc.

•Civil War - Rarely used by players and rather a tool for World Mods, Civil War is for a post announcing a civil war.

•Secret - A post whose contents remain unknown to you in-character. If you consider yourself mentally strong and capable of not (even subconsciously) using the knowledge you obtain from other people's secret posts when planning your own move then you're free to look at it. Otherwise it's generally advised to not open a secret post.

Almost all of these need RP, so make sure you get you're writing fingers ready.

**Date**

The date is 470 CE, And the months are May/June/July/August. Just to let you guys know, and I will be posting this on the sidebar and updating it every day.

**Last note on RP**

Remember, it's preferable if you post more OC than less. If you think you got a reason for having a large army, more money, declaration of war on another nation etc. then say it in a decently sized OC. If you don't think you can write something, and want to take a nap, I'm not God, so I can't physically stop you, but it doesn't really have to be amazingly long if you really are not up to it. Remember, it is a game, so make sure to be having fun!

Finding a crevice in the rockface, he scaled the cliff and swung into his palace again. Soldiers of all nationalites, seizing the opportunity of unclaimed riches in his palace, charged around, looting and roiting as they went. Men, with knives sticking from their backs, collapsed to the floor, their treasures being ripped from their hands. Smoke was rising from the dungeons below, hopefully meaning all the ERC prisoners had been burnt alive. Needless to say, it was utter chaos.

Mob knew exactly where he had to go first. There was something in his chambers he had to get, but without a disguise he would get spotted instantly. Creaping as low as he could, he sneaked behind a giant statue of himself. As a funland soldier ran by, his arms filled with gold, Mob stuck his leg out and tripped him up, then stabbed him in the back repeatedly as he fell. Mob dragged the body behind the statue, as scavengers greedily collected the golden coins the dead corpse had scattered.

After Mob stripped the corpse and put on his clothes, he ran up the main staircase, leaping two steps at a time. A man rolled down past him, screaming all the way down. Two men were punching and scratching at a old women, who refused to let go of a small statue of Mob. Mob himself was mostly left alone, mainly due to not being in possesion of anything valuable. He finally reached the top floor, where his chambers were. The fighting was thinner here, but it was still terrible to look at.

Suddenly, Mob was knocked to the floor by a blindly pumch from the side. He hit the ground hard, and his attacker was beginning to try to lift him over the balcony verlooking the stairs. Mob turned on his assailant and headbutted him in the face, forcing the man to recoil. The man swung a lazy punch in fury, but it was easily ducked under, and Mob used the man's weight to throw him over his shoulder. The man smashed through the wooden balcony and tumbled downwards, screaming with all he had. The screams were cut horribly short as the man's descent ended.

Mob continued onwards. More and more people had died, so by now there wasn't many people stopping him. He charged through the last of the fighting, and finally entered his chambers. It was a devestation. Both doors had been torn off their hinges and thrown around the room. The golden mosaics had been ripped from the walls and floors, and everything of value had either been smashed up or stolen. Dead men littered the room, with their blood splattered on the bare walls. He was only lucky that the room was deserted now.

*Oh my god...*

Mob was about to get what he came here for, when all of a sudden a man appeared by the doorway, almost by magic. Mob turned around, as he realised he knew the face on his bdy.

Since option 1 was voted pretty much unanimously in the last vote, that means we're scrapping our systems and stuff, and now all your stuff will be decided through RP. So, if you think there should be a reason your army should get bigger, tell us that reason through RP.

However, one thing that is on my mind is this; How do we decide on stuff which may have a certain value? (e.g Manpower, Income, Science etc.) I've got two ideas:

**1.** Use the Military/Infrastructure ratios we've discussed before to get accurate values.

**2.** Ditch any sort of system and just RP it, with a mod deciding on as accurate values as they can.

The pros and cons:

---

**1: Pros**

* It would make the game more fair and accurate.

* People who should be very poor won't be able to 'cheat' the game to become rich.

* Could add a more strategic influence on the game.

**1: Cons**

* It will probably take a while to fully complete a good system and explain the concepts of it to you guys.

* It could take away from the RP aspect of the game, and turn it into a thing where there are definitive ways to 'win' the game.

* Different values may be more powerful to have than others, giving certain nations advantages over other ones.

* It could possibly limit the type of posts we get on here, for example we might only be getting stuff like this:

""I claim these tiles, and I ally this nation. Declare war on those guys, because they are weak and I can roll over them.""

---

**2: Pros**

* It would encourage more OC and RP stuff to be posted on this subreddit, and the quality of it should be better as well.

* We could possibly get this game started in a matter of days if we opt to use this strategy.

* There would be no exact strategy to go by, meaning many different nations will choose to do many different playstyles.

* Subreddits similar to this like r/ColdWarPowers and r/EmpirePowers use this system, and it works quite well
**2: Cons**

* Due to human error, we could easily mess up some of the values and accidentally give one person an advantage.

* It may get a bit more chaotic, as there are no values somebody can just look at whenever they want and know exactly how much gold or military they have.

* Somebody could declare war on someone else, then find out that the other person would actually have a larger army than them.

* It could encourage people to RP their way to victory. What I mean is, if somebody posts more OC about their nation, they could gain an advantage over them.

He had been thrown off of his own palace, and had been impaled onto the Needles next to the sea, but since he was partly immortal he was still alive. Blood dripped along his face, and splashed onto the sand below. Then the tide washed up, and carried the red globules away into the ocean.

*drip drip drip*

Mob couldn't understand what he had done to deserve this. Those fucking bastards! How could they not realise what they have done? His citizens had been brought up to believe that his regime was the most perfect way of life there was, they certainly wouldn't transition to their petty governments as easily as they thought.

Governments. Democracy. Funland had fallen.

He couldn't let democracy take his beloved country. Everything he hated had overcome him; Lurking, Mallock, *the ERC*.  He had to get out. Mob struggled furiously, but he only slid further down the rock, widening the hole in his body. His spine began to crackle. Mob gasped in pain.

*drip drip drip*

Then Mob remembered. He and Shanic had discovered something very interesting in Gateon Port, something he had in his pocket right now. Slowly, achingly, he drew the flask out of his robe, filled with blood red ooze. With his hand shaking he ripped the cork off the top, and poured it all on the floor.

*drip drip drip*

A hissing sound came from the liquid, followed by the mist ominously lifting out. Mob choked on the smog. He began hacking up congealed blood, but he still smiled. *It's not over yet, Lurking!*

The mist departed, and there stood Mob the Glorious, as radiant as he ever was. He had both his hands, which he flexed with all his effort. The new Mob smiled, grinning in all the evilness the previous Mob had. Then he looked down on his creator. Blood was still spurted out of his body, and his spine was beginning to wriggle it way out through the middle. He looked hopeless.

""h...help me, Mob..."" Hacked Mob, every word sapping his life.

The new Mob walked over to him, looking at him curiously. Then, a grin began to spread across his face, as Mob pushed Mob further down the spike. Mob screamed in agony.

""Why should I help you?"" He asked innocently, ""You're pathetic! Our people doesn't need a *failure* to run them!""

""They won't let you back in..."" Breathed Mob.

""I'm not going back in!"" Spluttered Mob, ""This world is collapsing as we speak! This realm, this Besteros, is just a mistake. A practice. Just like you were."" Mob grinned triumphantly at his weak predecessor. ""Soon the rest of them will succumb to The End. I, instead, will become a million times more powerful than you ever were! Goodbye, Mob!""

And with that he kicked the dying man all the way down the spike. His screams filled the air, as his whole body ripped in two. As he breathed his last breaths, his new form walked down the beach, off to another land...

Mob looked down on the Sardinian wolves terrorising Bastia. They rampaged through the streets, taking what they wished from the people. *His people*. He knew that Reformer was quite the douchebag, but he didn't actually believe he had the guts to attack someone so much more stronger than him.

It didn't matter, the Sardinians played right into his hands. Mob decided to leave this place, for there was no more need of him staying here. He will return for Bastia, but right now that'll be too dangerous.

Instead he floated over to a small fishing village, located on the mainland of Italy. He hoped to persuade the people that they would be safer under his leadership, but there was one problem.

He was a ghost. And an aroused ghost at that.

The people rejected him, fearing that if they let him rule them then he would probably rape their children. They chased him with pitchforks and torches, and Mob decided to haunt the city for the moment. Soon stories spread across the village about ""Grasper the Over-Friendly Ghost"". They say that if you say his name three times in a mirror, he would appear into the room and cover you in his ectoplasm. It was pretty disgusting.

But Grasper (Mob's new name) didn't mind much. It was all part of his plan. He knew that if he carried it out successfully then he'll finally capture Reformer.

Venice was just way to irrelevant.

To any passer-by, it would almost look as if they were taking a gentle walk by the sea.

After an hour, though, they heard the sound of a bugle being blown behind them. They turned around, and saw a band of men around five hundred metres away charging towards them, crossbows loaded. The assasins were after them.

""*RUN!!!*""

They sprinted away, kicking up sand as they ran. Huffing and puffing, wheezing breaths, running as fast as their pumping hearts would allow them. Suddenly they reached a thick bundle of trees, and as they heard the shouts of people getting closer behind them, decided to duck into the foliage and cover themselves. For three minutes they crouched there, holding in any noise they made. But after a while, Wolf noticed something.

""What's that over there?"" He whispered, nodding towards the sea.

Indeed, there was some sort of boat coming towards them, with what looked to be two men on it. The boat floated closer, and soon the man sitting on top, with a face scrunched up in pure agony, was unmistakeable. It was Pie Lover!

""Pie! Get out of here! You're going to be killed!"" Hissed Faustie. 

""WOW! Faustie! Wolf! And... Mob? I'm so happy to see you! Please, get me off this fucking boat!""

""What did you say?""

""YOU'RE GOING TO BE KILLED!""

""I know! I would've killed myself any second! It really was the- *ftwang!*""

A bolt whistled through the air, slamming into the side of Pie's head. Pie stood standing, with a confused expression on his face, then slumped backwards into the sea n a massive splash. His body bobbed back up once, then sank to the bottom of the ocean. Steve continued to sit there, with a look of inane glee still plastered on his face.

""Holy shit..."" breathed Wolf.

The assasins walked into view. They were wearing a full-black costume, and state-of-the-art crossbows were slung onto their shoulders. One man was weilding his crossbow, clearly only having just used it on Pie, and after scanning the foliage slammed a bolt on a tree above them.

""They're over there, I heard them shouting before!""

Mob, Wold and Faustie were hauled out of their hiding space, and found themselves on their knees with crossbows pointed at their heads. It was all over.

""Any last words?""

""I have one,"" exclaimed Mob, with a grin, ""Can I get up and have one of your crossbows?""

The assasins looked at each other, confused. Then they nodded, and their leader replied;

""Sure thing, boss""

Mob got up, got a crossbow from one of the assasins and pointed it at the chest of Wolf. *I'm going to enjoy this...*

If the assassins didn't get them, some monstrous animal would.

""Guys, are you sure this is a good idea?"" Whispered Faustie

""Of corse it is! There's no way anyone will find us using this path, and it leads right into Gateon Port! We'll be back before you know it, and no one would even be hurt."" Exclaimed the ever-optimistic Mob.

""Yeah, no one will be hurt^^^/s..."" Replied Wolf, who still had a whole arrow sticking out of his body.

""Well, I meant to say no one would be *killed*. Hopefully...""

They trundled along, croaching through the undergrowth, sometimes having to gasp through what they hoped was mud. At last they broke out into a clearing, with sunlight punching them in the face after such a long trip underground. After a while of walking they arrived at a crossroads.

""Shit guys, which way goes to Gateon Port?""

""How the fuck are we meant to know? We might need to split up""

""Split up? That's the last thing you do in situations like this!""

""Yeah, but I'd prefer it if some of us were right than if all of us are wrong!""

""But what will happen to those who got it wrong?...""

No one wanted to think about that, but what had to be done was obvious. They split into two groups, with Shanic, Ludi and Octlu going left and Wolf, Faustie and Mob going the other. Their path led to the beach, which meant that if they followed the coast they should eventually arrive at Gateon Port! Faustie, being the one to figure this out, quickly told the others of what he found out, but this news was met with a grimace from Wolf;

""If we got it right, then the others...""

A scream sounding from a few miles away. Wolf and Faustie had a look of terror on their faces (Mob, as usual, just smiled).

He handed him a crumpled up note, which he quickly unravelled and read;

""Is it inside or outside the boat?""

""It's fucking outside the boat!""

""Hmm... is it... the sky?""

""No!"" Pie slumped in his seat. There were literally only two things outside that started with an S, and he actually couldn't get it.

""Tell me Steve, what can you see?""

""Um, I see some waves? Is it waves?""

""No, that dosen't start with an S! What do you *SEE*!""

Some were looking at the broken, distorted window, but most were looking at the body on the floor. An arrow was lodged at a horrible angle into his shoulder. Blood spurted onto his clothes, mixing in with the golden shine of his medals. It was the body of Sergeant Wolf.

""Holy Crap!...""

Mob looked out of the window again. The assassin had disappeared, but there was no knowing if he would come back again. With more people next time. They weren't safe here anymore.

""Ludi! Shanic, listen to me. It appears we're being hunted down.""

""No shit, Sherlock""

""Shut up! The killer will be back soon, we got to move. Are there any other ways out?""

""What do you mean?"" Asked Octlu frantically.

""I'm not going out that way,"" Mob jerked his finger to the front door, ""unless I suddenly feel the urge to become a human porcupine like Wolfie down there. Is there a back exit?""

""Well, there is a staircase behind the altar that leads to the party priest's balcony. It's used to address huge gatherings here. We could use that you escape.""

""Fine, I guess we move quickly. They could be back at anytime!""

The troupe knew what to do. They hurriedly ran to the far end of the cathedral, hoping to make an easy escape back to Gateon Port. As they were halfway there a cry was heard behind them, and as one they looked back. Sergeant Wolf was up, hobbling towards them with the arrow still in his body. Behind him still shouts were heard outside the building. The assassins were back. Wolf wouldn't make it in time.

""Fuck. Do we help him?""

""Shut up Mob, he's our friend! Come on lads!""

The Party Pals loyally rushed to their friend's aid. Mob looked on, unsure whether to risk his far superior life for Wolf. After much hesitation he ran back, and helped the rest of the gang haul him onto their shoulders and carry him as fast as they could to the altar. They were only halfway across when the first man reached the door, loading his bow with an inane look of glee in his eyes. The arrow fired, missing Wolf and his assistants by a long way. The pals ran faster, the arrow implanted in Wolf serving as a friendly reminder of what they don't want to happen. Another arrow flew, this time whistling right by Octlu.

""Fucking shit! I knew we shouldn't have gone back for him!""

""Shut the fuck up, Mob!""

""I'm a God, you can't tell me what to fucking do!""

""Can you two pack it in and run faster, please?!""

The staircase was not far now, but neither were the arrows. Bolts cracked into the walls in front of them, and shouts were being heard behind them. The men were closing in. Just as they reached the altar, a bolt gashed through Ludi's arm. He screamed and buckled over in agony. The formation nearly collapsed, but the rest managed to cover for their fallen compatriot. Ludi, still whimpering, caught up with them at the staircase, and as they went down a final bolt smacked into the wall above them. They rushed down, and Shanic turned and bolted the door behind him.

They managed to get away.

When they got to the balcony the man slumped to the ground. Casualties were quite severe, but quite amazingly no-one dead. They were exhausted, wounded, but still alive.

Wolf turned to Mob, a slight grin returning to his face.

Get that in your heads, otherwise this could confruzzle you*)

---

Mob had a splitting headache, probably something you'd expect after being knocked out. But on the plus side he was still alive. Upon waking up completely he found out that he wasn't even detained. Whoever captured him just dumped him on the side of a road somewhere, leaving him with only his clothes, some water, and his ever-present grin. After getting up, he decided to follow the road up a hill, on top of which he saw a temple. Maybe whoever was up there could help him?

Scaling the hill was not easy, especially since he felt like he was crammed in a box for hours, which was entirely possible. Upon reaching the top, he saw the temple mostly deserted, save for two figures discussing something at the far end. Mob began walking towards them to ask them where he was, but stopped dead in his tracks. One of them had seen him. 

He was Ludi, talking to his friend Octlu!

""Mob? Is that you? How in the heavens did *you* get here?""

""Ludi? What do you mean? Where even is this place?""

""Don't play the fool with me. We're on top of Sri Party! Octlu here just turned up to get me some food. Now, answer my question, how did you get here?""

""Me and Pie Lover were knocked out in Gateon Port by some assassins, and I woke up in a forest not far from here. I walked the rest of the way.""

Ludi looked alarmed, ""*What!* Where's Pie Lover?!""

Mob paused, unsure what to say. Ludi had always been a good friend of Pie, how would he react? ""I'm not sure where he is, Ludi""

Octlu gave him a face of suspicion, but Ludi, crestfallen, held some sort of glass ball, looking into it furiously. Finally he came back up, and with a heavy heart he said, ""He's right. Miror says that Pie's going to a better place""

Octlu looked horrified ""Holy shit, that means he's... he's...""

""Dead, I guess"" Said Mob, smiling as always.

Ludi, all of a sudden, screamed at Mob, ""Why the fuck are you smiling, Mob? Someone has just died, and you act like it's great! Fuck you!""

""Why the fuck are you *not* smiling? You're meant to be a Party Pal, the fun never ends with you guys!""

The argument was about to turn very sour indeed, had a whole parade of people entered the temple at that moment, singing *Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof* at the top of their lungs. Seriously, if they didn't come in at that moment, either Mob or Ludi might've died. That would've ruined the series, wouldn't it? Ludi gasped, not believing it.

""Sergeant Wolf! Faustie! And...""

""SHANIC!"" Screamed Mob with delight. He sprinted over to him, pulling him in a big bear hug.

""What's got you two so head over heels for each other?"" grinned Faustie.

""It's a bit of a long story, I'll fill you guys on it later. More importantly, why have you guys turned up?""

"" We've been invited by Ludi to celebrate Miror. B's Day with him,"" explained Wolf, ""And since I was in the area I decided to tag along.""

""What invitation?"" inquired Ludi.

""The one that you wrote, silly!"" laughed Shanic.

""I've never written any invitation. Show me the card!""

The three visitors handed their invites to Ludi. Ludi looked over them. Then sniffed over them. After giving one a little nibble, he confirmed that he never wrote any of these.

Faustie began getting freaked out. ""If you didn't write this..""

""...then who did?"" finished Mob.

Mob looked out of a window, making sure that no-one else was coming up. Obviously Ludi was playing a prank on them, being the natural Party Pal that he was. That probably explained why he said Pie was dead, and made a big show about not writing the cards, and why there was a man with a crossbow twenty metres outside the temple.

Wait, what the fuck?

An arrowed zoomed towards the temple, bursting through the window just barely a metre to Mob's left. As panic washed over Mob, he heard the sound of a body thumping to the floor behind him.

The love of his life had just agreed to marry him, and he was in an incredibly jovial mood. However, Shanic demanded that Mob stays in his office for the time being, since the people of the Party Pals no longer held the same trust of Mob as the last time he came here. 

So here they were, within the safety of Shanic's impressive office. He has obviously spent hours upon hours in this room, wooking diligently to bring about the greatness of the Party Pals, and the end of the Brotherhood. Mob watched as Shanic got back to doing his paperwork, which made him think. How much effort would it *really* take to run a people such as the Party Pals? Certainly not the amount of effort Shanic puts in now. So what was he up to?

""A lot of work to do, Shanic?""

""You won't believe how much there is. I've spent almost the whole week in this room, it's almost become a prison. Running a country is not as easy as it seems.""

""Shanic, I run a country as well.""

""Oh yeah. In which case you know what it's like!""

""Um, Shanic, You're the second-in-command here, right?""

""Yeah, that's right""

""Which means if something happens to Ludi, you'll run the Party Pals for him?""

""I guess so, although I never really thought about it. Whyd'cha ask?""

""I'm kinda afraid Ludi will throw me out if he finds me. But you'll be able to keep me safe, right?""

The worried face Shanic gave back did not fill him with confidence, but the fact that Ludi entered the room about 10 minutes later drained it completely. Ludi, upon seeing Mob, dropped everything he was carrying on the floor. Then picked them up again to throw them on the floor to show Mob how angry he was. To say the least, he was pretty pissed.

""What *are* you doing here, Mob!?""

""Fuck! Ludi, I can explain this, honestly!""

""Goddammit Shanic, why did you let him in!?! He's a maniac!""

""Well Ludi, I'm kinda... um...^^engaged ^^to ^^him""

""What did you *say!*""

""I'm...engaged to him, Ludi""

""What the fuck! Why did you do that, you idiot!"" Mob was seeing a new side of Ludi. He was acting more like, well, Mob.

""I love him, Ludi. He came over from Funland to propose to me!""

""Jesus Christ, Shanic, he's one of our enemies. I have a right mind to kill him here!""

Mob was a bit startled, but held his nerve. ""Ludi, I've got two things to say. One, I've got know fucking clue who this 'Jesus' is, and two, remember that we have been friends for a long time. You don't have to kill me, but if I must go then I will.""

Ludi stared vicously at Mob for what seemed like a millennia, but finally he responded, ""Fine, but I don't want to see your face around these parts for a long time!""

Hearing those words Mob became alarmed. How could he see Shanic again? He'd only just engaged to him, but know it seems like he won't see him again for a long while. Looking back at Shanic he could see that he was equally as distressed, but there was nothing to be done. Mob was foolish in thinking he was welcome here in the first place. Slowly Mob was marched out of the office by Ludi, and for the first time ever Mob's eyes become to hurt intensely, but he had no idea what that was meant to mean.

After the long and embarrassing walk out of Gateon Port, Mob finally came back to his **SS Smiling Ship*. Mob did not know how long it would be before he would return here. *If* he would return here, but it would not be anytime soon. As Mob began to embark his barque yet again, something caught the side of his eye. As he turned around, he saw what was happening. A dozen people, dressed all in black, quickly descended on Mob, Ludi and their guards. They very effectively took down all the guards, and as Mob tried to retreat he saw Ludi hit the ground hard. Before he could wonder if he died or not, something hard hit the side of his temple, and he collapsed into nothingness.

He was out before he even hit the ground.

Indeed, the last time he sailed on this ship it had been hundreds of years ago, when the ERC still stung his thoughts like a thorn, until Lurking and Mallock were cast out their pitiful homeland. Or at least should have. Fucking Mallock! He's ruining everything! The regime is close to collapsing because of that fucking dick-licker!

Anyway, soon his destination was reached, they didn't sail far after all. These were lands all to familiar to Mob, lands that he knew like the back of his (right) hand. These were the lands of the Party Pals. He knew his love would be here somewhere, he's known to be one of the most devout Optimists in the land. He spent the whole day looking for him, but with the Pals they could be absolutely anywhere. As the sun began to go down, Mob gave up. He sat down at the city centre, feeling slightly less happy than normal (don't worry, he was still ecstatic).

Maybe he had gone to another land to conduct business? If that was the case, who knew how long it would be before he meets him. Maybe it'll be weeks, maybe months, maybe even *years!* Maybe-

""Mob, is that you?""

Mob turned around, and couldn't believe his eyes! There was his love, looking more beautiful than ever!

""It is me indeed! Come, come, I desperately need to ask you something!""

""Sure, Mob, ask away. *Whats that!!*""

""What, my hand? Tis merely a scratch.""

""*A scratch!* Your arms off!""

""Meh. I'm pretty sure I can... *hand*-le it!""

They both laughed out loud, collapsing on each other's shoulders in hysterics. Mob felt is warm breath on his neck, which reminded him of why he came.

""Look, um... there's a reason why I came. It's because of you actually""

""Really? What's happened?""

""Lately, I've been thinking about you alot, because there's this question that's been haunting me for ages.""

""What is it Mob?""

Mob took a deep breath, and got down on one knee. ""Shanic, will you marry me?""

""Oh, *Mob!* I never thought you would ask! All this time I thought you were a man of one emotion, and that you could never love another man. But *yes!!* I will marry you.

And with that, they embraced as the sun went down. Mob never felt happier in his whole life. And now that his cause was complete, only one thought crossed his exuberant mind.

His messenger hinged at the door, obviously waiting uncomfortably for Mob's reaction. Maybe he wouldn't punch him this time? But luckily for him, Mob sent him out before he could spike him in the gonads.

This was because Mob felt something strange. A thousand years ago he would've been exuberant at the marriage between his allies, but now he felt something he didn't know existed. He never felt any other emotion except for happiness (and quite often anger) before, but this was strange. Was it anger? It kinda felt like it. Definitely not happiness, which was horrifying for him. Why didn't this make him happy?

Then he found the word for it. It was jealousy!

Yes, Mob knew that he would never be loved. For his whole life he didn't seem to care, he just punched whoever disagreed with him. His subjects disagreed to begin with, so he executed them. Mallock disagreed, so he stabbed him in the chest. Nowadays it seemed like the whole world wanted to see him burn, but it never bothered him. Fuck those guys. 

Mob had always thought that happiness was all a man needed in his life to be happy, but he needed more than that. He needed a soulmate. The one he longed for his whole life.

He knew desperately who he wanted to be with. But didn't know if he wanted him back. Could he see past all the ruthless genocides and murders, and the forced dictatorship on billions of people, to see that he was a pretty decent guy?

He had to find out. While he waited for his ship to be prepared, he punched a hundred captured ERC citizens to make him feel better, then boarded his *SS Smiling Ship*.

For the whole carriage drive home he hid himself behind the door, avoiding the suspicious looks from his cheerful subjects. He knew what they were thinking, for news like this spreads quickly. *He lost his hand*, *Gods don't bleed*, *Do we have to keep smiling?*. His citizens have already begun to doubt him, and it's all because of that fucker Mallock! Why couldn't he have just stayed dead in the first fucking place?! It's not like he has a home to go to anymore, he made sure to burn and loot his house. Why the fuck does he dare defy him!

Within a few hours, the driver pulled up into the palace, which Mob hurriedly ran to, avoiding the crowd of people glaring from outside, the same thing swirling around their heads. *Is he a god?, is he a god?...*

He decided that, to set things straight, he must deliver a speech to his people. Within a few hours a large crowd had gathered outside his palace, waiting in an ominous silence. Soon Mob approached onto his balcony, wearing that trademark grin and, in replace for a hand, wore one of the most incredible things any of the people have seen. A steel guard was wrought  into a flowing, spectacular design, decorated in pictures of Mob purifying the land. Jewels studded it, so much so that sunlight was reflected off it in an entrancing array of colour. But, most interesting of all, was the long, steel spike pointing out of the end of it, seemingly capable of stabbing through someone's skull completely. The people couldn't believe it.

Mob had created one of the most powerful weapons they've ever seen.

""My loyal subjects, many of you may have heard rumours that the fucking bastard known as Mallock bested me in a fight, and that he cut my hand of. Some simpler-minded people among you may even question my divinity. But here I am to show you what a God can do! By losing a part of my body, I have replaced it, more powerful and deadly than ever before! No blow can hit me now, and no armour can reflect the crushing blow of my spike. Mallock may believe he bested me, but by making him believe himself stronger than me, he has made me unbeatable!

At this the crowd roared, the first time they have done so without being prompted to at gunpoint.

""My fellow Optimists, the Grizzlies of the north are buckling underneath our might, the ERC have already buckled, and many more shall soon realise the power of Funland! I tell you now, before a year is past, the whole world will fly the flag of the most Glorious Leader!""

At this the crowd finally realised just how awesome and godly their leader was, and pumped with adrenalin they rushed to join the army for the war against the Bearpunchers. And Mob, who managed to not kill someone for a whole OC, prepared for the next time he faced Mallock.

**Leader:** The Orator

**Lore:** The city of Spardshock was once the eye of the world, weilding technology not seen by anyone in the world, and weapons known only as 'lightsabers'. However, trouble began when the power corrupt Mao Zedarth, one of the members of the Rankers, who in turn ruled Spardshock, got pissed at the government and so began what would become the Civil War that ended the Golden Age of Spardshock. Over time Mao Zedarth become stronger and stronger, until the fight was brought to Spardshock. Thousands attempted to flee, and others went down, seeking refuge in bunkers built deep under the city. Then, at the climax of the war, Mao Zedarth launched a nuke directly at Spardshock, wiping out all of the old empire, and leveling Spardshock to the ground. Those who tried to flee died instantly, but it was those who went down that suffered the most.

The radiation of the bomb had affected them severely. They became hunched over and bruised. Thick, long bristles grow out of their backs, whilest their teeth became horribly deformed, jutting out at weird angles. Their feet elongated dramatically, and, after a week of eposure to the radiation, claws grew out of their fingers, and the bristles covered the rest of their body. In short, they became monsters, and they would've attacked the world had their skin not've become incredibly weak, so the sun irritated their skin so much that too much time in the sun could kill one of these people. They were known to the 'outsiders' only as 'Slum Rats', but many passed them as myths.

So, because of this, they now spend much of their time roaming the vast underground complex of Spardshock, forming little communities and vicously competing with each other in the complete darkness of the depths. At night, They would ascend to the streets, roaming in packs through the desolate ruins of Spardshock, looking for any radiated food they can scavenge. People from the outside world soon learned never to go their, for tales of the terrifying monsters that appeared at night detered even the most hardy of travelers.

Their leader is a man only known as 'The Orator', partly because he was a confident man who could deliver powerful speeches, but mainly because he wasn't as horribly deformed as everyone else. However, he was an extremely shady character, and many people didn't know whether to trust him or eat him. But, for the time being, they stay by themselves, and if any foolish traveler enters their domain of Spardshock, then they will enjoy a good feast that night...

Mo hated this place. Everywhere he looked he saw fists flailing and gamblers watching the fights in excitement or terror. Not a single person here had an honest job, and, despite what President Solar told him beforehand, he could see hatred sparking out of people's eyes, and fists balled - ready for the next fight. The world has labelled Mob as the criminal, but if they could see what he could then they would understand. Mob has created a Utopia, where everyone smiles and crime rate is almost at a zero, but everyone seems to think that the Isles of Rum was a better nation, simply because of stereotypes. And a little bit of harmless genocide.

But Mob had to control his urges to order his bodyguards to attack, for he had to remember why he came. He was here to see the famous Oracle, which apparently managed to tell you the future. Also Mob needed a little bit of quick cash to support his ever-growing army, and hoped to solve that here to. Once Mob arrived at the Oracle, he immidiately skipped pass the massive queue (he was one of the most powerful people in the world) and entered the Oracle. An old, fat sailor who was having a session with her was thrown out, and several priestesses, realising who he was, fainted and/or vomited. One fainted and landed in her vomit, face-first. But there was an old women who neither fainted nor vomited, she simply smiled. She was the Oracle.

""Lady, I have come because you can... apparently tell me my future. I've just declared war with the Bearpunchers, and I need you to tell me what happens!""

For a minute, no-one spoke. Then the Oracle tilted her head up and replied, ""Mob, Miror. B welcomes you to this place. He has been waiting to speak to you, because you have forgotten who you are.""

""What the fuck are you on about? I'm Mob the Glorious, Emperor of Funland! It's would be a little hard for me to forget that, wouldn't it?!""

""You must know that Miror does not like to speak straight with his people. If he were to do that, then we would be able to achieve statuses of Gods, then what is to become of Miror? No, I tell you now that if you want to hear what is to be said, then you must be willing to listen. Will you open your ear to Miror?""

The priestesses who didn't drown in their own breakfast noticed something spectacular. Mob opened his mouth to respond, but clamoed it shut, responding with a simple 'Yes' in the process. Mob, the Embodiment of Joy itself, had been silenced by an old women. The room fell into an awed silence, for someone who can subdue Mob the Glorious is someone who must have powers beheld by Miror. B. 

""Mob, The world will soon be embroiled by a conflict that has not been witnessed since the time of Forgie and Cossack. Two, massive military pacts will join, fighting against each other for a century. The winner of this war will align themselves to rapidly gain an empire so wide even Lord Gaben will shudder. Which nation it will be I cannot tell, but if it were to be you then the problems of this world will get even larger, not calmer. Miror. B implores that you cease your maniacal warfare immidiately, or your fate will be sealed.""

""What fate, woman?""

""Listen carfully, Mob, for this prophecy will be decided by your actions. *A man will rise out of the ashes, and challenge your mighty empire. You will meet on the battlefield, him with a broken sword and you with the mark of the devil. He will be clothed in vests of gold, and will end your life with Miror's own needles. He shall inherit your lands, and you shall inherit his grave, where you shall walk with chains around your legs forever.* Is this the outcome you want, Mob? If you stand down now, it shall be averted, but it is sealed the moment you pick up your sword.""

Mob stood up. Was this war worth fighting? Moments passed until he finally made his decision. He went up to shake the Oracle's hand in thanks, signalling his acceptance of her advice.

Then he pulled her to the ground and started kicking her to death.

""HOW... FUCKING... DARE YOU... SAY THAT I AM DOOMED... I AM A GOD! I WILL NOT DIE... THE BEARPUNCHERS WILL DIE JUST LIKE YOU WILL!""

And with that last word, Mob unsheathed his sword and cracked open the Oracle's skull, spilling her brains out on her own sacred temple. The priestesses who didn't vomit before definitely did now, but Mob didn't waste any time getting the real reason he ws here: Money.

""Guards! Loot this place! Take all of the money this fraud has stolen! Kill the priestesses so they can't inform anyone about what happened!""

""But sir, did you not hear the prophecy! *A man will rise out of the as*-""

""I SAID LOOT THIS PLACE, IDIOT! Nothing that this shit said is going to happen! We will conquer the Grizzlies just like the ERC.""

""But what will Solar think? Didn't you just kill his most treasured person in his kingdom?""

Mob smiled. This is how he got rid of troublesome people.

""No, because when this Oracle started speaking heresies about me, you got angry and killed her, along with all her priestesses. We just managed to hold you down, and when you get handed in they'll kill you for murdering their Oracle. And the Oracle also likes to keep her money in a bank outside the city. You got that?""

The guard was horrified, but as he tried to speak the Marrican Police ran in. The Funland guard's life will soon reach a tragic end...",CBRBattleRoyale,Mob's visit to the Oracle,https://www.reddit.com/r/CBRBattleRoyale/comments/48ysfi/mobs_visit_to_the_oracle/

I've put up with alot of shit recently, being called stuff from 'backstabbing', 'pus-spitting' and 'genocidal'. To say the truth, I would prefer to be all three of these things than be a plotter who lurks in the darkness. I think we all know that those who have power do not need to plot, so the people who have decided to set up this 'secret' coalition against me certainly can't have much power. What do you have to say about this, Draxiad?

To be honest, I would never have suspected that, of all the people who hate me, that it would be the *Draxiad* to start the coalition. I've never said a word of hate against your nation, quite the contrary in fact. I've always backed your nation ever since FOUKOB was created, and I wuld've been willing to carry on backing it if you didn't decide to be the ringleader in my coalition. Couldn't you have, like, *tried* to use diplomacy first, instead of immidiately thinking secret plotting was the way to go? Seriously, did it just take a few simple requests from me to turn your empire to hate? 

No matter, your coalition won't do shit against me. I always thought that the problem with you guys is that your too nice. Your continent is way too divided, you're all willing to settle with what you've got. That's why the Power Rankings say, on average, nations on our continent fair better than your ones. All the top 5 can be found over here. So, if you want my advice, stop plotting and declare your war already. I would prefer to fight against warriors than massacre librarians and grocers.

Be warned that our empire has the strongest military in the world, and all who oppose the Dictatorship will have a hard time bringing us down!

To the Bearpunchers, Vesperia and all you other scum who join them, your coalition will not stop my mission, only delay it. My first act is that I demand all nations willing to cooperate to execute all citizens of the former ERC culture, or at least give them up to me. Failing to do so will result in becoming an enemy of Funland. Lurking my have escaped my clutches a third time, but working together we can destroy all that he created and nurtured.

This includes Venice, Lurking's hometown. SHADE has commited the highest crime against Funland of not burning down this city as soon as they got it, and for this they must be punished. I strongly advise all of you intelligent nations to denounce them for keeping such a sinful place alive.

And I end with a big thanks to the Bearpunchers who thoughtfully built a Clown College in their empire prior to my immidiate take-over. I tell you now many Funland citizens will be happy to learn in one of your colleges.

So maybe something like:

Manpower = Manpower ratio + Number of tiles x 1/2

Infrastructure = Infrastructure ratio + Amount of gold spent on Infrastructure x 1/2

and maybe 200 Infrastructure points gets you a new level (and every time you level up you get population, a cargo ship/caravan, a missionary, a social policy and a tech)

And also something very important is religion. I need everybody to tell me what religion they are following. You can either found your own one, follow someone else's one or split your empire into diferent religion/secular. Choose what is best for lore, if you are a trade nation you are likely to follow many different religions, if you are  not particularly religious then you should follow someone else's. Missionaries can be used to convert a 3x3 hexagon to your religion, as an FYI, so if you are militaristic then you will likely get converted pretty quickly. And also, you may be wondering what will be the point of religions? I'm thinking you can call crusades and maybe get some special bonuses if your religion becomes quite dominant?

Imagine what incredible things we can do if we only offer our hands in friendship, rather than draw our swords on the battlefield.

To further improve our trust, and to prevent any unfortunate backstabbing, I have a solution that will make us the greatest of friends. Each of us will put a considerable amount of money into a neutral bank, and then if one of us were to attack the other then the defendant will have the rights to the money, and be able to put down the military of the opposition. This way there will be a strong incentive to cooperate.

Also, with this alliance, we both have just one front we need to focus on, unlike many other nations. This will give us a large advantage, and so we will gain much more from an alliance rather than a war?

The Siege of Venice was due to begin any moment, and he had to get down to Dvin as quickly as possible. He didn't leave Shanic completely on his own, for he granted Steve the Funland Guard a mission to accompany him, and was sure that Steve would bring the Brotherhood to justice.

Mob decided to spend one last night in his palace. He had spent way too much time travelling, and it was a long time since he was able to stay in one place for more than a few weeks. In the morning, he rode the fastest Mongolian horse he had, and got to Dvin that afternoon. The reforms that were happening in this city was extremely fast. Already the walls were built, high and mighty, around the once open cities of the ERC, and every person wore smiles on their faces. It was just like a dream come true for him!

He met up with his generals, and began discussing stuff.

""Mob, the **Venesia Delenda Scheme** [see Funland subreddit] is already underway! The ERC citizens have lost many of their rights, and the camps are being built as we speak.""

""Most Glorious Leader, the SHADE occupants of Venice are very undermanned, and a siege on Venice should be swift and glorious!""

""Your Majesty, due to our great allies of the Party Pals blockading the Shadow Dragons in their homeland, reinforcements will take ages to arrive, but once they do they will put up a fight.""

The discussions went on for ages, but decisions were made quickly since Mob is a dictator and whatever he says happens. In the evening, he went out to the Dvinnish coastline, and watched the sun turn the sky dark red. If Mob believed in omens, he would be sure the gods were forecasting the bloody war that would happen imminently. But no god could deter him. He is a God! The very embodiment of Joy!

A very big personal issue has occurred which could delay the start for a bit depending on how much help I can get. Just so you know, here is a list of what we need to get done before we start:

1. **Updating the Map** - the map needs to be updated with everyone's start locations, plus I'm thinking about ironing out a few details in the design and make it larger. I will also need the colour that you guys want to be used for your country fill (e.g in civ 5 Russia is dark yellow, England is red and Portugal are white. You have to tell me what colour you want).

2. *Military/Infrastructure ratios** - a lot of you have done this already, but if you haven't then make sure you inform me what your ratios are (and also, these ratios aren't set for life. You can change them anytime you want during the game).

3. **Capital City Names** - I'll be needing your capital city names for the map. Other city names are optional, but not necessary (if for some lore reason you don't want a capital city that's alright).

4. **Passage of Time + Start Era**

Two very important aspects. Passage of time is how much Time passes in the game for every IRL day. We could either do it like /r/EmpirePowers and do:

* Monday - Meta Day (rest day for Mods to catch up on stuff)

* Tuesday - January/February/March/April

* Wednesday - May/June/July/August

* Thursday - September/October/November/December

* Friday - January/February/March/April

* Saturday - May/June/July/August

* Sunday - September/October/November/December

EDIT: had a different idea, but this one is definitely better.

And as for the start era, I'm leaning towards start of Medieval, but we could start in the Classical or Renaissance as well. What do you think?

They weren't civilised enough to defend themselves, and now I will do something I've been wanting to do for a long time. It is a project me and my generals have been working on, and it is known as the '**Venesia Delenda Scheme**'. It works by slowly placing more and more extreme acts to deal with the ERC scum that populate our lands. This list goes from the acts we will pass, from first to last.

1. **Native Segregation Act**

This act basically states that it is illegal for ERC citizens to get well-paid jobs, good accommodation, and it will cost more to go to schools. Any crimes a Funland citizen does to an ERC citizen will be treated less harshly, but if an ERC commits a crime they could be punished by death.

2. **Citizen Accommodation Arrangement**

ERC citizens will be moved out of their homes, and placed into ghettos, in which they can still go about daily business, but massive walls will be built around the compound, and they will not be receiving much resources from the outside. Funland citizens will be given amazingly paid job positions to move into the ERC territory and replace the natives.

3. **Dvinland Removal Plan**

This act will start the process where we begin taking the citizens inside the ghettos, and transport them to specially made concentration camps, where they will work the mines and stone, and do lots of manual labour, until we decide to kill them. We will transport the least valuable people first, and leave those who are specially talented to keep on providing stuff for us. 

3. **Ghetto Extermination Act**

This is where we get rid of any people left. We will move large armies to each ghetto, and one by one exterminate every ERC citizen inside these places. All people still alive inside the camps will be killed as well. Within a week, we are aiming for every single ERC citizen left in this world to be dead. Not only will we get rid of our most hated enemy, but we will also give our troops excellent military exercise, which will make them much more effective when the time for combat happens.

Each man had different thoughts troubling them, but all were about death and war. Reformer couldn't help thinking that Mallock could've been accompanying them right now, if Mob didn't so thoughtlessly kill him. Mob and Shanic were both working out what they would do with the assasin once he was caught. And Steve was thinking if he could make eat something different to pickles and marmite tonight.

They arrived at the ship, and swiftly boarded it, brandishing their various weapons. Bursting into the lower deck, they found a drunk bastard singing to himself, seeming almost blissful. That wasn't to last long.

"" Stand up, you fucking bastard!"" Yelled Mob

""Wha... I didn't do it papa...**

*Whack*. The man crumpled from a knock-out blow, delivered by Shanic.  The various men walked back, with a large range of profanities coming from Mob and Steve carrying the unconscious body, back to the palace and down into the cold, dark dungeons. A terrifying eruption of laughter came up from below, and abruptly ended as Mob closed the door behind him.

---

""Wake up, you shit-eating bastard""

The man's eyes fluttered open, and groggily he stared at Mob with disdain.

""You! Your meant to be dead!""

""Well, I might have been killed if you didn't put so much trust into a guy you just recruited. Shanic, you say this man is part of the Brotherhood?""

""Indeed. We've yet to uncover much about them, but Randalf here will surely tell us some juicy stuff"" Shanic said, revealing himself to the assasin he called Randalf.

""How could you Shanic? I thought we had something special!""

""We may have been good friends, but your allegiance has forced me to give you up to Mob""

Randalf loomed at Shanic, completely heartbroken. Tears were welling up in his eyes, for he never thought that his friend Shanic would betray him like this.

""Enough of this idiocy,"" Mob the Glorious spluttered, ""tell me what this 'Brotherhood' is trying to achieve.""

""Fuck you, Mob""

The room went silent. Reformer groaned. Everyone except Randalf could see what was about to happen.

""What the *fuck* did you say? WHAT DID YOU SAY!? If you're going to dick around with me like that, then I'll dick around with you!""

Mob drew his dagger, grabbed Randalf by the throat and pulled him up, glaing into his eyes. Randalf could feel the heated moisture flaring out of Mob's nose.

""Let's dick around then, Randalf""

Mob plunged his dagger straight through Randalf's private parts, ripping through it and coming out the other side. Randalf screamed in agony, which every man in the room (except Mob) could feel as well. Steve the guard vomited.

After 20 minutes of listening to Randalf sob, Mob began the interrogation again.

""Let's try again, and if you try anything else your testes will not be attached to your body anymore. What is the aim of the Brotherhood?""

""We're trying to overthrow all the leaders in the world. At least that's what I was told. Please don't stab me again!"" Sobbed Randalf, still feeling the pain.

""And that's why you tried to kill me. Hmm. Where does your leaders have their meetings?""

""That'll be in the Kingdom of Fire and Ice. We're a group based heavily on the elements, and so having our HQ there made the most sense. We've got a large gathering in Valyria, since it is the great volcano that started the Days of Ruin. One day we shall bring about a fiery, everlasting summer, just you wait Mob!"" Randalf's voice was getting more frantic now, almost panicky in fact.""

""And what is the name of your leader?""

""His name is... His name is Pr- BLARGH!""

Randalf began pulsating. His body was beeping, and his eyes went dark red. Suddenly, he exploded in a grand display. Steve vomited again, which on the plus side meant he didn't have to eat any pickles tonight. Shanic noticed something curious with Randalf's eye, and whilst avoiding the guts on the floor, walked over and picked it up. Thee was a round camera-like object in the pupil. Someone was watching them, and kills Randalf before he could give away too much.

They had been watched. And laughed at.

""GOD FUCKING DAMMIT! HE FUCKING EXPLODED!"" Screamed Mob, in his usual self.

The battles around the four men suddenly stopped.

Mob the Glorious.

Doge Fitz.

King Reformer.

And *Darth Mallock* himself.

""What are you two doing here?"" Mob asked instantly.

""Mob, I don't know what are the intensions of these two, but there's one thing I know,"" Fitz said, and pulled out a sword, ""that you are getting to my beloved city only over dead body.""

""I couldn't have hoped for more,"" Mob said, unsheathing his sword.

Their swords met, but Fitz didn't last long. He fell to the ground after Mob had hit him in the leg with his sword. 

""Any last words, bastard?""

""ERC...will always...go on.""

KAthunk

The soldiers ready to hold the breach twitched as Doge Fitz's lifeless head rolled to the ground.

""It is done. Men, attack the breach and take the city. Kill anyone who's suspicious in the least,"" Mob said to his men, and they charged at the breach.

""Now, the two of you. What the living fuck are you doing here? Where have you been, Mallock?""

""I was locked up in a prison, but I got out, thanks to some well-placed friends. But what are you doing? This city is mine! You can't just rape it and burn it down!""

""Well, it isn't yours anymore. You can be the new mayor of it or something, the previous one just kind of died.""

""In your hands, Mob! Don't you ever stop to think? For once? You're going against my will! This is absolutely ridicolous! Pull your men back at once!""

""Or you will do what?""

Mallock took out his sword.

""Unlike Doge Fitz - he's the man you just killed in cold blood, in case you didn't realize - I am a skilled swordsman. Pull your men back at once, or there will be consequences.""

Mob looked at Mallock for a moment. He glanced at Reformer, too, who seemed absolutely proturbed. 

""No."" Mob said, swinging his sword at Mallock at full power. Mallock barely blocked the hit.

Their swordfight went on for quite a while. Reformer merely watched in utter horror, as his two friends exchanged hits.

Then, Mallock's sword dropped to the ground, and Mob pushed Mallock away, to the ground. Mallock tried to get up, but Mob pushed him down. Mallock gasped for air.

""Is this...how it ends?"" Mallock said breathlessly. ""Is this what I survived all those things for? Is this why I faced hell before? Tell me, Mob!""

Mob merely looked at him.

""You are going to kill me here now, aren't you? In front of my own city? Is this who you are?""

Mob continued to stare at him.

""Just do it already. This has already failed miserably, why don't you take it to the end? Just end me.""

Mob looked at him. Then at Reformer. Then, he raised his sword...

... and plunged it deep into Mallock's body. Mallock's eyes glassed over, and his breathing intensified. Blood pooled up inside his mouth, and Mob unsheathed his sword from his body. Sir Mallock, Doge-Re of Dvin and Leader of Nuova Ragusa was no more.

Mob looked at his friend Reformer, who stood there, shocked.

'Come on then, don't dither there, we got a city to capture!'

The battle raged back on, but it was clear that the Dvinnish army was demoralized and it wouldn't be long until it crumbled under Mob's military prowess. Reformer continued to be at loss at to what to do. What had happened to his friend?

He was temporarily the leader of Dvin, and with so much power Mob couldn't help but ask 'what could go wrong?'

""Most Glorious Leader, the Horse-Rapist has laid claim on Dvin! The people see him as their proper leader, and have thrown out the Funland supporters. What shall we do?""

What. The. Fuck?

Mob the Glorious did not expect this Doge to stand up to him like this. His blood began to boil, and with the largest smile planted on his face he shouted:

""WHAT THE FUCK, STEVE! HOW COULD HE EXPECT TO STAND UP TO A MILITARY THE SIZE OF OURS? WE WILL STRIKE AGAINST THIS SCUM IMMIDIATELY! GATHER THE FORCES, STEVE, WE MARCH SOUTH!""

And with that, Mob lead his military on the long trek south. Well, he lead them by giving orders to the general every hour. You think he would actually go all the way down south by himself? He just went on a massive trip, and he was kind of tired. However, he was sure that his army would prove themselves yet again. The Dvinnish army was demoralised after the collapse of their democratic ways, and the Funland army was known to be the most joyfully destructive army their ever was.

And anyway, what damage can a horse-fucker do?

---

Each nation will have a Military to Infrastructure ratio, which you decide based on how warmongery/peaceful you are. The two numbers on either side must add up to 100. So if you set it to 75:25, for every 75,000 military men you train you get 25 Infrastructure Points (more on that later). Here are what each side will give you:

* Military - Gives you an army/navy/air force to defend or attack other people. Is needed so that you can protect yourself. The higher the ratio is, the more manpower you get (I'm thinking thatthe larger empire you get the more manpower you get as well. Think Russia).

* Infrastructure - Gives you buildings where you can expand your cities, growing your economy and tech. Is needed to keep yourself up with the rest of the world politically. The higher the ratio, the better you are at science, trade, population and culture.

-

Military is kind of obvious, so I will instead explain Infrastructure. Instead of constructing actual in-game buildings (that'd be too complicated), each town will have an 'Infrastructure Level'. The higher your ratio on Infrastructure is, the quicker it gets filled up. Every time a city ranks up to a higher Infrastructure Level, the science, gold and culture output of the city will increase, as well as it gains 1 citizen. The cost of each infrastructure level will increase the higher you get.

Definitely not as terrifying as the savage, ten metre tall Tickle Monster that was being lowered into said cage. The crowd watch in joyful suspense, for none of them had ever seen what death by Tickle Monster actually was like. They were about to find out.

Lurking, as shady as ever, watched the beast in horrified disbelief. Mob looked further at him, wondering why he was acting so afraid. This would normally be the part where Lurking would announce his grand escape to the vast audience before him, not sniffling like a baby. Well, thought Mob, better not waste the opportunity. He was looking forward to the death of his most hated enemy.

Within minutes the Tickle Monster was in the cage, snarling in it's blood-curdling high pitched voice. Mob stood up, with the animal still restrained, and addressed the audience; 

""Greetings, loyal and joyful citizens! Today we have triumphed, for the worst enemy of Funland, the scum known as Lurking, has been captured, trialled and, now, executed. From Disneyland to the occupants of Smilewood Forest, I'm sure you can all agree that today is a day of glory. The ERC has faltered, and the world has been shaken. Today, we have captured the citizens of the ERC, tomorrow our actions will capture the minds of every noble, villain and commoner in the realm! Be proud to be called Funland, for in the future, when charts have been written of us, they will remember this day as the day when Funland became powerful. Today will be the day that Lurking dies!""

Eruptions of joy boomed throughout the crowd, resounding backwards and forwards like two crashing waves of pure happiness. Before the crowd even died down, the Tickle Monster broke off his chains, and lunged towards Lurking's hapless body.

What happened next both disgusted and intrigued the crowd. The monster ripped off Lurking's shirt, grabbed him round the armpits and began furiously tickling him, faster and faster like a weaver on a loom. Lurking could not contain himself. He roared with laughter, banging on the floors of the cage. His cheeks went red as the blood gushed to his head. His smile grew wider, wider than any smile the citizens had ever seen before. It grew so wide that it actually touched both eyes at it's corners. Then, the gums began to bleed from all the excessive sudden strain on his facial muscles. Blood poured out of his mouth, spluttering out as Lurking laughed in agony. The echoing, painful laughter grew incredibly loud, so loud that the cows in their fields outside of Mob's Palace turned their heads in puzzlement, smiling away as usual. Lurking clamped his mouth shut, gripping his face to keep himself from laughing. Then something truly horrible happened. His neck got wider and wider, as did his cheeks. His face filled up with bile and blood, and bright red blood spontaneously spurted from his eyes. Any person who faces the Tickle Monster must know that you never, under any circumstances, clamp your mouth shut, because then something worse happens.

Your head explodes, and flies off your body.

Lurking's head zoomed up in the air, summersaulting several times, and landed on the floor. Lurking was no more.

-

Or so mob thought. As he approached the head, it had suddenly transformed into a completely different person, one that was aged and grey. Mob realized quickly what had happened. Lurking used his magic, made someone else look like him, and escaped off to some other god-forsaken city. The ERC may be his, but Lurking has trickle through his clutches again, like the shadow his is.

After hours of blindly rage, Mob sat down to think where Lurking could've gone. Obviously they couldn't be too far away, otherwise they wouldn't have got Lurking in time. They would also have to be friends with Lurking. A TOPOIS member? The Party Pals perhaps? Or, possibly someone completely different. Whenever he went to TOPOIS, he always noticed there was a member called REDACTED. So this member would probably be someone they feel wouldn't be safe if they announced it publicly. *Maybe because they are also part of FOUKOB*. So, there could be a traitor in FOUKOB then, but who? Possibly someone who joined recently, wanting to get the secrets of FOUKOB's Intel, and gain FOUKOB's trust. And, possibly, someone who helped Lurking escape before...

Suddenly Mob exploded out of the room, wanting to sail to his destination as fast as possible. The Funland delegate, a Clown from a Town of Frowns, asked Mob where he was off to. Mob wasted no time replying.

""To the land of the Shadow Dragons. It seems like we'll meet King Reformer along with who really should've died today""

Reformer just stood there, gobsmacked. 

Mob the Glorious didn't waste any more time. Bursting into the emperor's throne room, he stood there breathless for a moment, with all eyes watching him. Then, with power in his voice, said;

""I need your fastest dragon!""

When Mob explained everything to Kazan, he completely agreed with Mob, and called for the finest Shadow Dragon to give Mob a ride back to Funland. Mob was guided to the fields were the Dragon was, and with a SHADE dragon rider leading it, the Dragon took off at an incredible speed. The journey on the dragon was tremendous! It was going faster than Mob had ever dreamed it could, and they flew so high the people below could barely be seen. On the way back they passed over ERC lands. *My lands* Mob thought with glee, and he could barely contain himself when he looked over to see the lands he had fought for twice, and which were now his.

In less than one hour, Mob had made it back to his palace. A troop of soldiers, not expecting his arrival, hurriedly formed a procession line, and the welcome back was what Mob had always wished it to be; Glorious. He called for Prophet Uranium, and the powerful man quickly ran over.

""What do you desire, my glorious leader?""

""I'm making a speech, right now. Link me up to all the other towns. I have something to say""

Uranium wasted no time. He ran to the resident wizard and told him what needed to happen. In almost no time Mob was being broadcasted across Funland, and curious citizens gathered around their screens, wandering what could be so important that Mob didn't even warn them a screening was taking place. Millions were gathered around their town centres, waiting for Mob to begin his speech. And when he did, they did nothing to stop the happiness exploding out.

""Most loyal citizens, I bring news that our war with the ERC scum has proved victorious! We now control half of the ERC as our vassal, but more importantly Lurking has become our prisoner! His execution will take place in less than 24 hours.""

Here is a creation template. You can use this to create your empire, or you can make a block of text. Whatever floats your boat:

**Name:** The Dictatorship of Funland

**Leader:** Mob the Glorious

**Lore:** (*can be as long as you want, but we're looking at quality over quantity here*) The Dictatorship of Funland is one of the newest factions in the realm, but certainly not one with the smaller history. It's roots run deep into the annals of history, beginning the same time as the Party Pals, for that is where Funland emerged. /u/Mob_cleaner was on board the ship that the Party Pals took, and experienced it's crash. And, like the rest of the men on that ship, he settled down in Gateon Port.

But trouble began when /u/Mob_cleaner began to grow restless. He was one of the more fanatical people in that faction about happiness, and he sometimes found people depressed in Gateon Port. Against all his ethics, /u/Mob_cleaner was enraged, and left the city in search of a happier future.

But in the other factions it was worse. Violence and mayhem was lurking behind every corner, especially in the Isles of Rum. Mob could not handle it. Finally he cracked, and when he found the nearest village he could he entered it, proclaimed he was now leader, and built a wall around the village so no one could leave. Although it was a small wall, it stopped them leaving and they began listening to his every order. Anyone not happy would be shot, and happy birthday would be played at their funeral. Within months his circle of influence grew, until he was classified as one of the 20 competitors on the world stage. Due to his roots with the Party Pals, they maintain close relationships, but he will never forget the sadness he saw in the men of the other factions.

**Section of the Map:** *not needed right now*

That's all that's needed right now, I'll revisit this when the map is finished or something else comes up. Have fun!

-

**1. Map**

This is definitely the most important part of this. /u/44A99 brought up an idea where the nations start off on one section of the map, and the more and more land will be explored as the game progresses, similar to the Middle East -&gt; Eurasia -&gt; Africa -&gt; Americas -&gt; Australia of the IRL world. I feel like this is a great idea, but it means I can't show you the map I make so that no one gets a colonial advantage. I suggest that I make a post for suggestions you want to make for the map, and then I'll add them. I've already got to work on a map I think looks pretty nice, but I can add stuff to it to suit your desires.

-

**2. Sub Design**

I'm shit at sub design, and we need a cool looking one to make all new-comers think 'Wow, that's pretty good'. If someone good at sub design can help out, that will be very appreciated.

-

**3. Nations 'n' stuff**

I've got this pretty sorted out already. To create a nation, you need:

a) A name

b) A leader name

c) Some convincing lore

d) A subreddit (not sure about this though. Will it be needed?)

I will make a post soon where you can sign up a nation and prepare stuff. Obviously you don't know where you will start on the map, but you can still create a nation.

-

**4. Time**

Since we won't be releasing parts, just updating a map, we should come up with how much time passes every IRL day. Over at r/EmpirePowers (the EU4 version of this game) they do 1 IRL day = 4 IG months. We could do something similar, but since we won't be on an earth map we won't need to specifically follow these rules.

---

It began with the splintering of North Asia. From the ashes of this empire sprung three nations, Kamchatka, Alaska and Western Siberia. Kamchatka quickly sided with the loyalists, and they in turn quickly overran Alaska, leaving Western Siberia the only relic of the North Asian Empire remaining. But they were to get no respite, as they were a small fish in a big sea. An Eastern European general named Yurya launched an offensive on Siberia, leaving them with Magadan and Vladivostok and forcing them into a vassalage.

-

As an incredibly tiny state, Western Siberia had achieved much. After their masters of Eastern Europe join forces and flag with their neighbouring Eurpean power, Western Europe, a highly contagious disease swept European occupied Siberia. This lead to whole swaths of lands becoming unclaimed, an opportunity the proud Siberians were only too happy to take. Quickly they settled much of Siberia, regaining the lands lost to General Yurya.

-

Then came the greatest moment in Siberian history, as they defeated Yurya's ancestor, Adolf Hitler. Once his Reich was obliterated by Siberian forces, parades were held all over the empire, and songs were sung everywhere. They were no longer a middling power.

-

This was proved further when they took on, and defeated, the great powers of the world. Oceania was at war since the Splintering of North Asia, and using this as an incentive to attack, the Arctic outpost of Hsia was captured, and when the Oceanians lead a counter attack on Uppsala they where beaten back. Then came the time of the PAU war. Facing a nation at least 5 times bigger than them, they managed to reclaim their lost homelands of North Asia, and beat back the Americans from their lands. Tblisi, Yakutsk, Moscow and another one I can't remember were liberated.

-

Siberia was now a nation recognised by the other nations of the world, and was not showing signs of stopping.

Then came it's downfall, however it was not by cowering into a merger, but by valiantly throwing itself into a horrible war in an attempt to protect the rest of the nations of the world. By attacking their masters of the EU, they showed they did not prey on weaker states, but would not cower from wars that were just but impossible to win. Against the odds, the war started well. The EU were on the offensive, and Mob Khan was at one stage the ruler of the EU. With an EMP strike on Europe, they were taken unaware, and the impressive tactics of the Siberians led to a great offensive on their former masters.

-

But alas, all good things must come to an end. While the Siberians would not cower from the war, and swore to fight until it's last breathe, it's ""allies"" backed out of the war without informing him, resuming their war on the PAU and leaving the proud Siberians to die. Even the mighty Siberians could not face the European scum alone, and soon crumbled under it's might. Mob Khan, soon to be known as The Last of All Khans, was slain while attempting to defend Vladivostok, but even his attempts could not stop the ever-bloodthirsty EU from tearing down his empire. In his will Mob Khan gave to Central Asia the lands that would be left, in an attempt to spare the citizens who survived the war.

Siberia was born into chaos, lived in might, and died valiantly.

338,2016-01-28 19:15:54+00:00,self.CBRBattleRoyale,https://www.reddit.com/r/CBRBattleRoyale/comments/434tex/an_idea/,False,"Remember how we would act out scenarios pre-game, and everyone said that it was really fun (or at least most people)? Some people said that even if there wasn't a game they would still enjoy it. Well, while I was at class today I thought of this: What if there was no game, just a map and a large emphasis on RP?

I'm not sure how much of a good idea this would be, but hear me out. First things first, if I do this it will not replace this game, it'll just be a spin-off type thing. The next thing is that it would probably be a hybrid between this sub and /r/EmpirePowers (you know, the thing Cossack is always rambling about), because it will involve EmpirePower's lack of actual game and it's core rules, plus CBRBR's RP aspect and Civ 5 core rules. It will also mean there is no limit to the amount of nations that can be founded, meaning if you want to join you can create your own entire nation, no matter when you join. There will be more realistic possabilites as well, such as revolts and colonies gaining independance. 

The game should be set up quickly, since all we need to start is a good map and at least a few civilisations. The problem that arises is how many people would join this. Since each person would own their own nation, we wouldn't need too many, but that does mean that each person would have to put more effort into it, unless we make it so that we don't need input as often. 

A quick idea on how it would work:

1. You would join the sub, and create a faction. You would need to fill in a few things, plus suitable lore so that (a) I can decide on whether you're faction would be able to pop up on the map (it's not like America pops out of nowhere) and (b) Other leaders will know how to approach you, whether as a friend, neutral, or enemy.

2. You decide an area of the map to found your nation. Again, it would have to fit your lore, because that's what this game would be about and I don't want random people starting somewhere their lore wouldn't allow. Your capital will be founded, and you would officially start the game.

3. There will not be any win conditions, just do what your nation would do. Of course you could shape your empire to follow a specific victory, such as you might want to be a cultural paradise, a militaristic empire, a scientific powerhouse or a diplomatic doge, but that's not going to 'win' you the game. So really, this game could effectively go on forever (but it won't)

In his will, he gives the lands of Siberia to Central Asia, whom he had been working with since Siberia's founding. By doing this, even though he died, his people will not undergo the hardship he did.

The ship was making excellent progress, and all of his accompiaments were smiling as well. They were down in the holds gambling, and [REDACTED] seemed to be doing well at it. Mob made sure to remind him if he didn't lose the next draw there would be consequences, and then Mob's pile grew very quickly. After around 9 hours they finally got to Gateon Port, and a Party Pal escort was waiting for them.

Mob suddenly remembered he hadn't been here since he left Gateon Port to found Funland, and felt uneasy at the prospect of walking among people he left. Czar Reformer definitely seemed lost, but was happy nonetheless because the law of the country didn't force him to smile all the time. As the approached the escort, they noticed that not many parties were happening, and instead men ran to and fro from ships, seemingly to get them ready for battle.

""Ah hello Mob, greetings Czar Coss- Reformer, and... wow! Is that Shanic?!""

""It is indeed, Steve. Anything happen while I was gone?""

""Um, yeah. The Shadow Dragons to the south have kind of... declared war on us. Nothing too serious, just a little intermission between the parties.""

""Speaking of parties, can you tell me where the biggest rave is at right now?""

""Oh you'd be looking for Ben Boogie, his grandmother just died and he's holding a massive party in memory. There's thousands expected to turn up for that one.""

""Well then, I guess I should give him a celebrity appearance!"" And with that, Shanic ran off like the cheeky monkey he is.

""And as for you three, Ludicolo Guy would like to speak to you while your ship is being restocked, if you don't mind.""

""We wouldn't mind a bit"" Said [REDACTED], who couldn't wait to [REDACTED].

The escort frogmarched them through the city. Much had changed since Mob left. In fact, pretty much everything had changed. The houses were much higher now, and the sun was almost completely blocked off except for these tiny holes in the ceiling, which gave the impression that a permanent disco was going on throughout the streets. There were DJs at every corner, and drunks dancing by every DJ. When they finally broke out of the streets, they got to Ludicolo Guy's grand Party Place, which was beautifully lit up with the sun. Next to the undergrowth of the street discos, the Place seemed almost golden. They entered the building, and found themselves in the biggest party they ever saw.

They squirmed through the raving crowd to get the front, where they glimpsed Ludicolo Guy was singing down to his captive audience. They finally managed to slither to the front row, and when Ludicolo Guy saw them he was jubilant.

""Hey everybody, I've got some good news. We have just been joined by Czar Reformer and Mob the Glorious! Surely this is something worth celebrating about, isn't it!""

They crowd responded with grand applause, with the faint voice of a woman shrieking ""have my babies, Ludicolo!""

""Come on Mob, let's have a little ditty while you're here. Me and all the other Ludicolo Guys will back you up.""

Just then Mob noticed what seemed like twenty people who looked almost exactly like Ludicolo Guy wave at him, each weilding a guitar or harmonica. Damn, thought Mob, I need these sorts of alts for myself.

Before he could object though, Ludicolo forced him on the stage and thrust a mic into his chest. Mob protested, but thousands of voices in the audience were chanting his name, calling him to sing for them.

Well, how hard could it be, thought Mob, and prepared himself to sing. The drummer prepared to start the song and called out to Mob:

""A one, two, a one two three four...""

* A massive, gold statue will be erected depicting the glorious leader of Funland, Mob, in all his glory. This will remind everyone just how amazing their leader is and thus make them happy they are under the complete rule of such a dashingly handsome individual. All ERC capitalist pigs who gaze upon this statue will immidiately shit themselves.

* This statue will also entice merchants from all over the empire to start trading, and rake in the balloons for the Funland treasury. An entire extra cargo ship will be erected, and trade routes have already been established with the Mongol Khalasar and the New World. All merchants will be accompianed by high-ranking officers to prevent to spread of western ideas within my country and to protect our hard-earned balloons. All trade ships with the ERC will be sunk on sight.

* Sadland has been squashed under the hooves of our Tickle Monster, and the superb general /u/UraniumCaTS will ride through the city of Mob's Palace with the honour of shaking my hand. Triumphs and celebrations will be held for the rest of Gloriousmobtober, involving me riding through the streets of the empire standing on a rug depicting Lurking and Pub deep in sexual intercourse. The High Priest and General Uranium will follow behind. 100 ERC peasants we captured will be executed on display for the crime of being an ERC citizen.

* Lastly, every 5 years Funland will hold an event called 'Smiling Sport Games' and is to be held at an undisclosed arena. Athletes from anywhere in the world can compete, but will be blindfolded and unconsious so that they don't know where it is held. Many different events will be held, such as ERC citizen javelin throw, Wrestling an ERC citizen who's had his arms cut off', Tickle Monster Riding (the ERC racer must ride inside the Tickle Monster's mouth), and 100m swimming with weights attached to the ERC athlete's legs. The ERC athletes may not return from these events.

Now people were willing to die to recreate Northern Asia.

Mob approached the Pan American government to try to settle this diplomatically, but they laughed at his attempts for peace, saying he was nothing more than a vassal state and that he had no free will. Why would they be upset, they laughed, when we are the happiest nation on the planet!

The more they laughed at him, the more they *ignored* his plights for peace, the more annoyed Mob became. In a rage he went back to his expectant people, and told them of what happened. His people, angry and confused, began rioting in the streets. This went on for the entire afternoon, until someone in the crowd redirects their hatred to the Americans, who are 'keeping our brothers in Yakutsk and Kamchatka under bolt and steel'. With the citizens of Siberia reeling with hatred for the Americans, and the American's unwilling to let their holdings in Asia go, the tensions continue to rise until rebellion sparks in NAsia occupied lands.

Once the apocalypse had hit there was hysteria among the people, and naturally those people had to die. Those smart enough to smile grew thinner and thinner by the day, and the situation was so dire that Mob the Glorious had to call an emergancy meeting. As he entered the meeting hall he said, with the atmosphere as cold as the weather;

""So, gentlemen... what the fuck do we do now?""

""We haven't thought of too many options. We could continue killing off all the frowners, but when summer comes, *if* summer comes, we will not have a sufficient workforce to carry on the glorious empire."" Explained a middle-aged scientist who wore a bow-tie.

""Fine, so obviously we must come up with something else to keep the regime from collapsing. Any other ideas?""

""Well, General Perkins suggested maybe we kidnap some workers from the ERC. If we take the ones hiding away on the outskirts, it's possible that Lurking won't even realise what we've done. If we do this there's only one problem.""

""What is it then? Spit it out, man!""

""We lack the food to supply a raid on the ERC. With the earth dead and the fishing-pools frozen over, there's no food to eat. The Toast Kingdom has been overun by maurading barbarians, and so we haven't recieved bread for ages. There is simply nothing to eat.""

""Well, you better find food soon, because the Tickle Monsters also haven't had food, and I'm tired of people answering problems with more problems!""

""We searched the houses of all the glorious citizens who succumbed to the ongoing winter,""  ""and we found a few things that could be useful in feeding our people.""

""What did you find then, general?""

""We found an assortment of foods, most of which have been going off for a few years, but the winter has preserved it pretty well, so it's edible. Hopefully.""

""Bring me one of these foods, immidiately!""

At those words a wave of worry swept through those men, although they bravely kept their smilies going. A man quickly hurries out into another room, and returns moments later with a briefcase. With elegant precision he places it on the centre of the table and opens it. Inside was a roll of edam cheese, wrinkled and blue on the edges. Mob the Glorious looked at the cheese, and with a devious smile, pointed at the man who brought it in.

""Now eat it.""

The poor man was devastated, but he didn't show it. The more he looked at the cheese, the more strange it seemed. It even appeared to be moving at one point. But the one thing scarier than eating a mutant blue cheese was to face the wrath of Mob the Glorious. With the courage of fifty men he worked his way through the cheese, each bite worse than the last, until all the cheese had been eaten. The man broke into a big, cheesey grin. Then suddenly he exploded.

""Obviously we can't be feedng our soldiers *that*."" Mob remarked as the remains of the man was splattered everywhere. ""Did you honestly not find *anything* else when you searched the houses of my people?""

""Well, we did find one thing..."" Said a shadowy man at the back. All eyes turned to him, and they found it was none other than Steve, the peasant-soldier. For the duration of the meeting so far he had been flicking his cockroach-shaped wart on his foot, but now he leaned forward on the table to explain his point.

""What did you find then!?"" 

""We searched the house of a man who passed away only last week. Apparently he was a very big pervert, and a very big man. But he had a very weird fetish. He loved nothing more than to dip pickles into a jar of marmite and begin to... do stuff with them. We found his keys by his naked corpse, and it opened up a massive warehouse full of pickles and marmite, so much in fact that it could easily feed the rest of our population. I'm not a big fan of eating food that a man used to pleasure himself, but at this point in time there is no other choice""

""Are you telling me to feed my citizens foods that were intended to be used as dildos???""

""I'm afraid there is nothing else to eat""

Mob squirmed, uneasy at the thought of eating anal sex toys. But then he remembered that he had ample food in his palace, and that it was his people who would eat it. Mob soon passed the Pickle Laws, opening up the warehouse and handing out crates of pickles and marmite to this day. The streets built back it's happiness, as children laughed and bit into their long pickles topped with a creamy marmite. Everyone was saved by Mob the Glorious, the figurehead of humanity and deity on earth!

All hail Mob the Glorious, leader of the grand and hilarious empire of Funland!

In the Beginning: In the beginning, the Glorious PC Master Race, led by the Magnificent Gabe Newell, come to the world now called “Royalia”. A lifeless rock then, the PC Master Race terraform the world using the great and powerful twin artifacts known as “The SDK” and “The IGE”, and fill it with life, at the behest of a mysterious, godlike entity they call “Turretbox”.

Besteros becomes a wild and untamed place, where the PC Master Race live in hiding, observing the races of the world they created. But it doesn’t last. The presence of one god attracts many more, such as Miror B and Ancalagon the Black, who deposit Wonders, miraculous landmarks with varying magical properties, across the world. Unfortunately, the gods’ attempts to influence the world results in great chaos, and conflict becomes ubiquitous amongst the peoples of the world.

**~3000 BTP**: Approximately three millennia BTP (Before T. Pangolin) the volcano Mt. Valyria (Krakatoa), the gift of the Dragon God Ancalagon the Black, erupts. This causes the hatching of a vast number of dragon eggs hidden inside Mt. Valyria (Krakatoa) by Ancalagon the Black. The hatched dragons, known as the Shadow Dragons, conquer much of the East. Humanity proves helpless to stop them, even with the assistance of several gods. The PC Master Race decides to do nothing, prompting a dozen rebellious Master Race members, known today as the Twelve Heroes, to steal the SDK. The Twelve break it into twelve pieces, which are then reforged into mighty dragon-fighting weapons. The Twelve lead humanity in a counterattack against the Dragons, which successfully destroys them. The handful of remaining Dragons flee back to the East, where they assume (mostly) human guises and found a small kingdom in the shadow of Mt. Valyria( Krakatoa).

**~3000-2500 BTP**: The PC Master Race, infuriated by the Twelve Heroes interfering with the world, banish them from their hideout, as well as destroying the pieces of the SDK. The Twelve Heroes begin roaming the world, able to see many things thanks to their natural immortality, which they pass on to their many descendants. The Twelve Heroes include: • Ignus, the Flame King, who founded the Kingdom of Fire. • Cryon, the Ice King, who founded the Kingdom of Ice. • Maria, the Mad Queen, who founded the Kingdom of Portugal. • Rem, the Dawn King, who founded the Kingdom of Rema. • Jon Black, the Black King, who founded the Kingdom of the Blackfoot. • Hupiter, the Violet Emperor, who founded the Roman Union. • Drax, the Iron King, who founded the Kingdom of Draxiad. • Varnia, the North Queen, who founded Varunia. • Mong, the First Khan, who founded the Mongol Khalasar. • Pal, the Party Prophet, who founded the Party Pals. • Theodore, the Golden Sultan, who founded the Sultanate of Dvin. • Lurk, the Lost Hero, who vanished from history.

**~2500 BTP**: Ignus and Cryon, the Flame and Ice Kings, kill each other in a duel, the cause of which is lost to history. Their immortal descendants begin the War of the Elements.

**~2300 BTP**: The Kingdom of Rema goes through a Golden Age, eventually growing to encompass the present-day areas of the Vesperians, Danzaland, the Power Rankers, the Toast Kingdom, and House Congress.

**~1900 BTP**: After founding Castle Blackfoot, beginning the Sentry Program, and instituting the Peace Policy of the Lords, Jon Black abdicates, giving rule to the Gun Family, rumored (almost certain, in fact, due to their immortality) to be his descendants. Jon Black has never been seen again, though many Blackfoot maintain that he’s still alive.

**~1700 BTP**: One of Mong’s descendants, Khan Surrak, migrates into the bear-infested north area of the Eastlands. Surrak’s Khalasar takes tremendous losses until Surrak begins receiving visions on Mt. Kailash about how to fight the bears. Surrak writes down his visions, which becomes the Bearpuncher Tomes, the holy scripture of the Northern Khalsar, who rename themselves “The Grizzly Order”. His successor, Yasova, receives further visions that he inscribes in the Scrolls of Commentary, and declares the First Bear Crusade. Most of their neighbors just call them “The Bearpunchers”, though.

**~1600 BTP**: The Roman Union under Hupiter begin assimilating the rest of the Westlands, beginning with the Draxiad. King Drax himself is killed fighting the Violet Legions, and the Draxiad falls under Roman occupation, during which time it is renamed the province of Azloft.

**~1500 BTP**: The Roman Union begins a war with the corrupt, decadent Kingdom of Rema. Rem himself is slain during the war, and his daughter, Queen Vesper, flees north, eventually founding the Kingdom of Vesperia.

**~1400 BTP**: The Roman Union, having conquered all of the Westlands except most of Portugal, the Kingdoms of Fire and Ice, and Vesperia, push north to conquer the remainder of the Westlands. Portugal would have certainly perished, and the Kingdoms of Fire and Ice with them, had the Vesperians not abruptly offered their army’s services as Mercenaries. Since then, Vesperia has worked as a mercenary nation under the command of Lord Hunter.

**~1200 BTP**: Sultan Theodore of Dvin builds the Dvin Canal, though he is assassinated by his treacherous vizier not long after. The Dvin Sultanate dissolves, becoming a conglomeration of mercantile city-states ruled by Theodore’s descendants. The notable exception is Venice, founded by the mysterious Lurking Doge, suspected to be one the hero Lurk’s descendants, or perhaps even Lurk himself.

**~1000 BTP**: The Varunian Nation, who's trade rivalled even that of the ERC, begin to pass social acts increasing the rate in which trading colonies were built off the Grey Coast. Soon they are renamed to the Varunian Empire, which at it's hieght spans from the Joyful Lake to much of the frozen north.

**998 BTP**: After the death of the Prophet Pal, the Party Pals descend into misery. However, Miror B sends a message to the prophet’s descendant Ludicologuy, urging him to lead the Party Pals on a voyage across the ocean. The voyage ended in disaster when the captain got drunk and crashed on the future Party Isles. However, a party priest was inspired by a beautiful rainstorm on top of the Sri Prada to settle down, and the Pals found Gateon Port in the shadow of the Sri Prada. Due to the way he got his inspiration, he was known as Rain Shower, and helped guide the citizens of Gateon Port before going around the world to help others. The Party Pals quickly became a massive rum producer.

**983 BTP**: A Party Pal émigré from the Roman Union named Christopharr Columboose (who fled to Gateon with his wife Marrmaid to escape the Union’s oppressive governance) decides to sail away, eventually founding the Isles of Rum.

**982 BTP**: During the rough years of Gateon Port’s founding, a citizen now called King Mob cracked due to the unhappiness in the city and fled north, establishing the Dictatorship of Funland. Due to the appalling marvelous conditions, King Mob’s regime would have certainly collapsed had he not discovered the Fountain of Youth, which he has used since to maintain an iron grip on power. By brainwashing the tribes there and using them to win fight after fight with the untrained Varunian military, Mob ""the Glorious"" as he is now known began to rapidly expand his empire.

**779 BTP**: In the westernmost area of the Roman Union, a godlike figure who calls himself “Tony Danza” appears on Mt. Ruapehu. The Cult of Danza springs up, eventually drawing the ire of the Union, who try and fail to eradicate the cult. Eventually, the Cult launches a massive revolt, assisted by the Vesperians, forcing the Romans to grant them semi-autonomy. However, the Danzanation’s success is checked by the Shadow Dragons of the East (SHADE), who execute several missionaries sent to their lands. In retaliation, the newly-christened Doughnut Republic of Tony Danza begin a long series of attempts to kill the remaining dragons in SHADE, beginning a long feud.

**635 BTP**: A group of Master Race Observers known as the Power Rankers League are banished from the sub due to them annoying the other Observers. They migrate into the southern area of the Westlands, where they are led by the enigmatic “Actual Potato”, and set up the Ivory Tower on Mt. Fuji, a repository of secret Master Race technology used to rank the other factions.

**541 BTP**: A group of Black Dragoons (a samurai-like caste in the Shadow Dragons of the East) lead an attempt to depose Kenrask, the current Dragon Emperor. The coup fails, and Kenrask imposes the Draconian Code, an austere code of honor upon his men-at-arms, which is still in effect.

**425 BTP**: Hupiter moves the Roman Court to the Holy City of El Dorado, a mystical city made of gold, where he manages to obtain the powers of a minor god.

**272 BTP**: One of Hupiter’s descendants, Lady Victoria of London, sails north on a voyage of exploration to the Eastlands. However, her ship runs aground, and she founds a new settlement in the Westlands, on the shores of the mystical Lake Victoria, which she names after herself, founding the Dominion of Queensland.

**143 BTP**: The Roman Union, notorious for its endemic slavery (seven slaves for every freeman), suffers two massive slave revolts in the heartland of the Union, led by two enslaved nobles, today known as “King Toast” and “King Toasty”. To avert famine, Hupiter agrees to grant the slaves freedom and grants each leader a kingdom in the Union heartland, but subtly sets the two against one by forcing them to share the newly-created Breadcrumb Throne. In time, the two Toast Provinces declare war on one another, just as Hupiter planned.

**8 BTP**: One hundred Master Race dissidents who wish to see the outside world for themselves go into voluntary exile, led by the Pangolin Brothers, Cossack and T. They begin sailing south.

**0 BTP**: The Hundred Exiles make landfall in Queensland. T Pangolin appoints himself leader and declares the journey ended, founding the humble settlement of Pang’s Landing.

**1 ATP**: T. Pangolin offers Pang’s Landing as a vassal state of Queensland, an offer Queen Victoria accepts.

**174 ATP**: T. Pangolin and Lord Cossack begin their takeover of the world, starting by incorporating Queensland into Besteros as the Dominion of Queensland. House queen later dies. T. Pangolin embarks on his mission to gain the favour of all the kingdoms, khanates and empires of the world.

**269 ATP**: The Conquest finishes with TPangolin forcing the last Lords to swear fealty to him. Tpangolin unites the world under the banner of ""Besteros"". The Pax Besterica (Golden Age) begins.

**312 ATP**: First Rum Rebellion quashed. Many new lords appointed. Besteros is designated as an elected monarchy; the next heir in sucession to the King is supposed to gather a majority of the 19 Elector-Lords in support of his ascension to become king, lest another person in the sucession, or a particularly ambitous Elector be nominated instead.

**475 ATP**: King TPangolin goes out bear-hunting with Khan Senshi and his most trusted knights. One of Cossack's son offered him some strong alcohol, which TPangolin mistakes for water, and whilst attempting to kill a bear his drunkness impaired him and was mauled by the bear. Khan Senshi punched the beast to death, but the damage was done and TPangolin was mortally wounded. On his deathbed, he (reputedly) nominates his aide Forgie ""The Damned"" as successor. Forgie is well-respected, though not necessarily liked by many, and seems a shoe-in. Cossack, infuriated by this turn of events, secretly spreads rumors of bastardry. Though it slows the process, it doesn't stop it. However, the LUNGE and the Isles of Rum, assissted by Vesperian Merecnaries, declare their autonomy and begin assaulting other territories. Cossack uses this as an excuse to seize the throne as King-Reagent, granting himself ""Emergency Powers"" in the process. 

**475 ATP**: Forgie, infuriated by this naked power-grab, denounces the King-Regent. In the name of ""public order"", Cossack orders his arrest, prompting Forgie to flee Pang's Landing and join the newly formed ""Grand Alliance"" founded by Lord Fowl in the remnants of the old Besteros core. The Power Rankers also join the war. The two houses of King Toast and King Toasty settle their differences and merge, creating a unified Toast Kingdom.

**475 ATP**: With the world depopulated and recovering from the Time of Troubles, civil war breaks out between factions as the Grand Alliance forms to remove Cossack, and the worldwide vassal states begin plotting rebellion. The Fracturing of Besteros begins.

**476 ATP**: As the Grand Alliance marshals its forces to overthrow King Cossack, Lady Ariscal from the Grand Alliance proposed to marry Cossack for peace, a deal Cossack was very happy about, and so the war ended and Sir Forgie become the king of the realm. Cossack allows the Grand Alliance partisans to occupy the capital of Pang's Landing, renaming it Forgiefall in honor of the new King. As the Alliance elects Forgie de facto, Cossack retreats to his Kingdom of the Don to plot.

**476 ATP**: King Forgie, dismayed by the upcoming marriage done to satiate the Troll King, begins plotting to assassinate him at his midnight wedding. The bride dissuades him, but Cossack gets wind of the plot and furiously renews the war. The Party Pope denounces the Cossack, causing the Party Pals great anxiety. House Power Rankers declare war on Cossack, but the other factions steer clear.

**476 ATP**: As chaos, almost averted, descends, things fracture. The unchecked Vesperians, and the ever growing Varunian Empire are largely left to their own devices, ignored by the warring factions. The various Elector-states begin seceding, seeking their own vassalage. The ERC, worried by the instability, forms the TOPOIS to try and ensure a zone of peace. However, the Don's inclusion costs TOPOIS the Grand Alliance. TOPOIS included the ERC, the Party Pals, the Isles of Rum, the Khalasar, Funland, the Don, Draxiad, the BoCB, and the Fire and Ice.

**476 ATP**: Lord Johnny T Rainbow, Master of Brothels, betrays the Kingdom of the Don's secret communications, causing his (maybe temporary) expulsion from the Don. Funland decides to declare war due to the Don's totalitarian behavior, which they have reserved.

**482 ATP**: The previous Khan of the Khalasar (iamnotwithouttoads) resigns, leaving Khatuun Lung of the Orads as his successor. Relations between Funland and the Khalasar improve dramatically. The Bearpunchers hear rumors of bears in the Toast Kingdom and declare a (largely irrelevant) crusade against them.

**491-ish ATP**: King Cossack, realising finally that Lady Ariscal did not wish to be his wife, died of grief, leaving the throne to his now-illegimate son by Lady Ariscal, who take the mantle of ""The Reformer"". Despite the better relations with his neighnors, he renews the Civil War out of honor. Despite this, the Don institutes many reforms, such as peace with the Fire and Ice.

**492 ATP**: In the wake of the Reformer's ascension, TOPOIS convenes to talk. During this, Doge Mallock of the ERC oversteps his authority as Chairman, tossing out Funland and the Khalasar, prompting his resignation. His resigning prompts the Lurking Doge to assume Sopra Doge and Chairman position, readmitting them... only to face opposition from the Isles of Rum, who force him to dissolve the Chairman position. Doge Octlu resigns, and Doge Phillip is sent to Nuova Ragusa.

**493 ATP**: The Reformer renounces his claim to the throne in exchange for recognition from his mother, Lady Ariscal, ending the Civil War again.

**493 ATP**: The fallout over TOPOIS's growing obsession with Freedom prompts a counteralliance, FOUKOB, to form, kicking off a cold war between the two leagues.

**495 ATP**: Amidst the tension between TOPOIS and FOUKOB, the Lurking Doge writes a popular book series detailing the history of Besteros.

**496 ATP**: Unknown to the Lurker, his series becomes massively popular in Funland. King Mob, determined to please his people, invites Lurker, the only friendly ERC member, to Funland, then kidnaps and imprisons him. This was done on the advice of Doge Mallock, who was disgruntled due to the Lurker overshadowing him. Worried, other nations dispatch agents to find him.

**496 ATP**: Shortly after Lurker, the Sopra Doge, goes missing, Mallock claims power as the ""Doge-Re"", claiming absolute power over the ERC, part of a conspiracy with Mob and King Reformer.

**496 ATP**: After 20 days of imprisonment in Funland, the Lurker escapes using Shadow Magic, though he is forced to bargain away some vision for the power to do so. After his return to the ERC, Mallock immediately arrests him and prepares to return him to Mob, unwisely revealing the plot. The furious Lurker escapes again with SHADE assisstance and flees Venice.

**496 ATP**: Citing the Lurker's use of Shadow Magic and his violent breakout from Funland, Mob and Mallock denounce him to the world as a criminal. Lurker strikes back by denouncing them, though the turning point comes when Mallock announces L'età dell'Impero and declares the ERC the Dvinnish Empire, condemning Lurker and urging the world to join their rule.

**496 ATP**: Lurker gathers support of SHADE, the Isles of Rum, and TOPOIS, and declares a rebellion in Venice. Genoa and Olympia, disturbed by Mallock's growing egomania, join the revolt, beginning the War of Dvinnish Sucession.

**496 ATP**: The Power Rankers, the ERC rebels, SHADE, the Isles of Rum, the Vesperian Mercenaries, the Toast Kingdom, the Blackfootbros, and the (reluctant) Party Pals all declare war on the ""Dark Empire"", which consists of the Dvin Imperialists, Funland, the Mongol Khalasar, and the Don. The other factions stay neutral, though the Fire and Ice toss a denouncement at Mallock, and FOUKOB goes into a tizzy over the conflict. House Congress ends its war with the Toast Kingdom, which both had forgotten about utterly.

**496 ATP**: Lurker spearheads an attack on Dvin, seeking to end the conflict once and for all. Mallock, cut off, surrounded, and vastly outnumbered, flees Dvin in four galleasses, taking 50 soldiers and an unknown number of civilians, and heads to Funland. His second in command, Sopra Guardia Antonio of Dvin, is left behind to hold the city, though the effort fails. Mallock attempts to hand Dvin to King Reformer to prevent the ERC from getting it, but this fails when Lurker informs him of Dvin falling.

**496 ATP**: With Mallock banished to Funland, the ERC is restored as a Republic. However, King Reformer denounces the Lurker due to his use of Shadow Magic and revolution against Mallock. Things get worse when Reformer let slip that he was aware of Mob and Mallock's plot from the beginning and said nothing, earning the fury of TOPOIS, resulting in the Don being ejected from the Pact. The Reformer does secure peace with the ERC, though. Mallock is turned out of Funland due to his wanted status, so he secretly heads south to Nuova Ragusa and takes control 7 days after his exile. No one knows for sure what he's doing, or if he's even in Nuova Ragusa, but if he is there he is almost certainly brooding, waiting for the time to strike. His command of Nuova Ragusa rested upon Doge-King Phillip mysteriously vanishing several days earlier while heading back to the ERC.

**496 ATP**: Funland and the Khalasar raise massive armies to assault the ERC, beginning the Victory Bay Campaign. Mob offers to call the invasion off if Luker surrenders himself, but is rebuffed, and orders the attack in a rage. Meanwhile, Cossack's Ghost turns in his grave at rumors of Lady Ariscal marrying Forgie, prompting him to arise, raise an army of the dead, and march on Forgiefall... only to find the rumors are false and retire to the DRU.

**496 ATP**: As the Funland/Khalasar army draws closer to the ERC, a minor famine in the Don prompts King Reformer to pressure the Toast Kingdom into granting them food supplies via FOUKOB, with Funland support. FOUKOB manages to set up a food-trading accord, but said accord included a steep tariff on TOPOIS food imports, raising the concern of the Free-Trading TOPOIS nations. With the War of Dvinnish Succession intensifying and trade between the two alliances in danger, SHADE becomes rather unwelcome in FOUKOB, prompting TOPOIS to offer membership.

**496-500 ATP**: Just a few days after the end of the Victory Bay Campaign, Mt. Valyria shakes the earth with it's biggest eruption since the Shadow Dragon Empire. The world is plunged into chaos, with the ashes of the volcano blotting out the sun, and plunges the realm in a four-year permanent winter. Crops fail, and with the only food supply being found in Solomon's Mines in the Toast Kingdom, many animal-like people fought for weeks over the bread stored there. The Varunian Empire, streched thin over their vast lands, collapses, and a new society called LUNGE takes over, taking in refugees from all over the once-mighty empire and becoming a barbarian-like nation. Society grinds to a halt, and by the end of it is a world barely recognisable by it's own inhabitants. This will go down in history as the one event that shook even the all-powerful Gabe Newell. Truly a new age has begun, but whether it is a golden or dark age is yet to be seen.

But according to Lurking they can get to Dvin faster than I can get to Ragusa.

That's another thing. Why on earth would I want to attack Dvin? You guys obviously had naval superiority, and I wouldn't ever had wanted to attack from sea. I wanted to attack *with* the Mongols by land. But yet again you didn't listen to me.

If the Toast Kingdom's bread was shared, the below will be the likely outcomes:

**Pros:**

* The FOUKOB nations will not starve, even in the harshest of winters.

* The price of bread will be lowered in each of our nations, raising public opinion of their leaders

* We can shift our workforce from agriculture to more productive aims.

**Cons:**

* The Toast Kingdom's economy will plummet, and the price of bread will rise considerably there. The Bread Trade completely dominates their economy, and to give it away for free will ruin them.

* FOUKOB nations may become too dependant on the Toast Kingdom, so if something were to happen to them/their cargoes of bread, all of FOUKOB will be in famine.

* The Toast Kingdom, although their bread mines are plentiful, could face starvation from their excessive population.

If a law was to be passed, then we must not neglect the Toast Kingdom's welfare. I suggest a monopoly must be made on the Toast Kingdom's bread, so that they and FOUKOB are the sole manufacturers of bread. If this is done then the Toast Kingdom can demand steeper prices for their produce. To do this I propose a tax on TOPOIS corn should be implemented, so that the common people favour our cheeper and better corn over theirs. Once a monopoly is gained, the Toast Kingdom's economy should be maintainable, if not better. 

The Toast Kingdom shouldn't, however, give bread to all FOUKOB nations at all times. I propose that the Toast Kingdom are only required to distribut bread to a nation if any of the following are true:

* That nation is embroiled in war

* That nation is suffering economic crisis.

* It is winter.

The buccaneers bucced and thy Reformer Donned,

A pretty little tiara which his head it sat on.

But there was one man in the world who shared a different cheer,

And his name was Mob the Glorious, a name that struck fear.

For within Funland's borders everyone refused to be happy,

From the high-ranking advisors to a baby, in his nappy!

Mob ordered his gunmen to shoot them all down,

But even though refused to smile, and began to mass frown,

The leader hated the miserable looks on their mugs,

They frowned with all their strength, something quite deluxe.

The handsome leader brooded til he had an idea

He'd FORCE them to feel his Christmas cheer!

So he worked through the day, and the result was a sight;

A mountain of presents, around 137m high!

Then he crept into houses, giggling with glee,

Then, like a crook, put presents 'neath their trees!

Children woke up, looking forward to a misery-filled day,

But instead they felt joy when they saw where the gifts lay,

No misery, no greif, no thoughts of death or decay,

Then they realised; Mob the Glorious has ruined Christmas day!

Naturally, every man turned into a rebeller,

They even let /u/Lurking_Chronicler out of his cellar!

The rebels lay siege to Mo's iron gate,

He knew he'd done wrong, maybe it's not too late!

Yes, maybe if he stole all the gifts he hauled,

Then perhaps Christmas will be saved after all!

There was no time to lose, he set off at once.

And soon no presents were seen in Funland's... funce?

The day was saved, everyone in the realm was sad,

And no-one at all within Funland's borders were glad.

/u/Lurking_Chronicler went to his cellar, no-one sweet or sappy,

The subreddit for Funland can be found at r/TheFunlandDictator, and the following roles are needed:

* **Artists:** Needed to create propaganda posters to attract more happy citizens to the empire. Also to create artwork for the subreddit.

* **Diplomats:** Needed to represent Funland at the TOPOIS meetings every Saturday at 6PM Pacific time (TOPOIS is like a kind of EU, where certain member nations can discuss stuff and work together.

* **Mayors:** Needed to run cities for the Glorious Leader (me). I am naturally ruling the capital, Mob's Palace, but every other city can be run by any member of Funland, as long as they've been a member for at least a week. Mayors have a bigger say in how the country is run (ultimately though I make the final decision) and can decide on stuff to do regarding that city.

The men and women who take up the challenge of scouring every corner of the globe are, at best, in a bog within a spider-ridden country, but Curtis Peyton was not one of those people. He was the son of a wealthy couple who resided within the Grand Alliance, one of the greatest nations in the realm. Usually all you'd hear about in the capital of Forgiefell was the glorious victories of King Forgie and the evils of Czar Cossack. But today is different, for Curtis was in the middle of his final explorer's class, on the subject of all the nations in the realm, and afterwards he would go out to finally see the world outside his city walls.

His teacher began the lesson by going through some revision on safety protocol, how to survive if one were to find yourself in a sticky situation, and how to draw professional maps. The teacher finally began teaching them about what they know about the realm's twenty big nations so the budding explorers knew where they wanted to go.

He told them of fearless mercenaries, dictators who forced people to smile, swashbuckling pirates, and of Tony Danza. All the students of his class listened eagerly, for now they could soak in the pearls of wisdom their teacher was sharing:

""...did you know a Party Pal can drink 6 shots of alcohol without passing out...""

""...all they do is find bears. Then punch them. Then hold the cubs to attract the mothers so they can punch them to...""

""...no one really knows why they rank everything. Maybe their whole nation is plagued with a unique strain of autism?...""

When the lesson was over, Curtis went to the main foyer and lined up for the expedition booth. This was set up so that explorers could decide where they wanted to go and set up an expedition  party if they wanted to. Since this was his first exploration, he must go with an exploration party with a minimum of 3 people, including a senior guide to track their efficiency and make sure their safe. One by one the people in front of him formed their groups, and when he finally reached the front he was met by a stocky, acne-faced woman.

""Um. Peyton? Curtis Peyton.""

""And where will you be off to?""

""Um..""

Mob the Glorious had everything he could ever dream for. He shaped a new kingdom, filled with many smiling citizens, snipers watching the smiling citizens in case they frowned, and C4 on those snipers in case *they* frowned. There was even C4 on the C4 in case that felt depressed. Occasionaly he would pay his friends over at the Party Pal Republic, but no matter how much respect he had for those people, he still felt what he did was the right decision.

On the way back he passed his favourite ~~concentration camp~~ party house. He heard the ~~screams~~ laughs erupting from within, and curiously he decided to enter.

The head clown of the complex met him with arms wide and grin wider. With a hint of nervousness, the clown quickly ushered Mob the Glorious into a colourful room and told him he had some ""funny news (funny as in bad)"" Mob's grin decreased in size a little, but quickly caught himself and grinned as hard as he could in repentance. The clown carried on with what he had to say.

""Glorious Leader, I have some news I need to tell you about. It's...er...about the citizens of Funland""

""What is it, Jeff?""

""More and more people begin to oppose the regime. Many have taken to underground secret depression sessions to get the happiness out of them. Most of the prisone- I mean partyers here are convicted of such saddening crimes. The nation is, to an extent, about to go through a Depressing Revolution!""

""...""

Mob couldn't believe it. He couldn't understand why so many people would oppose pure happiness. Everyone wanted to be happy, right? Then something happened that hadn't happened for a long time.

Mob the Glorious was enraged.

""WHAT THE FUCK JEFF? WHAT'S GOING THROUGH THESE PEOPLES MINDS TO MAKE THEM WANT TO BE SAD? GIVE ME A FUCKING SOLUTION TO THIS RIGHT NOW!""

""Uhm, well, the problem is that you can't actually kill all these people. It would avoid the crisis, but there wouldn't actually be enough people left to send death threats to people such as Czar Cossack. The only solution I see is to turn their sorrows against them.""

""How the fuck are we meant to do that, Jeff?""

""You see, one of the more recent news is that a family in our empire was hunting around the countryside for their dinner for that night, but instead when they entered a magical looking forest they found a fountain that is said to make one younger. Many people have escaped the cities just to have a bath in this well, but if we move in and allow people rights to visit the fountain (under heavy military inspection, of course!) then they may be willing to overlook the regime and pump out those smiley faces!""

""Are you suggesting that we reward these criminals for frowning in my empire!?""

""B-b-begging your pardon, oh Glorious Being, but it may be that this is the only possible way.""

Mob didn't know what to think. On one hand, he really wanted to see the criminals shot and burned, but apparently people hate being shot, then those people will have to be shot for hating it, and so on. On the other, Allowing people to see this fountain might be the solution to even more perfect happiness, but he hated having to reward them for commiting such an atrocious crime, and is it really safe to allow people such passage within his empire?

After thinking it through for a long time, Mob finally whispered ""Let them see it"".

I'll work on it over the weekend.

Anyway, on with the show!:

Deceased:

* /u/gza_aka_the_genius from **Bilbais** finally succumbed to starvation after Carthaginian forces laid siege on Bilbais for what seemed like forever. The situation got so desperate that Ayyubids prowl the streets like dogs, searching for anything to eat. Some may say that /u/gza_aka_the_genius was one of the lucky ones.

* /u/SirMallock of **Dvin** was cut down by Spartan pirates looting Dvin. After hearing screams and the clash of swords outside his home, SirMallock ran out to found the pirates attacking the people of Dvin and taking their treassarrs. He desperately tried to defend his neighbour, but was eventually cut down.

* /u/rivalnator of **Uxmal** died at the hands of the Hawaiian invaders. As a child he grew up thinking that the Hawaiians were his friends, and would defend the Mayans to the death. However, the spears that once kept back the Buccaneers now turned round to a different target, and Uxmal was that target. The Mayans did not last long without their Hawaiian 'friends'.

Near Death:

* /u/TatsutheLation of **Valdivia** survived a food shortage that gripped the city. The demand for bread went up while the supply lowered, and because of this the price of food rose. The poorer people in the city who couldn't afford it wasted away, until there was nothing left of them. Luckily TatsutheLation was quite wealthy, otherwise he would've suffered the same fate.

* /u/MachoCat from **Kopavogur** continued to hold out against the Irish bombardment. Almost half of the citizens died, but he stayed inside his house and kept his family safe. He has lasted 2 installments of the City Game by doing this, but he dosen't know if he can handle a third. Suddenly he has news that the Irish are being pushed back. Could it be that he could survive this war?

Quite amazingly, we got exactly **69 Participants**, which obviously needed to be boldend die to the sheer perfection of it! Well done lads!

I would also like to apologise for missing last part's one, as I was caught off guard with the part being posted today rather than the expected tomorrow, so I quickly got this part done and, unfortunately, somebody has died...

Deceased:

* /u/GBlazeMan from **Hastings** died defending the city from evil Irish and French invaders. His patriotic spirit will be laid to rest knowing he's done his duty and, probably, that the city could' ep held off the attack without him.

Near Death:

*  /u/Tojin of **Mazar-i-sharif** survived the famine that swept through Afghanistan. Although only one of his fellow citizens died, many of the people walked around skeletal like, and finding food will be difficult.

* /u/MachoCat watched as his city of **Kopavogur** was bombarded by the Irish. Hearing of what they did to his friend /u/GBlazeMan in Hastings, he didn't fancy his odds of survival. But then a miracle happened. The Icelandic navy swept through Northern Ireland, not only pushing back the Irish but preventing Kopavogur from being a city on the front lines. For now.

There will be no events this update because it is the first one, but if you have any ideas for events someone can do (like the ones from last time) let me know in the comments. *I'm still taking signups, so if you missed the first one I will add you.

Since it is a new game of it, it can also have entirely different rules this time. One idea I had was that you took on the role of a hitman, given the name of another person playing the game and hunt them down, while avoiding being caught by the person hunting you down or dying due to war, starvation etc. I thought this was a good idea, but if you have any other thoughts please don't hesitate to say it in the comments. Any good ideas I see could very well be implemented into the game.

No matter what rules we end up playing with, nobody can *start* in the same city as someone else. If you want to join, comment below which city you want to start in, which civ that city belongs to because I'm pretty bad at finding stuff on maps, and optionally any ideas you have for this new game.

For a while, I've been wanting to do an AI only battle for all of you to feast your greedy little eyes uponeth, and I have come up with ideas. But recently, I've had the idea to get all the civs from the Battle Royale, split them into four different games, and the top 5 of each game come back to play in the final game, where we can find out who the winner is. I've done this for 2 reasons, 1 is that since the BR will take a long time, we can have many other games to watch in the meantime and have many more eliminations and victors. 2 is that I'm a hardcore England/Burma fan, and I want a game where (hopefully) Ireland and Vietnam get royally fucked. Mainly Ireland though. Fuck you Ireland. And pls take care of London.

Anyway, here are the Pools for each game.These pools have been chosen by random, and the order they go in will also be the turn order.

**Pool A:**

The Boers

Vietnam

Norway

Australia

Mongolia

Mughals

Champa

China

Timurids

Indonesia

Arabia

Persia

The Kongo

The Huns

Hawaii

**Pool B:**

Burma

Carthage

Sparta

Israel

**Pool C:**

Chile

Ashanti

England

**Pool D:**

Tibet

USSR

Argentina

Mexico

Ethiopia

Philippines

 Ayyubids

Zulu

Mali

Maori

Rome

Ireland

Poland

Brazil

Korea

As a final note, the civs in the BR don't necessarily have to be the ones in the game. For instance, America, Sweden and Byzantium can be represented as the modded version or the vanilla one. The choice is up to you

/u/Protroid really tried to get us to hear him, lovingly shift-clicking every single capital letter onto every single rap since to very beginning. And not only did /u/Protroid have his own unique style, he also backed it up with amazing lyrics and piercing burns. Since the start I thought Protroid could've run away with victory, beating out Vietnam, Mongolia and Burma (my civ :( /u/EmeralRange you were so close!), only to lose out to the Yaks in the semis. But, aside from those darned Yaks, Protroid has kept a great winning streak, and Mao celebrates with him in a party with all the Chinese people in the world, and it was held in a sports hall.

Here are some of Protroid's highlights in this event:

Now onto the moment we've all been waiting for since this the beginning. And no, the answer isn't for it to be over. **It's time to announce the winner of the Official Civ 5 Rap Battle Royale!** The audience were hungry for blood last part, and they have decided who wins and who loses, and yet again it was a close call, as /u/Funhau5 was flowing throughout, whereas /u/admiral_ifan's second verse was absolute killer. So who will be crowned the victor? **The winner of the Civ 5 Rap Battle Royale is...**

---
**YAKUTIA**
---

Yes, we have our winner ladies and gentlemen, and it is none other than Yakutia's own 
/u/Funhau5! Throughout the whole competition he proved himself time and time again a great lyricist and used well-thought and effective punchlines the whole time! And we are also pleased to announce that **Funhau has received the world record for First Yak to Do Something other than Sleep! Congrats**. Whenever I read through Funhau's verses, it's obvious to see why he deserves this spot, as his Ryhmes seem to come naturally and sometimes effectively used his opponents raps against them.

A look at /u/Funhau5's highlights and his road to success:

(VS Japan Round 1)

Do us all a favor, and send some units to Seoul,

So we can all stop thinking you're a worthless asshole.

But if I ever see you make your way up to the tundra,

Just know that you're not gonna have any fundra.

---
(VS Persia Round 2)

You make it sound like we can only delay,

But you'll have to speak up; there's a Great Wall in the way.

When's the last time you read back to Part 5?

I stumbled upon it in my Great Library's archives,

And, ever since then, you've been mentioned just thrice,

You captured one, shitty city, and now you're giving advice?

---
(VS Ayyubids Round 3)

AYYYY, it's almost sad that we spoke before this,

I'm gonna feel really bad when I leave you crippled, drenched in your piss.

I'll just say this now; you have one verse to work on your diss,

Because, by the time verse 2 is through, you'll be suffering from rigor mortis.

---
(VS China Semi-Finals)

I can't believe that shouting got you to the semi-finals.

You're not a real MC, but if you were, I'd burn your vinyls.

But the only thing you do well is make our fucking ears bleed.

Anyway, that's it for RBR1, no more raps need to be submitted! I thought for the next upload, when I announce the winner, I will go through the 5 best moments of the tournament, announce the winner, then go through his journey to victory and his greatest moments. Thank you all for taking the time to read this series, and if you want more or want to get involved, head on over to /r/Civ5RapBattleComp!

Now the moment we've all been waiting for (a long time), on with the competition! A last reminder of the battles:

**FINALS**

England (/u/admiral_ifan) AND Yakutia (/u/Funhau5)

**THIRD-PLACE PLAYOFF**

ENGLAND VS YAKUTIA

Alright, we're in the finals, and the turtle jokes went stale.

You research techs like a snail, and you surely won't prevail.

England's gonna need the Holy Grail of secrets to unveil,

Before Elizabeth becomes a frail piece of tail.

In terms of military, England's really not that scary.

You should be very wary of all the troops you're gonna bury.

It doesn't take an actuary to prove your skills are hairy,

And I'm gonna send you crying to your mommy like a fairy.

""Aww, honey, what's the matter? Why are your clothes tattered?

Everyday you're looking sadder, and I'd like you to get gladder.

I know your dreams are shattered, but Funhau5 is so much radder.

He's gonna whip you up like batter, and then serve you on a platter.

Atop the CRBR ladder, he's silencing all of the bogus chatter,

And, when he plowed me last night, I even felt it in my bladder!

Honestly, I'm flattered. Nobody ever makes me splatter.

But verse 2 is on the way, and now it's time for you to scatter.""

E is for Everyone who Expected an Early English Exit, Except they forgot about me,

N is for my Nimble Navy Naughtily Navigating for the win and Now I'm there (Nearly),

G is for my Gauntlet, thrown down, I'll Gladly Go for you. Warning: this'll Get Gory,

L is for your Lily-Livered Laziness, it Lost you your Lead, Losing now Looks Likely

A is for Any Attempt At Attack that was Abandoned, your Aggression Adrift in Apathy,

N is for your Naps, but I'm your Nightmare, I'll Net your Nation fast and Nastily,

D is for Dormant Doormat, but I'm Daunting, I'll bring Death and Defeat- I'm Dastardly,

What's that spell? Learn it well, for when I'm your Queen- call me Your Majesty.

I'll fight Darkhan in the heart of darkness, I ain't arsed, I'm ready to take down you all

You're high in the rankings, but soon you'll be tanking, we've had the rise, let's see the fall,

I'll be cranking out units whilst you sit there wanking, hiding behind your great wall,

Shiny armoured knights sitting pretty, but they'd get crushed in an English pub brawl.

Don't give no fucks about Yakutsk, it's the definition of nowhere,

There only reason you grew so big is no-one wants to go there,

You only got picked for the BR because they needed to fill up all that space,

So just go back to sleep, mate, because you're never going to finish in first place.

---

If I must be honest, my head just shook,

Because your last verse contained a fucking alphabet book.

I'm the head chef of this kitchen, but you're barely a cook,

And you're serving up nothing but gobbledygook.

What's wrong with Lizzy? She must be feeling dizzy.

She gave up Nottingham, and now your country's in a tizzy.

That frizzy-haired bitch better start getting busy,

Before Malachy returns and makes her back end jizzy.

To avoid getting sacked, England needs to plan attacks,

And, the longer you slack, the sooner you'll become a snack.

Everybody quacks that Yakutia is whack,

But you're the one on track to get your fudge packed.

I probably could've won this shit without a second verse.

Everyone with eyes saw that your first was so much worse.

If only you'd rehearsed what you now wish you could reverse,

You'd be walking out of here, instead of leaving in a hearse.

But, please, don't pout. Winning's what the Yaks are all about,

And we're about to sprout from our stout combat drought.

So it seems you won the first verse, yeah it seems true,

that I need something better than that to beat you,

But when I look for inspiration from Tpang's slides,

all I see are enemies, encroaching in from all sides,

So it's time to look back to the best work that I've done,

the best wit, the best rhymes, the best diss, the best pun,

From Bohemian RAPsodies, past weeks-old flows,

All the way back to Ireland, lines about potatoes,

To find the will to keep going, the will to try harder,

Unlock the spirit of the Blitz and the Spanish Armada,

Wring it out, 'til all that's left is blood, sweat, tears and toil,

And the will to show England will keep this battle royal,

On this patch of soil, I plant my flag, make my stand,

That I will defend to the death this green and pleasant land,

This sceptered isle, This Britain that I vow to keep great,

Fight like '45, or Fifteen-eighty eight,

And if Nottingham and Canterbury turn from red to green,

York to blue, Hastings to white, we'll still fight for our Queen,

For until every English person is dead, lying in their graves,

You will still hear Rule Brittania! Brittania Rules The Waves!

CHILE VS CHINA

Chile was up against England, so the verdict was deviant,

Lizzy brought spice and salt, while Chile was missing a main ingredient

O'Higgins wants a medal, and I want to be obedient

But dissing this CAPS LOCK idiot now, I'll try to be expedient,

Scram, disperse, 'cause you need to leave immediate

Yaks messed with your mind, well I'm gonna fucking knead it

An ass-kicking? You're about to fucking receive it,

Lemme lay down the facts (go ahead and reread it)

This man loses everything, then just sits for ages,

At this point, you're just wasting space in history's pages

Admit it, you're the one civ on which no one's willing to wager

Now we just wait as Mao gets picked apart in stages

I've no interest in you now, so I don't know your news

But I guess it's looking less red, and a hell of a lot more blue,

I'd penetrate your backside, but I see that's been done to you,

All that's left is a cock-swain, cause you've lost your whole crew.

Lemme tell you . . . what's gon' happen to China

Bow, Mao, now miaow, fuss yo' pussy, and wind up

Groin's stank, shit flank, shank you up the vagina

Then dismount, wank the crank, stick it in from behind 'ya

Phew, that was fun now that I've got my cursing done,

Why don't ze dong himself concede that I've won

I know it's hard for him to hear such punishing lyrics

'Cause his jokes may be LARGE, but I go PLUS SIZE satiric,

Wait, Chairman, what's that, that you're trying to tell me?

That I'm slipping in rank, that bad luck will befell me?

That Lord only knows how I got this far in the rap?

That I'm way to dumb? That I've walked into your trap?

(That trap, by the way, it's taking up valuable space

Should've been one less civ to start with, 'cause you're such a waste)

Now you've got a whif, but Lord no, you can't fell me

The only Lord I know of is Bernie Higgins Riquelme!

It's hemispheric (the difference between you and me)

You deem your raps ""complex,"" but you just rhyme using ""e,""

Chinese don't translate well when it comes to rap,

You're the music I listen to when I take a nap.

CALL ME QINCHENG PRISON I KEEP THE AUDIENCE CAPTIVE

EVERY BOMB I DROP IS STRAIGHT RADIOACTIVE

I GIVE IT MY ALL BUT YOU RAP LIKE YOU DISTRACTED

WHAT'S LEFT ON YOUR TRACK WHEN OBSCENITY'S EXTRACTED?

DONE YOUR LAST VERSE, NOW DO SOME INTROSPECTION

BOW YOUR HEAD LOW AND ASK SOME HARD QUESTIONS

I BRING THE NOISE WHEN I RAP LIKE I AIM TO DEAFEN

BUT CHILE'S ONE NOTE, LET ME DO AN IMPRESSION!

""I talk a lot of shit and I think I'm a genius

can't get through a verse without talkin' bout penis

my meter's a mite shakey, just try to read it aloud

talk like i'm on top but i'm always gettin' plowed.""

IT MIGHT BE A BIT PAINFUL TO HEAR THAT RENDITION

DON'T SOUND FAMILIAR? YOU SHOULD GIVE YOURSELF A LISTEN

REWIND THE TRACK, GO BACK, TAKE AN INTERMISSION

WEAK STYLE, WEAKER RHYME, AND THE WEAKEST COMPOSITION

Will /u/admiral_ifan bring the win back to Elizabeth, or will /u/Funhau5 go down in history as the first Yakut who did something? Which one of these fearsome rap warriors will stand the test of time?

I have a few things I would like to say beforehand. If you have been eliminated, or you are interested in participating, you can sign up at the new  /r/Civ5RapBattleComp!

England (/u/admiral_ifan) AND Yakutia (/u/Funhau5)

**THIRD-PLACE PLAYOFF**

China (/u/Protroid) VS Chile (/u/Atlas_Schmatlas)

ENGLAND VS YAKUTIA

Alright, we're in the finals, and the turtle jokes went stale.

You research techs like a snail, and you surely won't prevail.

England's gonna need the Holy Grail of secrets to unveil,

Before Elizabeth becomes a frail piece of tail.

In terms of military, England's really not that scary.

You should be very wary of all the troops you're gonna bury.

It doesn't take an actuary to prove your skills are hairy,

And I'm gonna send you crying to your mommy like a fairy.

""Aww, honey, what's the matter? Why are your clothes tattered?

Everyday you're looking sadder, and I'd like you to get gladder.

I know your dreams are shattered, but Funhau5 is so much radder.

He's gonna whip you up like batter, and then serve you on a platter.

Atop the CRBR ladder, he's silencing all of the bogus chatter,

And, when he plowed me last night, I even felt it in my bladder!

Honestly, I'm flattered. Nobody ever makes me splatter.

But verse 2 is on the way, and now it's time for you to scatter.""

E is for Everyone who Expected an Early English Exit, Except they forgot about me,

N is for my Nimble Navy Naughtily Navigating for the win and Now I'm there (Nearly),

G is for my Gauntlet, thrown down, I'll Gladly Go for you. Warning: this'll Get Gory,

L is for your Lily-Livered Laziness, it Lost you your Lead, Losing now Looks Likely

A is for Any Attempt At Attack that was Abandoned, your Aggression Adrift in Apathy,

N is for your Naps, but I'm your Nightmare, I'll Net your Nation fast and Nastily,

D is for Dormant Doormat, but I'm Daunting, I'll bring Death and Defeat- I'm Dastardly,

What's that spell? Learn it well, for when I'm your Queen- call me Your Majesty.

I'll fight Darkhan in the heart of darkness, I ain't arsed, I'm ready to take down you all

You're high in the rankings, but soon you'll be tanking, we've had the rise, let's see the fall,

I'll be cranking out units whilst you sit there wanking, hiding behind your great wall,

Shiny armoured knights sitting pretty, but they'd get crushed in an English pub brawl.

Don't give no fucks about Yakutsk, it's the definition of nowhere,

There only reason you grew so big is no-one wants to go there,

You only got picked for the BR because they needed to fill up all that space,

So just go back to sleep, mate, because you're never going to finish in first place.

England (/u/admiral_ifan) AND Yakutia (/u/Funhau5)

We will also have a third place play-off between:

China (/u/Protroid) VS Chile (/u/Atlas_Schmatlas)

But since none of that has happened yet, nothing to see here yet!

**COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS**

* Q: I want to support my civ, but someone is already rapping for them. What do I do?

A: Rap for your civ! People may be confused because in the last battle, it was limited to 1 person per civ, but this time round, as many people as you like can represent a civ!

* Q: Ok, so I've signed up to rep my civ. What now?

Now is when the fun begins. You need to find an opponent to rap against, by commenting on this link, making a link asking for an opponent, PMing someone to rap battle you, or you could even meet them at r/CivBattleRoyale or what not. But make sure that once you found someone and agreed to battle each other, you must **BOTH** PM me saying ""I would like to start a rap battle against *opponent's name*. Then it starts...

* Q: Help! I'm started a battle, and I have no idea what to do! ???

A: Calm down, I'll explain it. Once you have PMed me, and so has the other person, I will tell you that the battle has started and the deadline for the first verse, then when both the contestants verses are in, the deadline for the second one. IF both people hand in their verse before the deadline, we will not wait for the deadline to come. The deadline will always be **2 days** long! unless I'm away at the moment it expires.

* Q: Ok, so I've finished my first battle, and I won! What happens now?

A: Congratulations! Whenever you win, or even lose, a battle, I will update your profile that I've got on a word document, so I can see who well everyone's doing. These profiles will then be used to update the leaderboard that we will have soon. The leaderboard will show everyone's positioning, including stuff like Battles Won, Battles Lost, Percentage Won, and Nationality. The leaderboard will be ranked on battles won, not percentage won.

CHILE VS ENGLAND
---
I'm heading down to Chile town, way south of the equator,

I'm the controversial turtle, yelling laters to the haters,

Hurtled over hurdles, to the second last stage,

Certain to be hurtful, 'til you're purple with rage,

I'll whip Friggin' O'Higgins 'cause you know his hits ain't stinging

It's far too late, you can't be saved, It's your grave I've been digging,

I'll rule the seas, you'll all see, I'll get UUs eventually,

And then, Chile, you'll bend the knee and beg me for mercy,

I'll knock at your backdoor, laugh at your army,

Sitting there slack-jawed, they'll never harm me,

You can't even sink the Inca, think you'll linger in this fight?

You hide behind the Argentines, with not a backbone in sight

You can have your little wars and we'll ignore you until,

You all get slaughtered and conquered by the big boy Brazil,

I'm a tough motherfucker, rougher than the Buccs' grog,

Think twice before writing off this killer underdog.

---

Let’s compare -- you beat Norway, I beat Texas

You’ve got an aging Rooney, we got a prime Alexis

You’re like a puny mini, we’re like a fuckin’ Lexus

Kick us in the balls? Punch you in the solar plexus.

Beat Argentina in more battles than you,

You’re so full of shit this could be a petting zoo,

Sure Liz’s got pop but what the fuck she gon’ do?

Her turtle shell’s gettin’ painted red white and blue.

For nearly two hundred years, the sun never set

On your empire, so big it made you wet,

But times have changed since you made that decree,

Now your sunset’s at 6:00 o’clock PM GMT

Come down from your shit hole inside of your castle

I’d step to your ruler, but it’s too much of a hastle

Virgin in war, and as an empty vassal

All those gay Queen references -- now get fucked in the asshole.

Hola, Hijo de puta, soy Inglaterra,

And you better be ready for my reign of terror,

I'll make Pinochet look like Mother Teresa,

Cos Bernardo is as scary as Augustus Caesar,

You're a quiet little country, completely different over here,

We've got Dickens, Austen, Chaucer, Darwin, Shakespeare,

And when we come down south, we'll kick you out on your arse and all,

(by the way, Alexis lives in London mate, plays for Arsenal)

You see, you can make jibes about my population,

but only one of us achieved real-world domination,

And it ain't you, you're a poor man's Argentina,

Can't place you on a map I ain't ever seen ya,

You don't test me, don't stress me, you better believe you won't best me

Gonna kill so many Irish and Icemen they'll call my coast the red sea

But will you ever take Tiwanaku? Who cares? Who knows?

Because the Sun may set for me, but for you it never even rose.

Underdog? It's clear that you overrate,

We're sweepin' Europe like Persia under Alex the Great

By the way, you're up, serve'ya on a plate,

'Cause the Irish just do what O'Higgins dictate

Let's get one thing straight, future city state,

Lizzy's so busy, got so much on her plate,

She didn't realize that she'd messed with the wrong heavyweight

Less punny than the flows that I earnestly dictate

We'll pass by as we circumnavigate

Your pop may be high, but so is your death rate

Stop turtling alone 'fore you interrelate!

You're goin' down like Nixon after Watergate.

Less funny than the shows Channel 4 creates

We're prime time dealin' you're like the discount rate

When we go in, it's hard, and we never belate

Penetratin' back doors while you masturbate!

HOT ON THIS BEAT WHILE YOU TRYIN' TO FIND A

OPPORTUNITY TO BUST, BUT IT PAST YOU RIGHT BY

ROCKING THE MIDDLE KINGDOM FROM BEIJING TO SHANGHAI

Hey, China, DID YOU LEAVE YOUR HEARING AID AT HOME?

I have news for you, kid; you're still doing worse than Rome.

Your lines are so short, and they're incredibly simple.

Plus, I find your yelling more annoying than a pimple.

I can't believe that shouting got you to the semi-finals.

You're not a real MC, but if you were, I'd burn your vinyls.

That Jingoist mindset has you feeling like a top seed,

But the only thing you do well is make our fucking ears bleed.

Do us all a favor, please settle down a little.

You're at war with three civs, and you're the monkey in the middle.

It's blatantly obvious that your military's brittle,

And the Trungs belittle, just a tittle, your army's rite of committal.

That said, I hope you're ready for some rape and pillage.

Come Part 13, you won't have one, standing village.

If I were you, I'd really try to tighten up those butt cheeks,

Before you become the poster boy of how a tied up slut shrieks.

Let's turn it down for a minute, break it down, I'll admit it,

I stay loud for the glory, blaze it hard when I transmit it,

kept it short, to the point, but now I'm gonna transform,

you just counting cities but this ain't even my final form.

Been watchin' your performance, you might have a high rank,

From cowering in the corner with your cannons shooting blanks,

fold you like a paper tiger while I take my paper to the bank,

I got eight more lines to school you with, so let me be FRANK!

SID KNEW I WAS IMPORTANT, IN THE FRANCHISE FOR THE DURATION,

YOU WERE SO INTO MIGRATION, MODDING'S GOT YOU IN THE ROTATION!

I'M LOUD IN DICTATION, CUZ MAYBE YOU DIDN'T HEAR THE NARRATION,

WATCH YOUR MOUTH, CUZ YOU STEPPING TO THE WORLD'S OLDEST NATION,

COMMUNIST SENSATION, COLLECT ADORATION, STORY'S THE FOUNDATION,

BUILDING WALLS AND BUSTING RHYMES SINCE BEFORE CIVILIZATION!

SO IF YOU IN A TRANSLATION, LEMME JUST GIVE YOU A SUMMATION,

CHINA'S THE CENTER OF CREATION, WHILE YOU'RE JUST NOTATION.

Congrats, China. I see you're no longer in last,

But you're still the disappointment of the Battle Royale cast.

I don't mean to be rude, but you'll surely get booed,

When your empire falls under the ""Great Mao Zescrewed.""

The truth is, nobody's afraid of Great Red China,

Your capital's constricted, like it suffers from angina.

From Beijing to Shanghai, all you do is make your fans cry,

And the only time I fear red is when it's running down my girl's thigh.

Why am I dissin'? Well, you barely have a pot to piss in,

And you're rapping in all caps, like we even want to listen

To those played out rhymes, and those half-baked bars.

To win this round, you'll need to wish upon stars.

So, sit back, relax, take notes, and pay attention,

Waving a white flag is the only way to ease your tension.

Don't worry about the finals having a line limit extension,

Because you just crossed me, and now you're out of contention.

IRELAND AND ICELAND VERSUS ENGLAND: A SONG OF ICE AND IRE
---
""It begins"" were the first words /u/TPangolin uttered aboard the nuclear submarine when he saw what the monitor displayed. It showed a future where England, Ireland and Iceland were locked in a struggle for the isles. England may have a slightly stronger land army, but Ireland has a much more considerable lead navy wise. Personally, I think the English are making inroads already. But since I'm english myself, why take my biased word for it, when you can look at the stats?:

LAND ARMY SIZE: England 57%, I&amp;I 43%

NAVY SIZE: England 40%, I&amp;I 60%

TECH COUNT: England 50%, I&amp;I 50% (England has chariot archers and horsmen, but Iceland has Galleasses)

MILITARY NEAR ACTION: England 65%, I&amp;I 35%

PHILIPPINES ON RECEIVING END OF MEJI'S MILITARY MIGHT
---
The Philippine empire is crumbling before Rizal's very eyes as almost all their neighbours, including the war-hardened Meji, have DOWed them, with most of them then moving on to tear at the seams that make up the Blue Empire of Oceania (because there sure aren't any other important blue empires in Oceania, right?). In the South, The Kimberley, Australians and the Hawaiians have attacked, with the Kimberley gaining a few cities, the Australians making advancements then getting beaten back, and the Hawaiians pretty much giving the Philippines a city. It's been quite a stalemate in the south. You'd think that the Philippines would excel in the north too. You'd be wrong. Japan was a sleeping beast, falling further and further down the power rankings. Then the Philippines settled to close to it's den, and Japan roared and attacked with the strength of a thousand ships, because they really did attack with a thousand ships. They captured several cities so far, and the Philippines are getting so weak that even the Champa, whom we thought were a write-off since 4000BC, have made inroads. What will the future hold for the Filipinbros? Only time will tell.

He has already taken an Ethiopian city and force-converted them to Islam. Will he carry out his revenge? I don't really care, I just thought Saladin looked kinda cute with his whole ""make the world Islam"" thing. He never learns, does he?

PORTUGAL NEXT TO JOIN THE GIVE RANDOM CITIES FAD AS KONGO LAY THEIR HANDS ON BRAGA
---
You thought Alexios (of Byzantium) was desperate when he gave up Adrianople. You knew Licoln was mad when he shrugged off Philadelphia. You kind of let the Ashanti go when they gave away one of their last cities to the Moroccans. But nothing in the history of the world has anything been as stupid (or generous) as the day that Portugal handed over Braga to the Kongo, of all people. This has been the latest in a long string of mistakes Portugal have done. First, they let England settle Hastings right in their territory, then mucked up the Battle of Hastings. They then again proved their inexperience at war by failing to launch a god assault on Carthage, and lost the city of Arretium to a navy of sea elephants. And now they have given up any chance of power by given up a quarter of Iberia to someone in a different continent with two whole nations between them. When will Maria's antics end? When Portugal is burning all around her and buildings collapse, probably.

CIV OF THE DAY: LEONIDAS OF SPARTA
---

This is a new thing I'm going to be adding to the Pangolin, a summary of the leader who did the best in the most recent upload. This time around it was Leonidas of Sparta. A quick run-down of Sparta's abilities:

UA-Walls of Sparta: Following your first Great General, receive 
an infantry unit every time your capital grows. Capturing cities may 
grant a free citizen in your capital.	

UU-Hoplite: Replaces Spearman. As with Vanilla, but while alone, receives the “Molon Labe” promo, which provides +20% Defense, while next to friendly units, receives the “Add a step forward” promo, which provides +20% Attack

UB-Syssitia Hall: Replaces Walls. +15XP for land units, +2 culture. Does not provide defensive bonuses

-

This episode, Leonidas made gains in almost all directions. He lived up to his name as ""The Scourge of Both Romes"" as he finally conquered Cumae and helped with the fall of Ravenna. He looks to take Rome as soon as he feels like it. They say Rome wasn't built in a day, but Sparta will surely look to make it be destroyed in one. He is making steady gains into Asia Minor, being involved in the Nicomedia rock-paper-scissors fight, and looking likely to press into further into Armenian territory. Sparta have been looking powerful since the dawn of time, and they certainly havn't stopped now.",civbattleroyale,THE PANGOLIN GAZZETTE - Issue 17,https://www.reddit.com/r/civbattleroyale/comments/3mq3io/the_pangolin_gazzette_issue_17/

since all these four rappers deserve to win, and since the winner deserves a prize, I am trying to put together a little something to make this a little more interesting. If you have any ideas on a prize, do not hesitate to tell me it, even if you think it's stupid.

the next verses are due in **Monday, 5pm Brit time**. If you can hand it in early though, i could get it in by the end of the week.

I'm heading down to Chile town, way south of the equator,

I'm the controversial turtle, yelling laters to the haters,

Hurtled over hurdles, to the second last stage,

Certain to be hurtful, 'til you're purple with rage,

I'll whip Friggin' O'Higgins 'cause you know his hits ain't stinging

It's far too late, you can't be saved, It's your grave I've been digging,

I'll rule the seas, you'll all see, I'll get UUs eventually,

And then, Chile, you'll bend the knee and beg me for mercy,

I'll knock at your backdoor, laugh at your army,

Sitting there slack-jawed, they'll never harm me,

You can't even sink the Inca, think you'll linger in this fight?

You hide behind the Argentines, with not a backbone in sight

You can have your little wars and we'll ignore you until,

You all get slaughtered and conquered by the big boy Brazil,

I'm a tough motherfucker, rougher than the Buccs' grog,

Think twice before writing off this killer underdog.

Let’s compare -- you beat Norway, I beat Texas

You’ve got an aging Rooney, we got a prime Alexis

You’re like a puny mini, we’re like a fuckin’ Lexus

Kick us in the balls? Punch you in the solar plexus.

Beat Argentina in more battles than you,

You’re so full of shit this could be a petting zoo,

Sure Liz’s got pop but what the fuck she gon’ do?

Her turtle shell’s gettin’ painted red white and blue.

For nearly two hundred years, the sun never set

On your empire, so big it made you wet,

But times have changed since you made that decree,

Now your sunset’s at 6:00 o’clock PM GMT

Come down from your shit hole inside of your castle

I’d step to your ruler, but it’s too much of a hastle

Virgin in war, and as an empty vassal

All those gay Queen references -- now get fucked in the asshole.

Hey, China, DID YOU LEAVE YOUR HEARING AID AT HOME?

I have news for you, kid; you're still doing worse than Rome.

Your lines are so short, and they're incredibly simple.

Plus, I find your yelling more annoying than a pimple.

I can't believe that shouting got you to the semi-finals.

You're not a real MC, but if you were, I'd burn your vinyls.

That Jingoist mindset has you feeling like a top seed,

But the only thing you do well is make our fucking ears bleed.

Do us all a favor, please settle down a little.

You're at war with three civs, and you're the monkey in the middle.

It's blatantly obvious that your military's brittle,

And the Trungs belittle, just a tittle, your army's rite of committal.

That said, I hope you're ready for some rape and pillage.

Come Part 13, you won't have one, standing village.

If I were you, I'd really try to tighten up those butt cheeks,

We're already at the Semi-finals lads! In about 2 weeks I'll be retired! Choosing the people who got through and who didn't was incredibly difficult, and some people who I thought could possibly win this were eliminated, while some who were on the sidelines excelled.
It's really sad to see the loss of 4 great rappers today. The next verses will be due in **Thursday, 6PM Brit time.**

Without further ado, the 2 matches in the semi-finals are:

Yakutia (/u/Funhau5) VS China (/u/Protroid)

JUDGES: /u/Mob_cleaner , /u/Night_Man_ , /u/TPangolin , /u/silence_in_samarkand , /u/Kropenfuer

Today we see the departure of:
/u/SabyZ, /u/Nestourai, /u/Luigiatl, /u/EmeraldRange

Even though SabyZ got byes most his rounds, he still deserved to make it as far as he did, and I thought he really dished out some strong lines.

Nestourai was strong throughout the competition, and easily beat out most his competition easily, but unfortunately /u/admiral_ifan is especially strong against Vikings.

Luigiatl did the ayyyyyyubids proud, beating out sparta's very own /u/CAPSSMOCK and had raps faster than a carrier pigeon.A very strong competitor and a premature end.

And lastly, straight outta Rankon, we have Burma's very own (-ly)
EmeraldRange, who straight from the start I thought could very well be the victor. The battle between him and /u/Protroid was without question really close, and he will be a great loss to us all.

TEXAS VS CHILE
---
When this is all over they’ll say “boohoo Chill-ee”

cuz you don’t stand a chance against the buckaroo M-C!

You’re just a dictator overthrown by a coup

and it’s ways too easy to stomp all-over you!

There’s only room for one star in this show 

and when it comes to screenshots your civ is a no-go!

It was all fine in part nine; y’all were given screen time-

Wait did y’all really? I’m having some doubt 

– oh that’s right it was a Chilean scout!

I had to look you up so I could write this rhyme, 

but even when Tpang turned back the time

to turn one-fifty, being Chilean still was a crime

while in Corpus Christi we drank cold beers with a lime!

So watch out, this verse is only the first

we’re a full a grown empire while yer still being nursed

But maybe we’ll take you as part of our colonies,

cuz when this is over you’ll be forced down on your knees!

---
Next opponent's this goof? Time to mess with Texas

Looks like Sam Hou doesn't know what safe sex is

His pop's through the roof but who knows where his tech is,

'Cause pretty soon, Chile's eatin' grits for breakfast

Things are bigger in Texas, including your ego,

Though your name comes from tejas, I ain't your amigo

There ain't anything original about you,

Stole Chile's flag and the accent that the South use

Only thing from there's some shitty drink called Dr. Pepper

Hack off your limbs fall apart like a leper

Like a star all alone, you'll just fizzle out and die

You wry guys, tryin' to turtle by and fly high

Got less smarts than a horse fly,

u/SabyZ raps worse than a mute guy

All that dick suckin got your mouth dry

---

This is the tale of the bumbling O’Higgins,

and how his “huge navy” got pushed back by the Incans.

He got way too greedy with his hunger for war

and failed to recreate the Chilean Back Door

Squad, y’all have no place abroad,

couldn’t break their mountain pass cuz your leader’s a fraud!

So run back to Santiago de Chilé,

Texas is here with bravado, no delay!

Your burns are bland and your couplets are cliché!

And in the end we’ll paint your cities Texan blue/grey!

But thank you u/Atlas_Schmatlas for all this rapping practice

it’ll be liked Christmas when you give me winner’s status

cuz your civ is backless,

and your leader’s sackless,

and your raps are tactless,

and the Texan army will kick yer asses!

---

""Chill-ee?"" just like a Texan to mispronounce

""Chee-lay's"" the name they'll say when the champion's announced

It's too late to be friends, 'cause you'll just be denounced

You've come to beat me? Watch you get completely trounced

MC, get an MD 'cause you ain't rappin' straight

You need someone who can give your tersest verses some weight

There's no one qualified to help you out at any rate,

Dr. Pepper's the only doctor ever from your state!

When we do come to battle, it won't be very nice

Troops'll fight us haphazard, like when Texans drive on ice

Fear's spreadin' like a virus cause your pop's uncontrolled

You swine'll get the flu, cause Chile's dishin' out the cold

You're so desperate for food, you snatch scraps like a seagull

Fool, take your cue from Argentina's loss at the Beagal

Call me a dictator 'cause my flows are so regal

Lookin' to immigrate, ain't talkin' 'bout legal

ENGLAND VS NORWAY
---

D’you notice that your “win” over Iceland wasn’t sweet

You see, they want revenge for their narrow defeat

So now it’s Norway’s turn — watch us turn up the heat;

And our brothers avenge; and you limeys defeat!

Your history is one of foreign conquest and fear

More tragedy at which you can shake than a spear

(Remember when you caved to the French that one year?)

You’re used to having all of your kings end like Lear

But what did you have, after the Roman collapse

They who brought society, you who took scraps

You sure didn’t thrive; the hist’ry books simply lapse

‘Till eight sixty-five, when we redrew the maps!

The Great Viking Army laid your country to burn

Our raiders didn’t discern, and crushed your kingdoms in turn

So don’t go all smarmy; it’s time for concern

For now just like then, with a win we’ll return!

---

More bloody Vikings? Alright then Norway,

You know the Swedes and Babs were just foreplay,

Betty's getting ready to spoil your day,

The Empire has coming to grab all the clay,

I'm fucking shit up with my massive population,

You're slumming it down in tundra ridden desolation,

You dream of Viking raids? I'm here to crush your scheme,

I'm a psychopathic Freddie Mercury, call me Killer Queen

You should give up before we take you by force,

Cos when we come it'll be a sad day to be Norse,

You're like someone from Frozen; Elsa, Anna, Olaf,

Do You Wanna Build An Army? Don't make me laugh,

You'll get battered in a war, cos Love ain't An Open Door,

I'm glorious, I'm furious, had a taste and I want more,

So don't try and win, seriously, just Let It Go,

And enjoy the brief time you've got left in Oslo

Face it, Liz, you’re just scared of the North

It’s no shock you can’t even hoof it to Forth!

You’re huddled in Mercia and glibly deny

The truth — remember that plank in your eye?

You’ve got no inertia; your army sits by,

All cowed by the Irish and waiting to die!

Seems Liz needs a tudor to train her for shows

The Battle Royale is no place for a doze

Your nobles are vying for change, but who knows:

Your empire’s dying; we’ll pluck out your rose

Your rhymes aren’t too bad, deserving response

They’re carefully chosen, but you get the bronze;

You’re stealing some other men’s lyrics like pawns —

If this battle’s Frozen, then that makes you Hans!

Sing *Ruled Britannia*; your land’s halfway there

The rest will be conquered or ash — this we swear!

---
Yo Scandi-bro, we know your flow's dope, but you know what? I ain't fussed,

Cos what I'll sing when I'm done rapping is 'Another One Bites The Dust'

Put you Under Pressure, put you on a stretcher, till you cave, till you kowtow,

Cos your loud mouth is trying to knock me out, but you Don't Stop Me Now,

I'm too fast, too Flash, you're too half assed, to win this Bicycle Race,

Cos We Will Rock You, block you, stop you, just to see the look on your face,

So many great brits, we got plenty pop hits, makes you go Radio Gaga,

We the ultra culture vultures try to touch us but your country only has A-ha,

Take On Me? Please, I could beat you with a sneeze, all you do is wheeze and snore,

You love peace, love to appease, but me? I love a Crazy Little Thing Called War,

It's a Kind of Magic that feeds me, you're so static, you'll get beat by the Swedes,

I get naughty in the north sea, that's why the freaky Fat Bottomed Girls love me,

It's my language we speak, not Latin or Greek, and Norwegian makes me yawn,

No Innuendo, you just gotta go, while my Show Must Go On

I won't clap you, I'll slap you, backstab you, you no rapper, you're a rapscallion,

Because Liz is pissed and won't stop this until We Are The Champions

YAKUTIA VS AYYUBIDS
---

I’ve already won against the Russians that conquered your tribe,

But I suppose you could still give me a bribe.

You were only included in this game to take up space,

And yet people can still somehow say your name with a straight face.

You claim you’re tough just for surviving the Russian winter,

But you’d probably break down if you even got a splinter.

You’ve had everything handed to you on multiple silver platters,

But now your hopes for first place are in shatters.

We’ve had to fight for everything we have now,

But just because nobody wants to be by you means you’re a “sacred cow.”

You’ve done nothing but sit there and become one with the turtle,

Refusing to accept that your land is useless and infertile.

You think you’re a “beast of the east”,

While your people can’t even afford to have even a tiny feast.

You just live off of reindeer meat,

So admit that you’ve been beat.

---
Wait, wait. Hold up. Is that LuigiATL?

From the home of the pimps, the playas, and the southernplayalistic hell?

Hey, man, what's happenin'? I heard you got some stories to tell,

About Leonidas picking flowers? Yeah, I heard that shit went well.

Well, guess what? That's over. And, us Yaks, we weren't impressed.

We would've been more entertained watching Eva get undressed.

You struggled to get those rhymes out, like you were blanking on a test,

And, unfortunately for you, dawg, now you're messing with the best.

Please, just do it, tell me about how we dropped to number three,

Anything else out of your mouth would be a surprise to me,

We have an army that stretches farther than your eyes can even see,

And, when it comes time to fight some wars, we'll be sacking civs for free.

AYYYY, it's almost sad that we spoke before this,

I'm gonna feel really bad when I leave you crippled, drenched in your piss.

I'll just say this now; you have one verse to work on your diss,

Because, by the time verse 2 is through, you'll be suffering from rigor mortis.

---

Wow, I’m surprised you even made it this far.

However, I guess it’s also a surprise you’re not being ruled by a tsar.

You talk big about this army of yours,

But you’re such a coward that you’ve declared no wars.

You’ve committed an assassination,

But only because your empire’s so boring my body’s lost all sensation.

Your verses are the same,

Because at this point it isn’t even a fair game.

You’ve simply lost this one,

And after you type your second verse your rapping days are done.

You never even managed to found a religion,

But- what’s this carrier pigeon?

Oh, it has a list of all the civilizations that have a chance of winning.

The fact that you’re not on it isn’t an error in the printing-

A civilization that does nothing is who you're rapping for.

All you've done is build two things- and nothing more.

---

What a bummer. Am I really gonna need to dumb this down a bit?

Some of you dissed my last rhyme, and I'd hate to see this go to shit.

I'm sorry if it's seeming like I'm being inconsiderate,

But my flow's so fucking dank, and I think all y'all need a hit of it.

You're damn right that we've become one with the turtle.

As a matter a fact, I'd like it if you'd call us ""Yertle.""

Do you think we really care that our lands are infertile?

We've already overcome that one, measly hurdle.

I have four words for you, fool: Goddess of the Hunt.

Did that slip your memory, or were you putting on a front?

Your mild tone seems like you're afraid to be blunt,

But that's exactly what I'd expect from an ignorant cunt.

You should really shut up and try to spread your religion.

It's covering less ground than a carrier pigeon,

And, while you're at it, go fine-tune your lyric provision,

Because you're turning my win into an easy decision.

Pressing one button to LOCK YOUR CAPS; that ain't any one of the rules.

I'm not sure if you can win this rap if your civ lost in the battle.

Frankly, I'm a little bit worried the PRC will lose its capital

You got conquered by a civ that you historically conquered 4 times

Once you're out we'll take Hanoi and your lands will simply be all mines!

Why d'cha have Special Economic Zones, aren't you communist?

Come adopt Burma's ideology, we're democratic slash socialist.

Sickening how you force children to be your little red guards.

China gambled and lost while Burma still holds its wild card.

You're being bombared from 3 sides. At least a turtle has a shell!

I mean, in both the rap and the BR, China isn't doing so well.

China is losing; is that why you're sore?

You're a 5000 year-old grandpa, move out it's time for Burma to shine

With potential to kill Champa, then strike out at Viet from behind

My tea flows smoother, your tea's rough water

A book-burning tyrant is China's real father

Your verbal archer can't shoot straight past our three mountain ranges

You have to break a Great FireWall to read these reddit pages

Without our help in World War 2, you'd be in Imperial Japan's cages

Still sore about that invasion, your country still very racist

You have puny pointy sticks, that's what she said

No wonder China's stock is plummeting into the red

Red BANG! Red flag, Red guards: you sure have a Red Cult

You represent China: that's big enough of an insult

You're an underwhelming mod that screams ""UNCOOL"".

to turn one-fifty, being Chilean still was a crime

while in Corpus Christi we drank cold beers with a lime!

So watch out, this verse is only the first

we’re a full a grown empire while yer still being nursed

But maybe we’ll take you as part of our colonies,

cuz when this is over you’ll be forced down on your knees!

---
Next opponent's this goof? Time to mess with Texas

Looks like Sam Hou doesn't know what safe sex is

His pop's through the roof but who knows where his tech is,

'Cause pretty soon, Chile's eatin' grits for breakfast

Things are bigger in Texas, including your ego,

Though your name comes from tejas, I ain't your amigo

There ain't anything original about you,

Stole Chile's flag and the accent that the South use

Only thing from there's some shitty drink called Dr. Pepper

Hack off your limbs fall apart like a leper

Like a star all alone, you'll just fizzle out and die

You wry guys, tryin' to turtle by and fly high

Got less smarts than a horse fly,

u/SabyZ raps worse than a mute guy

All that dick suckin got your mouth dry

Goodbye

ENGLAND VS NORWAY
---

D’you notice that your “win” over Iceland wasn’t sweet

You see, they want revenge for their narrow defeat

So now it’s Norway’s turn — watch us turn up the heat;

And our brothers avenge; and you limeys defeat!

Your history is one of foreign conquest and fear

More tragedy at which you can shake than a spear

(Remember when you caved to the French that one year?)

You’re used to having all of your kings end like Lear

But what did you have, after the Roman collapse

They who brought society, you who took scraps

You sure didn’t thrive; the hist’ry books simply lapse

‘Till eight sixty-five, when we redrew the maps!

The Great Viking Army laid your country to burn

Our raiders didn’t discern, and crushed your kingdoms in turn

So don’t go all smarmy; it’s time for concern

For now just like then, with a win we’ll return!

---

More bloody Vikings? Alright then Norway,

You know the Swedes and Babs were just foreplay,

Betty's getting ready to spoil your day,

The Empire has coming to grab all the clay,

I'm fucking shit up with my massive population,

You're slumming it down in tundra ridden desolation,

You dream of Viking raids? I'm here to crush your scheme,

I'm a psychopathic Freddie Mercury, call me Killer Queen

You should give up before we take you by force,

Cos when we come it'll be a sad day to be Norse,

You're like someone from Frozen; Elsa, Anna, Olaf,

Do You Wanna Build An Army? Don't make me laugh,

You'll get battered in a war, cos Love ain't An Open Door,

I'm glorious, I'm furious, had a taste and I want more,

So don't try and win, seriously, just Let It Go,

And enjoy the brief time you've got left in Oslo

---
YAKUTIA VS AYYUBIDS
---

I’ve already won against the Russians that conquered your tribe,

But I suppose you could still give me a bribe.

You were only included in this game to take up space,

And yet people can still somehow say your name with a straight face.

You claim you’re tough just for surviving the Russian winter,

But you’d probably break down if you even got a splinter.

You’ve had everything handed to you on multiple silver platters,

But now your hopes for first place are in shatters.

We’ve had to fight for everything we have now,

But just because nobody wants to be by you means you’re a “sacred cow.”

You’ve done nothing but sit there and become one with the turtle,

Refusing to accept that your land is useless and infertile.

You think you’re a “beast of the east”,

While your people can’t even afford to have even a tiny feast.

You just live off of reindeer meat,

So admit that you’ve been beat.

Wait, wait. Hold up. Is that LuigiATL?

From the home of the pimps, the playas, and the southernplayalistic hell?

Hey, man, what's happenin'? I heard you got some stories to tell,

About Leonidas picking flowers? Yeah, I heard that shit went well.

Well, guess what? That's over. And, us Yaks, we weren't impressed.

We would've been more entertained watching Eva get undressed.

You struggled to get those rhymes out, like you were blanking on a test,

And, unfortunately for you, dawg, now you're messing with the best.

Please, just do it, tell me about how we dropped to number three,

Anything else out of your mouth would be a surprise to me,

We have an army that stretches farther than your eyes can even see,

And, when it comes time to fight some wars, we'll be sacking civs for free.

AYYYY, it's almost sad that we spoke before this,

I'm gonna feel really bad when I leave you crippled, drenched in your piss.

I'll just say this now; you have one verse to work on your diss,

Because, by the time verse 2 is through, you'll be suffering from rigor mortis.

I'm not sure if you can win this rap if your civ lost in the battle.

Frankly, I'm a little bit worried the PRC will lose its capital

You got conquered by a civ that you historically conquered 4 times

Once you're out we'll take Hanoi and your lands will simply be all mines!

Why d'cha have Special Economic Zones, aren't you communist?

Come adopt Burma's ideology, we're democratic slash socialist.

Sickening how you force children to be your little red guards.

China gambled and lost while Burma still holds its wild card.

You're being bombared from 3 sides. At least a turtle has a shell!

CHILE VS BUCCANEERS

""Three fucking cheers for the trucking Buccaneers""

Say their loyal pirate fans, but alas, they hold back tears,

Stuck in gears? Have no fear, Chile's here, now have a beer

Hold the rum and spears and listen while we ruin your careers!

You might catch a cold if you're fightin' 'gainst our empire

Stuck in the mud, and you bloody suck, vampire!

Your verses aren't exactly ones that inspire,

And while you want to be a great, your dreams have already expired.

It's safe to say subscriber overboard 'cause Morgan knows--

That loyalty can't be bought with a pirate hat and dough!

Your smarts are wearing thin, but I think you know,

We'll have landships by the time you get your ships to land, ho,

Snap out of MK I, and come back to the present!

I've got a suggestion Mr. Morgan, and I'll try to pleasant:

Listen to Bernardo O'Higgins: e. g. the main event,

And prepare for the winter of your discontent!

---

Your response to my rap did help ease the tension,

4 days to prepare, and NOT ONE WORD mentioned!

Empty phrases don't faze us -- soldiers, stand at attention!

Now, to set the facts straight, and do away with your pretension.

Your catchphrase is ""arrr"" but that's a Hollywood invention,

And ""lmao"" is just a modern convention

Growl and grumble all you want, but I think I should mention

That you're laughing your ass right out of contention!

Most of your subscribers joined your camp on a whim,

But your numbers will dim, 'cause your soldiers can't swim!

Chile's ships are supreme, and your navy is slim

Knockin' on your backdoor, 'cause your chances are grim.

You're never a real contender in any AI game,

It's not TPang's fault -- you've got only yourself to blame

Now I've painted you a picture, this painting needs a name:

Red, White, and Blue, (we've steamrolled you) for Chile's won the game.

TEXAS VS BLACKFOOT

Um, Houston, we have a problem:

Who’s gonna clean this mess up when we’re all done?

Are you Black or a Crow

cuz I really don’t know,

but it really doesn’t matter because this is MY show!

Seriously what’s up with your name?

This is Texas’ rise to fame, but there’s only you to blame

When y’all get struck out of this ballgame!

So don’t mess with Texas, that’s a fact

Any fight with us is completely stacked

Because against Sam Houston, you’ll get out rapped!

When a war is fought against the Texan Nation

we come out on top with the highest population

so y’all better think twice cuz for us this is a vacation

and when this day is told, it’ll be a Texan narration.

---

Like a little crow you take flight because you don’t wanna lose this fight

but I’ll tell you how it is when you pick a fight with me: unless y’all wanna die you best run and flee!

This battle isn’t fair; no enemies anywhere, but when it comes to blow you really couldn’t bear

the might of the Lone-Star, we go far, we’ll kick your ass on our way to the bar! 

My people are fucking like rabbits, you’ve got bad breeding habits:

y’all dropped from the top ten in population like some starving reservation

just not even a nation that’s worth taking note!

You beat our army by 5000 men, but every Texan counts more than ten

and when we defend your rank will descend further than your Mexican friend!

So come at me with all you’ve got, everything that you’ve done we’ve already forgot

so you’ll rot in the north under the Inuit’s weight, so make like the Australians and

“fuck off, mate!”

---

ICELAND VS ENGLAND

ay yo Iceland

I'm coming to the land of the ice and snowmen,

Army? What army? You've got like no men,

I'll hit you from Scotland with my longbowmen,

You're even more irrelevant than the Romans,

I'm firaxis, sucka, you're not fighting a mod now,

I'm attacking, fucker, I'm not fighting for cod now,

I'm not diplomatic, asking for trade agreements

My tactic is to inflict major bereavements,

You better believe it, I'm a fucking lunatic,

I'm not a little Arctic bitch like Ekheunik

I've got no liking for Vikings, my pikes'll be striking

Whilst you're pathetically fighting with...what? Ice picks?

You'll be the second Atlantic island that I've whipped,

And you know what I did to Ireland was tragic

Rather be crushed now, or later? Take your pick,

But choose quick, before my boys hit Reykjavik,

---

Greetings Queen ‘Lizbeth, I am your friendly neighbor

It’s about time you come to face the greatest Viking raider

Perhaps you’ll remember in your long lost past

How my Viking fleet left your country thoroughly trashed

For hundreds of years your empire hobbled to survive

While on our spoils we grew rich and started to thrive

What’s that you say? That this is a different situation?

You seem to forget you’re up against a Viking nation

We control Greenland, Iceland, and a killer navy

And everyone knows that 2 more movement doesn’t beat Icelandic bravery

While your people sip tea and mumble posh phrases

A cloud of doom shall rain down on your fancy quivering faces

Once again, we shall leave your towns as piles of rubble

Fight me or not, killing you either way will be no trouble

---

Seriously 'friendly' Iceland, you want to talk navy?

You want a sea battle with me, are you fucking crazy?

You're happy to take the time to try to diss my rhymes, 

You'll pipe down once I arrive with my ships of the line,

They'll soon make your islands mine, they're so bloody elite,

Maybe you should think about just admitting defeat,

Go home, have a sauna, read a saga, relax,

Perhaps you won't notice Reykjavik getting sacked,

I admit you've got a lot of towns, but on the other hand,

You've only got so many cities because no-one wants that land,

Just wait, you'll soon become a minor Arctic rump state,

You'll collapse like your banking sector back in '08,

You want to lord it over Jorvik? Ha, Come and get it,

I'm not even concerned with you, you're so pathetic,

Threatened by France, Ireland, Portugal, but you know what, son?

I've got ninety nine problems but Iceland ain't one.

---

So here you are again Elizabeth, are you ready for round two?

Because even fanboys saying “remember 1066” isn’t enough to save you

Judging by your first verse you can barely create a rhyme

While each of my verses flows smoothly and perfectly sublime

You say you’ll hit me from Scotland with your puny archer’s bows?

The Irish own more of the isles than you, ya couldn’t hit me if you chose

You may have the small advantage of getting to go first

But that’ll only ensure that your punishment will be the worst

As it stands now, our city count is more than twice yours

And you’re already split in half by the channel, of course

At least you admit that you’re a tea-crazed raving lunatic

So that when I crush you I don’t have to be apologetic

Your pikes and bows have nothing on a whirling battleaxe

And some Robin Hood gear won’t help you face the facts:

Even the French are doing better than your so-called monarchy

And as soon as we set foot on the your isles, it’ll be true anarchy

To save you now, you’d need the aide of TPangolin or some magic trick

But as it stands right now, your lands belong to the great Reykjavik 

---

NORWAY VS BABYLON

Yo Babylon! Get your battle on

‘Cause all you do is watch and prattle on

You’ve hype! We get it; let’s move along

Talk a little bit ‘bout your meta-con

You say you’re big; you say you’re strong

But all you really do is make me yawn

Trapped in a lake in the ice all along, 

at the Ass end of the world, where you belong

Nuke sub you say? ‘Kay; let’s discuss

The special circumstances that made it thus

The foundational truss that started this fuss:

You only exist in this game to watch us!

What do you do? Ugh; where to begin

All you got’s an underwater looney bin

We fight and write; slick licks we spin

All you do is watch — so watch us win.

---

Seems that you’ve quit yammerin’

But then again you quit battlin’

The fans want a rap; they’re clamorin’

So lemme spin a tale ‘bout the Pangolin:

Ever stop and wonder how it came to be

That you got picked to be ‘neath the sea

By grand decree of our referee —

“Babs’ll be the eyes of the bourgeoisie!”

Sixty-three civs and he chose the one

Whom nobody’d miss, to miss out on the fun

While we’re all in bliss, fightin’ under the sun

Go sail your abyss, ‘cause Nebby, you’re done.

---

Huh? What was that?

 Sorry, I was asleep because its just... (Starts rapping) 

Too easy to igNorway you,
 
This battle you will rue.

 No way to win,

 Lying to yourself 's still a sin. 

(Yawns Sorry, still a little sleepy...)

Cause I just took a nap,
 
Trying to get ready to rap.

 Took a little too long,
 
Your name, Snoreway, ain't wrong. 

So far you've done little,
 
But sit and whittle,
 
Away my time.

 Not even one good rhyme. 

Babylon is here to play,

 You winning? No way.

 So I say bring the Battle,
 
These lines like a gun I can gattle. 

---

SPARTA VS AYYUBIDS

Hey Ayy, this is mayday

cuz it seems you drew a fuckin' playdate

with a cray jay, whose gon' sautee

your fucking ass, burn it like an ashtray.

So you stay way from my clay, kay?

Vaporize your ass like hair-spray

Imma knock you down like childs-play

like a snow-dame on a hot day!

So vrin vrinn! I gotta engine

in this horse I borrowed from the Trojans

and I'm gonna drive it down to Dvin

and slay the women children and men!

So beep beep! You can't stop me

gotta tight read on this hot beat

in the front seat of this big tree

that I'm drivin' round the fucking red sea!

Face it, you are not an MC

armies softer than fucking brie cheese

and with rhymes to match, so don't you agree

That you'll never be a match for me?

---

Here before me I find a “King Leo the Young”,

Yet your mere existence was a slip of the tongue.

You spend your days picking flowers,

And yet you think you’re one of the “world powers.”

Your pretend “empire” is doomed to fail,

And the land we’ll conquer from you will be put up for sale.

You conquered land from the Byzantine State,

But you’ve just sped up your attrition rate.

We’ll take your African colony, your coastal lands,

For all of your empire is about to change hands.

With the nations of Rome, Armenia, and the strong Ayyubid Nation,

We’ll give your oppressed people some much-needed liberation.

This battle, you’ve already lost.

We’ll stop your mistake of a “nation” at any cost.

---

How dare you call me weak? How dare you insult ME?!

I'll crush you, little sheikh, like I did Thermopylae! 

Never ever would I ever think a thing you say is clever

Put me up against whomever and I'll smash their hopes forever!

Ranks on ranks of hardened men will crush your precious fighters then

Be home in time to pen some rhymes and crush you weaklings yet again!

You think I'm fucking playing, friend!?

I do not break, I do not bend,

Let's not pretend you can contend,

You're out of time, you're at your end!

These rhymes I've penned transcend the trend

You can't hold on, you can't defend,

So you best close your eyes and bend

And prepare your fat rear end!

---

I don’t even know how you got to this level,

Since after this victory I’m going to revel.

You do know that Sparta didn’t even exist during the Trojan War?

But no, back then your King Leo was taking his time in a flower store.

This alleged “army” of yours is clearly fake,

Otherwise we wouldn’t be eating through your cities like cake.

We’re coming for the Aegean, the Adriatic,

And I’m sorry to say this loss for you will be quite traumatic.

The trumpets of war sound,

And the Ayyubid Empire will span the world around.

We’ll march from Cairo to Greece,

Then we’ll sack your cities and take your mythical “Golden Fleece”.

You haven’t even touched my home land,

And I think you’ll agree your losses are getting out of hand.

This is the last verse you’ll write,

But your chances of winning weren’t even all right.

You never were a serious contender,

And now it’s time for you to surrender.

---

PERSIA VS YAKUTIA

The Persians are hot, while the yaks are just cold.

Just face it now, guys, we're the empire of gold.

What's the matter you yaks?

Are you all snowed in?

Cuz your AI is as crippled

As if I kicked it in the shin

The Yakuts are just brutes

Who haven't done shit

They're digging themselves into a bottomless pit.

There's one picture of you in every single album

But from what I've seen and heard, there's never an outcome.

You're just kinda there, not doin anything soon

The only time you're productive is once in a blue moon!

Now learn from round 1, I always finish strong,

So enjoy yourself now, no worry, it won't be long.

---

What's up, JCPoly? My name is Funhau5, of the Yaks,

And you're about to suffer from my next verbal attacks.

Round 1 against Japan was just me testing the water,

But, now, I'm gonna hit you with some lyrical manslaughter.

Or how about man's laughter? Cuz that's what I'll be hearing after

You declare a war and it becomes your own disaster.

Darius is slacking. He really needs to start attacking,

and if he doesn't do it soon, it'll be his fudge that they're packing.

You're out-teched, incompetent, and starting to look like China.

How many more immortals can you pull out of your vagina?

Why don't you ask the Trung Sisters if they have any tips

On how to fight a war with your fat pussy lips?

Yes, that was vulgar. It was pretty damn rude,

And I have some other things that I would like to exude,

But friendship with Persians is definitely not one of them,

Cuz Darius has five cities, and all I do is make fun of him.

---

Nah man, our pussy's pretty big, but it ain't as big as yours,

It goes so deep you should start giving tours!

Based on the fact that your only a faction,

It would probably be the ALL the Khans biggest attraction. (+2tourisim)

Hey turtle, bro, don't take it too hard,

You've dug your self too deep, you need a Saint Bernard. 

And even that might not work, it's just too late to recover

Even with Indiana Jones, you'd never be discovered. 

You live in tundra, where people never sweat

We be chillin in the sand while you accumulating debt

We got the gold, the mountains, and the immortals so sweet

Guy, just Give up now, we got you beat

The whole goal of the game is to stand the test of time,

Where as you, poor yaks, can't even stand my sick rhyme. 

---

""The Persians are hot, while the Yaks are just cold?""

Dude, what are you, like, six-years-old?

If anything, I would think the Persians are mild,

Because it seems like their first verse was made by a child.

You do, for some reason, have something to say,

About how our empire chooses to play.

You make it sound like we can only delay,

But you'll have to speak up; there's a Great Wall in the way.

When's the last time you read back to Part 5?

I stumbled upon it in my Great Library's archives,

And, ever since then, you've been mentioned just thrice,

You captured one, shitty city, and now you're giving advice?

Well, here's a news flash: you're success is not gonna last,

I can't wait for Afghanistan to munch on that ass.

And, if you come at me again with something Dr. Seuss shitted,

Be aware that I already have your fucking noose fitted.

BURMA VS AUSTRALIA

Hah! Burma? We gonna burn ya, 

Gonna leave this battle in an urn, ya. 

You got no room to expand! Go and start a band,

With Vietnam, Champa, Sri Lanka, set up in Bagan! 

Soon, When we roll through Rangoon, 

All we gonna leave is runes. 

We'll need our diggers, To dig the graves Of you 

Burmese Piggers, when we roll through. 

In what little land You have, 

looks like you got Thailand! 

Soon to be My Land, When we get there, 

Gonna take no prisoners, Don't need no Khmer.

Coz that's just what this country needs, 

A peacock, In a frock, On a rock.

---

If your rap was supposed to bring me pain

I think Australia's gone a little insane

You're a RailroadRider with no hype train

Cuz your ancestors came to 'straya in chains

Call yourself a continent? You're just a big fat island

Watch us conquer you like we conquered Thailand

I use complex references with a hint of appropriate banter

Your culture's an utter failure, according to Burmese standards

We have our own measurements, fuck the imperial and the metric systems

Watch your words when you rap against the stronkest Indochinese kingdom

You're a pussy 'Straya, tried to break off from Britain throgh diplomacy

We fought four wars, they only won one and we still drove out the Japanese

Then we banned the use of English, but that's still your official language

Why's the Union Jack in your flag, let go of your colonial heritage

Even useless Cham pirates come to Sydney to plunder

Your hype train has sunk, it's gone down and under

So unimportant, mob_cleaner put you out in the comments

'Straya has many fans compensating for its incompetence

You may second in the rankings, but you're losing to the First Nation

Your city placements are wacky, Parkes needs more concentration

Before you chide us for being turtles, utilise the mirror and look at yourself

It's gauranteed, the Kimberley will be fighting for their continental shelf

Please call me Peacock, cuz you'll make me Burmese Royalty

Australia are you kidding me with that measly attack on the Philippines?

This is domination only and Anawratha's the great general

An average writer, Parkes died before 'Straya became federal

In these parts, Parkes parked in the parks

And missed out on Uluru cuz you were all bark. 

Your rap is long but devoid of meaning

There's simply something wrong with your rhyme scheming

Don't use these words if you don't know how to pronounce them

Khmer and ""you lie"" rhyme. Your lie simply denounced them

You're all bark and no bite; politicians can't win this fight

Grab a torchlight; we fight through the night 'till you're out of sight

We'll squeeze you tight and expand borders beyond the Burmese kite. 

Our fans easy to excite. Fear our military might cuz it delivers you strife

Burma's culture whoring is Australian tourism's kryptonite

Most people sent me their raps, but 4 people have not done so so far. Even if your opponent has not sent a rap, write me a second verse because I will try to get the verses off of them. Last time someone mentioned doing a loser's bracket with all the losers of the first round. I can't do this because I'm too busy with the competition as it is, but if someone wants to do it, go ahead.

The next verses will be due in **Wednesday, 5pm Brit time**, but I think by now we all know I'm a little late with these, so don't expect to be out then. Without further ado, here are the rappers in Round 2:

Chile (/u/Atlas_Schmatlas) vs buccaneers (/u/MillinerJones)

Texas (/u/SabyZ) vs Blackfoot (/u/Gresskarpai)

Iceland (/u/Wigmaster999) vs England (/u/admiral_ifan)

Norway (/u/Nestourai) vs Babylon (/u/Mista_Ginger)

Sparta (/u/CAPSSMOCK) vs Ayyubids (/u/Luigiatl)

Persia (/u/JCPoly) vs Yakutia (/u/Funhau5)

Mongolia (/u/wasgoodlilma) vs China (/u/Protroid)

Burma (/u/EmeraldRange) vs Australia (/u/RailroadRider)

CHILE VS BUCCANEERS

""Three fucking cheers for the trucking Buccaneers""

Say their loyal pirate fans, but alas, they hold back tears,

Stuck in gears? Have no fear, Chile's here, now have a beer

Hold the rum and spears and listen while we ruin your careers!
 
You might catch a cold if you're fightin' 'gainst our empire

Stuck in the mud, and you bloody suck, vampire!

Your verses aren't exactly ones that inspire,

And while you want to be a great, your dreams have already expired.
 
It's safe to say subscriber overboard 'cause Morgan knows--

That loyalty can't be bought with a pirate hat and dough!

Your smarts are wearing thin, but I think you know,

We'll have landships by the time you get your ships to land, ho,
 
Snap out of MK I, and come back to the present!

I've got a suggestion Mr. Morgan, and I'll try to pleasant:

Listen to Bernardo O'Higgins: e. g. the main event,

And prepare for the winter of your discontent!

TEXAS VS BLACKFOOT

Um, Houston, we have a problem:

Who’s gonna clean this mess up when we’re all done?

Are you Black or a Crow

cuz I really don’t know,

but it really doesn’t matter because this is MY show!

Seriously what’s up with your name?

This is Texas’ rise to fame, but there’s only you to blame

When y’all get struck out of this ballgame!

So don’t mess with Texas, that’s a fact

Any fight with us is completely stacked

Because against Sam Houston, you’ll get out rapped!

When a war is fought against the Texan Nation

we come out on top with the highest population

so y’all better think twice cuz for us this is a vacation

and when this day is told, it’ll be a Texan narration.

ICELAND VS ENGLAND

ay yo Iceland

I'm coming to the land of the ice and snowmen,

Army? What army? You've got like no men,

I'll hit you from Scotland with my longbowmen,

You're even more irrelevant than the Romans,

I'm firaxis, sucka, you're not fighting a mod now,

I'm attacking, fucker, I'm not fighting for cod now,

I'm not diplomatic, asking for trade agreements

My tactic is to inflict major bereavements,

You better believe it, I'm a fucking lunatic,

I'm not a little Arctic bitch like Ekheunik

I've got no liking for Vikings, my pikes'll be striking

Whilst you're pathetically fighting with...what? Ice picks?

You'll be the second Atlantic island that I've whipped,

And you know what I did to Ireland was tragic

Rather be crushed now, or later? Take your pick,

But choose quick, before my boys hit Reykjavik,

---

Greetings Queen ‘Lizbeth, I am your friendly neighbor

It’s about time you come to face the greatest Viking raider

Perhaps you’ll remember in your long lost past

How my Viking fleet left your country thoroughly trashed

For hundreds of years your empire hobbled to survive

While on our spoils we grew rich and started to thrive

What’s that you say? That this is a different situation?

You seem to forget you’re up against a Viking nation

We control Greenland, Iceland, and a killer navy

And everyone knows that 2 more movement doesn’t beat Icelandic bravery

While your people sip tea and mumble posh phrases

A cloud of doom shall rain down on your fancy quivering faces

Once again, we shall leave your towns as piles of rubble

Fight me or not, killing you either way will be no trouble

---

NORWAY VS BABYLON

Yo Babylon! Get your battle on

‘Cause all you do is watch and prattle on

You’ve hype! We get it; let’s move along

Talk a little bit ‘bout your meta-con

You say you’re big; you say you’re strong

But all you really do is make me yawn

Trapped in a lake in the ice all along, 

at the Ass end of the world, where you belong

Nuke sub you say? ‘Kay; let’s discuss

The special circumstances that made it thus

The foundational truss that started this fuss:

You only exist in this game to watch us!

What do you do? Ugh; where to begin

All you got’s an underwater looney bin

We fight and write; slick licks we spin

All you do is watch — so watch us win.

SPARTA VS AYYUBIDS

Hey Ayy, this is mayday

cuz it seems you drew a fuckin' playdate

with a cray jay, whose gon' sautee

your fucking ass, burn it like an ashtray.

So you stay way from my clay, kay?

Vaporize your ass like hair-spray

Imma knock you down like childs-play

like a snow-dame on a hot day!

So vrin vrinn! I gotta engine

in this horse I borrowed from the Trojans

and I'm gonna drive it down to Dvin

and slay the women children and men!

So beep beep! You can't stop me

gotta tight read on this hot beat

in the front seat of this big tree

that I'm drivin' round the fucking red sea!

Face it, you are not an MC

armies softer than fucking brie cheese

and with rhymes to match, so don't you agree

That you'll never be a match for me?

---

Here before me I find a “King Leo the Young”,

Yet your mere existence was a slip of the tongue.

You spend your days picking flowers,

And yet you think you’re one of the “world powers.”

Your pretend “empire” is doomed to fail,

And the land we’ll conquer from you will be put up for sale.

You conquered land from the Byzantine State,

But you’ve just sped up your attrition rate.

We’ll take your African colony, your coastal lands,

For all of your empire is about to change hands.

With the nations of Rome, Armenia, and the strong Ayyubid Nation,

We’ll give your oppressed people some much-needed liberation.

This battle, you’ve already lost.

We’ll stop your mistake of a “nation” at any cost.

---

PERSIA VS YAKUTIA

The Persians are hot, while the yaks are just cold.

Just face it now, guys, we're the empire of gold.

What's the matter you yaks?

Are you all snowed in?

Cuz your AI is as crippled

As if I kicked it in the shin

The Yakuts are just brutes

Who haven't done shit

They're digging themselves into a bottomless pit.

There's one picture of you in every single album

But from what I've seen and heard, there's never an outcome.

You're just kinda there, not doin anything soon

The only time you're productive is once in a blue moon!

Now learn from round 1, I always finish strong,

So enjoy yourself now, no worry, it won't be long.

---

What's up, JCPoly? My name is Funhau5, of the Yaks,

And you're about to suffer from my next verbal attacks.

Round 1 against Japan was just me testing the water,

But, now, I'm gonna hit you with some lyrical manslaughter.

Or how about man's laughter? Cuz that's what I'll be hearing after

You declare a war and it becomes your own disaster.

Darius is slacking. He really needs to start attacking,

and if he doesn't do it soon, it'll be his fudge that they're packing.

You're out-teched, incompetent, and starting to look like China.

How many more immortals can you pull out of your vagina?

Why don't you ask the Trung Sisters if they have any tips

On how to fight a war with your fat pussy lips?

Yes, that was vulgar. It was pretty damn rude,

And I have some other things that I would like to exude,

But friendship with Persians is definitely not one of them,

Cuz Darius has five cities, and all I do is make fun of him.

MONGOLIA VS CHINA

NOWHERE LEFT TO RUN, KHAN

HORSEMAN I GOT YOU CORNERED

SPITTING THE SICKEST NEW SHIT

ITS A GREAT RAPPING LEAP FORWARD

BARBARIAN HORDES AT MY GATE

HORSES SHITTING ON MY LAWN

DIDN'T YOU SEE THE WALL?

YOU STEPPED TO THE WRONG HAN

YOU THINK YOU KNOW STRENGTH

BUT THIS IS BRAINS OVER BRAWN

I'M MORE SISKO THAN KIRK

YOU WON'T CATCH ME SCREAMING KHAN!

NOW WE MARCH TO YOUR CITIES

MEET WITH A WARM RECEPTION

I GOT RESPECT FOR ALL MY FOES

BUT YOU'RE THE EXCEPTION

BURMA VS AUSTRALIA

Hah! Burma? We gonna burn ya, 

Gonna leave this battle in an urn, ya. 

You got no room to expand! Go and start a band,

With Vietnam, Champa, Sri Lanka, set up in Bagan! 

Soon, When we roll through Rangoon, 

All we gonna leave is runes. 

We'll need our diggers, To dig the graves Of you 

Burmese Piggers, when we roll through. 

In what little land You have, 

looks like you got Thailand! 

Soon to be My Land, When we get there, 

Gonna take no prisoners, Don't need no Khmer.

Coz that's just what this country needs, 

A peacock, In a frock, On a rock.

---

If your rap was supposed to bring me pain

I think Australia's gone a little insane

You're a RailroadRider with no hype train

Cuz your ancestors came to 'straya in chains

Call yourself a continent? You're just a big fat island

Watch us conquer you like we conquered Thailand

I use complex references with a hint of appropriate banter

Your culture's an utter failure, according to Burmese standards

We have our own measurements, fuck the imperial and the metric systems

Watch your words when you rap against the stronkest Indochinese kingdom

You're a pussy 'Straya, tried to break off from Britain throgh diplomacy

We fought four wars, they only won one and we still drove out the Japanese

Then we banned the use of English, but that's still your official language

Why's the Union Jack in your flag, let go of your colonial heritage

Even useless Cham pirates come to Sydney to plunder

Your hype train has sunk, it's gone down and under

So unimportant, mob_cleaner put you out in the comments

'Straya has many fans compensating for its incompetence

You may second in the rankings, but you're losing to the First Nation

Your city placements are wacky, Parkes needs more concentration

Before you chide us for being turtles, utilise the mirror and look at yourself

It's gauranteed, the Kimberley will be fighting for their continental shelf

I'm betting on Yakutia.) 

Anyway, instead of going down to 19, were going down to 16! That means that three more people go out (Duh) and that there will be no more byes! Hooray, fairness for one and all!

Even if you go out, it doesn't mean you were bad or anything, it just means your utter shit (jk, all the raps I received I absolutely loved, and it's a shame that over half have to go out). The next verses are due in **Saturday, 12am Birt time**! Anyway, here are the battles for Round 2!

BABYLONS ""DONT FUCK WITH ME"" RAPS:

Even though I got a week one bye,

Thought I might spit verse for fun. 

Let all the others know not to try, 

Rap against Nebby, you're done. 

Lyrics be nuclear like our subs, 

Under ice we see you fight. 

While you still fighting with spears and clubs, 

Be too simple for rhymes I write. 

Watch me win Babylon this battle, 

I'll be king, call me Royale. 

While you all sit and prattle, 

I'll be chillin' at Nassau Canal.

---

In case you didn't hear,

 Babylon gonna reiterate.

 All you can kiss my rear,

 0 out of 10 your raps I rate. 


I take all challengers,

 Got the battle in the bag.

 Don't even need to try to win,

 But you? Gag. 

So come at me one and all.

 Beating you will be a ball.

 Got rhymes sharper than Spartan spears,

 Already crushin' all my peers. 

... 

Watch me win Babylon this battle,

 I'll be king, call me Royale.

 While you all sit and prattle,

 I'll be chillin' at Nassau Canal.

CHILE VS INCA: 

Your name is gagging4gags, so here's a joke: 

Who's only got 6 cities, and a pop that's broke? 

Unlike your username suggests, here's to hoping you don't choke

-- Until the Chilean Renaissance when you're still livin' in Baroque! 

No need to serve you, Pachacuti, 

You're self-servin' like Tutti Frutti 

Snipe your terrace farms for booty 

O'Higgins, no scope, Call of Duty 

Valparaiso should've been ominous, 

Prepare for the red white and blue apocalypse 

Fuck off Remus, this is Romulus 

With failure you've become synonymous 

First in military on the continent, 

Wreaking havoc on your confidence 

Combined with Eva and Brazil's incompetence 

The only way we play is dominance.

---

Hey Chile nice start there - very mountainous, 

I guess it's easy to defend but where's your growth? 

Well we've got terrace farms but an annoying blot of blue, 

So when we've finished feasting we'll grow off you. 

Our expansions lookin' better no Colombia in game, 

But your position with Argentina is looking quite the same. 

Only this time they're lookin' angry and more strong, 

I think they'll take your cities, doubt you'll prove me wrong. 

Oh look what's that? Do I see Part 5? 

Looks like we're gonna eat Brazil alive. 

Generating more spots for our UI, 

By the time we get to you you'll quickly die.

---

Your first rap must be some sort of Pre-Columbian artifice

What it lacks in length, it makes up for in artlessness

No food? Fucker we got the Temple of Artemis

As soon we start battle you're gonna wish for an armistice

I did some counting (without using a quipu, mind you)

You've got 25 combat units -- we've got 29 dude

Without including 20 triremes, oh shit, you're so screwed

You don't see our troops? Turn around and LOOK BEHIND YOU

You said you got terrace farms yet I haven't seen one,

Pachacuti's too busy making illegitimate sons?

Our cities unfortified 'cause we don't need 'em to be

Our empire already stretches from sea to shining sea

Eat all you want, 'cause we don't intend to build tall,

Lay off the food, and try and watch your mouth

Better send your bastard sons to man the wall,

'Cause in this part of the world winter comes from the south.

MAYANS VS BUCCANEERS

You think you got the high seas? I’ll put on your fuckin’ knees 

You think you’ve got the land lead? I only see a desperate need 

To spread your seed Make you into a gentile 

And then I’ll defile Your precious canal 

We’ll see who’s banal Build your terracotta army 

But it ain’t gonna help Cuz Pacal is getting smarmy 

You motha-buccin’ whelp When things are getting heady 

Got atlatls ready. We gunnin’ for ya Henry

Coming straight from the Port of my plundering spree 

We are the 12 sail terror of the Caribbean Sea 

We do what we want because a pirate is free 

The world's gonna fall to the b u double C 

We gonna make the world crunk with our rum and distilleries 

Gonna make the world burn with our ships and artillery 

Gonna make it rain gold with our treasurer so glittery 

Gonna make our opposition walk the plank-- literally 

Well rattle your atalatals with our cannons &amp; paddles 

Cut you up like cattle win the battle 

And take a victory ride through our canal at Panama 

It's your apocalypse now, start retirement planning brah.

Congrats! Your first verse! You can make words rhyme! 

But you can't retaliate for four hundred year's time! 

Yeah you used your great writer It wasn't an exciter 

now my fighters Have invaded, burn your palace with a lighter! 

I saw your first verse full of land lubber blubber 

And I've seen better shit from my poop deck scrubber! 

So don't make plans, leave yo calendars blank 

Cuz the B-U-double-C's gonna Make you walk the plank!

TEXAS VS MEXICO:

Hey, is that the sound of armies running away? 

Well it must be the Mexicans getting bored today! 

Let me tell y’all what will happen when you take a rash action 

against the Lone-star faction, you get a reaction 

that y’all just didn’t expect! We crushed your friends in the east, 

but they tried at least but you cannot compete against Sam Houston’s Elite! 

You’re next, so before you get wrecked, 

y’all better show Texas some respect! 

We’ve got Baltimore, Lincoln has lost your war, 

but don’t be so quick to rush out the door 

so I can make sure y’all get the arrows that y’all paid for! 

So have your fun while I finish my steak brisket, 

But if y’all want Austin, come and take it!

---

Benito – you’re too slow, 

couldn’t get a good verse so I got another go!

No way you’ll win when y’all can’t repeat the Alamo!

Now go! Run back to your walls,

y’all have no balls, this is where Mexico falls

turn your land in to malls and shit on your legacy!

I need no glitches to put y’all in your ditches

then relax with my bitches on the gulf,

it’s my destiny! 

I’m a cowboy, I destroy

stoppin’ invaders is what I enjoy

and so your little ploy ain’t impressin’ me

This is Battle Royale MAKK TWO!

The only loser here IS YOU!

And the when your empire falls and history calls,

the last leader standing will be SAMMY HOU!

BLACKFOOT VS FRANCE

I thought I was gonna rap against the sioux 

But no, out of all people i ended up with YOU 

Napoleon, famous for being a gnome 

Too bad you can’t beat anyone else than Rome 

Yeah, run away with your wine and your baguettes 

Or else I WILL make sure you’ll have regrets 

You want an empire? You’ll have to change yo’ plans 

Soon you’ll see black feet all over yo’ lands 

Just waiting for the world congress to convene 

We’ll make you relive the 18th of June 1815 

You know your new city, Neapolis? 

Ain’t gonna be long before it’s a fuckin’ necropolis 

I’ll do to you what the germans did to Lorraine and Alsace

Next part, to see your empire, you’ll need a magnifying glass!

---

Yeah, I see you there, Napoleon, trying to abscond

 Just admit that you’re way too scared to respond

 Just hang around I’ll tell you a story-

But only if you hand me the Louisiana territory!

 Once upon a time you ended up on an island

 But I’ll never let you come into my land

 Yeah there ain’t a single way you can escape

 You’ll have plenty of time to eat your thousand-layered Crepe

 You guessed it, it’s time for your annihilation

 French as you are; immediate capitulation

 Make your way for the Blackfoot confederation

 We’ll show you how to win a game of Civilization

 Hint hint: It involves radiation!

INUIT VS ICELAND

I am Ingolfur Arnarson, leader of the Icelandic vikings 

And I’m afraid that my appearance here bodes you some ill tidings 

You’d better run and hide in an igloo, pathetic Ekheunik, 

‘Cause I might be drinking from your skull at my next Icelandic picnic! 

You can’t beat an Icelander at a glorious rap battle 

Our UA’s geared towards Great Writing, so spare me all your prattle 

Let’s face it, your civ’s basically just the Sioux’s little brother 

Compare a rag-tag bunch of seal hunters to me? I’m a Viking warrior! 

When you try to cross from the mainland, you’ll meet my longboat fleet 

If you forward-settling bastards settle Greenland, you’ll be facing defeat

I believe it’s time for you seal-hunters to cede the lands of snow to us 

Or we’ll take them by force and you’ll run away in fear, wuss 

The only reason I can conceive that I won’t win this fray 

Is if the Sioux get to you first and whip you anyway

---

Waddup, Iceland, ya gonna get beat 

cause you be fucking with the true kings of the ice sheet. 

This battles gonna end in our reykjavik-tory. 

Your thingstead? Yo your things dead, 

our rhymes are straight fire we skalding you, 

So we think it's time that you inuksuk our dicks 

If crouchin' in on my borders is what I feel Ima club u bitch, 

just like a fuckin' seal. You think you come from the land of Ice and Snow? 

All you know is how to blow! 

Descendants of a Viking King 

Destined to become My Bottom Bitch Queen 

You came to my land once, tryin' to expand 

I bitch slapped you, knocked you down, with my righthand 

Selfish, you threw a fit, chickened out, it was neat 

It's nice and warm there with those volcanoes for heat 

But I will kindle my fires with your peoples feet 

Your name is Bullshit, A lie, Deceit 

Ingólfr Arnarson ([ˈiŋkoulvʏr̥ ˈartnar̥sɔn])[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_Icelandic] 

You'll be kissing OurOwnAsses-son

Ingolfur Kissing-your-asses-son? 

More like Engulfing Armies-now-son!

Oh, you made me sad, it’s enough to make a grown man cry ;-;

It’s so sad that your rhymes are so pitiful, but I guess, you tried :P

I’m afraid, tiny child, that the #Inuitcan’twinit this time

Since your rapping and rhyming’s so bad that it’s nearly a crime

I mean, look at your rhythm, the beat is bordering insanity

And even then, the only words you use are just so much profanity!

The only thing to save your civ is your massive fanbase

But even those biased fanboys won’t be your saving grace

That’s right, flee in terror from the fleet of Iceland

It’s a shame that my Viking fleet moves fast as the north wind

Even in your own rap you can’t stop yakking about seals

But those blubber-beasts won’t do you no good, get real!

My warriors’ whirling axes make the speed of light wish that it was faster

So please remember as I crush you that Iceland is everybody’s master

I would have killed you last except we’re adjacent alphabetically

So I guess I’ll just kill you first, and look on you sympathetically

Our skaldin raps will melt your icecaps Ingolf your land, 

your knecks hanging by a strand

Your homeland volcanic like our raps satanic 

We're an iceberg and youre about to go titanic

We'll spit and roast you like souvlaki 

man your rhymes are so tacky to beat us you gonna have to get laki

we wear fur coats when we sink your boats 

Our ice sheet fleet just cant be beat

You're nothing we confuse you for a store of frozen foods 

we live in igloos youre all a load of poos

Iceland? Master? Gonna have to blast you faster

Less land and less population? All a sign of an inferior ice-nation

The Sioux don't threaten us So beat them we will 

Then youre gonna have to Blackfoot the bill

Your cities have such stupid names We'll kill,

crush and maim Ingolfur Arnarson, Our raps are arson

Your viking navy not gonna be your saviour 

So its time we beat you back to Scandinavia

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

IRELAND VS ENGLAND

Battle against Ireland? Shit, only one way to go

make a few- well, loads- of jokes about potatoes

You'll be in trouble when my guns are in Dublin

wipe off that smug grin, my subs'll have you unsubbing.

Your rhymes are weak, the famine's hit your brain,

you're not Battle Royale, you're the Hunger Games.

Your army's tame, mine is high and mighty,

making you flighty, straight outta Blighty,

you gonna strike me? I'm asking politely

before I come from York to Cork, fighting

knick knack paddy whack, sipping my tea,

Right after Germany I'll raze your cities, 

Now I'm nearly finished, so finish your Guinness,

or whatever piss it is they drink in Limerick

And thank St Patrick, tomorrow's has-been

for all the land I'll take for God and the Queen. 

---

Oh what country is this, England, barely a rival to great Éire, 

Are you taking the piss? The Atlantic, not enough to stop our fire, 

This marks the end of your empire, Which already leaves nothing of desire, 

So what happened to your sun, Seems to have set, 

Your own title, You'll need more than your queen, To have it met. 

I hear you crying, don't worry pet, 

Your nation will be finished quickly, For the love of God don't get upset

---

Clearly my last verse has got you frantic,

Think Eire's the empire of the Atlantic?,

You're not fire, shit's a pyre, time to panic,

You're going down faster than the Titanic, 

Time for England, once more into the breach,

I'll slaughter in Waterford with my Triremes,

So many soldiers I could whip you easily,

You've just got a scout stuck in Mississippi,

You're even more fucked than your economy,

Verses like your potatoes, they so diseased, 

But don't worry, soon you'll all be deceased,

cause you fuccbois more than a catholic priest,

Come on then, fuck with the English horde,

We could do with practising on little Leprechauns,

I got so many weapons ready in my forge,

To bitch slap you, for Harry, England and St George.

---

Grand, now I have to survive another round of your patriotic blabberin',

You're talk of submarines and your gunning machines have nothing to leave me sobbin',

What your queen and country is fit for is nothing more than a clobberin',

No wonder you're already at war, you seem to have not taken the hint,

The second one of your gunmen gets into a fight, poor fella will go off into a sprint,

Go on, mate, have your fucking tea and cake while you can,

Your soldiers can barely get a shot on a stray man, let alone an entire clan,

I'm sure our whole country would rather starve, than bother meeting a hun,

The one time they did, your petty ""warriors"" were drastically outdone,

Good luck with defending your puny colony of Hastings, and your untimely death by Nazi,

I can't be bothered with even tastings of your shithole called London, your ""city"" deserves little paparazzi,

Bet you're glad our war hasn't started yet, since your homes will become the result of a Japanese kamikaze,

You're finished before you even started, yet I know one thing-full hearted, you rotting twig,

Wellington didn't belong in a stable of strong horses, he's a fucking pig,

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NORWAY VS SWEDEN

Okay y’all… We’re here in Northern Europe for MKII 

And I know the fans are hating on me and on you 

Now why the distain? It ain’t no mystery 

Here in Civilization, fans love their history 

Yo, school’s in session (school bell)

Class, today’s subject is TPang’s Battle Royale, MK I (sit up straight Mr. /u/Kropenfuer) 

Back then everyone was pissed about Mess-opotamia 

Norway was sitting pretty, alone in Scandenavia 

Shoulda' been a cinch! You had the whole peninsula 

But you barely made war and you kept so insula’ 

So when Stalin burned Oslo you EARNED the name Snoreway 

And now we’ve all been forced into a Nordic 4-way 

I mean it figures, you’re just some two-bit mod 

I’m a prime Firaxis, a diplomatic god 

I’ve got a shit UA and shit UU 

And I still took Eidsvoll away from you

---

This is Norway! The axe-wielding lion of the North

Come to foray, on rap battlefield to sally forth

Now that Round One is here, we see through Swedish veneer

And your tears make it clear that we are your worst fear

What’s that in your ears? Sounds like an army of cheers

For we’ve lined your frontiers with a carpet of spears!

Your homeland lays empty; not even a boat

Like your underwrote Vasa, your hype just won’t float

D’you see the ranked vote? Gus, you’ve been demote!

Ain’t much of a gloat to peg your chances: remote!

The one question left now is who’ll make the most gains

See, Hitler and Poland and Finland have laid claims

But this is our moment to claim your domains, for

Our banner maintains: Your losses? Our gains!

Once we take Stockholm, we’ll party; a gala —

And ‘till then, Norwegians will fight to Valhalla!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GERMANY VS ROME

Oh my you've made a mess of things, 

I'll listen to you rhymes as they ping, 

off my legions Segmentata, 

whilst we conquer you lands we call Germania, 

my empire inspired you Russia and The Ottomans, 

and the French but we don't want your amends, 

the Republic owned the Mediterranean, 

whilst you couldn't even hit Britain, 

Italy created your policy of Fascism, 

but your people clearly study absurdism, 

you might think your Panzers will scare me, 

but I rap faster than a bullet to the knee, 

your role model for nationalism is Arminius, 

shall I introduce you to my Grand Nephew Germanicus, 

you can bring Beethoven and Mozart, 

but in a fight they'd be as useless as a fart, 

as I am Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus, 

whilst your own gun brought you to justice, 

now I am a known as man of means,

 so I'll crucify you and your Nazis across the Alpennes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

POLAND VS FINLAND

Hey Poland, what's up homie 

You should hear the shit that Stalin 

told me Told me bout your stuggles in settling cities 

and that you can't forward settle Germany 

Ya gonna get eliminated that's for sure 

Got four better civs, knocking at your door 

The only balls ya got are comics 

gonna disappear like the supersonics 

we dealing with the nazis and Huns but they can bite us 

while you're getting fucked by Leonidas 

Falling through the rankings part after part 

Folks jumping on the bandwagon now they falling off the cart 

We be screaming Hakkaa päälle

Best that you get out of our way

Run back to Hitler no time to delay

Polish eagle ain't no bird of prey

Casimir is too busy being STRONK to reply.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SPARTA VS BYZANTIUM

My schedule's pretty tight right now, but I'll try to pen you in 

Got dinner plans laid out for me in Rome, Warsaw and Berlin. 

But when I have some time to kill I'll crush you like your kin 

Cuz everyone knows King Leo is the only Royal you're gonna win! 

I'll pwn you purple poser, when at war I'm a composer 

Molon labe with your mother while I loot Constantinople 

Verses purer than an opal with more vision than a Jew 

Just ask the mighty legions of rappers than I've slew 

You are weak, both mind and body, Rap or spear I'll run you through, 

What more can I say? Even the Champa have pointier sticks than you.

---

Nice rhymes, Leo, now to put you in the trash, 

aint nothing that can compete with Alexios’ raps. 

You’re not special, you’re a glorified barbarian, 

and you can’t beat me, 

this empire stretches from Cyprus to the CCCP! 

You’ve been in more wars than anyone else, 

yet you got no cities to display on your shelf! 

You fought against Rome, and that was just fine,

 EXCEPT A POLISH SCOUT STOPPED YOUR ‘HELL DINE’! 

Now listen up Leo, and listen up good, 

your city Sparta? Ha, what a joke. 

Everything you did? I’m the motherfucker that perfected it. 

Come to war with me and my people be cheering, 

I’ll be pumping out spearmen, Byzantium be leering, 

victory is nearing. 

Now if you’re gonna come to war with me, look out for a hunchback snitch, 

unless you wanna die. DEUS VULT, bitch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

USSR VS AYYUBIDS

STRAIGHT OUTTA MOSCOW CRAZY COMMIE NAMED U/NOT_ENOUGH_CHARACTE 

FROM A GANG CALLED THE BOLSHEVIK PARTY 

EGYPT IS ON THE HIT LIST LIST FOR LENIN'S TEAM 

CALL THAT SHIT A PYRAMID SCHEME 

ALREADY ON YOUR BORDER, IGNORING ANY PLEA 

WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S CALLED THE RED SEA? 

SHOOTING UP SULTANS IN MARX'S NAME 

HE'S GOT THE MOST GANGSTA CLIQUE IN THIS GAME 

ONE OF US IS A SLAVE, THE OTHER A SLAV 

NOW HAVE A TASTE OF MY MOLOTOV 

SOON OVER SINAI WE'LL WAVE THE RED FLAG 

WELCOME TO YOUR NEW HOME IN THE GULAG!

---

Do you know what you’re getting yourself into? 

We’re not just some nation coming out of the blue. 

We’re the proud, strong Ayyubid nation, 

While the man who died of a nosebleed is giving you some forceful liberation. 

We own a mountain important to everyone from the Jews to the people that are Coptic, 

While your nation struggles to develop an arrow or an optic. 

Our cities are known worldwide as the cities for trade and growth, 

While if you said the same you’d be lying under oath. 

We’re the pinnacle of the lands of North Africa, 

While your ranking is worse than every single civ of North and South America. 

You’ve probably had quite a bit more than one too many booze, 

And tales of your incompetence and crudeness are told from Sydney to Santa Cruz. 

It’s getting quite obvious who the real winner is here, 

And it’s not the one here ranked on the bottom tier.

---

It seems that your lines are simply incorrect,

Since your citizens are shown such neglect.

You let your people fall to the hordes of the east,

Letting them be prepared for a Hunnic feast.

You think we’re going to one of your prison camps,

Then clearly your nation is run by a group of scamps.

We’re in the top third of the nations unlike your “motherland”,

Which managed to be ranked worse than Ireland.

You have no military, no science, no money-

And at this point your situation’s just funny.

We’ll burn your “new” Leningrad to the ground,

And this time you won’t rebound.

The people who are the slaves are the ones in the Soviet Union,

And the Huns would like a little reunion.

CARTHAGE VS ETHIOPIA 

Look at the elephant, trying to face off against the lion 

You’re historically and battle royally as big a threat as the Hawaiians 

In our corner we got god incarnate Haile Selassie! 

Shooting up shit with his archer carpets and Mehal Sefari 

As fast as Tpang builds hype and throws shrimps on his barbie 

He’s one bad ass emperor, the fucking Lion of Judah! 

Everybody knows him, from Sydney to Berlin and even Tortuga 

What’s your leader famous for? Cuz I’m not quite sure 

That riding some elephants over some hills and then not taking Rome 

And exiling himself from home Is quite cause for celebration

 Trying to encourage participation? You’re pathetic, 

we’ll be kind and quickly storm your capital 

You’re gonna lose even more cities than fucking Br1 Hannibal! 

---

The year is 20 sixty 5, down the valley old Hannibal flies 

We staunched the ashanti of ejura, 

a curse we were in the Drumroll war. Hannibal is literally the ice cube of Africa 

Beating women in conquered cities creating a massacre 

He may be intellectually bankrupt but he makes it up with the sword 

Ambitious and dreamy He’ll send the ashanti skyward 

He’ll turkey slap Ethiopia with his morning wood 

And they’ll take it like how blacks take police brutality in he hood 

We may be the Turtle of Africa’s west 

But we get harbours in every city fuck yeah we’re the best 

I forget how generic haile Selassie really is
 
He’s an autist, his only lover is his wrist 

His parents probably think he’s a waste of jizz 

And I end it here, carthage is open for business!

---

You talk big for someone that couldn’t handle an imperial power 

Carthage ain’t on no maps, nothing but salt, not even a flower 

Should have seen us at Adwa, if you wanted to know how to fight an Italian 

Ethiopia’s as independent as a feminist Battalion 

What’s wrong, need your elephant give you a kiss? 

Are you still sad about what happened at Hippo Regius? 

Look at you getting your ass whooped by fools worshiping a Golden Stool 

Do we need to get over there and take you back to civ School? 

Because you’re nothing but glorified elephant drivers Ethiopians are survivors, 

thrivers, modernizers and decolonizers 

So spread the word, lock up, lights out, tell your elephants goodnight 

Because the Lion of Judah is about to take his first bite!

---

PERSIA VS MUGHALS

Good Job, you guys took a city, But only in part 4. 

Truthfully told, you Mughals just really make me snore. 

You're rated high in the rankings, but the Persians don't really care.

To you we say salaam kqarsalu,In english, ""hello, fat bear."" 

Theres only one powerful civ here, Its most definitely us, son, 

'cause before you can upgrade your spearmen to pikes, we'll be out there shooting our guns.

---

PERSIA? WHAT A JOKE! ONE OF THE WEAKEST PLAYERS! 

CAN'T EVEN GET THEIR ARMY TO THE HIMA-FUCKIN'-LAYAS! 

ACHAEMENID EMPIRE? BULLSHIT YOU WAAAAAY UNDER PAR! 

YOU'RE EVEN TURTLING HARDER THAN MYAN-FUCKING-MAR! 

ITS A WELL KNOWN FACT WE GOT A GAME WINNING STRATEGY, 

WHY CAN'T YOU JUST ACCEPT YOUR EMPIRES A COMPLETE UTTER TRAGEDY? 

YOU'LL BE MAIMED, ENSLAVED, ET-CET-ER-RA! 

BET CHU KNOW WHATS COMING NEXT! - DEATH TO PERSIA!

---


Hey Nice Rap bro, did ya have to yell so loud?

In case you haven't noticed, you're in the middle of a crowd.

I think you'll peak early then fall flat on your face

leaving plenty of room for the persian master race.

Just cuz were under par doesn't mean we have no potential

if you look under the surface, our power is torrential!

We bide our time, just turtling in the shadows, 

you have less a chance to win as finding El Dorado.

We'll make an impact in the world,

you'll definitely feel our presence,

darius raised an empire,

while you were brought down to peasants.

We were brought here for a purpose,

no question we'll deliver,

Cuz our flows so cold,

EVEN THE INUIT SHIVER.

---

From Afghanistan to Hindustan, to PK in between,

We're a cultural powerhouse that'll end your Persian dream.

You're up against a real superpower, it's really quite sad,

We'll stream-roll you worse than the Mongols sacking Baghdad! (backing voice then quickly shouts in the background ""U MAAAAD?""

Your golden age will run flat, as soon as our armies attack,

Prepare to watch Persepolis go from golden to ash black.

Better learn how to read a dictionary, go look up assimilation,

It's only a matter of time before your lands are part of our nation

Even your women deserted you, they really loved our dope saris,

They even became our queens...d'ya even remember Mumtaz and Kandahari?

Oh wait I forgot...Y'all were all hiding in a satraps court! ,

While Akbar be banging all your Persian bitches down in his red fort!

Once we've stormed your palace, you'll surrender and plea,

Best pray that we don't sanction you even worse than Khomeini

(insert OOOOoooooooo! Here)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

YAKUTIA VS JAPAN

Alright, cut me some slack because I don't do this ever, 

But, Japan, you're in the midst of a depressing endeavor. 

If, maybe, you stayed loyal to Oda Nobunaga, 

You wouldn't be so boring in Part 4 of your saga. 

You're trying to compete for the most pointiest sticks, 

But you only seem to have the most littlest dicks. 

You're tactics are whack, and you're proving to be useless, 

Quit turtling, you coward, and do something ruthless. 

You ""shot up the Power Rankings like a Tianjin blast,"" 

Well, I'm sorry, but that's just Part 2 in the past, 

And it's a shame, because I like that your start bias is coast, 

But your performance, so far, has been nothing to boast. 

Do us all a favor, and send some units to Seoul, 

So we can all stop thinking you're a worthless asshole. 

But if I ever see you make your way up to the tundra, 

Just know that you're not gonna have any fundra.

---

Albinoredguard, why are you making this easy?

You didn't submit a verse. Are you trying to tease me?

For that, you should be given an automatic DQ,

But, first, I have some things I'd to like to say to you.

Your flair? Just dump it. You obviously don't want it.

You're lazier than a pothead who just took his eighth blunt hit.

You acted like a clown, except you made your whole team frown,

And, when they see you around, you're gonna get a beat down.

""But I'm sorry! Forgive me! I have an excuse!""

Were you busy letting someone pound your butt hole loose?

I heard Yakutia's Funhau5 is hung like a moose,

Which is why you're gonna struggle passing your next deuce.

I have nothing bad to say about your Emperor Meiji,

He did nothing to induce this atomic, verbal wedgie.

So here are 16 lines that only you deserve.

Remember this as the day your fucking whack ass got served.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MONGOLIA VS TIBET

Spiritual- my soul is free like Tibet 

Dalai Lama reaps my advice and respect 

Unlike Genghis Khan ""villainy n death"" 

This pale blue spot not just a skin defect 

You're horde's nothing but a band of whores 

I got plenty of Condoms- this means war 

I can't be stopped, I'm the reincarnate 

Your swords strict but you betta get ya bars straight 

I'm all about the peace, in the far east 

I'll blow you away like a Himalayan breeze 

Maximize all my religious beliefs 

You're eyes burn from the holiness that is ME 

This advice to you should not go unstored 

Too many wars n whores can make a mind bored 

Another turn You must grow- shed the sword 

Or your nation will drop just like ya jaw

(you can listen to a recorded version here!)

---

I'm the great khan of the mongol hordes 

I crush foreign lords, clash swords, we go to war 

I want more, a roar of a battle cry 

temujin flies up in the sky 

with air strikes no matter the era, the fuck did you hear? 

that genghis keshiks fuck you from the rear? 

I roll through with catapults, landships to nukes 

but my nomad blood keeps me close to my roots 

like I won't let city states stand like my clan 

eliminates bitches from kiev to yuan 

my battle plan revolves around your destruction 

my civ's influx of cities grant no fucks son 

I'm a grandmaster of war, no denial 

your basic monks stand no chance of survival 

and when I die boy, your city burns 

I stand by and fortify my troops, 10HP per turn

(You can listen to a recorded version here!)

---
You're mind's too caught up on war and fights man

Like a 4 year old who just learnt of violence

Grow the FUCK up, put down your Vicodin

It's time for bed, don't you still need a night light Gen?

A right end, KARMA will cut your life short

I see you shat your pants- Yakutsk's got ya hurt

I can see your future- insert burnt yurts

You'll live in poverty a palace of dirt

Genghis Khan a once great warrior lord

Genghis Khan a cunt to be quartered and drawn

I vent this par as I must stop your spawn

So shut the fuck up like I shut down this song

Yeah you could call me a pacifist

No need to pass a fist, I got my words for this

I'd rape your spirit once your life's been pissed

But you'd enjoy it too much you masochist

----

Jaw dropping? lets be honest that's the least of your problems

your weak prohpets are nothing, I leave no sign of stopping

just try and step up to the steppe, meet keshik arrows

you call yourself holy, well you're hole-y now bro

villainy and death? you're goddamn right

it's my goddamn right, to end your goddamn life

you bring your condoms along, but you're not my type

burn you like ancient tinder, imma leftward swipe

you get bored of war? I guess you don't have the stomach

you cower away in your temples, afraid to leave the summit

while your population plummets since i can never resist

to raid your little nation, complacent and sumbmissive

So you lay your bars down and you think that you're smart

but imma bring this rap ""battle"" right back to the start

who give's a damn about the fuckin dalai lamas respect?

because even in the future you're just china's pet

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHINA VS VIETNAM

TIME TO STRIDE BACK INTO SOUTHEAST ASIA 

LOOKIN' A LITTLE ROUGH I'LL CURE WHAT AILS YA

ARRIVE IN THIS SHIT LIKE I DROP NAPALM BOMBS 

BEEN A ROUGH THOUSAND YEARS FOR THE KINGDOM OF NAM 

BETTER OFF AS MY COLONY WASN'T THAT COOL? 

TURN MY BACK FOR TWO SECONDS AND YOU UNDER FRENCH RULE!

YOU FLOW SLOW, SPIT SOFT YOUR RHYMES JUST AIN'T STRONG 

YOU SURE AIN'T A KING MORE LIKE A DONKEY CONG!

---

YOU STAND THERE HAUGHTY

ACTING LIKE YOU WAS JAPAN

WHILE YOUR ENTIRE CULTURE

WAS SHAPED BY MY HANS


I THINK I SHOULD CALL IT

YOU'RE LOOKIN' KIND OF BEAT

JUST GOT ONE MORE BURN IN ME

THEN MY VICTORY'S COMPLETE

IT'S THE GREATEST CHALLENGE

FOR THIS SICK-SPITTIN' RHYMESMITH

TURNS OUT THERE AIN'T NOTHING

THAT AGENT ORANGE RHYMES WITH!


IF YOU WANNA BATTLE US YOU'LL FIND

MAO JUST TOO LEGIT

YOU CHOSE THE WRONG SIDE

OF THE SINO-SOVIET SPLIT

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BURMA VS PHILIPINES

Oh look, it's Burma, wanting to fight us on demand 

To be honest, the world thinks of you as West Thailand 

You had a useless war against Champa, that's a shame 

But then again, you Indochinese all look the same 

The 'Pagan Empire' founded Buddhism? Bunch of whacks 

We'd rather follow the other with hookers and yaks 

You say of the wrath of Anawrahta: ""It's cool, it rocks"" 

We guess you're compensating for your little peacocks 

Face it, Burma, you don't stand a chance against us now 

Might as well run to your real capital Naypyitaw 

The Philippines will bring the End of Your Strife (straight to Rangoon!) 

Kaba Ma Kyei? Too bad, it starts with your life (with our typhoon!) 

We'll await your return and feeble comeback, Burma 

We hope you brought cold water, because we just burned ya!

---

While Rizal was pooping propaganda about freedom and oppression 

Anawratha reformed religion, marking out a brand new nation 

Infrastructure built with patience, intensive agricult'ral changes! 

So see if you can cross our triple mountain ranges! 

We've both built canals, but yours is in your capital 

One measly hypertyphoon and you're outta this battle 

Your start was so bad Tpang had to give you buffs 

The result of Rizal's resolve was simply not enough 

Got colonised twice and lost your surname identities 

Can't keep your islands from your Chinese enemies 

What's wrong with you?! Ya like the most eastern Western country!

Why don't you come visit Burma to see an Asian society? 

We have generals who conquered all of Indochina! 

You're on an stupid puny island so I'm gonna remind ya 

You need to conquer people to win the Battle Royale 

There's no way you're ever gonna win with that morale

---

So I heard your rap, it's entirely a hit-and-miss!

You fail to see what we've mastered in your previous diss!

Spitting shite, agriculture? I'll show you Banaue!

UNESCO Site, making Incans run for their money!

Magellan dared to come with guns and ships at his command;

We impaled that motherfucker for coming to our land!

You've seen the BR update? Your military's trapped tight!

Your empire's ready to taste, Tibet wants a fucking bite!

Let's be real, Afghanistan's the one that'll hit you hard;

Now we all know who is the first empire in the graveyard!

You couldn't hurt the Champa, war's never your thing anyway;

And what you couldn't defend is your settler in Mandalay!

Myanmar, can't handle me-an'-more of these bars, it's a pathetic and pitiful way to lose!

In BR, even when you got into two wars, your UA and UU won't ever be used!

With your dropping and turtling, where now is your leader general?

Gotta go fast, you poor thing, before I crush you like emerald!

---

Ha! You better switch your style cuz we're a cultural-phile

Burma getting Great Writers when I conquer!

Now I dunno if you know, but my raps so dope

I technically am Burma's Great Writer!

How much more Western can an eastern country get?

I mean your name's Daniel and you got a wierd accent. 

While the Philippines did nothing, we warred against the Champa

I mean your nation's looking weak like a 130-year old Grampa.

No one can spell the name of your country. (Kantot!)

So come give Burma investment money! (We're hot!)

And I kid you not that I'll spend it all like a stereotypical Burmese!

Seriously, dude, you need some emotion

Don't you know the hype train's in motion?

this Burma's burning with counter-isolation!

You can't just put on some burnblocking lotion

Before we start, I would just like to point out that I've been travelling quite a lot, and also the internet went down for me, so I havn't been able to reply to many comments. Unfortunately, I'm going to be spending 2 days going back to London tomorrow and the day after, so sorry bout that.

After this, each rapper must respond to their enemies verses with a second verse, which will be due in on **Sunday, 11am brit time**, swearing and insults are allowed but no rascism or clear hatred. PM me the raps once they're done. A few people didn't message me their raps, and most have explained to me why they havn't. When we get both verses the Judges will commence deciding who progresses and who will be doomed to cry to themselves for the rest of their lives. Thanks to everyone for the support!

Onwards to the show! oh wait, it seems the babylonians want to rap, even though they have a bye.

BABYLONS ""DONT FUCK WITH ME"" RAP:

Even though I got a week one bye, 
 Thought I might spit verse for fun.  Let all the others know not to try,      Rap against Nebby, you're done.  Lyrics be nuclear like our subs,  Under ice we see you fight.  While you still fighting with spears and clubs,  Be too simple for rhymes I write.  Watch me win Babylon this battle,  I'll be king, call me Royale.  While you all sit and prattle,  I'll be chillin' at Nassau Canal.

CHILE VS INCA:
Your name is gagging4gags, so here's a joke:
Who's only got 6 cities, and a pop that's broke?
Unlike your username suggests, here's to hoping you don't choke--
Until the Chilean Renaissance when you're still livin' in Baroque!
No need to serve you, Pachacuti,
You're self-servin' like Tutti Frutti
Snipe your terrace farms for booty
O'Higgins, no scope, Call of Duty
Valparaiso should've been ominous,
Prepare for the red white and blue apocalypse
Fuck off Remus, this is Romulus
With failure you've become synonymous
First in military on the continent,
Wreaking havoc on your confidence
Combined with Eva and Brazil's incompetence
The only way we play is dominance.

Hey Chile nice start there - very mountainous, I guess it's easy to defend but where's your growth? Well we've got terrace farms but an annoying blot of blue, So when we've finished feasting we'll grow off you. Our expansions lookin' better no Colombia in game, But your position with Argentina is looking quite the same. Only this time they're lookin' angry and more strong, I think they'll take your cities, doubt you'll prove me wrong. Oh look what's that? Do I see Part 5? Looks like we're gonna eat Brazil alive. Generating more spots for our UI, By the time we get to you you'll quickly die.

MAYANS VS BUCCANEERS

You think you got the high seas?
I’ll put on your fuckin’ knees
You think you’ve got the land lead?
I only see a desperate need
To spread your seed
Make you into a gentile
And then I’ll defile
Your precious canal
We’ll see who’s banal
Build your terracotta army
But it ain’t gonna help
Cuz Pacal is getting smarmy
You motha-buccin’ whelp
When things are getting heady
Got atlatls ready
We gunnin’ for ya Henry

Coming straight from the Port of my plundering spree We are the 12 sail terror of the Caribbean Sea We do what we want because a pirate is free The world's gonna fall to the b u double C
We gonna make the world crunk with our rum and distilleries Gonna make the world burn with our ships and artillery Gonna make it rain gold with our treasurer so glittery Gonna make our opposition walk the plank-- literally
Well rattle your atalatals with our cannons &amp; paddles Cut you up like cattle win the battle
And take a victory ride through our canal at Panama It's your apocalypse now, start retirement planning brah.

TEXAS VS MEXICO:

Hey, is that the sound of armies running away?
Well it must be the Mexicans getting bored today!
Let me tell y’all what will happen when you take a rash action
against the Lone-star faction,
you get a reaction that y’all just didn’t expect!
We crushed your friends in the east, but they tried at least
but you cannot compete against Sam Houston’s Elite!
You’re next, so before you get wrecked,
y’all better show Texas some respect!
We’ve got Baltimore, Lincoln has lost your war,
but don’t be so quick to rush out the door
so I can make sure y’all get the arrows that y’all paid for!
So have your fun while I finish my steak brisket,
But if y’all want Austin, come and take it!

BLACKFOOT VS FRANCE

I thought I was gonna rap against the sioux But no, out of all people i ended up with YOU
Napoleon, famous for being a gnome Too bad you can’t beat anyone else than Rome
Yeah, run away with your wine and your baguettes Or else I WILL make sure you’ll have regrets
You want an empire? You’ll have to change yo’ plans Soon you’ll see black feet all over yo’ lands
Just waiting for the world congress to convene We’ll make you relive the 18th of June 1815
You know your new city, Neapolis? Ain’t gonna be long before it’s a fuckin’ necropolis
I’ll do to you what the germans did to Lorraine and Alsace Next part, to see your empire, you’ll need a magnifying glass!

Napoleon is too scared to respond.

INUIT VS ICELAND

I am Ingolfur Arnarson, leader of the Icelandic vikings
And I’m afraid that my appearance here bodes you some ill tidings
You’d better run and hide in an igloo, pathetic Ekheunik,
‘Cause I might be drinking from your skull at my next Icelandic picnic!
You can’t beat an Icelander at a glorious rap battle
Our UA’s geared towards Great Writing, so spare me all your prattle
Let’s face it, your civ’s basically just the Sioux’s little brother
Compare a rag-tag bunch of seal hunters to me? I’m a Viking warrior!
When you try to cross from the mainland, you’ll meet my longboat fleet
If you forward-settling bastards settle Greenland, you’ll be facing defeat
I believe it’s time for you seal-hunters to cede the lands of snow to us
Or we’ll take them by force and you’ll run away in fear, wuss
The only reason I can conceive that I won’t win this fray
Is if the Sioux get to you first and whip you anyway

Waddup, Iceland, ya gonna get beat cause you be fucking with the true kings of the ice sheet.
This battles gonna end in our reykjavik-tory.
Your thingstead? Yo your things dead, our rhymes are straight fire we skalding you,
So we think it's time that you inuksuk our dicks
If crouchin' in on my borders is what I feel
Ima club u bitch, just like a fuckin' seal.
You think you come from the land of Ice and Snow?
All you know is how to blow!
Descendants of a Viking King
Destined to become My Bottom Bitch Queen
You came to my land once, tryin' to expand
I bitch slapped you, knocked you down, with my righthand
Selfish, you threw a fit, chickened out, it was neat
It's nice and warm there with those volcanoes for heat
But I will kindle my fires with your peoples feet
Your name is Bullshit, A lie, Deceit
Ingólfr Arnarson ([ˈiŋkoulvʏr̥ ˈartnar̥sɔn])[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_Icelandic]
You'll be kissing OurOwnAsses-son

IRELAND VS ENGLAND

Battle against Ireland? Shit, only one way to go/ make a few- well, loads- of jokes about potatoes/ You'll be in trouble when my guns are in Dublin/ wipe off that smug grin, my subs'll have you unsubbing./ Your rhymes are weak, the famine's hit your brain,/ you're not Battle Royale, you're the Hunger Games./ Your army's tame, mine is high and mighty,/ making you flighty, straight outta Blighty,/ you gonna strike me? I'm asking politely/ before I come from York to Cork, fighting/ knick knack paddy whack, sipping my tea,/ Right after Germany I'll raze your cities,/ Now I'm nearly finished, so finish your Guinness,/ or whatever piss it is they drink in Limerick/ And thank St Patrick, tomorrow's has-been/ for all the land I'll take for God and the Queen. 

Oh what country is this,
England, barely a rival to great Éire,
Are you taking the piss?
The Atlantic, not enough to stop our fire,
This marks the end of your empire,
Which already leaves nothing of desire,
So what happened to your sun,
Seems to have set,
Your own title,
You'll need more than your queen,
To have it met.
I hear you crying, don't worry pet,
Your nation will be finished quickly,
For the love of God don't get upset

NORWAY VS SWEDEN

Okay y’all… We’re here in Northern Europe for MKII
And I know the fans are hating on me and on you
Now why the distain? It ain’t no mystery
Here in Civilization, fans love their history
Yo, school’s in session (school bell)
Class, today’s subject is TPang’s Battle Royale, MK I (sit up straight Mr. /u/Kropenfuer)
Back then everyone was pissed about Mess-opotamia
Norway was sitting pretty, alone in Scandenavia
Shoulda' been a cinch! You had the whole peninsula
But you barely made war and you kept so insula’
So when Stalin burned Oslo you EARNED the name Snoreway
And now we’ve all been forced into a Nordic 4-way
I mean it figures, you’re just some two-bit mod
I’m a prime Firaxis, a diplomatic god
I’ve got a shit UA and shit UU
And I still took Eidsvoll away from you

This is Norway! The axe-wielding lion of the North

Come to foray, on rap battlefield to sally forth


Now that Round One is here, we see through Swedish veneer

And your tears make it clear that we are your worst fear

What’s that in your ears? Sounds like an army of cheers

For we’ve lined your frontiers with a carpet of spears!


Your homeland lays empty; not even a boat

Like your underwrote Vasa, your hype just won’t float

D’you see the ranked vote? Gus, you’ve been demote!

Ain’t much of a gloat to peg your chances: remote!



The one question left now is who’ll make the most gains

See, Hitler and Poland and Finland have laid claims

But this is our moment to claim your domains, for

Our banner maintains: Your losses? Our gains!



Once we take Stockholm, we’ll party; a gala —

And ‘till then, Norwegians will fight to Valhalla!

GERMANY VS ROME

Oh my you've made a mess of things, I'll listen to you rhymes as they ping, off my legions Segmentata, whilst we conquer you lands we call Germania, my empire inspired you Russia and The Ottomans, and the French but we don't want your amends, the Republic owned the Mediterranean, whilst you couldn't even hit Britain, Italy created your policy of Fascism, but your people clearly study absurdism, you might think your Panzers will scare me, but I rap faster than a bullet to the knee, your role model for nationalism is Arminius, shall I introduce you to my Grand Nephew Germanicus, you can bring Beethoven and Mozart, but in a fight they'd be as useless as a fart, as I am Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus, whilst your own gun brought you to justice, now I am a known as man of means, so I'll crucify you and your Nazis across the Alpennes.

Hitler is too busy ranting about civ 5 to respond.

POLAND VS FINLAND

Hey Poland, what's up homie You should hear the shit that Stalin told me Told me bout your stuggles in settling cities and that you can't forward settle Germany Ya gonna get eliminated that's for sure Got four better civs, knocking at your door The only balls ya got are comics gonna disappear like the supersonics we dealing with the nazis and Huns but they can bite us while you're getting fucked by Leonidas Falling through the rankings part after part Folks jumping on the bandwagon now they falling off the cart We be screaming Hakkaa päälle Best that you get out of our way Run back to Hitler no time to delay Polish eagle ain't no bird of prey

Casimir is too busy being STRONK to reply.

SPARTA VS BYZANTIUM

My schedule's pretty tight right now, but I'll try to pen you in
Got dinner plans laid out for me in Rome, Warsaw and Berlin.
But when I have some time to kill I'll crush you like your kin
Cuz everyone knows King Leo is the only Royal you're gonna win!
I'll pwn you purple poser, when at war I'm a composer
Molon labe with your mother while I loot Constantinople
Verses purer than an opal with more vision than a Jew
Just ask the mighty legions of rappers than I've slew
You are weak, both mind and body,
Rap or spear I'll run you through,
What more can I say? Even the Champa have pointier sticks than you.

Nice rhymes, Leo, now to put you in the trash, aint nothing that can compete with Alexios’ raps. You’re not special, you’re a glorified barbarian, and you can’t beat me, this empire stretches from Cyprus to the CCCP! You’ve been in more wars than anyone else, yet you got no cities to display on your shelf! You fought against Rome, and that was just fine, EXCEPT A POLISH SCOUT STOPPED YOUR ‘HELL DINE’! Now listen up Leo, and listen up good, your city Sparta? Ha, what a joke. Everything you did? I’m the motherfucker that perfected it. Come to war with me and my people be cheering, I’ll be pumping out spearmen, Byzantium be leering, victory is nearing. Now if you’re gonna come to war with me, look out for a hunchback snitch, unless you wanna die. DEUS VULT, bitch.

USSR VS AYYUBIDS

STRAIGHT OUTTA MOSCOW
CRAZY COMMIE NAMED U/NOT_ENOUGH_CHARACTE
FROM A GANG CALLED THE BOLSHEVIK PARTY
EGYPT IS ON THE HIT LIST LIST FOR LENIN'S TEAM
CALL THAT SHIT A PYRAMID SCHEME
ALREADY ON YOUR BORDER, IGNORING ANY PLEA
WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S CALLED THE RED SEA?
SHOOTING UP SULTANS IN MARX'S NAME
HE'S GOT THE MOST GANGSTA CLIQUE IN THIS GAME
ONE OF US IS A SLAVE, THE OTHER A SLAV
NOW HAVE A TASTE OF MY MOLOTOV
SOON OVER SINAI WE'LL WAVE THE RED FLAG
WELCOME TO YOUR NEW HOME IN THE GULAG!

Do you know what you’re getting yourself into?
We’re not just some nation coming out of the blue.
We’re the proud, strong Ayyubid nation,
While the man who died of a nosebleed is giving you some forceful liberation.
We own a mountain important to everyone from the Jews to the people that are Coptic,
While your nation struggles to develop an arrow or an optic.
Our cities are known worldwide as the cities for trade and growth,
While if you said the same you’d be lying under oath.
We’re the pinnacle of the lands of North Africa,
While your ranking is worse than every single civilization of North and South America.
You’ve probably had quite a bit more than one too many booze,
And tales of your incompetence and crudeness are told from Sydney to Santa Cruz.
It’s getting quite obvious who the real winner is here,
And it’s not the one here ranked on the bottom tier.

CARTHAGE VS ETHIOPIA
Look at the elephant, trying to face off against the lion You’re historically and battle royally as big a threat as the Hawaiians In our corner we got god incarnate Haile Selassie! Shooting up shit with his archer carpets and Mehal Sefari As fast as Tpang builds hype and throws shrimps on his barbie He’s one bad ass emperor, the fucking Lion of Judah! Everybody knows him, from Sydney to Berlin and even Tortuga What’s your leader famous for? Cuz I’m not quite sure That riding some elephants over some hills and then not taking Rome And exiling himself from home Is quite cause for celebration Trying to encourage participation? You’re pathetic, we’ll be kind and quickly storm your capital You’re gonna lose even more cities than fucking Br1 Hannibal! Verse 2 You talk big for someone that couldn’t handle an imperial power Carthage ain’t on no maps, nothing but salt, not even a flower Should have seen us at Adwa, if you wanted to know how to fight an Italian Ethiopia’s as independent as a feminist Battalion What’s wrong, need your elephant give you a kiss? Are you still sad about what happened at Hippo Regius? Look at you getting your ass whooped by fools worshiping a Golden Stool Do we need to get over there and take you back to civ School? Because you’re nothing but glorified elephant drivers Ethiopians are survivors, thrivers, modernizers and decolonizers So spread the word, lock up, lights out, tell your elephants goodnight Because the Lion of Judah is about to take his first bite!

The year is 20 sixty 5, down the valley old Hannibal flies We staunched the ashanti of ejura, a curse we were in the Drumroll war. Hannibal is literally the ice cube of Africa Beating women in conquered cities creating a massacre He may be intellectually bankrupt but he makes it up with the sword Ambitious and dreamy He’ll send the ashanti skyward He’ll turkey slap Ethiopia with his morning wood And they’ll take it like how blacks take police brutality in he hood We may be the Turtle of Africa’s west But we get harbours in every city fuck yeah we’re the best I forget how generic haile Selassie really is He’s an autist, his only lover is his wrist His parents probably think he’s a waste of jizz And I end it here, carthage is open for business!

PERSIA VS MUGHALS

Good Job, you guys took a city,/ But only in part 4. /Truthfully told, you Mughals /just really make me snore. /You're rated high in the rankings, /but the Persians don't really care. /To you we say salaam kqarsalu,/ In english, ""hello, fat bear."" /Theres only one powerful civ here,/ Its most definitely us, son,/ 'cause before you can upgrade your spearmen to pikes, /we'll be out there shooting our guns.

PERSIA? WHAT A JOKE! ONE OF THE WEAKEST PLAYERS! CAN'T EVEN GET THEIR ARMY TO THE HIMA-FUCKIN'-LAYAS!
ACHAEMENID EMPIRE? BULLSHIT YOU WAAAAAY UNDER PAR! YOU'RE EVEN TURTLING HARDER THAN MYAN-FUCKING-MAR!
ITS A WELL KNOWN FACT WE GOT A GAME WINNING STRATEGY, WHY CAN'T YOU JUST ACCEPT YOUR EMPIRES A COMPLETE UTTER TRAGEDY?
YOU'LL BE MAIMED, ENSLAVED, ET-CET-ER-RA! BET CHU KNOW WHATS COMING NEXT! - DEATH TO PERSIA!

YAKUTIA VS JAPAN

Alright, cut me some slack because I don't do this ever,
But, Japan, you're in the midst of a depressing endeavor.
If, maybe, you stayed loyal to Oda Nobunaga,
You wouldn't be so boring in Part 4 of your saga.
You're trying to compete for the most pointiest sticks,
But you only seem to have the most littlest dicks.
You're tactics are whack, and you're proving to be useless,
Quit turtling, you coward, and do something ruthless.
You ""shot up the Power Rankings like a Tianjin blast,""
Well, I'm sorry, but that's just Part 2 in the past,
And it's a shame, because I like that your start bias is coast,
But your performance, so far, has been nothing to boast.
Do us all a favor, and send some units to Seoul,
So we can all stop thinking you're a worthless asshole.
But if I ever see you make your way up to the tundra,
Just know that you're not gonna have any fundra.

Meji is too busy turtling harder than turtle ships.

MONGOLIA VS TIBET


Spiritual- my soul is free like Tibet
Dalai Lama reaps my advice and respect
Unlike Genghis Khan ""villainy n death""
This pale blue spot not just a skin defect
You're horde's nothing but a band of whores
I got plenty of Condoms- this means war
I can't be stopped, I'm the reincarnate
Your swords strict but you betta get ya bars straight
I'm all about the peace, in the far east
I'll blow you away like a Himalayan breeze
Maximize all my religious beliefs
You're eyes burn from the holiness that is ME
This advice to you should not go unstored
Too many wars n whores can make a mind bored
Another turn You must grow- shed the sword
Or your nation will drop just like ya jaw

(you can listen to a recorded version [here!](https://soundcloud.com/user-969852034/bad-recording-1))

I'm the great khan of the mongol hordes I crush foreign lords, clash swords, we go to war
I want more, a roar of a battle cry temujin flies up in the sky with air strikes
no matter the era, the fuck did you hear? that genghis keshiks fuck you from the rear?
I roll through with catapults, landships to nukes but my nomad blood keeps me close to my roots
like I won't let city states stand like my clan eliminates bitches from kiev to yuan
my battle plan revolves around your destruction my civ's influx of cities grant no fucks son
I'm a grandmaster of war, no denial your basic monks stand no chance of survival
and when I die boy, your city burns I stand by and fortify my troops, 10HP per turn

(You can listen to a recorded version [here!](https://soundcloud.com/mongol-clan/mongolia-vs-tibet-round-1))

CHINA VS VIETNAM

TIME TO STRIDE BACK
INTO SOUTHEAST ASIA
LOOKIN' A LITTLE ROUGH
I'LL CURE WHAT AILS YA

ARRIVE IN THIS SHIT LIKE I DROP NAPALM BOMBS
BEEN A ROUGH THOUSAND YEARS FOR THE KINGDOM OF NAM
BETTER OFF AS MY COLONY WASN'T THAT COOL?
TURN MY BACK FOR TWO SECONDS
AND YOU UNDER FRENCH RULE!

YOU FLOW SLOW, SPIT SOFT
YOUR RHYMES JUST AIN'T STRONG
YOU SURE AIN'T A KING
MORE LIKE A DONKEY CONG!

while china raps, vietnam uses it as an oppotunity to take their cities.

BURMA VS PHILIPINES

Oh look, it's Burma, wanting to fight us on demand
To be honest, the world thinks of you as West Thailand
You had a useless war against Champa, that's a shame
But then again, you Indochinese all look the same
The 'Pagan Empire' founded Buddhism? Bunch of whacks
We'd rather follow the other with hookers and yaks
You say of the wrath of Anawrahta: ""It's cool, it rocks""
We guess you're compensating for your little peacocks
Face it, Burma, you don't stand a chance against us now
Might as well run to your real capital Naypyitaw
The Philippines will bring the End of Your Strife (straight to Rangoon!)
Kaba Ma Kyei? Too bad, it starts with your life (with our typhoon!)
We'll await your return and feeble comeback, Burma
We hope you brought cold water, because we just burned ya!

(You can listen to a recorded version [here!](https://clyp.it/vt1mhs5z))

While Rizal was pooping propaganda about freedom and oppression
Anawratha reformed religion, marking out a brand new nation
Infrastructure built with patience, intensive agricult'ral changes!
So see if you can cross our triple mountain ranges!
We've both built canals, but yours is in your capital
One measly hypertyphoon and you're outta this battle
Your start was so bad Tpang had to give you buffs
The result of Rizal's resolve was simply not enough
Got colonised twice and lost your surname identities
Can't keep your islands from your Chinese enemies
What's wrong with you?! Ya like the most eastern Western country!
Why don't you come visit Burma to see an Asian society?
We have generals who conquered all of Indochina!
You're on an stupid puny island so I'm gonna remind ya
You need to conquer people to win the Battle Royale
There's no way you're ever gonna win with that morale

(you can find a recorded version [here!](https://clyp.it/br0jocad))

KIMBERLEY VS AUSTRALIA

First of all - let me introduce myself
I’m the badass muh-fucker
From south of ya’ll
Jandamarra, he’ll track ya down
Put a spear through your leg
And a hole in your crown
Now Australia – I know you think you’re tough
And compared to some, yah you might be rough
But I was born to this
Bred to this
The outback is where I fucking bled for this
So come now Australia,
It’s time to settle the score
For Terra Nullius don’t apply here any more

The rules for the battles will most likely go like this;

each civ will have **one** person represent them to rap (no, the trung sisters dont get two, SabyZ). The rappers will be chosen on a first come, first served. just say that you want to participate and say the civ you are representing. we will also need judges to, well, judge. I am already going to be one of them, and i need about 4 more. this will again be on a first come, first served. Judges CANNOT be biased or unfair in any way.

The actual rap battles will be held between 2 civs each, and the winner progresses to the next round. Each rapper will have to prepare 2 verses of 12-16 lines each. You can either type it up or record it (if you record it, PM me the link to where I can find it), and all recorded raps will be typed up alongside the recording. rappers will have 1 week to prepare their rap, so this will allow them enough time to write some good bars. anyone how hands their rap in after the deadline (or not at all) will be disqualified and their opponent moves on. If both fail to hand in raps, the winner will be based on past performances.

If their are anymore more rules you think should be added (or removed) please comment below. And now, the battles for the first round will be (you can see the table version at http://challonge.com/CBRRB thanks to /u/Lampwatcher):

I've not got much idea on how it would work yet, but I thought that each civ would choose one or two people supporting that civ to represent them in the rap battles, and then we either:

a) get two rappers of different civs to type up their raps, and the better one moves to the next round

b) get two rappers of different civs to record them rapping their lyrics, and the better one moves on.

c) get two rappers of different civs to rap against each other, which means whatever mistakes happen will not be removed, and the better one wins.

out of the three choices above, i prefer B the most because then we can get a feel for the flow and how the rap works .The rap battles will be in the form of a knock-out competition, so the winners progress and the losers are eliminated.
