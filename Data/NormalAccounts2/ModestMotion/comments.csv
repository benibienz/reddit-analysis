Also Utopia. Utopia was so good but it ended on a  cliff hanger and now I feel morally obliged to hate it forever. ",2016-10-10 22:14:33+00:00,d8mhmm0,1,t3_56r5lh,46796,AskReddit

5,"Okay, the audio devices I'm being shown are NVIDIA Virtual Audio Device, and VIA HD audio - the latter seems to be what my headphone port is using and therefore what's giving me the issues.

My Laptop I believe is a Clevo W230ST Notebook.

I've tried playing around with the audio enhancements but those seem not to do anything, and I can't seem to find a tone tab with which to adjust the bass. I'm wondering if this might be a VIA HD driver issue.
