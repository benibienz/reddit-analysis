I preordered the expansion, so when I got it I got a boost for a character! Sweet, I had a Warlock to play with at some point when I was done with my Hunter.

Well, it didn't get that far - I stopped playing for a while, and then only came back to Destiny quite recently. A little grinding later and my Hunter is comfortable at 334, and Warlock is at 333 just from infusing my hunter's hand-me-down's.

The only problem is my Warlock only has Stormcaller levelled up, and even that isn't finished. I'm trying to level Sunsinger and eventually Voidwalker, but it takes AGES.

Am I doing something wrong? I feel like when I was levelling my hunter turning in the bounties would get me a significant amount of subclass progression, but now I can't see me having finished levelling these subclasses for at the very least a few weeks.

Am I going about this the wrong way? What's the most efficient way to get EXP for subclasses.",DestinyTheGame,Am I doing something wrong?,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/4t2oth/am_i_doing_something_wrong/
