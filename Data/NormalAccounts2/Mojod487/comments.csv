For my fursona, I'm having trouble finding/making my own. I already know what species he is going to be, and I've given a lot of though into it. But even after I do find a reference, I still wouldn't know what to do with it, which is where I'm really stuck.",2015-12-31 02:06:42+00:00,cygugpu,4.0,t1_cygtyeb,930.0,furry

If you could help me in any way with my fursona, that would be great!
As for the webcomics, I tried to read Concession... That didn't go well... I also read Original Life. It wasn't that bad, but it wasn't my favorite.

But it seems like things are just kind of insane
Because the world is crying but nobodys listening
So please leave a message on my cell phone
I see bullets getting better, biblical weather
And that guy on TV is like a total asshole
Who are you wearing tonight?
Celebrity fund raiser, tight
Black ties making wrongs right
Hows your social band-aid?
I dont know much
I dont know too much
But I know this
Shit is fucked up
I guess its all about the dream
The ends justify the means
I'm telling you shit is fucked up
You know its all about the dream
The ends justify the means
Now thank god for the media, for saving the day
Putting it all into perspective in a responsible way
With more celebrity news, typical bullshit views
I think were losing this fight, sponsored by Bud Light
And now were rockin the casbah and taking the flak
The genies out of the bottle and we cant put it back
All this stuff, its overwhelming my brain
Can you see the storm comin?
Its comin' this way
I dont know much
I dont know too much
But I know this
Shit is fucked up
I guess its all about the dream
The ends justify the means
I'm telling you shit is fucked up
You know its all about the dream
The ends justify the means
Justify the means
Shopping sprees, RPGs
Ecstasy, atrophy, genocide
Pimp my ride, politicize, euphemize
Injustice everywhere
Apathy, I dont care
Hurricanes, climate change, huh
Therapy, I wont tell
Rehab and LOL
Worldwide calamity
TV reality, euthanize, super size
Death squads and boob jobs
VIP infamy, gratify instantly
