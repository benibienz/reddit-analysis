I know I’m not the first person to say it, or write it, or think it. And I hate to say that I know I won’t be the last.

I was **officially** diagnosed with it about two weeks ago. I must say, it was exciting for me to realize that there actually is a disorder for what I had been through. The overly anxious fear of something as simple as talking to anybody else, even ordering a meal at a restaurant, sometimes just being in public makes me wish I were dead.

I self-misdiagnosed myself with depression a couple of months ago, and finally found a therapist to help me a couple of weeks ago. She went over what I had told her and realized that my symptoms all pointed to SA. I didn't even know what that was until two weeks ago. Like I said, it was a huge relief to find out that what I was going through could be treated.

But I walked out of her office 45 minutes later and couldn't bring myself to tell anybody. Not my friends, not even my own family. Something about others knowing that I had a mental disorder... It made it seem like I just wanted attention, which is that absolutely last thing I want. But that impending fear of people not liking me for acting like a complete douchebag held me back. Looking back now, I find it kind of funny that I was being held back from what I wanted... no, needed to tell others about.

I think that the reason I'm posting on here is because of what happened over the weekend. It requires a little backstory first. I've been texting this girl for a while, about 6 months now. I hadn't really had any feelings for her until 2 months ago. I hadn't told her, or anyone else for that  after because I was scared. Last Friday was when she went on a retreat with our confirmation group. I had already been on the one in the fall, so I didn't need to go. Anyways, she texted me that night saying that there was some creep who had just met her and wanted to date her. Idk why she told me and no one else. My first response was to help her, which is what I did. I gave her a plan, which I don't need to go too much into detail about. All you need to know is that it involved her feelings of reassurance that she would be fine immediately. I had so many times. SO MANY FUCKING OPPORTUNITIES I HAD TO TELL HER. But I went to bed instead, and so did she, and I wish I hadn't. I wish I had stayed talking to her. I wish I could finally build up the courage to tell her that I wanted to be more than friends. Everything felt right, it was late at night, she needed encouragement, and I was bored out of my mind. But no.

Anyways, the next night came. We started texting like normal. Then she told me that some other kid, call him Chad, talked to her. He expressed his true feelings for her. She didn't know how to feel about him. She was kind of confused, but she went along with it anyways by telling him the same thing. Then Chad asked her to be his girlfriend. She, call her Stacy, didn't know what to say, so she responded, ""sure."" I didn't know what to say. I didn't know what to say at all. I congratulated her, and then went to sleep, as it was late at night again.

I hate it. I hate the voices in my head, warning me not to do anything stupid, not to screw anything up. I hate the ongoing pressure that comes over me whenever I leave the house. I hate my own stubbornness to do the things I know are right.

I wanted to scream. I wanted to punch something. I wanted to flip over all the desks in the house, throw them through the windows, wanted to do anything that would get all the energy out of my face, my hands, my heart in any way I could. But most of all, I wanted to DIE. End it all. No one would ever have to look at my piece of ass others call a face, no one would have to look down on me, no one would have to feel sorry for me and my pathetic life, my stupid mistakes ever again. Even if I did finally build up the courage to tell her something, at that point it was too late. It would either end up in her actually falling in love with the guy, or her leaving Chad and coming to me. Which would result in my being beaten up.

I calmed down the next day. And then I went to mass. Our priest isn't the most qualified, he doesn't know what he's saying most of the time. He makes stuff up that sounds deep to other retards so he can gain a better reputation for the church and himself.

At the homily, he told this story: he was watching a little boy dance around in the park. The boy's grandpa was watching the boy and chuckling, not noticing the priest. The boy finally got the grandpa to dance with him. Then the priest started to applaud for the grandpa. The grandpa stopped, turned around, and yelled, ""father! If I had know you were watching, I wouldn't have done that!"" I think what the priest said after that story really made me snap: Isn't it sad how we are bound by the expectations and boundaries of others?

I wanted to fucking run up to the altar and scream at him, ""DO YOU THINK THIS A FUCKING CHOICE? DO YOU THINK WE WANT TO BE BOUND TO OUR OWN INSECURITIES? DO YOU THINK IT'S EASY TO JUST SAY, 'you know what? Fuck other people and what they think. I'll do what I want.'

I hate it. I hope this doesn't go on for much longer. And if it does, then I will take matters into my own hands in any way I have to. Anyways, I was posting this here because I needed to vent, but also to ask if anyone has any advice? Do you? If you do, that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading this all, if you did.

As you (hopefully!) know, voting for the Shorty Awards has just been opened, and with it is [Mark's tweet](https://twitter.com/markiplier/status/689615624914399236). I don't know about you, but if you are reading this right now, chances are you probably have already voted for him.

I just think that not is one of the best times we have to show Mark our support. Just think about all he has done for so many of us. Endless thanks comments all over YouTube prove that he has been a wonderful addition to thousands of peoples' lives.

When one of his best friends committed suicide, it was a tremendously difficult time for him. He even stopped posting videos for almost a month and almost nothing was heard from him at that time. But when that month was up, he continued his regular posting like nothing happened. And when he was hospitalized, too.

The list goes on and on. All he has done for charity. All his inspirational quotes. He admits past mistakes and looks back and laughs at them all. And probably my favorite part is the fact that he is just himself on the channel. The Fine Bros' *Teens React to Markiplier* had the same results in almost everybody: he reflects what each one of us is inside. He even looks up to the Game Grumps as a role model, who have a much smaller channel than him. Markiplier is the inner child in all of us. 

Sorry, I'm rambling again. I needed to do that, though. Mark Fischbach is my role model and I will never forget it. In short, I just wanted to say that I really hope Mark does win the Shorty Awards, and he does deserve it.

Frankly, i would have liked to stay and talk with her more, but i thought i would see her the rest of the night. Long story short, I did see her a lot more, but didn't talk to her until the next dance, about a week later. Then, we really started talking a lot and I ended up getting her number, she got mine, and she texted me the day after the dance. By this point, i noticed that although she was outgoing, she was a little self-centered, but it wasn't to the point where it pissed me off.

About a month later, I ask her to go to Homecoming with me. She says yes, and I'm super excited. Like I said, I don't have high self esteem, so this was just amazing for me. Then, she asks if this makes us a couple. I say that I thought it would. She says she would only like to stay friends. Now that I'm thinking about it, I didn't really pay attention. I wasn't going to let anything bring me down from my happy place, but I say ok anyways. Two weeks later, Homecoming finally came. This is when stuff started to get bad. 

I meet her at the restaurant, all our friends are there, but for some reason she isn't as talkative as she normally is. I haven't really done anything to make her mad, and I ask her what's wrong but she keeps blowing it off. I don't want to bug her anymore. So i dont. So we eat, and afterwards her parents give us all a ride to the dance. We get into the dance, she looks beautiful to me, and I keep complimenting her but she still looks super pissed. I still have not done anything wrong at this point. We get into the dance itself and I am really excited, they have a ton of snacks and punch and casino games. But she was still not talkative. I try to provoke conversation, but she just shuts me down. The rest of the night basically goes with me doing this over and over again, then we both just kind of stand there awkwardly. For 3 hours. 3 FUCKING HOURS. Anyways, my parents come, pick the two of us up, and drive us to her house. She is suddenly super talkative. The rest of the way. Even at her house. Anyways, I drop her off, go home, and text her again a week later. I had assumed she was pissed because she was probably on her period. I obviously don't bring her period up, and try to strike up normal conversation, but she keeps shutting me down. Normally she texts first, but after that last text, we still haven't talked. And it's been 3 months. I'm so confused. Please any help is needed.
