SiIva: No no no! Stop the rip! You can not keep using undertale sources for these halloween hack rips. It isn't high quality anymore. You've done it like 4 times already.

Someone: But I mean, you know, Toby Fox- did the music. Well... No, you're right.

SiIva: I know I am. Now get to work. And I want it on my desk by 5 pm today.

Someone: *sigh* Yes sir... No undertale, if I just mash it up with nutshack he'll accept it in a heartbeat. Alright, fuck, I don't know. Um... Maybe I should just use one of the presets.

*Space jam version plays*

Someone: Oh god no.

*Snow halation version plays*

Someone: No (couldn't make it out, i think Earthbound?) gameover I already used that one. It's gotta be something better than that. This is a song people are going to hear a lot in the hack, like you die a lot. It's like it's... It's just a part of the game. But... Huh... That- That could work.

Jon: Oh, hey look, i'm popular now. Okay. So, i guess there's nothing in this room then, except from that cop. I'm going around trying everything, nothing's happening. These curtains look important. Nah, Nightshade likes it to be night. In the shade. Doesn't want to acknowledge curtains-uh fuck cut that, just cut that. So now, as always, we come upon the age old point-and-click adventure game adage of having to try everything with everything. You on you. And occasionally trying you with you. On you. It didn't work. Let's try using the crowbar on this Anubis for a second

I'm sorry what? Congratulations you've just won the ""Jef and Paul award for excellence in shopping centers?"". Actually the crowbar snaps in two. Just kidding. Fool me once, i'm mad. Fool me twice, how could you? Fool me three time you're officially that guy, okay, you know, you know the one. You go to the bar and he's like ""This suit is uh, Officially, it's a Giorgio Armani, actually my dad knows him"". Fuck You! I Aaaaain't having that shit.

So, what your actually supposed to do is look at the painting from a distance. Let me go ahead a break that down for you, your supposed to look at the painting from a distance, walk up to it quickly, and scuttle through it. This is clearly the obvious. So after all this nonsense, you turn off the water, and now you can finally exit the grate in the fist area to enter the game's overworld. Oh, great. The grate's stuck. Cool! What a great grate! My great-great grandfather had a grate that was greater-bleh.

(Sounds of Jon being sick)

Jon: Jeez, this is a biiiig overworld. How'd they fit so much onto this little cartridge? In fact, it seems everyone around Nightshade's town requires some sort of saving or another. Help! Save me! Well, your oddly complacent for someone who is about to die a fiery death! U no? Oooh! Ooooh! Your...oh my god! You stay up there! Just stay up! I'm coming! I'm coming right up! Oh, jeez!

Oh Nightshade! My hero! Ah shit. Well, i guess that's it. Aw man. Okay, so this one of those games that gives you no feedback whatsoever. I'm just going around doing random thing waiting for something to happen, but all my luck. It never does. Oh, you know? A giant rat. Oh god, did he just sneeze at me? Gross. Fuck it, i ain't above punching rats! Yeah!
