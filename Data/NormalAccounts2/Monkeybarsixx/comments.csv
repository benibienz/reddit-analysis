36,"The Dwarves still rule beneath the mountain, so it's pristine on the inside, but on the outside, there are only ruins and whatever other structures that settlers have made over the years. It was all a great Dwarven city at one point, but it was attacked and the Dwarves fled underground. I'm not too sure what I kind of mood I want to set. Although, I want this to be a trial for the party. It should be a great obstacle they have to overcome, and if they do so, the Dwarves might have a bit of respect for them. I imagine this would be some sort of automaton, like a golem or elemental, controlled by magic, which would allude to the Dwarven King that rules the city, as he's basically trapped in a suit of enchanted full plate to keep him alive. 

I'm more so focused on narrative combat. It'd be cool if the guardian had a weakness they would have to work together to exploit. Maybe like a crystal or something, which could also be seen in the King's armor. Maybe this could be a broken statue that slowly comes to life as the party approaches.
