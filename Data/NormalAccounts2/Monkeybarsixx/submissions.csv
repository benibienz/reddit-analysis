**Gregor Ironheart**: The last son of the old Jarl, and is on a quest to avenge his family and gather forces to stop the tyrant that killed his family and took the throne. Gregor is a fighter and wields his ancestral sword in battle. 

**Dragar Hillforger**: A Dwarf that was born nearly 1000 years ago. His clan tried to settle on the surface and make peace with mankind after the Dwarves attempted to conquer the land. Dragar stopped a group of barbarians from attacking his settlement, but they were convinced he was a god. Unfortunately for Dragar, he was sealed into a tomb by the savages. Miraculously, Dragar wasn't killed. He was frozen and sealed away for centuries during an event called ""The Long Night"". (Sort of stolen from Game of Thrones, albeit unknowingly at the time) Now Dragar is a man out of time in search of his people. He wants to fight against the tyrant to bring an end to the bloodshed. Dragar is like Ser Davos from Game of Thrones. Now that I think about it, this might be turning into a GoT campaign, with all of the evil rulers and undead armies in the cold north. 

**Eluno**: An Elven druid. His order was killed off by the tyrant's army because the druids were containing an ancient lich in the icy mountains they hail from. Eluno likes to turn into animals. He has amnesia and was once an explorer for a group of Elves that are highly talented in the magical arts. He wants to be able to communicate in his animal form. 

**Boris**: I forgot the character's last name. He's a bard and mostly contributes to the lore. He's a nobleman who has a thirst for adventure. He reminds me of Bronn and Tyrion Lannister combined. He's a storyteller and wants to write about the creatures he finds and about the journey of Gregor.

I've ran a few Pathfinder games as well as a few Edge of the Empire games, but those are both pretty different from Dungeon World. I tend to ramble in my posts so I'll get to it.

Last game I ran, yesterday, it was intended to be a one-off game as most of the players couldn't join our Thursday Pathfinder game. I ran a Dungeon World game. Read through the ""Tight Dungeon World One Shot Guide"" beforehand. 

The players came up with a great set of characters and gave me enough information to come up with the setting. The game took place in a desert, after their airship crashed because it was sabotaged by a servant of their collective enemy, the Sultan of Oasis. The PC's had a goal. Get to Oasis and deal with the Sultan. The Thief wanted to help the Wizard steal the Sultan's staff so they could gain his power, and the Ranger wanted to find out what happened to an Elven scouting group. The Ranger believes the Sultan is holding them hostage, as the Sultan believes the elves stole a relic from a temple on the outskirts of Oasis. The Thief stole it, but nobody but the Wizard knows that.

Anyways, the beginning was good, but my problem lies within the way I run scenes. I'll describe what happened and hopefully I can get some advice. 

Party crashes in the middle of the desert. The wake up as ""Sand Orcs"", which the PC's said were like Orcs, but in the desert, were scavenging from the wreckage. The Ranger wanted to talk to the Orcs, so I let them have a conversation, I didn't think a roll was necessary, he didn't have leverage, so no Parley. Meanwhile, the Thief was trying to protect the wizard, so he drew his rapier and threatened the Orcs. The head Orc told the Ranger he would spare the PC's as long as they stood down. The Ranger tried to talk him down, but still no obvious leverage that I could tell, so he rolled Defy Danger + CHA and got a 7. 

The Orcs told him that they would take the Ranger, but spare the rest. The Wizard cast a spell and tried to threaten the Orcs. I let him use the Ritual move, because the area was filled with magical energies from the crashed airship's core. A successful Spout Lore roll from the Thief told him that the Orcs were superstitious and were afraid of spirits, so the Wizard conjured up the spirits of the nearby corpses. It was creative thinking, so I said the Orcs were scared off, with the help of the Wizard's threat to unleash the spirits. 

I don't know if that was a good idea. It felt sort of undramatic, but the players enjoyed it, so that's ok. I just think it should've been more eventful than the Orcs trembling in fear and running off into the desert. Anyways, the PC's wanted to search for something useful in the wreckage. I think someone rolled a Discern Realities and got an 8 or something, so I gave them some loot that they would've got from killing the Orcs, and they took some wood and sail from the wreckage. I never know how much treasure to give out. I know it's not set in stone and it's whatever is most fitting for the story, but I like suggestions.

Moving on, the PC's wanted to find shelter and prepare for the long journey to the nearest town. So, the Ranger decided he'd follow the Orc tracks for a ways, and then they'd break off when they found somewhere that looked remotely decent. They all rolled well on their rolls for Undertaking a Perilous Journey. Although, I don't know how many rations it takes to travel, so I don't know how many the quartermaster saved. ]

They eventually found a rocky area which looked safe enough and they found a few rocky outcroppings. Someone rolled Spout Lore or Discern Realities, I can't remember which. They knew that Ankhegs made similar holes in cliffs, so they were on their guard. I think there was a Take Watch rolled somewhere, I don't remember. They threw a torch into the cave, and yep, an ankheg came out hissing and spitting acid, which was followed by the obligatory, ""What do you do?"". This is my biggest problem area. 

The Thief immediately said, ""I grab the wizard's arm, and we run back to camp!"" Cool. Defy Danger + Dex. Wizard rolled a 6 and the Thief rolled an 11. Thief ran forward, unharmed, but the Wizard fell to the ground, an Ankheg on top of him. Ranger and his bird ran towards the scene. The Thief turned and applied poison to his blade. Meanwhile, the Akheg was trying to bite at his prey, but the Wizard was barely managing to hold him off with his staff. The Thief charged at the distracted Ankheg and speared the creature in the back. He caught the thing by surprise, as it was preoccupied with the wizard. He rolled decently on his backstab, and got to do damage, but his rapier was caught between the plates in the bug's chitinous hide. He gave the Wizard a chance to Defy Danger + Dex to scoot out from under the rearing insect. The Ranger started to shoot at the Ankheg with his bow, but rolled a 9, so he had to spend an ammo to finally land a shot in between the gaps in the Ankheg's armor. 

The Thief was attacked by another Ankheg, while the Wizard started zapping the first with Magic Missiles. 

I think that's about where we had to wrap it up, one of the players had to leave. I guess my problem isn't as obvious now that I've typed it out. Lost in translation I guess. My problem is rolling with the 6-'s, and the 7-9's. I struggle with making everything seem good, although my players said they enjoyed it, so it's not all bad.",DungeonWorld,New DM in Search of Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonWorld/comments/4j88lo/new_dm_in_search_of_advice/

That's fine and dandy, but I was hard pressed for ideas. I didn't know what benefit to give the players, and I wasn't sure what a good weakness would be.

Personally, I like it for a less ""magicky"" bard, so I'll let him use it, but I have one problem. 

The ""Better Bard"" receives a starting move called ""Stories and Legends"", which reads as follows:

""When you **declare that you've heard tell of something or someone important**, name the book, song, or story you've learned of it from. Then ask the GM any one question about it and roll+INT. *On a 7+, the GM will provide you with an answer. *On a 10+, the answer will be more elaborate, providing information immediately useful or relevant to you.""

This seems too similar to the Spout Lore move, which reads as:

""When you consult your accumulated knowledge about something, roll+Int. ✴On a 10+, the GM will tell you something interesting and useful about the subject relevant to your situation. ✴On a 7–9, the GM will only tell you something interesting—it’s on you to make it useful.

I've never ran a Dungeon World game before, or really any game besides a pre-made Pathfinder adventure. So, any advice on my first quest would be great. My players contributed with a bit and helped set up a lot of back story, which will form the backbone of the adventure. I haven't finished reading through the rules, so I don't have this written out as a front yet or anything. 

I digress. Here we go...

The party consists of an elven druid who lost his memory when he nearly froze to death. He was taken in by druids, and they uncovered his abilities. He received a vision of a man getting his throat slit, a red banner of the tyrant Jarl, and a burning village...

Bringing us to the fighter, Gregor Ironheart. Son of a Jarl, but the throne was taken, and now a tyrant sits upon it. Gregor's family was slaughtered under the Jarl's orders, and now Gregor seeks vengeance and his family's throne. For now he hides out an inn, waiting for his uncle to return from a scouting expedition in search of a family heirloom or something. 

Bjornolf, another highborn, but from another Hold and from a lesser family. This one is a bard. Imagine Tyrion Lannister and Bronn combined. Sort of Bjornolf. He's also at the inn that Gregor has been staying at. He loves to tell takes and travel the world. 

Finally we have Dragar. A dwarf who was frozen long ago, in an event known as ""The Long Night"", which is pretty much like the thing of the same name from Game of Thrones. Dragar was revered as a God by a tribe of savages. They put him in a tomb, and a few hundred years later, he was discovered by adventurers. They're holding him in the town until the Jarl's men arrive. 

So now that that's out of the way, the adventure will start in Grenwood. A small logging village that is loyal to the old regime. A troop of soldiers, lead by the Jarl's right hand man, will stop at the village for supplies and to hear their oath of fealty. An argument between a soldier and some bar patrons will ensue, allowing the party to deal with the resulting situation, however they decide to do it. 

I expect a fight will go down, so the rest of the troops will arrive, possibly sending the party on the run. I might also introduce the ""Frost Fallen"", who are undead, very similar to White Walkers. Their introduction would change things up quite a bit. 

Would an introduction of two antagonistic factions be too much? Any tips or advice? I'll answer any questions you may have. I'm probably missing a bit of the story, but I've got stuff that needs to get done, so I have to finish this post up.

Country of purchase: USA

Budget range: ~$1500

Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): Looking for a laptop that can be used for school, but also for gaming. I'll be using this in place of a desktop.

Screen size preference: N/A

OS preference (Windows/Mac/Linux): Windows

Gaming requirements (list example games and desired fps/settings): I would like to be able to play games like Fallout and Elder Scrolls and other high end games with reasonably high FPS and graphics settings if possible. 

Other performance requirements (video editing, CAD, etc.): N/A

Portability requirements (constantly carried, frequently moved, mostly stationary, etc.): Mostly at home, but I like the option of taking it places.

Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility): N/A

Any particular style that you like (examples are great): I've been looking at the MSI Ghost Pro, as well as a few Asus laptops, and a few Sager ones.

Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one or two)

Long battery life -vs- Low weight -vs- High performance: I am not really sure. I don't think I need a super long battery life, since I'll usually be near an outlet.

Build quality -vs- Low price: Not really sure. Would like a nice build quality, but if there is a better deal I would be interested in a low price.

List any critical features:

Which features would you pay a premium for? (eg. high resolution screen, great keyboard/touchpad/audio, low noise/heat): Not really important to me. High resolution screen and good keyboard would be a plus.

I'm planning on making a paladin or fighter that was once an Anti-Paladin. He was born and raised to fight in the name of a dark god. All he knows is hate and evil.

Edit: Forgot important details. I was thinking the Pally would show the Anti-Paladin he was being used by his father and the cult that they're in. The Anti-Paladin would respect those who are strong and brave, which the Old Pally is. I think the Anti-Paladin would come to respect the old man. The Anti-Paladin wouldn't take to kindly to being used by his father, and sees that as a weakness in himself. He's no better than those he takes prisoner. He's weak, yet this old man in front of him is strong, even as he burns alive as he's being sacrificed. He would see that there are other options.

Basically, the character was raised to be an unholy warrior since he was a child. He was beaten, abused, and forced to kill, by his father, all in the name of an evil god. His father lead a cult and worshipped this evil god. The character was often sent to take prisoners fit for sacrifice and servitude. On one outing, after finding a group of escaped slaves, an old man stepped forward and challenged the Antipaladin. The old man was defeated, but kept alive. It turns out the old man used to be a paladin, and his words eventually get to the Antipaladin. He realizes that he is a slave to his father and the dark god, no better than those he took prisoner. So, he flees the cult in the night after setting their camp on fire. He seeks out the order the old man belonged to. 

Is this an ok backstory? It's more of an outline for now, I guess. I'm wondering if the character should start off as a young man that is trying to change his ways, now as a paladin, or if he should be a harsh, older man, that delivers justice swiftly and brutally.
