I've got issues with it sending my HOTAS haywire sadly, but people say Sublevel Zero is brilliant. Fingers crossed I can work  way to fix it as other people play with the same stick, no issues. 

Elite Dangerous as you've said is great and War Thunder has been covered. 

House of the Dying Sun is short blasts of cool space shootouts with a tactical side if that interests you, but I was able to get by just flying/shooting. 

Very very early access but already showing a lot of potential is CDF Starfighter. I've spent hours just flying round enjoying how pretty it is and trying the different ships. Has some missions in place but the AI needs work and there are plenty of bugs. One to keep an eye on.

The other night I tried fan game Star Wars: Battle of Endon and felt like a kid again, zipping round blasting Tie Fighters :D

I think my most anticipated space shooter right now is Everspace. Looks utterly beautiful. You can 'aquire'... ahem.. the alpha build that backers of the game got (as far as I could tell if you back it now you dont get this or I'd have paid up immediately). Currently VR support has no HUD and runs really low res, but it's got the most engaging combat of any I've tried so far. Visuals are stunning and judging by their website it'll be finished sooner than the rest.

24,"I mentioned this in the last post the game was mentioned, but I have a problem using my Saitek X52 Pro with Sublevel Zero. I was starting to think it might be a driver issue, but this doesn't occur with any other game I try (e.g. Elite Dangerous, CDF Starfighter). I've cleared profiles, created blank ones, reinstalled drivers, the usual troubleshooting stuff.

All my inputs get read as being pressed twice which makes navigating menus impossible. Soon after, the screen on the throttle starts flickering as it can't keep up with repeated entries and trying to change the input name. Buttons get stuck and display that they're being pressed until I press them again several more times. The double input has left me many a time with nothing on the menu selected and unable to do anything but Alt+F4 out (keyboard doesn't do anything at this point).

I'm now past the 2hr mark for a refund after spending so long trying to get the thing working properly, and ultimately I want to support and enjoy the game, so this sucks :/

As I said, this only happens when I load Sublevel Zero.

27,"HotDS is great and I'd definitely recommend it, but from my 10mins with Valkyrie at EGX a year or so back, I wouldn't say they're that similar. HotDS has a lot more going on with the strategy view / commands (I'm personally not that keen on that stuff, just wanted an arcade shooter).

The most promising arcade space shooter I've played is CDF Starfighter. It's very much Early Access right now, but flying through asteroid fields looks utterly glorious (I'd argue better than Elite Dangerous in a lot of places). The AI still has a long way to go, and for HOTAS you currently have to edit a config file (their steam discussion page has loads of info about this and you can pretty much copy / paste for your stick). Loving it so far.

I'm still excited to play Valkyrie, even if it's not much more than dogfighting, but i'll be waiting for the Vive release later this year.",2016-08-16 11:48:02+00:00,d6jkdus,2,t1_d6jjoff,1904,Vive

49,"Just had a quick go, great work so far. Been hoping for a VR version of something like Substance Painter so this has real potential.

Probably one of the easier features I'd suggest you add soon would be the UV island boundarys overlayed on the 2D canvas view. With the Vive controller model as an example, it would help when trying to avoid the buttons.

An undo option is pretty essential, though I'm sure you already have a list of the tools/features you'd lift from existing art programs.

I think you should change the layer buttons to different colours, and maybe colour part of the frame so you can see which layer is currently selected.

The staggered layering is kinda cool looking, but really impractical when it comes to any attempt at accuracy.

Like in Substance Painter, I'd add the option for brushstrokes to automatically bleed into other UV islands when painting on the model, as well as the current setup where the center of your brush has to have moved into the next island. It's the only way you'll avoid seams.
