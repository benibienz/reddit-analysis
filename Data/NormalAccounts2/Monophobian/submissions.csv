I personally stopped playing multiplayer games a long time ago because I can't stand the macho bullshit that goes along with it. 

When VR came along, this changed for me. It felt like the good old days where people were just happy to play games together without the need to insult each others mums or throw a wobbly. Given how small the current VR community is, it's been a really pleasant experience so far.

Unfortunately in the 4 player session I was in, some arsehole deemed himself worthy of moaning throughout 30odd waves - ""what are you guys doing"", ""you guys suck"", ""oh my god"", moan moan bloody moan etc. etc. - (despite me being a close second scorewise, getting loads of headshots, healing the gate.)

So to that user, if you read this; spare a thought for others before you voice your opinions in such a childish manner. VR is still very new, maybe it was the first time the other 2 in the match had played, maybe they aren't gamers but are excited to try this new technology, maybe they just aren't that good. It really doesn't matter.

Signing of with ""you guys are fucking idiots"" then rage quitting is pathetic and could well put people off trying an online experience again in what I think is the most exciting new technology we've had in a long long time.

I really like where QuiVR is going, really impressed, especially as a one man project. Having seen some comments on the development posts about the placeholder hands, I messaged /u/blueteak to see if he'd like... well, a hand (sorry). He sent me the current ones to work over and you can see the replacement I made in the link.
I've a little left to do to make sure thing's look right in Unity before sending the files across, but hopefully it's liked (even as a stop gap) enough to be implemented in future releases.
