7,"With all due respect, that is bullshit. I'd like to see you try to supposedly take me down with half of lvl45 tanks.

Weaker penetration matters because I don't want to be having to 2-shot a 4 health/4 body damage bullet spammer.

11,"Thanks for teaching me how to play with hybrid. Your point is wrong because less penetration means less overall damage.
