Cost certainty is ruined that way.  Historically corps love conservative leaning governments because they get more favourable tax treatment from them.

1) You aren't a bandwagon fan.  Part of this is personality, part is if you cheer for any team long enough (I'd say more than a decade), it just feels weird and inauthentic to cheer as passionately for another team.  This is enhanced even more so if that team has as much success as the Niners have had (Browns fans, gosh, that takes some dedication).  That's not to say that you can't appreciate other teams, for instance, the success the Vikings are having in face of the adversity they've had losing Teddy and AP, or the winning machine that is the Patriots.

2) Performing analysis is one thing, but you wouldn't find it as interesting and engaging if that analysis didn't include having some skin in the game (however superficial it may be).  You offer really decent analysis and given #1 you're also pretty passionate about what needs to be done to turn around the Niners, about the decisions that make sense and the ones that don't.

48,"I realize this thread is 4 months old, but I've been doing research on this very thing and figured I'd add my $0.02.  Even though Vancouver has so many fantastic attributes, due to insane housing costs, very bad traffic and the predominance of rain, Vancouver was crossed off my list and the choice narrowed down to Victoria vs Kelowna.

/u/mizuno04 mentions that the climate in Victoria is much nicer but  it all depends on how nicer is defined.  In terms of Victoria to Vancouver comparison, he/she is right, both are similar climate wise but Victoria gets far less rain and cloud.  In comparison to Kelowna, if you do not want to deal at all with cold or snow, then yes, Victoria's climate is nicer than Kelowna.  However, that same temperate climate means Victoria never really gets warm in the summer (24C average), and it is much windier than Kelowna. You need to consider the wind in a damper climate like Victoria and on the climate score personally I'd rather trade a bit of mild cold in the winter for very little wind and some real heat in the summer months. (weatherspark.com has great data showing averages for temp/sun/cloud/wind etc.)  You'll also want to note that Kelowna is on average overcast or cloudy 85+% of the time in the winter months, but rarely does it ever get the cold snaps that can grip the prairies.  Victoria will get 2X-3X the yearly precipitation that Kelowna receives.

People are great in both places.  Kelowna leans more conservative, Victoria more liberal.  Kelowna and the OK in general have to deal with a mass influx of tourists (like me) in the summer.  As a Calgarian I take a little issue with ""I like good people, people can really make a community hence I'm not moving to AB.""  Albertans are, like most Canadians, awesome people.  I really don't think it is a fair criticism, however Alberta does lean heavily conservative which may not be your cup of tea.  Calgary's #1 problem is climate.  #2 is the over-reliance on the carbon energy industry... but I'm getting off topic here.

Victoria and Kelowna are a couple of the most desirable places to live in Canada and as a result housing costs in both places are very high.  Kelowna proper has higher average costs mostly due to the large influx of wealthy retired couples who continue to move there in large numbers.  

Victoria is far more cosmopolitan, if that is your thing. Being ""trapped"" on the island is also a real thing too.  Check out ferry prices, it isn't cheap to get off and back, nor is it great having to plan your schedule around the ferry schedules.  However I have an aunt who has lived on the island for decades and is perfectly happy to be ""stuck"" there, it all depends on how you live your life.

I've not lived in BC, but I have visited lots and since I'm considering moving in the not too distant future, I did a bunch of research on weather comparing Calgary, Vancouver, Kamloops and Kelowna.   Here is some data.

Legend:
frigid (below -9°C), freezing (-9°C to 0°C), cold (0°C to 10°C), cool (10°C to 18°C), comfortable (18°C to 24°C), warm (24°Cto 29°C), hot (29°C to 38°C) and sweltering (above 38°C).

**Temperature** (Calgary is freezing or frigid 40% of the time in the winter.  Kelowna is slightly more temperate than Kamloops, both of which are much warmer than Calgary, but much cloudier in the winter. Vancouver is cold to cool most of the time)

* Vancouver is temperate, no real cold, but never really warming up.  It is cold to cool most of the time.

* Calgary is very cold in the winter and mostly comfortable in the summer

* Kamloops is on slightly colder than Kelowna in the winter and slightly warmer in the summer than Kelowna

**Cloud** (Calgary sunniest, Vancouver least, Kamloops and Kelowna both have no sun 50% of the winter, Kelowna more sun than Kamloops in the summer)

* Calgary - 80% of the time has some sun

* Kelowna, Kamloops and Vancouver - winter, 50% of the time there is no sun (overcast or mostly overcast)

* Kamloops is not as clear as Kelowna during the summer

**Precipitation**  (Vancouver most, Kelowna least.  Least thunderstorms in Kelowna)

* Calgary 40% POP in the winter 55% in the summer.  Light or moderate snow in the winter, light rain or thunderstorms(25%) in the summer

* Vancouver 70% POP in the winter, 28% in the summer.  Almost always light or moderate rain (10% light snow)

* Kamloops 50% in the winter, 35-40% in the summer.  Mostly light rain in summer, thunderstorms (12%), mostly light snow in winter.

* Kelowna 40% in the winter, 40% in the summer.  Mostly light snow in the winter, mostly light rain in the summer, thunderstorms (7%)

**Snow** (Calgary snowiest, Vancouver least, Kamloops and Kelowna roughly the same)

* Calgary:  only June - August has less than 10% chance of snow

* Vancouver: Feb - November has less than 10% chance of snow

* Kamloops and Kelowna: March - October has less than 10% chance of snow

**Wind**  (Calgary windiest, Kelowna least)

* Calgary 4-5 m/s average, 7-9 max

* Vancouver 3-4 m/s average, 6-7 max

* Kamloops 2-3 m/s average, 6-7 max

* Kelowna 1-2 m/s average, 4-6 max

I don't have the data for Victoria but in general it is much drier and sunnier than Vancouver.   I sourced, summarized and bastardized this data from weatherspark, which is great weather website.

He's right that we contribute a small amount of CO2 in the grand scheme of things.  But per capita we are energy hogs.  Now I f we can afford it, both in terms of energy costs AND externalized costs to the environment, then there is nothing wrong with being an energy hog.  In fact, bravo to us. But when the scientific consensus is clear that CO2 needs to come down, then we have a moral obligation to do our part regardless how small that part may be in the worldwide picture.

More often than not that power is abused against the black community disproportionately.

A large chunk of this sub are shitting on Kap for his stance.  From a morality stand point, I commend him for bringing attention to the issue, although I think he might learn a ton if he was actually to take up Halloran's offer to see the other side of the story.  I also think Kap probably doesn't realize how much harder he's making it for him to remain on the team.  (Either that or he doesn't care.)

It's too bad so many people can't hold a rational discussion about these things, put aside their bias and learn a thing or two.

I must be looking at this too simplistically?  If it isn't ""somewhere"" to me that necessarily means it is nowhere, which means it doesn't exist.  Further, how can orbital diagrams be constructed if an electron never has a position?  An orbital diagram to me implies at some point in time, the electron was or will be at various measurable points within orbit X.  

Also [the double slit experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment) found that ""the light is always found to be absorbed at the screen at discrete points, as individual particles (not waves), the interference pattern appearing via the varying density of these particle hits on the screen'.  And ""other atomic-scale entities such as electrons are found to exhibit the same behavior when fired towards a double slit"".  I interpret this to mean the electron has a position - it was splattered on the screen at position Y and we see it.  If we can see it then, what is it about an ""atomic orbital"" that makes an electron vanish?

203,"Descartes began with ""I think therefore I am."" He equated thinking with being.  300 years later Jean-Paul Sartre looked at Descartes' statement and realized ""The consciousness that says I Am, is not the consciousness that thinks.""  As Eckhart Tolle says, ""When you are aware that you are thinking, the awareness is not part of the thinking. It is a different dimension of thinking... If there were nothing but thought in you, you wouldn't even know you are thinking. You would be like a dreamer who doesn't know he is dreaming.""

In Tolle's book A New Earth, he expands on this, I will excerpt it here:

""Who is the Experiencer?""

""What you see and hear, taste, touch, and smell are, of course, sense objects. They are what you experience. But who is the subject, the Experiencer?  If you now say, for example, ""Well of course, I, Jane Smith, senior accountant, 45 years old, divorced, mother of two, American, am the subject, the Experiencer"", you are mistaken. Jane Smith and whatever else becomes identified with the mental concept of Jane Smith, are all objects of experience, not experiencing subject. 

Every experience has three possible ingredients: sense perceptions, thoughts or mental images, and emotions. Jane Smith, senior accountant, 45 years old, mother of two, divorced, American – these are all thoughts and therefore part of what you experience the moment you think these thoughts.  They and whatever else you can say and think about yourself are objects, not the subject.  They are experience, not the Experiencer. You can add 1000 more definitions (thoughts) of who you are and by doing so will certainly increase the complexity of the experience of yourself (as well as your psychiatrist's income) but in this way, you will not end up with the subject, the Experiencer who is prior to all experience but without whom there would be no experience. 

So who is the Experiencer? You are. And who are you? Consciousness. And what is consciousness? This question cannot be answered. The moment you answer it, you have falsified it, made it into another object. Consciousness, the traditional word for which is spirit, cannot be known in the normal sense of the word, and seeking it is futile.  All knowing is within the realm of duality – subject and object, the knower and the known.  The subject, the I, the knower without which nothing could be known, perceived, thought, or felt, must remain forever unknowable. This is because the I has no form. Only forms can be known, and yet without the formless dimension, the world of form could not be. It is the luminous space in which the world arises and subsides. That space is the life that I Am. It is timeless. I am timeless, eternal.  What happens in that space is relative and temporary: pleasure and pain, gain and loss, birth and death.

The greatest impediment to the discovery of inner space, the greatest impediment to finding the Experiencer,  is to become so enthralled by the experience that you lose yourself in it. It means consciousness is lost in its own dream. You get taken in by every thought, every emotion, and every experience to such a degree that you are in fact in a dream like state.   This has been the normal state of humanity for thousands of years.

Although you cannot know consciousness, you can become conscious of it as yourself. You can sense it directly in any situation, no matter where you are. You can sense it in here and now as your very Presence, the inner space in which the words on this page are perceived and become thoughts. It is the underlying I Am. The words you are reading and thinking are the foreground, and I Am is the substratum, the underlying background to every experience, thought, feeling.""


The scientists among us (of which I am one) find this concept very hard to initially accept because scientists want empirical data.  But as Eckhart explains it has to do with the duality - subject and object.  I highly recommend picking up his book and doing more reading on it.

Are you genuinely surprised?
First, Hillary entered this race with a very healthy dollop of pre-existing hate from people who have always disliked her (justified or not).  Then, when she is placed in such stark contrast to someone like Bernie, even more people began to see her for who she truly is, and it isn't particularly flattering.  Beholden to special interests, willing to say anything if it is politically expedient. A war hawk, etc. For the younger generations in particular she embodies everything wrong with the current state of politics.  If the Republicans hadn't fielded such an incredibly pathetic field of candidates they could have quite easily taken back the Presidency.  Instead they have Trump, and well, good luck with that. 
Many want to see the system changed and Hillary offers zero chance of that.  That's why some Bernie supporters will in fact support Trump, because he at least appears to be an outsider who will shake up the system.  Of course it may mean he burns the entire house to the ground but even that can be appealing if you're fed up with the current system.

On another note, Chip was a good hire by Baalke (Jed?).  Lots of risk, for sure, but none of us will be shocked if Chip dramatically turns around the Offense.  Jim O'Neill as DC?  From the Browns?! What are the odds on him delivering a lights out defense?  Christ that is not a bet I'm willing to take.  O'Neil is arguably the biggest wildcard to our team this year. If his schemes and playcalling sucks, we finish 4th in the division. If he just had a shit roster in Cleveland and is some diamond in the rough (let's turn up the wishful thinking to 11) then maybe we can challenge for a wildcard.",2016-05-15 04:22:15+00:00,d35zwg8,1.0,t3_4jab6o,80117.0,49ers

&gt;What is the difference between the 20W-50 oil and the 10W-60 oil?
There are two main reasons why the 20W-50 oil is recommended for flat engines up to a displacement of 2.7 litres and the 10W-60 oil is recommended from a displacement of 3.0 litres. Firstly, crucial developments in terms of engine technology, production tolerances and materials took place between the 2.7- and 3.2-litre models, with the introduction of the 3.0-litre turbo engine in 1975 representing the greatest enhancement of engine performance. Secondly, Porsche Classic has drawn here on its extensive experience in the use of oils in air-cooled flat engines. ",2016-03-25 01:43:32+00:00,d1ckabm,2.0,t1_d1cel11,9314.0,Porsche

The serious problems of global warming aside, it's remarkable that even the vicious cycles of boom and bust hasn't been enough to spur Alberta into serious action on diversification (or savings!) And now as momentum begins to build for taking climate change seriously we have the added double whammy of a world that truly is awash in oil.

Would we have gotten more wins than the 5 we had this year?  Considering the fuck up that was our coaching staff this last year I'd give you another win or two, but with that talent loss we still don't hit 8-8.  So at that point it becomes clear Harbaugh isn't another Belichick who works wonders with whatever is in the fridge. 

Harbaugh was the beneficiary of a stacked roster who excelled at getting the team to gel and believe in themselves.  Confidence is a huge thing.  But by his last year he'd worn out his welcome with the FO and with many of the players on the team.

568,"Us fans, the media, opposing teams, everybody knows this team is going to keep trying to do the same shit over and over, regardless of whether it is working or not.  Contrast that with a team like the Patriots that go out of their way to not be predictable.
It doesn't matter if they feel the personnel aren't suited to a different style of play.  Why?  Because IT CAN'T GET ANY WORSE THAN IT IS.  It also doesn't matter if they don't feel a player has the knowledge to be put on the field (see: Hayne).  Put Hayne out.  If he fumbles another 15 times, oh well, it's entertaining at least and gets us closer to a top pick.  So see what he can do for crying out loud... nothing will teach him faster than game experience.

So not only the 49ers super boring to watch, if you give half a shit it is infuriating as hell to see these boneheaded decisions.

734,"TL;DW (to my surprise I did watch the entire thing)  
The old Soviet (and by implication current Russian) way of influencing or attempting to overthrow other populations was/is via subversion, a multi-step process involving Denormalization (15-20 years) Destabilization (2 to 5 years), Crisis (6 months to 1 year) and Normalization (where the agents used in the previous steps are forcibly removed so that a small group may hold power).  He then argues that to stop this process takes more effort the further along in the subversion process you go.  He says ultimately we must consume less (not such a bad idea IMO), stop listening to media and others who wield power that was not democratically given to them (again not such a bad idea), restrict most equal rights (wtf) and restore moral authority (hell no).  
So OP, by linking to this video, is offering what appears to be a behind the scenes look at how some countries operate, when really, all major world powers are fully engaged in all sorts of propaganda and subversion.
The guy in the video is smart but a bit of a crackpot.  While he may have a thorough understanding of tactics used by government states, he is unable to see that the way we evolve, the way we personally achieve happiness and end the endemic of violence and control on this planet is not by going back to the dark ages of dogma and religious authority.  Instead, we need to transcend above our ego based state of consciousness.",2015-09-06 03:26:48+00:00,cus5obb,1.0,t3_3jskeb,18886.0,videos
735,Just remember that there are many people who considered the attacks of 9/11 to be justice for what America does in other parts of the world.  That of course does not excuse the atrocity of what happened but what is important to realize is an eye for an eye truly does make the world blind. We must learn to break the cycle of ego or one of these days something so catastrophic will happen that it will be the end of us all.  There are many teachers out there who can help us identify the ego and then begin to break the cycle of suffering that it causes.  This suffering is not just the suffering of others but also our personal suffering as well.  If you are interested in learning more pick up one of Eckhart Tolle's books.
