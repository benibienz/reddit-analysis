We're trying to get an idea of what neighborhoods we'd end up in based on our 3 key requirements.  1st is to keep the commute tolerable - we've been looking at real estate in a max 30 minute radius.  I've been researching this as best I can but since I'm not from the Dallas area it's difficult to know exactly where that 30 minute radius extends out to.  Obviously a Google Maps 30 minute radius does not take into account traffic patterns.  From what I can tell communities on the short list are Coppell, Carrolltown, Farmer's Branch (and further NW?) and to a lesser extent Southlake, Grapevine, Flower Mound.  Public school quality is a big concern as is noise from DFW, and from what I've read Southlake/Grapevine/Flower Mound really suffer from jet noise.  Is this true?  Any other words of advice about best bets? Thanks!
EDIT: DFW Airport has a couple of very helpful [pages which detail noise contours and a distribution of complaints](http://cdn.ifma.org/airp/docs/default-source/2015-Spring-Conference-Presentations/ifma-briefing-5-5-14-draft2.pdf?sfvrsn=2) very useful!

There is a good chance I will be moving to the Seattle metro and I'd be looking for real estate to purchase in that area. (I understand it's going through a bit of a bubble, but I can't control that, my target is the 500-700s.) Work would have me in Issaquah and I'd like to keep the commute in my car to 30 min max (on a bad day, less if possible). I'd need an area with good public schools for my children (so I think Renton is out based on scores I saw). What are the opinions on the neighborhoods as far as value, appeal, schools etc.? I've been in Seattle twice, staying once in Bellevue, once downtown Seattle. As an outsider scanning the MLS listings, Sammamish looks to have the best value, but I know little else of these neighborhoods.
