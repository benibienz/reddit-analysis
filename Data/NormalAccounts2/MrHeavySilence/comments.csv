She absorbed the language faster than anyone else because she's a leading expert in linguistics. Ian might have been an intelligent theoretical physicist but it doesn't mean he was capable of learning the language with the same level of fluency.

Abbott, the heptapod alien, knew that it would be killed by C4 but didn't stop it because the heptapods experience all of time at once. From Costello's perspective, Costello could talk to Abbott whenever it wanted in the past, present or future. Abbott never actually goes away for Costello even if Abbott dies in that moment because Abbott experiences all of time.

In the future, Louise's daughter dies but Louise is okay with this because from Louise's perspective, she is with her daughter and with Ian at all times, no matter if she is in the past, present or future. 

In your dying in a car crash example, even at the moment that you get hit by another car, you wouldn't be alone. You would still be with your family, your friends, and your loved ones because you would be experiencing and reliving all of time, all the time, everything that had every happened to you and will happen to you. You might not have the same fear of death if you had this perspective.

What I'm saying is that if you just told me point blank that I was going to die in a car crash, I would probably avoid it and exercise my free will to stop that from happening. But if you made me experience all of my life, my entire beginning and end, all at once and all of the time, I might exercise my free will to go with fate because I wouldn't be afraid of death.

77,"Just my opinion as a developer but I think that everyone being on the same OS is really helpful for the overall quality of the platform and experience of both the developers and the users. Hear me out on this one:

Whenever there is an iOS update, the developers can immediately start using the latest features in their apps with the reassurance that a large percentage of iOS users will use it. This creates a feedback loop where iOS users always experience the latest and greatest features and iOS developers always want to adopt the latest and greatest APIs. iOS is also a lot less maintenance because everyone is on the same OS.

Meanwhile on Android, if developers want to put a [Nougat feature](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/nougat/android-7.0.html) in their app pretty much noone will use it so there's no incentive to bring the latest and greatest to Android users. And there are bugs specific to Lollipop, Kitkat, Marshmallow etc. and developers have to deal with all of them because people aren't upgrading, which makes Android apps harder to maintain over time. Android developers have less of a reason to bring the cutting edge to users and users get shortchanged with outdated apps that lag behind the iOS versions.",2016-10-28 08:41:47+00:00,d9b6xvp,2.0,t1_d9agkx3,44897.0,Android

The best example I can think of is Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight- the movie far exceeded the original script in its execution. The same is true with many of Quentin Tarantino's scripts, not that his scripts are bad but his movies come out even better than the blueprints described.

So even though the script may not have been perfect, I'm sure that the cast had faith in David Ayer. Also keep in mind that filmmaking requires shooting the script in a non-linear fashion for budget, permit and time constraints and this affects their abilities to really grasp the scale of the fuck up until everything is shot.

156,"Sure, Rock is definitely a part timer but I feel that Cena's promos against Rock were equating part timer with laziness or half-assing, which I feel was a little undeserved.

Rock doesn't need to come back to the WWE once or twice a year with his bajillion projects a year, movies, 50 million per year salary etc. So when he makes time for WWE out of his busy schedule for the fans, it doesn't make sense for Cena to hold him up to the standard of a full time wrestler. Cena can't see all the crazy hard work that Rock is doing outside of WWE because Cena only plays in the WWE sandbox, so he equates that with Rock being lazy or not showing up.

Similarly, Cena is doing tons of stuff that actually increases publicity for the WWE like the upcoming reality TV show he's doing or all the charity work he does, but Ambrose may not perceive the hard work that Cena is putting in outside of wrestling because Cena is not in front of Ambrose in a tangible way every night while he does 200+ matches a year.

Moreover, even Spider-Man says ""when you can do the things I can, but you don't- then the bad things happen because of you."" That flies in the face of the Sokovia Accords which is basically allowing people that almost nuked New York to control the Avengers from taking action and saving lives.

Remember when Tony Stark created Ultron who almost wiped the entire planet? Imagine if the world governments were like ""Yeah sorry Avengers. You can't fly into Sokovia because its a foreign country and you don't have legal jurisdiction there. We can't let you go in there and stop billions of people from dying because if you go in there and fight then potentially dozens of people could be killed in the melee crossfire.""",2016-09-23 07:56:54+00:00,d7ylzeu,7.0,t1_d7yliml,1590.0,movies

Howard created the serum, which started the arms race between America and Russia for super soldier serum in the first place. Bucky was just a victim of the serum that Howard created. Without Howard, Bucky never could've been turned into a weapon.

Tony never learned from Howard's mistakes. All three super villains from the Iron Man movies exist because of the Starks' unbearable need to create. They just keep making shit that could be used by bad people: the arc reactor, the super soldier serum, the guns and missiles used by terrorists in Iron Man 1 etc. Tony was even responsible for the completion of the Extremis virus. The Sokovia Accords happened because Tony created Ultron which led to the death of Baron Zemo's family.

Cap and Bucky are just victims of what the Starks irresponsibly invent and manufacture. Tony is the one that should have government oversight, not Cap.",2016-09-23 07:25:28+00:00,d7ylfdt,1.0,t3_5430ov,11632.0,movies
175,"To play devil's advocate, Cap did those things because the current establishments can't be trusted.

* The world security council almost nuked New York in Avengers and put their trust in SHIELD which almost killed everyone important in Winter Soldier (which would've included Tony Stark). It doesn't make sense to trust world leaders with the Avengers.

* The only one who actually deserves to be locked up or watched is Tony Stark because he created Ultron, who was capable of ending the world. 

Furthermore, the Starks are the ones that cause most of the problems that led to this movie because they refuse to stop inventing things that could potentially be used by bad people. Let me explain: 

* Howard Stark is shown to be obsessed with inventing things for military application in Agent Carter. 

* If you watch Agent Carter, Howard created the nerve gas that accidentally killed all the American soldiers in WW2, making the Soviets want Howard's inventions in the first place. 

* Howard was also shown to be obsessed with getting access to pym particles for military applications.

* Howard created the super soldier serum as a weapon in the first place which lead to an arms race where the Soviets took that serum and forcibly stuck it into Bucky: including torturing, brainwashing and ruining Bucky's life so that he would kill Howard and take more the serum- which Howard was presumably going to use to make even more super soldiers anyway

* Tony manufactured weapons which were used all over the world by terrorists in Iron Man 1.

* Whiplash (Iron Man 2) and Iron Monger (Iron Man 1) are able to become super villains in the movies because the Starks irresponsibly do not know how to keep the arc reactor from falling into the wrong hands. This is exactly the type of shit that Hank Pym was worried about.

* Tony fixed the Extremis problem in the beginning of Iron Man 3 which allowed The Mandarin to become a super villain and put the president's danger in life.

They went to great lengths to make sure that The Falcon, War Machine and Black Panther were all cast as black actors- staying true to their ethnicity in the comic books. When it came time to cast the only potential Asian character in the MCU they oddly decided not to follow the comic books.

I'm not saying that race should factor into casting, but its a situation they pretty much can't win because all of Marvel's Asian characters  like The Mandarin or The Ancient One are racial stereotypes so you get offended either way whether or not they cast an Asian or White person. Since there haven't been very many Asian writers allowed to write for Marvel or DC I guess there haven't been very many Asian superheroes. I mean, the Asian characters like The Mandarin are pretty much a reflection of what white people thought of Asians in the '60s so Marvel and DC have basically just been inheriting the baggage of the racial stereotypes from the past. Which is pretty much why 99% of the Avengers and Justice League will mostly be white people with a few black people peppered in for pretty much the next fifty to one hundred comic book movies while Hispanics and Asians continue to be invisible in these universes.",2016-04-29 01:59:46+00:00,d2ljpel,2.0,t1_d2lgic6,4306.0,movies

I would say that it might help if you add hobby projects, like a personal projects section. Your resume, as weird as it sounds, doesn't make you stand out because it's not clear what your interests are. The resume doesn't convey passion and interest in any particular subject or type of technology, for lack of a better word. I would structure it in a way that maybe gives the viewer more insight into what you are actually interested in doing, rather than just a collection of qualifications.

293,"This is absolutely my experience as a mobile developer. 

The other thing that makes iOS apps feel better is the animations, the fluidity, the smoothness etc because the framework gives you good enough tools to be creative with UIKit.

On Android, those animation libraries for Material are half-assed and only work on Lollipop and up. Most Android users are still on KitKat and below, where the newest APIs (newest features) aren't even compatible.

So its a combination of iOS sometimes having better libraries and tools (particularly when dealing with Databases or anything UI related) and everyone being on the latest OS- which allows developers to use the latest features instead of dealing with the baggage of shitty older OS versions.

No developer is going to target for Marshmallow when there is only 2% of the user base that can take advantage of those features. 80% of iPhone users are on iOS 9. In order to get 80% of Android users you have to target down to Jellybean, which means all the awesome Material stuff I want to do gets complicated whenever I need a new library that's Lollipop and up.",2016-02-29 16:03:00+00:00,d0i55y7,3.0,t1_d0hwulu,20382.0,Android

296,"As a developer, I feel that the problem is not Material Design itself but lack of tools to make fully fledged Material Design applications.

There are still a lot of holes in the support library. Frankly, they give us just barely enough support but the tools are nowhere near good enough to make the awesome Material Design documentations a true reality across all Android apps.

Plus, over 50% of Android users are still below Lollipop (and if you're a developer trying to make money, you can't ignore the lower API users)- and there's simply no support for the Material animations for those users which sucks. A major selling point of Material is visual continuity and its impossible to implement on half of the devices.

Most apps seem to have the aesthetic down, but just having the look isn't enough. Everybody is ignoring the feeling that Material is supposed to give you- the feeling of fluidity and continuity in transitions and animations. Google has failed to provide adequate freedom in their libraries for that.

They should work on providing better libraries for developers first before jumping to a whole new design philosophy.",2016-02-23 21:38:00+00:00,d0b3xm1,1.0,t3_477mml,15448.0,Android

379,"And you're absolutely right. File Management is usually not a necessity but its a nice thing to have. I absolutely empathize with the Android user who is switching over though. Its not an easy transition to make sometimes.

Think about how photos work on iPhone- aren't you glad that you have Camera Roll access EVERYWHERE? You might need Camera Roll when you use iMessage, edit photos in Instagram, upload to Gmail etc.

Now is it conceivable that users might want the same level of access for Documents or all other types of files?

I'm currently using an iPhone 6 as a test device and occasionally the sandbox gets in my way. Unlike Google Music, Apple Music doesn't play uncompressed FLAC music- so I migrated the music to Vox (which plays mp3, APE and FLAC, closest thing to an Android music player I've found). I used to use voice to choose songs in the car but Siri doesn't recognize music files that aren't in the music app, which is really sad. I wish I could just scan the folders and find it like Google Music.

The other funny thing that happened the other day is I tried using iTransmission to torrent a video and my video players on iPhone had no way of finding it. I think I need to download iFile to solve this problem?

Once I get back home after work, I can usually solve these problems through converting or file management with iTunes. There isn't any problem that can't be solved, but iOS does occasionally give me hoops to jump through.",2015-09-26 23:03:25+00:00,cvf937r,5.0,t1_cvf6dhw,5319.0,apple
380,"I definitely think that file management makes a lot more sense on Android than it does on iOS. Multiple apps can point to the same folder for resources. Just like having Camera Roll everywhere, except with all file types not just pictures. All Document apps can just look at the same Docs folder. Its more like my Macbook in that sense.

Also, being able to download torrents (videos, music, books, apps) and other media to sorted folders on the microSD Card is really useful.

Android apps aren't sandboxed, so being able to have one file manager where you can delete all the stuff you don't want is really handy. iPhone users don't think the same way.

iOS has a way different philosophy that works just as well. If you wanted to edit or delete photos you would go into the Photos app; if you wanted to edit or delete music you would go into the Music app.  With iOS, you indirectly get a file to the place you want by sharing the file from app to app so the files can leave their sandbox (usually Dropbox or Drive being the intermediary).

Its an adjustment but almost anything you would want to do with a file manager you could do by adding Dropbox or Drive as an extra step.",2015-09-26 20:41:47+00:00,cvf4o8a,3.0,t1_cvf1bpg,6256.0,apple

For example, if you're an iOS developer, you could use the newest APIs for iOS 9 because you know that by the end of the month, 80% or more are going to jump to iOS 9 with you. Everyone takes the leap of faith together and that's really awesome as a developer because you can use the latest tools.

It doesn't matter that Android M has all these nice and shiny features because only 1% of people are going to be on it, 20% will be on Lollipop, another 20% on KitKat- so on and so forth. Basically you'll never be able to give your users the latest and greatest Android features- you'll always have to waste time trying to backport some of them even if the features are not optimized for older operating systems.

 This ultimately leads to a shitty experience for older versions but the reviews all matter the same. You'll never be able to just simply use the latest tools and APIs as an Android developer- you're always going to have to worry about how to make it compatible with outdated versions. Right now I'm working on an app that has to be compatible down to 4.1 Jellybean to get 90% of Android users so I understand how painful this is firsthand.",2015-09-23 04:44:40+00:00,cvb1vnm,1.0,t3_3lykni,40434.0,AndroidQuestions

439,"Android shows up as an external storage drive. This is one of the coolest features.

For example, if I have e-books I want to read, music I want to listen, videos I want to watch, stuff outside the play store I want to install etc- I just drag and drop them into folders onto my Android. 

I don't have to go through iTunes (which doesn't allow you to put FLAC in the music library, even though other iOS music apps may be able to play FLAC).

 Apps aren't sandboxed either. Multiple apps can point to the same folder for content. For example, when you download torrent stuff into the Downloads folder- the comic book app, the document signer app, and video player app can look in the same folder for content.

The other cool thing is that there are programs like Airdroid which allow your Android to be a wireless storage device, so you can drag music onto the Android without having to physically connect it with a cable.

All that being said, I have heard from iOS users that iTunes is a lot better now. Your experience switching from one OS to the other OS probably won't be that big.

EDIT: Also want to make clear that I really like iOS too, iOS standby time is way more efficient. Android battery capacities are forced to be bigger to compensate for this.",2015-08-22 19:02:51+00:00,cuc1jj2,1.0,t3_3hyupl,19199.0,Android
