66,"	""Mr. Darnell Amadeus Thompson,"" the booming voice spoke, jolting the aforementioned Mr. Thompson into attention. There was a man sitting in an impossibly fancy chair in the back of the room. Deep shadows offered only a silhouette of the speaker. Candles lit by blue flames were the only reprieve to the darkness of his chambers. 
	
    ""Well this is a perplexing predicament we find ourselves in presently..."" the mysterious speaker mused.
	
    
    ""Ummm, what makes you say that?"" the boy responded.
	
    The man chuckled softly as if he was going to enjoy answering Darnell's question.
	
    ""Oh. Well, dear boy... That's because you're dead.""
	
    Darnell Thompson looked exactly like a deer in the headlights. Well, not exactly like a deer since he was a 5'11 black kid in college, but with the confusion plastered across his face, the resemblance was definitely there. A stunned check of his surroundings showed some kind of temple adorned with stone and ceramics. There was a lavish desk in front of the speaker's chair. A wooden sculpture of woman's head rested on the desktop; the artwork's beauty rivaled that of a living woman. Papyrus scrolls hung next to strange pictures of what appeared to be two co-workers in brotherly one armed hugs. 
	
    Darnell blinked twice, rubbed his eyes and looked again. Nope. He hadn't been wrong. The man on the left was definitely blue and his headlocked buddy had the face of a jackal. (Not like he was untrustworthy, mind you, but the face of the actual animal, the jackal.) As Darnell struggled to make sense of this, the speaker reached for a phonograph on the stand next to him and clicked it on. Breezy, cool jazz music issued from the archaic device. The needle hopped a little as the record spun. 
	
    ""So, my boy,"" the man spoke again. He leaned further back into the darkness of his chamber, tapping his foot to the music. ""What's the last thing you can remember?""
	
    Thoughts rushed to Darnell's head. He recalled his departure from school. Meeting his girlfriend, Katelyn at the airport and laughing at her wide-eyed astonishment. The sleepy, rural town she grew up in never really had a use for something like an airport. They had gotten on a plane headed for Cairo for a study in ancient Egyptian culture.
	
    Focusing, Darnell remembered finding his brother, Jay on the plane and losing in tic tac toe... several times. Then he dozed off watching the in-flight movie. Turbulence shook him awake and he remembered seeing Katelyn's tear-stained face one last time before everything went black... He screamed when the realization finally sunk in. 
	
    The man in the dark waited patiently as Darnell furiously patted his body. After seeing that everything was intact, Darnell, regained most of his composure and pushed his glasses up on his face.
	
    ""Ok... Ok,"" he stammered. ""I died. Okay. So, where the hell is this?""
	
    ""No, sir. Not Hell. Anubis welcomes you to the Fields of Duat. Really Osiris should be here, but that guy's always busy working the graveyard shift... That was a joke, my boy.""
	
    ""Duat?!"" Darnell blurted.
	
    ""Yes."" Anubis answered.
	
    ""Like, the Egyptian afterlife, Duat?""
	
    ""Also known as Tuat, Tuaut, Akert, Amenthes, Amenti, or Neter-kherter thanks to the Greeks and more of their ilk, but an Egyptian afterlife by any other name smells just as sweet.""
	
    ""W-what?! Really?! And you're Anubis? The Egyptian god? Really?!!"" came more stammering.
	
    The man sighed. As if the effort physically hurt him, he slid from the shadows and for the first time, the jackal-headed god's face was in full view. A crescendo from the jazz music perfectly highlighted the reveal. Darnell fell back in shock and landed flat on his ass. His lip quivered as his body reacted to the fact that there was an animal faced deity holding a conversation with him. And that he was totally dead...
	
    ""AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"" he screamed... a lot.
	
    Anubis sighed heavily. ""Oh, here we go...""
	
    ""AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"" more screaming.
	
    Anubis was patient the first time, but there was business to attend to and time was of the essence. ""Yes, yes. It's all very exciting. ""Ahhh"" and all that, but Darnell, my boy, we must discuss the Weighing---""
	
    ""AHHH! I'm dead!"" came even more of Darnell's screaming. Well, it was to be expected. He had never died once in all of his 22 years of living. Most people freaked out on their first time.
	
    ""My brother... Where's my brother?! Where's Katelyn?! KATELYNNNNN!""
	
    ""Ohhhh,"" Anubis crooned, stroking his chin. ""Katelyn was her name, hmm?That little blonde firecracker of yours with the Tennessee accent? Straight to Valhalla. She was born to be a Valkyrie, that one. Odin scooped her right up.""
	
    ""But she's alright then?"" Darnell asked. 
	
    Anubis gave him props that he didn't ask silly questions or doubt the existence of Norse mythology. Well, he had seen a jackal-headed man in a business suit sitting on a throne in a temple redesigned to be an office while frenetic jazz music played in the background... On second thought, wasn't he a little too calm. That's not something you see everyday.
	
    ""She's fine, my boy. Over at the Folkvangr Institute, she'll get the best training money can buy, but enough about her. Let's talk about your Application, dear boy.""
	
    ""My Application? What do you mean, my Application? I didn't apply anywhere, I died! I died and Anubis is talking to me about college applications... WAIT! How the hell does that work?! I don't even believe in you! I'm Baptist!"" 
	
    ""I absolutely LOVE it when this happens. You G.O.D. worshipers are so fun to educate, but there's time for that later. I simply must tell you about your Weighing of the Heart. You see, you've been applying all your life, Mr. Thompson. Your actions in life don't just decide what part of the afterlife you go to, but which Pantheon's afterlife as well! You see that's a lot of souls for just Heaven to work with so we go Dutch on the whole afterlife thing, you follow? But more on that later. What's important is that we weighed your life on the scale in accordance to Ma'at and you're worthy to go to the Fields and live happily ever afterlife, but I want to offer you a different deal. A deal that can get you out of this temple and back into the thick of things. Living things...""
	
    Darnell straightened up as his ears strained for Anubis's next words. He surprised even himself with how quickly he could adjust when the situation was explained to him. 
	
    ""A deal to go back to the living world? What's the catch?"" he inquired.
	
    ""Well, your death was no accident, my boy. Ominous forces have brought you to an unfortunate and untimely end. Ever heard of Apep? No, don't answer, the question was rhetorical. I know the kind of mythology geek you are. Anyway, he's chosen one of you humans to be a vessel for his power. And those dark powers are what brought your plane down, killed you and your girlfriend, and brought you to me.""
	
    Darnell pondered the situation. All those years of rational thinking gave way to all of the anime and comic books he had boned up on over the years. He could kinda see where this was going.
	
    ""So, you want me to help stop Apep's vessel? And in exchange, I can go back to the living world. Okay,"" Darnell started. ""How do we do that?""
	
    Anubis's jackal lips parted with an appeased smirk. He overlaid his fingers and rested his head upon them, peering out at Darnell from the flickering blue flames of his candle. 
	
    ""Apep can't be summoned into this world without a ritual of great evil being conducted first, so he has chosen a human vessel to harness his power and act in accordance with his bidding. You see, I, as a god of Egypt, would much appreciate that not taking place. However, I am busy here in Duat and can not intervene directly.""
	
    ""So what do we do about it?! I don't wanna let that jerk just get away with killing me!""
	
    Anubis's smirk widened into a devilish grin. His canine teeth shone in the light of the fire.
	
    ""That's where you come in, dear boy. A god can not intervene directly in the human world, but he can appoint and empower someone to do so in his stead. So how about it, Mr. Thompson? How would you like to be a vessel of my power? How would you like to be The avatar of Anubis?""

Always nice to see a new Tales Of fan. Get yourself a flair, bud! 

Also, u/SwordStealer did an excellent job on recommendations and console information for your next game, so I'm just going to tell you what to expect.

The Tales series ALWAYS has fast paced action. Never turn-based. The combat is one of the biggest draws to the series. And in later games, expect sometimes witty, sometimes zany or cliche skits and dialogue. They get a little trope heavy sometimes, but I've only ever played one Tales game I didn't like and that's an achievement for a franchise that's been going on as long as this one.

Just draw from referenced pictures until you become comfortable putting outfits together for yourself. There's no shame in it and even professionals need reference material.
