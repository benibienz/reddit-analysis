4,"I started out doing everything on my phone, but then the one I was using decided to break and I had to downgrade for a long while so I didn't have access to apps like Zooper or KLWP.

I doubt you actually decided to read anything about the post because this is actually a wallpaper. Plus I put together the files for Lime and Pitch using emulators way back when. And I'm going through the paces and making the themes I designed before properly functional and usable.

So there's that.

It's cute though, such criticism coming from someone whose most themes came from either just using shit off the play store, or ripping off the most basic of trends. Seriously dude, your two most successful posts were the same set up with different wallpapers. Maybe next time you wanna actually make a theme, try do something other than put numbers in boxes.

Should be super flexible and work with any wallpapers that aren't too bright - but if you like the way those walllpapers look, I've tacked those on here too.

Hello again everyone!

For those who don't remember me, I was here a while ago and posted several screens that I'd created in Photoshop. It was all fun and good til people started complaining that they weren't ""real"" themes because they didn't have any files, so I took a hiatus to get better tools, learn the ropes of KLWP and here we are with a finally fully functional version of one of the more popular themes - Nine!

---

**DESCRIPTION:**

For those who don't wanna click back, Nine was a conceptual homescreen that utilised a three by three grid to provide the full functionality that usually came with three or four screens. The boxes switch between gray and coloured depending on certain stimuli. The red boxes are a three segment bar display of the phone's battery, the blue boxes highlight depending on whether you have a missed call, message or email, and the green boxes are a three segment bar display for your music progress.

---

**FILE &amp; APPS:**

- Kustom Live Wallpaper

- Nova Launcher (Pro - but can be used without)

You can download the wallpaper [here.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/983vw24mhi86375/Nine.klwp.zip?dl=0)

---

**SETUP:**

1. Download and import the file.

2. In Nova Settings, turn off the doc.

3. Remove all icons from your main homescreen, and hey presto! Your homescreen is now fully themed.

---

This is my first ever proper Kustom theme so if there are any hardened veterans out there who can tell me what I could've done better it would be much appreciated.

I hope you all enjoy it!",2016-07-05 05:16:37+00:00,d4zo2qc,1,t3_4rb26m,1392,androidthemes

23,"I shook my head. Last night must’ve been rough; but I guess a mixture of vodka and hard hooker sex will do that to you. I loaded and got into the car, black leather still slightly chilled. I put the key in, turned the motor and started to back the car up when – 

“Fuck!”

I picked up my carry bag and started riffling through the pockets, only to find exactly what I couldn’t. I cursed again, got out of the car and headed back to the reception to ask to get my charger out of my room. After a bit of incessant arguing, they granted me five minutes into their “top class” establishment at the fair price a five dollar note.

I grumbled as I trundled back up the metal stairs. Fucking assholes. Unlocking the door, I walked in and headed over to my side of the bed, only to find nothing plugged into the plug. Huh. That’s strange. I looked in the draws for a bit, in the other plugs and – well if we’re being honest, those were the only places the charger could even be in this rundown piece of shit hotel like this. Hell, I’m 90% sure some fucker has probably wiped his ass with the wallpaper, considering how much of it is peeling off. I sat down on the edge of the bed, racking my brain hard, trying to work out where the _fuck_ I could’ve put it when I looked down at my feet. There it was. The end of the chord was jutting out from under the bed. I cringed a bit before getting onto my stomach, trying not to think about what filthy crap was probably encrusted into the fibres of this carpet. In a few seconds I had my charger in my hands, and I was back on my feet, stomach churning. What a great start to the morning. Slipping the charger into my bag, I turned to leave when I heard a voice. Sexy. Sweet.

“Hey, sweetheart. How about you come over here for a bit? I’m sure 
you’ve got enough money in that wallet of yours to pay for that missed flight. And for this, too.”

I felt goose bumps crawl down my spine, euphoria building. I turned, slowly.

I would like to just point a tiny thing out though in the future. I love the way you write this story, but at some point you wrote the lines:

&gt; ...making my way towards the woods

And follow it up with

&gt; I park my car at the edge of the woods.

Its a small thing, but perhaps instead of saying woods both times you can reword it so its got a little more diversity, vocabwise. Perhaps call it a reserve, or the edge of the woodland road or something; I don't know, this is your story, not mine.

134,"Introducing [Minedroid](http://i.imgur.com/9ZE00zC.png) - A Minecraft Themed Android Setup

___________________________________________

**A Quick Rundown of the Features:**

___________________________________________

*Lockscreen:*

- Pretty self-explanatory; just a simple button to unlock the screen.

*Dock:*

- Contains the time in the first to slots; hours in the first, minutes in the second

- Has three shortcuts in the last three slots.

- The hearts dictate battery life; every half a heart is 10% so you should have a rough estimate.

- The hunger bar dictates WiFi signal strength.

*Home:*

- ""Open Inventory"" opens up your app drawer.

- ""Settings..."" opens up settings.

- ""Texture Packs"" opens up your wallpaper settings; use that to change the wallpaper

- ""Save &amp; Quit"" locks your phone

*Music*:

- The top button is the play/pause button with the next and previous song buttons on either side.

- The top small button is the song name

- The middle small button is the band name

- The last small button is the album name

- Tapping on any of these buttons opens up your music app, and so does tapping on the jukebox.

______________________________________

**Inspiration**:
______________________________________

If it wasn't clear enough, it is inspired by the game Minecraft, made by Mojang, which is an open-world sandbox game completely based around creative liberty in the shape of cubes.

_____________________________________

**Resources:**

- Nova Launcher

- Zooper Widget

- AC Display

- Minecraftia Font

- Compaticons by tatosXL

- Photoshop (for the button textures).

But I found the logo seemed *too* empty so I filled the space with various simple patterns and settled on the lines. I kinda realised at that point that the full sized logo was too detailed for smaller print, so I worked on smaller iterations. Then I added the dots as a small detail to tie all three logos together.

For those confused as to how this would work, the grids left and right rows would be made of progress bars. Those progress bars would show a certain data set; Left shows battery, right shows Track Progress. The center however, would have squares that light up when you have a notification. That way you will constantly have an adapting grid and an interesting homescreen!

Oh, and don't worry about the size; you can make it as large or as small as you want. I just like the excessive whitespace.

This was made with:

- Zooper Widget

- Media Utilities

- Nova Launcher

- Widget Locker

- Photoshop

Before you start throwing tomatoes, I made it in Zooper because more people would be able to use it. Kustom only really works for KitKat, which I do not have.

___________________________________________

**SET UP:**

_______________________________________________

*Homescreen*

1. Nova Desktop Grid should be 7x10.

2. Turn off the notification bar and navigation bar, if you can.

3. Set your Desktop Transition to ""Wipe"".

4. Set Media Utilities to send information to Zooper if you haven't already, and check ""Blank MetaData when Paused""

4. Dump all shortcuts you have in the trash, and create three clean pages.

5. Create one 7x6 Zooper Widget in the center of each page.

6. Load ""clock"" in the center, ""music"" to the left and ""notifications"" to the right.

7. Go through and set each widgets ""On-Tap Action"" to ""Disabled""

________________________________________________________________

*Lockscreen*

1. WidgetLocker should be set up without an Anchor Size and with a 7x10 maingrid

2. Put a 7x6 Zooper Widget in the center.

3. Load up ""unlock"".

4. Long press on the widget and disable touches.

5. Long press and add a custom slider (use the default).

6. Position it in the center, so that the center of lock is over the widget.

7. Go into the customisation options and disable the left and right sliders.

8. Tap in the center and set its action to ""Unlock"".

9. Go into ""icon"" and hit ""file"" and search for the image in the folder called ""Empty"".
