Yeah, that’s kinda what this felt like. I stared at my finger, or more accurately the toothpick underneath my fingernail. About half of it had been hammered in. There didn’t seem to be blood, surprisingly. Just the slightly hazy visage of a thin piece of wood, just beneath my fingernail. It seemed to touch the very other side. Where that weird white curve is at the base of every nail. You know what I'm talking about.

I looked closer and the nail seemed to be elevated a bit. I tenderly touched it but every movement seemed to amplify the pain tenfold. I decided it would be for the best if I just did it in one shot. You know, like ripping off a plaster.

Three.

Two.

One.

Oh, there’s the blood. My finger was dripping, and I looked to my other hand to see- what? I wasn’t holding the toothpick. Nope, it was still in there, though it seemed to have slid out about a quarter of the way. It was pretty solidly wedged. 

I tried again, only to have my finger scream with pain. There was no real way to describe it aside from. Well. _Fuck._
I decided to try one last time. It was still about halfway in there but I decided that maybe, since it was further out I could get a better grip.

Three.

Two.

One.

I yanked. The toothpick came out a bit more but I wasn’t about to fucking give up there. I yanked again, this time determined to get this piece of shit out of my finger. I start jiggling it a bit. I could practically hear my body screeching at me to stop but I didn’t. I kept pulling and moving and jiggling and trying, a small pool of blood growing on the floor as it came dribbling out. It was like someone had tried to turn off the tap but hadn’t really quite got the job done.

I felt the toothpick move a bit more. It was slightly liberated, loosening more and more with each excruciating twist. I was nearly there. Blinded by tears I stopped, breathed in, and aimlessly yanked.

_POP._

I looked to see the toothpick lathered with blood, but in my other hand. Out of my body. Fucking finally.

There was a lot of blood for such a small wound. I glanced to the floor to see the nail, some skin attached to the back, floating in the puddle like a tiny keratin raft. I sighed. That’s unfortunate. 
But no matter, I had bigger things to have to deal with.

I looked down to my hands again. 9 more to go.

Here's a long ass modpost about CSS. I sincerely apologise in advance.

What's this? Consistent posting by Mr_Halloween? A shorter than two century gap between his posts? Madness, I say!

Anyways, if you guys didn't already know I'm the one fucking around with the CSS (the way the subreddit looks for those who don't know what it is). Thing is though, I'm a perfectionist. And I fucking royally hate that I can't seem to get the theme of SSS to perfection because my CSS skills are unfortunately, not that refined, plus I don't exactly have the time. Plus, the bullshit that is RES always fucks me over.

Yay.

Pardon my French.

I've come to the conclusion that the only way I can do this perfectly is if I start building off an already made theme. I have, after endless internal arguing, decided against the use of Naut simply because I didn't want to make SSS ""just another subreddit."" If that makes sense. Fact of the matter is, Naut (see /r/Naut) is really pretty, yes, but shitloads of subreddits use it. I instead feel that perhaps the theme STCKY (see /r/STCKY) is a better choice. However, I did want to ask the community a few questions.

1. Do you guys even want this changed? I know the current theme has its issues but if you guys are opposed to another major CSS change then I completely understand.

2. If yes, you're okay with change, would you guys prefer to see the theme move closer to the original CSS (see /r/ShortScaryStoriesOOC) or stay looking like the current one?

3. Do you guys think /r/STCKY is a good choice or not? Bear in mind I will be *heavily* editing it to make it more SSSy, but the general overall layout will remain the same. If not, what other suggestions do you have? Does it matter all that much that the CSS wouldn't have been built from the ground up?

4. Are there any CSS features you guys would like added? I've heard word from /u/EtTuTortilla that there is a CSS word counter being used at /r/NoSleep that I would love to try implement here.

5. Would you want to see the OOC themed as well for sake of subreddit continuity, or would you prefer to leave it where it is for a little nostalgic hit whenever you visit it?

That's all the question I have for you lovely and eloquent hellspawn, and for those of you who made it down here, thank you for reading this much useless text.

I hope you all have a wonderful day c:

I saw it. Him. Something.

There’s a street leading from one of the avenues by my place that runs straight from there, through the housing to one of the gates into the complex. There’s a lone street-light at the end of that street. 

And that’s where it – he - was.

Black skin. I literally mean his skin was jet black. The tones of reflected light shone off grey. Standing, like a man, but his chest was strangely protruded, making his arms push back to his sides like he was poorly imitating a chicken. Knees slightly bent. But his face got me. A plastered smile, and eyes like perfect globes; just a pristine white that cut into a black. Almost cartoonish. Eyes that were fixed on me.

But no, he couldn't; I'm standing in the dark, he couldn't see me. How could he? I'm way too far away; three stories up on a shadowy terrace. I tried to dismiss it as just me being uneasy, which I sure as hell was. It worked for a bit, up until he got on all fours and started galloping.

His arms wind-milled by his sides, stretching out in front of him and seemingly grabbing the ground before throwing his whole body forward with the assistance of his legs. Huge bounds sent him rocketing forward before he leaped over the two meter high fence with ease. Even from here, I could hear the clicking and shifting of bones and wet slapping of flesh on concrete every time he hit the ground. There was a slight rasping too. Heavy and hard. His eyes never left mine. It seemed like no matter where he went, he went without fear. His motions perfectly rehearsed. He charged forward without hesitation, a falsified gleam of glee in his eyes. He slowed after landing, his body contorting slightly to shuffle his body along the ground. Reaching the wall, his neck was now cocked back at an almost 180 degree, brilliant smile directed at me.

He stood.

It began lifting its body up, still facing me. Its head began to twitch. Its palms remained flat up against the wall as it began to pad its way up. Its feet lifted off the ground until it was just attached to the wall. After a moments pause, it bolted, limbs flailing as he scampered up. I threw myself back, tumbling over the window sill as the clicking and popping grew louder. I shut the window with a loud slam, turning the lock a second later. I pushed myself to the opposite side of the room. Watching, petrified, a black arm wrapped itself around the top of the railing, followed by the other, slowly followed by the top of a bald head, white eyes and a crescent moon smile. He just stood there. Watching. It was silent until the sound of shattering glass filled the air.

We stared at each other for most of the night.

I have an announcement to make.

I'm finally starting to have ideas again. And one of them consisted of using another site outside of reddit to start up a series I've been planning for a little while now. It's called ""The Diary of Steven Freidman"" (the name is a work in progress). It'll be a series of incredibly short (in the spirit of SSS, under 500 words) entries that I'll be posting biweekly following the tale of a semi-depressed boy who has recently moved into a new house and starts hearing some strange shit. Yes I know, it sounds cliche as fuck but please, every story needs a set up. Have faith.

I would like to add that I am in no way a criminal investigator. Hell, I'm still in high school. So I'm trying to do as much research as I can but there is most likely going to be some factual mistakes in how things work.

Anyways, let me know what you guys think.

I’ve got 2,700 characters to get this right, so no fluff.

When the disease first started spreading, we didn’t know what to do. Judging by its behaviour, it was neurological virus, we knew that, but it was difficult to establish anything because the virus worked quick; entering and killing the host and completely evacuating the cadaver. All in seconds. Hence, it was near impossible to get a sample to examine since we couldn’t exactly get our hands on the infected, and the infected dead were no longer infected.

The religious nuts believed it was revenge. All the sinners in the world paying the price. You can’t blame them though. Watching a man twist his own head off his shoulders is somewhat terrifying, and without any real scientific evidence to make sense of it, it just came down to “the Lord’s great plan.” I guess the fact that people are tearing off their own limbs can’t exactly be explained away with “They just felt like it.” Especially when their screaming at the top of their lungs for it to stop.

It has some real, hard shock value though. When it first hit, it was being broadcast live. American Idol, if you can believe it. One minute, a suave-eyed man was singing away on stage and the next, he was twisting his leg counter-clockwise ‘til it was clean off.  The cameras changed to the audience, who were all squirming fountains of blood at this point. Screaming and gurgled cries for help filled the room. There were some who were sitting there with their nails skewering their eyeballs, others with their fingers two knuckles deep into their tracheas. And it only escalated from there.

No-one knows what to do. All the major cities have been either evacuated or annihilated. The body count is too high to bother counting anymore. Corpses on the street are commonplace now. There are about 20 of us left at this site, if I had to guess.

As for me? I’m the only one who didn’t get affected. The antidote, per say. They found me amongst the carnage of a theme park, curled into a ball crying. I still remember the way the blood smelt when it mixed with my tears. Scientists pulled me to the side because they wanted to find more like me, but they haven’t. And now we’ve completely lost radio contact with the rest of the world. It’s just us, as far as we know, but all its going to take is a little gust of wind and then poof. That’s the rest of humanity gone too.

I don’t know why I’m writing this. There’s literally no one here to read this. But they asked me to. There’s something about the prospect of being forgotten that terrifies us all. So we’re leaving a record, and then taking care of this. No virus needed. We can’t take it anymore. We’re done.

We exist. Or existed. We were real.

We are humans.

Remember us.

This is because reddit detects something (and I'm not too sure what) and turns the text into a codeblock, which is coded strangely in the CSS. Apologies on my part.

If this ever happens to you a quick and easy fix is to take your story and copy it into Notepad (for Windows users) or TextEdit (for Mac users), and then copy the story from there into the submission box and work out any other formatting from there. Sometimes the word processor you use applies some strange formatting to the text when copied. Use Notepad or TextEdit to eliminate said formatting.

I sat up, sweating. I could feel it. There was a slight pressure in my left eye, and I didn’t know what it was. All I knew was that that…*noise* had woken me up 5 times tonight. But this time I knew for a fact where it was coming from. 

I got up. The overhanging sense of drowsiness brought about from waking up at four in the morning had passed a few seconds ago. I dawdled to the bathroom across the icy floorboards. After turning on the light, I headed to the mirror. It felt so strange. Like it was *in* my eye, but not, well, *in* my eye. Like it was behind it.

*SQUELCH.*

There is was again! My left eye seemed to move forward a few millimetres. After closer examination, I realised that my left eye was actually somewhat swollen. But it wasn’t red or anything; just swollen. Like it was considerably larger. The pressure in my eye kept building. Christ, if I don’t get to a hospital soon-

*SQUELCH.*

*POP.*

*""SWEET MERCIFUL JESUS!""*

I found myself simultaneously staring at both the sink and the mirror. I couldn’t cover up my left eye, but in the spliced image of my reflection I could see it dangling over the basin. Something was worming around in my socket but in my panic I couldn’t focus on it. I just watched it slip back in through a hole and into darkness. Oh God. 

I couldn’t control my breathing anymore. Adrenaline started coursing through my veins. I was starting to see stars out of my left eye, so after washing my hands in the sink I reached down and elevated my eyeball to try alleviate the pressure on the optic nerve. Grabbing my eyeball, however, still seemed to hurt like a bitch. I kept my grasp light, turning out of the bathroom to try find the phone. I needed help, now.

In my agitation I didn’t think to turn on the light. I stumbled into the living space, feeling my way to the kitchen where the phone was. But as I proceeded into the pitch darkness, I stubbed my toe on the dining room table. As my world tipped, I instinctively reached out to stop my fall with both hands. With a sickening squidge, I felt (and heard) my eyeball splatter across the floor tiles and my optic nerve rip out of my head. My senses were screaming. I’d never felt so much pain. Panic and fear overcame me. What was happening? Why the fuck was it happening to me? 

I paused. 

There was dead silence, aside from my heavy, agitated breathing. I felt pressure building behind my right eye.

*SQUELCH.*

Oh fuck.

To be honest, ""stumbled"" is a loose term. He had seen his friends go in before, but never had he tried stepping foot inside himself. His parents had taught him to do anything but. However, at the ripe age of 8, they allowed him inside.

As he entered, he found himself flooded with new sensations, and incredible sites ^ (haha) and sounds. He spent months, *years*, playing games with friends, working his way through different places and challenges. The sensation he had once had left him, but not for long. He found himself looking down the path that none of his friends had really looked at before. It was shadowed, dark. Carved into the tree was;

""The Land of CreepyPasta"".

Hal, with nothing better to do, walked in.  He was confronted by terrifying faces, smooth voices and horrifying thoughts. He ran out at the first story. He felt terrified. But, in the end, he came to realize that, deep down inside, this was what he was waiting for. Fear. He was tired of being locked up in his parents' embrace. So secretly, every night, Hal would walk the path to the same shaded woods, and slowly expose himself to new and more intense stories. Slowly, he desensitized himself, but he craved *more*. He went deeper and deeper, until he finally felt satisfied. But in all his exploration and understanding, he had worked up his own passion. He wanted to make some stories of his own. He had come to the understanding that the stories weren't really true, but they were elegant and woven lies. He wanted to try his hand.

Hal walked home and wrote up his first story with haste. He didn't check it, didn't edit it; he just ran right back in and showed it to the first people he could. They looked at him and laughed.

""This? This is garbage! You'll never make it, pipsqueak.""

He felt crushed. But, stubborn as he was, he ran back and wrote another. And another. He slowly began to refine his processes, until he himself was happy with the story itself. But, never let an old flame burn you twice, as they say. So Hal left the Land of CreepyPasta, and ventured elsewhere.

After months of search, Hal came across another place. A shaded garden within the dark woods. Having pressed past all the bad, he walked in, looking for something to tell him where he was. He found a small name. It sat on a tiny sign.

""Short Scary Stories"".

It was quieter here. Less intense, but somehow the absence made the place more chilling. He liked that. Bracing himself, he passed his first story up and it was pinned to the board. It was dubbed ""Abnormal"". After an hour or two of waiting, someone came by and made a comment.

""So sad :&lt;""

By a strange man with a strange name, named /u/Kerrima. He pondered if that was good or bad, so Hal pressed with another question. But, as another hour passed, more comments arrived, and he came to realise people actually *liked* what he had written. So he wrote another, and put it on the pinboard. He found that people would give him feedback if he did wrong, and he worked with that. He made himself better. He also noticed other stories on the board, so he read through those when he could, giving advice and congratulations where he felt was necessary, because he knew what it was like to be simply put down.

Hal racked up quite the amount of stories. He met incredible people, such as /u/NobleCeltic, /u/VincentVenaCava, /u/QueenOfScots, /u/lordcarnage, /u/AngelusInferni, /u/KMilliron, /u/Mx-yz-pt-lk and countless others. They helped him out far beyond anyone could've ever had hoped. And he is forever grateful for having met such wonderful, dark souls.

Some of his friends disappeared, but he still held on to those strong friendships as best he could (/u/HonestRage, I'm looking at you; as much as we didn't talk, I still really miss your stories dude).

He found, however, that over time his ideas were flat and running thin, so he took a step back and sat in the sidelines. He watched how Short Scary Stories slowly grew and changed and watched a new flood of writers come in. Being a semi-decent redecorator, he tried putting together a half decent new look for the place. Something that might be spookier. After a year and a half, he wanted to try give something back to the community he so loved.

Now, he's been given another chance from the leaders of this wonderful place to once again put back into the community. A few days ago, Hal got a letter, inviting him to join the ranks of the Moderators. Hal accepted with gratitude.

And here we are now.

_______________________________________

For those of you who didn't read all that, I recently got made a mod. A proper, fully-fledged mod. And I cannot thank you guys enough. You have all made me into such a better person, and pulled me out of my own personal gutter. I owe you all so much.

For those of you don't know me, hi, I'm /u/Mr_Halloween, and I'm a new mod! I'm a (self-proclaimed) designer/writer, and I've been around since 2012. I used to write, a LOT, but then my creative flair kind of died down. I post here and there, but in this new flood of people I'm just another face in the crowd. A month or so ago I redid the CSS around here, so if you have any questions or suggestions, lemme know!

In all honesty, I was kinda worried I might become something close to an SSS relic, but alas, the mods have given me another shot at being part of the community, this time, via background work!

For here on out, I'll be here to help you. Again, any questions or queries, regarding either the design of the sub or feedback for a story, or just to talk, let me know or message the moderators and we'll all see it there.

Thank you all so much, and I hope to hear from you all soon!

_______________________________________________________________________

This was made with:

- Zooper Widget

- Media Utilities

- Nova Launcher

- Widget Locker &amp; Ac Display

- Photoshop

Let's get cracking.

_____________________________________________________________________

**SET UP:**

______________________________________________________________________

*Before You Start:*

1. Unzip the folder you have downloaded from the link above.

2. Take the Zooper Widgets from this folder and place them into your templates folder (usually found in 
/sdcard/ZooperWidget/Templates)

_____________________________________________________________________

*Homescreen:*

1. Nova Desktop Grid should be 7x10.

2. Turn off the notification bar and navigation bar, if you can.

3. Set your Desktop Transition to ""Wipe"".

4. Set Media Utilities to send information to Zooper if you haven't already, and check ""Blank MetaData when 
Paused"". Also, make sure you have ""Send Track Progress"" ticked under ""Experimental Settings"".

5. Dump all shortcuts you on your homescreen in the trash, and create three clean pages.

6. Create one 7x6 Zooper Widget in the center of each page. NOTE: To create a 7x6 widget, just drag and drop the any sized Zooper Widget onto your page, then drag the edges out until the widget takes up a 7x6 area. Do this before you load in the widget. The end result should cover the width of the page, and leave two rows on the top and bottom of it.

7. Load ""Home"" in the center, ""Music"" to the left and ""Notifications"" to the right.

8. Go through and set each widgets ""On-Tap Action"" to ""Disabled"".

9. Set your wallpaper to the one included. I have added one that isn't completely black for non-AMOLED screens, 
simply because I prefer the way that looks over straight black. But for those of you who have AMOLED screens, 
feel free to use the pure black one.

__________________________________________________________________

*Lockscreen:*

FOR WIDGET LOCKER USERS:

1. WidgetLocker should be set up without an Anchor Size and with a 7x10 maingrid

2. Put a 7x6 Zooper Widget in the center.

3. Load up ""Lock"".

4. Long press on the widget and disable touches.

5. Long press and add a custom slider (use the default).

6. Position it in the center, so that the center of lock is over the widget.

7. Go into the customisation options and disable the left and right sliders.

8. Tap in the center and set its action to ""Unlock"".

9. Go into ""icon"" and hit ""file"" and search for the image in the folder called ""Empty"" (if you don't have this, download 
LIME and use the ""Empty"" image from there).

FOR AC DISPLAY USERS

1. Open up AcDisplay and go to Settings/Interface/Widget and activate the custom widget by hitting the blue button. 

2. Load up a 7x2 Zooper Widget, and set the width and height slider to max.

3. Hit the menu button and activate the ""Touchable"" option.

4. Touch the Zooper Widget and load up ""Lock""

5. Hit the menu button and deactivate the ""Touchable"" option.

NOTE: If you are going to use AcDisplay, which I highly recommend, I would also recommend that you shift all 
your desktop widgets up on row (so that instead of two rows on top of the widget and two rows below it, there is 
one row on top of the widget and three rows below it). This is because AcDisplay does not perfectly center the 
widget you place in it, however moving the widgets up a row will line those up with the AcDisplay one, making 
everything slightly neater and tidier.

_____________________________________________________________

And you're done! But you want more-

_____________________________________________________________

*Drawer:*

1. Install [""Min""](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ryanmkelly.me.min&amp;hl=en) or [""Tiny Whites""](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samanthaconner.tinywhite&amp;hl=en). I would recommend the latter.

2. Set your Drawer Color to White

3. Remove labels from under the icons

4. Set the Tab Style to Classic

_____________________________________________________________

FINAL NOTES:

If you guys have any issues with the bitmap size, make sure ALL of the ""Scale"" settings in both the Widget and 
the bitmaps are all set to ""100"". That way it ensures they are all in the original and intended size. I had this issue 
when moving from my emulator to my shit phone, and that's what fixed it. Also, the music player is a bit buggy; 
still working on it.

EDIT: It also appears that I forgot to add a Module On-Tap option to the Next Track and Previous Track buttons. In case you are wondering why those aren't working. Sorry about that.

Before you start throwing tomatoes, I made it in Zooper because more people would be able to use it. Kustom only really works for KitKat, which I do not have.

And your done! Enjoy your new homescreen! But if you want MORE

______________________________________

**TAKING IT FURTHER**

________________________________________
""Further?"" I hear you say. Yes, further.


1. Install Glyphs by Tokem (its an icon pack) from inside the folder of things you downloaded. If that isn't your style or there aren't enough icons for you, I recommend using Min.

2. Set your Drawer Color to: #9EEC22

3. Remove any background color in the drawer.

4. Set your Drawer Style to ""Vertical"".

Bam! Now your Drawer fits your homescreen!
