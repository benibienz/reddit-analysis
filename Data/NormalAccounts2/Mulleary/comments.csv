Thank you for your recent submission but it has been removed because it did not contain the proper title format for this subreddit.


Can I suggest that you resubmit using the title [The Hero of Time (2009) [480p]](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1808555/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) and all will be well.

127,"Greetings /u/Warhawk2052. Unfortunately your submission has been removed from /r/fullmoviesonyoutube because our rules do not allow:


* Rule 10: **If the movie is slowed down or altered in any way, an additional [ALTERED] tag is required.**


In this case the movie was sped up when uploaded to YouTube.

In this case it would appear that the movie was sped up when uploaded to YouTube and your submission should have contained the word [ALTERED] at the end of the title. Any description of the alteration or possible fixes in the comments would be welcomed.

I've started watching this movie for the first time and it really looks like I missed a gem in 2006 so please resubmit using the correctly formatted title and all will be well, i.e. Stranger than Fiction (2006) [720p] [ALTERED].
