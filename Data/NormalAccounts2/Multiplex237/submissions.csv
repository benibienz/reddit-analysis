Fallout 4, skyrim, other steam games

What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

$400-$600

When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.

Within the month

What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)

Tower

Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?

US, Louisiana. No microcenter

If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.

Mouse keyboard and monitor

Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

No OC planned

Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)

Not really anything special needed.

Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?

No prefrences

Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?
