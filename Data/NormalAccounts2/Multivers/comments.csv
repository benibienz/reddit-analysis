6,"Thanks for the reply. The thing is any statement about canon is hearsay and differing opinions - there hasn't been an official canon policy for Trek for years now, and even when it existed it was vague and changeable. Gene had his own opinion about canon regarding TAS, but he wasn't really involved in actually making it so he's coming at it from a certain perspective. The thing is Gene's idea of what was or wasn't canon was just one person's opinion and it changed a lot. Towards the end of his life he also didn't think elements of TOS or the movies were canon either, according to Paula Block (Viacom Director of Licensed Publishing):

&gt;Gene R. himself had a habit of decanonizing things. He didn't like the way the animated series turned out, so he proclaimed that it was not canon. He also didn't like a lot of the movies. So he didn't much consider them canon either. And ‚Äì okay, I'm really going to scare you with this one ‚Äì after he got TNG going, he... well... he sort of decided that some of The Original Series wasn't canon either. I had a discussion with him once, where I cited a couple things that were very clearly canon in The Original Series, and he told me he didn't think that way anymore, and that he now thought of TNG as canon wherever there was conflict between the two. He admitted it was revisionist thinking, but so be it.

DC Fontana and Dave Gerrold considered all of it proper Trek, and they actually worked on the show, so personally I'd go with their opinion over Gene's.

Fontana:
&gt;I suppose ""canon"" means what Gene Roddenberry decided it was. Remember, we were making it up as we went along on the original series (and on the animated one, too)... So the so-called canon evolved in its own way and its own time. For whatever reason, Gene Roddenberry apparently didn‚Äôt take the animated series seriously (no pun intended), although we worked very hard to do original STAR TREK stories and concepts at all times in the animated series.

Gerrold:
&gt;Arguments about ""canon"" are silly. I always felt that Star Trek Animated was part of Star Trek because Gene Roddenberry accepted the paycheck for it and put his name on the credits. And DC Fontana‚Äîand all the other writers involved‚Äîbusted their butts to make it the best Star Trek they could.

Sorry, didn't mean to write that much but it bugs me when people bring up canonicity as if it's set in stone. It's a lot more fuzzy than people realize. Although like you said, Yesteryear is a good episode, and ultimately that's all that should really matter, canon or no.",2015-12-20 22:32:18+00:00,cy5xd1i,4,t1_cy5wkng,1279,startrek

43,"Thanks for the reply. I disagree that's the only reasonable explanation. Here's the whole exchange in context:

&gt;KIRK: There won't be a next engagement. By the time we've gathered, it'll be too late. But you say he's from the future, knows what's going to happen, then the logical thing is to be unpredictable.

&gt;SPOCK: You are assuming that Nero knows how events are predicted to unfold. To the contrary, Nero's very presence has altered the flow of history, beginning with the attack on the USS Kelvin, culminating in the events of today, thereby creating an entire new chain of incidents that cannot be anticipated by either party.

&gt;UHURA: An alternate reality?

&gt;SPOCK: Precisely. Whatever our lives might have been, if the time continuum was disrupted, our destinies have changed.

Spock is not saying ""don't worry nerds, the old timeline is still around"". He's saying ""forget everything you think you knew about Trek, because it's all changed"".

Now you and I both know what's going on. We knew the makers of the film didn't want to make Trekkies angry by changing everything. But for casual fans who weren't following the production of the film all the way it's totally reasonable for them to interpret this exchange as meaning the old Trek is dead and gone, especially if they were already wary of a reboot film to begin with. I've met at least two people who thought that's what the film was saying. ",2015-11-08 12:34:24+00:00,cwsstar,6,t1_cwsjpcg,30147,startrek

Personally I loved the 2009 movie but I'm not sure this is fair. Where in the movie (not the comics, or promotional material, but the movie itself) does it actually say that the original timeline still exists? Correct me if I'm wrong but the closest I can think of is the use of the term ""alternate reality,"" which can be interpreted a number of different ways. In fact I don't remember time travel ever being depicted that way in previous Trek. Remember in First Contact, before the Enterprise E goes through the time vortex thing, they see an assimilated Earth? Seems like time travel always used to change the future rather than creating new timelines. I think casual fans who don't follow all the ancillary material can be forgiven for thinking that it works the same way in the reboot movie.",2015-11-07 19:46:01+00:00,cws2ob5,4,t1_cwr8uyc,73204,startrek

51,"I know what you're trying to say, but I think your analysis of the word as being a derivation is different from many English speakers. I would argue most people would not analyse the word as simply being *Rome* + *-an* but instead as a single word, with a fossilized ending. The adjective *Roman* (*Romain*) was borrowed into English from French with a very specific meaning, referring to the Empire and related concepts. Sure, the word is also used to mean ""of the (modern) city of Rome"", but that usage is very much distinct and I think many English speakers would find it strange, if only because it's comparatively more rarely encountered.

Basically when we use the word *Roman* we are almost always talking about the ancient empire that spoke Latin and conquered Gaul, and its impact on European culture (in art, religion, etc.). This is a distinct meaning with many more connotations than simply ""of the city of Rome"". This is what the adjective Roman means in the phrase *Roman characters*. It means ""Latin characters"", not ""characters of the city of Rome"". Etymologically the words *Rome* and *Roman* are obviously related, as any literate speaker would notice, but that knowledge is distinct from analysing it as a case of productive derivation in the modern language.

Is this analysis of the word as a single morpheme universal to English speakers? Almost certainly not, as your own analysis shows (assuming you are a native English speaker). But it is common enough that many English speakers, when encountering the Japanese form *romaji*, make an error and insert that extra /n/ that they assume has gone missing from the Japanese borrowing.

So maybe this is a kind of self fulfilling prophecy thing. One single conspiracy kook arbitrarily decided that CERN was going to open a portal to Hell or some such nonsense on September 23rd 2015. Then other sites picked up on this theory and it spread.

108,"I think Shinichi Shimomura (director of Dream Land 2, 3 and 64) had a somewhat different idea on what Kirby gameplay and aesthetics should be compared to Sakurai. His games are slower paced, simpler, have a more consistent cutesy aesthetic and less wacky crazy stuff (until you get to the end boss, of course). It feels like Dream Land 3 is the purest expression of that ideal.

Personally I love it as a continuation of the Dream Land 2 style of gameplay and for the art, which is some of the best stuff that was ever put out on the SNES. Unfortunately it really does suffer because it will always be compared to Super Star, and it can't help but look the worse of the two in that comparison because Super Star is just so good.

While writing this post I looked up Shinichi Shimomura to find out what ever happened to him.

120,"Although, as other posters have pointed out, Russian and English are related, when talking about borrowing words it's more helpful to think in terms of how closely speech communities interacted rather than the origins of the languages.

In the case of Russian, the language borrowed words from Greek in the medieval era due to the religious and cultural ties between Byzantium and the Kievan Rus'. During the 18th century a lot of vocabulary from other European languages, particularly French, also entered the language. I don't know the etymology for sure but I'd imagine this later period is when the Latinate term –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∞ (culture) first shows up.

By the way, the word culture didn't start acquiring its modern meaning until the 18th century. Before that it had an agricultural meaning only, meaning to cultivate or till land. You still see this sense of the word in contexts like ""microbial culture"". This is total speculation on my part but I'd guess that the contemporary idea of culture is an invention of the Enlightenment era, so it makes sense that Russian would borrow the word rather than already have a word for it. This might just be /r/badphilosophy though.

As for –§–∞—à–∏–∑–º (Fascism) this is presumably a much more recent borrowing from Italian, just like the English word Fascism.",2015-08-07 21:02:24+00:00,ctv8pgz,4,t1_ctv25mu,9788,badlinguistics

&gt;The original ending filmed was cut from the episode. (Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion 2nd ed., pp. 68-69) [Maurice]Hurley recalled, ""In that ending, Picard knew how to defeat Moriarty. He tricked him. He knew all along that Moriarty could leave the holodeck whenever he wanted to, and he knew because when Data came out and showed him a drawing of the Enterprise, if that piece of paper could leave the holodeck, that means that the fail-safe had broken down. In turn, this means that the matter-energy converter which creates the holodeck, now allowed the matter to leave the holodeck, which was, up to that point, impossible. When he knew that paper had left the holodeck, he knew that Moriarty could as well, so he lied to him."" (Captains' Logs: The Unauthorized Complete Trek Voyages, p. 174)

&gt;This ending was removed by Gene Roddenberry, who claimed that it hurt Picard's character by making him look deceitful. Hurley disagreed, noting, ""I thought it made him look clever, and since you are dealing with maybe the most profound criminal mind in literature, you've got to be careful.""

144,"I was thinking about this too lately, and I had a few theories:

At first I thought maybe it's because Voyager is an agent noun. The -er ending indicates agency which might make it much easier for us to interpret the word Voyager as a proper name rather than a description, and proper names generally don't take articles in English. But ""The Stargazer"" sounds fine to me so I'm not so sure that works.

It might instead be because of the setting. When characters talk about Voyager they're not just talking about a ship, they're talking about a self-sufficient community, a group of people bound by a common goal. Dropping the article makes it sound more intimate, like Voyager itself is a character in the show.

Another theory is that it's simply from the name of the show. We don't call the TV show ""The Voyager"", we just call it ""Voyager"". So it's only natural we transfer that usage over to the ship itself. This also explains the usage on Enterprise. On that show they also dropped the article early on in season one, despite earlier Enterprises always having ""The"".",2015-07-13 03:06:44+00:00,ct1bwik,1,t3_3d2prf,6033,startrek

The Bajorans are probably the closest analogue to the Jewish people. Their religion is based on a series of prophetic revelations and they are, in a sense, the chosen people of their gods, the Prophets.

163,"As far as I know there isn't actually any current official policy on what is or isn't canon in Trek. The most recent official statement on canon was this pretty vague piece that used to appear on StarTrek.com:

&gt;As a rule of thumb, the events that take place within the live-action episodes and movies are canon, or official Star Trek facts. Story lines, characters, events, stardates, etc. that take place within the fictional novels, video games, the Animated Series, and the various comic lines have traditionally not been considered part of the canon. But canon is not something set in stone; even events in some of the movies have been called into question as to whether they should be considered canon! Ultimately, the fans, the writers and the producers may all differ on what is considered canon and the very idea of what is canon has become more fluid, especially as there isn't a single voice or arbiter to decide. Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry was accustomed to making statements about canon, but even he was known to change his mind.

&gt;In the publishing world, there used to be two exceptions to the novel rule: the Jeri Taylor-penned books 'Mosaic' and 'Pathways.' Many of the events in these two novels feature background details of the main Star Trek: Voyager characters and were to be considered as references by writers on the show. Now that the show is over, some of those events may never be incorporated into a live action format, so the question of whether details from these novels remain canon is open to interpretation.

&gt;With regard to the Animated Series, there are a few details from the episode 'Yesteryear,' written by D.C. Fontana, that reveal biographical background on Spock and planet Vulcan. Details from this episode have been successfully incorporated into the canon of Star Trek (such as in 'The Forge') and now that the Animated Series is out on DVD, we hope that even more can make its way in!

This statement was taken down when the site was redesigned in 2010 and since then there hasn't been any official policy set out by either Paramount or CBS. Personally I say TAS is canon because it's fun and I like it, and a lot of people from TOS were involved in making it.",2015-07-03 03:54:14+00:00,csqnr1b,1,t3_3bxcox,18264,startrek
