I'm curious about how these systems work/worked in practice. Specifically, what happens if someone is born to a mother and father who are in a forbidden relationship? Presumably the mother and father would be ostracized due to engaging in an incestuous/taboo relationship. But what about the child? Would they have some kind of permanent outcast/bastard status by virtue of their birth, or could they retroactively be assigned to a group? Are there any recorded cases of how traditional Aboriginal societies deal with or dealt with this problem? Or is it so taboo as to be unheard of?",AskAnthropology,Australian Aboriginal kinship and forbidden relationships,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/3gvjfv/australian_aboriginal_kinship_and_forbidden/

I'm not talking about armchair conspiracy theory stuff about secret Nazi bases or people over analysing google earth pics. That crap is all too easy to find on the internet. I'm talking about unexplained things that actually happened in Antarctica and were experienced by people who live and work there. I know about Rodney Marks, the guy who died of methanol poisoning in 2000 at the Pole but I can't find any other examples. Even weird but completely explained phenomena like the Blood Falls would be cool to hear about.

As a disclaimer: I don't really believe in aliens or ghosts or any of this stuff, but I enjoy fun spooky stories!",antarctica,Mysteries of Antarctica,http://www.reddit.com/r/antarctica/comments/3d4opb/mysteries_of_antarctica/
