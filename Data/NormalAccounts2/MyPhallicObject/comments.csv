1,"&gt;  When we trivialize these occurences, we ignore the injustices that were commited during Martial Law.

Nonsense.

Human rights were violated in the Martial Law, that was tragic. It doesn't take a Martial Law for people to realize people dying is terrible, but we've seen it, and it's real.

This burial event here has been controversial because, at least so far I've heard, people are suddenly going to think highly of the Marcoses now. And frankly it doesn't matter what people think of them. What matters is the PH Protects the human rights and that martial law doesn't happen again. The image of the Marcoses are irrelevant.

And speaking of human rights, are there not other rights we have to look into? Maybe women rights with abortion? LGBTQ+ equality? 

It's time to direct our attention from thinking about the image of the Marcoses and into the minorities and the *actual* injustice today.",2016-11-18 16:06:35+00:00,da5rv8s,7.0,t1_da5rm8z,329.0,Philippines

#To anyone else looking for a helpful answer to the question, here it is:

There is a way for one programming language to communicate with another, it is called a [Web Service](http://www.javatpoint.com/web-services-tutorial).  In other words, web service provides a way to achieve interoperability.

A way to send JSON from Java to a JavaScript app for instance, would be through a web service built on REST. 

[Here is a great YouTube series I've found that teaches how to create a Java app that achieves exactly this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkKcdK1u95s&amp;list=PLqq-6Pq4lTTZh5U8RbdXq0WaYvZBz2rbn).
