When `aboutButton` is clicked, it must show a pop up windowand block inputs for the main window, and this works perfectly as intended, as well as the `backToMenuButton` button. However, I can't seem to get the `airlineActions` button to work. It is not supposed to show a new pop-up but rather to show on the same window, an entirely new FXML file.

&gt; create a class with the following properties: `String name; int atomicNumber; String symbol; double mass;`
&gt; 
&gt; create an initializer so you can just do `new Element(""Hydrogen"", 1, ""H"", 1.0079)` and a `toString` method.
&gt; 
&gt; now create an object for each element. note that now, you only have one line of code per element. you can store these in an array (or a dictionary that uses the name as the key).
&gt; 
&gt; when the user inputs the name, you can just look for it in the array (or just get the value from the key in the dictionary) and call `toString` on the object.
&gt; 
&gt; why this way? imagine that now you have to add a line in your output with the number of valence electrons for each atom. this would require a line or two in toString, rather than one line for each element.        

How would I go about doing this? What would the class with the properties look like? 

I tried making one:

    public class Structure {
        String name;
        int age;
        String color;
    
        public void add(String name, int age, String color) {

            this.age = age;
            this.color = color;
        }
    }
    
But I'm not quite sure how to go on, and `Structure.add(""Adele"",25,""Grey"");` works but doing it with another overwrites the data.

One suffers because one craves for something, and according to the third noble truth, acquiring one's cravings is NOT the solution.

The solution of the urge to masturbate is not to look at porn. One suffers by wanking to the images of beautiful people one wishes he has but doesn't. **It is not by masturbating one solves the craving of sexual desire but by letting go of this desire - that's how one becomes truly happy.**

Those stuck in silver for hundreds of hours know it best: Guides out there simply don't cut it. Watching YouTube pros tell you how to do it, from Steel to WarOwl, it just doesn't help at all. You've done your research, you've played with your sensitivity, you've played with your setup but you're still falling flat on your face. 

I've been through this painful process myself to the point that I've thought perhaps it's genetic. Perhaps there really is no salvation for some people. 

**This isn't true**, because **there is**. Stop that negativity, and read more to see the simple change that will change how you play - *forever*.

#Change your resolution to 4:3, stretched.

Yes, that's it. How could a simple 4:3 resolution change everything? Let's analyze that from technical viewpoints. *Warning: Some technical jargon below*

**1 : It makes your enemies an easier target**. Ridiculous, you might say, but not really. Most people have a display of 16:9 / 16:10. When you place a 4:3 resolution stretched on that display, you widen everything, **including your enemies**. Easier target, easier game.

**2 : It makes your FPS go higher**. 4:3 has a maximum limit of 1024x768. This kind of resolution is so small that even a toaster can give you 200 FPS. More FPS = less lag = smoother = easier shots.

**3 : Pros use it**. Ever wonder why in ESL and Twitch streams pros seem to use the same configuration? They know this technique. It appears as though they refuse to share it, perhaps to keep their place on top. 

So there you have it. The one secret in CS:GO. I myself has finally left silver through on simple change, and after experimenting for 2 weeks, I am now happy at my place in Nova 2. You too can leave silver, or whichever rank you're stuck at the most. Who knew it was so simple.

The way it would work is instead of doing anything harsh like preventing the user from commenting or posting, it instead takes 5% of the user's karma, plus a display on both the profile and the post that the user was given a Reddit Mold. That way, it can't be abused that giving tons of it will reduce functionality.

One of the reasons there is downvoting is because it helps promote which content stays on top of the others.

But even if downvoting is gone, content on top can still stay on top with upvoting. People upvote the content they want to see. If they don't want to see it, they do nothing and simply ignore the content. This way, the content the people want to see will still be on top, and the ones that don't will end up being ignored.

You, the admins, have seen the hateful side effect of downvoting for yourselves. You of all people should understand why it must be removed.

Downvoting is a cancer in social media. Hateful and bullying has no place for Reddit, as /u/ekjp put it. 

&gt;Reddit must be a safe place for all.

And this is a great way to do it.",ideasfortheadmins,Remove downvoting altogether,http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/3e9y6c/remove_downvoting_altogether/
