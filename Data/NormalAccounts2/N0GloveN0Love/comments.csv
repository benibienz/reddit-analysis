Got a notice today that UPS had come by so I loitered outside the UPS shop until the van with my package showed up. I ordered a Sig P320 in 9mm from Al Flahertys on September 5th. It was roughly $300 cheaper than at my LGS. My LGS is selling it for $980 and it's only $699 with free shipping from Al Flahertys. I emailed them with a question about receiving it and my need for an ATT. I got an email back the next day with my answer and letting me know they had submitted my transfer form. 2 days later I got an email saying they had shipped it. I got the package today and couldnt be happier. It fits awesome in my hand, looks awesome and is in perfect condition (as is expected as its new!) Overall I am extremely happy with the service from /u/al_flahertys and would recommend using them to anyone and everyone.  Also my initial impression of the P320 is that it is awesome. Ease of takedown and overall quality is great. Can't wait to get my registration in the mail so I can take it to the range! ",2016-09-15 02:32:13+00:00,d7nbh07,1.0,t3_52u4d0,383.0,canadaguns

So by that logic since its designed for a rimfire rifle it doesnt have any rules to adhere to.

AR500 gong ( how did they know??), a knife, some targets, notepads, and what I can only guess is lubricant / gun cleaner. I just happened to be going to the range today so of course the gong had to come and be put through its first trial by fire at 250 yards.  http://m.imgur.com/4gWxO7v 

Thank you u/the_red_marksman  you made my day/week/month/year. 10/10 will snipe again.

I think as it is gun owners in Canada have a pretty bad stigma against us so if theres anything we can do to keep that to a minimum (and keep the beautiful land we live in looking beautiful) we should do what we can.

The close proximity to the monsters adds a whole new level of excitement, especially when youre bashing its face repeatedly. But the great thing about monster hunter is that you dont have to main one weapon. I often still switch to great sword and LBG. I find the best hunters are the ones who are able to adapt to what the team needs, maybe a hunting horn(awesome support and dps) or a bowgun of some kind. Plus that gives you an excuse to grind out a few more sets of armor and weapons!

When Jason Becker was young he was a virtuoso on the guitar, joining ""Cacophony"" with Marty Friedman (from Megadeth). In his 20's he was diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease). ALS is a muscular disease that slowly takes away the use of all your muscles until eventually your heart stops working. Jason has beaten all the odds and is still alive today, over 20 years later. This is a song that he wrote using a computer to select notes one at a time. If that doesnt sound impressive to you you clearly have never written music. Even with an instrument in hand its hard to transcribe a song, I cant imagine trying to visualize a melody or an idea and having to lay the notes down one at a time before hearing it back.

268,Ghb is a naturally occurring amino acid found in high quantities in males. It was a legal over the counter supplement until the 80-90s . Because males have it in naturally higher doses it has an effect similar to drinking large amounts of alcohol. Females have little to no naturally occurring ghb in their systems and this causes it to have a much more dangerous effect on them. Mixing it with alcohol or any other drug is extremely dangerous and is the main reason for it being outlawed.

Superman however is kal els true personality and the clutsy and often overlooked Clark Kent is his false persona. Just my opinion,2016-02-16 10:33:25+00:00,d01rh5l,3.0,t1_d01nnih,13548.0,batman

424,I got to the requiem for Damien and was confused when he was suddenly dead . I'm just reading through Morrisons run. After I read his new 52 batman incorporated I plan on finishing up batman &amp; robin new 52.

426,I don't know if you're interested but I looked it up. Cataclysm is the event where the earthquake occurs and no man's land is living in the rubble of Gotham post cataclysm. I'm definitely going to read Dixon's run next.,2015-12-31 03:18:51+00:00,cygwufs,4.0,t1_cyguhag,4301.0,batman
427,And on the note of final crisis I look forward to finishing Morrison's run so I can take a break from it and go back with a fresh mind. There was so much I liked in final crisis but the filler is what ruined it for me. I have high hopes for the re-read though,2015-12-31 03:17:38+00:00,cygwt0l,4.0,t1_cyg549h,45594.0,batman
