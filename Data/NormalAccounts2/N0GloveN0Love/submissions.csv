I have 3 cases (750) of target load for my 12g. sitting on top of my safe. In a perfect world i'd store it in another room, but I have roommates and would prefer not to leave ammunition in a place where they or their friends would frequently see it.

Me and 2 roommates live in a post ww2 style duplex. It's freezing cold in the winter and smoking hot in the summer. I requested our landlord install either a screen door or screen Windows so we can get fresh air into the house without insects getting in or my cat getting out. He declined both saying ""thats not something I wish to do"". Just wondering if anyone knows of any tenancy laws or acts that require him to install either. I don't feel I should be out of pocket to be comfortable in my rented house. This is our 3rd year in the same location.
