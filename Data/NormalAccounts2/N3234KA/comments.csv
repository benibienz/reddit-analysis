874,"The funniest experience was the time the triage nurse played a practical joke on me. I need about 10 minutes to clean a room. The triage nurse was walking by the room and says, ""You've got 30 seconds."" I was only about 2 minutes through my cleaning, and, I thought, ""OMGOMGOMG"". 

I'm flying through the cleaning and wiping and mopping with the speed of a gazelle, and, a few other nurses and employees start to watch me. The triage nurse gets back to the room and says, ""I'm only joking. I've never seen you move so fast, though.""",2015-07-11 05:02:14+00:00,cszg5iz,2.0,t1_csz1fhc,27818.0,casualiama

877,"&gt; surely the janitors are just as, if not more important than the medical staff in order to keep the space open for other patients. 

This is the comment I'm most grateful for in this casualIAMA. If I don't keep the rooms clean, the doctors, nurses, and other employees can't do their work. If I don't do my job correctly, people can die. I'm happy to know that you (like many others, I know) understand the importance of cleaning staff in a hospital.

When people have bad things, like tuberculosis or bad abscesses, I have to do a double clean of the room. It's what the ER staff call a ""terminal clean"".
