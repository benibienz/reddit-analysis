Please note the following points regarding APA format, which is required (NOT a suggestion) for this course:

    APA does not permit the use of the first or second person (words such as 'I', 'me', 'my', 'you', 'we', 'us', etc.)
    APA does not permit the use of contractions APA requires the use of proper grammar and correct spelling
    APA requires the presence of both citations and references
    APA requires that one provide information in his or her own words
    APA requires the use of VALID sources (personal blogs, legalzoom, about.com, and wikipedia do not qualify (In fact, their use may result in the application of a 0 for that assignment). 

Again, APA should be used for your initial responses (with the exception of the 'Introductions' forum) and all papers -- not necessarily in your responses to others (unless warranted). Additional resources are posted via the home page of the course. The Writing Center may also offer additional assistance. I think that you will find by following these brief guidelines that not only will your work be APA-compliant, but it will become much stronger in tone, etc. The more practice you get in our regular assignments, the more well-equipped you will be to use this format in subsequent courses, graduate work, etc. Also, please take time to review the Discussion Requirements for this class within the syllabus. While your opinions are valued in this class, personal tangents will not suffice.

Hope that helps! :)",udub,When your professor writes emails to class like this...,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/43s7ic/when_your_professor_writes_emails_to_class_like/

A 20s, male, unemployed, Medicaid-insured patient had just been bedded and his chief complaint was severe pain in his teeth. The patient signed the Consent for Care and Financial Agreement, and, a few seconds after that, he started talking with the MD. He confessed to the MD that he hasn't had dental insurance for years or seen a dentist.

I walked back to my desk and verified that his Medicaid was active. There were some words that caught my attention, and, when I read the words, they said:

    DENTAL CVG EFF **/**/****

I've struck the date for confidentiality reasons.

Anyhow, I went back and told him, ""I can't guarantee this, and, you will need to verify with Medicaid, but, as far as I can tell, you do have dental benefits through Medicaid.""

He replied, with a solemness and gratitude in his voice, ""Are you kiddin' me?""
