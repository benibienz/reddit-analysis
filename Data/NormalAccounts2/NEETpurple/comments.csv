1,ever since this was implemented. Everyone just picks damage or flank characters. I've played 13 games as fernando back to back and even if I love playing him there's a limit to being the only tank in the team and getting trashtalked for not being even a single second out of the objective. I miss the 2 tank comps I've played back then. Everyone is now just racing who gets to have multiple kills just to show of their epeen,2016-11-01 08:13:20+00:00,d9gkk5g,1,t3_5aexi7,40620,Paladins

Ghrok - healing totems, ghost walk and ult does flashy effects


Grover - Has heals, ult also heals, psuedo sniper


Skye - Salt maker, Makes people cry, TIMES TICKING.


Evie- can fly, can blink, can turn to ice. Ult is AoE slow 


Buck - Shotgun wielding monk that jumps. Ult is steroids
