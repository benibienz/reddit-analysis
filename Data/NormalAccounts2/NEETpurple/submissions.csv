Used to be very active in DS2 with fashion stuff and just recently bought DS3 and to my shame can only play at 800x500 resolution on everything low and still only at 23fps. But anyways I still love the game

It always says ""Update required, Restart the game"" 


after some restarts and phone restart I though I would just reinstall. then when I checked at google play the game wasn't compatible with my phone. I'm running a SAMSUNG Galaxy J7 and I can't possible think why it would be incompatible to my unit even though it was running smoothly hours ago


EDIT: Downloaded an APK fresh reinstall but it still doesnt work and still says update required",soccerspirits,Can't login after maintenance,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccerspirits/comments/47jzim/cant_login_after_maintenance/

after the killcam its just a black screen and I cant hear anything and I cant even check the scoreboard.
