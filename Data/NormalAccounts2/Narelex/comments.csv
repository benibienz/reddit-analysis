**Positives**

* Huge Sword
* Good Combo's
* Good Grab's
* Versatile option in Quickdraw
* Far recovery if not edge guarded

However we want to look at his negatives.

**Negatives**

* Poor Out of Shield Options
* Other then Jab no moves faster then frame 7
* Fair bit of Endlag
* Recovery is fairly predictable and easy to edge guard
* Bad Combo weight


So baiting and punishing Ike and getting him to shield really puts a damper on all his positive traits. Also once he's shielding a grab or bite can really destroy him. The issue is likely you're being too aggressive and running into the brick wall that is a sword character instead of using their weakness in that their moves are fairly committal.

D3 has a large jump-squat so when he's in shield all he has that's quick is his grab, (frame 6 jumpsquat) The second fastest option he has is a Bair OOS which is 7 frames so that comes to frame 13 for his quickest option outside of grab.

His throws are fairly devastating if we get caught and his edgeguard game is his speciality. His grab range is pretty massive. [Have a look](http://i.imgur.com/MHJjQ.gif)

MK overall has the speed advantage so its about playing smart and safe. Most of D3's moves are very high commitment so you need to take advantage of that fact. Bullrushing will get you punished here.

245,"I'm not Oro but I can touch on this

One of the most important things when designing moves in a fighting game is ""feel""
How does it feel to use it? How does it feel to be hit by it? Is it intuitive to use and play against?
If something feels great for the user but feels awful for the person fighting them them even if its balanced that's poor design.

(Sheik Bthrow or MK's Dimensional Cape Drift from 3.5 are good examples)

Design is very complex and difficult to explain concept in video games. 
another important thing is character ""identity"" does this move make sense from what we know of the character? You try to have a ""theme"" or set of values you want to hit with your character from the get go. If you want to make a character that has good shield pressure and combo game but linear recovery and easy to combo. You end up with Wolf then you make his moves based off his themes and what we know of the character.

Probably.

Neutral game has to do with ability to convert off an even situation. Characters with really good dash dances and conversions out of them generally have good neutral games see Fox, Marth, Meta Knight.

Falco is much slower on the ground so he uses his kit (lasers) to open holes on his opponent so he can approach. Without lasers his approach is actually fairly weak and predictable due to his inability to bait moves as hard as say Marth. So while Falco is great onstage due to his laser pressure, lets say you didn't have laser and Falco's neutral against a lot of characters falls apart. (kind of a silly example but you see what i mean)

Stage control isn't neutral its controlling an advantage you've gained through obtaining momentum. Falco has a great punish game and utilizes his laser and shield pressure to obtain an advantage. Falco has a good neutral but its not the best in the game.",2015-07-20 18:26:15+00:00,ct9yjc6,5,t1_ct9xs68,1116,SSBPM

**I'm not asking for nerfs**, I just want his design to be shifted even if he remains the same strength I'd be happy. This is a case where I feel like his kit just has inherent problems that need to be addressed from a design perspective. The same thing has happened to a number characters in PM already and I don't see why Fox deserves special treatment.

Yes Fox has had a very long time to develop a metagame but you can't deny he also has an amazing toolset that's better then quite a few others. We've tried bringing all the others up to his level and that resulted in the design clusterfuck that was 3.02. Fox can currently do basically everything you could ever want. I'd want to focus his strengths on being a Fast high shield pressure character instead of being the Swiss army knife of the cast.

Any character can be played in any number of ways doesn't mean that Fox doesn't have the option especially against the slower characters to run and gun them. Sure not everyone will do it but its still something that he ""can"" do and results in boring games with one dimensional counterplay. Since the only counter as a slow character like Bowser is to try to approach Fox, Bowser is terrible at approaching but Fox can force his hand due to the potential damage he can wrack up. Then you get punished quite hard for it and it feels horrible as the Bowser player. That's poor design.

Fox is interactive but not in a healthy way. One of the most important things when thinking about design is thinking about how it feels to play as and against Fox. That is the inherent problem with Fox atm is that at the highest level, Fox doesn't feel fun to lose too. Sure he feels amazing to play as but you have to think about the overall picture when talking design. Comboing him is really fun but its so hard when playing a slow character to even put a good Fox in that situation.

No-one should be able to pull out a character that they don't even play in PM (Melee Fox) and absolutely wreck other players simply due to the way his toolset works currently (playerskill should be the defining factor imo). Lets say he was rehauled and they decided to give him new fun tools to play with. Would that really be a bad thing? Ganondorf was given the float and it has so many practical and fun uses its quite staggering.

I love watching Fox play when he's being aggressive but its impossible to deny that he is head and shoulders above a lot of characters currently even if they had the same amount of time to develop their Metagame. His toolset is just better on a base level. We need to chip away at the top and bring the bottom up that we we can hopefully have everyone meet in the middle.

I know its just my opinion but I Felt I needed to share my concerns about and I'm not trying to destroy anyone's favourite character, I'm just concerned about some of the design problems inherent in a character made for what was supposed to originally be a party game where you duked it out with your favourite Nintendo characters. They didn't expect Melee to become such a huge competitive success so it wasn't designed around competitive play. Sakurai tried to address this incorrectly in Brawl which had backlash, They've been trying with Smash 4 and while I don't enjoy Smash 4 personally. I can respect the reason behind their decisions.

Fox doesn't need to interact with some character's.

Punish game doesn't matter whatsoever if you can't touch Fox, since his Kit is far superior to most other characters. 

People don't seem to understand that to ""punish"" a character you have to win the Neutral and Fox doesn't lose neutral to anyone unless he makes a mistake. Only the faster characters really stand a chance to interact with him when Fox is played properly at all.

Skilled Fox players coming from Melee perfectly illustrate this problem. They don't have to Learn MU's because they don't need to interact. They just use their tech skill and amazing kit to steamroll over practically anyone and if that's not an indicator of a problematic design I don't know what is.

His speed, disjoints and edgeguarding give him the edge in this matchup.

I'd say the main things to watch out for are 
 
* **His grabs**, They lead to a ton of followups so treat them like Marth's or Ike's.

* **Being above him in the air**, He has some of the best moves in the game for dismantling opponents that try to take up space above him. (upair, uptilt, Upsmash etc)

* **His Neutral Air is a great combo breaker**, MK's Nair is a buzzsaw of sword around him at frame 3, so if you drop a combo you should try to bail before you tank one of these to the face.

* **DI his Upair**, Away and Up is the best DI for the move but which one you do depends on the part of the sword he hits you with (left part = DI to the left for example) Not DIing properly can lead to a sweetspot shuttle loop, Tornado or Dimensional cape that can kill.

* **Dimensional Cape**, Is a very fast and potent Kill tool with lengthy cooldown, If you get too predictable with your rolls/techs or are throwing unsafe moves out when he's in range expect one of these.

Fox has way more potent and useful kill options then Bowser this patch. Why is the character the size of an Abrams not as deadly as a space fox? Seems weird to me tbh.

Best neutral in the Game. Lasers provide constant pressure. Amazing Matchup spread. Frame 1 move in Shine with ridiculous shield pressure. An excellent Dashdance game.

556,"""Toxic"" gameplay (I hate that word) good examples from 3.5 are Bowser ROB Lucario and Fox

- Bowsers armour system was confusing and inconsistent and some of his moves were far too powerful (Dash attack)

- ROB was just too good at everything last patch. He had literally every tool you could ever want on a character not to mention he gets platform movement without platforms cause he has an airdash (what a cheater =P  )

- Lucario ASC was busted. Recovery was too good with an Aura charge. Keeping intangibility out of Downb was really silly with Dsmash. The fact he was ungrabbable during his upsmash, ASC and sideb seems like it was an oversight (He's in a good spot now I feel)

- Fox was overall a little too good and has been scaled back a tad, jab to upsmash, 0 to kill Shines offstage and sakurai combo were always silly.

I also feel like any-time Melee mains shit on PM without having played it much at all, is also a huge problem. They call MU's *jank* when they don't realize that learning competitive Melee is the same way cause at first things like Falco Dair and laser feel *jank*, Falcon Up air strings to Knee feel *jank*, Fox upthrow to upair feels *jank*, shine feel *jank*. *Jank* is just another word for something you do not understand its lazy and you should feel bad for stooping to that level.

The removal of a lot of his armour and dash attack nerfs on top of the MK buffs really pushed this back into our favour. /u/Odds_ is also a better player then me (for now) so I might be basing the MU of him off him just being better then me. 

MK combos Bowser extremely well and has a good dashdance to bait out his laggy moves. His techroll is bad so you can throw for days but the main use of throwing him is getting rid of his positional advantage because Bowser is a very positioning heavy character. He also has a hardtime against us the same way a really good fox with bowser MU knowledge is hard in that we punish him extremely hard and have an amazing neutral game. I'm sure /u/Odds_ could explain it in more detail.

- A better Neutral game then Falcon. 
- Almost as good a Dash dance game as him. 
- Transcendent disjoints (moves can't be clanked except for dash attack) 
- The overall ease we can combo him and get him offstage. Everyone knows how bad falcon's recovery is our Nair can beat most attempts to recovery and our dair/bair gimp him well. 

- His tech roll is awful so he's easy to tech chase.

- We have as good aerials but much better grounded moves IMO.

- He has no projectile or huge disjoints to hinder us.

Variety of things really but the Transcendent moves tend to be the hardest part Falcon struggles against.

617,"Down-b (**D**imensional **C**ape) is the move that took me by far the longest to get good at. I'd say just practice labbing in training mode with a cpu set to standing at first then change its settings as you want to try different things. walking standing jumping etc.

The first thing to practice is quickly flicking the cstick as soon as you hit down b. This is known as a Instant Dimensional cape (IDC) and is quite useful at punishing flubbed techs or whiffed moves.

Then you need to figure out how to alter your positioning with DC learn the difference between slashing forward, slashing while staying still, backwards but slashing forward and completely turning around to slash.
(all of those are fairly straight forward ""standing"" one is done by flicking the cstick up or down as you enter with no control stick input you do shift a bit forward though no matter what. but to do the turn around you have to hold the control stick completely in the other direction when inputting the cstick flick behind you otherwise you'll port slightly back and slash instead of turning)

Mess around with the differences in timing and distance that holding the button vs hitting cstick as both are useful.

Upthrow to Dimensional cape is a punish on a lot of characters but keep in mind its varying percents when it works. It works early vs floaties and late on fast fallers. you'll have to vary your DC based on their DI. Some characters if they DI away and get out of hitstun and have a fast nair (frame 3 usually) can Nair us as we reach them with DC so keep that in mind do not try it on bowser often since his Nair is both huge fast and has armour on it.

Practice grabbing ledge with it something I'm still working on especially post 3.6 changes.

Use a IDC if they DI away during an up air string for a quick kill off the side.

The most important thing is practice, practice, practice 

constantly try to find new ways to use your DC in useful ways.

**ALL Dimensional Cape Drifting is gone in 3.6**

I find the upthrow to DC works best on middle of the road floaties like Mario/Sonic and against big characters that are not bowser.

All I can think of at the moment but I may edit this post more later so keep a sharp eye out.",2015-07-06 17:26:40+00:00,cstzu2y,3,t1_cstujmc,8733,smashbros
618,"It was an even MU in 3.5 However...

**Why MK Crushes a Zard with no MK MU knowledge**

- MK has one of the best air combo games period. Zard is massive and incredibly easy to string up airs on. MK can also kill out of the strings with a Tornado, Upb or Downb depending on their DI. 

- MK has the 4th fastest runspeed in the game and an amazing Dashdance. So he can bait a laggy move and then close the gap extremely fast. 

- MK is also one of the best edgeguarders in the game so if Zard goes offstage he should die. I don't know Zard's MU spread very well but if he has issues against fox he will have issues vs MK since we're just as fast and have better combos on Zard.

- MK can combo Zard out of any throw that's not backthrow due to his size. Also can get very Easy Up throw to Dimensional cape on him due to his slower Nair and size.

- An overall note about MK though is he is extremely hard to play against when you're new to the matchup his Speed and Transcendent disjoints can feel oppressive and scary. (Transcendent means it can't clank with anything)

- Most people also tend to underestimate a MK due to the popular opinion thinking he was bad last patch. (He wasn't that bad IMO) 

**Things to know about fighting MK as Zard are**

- He has a terrible techroll, downthrow is perfect for Tech-chasing.
- He's fairly light he's just slightly lighter then falco this patch so he stays in hitstun for awhile.
- He's a semi-fastfaller so he's very easy to combo if you get the chance.
- If MK gets hit out of an aerial special move he loses all jumps.
- Zard is also good at edgeguarding him.
- Learn to DI his combo's and SDI out of things like upair strings and upsmash.
- MK's Frame data is good, most of his moves are extremely fast and have very little endlag.
- My reach isn't as big as it seems.
- Your Ftilt is very powerful against me if I mess up a Dash dance.
- You can stop some of my aerial approaches with Jab.
- My Nair is frame 3 and it covers my whole body at the start of the move so I can escape from combos with it.

Odds lives in my city and he also has a good Zard, so that's how I learned this MU.",2015-07-06 11:32:48+00:00,cstpiet,3,t1_cstpaow,801,smashbros

621,"I think its important to note that Falcon is primarily a **bait and punish character** (not sure what category Mario is in) 

Learning to have good control over your movement is extremely important especially with a character that's as easily punished as Falcon. His recovery is worse the Mario's but I'd say he has far more stage presence and more deadly punishes. 

His ground moves are all really average aside from jab (amazing if you gentleman it). He has amazing aerials. His grab leads to great punishes. He really likes big stages against most characters since he can completely outmanoeuvre them with his ground speed and great ability to maintain his velocity while jumping.

Falcon is really fun but its important to note that due to his fallspeed and recovery gets punished really hard if he messes up. I'd say he's overall a better character then Mario this patch but I'm also biased. I'd say give him a shot there's a reason so many people play Falcon.",2015-07-06 09:27:13+00:00,cstnrhu,3,t1_cstmj6b,5327,SSBPM

*You can't Dtilt poke through his shield, he has a good cc ,double jump armour can stuff most of your aerials, Down Smash can stop any recovery that's not high or a sweetspot. Chainthrows and Combos for days out of a grab.*

His mediocre recovery and ability to be comboed and inability to grab you out of the air anymore make this doable in 3.6 They also changed the formula on his DJ armour. Made him weigh less so his armour/CC is less potent. Not to mention the variety of MK buffs. 55/45 Yoshi's favour.
