Landing with DC turning the momentum around then turning around to face the ledge as I slid off. Fun stuff 

(Squirtle mains I tried my best)

Did any of you learn to DC drift? Did you know it existed? What are your thoughts on its removal?

Personally I feel its removal was very justifiable 

* It let MK cover his weaknesses 

* Was his best option for cross the stage edgehogging

* Turned his Down-b into a massive mindgame tool  

* Could use it as a recovery tool to land behind his opponent and slide out of their range

* It was super hard to deal with for people playing against it for the first time

* Moon Drift was great at baiting attacks

* Could crouch to cancel it at any time


Don't worry though MK traded his tokyo drift for something even better this patch....**Buffs**

- **ALL Dimensional Cape Drifting is gone in 3.6**

- Down-b (Dimensional Cape) is the move that took me by far the longest to get good at. Practice it in training mode with a cpu set to standing at first then change its settings as you want to try different things. walking standing jumping etc.
The first thing to practice is *very* quickly flicking the cstick as soon as you hit down b. This is known as a Instant Dimensional cape (IDC) and is quite useful at punishing flubbed techs or whiffed moves.

- Then you need to figure out how to properly alter your positioning with DC learn the difference between slashing forward, slashing while standing still, backwards but slashing forward and completely turning around to slash. 

Most of those are fairly straight forward. The ""standing"" one is done by flicking the cstick up or down as you enter DC with no control stick input, you do shift a bit forward though no matter what. but to do the turn around you have to hold the control stick completely in the other direction when inputting the cstick flick behind you otherwise you'll port slightly back and slash instead of turning and slashing in the opposite direction

- Mess around with the differences in timing and distance that holding the button vs hitting cstick as both are useful.

- Upthrow to Dimensional cape is a punish on a lot of characters but keep in mind its varying percents when it works. It works early vs floaties and late on fast fallers. you'll have to vary your DC based on their DI. Some characters if they DI away and get out of hitstun and also have a fast nair (frame 3 usually) can Nair us as we reach them with DC so keep that in mind. Do not try it on Bowser often since his Nair is both huge, fast and has armour on it.

- Practice grabbing ledge with it something I'm still working on especially post 3.6 changes.

- Use a IDC if they DI away during an up air string for a quick kill off the side.

- The most important thing is practice, practice, practice
constantly try to find new ways to use your DC in useful ways.

- Anytime you disappear you create a mindgame opportunity. They will usually expect the slash so sometimes doing nothing is more effective of a mixup. Also good to mixup recovery Down-bs by trying to hit with the slash sometimes and sometimes no slash since you can condition them to shield when you vanish.

- I find the upthrow to DC works best on middle of the road floaties like Mario/Sonic and against big characters that are not bowser.

19,2015-07-06 12:10:51+00:00,self.SSBPM,https://www.reddit.com/r/SSBPM/comments/3calfq/metaknight_vs_charizard/,,"Someone asked me about the Charizard MU on another board and I ended up typing a much longer explanation then I planned so I'd thought I'd share if with all of you since its a rather obscure MU.

*Charizard vs MK is 50/50 (in 3.5) However*

**Why MK Crushes a Zard with no MK MU knowledge**

- MK has one of the best air combo games period. Zard is massive and incredibly easy to string up airs on. MK can also kill out of the strings with a Tornado, Upb or Downb depending on their DI. 

- MK has the 4th fastest runspeed in the game and an amazing Dashdance. So he can bait a laggy move and then close the gap extremely fast. 

- MK is also one of the best edgeguarders in the game so if Zard goes offstage he should die. I don't know Zard's MU spread very well but if he has issues against a good fox he will have issues vs MK since we're just as fast and have better combos on Zard.

- MK can combo Zard out of any throw that's not backthrow due to his size. Also can get very Easy Up throw to Dimensional cape on him due to his slower Nair and just how big of a character he is.

- An overall note about MK though is he is extremely hard to play against when you're new to the matchup his Speed and Transcendent disjoints can feel oppressive and scary. (Transcendent means it can't clank with anything)

- Most people also tend to underestimate a MK due to the popular opinion of that he was awful last patch. (He wasn't that bad IMO) 

**Things to know about fighting MK as Zard are**

- He has a terrible techroll, downthrow is perfect for Tech-chasing.
- He's fairly light he's just slightly lighter then falco this patch so he stays in hitstun for awhile.
- He's a semi-fastfaller so he's very easy to combo if you get the chance.
- If MK gets hit out of an aerial special move he loses all jumps.
- Zard is also good at edgeguarding him.
- Learn to DI his combo's and SDI out of things like upair strings and upsmash.
- MK's Frame data is good, most of his moves are extremely fast and have very little endlag.
- MK's reach isn't as big as it seems.
- Your Ftilt is very powerful against MK if he messes up a Dash dance.
- You can stop some of MK's aerial approaches with Jab.
- MK's Nair is frame 3 and it covers his whole body at the start of the move so he can escape from combos with it.

/u/Odds_ lives in my city and he has a good Zard, So he's how I learned about this MU (thanks man). If I missed anything let me know guys.",SSBPM,Metaknight vs Charizard,http://www.reddit.com/r/SSBPM/comments/3calfq/metaknight_vs_charizard/

**Its 15 ping per 1 buffer (16.66 specifically, Its to account for jitter so make sure its slightly above their current ping )**  

*For 3-4 people you add everyone's ping together to determine buffer. In case you want to rotate/Doubles*

**The List** 

*Updates will be frequent* 

General/Friendlies  

- The host ""should"" set the game up so don't touch anything otherwise. The host should go to the tags screen first in-case either of you use custom controls then the CSS  (In PM)

- If the host doesn't set it up take charge and do it yourself

- Play only legal stages. *Unless you both use the gentleman's agreement to play an unusual one.*

- Since what stages are legal in PM is spotty. Bottom two rows.

- Try to practice offline as well certain things aren't worth learning on netplay due to the varying delay. Like any character with hard tech for example perfect wavelands.

- You can show you're ready for a match by flicking the c stick in character select.

- Don't try to learn a new character/tech on Netplay unless its the only PM you play. That delay will mess you up offline.

- Unless its a 2 buffer don't be surprised if you're worse on netplay.

- If its not urgent let someone know that the next game will be your last.

- It's worth noting that PM does not run as smoothly on everyone's computers this patch (3.6b) I personally get FPS drops when seeing an effect for the first time. Which did not occur at all in 3.5.

- Don't ragequit. it gives you a bad rep on anthers. Just say the next match is your last and take the losses as a learning experience 

- Don't be a dick,[If you're salty use this](http://poyoarya.github.io/john.html )

- Don't be a douche, if you beat someone hard don't tell everyone in the chat we don't care

- Don't be a asshole, If someone ragequits don't yell it all over chat.

- Its okay to refuse a match due to stuttering/too high buffer

- Don't get mad if someone taunts. People might taunt locally or not know it can be offensive so take it in good spirits ( The salt is real)

- Don't turn in-game music off without asking first. Especially since we have new music on the netplay build

- Its ok to stop playing against someone if you feel they're too far from your skill level just don't be a dick about it.

- No John's 

- Keep your public chat civil

- Read the chat rules

- try to give tips if someone asks for them but don't give false information and if you don't know how to give them tips just tell them the truth [otherwise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmLRTVYgEq4)

- Don't call PM jank, That's a John (you scrublords)

**NEW Ranked section** *Partial credit to Munk-E*
 
- It takes 24 hours to play ranked after you first register for Anthers.

- If you're queuing up for a game, use the time to start up the dolphin room, and copy the code. Basically, try to expedite the process as much as you can.

- Follow the Ranked rules these are listed on Anthers ladder under the Ranks section.

- Learn to do things quickly. This will come over time, but just be as fast as you can when setting your controls, or picking your skin, or navigating menus, as well as picking characters and stages in the ladder window. You're gonna play a lot of sets, and being able to do all this quick, shaves off a surprising amount of time.



- Sometimes it's hard to get a game. If someone rematches you after you just played. Don't assume they're salty about the result, a lot of the time, it's just the only option.



- Similarly, if someone doesn't accept your rematch, don't assume they're salty, they might just want to play other people.


- Don't obsess about rank. It will generally get higher the more you play until you reach a certain point, and then sort of stagnate. Also, the way the ranking system works, you will change ranks a good amount. Remember, the difference between bronze and silver is one point.



- A lot of people don't follow this one, but if the lag is too much, don't wait until after the match to complain about it. If you want to cancel, pause the game right there and say so. People have different tolerances for how stuttery the game can be, and if you lose, and THEN say you wanna cancel the match, you come off as kind of a dick.



- Speaking of lag, keep in mind why the game might lag. There's 3 reasons: Either the person's computer can't run dolphin properly, the connection is bad or 3.6 is being silly. If it's your computer, close as much as you can. If it's the connection, there's 2 things it could be. The Ping is just too high. My personal limit is 100 ping or 6 buffer. After that, I'd rather not play, but learn how far that is geographically, and try to avoid challenging/playing them in the first place. The second type of lag is much worse, and that's a spotty connection. This causes lag spikes, and dolphin will say most of the time you're at a reasonable ping. but occasionally jump to like 150 or higher. If this happens, make sure neither party is playing on wireless, and other than that, you gotta just power through it, or cancel.
 

- Keep in mind 3.6b can be quite temperamental on some people's computers. For mine personally the FPS can drop every time a new effect is used for the first time. If it looks like the game freezes give it a bit as its usually just a big fps drop. (Pausing Mid match seems to cause it as well)




- Oh yeah. DO NOT PLAY ON WIRELESS. This is just for any gaming at all, I know who you are ಠ_ಠ Chad..



**These last points are something that aren't required but are a good thing to do in general**

- Try to talk to people before and after playing. Most people don't go on anthers to fight a CPU that happens to play like a person. But we all have our days where we just want to play so don't be offended if they don't talk much

- If you're dominating and think your opponent is getting frustrated and you want to keep playing them you ""can"" switch to a secondary. *However* they may ask if you will stay on your char because they want the MU practice. Most people dislike being beaten with their own character so if you switch to the same character as them it helps to tell them you want to practice it first. Otherwise quite a few people will take it as you saying ""I'm better then you at this character"" even if that's not what you're going for, So just tell them in chat a little context goes a long way. (obviously if you both pick the character the first time at the CSS this point is moot.)

- If the other person is streaming ask if they want the music off due to silly things like copyright 
( should only be an issue against bigger name players)
