511,"&gt; it probably won't really help me in the scheme of things

As a CS major I didn't understand **scheme** either when I first took CS 135.

Jokes aside, I think CS 135 is definitely doable for anyone who is willing to put in the effort. The assignments are fairly easy compared to upper year CS courses, and they kinda make you think in a functional way which is definitely worth it. And plus having CS 135 rather than 115 on your transcript is gonna help you in the future when you wanna transfer into CS.",2016-07-02 01:54:40+00:00,d4w5bac,1.0,t3_4qv03a,3745.0,uwaterloo

731,"I don't really think we are really that competitive in terms of helping out a friend on assignments. My friends are all very helpful when I ask them for help clarifying difficult concepts and figuring out hard problems. I think people at UofT and UBC are more like ""starving dogs"".

On the other hand, I think the Panino memers are getting really competitive here. I wanna remind them that the back of Paninos is just a really stale meme, I will shake the foundation of this sub tmrw with some disruptive, quality, phenomenal CHAGGERING meme.",2016-04-15 05:56:26+00:00,d23oqa6,1.0,t3_4evcx9,605.0,uwaterloo
