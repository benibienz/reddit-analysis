I just finished my 2A term and am currently in Ottawa/Nepean for my first co-op term. I just wanna say that this year has been amazing, and I want to thank UW and thank this subreddit. I feel a strong sense of community here.

I moved to Ontario from BC last September and all I thought about was how I could reinvent myself. I didn't have too much fun in high school, and to be completely honest I felt that I wasn't challenged enough. I cruised through all my courses, but I didn't think I learned anything remotely useful. My friends in BC weren't very hard-working and I kinda slacked off and goofed around. They were all kinda selfish in a way too. Some of them would come to you with massive grins on their faces asking for help on a math question, but when you asked them in return to stand in the line for you for like five minutes, they would snake you and come up with all sorts of excuses. They partied like crazy and though I did try to relax and have fun with them, getting wasted just isn't my thing. In the end, most of them ended up going to UBC/SFU, and I was the only one in my circle to go to Waterloo (outside BC even). Since nobody knows me here, I thought I could start life anew in a fresh place.

I met so many amazing and caring people since coming here. Seriously. People here just aren't as judgemental and self-righteous as those I've met in BC. Back in my high school you could be ridiculed for wearing glasses or playing baseball (because apparently baseball is inferior in some people's opinions and they have to tell you that too). I feel that people at UW are more open-minded and just more civilized. My friends are supportive, and I really think that I can rely on them when I need them, and I am willing to help them out 100% too. I can just strike up a pleasant conversation with the person sitting next to me in class. I also had so much fun at clubs. And I like how there's this nice, benign competition going on between friends and peers. Everyone just strives to be better and better every day, and not just academically, whether it's doing side projects, playing Quizbowl, reading new books, learning new languages, or lifting in the gym. I know we still have some mental health issues going on on this subreddit, but I feel that if you have a positive mindset and reach out more, you will see that UW is so full of positivity and this amazing vibe. Honestly, I'm kinda already missing school now.

This subreddit is pretty amazing too. Despite all the low quality posts people claim are ruining this community, there's still an overwhelming majority of people who are willing to help. I always get a great laugh out of all the humour posts (e.g. Thank Mr Goose, Mr Paninos, Sedra Smith etc.), and we do have a pretty strong and defining school spirit, at least on this subreddit. When I talk to strangers on campus, I always ask them if they reddit, and if they do, I always talk about the newest memes and posts on this sub. It's a great way to connect with people.

Anyhow, thanks for reading my story. Maybe it's just me, but I think I definitely made the right decision coming to Waterloo. Call me naive but I really feel that I've reinvented myself. I'm not looking back. Thank you UW and thank you /r/uwaterloo.

I don't wanna spoil the film for you, but I can assure you guys that the jacket is authentic. It has the number ""87"" stitched on the right sleeve, nothing on the left sleeve, and ""University of Waterloo"" stitched on the back, just like a regular engineering leather jacket. The guy wearing it in the film (the character, not the actor) is actually really poor and has never left the island he was born and raised on, so it is highly unlikely that he somehow got an engineering degree at UW (plus he's not even that old, I doubt he's in class of 1987). My parents recognized the actor, and commented that the filming crew probably bought the jacket at some pawn shop in Japan. Because there's just no way that the filming crew or the plot or the actor is in any way related to UW. 

Here's the million-dollar question: What kind of UW Engineering graduate sold their $300 leather jacket (+$100 for stitching the year, I presume) on a rural island in Japan?

I am both delighted and humbled to share with you that I have been asked to serve as president and vice-chancellor for a second term.
 
I’m proud of the many success we’ve achieved together. Working as a team, we have enhanced and championed our distinctive strengths like experiential and co-operative education, supported the growth of the Waterloo region’s world-class innovation ecosystem, and delivered important advancements in research and scholarship.
 
Equally, at this great University, we are presented with opportunities and challenges to make ever-greater impacts on our society and country. And we will, together.
 
In the months and years to come, we will ensure this exceptional institution is globally recognized as an innovation leader. 
 
In doing so, we will continue working closely together, both here on campus, in the community and beyond, to advance the University’s interests. I’m counting on your advice, support, and partnership as we consolidate our successes and look toward the future.
 
In the near term, we will continue implementing our current strategic plan, with specific attention to:
enriching the campus experience for our students, faculty, and staff, to develop the most intellectually stimulating and collegial environment possible;
building on our signature strength of experiential and co-operative education;
attracting the top students, faculty and staff from across Canada and around the world; and being a champion of collaboration to further Canada’s innovation agenda.
I thank every one of you for your support, confidence, and hard work — past, present, and future — to ensure the University of Waterloo remains the great university and community we are all so proud to be a part of.
