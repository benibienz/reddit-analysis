How specific are phages to the bacteria they attack?  Do we have to wait until a culture identifies the organism responsible for the infection or can we give patients a ""cocktail"" of various phages as a shotgun approach if they need immediate treatment?

How long of a shelf life would they have?  Are only lytic phages effective for treatment or can temperate phages also be used?  How quickly can phages adapt to bacterial resistance? ",2016-11-07 17:02:49+00:00,d9pr1c2,1.0,t3_5blwfu,16056.0,science

He was commenting about cards he would cut and replace, which is fine, I like seeing a stock deck cause someone's gears to turn.  

I started noticing problems when he was getting *too* political.  Damn near every combat phase he was really trying to pressure every player to attack into him since he didn't have a sac outlet.  I understand asking once or twice, but he started getting annoying about it.  

The game starts to drag on and he's got a pretty scary-sized graveyard going on, so I fetch up my relic of progenitus and he threatens to scoop, which really bothered me.

137,"[Oloro Pillowfort](https://deckstats.net/decks/28437/573838-oloro-pillowfort-current)

Oloro was my first commander, picked his precon box up on a whim because I was drawn to the guaranteed lifegain.  I almost never would cast him for fear of (at the time) him getting tucked and me losing out on my lifegain engine.  I love the idea of sitting behind a nice, cozy pillow fort full of effects that make you much less desirable to attack compared to everyone else with reliable lifegain to back it up.  

My manabase feels somewhat gross, mostly made up of cards I had on hand and a few lands I shelled out for (maze of ith, serra's sanctum).

I like to win by being able to take everyone out at once (or with a win-the-game effect like felidar sovereign), so that I don't feel like I'm singling someone out.  The classic exquisite blood + sanguine bond/vizkopa guildmage combo is obvious here.  I'm not a fan of infinite turn combos or even taking multiple turns (for the most part), so I'm not running any time warp effects.  

I'm welcoming criticisms, as I'm having a hard time picking cards to switch out while still sticking to the pillowfort/enchantment theme, as well as trying to find a balance of how many creatures I need while also packing a lot of board wipes.

310,"I feel like curses need a bit of an overhaul.  There have been numerous posts about reworks to curses in an effort make them feel more like a challenge to adapt your playstyle to, instead of just annoying the shit out of you with no real way to play around them unless you're lucky enough to happen upon black candle or a dagaz rune.  I've loved some of the ideas posted, like enemies having a martyrdom effect that has them drop bombs when they die (or a chance to).      

For the most part they don't really make me feel like I need to change my playstyle to overcome it.  Beating a floor with a curse should make you feel like you overcame it because you're good, not you overcame it because you got lucky or had to walk into another room a few times.  They aren't all completely terrible, curse of the labyrinth is alright and even potentially beneficial in some cases.  

In general I feel like curses should either be given a risk/reward factor in their current state, or be completely reworked to feel more like a challenge that you can get around with skill and less like just an annoyance that can potentially fuck up your whole run due to bad luck (too many missingno and isaac's heart pickups from curse of the blind).

411,"* Spinarak/ariados.  I love spiders and they don't get nearly enough praise for all the good they do for us.  I never kill them if they're in my house (not even black widows), and I take them outside and find a nice plant to set them on.  Also I honestly think the jumping spiders we have around here (Idaho) are adorable.

* Flabebe/floette/florges.  Fairy is my favorite type, florges is my favorite fairy type, and Idaho has some pretty big forests with plenty of pretty flowers.  Probably wouldn't be that hard to run into one.    

* Ralts/kirlia/gardevoir.  This one is probably the least likely, since the dex says a ralts will rarely appear before people.  However, it will draw closer if that person has a positive disposition, and I'm not really easily angered, so I could see that happening.  And no, I don't want a gardevoir for the whole waifu bullshit.  It can see into the future, will stop at nothing to protect its trainer (which could be good or bad, I don't want to just use it as a bodyguard, I wouldn't want harm to come to it), and could probably communicate with me via telepathy.  What's not to like? 

* happiny/chansey/blissey.  Chansey are fairly rare (at least in the old dex entries), but I work in a hospital, so I'm sure at some point after being hired I'd get a happiny.  They probably breed their chansey/blissey every so often.  

* Mareep/flaaffy/ampharos.  Idaho is a rural state, and I'm no stranger to neighbors raising livestock.  Ampharos is my favorite second gen pokemon to boot.  

* Sylveon.  Fairy bias strikes again!  In all honesty, my favorite eeveelution is actually glaceon.  However, most eeveelutions seem legitimately difficult to obtain (I don't know how hard it would be to get an evolutionary stone, and while Idaho can have some harsh winters we're not really that cold sans some mountain ranges), so that pretty much leaves me with leafeon (we have quite a bit of moss), sylveon, espeon, and umbreon.  With enough TLC my eevee would undoubtedly become a sylveon at some point.  Eevee are rare in the wild but more frequent in bigger cities, and I live close to Boise.

939,"I did boss rush with knife and some damage ups, my only defensive item was holy mantle which doesn't really help much in boss rush.  I should've had someone measure my heart rate during that madness o.O",2015-08-08 20:22:12+00:00,ctw7lr0,3.0,t1_ctvuk2d,28086.0,bindingofisaac
940,"My problem doing the run with isaac is I hardly get the angel room to appear despite ignoring devil rooms.  I'm wondering if the ability to theoretically access 4 angel room items from 1 angel room has a better payoff despite the potential longer run to get there.  Especially if i want to reset until i get rosary bead/goat head/belial.

Edit: Just rerolled key piece 2 into godhead.  Reroll was the best option!",2015-08-08 10:47:07+00:00,ctvsxha,2.0,t1_ctvsw03,182.0,bindingofisaac
