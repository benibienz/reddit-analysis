I like getting super value out of ETB cards that, by themselves, are pretty crappy like [[Reality Acid]], but they become total bombshells in a brago deck.

My current decklist is [here.](https://deckstats.net/decks/28437/589298-budget-brago)

With the release of kaladesh, cards like [[Panharmonicon]] and [[Cloudblazer]] are no-brainers for a brago deck, so I'm trying to figure out what's best to cut.  I also need to make room for cards like [[Cloudform]].  

Before anyone points it out, yes, I am aware that [[Medomai the Ageless]] does not equal infinite turns in a brago deck.  I just have him in there because I've already got plenty of ways to grant evasion, and he can help buy me some time.  Despite me not being a fan of extra turns in commander, Medomai feels justifiable to me since he asks quite a bit for a time warp and only gives me one extra turn.   

I'm not a fan of winning by stax ([[Lavinia of the Tenth]] is somewhat of an exception here), infinite combos that *aren't* an instant win, infinite or multiple extra turns, or any of the other ""unfun"" strategies that are popular in commander.  As such, I'm going to be biased against suggestions like [[Winter Orb]], [[Static Orb]], etc. 

Remember this is a budget deck as well, so suggestions for money cards won't be of much help.

My overall goal for this deck is to have it go against more casual decks and still feel strong, but not cutthroat or making me feel like I'm the fun police.

I like to play Oloro with an enchantment-heavy pillowfort style.  I like the idea of sitting inside my safe bubble, making myself much less desirable to attack compared to the other people sitting at the table. 

As for win conditions, I prefer to win by being able to wipe everyone out at once, as I don't like to single one person out.  So winning by exquisite blood + sanguine bond/vizkopa guildmage or upkeep with felidar sovereign is preferable.  I don't currently have exsanguinate and debt to the deathless listed, although finding some cards to swap them out for is part of the problem I'm having.  I would also like to capitalize more on the idea of gaining/draining (and more of a feeling like my lifegain fuels some sort of ""engine,"" aside from just keeping a profit against things like phyrexian arena), but again I'm having a hard time figuring out what cards to keep and what to ditch.  I'd prefer to have less creatures if I have to in order to make that happen, as that makes it easier for me to pack so many board wipes and keep things like pendrell mists.

I prefer not to take extra turns, so I'm not running any time warp effects.  I don't really like making people sit there and watch me play 3+ turns in a row.  I'm also not a huge fan of stalling the board with things like stasis and boring people to death.

Are all local pet stores bad?  I know places like petsmart are less than ideal.  There is a [franchise](http://www.zamzows.com/) that's locally owned and operated, and usually when I go in there they seem more legit and their pets generally appear to be in better health than places like petsmart.  Also, how reliable are sellers online, or should I avoid them entirely?

My shiny cottonee has infiltrator, and I'd *really* prefer it have prankster.  Rather than dexnav my brains out for another shiny with prankster, I decided to try for an ability capsule, and would like to accumulate BP at a reasonable rate.   

I did a bit of EV training via super training, and used dexnav to find some pokes with 3 perfect IV's.  I like to stick to pokemon I personally like, not necessarily what's top-tier, however sometimes those coincide (looking at klefki).  What I currently have is:

1.  Klefki w/prankster, no item yet but I plan on purchasing one (maybe leftovers, not sure).  Moves are thunder wave, swagger, spikes, foul play.  I maxed its HP EV's, and went down the middle for def and sp. def.  Not sure on the nature, (or what perfect IV's it has), but I will check once I have the chance.  

2.  Gallade w/ Justified, holding galladite.  Currently knows close combat, psycho cut (I've heard zen headbutt is better, I may switch over), swords dance, protect (I plan on giving him ice punch once I can afford the tutor).  Maxed its speed and attack EV's, put leftover in HP.  I'd really like to keep using him, as he was a shiny ralts I found with the dexnav with 3 perfect IV's and an adamant nature, so I figured he'd make a good gallade.  

As for number 3, I'm still undecided.  I'm planning on a tanky blissey that can provide some clerical support as well as being able to soak up some damage, maybe stall out with toxic or something.  However I haven't come across a mirage forest/mountain that has a happiny yet in ORAS, and I'd like to rely on my own searching rather than just searching around on the GTS.

I am under the assumption that the stock heat sink for the CPU will suffice.  I have my own HDD and optical drive that I gutted from a crappy pavilion slimline, so presumably I won't be needing to purchase those, along with already having a monitor/keyboard/mouse that I can use.    

I'd like to know of any good alternatives to the case that would cost less, but still have some degree of wiggle room if I want to add more later.  Any other thoughts on alternatives would be appreciated, as I've never done this before so I honestly feel like I have no idea what I'm doing.

I'm really drawn to the idea of my snake wrapping around me for extended periods of time, which sounds right up the ball python's alley.  My only concern is maintaining the humidity, as I live in a pretty dry climate.  How difficult/costly is it to make sure the ball's home is consistently humid enough?  If something like a humidifier isn't too expensive, or could just misting a terrarium with some type of absorbent substrate do the trick?

Another question would be reliable sources.  I'm not really aware of any reptile conventions that make their way through my town, and I've been told to stay away from big name stores like petsmart etc.  We do have a locally owned pet store franchise that appears to be more reputable with their pets, but I've never bought anything from them involving exotic pets so I wouldn't know how good their selection is in that regard.  I've browsed some online breeder stores, but all the websites appear somewhat sketchy.  

I understand that balls can be picky eaters and going off feeding is normal for them, and if I buy a ball from someone that can tell me how they fed it, I shouldn't have a problem in that department.

None of us have ever played any type of tabletop RPG before, and I was chosen to GM an adventure path (the mummy's mask one is what I have, it looks really cool).  

On our first session, someone came into the game store who said he's a seasoned GM and I asked if he could run a few sessions for us so we get the hang of how the game works.  

About 2 sessions into his campaign, we get a level 1 TPK (not even from lethal damage, but all PC's were paralyzed).  I don't know much about this game, but I've heard bad things about GM's who are out to kill the players instead of offer a tough challenge.

However, now this guy wants to be a player in my campaign and I'm afraid he'll become problematic.  I can't really tell if someone is intentionally metagaming since I have very little knowledge of this game's mechanics (he said he's going to be a dhampir alchemist).  I'm not sure if, as the GM,  I can keep him in check (if I can, tips would be greatly appreciated), or if it would be better (albeit awkward) to politely tell him we don't want him in our playgroup, and how you guys have dealt with problematic players or GM's that are a little too bloodthirsty.

I had dealt with the postgame depression for quite some while after ME3, and didn't want to get involved in another bioware game for that reason.  But I started playing thinking what the hell, I probably won't get *that* attached to any of the characters.  

That is, until I met Cassandra.  Now, I'm not talking about when you actually literally meet her for the first time, but when you really start seeing the woman behind that rough exterior.  I was initially planning on romancing josephine, but I was quickly persuaded otherwise. 

Catching her reading Varric's book, her taking you away to a private place to discuss all the flirting you've done, reading her poetry... I loved every second of her romantic and funny interactions.  

And then I finished the game.  I got some very sweet ""happy to be with the man I love"" lines, I didn't lose her to the chantry (Leliana became Divine in my game), and I was excited to finish up side quests and be greeted with ""the sight of you warms the heart"" every time I returned to skyhold.  

That is, until all I got from her was ""hello, inquisitor"" and no option to get some alone time.  

I feel sort of betrayed and heartbroken by the developers.  Would it have been that hard to add one or two lines of dialogue for her (and the other companions) for after beating the main quest?  I can't see any reason narrative-wise that she would suddenly become emotionless toward you, especially if she doesn't become the next Divine.  At least keep what she usually says to her lover?  I'm finding myself reverting to an older save to hinder the heartbreak, but I'm still at a bit of a loss.
