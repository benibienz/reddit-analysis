1. Offensive set : overdrive / POAH/ HE .he already possessive a great deal of defense and a very short invulnerable state ability . With max cooldown you will be exposed for 1 second of damage . 

2 . Defense pen / SCD .I am able to max his cooldown to 50% making his invulnerable state available to me as much as possible which is key to his survival in any fight . 

3. Defense pen / in invul shield or recovery max hp per 15 seconds . Superb if you can get % next damage attack also.playing around his invulnerable state you can have extremely long periods of not taking damage with the invul shield . With that in mind it also buys him time to heal back life if paired with max HP regain per 15 .  

4. He excels in all game modes and bosses . He is also the fastest stage clearer next to thanks . Yes even over proxima . Do to the nature of his kit which is completely aoe based with large arcing attacks . Auto also uses his abilities well prioritizing them fairly well. SL any stage he can play he will clear all the way to the top :).

5. BD / Ronan (L) / Shang chi or throot (ithanos) for world bosses .  For stage clearing if I'm not leveling someone I will use Proxima/ Black dwarf (L) / Corvus for auto runs . For Time line I use Sharon Rogers / BD (L)/ throot . I just avoid dr strange now haha . Otherwise it's a breeze or I just auto the fight . 

6. All other bosses are extreme cake walks . BD himself takes a long time but with good energy strikers it's fine . It is completely possible to kill ithanos without throot , but with him it makes it an extremely easy fight . His invulnerability is not effected by ithanos  debuff which is huge . Using the proper rotation you can get by without throot . I normally will use 1&gt;6&gt;1&gt;3 . This is the safest I have found . When you get ithanos rotations down you can use his much longer attack animation of 5 star . It's not easy without throot but it can be done . 

7. Idk armored BD or  infinity gauntlet BD haha . 

He's probably my favorite right after Ebony . Just a beast . Only character I'm totally safe with auto playing in timeline and BW. Excellent bang for your buck and everything hulk wishes he could be . He's a true terror and excellence addition to any team needing a physical damage dealer or tank . I was so excited to see an actual thread discussion on BD as I myself didn't have much information on him when I was investing in him save for one guy who posted some good information on him . Long live BD !!! If you wanna check out my BD or anyone below is my game name .

Silk T2 - Ebony Lead - gwenpool .

In general he can solo this but my formula for ithanos teams is this . 1 damage dealer (main hero ) / 1 runner ( fast hero that can outrun meteors or cancel them altogether - tank/invul hero ( Incase I do get caught in the meteors they can tank it for a switch later . 

With max cooldown you should be able to 5*&gt;6*&gt;5* the. Your vulnerable for maybe 1 second or half a second . Then rinse repeat . During meteor phase you should try your best to cancel his meteors altogether . If it doesn't cancel switch to silk cast shields or run. She's very fast .

My alliance knows he's my absolute favorite character and preach about him every chance I get . It's important for maximum survival to max his cooldowns . He is probably the best medium of all the BO characters . Most iframes great damage while delivering it safely . With a heal % obelisk he becomes extremely hard to kill as he can buy time in his iframes to constantly heal himself .  

He gets me 7/7 wins a week including ithanos . One of my easiest wins for each boss no question about it . Also a great character for battle world when paired with someone who can tank while he's out there in iframe . SL any floor he can enter he can win without issues I would save him for the later stages . 

Gear 1 - energy % per level first line and All attack every other line . This is very important for the simple fact that his summons scale from physical damage . 

Gear 2 - energy/phys % per level then all defense. 

Gear 3 - hp % per level first line and dodge or HP for the rest . I chose HP as it scales well with the obelisk I rolled for him which has a heal and HP % max . 

Gear 4 - max cooldown then your damage choice . I chose crit as it goes side by side with my obelisk that is crit damage . 

 Overdrive / POAH ISO set - no thinking here maximize damage ",2016-10-20 14:46:14+00:00,d90ccln,1.0,t3_58fmug,26206.0,future_fight

about 2-3 hours daily . 

2. Do you moderate any other subreddits? If yes, what are they?
No
3. What is wrong with /r/streetwear ? Would you do anything to improve it? 
There seems to be a lack of comradery . Sometimes people can also come off harsh and put down others instead of adding constructive ways to communicate there own opinions on subjects . Leading by example and creating ways to get constructive discussions about all things like our favorite designers all the way to basic constructions of garments .

4. What would you consider a bannable offence?
Any form of hate speech towards any group of people .Whether it be nationality, sexual preference or just opinionated differences . These are the kinds of things that create a bad reputation for the sub and decline in user base.
5. Do you think rule 5 in the sidebar is important? Why?
This is very important for many reasons . This is a place many come to for opinions and point of views . If they are constructive i believe they can be very helpful to most but generally some people can be put off if the message isn't clear making people shy away from this sub which has a great amount of potential .

6. Do you have any CSS experience? If so, to what level? (If possible, Please reference any examples of your CSS work here)
not enough to be applicable without brushing up on it .

7. Do you have any AutoMod experience?
no

8. A post has gone up and your gut says that it doesn't fit in the subreddit but you can't work out which rule it breaks. What do you do? 
I would most likely make the post private until i can consult a more seasoned moderated and discuss if this is appropriate or not .

9. What attribute do you think is most important to being a good mod?
 Communication and a positive attitude . Being able to be transparent with your user base goes a long way, as well as keeping your attitude upbeat can really change the vibe of the sub.

10. What timezone do you live in?
Eastern
11. Why do you want to be a moderator of /r/streetwear?

70,"I've learned a lot fighting black dwarf and now he is very easy for my teams to beat . First off I've never seen him enrage before his first physical immune shield.  Take this time to do what you must to deal damage and use iframes what not . Second is he normally will not enrage for me if I don't interrupt his abilities . What I mean by this is using an iframe in he middle of one of his attacks . If I allow him to slam the ground where he's stuck lifting it I can always use my iframe and the fight plays through normally . Some of my Heros can just beat the fight while she's enraged . Below is my list of teams for bd.

L- Ronan - Floki- fill = self explanatory it's Loki just run around and phase three with the spins swap toons to avoid damage or use iframes you have available . 

L- star lord - Wasp - Yondu - for this fight I use all wasps skills to avoid damage until first physical shield . After this I only use her ranged blaster skill . 2* I believe until he starts to spin in which point I'll use her iframes and swap freely . 

L- Hyperion - silk - carnage - hype ruins does most of the work here avoid all damage and use his 6 star until he enrages . At which point I use silks shield and carnage to avoid the spins and damage . 

L-Sharon Rogers - fill - fill = face tank no explanation here . Save three star for shield explosions and such . 

L - Ebony - fill - fill = max cool down allows him maybe 1 second of vulnerability . Just chain his 5-6 star  .

L hulk buster - Yondu ANAD - fill - I tried my hand with Yondu and was able to complete this with his uniform. Avoid his attacks and use his 5 star and cancel the end animation with his 6 star and walk away . Rinse and repeat . For enrage portion you want to use his 6 star while he spins into you then switch out .  

Strikers - I actually find movement speed characters extremely valuable for this fight try it out (wasp, vision)

Sharon Rogers T2 - on hit striker most valuable hero in game right now . 

Hyperion - On hit striker , hits hard and 6 star is extremely powerful . 

YONDU ANAD- surprising amounts of damage and another on hit striker  ( a lot of his abilities deal energy damage based on phys attribute ) 

Ebony - BO character hits hard . Energy based 

Sister Grimm - energy based and the largest boost to energy damage is always welcome 

Destroyer Uni - another energy based and boost 

Wasp - movement boost for slower characters and even fast ones . Makes it very easy to avoid his normal attacks . 

Special mention Vision - movement speed stack and energy based . Try it you might like how fast you can avoid damage . 

PS - quick mock up on my phone sorry for grammar and little detail.

- you have a fully mastered Loki . You should by now be able to take down proxi super G and ebony . Watch some videos I promise you are already capable . 

- if you have your hopes set on t2 Antman . Your gonna to need to invest heavily on getting On-Hit strikers with great damage . 

- Sharon Rogers is your best bet for on hit striker that will carry you most of the way as a support and solo character .

349,Oversized means it's suppose to fit you big but not in the same way as if something was a L and your actually a medium . This mostly has to do with measurements around the chest and sleeves .I tried on the bomber and it was true to size for the most part . I bought the waffle long sleeve in a medium (my size) and it was very long and sleeves were long but the cheat portion was perfect . So it really depends   These are meant to fit in a way to layer your cloths . The bomber being the shortest I believe .
