137,"Dark Souls. Hear me out.

So the entire game is built off of being unforgiving, and in soing so the game is really fuckin' hard. Good. Its a nice change of pace from most games.

But theres is a line.
A line established by its creators as a fairly thin yet rigid difference between unforgiving and unfair. This game is excellent, and I mean EXCELLENT at observing that line. It's a trial and error game, you have to die in order to progress and there's always a way to defeat your frustrations. Trouble with a boss? Summon some help from our lord and savior Solaire. keep getting toxin'd? Theres an item to cure it and a shield to counteract it. There's always an out, but you'll have to work for it. This is why i love this game, and why it frustrates me to no end when an event occurs that seems to be intended only as rage fuel. 

Little things, like, for example, the near-unavoidable cliff kicker skeleton on the way to Nito who, if placed elsewhere, would be frustrating but reasonable. But he's between the boss room and a ton of furious dog skeletons, and an unreasonable distance from the bonfire. In cases like that skeleton, it is no longer a matter of skill, it's a matter of making it to the cliff with enough estus to stand before the lord of the underworld and rolling the dice on being booted off a cliff.

Dark souls is fantastic and by a huge margin my favorite game, but it can just be so **infuriating** sometimes to lose your progress without feeling like you deserved it.",2016-04-21 19:19:53+00:00,d2c2zl8,1.0,t3_4fs7ge,35593.0,AskReddit
