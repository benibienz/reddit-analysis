Thanks to u/superemmjay and u/fenstapuza for suggesting I post this here.

EDIT: from u/superemmjay (so more can see it)

In the [AskReddit thread where this idea originated](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/42fqzx/what_is_something_from_a_video_game_that_you/), /u/Nermish_121 suggests that maybe, 

&gt; Maybe we all have the potential to save and load, but only a few of us actually know how.
&gt;
&gt; Maybe that's how the most influential people in history cane to power. How Hitler was never successfully assassinated. How the allies planned Normandy. How we made it to the moon with the equivalent of a cell phone.
&gt;
&gt; It all makes sense!
