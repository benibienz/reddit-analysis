    background: url(%%download%%) 19px;
    -webkit-animation: scroll 120s infinite linear;
    animation: scroll 120s infinite linear;&gt; }  

You can add an image to change it or delete the code to get rid of it.  Delete the other parts if you don't want it to scroll.  You just have to upload an image and replace the ""download"" text with the name of your uploaded pic.

Same goes with the sidebar images.  If you change the sidebar image you'll need to make sure the image you use is 300px or less.  Also, the bottom code used to make the bottom image on the sidebar may have to be adjusted if you change it.  You'd just have to increase or decrease the "".side .usertext-body{ padding-bottom: 165px"" number.  

Changing the troll face in the upper left hand corner is done in the ""subreddit settings"" on the sidebar.  Scroll to the bottom and ""reset to default"" to make it go away.  Or add one yourself.

&gt; You lied you repeatedly shown me proof that I threatened your sub. You need to substantiate. Cite the permalinks of your proof. How come you are not proving in /r/undelete?  

Because I've done it over and over again and you just hop on your delusion train and ride off into Tinfoilville.

Um, okay?  Who cares?  Your submission history reads like a schizophrenic in need of serious help.  And stop pretending like everyone is out to get you.  If you don't want this kind of attention in a sub that has thousands of subscribers then stick to your subs and stop making demands and saying ""I could sue"" such and such.  It's childish.  

&gt; ~~You~~ I should grow up ~~bully~~ and relax!  

FTFY.  Seriously, relax.  Stop making demands of everyone.  Like I said, if you want to be a crusader for TIs then do so.

You don't know what a hate sub is apparently.  

&gt; /r/tinfoilhats hates people who are sick from electromagnetic fields.   

It's a sub about having a laugh at tinfoil hats and those who wear them.  Jeez, you obviously lack humor.  Go find some.  Maybe smoke a bowl or something.

434,"&gt; You should have apologized for lying that the four health subs were dead. You should have investigated before making assumptions and broadcasting them.  

I never claimed all of them were dead.  Why the rage *son?*  

&gt; Read the post I cited about /r/topmindsofreddit taking over four health subs to learn the difference between my taking over /r/phoneaddiction.  

yep, I knew it.  Rant ahoy! kids!  

&gt; In my post, I explained /r/topmindsofreddit took over the four health subs to remove posts on adverse health effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF), remove my posts and ban the OPs of posts on EMF.  

You do realize I don't really have anything to do with that right?  I don't take over health subs.  I take over music subs, mainly, and try to revive them.  

&gt; Nor did I change the topics of the sub. Whereas, /r/topmindsofreddit brigaders changed the topics of the sub. /r/topmindsofreddit brigaders took over /r/moosearchives to delete the archives. Former /r/topmindsofreddit brigadier took over /r/naturopathy to delete all the posts and change the topic from pro naturopathy to anti naturopathy. Former /r/topmindsofreddit brigadier took over /r/neurology to change the topic from EMF adversely effects neurology by banning the topic EMF.  

Holy shit man, obsess much?  And since I'm not on any of those subs other than /r/moosearchive let me set you straight.  I was invited by a friend of mine who did take over /r/moosearchive.  I literally don't do shit there and if you'll look it's dead too.  I accepted the invite because of my friend.  Sorry if having friends triggers you.  

&gt; /r/phoneaddiction had four subscribers. It was dead. After taking over the sub, subscribers increased from four to 69. Whereas, majority of subs taken over by /r/topmndsofreddit don't grow. For example, /r/moosearchives, /r/cuntsofreddit, /r/naturopathy, etc.

440,"&gt;  /r/topcuntsofreddit has 40 readers  

Who don't read anything in the sub.  I guess you just don't understand.  That's okay.  

&gt; You still have not linked my ~~request~~ demand to crosspost the link posts, not screenshots.  

FTFY  

Listen I don't know why you can't just read what I have shown you.  If you had you wouldn't be claiming all of this.  Whatever, I don't have time for this.  

Again, please stop trolling these people.  So far your angry demands have done nothing but make you out to be a troll.  If you want to take people seriously then try to get along with people instead of spamming your subs and making demands no one wants to adhere to.  Seriously.   

&gt; /r/tinfoilhats is not a humor sub. Are you justifying bullying as humor?  

I would encourage anyone here to visit /r/tinfoilhats and see that it's just some funnies.  MWI doesn't have a sense of humor so don't take his angry word for it.  ROFL.  

Nice edit /u/microwavedindividual.  How many more times are you going to edit your comments?  

&gt; Your alibi for enjoying diversity does not explain your bullying me for asking /u/xandercruise to refute the youtube comment blaming mormons that he linked to by linking a youtube video.  

I didn't bully you for anything.  That's in your head.  Why should xander refute youtube comments though?  Have you seen normal youtube comments?  They're usually stupid as shit.  Pay attention to the content not the people commenting.

Why should I?  Anyone familiar with your trollish ways knows who I'm talking about.  Those profiles aka hit lists you like to make so much should answer that for you.  

&gt; For months you have been prying into my personal life. It is you who is attempting to doxx.  

I know literally nothing about you outside of reddit.  Hey, give me some slack at least I'm not calling you she or her like you hate so much.  I'm waaayyyy too lazy to doxx someone and honestly I've been doxxed repeatedly in the past, to the point I had to delete accounts, and I know how shitty it is to have that happen to you.  I wouldn't put anyone through that.

443,"&gt; You attempt to brainwash redditors by repeating lies.  

Wut?  Are you high or something right now?  

&gt; I never edited out username mentions. You have been unable to identify a single comment in which you accused me of doing so.  

I have identified several comments, before you edited them mind you, and have archived them for future use.  I just don't care at this point because you're obviously just trolling and being butthurt.   When you can calm down and be rational I'll happily show you how much evidence I do have.  

&gt; Do not reference me by a nickname. If you are do lazy to type my full name, don't write.  

Again, why are you so demanding?  Do you think demanding things from random people on the internet will help you somehow?  It just makes you look stupid.  Please stop trolling now.  

&gt; This is another example of you using an abbreviation, refusing to answer my question of what the abbreviation means and insulting me for asking. This is another example of your failure at being articulate. If you are too lazy to type out a term, don't write. Don't be a compulsive writer.  

Folks, this is all because mwi doesn't know what SJW means.  ROFL.  Dude, google it.  Obvious troll is obvious.  

&gt; What is SMH? Don't you have a qwerty keyboard? Type out words.  

You're on the internet yet you refuse to acknowledge internet slang.  How funny.  SMH means shake my head.  LOL.  Come on guy, get with the times.  

&gt; By telling me to go outside, you implied you know all about me and that I don't go outside. If you have read my torture reports, you would have realized I do go outside to earth and exercise. Daily.  

My bad bro.  Then stop getting all demanding of users of subreddits and go earth yourself.  Get some sun.  Vitamin D deficiency can cause many health issues.  

&gt; Asking me not to doxx is implying I have. I haven't. Stop unduly influencing redditors.

446,"&gt; /u/NewJerseyFreakshow is instigating another sub to bully in the subs I mod  

Do you not realize that subreddit is dead.  Literally no one goes there.  No one is going to go to your subs from there.  LOL.  

&gt; He linked to a screenshot of this post. Thereby, TotesMessengerBot could not notify us of the crosspost. Thereby, we would not know why shills from /r/topcuntsofreddit would be bullying, downvoting our posts and upvoting the brigade's posts in /r/targetedindividual.  

A lot of subreddits do this.  Of course you wouldn't know anything about that huh?  Do you even know how to Reddit?  

&gt; Half a year ago, I complained to the mods of /r/tinfoilhats of linking to a screenshot instead of the post.  

Yes you did and you bullied us in an attempt to make us shut down that sub.  I have proof but I'm so tired of linking it to you.  You also don't seem to read the proof which is not surprising.  

&gt; Newjerseyfreakshow has infiltrated /r/targetedindividuals.  

So let me get this straight.  I'm not allowed, according to you, to go to other subreddits even if I'm a subscriber because that constitutes ""infiltrating"" to you?  You once said I infiltrated /r/drama and /r/Subredditdrama which is laughable because I've been a subscriber of those subs before I even knew who you were.  By your logic any subreddit you comment in, outside of your three, is infiltrating.  **STOP INFILTRATING REDDIT BRO!**

Take your witch hunting drama elsewhere.  I reported this post since it violates Rule 3: **DON'T try to cause drama between members, this will get you removed from the sub.**

736,"&gt; If anyone here is actually bullying MWI, then that's pretty messed up, but I think it's pretty clear that that's not what's happening here.  

Agree.  

&gt; MWI certainly doesn't seem like they're afraid for their safety in any way. Honestly, I think we're more worried for MWI's safety...  

And those around mwi.  

What most people don't know is that mwi uses the age-old tactic of username mentioning someone, me for example, then when I respond mwi edits the username mention out of the comment.  mwi even says we ""infiltrate and derail"" threads because we comment but usually it's a subreddit we've been subscribed to for a while.

If you receive one of those mentions then just ignore it.  ",2016-05-10 19:52:16+00:00,d30ctpf,2.0,t1_d30ckxa,292.0,TopMindsOfReddit

I subscribe here moron and have for a while.  So am I not allowed to respond to your lies when you're in a sub I subscribe to?  You wanna bully me about that?  

&gt; Sole reason given for adding /u/badbiosvictim1 was based on a false premise that he is my alt account  

The cats out of the bag, everyone knows it's your alt.   

Evidence of his harassment and bullying: http://archive.is/P8nsR it's so stupid it's laughable.  And so full of lies.

Oh gosh, yet another sub I subscribe to.  I guess that means I ""infiltrated the sub"" right?  LOL.  The only description needed is to tell people ""look up /u/microwavedindividual's profile and then compare it to /u/badbiosvictim1's profile"".  It's so obvious it hurts.  Then again I also refer people to look at /u/badbiosvictim which is also obviously you.  LOL, no one cares you have alts.  I do too.  A lot of people do.

To quote the Rez himself:   
&gt; Speaking to The Sun's Something For The Weekend, the frontman said: ""[Producer Rick Rubin] called me to ask how I'd feel if Johnny Cash covered 'Hurt'. I said I'd be very flattered but was given no indication it would actually be recorded.

&gt; ""Two weeks went by. Then I got a CD in the post. I listened to it and it was very strange. It was this other person inhabiting my most personal song. Hearing it was like someone kissing your girlfriend. It felt invasive.""  

then  

&gt; Reznor also hailed Cash's cover as a great honour, saying: ""Having Johnny Cash, one of the greatest singer-songwriters of all time, want to cover your song, that's something that matters to me. It's not so much what other people think but the honour that this guy felt it was worthy of interpreting.

&gt; ""He said afterwards it was a song that sounds like one he would have written in the 60s and that's wonderful.""",2016-04-02 06:06:59+00:00,d1mqxd8,2.0,t1_d1mqugq,239.0,RockNRollMusic

Laughs, that's the only reason we need.  Sorry but this isn't some gubmint conspiracy.

Insecurity over what?

Do you not see the massive hole in that logic?

By that logic if you're featured on SRD and I make any comment whatsoever that doesn't justify your ""conspiracy theories"" then I must be there to brigade on behalf of TMoR?

&gt; As the only reason I know this tid-bit is because I messaged the mods directly for calling Bradley ""Chelsea"" in several threads and asked them about it. Otherwise you would deny any and all knowledge and go ""those guys are total liberals and would never say such a thing, I vouch for them and they're not going anyway!""  

Why would I ever call them ""total liberals""?  Gybe and jcm have said many things I disagree with.  And yes I know they're conservatives.

1695,"&gt; Nice. I like how you are bringing Sandy Hook into this AMA in an attempt to try and prove your point.  

Yeah I did because it's one of the ""this shooting is a hoax"" talking points you theorists usually bring up.  I was also using it as an example of the extremes of harassment some conspiracy theorists will go to.

&gt; it was a single eyewitness that said they saw 3 white men, I would tend to agree with you that it could have been wrong, and not credible. We are now at 4 eyewitnesses that have all corroborated the same story. At what point would you believe that it was 3 white men, and not a Muslim that did it? 10 witnesses?  

I'll let the authorities do their jobs and I'll base my opinion on the facts, not some possibly uncredible witness.

Last question.  And I hope this doesn't happen.  Are you going to start calling the victim's families and saying it's a hoax?

&gt; You are pobably a sockpuppet/new account of one of them, or maybe a new asshole who wanted to join the ""fun.""  

Can confirm, not a sockpuppet or new account of any of them.  I am however here for the fun of reading hilariously dumb comments of the Top Minds.  You specifically are hilarious.  Oh and yes, I'm a massive asshole.  But that's more your problem than mine since you're in MY sub.

LOL, *[right](http://i.imgur.com/nibk9Pn.gif)*.  I have a job with a rather large company, I have a great wife and wonderful daughter, and don't have time for trolling.  I run too many other subs to bother with that.  

Since you claim to ""I go out of my way to avoid Crew subreddits"" then why don't you actually stay true to that statement and leave?  I think you're the sad little troll with nothing to do so I don't expect you to actually keep your word.

It's a work in progress.  

&gt; two steel skyscrapers suddenly graciously drop from the skyline with more than 2000 humans in them from top to bottom in a way never seen before or since except in domino tower setups and pretty hard to replicate  

I wouldn't say graciously.  

&gt; The agencies responsible for the investigations shrug their shoulders, academia explains everything and nothing, politics invade and occupy foreign countries.  

I think those agencies shrug their shoulders at almost everything.  I'm not a 9/11 truther but I won't argue that some parts of our government are just crap.  

&gt; A bunch of silly ""Architects and Engineers"" run around with their thermite, talk of free fall and build cardboard models  

I've heard the thermite theories before.  At least they're more tolerable than the nukes theory or that holographic theory.  

&gt; How hard is it to convice you that there is no conspiracy?  

I take it you want me to answer my stance on the 9/11 thing?    

&gt; [Widespread Damage  

&gt; Claim: The first hijacked plane crashed through the 94th to the 98th floors of the World Trade Center's 110-story North Tower; the second jet slammed into the 78th to the 84th floors of the 110-story South Tower. The impact and ensuing fires disrupted elevator service in both buildings. Plus, the lobbies of both buildings were visibly damaged before the towers collapsed. ""There is NO WAY the impact of the jet caused such widespread damage 80 stories below,"" claims a posting on the San Diego Independent Media Center Web site (sandiego.indymedia.org). ""It is OBVIOUS and irrefutable that OTHER EXPLOSIVES (... such as concussion bombs) HAD ALREADY BEEN DETONATED in the lower levels of tower one at the same time as the plane crash.""  


&gt; FACT: Following up on a May 2002 preliminary report by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a major study will be released in spring 2005 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a branch of the U.S. Department of Commerce. NIST shared its initial findings with PM and made its lead researcher available to our team of reporters.  


&gt; The NIST investigation revealed that plane debris sliced through the utility shafts at the North Tower's core, creating a conduit for burning jet fuel—and fiery destruction throughout the building. ""It's very hard to document where the fuel went,"" says Forman Williams, a NIST adviser and a combustion expert, ""but if it's atomized and combustible and gets to an ignition source, it'll go off.""  


&gt; Burning fuel traveling down the elevator shafts would have disrupted the elevator systems and caused extensive damage to the lobbies. NIST heard first-person testimony that ""some elevators slammed right down"" to the ground floor. ""The doors cracked open on the lobby floor and flames came out and people died,"" says James Quintiere, an engineering professor at the University of Maryland and a NIST adviser. A similar observation was made in the French documentary ""9/11,"" by Jules and Gedeon Naudet. As Jules Naudet entered the North Tower lobby, minutes after the first aircraft struck, he saw victims on fire, a scene he found too horrific to film.  


&gt; ""Melted"" Steel  

&gt; Claim: ""We have been lied to,"" announces the Web site AttackOnAmerica.net. ""The first lie was that the load of fuel from the aircraft was the cause of structural failure. No kerosene fire can burn hot enough to melt steel."" The posting is entitled ""Proof Of Controlled Demolition At The WTC.""  


&gt; FACT: Jet fuel burns at 800° to 1500°F, not hot enough to melt steel (2750°F). However, experts agree that for the towers to collapse, their steel frames didn't need to melt, they just had to lose some of their structural strength—and that required exposure to much less heat. ""I have never seen melted steel in a building fire,"" says retired New York deputy fire chief Vincent Dunn, author of The Collapse Of Burning Buildings: A Guide To Fireground Safety. ""But I've seen a lot of twisted, warped, bent and sagging steel. What happens is that the steel tries to expand at both ends, but when it can no longer expand, it sags and the surrounding concrete cracks.""  


&gt; ""Steel loses about 50 percent of its strength at 1100°F,"" notes senior engineer Farid Alfawak-hiri of the American Institute of Steel Construction. ""And at 1800° it is probably at less than 10 percent."" NIST also believes that a great deal of the spray-on fireproofing insulation was likely knocked off the steel beams that were in the path of the crashing jets, leaving the metal more vulnerable to the heat.  


&gt; But jet fuel wasn't the only thing burning, notes Forman Williams, a professor of engineering at the University of California, San Diego, and one of seven structural engineers and fire experts that PM consulted. He says that while the jet fuel was the catalyst for the WTC fires, the resulting inferno was intensified by the combustible material inside the buildings, including rugs, curtains, furniture and paper. NIST reports that pockets of fire hit 1832°F.  


&gt; ""The jet fuel was the ignition source,"" Williams tells PM. ""It burned for maybe 10 minutes, and [the towers] were still standing in 10 minutes. It was the rest of the stuff burning afterward that was responsible for the heat transfer that eventually brought them down.""](http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a6384/debunking-911-myths-world-trade-center/)

2150,"&gt; Are there any conspiracy theories you believe to be true?  

Not any of the mainstream ones.  I'm not a 9/11truther, I don't believe in the Flat Earth theory, I'm not an anti-vaxxers, I'm obviously not a Sandy Hook truther or any variation of that, and I don't believe chemtrails are real.

I do however believe that UFOs are real.  I've always been a UFO lover.  Not that I believe there's some massive conspiracy going on but just that UFOs are an interesting subject that gives me hope that we're not the only ones in the universe.  Plus, I know many of the sightings from the 70s and 80s were actually classified military aircraft which is awesome because I love military tech.  I grew up in a family that did work on the TOW missiles, Patriot missiles, and the space shuttle itself.  I find that stuff fascinating.  

&gt; Are there any you want to believe but lack sufficient evidence to get you there?  

Not really.  I used to be a conspiracy theorist, hell I was a 9/11truther back in the day, but I grew up and decided to look at the ""claims"" myself.  Since then I'm hard to convince there's any conspiracy.  

&gt; Are there any that you find to be particularly plausible?  

Corporate conspiracies are very possible.  Those are some real conspiracies that can be backed up with evidence.  We read about that kind of stuff all the time.  Plus the life many of the corporate leaders live gives way to the possibility of collusion and involvement in financial conspiracies.

2226,"&gt; I think it's a problem that we should discuss and deal with. All of us in the skeptic/anti-conspiracy communities need to recognize that 4chan style trolling has proliferated all over including reddit. TopMinds isn't effected as much since most of the stuff there isn't racism related. But for those that are we need to be more careful with how things are handled  

Thanks for showing up bro.  I completely agree.

&gt; -Be skeptical of users who continuously cite specific other users (Example: the AlertaAntifa/Edsmith style back-and-forth where someone tries to draw attention to themselves)  
-Start ignoring the low hanging fruit. I'm talking about the 4chan style outrage trolling. Be wary of extreme hyperbole (GAS THE KIKES NOW, etc.)  
-Similar to above .. start ignoring low effort stuff. One sentence comments or single posts are low effort. Of course, Joshua Goldberg proved that even high effort can be fake trolling, but it's at least the first line of defense we can use to weed out the shit.  
-Start ignoring new/young accounts with little context to put their bigot posts. Start focusing established users who are spreading shit (ie. my post on /r/isrconspiracyracist regarding /r/conspiracy mods)
-Start ignoring ""the usual suspects"" .. see the /r/subredditcancer mod list.  
-Attach more substance. Instead of ""point and shame that person"" focus more on the content of their comments/posts and debunk or counter them. So that even if it is a troll there's at least some educational value.  

Awesome.  That's why I brought you on board with us on TMOR.  Thank you very very much nypd.",2015-10-06 01:38:55+00:00,cvpm72l,2.0,t1_cvpm342,173.0,NewJerseyFreakshow

Oh, I didn't know the AHS boss man joined you.  I thought about it, still do honestly.  But jcm doing what he did made me laugh and honestly, I have a hard time trusting you just as you have a hard time trusting me.  I don't blame you and I'm sure you don't blame me.    

&gt; It seems like you ""we hate conspiracy club"" types are reluctant and fearful of an open dialogue  

LOL, are you referring to /r/ihaterconspiracyclub?  Yeah, that's TMOR's little brother who died in utero.  Poor thing never had a chance.  I'll be honest, I know most of /r/conspiracy isn't racist.  How do I know that?  I actually have talked to some users from there/and mods and they can see what we see.  There are some groups of users that do push hard the racism thing into /r/conspiracy.  I'm sure some is trolling but I know for a fact some isn't.  

&gt; reluctant and fearful of an open dialogue about the fake-racism issue  

When it comes from you?  Yeah, we have a hard time taking you seriously.  But I think it's obvious parts of reddit have suffered from the trolls and I'm sure we'll be talking about it soon.

&gt; “Pro Wrestling Is Fake”

&gt; We have all kind of known this for a long time, right?  Well, now someone is actually leaking the results of pro wrestling matches on the Internet before they happen…

&gt; A fan has provoked a furor in the world of professional wrestling after leaking the outcomes of 38 WWE matches ahead of the pay-per-view bouts.

&gt; The mystery fan, who identifies himself online as Dolphins1925, claims he has obtained the information from a source at Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), and is revealing the results to highlight the organisation’s failure to keep its storylines confidential.

&gt; Dolphins1925 started posting the results on Reddit’s pro-wrestling forum after another fan launched a “prediction series”, asking users for their picks ahead of the matches. He has since maintained a perfect record, even leaking the results of contests involving wrestling superstars such as John Cena and The Undertaker.

&gt; once you start banning things, you enter a very dangerous slippery slope.  

Unless you're banning the subs for harassment outside of their subs or outside of reddit like coontown did.  Then I'd say it's justified.  A true hate sub will always find a way to spill out into other mediums.  That's why FPH was banned as well.  Doxxing is a nasty business.  

There are still plenty of subreddits who are racist that behave themselves.  I have no issue with that.  I don't like it but that's the way it is.  

&gt; Eventually somebody is going to personally dislike something that you love. Back off.

My only suggestions for this sub:  1) listen to your users.  I'll help with getting them here if you'd like.  I can mod here too if or whenever needed.  2) Keep fresh content going.  Trust me, it might take a long time for this sub to really take off but you can't stop posting or engaging users when they show up.  Sometimes it's hard too, because it gets really boring and cumbersome but when a user pm's you to say ""thanks for keeping the sub alive""...well that just makes it worth it for me.",2015-09-07 02:17:15+00:00,cut25om,1.0,t3_3g2yn4,2678474.0,cartoon_network

2437,"&gt; Deleting the subs and the subscribers does not delete real people, they will just make another account and participate in more mainstream subs 

That is true but once they participate in other more mainstream subs they're forced to obey the rules of that sub.  If not they're dealt with accordingly by the mods, admins, and often times the users.  

Note: FPH and coontown were banned because they wouldn't stop harassing and brigading other users and subs.  Trust me, we received a lot of that from them.  Had they behaved themselves I'm sure they might still be around.
