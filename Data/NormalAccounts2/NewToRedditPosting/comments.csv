1,"These two dreams happened within two days and are almost identical and I would like closure.

I have had two dreams where I was laying in my bed and I couldn't move. My eyes and mouth were stitched shut and I was being slammed on my bed and the first time I was hearing ""Why would you do this!?"" Repeated over and over while being slammed. And the second dream was almost the same except the female voice yelled ""You were responsible for this!"" And I felt the presence of others surrounding me.",2016-06-30 09:18:27+00:00,d4tr8co,1,t3_4p00wc,833047,Dreams

4,I lost it once when I was writing about a group of like 20 people were just all stranded together after the explosion of Earth itself. And they were all stuck together on a small space ship. And well... There was this one adorable couple and I decided to attempt to kill one of them off. And the words I were writing were just being typed from what felt like out of my own will and I looked at it. It was a lot sadder than I thought it would be.... I couldn't do it. All the characters felt like my children... I couldn't do it.,2015-10-31 05:54:17+00:00,cwj8msa,1,t3_3qxdyg,8653,writing

6,"I remember when I was in 7th grade this boy raised his hand. He had his hand raised for over ten minutes. And this was Sex-Ed and the teacher paused the video and looked at the boy and said ""What is your question?"" He said to her ""Do black people produce black semen!?"" I looked at my friend he looked back at me and I said to him. ""These are the types of people that shouldn't deserve to breed.""",2015-10-31 04:46:03+00:00,cwj7b1h,1,t3_3qw6wn,25348,AskReddit
7,And yes... I can forgive her. I always will forgive her... I have been told she is using me and she is asking for attention... But I give a damn about what they say. If she is only looking for attention. I will be that person to give her attention. But this seems like a whole lot more... I have just gotten selfish over this time. It sometimes will take her weeks to respond to simple messages I send her. I truly care about her. But I get worried because I feel like she is pushing me away forever... ,2015-10-31 04:08:45+00:00,cwj6gf9,2,t1_cwiawwx,53961,depression
8,"I know but these few things in a diagnosis have really began to boggle me.

impulsivity or failure to plan ahead;

consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to sustain consistent work behavior or honor financial obligations;

lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another.

It bugs me so much because I have these symptoms. But that is just a self diagnosis. I know shouldn't but. I have felt repeated actions of these. I honestly feel everything is about me and not anyone else. I haven't been caring for myself or routines. I don't know why. And I cannot even plan anything it just all falls apart.",2015-10-31 04:00:51+00:00,cwj69hx,2,t1_cwiawwx,53487,depression
