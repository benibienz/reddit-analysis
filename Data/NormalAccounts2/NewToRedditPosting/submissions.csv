My vivid dreams are generally nightmares and I would like some interpretation of them and possibly a way to remember dreams more often.

Interpretation

I have had two dreams where I was laying in my bed and I couldn't move. My eyes and mouth were stitched shut and I was being slammed on my bed and the first time I was hearing ""Why would you do this!?"" Repeated over and over while being slammed. And the second dream was almost the same except the female voice yelled ""You were responsible for this!"" And I felt the presence of others surrounding me. My most recent dreams were this year. One was where a friend of mine told me to go check my Discord chat and everything had a deep blue tint to it and I asked him what was wrong with my PC and he said maybe I should take a break so I walked out of my room and I looked in the mirror and my hair was a deep red and I asked him what was going on and next thing I know my mind skipped to me being outside. We were both hardly even the same, hair was different, bodies were different. And we walked around. And then everything turned red, and I was then in the dark. And my body slowly became paralyzed until I couldn't move and my eyes were stuck together like the last two dreams and I was screaming for help. That was the end of that dream which leads to the one I had this month, I had a dream that me and all of my friends were enlisted to the army, I didn't care and one of my friends were panicky and which they then dispatched us and we were in a helicopter. My panicky friend then took a gun and shot himself and we went on like nothing happened. It was strange more than scary. And I am trying to understand if these dreams have connections.",Dreams,"I don't remember my dreams a lot, but when I do they are really vivid",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/4qkqgo/i_dont_remember_my_dreams_a_lot_but_when_i_do/

I haven't went to the restroom for a month now. I need to use the restroom. My family has just put me on Laxatives. I from time to time have to wipe. I have these constant pains in my stomach which feel like someone is pushing down on me. I want to use the restroom but I feel like it will hurt too much. I don't want to take a risk. Are there safer alternatives of getting this stool out of me? Be it medication or anything. I just want to know. It doesn't give me extreme pain. It just gives me this pushing feeling on my stomach from time to time. I don't want it to get worse. I would appreciate some help or advice.,AskDocs,"15, Male, 5'4"" 160 Lbs.

I started helping this sweet girl out of depression. And she was single. And just recently her friends all left her and she had no one to go to. She just got upset at me. And she shut me out of her life. I am so confused. I have always been there for her. And upon that whenever we talk it is always small talk. I miss the conversations we used to have. And now I am here trying to build a meaningless relationship up with this other girl I met just a few weeks ago. And she ending up pushing me away. I am rebounding off of my losses. I just am taking this awfully. I have now lost all care for anything. I now have went from being able to talk to people normally to feeling awkward around anybody. I have honestly lost faith in people because of this... I have stopped caring for myself... Every night when I sleep I feel this utter loneliness within me. It sends chills down my spine every night. 

Edit: I am beginning to think I have ASPD (Anti-Social Personality Disorder) But I can't assume it. So I will try and just tough it out.

Edit 2: I don't know what to do in the mean time. I don't have much to do in life but my rinse and repeat cycle. I don't get joy out of doing simple tasks.

Now for the issue. I have a good clump of characters about 19 of 'em and the issue is I have a few ships that I have planned... But they all end up feeling too forced I was planning to atleast write all of the guys point of views which I planned to be about 6 chapters each. And it is hard to make a relationship work between two characters in six chapters... So I begin to cut corners in their path to a relationship and once I get their point of view done. Which takes about a week. I wipe the sweat off of my brow and look at the work. I imagined it in my head to look genuine but then I read it... It comes out seeming robotic... And I feel like I should just scrap it and start from the beginning...

It almost feels like if you were to walk into a celebrity's house and hear them jamming out to their own music. You look at them awkwardly and think. Okay.... Your a little full of yourself...
