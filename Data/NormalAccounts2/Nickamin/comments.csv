107,"What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know Mack was one of the top in NFL in sacks, and he's been involved in numerous blitz packages on the AFC West, and he has more than 10 years to play. He is trained in multiple defensive packages and has gone to GOAT level. You are nothing to him but just another target to sack. He will wipe you the fuck out with power the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to him over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak he is training new plays in the playbook and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. He can be anywhere, anytime, and he can sack you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with one hand. Not only is he extensively trained as a DE, but he has access to the entire arsenal of the Raider's Playbook and he will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it.

194,"After playing a couple matches as someone completely new to this game, there are things I liked and disliked.

One thing I like is the mechanics of the game.  The third person view moba style that is not like smite but more epic of a match. 

Another thing I liked is the card system. Although the UI/artwork of the cards and the G screen I think need major changes, the card concept is pretty cool that give you something to grind for that isn't just getting new heroes since we get them for free.

One of the biggest things of the game that felt off was the pace of the game.  The attack and movement speed didn't seem right to me. It might be something to get used to but it felt so slow. Also spells and skills I think should stand out a bit more, but that's just my opinion. 

Overall I think this game will head in a great direction once they iron out a few of the kinks and add more features.  What do you think?",2016-03-19 00:34:28+00:00,d156yhx,1.0,t3_4ayj5f,36242,paragon
