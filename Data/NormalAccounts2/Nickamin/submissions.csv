Aside from that a couple suggestions from only a single day of playing (obviously with a grain of salt)

1.  The hero selection interface I think can be changed a bit.  I was very confused with what EX abilities were and still haven't used them because I found out about them the next day on a stream.  Which gets to number 2.

2.  A more in-depth tutorial which shows these EX abilities and orbs with descriptions.  I just got the very basics and thats it.  Maybe an advanced tutorial?

3.  Skins are a bit underwhelming in my opinion.  I thought legendary and epic skins will be a huge difference, but think they can use a bit more.

4.  Not sure if anyone is with me on this, but spell detail.  Something that looks a bit more pronounced and dramatic.

I have an Xbox1/WiiU/PC with medium-end graphics/3DS.

I am looking for a game to play!

Couple of things to note:

1.  The 2 games I am thinking the MOST of playing is Fallout4/MGSV.  Unfortunately have not played any of the ones before it.

2.  Favorite game of all time is probably Dark Souls 1/2.

3.  I am not the best at FPS games unless it is a heavily story based one. (Loved Borderlands 2)

4.  I love JRPGs and RPGs, all the Final Fantasys, used to be a big WoW player, now I spend most of my time on HotS and Hearthstone.  

5.  I do not like games that are too easy or don't have the best replay value.

6. I do not like Skyrim.
