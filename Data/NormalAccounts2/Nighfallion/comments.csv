1,"Yeah I missed out on ""this turn"" didn't I? that is my bad. Tyvm I wouldn't have caught it without you.

Okay I'm fixing the card and updating OP post:

2,"That specific text means that the cost reverts to 4 after each player's turn btw. I think you are confused about that. Nerubian Prophet: {At the start of your turn, reduce this card's cost by (1).}. Volcanic Lumberer: {Taunt. Costs (1) less for each minion that died this turn.}. Solemn Vigil: {Draw 2 Cards. Costs (1) less for each minion that died this turn.}. Also the cost reduction trigger per effect not per minion healed. In other words, Circle Healing 3 minions will only reduce the cost by 2.",2016-08-10 19:46:25+00:00,d6c8u9x,4,t1_d6c8jcy,379,hearthstone
3,"The above comment is in reference to 
[&gt;&gt;&gt;Cards v1.0&lt;&lt;&lt;](http://i.imgur.com/wnrJIPx.png).

I thought alot about Maiden's effect. To play it on curve (at 3 mana) you need to run Flash Heal or have the coin which loses you a card early. The healing is negligible since Priests needs the health to last to turn 5 with decent health to hope to clear Zoo's board. The effect is meant to be very strong so that the threat of this card causes other classes to use burn on the Priest's face early allowing Priest's other early minions to stay alive. However, perhaps drawing 2 cards is too much. Drawing 1 card might be better now that I think about it.

I fixed Beneditus' Agent to the correct card stats. Thanks.

Bouncer was also made with zoo in mind as well. I don't like the fact that the return minions to the opponent's hand is viewed as a Rogue effect. Hearthstone's Sap doesn't really match its WoW counterpart. Sap in WoW is more of a freeze effect. I really don't get it. I also thought about making the bouncer a 1/2, but it felt too weak. In the current meta you will often hit a 1 drop with the effect much more commonly, so the effect won't be that good. I can't make it only target 1 drops since some decks do not run a single one.",2016-08-10 19:30:06+00:00,d6c821i,2,t1_d6c6tvx,1507,hearthstone
4,"I agree. Regardless of how good the review is, a comparison review at this point is click baiting. Not to say that the review does not have good value, but the title itself is meant to make someone supporting one side or another watch it out of frustration. After all, versus implies a clash, a conflict. If the author did not want to bank on our favoritism of one title over the other, then the title should be be along the line of ""Reviewing 2 KMMO Coming to the West (BDO and BnS)."" Take what you can from the review, and there are good infomation to take from it, but do realize you are being manipulated into clicking the link.",2016-01-09 11:34:06+00:00,cyrpg4y,2,t1_cyr8u5l,42106,blackdesertonline

6,"Wow. After watching this video a second time, I can confirm that this scrub has nothing to brag about. Here's why:

1. Learn to count: It is Ninja vs 2 (a Ranger and a Valkyrie)

2. Before ganking put away your pets scrub especially since they give away your position when hiding like a bitch.

3. It should be [PVPVE] since he pulled mobs the two were questing on in hopes that the Ranger aggros them like a noob (which she does and hence you stood a chance)

4. He clearly have better gear and level as evidence by the fact that the mobs they are questing on didn't aggro him.

5. He tried to fight a Valkyrie from the front instead of outmaneuvering her to get sweet back damage like a real ninja.

This reminds me of old WoW Rogue ganking videos. Since people don't know better, they can try to pretend to be a badass.",2016-01-02 04:42:48+00:00,cyizvcm,1,t3_3z0986,66976,blackdesertonline
7,"Sounds like full release is going to be out around March at this rate. Polish is nice, but a big part of me wants the game to release now. The reasonable side of me knows to be patient, so here's hoping I can survive BDO withdrawal long enough to see the game releases ;).",2016-01-02 04:09:57+00:00,cyiyx8v,1,t3_3z28f8,22910,blackdesertonline
8,"I'm pretty sure this guy is trolling. No one is this stupid right? There are barely any similarity between witcher's combat and BDO's. Granted I haven't played the warrior class, but this game's combat is much more refreshing and fluid unlike Witcher's slow, archaic, and boring combat. More importantly this game has choice in what style of combat you use. Just because you think your shitty Witcher game's combat is good doesn't mean another RPG's action combat system is inspired by it kid.",2015-12-31 13:00:52+00:00,cyh8tlf,5,t1_cyh7ou0,4619,blackdesertonline
9,"I had the same feeling when I started CBT1 as a Ranger which was a big mistake. Although I love class complexity, I wanted to try and create the prettiest character I could to test the character creation. Needless to say the simple combat Ranger offered was very boring and made me feel like I wasted so much time hyping this game up in my mind. The next day even with the bitter taste of disappointment in my mouth, I went back with a fresh attitude and created a Sorceror. Sorcerors have plenty of both ranged and melee skill. I went the melee route, and oh boy, the difference in class complexity changed my outlook of the game completely. My advice to you: if you think the combat is boring hit up a more complex class before you write the combat off. I love combat as a Sorceror and hope Valkyrie's combat will be complex as well. Some classes are there for people who like simplicity in their combat, but that is not for everyone such as myself and mayhaps you as well.",2015-12-31 11:32:55+00:00,cyh7j7z,1,t3_3ywdb1,3866,blackdesertonline
10,"Welp, that is where you are wrong sir. There are npc bandits already in the game that tries to rob you. They can easily be outrun at the early levels, but I am not sure if this'll be the case later on.",2015-12-30 20:43:28+00:00,cygiwi0,5,t1_cyb3lng,441078,blackdesertonline
11,"Although I don't agree with how agressively this guy is telling you off, he is fundamentally correct in doing so. You should ask about the game first before you shit talk. Asking about the game now just proves you are an ignorant loudmouth who didn't bother to research or ask. You are entitled to your ill-formed opinion, but we are also entitled to calling you out.",2015-12-24 12:38:08+00:00,cy9z331,5,t1_cy9y7u8,3691,blackdesertonline
12,"You really have no idea what you are talking about do you? If they left banditry run rampant then alot of internet dicks like yourself touting the ""survival of the fittest"" excuse would ruin an integral mechanic, NPC trading and material transport. Trading profit margins are thin enough without gigantic risks of losing all your merchandise. While on the other hand, a bandit's long-term profit would be many times the initial investment (wagon/ship to haul the booty). It isn't about being carebear, but protecting a mechanic that the developers put time into from breaking on day-1.",2015-12-23 20:31:41+00:00,cy9b316,3,t1_cy90k7z,16704,blackdesertonline
