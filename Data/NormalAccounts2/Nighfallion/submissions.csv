Please tell me what you guys think. FYI. I don't know that much about Warcraft's lore of Karazhan. Every lore thing connecting these cards to Karazhan was google searched, so please tell me of any discrepancies lore wise. The art belongs to their orginal creators and was found on google image search.

-4 Mana 3/5 -&gt; Costs (2) Less for each time a character is healed this turn. Battlecry: If your hero's Health is full, draw a cards.

-2 Mana 2/3 -&gt; Stealth. Battlecry: If your hero's Health is full, this card gain +1 Health.

-2 Mana 2/3 -&gt; Battlecry: Return a minion that costs 1 Mana Crystal to your opponent's hand.


I used the condition ""If your hero's Health is full"" to make sure that these cards will be stronger in the early game and weaker in the late game. Also I am using that condition as an incentive for priest to play more healing cards (I mean the class IS Priest after all). I feel like these cards are a tad too strong, but at the same time I feel that Priest really need much stronger early game cards than the rest. This is also my first attempt at making any cards, but please feel free to give me your honest feedback :D.",hearthstone,Some Cards Inspired by One Night in Karazhan's Uninspiring Priest Cards.,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/4x3r5c/some_cards_inspired_by_one_night_in_karazhans/
