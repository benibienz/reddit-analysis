I bought a cheap IDE to SATA adapter to use an IDE optical drive on my newer motherboard.  
 The drive isn't detected in the UEFI.  
 I've tried all of the jumper settings and 2 different drives that work in other PCs.  
I tested the SATA cable and it works just fine.  
The drive is getting its own power (can eject and seek) and I've plugged in the adapter's floppy power connector.  
The SATA controller is set up in AHCI mode (all ports have to be set to one mode so I can't just switch the optical drive's port to IDE emulation mode).

My adapter looks like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/IDE-SATA_ADAPTER.jpg), except it's only got 1 SATA connector.  
It also has a [switch](http://i.imgur.com/Mb0IlPg.jpg) on it (sorry for the quality, my phone's camera sucks). Any ideas what it could do?

Any help is appreciated, thanks.

It turns out that it's possible. I just had to reboot into my UEFI to activate it.

I rarely reboot my PC. The last boot was probably for installing the latest Windows 10 Insider build. Since then I've updated my GPU drivers without rebooting and everything worked fine.

So I rebooted, enabled that feature in my UEFIâ€¦

**And everything went to shit after Windows booted to the desktop.**

After a few seconds of properly rendering the desktop artifacts popped up so I did a hard reset manually. I disabled the multimonitor featureâ€¦

**And the same thing keeps happening.**

Since my Linux install still worked I booted Windows into Safe Mode to uninstall the GPU drivers with DDU.

After uninstalling them and rebooting everything worked fine again (if that's how you can call our good friend, the MS Basic Display Adapter). I downloaded the Nvidia drivers and installed them. Everything still worked fine - f.lux started working again, the GPU was recognized and I could probably even play a game (I didn't try). I rebooted to see if it worked for sureâ€¦

Nope, artifacting. This time I waited long enough for a VIDEO_SCHEDULER_INTERNAL_ERROR BSoD to pop up. I reinstalled drivers again the same way, but this time I installed the previous version. Nope, still the same. Hello DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL my old friend, I've come to bang my head aganist you again. Haven't seen you since Vista, how've you been?

Because the artifacts occured when executing startup programs, happened only on the Nvidia driver and were yellow(ish) I thought it might be f.lux's fault so I uninstalled it and reinstalled the current Nvidia drivers. Nah, it's still fucked.

So, do any of you have any ideas what might be causing the artifacting and crashes? I'm using the newest Insider build (14352).

TL;DR: No drivers good, Nvidia drivers before rebooting good, Nvidia drivers after rebooting fucked.

I'll respond to you in about 6 hours, it's midnight here, I'm bored of troubleshooting and I just need some sleep.

I think I'll try reverting to the previous build tomorrow, but I'd like to try other things first.",pcmasterrace,Asking for help in identifying a problem with my Windows installation.,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4lmi61/asking_for_help_in_identifying_a_problem_with_my/

My friend was complaining about bad battery life on his Nexus 5, and I told him that's probably because he never considered a factory reset after updating it. Still, my Nexus 7 loves to do weird stuff that can easily be fixed by clearing the cache. It's painless and quick. I told him that I can do it and he trusted me - maybe because of my phone dual booting different ROMs and my Linux laptop. I enter recovery mode and there it is - ""wipe cache partition"". I select it and confirm.... and it's stuck. It should take 2 seconds, not 2 minutes so I rebooted the phone and it entered a bootloop (a soft brick when the phone only gets to the boot animation). I go into recovery and it can't mount /cache... This is bad. Really bad. The only way I could repair it was to do a factory reset and he didn't back anything up... and even this might not be enough. With my phone/tablet I'd just use Google's factory images (you can use them to replace any partition of a Nexus to the factory state) to repair the partition, but he's got a locked bootloader. Unlocking it means FULL WIPE. I knew I fucked up. He got mad at me, took the phone and went to the nearest repair shop. I don't blame him for not trusting me anymore. The moment he walked out I started to google WHY did this happen? I found out it's \\\\**WIZARD TALK AHEAD**\\\ because of his updates - basically, Android's runtime changed between 4.4 and 5.0 - and when I wiped one of the cache partitions there was a conflict with the old runtime's remains in the second partition. When you do a factory reset 3 things are wiped - your /data with the exception of /data/media (your apps), /cache and the dalvik cache - I only wiped /cache. Normally it's just not a full wipe, but in this case the two caches were too different to work. \\\\**WIZARD TALK END**\\\ He came back and the first thing that I said was that I'll pay him back with 50% extra. But they wiped the phone and he had no backups... He lost 2 years of photos that he really didn't want to lose. And it's because of me. It works now because it's pretty hard to kill a Nexus, but the data won't come back.  
At least the battery drain is fixed.

TL;DR: wanted to fix a battery drain, broken a phone's OS. And fixed the drain.",tifu,TIFU by trying to help my friend with his phone.,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3okug9/tifu_by_trying_to_help_my_friend_with_his_phone/

We haven't really come far in these 3 years since the N4. I'll compare what has changed between the Motorola Droid from 2009, the Nexus 4 from 2012 and the standards of 2015 to explain what I mean.

**2012-2015**  
1. We have moved from ~720x1280 screens to 1080x1920 and 1440x2560, but 1440p isn't really that good (battery life) and the difference between 1080p and 720 isn't as pronounced as the change from 240 to 320 PPI.  
2. Do you really need all that RAM? 2GB is enough. Sure, it's nice to have more, but the difference between 4GB and 2 is just not as big as 1 and 2.  
3. A 2012 SoC is still good enough today - by good enough I mean almost no slowdowns on the newest OS. The S4 Pro used in the N4 is close to a mid end SoC in today's phones, like the Moto G. And I don't think a Moto G is slow.  


**2009-2012**  
1. The Droid had a pretty good screen - instead of a 320x480 3.5 inch screen it had a 480x854 3.7 inch display. 240 PPI was really good compared to the old 160 PPI. The Nexus 4 is the 2nd Nexus with a 320 PPI screen which made individual pixels almost invisible... unless you looked closer. In day to day use you don't really stick your phone 5cm in front of your face, however, so 320 DPI looks pretty nice.  
2. The Droid had 256MB of RAM. The N4 has eight times as much.  
3. The 600MHz OMAP3430 just can't compare to a quad core 1.5GHz Snapdragon S4 Pro. It's just too slow if you want smooth animations.

The phones we use haven't changed as much since 2012 as they did before. You can still use a Galaxy S3 today, but the low amount of RAM is a bit painful. The Optimus G or Xperia Z are still decent phones today. But the original Samsung Galaxy or HTC Hero in 2012? Welcome to the world of stuttering, waiting and stuttering. So if you have a limited budget and a 2012/2013 phone - don't upgrade unless you really have to.",AndroidMasterRace,Why I'm probably not upgrading from my Nexus 4 any time soon.,https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidMasterRace/comments/3ncb3g/why_im_probably_not_upgrading_from_my_nexus_4_any/

The 2 year dev time for a large multiplayer focused title? Trailers that made so many people preorder, hoping for a good game? The unplayable state on release? The broken netcode? This game will kill DICE just as SimCity 2013 killed Maxis. It will, just like BF4, cause many lawsuits etc. which for EA means that DICE is no longer a viable studio and that's totally not their fault - employees can work 24/7 and sleep under their desks, amirite? I don't want to hate on DICE, they're a great studio, but EA will fuck this game up. They're not gamers. They just want profit. They don't care about games, they only care about their wallet - remember that.

In 2013 EA fucked up - SimCity and Battlefield 4 were awful on release. Because of enforcing awful DRM (and other things like less content than the previous games - JUST LIKE BATTLEFRONT) SimCity was a failure and led to the death of Maxis.

In 2014 Ubisoft took the spotlight by releasing broken/rushed/overhyped/boring games. People forgot about EA.

Now, in 2015 it's EA's time to be hated again. Battlefield Hardline had very little content to justify the $60 price tag. Battlefront is completely overhyped and will probably kill DICE.

DO NOT PREORDER.
