A strange mishmash of a movie, half a political drama, half a slightly noiry detective film, about a dying president who wants to change the secretary of state. Otto Preminger directs, based on a novel, big cast, sober, interesting, the sort of movie that rarely gets made today. Worth a go.

***6/10***

&gt; It was Charles Laughton's last film; he was suffering from cancer during filming, and died six months after the film's release. There was genuine lingering animosity between him and Fonda, stemming from his having directed Fonda in the 1954 Broadway production of The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial, during which production, Fonda had insulted Laughton, and made sneering reference to his homosexuality, according to Elsa Lanchester and others.

246,"&gt; Since the rise of publishing conglomerates, many literary novelists unwilling to pander, as Jonathan Franzen has, to the popular audience have been publishing with these independent presses. But in the last decade, very few works from small presses have been finalists, and only one, Jaimy Gordon’s Lord of Misrule, has won.  
&gt; 
&gt; This year, not a single book from an independent press made the fiction long list. By contrast, the Booker prize winners this year and last were published in Britain by a small press.

This is usually accomplished by a process known as retting, where fully ripe red pepper berries are soaked in water for about a week, during which the flesh of the pepper softens and decomposes. 

Rubbing then removes what remains of the fruit, and the naked seed is dried. Sometimes alternative processes are used for removing the outer pepper from the seed, including removing the outer layer through mechanical, chemical or biological methods.


Ground white pepper is used in Chinese and Thai cuisine, but also in salads, cream sauces, light-coloured sauces, and mashed potatoes (where black pepper would visibly stand out).

A strange strange cop tale, based on a Scandinavian crime thriller back long ago. Walter Matthau and Bruce Dern. Essentially a trail of a serial killer who shoots up buses. 

I can't really place it, so strange in tone, half melancholic, half shooty up e, has anyone seen it?

**Khartoum (1966)** (Dir  Basil Dearden, Eliot Elisofon)

Charlton Heston is Gordon of Khartoum in a film that was not what I remembered from my childhood. Fascinating story and a great spectacle, although it does lag a bit, worth a watch if you are into historicals. 

**The Caine Mutiny** (1954, dir Edward Dmytryk )

1282,"These swords represent the final stage in the trend of increasing size that started in the 14th century. In its developed form, the Zweihänder has acquired the characteristics of a polearm rather than a sword. Consequently, it is not carried in a sheath but across the shoulder like a halberd.


Due to their size and weight—typically at least 1.4 m (4 ft 71⁄8 in) long and with a weight of over 2 kg—Zweihänders require two hands; as such they require at least 25 cm (9.84 in) for the grip. Zweihänders above 4 kg are considered to be more ceremonial than practical.

Frisian hero Pier Gerlofs Donia is reputed to have wielded a Zweihänder with such skill, strength and efficiency that he managed to behead several people with it in a single blow. The Zweihänder ascribed to him is, as of 2008, on display in the Fries Museum. It has a length of 213 cm (84 in) and a weight of about 6.6 kg (141⁄2 lb).[4]

The point is immediately after it passed over 1.2 million expressed regret that they voted to leave.

2343,"There are several areas on the dog's body where you may be able to feel the pulse. A pulse occurs with every heart beat. Sometimes, you can just place your hands low on your dog's chest, near the elbow joint, and feel the heart beats. You can count how many beats you feel in 15 seconds and then multiply it be 4. That will give you the pulse.
A second place to find the pulse is high on the inner side of the thigh. You will be feeling for the femoral artery. Place two fingers on the middle of the thigh near where the leg joins the body. What you feel is the 'femoral pulse.' The femoral pulse can be very difficult to feel in cats.

It is always best to use your fingers to feel the pulse. If you use your thumb, and press too hard, what you feel will actually be your own pulse.

The normal pulse for a dog ranges from 70 to 180 beats per minute. In general, the larger the dog, the slower the pulse. Puppies generally have a fast pulse, up to 220 beats per minute. Cats usually have a pulse of 120-240 beats per minute.

The pulse of a dog is not always steady. Sometimes, the rate changes as the dog breathes in and out. The pulse will be faster on inspiration and slower on expiration. This is normal and is called sinus arrhythmia.",2016-07-12 15:44:46+00:00,d59aw33,2.0,t1_d59agbq,552.0,gifs

2451,"Among the Kwakwaka’wakw people of the Pacific Northwest, the Hamatsa were a secret society. This society exercised a ritual often called a “cannibal” ritual, and some debate has arisen as to whether the Kwakwaka’wakw do or do not practice ritual cannibalism, whether their “cannibalism” is purely symbolic, or literal.

The Hamatsa initiate, almost always a young man at approximately age 25, is abducted by members of the Hamatsa society and kept in the forest in a secret location where he is instructed in the mysteries of the society. The initiate fasts to clear his mind and bathes in icy-cold waters to purify his spirit. This is necessary so he will lose his human scent. Only a person who has properly prepared himself can get closer to the spirits. Shortly before the end of his exile, the initiate was brought a corpse to finish the ritual.

The corpse was one of the Kwakwaka’wakw dead members. They used to bury their dead on trees. The body was placed in a box, and these boxes were placed on branches a considerable distance up a tree. There the boxes were piled one on top of the other. The bodies, when so exposed to the action of the freely circulating air, mostly mummify. A corpse is taken down from the tree and is soaked in salt water. The shaman takes hemlock twigs, the leaves of which have been removed, and pushes them under the skin, gradually removing all the decayed flesh until nothing but the skin remains. 

After this is done the body is placed on top of the small hut in which the novice (initiate) is living while he is staying in the woods. The hands of the body hang down. Its belly is cut open and spread with sticks. The initiate was expected to smoke-cure the bound corpse for the final ritual. During the ritual the aspirant and the senior members of the brotherhood (Hamatsa) devoured portions of the corpse.

The initiate in the picture is wearing a mask, which were a vital part of Kwakwaka’wakw art and culture. The mask was crucial in dances in order to portray the character conveyed by the dancer. As such, a wide array of masks exist, depicting mythological beings, animals, forces of nature, and other humans. Cedar bark is commonly used to form a “mane” around hamatsa masks.

Cannibalism usually takes the form of endocannibalism – ritual consumption of parts of the dead as a way to honor them. Exocannibalism, while far rarer, is also ritual in nature: eat parts of your enemies to gain their power. Either way, it’s not done for nutritional. In some other cultures the cannibalism was more frequently a product of hostility (often in the immediate aftermath of a battle) in which the dead were eaten as a means of inflicting further humiliation on them, culminating in them being turned into excrement.

2482,"Among the Kwakwaka’wakw people of the Pacific Northwest, the Hamatsa were a secret society. This society exercised a ritual often called a “cannibal” ritual, and some debate has arisen as to whether the Kwakwaka’wakw do or do not practice ritual cannibalism, whether their “cannibalism” is purely symbolic, or literal.

The Hamatsa initiate, almost always a young man at approximately age 25, is abducted by members of the Hamatsa society and kept in the forest in a secret location where he is instructed in the mysteries of the society. The initiate fasts to clear his mind and bathes in icy-cold waters to purify his spirit. This is necessary so he will lose his human scent. Only a person who has properly prepared himself can get closer to the spirits. Shortly before the end of his exile, the initiate was brought a corpse to finish the ritual.

The corpse was one of the Kwakwaka’wakw dead members. They used to bury their dead on trees. The body was placed in a box, and these boxes were placed on branches a considerable distance up a tree. There the boxes were piled one on top of the other. The bodies, when so exposed to the action of the freely circulating air, mostly mummify. A corpse is taken down from the tree and is soaked in salt water. The shaman takes hemlock twigs, the leaves of which have been removed, and pushes them under the skin, gradually removing all the decayed flesh until nothing but the skin remains. After this is done the body is placed on top of the small hut in which the novice (initiate) is living while he is staying in the woods. The hands of the body hang down. Its belly is cut open and spread with sticks. The initiate was expected to smoke-cure the bound corpse for the final ritual. During the ritual the aspirant and the senior members of the brotherhood (Hamatsa) devoured portions of the corpse.

The initiate in the picture is wearing a mask, which were a vital part of Kwakwaka’wakw art and culture. The mask was crucial in dances in order to portray the character conveyed by the dancer. As such, a wide array of masks exist, depicting mythological beings, animals, forces of nature, and other humans. Cedar bark is commonly used to form a “mane” around hamatsa masks.

Cannibalism usually takes the form of endocannibalism – ritual consumption of parts of the dead as a way to honor them. Exocannibalism, while far rarer, is also ritual in nature: eat parts of your enemies to gain their power. Either way, it’s not done for nutritional. In some other cultures the cannibalism was more frequently a product of hostility (often in the immediate aftermath of a battle) in which the dead were eaten as a means of inflicting further humiliation on them, culminating in them being turned into excrement.

3314,"&gt; Harder to do if, for instance, you don't have the money to support yourself while doing it.

That's my point. The guys I know went and did it. Worked, saved, spent, lost it, all gone, lucky to get into a festival. 

&gt; This is only an option for the very wealthy. 

You can make a movie for a couple hundred bucks these days. 

&gt; Working class women don't have money to spend on films, which is why they need grants.

Yet the men somehow went and did without their grants - think about it

&gt; They don't get grants because of systematic biases.

If you want to go down that route (and I wont even ask for proof) then you can argue that working class men are in the same position.

&gt; Actually plenty of people get handed shit out of the box, they just happen to sit at the top of Britain's class system. 

Which is very few. Are you trying to be clever?

&gt; You're naive if you think the British film industry is run as a meritocracy.

Did I say that? My mantra is the arts are not a meritocracy - actually stole this from the author of the big kahuna. Except when I say it I get downvoted to shit by the desperate. 

You've now gone into nonsense mode talking about massive hollywood players, different world altogether.

3316,"Not complex at all. My point exactly.

It's pretty obvious I was referring to the lack of character development, and that aside from having some basis in the history when you have a full on open brief (I would imagine even encouraged) you reduce a character to kicking and tits and occasionally comforting one of the other supermens.

It's such a weak ass character in a time when you could completely rewrite the plot about her (while maintaining service to fans etc) it baffles the mind why she is even in the thing at all. At all.

Now I am no expert on Marvel but I do pay attention when people are discussing it. I don't see the point if they are play her so middle of the road.

I could argue that Hawkeye is the same but he seems to be pushed now (movie wise) into the average joe role etc

But the fact that people didn't immediately get that causes me to stand by my original comments - retards and people jumping on downvoted posts to gleam easy karma (the worst kind of redditor)

Basically when you are mega rich with a agent who can advocate for you and get not just good deals but protect you and make sure you never need to do any publicity etc it's easy to have an alternate sideline in producing other work when your survival doesnt depend on it

Keep in mind - when she came out of Potter she seemed to want to write more serious adult work - cuckoo etc

I don't think she wanted the galbraith out as it was, too much overlap, writers need pigeon holes regardless of your success

Thinking this was as user above says is a nonsense, this was done just as much to protect the other brands as anything else

I think there are other writers doing this right now. Major writers. I have a hunch.

She barely went through it. Like having a bandage removed versus a leg amputated. The fact you think 50 is a lot explains it.

&gt;  She's just showing people that no matter who you are and what you write you will get rejections and that it's part of being a writer. 

This is so painfully untrue it actually annoys me. 

&gt; Just look at all the people who have taken this as a little bit of inspiration and motivation and comfort, isn't that a good thing?

No I think it gives almost all of them false hope. But that is different argument altogether. 

This is not a post about authors being rejected - This is a specific post about JK Rowling, one of the richest and luckiest authors of all time, getting rejected under a pseudonym because her book was not nothing special, her query might have been poor (what it seems from that letter) and completes undermines the fact that she has an Uber-Agent and a billion quid in the bank.

And all she shows is a polite helpful rejection and one saying 'sorry we're closed'

Capable means nothing. Brilliantly talented writers struggle to get agents and books out. Capable is nothing.

And as I said HP1 is hardly a masterpiece on any level.

&gt; least give her the respect that she was a good enough writer to successfully complete an arts grant.

Eh... you mean fill out the form and write the letter? 

She is supposed to be applauded for that why?

It was turned down because it wasn't anything special, and that is it. 

In fact if you read my comments you would see how one letter is actually quite positive, and helpful, and the other is utter irrelevant as the company had folded.

And if you read the main point of my comment - She is not in the position to give advice about rejection when she had it so fucking easy in the first place.

4132,"**First point** - the books are not impressive to me, as a fan of crime fiction. There is nothing there that makes it stand out amongst others, nothing at all, aside from the reveal that it was Rowling. There is no reason to expect it would not get some rejections. None. 

**Second point** - she already had an agent - this has to be stressed before people start gushing. C&amp;R don't take writers without agents as far as I am aware. 

Getting an agent is a pretty huge step. 

**Third pont** - The C&amp;R letter seems strange to me. It is hard to make out but it appears that the query letter she sent was really bad - it's actually perhaps a bit snarky in response, I don't know for sure without seeing a clear version, but this is offering some advice on how to actually submit to an agent.

**Fourth point** - It's loaded with good advice. If this is a standard rejection from C&amp;R then colour me very impressed. But it seems a bit more detailed than that, suggesting writers handbook, suggesting submitting directly to the agent (One has to assume she did not).

If this is what it seems, then it looks like Rowling's agent just let her send anything off.

**Fifth Point** - The other rejection just states that the publisher has folded into another - What was the point in putting that up? 

**Sixth Point** - A lot of readers on here have their memories of Harry Potter, and that is great, I had Roald Dahl, but the hyperbole regarding Rowling as a writer needs to end as soon as possible. 

I'm going to say it, swallow it if you wish, angrily downvote whatever - She is not a great writer but any stretch of the imagination. This idea that she could turn her hand and be the next Gass or Gaddis is just ludicrous. 

**Seventh Point** - Enough with the bullshit history of Rowling. Enough. Even the fans who are aware seem to believe it. The cup of tea in the cafe in Edinburgh (I'd move there tomorrow, amazing place). She was on the dole, child payments, all of these things.

She had a good degree and was doing teacher training, writing in cafes because she wanted to, on the dole, she was doing that on purpose. That was not suffering. 

Also the ""Scottish Arts Council gave Rowling a grant to finish the book.""

If you know anything about getting Arts Council Grants then you'll nod along with me on this one. What? Unpublished nobody gets a grant to finish a book? There are novelists with awards who regularly get turned down.

She got an agent at Christopher Little it seems pretty quickly, and 12 rejections from publishers is NOTHING. 12? If you think that is something you know nothing of the world. And yeah, Harry Potter 1, come on, even to the fans, is it really that good?

Hard?

No, in fact she had it easy.

that be the point - they write simplistic work that impresses stupid people who dont know anything about literature

most screenplays and plays are awful anyway - whatever put that aside - but the fact that we are at a level when mcdonagh is considered a list is baffling

i at least appreciate tarantinos indulgences in a time when so most stuff is generic

mcdonagh is literally lowest common denominator shite with a bit of bad language - its really bad if you pour through his plays

beauty queen is a poor trite shitty little play 

lonesome west a poor re imagining of a really brilliant play

pillowman is a joke - bad kafka interspersed with a few 'dark short stories' - absolute cop out as a narrative - ben brantley lost a lot of points when i read his review

cripple - irritating play beyond belief - stock characters doing goofball shit with a ham fisted backstory - ugh 

lieutenant - its just a bad play - strip that down and really look at it - its a fucking bad play - oh look violence - christ

7 psychopaths, - a pointless indulgent narrative that goes nowhere - the only thing people seem to remember is the little shorts stuck in  (notice he did same in pillowman)

But this meme is just SO STUPID, and means absolutely nothing, that I almost can't watch something with him in it, and see his face without just thinking in my head ""...classic"".

What does it even mean??? It's NONSENSE, and has nothing to do with him, whatsoever. It is literally the dumbest thing in the entire universe. Paul Dano did nothing to provoke it or anything, he has no control over it and has influenced it in no way. Fucking 4chan is so dumb but damn it they live rent free in my brain.

&gt; I never put you down

You just called me a dick.

&gt; defeated and pessimistic

Rational

&gt; And I never said you were wrong

Then why argue?

&gt; By going to school and working towards something different to what you want to be doing, you're basically giving up right there

If you want to think that way then that is your concern. I never said that.

&gt; You're saying, ""yep, I'll probably fail because most people do, so fuck it."" 

I said no such thing.

&gt; That's not the right way to look at things and 99% of the people who've made it in any cutthroat industry did not look at it like that, I guarantee you.

Guaranteeing obvious things is rather pointless no

&gt;  And I don't mean to sound like film school is necessary or guaranteed to land you a job,

Exactly my point. It is not needed in the arts in general. Kinda the point I was making.


&gt;  but if you're going to go to school for something, it might as well be for something you love doing.

This is just snowflake bullshit and in no way related to the reality for the vast majority of people on the planet.

&gt; But the people who do succeed with them are the ones who DO work hard and DO have the passion for it.

That goes for every industry. It's a pointless fluff response that everyone seems to use. And then sometimes it is just luck, but luck is probably the main thing, especially in the arts. And you can't manufacture luck despite some folky saying.

&gt; You can't turn it into a game of statistics.

I didn't turn it into a game. It's just a fact.

The odds of succeeding in any of the arts are slim. Look around you. How many writers or artists or actors do you know? How many are getting anywhere. It's just simple numbers.

The world is filled with aspirational people, most without any talent, who are now 40 and working in Dennys.

My only advice was to get a useful degree that you could use to support yourself. It doesn't stop you doing anything else. But when you fail, and statistically you will fail, at least you have something else to fall back on.

Too many 20 year old guys thinking they are going to write the next Cloverfield and be famous. Probably tens and tens of thousands in California alone. All with the same passion and work ethic, all with the same standard of writing, all with the same amount of ideas.

All I said was do something useful - my exact words were:

Find something you dont hate to sustain yourself

But when you say it, and it is the truth, people get very nervous and concerned and write you off as a bitter failure or a troll and whatnot.

That's fine. It's your life. Do as you must. I actually don't care and to be honest I don't think the world is going to miss out when the next Fast and Furious knock off or Found Footage horror that Mr. X was writing never got made before he returned to Landon Nebraska and shot himself.

Find something you dont hate to sustain yourself 

Study what you love is great is what you love is something useful

I dont give a fuck. If you say it or not it  - doesn't matter if you go against the hivemind you be downovoted


&gt; Another way to assure downvotes is being incredibly vague with your criticism. Would you mind expanding on your points a little?

Fuck no. I have expressly said that this fucking argument needs to die on reddit. I wish I kept that long spiel I had before about it.

This is how is plays out:

Guy writes

&gt; Ex Machina was great 

That's it. Nothing else. No depth. No critical interpretation. A bland simplistic I like it and he gets - 500 upvotes

Responses that follow are usually along the lines of: 

Totally! (48 upvotes)

Yeah it was amazing! (34 upvotes)

The best! (+28)

But - if someone says the complete opposite

I didn't really care for that movie (- 50)

Responses that follow: 

Why? (+48)

Defend yourself? (+23)

Lol go back to Transformers (+29)

and then the most irritating and retarded of all is what you just wrote

""Just you know if you actually explained yourself you wouldn't be downvoted so much (+67)""

No, fuck no, bullshit, it doesn't fucking matter.

You could write an essay on it and you would still get downvoted if it goes against the hive.

And again what would they be?

You basically bad mouthed me with no evidence and when I explained my strongly held beliefs on drug legalisation and then asked you to point out any times I posted ""propaganda"" as you call it you ran off like a coward.

You are not winning this circular argument mate, because the burden of proof is yours.

So once again, you have nothing, or you are grossly mistaken for some bizarre reason, and instead of backing your claims you think it is okay to 'call me out' by just insulting me (and breaking this subs rules) and when challenged scuttling off like a coward.

That's everything that has happened here.

Everyone can read it.

I am hiding nothing. Anyone can check my account. Anyone can show me proof of my 'propaganda'.

You have nothing. If you made a mistake I'd accept it and move on but you seem determined to argue your corner even though I am leaving myself completely open to being proven wrong.

In comparison to the movies which are massive yeah he is right. 

Daredevil was a hit for netflix sure, but comparatively it is a different ball game. 

&gt;  10.7% of Netflix subscribers watched at least one episode of Daredevil within the first 11 days of its premiere

This is great for TV but compared to billion dollar franchises I dunno

These are minor characters too, belonging to a massive and already overpopulated avengers line

Also the dark tone of their adaptations so far does not lend them so easily to the marvel movies, which is a fair point

Daredevil could have been a pg toned down show really easily if you think about it

His personal comments about shield notwithstanding are they not already part of the show - you don't need another lot of non superheros floated in there - no room.

Is this hyperbolic in saying no one watches them - sure - but think outside the box.

And there will be no alternatives for them.

Every direction they would traditionally have turned will be gone, and what is new will require less numbers or a skillset or education that is beyond them.

Again, no one can actually know, there is no way to read the future, but taking into account how many years it would take to institute massive educational changes, or create a whole new area of jobs that somehow would be suitable (and not done better and cheaper by robots) it seems highly unlikely to me

Mass marketed movies like this will follow a strict enough formula, won't rock the both, will hit all the marks and the vast majority will be happy.

Star Wars fans (I am one) are so desperate for a new movie, and with the bad taste of the prequels, that any film that is ordinary or decent will be considered good, and anything that is fairly good will be considered great.

The average movie goer will probably require even less from the film to be contented.

It's just the nature of the beast.

This is a film that can't push the boundaries, and in this case, doesn't need to.

Picking the director to deliver the product just shored up this middle of the line ABC filmmaking approach.

Has there ever been a film with such a loyal following, who after a two decade wait were given a trilogy that was nearly an absolute disappointment for some, and then thought it was all over?

That was it.

Then the deal and the new films.

Most movies would be lucky to open to $50 million. Four weeks before its debut, “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” has more than that in the bank.

The record-breaking advance ticket sales, confirmed by several people with knowledge of the numbers, are just one sign that Walt Disney Co.’s new movie set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away could become the highest-grossing release of all time.

On Fandango, “The Force Awakens” has already sold more tickets than any other movie before its release, the Comcast Corp. unit said. IMAX Corp., whose digital and large-format screens account for about one-third of sales for the new “Star Wars” film, has doubled its prior pre-sales record of about $9 million, a spokesman said.

By the time “The Force Awakens” opens in the U.S. on Dec. 17, those records won’t just be broken, but will be distant specks in the rearview mirror.

ENLARGE
To accommodate demand, a number of theaters are staying open round the clock during the movie’s first week and adding screenings at offbeat hours such as 2 a.m. and 5 a.m.

Many in Hollywood are predicting “The Force Awakens” will handily beat the $209 million opening weekend record set by “Jurassic World” in June. Even if the opening falls short of the record, the fact that most people have time off of work and school for the holidays during the two weeks after could put the record set for “Avatar,” $761 million total gross in the U.S. and Canada, at risk.

Whether “The Force Awakens” also breaks “Avatar’s” record of $2.79 billion in global box office will depend on whether it catches fire in countries like China and Russia, where “Star Wars” isn't the long-established cultural phenomenon it is in the West.

That is the kind of worry Disney dreamed of having in 2011 when it paid $4 billion to acquire “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm LLC and hatched a plan including new TV shows, videogames and toys that reaches its apex with “The Force Awakens.”

But as the movie has grown from a likely hit to a record-smashing behometh, competitors are left wondering whether there will be any room in its wake.

Previously, major hits that opened close to Christmas like “The Hobbit” trilogy and “Avatar” have played alongside other box-office successes. But there is a growing fear in Hollywood that the first “Star Wars” movie in a decade—and one that returns stars including Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher to roles they haven’t played since 1983—isn’t comparable to any film that has come before.

It is expected to attract hard-core fans who will go to multiple screenings and casual moviegoers who rarely go to the multiplex, along with senior citizens who remember seeing the original in 1977 and their grandchildren who first glimpsed Darth Vader on YouTube.

“‘The Force Awakens’ presents an unprecedented moviegoing situation,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Rentrak. “The question is whether the tide it brings to theaters this December will raise all ships or become a black hole where all other movies disappear.”

Among the movies sure to be affected are director Ron Howard’s “Moby Dick”-inspired “In the Heart of the Sea,” which opens the prior weekend, the Tina Fey comedy “Sisters” and “Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip,” which also open the weekend of Dec. 18, and a quintet of Christmas debuts including Will Smith drama “Concussion” and biopic “Joy,” starring Jennifer Lawrence as the inventor of the Miracle Mop.

“A lot of these films won’t get as wide a release as they’re seeking,” said a film buyer who works with independent theaters.

Rory Bruer, president of distribution for “Concussion” studio Sony Pictures Entertainment, said he isn’t worried about securing enough screens. “The exhibition community is not short-sighted and they love the idea of having diverse offerings,” he said. A spokesman for “Joy” and “Alvin” studio 20th Century Fox said, “We think there is plenty of room and appetite for alternative choices in the most concentrated movie-going time of the year.”

Despite the evidence it has the must-see movie of a generation on its hands, Disney is taking extra steps to ensure it dominates the holiday box office.

The studio is requiring that multiplexes that play “The Force Awakens” on its opening weekend must show the film in their biggest auditorium and play it there for at least four weeks. On any other screen showing “Star Wars” its first weekend, theaters must play it for at least three weeks, covering the entire period through New Year’s Day—typically the most lucrative time of the year at the box office.

Experienced movie executives say Disney’s terms are unusual but not unprecedented. The last time some could remember similar demands were for the previous “Star Wars” movie, 2005’s prequel “Revenge of the Sith,” which was produced by then-independent Lucasfilm and released by Twentieth Century Fox, which until mid-2013 was part of The Wall Street Journal’s parent company News Corp.
Typically, studios expect that their movies play the same number of screens for at least two weeks, though there is flexibility for a picture that flops.

Multiplexes with many screens will likely have enough room over the holidays. But smaller theaters will face tough choices, said Adrian Mijares Elizondo, the chief executive of U.S. operations for Cinépolis, a major Mexican exhibitor with 11 locations north of the border.

It’s easy to play “Star Wars” on six screens when a theater has 15 auditoriums, he said, but it’s trickier to know what proportion should show it when there are only six total.

Though no other movies are expected to come close to the box-office power of “Star Wars,” cinemas still want to provide options for people not interested in what Chewbacca has been up to since “Return of the Jedi,” or who have already found out the answer. In addition, they must worry about long-term relationships with other studios besides Disney.

Mr. Elizondo said he’s prepared to show “Star Wars” on fewer screens in its opening week—and risk losing some revenue—if it means he is freer to show more new titles in the weeks following.",2015-11-19 22:00:37+00:00,cx67ah9,1.0,t3_3thj97,1414.0,boxoffice

6672,"It's really a multi-faceted issue. The ratings are highly subjective and inconsistent, the theaters won't touch anything NC-17 or unrated, and the studios know that PG-13 is is most marketable rating to have and aim for it as much as possible.

&gt; that PG-13 is is most marketable rating to have and aim for it as much as possible.

**Covered this.**



And obviously there are a number of factors contributing to all of these issues. As long as the rating system is a black-box, the major studios will have an advantage in having more resources to predict what rating they can get and to recut their movies to fit the ratings they want. 

**Utterly empty comment. Means nothing. Already do this.**


As long as there's a tiered ratings system, especially one where part of the population is barred from seeing films with certain ratings, then there's going to be a 'most marketable/profitable rating for the studios to shoot for. 

**Again already covered in the thread many times. Literally wooosh level now.**

And flooding that rating with content can't help but stretch it outside of recognition (more movies rated PG-13 means more precedent for each new film to point back and say 'well we're not that much worse than those films that got PG-13'). 

**Nonsense, there will never be that much of a stretch, how could any rational person think this? Jesus christ.**

And as long as the burden falls on the theaters to keep kids out of movies that their parents might object to them seeing, then they'll be cagey about showing anything that falls outside the rating system or is otherwise too objectionable on the chance kids can get in anyway and their parents complain/boycott/sue.

**As many of us are from countries with testify this is just bullshit, and more importantly the more concrete ratings actually helps this.**

Adding new ratings like the proposed T-14 can be beneficial, but only in-as-much as they can dilute the box-office domination of PG-13.

**Utter twadle.**

The oscars are voted by academy people. In the system. A bad film making money suddenly compels them to vote for x and y. I dunno, even with all the politics I can't really see it being that common.

It is rare to find an oscar type film (some sort of serious drama etc) that was mauled by the critics yet went on to make considerable money nominated for any of the major awards.

I can't think of one. A film that was considered poor that because of its popularity got nominated.

7386,"&gt; The Martian earned a massive $12.1 million in South Korea over the weekend, reaping almost half of the box-office revenue in the country over the period.

&gt; The Matt Damon film, distributed by 20th Century Fox Korea, grabbed 48.3 percent of the three-day weekend market share, according to the Korean Film Council. This is also the biggest opening score for the month of October in the Asian country, whose population watches more films per year on average, more than four, than any other country in the world.

In terms of making a difference considering what it will cost to stream - yes. You are just discounting the cost factor. But this is all theoretical. 

Again, you know my point, I said it clearly.

Can you not see it as a possible reason the studios would not want to release big budget movies the same day into home theatres?

The fact you won't answer I think shows clearly you can't admit it.

Again, netflix is irrelevant in this argument. A totally different argument lies behind that.

7398,"&gt; It means people would pay to watch more movies. 

Most movie goers are not massive fans so no, not really. I think that argument is nonsense.

And no mate I did have a clear point, you know I did. You just refused to address it. And are doing so again. Sigh.

And you prob think I am some old school codger but nothing of the sort, I am just showing you one reason why it is not as simple as you think.

A clear obvious reason and you can't address it.

The Netflix argument is a different thing altogether as they were the first to do it and grabbed a foothold, doesn't mean the studios wont be doing it themselves and keeping the theatres open, but that is a totally different argument. 

And as for your comments about innovation, okay,yeah, while studios are and continue to make record profits they left another more tech orientated company invest in infrastructure, okay, oh no!

They're going to use netflix while they build their own, all of the big ones are, without a doubt. Same thing the big 5 will do in publishing in the next number of years.

But again, can you back to the point I made and actually answer it.

You said who will be the first studio to do that and I gave you a clear example of why they might not consider it a good way of delivering content, and yet you give me nothing.

The argument is clear. Try and twist it all you want. It is clear as day. That is a genuine reason they might not want to do as you are wanting to do.

Any response to that?

It isn't normal, why it made the news...

Imagine 6 times the murder rate in America - that's the equivalent.

7714,"**Joe Roy Metheny Confession**



To start out I will tell you about myself at the present moment, which is locked up. I am 48 years old, I weigh about 450 pounds and it's not all fat. I've been locked up for almost 8 years now, but when one has been sentenced to a couple of life without parole sentences, time doesn't matter anymore.

I have no problem with being locked up, for no one put me here but myself. And I deserve to be right where I'm at, cause I had 12 law-abiding jurors that told me so, in a couple different cases. Ha! Ha! I was only convicted of two murders and one kidnapping for the one that got away. I got 50 years for her. The first murder I was sentenced to life without parole. The second one they gave me the death penalty. I sat on Marylandâ€™s death row for 3 years, and then they overturned my sentence and gave me another life without parole and sent me down here for the rest of my life.

I killed seven people, three men, and four women. Two men I chopped up with an axe under a bridge in South Baltimore. I was found not guilty for them cause they couldn't prove I did it. Under that same bridge I also killed two women and one man who was fishing, who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. I weighed their bodies down and put them in that river. I showed the police where I put them about 3 years later, but they couldn't find them. So they could not charge me for them.

My murder rampage started out as revenge but ended up as a passion for the taste of blood and the overwhelming sense of power one gets for taking the life of another.

My story

It all started back in July of 1994. I was at work, I was a truck driver. I was working overtime this one night. Then I got off and went home as I always did. But when I opened the door and turned on the light, I noticed there was nothing there. My ole lady had taken everything including my son and left me. Her leaving was not my problem. But she took my 6-year-old son with her. She was a crack addict and a worthless piece of shit. I would have paid her to get out of my life. All she had to do was take my son over to my mothers house and she could have had everything else and be gone.

I found out about 6 months later she had moved on the other side of town with some asshole that had her out selling her ass for drugs. They got busted for drugs and they took my son away from them for child neglect and child abuse.

I had no chance of going to social services and trying to get my son back do to my past criminal record. So I took it upon myself with the hatred I had for these 2 who lost my son, to go looking for them. I had found out from someone that they was going under that bridge and getting high with some homeless motherfuckers who lived under that bridge.

I went under there looking for them. They were not there, but the two homeless motherfuckers they got high with them were down there. They were passed out on some old stinking mattress and that's where they were when I left, except there were dead from being chopped up.

That same night I lured the first crackwhore down under that bridge. I got her high and was trying to get information out of her about my ole ladies whereabouts. She acted like she didn't know, so I beat the hell out of her and raped her ass then killed her. I put her in some bushes and went and lured the second bitch down there. I did the same to her as the last one, but as I was about to throw her in the bushes with the other one I noticed an old blackman down by the river fishing looking back up at me. I grabbed a steel pipe that was lying by and ran down on him and layed his head wide open. So I put the two girls and him in the river and weighed them down with rocks.

That was a very busy night for me 5 murders within about 7 hours. I washed up in that river and cleaned up the crime scene as much as I could, then left. 2 1/2 weeks later I was arrested and charged with the murders of the 2 men I chopped up. I spent close to 18 months in Baltimore City Jail waiting to go to trial. The trial lasted 1 week and it was thrown out of court cause of lack of evidence.

I was free again. I went back and talked my old boss into giving my job back to me at the pallet company. There was a little trailer on the property, so I told my boss to let me stay there and I could keep an eye on the place. He agreed to this and gave me the keys to the front gate and main building. The company was on a dead end road and was very isolated. It was perfect for what I wanted to do.

I lured 2 more crackwhores up there to my trailer. I killed and butchered their bodies up. I cut the meat up and put it in some Tupperware bowls then put it in a freezer. I buried the remains in several shallow graves in a little woods behind the company.

Over the next couple weeks on the weekends I opened up a little open-pit beef stand. I had real roast beef and pork sandwiches and why not they were very good. The human body tastes was very similar to pork. If you mix it together no one can tell the difference.

Everything was going pretty good until I ran out of my special meat. So I lured another bitch up to my trailer. I got her in there and started to rip her clothes off and knocking the hell out of her. She was screaming, but there was no one around to hear her except me. And I just kept on laughing at her.

I turned around for a split second, and that was my mistake, for she ran out the door before I could get to her. There was an 8-foot chain link fence with barbwire on top of it around the front of the company. There was a stack of wooden pallets next to the fence about 10 feet high. That bitch scaled those pallets like a monkey and jumped the fence, and ran down to the main road where some guy in a pickup truck picked her up and took her to a nearby gas station where they called the cops.

Well I knew the cops were on the way, but I didn't run. I gathered up her clothing, grabbed the keys to the gate, and went out and opened it. Soon as I step out the gate a cop car pulled up. And the cop jumped out and pulled his gun on me and told me to get on the ground. And that is where it all came to an end.

They took me down and booked me. She had told them that I said I was going to kill her like the rest. Which was true. They had me sitting in a little room down at homicide drilling me and damn near kissing my ass. Trying to find out what I had done. They pulled me out of city jail everyday for 1 month taking me back and forth between the company and the bridge.

I had they going crazy over at the company digging up the remains of those 2 bitches there. Cause I had their remains buried in 7 different holes. The only thing I feel bad about in any of this, is I didn't get to murder the 2 motherfuckers I was really after. And that's my ex ole lady and the bastard she got hooked up with.

Well that's my story, horrible but true. So the next time you're riding down the road and you happen to see an open pit beef stand, that you've never seen before, make sure you think about this story before you take a bite of that sandwich. Sometimes you never know who you may be eating. Ha! Ha!

Em... where to start

It's good, but it's fucking strange, it's one of the weirdest mishmashes of styles I've encountered in a while (esp from a film I didn't think was utter shit)

Starts off almost spy/action, then into kinda drama, then a bit of spy, then into body horror (maybe not) but kinda

So fucking weird 

**6/10** 

**Double Indemnity (1944)** *dir Billy Wilder*

Classic noir most have seen, just caught up with it, great script, good film all over. 

**7/10**

**The Naked City (1948)** *dir  Jules Dassin*

Really cool fairly low budget police procedural, just good fun and with some interesting NY Footage, enjoyed it

My first from the director actually, will catch some more when I can

**8/10**

**The Big Heat (1953)** *dir Fritz Lang*

Another noir classic, this one pretty fucked up when you think about it, Lee Marvin is in it, it was good, not great though

Director Terry Gilliam, the only American member of the Monty Python comedy troupe and an Oscar nominee for the screenplay to his film “Brazil,” has died. He was &lt;&lt; born 11-22-40&gt;&gt;.

Gilliam directed 12 feature films, often with a baroque look and surreal themes, including “Time Bandits,” “Brazil,” “The Adventures of Baron Munchausen,” “The Fisher King,” “12 Monkeys,” “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” and “The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.” His films inspired intense reactions; several were cult classics with devoted followings, but they were generally flawed enough to inspire loathing from those not on the same bawdy, anarchical comedy wavelength.

Gilliam was a part of Monty Python’s Flying Circus from its launch and was first credited as an animator, with his cartoons linking the show’s sketches and defining the group’s image — often moving cutouts from antique photographs. He appeared in several smaller parts such as Cardinal Fang in “The Spanish Inquisition” episode of the series; Patsy in 1975’s “Monty Python and the Holy Grail,” which he co-directed with Jones; and the jailer in 1979’s “Monty Python’s Life of Brian.”

The first film he directed solo was 1977 cult favorite “Jabberwocky,” adapted from the poem by Lewis Carroll. The Britmovie blog said: “Depending on your mood, this is either a pretentious incoherent mess or a piece of art bristling with images of stark beauty. Although the immortal poem is embraced at the outset, this is more like Lewis Carroll after a very heavy night out with the lads, projecting a totally bizarre, other-worldly quality with the fresh-faced, charming innocence of Michael Palin plonked in the centre like a refugee of sanity tossed into bedlam.”

Following “Life of Brian,” Gilliam became a screenwriter and director, starting with the high-budget “Time Bandits,” which he co-scripted with Michael Palin, in 1981. The starry cast included Sean Connery, Ralph Richardson. Roger Ebert said that the film is “amazingly well produced. The historic locations are jammed with character and detail,” but “the movie’s repetitive, monotonous in the midst of all this activity. Basically, it’s just a kid and six dwarfs racing breathlessly through one set piece after another, shouting at one another.” Said dwarves apparently possess a map showing the location of several holes in time — holes through they can travel so they can pop in on the adventures of Robin Hood, Napoleon, and King Agamemnon, as well as to sail on the Titanic. All this was rendered with superb art direction, even if there was essentially no plot.
“Time Bandits” was the first film in a trilogy Gilliam that would cover childhood, middle age (1985’s “Brazil”) and old age (1988’s “The Adventures of Baron Munchausen).
For 1983’s “Monty Python’s The Meaning of Life,” Gilliam directed the animation sequences.
Gilliam shared an Oscar nomination for original screenplay with Tom Stoppard and Charles McKeown in 1985 for “Brazil,” whose title alludes not to the country but to a song popular in the 1930s, and the gorgeous production design of the film also references this period even though the dystopian film is set in the future. The New York Times said “Brazil,” “a jaunty, wittily observed vision of an extremely bleak future, is a superb example of the power of comedy to underscore serious ideas, even solemn ones. It’s a remarkable accomplishment for Mr. Gilliam, whose satirical and cautionary impulses work beautifully together. His film’s ambitious visual style bears this out, combining grim, overpowering architecture with clever throwaway touches.”
The director’s next film, 1988’s “The Adventures of Baron Munchhausen,” starring John Neville in the title role, drew a lot of negative publicity for running millions over budget, having production shut down by a bond company and generating little box office when it finally hit theaters. (The production budget ended up at around $46 million, while the film’s B.O. was $8 million — but the movie drew Oscar nominations for its art direction, costume design, visual effects and makeup, and on MetaCritic it has a critics’ score of 69 and an excellent users’ score of 8.2). The story, set in a city under bombardments by the Turks, follows an acting troupe performing “The Adventures of Baron Munchausen” on stage, interrupted by the actual Baron Munchausen, who declares that only he can end the conflict. In 2008, when the 20th anniversary DVD was released, the New York Sun declared, “It is clear that ‘Baron Munchausen’ is one of the most visionary and accomplished movies of the 1980s.”
His top-grossing film was “12 Monkeys” with over $160 million in worldwide box office.
Gilliam also attemped to film “The Man Who Killed Don Quixote” in 1999 but the movie was cancelled after the lead actor Jean Rochefort suffered a herniated disc and a flood damaged the set. He attempted several times to re-start production but was unable to do so.

::Edit::
::edit::
This year they noticed great whites in new zealand travel in groups and some sharks might even act as decoys for other sharks to sneak up on prey.
In s.africa there are giant reefs which the sharks use to sneak up on their prey and also where breaching occurs. Which is what the video above demonstrates.
In short TIL all sharks dont behave the same. Each region of sharks have their own behavior.

&gt; So, someone who was born in England but killed in Ireland doesn't count.


Yes, they don't count.

&gt; Patrick Dunphy murdered 2 (which is the serial killer requirement, according to the FBI).

Yes, he murdered two, and yes I already mentioned the update which I find bizarre, but is he a serial killer? It might be likely but again he could be a common variety greedy murderer. 

&gt; As for Darkey being half story, I guess you could consider Jack the Ripper half story, too. It was so long ago...

No, they are not the same. I think you know this but I am sure will swing back and defend it overly emotionally for some bizarre insecure reason you have.

&gt; As for being convicted: What about Dean Corll? I know he's not Irish, but he was never convicted. Does that mean he wasn't a serial killer?

Depends on the country. And depends on the finding the bodies or having several witnesses attest to what happened.

&gt; Burke and Hare

Again, despite the shroud of history, who is to say just not common street thugs - the sort would have set up a processing line for that sort of thing.

I agree. Mods should be made to engage with legitimate complaints or else just removed by admins. Don't understand why this isn't the case already.

&gt; Frankly you have no right to demand a say in how a privately-owned forum is run.

Either do the mods. Who shirk open debate which is a core foundation of the site. And ban against basic moddiquette. Rules should be in place for this specifically, not just a rough FAQ.

As for your ranting, what the fuck are you talking about? 

I am talking about users making complaints or comments about this sub and just being deleted and told hush hush.

The idea that /r/soccer is any different to the rest of reddit is, as I have said on many occasions, fucking laughable.

No you didn't. Simple opinions are perfectly valid in many contexts. It's never about the simple opinion.

And yes I did explain quite succinctly the general reasons why people think the film is overrated - it just have went over your head.

Which is disturbing because it was quite simple.

What is wrong is that perfectly fine opinions are constantly getting downvoted because the hive disagrees with them.

In essence, using your terminology, they are being 'punished' for expressing their genuine opinion, because the hive does not agree with their POV.

We are not talking about anything offensive or anything like that, just a genuine opinion expressed cleanly - that is what I am talking about.

But I've already said that as well. So I am confused as to why you accused me of just saying 'junk'.

There aren't. 

All it does is allow everyone the equal voice of 1 upvote and no downvoted into negatives which hide the comment and if you are a newish user start the ridiculous delay process which prevents you from posting often.

Any site rule breaking content will be reported and removed by mods. If more mods are needed get them, it's not a paid position, plenty of willing people. In fact the inability to downvote certain comments in a thread could lead to them being ignored more often, as many people go to the negatives first to read the nasty comments.

9041,"&gt; The film begins with a continuous four-minute take that starts on a television screen showing a Hindi soap opera and pulls out into the street, where armed gangs are furiously searching for a man, gunning down anyone in their path who might be his ally. They bomb his house. When the pressure becomes too much to bear, there is a cut, and with it, an exhale. But there is no loss of tension. The film powers forward, relentless, for the next five hours.

The argument is that a strip implies a minor work without a wide reaching world around it that keeps it in the public eye. Tracy, being somewhat of a minor cultural icon, with a vast array of crossover media, would not apply.

So it brings it back full circle to my original question  - in terms of the article about the films lack of success what difference does the informal use of the term comic book over comic strip actually have?

The answer is none.

Keep in mind the reason I brought this up (knowing full well I was right and would get downvoted anyway) was because one of the first comments didn't even read the article just spat out some half assed comment 'because it's not a book it's a strip' which was pitiful.

 The level of discussion on major subs is outstandingly bad.
