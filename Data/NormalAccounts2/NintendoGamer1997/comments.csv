I guess I would recommend it to fans of DC. Personally I prefer LEGO Marvel Superheroes because I'm not as familiar with DC and I like Marvel more than DC; there were a lot of characters that I didn't recognize when I was playing this game (examples: Black Canary, Hawkman, etc...), because the only DC movies that I've seen were Superman Returns, the Dark Knight trilogy, Green Lantern, and the two bad 90's Batman movies. 

Due to the whole hub and all but one or two of the 15 levels happening at night, a lot of the levels and areas look really bland when compared to other LEGO games such as LEGO Marvel Superheroes and LEGO City Undercover. I don't like how Batman is the main character, I think the game should've focused on the whole Justice League for the entire game, instead of having you start playing as Batman and eventually having the team unite for the climax. There are only 50 characters in this games.

I've heard that the Wii U version of this game has a map on the GamePad. I found it to be really helpful when playing LEGO City Undercover.",2016-04-12 19:25:59+00:00,d2073h2,1.0,t3_4eholb,487.0,wiiu

- the game started up faster than it should've

- It had some Japanese characters at the bottom of the screen sometimes that might have been subtitles from a Japanese let's play.

- The file select and creation UI is from the PC Edition, not the console edition.

- Text is removed without the Wii U touch screen keyboard appearing or without any keys on a keyboard clicking.

- The ""Manual"" has a label for the speaker and is not in the Minecraft art style.
