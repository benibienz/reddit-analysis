6,"Pointing fingers at ""greedy CEOs"" is a fruitless endeavor. A CEO has a fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders. If I am the CEO of Acme Widgets and free trade laws allow Nippon widgets to enter the market at a lower cost then some of my competitors might move their manufacturing offshore to compete. I could hold out, defy my shareholders, and insist on making my widgets in America but I will just go out of business and save no jobs while bankrupting my shareholders.

If you want to fix the blame, fix it on the politicians who allowed Nippon widgets to enter my market at a lower cost, as well as the politicians who allowed my competitors to offshore their jobs, forcing me to do the same or go out of business.  Free trade, and the destruction of the middle class has been the single issue with bipartisan support over the decades.

11,"The problem with blaming wealth distribution on Reagonomics is that the data shows that the departure in wealth started before Reagan became President.

The departure of wealth between the median, 95th percentile, and 20th percentile [began in 1975 and has continued to date](http://imgur.com/a/ophsB).  What started to change in the mid-70's?

Well, for one thing [these](http://imgur.com/a/0uSsp) started showing up all over the place in the US.  Keep in mind that, at the time, the automotive industry in the US was perhaps the most vertically integrated industry around, so 1 fewer car built meant a down-trickle of many American manufacturing jobs.  At the same time, we saw fewer of [these](http://imgur.com/a/6mqHy) on the market, until we soon didn't have a single one left that was manufactured in the US.

Perhaps even more important is the fact that [these](http://imgur.com/a/1X5E6) started making their way into factories in the US.  Above everything else, those little do-dads and their children are responsible for over 80% of the manufacturing jobs lost in the US.

So, before you drink the flavor-aide that the wealth distribution change in the US is a result of any single president or political party, step back and look at how the American middle class was formed (manufacturing), how China's middle class is being built (manufacturing), and the correlation between manufacturing jobs and the distribution of wealth shown earlier.

13,"&gt; America always seems to lag behind most of the civilized world.

In terms of what, exactly?

Let's look at technological advancement.  Steel, telephone, telegram, internet, personal computers, introduction of an affordable automobile, technologies that have lead agriculture world-wide.  It is pretty difficult to step back and say that we lag most of the civilized world.

Now, let's look at race.  I would submit that America is more accepting of different races and cultures than many developed countries.  We may have our struggles where others don't have the obvious struggles, but that is largely because many areas of the world are still reletively homogenous.  Do you believe that China, Japan, or Poland are not racist countries?  India is so bigoted that they have created dozens of different classes amongst themselves just in case they run out of external cultures to be bigoted against.

First, the linked source is not accurate, according to the original source. The car didn't ""immediately erupt into flames.""

I don't believe Trump has ever said, ""I believe people of X race are inferior to Y race."" Neither do most people who are accused of racism. The charge of racism is an extrapolation from something they say to the actual definition.

For instance, if I say that I believe all black people should be sent to Africa. Pretty easy to characterize that statement as racism, but you need to extrapolate to do that and it is a subjective exercise.

Furthermore, the first justice appointed will be replacing possibly the most conservative justice of the last couple decades, so while I hope the court will move to the left it certainly won't move right on the first appointment.  Finally, conservative justices are by nature conservative.  They don't overturn previous court rulings easily.  Case law is extremely important to conservative judges and they likely won't even vote to accept most gay marriage cases.

144,"&gt; If you support Donald Trump, you are supporting xenophobia, classism, racism, misogyny, elitism, ecocide, and religionism.

You forgot homophobia.  I mean, if you are going to throw labels around, you might as well throw them all out there.  /s

Here is my take.  You cannot have productive conversations on gender equality, race, sexuality, religion, etc. in an echo chamber.  You cannot have productive conversations by shouting down and labeling those who dare to disagree.  As long as you take that stance, you are stating that you are uninterested in productive conversations on these subjects because, by default, anybody from the opposing side can be dismissed with a label.

It is my belief that your attitude is the attitude that lead to a Trump presidency.  Middle America, and independents specifically, rebelled against the fact that they cannot hold a view that we need to control our borders without being labeled racist.  They rebelled against the fact that that we cannot have a discussion of the balance of private business rights vs. gay rights without being labeled homophobic.  They rebelled against the fact that, amid the demagoguery, there are actually reasonable debates (in their minds) surrounding transgender rights.

I am very liberal on social issues, but I hate how my fellow liberals throw labels around as a way to stifle dissent and I believe that people have rebelled, and will continue to rebel, against this tactic.",2016-11-09 22:48:14+00:00,d9tii8j,1.0,t3_5c45vg,1550.0,changemyview

This is actually quite an offensive statement to many.  Not because of the transgender issue, but because it assumes that the cultural practices of Native Americans are the same. There are numerous different tribes from the Abenaki to the Zuni.  They went from the arctic to the tip of modern day South America.  From the caribbean islands to California.  Hundreds of languages and cultures spread across two continents.

I find it very sad that people subscribe to ideologies that assume the best way to a better America is to demonize your opponent and idolize your candidate.  That isn't how true progress is made.  That is only a path to send people into their corners so they can either shout past one another while they dig in their heels or put up echo chamber walls.

Large public company providing health care and other benefits for domestic partners, regardless of gender.  Gays and bisexuals being allowed in the military.  The legalization of gay marriage, first in select states and later nationwide.  There are many more milestones, but you get the point.

None of these milestones were reached because one side got in a corner and lobbed bombs at the other side.  They were achieved by slowly converting the American people.  They were achieved through legal actions.  They were achieved by convincing companies that there is nothing to fear.

310,"I am going to be a little fair to DARE here because several of the studies are questionable.

RTI International found that the long term effect couldn't be determined from the studies they looked at because the studies were ""compromised by severe control group attrition or contamination"".  It did find that smaller programs were ""more effective"" in the short term though.

The California DoE based their study on a simple questionnaire about how students ""felt"" about about the program.  It did not measure drug use.  If 100 people watch a commercial they will overwhelmingly say that the commercial didn't sway them to buy the product, yet commercials exist because they do sway people despite what the people say.  This study can be discounted.

The National Institute of Justice study took a random sample of people who had attended the DARE curriculum and found that they were more likely to drink, smoke, and use drugs.  I do not believe that they corrected for the student's activities before the curriculum.  In other words, are kids who are more likely to drink, smoke, and do drugs more likely to attend DARE classes because they are forced there?  Don't know.

That said, DARE was probably minimally effective at most.  But the studies were largely horrible.  If I go back to the RTI International study (perhaps the best), DARE was less effective than smaller programs.  It doesn't surprise me because the DARE brand seemed more important than the outcome once it became large.  It is like a certain cancer group that started out with good intentions but soon the brand and fundraising became more important than the good deeds, so smaller organizations became more effective.  

I had to do a mock debate on this in college where I had to defend DARE so I may be slanted a bit.  My initial research was focused mostly on looking at what was wrong with the studies.",2016-10-27 23:09:02+00:00,d9aocvg,1.0,t3_59qpwq,5185.0,todayilearned

338,"&gt; I don't think Americans really get how much their politics is shifting right

I would characterize it as shifting to the extremes, not shifting right or left.  If I assume that LGBT rights, legalization of marijuana, expanded first amendment rights, and Obamacare are all progressive compared to 35 years ago our *laws* and *interpreted law* are quite a bit to the left of where they used to be.

It used to be acceptable to be a pro-choice Republican, a pro-life Democrat, a Republican who was strong on civil rights and the environment, or a Democrat who was a conservative Christian.  That is no longer the case.  So while the law continues to shift leftward the parties are both gravitating to the extremes and pulling the American people with them (or vice-versa).

There is no doubt that Trump is a demagogue.  You won't get an argument from me.  I believe Clinton is as well, she is just more polished in her demagoguery.

I look back on the very partisan stances that Obama took while he was running for office.  At the end of the day he didn't live up to those stances.  Being the president has a great pull to the center.  Obama didn't close gitmo.  Bush was a great advocate for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment.  Clinton (Bill) was the great triangulator.  Reagan went from the evil empire to a friendship with the leader of the evil empire that lasted to his death.  Your criticisms of Trump are largely fair.  Please take the same critical look at Clinton.  It is more useful to take a critical look at your own candidate.

Almost none would point out that he paved the way for our current relationship with China, that he established the EPA to address the incredible pollution of the 60's (Cleveland's river even caught fire), his support and signing of Title IX which forced public schools to fund girl's sports equal to boy's sports, or that he ended the draft.  Nixon accomplished things that were near and dear to the hearts of today's liberals but partisanship will only allow us to focus on the evil and make him out to be even worse than he was.

Instead, the cars that already pitted are still on the lead lap so no wave-around needed.  Joey starts at the tail end of the longest line.  Everybody else falls in after their yellow flag pit stop.

It is the job of the city council member for your district to get what is best for your district first.

It is the mayor's job to lead to ensure that all council members get some of what they want and the city gets what is best for the city.  You can make the same argument for state legislators and governors.

When you get to the federal level, the same thing holds, but there is the extra layer of international politics.  Now, what is best for the world may be best for the United States, but not always.  It is always the charter of the President and the other two branches of government to do what is best for the United States.  The entire Constitution is written around the assumption that the branches of government act in the best interests of the United States.

My belief that the root cause is voting scores and pledges.  Those used to not be a thing, now they are a thing on both sides.  When I was young there were vocal pro-life Democrats and pro-choice Republicans.  There were conservative Democrats.  There were liberal Republicans.  Basically, your party didn't have to define all your beliefs.

If the political climate of reaching across the aisle was the same as it was in the 1980s, but with the current progress on issues, a politician in Washington could be for gay marriage, for legalization of pot, for abortions in the first trimester only, for increase in taxes, for changes in gun registration, a staunch supporter of the second amendment, against Obamacare, and for smaller government.  They would call that person a centrist, and that person could have an R or D after their name.

Now, that person couldn't make it past a primary because their abortion, gun, and tax score wouldn't work out and they would not get either party to support them.

The sad thing is that we the people have allowed this tomfoolery to polarize us as well, to the point that we call each other stupid for having an opinion different from our own.

502,"Put apart any feelings about Trump's fitness for office, one needs to look at what happens if Trump wins.

The Democratic party goes into disarray. The power base of the Democratic party; Bill, Hillary, both Obamas, Blominthal, Gore and all the large donors in the party worked together, put over $100M into the campaign,  and they couldn't even beat Trump? Add in that they even had the support of Romney, Whitman, and the Bush family and the full support of the printed press, NBC, CBS, ABC, and CNN. With all of that, Clinton should have at least a 15 point lead. If she lost, the Democratic party goes into disarray and the finger pointing would last for years. 

Then look at the Republicans.  If Trump wins then the Bushes are done running for office. Kasich is done. Romney has money but is stripped of power. Whitman will never run for office. Paul Ryan and all Republicans who spoke out against Trump are through. Whether Trump wins or loses, the party needs to face a great divide but if he wins the power structure completely changes. People in power like to stay in power.

Trump is showing that the press is losing control of their power. Never before have they made such an obvious choice to not report any critical article on one candidate,  despite the flood of potentially damaging emails that could sway the middle. People in power like to stay in power.

I honestly think this only boils down to power. A Trump loss puts the Republicans into disarray but the powerful stay in power. A Trump win causes those in power to lose power.

&gt; If we'd cut the action definition down to just the time when everyone on the field is running around looking for something to do

That is quite the way to describe a ball in play.  Baseball fans know that the game is much more than ""running around looking for something to do"", which is the point.  Getting a reaction is far more important than writing a good sports article.

Just to be sure you get a reaction, you better take swipes at other sports or else the baseball haters might not react.

529,"1) Whitewater - her business partners were sent to prison.  She somehow was able to get off without being convicted of anything.  

2) Whitewater - documents missing for months, subpoenaed incriminating documents, were found in the residence at the White House.  She had no idea how they got there.

3) Kathy Shelton - While I would not hold it against Clinton that she defended a rape victim, as she was appointed and defendants deserve competent council, a vigorous defense should not include personal attacks on a 12 year old victim.  That was over the line for almost any defense attorney.

4) Kath Shelton - Clinton has never, to my knowledge, shown anything but callous in this case.  While people can interpret her laughter as they will, there was nothing in the tapes to show any empathy for the child rape victim.

5) Kathy Shelton - There is an ethics question at stake if Clinton put forth a defense that she knew to be false.  This is a fine line because Clinton believed her defense to be false, but it is difficult to say she ""knew"" it was false.

6) Juanita Broaddrick - Hillary chose to intimidate and try to silence an alleged rape victim.  We could argue all day long whether Broaddrick was or wasn't actually raped, but either way you cannot successfully argue to me that Clinton should have done anything to intimidate or coerce an alleged victim of rape.

7) Kathleen Wiley - There is ample evidence that the Clinton engaged in a smear campaign of Ms. Wiley, even though she was an alleged victim of sexual assault.  

8) Server - Although there is question of who knew what when, there is clear evidence that Clinton's server was tampered with post-subpoena.  Clinton claims she ordered the email deletion prior to the subpoena, but that is in dispute.  The fact remains that the server was tampered with after the subpoena.

9)  Server - every staff member involved in illegal activity with respect to Clinton's server was granted immunity.  That normally happens with lower level people so you can gain a conviction with higher level people, and as part of the deal you gain full access to all the potential evidence.  In this case, a bunch of immunity was granted to people and their evidence was declared off-limits.  For what?  Why do this if the belief that no crime was committed?  It doesn't pass the sniff test.

10) Server - Secret meeting between Bill and the AG.  One lucky reporter was able to scoop the story or we would know nothing about this meeting just days before the decision not to indict.

11) Timing of interviews and email releases by the FBI show collusion and political favoritism.  In isolation it isn't much, but adds to the story.

12) Leaked emails.  Lots of nuggets in there to make me not like her.

13)  Benghazi - incompetence at best.  Dishonesty at worst.  

14) Press collusion - the bread crumbs of evidence that shows Clinton working directly with the press in a political campaign makes her seem questionable.

15) Net worth of over $100M.  How does a public servant who left the White House ""broke"" and then stayed as a senator for 8 years and Secretary of State amass a $100M fortune independent of Bill's fortune?

That's enough for now.  Notice that I left Bill's mistresses out of the equation.  I think they knowingly become targets for attacks by the wife.  The alleged victims of sexual assault do not.

People can explain away any singular thing on this list but the totality of this is that scandal, mudslinging, and political power above everything else follows Clinton around like the dirt cloud follows pig-pen.  People can try to explain the totality by blaming a vast right-wing conspiracy but other Democrats like Jimmy Carter, Tip O'Neil, Barack Obama, and Al Gore never had a career as filled with these vast right-wing attacks.  Sure, they suffered partisan political attacks, but no list like this.

Where there is smoke there is fire and each time I see smoke I wonder how the fire will be hidden this time.  Looking at the totality I can come to no other outcome than that she is a power-hungry person who wears a suit of teflon and she will not let human decency or honesty get in the way of her political or monetary ambitions.

TL;DR  One has to choose to continuously look the other way to ignore the countless scandals.

Most women don't engage in the fake outrage that is all the rage.  They make their mind up based on issues that are important to them.  Those issues are as diverse as men's issues, but somewhat shifted.

There are many women who are more outraged over the current political system than they are over Trump's comments.  They may see him as an equal opportunity asshole.  Perhaps they think that the political parties need a wrecking ball at this point, and a Trump win would be a wrecking ball for both parties.

Still other women just see Clinton as a woman they loathe.  Hypocritical on women's issues, willing to target sexual assault and rape victims, and not somebody who is the least bit likeable to them.  Men may dislike women they perceive as bitches, but women *hate* other women that they perceive as bitches.

561,"There were nearly 14,000 people discharged under DADT.  Others who were forced out because of rumors of being gay.  Hundreds  of thousands more were for forced to live a lie but weren't caught.  We have no idea how many people committed suicide after being caught.  Like many people who served during that time, I knew people from each of the above category.

Below is the text that affects the change.  Nothing prevented prison.  However, immediately before DADT I hadn't heard of anybody going to prison.  If you are trying to equate practices from decades before with what did or didn't happen with DADT then you are reaching.

&gt; (d) SENSE OF CONGJEIESS.—It is the sense of Congress that— lo use 654 note.
(1) the suspension of questioning concerning homosexuality as part of the processing of individuals for accession into the Armed Forces under the interim policy of January 29, 1993, should be continued, but the Secretary of Defense mav reinstate that questioning with such questions or such revised questions as he considers appropriate if the Secretary determines that it is necessary to do so in order to effectuate the policy set forth in section 654 of title 10, United States Code, as added by subsection (a); and

&gt; (2) the Secretary of Defense should consider issuing guidance governing the circumstances under which members of the Armed Forces questioned about homosexuality for administrative purposes should be afforded warnings similar to the warnings under section 831(b) of title 10, United States Code (article 31(b) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice).

Just in case you weren't aware, these words are part of the same bill.

&gt; The presence in the armed forces of persons who demonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts would create aa imacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability. 

All it took was somebody pointing the finger of blame that you have a propensity to commit homosexual acts and the military could start asking questions.  And, if you were caught having sex with your boyfriend there was absolutely nothing preventing the military from imprisoning you until they threw you out.

Instead of just jumping to ""that's a lie"" you should actually read the policy.  ",2016-10-11 04:01:35+00:00,d8mwa8h,8.0,t1_d8muxq0,2056.0,lgbt

Maybe you didn't read my post.  I wasn't saying they could do ""more"" at the time.  My point was that DADT was effectively nothing and there is a reasonable argument to be made that the appearance of a compromise only delayed human rights.

564,"&gt; From what I've researched on this subject, there was talk of a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage, which would have been able to pass at the time. If DOMA was rejected, then the amendment would have happened, and would have been considerably more difficult to later repeal.
&gt; When you look at how things work in politics, DOMA isn't as damning as one would imagine. Something anti-gay was going to happen, and this was the best of the worst.
&gt; The same email you cite as your source also says that Hillary does not want to double down on this event, and mentions her opposition to the bill once it went to court.

We have to be careful when rationalizing legislation that restricts human rights by saying that another alternative could be worse.  An example I will give is another Clinton gem - Don't Ask, Don't Tell.

Bill was able to collect some points, look like he was catering to gay rights, by having something that, on the surface, looked like he was progressing human rights.

But, as somebody who was in the military at the time, it was politics without any substantive change in practice.  Upon entering the military, they couldn't ask if a person was a homosexual.  Great, you don't have to lie to get in.  However, people were still kicked out for being caught with their boyfriend.  People who might have confided in a friend that his roommate was actually his lover were gone.  If a letter back home was found and read, a man writing his letter to his boyfriend was kicked out.  Even a few too many beers at a party could expose secrets that end your time in the military.  You no longer had to lie to get in, but it kept firmly in place the more difficult part of living a lie to stay in.

So, with no real change in policy but lots of hoopla over the politics, DADT was kept around far too long.  ""We quit asking them, what more do they want?""  One could argue that the ""compromise"" caused longer suffering than if the progressives would have just held out for something of substance.

The same goes for DOMA, in my opinion. ",2016-10-10 19:54:54+00:00,d8mb32q,4.0,t1_d8m2zvf,9853.0,lgbt

The tax rate becomes almost irrelevant when you add in the loopholes put in place by both parties.

For example, if Mexico were to gain enough wealth and economic stability, then we could make more successful agreements to end drug trafficking.

687,"&gt; Any reasonable scientist would agree that it is time to test another hypothesis, as this one appears to be disproven.

I disagree with your statement.  A reasonable scientist would not look at data accumulated over time, where nearly every single variable changed and there was no control case, and then choose one single variable, weigh the correlation, and make a declaration as bold as yours.  Science doesn't work that way and pretending that tax law is the **only** variable at play shows a horrible misunderstanding of both the issue and science.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/SCaev) is a graph of income in America.  Tax law may well have contributed to that.  I would go so far as to say it is likely.  If I take the start of the divergence to be mid 70's, we can start to list the things that have changed during that time:

* The rise of the Middle East
* Nixon's trip to China preceded the mid-70's but the start of China as a manufacturing base can be traced to that time.
* The rise in popularity of Japanese cars
* Free trade agreements
* Disproportionate environmental regulations between countries
* Taxes, on every level
* Systematic weakening of unions

So, just curious, how do you ignore every variable and declare that ""reasonable scientists"" would ignore them as well?

To the point where we continue to create an economy where a college degree is required for even reletively low paying jobs and we fail to invest in education while simultaneously putting tenure and teachers unions above quality education, we continuously fail to educate our younger generation in such a way that they are competitive against lower cost college educated people around the world.

* The balance of the inventory cost shall be paid upon delivery.
* The balance of the contract shall be paid within 90 days of the conclusion of the work.

He should be.  A reasonable businessman would have required cash prior to securing inventory, enough to cover the majority of the inventory.  He would have then required cash on delivery.  Finally, he would allow payment according to his T's and C's for the labor some time after delivery.

997,"Although I applaud your extensive post, and I promise to read through most of them, let me start with the first one I completely read.

I thought your Hicks and Devaraj study was interesting, because the conclusion you came to goes against everything else I read.  Hicks and Duvaraj state that, in total, there were 5.6M manufacturing jobs lost from 2000 - 2010.  Yet the Economic Policy Institute (left leaning) reports that 3.2M manufacturing jobs were outsourced to China alone from 2000 - 2013.  Now Hicks and Duvaraj concede there are problems with their corrections for international trade, but it looks from the numbers like their flaws are fatal.  

Even if we stipulate that 3.2M manufacturing jobs were outsourced to China *and* the total outsourcing to all countries doesn't rise to the level of the majority of manufacturing jobs, that is still a substantial loss.  EPI also discusses the trickle effect of these job losses, not the least of which is wage depression.  Also, you missed two vague words in your source, ""recent years"".

The rest of your post is pretty tin foil hattish, assuming that other countries will just jump directly to trade war if we attempt to renegotiate the trade agreements, which is about as likely as Trump fulfilling all his promises to begin with.

The Freedom of Information Act states otherwise.

Furthermore, by making that argument and deviating from the prescribed talking points, you are stipulating that the FBI is timing the release of information to align with weekend news cycles in an effort to match with a pre-planned timing of public consumption.

So, don't help anybody because you don't want to favor children whose parents are actively involved? 

&gt; Students with disabilities don't have choices because charters and private schools don't have to offer an appropriate education to every student in the way that public schools do.

First, that simply isn't true.  There are many schools that cater to children with disabilities.  Even if it was true, you are reverting to the ""it doesn't help everybody so we should help nobody"" argument.

&gt; Charters and privates are not subject to the sort of oversight that public schools are subject to.

Not true.  Charters often have to prove they are out-performing in order to keep getting funding.
&gt;  there are no large-scale studies that suggest charter schools do better than public schools. 

According to the Center for Public Education, ""On average, nationally, students in 17 percent of charter schools performed significantly better than if they had attended their neighborhood traditional public school.""

Also, this isn't just about charter schools.  School choice also involves moving your child to a better performing traditional public school or private school

&gt; every student who gets their choice takes resources away from public schools.

There is no swelling.

No blistering

It was ""caught on tape"" but not in the way the headline suggests.  It was a blurb from an interview ~~before~~ *the day after* the Iowa caucuses.  It wasn't an accidental open mic moment, or anything similar, that one thinks about when hearing caught on tape.

She wasn't Trump's campaign manager at the time, although she is now and has to answer for the things she said then.  I just wanted to clear up that this isn't a recent event or anything that has happened since joining Trump's team.  She was supporting Trump's opponent and was saying negative things about all of Cruz's opponents in the interview.  That was her job.

The article says ""some of his supporters are way over their skeeze and have been downright nasty."" which I find rather funny because the author of the article couldn't even be bothered to understand what she actually meant.  They weren't over their ""skeeze"", they were over their skis. Skeeze is a slang combination of skank and sleeze.

Sounds like you are dealing with stereotypes and not really listening to the music.  Popular artists with minimal talent exist in every genre.  I challenge you to find a band in any genre with a better mix of musicians than Zac Brown Band though.  Every musician in the band has incredible range and can stand on their own as an act.  Check out some of their musicfest videos, or better yet go to a concert and educate yourself.

Vince Gill has one of the amazing voices in any genre of music.  He is a bit long in the tooth now, but his voice is timeless and his ability to roam around the stage and play anything with strings shows he is among the most talented musicians ever.  Check him out on the [guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5SPQtq6GMk) and his [voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znWhF7HWOxs&amp;list=RDznWhF7HWOxs&amp;index=1).

1460,"I am in the minority.  I don't care about his tax returns or the tax returns of any other person seeking office.  I assume he is minimizing his tax burden (which he should be doing) and staying within the law.

The problem is that the media has convinced the American people that there is something important to discover.  In reality it only leads to stories like:

- Candidate A among the poorest to ever run for President
- Candidate B only paid 11% in taxes, while this random teacher who did her own taxes paid 29%.
- Candidate C only contributed 3% to charity while their opponent contributed 15%.  
- etc.

None of that matters to me.  We have allowed the media to set up a system where people need to start planning at least 5 years ahead of running for office as they fill out their taxes.  Don't take too big of a deduction, but make sure you contribute enough to charity.  Ensure your charitable donations are to a safe church, nothing too fringe.  Don't itemize anything that can be scrutinized.  Plan your charities to avoid questions.

Then, when a wealthy candidate does that, the press will ask for 8 years of tax returns.

It is all just a different flavor of gotcha journalism.  If we think that tax returns are so important, pass a law to make that a requirement.  My opinion is that it is none of your opinion what taxes I pay, and it is none of my business what a candidate pays.

Monogamy is prevalent mostly because of religious teachings.

Perhaps religions drove monogamy partially because leaders realized it cut down on disease that mostly provided for everybody to have a mate so the population was happier.

Women were effectively chattel until the 1960's in the US.  Often people looked the other way if men had affairs.  Wives were almost property as soon as the vows were read.

1646,"Your belief that there is or is not a logical reasoning behind rights is flawed.  Rights aren't logical.  Rights are derived by humans and, despite popular theory, handed down to us by our government.

It is logical that human life is held in higher regard than animal life.  Humans, by nature, care more about their parents than their neighbors.  They care more about their neighbors than a stranger in another part of the country. They care more about their countrymen than a stranger on the other side of the world.  There are exceptions, but that is directionally correct.  It is logically correct.  It is our nature and that empathy cascade is seen in other intelligent animals as well.

Let's take the logic above and apply it to human/animal interaction.  Most people are going to care more for their pet dog than a stranger around the world.  Likewise they will care more for their dog, or their child, than a cow from parts unknown.  The logic, and human nature, remains intact.

Part of the reason for this layered empathy is our ability to communicate and, for lack of a better phrase, get to know the person/animal in question.  It is entirely logical that a baby would be seen as a more important life than a cow.  We won't get to know that cow.  The cow's influence on our life is non-existent and it's potential is severely limited.

Humans have a natural instinct to save themselves first, their family second, and their tribe third.  It is how we got to the evolutionary place that we are.  A child, or another person, has the ability to affect me, my family, and my tribe.  Your five ants have no tangible effect.

1649,"&gt; It began in May, when the Bundys complained about not having internet access in their cells, citing a need to post on Facebook and send emails.

Ammon Bundy declared that he was going to sue the jail for violating his civil rights, especially his Second Amendment rights. Because people in jail should be allowed to keep their guns.

Think back to a year or so ago.  The Bundys were radical right wing idiots living in the free world.  What do you suppose their reaction would have been if President Obama announced that all federal prisoners would have printers, scanners, video editing software, wireless internet, computers, and comfortable chairs in prison?

1693,"&gt; For profit prisons are incentivized to cut costs.

As should any government run facility, whether it is a prison, school, or cafeteria.  Trying to parse the difference is silly.  There should be basic requirements and the government entity or private company should be required to provide for those requirements at a minimum cost.

&gt; Where no government agency has an inherent incentive to put more people in jail, a private prison company will actively lobby in favor of more draconian laws to make sure that more people go to prison for less severe crimes because that's how they make money

That's the narrative, but the reality is that there is a whole ecosystem around the criminal justice system and a host of industries that have a vested interest in people being in prison.  You don't solve that simply by switching who runs the prison.

&gt;  Private prison will always look for places it can 'save money' which starts with slashing rehab

To start down this train of thought, you need to start by showing some data that government run prisons rehabilitate their residents.

I am a believer that the criminal justice system needs an overhaul from top to bottom, starting with a hard look at why we send people to prison (or why we shouldn't be sending people there).

Koppel became famous through the launching of ABC's Nightline.  Nightline came on the air as a nightly news program in response to the Iran hostage crisis.

It was popular and profitable for both ABC and Koppel.

One could argue that Koppel and Nightline taught the networks, CNN, and the other cable news networks that would follow that the news could be filled, could be profitable, could be talked about, even when there was no real new details.

1807,"&gt; I found it strange that we can consider pedophilia a psychological disorder, because it makes an individual attracted to another who are deemed not mature enough to engage in sex; and male impotence a disorder, because an individual is unable to reproduce; but homosexuality is immune to such categorization because it's referred to as just an expression of love even though it significantly lowers the chance of an individual to pursue reproductive intercourse.

The first example means there is an external victim, or potential victim, involved.  The second example has the suffering person as less than whole.  Nobody who doesn't want to have sex or masterbate complains about impotency.  It is a disorder because somebody is physically incapable of the sexual act.

Homosexuality has no victim.  Homosexuals are not physically unable to engage in the sex they desire because of a medical condition called homosexuality.  

Your examples fall flat.  The reason your view has never changed is because you see homosexuality through the same lens as pedophilia and impotence.  I believe this is at the root of your belief.",2016-08-17 18:33:29+00:00,d6lhu9m,1.0,t3_4y6zm1,3146.0,changemyview

1920,"I think you make some good points for alternative arguments but they aren't especially relevant to the minimum wage debate.

&gt; But we make search engines, and apps and all kinds of new things like Uber that generate all kinds of new wealth that support huge ecosystems of high paying service jobs like doctors, lawyers, bankers etc.

The technology jobs (search engines, apps, and Uber software) are not immune to outsourcing.  What you have is wealth at the upper end of the spectrum while the middle class programming and support jobs being sent overseas.  The only people in the industries affected by minimum wage are the cafeteria workers, janitors, and the like in the US offices.

&gt; So what we're likely to see with a $15 minimum wage is substantially more economic activity at the bottom of the income scale. 

How does that help?  The lower class is still the lower class.  Inflation keeps their standard of living low, and the economic activity is largely durable and non-durable goods made outside the US.  The economic activity largely results in money overseas, in investors pockets, and some service jobs at local stores.  You cannot raise wages to make a middle class.

&gt; But those jobs were probably going away anyway...

A scary concession.  I prefer to work to bring those jobs back.  Vertical industries with heavy manufacturing influence built the middle class in the western world and that is what is building the middle class in the developing world.

1921,"You are using pot as an example, but I assume you can extrapolate that to any crime that they do not agree with.  Let's expand on that.

There are two ways to go with this.  One solution is that people only take the job as a cop if they agree with every single law they are required to enforce.  That solution isn't really the way to go, unless you want an Officer Fife around every corner.  

The other way to go is to let every cop decide which laws he/she will enforce.  Don't like the speeding law?  No problem.  Don't agree with laws against drugs?  No problem.  Don't agree that laws against civil rights abuses are necessary?  No worries.  Don't enforce that law.  The result is a police force that is wildly inconsistent with a system that is ripe for abuse.  Do we know whether that cop didn't bust the drug dealer because of a moral objection, or because he is on the take?

The real answer lies in between.  Cops are allowed a degree of judgement.  They don't have to ticket everybody over the speed limit or arrest everybody who technically violates the law.  But that cannot go overboard.  All cops have to enforce laws they might not agree with.  That's their job.

As for your reference to the Nuremberg trials, there is no equivalence.  Enforcing a law that you don't agree with does not equal following orders in the most systematic mass murder of the 20th century.  That is just absurd.",2016-08-03 21:22:14+00:00,d631jim,1.0,t3_4w0sr6,1651.0,changemyview

1923,"&gt; The burger flipper at BK has a value. She is employed because the cost is less than the value. This value, by best guess, is somewhere in the 20/hour range. So long as the cost to employ her stays below this value, she will keep her job, the prices won't go up, the employer won't start looking at grey markets etc.

This is fundamentally flawed as it assumes no alternatives and no effects.

Let's take the latter first.  As a business owner, I expect a certain ROI and a certain RONA.  Let's artificially set that at 10%.  Any investment I make, into assets, labor, or anything else needs to get me a 10% return or it is a bad investment because I know I can get 10% return elsewhere.  As my labor/hour/person costs increase, I need to either cut costs elsewhere or raise my prices to receive my minimum required ROI.  How do I do that?  Cut benefits.  Cut workers.  Cut hours.  Increase my prices.  Etc.  I don't just suffer the diluted investment return without acting.  Maybe I even close up shop and invest in another business that is less labor dependant that gives me the ROI.

Let's look at alternatives.  Right now there is a soft cap on oil price.  As technology progresses, that soft cap lowers.  Why is there a soft cap?  Because at $50/bbl alternative energy technology A becomes profitable.  At $75/bbl, alternative energy technology B becomes profitable.  At $100/bbl, almost every alternative energy technology becomes profitable.  And each time the oil price reaches those thresholds new money is put into alternative energy technology to lower the thresholds.  Fast food labor is the same.  At $3/hour I have no incentive to invest in technology to reduce labor.  At $6/hour I may bring in a consultant to institute the basics of lean manufacturing into my business.  (Believe it or not, Toyota's success has fundamentally changed how your burger is made in a chain restaurant).  So at $6/hour I need fewer man-hours per burger.  At $15/hour it becomes extremely attractive to invest in ordering kiosks, auto-drink dispensers, and maybe even machines to cook, assemble, and box the burgers.

Here's where I will challenge: Do you assert that gender identity disorder doesn't exist as a disorder based on the fact that there is very credible evidence that transition is helpful to the psychological health?

My deeper concern is that by removing GID as a disorder we are robbing people of the psychological help that, based on my anecdotal evidence, is often very helpful in sorting through the emotional and psychological issues that come with being transexual.

Let me spell out two scenarios, both extreme, to make a point.

First, let's pretend that there are exactly zero gay republicans.  A ridiculous assumption, but it serves a point.  Would there be increased gay prostitute business?  Of course, because there were reporters, producers, convention workers, literally thousands of people on business trips who were not republicans.  Female prostitution would also increase,  because clearly in my example there are straight people in town on business as well. 

Now,  let's pretend that every republican is a closet homosexual.  Well,  female prostitution wouldn't decrease,  it would stay flat. Now,  factor in all the media and workers.  Female prostitution now increases.

I am not going to reply to all, but let me just pick a few lines.

&gt; The first 4 word of your response admit that there is a problem, then the rest of the response is a defense of the officer's actions. 

First, I am not offering an opinion on this case at all.  Clearly this is the exception.  As stated, my post was meant as a macro statement revolving around the question in the title.  More importantly, I am not defending any officer's actions.  I am suggesting that the problem needs to be looked at wholistically.  The issue of racism is well argued already.  My intent was to acknowledge and move on.  My further attempt was to frame the issue as one with multiple causes and failure to address any major contributing factor will fail to move the needle on the problem.

&gt; Nor do they allow for passive aggressiveness

That was a fair dig at my post.

&gt; Yes we do. That's the responsibility an officer accepts we he straps on a gun.

Not unless we have robo-cops patrolling.  It just isn't a reasonable expectation to expect a cop on a traffic stop in rural Montana to act with the same degree of caution as a cop stopping a car in a gang infested area of Chicago.  If that were the case then either the cop in Chicago would be too vulnerable and at-risk or the cop in Montana would be Barney Fife.  There has to be a balance and I don't believe that anybody here or anywhere else would be expected to act the same in both scenarios.

Finally, your five examples address only one side of the issue.  I suggest that, despite your wonderful post, you are not looking at the problem wholistically.  I am an engineer by training and through most of my career, a centrist, and pragmatic by nature.  I have never seen a problem worth this much attention that can be resolved by looking at only one side of the issue.  I would argue that, regardless of race, there is a higher likelihood of a suspect being shot in a high crime area than a low crime area and if we only put the solution at the feet of the police then we are ignoring the responsibility of the community to change their own fate through their own self-critical analysis and action.

2037,"There is a problem.  Of that, I don't think anybody disagrees.  Demagoguing the issue helps nothing.

First, there is a problem with your title.  A single event doesn't indicate a national problem any more than a hot or cold day proves or disproves climate change.  If you want to craft a reasonable argument that there is a nationwide problem, use statistics instead of a single incident.  Statistics don't strike up the emotion though, correct?

Second, let's identify the possibilities here.  The problem could be perception.  Often the outrage and emotion after a police shooting turns out to be misdirected.  The problem could be rampant racism among police officers.  The problem could also be that black suspects could have a higher likelihood in some areas to fight, run, engage in other violence, or be armed.

The third possibility shown above is too often overlooked by people who want to point a finger of blame.  There is no doubt that an officer who works an area frequented by drugs, gangs, and violent criminals will be more likely to be aggressive, pull his weapon, or shoot the suspect.  Do we expect an officer in south Chicago to be as casual as the cop in a suburban or rural setting with low crime?  That seems a bit unreasonable to me.

I would suggest that the path to lower the number of black men being killed by police should at least involve acknowledging that the  behavior of black men in urban environments contributes to the police being on edge.  The best way for a problem to be solved is for all sides to be open and honest about the problem and the contributing factors.  I don't see that openness and honesty here.

But Obama is walking a fine line here.  He has endorsed a movement that claims that entire police departments are racist and discriminatory.  He never asked them to temper their language.  He never required nuance from the BLM folks.  He never cared to point out that many of the people who are killed are non-compliant wrt police orders.  He has endorsed their extreme rhetoric.

Now, when the rhetoric has lead to violence he is trying to simultaneously disavow the violence while still endorsing the movement.  It can be said that, without a doubt, the leaders of the movement and the perpetrators of violence are supporters of Obama.

That doesn't make Obama responsible for the violence.

2181,"&gt; While that was an improvement over the CURRENT state of things in the military,

I disagree.  It was pandering at its finest without actually changing a thing.  New recruits weren't asked if they were gay on entry, but they could still be asked at any time.  They couldn't bring same-sex dates to functions.  They were still removed if they were discovered by their roommates in a homosexual relationship.  They were still forced to live and act as though they were straight.  If a hetrosexual couple were found having sex they were reprimanded at most.  If a gay couple was found having sex they were both kicked out.

2182,"&gt; When Bill Clinton came in our economy was in a deficit (GDP) and turned it into a surplus before he left office.

Reasonably this should be credited to Bill Clinton and the Newt Gingrich.  One could reasonably argue the credit split, but the budget wouldn't have been balanced without Gingrich shutting down the government or without Clinton being willing to work. 

&gt; We created a global economy under Bill Clinton (NAFTA).

NAFTA was negotiated by H.W. Bush and signed before Clinton took office.

&gt; So please, don't say Reagan boomed the economy, he was in office 10 years ago and Bill Clinton taxed the rich more, Reagan didn't.

Please explain.  Doesn't compute.  Clinton left office in 2001.  Reagan left office in 1989.

They teach it is literally better for a gay man to kill other gays than to act on his homosexual feelings.

I am not asking them to change everything, but I think their beliefs are pretty fucked up and lead to homophobia and violence or discrimination against gays regardless of the softness of their condemnation into hell.

2303,"Chastity and homosexuality

2357 Homosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the same sex. It has taken a great variety of forms through the centuries and in different cultures. Its psychological genesis remains largely unexplained. Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity,141 tradition has always declared that ""homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.""142 They are contrary to the natural law. They close the sexual act to the gift of life. They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved.

2358 The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial. They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition.

2359 Homosexual persons are called to chastity. By the virtues of self-mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support of disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, they can and should gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection.",2016-06-27 13:03:51+00:00,d4ps7hg,1.0,t3_4q37pd,12.0,lgbt

&gt; many immigration advocates 

Now,  why would the article paint the two sides of the issue as immigration advocates and anti-immigration?  Why would be conflate the issues of legal and illegal immigration?  In this case,  the author actually means advocates of illegal immigration,  not legal immigration. Many, if not most, who oppose illegal immigration actually support legal immigration. 

The author dismisses the federal crime statistics because they represent a small percentage of the criminal cases.  I think that is a fair argument,  if the state crime statistics are counter to federal crime statistics, particularly in states with significant numbers of illegal immigrants.  The author doesn't compare federal statistics with similar state statistics though because it doesn't bolster his argument.  That means his dismissal should actually be dismissed. Instead,  the author refers to macro level crime statistics,  without controlling any variables.

The liberalism of China is the genesis of China becoming a world player.  China has been a powerful but relatively regional power for centuries and was content, for the most part, with a ""Don't Fuck With Us, We Won't Fuck With You"" policy.  Nobody would invade them, but by and large we didn't fear an attack.  We also didn't expect them to act if two other countries went to war.  At least for the most part.

The liberalism of China is changing that.  As they become an incredible economic superpower, thanks largely to them becoming more liberal, they have a greater vested interest in becoming a military superpower that holds sway over the globe.

So, liberalism isn't required for a country to become a superpower but because of China's culture it is a major influencer in *it* becoming a superpower.

2366,"&gt; hardly, we don't want or need your military.

Your government disagrees, despite your emotional, whiny, bratty declaration.  That is why your country entered into the Ogdensburg Agreement with the US and later entered into NATO.  By the very fact that your government signed defense agreements with the US, your country is stating that it wants and needs the US military.  In the case of NATO, it is stating that it wants and needs the military of all NATO countries despite the fact that very few of the NATO countries actually have an effective fighting force.

I assume since you ""don't want or need"" the US military, you will return the following equipment:

* Boeing CC-177 Globemaster III
* Lockheed CC-130E/H Hercules
* Lockheed CP-140 Aurora
* Lockheed Martin CC-130J Super Hercules
* McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet
* Raytheon CT-156 Harvard II
* Boeing CH-147F Chinook
* GBU-10 Paveway II 
* Mark 82 bomb
* Mark 83 bomb
* Mark 84 bomb
* Joint Direct Attack Munition
* AGM-65G Maverick Missile
* AIM-7 Sparrow
* AIM-120 AMRAAM
* AIM-9 Sidewinder
* M61 20mm Vulcan cannon
* Mark 46 torpedo
* 60K Tunner
* Halvorsen 44K Loaders
* B-1200
* C15 Long Range Sniper Weapon 
* C13
* M203A1
* MILCOTS Silverado
* M-Gator
* Western Star 4900 series
* Bison
* Galion 850 series
* C2 Close Support Gun
* C3 Close Support Gun

All of these were developed by the US, as part of US military spending, for the US military.  They were later sold to your country.

While SC is larger than ISC, the list is updated by the same working group.

Just reminding you of your initial statement.

The mortality rate is:

Lowest - Overweight people
Second lowest - Normal weight people
Second highest - Obese people
Highest - Under weight people

Your premise was incorrect, at least according to this Mayo clinic study.  There are many benefits to being the ideal weigh, but I have seen no actual data to suggest that the mortality rate is lower for normal weight (defined in the study) compared to overweight people.

&gt;In a very nice study from the Mayo Clinic of 250,152 patients from 40 different studies, the influence of weight on outcomes was further explored. The authors found that the lowest risk of all types of mortality as well as heart related mortality was in those people considered overweight (BMI from 25-30). In fact the risk of death was 12 percent lower than those people considered normal weight (BMI 20-24.9). The highest risk of mortality was in the underweight patients (BMI &lt;20). Their risk was 37 percent higher than those people considered normal weight. Even their risk of heart disease related mortality was higher (45 percent higher) than those that were normal weight.

&gt;It was not until people had a BMI &gt;35 that there was a clear increased risk of heart disease related morality (80 percent increased risk) compared to normal weight people. This observation is a classic “U” shaped survival curve with the highest risks seen in those that were severely underweight or overweight, with the lowest part of the curve in those considered slightly overweight (BMI from 25-30).",2016-06-16 19:55:09+00:00,d4c1v7r,1.0,t3_4ofan3,56.0,todayilearned

A gangbanger in a large city, responsible for a lion's share of the murders, will pay a tax to get his bullets in his gun.  He doesn't consume bullets like a target shooter, his are only used for shooting at people and it is probably worth the premium.

A mass shooter is often investing in or stealing guns specifically for their crime.  In this case the person is already heavily investing in his crime, I don't see a tax making a difference.  Additionally, even in a mass shooting, the quantity of rounds consumed is relatively low compared to what a target shooter might consume in a couple trips to the range.

If somebody uses a gun to commit suicide, he likely has the single round he needs laying around the house.

2537,"The Orlando massacre has put both the right and left into quite a quandary.  That's why the reaction on social media has been so strange, so uncertain, so different.

The left needs to play to their base and protect their message.  Gun control is a message that plays well, even though nothing ever happens except that the American people buy a lot more guns and ammo every time it is brought up.  It's a good political message, as counter-productive as it has been up to this point.  

The left also needs to protect Islam.  It is fundamental to their message that Islam is the religion of peace.  If this was a Christian shooter, they could call out the intolerance and bigotry in the Evangelical Christian, Mormon, Catholic, and Jehovah's Witness teaching.  They can't do the same in the Muslim teachings, that is counter to the message.  They should, but it would be politically disastrous and politics wins above all.

The right, for their part, have to try to pin this all on ISIS and ignore the hate crime that happened.  ISIS, terrorism, and borders plays well to their base, even if it doesn't directly correlate to this particular instance.

From a practical standpoint, much of the Christian right sit in their church pews every Sunday and hear about how gays deserve god's judgement and deserve eternal punishment in hell.  If I believed in that hell, then I would have to think that it is much worse of a hell than just dying.  What are they supposed to say?  ""We are so sorry your son or daughter was slaughtered out of hate and now will face eternal damnation.""  It's a rough subject for them.  We know from past experience that if these deaths were from a fire or earthquake then some on the right would assume it was God's punishment.  So, ISIS it is.

CAIR, for its part, put out a statement condemning the murders.  They then compared themselves to gays on the persecution scale.  And, even as them condemned the murders and insisted that no minorities be discriminated against, the stopped short of demanding (or even hinting) that their religion needs to eliminate its anti-gay bias.

So, what do politicians do?  They resort to what works well with their base and gets them elected.  To hell with what actually helps to solve the problem.  Gun sales will spike, bombs will fall, people will grandstand.

Politically expedient is Clinton pretending that just changing some gun control laws will solve the problem, or Trump pretending we can solve the problem exclusively through immigration reform.  Throw up a simple solution that plays well to your base and ignore anything that requires you to spend a little political capital.

I would argue further that it is unacceptable for others to push their values on her, as though what the larger feminist community decides is right must be followed by each and every woman.  To me it is similar to professional women who look down on a stay-at-home mom for not having a profession.

You shouldn't be looking for all women to follow the same recipe regarding who asks who for a date, who pays the tab, who proposes, who has a career, etc.  You should be looking for a set of values that says it is okay for a woman to choose her own path, her own values, and just how ""modern"" or ""old-fashioned"" she chooses to be.

2547,"The LGBT community, and the sane world, should condemn any set of chosen beliefs that would have people see gay people as deserving of condemnation and suffering, whether in this life or their version of the afterlife.  Certainly Islam isn't the only religion that preaches hate, but it is one of the religions.

This type of chosen belief system not only leads to attacks on gays who do not have the same belief system, it's effects are harmful to a much broader set of gays who feel shame in silence because they were taught that who they are in their very core is worthy of eternal punishment.  It makes gay people commit suicide, live in misery and shame, and in some cases, lash out against other gays because they have been convinced to hate who they are.

My advice is that we should not allow any politician or leader to come up with the simple solution to complex problems.  In the US, Hilary will treat this as *just* a gun control issue.  Trump will treat this as *just* an ISIS issue.  Sure, they may say other words, but their approaches won't deal with anything more than what is politically expedient.

If you want some good to come out of all this, don't subscribe to these simple emotional arguments.  Use this event as a reason to show that archaic religious belief systems contribute to violence, self-shame, and suicide.

In basketball the fans will work to distract the visiting team during free throws.  Free throws are a mental exercise as much as anything.

I had a chance to work with a young man who immigrated from China.  He didn't know anything about baseball.  He had never watched it, never read about it, and didn't even know the terminology of ""ball"" and ""strike"".  I decided to take him to an MLB game as a fun night out.

The game was a struggle, moreso than I realized.  It was a difficult process explaining why one guy who hit the ball was able to stay on the base when the last guy who hit the ball didn't, why one guy didn't even get a chance to hit the ball, or why one team got to have 6 batters try and the other team only got to let 3 batters try.  Basically it was a fine line between explaining every single pitch and having him sit there lost.

He seemed to enjoy it though, he got on the big screen, which was cool, and everything was good.  The game was close, a pitcher's duel, and in the end he got to see the game end with a two run walk off home run.  I was so excited that his first game got to end in a walk off home run.

On the way to the car I asked him how he liked the game.  His response was golden.  ""I don't think I like baseball, Mr. Nofunhere, because as soon as somebody hits the ball over the fence the game is over.""",2016-06-08 20:08:59+00:00,d41czlf,1.0,t3_4n6bef,8532.0,sports

Second reason is that one would expect the driveshaft to come out in one piece, essentially sliding out of the gear box or an intermediate coupling.

After WWII, the pendulum swung to a position that used to be unfathomable for Americans. Free speech, as we see it, was trampled. People could be jailed for denying the holocaust or speaking out against religion. Laws were passed, but the underlying problem remains.

3087,"I have a story. I wish every person could meet a guy named Tony Stewart, a champion of civil rights and the first amendment.

Tony and I disagree on most political topics. I actually thought at one time that we only agreed on one topic, civil rights. In the end, I was wrong.

Tony spent decades fighting for civil rights. He taught at a college in Coeur d'Alene, ID. Just north of town, there was a group called the Aryan Nations, headed by a guy named Richard Butler. They had meetings and rallies on their compound, but they also were responsible for systematic harassment of minorities in the region. Their goal was to make a sovereign nation in the region where their racist views could flourish and be codified into law. These were bad folks. 

Tony was a thorn in their side and a stated target for attack. When the Aryan Nations sent it videotapes containing hate messages, Tony's group collected the tapes, copied their civil rights messages over the top, and handed them out to willing recipients. He thanked the Aryan Nations for the contributions.

So, there came a time when the Aryan Nations petitioned for a parade permit to have their little hate parade down the main street. Community members stepped up and wanted the city to deny the permit. Tony stepped in and insisted that people change their tune. The idiots got their parade permit and had the first of their parades. Their intent was to have one per year.

See, Tony fought these guys at every turn, except when it came to compromising his absolute belief in defending the first amendment. No matter how much he hated what these assholes stood for, he wouldn't stand in the way of their first amendment rights. Turned out that I agreed with Tony in a second topic.

Interestingly, Tony was eventually successful (with others) in having the compound sold and the Aryan Nations kicked off of the compound. But that was based on their illegal actions, not their words or thoughts.

- 1990's: Inter-racial marriage still frowned upon.  Gays are easy targets for violence.  Active white supremacist groups practice openly and own a compound in Idaho.
- 1980's: AIDS rears it's ugly head.  Most people turn their backs on victims and believe the gays deserve it.  Young boy is banned from school for being HIV positive.  Children of inter-racial couples heavily discriminated against.  Young men and women asked whether they are gay when they volunteer to join the military.
- 1970's: Laws against inter-racial marriage still on the books in some areas.  Strong racial tension.  Use of the word ""nigger"" in public is common.

3203,"Hey, maybe I can help.  My friend completed the transition about 4 years ago.  Obviously, everybody is different so take this with a grain of salt.

Number one, just be her friend and get ready to listen and not give advice.  You don't know what she is going through, so don't think you need to offer advice.  Just be the friend.

Second, don't be afraid to use humor.  If she is your lifelong friend, you know her sense of humor and what she will and won't find appropriate.  There is no reason to be any different from before in that regard.  Make jokes, you know the line.

Third, try hard to understand the line involving personal questions.  I was lucky here.  I asked a lot of questions, most of them were probably stupid, but she didn't mind.  I think it gave her somebody to talk details to.  But, again, you need to understand and make sure she feels safe in telling you when she prefers not to answer.  Expect the line of privacy to change.  After all, talking to a lady is often different from talking to one of the guys.

Fourth, educate yourself on the process.  Not just the physical process but the emotional one as well.  You are off to a good start.  Being able to talk at least somewhat intelligently to her will help you out and it will minimize your stupid questions.  Don't worry though, if you are like me you will still ask plenty of stupid questions.

Finally, treat her like a lady.  Not like a stranger, but like you would treat your other female friends.  It was weird at first for me, but if you open doors for other female friends then open her door.  If you buy her a gift, make it a feminine gift.  These things will make sure she knows that you are accepting her as a lady, not as one of the guys who will soon have boobs.  If you are treating her too much like a lady and not enough like an old friend, she will let you know.

The most likely scenario is that he has insurance. Each insurance company negotiates rates for every procedure that are different from the published rates.

For some items, the negotiated rate is as little as 10% the billed rate. For others, the negotiated rate is close to the billed rate. There is no rhyme or reason. Let's say the real bill is 50% what is shown here.

Now, the patient only pays a percentage of the real bill, depending on his deductible/co-insurance/copay. The insurance company pays the rest. Let's say his part is $2,000. Now he gets to negotiate further. Hospitals and doctors offices negotiate like a gypsy on an empty stomach.

3226,"Honestly, Sanders cannot beat Trump. Please read this post as a strategy post, not a pro Trump post. I really don't want Trump to win but, if Bernie is the nominee he will win.  Here's why:

Clinton cannot go after Sanders for his socialist leanings. She can hint, but she cannot beat him over the head with it during a primary because she has to go left to win the primary. He is able to keep beating his socialist drum relatively unscathed in the primary. That's goodness for him now, but he will lose beating that drum in the general.

The flip side is that in the general election, Bernie cannot go to the center. He isn't a center candidate, and he would piss off his base if he tries. Bernie is where he is because, whether or not you like his policies, he has been consistent for decades. He simply cannot dance to the center.

Trump will exploit that. Trump is already showing signs of picking up blue collar white democrats, which is a demographic which typically runs from the far left. White Joe the assembly line worker might love the union, but he hates socialists. Well, he hates what socialists are made out to be in the game of sound bites and bumper sticker politics. Bernie cannot get this vote against a centrist republican.

But Trump is not centrist, right? Well, he is actually already setting the stage for his run to the center. He will be ""flexible"" and ""negotiate"". He will stay unforgiving on illegal immigration, but will hammer home NAFTA and other trade agreements that hurt middle Americans. He will be the candidate for the middle class by telling people that the trade deals have hurt their jobs, their unions, and their families. See, white middle class and poor Americans are by and large looking for a fair shake and tend to reject the argument that the government will take care of them. They will mostly vote Trump.

Couple all of that with the fact that Sanders would be kicking as if young people actually got off their assess and voted, but that isn't happening. For too many young people, making internet posts and sharing Facebook crap is about as involved as they have cared to get.",2016-03-14 22:32:24+00:00,d0zwt68,1.0,t3_4af2ko,5681.0,politics

From the article:

&gt; It all started with a hit piece in the New York Daily News that went after Clinton for accepting $50,000 in political contributions from the American Muslim Alliance (AMA), a very mainstream Muslim political group.

&gt;She also returned $1,000 to the American Muslim Council (AMC) based on Emerson’s accusations that one of its board members had expressed support for Hamas.

Who is the AMA and AMC?

Well, the AMC was founded by American supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Brotherhood

The parent organization, American Muslim Political Coordination Council Political Action Committee, had ties to supporters of terrorism.  Call it a hit piece or not, the ties to terrorism are not really disputed.

This isn't Clinton throwing Muslims under the bus as much as it is Clinton being shamed into returning money from organizations with ties to terrorism.  If mainstream Muslims in the US feel thrown under the bus for that, we should probably evaluate what a ""mainstream"" American Muslim believes in.

3592,"Just a couple of minor issues with this piece.  First this quote:

&gt; People love to make up their own stories about American history, especially when it comes to politics.

Well, yeah.  Including the article linked.  First, Reagan and the Republicans were pandering to business, mostly because there were very little in the way of protections in place to prevent businesses from hiring illegal aliens at the time.  Also, the piece tends to leave out this little piece of history.  Reagan claimed that his amnesty program would be the first step in curbing illegal immigration, but the comprehensive reform never materialized.  Only the amnesty materialized.  It is considered among Republicans as Reagan's only real error and is the reason why comprehensive reform gave way to ""secure the borders first"" during W's administration.

Then there is this little gem:

&gt;A young Texan asks the trio whether illegal aliens—a term apparently already in vogue—should be able to attend Texas public schools for free, as citizens do.

Illegal alien is the factually correct term.  It isn't something that is in or out of vogue but rather the correct term.  Using any term that blurs the lines between legal and illegal immigration borders on dishonesty at best.  Terms like undocumented workers, undocumented immigrants, or simply immigrants are the terms that have come in vogue as a political ploy to convince hispanic citizens that they are in the same political bucket as illegal immigrants and, as such, hispanic citizens should vote for those who support open borders.  It is terribly effective as the hispanic vote has largely shifted to the left since the 1980's.

It is funny that an article that uses video as a ploy at honesty actually uses video to be intentionally dishonest.",2016-02-07 04:08:15+00:00,czqq5v6,1.0,t3_44jtlk,1453.0,politics

3618,"&gt; since you're a believer

You forgot the word ""if"". At a minimum, you are in for a rather nice eternity if you believe that an omnipresent being is your Lord and Savior. But if you aren't a believer, bad shit happens. How bad? Well, that depends on which church you go to. Besides just believing, some brands have a list of shall nots and should nots. If you do the should nots, you need to ask forgiveness. If you do the shall nots you are condemned to hell. Depending on the brand, you might even be required to hate the right people.

Guilt is a very important technique used in the indoctrination of the children. God is watching everything you do. You better do right or God will know. If you don't do right, well you will have to answer to it. Granny might even be watching down from heaven and will see you. 

Even if hell isn't specifically discussed, Satan is. Fear of Satan is instilled from a very young age and reinforced regularly. Ensuring that young children grow up into good religious adults is very much like any other indoctrination. Because science has removed the false logic that is the root of most religions, indoctrination is the only way to keep a young mind believing in a false entity.

3659,"&gt; Hillary Clinton once had a 50-point lead in Iowa, so by any measure the Bernie Sanders finish should be alarming to the former secretary of state and her supporters. Clinton was supposed to be better organized and better positioned in Iowa, but the Vermont senator's enthusiastic supporters clearly made her ground game a wash. Next up is New Hampshire, which is even friendlier territory for Sanders - right now, he enjoys a double-digit lead there. Even though the map starts looking more favorable to Clinton after next week, she will likely want to make a race of it with Sanders in New Hampshire to avoid the narrative that her candidacy is imploding.

The problem is that Bernie doesn't have a ramp after NH.  Clinton has 30 or so point leads in all the states coming up after NH.  Maybe he cuts that in half, Iowa has a history of giving candidates false hope.

Remember, ""uncommitted"" beat Jimmy Carter in '76 in Iowa.  Santorum, Huckabee, Dole, Harkin, Gephardt, and ""uncommitted"" (2x) have all gotten false hope in Iowa. ",2016-02-02 21:28:07+00:00,czlh0k4,1.0,t3_43w7my,2364.0,politics

Thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of flies on my ceiling.  1800 square feet of flies, lethargic, clung to the ceilings.  Found out later that a sewer line behind us broke but the smell was from the sewage covered flies.  I literally sucked them up with a shop vac all throughout the house and caught the last couple hundred or so with fly tape.

In our race threads, it is rarely 20 laps into a race before the first person declares the race ""boring"".  By the end of the race, there are often full-blown circle-jerks on how boring the race is.

Let me take you back to Sept. 28, 1980.  Martinsville.  Dale won the race.  Three cars were on the lead lap at the end.  10th place was 16 laps down.  Only 15 cars were in the race at the end, the other 16 dropped out.  There were a total of 8 cars on the track at the end with another competitor on the same lap as they were.  (3 on lead lap, 3 one lap down, and 2 four laps down.)  Nobody else was racing for position.

Imagine that race thread.

I give NASCAR credit for trying.  They are largely in a no-win situation.  Fans today would never tolerate the racing of old, but if you turn cars loose and let them race for 500 laps, km, or miles it just isn't going to be non-stop side-by-side racing.

Conversely, when the market is up you should beat the markets.  Don't panic, you job is to look at what the markets look like in 40 years, not next month.

3956,"I never paid a journal to have my papers published, so I am missing the point you are making by saying the researchers have already paid the journals.  Maybe some journals charge the author for publications in fields other than my own.

The larger point, I think, is that arguing about the cost is irrelevant to whether or not you have the right to take intellectual property for free.  If I choose to charge you 5X what you think my patents are worth for licensing rights, it does not give you the authority to steal my IP because you think the price is too high.

Finally, authors have the ability to publish their papers for free on the web if they choose.  They generally don't choose that for papers of any quality because the peer-reviewed publication process lends significant credibility to their papers.  I can write a paper on global climate change and put it on the web, but I can't write a paper on that subject and have it published in a respectable journal because I don't have the credentials in that subject.

Imagine a world where every consumer of information on global climate change or medicine had to wade through scores of papers published freely to get one quality paper that had the proper credentials.  Eliminating the journal process, as appealing as it sounds in a lot of ways, could actually be a conduit to furthering junk science and actually become a barrier to moving forward important fields like physics, climate science, and medicine.

People do not have the right to enter a private function on private property and start protesting.  Nobody is talking about taking away the right to protest, or quelling debate.  Protest outside the event, on public property, according to the law is good and healthy.  There is no lack of debate, in the Republican side particularly.

We must have read different top level comments, because I see examples where people stipulate that it is an ethical argument yet point out that the linked argument by the biologist is deeply flawed because it only looks at the cellular level.

Clearly there is an ethical question of when life begins.  It is the central question.  Science cannot answer that, but science can provide the required data.  When does brain matter develop, when does a heart beat, when is there brain activity, when is there self awareness, when is the fetus viable outside the womb...all scientific data that feeds into the ethical debate.

Removing somebody from life support is an ethical decision, but it must be made with scientific input.  The same goes for abortion.

I must taste the wine by slurping it through my teeth, looking like a fool because only somebody who truly knows how to properly taste wine would look this foolish doing it, slurp it just right making noises that my mother taught me were rude, and I magically get all the beautiful flavor out of the wine.  Every individual taste is brought to life and enjoyed.

And then I set my wine glass down, let them fill it the rest of the way, and drink the rest like a normal person.

Oh, and only one person at the dinner table gets to experience these great flavors, nobody else shall slurp their wine through their teeth.

Just drink the fucking wine you twat.

If a President is going to get America into a war it should be only with the following conditions:

- The US or a key ally faces an imminent threat of invasion and/or large casualties from an enemy force, or has already been invaded or attacked.
- The congress makes a declaration of war against an entity, not an idea.  Al Qaeda or ISIL qualifies, ""terror"" does not.
- The President is willing to conduct an all-out war against the enemy, using overwhelming force and the full power of the US military.
- The US and its allies are committed to occupying and setting up a provisional government until such time that the government can stand on its own.

This hasn't been the case for roughly seven decades with far too much money spent and lives lost because we have the ability to launch half-asses wars, often leaving the people in our country and the country we fight worse off.

So, for those reasons, Obama would be wrong to ask for a formal declaration or war while saying we won't use ground troops and congress would be wrong to declare war without the President saying he/she will conduct a proper war.  ",2015-12-14 20:54:36+00:00,cxz1wru,3.0,t1_cxyznib,3544.0,politics

Let's take this to the extreme.  Let's say there were no H1-B's allowed at all.  One of four things would happen:

- Your company would fail due to the inability to execute properly because you don't have the correct resources in place.
- Your company would off-shore the talent, which has a significant cost of it's own for things like engineering, software, etc.
- Your company would begin a program to develop talent to fill the roles so the individual and the company can prosper.
- Your company would raise the salaries to a level where they pull from their competitors, making the field highly attractive and causing US citizens to enter the field because of the higher wages.

4359,"""No evidence of racism"".

This is just ridiculous.  There is no clear set of actions, words, or thoughts that are defined as racist.  Racism is solely in the eye of the receiver.  Let's say I make a statement.  10 people hear that statement and could have very differing takes.  Their perceptions could range from ""Not racist at all"" to the most racist thing they heard all year.  And that's okay.  

What isn't okay is for a person, or group of people, to try to define something as racist (or not racist) simply because they perceive it as such, and that is what is happening.  An investigation into whether or not there was racism is the epitome of this strange belief that there is a hard and fast set of rules that determine whether or not something is racist, and that hard and fast set of rules is determined by who, exactly?

This is the equivalent as the people who tried to determine what pornography should and shouldn't be considered obscene, and therefore illegal, in the 70's.  No surprise, the ones arguing for things to be declared obscene felt they were the best judges and were arguing for nearly everything that hinted at sexuality to be declared obscene.

As a result, the wages for the Americans are artificially lowered because the foreign workers are still making more than they would in their countries of origin.
The net result would be a huge increase in pay for H-1B workers whose skillsets are not able to be achieved in the US. It would also be a win for Americans working in skilled positions.
I would love it if Cruz coupled this with a plan to give tax deductions to corporations who spent money to develop talent from disadvantaged groups. For instance, let's say IBM imports many people from India on H-1B visas because they need talented people to write software. IBM decides to set up a plan that pays for people from disadvantaged US high schools to go to school in the computer science field. Since IBM is actively working to solve the issue of a lack of skilled resources within the US by growing talent from within our borders, they would get tax breaks and possibly even a deduction on the minimum wage for 4 years.

4588,"Comparing the two is ridiculous.

1 in 20 will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer.  The average age of diagnosis is age 72.  If regularly screened, the survival rate is greater than 50%.

That works out to about a 2.5% chance of dying of colorectal cancer if you eat processed meat never or occasionally and get regularly screened when you are over 50.  You have approximately a 3% chance of dying of colorectal cancer if you eat processed meat every day and get regularly screened over 50.  In either case, you will likely be 70 or older when you die of this cancer.

Those statistics ignore the much more likely outcome of a heart disease death.

4604,"Thanks.  I like that you actually provided statistics.  /u/LEGITIMATE_SOURCE (ironic username) didn't take me up on my offer.

Your first source says that 1 in 20 people will develop colorectal cancer.

[This](http://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/colorectal-cancer/risk-factors-and-prevention) source says that the average age of diagnosis is 72 years old.

[This](http://www.cancer.org/cancer/colonandrectumcancer/detailedguide/colorectal-cancer-survival-rates) shows the survival rates, which are quite high if the cancer is diagnosed early.

So, what I would like the media to do is give the public usable information.  The general population has a 5% chance of getting colorectal cancer.  If you eat 50g of processed meat per day, that number goes up to 6% (18% increase according to the WHO).  Your average age of diagnosis is 72yo and, if you are regularly screened, chances are very high (looks like greater than 75% by a nonweighted average, the WHO doesn't give that number) that you will survive the cancer.

If the media gave those statistics, this ""story"" would be a snoozer.  Not quite as sensationalized as ""MEAT CAUSES CANCER!!!! More after the break.""

4729,"First, assume your professor is correct. A buildup of static electricity just brings the vehicle to a higher potential. That is no risk to the fuel, you could bring the vehicle to 50,000 volts as long as there is no discharge. For instance, high voltage power lines are sometimes maintained by helicopter. A worker sits on a platform and brings the entire helicopter up to the voltage of the wire. Then he can work on the wire as he, the helicopter, and the fuel is at the same high voltage as the wire. No path to ground.

But your professor is wrong, or at least his simplifying assumption is incorrect. He assumes the only connection to ground is the insulating tires. You've seen races though, the cars bottom out, discharging the static electricity. Crews touch the car and ground during pit stops, discharging to ground through their bodies. 

Another incorrect, or incomplete assumption is the constant capacitor capacity. If I accept that the ground and car are capacitor plates, the capacitor capacity continuously changes, by a lot, as the suspension articulates. 

Finally, even if his assumptions are true, there needs to be a significant spark in the area of the fuel filler to get a fire.",2015-10-15 01:06:04+00:00,cw04r6a,1.0,t3_3orupq,14173.0,NASCAR

4749,"If you don't think it is a concern that a late model car can drive up on top of another late model car, then you are pretty typical short track guy.  I love short track racing.  I try to go in as many different regions as possible.  I've been in California, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Ohio, Texas, Florida, and Virginia.  I wish I went to more.  I wish I could have gone to Rockford speedway when I visited my buddy in Byron, but it didn't work out.  One thing that is consistent at short tracks across the country is that they are slow to act on safety and they fail to recognize (or at least acknowledge) vulnerabilities.

Since 1990, 53% of all racing deaths happened at short tracks.  The number has jumped to 70% over the last three years.  Think of the speeds involved at short tracks vs. larger tracks.  Why are 70% of the deaths happening there?  It didn't used to be that way.

Randy LaJoie will tell you that as he travels to get the message of safety out to the folks at short tracks, they are like you.  They don't want to hear it.  “I’ve almost gotten into fights telling people they’re not safe.”

So, I don't really care if you have built a single Formula Ford or 100 late models.  If you can't see a vulnerability here that could be addressed then I can't help out.

Read below.  Compare the professors statements on the immediate reactions of the students.  Then pay attention to how the students acclimated and excelled.  After reading, go back and read the comments in this thread, if you will, and you will find a parallel.

&gt; Most students hated it at first, Dr. Pennebaker said.

&gt;“Sam and I usually get really high course evaluations” from the students, he said; “these were the lowest ever.”

&gt;Dr. Gosling offered one explanation. “For the first few weeks, every time their friends went out drinking, they couldn’t go; they had yet another test the next day.” Their co-author was Jason D. Ferrell, also at Texas.

&gt;By the end of the course, however, the class had outperformed a previous Psych 301 class of 935 students that used midterm exams — scoring 10 percent higher on a subset of 17 questions that appeared on both classes’ tests. The quizzed group also got slightly higher grades, the study found.

&gt;The grade improvements were sharpest among students from lower-income backgrounds — those from poor-quality schools “who were always smartest in class,” Dr. Gosling said.

&gt;“Then they get here and, when they fail the first midterm, they think it’s a fluke,” he went on. “By the time they’ve failed the second one, it’s too late. The hole’s too deep. The quizzes make it impossible to maintain that state of denial.”

&gt; By forcing the students to stay current in the reading and pay attention in class, the quizzes also taught them a fundamental lesson about how to study, the authors said.

&gt;They also cut down on another kind of denial — that most hallowed of college traditions, cutting class.

&gt;In the middle of the semester, attendance usually averages about 60 percent, Dr. Pennebaker said, adding: “In this quiz class it was 90 percent. If you know you’ve got a quiz, you have to show up.”

I basically took it one step further, which some recommend, where there isn't a large comprehensive mid-term or final and the tests would just be frequent, shorter, and more fundamental.  Students bitched at first, as they like to do, but then loved it by the end.  When they were cramming for mid-terms and finals in other classes, my class was light.

4898,"Well, first let me say that a responsible executive would fund studies and listen to experts rather than spouting out some stupid ""assault"" weapons ban that, even if they collected every assault weapon, would not cause a noticeable blip in the murder rate.

But, since I can't fund studies and only have statistics, let me have a go.

- more people are killed in Chicago alone (the President's adopted home town) by illegal handguns every year than by assault rifles in the entire US. Many of those are gang related murders which kill innocent non gang members. These gangs are funding themselves largely through the sale of narcotics. Yet the administration pretends that the prison is filled with nonviolent drug offenders. Many of these nonviolent offenders are people caught selling, transporting, or distributing drugs. There is nothing nonviolent about that. People who engage in the drug trade are voluntarily participating in the most violent industry in America and taking part in the murders that are a part of the business. Murders that establish market, protect product, and settle debt. This is one root cause, there are many possible solutions, but pretending that people who participate in this trade are nonviolent is outrageous.
- Domestic violence. More people are killed via domestic violence than all school shootings combined.  Never hear politicians on either side of the aisle talk about this. Every repeat victim and perpetrator of domestic violence should be required, compelled to seek mental health treatment. Then fund it.
- Aggressively enforce laws on the books. New laws are silly if the current laws are not enforced. I am generally against mandatory minimums, but anybody caught with an illegal firearm needs to be aggressively prosecuted and incarcerated. If mandatory minimums are part of that, so be it. I prefer a different approach but something must be done.
- Require licenses to own a firearm. For everybody. Force all gun transactions to provide a record and license check. All gun ranges check licenses prior to allowing people to shoot there.
- Allow police to use all resources to prevent gun crime. We have allowed the race baiters to prevent police from intervening when it makes sense. Police should profile based on the area of the city, the makeup of a group, age, dress, and yes, race.

4909,"I enjoyed reading and digesting your take on the Second Amendment.  My first response is that I am not sure that any of your interpretations are within the current interpretation of the SCOTUS.

Arms - I'll start with that.  Even within your example, there are arms that are allowed and those that aren't.  So the right to keep arms, independent of everything else, was infringed the moment that any restriction was placed on it.

Militia - The SCOTUS has ruled that the phrase ""the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed"" stands on it's own.  I know the militia argument is used quite often, but it has been used in front of the court and rejected.

""bearing"" of arms.  Interesting take.  I think the legal interpretation was different than to literally ""carry"".  I like the out-of-the box thinking though.  Again though, based on your examples, there are arms (based on your definition) that can be carried that are outlawed.  So even if I apply your definition of ""...the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed"" then my point still stands.  SCOTUS has said, ""Yeah, we get it, but we are going to infringe anyway because we have to.""

4925,"&gt; That sullied amendment is the United States constitution’s Second Amendment which states, “A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” The gun industry and its supporters have turned that simple statement into a clever marketing tool, and Americans are paying the price in blood.

I was foolishly looking for a constitutional law argument as to how we pervert the second amendment.  I was disappointed.  The guardian makes the claim, but there is no meat to back it up.

Short of a constitutional law debate, let's look at the history of the Second Amendment.  At our country's birth, any citizen was allowed to have weaponry of the same technology and destruction level as our U.S. military.  Guns, swords, cannons, even a warship if one desired were fair game.  The people literally had the ability to amass the firepower to band together and defeat the US military on the battle field.

We can debate whether or not that was a good idea then, but I think that most people would agree it isn't a good idea now.  Imagine George Soros or the Koch brothers with an [AC-130 gunship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVXBHNvpTcg) and a couple of [B-52 bombers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm5kv9PH4xA) loaded with bombs.  Probably not a good idea, and those are antiquated platforms compared to some other platforms the government has at the ready.

So, somewhere along the way, the Supreme Court has said that, while they agree that the right to keep and bear arms should not be ~~abridged~~ infringed applied to private citizens instead of just organized militias...they would go ahead and ~~abridge~~ infringe on that right anyway.  They diluted the Second Amendment while agreeing with it.

So here we are now.  The Supreme Court says I have a fundamental right to keep and bear arms but the ~~abridge~~ infringe part is kinda wishy-washy because of technology.  What's that mean?

Well, to me it means that we can't solve the gun violence issue without first taking a step to re-write the Second Amendment based on the current technology.  Otherwise we stay in this limbo.  We can take away weapons from some but not all.  We can ban these weapons but not those.  We can't totally ban guns, because that's settled law.  There are two truths here.  First, the article is wrong.  We have perverted the Second Amendment, but in the opposite way the guardian suggests.  Second, the SCOTUS has left us in a place where, even if there was political will to pass a law, we honestly have no idea what laws we can pass without the current SCOTUS or future SCOTUS slapping them down.

If you truly want change, stop talking about silly ""assault weapons"" bans or magazine size limits.  Statistically even if they are 100% effective in their efforts the effect on the gun violence rounds to zero.  Instead, push to re-write an amendment.  Codify gun ownership right (or lack or a right) in an amendment that is consistent with today's technology.

Denying global climate change, defunding Planned Parenthood, lowering taxes, increasing defense spending, speaking out against engagement with Muslim nations.  You know, Republican issues.

Here's what you do:

- Send her a text that you really didn't like how she smelled, in fact you thought it was somewhat foul
- If that doesn't work, send her three pictures: One with you crying, a body shot in underwear, and an extreme closeup of your penis
- If you still haven't scored, remind her of the book.  Since you are on somewhat strained terms, rent a cheap motel room by the hour and ask her to meet you there with the book in hand.  She will feel more comfortable meeting in neutral territory.
- Finally, file a claim in small claims court.  She will have to talk to her then.  Make sure you delete the pictures from your texts so she doesn't have proof, just in case she brings it up to the judge.

Are they suggesting that the bottom 20% should get a $184,000 tax break, or that the amount of tax paid by the bottom 20% is the max dollar amount tax break for any single group?",2015-09-28 19:42:47+00:00,cvh8fos,1.0,t3_3mqk3r,985.0,politics

Sure, no problem.  Maybe academia, the government, charities, and investors could all have a go at it.  Remove or hamper any one and you slow the treatments coming to market.

Additionally, if the demagogues threaten to remove the profit incentive then the treatments researched at academia and government funded labs would sit largely idle.  You got a lead on a cure? Great.  Can I make money on it?  Nope?  Then I am not risking my capital.

That's all true, and worth fighting against.

It doesn't have to be fought as though you are a militant.  It can, and should be, fought in a respectful way.

There are two issues, statistical accuracy (which relates to sample size) and knowledge metric (which relates to the number and quality of questions).  You point to statistical accuracy, but it is certainly possible to have a poor knowledge metric that doesn't accurately measure somebody's knowledge on a subject but do so in a way that is very accurate statistically.

countries?

The study also considered The Daily Show as a news source.  5.33 times as many Democrats or ""lean Dem"" got their news from The Daily Show as Republicans/""lean Rep"".

For each the four the international questions, Republicans answered the questions correctly more often than Democrats.

For the domestic questions, again Republicans answered each question correctly in greater numbers.

For those who say they lean democrat or lean republican, the results were split.  Right leaners answered 5 questions correctly in greater numbers and left leaners answered 3 questions correctly in greater numbers.  One was a tie.

In the end, I disagree with the cause and effect here.  I don't believe that one can tell conclusively that watching Fox News makes you less informed.

5412,"Fellow Houston transplant here.  I have lived in eight different states, so I at least have some comparisons.  My perspective, sorry to the natives:

- The Houston Ballet is great.  World class and not enough of the locals know about it.
- The dining isn't better than other cities I have lived in.  In fact, I think Houston's dining is pretty mediocre.
- The architecture is essentially non-existent compared to other cities.
- Landscape, well, see above.
- The Chinatown is nice, even it is funny looking
- The egos and tempers on the highway are worse than anywhere I have lived.
- I find the jingoistic attitude that ""Texas is the best place ever"" somewhat bizarre because most of the people who espouse that attitude have spent very little time out of the state.
- The diversity is wonderful.  I work with people from around the world, and I love that.

So there it is.  I am here because of a great job.  But I honestly can't think of a worse state to live in.  If one has to live in Texas though, Houston does seem like a fairly good choice due to the diversity.  ",2015-09-17 20:47:35+00:00,cv542wa,1.0,t3_3lccfs,2994.0,houston

We were in the Midtown area of Houston, TX tonight and tried to go into The Gaslamp. Both Dan and Ken had on blazers. I had on a button up and slacks. When we walked up the guy at the door told us $20 each (pictured below in the long sleeve shirt). We didn't want to pay that amount so we decided to go to the next bar down, The Dogwood, which was free.

5654,"&gt;In a 1991 paper, ""The Myth of the Ford Pinto Case"", for the Rutgers Law Review, Gary Schwartz[5] said the case against the Pinto was not clear-cut.[25][26]

&gt;According to his study, the number who died in Pinto rear-impact fires was well below the hundreds cited in contemporary news reports and closer to the 27 recorded by a limited National Highway Traffic Safety Administration database. Given the Pinto's production figures (over 3 million built), this was not substantially worse than typical for the time. Schwartz said that the car was no more fire-prone than other cars of the time, that its fatality rates were lower than comparably sized imported automobiles, and that the supposed ""smoking gun"" document that plaintiffs said demonstrated Ford's callousness in designing the Pinto was actually a document based on National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regulations about the value of a human life — rather than a document containing an assessment of Ford's potential tort liability.

&gt;Schwartz's study said:

&gt;The Pinto Memo wasn't used or consulted internally by Ford, but rather was attached to a letter written to NHTSA about proposed regulation. When plaintiffs tried to use the memo in support of punitive damages, the trial judge ruled it inadmissible for that purpose (p. 1021, Schwartz study).

&gt;The Pinto's fuel tank location behind the axle, ostensibly its design defect, was ""commonplace at the time in American cars"" (p. 1027).

&gt;The precedent of the California Supreme Court at the time not only tolerated manufacturers trading off safety for cost, but apparently encouraged manufacturers to consider such trade-offs (p. 1037).",2015-09-11 18:37:02+00:00,cuy74os,1.0,t3_3kkaap,5770.0,todayilearned

5656,"There are several things you could do.

First, you could make up a reason to go to the doctor.  Your arm hurts.  You are pooping some blood. It hurts a little when you pee.  Or you just need a checkup.  You want a reason strong enough for your parents to take you, but not enough to cause panic.

Another thing you could do is find a Planned Parenthood.  Go in for a std test, even if you know you don't have an std.  Then ask to talk to a doctor, not a nurse.  These people deal with reproductive issues all day and will help you.  PP isn't just for women.

A third source would be a lgbt clinic.  Same thing.  Ask to talk to a doctor.  You don't have to be gay or bi to use these clinics.  Just go.

""Political experience"" is a funny requirement though.  What does that mean?

Taking it a step further, would a military general (an executive post) be more qualified than a house member?  Both involve politics, since politics permeates everything, but one actually has people working for him/her, controls a budget, and uses executive powers.

What about a CEO?  Politics are alive and well in every company, from directors to VPs to CEOs and board members.  Nobody works up through the ranks without understanding how to be politically savvy.  A CEO has a job description similar to a president's in many ways, at least it is more similar to the president than, say, a senator's job description.

5832,"&gt; The sanctions were pretty much the maximum amount of pressure that was realistically available

Evidence?

&gt; evidenced by the fact that A. they brought Iran to the table in the first place

A nice talking point if one is worried about legacy, but the sanctions did not slow down Iran at all.  The sanctions didn't bring Iran to the table, getting their nuclear weapons program to a point where the US and the world had no choice but to accept terms brought Iran to the table.

Maybe another analogy might get you to think outside of the talking points fed to us.  Let's say I am the majority shareholder of a business and I have an exit strategy of a buyout by a larger business.  The larger business is courting me, but I know that I have a very large contract with a high likelihood of landing.  I can negotiate my sale now, or I can wait until the contract is announced.  What do I do?

Now, once the contract is announced I sit down at the negotiating table and negotiate from a position of strength.  I will obviously command more money.  If I am a skilled negotiator, I give the opposing executive some red meat to take back to his/her superiors which allows him/her to position the acquisition as a win for the acquiring company and it was the years of pressure that finally brought me to the table.

5906,"&gt; But I thought about it more, we should not be celebrating. What is essentially a basic human right, took us over several decades to achieve. By force.

Not totally.  It did take decades, clearly.  The final blow was a Supreme Court ruling, to be sure, but public opinion had largely changed before that.  In my opinion, public opinion lead the Supreme Court and public opinion changed because small changes took place in the media.  Very public, loved people came out of the closet.  Joe and Jill Smith in Iowa started to realize that maybe it was okay for them to like Ellen even though she is a lesbian.  High profile people coming out inspired John Q Public to come out and pretty soon people knew openly gay men and women who were their neighbors, their co-workers, their friends.  These people, in turn, educated middle America and that is what changed their minds.

My sister has three close friends who are lesbians.  My parents love my sister's friends.  Until my sister had these friends my parents had never been exposed to openly gay women.  It wasn't that my parents ""hated"" gays prior to that, but this gentle education that ""we are just like you"" made them realize ""Who cares who he/she loves?""  Small educations like this took place everywhere.  Big cities, small towns, in every state.  These are the educations, in my opinion, that changed public opinion.

Now, if you asked my parents three decades ago if they supported gay marriage, they would have probably said no.  Now they do.  If the gay community did nothing but beat a hammer and vilify people like my parents they wouldn't have been open to the gentle educations.  Millions of Americans who have changed their tune due to their gentle educations and I doubt they would have gone from anti-gay marriage to pro gay-marriage if they received hate instead of love.  It was a war, but it was a war of love, familiarity, and education as much as anything.

When the economy crashed, the bank lost more than $1 billion worth of Florida taxpayer money and retirement funds.

6104,"&gt;  I believe those theories are mutually exclusive to a finding of Tony's liability.

I definitely get that.  I don't think Tony's suit (in my head) would be based on that.

Tony suffered real damages from the incident on the track.  If I were his fictional lawyer in this fictional case, I would argue that Kevin Ward was solely responsible for the incident on-track.  That incident injured Tony in the following ways:

* Emotional pain and suffering.  Ward's family can't sue for this, Tony can because he is still living.  Seems easy to establish that Tony suffered emotionally from this ordeal.
* Lost revenue.  If Tony lost any sponsor dollars because he wasn't in his car, he suffered damages because of the Ward incident.
* Expenses.  Tony and Stewart-Haas racing had to fit a car for a replacement driver and pay the replacement driver.
* Damage to Tony's brand.  This could be huge.  Establish how this hurt your merchandise sales, sponsor opportunities, etc.

I think Tony suffered real financial damage because of this that is separate from wrongful prosecution, slander, or defamation.  I hadn't even considered those three.  However, the latter two could still be recovered, it seems to me, in some scenarios.  If the family says Tony purposely killed their son and the jury finds that Tony didn't try to kill their son, but was negligent for not seeing their son, then the slander and defamation would still be on the table for consideration, right?  Just an example, but I think there are scenarios where they find Tony partially liable but still find the family slandered or defamed Tony in other ways.

Let's say a jury finds the plaintiff and defendant each 50% at fault, but the defendant has more damages.  Now step outside the law and into marketing or PR.

6126,"&gt; you do have the right to break your lease if they entered your premises without 24 hours notice.

Be careful of the legal advice you are giving.  Different states have different laws.  The standard boilerplate lease language, published by my state of residence, states that the landlord, or the landlord's agent, has the right to enter the house at any time.  There are no qualifiers and if you sign the lease without red-lining that clause then anybody the landlord designates as an agent can just waltz right in.

I am a landlord in a state other than my residence.  I am only required to make a ""reasonable attempt"" to notify.  I can call in the morning and say I am coming by in the afternoon.  If I owned apartments, reasonable attempt could be a flyer located in a commons area bulletin board saying a contractor will be coming by on a certain date, or range of dates.

Edit:  For those who didn't really read my post, in Texas a landlord can enter the house without giving the tenant private notice for any of the reasons below.  In addition, there is no specific 24 hour notice for anything so, in a lease, if you grant permission for the landlord to enter any time without notice they can.  In addition, unless you specifically state that notice is required you are essentially unprotected.  Only 38 states have any kind of privacy clause with respect to tenants.  Which brings me back to my original point, it was incorrect to give blanket advice that one can break a lease if 24 hour notice wasn't provided.

Longer than I care to admit.  I'm rather old for reddit.

&gt; Engineering works by figuring out how to solve a specific set of problems. Leadership is responsible for defining said problems.

You are learning.  The notion that you have to figure out the details first is ridiculous. ",2015-08-24 20:13:50+00:00,cue9r8m,9.0,t1_cue9kum,269.0,INDYCAR
6186,"&gt; Mandating something before there's an adequate solution often results in shoddy and ill-considered engineering.

That's actually the opposite of how leadership and engineering works. 

* The mandate to make cheap silicone transistors came prior to Gordon Teal actually figuring out how to make cheap, repeatable silicone transistors.  
* We didn't figure out the details of how we would go to the moon before we mandated it.  
* Kelley Johnson had no details on how he would build the U-2, SR-71, or C-140 before he had the mandate to engineer them.
* As a different example, NASCAR didn't know how to make a safer car after Dale Sr. died.  They mandated it and turned it over to their R&amp;D department.

Engineering doesn't work by figuring out how to do something and then figuring out if it is needed.  It works by creating requirements and then figuring out how to solve the problem.  Leadership is deciding which way you are going to go without the details on how you get there.  

&gt; If you just go say ""next race we need closed canopies"" willy-nilly

That's an example of poor leadership.  If we say to our engineering leaders, ""How long will it take to get a viable solution?  You believe we can have one by 2018?  Great.""  Press release, ""We will have a solution by 2018.""  Then you fund it.",2015-08-24 19:56:33+00:00,cue92om,7.0,t1_cue84b6,1402.0,INDYCAR

This was not only a practical gesture, but a symbolic one as well, demonstrating to the world that America was serious about conserving energy, and that conservation does, indeed, begin at home. Alas, Ronald Reagan believed solar panels made the United States look pathetic and needy, and had them removed.

The panels were removed in 1986 when work was being done on the roof of the White House.  There is really nothing of substance here, both moves were mostly symbolic.

If you want to discuss something of substance, the Solar Energy Research Institute (SERI) in Golden, CO started in 1977 and Carter kicked off researching solar energy as a viable option for reducing our addiction on fossil fuels.  Reagan cut the budget by 90%.

SERI went on to become a national lab, is now the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) and has been a huge player in bringing solar energy to a point where it is economically viable.  NREL also has teams working on wind energy, fuel cells, batteries, and other things.  It also has a warm water cooled supercomputer to aid in the research, and it heats the building from the waste heat of the supercomputer - even in the cold Colorado winters.

I don't understand why the White House solar panels, that only heated water, get so much attention when there is something of substance that is so much more important.",2015-08-13 19:48:03+00:00,cu1y8lc,1.0,t3_3gvvw6,1359.0,todayilearned

I am not advocating corporate welfare over education dollars or food stamps.  I am exactly advocating that both sides put away their rhetoric and make decisions based on sound economic fundamentals.

I am a state and I find that I have $1 to spend and three choices between tax breaks for a plant to be built and bring jobs back from overseas, spend it on my state land grant university, or I give it in the form of a sales tax voucher for people making less than $40k per year.  The first two options offer vital long term economic health for the state.  The latter provides short term, one time stimulus.  

What do I need at the moment?  If the answer is longer term I look at one of the first two options.

Now, let's assume education provides the better quantifiable ROI.  Now I have to look at where my education system is at compared to where I want it to be.  Do I already have a high achieving education system but many graduates under-earn or move from the area because there are not enough jobs?  I spend my dollar on choice number one.  It might not be the highest quantifiable ROI but it would provide much needed jobs which will also help to reduce crime and increase education.

For decades the NTSB and congress have increased regulations on truck drivers, decreased their speeds relative to cars, and increased their fines. Meanwhile there have been only token efforts at educating drivers of cars and enforcing traffic laws with respect to truck/car interaction. They are trying to attack the 16% while ignoring the 70%.

Some years ago Spokane, WA had a decoy truck. The driver would drive the freeway with a state trooper in the passenger seat. When people would cut the driver off or otherwise violate the traffic laws around the trucks the trooper would call into waiting officers and the car driver would receive a ticket.

6536,"Temperature has nothing to do with quality.

Subcritical, critical, and supercritical with respect to nuclear power plants means power decreasing, power stable, and power increasing respectively.  I think you mean you ran superheated.

Lower quality does mean more moisture, but saturated steam and superheated steam both have exactly 0% moisture.

Nuclear power plants tend to be saturated because of safety, not because there is something special about fire.

Whether you are using superheated steam or saturated steam, I would imagine that your turbine, at least in the low pressure region, ends up with low pressure saturated steam.  Running superheated steam into the condenser seems silly and would kill the Carnot efficiency, unless I am missing something.

Well, this is fundamentally incorrect.  There isn't a stream power plant that operates at less than saturated conditions, at least as far as I know. A saturated stream plant isn't a lower quality stream than a superheated stream plant. It is lower pressure and has unique challenges, but it isn't lower quality.

Because of the shape of the water p-h dome, pressure drop will cause an adiabatic drop in quality for saturated stream plants, but that is dealt with using condensate traps, keeping the stream right on the edge of the dome. ",2015-08-07 08:19:39+00:00,ctull47,7.0,t1_ctua3gs,26542.0,askscience

6564,"Although I understand the point you are trying to make, let me just say that the passionate ""rape is rape"" cry actually hurts the cause of the victim.

There are multiple types of rape and different magnitudes.  While it might be satisfying to try to lump them all into one bucket, I don't believe it is wise.

From the victim's perspective, the emotional and mental treatment for rape should be different depending on the circumstances.  It wouldn't make sense to treat a 13 year old boy who was raped by his 30 year old female teacher the same way you would treat a 19 year old woman who was violently beaten and repeatedly raped by a serial rapist she didn't know.  Likewise, the date rape of a young college co-ed by her boyfriend should be treated different from the violent rape above.  Finally, the ""I was too drunk to legally consent even though I said yes that night"" should be treated different from all other rapes.

From the rapist's perspective there are multiple reasons why people rape.  Some people are essentially incapable of going through life without rape. It is about the power.  For other people, there has to be something that goes along with it.  Strangulation, blood, physical violence, etc. or that person cannot ""enjoy"" their rape.  Still others simply make a poor decision after too much to drink, or young men over the age of consent fall in ""love"" with young ladies below it.  All of these should have different treatments.  All should have different punishments.  Some people are not at high risk of re-offending while others almost certainly aren't.

So, tl;dr, rape is rape, but not all rapes are equal from either the victim or the rapist's perspective.",2015-08-06 15:17:57+00:00,cttmpqk,6.0,t1_cttmaol,631.0,AdviceAnimals

6678,"I don't know how misleading the headline is, but let me use a sports analogy.

It is pretty well accepted by baseball historians that if the Jackie Robinson experiment hadn't worked out, it would be a long time before another player could have been brought up from the negro leagues.  Jackie was selected because of his talent in the game, his demeanor, and his activities off the field.  He was the first and if more were to follow he needed to be highly successful in all facets.  

Geraldine Ferraro was exactly right that Obama was selected partially because of his race.  He wasn't the first black man to run, of course.  He wasn't the most experienced black man.  He was the first black man who ran that had a chance at appealing to most of white America.  If he fell on his face, it would be a long time before another black man was elected president.  It's not something that most Americans would admit to, but there is an almost subconscious race element in American politics that spans both parties.

Now, if you believe that Obama was a horrendous failure, it wouldn't be a stretch to say that it would be a long time before another black man was president.

Ferraro was demonized for speaking openly and honestly about race.  Most Americans don't want people who are willing to have a completely honest dialog about race.  I don't know if Trump is right or wrong, but I will say that the point has validity but most people are too dishonest about race to admit it.",2015-08-03 00:26:30+00:00,ctpdw43,1.0,t3_3fjzfo,6119.0,politics

6718,"There is hypocrisy all around on this.  One one side, the proponents of illegal immigration (or open borders) like to say that illegal immigrants only take the jobs that Americans won't do, they pay taxes, they create other jobs by working and spending money in the community, and their overall net value is positive.  Yet somehow, if Trump uses the guest worker program to legally bring people into the country to do those same jobs that Americans won't do he is taking jobs away from Americans.  I don't get it.  Given the two choices, I prefer that the people are brought in legally.  Trump wins.

On the right, people say that the illegals are taking the jobs that Americans won't do *for the same price that the illegals are doing those jobs.*  If the illegals were deported and the border secured, the wages for those jobs would increase and Americans would apply for the jobs.  The marketplace would correct itself.  By that argument, it is reasonable to expect Trump to increase wages and give the jobs to America.  The left wins.

The truth lies somewhere in the middle, of course.  The guest worker program is administered through the department of labor and the host company has the burden to show that they cannot hire US citizens to fill the jobs at a reasonable, going wage.  It isn't unreasonable to legally import workers for these types of service industry jobs.  I prefer a business do exactly that over hiring illegals.  Net, net: Trump wins.

tl;dr: There is nothing to see here but a shit show over legal, fair business practices.  Trump himself isn't the hypocrite in this one, but there is plenty of hypocrisy to go around.",2015-08-02 15:56:02+00:00,ctoxpex,1.0,t3_3figz6,3577.0,politics

I tend to agree.  This isn't an attack on breast feeding or pumping breasts.  This was a request to pump breasts in the middle of a deposition without requesting a break.  There is a place and time for everything.  It isn't like there was an infant in immediate need of his/her mother's nourishment.

So...you are saying I am correct.  If the price of the car is already negotiated and I end up paying little to no fees then I am saving money.  My bill of sale shows nominal fees and zero dollar fees where there once was several hundred dollars worth of fees.  I don't care if they juggle the money around internally, I only care what I pay.

I am not there to make money for the salesperson.  I am there to get the best deal possible.  Obviously if I put in an offer of sticker +10%, the salesperson will get more money, as will the dealership.  That's really not my goal.

There are over 1000 triple 7's sold.  It's an immensely popular airplane.  Each 777 holds a lot of passengers, it's Boeing's second biggest aircraft.  We have no idea why this plane went down and probably never will.  Is it an errant line of code?  A faulty mechanical system?  Human causes that could be mitigated with safety features or procedural changes?  An electrical system fault scenario that was overlooked?

If it was any of the above systems, that makes us vulnerable for other incidents.  Since the FAA could have missed something on the 777, the same or similar fault could possibly lie in aircraft that came after.

6862,"As much or more.  I believe the first patent I came across in my research that recognized this was by an aircraft maker named [Harry Ricardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Ricardo).  I can't find the specific patent now, going from memory.

From here I am rambling, sorry:


Here's the basic idea.  There are several efficiencies that are in play when creating power with an internal combustion engine.  Mechanical efficiency deals with the losses from friction.  There is little to be gained here, and gains are essentially across the RPM range.   Thermal efficiency deals with the amount of energy gained from combustion compared to the amount of energy in the fuel burned.   This is dealt with by fuel composition, ignition temperature, and some other things.

The two efficiencies that acoustics play with are combustion efficiency, or basically the mass of fuel burned compared to the mass of the fuel that enters the combustion chamber.  This can be influenced by acoustics because of the ability to use the pressure waves to help remove the old exhaust and keep the fresh fuel/air mixture in the combustion chamber instead of exiting without being consumed.  There are many other ways to deal with this, but the combustion efficiency will change based on the speed of the engine.  This efficiency is pretty high though.

The biggest change is in the volumetric efficiency.  The volumetric efficiency is the ratio of the volume of the air induced, measured at free air conditions, to the swept volume of the cylinder.  This changes drastically across the RPM range and acoustics play a large role in this change.  For an example, a 3.2L four cylinder engine would have a swept volume of 0.8L per cylinder.  If, during the intake stroke, I take in 0.6L of free air, I have a volumetric efficiency of 75%.  I can actually take in more than 0.8L and have a volumetric efficiency greater than one.

Similar to an organ pipe or a coke bottle that you blow across, at certain frequencies there is resonance.  If I design the entire intake and exhaust to have the same resonance frequency I will pack in the most air at that frequency.  If I pack more air into the engine, I create more power.  Beware though, anti-resonances lurk and that's why very peaky engines with a wide frequency range will have very poor performances in some areas.

One decided unsexy but very useful application is diesel generators.  This is a perfect example where you have an engine that runs at only one speed.  You don't care about the power at any other speed, so the torque curve can be tuned for that exact RPM by designing the intake and exhaust perfectly.  In this example, it is relatively easy to hit higher than 100% on the volumetric efficiency and you can sell a smaller, lighter engine with the same power as the competitor's heavy engine.",2015-07-28 14:24:34+00:00,ctizqf8,7.0,t1_ctixly0,3793.0,pics

6864,"Bad is subjective.  A car with a flatter torque curve is easier to drive.  You don't have to ride the peak.  UEL headers could be designed such that one is at its primary resonance while the other is at a harmonic.  This would give a similar shape, but quite the same peak.  If the car has a large enough RPM range you could bring up one peak while damping the primary peak.

I don't know enough about the Subaru specifics to know what their design strategy is.  They could be double peaking, flattening the curve, or just making a cool sound.

I once designed an intake system with two different runner lengths and two different plenum volumes to flatten out the torque curve.  The effect was as intended, the car was easier to drive because I didn't have to ride the peak, but it was also much more boring.",2015-07-28 12:49:32+00:00,ctiwpd6,5.0,t1_ctiuhzg,6418.0,pics
6865,"There is no difference because the end of the pipe will act like an organ.  The sudden expansion will cause a large change in impedance.  If you want a long, flat torque curve, you would space out the lengths and each cylinder would be most efficient at packing in the air at a different RPM.  If you want the most torque at a specific RPM, you make them all the same length and size the length based on where you want the peak torque.",2015-07-28 12:42:43+00:00,ctiwj4v,5.0,t1_ctiutdt,4877.0,pics
6866,"It depends, but probably not. After you reach the collector and change to the head pipe, the length of the head pipe has less of an effect on the frequency of the max volumetric efficiency. If your head pipe and tall pipe were the same length and diameter, and they experienced the same resonant frequency as the individual headers, you might see a slight increase in your torque at the RPM where resonance takes place. At some point, pressure drop takes over and the increased pressure drop negates the effects of the waves being in perfect time.

Don't think in terms of power though, think in terms of torque. In general, shorter headers increase the RPM of max torque and longer headers decrease it. Header length should also take into account the intake acoustics. Not sure the max RPM of a VW, but if you build high revving engine you can tune in two or three peaks.",2015-07-28 07:00:46+00:00,ctiqt6b,5.0,t1_ctiqjq3,858.0,pics
6867,"Oh, something I actually know about. Equal length headers don't necessarily reduced the back pressure, but they ensure that each pipe has the same characteristic impedance. This allows all four cylinders to reach the maximum volumetric efficiency at the same frequency, or RPM. So basically all the cylinders are most efficient at sucking in and rejecting air at the same time, resulting in a higher peak torque, but also a peakier torque curve.

Then, by shortening or lengthening the length of all four headers, you can change the RPM at which the peak torque is achieved.",2015-07-28 06:30:15+00:00,ctiq87z,3.0,t1_ctima66,9295.0,pics

* A building, a POD, or some sort of containment
* Fans.  Could be free air cooling, CRAHs, CRACs, etc.
* Plenums.  Hot aisles, cold aisles, raised floors, whatever.
* Pumps and water systems.  Maybe just a primary loop.  Maybe a primary and secondary.  Many have tertiary loop.  But it most likely has water.
* Coolers.  Dry coolers, adiabatic coolers, chillers, in-row coolers, Kyoto wheels, or a combination of several.
* Racks
* Compute.  Cheap, commodity compute.  Absolutely nothing special here.
* Storage.  I can buy the same storage on Amazon that Amazon uses.
* Networks.  Could be 1, 10, 40 GigE, IB, or any other network.  I can't see IB being used for cloud computing but maybe some make it work.
* Switches.  Commodity item.  I can buy them online.
* Software.  This is the first place where IP comes into play.  I can't buy the same software.  I can buy most of the software in the stack, but not all of it.  I don't even know that Amazon owns this IP, but software isn't difficult to reproduce.

That's essentially it.  There are other pieces, but they are physical pieces that live in real buildings.  I am not sure what you think this mythical cloud is, but it nothing more than rapidly depreciating hardware inside of a building.

They won't disappear, and I never said they would, but they are not a sure thing as OP was inquiring about.

&gt; I've driven a Tesla, he doesn't need to do anything, just keep making cars as good as the Model S.

Good for you, I hope you enjoyed the ride.  Amazing car.  I am bullish on anything that Musk touches.  He is a dreamer though.  He dreams big, succeeds big, and eventually will most likely fail big.  Then he will succeed big again.  If you believe Tesla stock will rise or fall solely on the success of their cars then you are not understanding the business model.  It is entirely possible for him to have a robust car business and still take a huge hit.

In short, I am in love with no company and anybody who believes in a sure thing is a sucker.  Just as much as the people I knew in California gobbling up real estate with interest only loans...it was a sure thing.  There was no way they could lose.",2015-07-20 17:54:17+00:00,ct9x8kn,3.0,t1_ct9vcym,2767.0,investing
7049,"I would enjoy exploring this for just a moment. Apple was essentially the only laptop or desktop manufacturer who chose not to engage in the race to the bottom. Compaq, hp, ibm, Dell, and everybody but Apple chose reducing cost over adding value. It was a strategy that guaranteed failure for all who played, and they all failed. Compaq moved all manufacturing jobs out of Houston, then failed to exist. Dell was almost wiped off the business map. IBM sold to Lenovo, a Chinese company with an inherent advantage at cutting cost. Most smaller players simply disappeared.

The same thing is not happening to the smart phone market. All companies are cost sensitive, to be sure, but all big players are working to add more value than their competitors. As a result, Apple has competition in the smart phone market that they never had in the computer market. Samsung will never approach the phone market with the same death wish that American PC giants had in their demise.",2015-07-20 17:28:55+00:00,ct9w7u4,7.0,t1_ct9namh,14917.0,investing

7065,"&gt; I believe that 3-D printing for the average consumer was a fad

I agree with that statement.

The promise of 3-D printing isn't the ""print whatever part you need in the comfort of your home"" story.  That's a story that is sold to average people that is as likely as an exhibition in the 1974 World's Fair was.

The promise of 3-D printing involves the promise of being able to print something for cheaper than it can be machined, cast, or forged with better mechanical properties.  It's opening up the design space to create designs that were virtually impossible before.  I can create anything in CAD, but I can't manufacture it so I have to make serious design concessions.  A separate promise is printing cells and tissue.

In seriousness, thanks for the great advice, and taking the time to give such detail.  This is where I wish I had a local insurance agent to deal with instead of a large Cleveland based company with a strong web presence.  Then I could just discuss with my agent and let him/her figure it out.

Regarding the deductible, I've always carried a $100 deductible since I was in college where an accident would have wiped me out without a low deductible.  When I moved to Texas, for whatever reason, I had to switch to a silly $99 deductible or a $250 deductible.  It's nice knowing that, in general, an accident will never cost me more than a dinner out but you are correct that it is silly.  I have just never gone back and checked at the price delta now that I can afford a higher deductible.  I will do that, if for no other reason than curiosity.

&gt; ""No. They had an event in 2001 (when seven-time champion Dale Earnhardt Sr. was killed). They've had several events since then. They just don't pay attention to safety. Simple as that.""",2015-07-06 12:59:10+00:00,cstr4z0,1.0,t3_3caq2p,31.0,NASCAR

7221,"&gt; Now to all the people who argued ""This place should only be about NASCAR"" or ""I don't want politics discussed on this sub"". I respect your opinion, but um, your wrong. That's the nicest way I can say it.

With respect to the conversation, I cannot agree more.  NASCAR is more than just about racing.  It's about the personalities, drama, business deals, and even the politics that is NASCAR.  Like it or not, NASCAR has a very racist and exclusionary past and it has spilled over to the present.  NASCAR fans at the races are almost exclusively white.  NASCAR invocation folks are almost exclusively evangelical Christians.  NASCAR drivers, owners, and crew chiefs are almost exclusively white men.  You cannot go to a race anywhere in the country without seeing confederate flag strongly represented.  Despite the strong presence of the lgbt community in /r/nascar, an lgbt driver would face strong harassment from the overall NASCAR fan base.

So, if you are a white straight Christian male you might look at the sport the way it is and declare that politics shouldn't be a part of the discussion.  For the folks who don't fit that mold, and who see NASCAR's past and present, you might see that these things need to be discussed.  No matter what statements are issued by NASCAR, nothing will change unless the sport **and the fans** discuss the lack of diversity and the exclusionary behaviors of NASCAR and its fans.  There needs to be a fundamental shift in fan mentality.

I am proud of the decision by the mods to celebrate the SCOTUS ruling.  It was a banner change, nothing more.  It should not be taken with offense.  I hope the day will come where the rainbow flag is just as acceptable as a confederate flag flying from a motor home in a NASCAR infield.  Actually, I hope the day will come where confederate flags disappear from the infields and parking lots and nobody thinks to fly a rainbow flag because it just isn't an issue anymore whether somebody is gay or straight.

7277,"&gt; Or how about the hypocrisy of Apple claiming to be against slavery while at the same time having their products built by people being treated as slaves?

This is not true, it is a western media fueled witch hunt. I have been to Shenzhen many times, in the Foxconn factories and many of their suppliers. Foxconn is a cheap company, their factories are poorly maintained, but the workers are not treated as slaves. They are free to leave, they get paid overtime, and they get a ninety minute lunch with the lights out so they can nap. It isn't the best company, but many Chinese owned companies are much worse.

I do not work for Apple or Foxconn, I just happen to have first hand experience and have befriended several current and ex Foxconn workers during my visits.

7280,"The fact that there was no lucky dog is the exact reason he had nothing to gain. First, understand that if Harvick gets back on the lead lap, he still passes nobody without a caution. 

If there is lucky dog, Harvick should race to get his lap back. Best case, he races back on the lead lap and restarts after caution at the tail end of the lead lap cars and likely passes two or three. Worst case, he doesn't get his lap back, caution comes out, Harvick has to start tail end of the longest line and passes nobody on the lead lap. With the lucky dog rule in place, Harvick has every reason to try to race his way back on the lead lap, particularly at a road course.

With no lucky dog rule, Harvick has two ways to get back on the lead lap. His first way, race his way back on the lead lap. Remember, they races back to the yellow so if a caution comes out and Robby is pissed at his Robby won't give him the lap back if a caution comes out. The second way is to lay off Robby and, if a caution comes out, Robby pulls over and lets Harvick back on the lead lap. This was common and the spotters could easily work this. In either case, Harvick restarts at the tail end on the lead lap line. In either case, Harvick could pass some lead lap cars after a restart. In the latter case, he starts in the same position with a fresher car and can pass more cars. Worst case in this scenario: he doesn't pass Robby on the race track, caution comes out, Robby doesn't let Harvick back on the lead lap, Harvick restarts at the front end of the lapped down car line.

The fact that there wasn't a lucky dog rule is the exact reason why Harvick *was* making a poor choice.",2015-06-25 20:12:17+00:00,csimkt7,3.0,t1_csiltxb,1127.0,NASCAR
