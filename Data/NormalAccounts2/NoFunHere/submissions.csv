It is my view that we should lower our standards for arrest and prosecution and be predisposed to prosecute those around the terrorist (or mass shooter) for not reporting.  We should not, and constitutionally cannot, lower our standards for guilt but if there is any inkling we should be taking the case to a grand jury at least, preferably a trial.

I am unconcerned about clogging our courts because these events, while tragic, are not frequent and happen across a broad geographical area.

Don't wear skirts = victim blaming.  I don't understand the thinking here.  

If I travel to a country with a high rate of petty theft, I may be advised to keep my wallet in my front pocket.  Don't show large sums of cash.  I even have a stainless steel wedding ring that I use when on business travel to certain areas because I wouldn't mind giving it up.  It is common sense.  Why is advising women to wear pants, don't go out at night alone, etc. any different?

Of course countries should deal with the criminals.  Of course women should be safe no matter what they wear.  Of course I shouldn't *need* a lock on my front door.  But we need to be safe in the world we live in, in the place we are at the moment, not in the world we wish to live in.

Why does it cause such an uproar when a woman is told to do certain things to reduce the chance that they become victims of violent crime?

In the process, they are clogging up traffic worse than the accident itself.  There is also the mad rush that tow trucks make when there is a call for an accident of any kind.  I am sure you have seen them driving like assholes to get to the scene first.

The worst was a minor accident on 249 with two damaged cars on the shoulder.  Tow trucks actually had 2 lanes blocked before the police even responded.

Am I alone, or do you folks see the same issue?  In some states, it is illegal for a tow truck to arrive on the scene of an accident or disabled vehicle unless they are called by the car owner or a law enforcement officer.   [Here](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1222) is a copy of California law.  As somebody who lived in California for six years, the law works out very well.  You break down?  Go ahead and call somebody.  They don't take long to get there, but at least you are going to be able to call somebody from a reputable business.  If there is an accident you are given a choice.  You can call your own or the officer will have one dispatched.  The dispatchers have a rolling list of reputable tow companies, so the companies all get their turn.  Fly be night operators who are not reputable need not apply.

Despite parking on an end spot and crowding a wall so there would be almost no way somebody could damage my car, it happened.  Somebody backed into the parking spot next to me, parked on the line, and damaged my car with their door.  I have no doubt that this person did the damage.

I took pictures, and a video, showing the damage.  It also shows the person parking on the line, the relative height of the damage on my car and the paint on their door edge.  I have the plate number and description of the other vehicle.  I also show in the video that my car is flawless except for this one large ding/paint scrape.  There is also a video camera right in-line with the space between my car and the other person's car.  Finally, I left a note with the owner of the other vehicle with an email address to contact.  I took a picture of a note and left it on the other vehicle and, no surprise, they did not contact me.

Here's the rub.  The camera is under a dome, so I don't know where it is pointed.  I have no idea whether it captures actual video or a series of still shots.  Finally, I don't know the quality of the video, and I can't find any of this out without launching an official investigation with the security company at work.  I would like to keep this outside of the walls of my company as much as possible, particularly since I don't know if the video shows anything.  It could hurt me at work if I launch an investigation and the video isn't conclusive.

What are my options?  I can't file a small claims suit against a plate number, correct?  I don't know if the local police will take a hit and run report with just the evidence I have.  If they did, would they then provide the name of the owner of the other car so I could file a small claims case?  Even with the pictures and video, and showing they parked on the line, would I have a chance of winning without a clear video from the work camera?

I don't like the idea of allowing some careless idiot to get away with damaging my car, but I don't really know my legal options here.  It sucks to see the only flaw on the driver's side of my car every time I walk up to it.
