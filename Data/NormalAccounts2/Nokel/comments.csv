0,"My favorite player Hisato Sato is leaving Sanfrecce Hiroshima after 12 years to go to Nagoya Grampus (who were relegated to Division 2 this season). I know he went there for more playing time but it's sad to see a player who scored 10+ league goals for 11 seasons in a row for one club move on. He's also second top goalscorer in J.League 1 history so I'm disappointed that he's leaving the first division (and also leaving FIFA, where he's a beast).

IMO Jessica Kizaki is one of the more 'western-esque' JAV performers. She does do some submissive videos, but in many of her videos she's either in a dominant role or in a non-rape role, which is similar to a lot of western performers. This is a good change of pace from most JAV videos/performers.

Having said that, I don't think she's close to being the best JAV performer. She's good looking, no doubt, but many of her performances are fairly 'normal' (read: boring) and, while they're certainly above average, aren't something that I feel like watching most the time.

Like most 'middle of the road' JAV performers, I think her best work is in the [Secret Agent](http://javfor.me/41462.html) (use adblock) video series since she doesn't really need to act too much due to the relatively intricate plot/scenery. She's a good enough actress to make it appear 'realistic', though, which is great.

tl;dr: She's better than most, but nowhere near the best of the bunch.",2016-11-14 01:01:18+00:00,d9z6j2q,1.0,t3_5cr2fs,25730.0,JavDownloadCenter

I was a little confused by the storyline, though.

95,"&gt; Fortunately a good ep still comes around every now and again but it kind of feels like going through the motions for the past couple years.

I think it's been a lot better recently. I remember a period of time between mid-late 2014 and mid-late 2015 where I just didn't enjoy the show anymore (and it felt like the brothers didn't like doing it as well). I think it started really turning around with the 'text to speech' goof in Episode 287.

I think part of the problem is that the money zones are too by the books these days. I loved the extreme restraints days where the brothers could just riff on sex toys the entire time because they didn't really need to convince people that sex toys = niiiiiiiice.

I will never understand why some people on here tell new listeners to 'skip the early stuff/listen to the compilations' and then start at Episodes 50+. I started listening at Episode 11 and I have never laughed harder than I did while listening to the first 100-150 podcasts.",2016-11-07 01:50:58+00:00,d9oz7pn,,t1_d9oywvu,423.0,MBMBAM

179,"That Seungri is actually the second coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The proof is all over the place. Just look at the titles of his albums:

1. **Let's Talk About Love**: It's well known that Jesus preached about love and forgiveness while he was alive. Lord Seungri is obviously doing the same. Coincidence? I think not.
2. **VVIP**: This stands for Very Very Important Person. Who do you think would have this status when they reached the gates of heaven? Jesus/Lord Seungri himself.

And that's not all. Just look at the origin of Seungri's name - Lee Seung Hyun. According to behindthename.com,'Seung' means:

* From Sino-Korean 昇 (seung) meaning ""**rise**, ascent"", 勝 (seung) meaning ""victory, excel"" or 承 (seung) meaning ""**inherit**"", as well as other characters which are pronounced similarly.

I ask you, reader, who **rose** again after 3 days? Jesus. Who **rose** again after 3 years? BIGBANG and Lord Seungri himself. Also pay attention to that word **inherit**. Who do people usually inherit things from? Their parents. It's plain to see that Seungri was meant to **inherit** this earth from God.

And what does the second part of his name, 'Hyun' (Hyeon), mean?

* From Sino-Korean 賢 (hyeon) meaning ""**virtuous**, worthy, able"" or other characters which are pronounced similarly. It usually occurs in combination with another character, though it is sometimes used as a stand-alone name.

Who is the most virtuous man who has ever lived? Jesus. 

#BUT THERE'S ONE MORE PIECE OF EVIDENCE THAT'S BEEN HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT THIS ENTIRE TIME

What group is Lord Seungri part of? **BIGBANG** - The event that many scientists believe created the universe. Who else may have created the universe? God himself. Now, we all know that Seungri is not God, but he is also not BIGBANG - Just a part of it. Who else played a part in God's creation and molding of the earth and its people? JESUS. Lord Seungri is clearly the second coming of Christ, and the proof is right in front of our faces.

I rest my case.

In each scene a girl blows and fucks her best friend's boyfriend while the best friend is sitting right next to her. If you like /r/holdthemoan, sex in public places, or men trying to hold it together while getting getting bjs, then this is the video for you!

**Wicca Phase Springs Eternal**: Really cool Emo Trap artist I found this week. I haven't heard anything like him before. All of his songs have ambient elements in them, which I love.

[Wicca Phase Springs Eternal - Icy Waters (I Hate Myself Too)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yon_f1DU3KY)

[Wicca Phase Springs Eternal - Like I'm Tom May](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gxYtvuDVjA)

**ABRA**: RnB singer with great beats and vocals. Hypnotic, almost. Awful Records is putting on some really good shit these days.

[ABRA - Fruit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI1g4dnDtao)

[ABRA - Diamonds &amp; Gold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKyu7SOVOSI)

**Slug Christ**: A drugged out rapper who's one of the most interesting artists on there at the moment. He's an acquired taste but once he 'clicks' for you you'll really understand what he's going for and become a huge fan. He's really good at getting his emotions across to the listener.

[Slug Christ - On It (Seven Grams)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oxf22SGGG8s)

[Slug Christ - Moonlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVenXRwZw5g)

**we hate jh**: A Korean Indie Rock band with chill-inducing choruses. I really dig this band because the guitar is almost as prominent as the vocals in many of their songs.  I listen to a lot of Korean music and these guys are definitely in my top 5 artists.

[we hate jh - Asphalt](https://youtu.be/_gwI4XnLxIs)

[we hate jh - 표류](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx9wPZchZUM)

**DEUX**: A Korean New Jack Swing duo who were pretty big in the '90s. Their beats are great and the vocals have that unrefined quality that was characteristic of '90s Korean Pop. A must listen if you're interested in the rise of KPop and Korean Hip Hop (See Also: [Seo Taiji and Boys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8em1w3KIFA)). These were some of the first artists to incorporate hip hop into Korean music.

[DEUX - Turn Around And Look At Me](https://youtu.be/WksfjyGGkOk)

[DEUX - Break Off The Yoke](https://youtu.be/e7-cr40wfBU)

**Dino.T**: A Korean rapper who uses a lot of dark and creepy beats. His music videos have a low-budget 'insane asylum' aesthetic which really adds to the effect. Perfect for the Halloween season.

**Vol. 1** - Vanilla and pretty funny. Fubuki goes to Saitama's house and ends up riding Saitama while he's asleep. He ends up waking up in the middle of it but has sex with Fubuki after she convinces him that he's dreaming. [Preview Image. It's so dumb but it made me chuckle.](http://imgur.com/YEeXWAd)

**Vol. 2** - A hypnotist evil-doer turns all of Fubuki's henchmen against her, and they proceed to rape her until she starts to become mindbroken. In case you couldn't tell, this chapter isn't funny at all. You should probably give it a pass if you hate that sort of thing.

**Vol. 3** - Continuation of Vol. 2 but this time Tatsumaki gets involved. 

**Vol. 4** - Tatsumaki and Fubuki go to Saitama's house in order to thank him for this help (wink wink).

This is a blowjob only video (besides a 5 minute scene at the end of SDDE-440). Basically the premise is that the nurses at this hospital collect semen samples from various men at the hospital. But there's a twist! They extract the sample with their mouths and then transfer it into the cup! If you like nurse cosplay, semi-medical roleplay (ie. where the 'nurses' are actually performing a task - in this case, collecting semen samples - instead of just fucking random patients), then these are the videos for you!

---

Looks: 7.5/10 - Most of the girls in these videos are actually pretty hot, which isn't always the case for videos with a bunch of performers in them.

Action: 9.5/10

Overall: 9/10

530,"I have four not popular groups I would like you to listen to. All of them have made incredible songs which I think deserve a lot more credit:

[Mr Mr - Do You Feel Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37h3E5SuDbY) - I first heard this song in 2013 and it's *still* one of my favorites

[SNUPER - Platonic Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJLYikmDoIM) - Very /r/Outrun and my pick for the best song of 2016. The first time I heard this song I listened to it nonstop for an entire day. If you like 80s music (or Wonder Girls ""I Feel You"") you will love this song. Also one of the rappers is one of the most beautiful men in KPop. (this is also the music video where the 'snank bar' /r/kpop header comes from)

[Airplane - So Pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAhzEYv9YU8) (RIP) - This group was composed of a main vocalist, rapper, and singer/rapper. They had a really interesting sound but unfortunately they disbanded around year ago. The rapper is still putting out music but I forget his name.

[PURE - I Still Love You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltn5pzZMlas) - This will forever and always be my pick for the best debut song from any KPop group. They absolutely kill it. Unfortunately they followed this up with a cheesy male-aegyo 'cutesy' concept that drove the group under. RIP.

[Yellow - This Is My Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA9he9vFEIU) (Live Version) - Yellow came to save KPop but the world wasn't ready for their vocals. If that girl with the shortish hair is still making music I NEED TO KNOW because she has an amazing voice.

tl;dr: 2013 was such a good year for KPop which makes 4/5 of these groups' lack of success even more painful ;__;",2016-09-14 05:03:02+00:00,d7m1taq,1.0,t3_52oqs6,3854.0,kpop

* The black bar around the sidebar is too dark. Make it the same color as the blue bar circling the ""5 points (78% upvoted)"" section in the sidebar.
* The submission links in the sidebar are too light (both text and backgrounds)
* The link to /r/JonTron under the header looks cramped (actually, this is true for every link located directly under the header). Make it smaller or edit the CSS so the subreddit link is connected to the picture of Jon in the header (ie. when you click Jon it takes you to the /r/JonTron homepage). 
* The lines under each submission are so long that they pass under the sidebar. Make them short so that they stop before they hit the sidebar (eg. /r/Soccer) OR separate the submissions from the sidebar with blank space that's a different color (eg. /r/Jleague /r/KPop)
* The bar in the top right that displays our username, karma, mail, etc looks ugly. Fuse it in-line with the 'hot, rising, top, etc' links (eg. /r/Jleague) or make the background see through (eg. /r/Gunners).
* Also my flair is fucked up.

The basic premise of this movie is that Yui Hatano goes to a hypnotism place for some reason and (surprise surprise) the hypnotist has sex with her!!!! 

There are three sex scenes in the movie. Two of them star Yui Hatano in a half-asleep hypnotized state and in the final one she is basically a nympho. Based on the title I think the movie is split into three parts (one where she's been given an aphrodisiac, one where she's hypnotized, and one where she's drunk), but I don't care enough to verify.

**Looks:** 7.5/10 - Yui looks the same as she always does, which is OK I guess.

**Sex:** 5.5/10 - Pretty tame. I probably would have given this a higher score if she kept her outfits on for more than 1 minute, but she takes them off right away. Also, Yui doesn't whine as often as usual (since like I said before she's pretty much half-asleep), but it happens occasionally.


**Overall:**  - 6/10 - No where near the best hypno movie I've seen (the ones that Saimin Kenkyuusho Bekkan do are top notch, like ANX-054 and ANX-052), but it's still alright if you like this sort of thing.

As I walked past where he sat I was hit with an overpowering stench. Onions. The man's bathrobe was brimming with chopped onions. Before I had to a chance to process this information an alarm rang out. Mr. Gervais had hit the jackpot. While coins ejaculated out of the machine Mr. Gervais let out a horrible cackle.

This movie literally doesn't have any sex in it. The basic plot is that a female student takes a video of her teacher (Reiko Kobayakawa) using the bathroom, and then blackmails her into exposing herself to the class. Reiko Kobayakawa is one of the rare JAV performers (that I've seen) who's in her mid-30s, [still has a great body](http://www.boobpedia.com/wiki/images/4/4d/ReikoKobayakawa.jpg), and can really pull off 'mature' roles (eg. teachers, moms, etc) without it seeming out of place or ridiculous.

He was adjusting to a more physical league at the beginning of the season and 2. He broke his jaw and was out for a couple of months right when he was starting to get comfortable. 

Here are some former J.League players who were/are relatively good in Europe:

884,"Favorites:

**[Reiko Kobayakawa](http://i.imgur.com/W9Evi8B.jpg)** - Her sex scenes aren't that amazing but her bj scenes are top tier. I think she genuinely does not like having cum in her mouth (I've literally never seen her swallow) so when she lets it dribble out of her mouth it's 1000x hotter than when other performers do it. 

**[Aya Sakurai](http://i.imgur.com/M4dCMsM.jpg)** - Again, not the best sex scenes, but she doesn't look like a lot of other JAV performers (she's definitely had work done) which sets her apart. She 100% has the best lips in JAV.

**[Kurea Hasumi](http://i.imgur.com/yxSdYaA.jpg)** - Super hot but only really like her in submissive roles. WANZ-266 is one of my favorite JAVs of all time due to her performance. I think she talks too much when she's in dominant roles (which I might enjoy more if I could understand Japanese), which is alright, but she's really fantastic in rape/humiliation scenes.

My other two favorites who I feel less strongly about:

* Ai Uehara - Only in hypnosis/aphrodisiac/submissive roles. I really don't like her dominant stuff.
* Hirose Nanami - Again, only in submissive roles. She is absolutely amazing in ANX-052 and SMA-782 because 1. She can squirt (a lot. a lot a lot) 2. She is most believably when she's 'hypnotized'.

Also I love all the girl who appear in [Toyohiko](http://www.javlibrary.com/en/vl_maker.php?m=a4ia) movies because those things are degrading as hell.

---

Least Favorites:

^(Note: I'm only including performers that I like enough to keep their movies on my hard drives)

**Julia** - She's one of the hottest girls in JAV but her performances are so boring! I think the only movie of hers that I actually like is MIDE-241 since she's wearing a ball gag the whole time. She has so much potential but her lackluster performances ruin everything.

**Yuna Shiina** - *SOOOOOOOOOOO FUCKING HOT* but she never shuts up! She's so whiny that even her rape-videos are unwatchable (yet she's still on my hard drive because she looks fantastic).

**Yui Hatano** - She whines too much and she always has a smile-grimace on her face which really turns me off. She's OK in hypnotism/BJ movies but in everything else I just can't get through it.

**Anri Okita** - Her face is way too puffy for me and IMO she's one of the worst performers in JAV. I haven't liked a single thing she's in.",2016-08-08 00:15:22+00:00,d68erxn,1.0,t3_4wn0tg,7141.0,JavDownloadCenter
885,"&gt; Japan used to be the go place for Koreans in the 90s, but now, only mid to low tier players are mainly choosing to go there due to the lack of club options in Korea.

Japanese clubs just signed Jung Sung Ryong and Kim Seung Gyu. Would you call them mid-low tier even though they're features of the Korean NT?",2016-08-07 22:16:21+00:00,d68af67,6.0,t1_d688ok7,2701.0,soccer
886,"I can't see any top-tier Japanese players moving to another Asian league. I think it would have happened already with the Middle East if it were possible. The J.League is quite possibly the most healthy league in Asia and I think it would be hard for Japanese players to leave unless they were going to a European club. 

The Chinese league moving from Koreans to Australians is an interesting thought. You can already see that happening in recent years with the likes of Apostolos Giannou and Tim Cahill (both of whom have never played in A-League/didn't move directly from A-League to CSL).",2016-08-07 21:44:18+00:00,d6896lo,6.0,t1_d688ok7,778.0,soccer
887,"What do you think about Koreans getting signed by Middle Eastern or Chinese clubs for massive wages? I know Japan used to be the go-to place for Koreans in the past, but the wages there were low enough (and Japan didn't realize that they could sell players for more than a handful of pocket lint until recently) that if Europe came calling they'd choose to leave. That, at least to me, doesn't seem to be the case with ME and Chinese clubs (or at least European clubs don't bother going after those players since they're on such massive wages). Do you think this is hurting the National Team in any way?

I guess we'll see if any of these Chinese or ME based players make the move to/back to Europe in the next few years since this is a relatively new phenomena, but in the past you'd see the likes of Park Ji Sung, Kim Jin Su, etc start in J.League or J.League 2 and then go to Europe from there.",2016-08-07 21:26:39+00:00,d688i1l,4.0,t1_d687vnq,943.0,soccer

Talents that might go to Europe:

* FW Takuma Asano - Just got signed by Arsenal from Sanfrecce Hiroshima
* FW Takashi Usami - Just got signed by FC Augsburg from Gamba Osaka
* According to the guys in the podcast I linked to earlier they think that Kosuke Nakamura, a 21 year old at Kashiwa Reysol, has got what it takes to become the best Japanese goalkeeper of all time in a few years. He might be one to look out for at the Olympics if he plays.

I can't believe how awful his styling was in the later years. Him and Chris looked like a couple of dads.

EDIT: And after watching loads of live videos I was surprised to see how often Chris's voice was present. I always thought JC and Justin sang everything and the other three just showed up in the chorus, but Chris harmonizes a ton with the main two.

Article summary:

&gt; Taeyang And G-Dragon Of Big Bang Recall The Time Starvation Drove Them To Break Into Their Manager's Room In Search Of Food

&gt; ""Because [our manager] was often busy, there was a time when he didn't bring us food for several weeks,"" Taeyang said.

&gt; ""There was this chocolate cracker that we liked, the one made with wheat,"" T.O.P said.
""We really wanted it, but it was kind of a luxurious snack. It was [50 cents] more expensive than the other snacks. If you buy one package, there are like 18 or 20 of them inside. We would decide on how many we'd eat per day and eat one at a time. Even though we were so hungry and wanted to eat them all in one sitting, we thought we might crave them later at night. We ate [the crackers] slowly, letting them melt on our tongues.""

&gt; Back in those early days, before Big Bang's official debut in 2006, the band members recalled living on the equivalent of $4.50.",2016-07-25 06:26:41+00:00,d5poly0,2.0,t1_d5pn4d2,3615.0,kpop

1033,"My process for listening to songs usually goes like this:

1. Do I like the first 10 seconds? If yes, continue to 2. If no, stop listening
2. Is the song interesting enough to listen to past the first chorus? If yes, congratulations, I like the song. If no, stop listening.

This is my thought process when I listen to most songs (usually on the Korean label [MirrorballMusic's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/mirrorballmusickorea), since the songs on that channel are usually either A. terrible ballads/folk music/slow songs or B. really cool electronic/rock/hip hop songs). 

If I enjoy the single, I'll check out the album. Album's do tend to take me a little while longer to like, though I tend to know if I love/hate certain songs after my first listen.

Having said that, sometimes I do need to listen to a song/artist a number of times before it/they finally 'click(s)' with me. The most recent example of this is [Futuristic Swaver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4rQ8TZe6xU), a cloud rap/trap artist from Korea.

I just found a bunch of JAV that are based on hentai manga by Chuuka Naruto! If you like aphrodisiacs, slave training, and hot chicks having sex with dirty middle-aged men, then you'll love all of Chuuka Naruto's work.

This one is basically about a principal who gives aphrodisiacs to a teacher and 'trains' her until she's his sex slave. I'm not really a fan of Mako Oda but the manga is definitely worth a read!

1078,"Personally I don't really see the point in it since we all know the same ones as last year (minus Ai Uehara and Anri Okita if you remove them). You can pretty much guarantee the semi finalists will be Yui Hatano, Kurea Hasumi, Aika, and Kaori/Minori Hatsune/Hitomi Tanaka (god forbid) since they're posted here the most.

Perhaps a better idea would be to do the contest using specific videos instead of performers. So for example BBI-147 vs MIDE-231 instead of Kurea Hasumi vs Hana Nonoka. Maybe have people nominate videos in a google doc in this format so it's easy to sort:

Video Code|Performer(s)
:--|:--
MIDE-248|Anri Okita
BBI-147|Kurea Hasumi

If you make it so people can only nominate 2 or 3 videos it shouldn't be too massive. You could also make it so a single performer could only have a maximum of 2 videos in the contest by counting which two of their videos received the most nominations (and chucking out the rest).

I might be looking back at them through rose-tinted glasses since I started listening to the show at episode 11 or 12, but I remember laughing out loud nearly every episode back then. Quality goofs and spoofs. The pre/early-Max Fun days were basically the wild west for MBMBAM.

On the other end of the spectrum - there was a stretch from 2014 to mid-2015 where I felt that the chemistry between the brothers was a little off and it didn't seem like they were having as much fun doing the show as before.

I'll probably check out the rest of Kagewani Shou (from last season), Mob Psycho 100, and Shokugeki no Souma at some point in the next few months. At the moment I'm just waiting for Haikyuu season 3 to come out since that's the only anime I care about nowadays. 

If more shows got better dubs I'd probably check them out, though. Dragon Ball Kai and Space Dandy were great dubbed and allowed me to do other things while I watched them. I'm too busy to stare at subtitles all day.

&gt; I think I love it because the instrumental is really unobtrusive and just sits in the background the entire time. Super chill.

[SNSD - Into The New World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k2Zzkw_-0I)

&gt; All of their other songs are garbage as far as I'm concerned. I couldn't give less of a fuck about SNSD. Having said that, I really dig the mid-2000s K-Pop ""we're halfway between electronic and real instruments"" instrumental this song has. It also lacks the insanely overproduced vocals that I hear in most SM songs nowadays (looking at you SHINee).

[U-Kiss - Can't Breathe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHD2W72HBDk)

&gt; Random album filler off their ""Collage"" album. Standing Still is an OK song but this one is just fantastic. It reminds me of B1A4's 1st Japanese album, one of my favorite albums of all time by a Korean artist, which makes it awesome. 

[Teen Top - I Wanna Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1pNnvXMHBI)

&gt; This song is right up my alley and is literally the only Teen Top song I know besides Miss Right (since that's the only goddamn song TT performed during that promotion cycle. What a fucking travesty). HEY Y'ALL MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T BE STUCK IN NUGU LAND IF YOU HAD PERFORMED 'I WANNA LOVE' INSTEAD OF THAT PIECE OF SHIT 'MISS RIGHT'.

[APink - 하늘 높이 (feat. Joker)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9PKx2Oy61w) 

&gt; This song gets trashed because of the intro, but it's legitimately good. I'm obviously a sucker for dance tracks like this. That 'oh no' 'oh yeah' part at 1:22 IS AMAZINGGGGG. 

Tl;dr Album filler/non-promoted songs from 2013-2014 are amazing.

---

I also think [Love Options](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPqtL1dtrlA) by BESTie might fit in here.

1168,"Back again with more [Dagashi Kashi](http://myanimelist.net/manga/75993/Dagashi_Kashi) doujins! Dagashi Kashi doujins are amazing because most of them are drawn very well and are just as funny as the official manga. I recommend them to anyone who's read/seen Dagashi Kashi or even anyone who hasn't heard of it.

I've put the words *NEW* next to doujins that weren't in my previous Dagashi Kashi doujin submission.

**Otona No Dagashi**

&gt; *Volume 1-3*: Hotaru hatches the ultimate plan to get Kokonotsu to finally take over his father's store - marrying Kokonotsu! 

&gt; Each chapter is filled with happy sex and one particularly hot scene where Hotaru gives Kokonotsu a blowjob from under his desk while an oblivious Tou is buying candy.

&gt; The ending is pretty cute/hilarious, but I don't want to spoil it!

&gt; *NEW - Volume 4*: This volume is unrelated to volumes 1-3 and doesn't have Hotaru in it - just Saya and Kokonotsu! It's really well drawn and incorporates a scene from the manga.

&gt; **4 volumes, 110 pages**

**Dagashi Chichi**

&gt; In this one Hotaru and Kokonotsu fuck a lot, which makes Saya jealous. Eventually she gets some action, though. This one uses a lot of scenes that happened in the manga.

&gt; Note: I edited out a 1.5 page flashback of Saya and Kokonotsu playing doctor, but you can easily find it online if you search for it.

&gt; **3 volumes, 53 pages** 

**Sayashi Dashi**

&gt; This one is closer to the spirit of the show/manga imo. Hotaru, Saya, and Kokonotsu play a game of strip mahjong which ends with a threesome. It has some pretty funny reaction faces and Saya proves that she is best girl.

&gt; **1 volume, 22 pages**

**Daga Hazure** *NEW*

&gt; Similar story to Otona No Dagashi Vol. 1-3, though this one is more focused on Hotaru wanting Kokonotsu to get her pregnant.

&gt; **1 volume, 25 pages**

**SoOO Sensou** *NEW*

&gt; Hotaru shows Kokonotsu the correct way to eat [Yan Yan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yan_Yan_(snack) (basically a nutella snack pack) by using his dick as a prop. Saya eventually joins in as well.

&gt; It's pretty weird and funny.

&gt; **1 volume, 26 pages**

**Dagashi Kashi No Ero-Hon 2 Kokonatsu Wa Kouiuno Ga Suki Nano** *NEW*

&gt; Saya gets jealous of the way Kokonotsu looks at Hotaru so she decides to be straightforward with him. The art is OK (though the characters look a little lanky), but the main thing I like about this doujin is that it takes place from Saya's perspective (not POV, but you can read her thoughts).

&gt; **1 volume, 25 pages**

**The Candy Consextioner is Nothing More Than a Pervert** *NEW*

&gt; **All pages are in color**

&gt; Hotaru is an airhead in this one, which I don't like, and there really isn't much of a plot. It's in color, though, so it's still worth checking out.

&gt; Note: I removed pages 2-4 because they included shota.

&gt; **1 volume, 11 (14) pages**

**Dagashi wa Sake ni Au** *NEW*

&gt; Hotaru gets drunk and has sex with Kokonotsu. That's pretty much it. For some reason Hotaru is drawn 'thicker' than normal in this doujin, which is a little offputting.

&gt; **1 volume, 22 pages**

**Total: 13 volumes, 294 pages**

---

Let me know if you guys want to see more doujins (feel free to specify which series you'd like to see) or just hentai manga in general. I try to only post good quality stuff so don't worry about /r/javdownloadcenter being spammed by manga 24/7. I have a few really long volumes of aphrodisiac/hypnosis manga by Chuuka Naruto ([example chapter](http://imgur.com/a/srOmo)), and a lot of other stuff, that I could post if this gets a good response.

He's had a few Euro (Bundesliga in particular) clubs interested in him from what I've heard. 

Everybody seems to be making fun of this signing so hopefully he will live up to expectations at the Olympics (he's considered to be one of the best, if not the best, player on the squad). Just because they haven't heard of him doesn't mean he's shit. 

He's no Miyaichi. Asano has professional experience in the best league in Asia (as well as national team caps) while Miyaichi was signed directly out of high school. They don't even play the same position or have the same amount of strength.

The last console I owned was an Xbox 360, so I'm used to the stick layout that its controllers had. Did anybody here switch from Xbox 360 to PS4? Did it take you a while to get used to the new controller layout?

This series is pretty good if you like bondage and 'slavery'. Each video is basically exactly the same - the girl goes to a job interview and has to become a sex slave in order to get the job (or at least I think that's what the plot is. It honestly doesn't matter). The scenes usually go in this order:

1. Girl goes to a job interview, the guys interviewing her start feeling her up, and she ends up getting fucked by one guy.
2. Bondage sex with multiple men (reluctant)
3. Bondage sex with multiple men (kind of into it)
4. Tied to a chair while a guy holds a vibrator against her pussy.

If that sounds good to you, check this out! The kinkiness of the scenes makes the whining that some performers do bearable, and all of the girls who star in this series are slightly above average or incredibly hot.

Looks: 8.5/10

Sex: 9.5/10 (a must see if you like rough sex and/or bondage)

Overall: 9/10

[Ballad/Electronic] [Singer/Songwriter Gingee - Meow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdtX1IBflUI)

&gt; Best artist in Korea at the moment? I think so! Gingee released her debut song [The Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gF7vgqCtys) back in January of this year and Meow, her second release, is just as good! Her voice is AMAZING! Just a week ago she released an unfinished demo track called [Narara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UIpxA5GK3U) and it sends chills down my spine every time I listen to it. She's definitely one to keep an eye on for the future.

[Hip Hop] [Futuristic Swaver - Gang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otFuKz9bzsA) *

&gt; Dude looks nerdy as hell but he's got some swag. The beat in this song is top tier and Swaver's flow is great as always (and less polarizing than his 'cloud rap' songs).

[Electro Pop] [Aseul - Fisher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnY5pnbLJF0)

&gt; After years of waiting, Yukari is finally back! This is my favorite song off of her album ""New Pop"" and imo is the most reminiscent of her dream pop album ""Echo"".

[Instrumental] [Roy C. -  대자연](https://youtu.be/F3hB9LqVzHY)

&gt; Very calming. Kind of reminds me on [Doxx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f_z60CSNEc) in a lot of ways. 

[Indie Rock] [we hate jh - 표류](https://youtu.be/cx9wPZchZUM) *

&gt; Hands down the best Indie Rock song I've heard all year. The singer is fantastic and the song overall is catchy as hell!

[Pop Rock] [The Electriceels) - Equator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVV8ksdTxM)

Great album if you like traditional Irish music/instruments. It includes loads of instrumentals as well as a few songs with vocals.

The best song on the album in undoubtedly Shaun Davey's rendition of [The Parting Glass](https://youtu.be/xDB87o-njFQ). I get chills every time I hear the vocal section (which starts at 2:16) and nearly cried the first few times I listened to it. Just spectacular.

The Return of Jafar (1994) - Aladdin came out in 1992

Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas (1997 - technically a midquel) - Beauty and the Beast came out in 1991

The Lion King II (1998) - The Lion King came out in 1994

The Little Mermaid II (2000) - The Little Mermaid came out in 1989

Instead we got, like I said before, a rock paper scissors simulator. 

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Inazuma for the first couple of hours, but once I got to hour 10 or so I got tired of every encounter on the field being decided by whether or not you picked a more powerful attack than your opponent.

Plot: It starts with Rion Ichijou walking down the street while sucking on a lollipop. Then she knocks on a random door, signs some sort of contract, and all of a sudden she lives with a bunch of old men. IDK. Basically she just makes out with old people and does the sex to them.

Looks: 9.5/10 - She's probably in my Top 3 best looking JAV performers

Sex: 8.5/10 - Rion is a tiny bit whiney but that's canceled out by how into it she is. 

Overall: 9/10 - I'm not normally into old men having sex with 20-somethings, but when the girl is this hot and totally into what's happening it turns everything into this weird storm of taboo + dirty + confusing that is strangely appealing to me. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Plot: Gals (tanned, party girl types) get drugged by the owner of a karaoke bar who then has sex with them while they're passed out.

Looks: 7.5/10 - The first girl isn't too great but the other 3 are pretty cute.

Sex: 7/10 - If you've seen a ""Time Stop"" video before it's pretty much the same thing (eg. no whining, the girls get moved into different positions, etc).

Overall: 7/10 - Better than the average ""Time Stop"" video but still nothing spectacular. If you like the idea of ""Time Stop"" but don't like that a lot of the girls get frozen while making goofy facial expressions, you might like this (even though this isn't actually a ""Time Stop"" video).

It was a 'perfect storm' of:

1. [The J-Talk Podcast starting earlier that same year](http://jtalkpodcast.blogspot.com/)
2. [The J.League starting to post highlights w/ English commentary on YouTube that same year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDLPRse_VcE) (they've since stopped doing that, though)
3. Hisato Sato leading Sanfrecce Hiroshima to their first J1.League title. Their playstyle was and is very exciting to watch.

If those three things weren't going on at that time I don't know if I would have been able to start following J.League. It was still difficult to keep up with what was going on at that time due to the lack of English language news, but over the years that's slowly changed. Now Japanese people stream matches regularly, there are options available for legal streaming, a variety of English language J.League sites/Twitters have popped up, [the J.League overhauled their English language website](http://www.jleague.jp/en/), and numerous other things have happened that makes the league easier for English speakers to follow.",2016-05-22 17:11:02+00:00,d3fcfd0,4.0,t1_d3f27yq,24059.0,soccer

1385,"Not all of these are ""star players"", but they're fairly recognizable.

**Jay Bothroyd** was J2.League top scorer last season and is tied for 4th top scorer in J1.League this season. He plays for Jubilo Iwata.

Former Greece defender **Avraam Papadopoulos** just signed for Jubilo Iwata a few days ago. Dunno how he'll do, though.

**Yoshito Okubo** was J1.League top scorer in  2013, 2014, and 2015. He went to the World Cup with Japan in 2010 and 2014. He plays for Kawasaki Frontale. The club's GK is **Jung Sung-ryong**, who started for the South Korean NT for many years.

**Yasuhito Endo** has the most Japan National Team caps (152). His teammates include the highly touted striker **Takashi Usami** 

**Shusaku Nishikawa** was the backup GK for the Japan NT for years and got a fair number of starts once Kawashima was dropped. He's considered the best GK in Japan. His teammates at Urawa Red Diamonds include **Tadanari Lee** (former Southampton player) and Slovenian NT regulars **Branko Ilić** and **Zlatan Ljubijankić**. They're the most stacked team when it comes to pure talent (though that doesn't always transfer to good team play).

Free-kick specialist and Celtic legend **Shunsuke Nakamura** is still doing his thing at Yokohama F. Marinos.

FC Tokyo has got **Nathan Burns** (Australia NT) and **Masato Morishige** (2014 World Cup starter for Japan).

And then there's **Kim Seung-gyu** at Vissel Kobe. He's the starting GK for the South Korea NT right now iirc. You might know him from FIFA since I think he's the best South Korean GK on there.

So yeah, you might recognize some of those guys. There's a lot more great players who aren't too well known outside of Japan, though (Hisato Sato, Yohei Toyoda, etc).

There's also some guys hanging around in J2.League. Off the top of my head there's **Jong Tae-se** (the Japanese-born North Korean player who cried tears of joy at the 2010 WC) and **Mitchell Duke** (Australia).",2016-05-22 04:10:43+00:00,d3evbwc,2.0,t1_d3euivn,1774.0,soccer

1392,"Behind The Eyes is an interesting album which, at least for a majority of the songs on it, I need to be in a certain mood to listen to.

The standout song on the album, and my personal favorite, is [""Blind""](https://soundcloud.com/fndt/googolplex-blind?in=fndt/sets/googolplex-behind-the-eyes). It's strikingly similar to Yukari's [""Hang On""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGWKJtQgQEQ) in terms of the vocal-instrumental balance (by which I mean the vocals blend into the background), 
but the notes in ""Blind"" linger much longer and the line between the vocals and instrumental is blurred to the point where it's hard to differentiate between the two in some instances. It's an incredible piece of music.

[""Get Lost""](https://soundcloud.com/fndt/googolplex?in=fndt/sets/googolplex-behind-the-eyes) is another song off the album that's in the same vein as ""Blind"", though it's much more laid back throughout.

Behind The Eyes is without a doubt one of the coolest albums I have ever heard.

This series is awesome! 

Each scene in this video features a different ""amateur"" girl in a submissive role. The sex is very messy (ie. spit, squirting, lactation) and the girls are thick with gigantic tits. They do whine a bit, but honestly that's completely ok with me since their masks make the scenes 1000% hotter than most JAV.

Looks: 9/10 - you never see their faces but their body's are hot af if you're into slightly thicker chicks.

Sex: 8.5/10

Overall: 9/10 - not the best video in the series but it's still great!

1434,"Go Easy is one of my favorite hip hop albums of all time. It was my go to ""study music"" during college due to how mellow most of the tracks are, which I'll always appreciate it for. 

My favorite tracks:

[Want You Back (Feat. NODO)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiAhJ_gAM-k)

&gt; The instrumental kicks ass - especially the bass drum kick that's paired up with hits from the bass guitar. I'm a huge fan of Jint's rap-singing in this one as well. It's definitely the best songs on the album imo and it's tough not to stick it on replay whenever I hear it.

[Luv Songz (Feat. C-Luv)](https://youtu.be/STCONoL4LpY)

&gt; Another great instrumental! Various vocal effects (pitch-changing, echo, etc) complement the 'floaty' instrumental in a cool way, which I thought was a nice touch. 

[Available (Feat. Lady Jane)](https://youtu.be/tE2oVFLqi0o)

&gt; This is my second favorite song on the album. Jint's voice sounds great and, once again, the vocal effects used throughout the song are really cool to listen to.

My Rating: 8.5/10

While Go Easy has a *lot* of great tracks, there are a few that I don't like at all (My Audi, Keep Your Head Up) and others that I think are just ok (What An Insult, Sophiscated Bitch 2012). Those 'bad' songs are buried under a pile of close-to-perfect songs, though, which is why I think this album deserves an 8.5.

Each match involves setting up player positions with the stylus and engaging in ""rock, paper, scissors""-esque 'battles' (made more intricate with the introduction of various powerups) when two opposing players 'collide' on the field or a player takes a shot on goal. While the story is lacking (it's like a typical shonen anime), the amount of players you can recruit and the battle system make it a relatively enjoyable experience, especially if you can find it on sale. - /u/nokel

IMO adding a ""Description"" and ""Fan Take"" section to the wiki would make it a lot more interesting and helpful.

1473,"I think that KPop group BIGBANG does a great job with costume changes. 

Their concerts are usually very 'spectacular', with fireworks, moving platforms on stage, and etc, and they tend to change their outfits to fit the tone of the songs they're performing. They don't wear anything too outlandish but I think their outfits complement lighting, song tone, etc very well. It feels like they're 'setting the scene', so to speak.

[Here's an example from one of their concerts in March 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_BGlhyDn80). Skip forward in 10 or 20 minute increments and you'll see what I mean. 

Basically I think it's all a matter of stage presence, budget, and fan reaction. Can the performers pull off the look they're going for? Is the concert a big production with a lot of flashy lights, fireworks, and other effects? Is the audience totally into it? If at least one of those things is a 'no', I think costume changes will hurt rather than help. But if the performers are confident, have a great team running the concert, and know their audience, I think costume changes will turn a concert into something really special.",2016-05-11 00:25:19+00:00,d30ogl0,1.0,t3_4inpn8,69512.0,LetsTalkMusic

Dragon Ball Kai is second best, though some of the characters (especially Tien) stand out in a bad way.

I know that the Black Lagoon dub is highly regarded, but from what I've heard it just doesn't sound as good as the sub. Revy in particular is so over-the-top in the dub that it sounds goofy imo.

My main problem with dubs is that in each of them there is at least one female voice that is grating on my ears. In [WataMote](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16742/Watashi_ga_Motenai_no_wa_Dou_Kangaetemo_Omaera_ga_Warui) it was the MC, in [Kore wa Zombie](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8841/Kore_wa_Zombie_Desu_ka) it was Haruna, and in Dragon Ball it was Bulma (EDIT: Just realized that a lot of the female VAs that I don't like in dubs have slightly higher pitched voices than any girls I've ever met in real life, which might be why they sound so strange to me).

I'm listening to the album for the first time right now and so far I really like:

* Give Me Five - Kind of reminds me of Neon Bunny. I dig it!

http://www.oneworldsports.com/blogs/jleague-breeding-ground-poor-officiating/

&gt; The biggest problem is that controversial calls are never discussed openly, either in the press or on TV, during match broadcasts. Football fans in Europe, Africa and the Americas will be astonished to hear this, but in Japan, broadcasters do not even show replays of controversial calls. Indeed, it is very rare for TV to even show a replay of an offside call, in order to avoid unnecessary controversy, or causing the linesman to ""lose face"".

http://www.goal.com/en/news/14/asia/2010/11/11/2208808/asian-comment-its-time-for-the-j-league-to-stop-censoring

&gt; After Sanfrecce Hiroshima defeated the visiting Urawa Red Diamonds 2-1 on Sunday, Urawa manager Volker Finke underwent his ritual post-match interview for SkyPerfectTV.

&gt; Dressed in black and looking like a character from a Wim Wender movie, the German coach listened patiently to a few questions journalist Yasutaka Yoshida candidly posed to him, before snapping when asked:

&gt; “The Reds seem on their way to becoming a better team. So, what is one more thing they need to further improve?”

&gt; After blowing his white hair out of his eyes with a puff, Finke replied, “To begin with, we need to get penalties when we deserve them... If it would have happened in Germany, [referee Yoshiro Imamura’s mistake] would have been shown repeatedly on TV and judged by many.

&gt; ""Nobody will in this country [Japan] but I want to do it [because] in my career I have never seen a more blatant penalty foul.”

&gt; Finke was referring to an episode that took place about one hour into the game when at 1-1, Sanfrecce’s goalkeeper Shusaku Nishikawa tripped Wilfried Sanou with an arm, clearly denying a chance for the Burkinabé to score.

&gt; ...

&gt; In fact, during the game SkyPerfecTV showed only a quick replay of the foul on Sanou from behind the goal, in which a post covered most of the scene and the commentators abstained from judgement. Ditto for Yoshida, even after Finke’s direct answer.

&gt; In the evening’s “J.League After-game Show,” Keiji Hirahata (otherwise a very entertaining anchorman) completely ignored the episode; as was the case on Yabecchi FC, the popular Sunday night show about Japanese soccer run by frisky TV personality, Hiroyuki Yabe.

&gt; On Tuesday, it was the turn of the two most popular soccer magazines published in Japan. Soccer Digest carried a report on the game though the whole focus was on how brave the Sanfrecce players were, playing until the last minute and eventually prevailing after their extra-time exploits in the Nabisco Cup.

&gt; Soccer Magazine transcribed Finke’s interview with some minor editing but no commentary whatsoever.",2016-04-28 23:08:30+00:00,d2lcjnm,1.0,t3_4gwj1m,1835.0,soccer

1593,"**[BIGBANG - Made Series (JPN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_Series)**

BIGBANG is one of the biggest boy groups in Korea and Asia at the moment. They debuted in 2006 and since then their members have established themselves as fashion/musical icons ([G-Dragon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3ULhmadHkg), who recently did a song with [Baauer and MIA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fGoOEGojY0)), actors ([T.O.P](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAoME_aMm1w), [Seungri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yki3X1pG3ZE)), and solo artists ([Taeyang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIt6KCwlFPw), [Daesung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlG0fz4WvoQ)). 

Made Series is the groups' 5th Japanese studio album and boasts tracks which range from Dance-Pop to RnB to Hip Hop. Acclaimed producer [Teddy Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Park) and BIGBANG leader G-Dragon teamed up to produce most of the tracks on the album. 

Highlights:

[Bae Bae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKD03uPVD-Q) - A creative and quirky song which fuses Hip Hop and Ballad in an interesting way, all tied together with an innuendo-filled music video.

[Zutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8t8A8E_Tqc) - The two rappers GD and TOP finally release another joint track after their successful 2010 album [GD&amp;TOP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6WUvDlkVSM), and it does not disappoint. Chill, catchy, and an all around good listen.

[Sober](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBNQgq56egk) - This song has more of a pop rock sound which is perfect for summer. 

[Loser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CTced9CMMk) - A mellow song with an 'ambient' piano and acoustic guitar creating a cool feel. The rapper TOP's vocal tone really fits the song well.

1598,"For me a 7 means that the show was interesting enough to marathon and/or I thought the show had a 'special something' which made it stand out from other shows. My 8s, 9s, and 10s are based off of that.

EG of a 7: Dagashi Kashi - I never felt bored watching an episode but I didn't feel it was ever better than ""above average""

EG of an 8: One Outs - I thought the show dragged a bit at points but the premise and the mind games made it extremely interesting to watch.

EG of a 9: Great Teacher Onizuka - Really amazing plot and MC, but I felt that it lacked a bit of polish which would have made it a 10. 

EG of a 10: House of Five Leaves - Best written anime I have ever seen. Intriguing characters and a plot which kept me engaged throughout.

Scores below a 7:

6: Interesting plot and/or characters but the show couldn't keep me engaged throughout the season and/or it had some major flaws (Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi, Young Black Jack)

5: Just OK. After finishing a show I rate 5 I usually never think about it again. For these kinds of shows I usually got bored halfway through (Ben-to, Kuroko no Basket) or did not feel it stood out in any way (GATE S1, Overlord)

4: I really did not like how the story was handled (Log Horizon) or appreciated what it was trying to do but just didn't enjoy it (FLCL, Redline)

3: Show made me roll my eyes a number of times but I still had an ok time watching it even though it was a bit of a mess (Charlotte, Highschool of the Dead)

2: Hated the characters and the plot (Mira Nikki) OR thought the creators were just phoning it in (Dragon Ball Z: Cooler's Revenge)

1: Why does this show/OVA even exist? These either bored me to death (Weiß Survive) or made me feel *angry* and uncomfortable (Highschool of the Dead: Drifters of the Dead)",2016-04-28 17:11:32+00:00,d2kwv88,1.0,t3_4gusrt,2324.0,anime

1. Give a quick background of the witches and wizards who actually defeated the monsters that are accredited to Lockhart, and show how they defeated those monsters.
2. Follow Lockhart as he tracks those people down and alters their memories.

Those two major parts of the movie would be interspersed between scenes of Lockhart slowly gaining notoriety and having to deal with skeptics as well as A. perfecting his memory charm and B. becoming more adept at avoiding anyone who could be trying to catch him in the act / uncover the truth.

The story could end with Lockhart being tracked down by Dumbledore (who suspected that Lockhart was a fraud), who would offer Lockhart the DAtDA position at Hogwarts.

On second thought this might work better as a miniseries.",2016-04-27 02:55:42+00:00,d2iv40d,5.0,t1_d2iu9a1,1278.0,youtubehaiku

&gt; Really fun song that just makes you want to dance. I'm a huge fan of breathy/quiet vocals which don't overpower the instrumental (eg. [Yukari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGWKJtQgQEQ), [Bonjour Suzuki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSRsyqsyv4Q)), so this song was right up my alley.

[Rock/Electronic] [BEARX - 밤그늘 (Night Shade)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKzzkY1vheI)

&gt; One of the best songs I've heard this year. It takes a full minute for the vocals to kick in and it's totally worth the wait. The chorus, while pretty simple instrumentally, gets me hyped whenever I hear it and I don't think I'll ever get tired of it.

[Rock/Folk] [Danpyunsun and the Sailors - High and Low](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1hAszFEuvM) *

&gt; Super unique sound which I haven't heard much in Korean music. The fiddle (or violin?) player adds a really cool flavor to the song which complements the singer's vocals perfectly. Overall a really interesting song musically which everybody can appreciate on some level. 

[Rock/Electronic] [Sugardonut - Imagine, Close Your Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOFiVKnRIds) *

Here are some of my favorites at the moment:

[[Indie Rock] Fantastic Drugstore - Scarlet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p59AA1fNsPQ)

Pretty funky instrumentals coupled with a singer who has a great falsetto.

[[Dream Pop] Yukari - Hang On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGWKJtQgQEQ)

One of my favorite artists on all time. This girl rocks! If you like Dream Pop (or even if you don't) she's a must listen.

[[Rock] Singer/Songwriter Gingee - The Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gF7vgqCtys)

The singer's voice is captivating. I can't help but get chills whenever I hear this song.

[[Rock] Stellarjet - Guiding Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EORGbefYcEU)

One of the rare SK songs that is 100% in English. Great build-up to the chorus.

[[Rock] Phonebooth - The End of the Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foDiRbA7Bfk)

Really different sound from other Korean rock songs due to the guitars and bass playing continuously in the background rather than sticking out.

[[Hip Hop] Black Nut - 100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2KmhMmqj_A)

Hilarious diss track where Black Nut calls out 100 Korean rappers. Video has English subtitles.

[[Rap] Outsider - Loner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yROjTblMPag)

Fastest rapper in Korea and possibly the world. Gets crazy at 1:47.

This series is pretty crazy but if you're into really rough and humiliating sex you'll love this. It's one of my favorites at the moment since everything seems so real (or at least more real than other JAV). Here's a quick rundown of some of the stuff you'll see:

* Deepthroating
* Spit ^((a lot of it)^)
* Facials / creampies
* Choking
* Forced orgasms
* Bondage
* Gym uniform, swimsuit, and schoolgirl outfit

Everything is shot in ""pseudo-POV"" (ie. Niimi looks at the camera a lot and the scene switches between being filmed by the male performer and a camera man).

Looks: 9/10 (she has a 'cute &amp; innocent' look)

1760,"IMO their last few songs pre- and post-hiatus were pretty bad and a lot of similar groups popped up during their hiatus, which lost them some western fans. They still do well on the charts in Korea, though. Their Matrix album sold better than any of their previous ones.

I think one of their major fuckups was going on hiatus after releasing [this shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsDlveRb3yA). Honestly, by looking at their sales it's insane to me that they aren't just promoting more rock/hip hop songs like Warrior and Young Wild And Free. I usually prefer their softer songs like Stop It and Feel So Good since I feel their harder songs have gotten really generic, but that's not what sells or what a lot of people became fans of them for.

I really want to like BAP again but I just haven't been a fan of any of their albums (bar a few singles here and there) since One Shot. It feels like they just phone in a lot of their 'album filler' nowadays.

**Otona No Dagashi**

&gt; Hotaru hatches the ultimate plan to get Kokonotsu to finally take over his father's store - marrying Kokonotsu! Doesn't make too much sense if you think about it, but who cares? 

&gt; Each chapter is filled with happy sex and one particularly hot scene where Hotaru gives Kokonotsu a blowjob from under his desk while an oblivious Tou is buying candy.

&gt; The ending is pretty cute/hilarious, but I don't want to spoil it!

&gt; **3 volumes, 84 pages**

**Dagashi Chichi**

&gt; In this one Hotaru and Kokonotsu fuck a lot, which makes Saya jealous. Eventually she gets some action, though. 

&gt; This is my least favorite out the three, but it's still pretty good since it uses scenes that occurred in the actual manga/anime.

&gt; Note: I edited out a 1.5 page flashback that Saya has of her and Kokonotsu playing doctor, but you can easily find it online if you search for it.

&gt; **3 volumes, 53 pages** 

**Sayashi Dashi**

&gt; This one is closer to the spirit of the show/manga imo. Hotaru, Saya, and Kokonotsu play a game of strip mahjong which ends with a threesome. It has some pretty funny reaction faces and Saya proves that she is best girl.

&gt; **1 volume, 22 pages**

1835,"&gt; Winning the league is hugely important, but surely continental competitions take the cake in terms of prestige??

No. [This 2014 article by Ken Matsushima outlines a few reasons](http://www.oneworldsports.com/blogs/how-afc-champions-league-can-improve/), namely the lack of finances which Asian clubs command compared to their European counterparts, the size of Asia compared to Europe, the poor officiating, etc. Generally clubs need to choose to do well in the Asian CL or do well in the J.League, and they almost always choose J.League. 

For example, here's Kashiwa Reysol's record from 2011-2015

Year|J.League|CL|
:--:|:--:|:--:
2011|1st|No
2012|6th|Round of 16
2013|10th|Semi-Finals|
2014|4th|No|
2015|10th|Quarter-Finals|

Reysol is probably the Japanese club that has cared the most about the CL in recent years, but as you can see they just couldn't perform well in J.League while they were attempting to go far in the Asian CL.

While J.League clubs continue throw their entire weight behind J.League campaigns, the fans won't consider the CL to be more prestigious. 

&gt; What do you think it would take for attitudes to change around this?

If Asian soccer starts growing financially and the Southeast Asian footballing nations that Japan is investing in come good, I can see more clubs being able to launch hardcore CL campaigns while challenging for J.League titles at the same time. IMO this would be the only way that the CL gains prestige.

&gt; Do the fans like ACL?

I do not know

&gt; If there was massive prize money on offer do you think this would change the view on it?

Perhaps, but Japanese clubs generally do not spend their money well imo. Their scouting needs to diversify since they seem to sign third-rate Brazilians way too much. Hopefully the recent influx of Eastern European talent starts to change that, tho.",2016-04-06 00:55:46+00:00,d1ri4ux,4.0,t1_d1rhj37,849.0,Aleague
1836,"I've only been watching since 2012 but I don't think the quality of the J.League has dropped. You just have to remember that **most J.League clubs do not give a fuck about the CL**. The J.League is thought of as being more prestigious than the CL and teams generally don't try very hard (unless you're Kashiwa Reysol or maybe Urawa Reds and Kawasaki Frontale). For example, Sanfrecce Hiroshima virtually never bring their most prolific striker (Hisato Sato) on away trips for CL matches in order to conserve his stamina for J.League.

Additionally, the Japanese aren't used to the rough playstyles and less whistle-happy refs that the CL has to offer, which could be considered a disadvantage. The players get roughed up much more frequently in CL (with seemingly random referee intervention), which effects how they go about executing plays and etc. ",2016-04-06 00:37:54+00:00,d1rhdmv,2.0,t1_d1rglae,1153.0,Aleague

* Deepthroating
* Spit ^((a lot of it)^)
* Facials / creampies
* Choking
* Forced orgasms
* Bondage
* Gym uniform, swimsuit, and schoolgirl outfit

Everything is shot in ""pseudo-POV"" (ie. Niimi looks at the camera a lot and the scene switches between being filmed by the male performer and a camera man).

Hypnosis is my favorite subgenre of JAV when it's done right, and this video definitely does it right. My favorite thing about these hypnotism videos is that even girls who are usually terrible/annoying performers are watchable in them since they don't need to be over-the-top or as 'active' as they would have to be in other types of videos ^((shout out to Yui Hatano)^). 

Anyway, the plot is basically Hirose gets hypnotized into becoming a submissive sex slave. She's a slightly older woman (35), so the people who made the ""mom/aunt"" requests on this subreddit should be happy with that!

Also, she squirts a lot. ^(a lot a lot)

I get that Asano needs some minutes, but Sato never seems too tired when he comes off + he's can play the poacher role nicely so he doesn't necessarily need to run around the entire time he's on the pitch.

&gt;  This is a really mellow and 'spacey' tune. The singer isn't the greatest but I think that just adds to the feel of the song.

So I guess the plot of this one is that Yui is staying in some creepy village where all the residents act nice during the daytime but wear masks and rape people at night? IDK!

Plot: 9/10

Sex: 7.5/10

Overall: 8.5/10

Yui isn't the greatest performer but the sex scenes are varied (bondage, GB, fucking her with a mask that has a long nose, etc) and that's good enough to warrant a watch.

1945,"&lt;Kodomo no Jikan&gt; - I wasn't expecting much when I started reading it, since I only knew about it due to how controversial it is, but by the time I completed it it had become one of my favorites. The cast of characters were great and the different topics it delved into (parenting, sexuality/puberty, growing as a teacher, etc) were very well written and engaging. It's also one of the only manga to make me recoil due to how uncomfortable/disgusted a panel/situation made me feel. 10/10

&lt;Bonnouji&gt; - Heard good things about it but after reading manga like Henjo, SE, Comic Studio, Imori 201, etc it just felt way too bland. 5/10

&lt;Natsu no Zenjitsu&gt; - I don't usually like (non-comedy) romance stories, but this one was fantastic. It's definitely one of my top 3 favorite manga. Everything about it is really realistic and compelling. 10/10

&lt;Nickelodeon&gt; - A really great set of short stories. I loved everything about this manga. 9/10

&lt;Voynich Hotel&gt; - Same author as Nickelodeon. The art was very unique, the characters were great, and the intertwining plots made it a really interesting read. One of the best manga I've read in a while! 10/10

&lt;Dorohedoro&gt; Chap 1-5 - I didn't really like the aesthetic so I had to drop it. Too ""Metro 2033"" looking for me. 

&lt;Attack on Titan&gt; Chap 50-Current - I loved the most recent chapters. I didn't really like when [](/s ""they were getting all political / fighting the establishment. This manga is best when they're fighting Titans"")

I think that everybody should give this manga a chance. The overarching themes of sexuality/puberty, parenting, dealing with traumatic experiences, and growing as a teacher/human are explored in a variety of ways and make for a very compelling read.",2016-03-26 16:55:12+00:00,d1eav7z,1.0,t3_4c1vxh,193.0,manga

2082,Kuroko's characters are so bland that I had a hard time caring about anything that was going on in the matches.

In contrast Kuroko is basically just a bunch of boring anime archetypes vs a few nobodies + a douchebag.,2016-03-12 22:37:53+00:00,d0xlamn,3.0,t1_d0xicrf,5264.0,anime

[White Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbHS1lspbQg) is one of my favorite KPop songs ever. The way his voice bounces from staccato notes to held notes (and low notes to near-falsetto) is really interesting to listen to and something I haven't really heard from anyone else. 

His sad tone shines in slow songs like [Next Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8_sRSizc0M) and upbeat songs like [The Feelings Painted in the Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcdbJBRzgvo). It brings a really interesting dynamic to an otherwise 'cliche' (ie. overdone) style. While Seungri is definitely not the best singer in KPop, I think he really knows how to use his voice in his solo songs (and GD knows how to use his voice in BIGBANG songs) in order to make a big impact. 

Also, I'm really disappointed that he keeps performing Strong Baby after all of these years. That song does not show off his vocals and imo is one of his worst songs. I wish he would do VVIP or Gotta Talk To You instead since both of them can pump up the crowd (especially if the instrumental of VVIP is remixed to fit a 'club' setting) and are more recent / interesting than Strong Baby.

2227,"This is a parody hentai of the popular [One-Punch Man](http://myanimelist.net/manga/44347/One_Punch-Man) manga. 

**Vol. 1** - Vanilla and pretty funny. Fubuki goes to Saitama's house and ends up riding Saitama while he's asleep. He ends up waking up in the middle of it but has sex with Fubuki after she convinces him that he's dreaming. [Preview Image. It's so dumb but it made me chuckle.](http://imgur.com/YEeXWAd)

**Vol. 2** - A hypnotist evil-doer turns all of Fubuki's henchmen against her, and they proceed to rape her until she starts to become mindbroken. In case you couldn't tell, this chapter isn't funny at all. You should probably give it a pass if you hate that sort of thing.

**Vol. 3** - Continuation of Vol. 2 but this time Tatsumaki gets involved. **I haven't included this one** since Tatsumaki is apparently supposed to look really young within the OPM universe (she just looks petite to me, but whatever. Better safe than sorry). [Here are the last two pages of this volume, where everything turns out OK](http://imgur.com/a/IgbPR).

2264,"/r/ALeague is doing fine, but even they went through a *long* period of just one or two people making all of the posts in the subreddit before their subscribers started being more active. A lot of club subreddits die out because the one or two people making all the posts just stop doing it, which keeps other people from wanting to get involved.

My subreddit /r/JLeague is finally starting to see more subscriber involvement after 2-3 years of just me and a couple other people making all the posts. In contrast, I made /r/KLeague at a similar time but atm it's basically dead since most of the regular posters left 6+ months ago.

Other fairly active league subs are:

* /r/DanishSuperliga
* /r/bundesliga (Kind of. They should be *much* more active considering they have over 100k subs. I think they're a default for Germans)
* /r/Calcio
* /r/ScottishFootball
* /r/LeagueOfIreland

2426,"##**J.League and Japanese Soccer History**

###Before J.League

The inception of the J.League and the league that preceded it can be linked to Dettmar Cramer, a German who is considered to be the father of modern football in Japan.

In 1960 the Japan FA appointed Dettmar Cramer as head coach of the National Team in order to strengthen the team ahead of the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games. With the help of Cramer the Japanese team would upset Argentina 3-2 and, even though it was their only win in the tournament, Cramer saw the win as confirmation that Japanese soccer was improving. Shortly after this historic victory he helped to formulate and implement policies for the general development of football in Japan, which sparked a new era of Japanese soccer. In 1969 he returned to host the first FIFA Coaching Course in Japan, which laid the foundation for a coach training structure in the country.

He would later coach West Germany to the final of the 1966 World Cup, Bayern Munich to back-to-back European Champions Cups (1975, 1976), and be inducted into the Japan Football Hall of Fame in 2005.

A moment of silence was held at all J.League matches last year after he passed away at age 90.

### The Japan Soccer League (1965-1992)

Founded in 1965, the Japan Soccer League was the first national league of an amateur sport in Japan, and the second national league of a team sport in Japan (after the professional Japan Baseball League, which was founded in 1936). Each team in the league represented a corporation and went by the name of the company that owned them (eg. Mitsubishi Motors) rather than by a 'normal' club name. All of the players in the league were officially amateurs and employees of the company that owned the team, though in the years leading up to the creation of the professional J.League, top players were generally paid strictly to play soccer.

The Japan Soccer League began with 8 clubs in 1965, added a second division in the year 1972, and by 1992 boasted a total of 28 clubs across the two division (12 in Division 1 and 16 in Division 2).

The Japan Soccer League played its final season in 1991/92 after club owners met and agreed to disband the JSL in order to reorganize it as a professional league. The key reasons for this reorganization were the Japan Football Association wanting to raise the level of play in the country, attract more fans, and strengthen the national team (which at this point had never qualified for the World Cup).

###The J.League is Born (1992)

The J.League was founded in 1992, and was the first fully professional soccer league in Japan. 

In its 1993 inaugural season, the J.League consisted of 10 clubs: the top 9 from the final season of the JSL and one new club, Shimizu S-Pulse. The other clubs that participated in the former JSL joined the new Japan Football League (amateur second division of the soccer pyramid). 

The league followed a split-season format, where each club would play 18 matches in two 'stages', with the winners of each stage meeting at the end of the season to decide who was the overall champion of the league. These final two matches were known as the [J.League Championship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._League_Championship) (Suntory Championship for sponsorship purposes).

During this period Kazuyoshi Miura, a young striker who left for Brazil in 1982 at the age of 15 to start his career, would become a superstar. Today, at age 48, he is still playing professionally with Yokohama FC in J.League 2.

###The 100 Year Vision (1999)

After a 'boom' in 1993, 1994, and 1995, where average attendances in the J.League were 18,533, 19,982, and 17,404 respectively, league attendances took a massive nosedive in 1996. To give you a glimpse of how sharp this decline was, the league attendance in 1997 was a measly 10,131. 

In 1999 the league, after realizing that they were heading in the wrong direction, came up with two solutions to the problem. The first of these solutions was the ""[J.League One-Hundred Year Vision](http://www.japantoday.com/category/executive-impact/view/j-league-looks-ahead-with-100-year-vision)"", a plan to have 100 professional soccer clubs in Japan by 2092, the league's 100th season.

A big part of this vision is simply to create ""a happier nation through sport"". The J.League encourages its clubs to promote sports and health activities, obtain local sponsorship, and create a bond with their respective cities and towns in a myriad of other ways.

Currently the J.League is made up of 53 fully professional clubs and 3 U-22 teams across 3 divisions - a huge increase from the 17 clubs it had in 1998. 

###The Beginning of Promotion/Relegation (1999)

In addition to the announcement of the 100 Year Vision, in 1999 the infrastructure of the J.League was heavily changed. 9 clubs from the semi-professional Japan Football League and 1 from the 17 club strong J.League were placed into a new fully professional Division 2. Finally, a promotion/relegation system between the two leagues was incorporated into the league system. 

Eventually the first division would grow to 18 members and the second division to 22, with 3 clubs from each league getting promoted/relegated each season. The J.League was expanding, and now that the J2.League had reached its capacity, rumors of a professional third tier were beginning to surface.

###Introduction of J3.League (2014)

Since the creation of the fully professional Japanese 2nd division (J2.League) in 1999, the Japan Football League had been the semi-professional 3rd division of Japanese soccer. The league started with 9 clubs in its inaugural season and, in the years that followed, expanded and contracted before stabilizing at 18 clubs in 2006. In 2012 and 2013 the top 2 clubs in the JFL had the ability to gain promotion to the J2.League as long as they were [J.League Associate Members](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._League_Associate_Membership), though promotion/relegation had occurred between the JFL and J2.League in varying capacities prior to that point.

In 2013 it was announced that a fully professional 3rd Division, the J3.League, would launch in 2014 with 12 clubs. These clubs were:

^(The previous league of the club is in parentheses)

* Gainare Tottori (relegated from 2013 J. League Division 2)
* Blaublitz Akita (Japan Football League)
* Machida Zelvia (JFL)
* SC Sagamihara (JFL)
* Nagano Parceiro (JFL)
* Zweigen Kanazawa (JFL)
* YSCC (JFL)
* FC Ryukyu (JFL)
* Fukushima United (JFL)
* Fujieda MYFC (JFL)
* Grulla Morioka (Tōhoku League, 2013 Tōhoku League Champion and Regional Promotion Series Champion)
* J. League U-22 team, composed of the best J1 and J2 youngsters in order to prepare them for the 2016 Olympics. This team was folded by the JFA following the 2015 season.

^(The J.League U-22 team was made up of players who were 22 or younger and *were not* in the matchday squads of their J1 and J2 clubs, and thus had a rotating roster)

The J3.League does not have any relegation to the Japan Football League (4th tier) planned in the foreseeable future, though promotion from the JFL to J3.League can occur.

For the 2016 season, 4 clubs have joined the J.League and will be participating in J3.League. These clubs are:

* Kagoshima United (Promoted from Japan Football League)
* Cerezo Osaka U-23 (Ineligible for Promotion to J2)
* Gamba Osaka U-23 (Ineligible for Promotion to J2)
* FC Tokyo U-23 (Ineligible for Promotion to J2)

2427,"##**League format, '100 Year Plan' status, and national and international tournaments**

###Current League Format

Currently, J1.League is contested between 18 clubs, J2.League between 22 clubs, and J3.League between 16 clubs. This brings the J.League to a grand total of 56 clubs across 3 divisions. There is a promotion / relegation system in place throughout the league pyramid.

**Two Stage System**

In 2015 J1.League began using a two-stage ""mini-league"" system which culminates in a Championship Stage.

This is how qualification for the Championship Stage works:

* The winner of each stage earn a home berth in the first round of the playoffs. Whichever one of these has the most points in the overall league table is the top seed and will play all of their playoff matches at home.
* The teams with the second-most and third-most points over the entire season also qualify for the playoffs, bringing the total to 4 clubs.
* The stage winner with the most points plays against the third-place finisher and the stage winner with fewer points plays the second-place finisher.
* When the playoffs are complete the winner will face the team with the most points over the entire year in a home-and-away Championship Series.

Here is a visual of the playoff system:

     1st Stage Winner vs 3rd Place Overall 
                                          &gt; Winner 1 vs Winner 2 ------
     2nd Stage Winner vs 2nd Place Overall 
                                                                       &gt;  Home and Away Championship Series                  
     1st Overall ------------------------------------------------------



As you can probably tell, there is a chance that some teams may qualify in more than one way, at which point the playoffs will be shortened accordingly. For example:

* If the First Stage Champion also has the most points over the full season, they qualify directly for the Championship Series (they do not participate in the playoffs)
* In the above example, the Second Stage Champion would play against the full-season third-place finisher, and the winner of that match would face the full-season second-place team.
*  If the Second Stage Champion also compiled the second- or third-most points over the full season, there would only be one other team in position to qualify for the playoffs. In that case, only one playoff match would be needed. 
* In practice, the playoffs may often involve just three teams, with one playoff match (between the second and third point-getters) followed by a home-and-away Championship Series. [This is exactly what happened in 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_J1_League#Championship_stage)

The above explanation about the format of the Playoffs is taken directly from [this article by Ken Matsushima](http://www.oneworldsports.com/stories/japanese-football-gets-new-format).

**Asian Champions League Qualification**

For 2016 Japan has been allocated 3+1 spot in the Champions League group stage, which they distribute across their tournaments like so:

* The Champion and Runners-up in the J.League automatically qualify
* The [Emperor's Cup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Emperor%27s_Cup) Champion automatically qualifies
* The 3rd place finisher overall in the J.League gains entry to the Champions League qualifying playoff

The J.League clubs participating in the 2016 Asian Champions League are Sanfrecce Hiroshima, Gamba Osaka, Urawa Reds, and FC Tokyo (Qualified via CL Qualifying Playoff - Defeated Chonburi FC 9 - 0).

**Relegation in J.League Division 1**

At the end of each season the bottom 3 clubs on the overall table are relegated to Division 2. In 2015 these clubs were Matsumoto Yamaga, Shimizu S-Pulse, and Montedio Yamagata.

**Promotion in J.League Division 2**

The top two clubs in J2 are automatically promoted to J1 at the end of the season. The clubs that finish 3rd - 6th in the league participate in the ""Promotion Playoffs"", a single elimination tournament where the winner receives the final promotion spot. The tournament is structured like this:

    3rd v 6th 
               &gt; Winner 1 vs Winner 2
    4th v 5th

In 2015 the clubs that gained promotion to J1 were Omiya Ardija, Jubilo Iwata, and Avispa Fukuoka (via the Promotion Playoffs). 

**Relegation in J2 and Promotion in J3**

The bottom club in J2 is automatically relegated to the third division in exchange for the winner of J3.League. However, the second bottom club in J2 and Runners-Up in J3 play each other in a 'Promotion Playoff', a one-off match which determines if the J2 club remains in that division or gets relegated.

**Relegation in J3**

There will be no relegation from J3.League in the foreseeable future.

**Promotion in the Japan Football League**

The Japan Football League is the 4th tier of Japanese soccer and, while no clubs from J3 can be relegated, clubs from the JFL can be promoted if they meet certain criteria. Read more about that criteria in the next section.

###**J.League 100 Year Plan Status**

The J.League 100 Year Plan Status is a status given to Japanese non-league clubs that have the intention of entering becoming a professional club and joining the professional leagues at some point in the future. This system allows the J.League to identify clubs in order to give them advice, resources, and to ease the transition into professionalism. 

In order to achieve this status, clubs that apply must meet a number of criteria, which include:

^(I have only included some of the criteria. There are more that I have not listed)

* Must be organized as a public corporation or NPO solely devoted to football and exist in this status for no less than one year
* Must employ at least four administrative employees, one of whom must have managerial position
* Must have proper financial management and conduct annual tax audit
* Home stadium must be located in the proposed hometown
* Must secure training facilities within the proposed hometown
* Must secure training facilities in hometown
* Must currently play in Japan Football League (4th tier), Regional League, or Prefectural League
* Must aim for eventual admission to J. League
* Must have a working soccer school/youth system that exists for no less than one year

To gain promotion to J3.League, clubs must meet the following criteria:

* Must hold a 100 Year Plan status
* Must have a stadium that complies with J3 standards (capacity 5,000 or above) and passes the league examination
* Must pass a J3 licensing examination by the league
* Must finish within top 4 of JFL, and either 1st or 2nd among other 100 Year Plan holders
* Must have average attendance of home games no less than 2,000 spectators, with significant effort demonstrated to reach 3,000
* Must have annual revenue of at least ¥150 million (~$1,250,000), and no excessive debt

As of the submission of this post there are 5 clubs that hold 100 Year Plan Status.

###**Domestic Tournaments**

Japan has three major tournaments that take place each season. I have listed them in order of importance.

**Emperor's Cup (Est. in 1921)**

The longest running soccer tournament in Japan, this Cup is contested over 7 Rounds and includes 88 clubs from across Japan. The winner of the cup gains entry into the AFC Champions League.

[Click here for information on last year's Emperor's Cup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Emperor's_Cup), which Gamba Osaka won for the second year in a row.

**J. League Cup (Est. in 1992)**

The J.League Cup (Yamazaki Nabisco Cup for sponsorship purposes) is the Japanese equivalent of the Football League Cup in England, though it is currently only contested between clubs in the first division. The winner of the Cup qualifies for the Suruga Bank Championship, an annual intercontinental match against the winner of the Copa Sudamericana.

[Click here for details](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._League_Cup)

**Japanese Super Cup (Est. in 1994)**

This Cup is a one-off match contested between the winner of the Emperor's Cup and the winner of J.League Division 1. It is played in February before the J.League begins.

This year the Cup was played between Emperor's Cup winners Gamba Osaka and J.League Division 1 winners Sanfrecce Hiroshima.",2016-02-19 21:57:50+00:00,d06dowt,1.0,t3_46n1qx,21.0,soccer

###Current League Format

Currently, J1.League is contested between 18 clubs, J2.League between 22 clubs, and J3.League between 16 clubs. This brings the J.League to a grand total of 56 clubs across 3 divisions. There is a promotion / relegation system in place throughout the league pyramid.

* The stage winner with the most points plays against the third-place finisher and the stage winner with fewer points plays the second-place finisher.
* When the playoffs are complete the winner will face the team with the most points over the entire year in a home-and-away Championship Series.

Here is a visual of the playoff system:

     1st Stage Winner vs 3rd Place Overall

The top two clubs in J2 are automatically promoted to J1 at the end of the season. The clubs that finish 3rd - 6th in the league participate in the ""Promotion Playoffs"", a single elimination tournament where the winner receives the final promotion spot. The tournament is structured like this:

    3rd v 6th 
               &gt; Winner 1 vs Winner 2
    4th v 5th

In 2015 the clubs that gained promotion to J1 were Omiya Ardija, Jubilo Iwata, and Avispa Fukuoka (via the Promotion Playoffs). 

**Relegation in J2 and Promotion in J3**

The bottom club in J2 is automatically relegated to the third division in exchange for the winner of J3.League. However, the second bottom club in J2 and Runners-Up in J3 play each other in a 'Promotion Playoff', a one-off match which determines if the J2 club remains in that division or gets relegated.

**Relegation in J3**

There will be no relegation from J3.League in the foreseeable future.

**Promotion in the Japan Football League**

The Japan Football League is the 4th tier of Japanese soccer and, while no clubs from J3 can be relegated, clubs from the JFL can be promoted if they meet certain criteria. Read more about that criteria in the next section.

###**J.League 100 Year Plan Status**

The J.League 100 Year Plan Status is a status given to Japanese non-league clubs that have the intention of entering becoming a professional club and joining the professional leagues at some point in the future. This system allows the J.League to identify clubs in order to give them advice, resources, and to ease the transition into professionalism. 

In order to achieve this status, clubs that apply must meet a number of criteria, which include:

^(I have only included some of the criteria. There are more that I have not listed)

* Must be organized as a public corporation or NPO solely devoted to football and exist in this status for no less than one year
* Must employ at least four administrative employees, one of whom must have managerial position
* Must have proper financial management and conduct annual tax audit
* Home stadium must be located in the proposed hometown
* Must secure training facilities within the proposed hometown
* Must secure training facilities in hometown
* Must currently play in Japan Football League (4th tier), Regional League, or Prefectural League
* Must aim for eventual admission to J. League
* Must have a working soccer school/youth system that exists for no less than one year

To gain promotion to J3.League, clubs must meet the following criteria:

* Must hold a 100 Year Plan status
* Must have a stadium that complies with J3 standards (capacity 5,000 or above) and passes the league examination
* Must pass a J3 licensing examination by the league
* Must finish within top 4 of JFL, and either 1st or 2nd among other 100 Year Plan holders
* Must have average attendance of home games no less than 2,000 spectators, with significant effort demonstrated to reach 3,000
* Must have annual revenue of at least ¥150 million (~$1,250,000), and no excessive debt

As of the submission of this post there are 5 clubs that hold 100 Year Plan Status.

###**Domestic Tournaments**

Japan has three major tournaments that take place each season. I have listed them in order of importance.

**Emperor's Cup (Est. in 1921)**

The longest running soccer tournament in Japan, this Cup is contested over 7 Rounds and includes 88 clubs from across Japan. The winner of the cup gains entry into the AFC Champions League.

[Click here for information on last year's Emperor's Cup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Emperor's_Cup), which Gamba Osaka won for the second year in a row.

**J. League Cup (Est. in 1992)**

The J.League Cup (Yamazaki Nabisco Cup for sponsorship purposes) is the Japanese equivalent of the Football League Cup in England, though it is currently only contested between clubs in the first division. The winner of the Cup qualifies for the Suruga Bank Championship, an annual intercontinental match against the winner of the Copa Sudamericana.

[Click here for details](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._League_Cup)

**Japanese Super Cup (Est. in 1994)**

This Cup is a one-off match contested between the winner of the Emperor's Cup and the winner of J.League Division 1. It is played in February before the J.League begins.

This year the Cup was played between Emperor's Cup winners Gamba Osaka and J.League Division 1 winners Sanfrecce Hiroshima.",2016-02-16 19:54:12+00:00,d029nb5,1.0,t3_42zqb6,1723073.0,JLeagueTest

**Plot (from myanimelist.com):**

Meet Sayoko — better known as Slut Girl — a drop-dead beauty that knows what she wants and has the attitude to get it. By sheer chance she meets her benefactor/boyfriend, Satoru, and this is where the hilarity begins. Satoru is the biggest little mealy-mouthed pushover on the planet and Slut Girl takes full advantage of her raging sexuality to use her boyfriend for living space and money.

Slut Girl is one of my favorite manga (including non-H manga) and is generally considered to be one of the funniest, if not *the* funniest, H-manga. It's [well drawn](http://imgur.com/fYgcGoc), has great character interactions, and the female lead actually has a personality!

Even if you don't usually read manga you should definitely check this one out. It's genuinely fantastic!

2484,"##**J.League and Japanese Soccer History**

###Before J.League

The inception of the J.League and the league that preceded it can be linked to Dettmar Cramer, a German who is considered to be the father of modern football in Japan.

In 1960 the Japan FA appointed Dettmar Cramer as head coach of the National Team in order to strengthen the team ahead of the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games. With the help of Cramer the Japanese team would upset Argentina 3-2 and, even though it was their only win in the tournament, Cramer saw the win as confirmation that Japanese soccer was improving. Shortly after this historic victory he helped to formulate and implement policies for the general development of football in Japan, which sparked a new era of Japanese soccer. In 1969 he returned to host the first FIFA Coaching Course in Japan, which laid the foundation for a coach training structure in the country.

He would later coach West Germany to the final of the 1966 World Cup, Bayern Munich to back-to-back European Champions Cups (1975, 1976), and be inducted into the Japan Football Hall of Fame in 2005.

A moment of silence was held at all J.League matches last year after he passed away at age 90.

### The Japan Soccer League (1965-1992)

Founded in 1965, the Japan Soccer League was the first national league of an amateur sport in Japan, and the second national league of a team sport in Japan (after the professional Japan Baseball League, which was founded in 1936). Each team in the league represented a corporation and went by the name of the company that owned them (eg. Mitsubishi Motors) rather than by a 'normal' club name. All of the players in the league were officially amateurs and employees of the company that owned the team, though in the years leading up to the creation of the professional J.League, top players were generally paid strictly to play soccer.

The Japan Soccer League began with 8 clubs in 1965, added a second division in the year 1972, and by 1992 boasted a total of 28 clubs across the two division (12 in Division 1 and 16 in Division 2).

The Japan Soccer League played its final season in 1991/92 after club owners met and agreed to disband the JSL in order to reorganize it as a professional league. The key reasons for this reorganization were the Japan Football Association wanting to raise the level of play in the country, attract more fans, and strengthen the national team (which at this point had never qualified for the World Cup).

###The J.League is Born (1992)

The J.League was founded in 1992, and was the first fully professional soccer league in Japan. 

In its 1993 inaugural season, the J.League consisted of 10 clubs: the top 9 from the final season of the JSL and one new club, Shimizu S-Pulse. The other clubs that participated in the former JSL joined the new Japan Football League (amateur second division of the soccer pyramid). 

The league followed a split-season format, where each club would play 18 matches in two 'stages', with the winners of each stage meeting at the end of the season to decide who was the overall champion of the league. These final two matches were known as the [J.League Championship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._League_Championship) (Suntory Championship for sponsorship purposes).

During this period Kazuyoshi Miura, a young striker who left for Brazil in 1982 at the age of 15 to start his career, would become a superstar. Today, at age 48, he is still playing professionally with Yokohama FC in J.League 2.

###The 100 Year Vision (1999)

After a 'boom' in 1993, 1994, and 1995, where average attendances in the J.League were 18,533, 19,982, and 17,404 respectively, league attendances took a massive nosedive in 1996. To give you a glimpse of how sharp this decline, the league attendance in 1997 was a measly 10,131. 

In 1999 the league, after realizing that they were heading in the wrong direction, came up with two solutions to the problem. The first of these solutions was the ""[J.League One-Hundred Year Vision](http://www.japantoday.com/category/executive-impact/view/j-league-looks-ahead-with-100-year-vision)"", a plan to have 100 professional soccer clubs in Japan by 2092, the league's 100th season.

A big part of this vision is simply to create ""a happier nation through sport"". The J.League encourages its clubs to promote sports and health activities, obtain local sponsorship, and create a bond with their respective cities and towns in a myriad of other ways.

Currently the J.League is made up of 53 fully professional clubs and 3 U-22 teams across 3 divisions - a huge increase from the 17 clubs it had in 1998. 

###The Beginning of Promotion/Relegation (1999)

In addition to the announcement of the 100 Year Vision, in 1999 the infrastructure of the J.League was heavily changed. 9 clubs from the semi-professional Japan Football League and 1 from the 17 club strong J.League were placed into a new fully professional Division 2. Finally, a promotion/relegation system between the two leagues was incorporated into the league system. 

Eventually the first division would grow to 18 members and the second division to 22, with 3 clubs from each league getting promoted/relegated each season. The J.League was expanding, and now that the J2.League had reached its capacity, rumors of a professional third tier were beginning to surface.

###Introduction of J3.League (2014)

Since the creation of the fully professional Japanese 2nd division (J2.League) in 1999, the Japan Football League had been the semi-professional 3rd division of Japanese soccer. The league started with 9 clubs in its inaugural season and, in the years that followed, expanded and contracted before stabilizing at 18 clubs in 2006. In 2012 and 2013 the top 2 clubs in the JFL had the ability to gain promotion to the J2.League as long as they were [J.League Associate Members](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._League_Associate_Membership), though promotion/relegation had occurred between the JFL and J2.League in varying capacities prior to that point.

In 2013 it was announced that a fully professional 3rd Division, the J3.League, would launch in 2014 with 12 clubs. These clubs were:

^(The previous league of the club is in parentheses)

* Gainare Tottori (relegated from 2013 J. League Division 2)
* Blaublitz Akita (Japan Football League)
* Machida Zelvia (JFL)
* SC Sagamihara (JFL)
* Nagano Parceiro (JFL)
* Zweigen Kanazawa (JFL)
* YSCC (JFL)
* FC Ryukyu (JFL)
* Fukushima United (JFL)
* Fujieda MYFC (JFL)
* Grulla Morioka (Tōhoku League, 2013 Tōhoku League Champion and Regional Promotion Series Champion)
* J. League U-22 team, composed of the best J1 and J2 youngsters in order to prepare them for the 2016 Olympics. This team was folded by the JFA following the 2015 season.

^ (The J.League U-22 team was made up of players who were 22 or younger and *were not* in the matchday squads of their J1 and J2 clubs, and thus had a rotating roster)

The J3.League does not have any relegation to the Japan Football League (4th tier) planned in the foreseeable future, though promotion from the JFL to J3.League can occur.

For the 2016 season, 4 clubs have joined the J.League and will be participating in J3.League. These clubs are:

* Kagoshima United (Promoted from Japan Football League)
* Cerezo Osaka U-23 (Ineligible for Promotion to J2)
* Gamba Osaka U-23 (Ineligible for Promotion to J2)
* FC Tokyo U-23 (Ineligible for Promotion to J2)

**Plot**

Pretty simple. Julia is a teacher who gets blackmailed into letting her students gangbang her.

**Score**

*Female Looks:* 9/10

*Sex:* 4/10

*Overall: 6/10* 

**Summary**

Julia looks great (obviously) but, like in almost all of her movies, she pretty much just lays there and takes it during sex scenes. To be honest I'm pretty bored of her at this point but I thought I'd share this on here anyway since she seems to be so popular. If you're a fan of Julia you'll probably enjoy this movie, but don't expect anything amazing.

As an aside, I found another JAV performer named Yui Akane who [looks like a cross between Julia and some other performer](http://pics.dmm.co.jp/mono/movie/adult/118abs128/118abs128pl.jpg) (Yui Hatano maybe?) and is a hell of a lot more enthusiastic than Julia. She's a good alternative if you like Julia's body type but want to see somebody more... expressive.

The same characters are used in Chinese to refer to China, but pronounced Zhōngguó, lit. “Middle Kingdom” or “Middle Country” (Wade Giles: Chungkuo). It is similar to the use of the West Country in English for a region of England.

&gt; Primarily in the tourism industry, in order to avoid confusing the Chūgoku region with China, the Chūgoku region is also called the “San’in‐San’yō region”. San’in (“yīn of the mountains”) is the northern part facing the Sea of Japan. San’yō (“yáng of the mountains”) is the southern part facing the Seto Inland Sea. These names were created using the yīnyáng‐based place‐naming scheme.",2016-02-10 01:08:20+00:00,czu6q2a,2.0,t1_czu6kh0,223.0,soccer

**Plot Synopsis (from myanimelist.com):**

The fate of the world rests on one man's shoulders. Or, to put it more exactly, it rests on his balls. 

In a freak sealing accident the Queen of Terror is sealed into Satou Kohta's balls, thus preventing her from reigning destruction on the world. However a lesser devil, Elyse, has been sent up to Earth to release the Queen at all costs. The only way to do so is to make Kohta ejaculate, and Elyse only has 30 days to do it. The battle for mankind has begun—in Kohta's pants.

This manga is as hilarious as it is lewd (very). Since this is an ecchi manga all of the genitalia is censored, but [nothing is really left to the imagination](http://i.imgur.com/DQ9SxhC.png). 

I think this manga is a solid 8/10, so definitely check it out if you've got some time. I would share some more pages from the manga as a preview, but I don't want to ruin any of the story / jokes for you all.

2551,"&gt; I wonder if these guys will get their money in full as promised.

Chinese clubs are very good about paying their players on time and in full. The only reason this ""Chinese clubs don't pay their players"" nonsense is going around is because of what happened at Shanghai Shenhua with Drogba and Anelka.

Basically:

&gt; After a disappointing 2011 season in the Chinese Super League, Zhu Jun decided to bring in a marquee player, so on 12 December 2011 it was confirmed that Chelsea striker Nicolas Anelka will be arriving in Shanghai in January 2012, while six days later it was announced that his compatriot Jean Tigana would be the head coach from the 2012 season. Tigana was fired after a poor string of results and was replaced by former Argentinian national team coach Sergio Batista to lead the team. After a successful season playing for Chelsea and winning the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League, Ivorian striker Didier Drogba signed a two-and-a-half-year deal with Shenhua.[19] This was soon followed by the signing of Colombian international footballer Giovanni Moreno from Argentinian club Racing Club. **These signings were intended to boost the clubs title challenge and see Zhu Jun's investment within the club reach 150 million Yuan, which he believed gave him a controlling stake of 70 per cent as promised by the other share-holders. When the other share-holders decided not to agree upon this arrangement Zhu Jun decided to pull his funding of the club**, which resulted in the team finishing in a disappointing ninth and both Anelka and Drogba leaving the club.[20] The relationship between Zhu Jun and the other share-holders became even more fractious at the beginning of the 2013 league season when the Chinese FA issued the club with a six-point deduction for match-fixing ten years prior and a fine of one million Yuan. This would lead to a share-holder dispute between the other shareholders SVA, Shanghai Media Group, Shanghai Electric Group and Huangpu SASAC on who should pay for this fine, which saw a gap in the club finances that saw Rolando Schiavi, Patricio Toranzo and Giovanni Moreno refuse to play the 31 March 2013 league game against Liaoning Whowin because of unpaid wages.[21]",2016-02-05 20:17:37+00:00,czp7omi,2.0,t1_czotwo4,20240.0,soccer

Swan Songs (released 2005) is the third album of South Korean hip-hop group Epik High, and was originally intended to be their last (hence the name). However, it was met with critical acclaim from critics and the general public alike upon its release, propelling Epik High to mainstream status. Mixing hip-hop with rock, jazz, and electronica, this album's tracklist is highly diverse, inventive, catchy, and a complete joy to listen to. Even today Epik High are huge in South Korea, and that's all thanks to this album.

2583,"This song is simply amazing. The instrumental has layers added to it throughout the song, eventually leading to an incredible climax which gives me chills every time I hear it. The vocals are also fantastic, with booming notes that 'fill your ears' occasionally being broken up by high notes which, due to the contrast, seem to pierce right through the middle of your head.

Other obscure Korean Indie songs from the past two months that I've liked:

* [Rock] [Fantastic Drugstore - Scarlet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p59AA1fNsPQ)

&gt; Smooth (and I mean smoooooooooooooooooooooooth) vocals coupled with an even smoother instrumental. What's not to like? You'll fall in love with this song as soon as you hear the falsetto in the chorus.

* [Rock] [Phonebooth - The End of the Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foDiRbA7Bfk)

&gt; Really interesting sound that I haven't heard from many other Korean rock bands. The drums and guitars keep it relatively low-key until the chorus hits, which gives the song a chill and 'spacey' vibe to it. It's a nice change of pace from other bands like [MAAN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5PDERBzkF4), [The Koxx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMZYdSh_GzU), [Startline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwn_pK3vvOA), and etc who tend to have their instruments stick out rather than stay in the background.


* [Dream Pop] [Swimmers - Woodstock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPBw7XC37XA)

&gt; Korean dream pop might be my favorite thing ever. Definitely check this out if you're a fan of [Yukari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGWKJtQgQEQ), because I get similar vibes from this band (though their sound is much less electronic than Yukari's).

&gt; Came out November 26, 2015, but I'm putting it on this list anyway! I've had this song playing in my car for the past couple of months and I don't see that changing any time soon.

* [Electronic] [Now &amp; Then - This Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BNm6-oYuX8)

&gt; This song is just... cool. Give it a listen.

* [RnB] [Big Brain - Break Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xpg-iWmyFM)

* *Move 3:* Flash Cannon
* *Move 4:* Thunderbolt

1. Lead with Mamoswine in order to set up stealth rock
2. Immediately switch in Magnezone in order to handle any steel types that are brought in to counter Mamoswine

###Key Players

**START HERE**

###**Team: [Kashima Antlers](http://www.so-net.ne.jp/antlers/)**

**[Crest](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/16/KashimaAntlers.png)**

**Founded:** 1947 (as Sumitomo Metals FC)

**Club Name Meaning:** Kashima literally means ""deer island"". Hence, ""Antlers"".

**Stadium:** [Kashima Soccer Stadium](http://www.stadiumguide.com/wp-content/gallery/kashimastadium/kashimastadium2.JPG); capacity 40,728; Kashima, Ibaraki Prefecture


**Manager:** [Toninho Cerezo](http://globoesporte.globo.com/platb/files/1094/2013/11/kashima_toninho-cerezo_2013_small1.jpg) (Since 2013)

**2014 Season Facts:**

* Final Record (W-D-L, Pts): 18-6-10, 60
* Position: 3rd
* Average Attendance: 17,665
* Highest Attendance: 32,099
* Lowest Attendance: 8,840
* Top Goalscorer: Davi &amp; Yasushi Endo (10 goals)
* J.League Cup: Group A (4th in group)
* Emperor's Cup: Second Round

###Key Players

**Gaku Shibasaki** (CM - 22 years old) 

Shibasaki featured in every league match in the 2014 season, scoring 6 goals and assisting 7. He has also earned 6 National Team caps since 2014, most recently coming off the bench vs Jordan and starting vs the UAE in the 2015 Asian Cup.

**Mu Kanazaki** (RW - 26 years old) 

After spells with German side Nuremberg and Portuguese side Portimonense, Kanazaki makes his return to the J.League this season. With 10 goals in 18 matches in the Segunda Liga this season, he could be a force to be reckoned with.

**Yasushi Endo** (RW - 26 years old) 

Joint top scorer in 2014 with a currently injured Davi, Endo will be looking to top that season in a big way.

---

###**Team: [Kashiwa Reysol](http://www.reysol.co.jp/)**

**[Crest](http://www.bettingexpert.com/assets/images/system/clash/team_logos/football/8699_Logo.png)**

**Founded:** 1940 (as Hitachi, Ltd. Soccer Club)

**Club Name Meaning:** Combination of the Spanish words “rey” (=king) and “sol” (=sun).

**Stadium:** [Hitachi Kashiwa Soccer Stadium](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Kashiwa20120311-1.JPG); capacity 15,900; Kashiwa, Chiba

* Top Goalscorer: Leandro (11 goals)
* J.League Cup: Semi-Finals

###Key Players

**Masato Kudo** (ST - 24 years old)

A major force on his day, Kudo experienced a relative slump in 2014 after scoring 19 goals in 33 matches in 2013 (and 6 goals in 12 matches in Reysol's Champions League campaign). If he can find his old form he'll be Kashiwa's key to success.

**Leandro** (ST - 30 years old)

Leandro was Kashiwa's top goalscorer in 2014 with 11 goals, and after scoring 2 goals versus Chonburi FC in Reysol's recent Champions League Qualification Match, he could be looking to repeat that feat.



---

###**Team: [Kawasaki Frontale](http://www.frontale.co.jp/)**

**Yoshito Ōkubo** (ST - 32 year) 

J.League's Top Scorer in 2013 and 2014, Okubo has been a pivotal part of Frontale's attacking force in recent years.  He'll be aiming for a third straight Top Scorer award this season.

**Kengo Nakamura** (CM - 34 years old)

A former Japan NT regular, Nakamura is a skilled passer who reached a tally of 14 assists last season. He was also Frontale's captain for most of their games in 2014.",2016-01-27 21:46:12+00:00,czed089,1.0,t3_42zqb6,1793.0,JLeagueTest

2640,"[Tesagure! Bukatsumono](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19919/Tesagure_Bukatsumono) is rated 6.61 but it's one of the funniest shows I've ever seen. [Here's my WT! for it](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3nqdzv/wt_tesagure_bukatsumono_a_metahumor_and_adlib/).

[Samurai Flamenco](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19365/Samurai_Flamenco) is rated 7.01 but I had a blast watching it. Never a dull episode.

[Kagewani](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30524/Kagewani) is rated 6.49 but imo it was one of the stand-out shows from last season. Every episode is really unsettling and the art is very unique. A must see if you like 'creepy horror' (rather than 'jump scare' horror).

[Hen Zemi OVA](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8101/Hen_Zemi) is rated 6.67 but I thought it was a cute show. It deals with different sexual fetishes and the MCs reactions to the actions of her perverted classmates. It also has a TV series (which came after the OVA) but imo the OVAs are better.

[Kyouu no Asuka Show](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15005/Kyou_no_Asuka_Show) is rated 6.88. It only has 20 3-minute episodes, so please check it out!

**Plot**

Basically the plot of this movie is that Aino Kishi is trying to rescue her kidnapped dad. The movie is split into three ""scenarios"" which play out almost like a videogame would, with Game Over screens at the end of failed scenarios and Reloading screens at the beginning of new scenarios. Each scenario starts the same way - with Aino entering a hideout (wearing a different outfit each time) - but immediately jumps to where the previous scenario would have left off if Aino hadn't failed.

In addition to a fairly unique plot (or at least a unique method of getting Aino into different situations), this movie hits loads of porn buzzwords:

* Leather Restraints
* Latex Jumpsuits
* Toys
* Bukkake
* Aphrodisiacs
* Threeway (bbg)
* Fucking with clothes on

**Score**

Female Looks: 8.5/10

Sex: 9.5/10

Plot/Acting: 9/10

Overall: 9.5/10

**Summary**

This movie is everything you could ask for if you're into rough sex, bondage, secret agent / police costumes, and petite girls. I usually don't like anything Aino Kishi does since she uses that sterotypical high pitched voice while she gets fucked, but the submissive role coupled with the subtitles just makes it kind of *work* in this movie.

**English subs are included**

FE:A was my first FE game and I thought it was pretty good. After I had put 20+ hours into it I started to wish that it allowed for more world / town exploration like Golden Sun, Pokemon, etc, though. From Chapter 17 onward I just blasted through the rest of the chapters instead of battling risen and etc since there weren't any puzzles or NPCs that were keeping me interested in the world. The battle system and support conversations were very interesting and totally new to me, but I just couldn't get into the story.

I just started Link Between Worlds today and I'm having a great time with it. The game has a great difficulty (not hard enough for me to want to quit playing, but not easy enough that I get bored of the combat), an interesting 'loan' system for weapons, and a lot of quirky and likeable characters. I was a little scared that I wouldn't like this game after playing Phantom Hourglass (which I didn't really enjoy), but so far I've been loving it!

Music videos were made for [Again](https://youtu.be/ImYB8RhW0Hg) and [Hide and Seek](https://youtu.be/oIdNdZwg768).

The main singer, [Kim Jong Kook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-kook_(singer), has a *really* unique singing voice which has jokingly been referred to as ""mosquito voice"" by a lot of Korean TV personalities. The rappers are alright as well, but what I like most about Turbo is their song diversity. Here are four examples:

2912,"&gt; ""Swansea struggled to score"". Then why play Ayew?

Because I never expect him to score anyway. 

&gt; Nyom is away at a revived Chelsea. I can't see him keeping a clean sheet. 

I don't expect him to. Might pick up an assist, though.

&gt; WBA vs Swansea can go either way and it would be possible to lose all CS and Ayew not to score.

Doubt it. Gomis is shit so Ayew has the best chance of scoring imo.  I also think it's almost impossible to play bench boost without having a defensive / offensive matchup within your squad.

&gt; It's hard to believe that from United vs Stoke you will get big points. 

United just lost to Norwich and Bournemoth, tho. Stoke might get one or two past them.

&gt; Coutinho and Liverpool overall play like shit.

While that's true, Leicester is a little leaky.

Anyway, I think that Matt is the most important member of Regular Features.

This allows (for example) Steve to do his occasional ""I didn't do a real feature this week but look at how adorable I am while I present this half-assed joke feature"" segments.

His features are also a lot more varied than the other hosts, who have all found certain niches (Log - Scripts, Gav - Enraging people on the internet, Steve - Abstract features).

Matt is the closest thing to a figurative straight man that the podcast has, and I think that without him adding some semblance of seriousness to the podcast I'd start to get annoyed with Steve and Log (sorry guys) doing voices and going off on tangents all the time.

{Saraiya Goyou} - One of the best written shows I have ever seen. Super underrated.

{Mawaru Penguindrum} - This is exactly what you are looking for.

{Gosick} - Gets kind of slow at points, but when this show is good it's *very* good. Plus Victorique is awesome.

{Great Teacher Onizuka} - While this show is a comedy, its serious moments are incredibly well done. In my opinion Onizuka-sensei is the greatest character in anime.

Some other examples:

* Blaublitz Akita - Blau and blitz mean “blue” and “lightning” in German respectively
* Montedio Yamagata - Montedio is a coined word combining two Italian words Monte (=Mountain) and Dio (=God)
* Sanfrecce Hiroshima - The club name is a combination of the Japanese numeral for three (“san”) and an Italian word 
“frecce” (“arrows”). This is based on the story of Mori Motonari, a prominent landlord of the 
16th century, who told his three sons that while a single arrow might be easily snapped, three 
arrows held together would not be broken, and urged them to work for the good of the clan and

Clubs need to obtain [100 Year Plan Status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.League_100_Year_Plan_club_status) and meet the following criteria before being promoted from the Japan Football League to J.League 3:

* Must hold a 100 Year Plan status
* Must have a stadium that complies with J3 standards (capacity 5,000 or above) and passes the league examination
* Must pass a J3 licensing examination by the league
* Must finish within top 4 of JFL, and either 1st or 2nd among other 100 Year Plan holders
* Must have average attendance of home games no less than 2,000 spectators, with significant effort demonstrated to reach 3,000
* Must have annual revenue of at least ¥150 million, and no excessive debt

So as you can see the J.League's expansion is more of a 'when' question rather than an 'if'.

Currently 5 clubs in the JFL and Regional Leagues hold 100 Year Plan Status, and 2 more have applications pending, so you should expect to see at least a few more clubs join the J.League in the next 5-10 years.",2015-11-23 19:40:31+00:00,cxagz4o,4.0,t1_cxagl0e,546.0,soccer

1st Stage - 17 matches, winner qualifies for Final Series

2nd Stage - 17 matches, winner qualifies for Final Series

Then the top 3 on the overall league table gain entry into the Final Series, and the club that finished 1st skips all of the playoffs and waits for another club to meet them in them in the Championship Match.

So, hypothetically, if none of the stage winners were in the top 3 in the overall league table at the end of the season, this is what the Final Series would look like:

3368,"Here are some of my favorites:

**[House of Five Leaves](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7588/Saraiya_Goyou) (Rank: 1266)** - Personal Score: 10/10 - RIP Manglobe - This show has some of the best writing I have ever seen in an anime. The characters are believable and the [OST is great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNXNqLszLY4)

**[Tesagure! Bukatsumono](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19919/Tesagure!_Bukatsumono) (Ranking: 3461)** - Personal Score: 9/10 - Absolute *hilarious*, especially if you like ad-libbing. [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-5n4EVsmmo)

**[Initial D Fourth Stage](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18/Initial_D_Fourth_Stage) (Ranking: 1234)** - Personal Score: 8/10 - I recently finished this season and imo it's   just as good (if not better) than Season 1. It gets rid of a lot of the romance bullshit and focuses more on racing.

**[One Outs](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5040/One_Outs) (Ranking: 696)** - Personal Score: 8/10 - If you have already seen this show but haven't read the manga, you really should! I recently finished it and had a blast the entire time. 

**[Kyou no Asuka Show](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15005/Kyou_no_Asuka_Show) (Ranking: 2478)** - Personal Score: 7/10 - Cute ecchi show with 3 minute episodes. I really love this show because Asuka is a strong female lead and both her and her experiences are realistic and relate-able. 

**[Shura no Toki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/340/Mutsu_Enmei_Ryuu_Gaiden:_Shura_no_Toki) (Ranking: 2292)** - Personal Score: 5/10 - Do not be turned off by my personal score. This show is a *must see* if you like period pieces. A huge amount of legendary samurai from Japanese history make appearances (eg. Musashi Miyamoto, Jubei Yagyu, etc). I ended up giving it a 5/10 because the third arc (which is almost as long as the first and second arcs combined) is downright *dull* in the middle, but the show is very enjoyable overall. The MCs (there are 3 of them and they are all part of the same bloodline in different eras) are really likeable and the action and dialogue are good. The only downside is that the women in the show are basically marriage-fodder for the MCs and part of the 3rd arc is boring (which I mentioned before). Also, the [art changes](http://imgur.com/a/lzY3I) for some reason in the final 3 episodes, which was weird but actually made the show faster paced and the action scenes even better than before. Anyway, I realize that I am rambling but basically I think this show is worth a watch even though it has its shortcomings.

**[Bartender](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1589/Bartender) (Ranking: 1131)** - I haven't finished it yet since I pretty much only watch it when I want to relax, but I've had a great time so far.

3384,"**Kuroko no Basket 20-24/25** - I think it was a mistake watching this immediately after finishing Haikyuu!! The plots of the shows are very similar but the characters in KnB just seem lifeless in comparison to Haikyuu!! Additionally, the show was painfully dull for ~8 episodes in the middle and only started getting enjoyable again at episode 23. 6/10 so far.

**Kaiji S2 10-26/26** - I watched the entirety of the [](/s ""Pachinko"") arc after putting the show on hold for a few months. While I did find the show enjoyable, I thought that it was not as good as S1 due to [](/s ""the games being games of chance rather than games of skill""). 7/10

**Bartender 3/11** - This show is really relaxing! 

**Initial D Fourth Stage 8-24/24** - Best stage since First Stage imo. The terrible romance subplots were given a lot less screen time than in previous seasons, which I was so happy to see. 8/10

**Shura no Toki 19-26/26** - I finally got around to finishing this series. While it could be boring at times, when this show was good it was *good*. Surprisingly, this show became a lot more enjoyable when the art style [inexplicably changed](http://imgur.com/a/lzY3I) in episode 24, which brought along with it more impressive fight scenes (though the overall quality of the art diminished). 5/10 - definitely give it a watch if you like Japanese history, because a lot of famous samurai are in this show

**Ben-to 10-12/12** - While I initially found this show to be funny, it got really old by episode 4 or 5. The final episodes were a bit of a slog to get through. 5/10

**Battle Programmer Shirase 7-15/15** - Each arc followed the same basic structure, but I enjoyed the MC and the reused jokes so much that it didn't bother me. The show didn't have much of a plot, though, and while I wasn't exactly bored watching it I didn't feel like I *had* to see what happened next. Each ep basically had 7 minutes of actual plot, though, so it didn't take too long to watch. 5/10

**Hellsing Ultimate 3/10** - The action is fantastic but it's a little off-putting when over the top comedy is inserted comedy into the middle of very tense moments. I think I'd prefer Hellsing if it stuck to dark comedy rather than comedy that completely shifts the tone of a scene.",2015-11-15 22:00:41+00:00,cx1cnai,1.0,t3_3sxvqc,1892.0,anime

* That ""IIIII AM JUST FEELING ALIIIIIVE"" at the beginning of the OP is so catchy. I never see anybody talk about this OP on /r/anime but I think it's one of the best from this season / year.
* Actually laughed out loud when the calmer half of the scary black man duo all of a sudden pulled a gun on that girl. I was not expecting that at all. And then things got stranger and stranger.
* Maiko: ""Hazama-kun, you're still just a student""; Hazama: ""*I just got back from goddamn 'nam don't ruin this for me you bitch*""
* I feel like giving Dr. Risenberg that huge nose is kind of offensive, but I don't know enough about Jewish stereotypes to say for sure
* I applaud this show for dealing with tough subjects, but I really don't like how this storyline was handled. It was strange that the intro was about blacks and whites still not being equal on a social level but immediately afterward Johnny and the girl were attacked by other blacks. I think a better way for Johnny to get injured would have been by white racists during a black rally / march (or something similar), and *then* the more violence-focused members of the equality movement could have come into play.",2015-11-14 07:40:49+00:00,cwzrkhe,1.0,t3_3sr4qz,6026.0,anime

&lt;One Outs&gt; (reading) - I think the manga is even better than the anime. It's a 10/10 for me so far. I still have 24 chapters to read, though.

&lt;Henjo: Hen na Joshikousei Amaguri Chiko&gt; (reading) - This manga is HILARIOUS! The MC is awesome

&lt;One Punch-Man&gt; (reading) 

&lt;Golden Boy&gt; (reading) - It's ok. I think I prefer the OVA since the MC had a certain 'innocence' about him that I don't think is present in the manga.

&lt;Shokugeki no Souma&gt; (reading) - It's what I expected after watching the anime. Not spectacular but it's a fun read.

3500,"Due to the USA not having a good infrastructure for youth soccer, I think the amount and quality of grassroots program in Japan is relevant to what you asked. Better programs = better coaching and vice versa.

[Here's an article about Tom Byer, a man who revolutionized grassroots soccer in Japan and got tons of kids interested in the sport](http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/sports_nut/2013/02/tom_byer_the_man_who_made_japanese_soccer_a_player_on_the_world_football.html). 

&gt; Byer did not consolidate his coaching philosophy until 1993, when he opened his first soccer school, which has since expanded to 100 campuses with roughly 20,000 pupils nationwide. 

.

&gt; In 1998, Japanese broadcasters seized upon the upcoming World Cup as the perfect moment to begin promoting the 2002 tournament, which would be held in Japan for the first time ever. Executives at Tokyo TV and ShoPro, a production company, added a two-minute soccer spot to Oha Suta, the top-rated children’s morning show, and they asked Byer to host. Suddenly, instead of standing in front of a few hundred young soccer players a couple times a week, Byer was teaching his skills in a green screen studio, backed by animated stadiums and fans. From 3  million to 5 million children saw him every single day.

. 

&gt; Byer argues that his program is exportable to the United States. In some ways, in the U.S. it’d be easier to implement than in Japan: Soccer is already the No. 1 sport among American youth. The problem, according to Byer, is that the USSF and MLS “look at grass-roots football as an obligation, not an opportunity.” Why not put a small technique spot on the Disney Channel or Nick Jr.?  Kids would surely pay attention.

.

&gt; Some American kids are lucky, Byer points out, and get a coach who really knows soccer—“but you might get a coach who’s crap.” Parents, who typically coach the youngest American players, don’t realize kids as young as 5 are capable of learning advanced ball skills, and they don’t know how to teach them. “The whole idea [behind my program] was to be consistent and teach that technique work.”

Not entirely relevant to the coaching aspect, sure, but this all connects to what /u/mayo-sausages1 said about practicing techniques from an early age.",2015-11-02 00:57:50+00:00,cwl1mbo,10.0,t1_cwl0w1g,1215.0,soccer

Maybe hypno is in that category as well?

Basically what I'm looking for is something where the girl isn't really an active participant but doesn't really try to stop what is happening / accepts it (without screaming the whole time). I'm asking because yesterday I found the Reiko Kobayakawa video I linked to and I thought it was amazing, but I don't know where to start looking so I can find more videos like that.

If you have the most points overall you're pretty much guaranteed to be up there in the standings by the end of the season unless you have some flukey losses. For example, myself and another guy had 455+ points (highest in the H2H league) prior to this matchweek and were 6-0-3 (2nd and 3rd respectively), while the guy in 1st place was only on 423 points and was 7-0-2 (and had won three very low scoring matchups by 1 point). Everybody else below us had less than 400 points.

This matchweek (which hasn't been updated yet) will put me and the guy below me at the top of the league at 7-0-3 with way more points than the former 1st place flukester (who lost his matchup). Basically what I'm saying is just focus on getting the most points possible with the team you have and don't worry about what anybody else is doing. H2H is the same as going for overall scores, just with a little more luck involved.

&gt; Fucking Epic. Absolutely Epic. I can't wait for a sequel, this is my favourite series of the year by far.

&gt; I thought Overlord was utterly fantastic. The fight scene with Ainz vs the Angels in episode 4 was so fucking hype, it's been months since I was so excited/hyped for a battle. The soundtrack during the anime was epic and did a great job setting the mood. I also really loved how varied the whole cast of characters were and the ""presence"" of strength that every one of them gave off (reminded me of the phantom troupe from HxH in a way).

Those are just a couple of examples. If you look through the rest of the episode discussions you can see loads of people going crazy over it.",2015-10-19 03:01:25+00:00,cw4rit3,3.0,t1_cw4qocw,1336.0,anime

I rated it 4/10. The first half of the final episode is *amazing*, but everything up until that point is hit or miss. The show expects you to care about the side characters without really giving you a reason to, which becomes a problem during the climax.

I'd say this show is worth watching if only for the two episode World War 2 flashback sequences which show Hyoubu Kyousuke as a child soldier. The way they show the divide between humans and espers is very well done. Other than that, the fight sequences in the show are really cool looking (and definitely worth watching), but the muddled story keeps the show from being anything special.

If they had just made the first two story arcs 6 episodes each (or 7 episodes for story arc 1 if they [OVA](/s ""expanded on Hampnie Hambarts backstory with Ai's mother like they did in the OVA"")) I think the show would have been a lot better.

Hacka Doll - A pretty fun show but it lacks the depth to be anything more than a 6 on my scale. 8 minutes is the perfect length for it, though.

Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry - One of those shows that I'll watch but I won't *need* to see as soon as a new episode comes out.

Young Black Jack - It's interesting to see a medical anime but some of the stuff that happened in the first episode was ridiculously stupid.

Garo - The enemies were really creepy (which I liked) but the story seemed pretty bland.

* #1347 [Chaika - The Coffin Princess](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20853/Hitsugi_no_Chaika) - Really likeable cast of characters even though the ending felt a bit rushed. Watch it [for the eyebrows](https://anifilereviews.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/chaika_6.jpg)
* #2045 [Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10456/Kyoukaisenjou_no_Horizon) - Pretty unique MC + interesting plot + fan service that doesn't get in the way of the story
* #2108 [Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13161/Hagure_Yuusha_no_Aesthetica) - A must watch if you like OP MCs, ecchi, and no harems
* #2314 [Lesbian Bear Storm](http://myanimelist.net/anime/26165/Yuri_Kuma_Arashi) - I think it's awesome that a show like this was made, especially in this day and age when slowly homosexuality is becoming more accepted (but still has a ways to go in some parts of the world). It's a social commentary on how lesbians and lesbian relationships are viewed in Japan
* #3735 [Gambo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17679/Gambo) - A short film (12 minutes) about a battle between a demon and a mysterious white bear. The fighting is brutal and really well animated

For Cowboy Bebop, I don't enjoy episodic shows unless I really like the characters (eg. Samurai Champloo, first part of Trigun, etc). I am really indifferent about the characters in Cowboy Bebop and it started feeling like a chore to get through the episodes. Would the final two episodes be worth watching by themselves, or do I need to watch episodes 20-24 to get relevant story information?

For Madoka, I really did not like the main characters or the way the story was headed. [](/s ""I assume that once the one girl became a witch to save the boy she loved he just kicked her to the curb? Please answer this for me."")",2015-09-23 21:10:11+00:00,cvbtobl,3.0,t1_cvbtc8o,487.0,anime

Other than that:

{Punch Line} is worth watching even though the first few episodes are awful + other problems I had with the way the story was handled. (7/10)

{Classroom☆Crisis} starts absolutely terribly, but if you can make it through a few horrible episodes it's actually a pretty neat show which focuses on the politics of business. It won't be on any ""top anime"" lists any time soon, but it's enjoyable. (6/10)

From the winter season I think {Yuri Bear Storm} is worth a watch if you're *really* into metaphors. It's basically a commentary of how lesbians and lesbian relationships are viewed in Japan.

The characters in Mirai Nikki routinely do things that make *no sense* considering they are in the middle of a death game. Also, the MC is one of the most annoying characters I have ever seen in any show, anime or otherwise. The only redeeming thing about this show is seeing what Yuno does next, but imo her crazy antics are only interesting for the first couple of episodes. [This review describes my feelings a lot better than I can](http://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=112811).

Overlord has a very interesting concept but unfortunately every episode seems to move at a slow pace yet for some reason it feels like every episode ends rather quickly. Overlord does have some cool moments but I don't think that those moments have been good enough to warrant the slow build up.

I can tolerate a yandere character if I think that the show they're in is good (eg. Rokka no Yuusha), but in my experience that usually isn't the case.

I would definitely be considering dropping {Overlord} due to its slow pace and yandere character, but I figure I'll stick it out since only 3 episodes remain. 

I also dropped:

I also started feeling really bad for the Vice Principal as the series went on which I don't think was supposed to happen. Regardless, this show is a lot of fun and I *really* like when Onizuka does a complete 180 from goofball to wise teacher. [9/10]

I also just finished Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited. The powers in this show were interesting but imo they weren't explained very well and the show didn't do a very good job of getting me to care about any of the characters. Watch this if you want to see the Japanese X-Men but don't expect the story to hold your attention (the first half of the last episode is surprisingly fantastic, though). [4/10]

I also finished Black Lagoon a few days ago. It reminded me of Cowboy Bebop but for some reason I liked this show a lot more. That might just be because I hate episodic shows, though. [9/10]

Other than that I'm watching six currently airing shows (Charlotte, Kekkai Sensen, Shokugeki no Souma, GATE, Overlord, and Gangsta), but all of them except SnS [8/10] have gotten pretty stale. The world of Gangsta is bland and lifeless, Overlord moves too slow for me to care too much, GATE is taking too long to get to where everybody knows it is going to go (and I doubt I'm going to like that part of it at all), Charlotte has weird pacing and is only starting to pick up with 3 episodes left, and I don't even remember what was happening in Kekkai Sensen anymore since the final episode has been taking so long to come out.

EDIT: The intro in the original song says:

&gt; They call me Daewoong. It’s nice to meet you.

&gt; Ah-- there’s been something I’ve really been wanting to say:

&gt; Honestly, I really wanted to be a rapper.

&gt; So, I dropped out of school and just…

&gt; I was only going to do what I wanted to do, and I didn’t get out much.

&gt; Man, I kept making my parents frustrated.

&gt; Uh… I thought everything was so cool. 

&gt;Just, everything seemed so cool.

&gt; In my eyes, I was also posing and posturing on stage.

&gt; Man, I was dating so many girls.

&gt; Man, I was f*cking girls so many girls, man.

&gt; I wanted to make lots of money, too.

&gt; Man, I wanted to do all that but…

&gt; That was just… not knowing anything.

&gt; Just expecting things on the inside.

&gt; Uh, now that I’ve started rapping, really… it’s so hard.

&gt; Man, now all of my friends-- one by one, 

&gt; Are succeeding and getting jobs.

&gt; And when I see them like this--

&gt; Ah-- I can only think, “What have I done?”

&gt; But when I look back, really, there was nothing I could do. Just…

&gt; I came all this way, always rapping and always writing lyrics.

&gt; Well, you know it’s not like I’m good at rapping. So…

&gt; Really, well… There’s nothing I’m good at. I’m just…

&gt; I’m just like a stupid f*cking kid! Just…

&gt; But all I can do,

&gt; This is all I can do.

&gt; (So listen)

So I'm assuming I'm right

4556,"Saraiya Goyou (House of Five Leaves) [I see this is on your Plan To Watch list]

A samurai with a personality problem (he is very timid) joins a group of kidnappers who also have their own personal demons. Throughout the story the characters are forced to confront those demons in one way or another so that they can finally put their pasts behind them and start anew. While this show is set in the Edo period of Japan and involves samurai, it *is not* action-oriented. This show is character driven, and because of that all of the action scenes which do occur are both realistic and important to the development and understanding of the characters.

The plot of Saraiya Goyou is difficult to explain without spoiling anything, but I hope that at least a few people reading this will give it a shot. It's only 12 episodes long, but the story that is told in those 12 episodes is more captivating and beautiful than most longer shows. [The OST is fantastic as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MByPy4ZMnNM).

Saraiya Goyou is a 10/10 in my book.

Just look at Taeyang's English version of [Wedding Dress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KfNitsyZoU). The lyrics are so much better than most kpop songs with English lyrics but they still sound *off*.

Taeyang also sounds odd when singing in English. [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km51krTECbw). It sort of sounds like he's singing with his mouth full (eg. his words are not clear and he tends to drag out some syllables). Daesung also has this problem to a lesser extent. On the other hand, Seungri seems to have a better grasp at enunciation and what-have-you. [Example](https://youtu.be/VYafaHhwmRU?t=1m30s). In all of BIGBANG's old English language songs Seungri is always the vocalist who sounds the most like a native speaker. [Example](https://youtu.be/8wsYUOkcEFw?t=1m19s). [Example](https://youtu.be/gMzbvdUATFw?t=1m22s).

Granted, all of these examples are 4+ years old, but if Taeyang's English singing hasn't improved since then, I just don't think he'd be able to completely crossover. The problem also lies in how he sings in general, since he also sounds like he sings with his mouth full when singing in Korean (though to a lesser extent than in the English songs). He *might* be able to get a bigger foothold in the RnB community, but I doubt he'd ever get out of that niche.",2015-07-12 01:32:50+00:00,ct08rz2,2.0,t1_ct055xy,7415.0,kpop

Either means that he does this type of thing a lot or he's going to start doing it regularly. He's obviously completely insane, which is why the closing lines seem so carefree.

**J.League 1 Final Day 2005**

Took me an hour to write this up, damned if I'm not going to repost it at least once as it's arguably one of the most important events in league history. Everything below is translated from [the Japanese Wikipedia article](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005%E5%B9%B4J1%E6%9C%80%E7%B5%82%E7%AF%80) regarding this match.

**THE BACKGROUND**

Following the 2005 J-League Cup in which JEF United Chiba beat Gamba Osaka in penalties, Gamba were the only 'Original 10' club to have not won a title. This was the top of the table after 30 matches, when they lead the league:

| Team | Points    |  Wins     | Draws | Losses | GD |
|:-----------|:------------:|:------------:|:---:|:--:|:--:|
| Gamba Osaka     |57| 17  | 6 | 7 |+25 |
| Kashima Antlers |54|  15   | 9 | 6|+20 |
| Cerezo Osaka     |   53|   15     | 8 | 7|+6 |
| Urawa Reds     |    50|   14     | 8 | 8|+21 |
| JEF United Chiba   |    50|   13  | 11 | 6|+12 |
| Kawasaki Frontale    |   49| 15  | 4 | 11|+13 |

Gamba proceeds to lose their next three matches (Grampus, Ardija, and JEF), Kashima also goes winless (2 draws, 1 loss). Cerezo goes undefeated (1 win, 2 draws), Reds and JEF both win two and lose one. Frontale loses two and falls out of the running for the title.

Table after 33 matches:

| Team | Points    |  Wins     | Draws | Losses | GD |
|:-----------|:------------:|:------------:|:---:|:--:|:--:|
| Cerezo Osaka     |   58|   16     | 10 | 7|+8|
| Gamba Osaka     |57| 17  | 6 | 10 |+22 |
| Urawa Reds     |    56|   16     | 8 | 9|+24 |
| Kashima Antlers |56|  15   | 11 | 7|+18 |
| JEF United Chiba   |    56|   15  | 11 | 7|+13 |
| Kawasaki Frontale    |   50| 15  | 5 | 13|+9 |

Ahead of the final round of play, five teams were still in contention for the J-League title.
