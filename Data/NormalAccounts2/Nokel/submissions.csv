Hopefully this will get more of you to participate!

--- 

At the end of each month (or every two months) the /r/KoreanMusic discussion of the week will be about your favorite songs that were released that month. I'll be compiling ~15 of the selections and posting them to /r/KPop so that everybody over there can get a taste of K-Indie, K-Rock, K-Hip Hop, etc.

When posting a song, please try to include a sentence or two about why you like it. This can be as simple as the song making you think of summer or as complex as vocals, tempo, instrumentals, etc (preferably the latter to some extent).

Example:

[Electronic] [Goldmund - One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1G2EKWAP7Q)

&gt; This song has a sort of ""retro"" feel to it, which I really like. The way the singer fluctuates the volume of his voice ('punching' certain notes and then backing off) gives the song a really cool effect.

Also, if suggesting more than 3 songs please place an * next to the two that you would most like to see on the compilation list. This way we can make sure almost everybody gets some of their songs featured. This post will also be linked to in the compilation list, so even if your songs aren't picked they'll still be seen by people.

**List will be posted to /r/KPop in early November, so please have your songs submitted by the end of this month!**",koreanmusic,Discussion of the Week: What are your favorite songs from August - October 2016?

I just gave my dad my Xbox 360 and was wondering which Madden game from last gen has the best franchise mode.  I don't think he'd play a 'superstar' mode where he controls one player, so I'm just looking for a fun franchise mode where he can control trades, play calling, etc. 

I haven't played Madden since 2009 on PS2 so I'm a little out of the loop. I remember Madden 2005 having a good franchise mode, so anything similar to that would be great.

Is the deluxe version worth it for the extra weapons?

So, without further ado, here are our picks for July 2016!

---

[Indie] [We Are The Night - BRother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMqUxobOCIM)  
&gt; I could go on and on about how much I love We Are The Night. Every single release by them has surpassed their last and I love everything about their electropop indie style of music. Also, the singer has an incredible and unique voice. - /u/dessidy
  
[Indie] [MEat - Gloomy Saturday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FMU7XOeA7w)  
&gt; I stumbled upon this song while browsing new releases, and found myself putting it on replay. Gloomy Saturday is a chill indie song with a slightly jazzy atmosphere that would fit perfectly at a coffeehouse or inside on a rainy day. - /u/dessidy  
  
[R&amp;B] [Nieah - No Way (ft. Kamo)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81YPU5khkAI)  
&gt; Okay, I'm cheating a bit with this one, since it came out late June, but I discovered it late. No Way is a chill R&amp;B song and Nieah's and Kamo's voices go well together - /u/dessidy.  
  
[Synthpop] [Neon Bunny - Room 314](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiTAs2XRxD4)  
&gt; Since Stay Gold finally is out, I have to mention Neon Bunny. Several tracks from the album have been released as singles previously, so I decided to go with Room 314. The album as a whole is a masterpiece, so I'd recommend to listen to all of it! Neon Bunny is Korean synthpop at it's best. - /u/dessidy 

[Chill Rock] [Raw By Peppers - Spaceship Out Of Bones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbigcy_LCs) (LIVE @ OnStage)

&gt; The rhythmic instrumental and echoing vocals give this song a ""spacey"" vibe. Super cool and just as good (if not better) than the [studio version](https://my.mixtape.moe/osjsrf.mp3). - /u/nokel

[Trap/Cloud Rap] [Futuristic Swaver &amp; Icey Blouie - Dream Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeVj7M-eNog)

&gt; Featuring the best producer credit of all time! Swaver and Blouie are a little tough to get into due to their unique style, but once you get through the ""wtf even is this"" stage you'll be hooked. Like a lot of Swaver/Blouie songs, the instrumental in 'Dream Girl' is great and the rap parts are half-sung like you hear in most cloud rap. - /u/nokel

[Hip Hop] [Don Mills - Meerae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLSefFxpW-Y&amp;feature=youtu.be)

&gt; The most hype K-Hip Hop song I've heard all year! If you're even semi-interested in hip hop you have to check it out. - /u/nokel

[Electronic] [Cerise - Move Lightly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8IfMhNhCng)

&gt; The instrumental gives me Postal Service vibes. Great song for summer nights. - /u/nokel

[Indie Rock] [YELLΘW - ainos](https://youtu.be/T6gUAQ7wcp0)

&gt; The guitar in this song is really catchy! - /u/nokel 

[Indie Pop] [OOHYO - Youth (Day Version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrmyqKRGW-0)  
&gt; I believe a few idols have recommended OOHYO on occasion, and I'm joining them now (even though I'm not an idol...). I can't believe this slipped by me when it first came out. Youth is an amazing song, slightly indie poprock with a relaxed atmosphere. - /u/dessidy
  
[Indie Rock] [The Solutions - Ticket To The Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLl8YiSPlFI)  
&gt; The Solutions released a new song this week and it's amazing! I discovered them through Movements and hoped they would release new music soon. With this song they took their music style in a new direction and you can hear how much they've grown musically since both Movements and No Problem! EP from last year. - /u/dessidy
  
[Folk] [ESnote - Summer Sweet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Yypt4MxnUE)  
&gt; Another fantastic release from this week! Summer Sweet is, as it's name, a sweet summer song with a folksy indie uplifting atmosphere. - /u/dessidy

I hope you enjoyed our picks for the past two months! If you know of any great songs that aren't on this list, please share them in the comments.

Examples of YouTube channels which post professionally filmed performances: [ONSTAGE](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCACti7fagQ5OH_47IaWwpPQ), [LIVE AND DIRECT](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSxSnHdgZdAp-ZiW7VnM0fA), [RealLive!](https://www.youtube.com/user/mbcnanjang/videos). Hopefully this will get more of you to participate!

--- 

At the end of each month (or every two months) the /r/KoreanMusic discussion of the week will be about your favorite songs that were released that month. I'll be compiling ~10-12 of the selections and posting them to /r/KPop so that everybody over there can get a taste of K-Indie, K-Rock, K-Hip Hop, etc.

When posting a song, please try to include a sentence or two about why you like it. This can be as simple as the song making you think of summer or as complex as vocals, tempo, instrumentals, etc (preferably the latter to some extent).

Example:

[Electronic] [Goldmund - One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1G2EKWAP7Q)

&gt; This song has a sort of ""retro"" feel to it, which I really like. The way the singer fluctuates the volume of his voice ('punching' certain notes and then backing off) gives the song a really cool effect.

Also, if suggesting more than 2 songs please place an * next to the two that you would most like to see on the compilation list. This way we can make sure almost everybody gets some of their songs featured. This post will also be linked to in the compilation list, so even if your songs aren't picked they'll still be seen by people.

It also seems like the main games that they come up with each week are getting worse in a bad way, and I think that's due to them not having a special guest that they need to pitch the game idea to. Having a guest forces them to put some effort into formulating their game so that they have a cohesive outline of what it would be like. Without any guests the main game sometimes (and it's happening more frequently) feels like an afterthought, which is a shame.

I don't want to sound like a hater, because I really love the concept of the show and I think Griffin and Nick have a lot of chemistry (both from a comedic and romantic standpoint), but the past few episodes haven't been the best. Maybe they should only do episodes when they have a guest available? 

Anybody else feel the same way?

So, without further ado, here are our picks for May and June 2016!

---

[Ballad/Electronic] [Singer/Songwriter Gingee - Meow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdtX1IBflUI)

&gt; Best artist in Korea at the moment? I think so! Gingee released her debut song [The Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gF7vgqCtys) back in January of this year and Meow, her second release, is just as good! Her voice is AMAZING! Just a week ago she released an unfinished demo track called [Narara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UIpxA5GK3U) and it sends chills down my spine every time I listen to it. She's definitely one to keep an eye on for the future. - /u/nokel

[Hip Hop] [Futuristic Swaver - Gang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otFuKz9bzsA)

&gt; Dude looks nerdy as hell but he's got some swag. The beat in this song is top tier and Swaver's flow is great as always (and less polarizing than his 'cloud rap' songs). - /u/nokel

[Electro Pop] [Aseul - Fisher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnY5pnbLJF0)

&gt; After years of waiting, Yukari (now ""Aseul"") is finally back! This is my favorite song off of her album ""New Pop"" and imo is the most reminiscent of her dream pop album ""Echo"". - /u/nokel

[Instrumental] [Roy C. -  대자연](https://youtu.be/F3hB9LqVzHY)

&gt; Very calming. Kind of reminds me on [Doxx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f_z60CSNEc) in a lot of ways. - /u/nokel

[Indie Rock] [we hate jh - 표류](https://youtu.be/cx9wPZchZUM)

&gt; Hands down the best Indie Rock song I've heard all year. The singer is fantastic and the song overall is catchy as hell! - /u/nokel

[Pop Rock] [The Electriceels) - Equator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVV8ksdTxM)

&gt; Pretty fun summer song. I'm not a big pop rock guy but this one's pretty good! Also, the chorus reminds me of [HOT - Candy](https://youtu.be/_C7Fx2KpAKs?t=1m33s). - /u/nokel

[헤이즈 (Heize) - Shut Up &amp; Groove (Feat. DEAN)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=sk6WiGOmlso)

&gt;it's groove is just really contagious and is such a good song to have on while driving late at night. - /u/eyebrowsintensify

I hope you enjoyed our picks for the past two months! If you know of any great songs that aren't on this list, please share them in the comments.

I'll be compiling ~10-12 of the selections and posting them to /r/KPop so that everybody over there can get a taste of K-Indie, K-Rock, K-Hip Hop, etc.

When posting a song, please try to include a sentence or two about why you like it. This can be as simple as the song making you think of summer or as complex as vocals, tempo, instrumentals, etc (preferably the latter to some extent).

Example:

[Electronic] [Goldmund - One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1G2EKWAP7Q)

&gt; This song has a sort of ""retro"" feel to it, which I really like. The way the singer fluctuates the volume of his voice ('punching' certain notes and then backing off) gives the song a really cool effect.

Also, if suggesting more than 2 songs please place an * next to the two that you would most like to see on the compilation list. This way we can make sure almost everybody gets some of their songs featured. This post will also be linked to in the compilation list, so even if your songs aren't picked they'll still be seen by people.

The instrumental doesn't do anything crazy. It's basically the same throughout the whole song.

Are there any other KPop songs like this? Songs with subdued instrumentals which are simple yet not boring? I guess another example would be [BIGBANG - Love Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaKtQXYqclw) since that song is 90% bass + Piano notes + Drum fill, but I'd prefer something similar to Is It Poppin'.",kpophelp,Looking for songs with extremely simple instrumentals,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpophelp/comments/4pju1d/looking_for_songs_with_extremely_simple/

The J.League is a very exciting league where you'll see a number of crazy goals each season. Here's just a few that were scored in the past few weeks:

* [Taishi Taguchi one-timer vs Kashima Antlers](https://streamable.com/gput) (Matchday 13)
* [Yu Kobayashi volley vs Kashiwa Reysol](https://streamable.com/paho) (Matchday 11)
* [Robin Simovic volley vs Urawa Red Diamonds](https://streamable.com/ykv4) (Matchday 9)

Check out more awesome goals in my [J.League Goals of the Week](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/search?q=nokel%27s+top&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) submissions.

Each year I put together a couple of guides for the league. These are:

* [Nokel's 2016 J.League Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/46n1qx/nokels_2016_jleague_guide/) - includes league/club information
* [Nokel's 2016 J.League Resource Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/44zafa/nokels_2016_jleague_resource_guide/) - includes streaming links, official/unofficial YouTube/Twitter/Vine/etc sites, podcasts, and more

---

As for our subreddit, **/r/JLeague**, in the sidebar we have links to the aforementioned guides, highlights, the J-Talk podcast, and regularly updated league tables for J.League 1 and 2. Additionally, stickied to the top of the subreddit is a Japanese soccer calender which is maintained by /u/doarachan, which makes it easy to follow what is going on in the world of Japanese soccer.

---

I hope some of you check out a few J.League matches this year! They usually take place on Saturdays between 12AM EST and 6AM EST, so if you're up during that time period with nothing to do, why not check out a match?

If you have any other questions about the league, feel free to ask them here or on /r/JLeague. I didn't go too in-depth into the league structure or what-have-you in this post since I did that earlier this year in my two guides, so please check those out! Just consider this post a friendly reminder that this awesome league exists!

Album: Behind The Eyes

Released: 2012.01.18

Genres: Glo-fi, Dream Pop

Music Videos: [Let It Flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMXiY9NJT40)

Notes: Googolplex is a dream pop duo out of Seoul with a very ambient and melodic sound. Their style is similar to ASEUL's work under the Yukari moniker (she even created a remix of Googolplex's [""Blind""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXeuyDCaSSA)). The group went on a long hiatus in February 2013 after releasing a track entitled [""Farewell""](https://soundcloud.com/fndt/googolplex-farewell), but they made a return less than a week ago with [""Pop""](https://soundcloud.com/googolplex-2/pop) - a free-to-download 1-minute track.

https://www.reddit.com/r/kmusiccss/about/stylesheet

&gt; ctrl ""album of the week""

As you can see I'm attempting to add a sidebar image to my subreddit. The problem is that it only shows up when I use "".side"" instead of "".side .md""

Example:
   
    .side [href*=""//www.reddit.com""]:before {
    position: absolute;
    top: 193px;
    right: 9px;
    height: 343px;
    width: 343px;
    background: black url(%%SidebarImage%%);
    z-index: 0;
    font-size: 11px;
    margin-bottom:6px;
    text-shadow: 1px 1px 0 black;
    line-height: 11px;
    background-position: center;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    border: white solid 6px;

This places the sidebar image where I want it but it apparently leaves me unable to add  a text box over the image like I have in the sidebar of /r/JLeague. If I use "".side .md"" for the sidebar image code it just disappears completely. 

Hope that makes sense. I've got no idea what to do so any help would be appreciated.

The new post title guidelines will work a lot like the ones on /r/listentothis. Titles on that subreddit currently follow the following format:

&gt; Artist - Song Title [Genre(s)] (Year Released)

/r/KoreanMusic will *be copying that exact format* but will also be requiring an additional identifier so that visitors can easily distinguish between Audio, Music Video, Teaser, Album Discussion, and News Article posts. Some examples:

&gt; [MV] Aseul - Loveless [Electro Pop] (2016)

&gt; [Audio] Yukari - Hang On [Dream Pop] (2012)

&gt; [Teaser] Aseul - New Pop [Electro Pop] (2016.05.10)

&gt; [Article] No Brain Release Two Music Videos for Brainless

So, to put it simply...

**Audio/Music Video** post titles will follow the following format:

&gt; [Audio] Artist - Song Title [Genre(s)] (Year Released)

&gt; [MV] Artist - Song Title [Genre(s)] (Year Released)

**Teaser** (pictures, videos, text) post titles will follow the following format:

&gt; [Teaser] Artist - Song/Album Title [Genre(s)] (Date Album/Song Will Be Released)

**News Article/Review** titles will follow the following format:

&gt; [Article] Article Title

Finally, we are introducing a special tag for Album Discussions! Titles with [Album Discussion] at the beginning will turn green when posted to this subreddit (so that they stand out). 

**Album Discussion** posts should follow the following format:

&gt; [Album Discussion] Artist - Album Title [Genre(s)] (Year Released)

Also, when making an Album Discussion thread, please include a link to a website where people can listen to the full album. Right now *we aren't restricting this to new albums*, so feel free to post your favorite albums from the past!

I have a similar type of thing going on in my other subreddit /r/JLeague with [the keywords ""Match Thread""](https://www.reddit.com/r/JLeague/search?q=match+thread&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all), but when I try to transplant the code from that subreddit to /r/KoreanMusic it doesn't seem to work.

So, without further ado, here are our picks for April 2016!

---

[Dance/Electronic] [DDNJ - Disco Nature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egAKiOr7URA)

&gt; Really fun song that just makes you want to dance. I'm a huge fan of breathy/quiet vocals which don't overpower the instrumental (eg. [Yukari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGWKJtQgQEQ), [Bonjour Suzuki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSRsyqsyv4Q)), so this song was right up my alley. - /u/Nokel

[Rock/Electronic] [BEARX - 밤그늘 (Night Shade)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKzzkY1vheI)

&gt; One of the best songs I've heard this year. It takes a full minute for the vocals to kick in and it's totally worth the wait. The chorus, while pretty simple instrumentally, gets me hyped whenever I hear it and I don't think I'll ever get tired of it. - /u/Nokel

[Rock/Folk] [Danpyunsun and the Sailors - High and Low](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1hAszFEuvM)

&gt; Super unique sound which I haven't heard much in Korean music. The fiddle (or violin?) player adds a really cool flavor to the song which complements the singer's vocals perfectly. Overall a really interesting song musically which everybody can appreciate on some level. - /u/Nokel

[Rock/Electronic] [Sugardonut - Imagine, Close Your Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOFiVKnRIds)

&gt; As a YouTube commenter put it, this song is ""like a musical skydive."". The structure of this song is all about building anticipation for the booming chorus, and I have to say it's masterfully done. - /u/Nokel

[Piano/Instrumental] [Choi Youngmin - 기억이 내리다](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ0SIDruiok) 
&gt; I really think the album cover is rather fitting for the song. Listening to it does make me think of going away or traveling on a rainy day. There's also a feeling of nostalgia and something else that the music conjures when I'm listening to it. It's not catchy or very impressive but I picked it out because of its introspective quality. - /u/hewhomadetheworld

[Ballad] [Allegrow - Revolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAaR8TpyLPU)
&gt; A very sad song. The lyrics are also interesting (subs are awkward though) and the album [description](http://www.mnet.com/album/540934) makes it even more so. The good vocals play well with the instruments and I think it helps really evoke the emotions of the listener. I'm also biased towards sad songs. - /u/hewhomadetheworld

I'll be compiling ~10-12 of the selections and posting them to /r/KPop so that everybody over there can get a taste of K-Indie, K-Rock, K-Hip Hop, etc.

When posting a song, please try to include a sentence or two about why you like it. This can be as simple as the song making you think of summer or as complex as vocals, tempo, instrumentals, etc (preferably the latter to some extent).

Example:

[Electronic] [Goldmund - One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1G2EKWAP7Q)

&gt; This song has a sort of ""retro"" feel to it, which I really like. The way the singer fluctuates the volume of his voice ('punching' certain notes and then backing off) gives the song a really cool effect.

Also, if suggesting more than 2 songs please place an * next to the two that you would most like to see on the compilation list. This way we can make sure almost everybody gets some of their songs featured. This post will also be linked to in the compilation list, so even if your songs aren't picked they'll still be seen by people.

**List will be posted to /r/KPop by May 2nd**

[999](#s "" ""Clover looks really sad for some reason"" - or something to that effect - minutes after Snake died. Also the romance between him and Akane was really awkward to read and made me cringe more often than not"")) really rubs me the wrong way. 

Also, the randomly placed bits of comic relief throughout the game alwasys break my immersion. For example, when I was in the [](#s ""Captain's room with Ace, Junpei kept 'pointing' at things and making 'funny' comments to Ace. Like saying ""Hey, look at this huge mousetrap"" in reference to a telegraph."") It ruined the atmosphere and I found it pretty jarring rather than funny.

To be more clear, I'm asking:

* Is the tone of VLR's story more consistent than 999's? Basically, if there is comic relief, is it spread more evenly throughout the game rather than happening sporadically?
* Is the MC in VLR more mature/clever than Junpei? Junpei has a tendency to be a bit dense and immature, which honestly got on my nerves a bit.

What other improvements does VLR have over 999 in terms of game design and character dialogue? I've been looking online but I can't find a direct comparison between the two.

Thanks for your help. I've been trying to decide whether or not I want to get VLR before the Nintendo E-Shop sale ends, but I just can't make a decision!",ZeroEscape,Is the writing in VLR better than the writing in 999?

I didn't get many suggestions this week (I had [made a post on /r/KoreanMusic asking for suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanmusic/comments/4cfwnx/post_your_favorite_korean_indie_songs_from/)), so once again this list will mainly be comprised of songs that I like!

[Electronic] [Goldmund - One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1G2EKWAP7Q)

&gt; This song has a sort of ""retro"" feel to it, which I really like. The way the singer fluctuates the volume of his voice ('punching' certain notes and the backing off) gives the song a really cool effect.

[Rock] [Tonics - Song Of The Dead Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oePRAqwYUEQ)

&gt;  This is a really mellow and 'spacey' tune. The singer isn't the greatest but I think that just adds to the feel of the song. 

[Synth Pop] [Daybreak - Mellow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atstFjRxf4c)

&gt; The perfect song for Spring! Everything about it is upbeat and happy.

[Rock] [Stellarjet - Guiding Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EORGbefYcEU)

&gt; 100% in English! There's a whole lot going on in the instrumental which is really interesting to listen to. It's definitely one of my favorite songs of 2016.

[Indie Rock] [Fantastic Drugstore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXYSfZbHJcA)

I'm making my 2016 Viewing Guide right now and I need your help compiling a list of J.League websites. If you have any time, please look up the Japanese websites of a few J.League clubs and post them in the comments in this format:

So this would look like (for example):

687,2016-02-01 20:05:17+00:00,self.kpop,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/43qbcc/my_korean_indie_picks_for_december_2015_and/,False,"Since I don't see Korean Indie music talked about that often on this subreddit, I thought it would be a good idea to share my favorite K-Indie songs from the past two months with /r/KPop.

In no particular order:

* [Rock] [Singer/Songwriter Gingee - The Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gF7vgqCtys)

&gt; This song is simply amazing. The instrumental has layers added to it throughout the song, eventually leading to an incredible climax which gives me chills every time I hear it. The vocals are also fantastic, with booming notes that 'fill your ears' occasionally being broken up by high notes which, due to the contrast, seem to pierce right through the middle of your head.

* [Rock] [Fantastic Drugstore - Scarlet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p59AA1fNsPQ)

&gt; Smooth (and I mean smoooooooooooooooooooooooth) vocals coupled with an even smoother instrumental. What's not to like? You'll fall in love with this song as soon as you hear the falsetto in the chorus.

* [Rock] [Phonebooth - The End of the Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foDiRbA7Bfk)

&gt; Really interesting sound that I haven't heard from many other Korean rock bands. The drums and guitars keep it relatively low-key until the chorus hits, which gives the song a chill and 'spacey' vibe to it. It's a nice change of pace from other bands like [MAAN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5PDERBzkF4), [The Koxx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMZYdSh_GzU), [Startline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwn_pK3vvOA), and etc who tend to have their instruments stick out rather than stay in the background.


* [Dream Pop] [Swimmers - Woodstock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPBw7XC37XA)

&gt; Korean dream pop might be my favorite thing ever. Definitely check this out if you're a fan of [Yukari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGWKJtQgQEQ), because I get similar vibes from this band (though their sound is much less electronic than Yukari's). PS: [Yukari's new album](https://www.facebook.com/ukarimusik/photos/a.233486646747025.49765.160063190756038/887448564684160/?type=3&amp;theater) is coming out soon! Who else is hyped??

* [Rock] [Every Single Day - Sweet Illusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE235n3SN-c)

&gt; Came out November 26, 2015, but I'm putting it on this list anyway! I've had this song playing in my car for the past couple of months and I don't see that changing any time soon. The chorus is catchy as hell and I feel like I want to get up and jump around whenever I hear it (which might not be the best thing to do when I'm driving). Definitely one of my favorite songs of 2015

* [Electronic] [Now &amp; Then - This Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BNm6-oYuX8)

&gt; This song is just... cool. Give it a listen.

* [Rock] [The Black Skirts - Everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq_gsctWHtQ&amp;feature=youtu.be)

&gt; Definitely the most mainstream of this bunch, but fantastic nonetheless! Recently signed to Tablo's HIGHGRND.

* [RnB] [Big Brain - Break Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xpg-iWmyFM)

&gt; Might be the best male vocalists on this list. I'm not really an RnB guy (well, besides my boy [Baek Sang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_2SdnXuVRU)), but this song is great.

I hope you guys enjoyed these songs! I'm hoping to be added as a moderator of /r/KoreanMusic soon so I can sticky a post to the top of subreddit at the end of February where everyone can post and talk about their favorite songs from that month (which I'll then post as a list on /r/KPop).

###Current League Format

Currently, J.League Division 1 is contested between 18 clubs, Division 2 between 22 clubs, and Division 3 between 13 clubs. This brings the J.League to a grand total of 53 fully professional clubs. There is a promotion / relegation system in place throughout the league pyramid.

**Two Stage System**

Starting this year J.League Division 1 will use a two-stage ""mini-league"" system, culminating in Post Season Playoffs and a Championship Series.

This is how qualification for the Post Season Playoffs is set up:

* The winner of each stage earn a home berth in the first round of the playoffs. Whichever one of these has the most points in the overall league table is the top seed and will play all of their playoff matches at home.
* The teams with the second-most and third-most points over the entire season also qualify for the playoffs, bringing the total to 4 clubs.
* The stage winner with the most points plays against the third-place finisher and the stage winner with fewer points plays the second-place finisher.
* When the playoffs are complete the winner will face the team with the most points over the entire year in a home-and-away Championship Series.

Here is a visual of the playoff system (from what I can tell):

     #1 Stage Winner vs 3rd Place Overall 
                                          &gt; Winner 1 vs Winner 2 ------
     #2 Stage Winner vs 2nd Place Overall 
                                                                       &gt;  Home and Away Championship Series                  
     Overall League Table Winner --------------------------------------



As you can probably tell, there is a chance that some teams may qualify in more than one way, at which point the playoffs will be shortened accordingly. For example:

* If the First Stage Champion also has the most points over the full season, they qualify directly for the Championship Series (they do not participate in the playoffs)
* In the above example, the Second Stage Champion would play against the full-season third-place finisher, and the winner of that match would face the full-season second-place team.
*  If the Second Stage Champion also compiled the second- or third-most points over the full season, there would only be one other team in position to qualify for the playoffs. In that case, only one playoff match would be needed.
* In practice, the playoffs may often involve just three teams, with one playoff match (between the second and third point-getters) followed by a home-and-away Championship Series.

The above explanation about the format of the Playoffs is taken directly from [this article by Ken Matsushima](http://www.oneworldsports.com/stories/japanese-football-gets-new-format), because I still have a hard time understanding how they will work.

**Asian Champions League Qualification**

For 2015 Japan has been allocated 3+1 spot in the Champions League group stage, which they distribute across their tournaments like so:

* The Champion and Runner-up in the J.League automatically qualify
* The [Emperor's Cup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Emperor%27s_Cup) Champion automatically qualifies
* The 3rd place finisher overall in the J.League gains entry to the final play-off round of the Champions League qualifying playoffs

The clubs participating in the 2015 Asian Champions League are Gamba Osaka, Urawa Red Diamonds, Kashima Antlers, and (entering in the play-off round) Kashiwa Reysol.

*Post Champions League Playoff Update*

Kashiwa Reysol defeated Thai club Chonburi, which gives Japan a total of 4 clubs in the Champions League Group Stage.

**Relegation in J.League Division 1**

At the end of each season the bottom 3 clubs on the overall table are relegated to Division 2. In 2014 these clubs were Omiya Ardija, Cerezo Osaka, and Tokushima Vortis.

**Promotion in J.League Division 2**

The top two clubs in J2 are automatically promoted to J1 at the end of the season. The clubs that finished 3rd - 6th in the league participate in the ""Promotion Playoffs"", a single elimination tournament with the winner receiving the final promotion spot. The tournament is structured like this:

    3rd v 6th 
               &gt; Winner 1 vs Winner 2
    4th v 5th

In 2014 the clubs that gained promotion from J2 were Shonan Bellmare, Matsumoto Yamaga, and Montedio Yamagata (the promotion playoffs winner). 

**Relegation in J2 and Promotion in J3**

The bottom club in J2 is automatically relegated to the third division in exchange for the winner of J3.League. However, the second bottom club in J2 and Runner-Up of J3 play each other in a 'Promotion Playoff', a one-off match which determines if the J2 club remains in that division or gets relegated.

**Relegation in J3**

There will be no relegation from J3.League in the foreseeable future.

###**J.League 100 Year Plan Status**

The J.League 100 Year Plan Status is a status given to Japanese non-league clubs that have the intention of entering becoming a professional club and joining the professional leagues at some point in the future. This system allows the J.League to identify clubs in order to give them advice, resources, and to ease the transition into professionalism. 

In order to achieve this status, clubs that apply must meet a number of criteria, which include:

^(I have only included some of the criteria. There are more that I have not listed)

* Must be organized as a public corporation or NPO solely devoted to football and exist in this status for no less than one year
* Must employ at least four administrative employees, one of whom must have managerial position
* Must have proper financial management and conduct annual tax audit
* Home stadium must be located in the proposed hometown
* Must secure training facilities within the proposed hometown
* Must secure training facilities in hometown
* Must currently play in Japan Football League (4th tier), Regional League, or Prefectural League
* Must aim for eventual admission to J. League
* Must have a working soccer school/youth system that exists for no less than one year

To gain promotion to the J.League 3rd Division, clubs must meet the following criteria:

* Must hold a 100 Year Plan status
* Must have a stadium that complies with J3 standards (capacity 5,000 or above) and passes the league examination
* Must pass a J3 licensing examination by the league
* Must finish within top 4 of JFL, and either 1st or 2nd among other 100 Year Plan holders
* Must have average attendance of home games no less than 2,000 spectators, with significant effort demonstrated to reach 3,000
* Must have annual revenue of at least ¥150 million (~$1,250,000), and no excessive debt

As of the submission of this post there are 6 clubs that hold 100 Year Plan Status.

###**Domestic Tournaments**

Japan has three major tournaments that take place each season. I have listed them in order of importance.

**Emperor's Cup (Est. in 1921)**

The longest running soccer tournament in Japan, this Cup is contested over 7 Rounds and includes 88 clubs from across Japan. The winner of the cup gains entry into the AFC Champions League.

[Click here for information on last year's Emperor's Cup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Emperor's_Cup), which Gamba Osaka won.

**J. League Cup (Est. in 1992)**

The J.League Cup (Yamazaki Nabisco Cup for sponsorship purposes) is the Japanese equivalent of the Football League Cup in England, though it is currently only contested between clubs in the first division. The winner of the Cup qualifies for the Suruga Bank Championship, an annual intercontinental match against the winner of the Copa Sudamericana.

[Click here for details](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._League_Cup)

**Japanese Super Cup (Est. in 1994)**

This Cup is a one-off match contested between the winner of the Emperor's Cup and the winner of J.League Division 1. It is played in February before the J.League begins.

This year the Cup was played between Emperor's Cup winner Gamba Osaka and J.League Division 1 runner-up Urawa Red Diamonds (due to Gamba being J.League Champions).

I'm tired of having to stare at subs all the time, so I'm looking for an OK dub which will allow me to do other things while I listen to the show. I'm currently watching Dragon Ball, but I'm probably going to finish that in a few weeks. Anything in the PTW, dropped, and on hold sections are fair game.

Also if you wouldn't mind rating the voice acting from 1 to 10 so I have an idea of what to expect. I consider the voice acting in Dragon Ball Kai to be a 10, so if you've seen that you can use that as a gauge for what to rate the show that you suggest.

Today is the final day of the J.League regular season! Due to the J.League switching to a 2 Stage format this year, 3 teams will move on to the Final Series (which will determine the 2015 J.League Champion) The criteria for gaining entry into the Final Series is as follows:

&gt; The winners of the first and second stages and any team that finishes in the top 3 of the overall rankings advance to the championship stage. The team that finishes atop the overall table automatically qualifies for the final, while the remaining teams play-off for the other spot in the final.

Here is a visual of the Final Series format this year (since the two stage winners are 1st and 2nd overall):


    Stage Winner vs 3rd Place Overall
                                      &gt; Championship Match
    1st Place Overall ---------------

**Current Top 4 Overall** | **[Full League Table](http://www.jleague.jp/en/standings/j1/)**

^(No other clubs are able to reach the top 3 and all of the relegation spots have already been filled - basically, these are the only clubs that matter today)

Pos|Club|Points|GD|1st Stage Title|2nd Stage Title|Notes
:--:|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--
1|[](#sprite2-p208) Sanfrecce Hiroshima|**71**|+38||Yes|2012 &amp; 2013 J.League Champions
2|[](#sprite2-p287) Urawa Red Diamonds|**69**|+26|Yes||2006 J.League Champions, 2007 Champions League Winners

4|[](#sprite2-p12) Gamba Osaka|**60**|+15|||Completed Domestic Treble in 2014 (J.League, J.League Cup, Emperor's Cup)

As you can see, **Urawa** and **Sanfrecce** have won the 1st and 2nd stage titles respectively, so they qualify for the Final Series. The results of their matches today will determine who will skip the play-off and automatically move on to the **Championship Match**.

&gt; **Sanfrecce** need: A win *or* draw *or* Urawa loss

&gt; **Urawa** need: A win and a Sanfrecce loss

&gt; Urawa will also be able to take 1st place if Sanfrecce ties and Urawa wins their match by 13 goals, but that is virtually impossible

The 3rd and last spot in the Final Series is being contested by **FC Tokyo** and **Gamba**. 

&gt; **FC Tokyo** need: A win *or* Gamba loss

&gt; **Gamba** need: A win and a Tokyo loss or draw

Today is the final day of the J.League regular season! Due to the J.League switching to a 2 Stage format this year, 3 teams will move on to the Final Series (which will determine the 2015 J.League Champion) The criteria for gaining entry into the Final Series is as follows:

&gt; The winners of the first and second stages and any team that finishes in the top 3 of the overall rankings advance to the championship stage. The team that finishes atop the overall table automatically qualifies for the final, while the remaining teams play-off for the other spot in the final.

Here is a visual of the Final Series format this year (since the two stage winners are 1st and 2nd overall):


    Stage Winner vs 3rd Place Overall
                                      &gt; Championship Match
    1st Place Overall ---------------

**Current Top 4 Overall** | **[Full League Table](http://www.jleague.jp/en/standings/j1/)**

^(No other clubs are able to reach the top 3 and all of the relegation spots have already been filled - basically, these are the only clubs that matter today)

4|[](#sprite2-p12) Gamba Osaka|**60**|+15|||Completed Domestic Treble in 2014 (J.League, J.League Cup, Emperor's Cup)

As you can see, **Urawa** and **Sanfrecce** have won the 1st and 2nd stage titles respectively, so they qualify for the Final Series. The results of their matches today will determine who will skip the play-off and automatically move on to the **Championship Match**.

&gt; **Sanfrecce** need: A win *or* draw *or* Urawa loss

&gt; **Urawa** need: A win and a Sanfrecce loss

&gt; Urawa will also be able to take 1st place if Sanfrecce ties and Urawa wins their match by 13 goals, but that is virtually impossible

The 3rd and last spot in the Final Series is being contested by **FC Tokyo** and **Gamba**. 

&gt; **FC Tokyo** need: A win *or* Gamba loss

&gt; **Gamba** need: A win and a Tokyo loss or draw

###What Is It?

Tesagure! Bukatsumono revolves around 4 girls who are in a club together. What is purpose of the club? To decide what the club is going to be about!

As somebody on MAL put it, T!B is basically the Mystery Science Theater 3000 of anime and manga. Each episode is spent breaking down and poking fun at tropes that are present in the various types of anime (sports, musicals, etc). If you enjoy meta-humor, this is the show for you!

###Why Should I Watch It?

The most unique aspect of this show is that it has an entire section that is strictly **ad-libbed** by the voice actresses, and it is by far the funniest thing I have seen in any anime. In this section each of the voice actresses share an idea of a change that could be made to the extracurricular activity that they're discussing that week (tennis, newspaper club, etc) in order to make it ""new"". These ad-lib sections are filled with bizarre ideas, [awful puns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-5n4EVsmmo), and uncontrollable laughter from the voice actresses!

###Conclusion

Tesagure! Bukatsumono is unlike anything I have ever seen, and because of that it's a little hard to explain what it's about. If I had to pinpoint what makes T!B so special, it would be how lifelike and likeable the characters are. The ad-lib sections allow the voice actresses to project their own personalities onto their characters, and that makes it feel like you're watching a group of friends joke around with each other. It's really refreshing!

I'm sure you'll love it if you give it a try! If you're still not convinced, check out [the hilarious OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2NHwqqaGpU) (which is sung by the voice actresses).

Bukatsumono](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19919/Tesagure!_Bukatsumono) has consistently made me laugh more than any show I have ever seen. 

The show revolves around 4 girls who are in a club together. What is purpose of the club? To decide what the club is going to be about!

As somebody on MAL put it, Tesagure! Bukatsumono is basically Mystery Science Theater 3000 for anime and manga. Each episode is spent breaking down and poking fun at tropes that are present in different types of anime and manga (eg. sports, musicals, etc). The best part of the show is undoubtedly the ad-lib section, where each of the voice actresses comes up with a change that could be made to the extracurricular activity that they're discussing in that episode (eg. Tennis, Newspaper Club, etc) in order to make it ""new"". These ad-lib sections are filled with bizarre ideas, [awful puns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-5n4EVsmmo), and uncontrollable laughter from the voice actresses!

It's kind of hard to explain exactly what this show is, but if you give it a try I'm sure you'll love it! 

I'll leave you with [the hilarious OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2NHwqqaGpU) (which is sung by the voice actresses).",Animesuggest,Want a hilarious meta-humor show with ad-lib sections?

###Story

Akitsu Masanosuke is a skilled swordsman, but his personality often causes him to be let go by the lords who employ him. One day he encounters Yaichi, the mysterious leader of the gang called ""Five Leaves"", who offers him a job as a bodyguard. Soon enough, Masanosuke finds himself being drawn deeper into the world of ""Five Leaves"", despite his misgivings about the true nature of the group.

###Characters

I will not divulge much information about the characters because their pasts are meant to be unknown.

Akitsu Masanosuke - A competent swordsman who suffers from social anxiety. 

Yaichi - The charismatic leader of ""Five Leaves"" and a bouncer at the local brothel.

Umezou - The owner of the tavern that ""Five Leaves"" use as their meeting place.

Otake- A sultry geisha.

Matsukichi - An unfriendly swordsman.

###Why You Should Watch

House of Five Leaves is extremely unique, both in terms of [art style](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-n10OcKrt-mM/Tq8tOX45Y4I/AAAAAAAAAi4/BzbJkPHZFOE/s1600/HouseofFiveLeavesep01b.jpg) and story. Unlike a majority of samurai anime, which focus on flashy action sequences and quests to become the strongest in the land, House of Five Leaves is essentially a character-driven drama. That isn't to say that there aren't any action scenes in House of Fives Leaves, but they are used sparingly and are only present in order to further the development of the characters.

At its core, House of Five Leaves is a story about coming to terms with your past. Each member of Five Leaves is forced to confront someone or something from their past, and these interactions are supplemented by flashbacks.

###Closing

I wish I could say more about why I love House of Five Leaves, but unfortunately I am unable to say a lot about the plot because you aren't supposed to know anything going in to it. Regardless, I think that House of Five Leaves is a wonderful anime to watch if you like realistic characters, realistic situations, and great [scene-setting music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MByPy4ZMnNM).

House of Five Leaves is extremely unique, both in terms of [art style](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-n10OcKrt-mM/Tq8tOX45Y4I/AAAAAAAAAi4/BzbJkPHZFOE/s1600/HouseofFiveLeavesep01b.jpg) and story. Unlike a majority of samurai anime, which focus on flashy action sequences and quests to become the strongest in the land, House of Five Leaves is essentially a character-driven drama. That isn't to say that there aren't any action scenes in House of Fives Leaves, but they are used sparingly and are only present in order to further the development of the characters.

At its core, House of Five Leaves is a story about coming to terms with your past. Each member of Five Leaves is forced to confront someone or something from their past, and those interactions are supplemented by flashbacks.

###Closing

I wish I could say more about why I love House of Five Leaves, but unfortunately I am unable to say a lot about the plot because you aren't supposed to know anything going in to it. Regardless, I think that House of Five Leaves is a wonderful anime to watch if you like realistic characters, realistic situations, and great [scene-setting music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MByPy4ZMnNM).

Hisato Sato 佐藤 寿人, a 33 year old striker who currently plays for Sanfrecce Hiroshima in J.League 1, is one of the most prolific goalscorers in J.League history. 

He made his first J.League 1 appearance at age 18 with JEF United Chiba, netting his first league goal a year later. He later moved to club Vegalta Sendai, where he once [scored two goals in under a minute in added time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBZhvxgnpHE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=54s&amp;ab_channel=%E9%AB%98%E5%B1%B1%E7%A5%A5%E5%AF%BF) to secure a draw for the club.

Since 2005 he has been a star at Sanfrecce Hiroshima, leading them to back to back titles in 2012 and 2013. His efforts won him both the J.League MVP and J.League Top goalscorer awards for the 2012 season.

##Why Should I Know Who He Is?

As mentioned earlier, Sato is one of the most prolific goalscorers in J.League history. He has scored 10 or more league goals in 11 consecutive seasons - a feat which only a few have accomplished:

Year|Club|Div|Apps|Gls
:--|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:
2004|Vegalta Sendai|2|44|**20**
2005|Sanfrecce Hiroshima|1|32|**18**

2013|---|1|34|**17**
2014|---|1|29|**11**
2015|---|1|17|**7**

Additionally, Sato currently holds the records for fastest J.League goal (8 seconds - Sanfrecce vs Cerezo - 2006) and most J.League Cup goals (28).  He has also won the J.League ""Fair Play Award"" three times (2007, 2012, 2013) and Japanese Player of the Year award once (2012).

His next feat will be surpassing Masahi Nakayama as the all-time J.League 1 Top Scorer. Sato currently sits at 153 goals, just four shy of Nakayama's 157. 

Sato has also earned 31 caps for the Japanese National Team.
