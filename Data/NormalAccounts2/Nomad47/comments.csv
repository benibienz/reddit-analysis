88,I have been playing dirty bomb on steam for several weeks now by and large it’s a great game. I have to say that the Phantom just sucks the fun right out of the game for me. I just had a round where I had 17 deaths and one kill because I was spawn camped by a two man phantom team. I like the idea of a stealth class particularly in a counter sniper roll but the need to be super rare. A few days ago when you occasionally had one on a team it was fine but when they run in packs and camp spawn point and objective Space-ninjas break the game.,2015-07-09 17:38:58+00:00,csxmojn,1,t3_3cjh9m,107563,Dirtybomb
