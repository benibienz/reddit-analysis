So I have been play MWO for the last two or three day and have been really enjoying it. I just finished my cadet grind and now have about 19 million credits and four Mec bays. My thought was to buy two of the raven variants and two of the Firestarter variants to start with and play as a light Mec specialist. Any thoughts on this from long time players would be greatly appreciated as the last time I played this game it was still pen and paper.
