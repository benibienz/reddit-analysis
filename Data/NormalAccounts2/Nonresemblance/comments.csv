1,"Exactly!! Everyone has different Threat Models so some threats doesn't apply for others! The closed-sourced baseband processor threat is probably still a wild card (as we don't really know what is going on in there) that it only applies those who *extremely* cares about their privacy and security.   
  
For me, I do care about my private information but if at the end of the day if they are leaked, it emotionally hurts but it is not that bad. I am more concern about mass surveillance and it seems to me that such surveillance is more targeted for the prevention of exposing such vulnerabilities on a mass scale.
  
Although, I can see more people needing a harden OS like Copperhead for the higher level threats but that is still not as extreme as worrying about the close-sourced baseband processor.

Not sure why you throw is in the description ""uncreative"" to both pet nerfs and petless realms. They can make more *other* creative content for the people with pets. It's not about creativity but the best solution in finding the middle ground your ""harder realms"" isn't addressing the actual issue here.

While I still think we shouldn't have any expectation that things will not change with DECA even if we have done wrong many times on different management, It is still nicer to warn us about what moderation changes they would make and that they will really enforce the ToS at the beginning.

Also, going a little off topic here: It is not that with a separated additional realm that those with pets have a unfair chance at soulbound, ***the normal realm portals still there to choose and at their biggest advantage.*** People with pets are not at a disadvantage. *It's also not really about giving people challenges but much more about giving those anti-pets individuals who want a more co-op experience* through the forced no reliance of pets which results in players help each other more. There is a difference here.   
  
If those pets players wants to play these petless realms maybe for challenge or loot, that's cool but I will repeat this, that is not really the point. I am not asking for an elder realm.  
  
**Maybe I am seeing from your point of view here wrong**, maybe the normal realms will be very full and the petless realm may be virtually empty that gives petless players advantage. I did notice that if pet players have good internet speed, they could always change server for emptier normal realms. But there is always those who don't have good internet speed.
    
I think **one possible solution** for this especially players with bad internet connection: there could be a algorithm that checks on the ratio between the petless realm and the normal realm with the lowest player count in that server periodically. Then with it will decide how much percentage of loot rates to be taken off (subtracted not added). if the petless:pet realm player count ratio is low, deduct from 100% (which will be multiplied with the whatever loot's drop rate get the final drop rate) but if the extreme opposite happens, it will remain at 100%. The nuance in the ratio will dictate the amount of deduction.  
  
**Alternatively**, as there are probably a lot less people that will want to go petless, only set up one petless realm in one of all servers of the same location. For example, you know there is USWest ,USWest2 , USWes3? Just set it up in USWest.     
  
Then it will periodically check in USWest if all current normal realms player count exceed a certain percentage (50-60%?) open a new normal realm. So in that way, even if the petless realms has low count, there always be normal realm that sort of matches the petless realm count.  
  
I do realized there are also many individual servers in different location of the same place especially in EU. The solution for it is that not all of them needs a petless realm, only in strategical locations that will cause the least lag from different locations.

115,"&gt;I don't like the ToS argument at all because we know that nobody reads those things,

A lot of ToS is legal and in our case, as I mentioned in the other comment, that they are private and have the moderation power to decide the extend free speech. Forcing users to agree with the ToS in the registration or when playing the game is also mostly legal too.   
  
More importantly, sure they could have did it better but I also don't think ethically-wise it's wrong to enforce ToS either. Take this example that If some were to book a tennis court or bowling alley that are owned by others. They then got kicked out after using them as they broke the rule. As a response to that, they complain that they did not read the rules because it's too long. Are the owners of these facilities are to be at fault for kicking them out just because they did not read the long rules? Legally, ethically and logically, I highly doubt so.     
   
I will also mentioned this again:    
  
&gt;I will upset if I join offensive guild and get banned for it since the warning is literally there, but I will accept it eventually as it's still pretty fair even only if it is till a certain extent  
  
Of course most people including myself hates reading it and doesn't really want read it. We can decide not read it because it is long but we cannot deny that we agreed to ToS. It's our fault if we didn't read as even if we really disagree:    
  
&gt;Because if I feel that the rules is ambiguous, I should have read all of it and raise it up in this subreddit *way before the bans.*  
  
Or don't register for the game or play it way before the bans, which effectively can indicate that one have huge disagreement with the ToS. Another words, it refers short period of registration where you have to agree to ToS. Same goes for the analogy for the Tennis court and bowling alley, they should have done what I have mentioned.
    
For this part:  
&gt;and shouldn't be penalized for not reading something that had no effect on gameplay when they signed up under Kabam.  
  
I said in my first comment in this comment chain here which I think is relevant here:  
  
&gt;And it's DECA not Kabam that are in charged, it's a change in management. Yes, we can speak up in this subreddit that it is a harsh punishment but we cannot expect that things will stay exactly the same as the old management's style of handling things.     
  
In this case, we it is illogical to assume that the ToS in the new management will be enforced exactly like under Kabam's management.  
  
I hope that these points doesn't come as harsh or aggressive. I only want to get I what I believe are the most rational points out about just the act of enforcement not the degree of enforcement. They are very possibly not perfect and I look forward to any possible rebuttals. I do hear you about the unfair severity of the bans and I totally agree with you on that part.

&gt;this DECA's game, it's their domain they have control over of. From my research, *freedom of speech in America is only uphold in the public realm*. Entities like games and forums are **private** have the freedom in moderation which legally includes what they see as hate speech. At least that is what the current extent of freedom of speech in US is seems like for now.  
  
So, the internet is free-for-all unless you are in a private medium that doesn't agree with your speech.  
  
Edit: And also it doesn't matter if it's on the internet or in real life, if they make such speech they will be frowned upon by others. And to deal with it by doing nothing can be shitty way of handling things, it's like letting them get the better of you especially you are going through a hard time. [*There is Freedom of Speech but it doesn't mean there is (edit: no) consequences.*](https://i.reddituploads.com/3d59e73dc8ff40c4be73b469dc71b2d7?fit=max&amp;h=1536&amp;w=1536&amp;s=4d77a836b3597aa53d5ce275a3ce5bc2) (Credits to /u/anojikewl for the reference.)

135,"I am sure if people found out that one work for KKK, *while that is not illegal, many these people won't be too happy that person is supporting them* and in my comparison, that includes is working for them just for the benefits. I am also sure people have the freedom in America to affiliate any suspicious individuals to the racists. Note that I am only talking about affiliation and not necessarily any other actions that may come with that. Many people, including myself, do not want their reputation in general to be potentially **tarnished** by working for them.
  
Which brings back to another point of mine that this DECA's game, it's their domain they have control over of. From my research, *freedom of speech in America is only uphold in the public realm*. Entities like games and forums are **private** have the freedom in moderation which legally includes what they see as hate speech. At least that is what the current extent of freedom of speech in US is seems like for now.  
  
In the case of DECA, as we all saw the official statement, they only allow some freedom of speech as they state that really don't like hate speech just like with many people. Also, such affiliations are part of what they constitute as hate speech too. And together with their moderation powers, it just really shows how the bans became so severe.  
    
I am for the punishment of racism as hate speech is wrong and punishment for for being an affiliations as they brings up suspicions that they are racist or just disrespectful trolls. I am glad that many players of this game feels the same way too although the severity of it as we all saw have been rightfully disputed.

138,"&gt;Tasteless jokes are all too common on the internet. I'm sure no one seriously thinks that this stupid guild was actually about ""eliminating Jews"" or whatever.   
  
Just because it's common to troll doesn't mean that that we should not cautious of being part of such groups. Two points here:

* Real racists can always pretend they are just trolling or join the guild for the keys. 
* And there is also [Pole's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe's_law).  
   * /r/the_donald started off as a troll forum, not serious subreddit and what did it become now? Real obnoxious Trump supporters end up joining them! The same concept could be used for this guild too.    
  
*Because of these two points even if one join for trolling or key openings and not for racism, the person are still at risk of being affiliated to the real racists*. Additionally, I personally won't want to join such offensive guild either just for non-serious trolling as it [*still can be very rude*](https://i.imgur.com/n8umjWj.png) and I don't want (edit: to be viewed) by others that I am some edgy 14 year old troll.

They can be wrong and I think the three things we could sadly only do is to: as I mentioned, speak out against what is wrong like what we did in this post, buy less gold and/or (especially after a period of expressing discontent) quit.   
    
There is also an counter argument for the harsh punishment is that DECA right now has limited resources (time, money and manpower) to implement and maintain an incremental punishment system. I see some of their point but feel that is still much more professional to maintain such system regardless of resources available. They will not get as much negativity when they have a clearer and fairer punishment system like that.

140,"I do appreciate that you tried called out the real racists here and do agree the punishments are too harsh.
  
But for your third and last paragraph:  
  
&gt;The new guild's name was ""JewElimination"". Me and my friend were guild hopping, and we didn't like the people in the guild particularly, but we decided to join ""JewElimination"" anyways, because we didn't want to pass up free tomb keys. This guild only lasted a short time as well.  
  
&gt;In our defense, the reason lots of us thought this was okay is because when these guilds were punished when Kabam owned the game, the guild's names were just changed. The members were not permanently IP banned. Also, we were just guild hopping and as our guildmates made new guilds, we would just go along with them to the new guild. If we had joined the new guild ""JustBaileyThings"" only a few hours prior to us going to sleep that night, we wouldn't be banned right now. Again, I am not looking to be unbanned, I only wanted to get the story out.   
    
I won't be job hopping into a KKK organization as a clerk for example just because they have great wage and benefits. *No ones to be affiliated with the KKK. Same goes for this, although it is milder, it's still murky waters, you might still get into trouble one way or another which you all did.* [ I made a huge comment essay on it on another post and I encourage you to read it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RotMG/comments/4yasb1/deca_taking_a_stand/d6mmso9?context=3) That comment covers in greater detail why we should be sensible before we join an guild with an offensive name even if you are dragged into it or there is free keys and also, there are warnings which is the ToS in the registration.  
  
And it's DECA not Kabam that are in charged, it's a change in management. Yes, we can speak up in this subreddit that it is a harsh punishment but we cannot expect that things will stay exactly the same as the old management's style of handling things.   
  
I am sorry that I will not be covering your comments in this post as there are really a lot of them. But do bring them or other arguments up if you see fit as I may miss out some other points while thinking through this and I look forward to them.

143,"I can't really say the first sentence isn't true, I see your point. We can try point it out when something is wrong even if absolute power is out our hands. At least we have some speaking power from our monetary support to this game right? Another thing we could do is to quit which I did back then when functional pets came out and was here to stay. However, that is off topic at least for now.  

**But about your second paragraph:**
&gt; How would you feel if you were guild hopping/joining a friend's guild and got banned for it? Oh wait, let me guess. From way up high atop your pedestal you shout to me, ""But I wouldn't do that! I'm not a racist!"", and all I can do is shake my head because I know that you have not been in such a position and you were likely lucky enough or smart enough to avoid getting into that position in the first place. 

It's a fallacy that you are assuming me of what I am will react the exactly same way if I have the same fate. But, as I said above, the ToS or another words, the warnings is literally there in the registration.  [The ban email in the other threat did say ToS was violated too.](https://i.redd.it/7f0lugc10xfx.png) That is why I brought it out and to point to the origins of my argument in this paragraph..

**And about your first part of your third paragraph:**  
&gt; I truly do feel bad for the people who could care less what the guild name was and joined it because it was active, had their friends, opened keys, etc etc. 
  
If you join a offensive guild, ***you are in murky waters***. I don't totally see your point in this one although I would rather see temporary bans here (I'm sure you will definitely agree with me on this one ) [if we are actually seeing the full picture.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RotMG/comments/4ya42c/anyone_think_deca_overreacted_here/d6mc3s2) Together with the ToS warning argument, [I posted this argument which I commented on the other post which I think it's relevant too](https://www.reddit.com/r/RotMG/comments/4ya42c/anyone_think_deca_overreacted_here/d6mekhz):    
&gt; 
&gt; But by being in the guild is you are affiliating yourself to the name and it can be assumed that you agree to that name. 
&gt;   
&gt; It's like being a clerk in the KKK organization who just want a wage and/or for their ***great*** benefits and do not want believe in their ideology. Literally everyone *will* assume that person to be part of the KKK and no one in their right mind will join the organization just for the wage or their benefits because of the huge controversy behind it.   
&gt;   
&gt; Same for DECA. In this case, while this is slightly milder, they will assume you are racist.  
&gt;   
&gt; And also as I said in another comment:  
&gt;   
&gt; &gt; And your bad reason can be use by racists that could suddenly just pretends that the name means something else when such bans happens. 
&gt;   
&gt; In your case, racist(s) can pretend that one did not agree with the name when bans happen.  
&gt;   
&gt; **You should have saw the warning sign in the name and leave the guild.**  
  
To be consistent against on what I said about assumptions: I am not saying that the banned players are definitely racists but joining such guild as my analogy pointed out above will put you at risk.   
       
**For your last part:**   
&gt;All I'm saying is that we should all try to see it from both sides, while not advocating racism, because I do believe that punishment and deleting the guild was necessary, just not in the way that they chose to do so.   
  
I agree on the punishment and deletion part and only partly agree on way they chose to do it: It will be better for them to have incremental temporary banning system but there is already a warning system via ToS. I have also tried to see the other side of the debate but don't think that party really have substantial arguments for it from all I said. I tried to proofread my rebuttal multiple times and I hope they are substantial reasonings to my points. I hope you will consider them and I look forward to hear any rebuttals from you or anyone else to this post (Edit: Although I may not reply as I am tired as of this edit). That being said, thank you for participating our constructive debate. Have a wonderful day.  
  
**PS:** After re-reading the first and second rebuttal paragraph for the second time, *I wonder should we be lenient to them since they are just kids and probably don't know better?* **I find it as a good way for teaching them that you don't always get what you want**. But you pick it up from there and learn your mistakes and to know what is the proper way approach life in my opinion: to be careful in your decisions, read warnings and to have cultural and moral sensitivity. **Saying all that, I am still an enormous hypocrite and still learning how to handle my rough life properly.**  
    
I am also still bummed out that my old archer died recently. After that death I know for the fact that I know some of the dangers back then but I was ignorant when I came back , however, that is not an excuse for me. I had to learn from my mistakes that this game is still pretty hardcore; that I should be conservative in playing and read guides on dangers and warnings warnings of all of the realm's environment.  
  
I feel mentally drained after typing this whole post out, that is all I have to say. And again, have a great day.

Just take Runescape for an example, they are players who paid the game and spend many hours paying it. However Jagex will still have the authority to publish controversial updates such as the removal of wilderness, the addition of evolution of combat or making runecrafting so much easier (which devalues their *huge* amount of time spent on training on the now inferior training methods). Players paid so they say don't they? Well not quite because it is Jagex's game in the end, they can do want they want and have the final say on changes.  
    
And you said like functional pets saved Rotmg, **I am sorry but that is not the only way to sustain a game.** People did get more content from Kabam's profits but are they of quality? I rather have this game to *focus more on aesthetic micro-transactions and while earning less money, sustain the game and make quality content*.   
  
At least now DECA wants to focus more on quality than quantity however it is also clear that they don't want to fear losing part of the user base by nerfing certain controversial content immediately as I mentioned previously. That is fine with me as I said, they own the game. I do hope that they won't forget the old players like me whether be it the ones who stay all the way or the ones who recently came back and make changes that we desire like the petless realms idea. I will still respectfully quit if changes that I wished for is not met but for now we will have to wait and see.",2016-08-17 01:45:20+00:00,d6kkbw7,3.0,t1_d6jzxyt,27639.0,RotMG
166,"This may be going to be downvoted here but I find it a bit sad that people really favors pets but that is just from my bias that this game should be more hardcore and co-op oriented. I quit about 3 years ago because of all those changes that kabam made and OP pets are one major part of the reason. I was brought in by the hype and my false assumption that DECA is going to undo Kabam changes that I dislike. However, I recently seen the DECA AMA  which mentioned that they doesn't really want to touch on the pets makes me even more pessimistic.  
  
Hey, maybe they will release a petless realm in each server and/or make some big updates that I will really like? (E.g. ST nerfs, class balancing issues, OT buffs and so on.)

172,"Hey there, I came back recently due to the change in management and I am pretty old school. I don't support these pets (and some STs) at all, that's why I quit in the first place. It's sad that the consensus is now towards ""No pet nerf/removal"" and I get it, pets and p2w elements have been in the game for so long that people have accustomed to those. I don't really think it will definitely kIlls the game if such nerfs are implemented, I mean when Kabam introduced P2W elements, did the player count drops to 0 within the next few months? It didn't. Sure there will be backlash and some people quitting but you guys don't have to be so dramatic. With the right new content additions, changes and marketing, I'm sure they will survive the backlash.  

Nobody remembers this game was used to be called ""the co-op fantasy multiplayer shooter"" and I assumed that title has been removed as Kabam doesn't want the game to be associated with that. It's sad that priest and necromancer is mostly virtually forgotten and I wish more of the co-op elements are back through removal or nerf of such overpowered elements.  

I wish DECA will balance the game better and focus more on aesthetic microtransactions. I guess we still have to wait and see about that since they still pretty new. But if these things that I don't support continues to persist in the game, I'll probably quit again. (That Steambird Alliance game looks pretty sweet and from what I heard they don't want to count on gameplay-affecting microtransactions)

They (not just the top) are not helping much either by afking although I can imagine the top player to be used for baiting.

I wonder if they could just have two bases for each side, one base per corner, they could randomly spawn in either areas and maybe even a portal for existing players to hop between bases.

I agree with someone else's idea that it should be kept simple. Take for example, Realm of the Mad God's buyable textures are pretty simple and it blends well with their other simple graphics (I am not their shape-shifting skins though, as that might give an advantage since we may not recognise the shapes. But re-texturing is still okay since you can recognise their persistent shapes.)  
  
Ability to disable skins is also okay, but if they don't want to include that options because they want boost the sales of aesthetics microtransactions just like what Counter Strike: Global Offensive is doing, I can understand that. They are not affecting gameplay unless they increases lag in certain computers.

394,"Two suggestions:  
   
* When you enter the last skill point that you have with keyboard shortcut, the skills side panel should stay visible for an extra 1 to 2 seconds instead of closing immediately.  
    
* Add a pre-game skill menu so that you could increase your skills before re-entering the game. This is so that when you spawn, will won't get killed when  you increase your skills after just re-entering. The initial invincibility helps a bit for escaping but does not really aid the downtime you have when you increase your skills  
  
Edit1:  
  
* Another suggestion: please don't add more classes and balance out the existing ones! I understand it's for attracting more players and foster retention but in my opinion that is only good for the short term while class balancing goes further.

He is always trending and discussed about on youtube, reddit and etc. Like what you have said, that resulted in people looking up to him, seeking for his opinions.  
  
For me that has gotten pretty annoying as he has sort of become a ""official"" reviewer of music by popular vote. His big influence of people's opinions on music makes it feels like his opinions should matter greatly. That would explain why I blocked him with addons on youtube I guess.  
  
And both of you are right, his reviews are rather generic just like many of the reviewers out there. But I guess that there is only so much you could talk about. I think his popularity comes from the fact that he is using a somewhat new medium where you can see him in face verbally talking about the music through a video rather than reading music review articles' text. And through this medium, he able to connect to the audience more, probably.

1088,"I think the video and the title doesn't really help explain the context well.  

Correct me if I got anything wrong in the summary of what happened:  

1. Skill Specs teleported to castle wars and Rot were there.  
  
2. Of course they started attacking and Skill Specs decided to tank with sharks and prayer pots for 30minutes+.
  
3. Viewers at twitch took notice started to amassed people to help, spamming the chat. 
  
4. About after half way point of the tanking there are some people who dared enter/teleport into castle wars, most of them died. RIP
  
5. About at the end of the skull timer after a number of hesitations, Skill Specs finally started to make his way to Yanille. And of course Rot went after him; hitting and ice barraging whenever was possible.  
  
6. I still remember that when he was crossing the bridges his clan started rushing in to attack Rot. Holy shit that was the beginning of the fun part for me.  
  
7. And then when he gets closer and closer to Yanille, more and more people (many of them are from purple army, bmo and AC) were present to defend him. Literally clan wars broke out!
  
8. Finally as we seen in the video he made it through!  
  
So 9 hours later it's still so fresh and exciting in my mind. As I said before, I'm so glad to watched through the malaise of the tanking and seeing the great conclusion at the end.

Then it got into this big fight with Tony Blair’s advisors and a whole black mail scenario ensued. We were in the midst of the Iraq War and The Big Ask campaign was proving very successful. So Blair said: ‘‘I should meet this guy’’. **Then Blair’s advisors tried to blackmail me, saying: ‘‘if you don’t agree to meet the Prime Minister, Friends of the Earth will be denied all access to him.’’** because of the Iraq war, I didn’t want to do it. I felt it was morally unacceptable for me to be photographed with Blair. That was the last time I got involved in such a way. But I would do it again if it felt right.

That is transferable knowledge. That is ***some*** similar applications (but as I mentioned not all) even when both games are very different in other aspects.   
  
I know things like bailing out to the nexus at the right time to prevent death in ROTMG needs skills but at the beginning you need the theoratical (yet practical) knowledge of the existence of doing that action before practicing to get better at doing that action or in another words, honing your skills.

1306,"&gt;In Realm you can hit level 20 and be at least somewhat relevant to most content in under an hour. It takes MUCH longer to have the stats/gear to be able to fight even medium level content in RS, especially if you don't safespot.  

Their level 20 is really isn't much and you will die easily, you need alot pernament stats pots if you really want to do decent in that game and these potions are not that easy to get in bundle.   
  
&gt;The core difference is that in Realm your ""progress"" is measured by how far you take a character and what YOU learned in the process. You, the player, are not learning anything from chopping willows back up to 60 woodcutting for the 3rd time today.   
   
I think you are right to a certain extend, yes runescape is so automated that there doesn't seems to require skills. But, in we can learn transferable tips and tricks on how to get more money or gain stats quickly, for example the DDM moneymaking guide by a friend by stealling silk. Same goes for ROTMG, I know more skills are needed to doge bullets but the knowledge of getting stats up or money (pernament stats pot in that game are their currency as they don't have any formal currency) quickly is also I think similar to my previous example. One such knowledge  in that game is going to godlands and killing the gods for fast obtainment of stats pots (especially def pots,they are valuable).

1331,"Hopefully I am not trying to imply that I hate these technologies or computer music or against people using them because as a programmer and technology enthusiast (for many parts at least), I know and appreciate how essential and useful modern technologies is to the society of today. One small example is that without the internet and modern computer, I won't be able to listen to most of the guitar gear demos out there. Also, I like listen to quite a bit of electronica and hip hop and I also a big fan of Radiohead/Thom yorke/Jonny Greenwood who uses all kinds of old and new technologies/tools. (This is not really relate but, assuming if you are interested in Radiohead, [check out Jonny Greenwood's opinion's on his new found appreciation for live orchestras and the distinction he makes of it with recordings](http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/jun/13/jonny-greenwood-radiohead-classical-music-live-performance?CMP=twt_gu). Also check out on his crazy but awesome solo orchestra work!)  
   
&gt; They're all just tools. Pick the tool for the job and play what inspires you.  
   
That's true and the placement of the word ""and"" is important as we can't go on without knowing what we need and want at the same time or what really matters the most to us as individual musicians.   
    
I feel that my own way of creating music do matter to me as mixing some of these newer (digital) technologies *honestly* leaves me a sour taste as I would ask myself ""What's the point of this, why not just use the latest and greatest music technologies like the latest music creation software?"". I guess for me, as mentioned, I guess I am just going to pull a Jack White here and sticking to (but not necessarily) analog and older technological ways/roots of doing things on the guitar(or other traditional instruments). It doesn't really matter if those ways are not as reliable and convenient as what matters most to me is what is the most comfortable and makes the ""truest sense"" to me (And again, yes I know my reasoning may not makes sense to others).   
  
***All that being said that, there is nothing right or wrong with mine's, your's or anybody else's opinions and way of making music, as you have mentioned***   
   
I guess that is all I have to say and man, that took awhile to write as articulate as I possibly could. I really thank you for your point of view and I really appreciate that and I hope you have a nice day.  ",2015-10-27 15:57:39+00:00,cwep39y,3.0,t1_cwek0fl,8011.0,Guitar

**BE-WARNED: POTENTIALLY OFFENCE VIEWPOINT BELOW:**

Does anyone get existential crisis of playing guitars or ""traditional"" musical instruments in general? I mean computer programs could probably emulate accurately guitars, amps and it'e effect pedals. Even if my previous statement is not 100% true as of now, I think there is enough foundations from technological advancements to invent more sophisticate software to emulate ""traditional"" musical instruments more accurately.  
  
I know there is the ""playing for the experience of these musical instruments"" augment, well I get only *some* their point as it sometimes sounds a little trivial for me.   
  
Maybe I should just stick more to ""the analog roots"" of the electric guitar, although not necessarily totally old school technologies, instead of going for digital route (Yes I know these technologies are much more capable than the analog counterpart). Yes, I know my previous sentence may not makes sense to many and possiblity contradicts my previous paragraph but at least it makes some sense to me in response to the problem.

I'm not saying that it's wrong to like PVM but I feel there needs to be a balance in the development of the game.

25 million seems like a lot but we don't know what is an accurate prediction of the rate of using the teleports.  
   
Maybe players save up on the teleports and use fairy rings although that means less money per hour ~~although the decrease may be small~~. If they do save up, it will slow down the the rate burning through the teleport's supply.
