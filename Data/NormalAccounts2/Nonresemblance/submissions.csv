* It prevents top rank from staying in that position for too long.
* Average highscores will be pretty low as the result of top players getting killed off quickly.
* A little less incentive to get to the top rank as that rank lasts pretty shortly.
 * Some will try to stay below top rank but since top rank is potentially killed off quickly, these tanks will get forcefully pushed up anyway.  
 * Alternatively, some people may even start to ignore top rank and maybe even others because of they don't want to get pushed up there. Although I think people will get bored fast and eventually kill them.

Apologies that I have not elaborated further.  
Beta world(s) is only opened for a few days/weeks before it's estimated release of a update. This would probably save some money.    
  
It is also a separate client download so that it will not mixed with the main game's program and it will be good for people who wants to play the main and beta worlds side by side.

And then during 2008, if I'm not wrong, 15 step in the scotch mist webcast or generally that whole webcast itself made me a fan of Radiohead after some listens. I did not dwell into music that much at that time but something about the webcast just sounded so original to me.

Of course I have been listening to the band ever since. Kid A is really nice too but even till this day, In Rainbows is probably my favourite Radiohead album. Can't wait for LP9.
