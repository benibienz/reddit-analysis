the gods I know of that we have either seen/delt with or heard of.

Y'Sharrj - Super Dead, Sha was the result of his death in Pandaria

N'zoth - Under the Ocean someplace?

_________________

I Put ""Dead?"" for this reason. It is stated that the actual death of an old god can have devastating effects on the planet and make the  land uninhabitable, as seen with the Death of Y'Sharrj and the creation of the mist and the sha.
from what I can tell the ""Death"" of Yogg'saron and C'thun, for now at least, is that there wasn't really any negative effects from their deaths aside form them just not being relevant anymore. so my first Question is this.

* Are C'thun and Yogg really dead or did we just 'Reseal' them? 

__________________

My other Questions are these

* Who is Left?

N'zoth and he is presumed under the ocean right?

I am under the impression also that there are 5 Old gods on Azeroth in total, and that sargeras himself being a titan, would rather avoid them.
