11,"Trinkets are a huge problem at the moment for almost every dps class, cause of all the ilvls spreading arround. I would say sim your char. I have a blood-dk (offspec for our raid is frost with ilvl 871), and I really like the darkmoon deck (they are normally always in the top 5) + the trinket from maw of souls (can't remember the name, something with angerma or so, it gives you a random sec. stat).

The next problem with frost dk are the different playstyles (with obli or without). My frost dk is high on crit and on mastery, so I'm running without obli, means that for me haste is not so important and I go more for crit &amp; mastery.

Frost dk is (what I think) very wired at the moment, but I hope I could help you a bit.

well, like I said, I'm looking for a new MMO for me to play. I'm an older player (not 16 anymore), so I'm looking for a kind of relaxing mmo.

I'm open for nearly anything, playing the Division (I know not a 100% MMO) right now on my xbox one and I enjoyed playing on Nostalrius (a wow-private vanilla server which is about to get shut down, cause Blizzard want's it).
