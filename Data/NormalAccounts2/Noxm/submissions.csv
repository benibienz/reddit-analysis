I switched main (had a warrior last addon) to blood dk and I really enjoy the tanking stuff. But here and there I would like to play a caster like back in bc where I played mage and lock. I really liked the simple mechanics, like spaming shadowbolt all the time and stuff like that.

We have a mythic+ group and since last week (where we did maw of souls +10) we have a random shadowpriest in that. His dmg is really outstanding and all the multidotting sounds like real fun. So I boosted my level 90 discipline priest (I really liked the playstyle in wod as a smiter). Now the shadowpriest is 110 and I went into the twinkraid yesterday, and that was the point where all the frustration comes. 

If you wanna laugh, here is the link to the log: https://www.warcraftlogs.com/rankings/character/18646089/latest

Shadowpriest just feels totally hectic and uncontroled in the playstyle, so now I'm thinking about leveling something with a not so stressful prioritylist/playstyle. I checked different casters but nothing sounds really relaxing.

So maybe you guys can help me out.

Thanks in advance,

I have a kind of problem. I have 3 chars (dk, war,druid) on 110 and I don't know which one I should focus on. I have to say first, that I focus on mythic+ and not on raids, cause I'm a shiftworker but I can raid with my guild if there is time (but then not in tankspec normally).

Dk: http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/frostwolf/Onlynxm/simple

The DK is with ilvl 849 really good geared and I love the transmog. In mythicdungeons I sometimes feel a little bit squishy when I pull a little bit more and I really hate the mobility (cause there is no mobility!) the BR is a big + for mythic.

Warrior: http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/frostwolf/Noxxm/simple

Dinged 110 yesterday. Love the transmog aswell (normally T3) and I love the mobility (the jumping and chargeing). I'm just not sure if warrior is good for mythic+ but what I hear he is pretty solid. Problem is here almost no artifactpower and no gear (I can but some stuff from the AH but I'm not sure if that's enough). Rotation feels a little bit more complicated then dk.

Druid: http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/frostwolf/NÃ´xm/simple

Dinged 110 a couple of days ago but it feels very boring playing him. I really like the style of my transmog and the claws look amazing but infight you just see the bear. :( And really no gear, just a little bit mobility (more then dk but less then warrior). I played the druid last expensions as a healer which I enjoyed alot but the tank feels just like boring in heroics.


Maybe someone can give me some good arguments to help me out.

Thanks in advance and sorry for my bad english (no native speaker),

well, I have a Kind of ""first world Problem"" with Legion, but first things first. 

I have 2 Accounts (which can not be merged), but both are my accounts.

Account 1 has a Paladin with full Paladin and Warrior T3 and Ashbringer, yes the corrupted one, Swift Spectral Tiger, the Onyxia Mount and ""Hand of Adal"".

Account 2 has the Scarablord-title, the Mount, the Brown Drake (from the T7,5 Content), some realmfirsts (ulduar and pdok), a Warrior with full T3 &amp; a MoP CM Druid.

I'm a Little bit bored with the Paladin playstyle and I really like tanking and healing (healing in raids with the druid) and especially tanking the small Group Content like dungeons. I really enjoyed this addon the gladiatorstance, cause I really enjoyed that playstyle (and flexibility of tanking and dpsing).

So  Transmog 2.0 offers so many Options, now I really don't know which Account I should Play with what char as main. I also thought about a blook DK tank with ashbringer or a warrior with ashbringer.
