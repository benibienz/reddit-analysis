0,"I have a similar situation to you. Your hair might be slightly different than mine, but what works for me is to put on a hat as your hair dries. Once it's dried, it will look VERY flat, so just run your fingers through it the break it apart a little and get some more volume. Of course this means you won't be able to blow dry it, but if your hair is like mine, you'll get enough volume anyway. And as an extra plus, if you don't shampoo your hair in the shower you don't have to use product either. 
It can be time consuming though because your hair will take 1+ hours to dry completely. But the result is surprisingly good, very flexible and reworkable but the shape will hold because your hair has set into shape under the hat",2016-11-06 18:40:12+00:00,d9ofhu0,1,t3_5bfv69,16465,malehairadvice

We're playing a goddamn children's party game, take a step back and question how much this really matters.

I could write more but I couldn't much less give a fuck about unnecessary hate bandwagons like this thread. People are blowing this way out of proportion. ""Sky needs to be more professional!"" Boo hoo go back to league you fucking normie
