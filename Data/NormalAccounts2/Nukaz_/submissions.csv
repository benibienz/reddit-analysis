[shitty comparison gif](https://gfycat.com/FortunateFeistyAngelwingmussel)

I was wondering recently why some heroes died more consistently than others after getting hooked in. The main reason, aside from hitbox size, is that some heroes get pulled in closer than others do.

If you stop and think about it for a moment, have you ever missed a meat shot on a Soldier, Torb or Lucio after hooking them in? Probably not. Now, can you remember a time you missed an Ana or McCree? I know i can, and i never realized why until now.

Another reason this is a problem is because the place where a hero gets set down after a hook seems to be constant, no matter how close you are to the hero. So, if you are closer to the hero then the set-down point, the hero will actually pull away from you instead of staying in place. This causes even more buggy interactions as you can imagine. I could make a gif as an example but I think you probably get the point.

The solution to this is pretty self-explanatory I think.",Competitiveoverwatch,the REAL fix that hook needs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/56k86d/the_real_fix_that_hook_needs/

So, I created a deck that uses Reno as well as some other charge and battlecry minions to set up a infinite where you can fully heal each turn while dealing constant chip damage. 

Once Maexxna has a full board, she can no longer play any more minions, and as long as the board doesn't deal 30 damage per turn, you can play Reno to fully heal any damage that was done. Along with Reno you play a charge minion, both of which will be sent back to your hand to be used on the next turn, and so on until Maexxna is dead. 

Hope this helps anyone who struggled with this fight!

I'm at about a 50% winrate with it right now, but it is kinda draw dependent and inconsistent. When you get your cycle going it works pretty well, especially playing on curve and pairing taunts and draw together on the same turn or alternating every other turn.

Basically the goal is drawing the combo pieces while getting garbage and taunts on the board to stall and pick away some damage at the same time, enough that the combo can actually kill. Usually the finishing combo ends up being 18 - 24 damage by turn 8 or so. But it can do a 30+ damage burst pretty easily with Thaurissan or if the game lasts long enough and you've drawn enough combo pieces.

I think the first cut would be the flametongues for a crackle or something but I haven't tested it yet. I've also found hex can screw things over sometimes trying to get a combo through so I don't run it. 

If you have any good suggestions for this list it would be much appreciated!
