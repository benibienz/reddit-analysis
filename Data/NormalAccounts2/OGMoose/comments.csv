2,"Just wondering, but why not? Brees has only missed 1 game to injury in his whole career. He is also on pace for 5200 yds and 40 tds this year. 

Edit: Brees did in fact destroy his shoulder with the Chargers, but that was during the last game of the season and he ended up signing with the Saints that Offseason, so he technically missed 0 games due to injury with the Chargers. ",2016-11-21 02:47:54+00:00,da90d5m,3.0,t1_da8x33x,4721.0,nfl

Best/Funniest Story was probably me coming back down from 15 at the 2 minute warning. This was very early on in the year and was in the playoffs in h2h. I don't really remember if the teams were mismatched, but I do remember me failing an onside kick. My opponent tried to run it back and ended up fumbling. I then scored plus the 2 point conversion and was only down 7 points, but I had to kick. This around time I only had about 30 seconds left in the game. I had no timeouts so I was banking on this onside kick and a hailmary to tie the game. Well as expected I did both successfully. I was going crazy! So as I was feeding off the adrenaline my dumbass decided to go for two lol Anyways the dude picked it off and ran it back for a score to end the game :( ",2016-05-21 21:54:42+00:00,d3ejq03,1.0,t3_4kfj9e,2002.0,MaddenUltimateTeam

981,"Take life seriously. I was a pretty happy kid up until highschool until I got into a big funk. I honestly didn't know why the hell I started to look at life differently. Simply put I just didn't care anymore. I turned into a (what I believed to be) a bad person. I experimented with a few drugs (nothing to crazy), and after my grade started to plummet and I was giving attitude to everyone I knew, my mother started to notice me change and eventually gave me that advice. The way she delivered it to me was a little more emotional/personal, but It really did hit me hard. My self realization that I had to take life seriously ended up helping me tremendously. I finished school with a pretty good gpa, and tried to enjoy life as much as I could from then on. Every now and then I get back into a funk, or I guess you could call it ""depression"", but I remember that I still have a long way in life to go, and to enjoy it I have to take life seriously.

Hey Madden Fans,

Last week we told you that Season 1 of Draft Champions Ranked was coming to a close and detailed what the Season-ending rewards structure looked like. But now let’s take a deeper dive into what is changing with Season 2 because it’s much more than incrementing the Season number by a single digit! 

Placement Matches

Let’s start with Placement Matches. For anyone who has yet to play 5 games of Draft Champions Ranked, you’ll start Season 2 by competing in Placement Matches. These games will allow us to understand your level of play in Madden NFL 16 and matchmaker you more accurately once you get out of this phase. Better matchmaking will produce more competitive games which is something we’re always striving to achieve.

Ranking Thresholds

When taking a look at the data from Season 1, we noticed that users were not progressing as quickly as we intended, even when the user’s games played and overall record should suggest otherwise. So we’ve adjusted the ranking thresholds to allow users to advance at a more optimal rate. 

Converting Season 2 Rank

As you begin playing Season 2, you’ll most likely notice that your rank has changed and there’s a couple of reasons why. For starters, just as we’re doing in Placement Matches, we want to alter your rank based on how you did in Season 1 to group you with other players with the same skill level in order to allow for better matchmaking. Also, keeping in mind with what we mentioned before about update the ranking thresholds, some users may notice that they actually rank forward from Season 1. In the case of some of our more elite users from Season 1, you’ll notice that your rank has gone down and while you will have a bit of head start on the competition, you’ll have to prove yourself once again if you want to make it back to the Elite tier.

New Season, New Tournament

Season 1 of Draft Champions Ranked let us identify the top Madden players and qualify them for the Madden Challenge.  The Madden Challenge Online Playoffs was a fierce and fun weekend that produced a lot of excitement and showed off our community broadcasters.  While we aren’t ready to launch another live tournament series … yet … Season 2 will culminate with an online tournament. The full details of this tournament will be discussed further in a future blog but it’s important to know that playing and winning games as soon as Season 2 drops will be counting towards your progress. Rewards for the tournament will also be expressed in a future blog but they will include some spectacular in-game content.  Competitors who advance beyond the Season 2 ladder and place high in the online tournament will be considered for future Madden Invitationals during the 2016 calendar year.

Stay locked in. It’s always #MaddenSeason.",2016-02-18 19:17:51+00:00,d04usmp,1.0,t3_46geva,95.0,MaddenUltimateTeam

I usually post a buttload of updated content to keep the community in touch with whats going on (i.e. totw/fo players/stats and updates from guru or shautz). I also try to voice the subs problems through social media (like the rttp/superlative armstead comparison) which got a lot of support on twitter. I don't usually do giveaways, mainly because I'd rather help someone directly who actually contributes to the sub. I'm not the greatest madden player, but I try to give advice when possible. I also try my best to support those who stream here on twitch/youtube (sly, worms, mutogteam, and others).

1450,"This question is kind of hard for me since I still consider myself young and I havent really submerged into the adult world. However when I think of advice, I'm kind of judging it based off of my past mistakes. First thing is that education IS important. I slacked off in highschool my first year and it really hurt my gpa. Now I was lucky to pick up the slack with some AP/IB courses that allowed me to substantially raise it in the next few years. Im not going to say don't have any fun with your friends, but really manage your time well. This was something I personally had a bunch of trouble with, but once I managed it my life became much easier. Going on to college is a humongous step that many people aren't ready for ( I sure wasn't lol), but its worth it. The cost of college is something that many people stuggle with, but things like community college and even financial aid can help get you closer to earn that degree that could possibly help your future. Im still on my journey to make the most out of my life, but I hope whoever else reads this can pass on this message. Also, Thanks for the giveaway!
