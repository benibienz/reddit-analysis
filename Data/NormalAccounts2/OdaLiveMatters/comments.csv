1,"It's completely misunderstanding either use of the word paradise.

Here this is the first time Oda is showing a different perspective of the Grand Line. Every other time it's mentioned in East Blue it's as this horrifying place where pirates die.

Oda then introduces the idea for the first time that for brave people like Zeff and Luffy, instead of horror it's a chance at great adventures. The paradise of someone like Luffy. 

Later on, way later on. We are told that the informal name of the first half of the Grand Line is ""Paradise"". Why? Because in comparison to the New World it's so much less dangerous, that's the explanation given. It's a nickname based on how horrible the New World is. So it's a completely different use of the term here. It's hyping up New World.

2,"It's not about attacking the quality of Oda's writing. It's about reading comprehension. Idiots like you will think that the term paradise means the same thing in both of these situations, people who have good reading comprehension like me have understood that it doesn't mean the same thing, context is different.",2016-10-21 20:27:24+00:00,d928s9d,3,t1_d928fmj,471,OnePiece
3,"If Zeff had told Luffy ""The first half of the grandline is often refered to as Paradise"" or something along those lines, it would have been a different scenario. The term ""Grand Line"" refers to both the First Half (""Paradise"") AND The New World, wich people often seem to often forget. I think Zeff was refering to both, and how the Grand Line is a ""Paradise"" for those who seek great adventures.

4,"At that point of the story Oda didn't even have the New world in mind. At that time Grand Line= Grand Line as a whole, the dangerous sea that everyone was talking about. The Paradise was clearly refering to people like Luffy who enjoy Grand Line for his craziness, not the people who were wrunning out the New world. Hell, since then we haven't even seen people going back to Grand Line. And New world has a lot of weakling and normal citizens and they don't leave the New world. It's not that terrible.

5,"It doesn't have the same meaning tho. ""Paradise"" in Zeff's words meant that there are people like Luffy who love adventures and fun so Grand line is like a Paradise for them. Then we have people like the ones who left the New world and these people call Grand Line a ""paradise"" because  it's a lot more safer and less dangerous than the New world.",2016-10-21 19:28:28+00:00,d9262fp,1,t3_58p2mb,441,OnePiece

12,"&gt; voting the newest arc as the best/favorite arc

I see it's still a thing. I don't get why people are so insecure. Dressrosa was the new ""Best/favorite"" arc and look where it is now. Seriously, Zou is a good arc but it is objectively not as good as the best arcs of One Piece like Alabasta, Water Seven, Shabondy, Impel Down or Skypiea",2016-08-15 08:14:17+00:00,d6i2ucn,1,t3_4xp5wm,51972,OnePiece
