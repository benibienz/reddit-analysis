I've been reading this manga weekly since Thriller Bark, yet I have never cried while reading it. The anime made me laugh and cry much more easily than the manga. The musics are beautiful and the voices amazing. 

Before bashing the anime, you should remember how amazing it was to see Luffy defeating Crocodile. How Nami and Robin's stories were sad. How epic it was when Zoro used Shishi sonson on Kuma, or when Luffy punched the Celestial Dragon, how epic it was when Luffy beat Enel while the golden bell was ringing, or when he punched Bellamy . You probably cried during Merry's funerals, that's how good it was in the anime. Should I talk about that moment when Robin is shouting she wants to live or when Luffy finally beat Lucci with Gear 2. Both Impeld Down and Marineford had plenty of amazing moments as well.

Yes, the anime has it's flaws for sure, but I have never been as entertained in the manga as I was with the anime.
