1,We were playing with a new guy one night and he kept picking on me despite someone else having a very threatening board state. Finally I got fed up and kicked a Blood Tribute on him then swung for the kill just to get him out of the game.,2016-01-03 22:36:11+00:00,cyktyp5,1,t3_3zb1ne,11531,EDH

4,"When I had my wisdom teeth removed I was wearing a shirt with silhouettes of machetes, chainsaws, and the like that said, ""when the zombies come remember to sever the spinal cord."" As I was going under the dentist told me he hadn't know how to put down a zombie. I told him he was ""woefully unprepared.""",2015-10-16 09:01:33+00:00,cw1nxl2,1,t3_3ovic6,59269,AskReddit
5,"My therapist has been a huge help. I've been seeing him off and on for ten years. You just have to remember that not every therapist is the same, some are shit others are amazing, and that you're under NO obligation to pick one and stick with them. Find one and try a few sessions. If they help you, stick with it. If they don't, screw 'em and move on to the next one.",2015-08-13 14:50:26+00:00,cu1m5wn,1,t3_3gukm0,3849,depression
6,"I can sympathize with you not wanting to talk to anyone because you don't want to involve anyone else in your problems but, for me at least, it's been one of the better decisions I've made to seek out a therapist. This is a person who's been trained to listen and maybe offer an objective opinion. I'm sorry that you've suffered so much loss. Take it from me, if you let it, it will drag you down. I have a select few people I talk to about what's bothering me and sometimes I can't even talk to them, but talking is much better than letting something fester.",2015-08-13 14:42:58+00:00,cu1lw6w,1,t3_3gunyl,1755,depression
