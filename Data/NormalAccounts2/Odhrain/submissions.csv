A dealer deals three cards from a standard deck to all players: one face up, two face down. Players may not look at face down cards. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without busting.

In round one players place bets starting to the left of the dealer based on their face up card and those of other players. Once bets are placed players choose one of their two face down cards and reveal it.

In round two more bets are made but now players have the option to ""cut"" their hand into two separate hands. The third card will add its value to both hands when it's revealed at the end of this round.

What do you guys think? I feel it needs some refining but could be fun to play in down time and outside of our adventures.
