Also while we are here, having never studied in the US before, how weird would it be if I turned up to class in a bow tie and possibly a waistcoat (vest in US English?)?

Thanks :) ridiculously excited already",UCSantaBarbara,Wearing suits/sport coats/blazers daily,http://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/3i4uhj/wearing_suitssport_coatsblazers_daily/
