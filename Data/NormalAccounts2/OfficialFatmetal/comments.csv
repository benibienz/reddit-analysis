442,I totally agree. Since I am a kato trader I visit a lot of kato stores on this sub. From my experience a kato store can only hit fp or get any attention at all if it contains high tier katos.

Reminds me a lot of the times when I tried to sell my Katos on lounge.
Another serious issue is the frontpage. Most of it is just people upvoting expensive items they can't afford, no matter if the price is good or bad.
Also the amount of people repeatedly asking the same stupid questions like: "" will Gamma knives fall in the future"" or "" what should I invest in to make ez profit"". 
All these issues are getting more and more frequent, atleast from my experience with this subreddit.
