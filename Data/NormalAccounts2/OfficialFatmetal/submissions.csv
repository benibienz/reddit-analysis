I excluded skins that are reserved. You can feel free to offer for them, but they won't be cheap.

All the skins in this store are negotiable, so feel free to add me to talk, send me steamoffer or comment here. C/Os are appreciated aswell.

I excluded skins that are reserved. You can feel free to offer for them, but they won't be cheap.

All the skins in this store are negotiable, so feel free to add me to talk, send me steamoffer or comment here. C/Os are appreciated aswell.

I excluded skins that are reserved. You can feel free to offer for them, but they won't be cheap.

All the skins in this store are negotiable, so feel free to add me to talk, send me steamoffer or comment here. C/Os are appreciated aswell.

I decided to do a massive store with most of my skins. I excluded skins that are reserved. You can feel free to offer for them, but they won't be cheap.

All the skins in this store are negotiable, so feel free to add me to talk, send me steamoffer or comment here. C/Os are appreciated aswell.

I decided to do a massive store with most of my skins. I excluded skins that are reserved. You can feel free to offer for them, but they won't be cheap.

All the skins in this store are negotiable, so feel free to add me to talk, send me steamoffer or comment here. C/Os are appreciated aswell.

I excluded skins that are reserved. You can feel free to offer for them, but they won't be cheap.

All the skins in this store are negotiable, so feel free to add me to talk, send me steamoffer or comment here. C/Os are appreciated aswell.

All the skins in this store are negotiable, so feel free to add me to talk, send me steamoffer or comment here. C/Os are appreciated aswell.

I excluded skins that are reserved. You can feel free to offer for them, but they won't be cheap.

All the skins in this store are negotiable, so feel free to add me to talk, send me steamoffer or comment here. C/Os are appreciated aswell.

If you want to have an item droped ingame to inspect it feel free to add me and we can arrange that.

All of these are either Katowice 2014 Skins or Blue/blaze gems. 
Feel free to offer anything as I am always happy to take C/Os aswell. 
Prices are also negotiable. 

**Also selling for cash**

If you want to have an item droped ingame to inspect it feel free to add me and we can arrange that.
Don't be shy and offer me :) Worst thing I can do is declining your offer.

All of these are either Katowice 2014 Skins or Blue/blaze gems. 
Feel free to offer anything as I am always happy to take C/Os aswell. 
Prices are also negotiable. 

**Also selling for cash**

If you want to have an item droped ingame to inspect it feel free to add me and we can arrange that.
Don't be shy and offer me :) Worst thing I can do is declining your offer.

All of these are either Katowice 2014 Skins or Blue/blaze gems. 
Feel free to offer anything as I am always happy to take C/Os aswell. 
Prices are also negotiable. 

**Also selling for cash**

If you want to have an item droped ingame to inspect it feel free to add me and we can arrange that.
Don't be shy and offer me :) Worst thing I can do is declining your offer.

All of these are either Katowice 2014 Skins or Blue/blaze gems. 
Feel free to offer anything as I am always happy to take C/Os aswell. 
Prices are also negotiable. 

**Also selling for cash**

If you want to have an item droped ingame to inspect it feel free to add me and we can arrange that.
Don't be shy and offer me :) Worst thing I can do is declining your offer.

If you don't like my prices feel free to move along and don't bother talking s**t about my prices. They are collector items after all.

I am also searching for a 3X or 4X Katowice 2014 Holo awp. Stattrak is prefered and it has to have high tier stickers with atleast 3 Stickers on the visable part of the awp.**

I will only accept a USP which I actually like. Stattrak is prefered.
Please don't offer any USPs with one non Holo or one with the only sticker on the handle.
I want the usp to be clean, so no BS/WW usps please(Stainless is an exeption since the wear doesn't do anything on that skin).
I don't really want a NiP or 3DMax Holo combo. Other than that I pretty much open for anything.

Just send me steamoffers or post your usp on this post. Please don't ask me to offer a price. I want to hear your B/O and work from there.
I will also feel free to add you to negotiate if I don't like the price.

Most of them are at the beginning of my inventory, so just use the search function.

The prices are negotiable for some, so just hit me up with a c/o or add me to negotiate. 
I don't really want items, unless they are liquids at the normal subprice.

Because of that I decided to put most of my playskins up for trade.
My prices are negotiable, so hit me up with any offers. 
I am not in a hurry to trade these unique skins.
If you don't like my prices feel free to move along and don't bother talking s**t about my prices. They are collector items after all.

**I am also interested in items like rubies and stuff like that.
I am also searching for a 3X or 4X Katowice 2014 Holo awp. Stattrak is prefered and it has to have high tier stickers with atleast 3 Stickers on the visable part of the awp.**

Because of that I decided to put most of my playskins up for trade.
My prices are negotiable, so hit me up with any offers. 
I am not in a hurry to trade these unique skins.
If you don't like my prices feel free to move along and don't bother talking s**t about my prices. They are collector items after all.

**I am also interested in items like rubies and stuff like that**

Because of that I decided to put most of my playskins up for trade.
My prices are negotiable, so hit me up with any offers. 
I am not in a hurry to trade these unique skins.
If you don't like my prices feel free to move along and don't bother talking s**t about my prices. They are collector items after all.

**I am also interested in items like rubies and stuff like that.
I am also searching for a 3X or 4X Katowice 2014 Holo awp. Stattrak is prefered and it has to have high tier stickers with atleast 3 Stickers on the visable part of the awp.**

Because of that I decided to put most of my playskins up for trade.
My prices are negotiable, so hit me up with any offers. 
I am not in a hurry to trade these unique skins.
If you don't like my prices feel free to move along and don't bother talking s**t about my prices. They are collector items after all.

**I am also interested in items like rubies and stuff like that**

Because of that I decided to put most of my playskins up for trade.
My prices are negotiable, so hit me up with any offers. 
I am not in a hurry to trade these unique skins.
If you don't like my prices feel free to move along and don't bother talking s**t about my prices. They are collector items after all.

Because of that I decided to put most of my playskins up for trade.
My prices are negotiable, so hit me up with any offers. 
I am not in a hurry to trade these unique skins.
If you don't like my prices feel free to move along and don't bother talking s**t about my prices. They are collector items after all.

Even though they are QS prices they are negotiable ofc.

All skins that aren't reduced are new and just added to the store at a low price.
I just need keys/liquid items at the moment, so please don't offer other katos or ch stuff.
Even though they are QS prices they are negotiable ofc.
I apreciate steamoffers instead of you offering here.
Adds are fine aswell.

I am also quickselling these 2 cheap dragon claws.

FN versions of this knife sell for around 230 Keys normally. I am only charging 172 Keys, since it is MW.
But be aware when you send me the offer. I have 2 Karambit Slaughters MW with diamond. The one with the ""Crimson Diamond"" nametag isn't for sale at the moment. I will counteroffer with the right knife, if you send for the wrong one.

The first is a [Karambit Slaughter 0.11 with HUGE Full Diamond on PS](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=655678567).
FN versions of this knife sell for around 250 Keys normally. I am only charging 175 Keys, since it is MW.
But be aware when you send me the offer. I have 2 Karambit Slaughters MW with diamond. The one with the ""Crimson Diamond"" nametag isn't for sale at the moment. I will counteroffer with the right knife, if you send for the wrong one.

B/O= 175 Keys C/O= [AK Redline 0.15 with iBP Holo on wood+75 Keys](http://imgur.com/dVYoax6)

~~The second one is a [88% Karambit Blue gem 0.57](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=644788453). It is bs, but it doesn't look battlescared at all in my opinion.~~

I am selling it at B/O= ~~205 Keys~~ SOLD FOR B/O

Both Knives are negotiable, so feel free to send any offer or add me on [my steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fatmetalofficial/).

FN versions of this knife sell for around 250 Keys normally. I am only charging 175 Keys, since it is MW.
But be aware when you send me the offer. I have 2 Karambit Slaughters MW with diamond. The one with the ""Crimson Diamond"" nametag isn't for sale at the moment. I will counteroffer with the right knife, if you send for the wrong one.

B/O= 175 Keys

The second one is a [88% Karambit Blue gem 0.57](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=644788453). It is bs, but it doesn't look battlescared at all in my opinion.

I am selling it at B/O= 215 Keys.

Both Knives are negotiable, so feel free to send any offer or add me on [my steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fatmetalofficial/).

B/O(Discount for both knives)= 375 Keys

The first is a [Karambit Slaughter 0.11 with HUGE Full Diamond on PS](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=655678567).
FN versions of this knife sell for around 250 Keys normally. I am only charging 180 Keys, since it is MW.
But be aware when you send me the offer. I have 2 Karambit Slaughters MW with diamond. The one with the ""Crimson Diamond"" nametag isn't for sale at the moment. I will counteroffer with the right knife, if you send for the wrong one.

B/O= 180 Keys

The second one is a [88% Karambit Blue gem 0.57](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=644788453). It is bs, but it doesn't look battlescared at all in my opinion.

I am selling it at B/O= 230 Keys.

Both Knives are negotiable, so feel free to send any offer or add me on [my steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fatmetalofficial/).

B/O(Discount for both knives)= 400 Keys

The 0.19 Asiimov is obviously not selling for 13 Keys.It is the one with this nametag:Gamla BettaN! and don't worry I am pro sticker.
Also the Asiimov with 3 TItan foils is reserved. So Please don't offer for these 2 asiimovs for the normal 13 Keys. Thanks.

The second one is a [Stattrack Bayonet Slaughter FN with central Diamond on PS](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=605882638). It isn't scratchless with a .05 Float sadly, but still a total beast of a knife.
B/O= 200 Keys

So if you are interested in one of them, just [send me a steamoffer](https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=104761218&amp;token=dqtmC5WP) , [add me](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fatmetalofficial) or post in this thread. 
Happy trading to every single one of you guys :)",GlobalOffensiveTrade,[H] 80 % MW Blue Gem Kara@ 280 Keys; Stattrack Bayonet Slaughter FN with central Diamond @ 200 Keys [W] Keys,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensiveTrade/comments/425cgd/h_80_mw_blue_gem_kara_280_keys_stattrack_bayonet/
