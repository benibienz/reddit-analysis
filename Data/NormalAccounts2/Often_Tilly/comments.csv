4,"&gt; Bad automatic driver: Removes foot from brake, presses gas peddle, accelerates to 20 mph for all of 3 seconds, forcing a shift to 2nd gear, then hard brakes again

Why would you do that? Sometimes I get to second gear if there's a long movement, but generally coasting in second gear.

In fact, I like to play a little game sometimes where I see if I can control the car with just my left foot. It takes quite a lot of effort to just bring the clutch up slowly to get the car started without any gas and then bringing the clutch in again to slow down (going up hills obviously slows you down). Sometimes I manage to go through half a queue without using my right foot at all, and I feel immensely proud.",2016-11-07 22:27:39+00:00,d9q7ktu,10.0,t1_d9q48cx,3953.0,todayilearned

12,"It's a huge problem for trains. The leaves get crushed under the wheels of the train leaving a Teflon like coating on the railhead.

This causes massive issues with braking distances as braking has to be carried out much more carefully in order to prevent wheels locking up - this is much more likely than in a car due to the significantly lower coefficient of friction between the wheel and the rail.

If a train wheel locks up, it causes wheel flats that require trains to be taken out of service to turn them on a wheel lathe to make them round again as wheel flats cause significant problems for the railway, such as cracking rails due to the impact of the flat part of the wheel hitting the rail. We have wheel slide protection (wsp) equipment to prevent wheel slide, which works somewhat like abs in a car, but this again increases the braking distance.

71,"What's worst is that managers are at the bottom of the pile. Train drivers' basic salary is nearly double mine and will remain more for the next 10-15 years. They get overtime, which I won't, even though I work longer hours than they do (45 hours is a short week for me, drivers work about 30 and get paid handsome overtime for any time over). I worked for 4 years for an engineering degree, they do a 12 week course in train driving which is pretty much guaranteed a pass.

People say that train driving is a responsible job - which it is - but I'd argue that the technicians' jobs are much more responsible. If a driver messes up, there are many lines of safety that will prevent accidents - AWS, TPWS, and soon ERTMS. All that stands between the train and failure caused by maintenance is the technicians' skill and vigilance - there is much less of a safety net! The technicians' working environment is significantly worse too - working under dirty trains rather than in nice warm cabs. Yet technicians, who have a 2 year apprenticeship, are also paid less than drivers too.

So, all in all, it's a really demoralising working environment because of the strength of the drivers union. What the drivers want, they get because if they don't they will stop working trains (see what's happening on southern).

* 240V AC for HVAC, air compressors, cleaners' sockets, auxiliary converters, etc  
* 110V DC for control circuits.

Anything above 110V is highly controlled. We have secondary covers over everything over 110V DC, so that you have to open two covers before you can touch any contacts (and often these are two different methods / tools to open). The traction systems are all protected such that you cannot have the train powered and the traction equipment accessible at the same time with interlocks.

The problem isn't trains derailing, it's trains not being able to accelerate or decelerate as quickly, so it takes longer to stop at stations, signals, etc (because drivers have to brake earlier and then it takes longer for the train to get back up to speed). Even slowing for a speed restriction takes longer. The delays are a cumulative effect of all the trains doing this.

Also, many trains now have equipment to prevent wheel slip (where the wheels are spinning faster than rail is going past when powering) and wheel slide (where the wheel locks when braking). These aren't particularly dangerous in themselves - in fact, the train would stop more quickly if you locked the wheel because sliding resistance is greater than resistance from a rotating wheel - but it results in wheel flats which are uncomfortable for passengers and can cause stresses in the train suspension and rail (imagine hitting the rail with a 30T hammer every few metres).",2016-05-17 15:10:00+00:00,d38uzae,3.0,t1_d37l7b6,84030.0,nottheonion

227,"As a transgender woman, removal of my facial hair is a pretty big thing for me.

I've been having laser hair removal for nearly a year, and my facial hair (which, in fairness, wasn't particularly strong before I started) is virtually gone. I now shave twice a week - but bear in mind that I have to have a perfectly smooth face to successfully present as a woman, so you probably won't need to go quite as extreme.

I've heard that electrolysis is meant to be more permanent, but it's slower. Personally, I'm planning on having electrolysis when I've finished my current course of laser; just on any stubborn hairs.

It's important that you have laser hair removal, IPL laser is not the same! (It's much cheaper, but just bleaches the hair rather than destroying the follicle).

A word on pain too: people (especially the beauticians doing the treatment) like to tell you that it feels like an elastic band being snapped against your skin. This might be true if you have female pattern facial hair growth; but for male pattern growth it can be horrendous. It doesn't get much better, but the sessions space out eventually (I'm on 8 weekly sessions at the moment), and in fairness the pain doesn't last long.

Finally, finding one is pretty tough! Because my job requires me to move around, I decided to go with a national chain and picked SK:N. I have only good things to say about them. I believe I paid £600 for 8 sessions - but that was when they had a really good deal on. Look out on the website and stuff.",2016-05-01 17:46:52+00:00,d2omaf9,1.0,t3_4h9tpn,4809.0,AskUK

I've had my brows styled recently (as you can hopefully see).

Hair growth is tricky. Yes, I'd love to just let it grow; but I have friends who are doing that and they just look like guys who have let their hair get unkempt (I work in a professional environment where that isn't acceptable). The defining thing about women's hair isn't the length, it's about highlighting, layering, volume, curl, etc (especially in short hair). I have it styled every 3 months or so. Yes, it will take more time to grow to the length I want it (long enough to plait it, so a little more than shoulder length), but it'll look feminine and stylish for much longer.",2016-04-22 22:15:58+00:00,d2dmp23,2.0,t1_d2cw4kd,42173.0,transpassing

Ie, if you can understand the functionality of a little 2 channel desk with an eq controlling high / mid / low frequency and a single auxiliary send then you can understand the principles of operating a 40+ channel high end desk where the eqs have many bands with selectable frequency, q value and  gain control with multiple auxiliary sends, groups, vcas, etc.

There are many skills in sound engineering, both technical and artistic, but understanding the basics of sound desk operation isn't really much to boast about. It's when you use the sound desk to get a really good mix that you get to boast ;)

479,"&gt; 've always wanted to try out mascotting. Not necessarily make it a career (I'm not even sure its possible in this country unless you're a premier league mascot), but just to have a go and enjoy it.

Me too! I have a good, professional job so it's not something I plan on making a career of, I just want a go!

&gt;I'm assuming that first of all, you've checked with your current workplace? I got my first real performing gig through work, on my lunch hour (Pudsey).

I'm pretty sure that there are no opportunities at work, and I'm not sure that even if there were then I'd want to get involved.

&gt;If your workplace doesn't have the opportunity, then you have 3 options. 

&gt;1.  Promo Work. This is probably your easiest way to get that one or two day gig, and it will pay at least £10 per hour. Again, the amount of work you could do depends on your height. Most costumes seem to either fit some 5ft 10 or 5ft 3 if its a shorty. There is a couple of inches leeway either side of this, and there are always the odd request for really short, or really tall people. 
Now, facebook is your friend if you want these jobs,. The facebook group [Promo Fo's](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Promofos/) and [Client Queen](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ClientQueen/?fref=ts) are two examples of where promo work (and costume work on occasion) is posted. You will probably get 3 or 4 costume jobs a week being posted on these sites. However, they tend to show which promo agencies do a lot of costume work, and it makes sense to sign up to those agencies are not all of the jobs are posted on facebook). 
If you have acting experience, give Rainbow Productions an email. They manaufacture many of the mascot costumes in the UK, and have their own mini agency to fill many of appearances. However, they generally ask for previous mascot experience or a background in drama dance. chrisd@rainbowproductions.co.uk is the email you will need.

I will try those avenues! Thank you for suggesting them. I'm 5'9, so I hope I'll fit in most costumes! I've not done much acting, but I have joined an am dram group, so hoping to get into the next play.

&gt;2.  Sports teams. /u/Qenops suggestion to contact sports teams to talk to the mascot is a great idea. I will add that the UK ice hockey teams tend to all have mascots, which are generally filled by volunteers. The MK Lightning mascot, 'Pucky' is an old suit but having attended a couple of games at that ice rink, I really rate the performer. They might be a good person to get in touch with. I'd cast your net out wide, try the premier league football teams, rugby union and league teams. The worst that will happen is they say no. For example, I reached out to my own hockey team, and came away with a much better idea of what was required. I was due to take over from the existing performer at the start of the next season but had to move away before that could happen.

That's a shame. I'm in Birmingham, so plenty of places to try!

&gt;3. Charity work. Charities love volunteers. If you contact the regional or head office of the charity, you can generally be put on their books for costume work and costume work only. This worked for me with Help for Heroes, but unfortunately it turned out that I was too tall for the suit. 

Charities are what I originally thought of, but I have no idea which ones to look at. God idea of ringing to be put on the books for costume only work, though! I was worried that I might have ended up spending days fundraising for a charity stood next to a mascot with few opportunities to actually have a go in the suit!",2015-10-26 18:37:27+00:00,cwdn7oy,2.0,t1_cwcfr8a,86232.0,mascots

511,"&gt;Most of the craigslist postings I've seen are one-time events for an organization that doesn't have a need for anyone to do it regularly, so it would be great for a one off.  Plus you could get some money for doing it.

OK, that would be cool. I'll have a look.

&gt;As far as approaching a local mascot, I know the culture in the UK is a lot different than here for mascots.  While most teams have them, there doesn't seem to be any full-time dedicated performers, so it might not work, but its always worth a shot, but this would work with any organization that has a mascot, not just a sports team.  If you don't know the performer and they don't have a specific mascot point of contact, generally just contacting an organization via email saying that you are interested in mascotting and would like to talk to 'a pro' is a great approach. They may not respond at all, but no loss. If you do get in contact, tell you are interested and would like some tips for someone just starting out.  You can also ask how they got their start and if they know of any small gigs in the area.

OK, I will look around for teams. I suspect, though, that most people who are mascots have got into it because they are long term supporters of those teams rather than because they wanted to be a mascot? I will try anyway, though.",2015-10-12 12:08:47+00:00,cvwtwu3,4.0,t1_cvwtm98,985.0,mascots
512,"&gt;Being as my experience is only in the US, it might not help a ton, but you can sometimes find local gigs online.  I've found quite a few gigs posted to Craigslist and also on some jobs boards.  Here in the US there are a lot of promotions companies which do costume character work, but they are generally national or regional companies and discovering which ones have regular character work can be difficult.

I've never looked on Craigslist, etc. The thing is, I'm not really looking for work per se, it's just something that I've always wanted to try as a one off, so not looking for work. I have considered joining a charity with a mascot, but it seems a lot of work doing charity stuff on the off chance that I'm asked to be in the costume!

&gt;You say there aren't any local mascots?  Talking to a local performer is also a great way to find a gig even if they don't let you step in as their character because they often have connections and know of gigs.

No, I don't know of any. Perhaps a sports team? How would I find a local mascot and approach them?

&gt;You might also check with local businesses which could have mascots and see if you can fill in.  Then there are always the character children's party companies, but I wouldn't recommend those because they don't reflect other mascotting work at all.

I'm not aware of any that have a mascot, and I'm not sure that I could fill in anyway if I'm not an employee? I wouldn't want to do children's parties.

Thanks, though, I think that there is a bit of food for thought there. I think I need to investigate charities with mascots? That could be a semi-regular thing... I bet there's loads whose volunteers don't particularly want to wear the costume...",2015-10-12 10:52:51+00:00,cvwsoib,2.0,t1_cvws116,2921.0,mascots

577,"It's funny that you should bring up homophobia. Let me tell you my personal experiences.

For years, I assumed that I was an heterosexual man by default (albeit one with a low sex drive) and actively avoided any hint that I might not be. This, I feel, lead me to be quite bigoted - toward women, toward gays, toward trans people, etc etc. Very much a case of ""the lady doth protest too much"". In fact I remember early on on reddit (on a different account), an AMA about a lady who'd just got SRS on the NHS and attacking her vehemently... now that's my ultimate aim!

Since I realised that I'm trans, I've done a lot of thinking about my life; especially about the bigoted views that I thought I held. I've come to the conclusion that I *didn't* hold them, but used them as a smokescreen to distance myself from who I was. For example, I am an engineer, women aren't good engineers, therefore I can't be a woman. Similarly on a lot of issues.
