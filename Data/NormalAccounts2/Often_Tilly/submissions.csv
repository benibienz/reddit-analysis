Should I try to 'disrupt' activities and muscle in on them? Eg, go and mess with people warming up; or is this off limits?

So I made it to the GIC at Nottingham! 14 months of waiting, ringing the clinic to ask if they had any further information, preparing to go full time, actually going full time, changing my name, changing my documents, etc, etc, etc.

I had my second appointment with a doctor about 3 weeks ago and he asked me some very odd questions / made some odd comments that I'm still a bit upset about.

Firstly, he asked me if anything had changed since my first appointment and I told him that nothing had, except for having 6 weeks of presenting as a woman at work (my first appointment would have been my second day at work after my transition). He asked me if I was bored of presenting as a woman, which I found really odd.

The other comment was that he compared me to 'other cis men', when I asked him about the possibility of being intersex.

It's been 3 weeks, and I'm still a bit upset about it. Does this mean that GIC don't believe that I'm trans?

I mopped the floor (leaving a slightly wet residue, but it was basically dry) and went back upstairs to get dressed. A little while later, he came to tell me that he wasn't happy with how I'd mopped up. He said that it was my mess and that I should clear it up. When I refuted that I had caused it (the shower leaked, a plumber thinks that a pipe has leaked but hadn't confirmed that by last night), my landlord said that nothing like that had happened before I moved in. The only way that I can think I caused it would be by taking a bath - but I didn't do anything that you wouldn't expect a bathroom to be able to cope with.

&gt;At the end of the first week, he announced that he'd decided to sell his house and gave me 28 days notice in writing.

&gt;It took me about 1h 20m to collect my stuff together so that I had enough clothes, toiletries, etc to spend a few nights away. After about an hour, my landlord and lawyer came to tell me that I was taking too long to leave and to hurry up. They said that half an hour was a reasonable notice period to leave, and that I should have gone by then.

But other than small claims if he refuses to pay my rent / deposit back, I can't see any legal basis for suing him.

She's asked about my relationship with my penis, and I want some context from cis men about what you felt/feel regarding yours?

I first discovered the fact that my penis gets hard at all when I was about 12/13 when I was laying on my bed once. I found that it felt pretty good to lay on my bed, face down and push myself forward to pleasure myself. As I got toward puberty, I'd do this maybe twice a week. Occasionally, but increasingly, a bit of liquid would come out, which I later learned is pre-cum. Nowadays, I still masturbate occasionally in the prone position, but very rarely. Sexual urges just don't feature in my life.

I could count the number of times I've masturbated in the traditional 'grab your penis and tug it' method on the palm of one hand... It felt absolutely wrong and I never did it again. I didn't even make it to the pre-cum stage.

I've had a few sexual dealings with guys. I've never felt comfortable with them touching my penis, although I've given my fair share of bjs. I've never done anal. I've never had any sexual interest in women, although up until coming out they are the group I've made an awful hash of dating.

So, really, what I want to know is how your experiences fit with mine? How did you discover masturbating? How frequently did you masturbate between discovering it and 23?

I'm moving to Birmingham for work and need an unfurnished rental apartment. I'll be working in the city centre and out toward Solihull (2 sites). I'm quite taken by the apartments by St Edward's docks, but they are way outside my price range (looking at £450 per month, perhaps £500 for the right place).

I may be interested in a house share if appropriate, for example in the docks if anyone else is looking.

Any suggestions for places to look? Thanks in advance.",brum,Moving to Birmingham,http://www.reddit.com/r/brum/comments/3faica/moving_to_birmingham/

I've got my referral to Nottingham gic (about October for my first appointment based on the letter and when it arrived), but I want to speed up my transition. I've heard that I can possibly get bridging hormones either by prescription or by self medicating.

If I go to the doctor's, can I just ask for bridging hormones? If they say no, what do I need to persuade them to do so that I can safely self medicate? I know I'll need a blood test, but what for?

Thanks,

I'm on the path to transition, but I'm wondering how similar my relationship with my penis is to everyone else's.

I've never really cared for it. It's useful to be able to stand and pee, but it's just been there. I've never had the urge to stick it in anyone. I barely masturbate, and I've spent most of my life rubbing it through my trousers when I want to pleasure myself. I heard it described as it being like a wasp at a picnic - unwanted, but persistently there getting in the way and causing annoyance.

I assumed that this was how everyone was, until I went to uni aged 18 and there was a discussion about how they always beat theirs regularly to porn and I was stood there awkwardly wondering why they would want to? I assumed that they were just really horny outliers, although I was soon starting to identify as an asexual. It's only within the last 18 months that I've started to realise that I'm a woman and it feels like everything is slotting into place.

So, what was everyone else's experience?",asktransgender,How do you feel about your genitals?,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/3a2elt/how_do_you_feel_about_your_genitals/
