So not saying it didn't glitch out but even if it did and I get it should happen , your answer is to trade the game into game stop? 

For 1 that seems like a pretty lousy way to go about having something not go your way.

2 I couldn't think of a worse way to spend your money. Buy a game for full price and your prob bought it from game stop and when u take it back they will give u what 18 bucks?

Artifact gear is around 4.5 mil xp to legendary and u can't use runestones or enchantments to lvl them.

Artifacts are 10.5 mil xp to mythic but u can use feeders and runestones and enchantments.

Make sure u use the right rp into the correct items. Example. Imo don't waste res stones and opals etc into artifacts.

With 3 mil u could prob buy enough rp in runestones to get 1 or 2 artifacts to mythic if u have the feeders.

134,"You are spot on and I just said something similar to another person on this thread. I constantly out dps equal and higher gear gwf and sw. Juat because people don't understand how to fit all the damage into 6 seconds windows for shadow of demise, or there running scrub builds they call tr bad. I and walking proof they are not and I will go against any person who says otherwise and I'll prove it in game.

Plus tr is a single target crushers.  Take and elol run a gwf will be at 8 to 10 mil dps maybe before we even hit the first boss, aka all trash mobs tgat dont matter while I'll be at 6 to 7 mil. Then after the first boss I'll be leading the pain giver. Then by the time we hit scorpions the gwf will be ahead again. Then comes the scorpions and I'll be right back on top and then comes lost mauth where I'll put the nail in the coffin because I'm wrecking all single targets and bosses while some of the classes are epeen ing because there trash clearing numbers are so good",2016-09-13 16:23:37+00:00,d7l5i8q,4.0,t1_d7kuzj9,15758.0,Neverwinter
135,"Just straight up incorrect. Learn how to play the class. Learn rotations and how the skills work.  Tr is tougher to play than other classes, u need to be on the ball with timing and rotations or it will cost u millions of dps.

Also pain giver chart isn't everything. A tr is single target destruction for the most part. So while your running a dungeon and the gwf or sw  put up 8 mil  on trash mobs to ur 5 mil. Then u get to the boss and push past them by 5 mil because your a single target wrecking ball.


I'm 2627 item lvl and I can consistently out dps , hr, gwf, and sw that are the same geared or higher item lvl. And the people I play with are no slouches.

Btw tell me what class you run so I can throughly put an end to your argument. First and foremost the leaderboard pain giver isn't the end all be all. With that being said I'm always first or 2nd in dps. Take lost mauth for instance. 1 run with no wipes I will pull 27 to 35 mil dps as a rogue. Absolutely more than adequate dps and that's all single target damage. The is no dps padding for killing worthless ass trash mobs with aoe.

Which brings me to the point of the dps scoreboard. This is where sw and some gwf shine. Because they pad dps stats on killing trash, which don't get me wrong is useful and trash needs to die but come the boss fight u are lacking dps to a rogue everytime.

When I run say lost mauth I run 3 single target dps encounters and usually lead the scoreboard anyway, unless a broken sw is there then he usually beats Mr by a few mil again from him killing 10 more trash mobs than me.


Take a gwf and a sw into a dungeon and let them epeen about how much dps they got on the score board. Then take them same 2 kids to a demo fight and watch them not make top 5. 

Welcome to the world of clueless ass kids claiming the pain giver is the end all be all.

Again learn 2 play and learn other classes. A tr is gonna do mad dps to bosses and single targets which is what u want for 90% of the dungeons. Who gives a shit about killing trash mobs. 

Ps I can also switch to an aoe build and push out even more dps on the pain giver but deal substantially  less during the boss fight because aoe attacks are shit for boss battles for the most part.

197,"Oh I don't care about what it looks like, but it's tough to say that 300 crit strike and 300 armor Pen at legendary won't be worth a spot, I under stand that say a damage boost by have a fire archon is a great asset. But it only works for a 3rd of the fight and yes I know bosses it will last a long longer on my but a boost  of 2 stats 300 will be up all the time. I mean that basically like 2 boons being active. 

I'm not trying to say your wrong or that I don't appreciate the feed back I'm just saying I don't agree with stats not having a spot on the bar atleast for one campion since they don't stack.

That would also give the option to use certain enchabtments instead of armor pen if necessary.

203,"I'm a tr around 2300 gs. And I love my tr, one thing u have to realise is the score board isn't the end all be all. When I run dungeons with a group I swap out all my aoe skills for single target skills. I'll go with dazing,lashing,wicked at my encounters. I am still between 1 and 3 on the scoreboard but all my damage is coming from single target and not from mass group slaying.

When I run solo or with a friend doing campaigns I run dazing,blades of fury and smoke bomb. I can run that same setup in dungeons and pull higher score but it's from killing trash them skills are not what u want to be running vs bosses.

I honestly  think I'm ok with the change. I don't like how they didn't tell anyone about it and just stealth nerf ed it but overall I'm kn board.

To me this is what they needed to breath life to other weapons like ars.  For example is I have 35 base crit with a decent rolled smg I can be right at the 60 cap. This gives more option for ur gear instead of cc on mask u can go sp. 

Take ars now with 35 base cc and a decent pulse u can now be at cap or close to it and have a more lvl playing field vs smgs.

ill explain and this I my opinion.
as of right now u really have nothing upping your damage in terms of higher damage numbers, your dps is high because of stacked accuracy and rof. now yes rof will make ur bullets come out quicker which leads to more dps quicker, but accuracy also tightens your spread which is why dps in creases but neither of these actually increase how much damage your bullets are doing.

adding weapon damage to the mag will up you bullet damage straight up.. I would then go with prob crit chance and headshot damage for scope, and critchance and stability if needed on muzzle if not then leave it as accuracy.

I play at around 9 pm after my son goes to bed and my ol lady lays down for the night. and play til around midnight half the week when I have work at 7am and play til 1 or 2am the other half where I don't have work til 10 am.

I run the daily challenege mode each day and spend the rest of my time in the dz, I farm d tech chests and bosses on a route from dz2 to dz6 then back from dz6 to dz3 then I find a new server. the run takes a little less than an hour and u can fill your stash in 1 run.

so between all the items you extract and all the dtech from bosses and chests it is quite easy to craft 30 to 50 items in 3 hours.  not to mention when u caft say 20 items and break them down u get a 1/3 of the crafting material back from destruction. its really not that hard.",2016-04-08 22:24:01+00:00,d1viqad,2.0,t1_d1vif8v,483.0,thedivision

and as of right now there is only lvl 31 items as the highest and that's what lvl 32 mobs drop in the dz.  with the update the said the items dropped will be relative to the enemy lvl. so I cant see a lvl 32 incursion or challenge mode offering lvl 32 items but lvl 32 elites everywhere else wont.

687,"The way the game is now finding 1 high end every few hours just to have it either be a performance mod or some unbelievably bad rolled item is depressing. Diablo 3 u may find 50 legendarys an hour and  80% are salvaged for crafting material, and when u do find the item your looking for it may have rolled like crap so u need to continue to farm.

Finding a ton of legendary or high ends isn't the problem that is what u want in a loot game u want to feel like everytime u play u are finding possible upgrades or good items that's how a loot game survives.

The only way to implement a system where u have very rare items that u find extremely few of is to have said items only roll 1 way with certain talents, skills, or damage. and then u have year 1 destiny, gjallerhorn-check, icebreaker-check, hawkmoon-check. and then u have only 2 or 3 weapons in the game that people want and gear around. no gjallerhorn no room for you on crota raid swrry. Then 2 months down the road every single person in the game looks the same we all have the same gear and all rock 2 or 3 weapons out of a pool of 5 usable weapons.

With this patch there is infinite possiblys with weapons and items. You wont see 2 people running around with the same exact gear or weapons let alone said talents on weapon or gear. Take a look at year 1 in destiny everyone had raid armor and the next dlc it was just better raid armor, and as for weapons everyone used raid weapons with ghorn or icebreaker.

TLDR: having high amounts loot drops is how a loot game with large amounts of rng survives. Look at reaper of souls diablo 3 patch.

 I would say my only gripe is I got med high scuf sticks and while I do think the sticks are decent and the right height I should of got default sticks because when I put thumb grips on they become to high for my taste.

I saw a you tube video of a kid complaining about his scuf sticks being garbage because 1 broke, then he proceeds to say how he threw the controller unprotected into a book bag with other shit in there. Now ok Maybe the stick shouldn't of broke but when u buy a 180 $ controller maybe put a little effort into caring about it.

So take a flashbang and have scavanger  and be able to blind room after room as u enter seems pretty benefical.  And it all depends  on play style I guess. Would I rather have a grip or the ability to constantly flashbangs groups or even have basically unlimited nades.

Imo past primary gunfighter 1 the cost of attachments isn't worth it. Your basically saying that adding a gun attachment for 2 class points is worth more that 2 tac nades or a lethal and a tac, and I don't see it. 

But the beauty is being able to create as many classes and u see fit I have some classes with 5  perks and some classes with 1 perk. Some classes with 2 tacs and a lethal and some with no tacs or lethals. 

For example a fav class I like to use  for some strong run and gun is Haymaker with long barrel and extended mags with dual wield l car9 pistols. I use 2 flashbangs with ghost,fast hands, gun-ho. It's a very lethal setup. You could even drop both attachments of the shotgun and run perk 2 greed with scavanager and just flash every room while running.

1118,"pray.... But seriously rejack was the hardest and most annoying specialist to do the hero armor for. Best advice i can give is to stagger the times when u revive, dont always do it right away, and learn to jump when u revive or something to confuse the enemy.

good luck that is the worst specialist ever.",2015-12-14 22:09:32+00:00,cxz4tdp,1.0,t3_3wuc7d,143.0,blackops3

Yet my Tdm w/l is 1.8 and my kc  w/l is a 1.4.

1128,"i just finished the rejack dbl kills to unlock hero armors. honestly it was fuckin infuriating. I hate the ability so much. i did it playing core tdm where that how i did every other heros challeneges. best thing i can say is keep trying.

i dont use bumper jumper but i did switch to it just for rejack, so when i rejacked i would just hold L1 and could jump right up from respawn and still aim. i also used a smg with extended mags, like the kuda or vmp.

it took me about 5 or so hours to get the 2 dbl kills i needed.  ground war could help since there is more people or even an objective game mode where u can easily get poeple grouped up around objectives. 

I thought this one would be the easier of the 2 to do since i saw alot of people complaining about getting dbl kills with the hive, but i seriously did the hive dbl kills in like 6 games on tdm. the rejack was the worst thing ever. and its a ktd raper.

but i still believe the xp you get from unlocking the attachments would be doubled.",2015-12-11 23:06:59+00:00,cxvvz1m,1.0,t3_3wfohw,3458.0,blackops3
1130,"i honestly hate to be that guy, but i have comcast cable which is far the best but not terrible either. i have played this game since launch and i dont ever have disconnect issues, rubberbanding or any problems like that.

I will say i have noticed random people lagging and if u pull up the score board u can see their ping is dying.

I also play in a house where my son watches netflix for bed and my ol lady is always pissing around on her phone or computer while im playing.

in terms of it possibly being a problem on your end, high end modems and routers really do make a difference in gaming. not saying you should dump 500 usd into that but having a smart router to open ports and such does help.

i hope that didnt come off mean, im just sharing my personaly experience and possible solution.",2015-12-11 22:51:49+00:00,cxvvftu,1.0,t3_3wfu74,286.0,blackops3
1131,"Imo flakjacket needed to be addressed in general. There is no reason it has to be that powerful of a perk basically nullifying kill streaks and well placed nades etc. But i would of opted to have flakjacket reworked over having the rc car buffed, and when i say reworked i dont mean to nerf it into the ground but there should be some sort of balance.

Instead of having flakjacket just brush off every single explsoive item/skill/or streak in the game, it should have ranges for effectiveness. 

So ok for example: If im coming at u with an rc car and blow it up 5 feet away you live and fj takes the incoming blast damage, if i detonate it at your feet you should die.. If i throw a perfect semtex and it sticks u, u should die regardless of flakjacket. If the nade is 5-10 feet away you should live and fj should eat the damage.

i just personally think that its one of them perks that is to strong in itself, and should have some sort of limitation.",2015-12-11 22:45:05+00:00,cxvv7a5,1.0,t3_3wfolo,2100.0,blackops3
1132,"At first I thought u had to kill spectre during game and only spectres using  active camo. That's incorrect the wording is just sketchy.

You just need to kill people using active camo.  Kill 4 people using active camo in a single game. And do that 4 times. I honestly took me 2 games to complete.

Just pop active camo before a gun fight. Like if u flank someone pop camo and kill them .

4 kills shortly  breaking out of active camo in a single game.
