The chest in talking about is the secondary chest that u either need a legendary dragon key or the lost mauth chest key.

I ran lost mauth about 10 times earlier today,  the secondary chest never seemed to change its contents at all unless I took the items in it from the previous chest.

My example is I ran 3 back to back to back, where the chest had 5 white res stones 1 blue, 1 green,  and a draconian enchantment the seals and a peiece of gear. Finally on the 3rd time of the same exact items I took the chest. Then next run had new contents in the chest also featuring a white dragon glyph. I left the chest without taking contents and next run sure enough the chest had the same contents with the same white dragon glyph. So I took it. Then following run the chest Contents had basically the same as the first chests I listed with respect stones.


Am I just tricking myself and dumb luck just happened to be really on point? Or did the ninja nerf the chest so the loot doesn't change until u take it. It also sketches me out that I can't leave the dungeon through the portal if I don't take the secondary chests. It says I can't leave til I take my reward so I juat pop a sign post and leave that way.

Let me know if I'm crazy or what lol cuz I'm under the impression that I can look at the contents and not take them and it won't use my key and  it would ofc be random the next dungeon.




P.s. out of the 10 runs I lead the damage chart every single run by atleast 7 mil  and with the same group 2 other pulled artifact belts .

For starters remove pvp from the dz and add in a pvp arena, full of different pvp modes etc.
Could have a new pvp currency only obtained in the pvp arena to buy sets and gear of any kind from randomly generated shops that change each week.


Now for the fun part. The new and improved pve dz.
So don't change the amount of people on the server let it stay at 24 people per server. Now  leave the same landmarks and bosses as is, then add in a cpl landmarks per zone with tougher bosses that would need more than a 4 people to clear effectively.  Then we could go a step further and like supply drops have a server wide boss battle every so often., where the whole server would team up and take out the large scale battle, each player will be reward for participation and whoever lands the killing blow on the boss will gain additonal rewards.


Now this will make the dz safe for solo players from gank squads and it will let any amount of people able to group up to fight off landmarks and bosses on a pure pve experience.

Players need to learn appropriate distances and how to engage or just how to battle shotguns in general. Don't go toe to toe with shotguns for any reason. Engage from a distance , Mmr, ar etc. Grenades and other forms of cc like turrets are your friend.




10 meters is the effective range for a shotgun, outside of that they do almost no damage. Test yourself in the shooting range, go from far right target to left target and see a damage drop of 90% or better.



I can't tell u the amount of players I've killed with a Mmr why trying to rush at me with there shotgun. It's really just common sense.



Shotguns are now a good weapon for pvp and pve and from my personal experience I don't do much pvp and love them for pve. Nerf ing shotguns because u can't learn to no be point blank range in a pvp battle will ruin them for pve again.



Sentry isn't the only shotgun build, and I would wager alpha bridge is even better for burst pvp damage.





And I'll prob get flack for this but in all honesty shotguns are not that hard to deal with, and imo it's players that can't adapt to thier surrounding that's just want to stand toe to toe with shotguns and die call it op. 





And if someone 1 shots u with a shotgun then it's your own fault. How did that person get close enough to u and plant a headshots on u at point blank range.  




Tldr: shotguns are fine, stop calling for nerfs. Engage at a distance and keep space. Use smart cover, cc etc. To battle and for the love of good stop standing still and stop trying to fight shotgunner from within 20 feet.

This is for the folks who are either naive or new to the loot fest and rng that  a lot of us are already well aware of.

The way the game is now finding 1 high end every few hours just to have it either be a performance mod or some unbelievably bad rolled item is depressing. Diablo 3 u may find 50 legendarys an hour and 80% are salvaged for crafting material but its the fact that your are finding items! And when u do find the item your looking for it may have rolled like crap so u need to continue to farm, and that's fine that's what keeps you going.

Finding a ton of legendary or high ends isn't the problem that is what u want in a loot game u want to feel like everytime u play u are finding possible upgrades or good items that's how a loot game survives.

Finding lots of high ends wont make it any less special when u finally get the perfect item, all it does it makes the game better since I can try all my rng on playing the game and killing enemys for my random drops, instead of farming crates and standing in the BoO crafting for 2 hours to get my perfect drop. Not to mention you arnt pigeon holed into 1 smg and 1 assault rifle from blueprints, you can find so many different items out in the wild now.

The only way to implement a system where u have very rare items that u find extremely few of is to have said items only roll 1 way with certain talents, skills, or damage. and then u have year 1 destiny, gjallerhorn-check, icebreaker-check, hawkmoon-check. and then u have only 2 or 3 weapons in the game that people want and gear around. no gjallerhorn no room for you on crota raid swrry. Then 2 months down the road every single person in the game looks the same we all have the same gear and all rock 2 or 3 weapons out of a pool of 5 usable weapons.

With this patch there is infinite possiblys with weapons and items. You wont see 2 people running around with the same exact gear or weapons let alone said talents on weapon or gear. Take a look at year 1 in destiny everyone had raid armor and the next dlc it was just better raid armor, and as for weapons everyone used raid weapons with ghorn or icebreaker.

TLDR: having high amounts loot drops is how a loot game with large amounts of rng survives. Look at reaper of souls diablo 3 patch. If u want everyone having static rare high end(exotic/legendary) drops look at how terrible year 1 destiny was.

My ktd took a slight hit and went from a 2.0 to about 1.6. I did almost all weapons in tdm with some in domination and all core game modes I really don't like hardcore.

My list of weapons easiest to hardest.

Assault rifles,
Smgs,
Snipers,
Shotguns,
Pistols,
Lmgs,
Launchers,
Knife

I have a video clip I'll try to post in the comments of my final kill for dark matter. Now to finish out master prestige only 6 more ranks to go.

Any questions or comments feel free to post.

I completed the firepower challenege for using over kill and 2ndary gunfighter and 5 attachments across both weapons, but not a single kill registered for the 2nd are gunfighter. That's the only challenege I have left for the wildwood
