You also have authority.  Make their lives easier.  Advocate for them to senior leadership.  Fight for equipment, funding, etc.

If they are on top of things, getting work done and whatnot, work with your NCOIC and get your amn out early.  May not seem like much, but it does wonders for morale, and gives incentive for them to produce quality work much faster.
