Odds are they are not authorized to deny the leave, unless your CC has a policy letter in place naming direct supervisors as the Leave Disapproval Authority, AFI 36-3003 section 3.3.

&gt;3.2. Leave Approval Authority. While commanders have final approval authority, they may
delegate approval authority according to the organizationâ€™s needs. Normally, annual leave
requests are delegated to a level no lower than the first-line supervisor.


&gt;3.3. Leave Disapproval Authority. Leave is a right; however, unit commanders can
disapprove leave requests due to military necessity or in the best interest of the Air Force.
3.1.3.1. Unit commanders may delegate disapproval authority to a level no lower than
first-line supervisors. Commanders may adjust delegation of authority based on
mission requirements.

Remember, projected leave in a calendar is not official if it's not in Leaveweb.  Don't let your leadership fuck you.",AirForce,Just a word of advice for everyone out there,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/5dm4jt/just_a_word_of_advice_for_everyone_out_there/

Last Labor Day weekend, I got my assignment notification for Osan (I'm still not there, and not due to leave my current base until September).  I go ahead and extend 7 months to ensure retainability for my tour in Korea.

Next overseas list cycle, a buddy of mine gets an assignment notification to Yongsan.  Cool right, we are going to be relatively close to each other, can still keep in touch and meet up in Seoul.  So he extends to ensure his own retainability for Korea.

So last October (2015), I got my follow on notification to Raamstein (2 full years before my RNLTD for that assignment, which I thought was a bit wierd).  Awesome right?  

Well at this time, my buddy deploys to Bagram.  During his deployment, he gets his follow on notification to Raamstein.  Even more awesome.

Last Friday, a bunch of people from the squadron meet at the local airport to welcome home the deployers.  (Their plane got delayed, nice little 2 hour break out of the office).  We step outside for a smoke when he tells me he was told he doesn't have retainability for Germany and that his assignment is going to be cancelled.

This has me concerned because I only extended for Korea at this point.  As of right now, my DOS is in Sept of 2017, his in Aug of 2017, as he is leaving our current location before me.

My question is, what are the chances of my follow on being cancelled due to retainability?  Should I go ahead and look into re-enlisting?  I was hoping for the chance to maybe hold off until the next SRB list is released in the off chance that my AFSC is on there (Big AF keeps talking about needing to hold on to Cyber Airmen, yet don't bother to offer us a bonus).

Motherboard has 2 bad RAM slots.  Believe they are the blue slots.  Included I/O shield and small tube of Arctic Silver. Would really like to keep them together for convenience.
