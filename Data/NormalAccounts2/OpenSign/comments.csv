89,"Alcoholics at a certain point and beyond experience a reaction to alcohol, a craving, when they drink. They drink one and want more alcohol. They then get drunk. When they don't have alcohol, they obsess over drinking. They think of ways to acquire and use it. When they are not drinking, they are restless, irritable, and discontent.

The hard drinker may have appeared to be an alcoholic to the outside world, but when they quit, they do not have an obsession. They simply leave the drink alone or moderate.

That information is from the Big Book of of Alcoholics Anonymous. I have found it to be true in my experience. If you can't just quit without obsessing over alcohol and having to put in effort to stay sober, you might be an alcoholic. If it's easy to quit and you're having no ""cravings"" or obsession, then you might not be.

The Big Book suggests staying sober for a year without any help. If you can do that, then you might just be someone who didn't drink for a year.",2016-02-19 04:25:54+00:00,d05i0g8,1.0,t3_46ijs3,5318.0,stopdrinking

Your claim that drug companies have a secret plan to push drugs on doctors is by definition a conspiracy theory. This makes the idea that your claims were conspiratory true. It doesn't mean that you're wrong or you're crazy. It just means that you're talking about conspiracies.

375,"I have the same thing you have. When I drink, I lose control. More accurate, I have no desire to control. I drink as much as I can until I blackout or am too drunk to drink. The thing is, alcohol never brought me consequences. I never lived under a bridge. I barely got in trouble. I have not drank much. I got sober under 21.

I also have an obsession with alcohol. Even recently I will dream about relapsing. I notice every liquor store. This summer I was begging myself to relapse, thinking about it all the time.

These two things put together make me an alcoholic as defined in the Doctor's Opinion in The Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous. I'm in the early stage of alcoholism. If I had continued I would have gotten the consequences you speak of.

389,"I didn't see what kind it was. I was pumped full of it with a two-liter and plastic bag ""third lung"" contraption. I got very high. Everything seemed like I was watching a movie. I started walking around the parking lot. I could hear sirens and was convinced I was having a heart attack and they were coming for me. Someone was on the phone and I thought they were talking to 911. I was driven home at some point. I couldn't see in the car. My friend explained I needed to focus on one point and pull everything together. I started to see again after pulling my perception of my body back together.

I feel like I was somehow damaged by the experience. I don't have any proof. But sometimes today I realize that I'm perceiving things as if I'm watching a movie. I tripped NBOMe 25i two years ago and my perception was right again. I was able to be connected to my perception in a way that hadn't happened in years. The second trip of the 25i actually set me off on a long psychosis, so it's not a solution to any problem.

I don't do drugs anymore. I've been clean for over a year and seven months. I am bipolar I, and a bad manic episode resulted in me getting clean. The same manic episode I was in when I tripped 25i.

Perhaps my bipolar was the cause of the bad trip on spice. I know I was bipolar before the spice, but it could have made it worse. I know the other drugs I did made it worse.",2015-09-16 02:52:26+00:00,cv345qz,5.0,t1_cv33k4i,1134.0,Futurology
