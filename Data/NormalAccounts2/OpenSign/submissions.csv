Things were so bad for me. Awful. I had a lot of problems, including alcoholism. Recovery in general has been good to me. AA helps me be happy with being sober. I have friends now. I didn't have friends. I can go to certain meetings knowing that we'll all go out to dinner and play board games.

Life is so good. I thought my life was over. Now I have a good internship and I've gotten through almost 7 semesters of school.

I walked up to the counter and this dude is behind it. I order my number two Big John and a large water cup. A large water cup costs 25Â¢ and is a regular or large drink cup used only for water. The total came out to seven dollars or so. I was suprised but figured it was resonable. He handed me a large cup after I paid. While waiting on my sandwich I thought about it more. I realized he probably charged me for a large drink. So when my sandwich came I asked for the reciept. Sure enough, he charged me for the full drink. So I got a Poweraid instead of water. It was delicious.

I was a habitual smoker. I got high as much as I could. I even tried to become a dealer in order to support my habit. I almost got arrested with enough to cause some serious consequences. I was driving myself crazy (psychotic) with marijuana and psychedelics. In rehab I was diagnosed bipolar I. I spent my clean date in a car on the side of the road completely out of my mind. I was rescued by police officers and EMTs. They took me to the psych ward (again) where I finally started returning to sanity. I had been psychotic for over a year.

Marijuana played a huge role in my demise. I continued to smoke despite paranoia, anxiety, hearing voices, and hallucinations that occurred when I got high. I was addicted. They say weed isn't addictive, but they only mean one won't have physical withdrawals like heroin gives someone.

To get clean from marijuana, I started going to NA. I later moved to AA. That may seem weird, but AA and NA are very similar and AA is used by many people for all their addictions. I am also an alcoholic, so it was an easy fit.

I spent the last year of my using isolated and alone. I would talk to a therapist once a week for an hour about whatever craziness was on my mind. The rest of my social interaction was saying ""thank you"" to the McDonald's employees. I am an extrovert so it was particularly painful to be so isolated. Today I have friends and my family back in my life. I very rarely want to smoke weed, and when I do I call my sponsor and pray.",leaves,Two years and two days since I last got high,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/43a6f1/two_years_and_two_days_since_i_last_got_high/

That was the worst day of my life. That day had nothing to do with alcohol, but I've been clean and sober from all substances since then. I got clean because I was literally driving myself crazy (psychotic) with substances. In rehab I went to a beginners AA meeting and was educated about alcoholism. I realized that I am an alcoholic. When I drink I crave more drinks until I'm too drunk to drink. When I'm not drinking I'm either high or obsessing about drugs and alcohol. 

After finding out I am bipolar I and can no longer smoke weed and do psychedelics for fear of a repeat of losing my mind, my focus turned to alcohol. Over the past year I have experienced the obsession for alcohol. I had turned 21 in sobriety and now had the ability to relapse easily. I would pour gatorade and imagine it was alcohol. I sat in meetings and stared at water bottles imaging they were alcohol. I drove past liquor stores and begged myself to turn into the parking lot and buy some booze. But I kept reaching out to fellow alcoholics and addicts, calling my sponsor, praying, and asking for help. I'm still struggling with the Higher Power thing, but I kept asking for the protection against the first drink and drug. I received it. The obsession has left me. I now sponsor a man. I picked up my chip on Wednesday, and I can't remember everything my sponsor said when he gave me it, but it was all uplifting. 

I got sober through AA, despite being an addict in addition to alcoholism. I know that AA may not work for or  be attractive to everyone. I had periods where I believed I was in a cult. Today I see that while it may be somewhat religious in nature, it does keep me sober and connected to something greater than myself and my fellow alcoholics.

These past two years have been wonderful. I have recovered from a hopeless state of mind. I was so lost and alone. I know that if I return to drinking, even staying off drugs, I will lose everything I have gained.",stopdrinking,I am two years and two days clean and sober.,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/43a3fz/i_am_two_years_and_two_days_clean_and_sober/

It was an unique place. On the menu were burgers that came with Prohibition Pickles. We asked what they were and found out they were pickles that had been soaked in gin. No way was I going to eat those pickles! I got the burger with guacamole on it instead. It was a good choice.

For me, any amount of alcohol is too much. My sobriety is too important. I don't even eat Tiramisu, even though it's supposedly cooked out. Just tasting alcohol is too much of a risk for me. I hate smelling it whenever someone uses hand sanitizer.
