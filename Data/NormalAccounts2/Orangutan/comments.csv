In this interview, Belfast Telegraph reporter Matthew Bell asks Wikileaks founder Julian Assange about ""conspiracy theories"". Assange subsequently explains his position.

&gt;  *His obsession with secrecy, both in others and maintaining his own, lends him the air of a conspiracy theorist. Is he one? ""I believe in facts about conspiracies,"" he says, choosing his words slowly. ""Any time people with power plan in secret, they are conducting a conspiracy. So there are conspiracies everywhere. There are also crazed conspiracy theories. It's important not to confuse these two. Generally, when there's enough facts about a conspiracy we simply call this news."" What about 9/11? ""I'm constantly annoyed that people are distracted by false conspiracies such as 9/11, when all around we provide evidence of real conspiracies, for war or mass financial fraud."" What about the Bilderberg conference? ""That is vaguely conspiratorial, in a networking sense. We have published their meeting notes.""*

194,"&gt; In 1984, Clarke was selected to take part in one of the most highly classified projects of the Reagan Administration. This was the secret Continuity of Government (COG) program run by the National Program Office that continued up to and after the attacks of September 11. Other than Clarke, the members of the COG group included Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, George H.W. Bush, Kenneth Duberstein, and James Woolsey. If not a formal member of the group, Oliver North reported to it and acted on its behalf. Although Cheney and Rumsfeld were not government employees throughout the twenty years that Clarke participated in this official government program, they both continued to participate.

&gt; COG was developed to install a shadow “government in waiting” to replace the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Constitution in the event of a national emergency like a nuclear war. In 1998, Clarke revised the COG plan for use as a response to a terrorist attack on American soil. The first and only time that COG was put into action was when Richard Clarke activated it during the 9/11 attacks.

Turns out, it was ""just an exercise"", led by the military centre for nuclear, chemical, biological and radiological defense, allegedly of course. However no one was aware of the ""exercise"", including the local police and the anti-terror forces etc.., no one but some general in the army. The question is, why would they need ISIS flags and stuff in Arabic for an exercise, and a generator ? Why didn't they inform at least the local police that there was an exercise going on ? Because that's usually the case. Usually government officials are informed, and the local population too in some cases.

“It’s time for a full accounting of what happened, and an end to the misguided post-9/11 wars that are actually making us less safe, not more safe.”

“The families and friends of those who were murdered on 9/11 deserve justice. They also deserve to know the truth.”

“During the 2008 Democratic primary, Sid Blumenthal visited the Washington Bureau of McClatchy Co.,” Asher said in an email Friday to McClatchy, noting that he was at the time the investigative editor and in charge of Africa coverage.

“During that meeting, Mr. Blumenthal and I met together in my office and he strongly urged me to investigate the exact place of President Obama’s birth, which he suggested was in Kenya. We assigned a reporter to go to Kenya, and that reporter determined that the allegation was false.

Building 7 was a 47-story skyscraper and was part of the World Trade Center complex. Built in 1984, it would have been the tallest high-rise in 33 states in the United States. It collapsed at 5:20 pm on September 11, 2001. It was not hit by an airplane and suffered minimal damage compared to other buildings much closer to the Twin Towers.

[7 Facts about Building 7](http://rememberbuilding7.org/7-facts-about-building-7/)

1) If fire caused Building 7 to collapse, it would be the first ever fire-induced collapse of a steel-frame high-rise.

2) Building 7’s collapse was not mentioned in the 9/11 Commission Report.

3) According to a Zogby poll in 2006, 43% of Americans did not know about Building 7.

4) It took the federal government seven years to conduct an investigation and issue a report for Building 7.

5) 1,700+ architects and engineers have signed a petition calling for a new investigation into the destruction of Building 7, specifying that it should include a full inquiry into the possible use of explosives.

6) Numerous witnesses say the possibility of demolishing Building 7 was widely discussed by emergency personnel at the scene and advocated by the building’s owner.

7) Building 7 housed several intelligence and law enforcement agencies, and the NYC Office of Emergency Management’s Emergency Operations Center, more commonly known as “Giuliani’s Bunker”.

As executive director, Zelikow picked ""the areas of investigation, the briefing materials, the topics for hearings, the witnesses, and the lines of questioning for witnesses."" In effect, this was the man in charge of running the investigation itself.

""It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning."" -- Henry Ford

""All of the perplexities, confusion, and distress in America arises, not from the defects of the Constitution or Confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.""  -- John Adams

""The government should create, issue, and circulate all the currency and credit needed to satisfy the spending power of the government and the buying power of consumers. The privilege of creating and issuing money is not only the supreme prerogative of government, but it is the government’s greatest creative opportunity. The financing of all public enterprise, and the conduct of the treasury will become matters of practical administration. Money will cease to be master and will then become servant of humanity."" ~ Abraham Lincoln

“The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the large centers has owned the government of the U.S. since the days of Andrew Jackson.” – U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a letter written Nov. 21, 1933 to Colonel E. Mandell House. 

“If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their money, first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them, will deprive the people of their property until their children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.”
— Thomas Jefferson - in a letter to Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin ~~~&gt; Verification: http://wiki.monticello.org/mediawiki/index.php/Private_Banks_(Quotation)


""It is absurd to say our country can issue bonds and cannot issue currency. Both are promises to pay, but one fattens the usurer and the other helps the people."" -- Thomas Edison

“I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world - no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.”
— U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, a few years after authorizing the creation of the “Federal” Reserve

""Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men's views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the U.S., in the field of commerce and manufacturing, are afraid of somebody, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it."" ~ President Woodrow Wilson 1913",2016-08-02 14:28:28+00:00,d611cc7,1.0,t3_4vqdp5,41535.0,Documentaries

According to several Trump sources (and one Clinton source) who spoke to the Post, the two men spoke over the phone in late May, shortly before Trump announced his run in June. During the call, the Trump sources said, Clinton “encouraged Trump’s efforts to play a larger role in the Republican Party” and “analyzed Trump’s prospects and his desire to rouse the G.O.P. base.”

That conversation, said the anonymous Trump sources, certainly didn’t discourage the billionaire to run: while Clinton never outright told Trump to enter the race, he reportedly told Trump that he was “striking a chord with frustrated conservatives and was a rising force on the right,” and his tone was supposedly “encouraging.”

&gt; After becoming Director of the CIA (DCI) in 1997, George Tenet did what Louis Freeh had done after his appointment as FBI Director. He began to cultivate close personal relationships with the rulers of Saudi Arabia. Like Freeh, Tenet grew especially close to Prince Bandar, the Saudi ambassador to the United States. Bandar and Tenet often met at Bandar’s home near Washington yet Tenet did not share information from those meetings with his own officers who were handling Saudi issues at the Agency. The CIA’s Saudi specialists only learned about Tenet’s dealings with the Saudi authorities inadvertently, through their Saudi contacts. It seems that Tenet was operating within a network that surpassed the interests of the American public. Therefore the unsolved crimes of 9/11, attributed largely to young men from Saudi Arabia, should be considered in light of Tenet’s actions.

 What Was In Building 7?

Building 7 was one of New York City's larger buildings. A sleek bronze-colored skyscraper with a trapezoidal footprint, it occupied an entire city block and rose over 600 feet above street level.

Built in 1985, it was formerly the headquarters of the junk-bond firm Drexel Burnham Lambert, which contributed to the Savings and Loans collapse, prompting the $500-billion taxpayer-underwritten bailout of the latter 1980s. At the time of its destruction, it exclusively housed government agencies and financial institutions. It contained offices of the IRS, Secret Service, and SEC.

""All of the perplexities, confusion, and distress in America arises, not from the defects of the Constitution or Confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation."" -- John Adams

""The government should create, issue, and circulate all the currency and credit needed to satisfy the spending power of the government and the buying power of consumers. The privilege of creating and issuing money is not only the supreme prerogative of government, but it is the government’s greatest creative opportunity. The financing of all public enterprise, and the conduct of the treasury will become matters of practical administration.

What is Building 7?

Building 7 was a 47-story skyscraper and was part of the World Trade Center complex. Built in 1984, it would have been the tallest high-rise in 33 states in the United States. It collapsed at 5:20 pm on September 11, 2001. It was not hit by an airplane and suffered minimal damage compared to other buildings much closer to the Twin Towers.
7 Facts about Building 7

1) If fire caused Building 7 to collapse, it would be the first ever fire-induced collapse of a steel-frame high-rise.

2) Building 7’s collapse was not mentioned in the 9/11 Commission Report.

3) According to a Zogby poll in 2006, 43% of Americans did not know about Building 7.

4) It took the federal government seven years to conduct an investigation and issue a report for Building 7.

5) 1,700+ architects and engineers have signed a petition calling for a new investigation into the destruction of Building 7, specifying that it should include a full inquiry into the possible use of explosives.

6) Numerous witnesses say the possibility of demolishing Building 7 was widely discussed by emergency personnel at the scene and advocated by the building’s owner.

7) Building 7 housed several intelligence and law enforcement agencies, and the NYC Office of Emergency Management’s Emergency Operations Center, more commonly known as “Giuliani’s Bunker”.

Harold Washington was mayor, Michael Jordan had just signed with the Bulls, Oprah Winfrey was hosting a local morning show, and on the South Side a young man named Ben Wilson was the most talked-about basketball prospect in a city that was known for its great hoops talent. Handsome, gentle and magnetic, Ben Wilson's magical ability on the court was matched by his popularity in his school and neighborhood. In his junior year, he led Simeon High School to its first state championship. And that summer, he was named America's number-one high school basketball player by the nation's leading talent scouts.""*",2016-05-16 14:01:00+00:00,d37gzmc,1.0,t3_4jkf7a,15315.0,nba

This group produced a document entitled, ""Rebuilding America's Defenses"" that said the ""process of transformation"" they wanted our military to undertake would take an excessively long time, unless there was a ""catastrophic and catalyzing event - like a new Pearl Harbor."" That document was written in September 2000. This document even cited that ""advanced forms of biological warfare that can ""target"" specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool.""

2) Building 7’s collapse was not mentioned in the 9/11 Commission Report.

3) According to a Zogby poll in 2006, 43% of Americans did not know about Building 7.

4) It took the federal government seven years to conduct an investigation and issue a report for Building 7.

5) 1,700+ architects and engineers have signed a petition calling for a new investigation into the destruction of Building 7, specifying that it should include a full inquiry into the possible use of explosives.

6) Numerous witnesses say the possibility of demolishing Building 7 was widely discussed by emergency personnel at the scene and advocated by the building’s owner.

7) Building 7 housed several intelligence and law enforcement agencies, and the NYC Office of Emergency Management’s Emergency Operations Center, more commonly known as “Giuliani’s Bunker”.

Building 7 was a 47-story skyscraper and was part of the World Trade Center complex. Built in 1984, it would have been the tallest high-rise in 33 states in the United States. It collapsed at 5:20 pm on September 11, 2001.

Costello began bluntly: “It’s virtually impossible for Senator Sanders to win the nomination, so why is it Bernie or Bust for you?”

“You know, a lot of people, they perceive the Bernie or Bust movement as being something that’s almost like a temper tantrum for people who support Bernie,” Ndgo explained. “I think it’s really important for people to understand that Bernie or Bust is really a representation of how we feel about Hillary Clinton.

 I need to share a story with you, Ted. It will probably anger you, but hopefully it will also inspire you to take action in support of one of the most courageous people I’ve met during this campaign.

Lucy Flores was the first Latina assemblywoman in Nevada and made national news when she became one of the first elected officials to testify about an abortion she had at the age of 16.

During her 2014 campaign one D.C. pro-choice group, EMILY’s List, endorsed her and added that she was an ""inspiring community leader."" They even kicked off a program to elect more Latinas to Congress in 2016.

**But then Lucy Flores endorsed our political revolution before the Nevada caucus, and everything changed. EMILY’s List decided to endorse a different person in Lucy’s House race this time around. So I want to support Lucy like she’s supported us, because we stand together. And I am asking you to join me:**

Split a $3 contribution between our campaign and Lucy Flores today and send a powerful message that we are going to win this primary AND elect a Congress willing to stand up to the political establishment and billionaire class of this country.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/lucy-flores-for-congress?refcode=em160413-full

Throughout this campaign, I’ve told you that no candidate for president – not Bernie Sanders, not the greatest president you could possibly imagine – can take on the billionaire class alone.

Lucy Flores is exactly the kind of person I'm going to need in Congress when I am president. And we can help get her there. That’s why your contribution is so important.

Part 1 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pGg-rS26c4

Evidence of Revision is a 9 hour long documentary series whose purpose is to present the publicly unavailable and even suppressed historical audio, video, and film recordings largely unseen by the American public relating to the assassination of the Kennedy brothers, the little known classified Black Ops actually used to intentionally create the massive war in Viet Nam, the CIA ""mind control"" programs and their involvement in the RFK assassination and the Jonestown massacre and other important truths of our post-modern time.

The U.S. Government's Orwellian Office of Public Diplomacy has been in existence in various forms and under various names since World War ONE. The union of American governance and American corporate interests began in Abraham Lincoln's day and the massaging of public truth began even before the Roman Empire.

The more you know about real history versus official history, the better equipped you are to see behind the lies of our times, even as they are told to you. Some of us knew what was really happening even before the second plane hit the tower.

Episodes included:

    The Assassinations of Kennedy and Oswald,
    The Why of it all referenced to Viet Nam and LBJ,
    LBJ, Hoover and Others. What So Few Know Even Today,
    The RFK Assassination As Never Seen Before,

2104,"I own the website [9/11 Blogger](http://911blogger.com).  There were some finances that changed hands in I think 2013 with another leading 9/11 Truth organization, AE911Truth.org, and another owner of 9/11 Blogger.  I was not involved with this transaction and have never benefited financially from my work related to 9/11.

I don't see my ownership position with 9/11 Blogger being a conflict of interest with me being a moderator here, I got involved in all this madness because I became passionate about 9/11 Truth after seeing a talk online by David Ray Griffin in Madison WI in I think 2005 or 2006.

I was a good mod here whose goal was representing the interests of the users above all else.  I was voted in around the time of the fake Richard Gage AMA fiasco and during a time of upheaval with the moderation team in general.  (I can't currently find the open thread where the community vote took place)  

I since brought in quality AMA's with [James Corbett, Russ Baker, and Bill Still](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3l3g7y/announcement_changes_to_the_rconspiracy_mod_team/) and fought for stricter standards of proof for all AMA's as a general rule going forward.

Like [user jacks1000](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3l3g7y/announcement_changes_to_the_rconspiracy_mod_team/cv2ue0m) I think people like Kevin Ryan, David Ray Griffin, Richard Gage, and Neils Harrit are people worth promoting while others are not.  My user history will show that.

With the way Reddit [has gone over the years](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2nhv01/how_reddit_was_destroyed_ver20/), I'd continually question the mods and criticize actions you think take away from the validity and legitimacy of the subreddit.  One mod, AssuredlyAThrowAway advocated for the outright banning of AE911Truth as a url on this subreddit.  Other mods have tried to stifle and limit what I consider legitimate criticism by overusing Rule 10.

I value quality investigative journalism and hope to see many more posts with links to organizations and people doing just that!!
