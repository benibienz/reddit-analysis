25yo, 6'1 245lbs. First pic is me at around 252 and second picture was today. Still trying to lean out and cut down to 200-210lbs. 

Diet is consisting of about 150g of protein, 70g of fat and 40g of carbs on a daily basis. Approx 1400-1600kcals.

Squat: 455lbs X 5

DL: 405lbs X 5

Bench: 285lbs X 5

At this point you're not in the relationship 100% so there is no reason to be in it. It will only hurt her more and breaking up with her will suck at first but she will get through it. A break up is better than years of ""trying to get through it because I love her and i'm close with her family"" trust me on that one. A distant relationship is far worse than a break up. Eventually she'll be happy and it's your happiness that should come first.

126,"In trials you need to be more wary of sniper lanes. Its way more of a team effort than any game mode to isolating a player trying to flank and knowing when to be aggressive is key. Flanking can win and lose you games, making sure its coordinated with your team mates is crucial, a 3v3 can turn into a 3v2 very quickly with an orb in their territory. 

Decide whether or not you'll use your super early or later. Some supers can be utilized better as shut down supers for other supers or used to close out a match or come back.

Stick to your game plan and adjust accordingly. Most of my losses come from straying from the game plan or being stubborn and playing to the other teams strengths. They're using scout rifles and sniping from the stairs in Asylum? Push into the middle room and play the waiting game, push them back with grenades and wait for them to get impatient, or perhaps send one guy underneath to mess with their radar and begin raiding their area. 

Their loadouts show what kind of style they play so try to build a game plan off of that and adjust if needed. If I see shotguns side arms and TLW I assume they'll rush mid in Asylum and have a guy hop the railing from mid or hop up the stairs.

There is a lot of thought that goes into trials and I have found just playing it every weekend has put me in a comfortable place with my team and our chemistry.

No one is saying his concussion invalidates the play. The action was bad and he is being disciplined for it as he should. My original point was A LOT of hockey fans immediately jumped to the conclusion he's a maniac and couldn't even think maybe he has a concussion and wasn't all there. 

Again that doesn't excuse the action. Nothing would. Concussions can mix any amount of emotion or action, you could walk 5 miles naked and not remember how you ended up in a bath tub or you may lay there motionless. Unless you are a concussion expert with damning evidence that concussions affect every person on the planet the exact same you can't just rule out his concussion played no part.

242,"Subban is one of my favourite players and I believe a lot of people mistake his passion for dirty childish hockey. His tantrums are a result of how engaged he is in the game, He doesn't care about how he look he cares about winning. That being said it does look bad. 

His dirty plays are often put under a microscope, not saying he has never made a dirty play but if people would take a moment to realize how fast the game is going, how fast his mind is moving and how desperate he is to win a puck battle then I imagine there would be fewer people throwing a tantrum at everything he does. 

His embellishment (in my opinion) is a product of the way he skates and uses his body. Im sure there is a video out there that shows him clearly embellishing but there are many instances where its not and he is criticized again. I skate the same way as he does and use my body the same way and I have fallen in similar easy ways that definitely looks to be embellishment from an outside perspective but I can assure you I have no fucking clue how I fell. Yes, I know Subban is a professional athlete and I am not.

251,Yea. A lot of over reaction ITT. Retaining salary and getting rid of an elite scorer sucks. However you guys are loading up on prospects. TOR is in a better position now than they were yesterday in terms of rebuilding like they said they would. Reilly Marner Kapanen Dermott Harrington Nylander.. Thats a pretty good young core of players. ,2015-07-01 17:41:32+00:00,csowoir,2.0,t1_csoweq3,395,hockey
252,Doubt there will be as much regret as you seem to believe. Flames have cap space and aren't tied up in anything so there wont be regret in locking up a 22yr old 40+pt scoring D man because he's already better than what we had. I bet the Avs would love a franchise D man for 5.75AAV x 6,2015-06-30 18:32:07+00:00,csnt8xx,4.0,t1_csnr52x,3114,hockey
253,Oh I know trust me. I'm just saying giving today they were on a short leash going into the draft. So its easy for anyone to make fun of them. ,2015-06-27 01:27:24+00:00,csk2zea,6.0,t1_csk2vre,200,hockey
254,"If I were a Bruins fan I would be infuriated after using the pick that sent a solid young D man off to select a player projected ~25 picks lower. Looking at the players left on the board at 14 &amp;amp; 15 and the picks the Bruins have in the 2nd round its an easy thing to criticize.

255,Making trades like they did today then picking off the board is why it's criticized. If you're trading for picks you better be on the money with those picks. ,2015-06-27 01:09:19+00:00,csk2ft9,2.0,t1_csk2bgh,231,hockey
