A little background: 


My mom is from a country known as the Solomon Islands. It's in my opinion earths best kept secret, as any time I tell anyone what my background is (bi-racial) they seem confused or assume I meant Samoan. She has told me countless stories about her country mostly relating to black magic, guardians and devils but the story that keeps me up is a story that both she and my uncle told me while I was staying with my family on an Island called Kenelo. Kenelo has an enormous mountain absolutely filled with forestry, while walking on the man made path around the mountain you can barely see 5 feet in. 



I'll try to tell the story as best as I can remember from my uncles point of view. 

""When I was a young man in my 20s I was not a good person. I practiced black magic and thought I was invincible. Being the youngest brother I always thought I had a point to prove. 

There is a legend on this Island known as the crying woman. They say that when you hear her crying faintly she is very close to you, right up against your door or window waiting for you to leave your home and look for her in order to get you lost in the mountains forestry. When her cries are loud and it sounds like she is right outside of your home she is far away waiting for you up in the mountain. 

Being a young adult I was curious. I heard her cries one evening when it was pouring rain, it was faint but I could definitely make it out. I checked the windows and the doors and didn't see anything so I went outside of the house. My body froze, (the way he explained it sounded like a mixture of vertigo and paralysis) and all I could see was a glowing white figure waiting for me by the forests' edge. From what I remember she was beautiful but it felt menacing yet for some reason I couldn't help myself and I continued on. 


I don't remember how long I hiked up the mountain after her but what felt like an hour or two in I started hearing branches being viciously chopped down. I had no idea what was going on and I was scared because it was as if machetes were cutting everything in their way to get to me. It stopped right before me and what I can only describe as two phantasms were standing before me holding large machetes. I felt a strong head rush almost instantly and almost collapsed from what felt like dehydration and kind of came to my senses. The two figures disappeared and cut down a path for me to the bottom of the mountain where I found my way home. 


I made it back home and the day was bright and I remember seeing your aunt and she ran to me crying. Apparently I had been on the mountain for over 36 hours""


A few night after I was told this story I experienced the crying woman. Our house was small so my younger brother and I shared a small room. We all had tiny windows and large shutters covered most of the living area. One night when it was deafly quiet I heard the faint cry and I froze in fright. I didn't want to open my eyes but as most people would do I opened them and peaked over my brothers head at our window. Al I remember seeing was what looked like an indigenous old woman with a hood on, I quickly closed my eyes and shoved my face into the pillow but it continued through the night. My whole body shivered, i felt like I couldn't talk and had trouble breathing which I assumed was because of shock. 

A few night later my older brothers girlfriend had a similar experience. Our family was playing cards in the living area and my brothers girlfriend had gone to bed but their room wasn't more than 10 feet from the table we sat on. At one point my brother jumped up and said something doesn't feel right. He went straight to his room to find his girlfriend motionless and unable to move or talk. All of my aunts and my mom slept in a protection circle around her that night. She said she heard the cries as well but then something else kicked in, she explained it as if 100 hands came underneath her and held her down. She tried to call for our help for hours but her mouth felt covered and she couldn't speak. 



 I have more stories but I would have to talk to my mom to get the full details. Sorry if my formatting is bad this is my first post here after reading the SAR and forestry posts.
