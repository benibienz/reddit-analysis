During the whole IWI Bank scandal event, my friend Casmeron bought a Nag contract which was 400mil under price from a IWI Bank person. CCP then temp banned all of his accounts and he has yet to be unbanned. Both of us understand temp banning people who bought contracts from IWI Bank people, but a 25 minute investigation into his Account(s) will show that he has (had now I guess :( ) no relation to them.

CCP just has to fucking look at his accounts to see he is completely innocent. ",2016-11-20 05:52:04+00:00,da7w76y,3.0,t1_da7vrim,901.0,Eve

no. This is wrong. On top of the other roles new players can have, being tackle is not a simple one. It's not clicking Approach and that's it.

&gt;Being a new character you obviously wont beat a old one

no. It doesn't work like that. The older characters dominating the new characters doesn't happen in a game like EVE Online. It's not cut-and-dry like that.


&gt;You as a player don't really improve, it's just knowing when to turn guns on or press a button. 

What. The. Fuck.

Can you explain why this is so: ""When the determinant us zero for the linearization matrix, it means that the eigenvalues can change sign and thus change stability."" ?

I think my confusion comes from not understanding what linearization means and how it affects my system.  Maybe if you explain that?

Maybe you all will play EVE as a ""main"" game, but occasionally you'll play some random Steam games or (god forbid) Dota2. 

Gameplay wise your ship can definitely play a major role in a fight. Scouting ahead of the fleet can literally save the fleet your with, catch an enemy fleet fucking up their positioning, or whatever. It's extremely important and you can do this day 1.

One concern I had with my argument was this:

Say after I split the 18-graph up into a 4-Red graph and a 5-Blue graph and a 9-graph, does this already imply that a 6-Happy graph is contained within the 18-graph?

Note that all of the above cliques are fully connected with each other since they all came from a 18-graph which is connected. Therefore, why not consider the 5-blue graph and a single red node from the 4-red graph? The red node is fully connected to the 5-blue graph so therefore we have a 6-graph which is happy.

Can we simply stop there? Doesn't that mean we can also it contains a [(some # of nodes in red clique) + (some # of nodes in blue clique)]-happy graph?

This is a concern for me because this *feels* too strong. And if it feels too strong there must be something I am overlooking. ",2015-11-30 20:06:16+00:00,cxi94rs,8.0,t1_cxi8nma,683.0,learnmath

The vertices may be colored red or blue. 

Let's examine what H(4) may be. If I give you a 4-graph edge colored in some way (edges are still red or blue), can you always find a vertex coloring such that the 4-graph is Happy?  No -- consider the 4-graph where the four outer edges are blue and the two inner diagonals are red. There is no vertex coloring such that this 4-graph is Happy. Therefore, H(4) is not 4 (and clearly H(4) &gt; 3).

835,"Yes, by an n-graph I do indeed mean a complete graph on n vertices.  By ""contain"" I mean a clique (complete subgraph). Here is a (sideways) picture to help http://imgur.com/52Rm8fm I should clarify and rephrase the ""Happy"" definition.


**Definition:** A graph is *Happy* if there exists a vertex coloring such that each edge touches at least one vertex of its own color.

The key word here being ""exists"".

Let's consider H(3). H(3) is the size of the smallest complete graph that is **forced** to contain a 3-Happy graph (A 3-graph which is happy). Well, draw a couple 3-graphs with the edges already colored. Can you find a ""valid"" vertex coloring? Does there always exist a valid vertex coloring? You will find that the answer is ""yes"". 

Therefore, H(3)=3.

However, when examining H(4), you will find that for a particular 4-graph, there exists no valid vertex coloring. Hence, H(4) is NOT 4. 

It becomes very difficult to find the exact value of H(n) for larger values of n. So we turn to Ramsey Numbers / Ramsey Theory.

In previous work, I showed that H(7) &lt;= 18 by using ramsey numbers. I always know that I have bound H(6) &lt;= H(7), so I wanted to show that the least upperbound for H(6) is 18. Therefore implying that H(7) = 18.

So in the case of a all blue 3-graph, we can pick all blue vertices and then it can be called special. In fact, any edge coloring for a 3-graph is special since there exists a vertex coloring s.t. each edge touches a vertex of its own color. 

The **real question** is if we can put bounds on the smallest graphs that are **forced** to contain a ""special"" graph. I denote this by H(s) where s is the size of the ""special"" graph.

Start off by letting u = arccos(x). Then du = - \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}dx. Continue from there and then apply trig' substitution where needed.

I am currently attending an REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) which has a strong chance of publishing a small paper. I am hoping that this, combined with the fact that I have supplemented my undergraduate Analysis courses with the graduate versions at my university will help my application (As part of an undergraduate Masters Fast Track option). I have given poster presentations, spoken at one undergraduate conference, and am due to speak at another one this Fall. I am also hoping that my recommendation letters will be fairly good.

I was not aware that my grades this Fall would appear on my applications. Are not most applications due before the Fall semester ends?

If I do not get into a program during my first pass, I do not know what i'll do with my life. It's terrifying to think about, but I should have put in more effort into my classes. ",2015-06-21 19:50:34+00:00,cse27mq,4.0,t1_cse1qzr,938.0,math
