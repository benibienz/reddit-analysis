 We have complete graphs, edge colored red or blue &amp; vertex red or blue, such that each edge touches a vertex of its own color. The question is, do these graphs (size p+q) contain graphs of size R(p,q) (the ramsey number of p and q).


It's also important to note a side thing about the edge colored graphs. Their property allows the graph to be partitioned into monochromatic cliques.

So for example, a 4-graph with our property described about would contain a graph of size n = R(2,2), R(3,1),R(1,3).

I think the proof lies within the fact the graphs can be partitioned into cliques of size a and b. Consider a graph with one of our properties. It is size p+q. By our property defined above, it can be partitioned into two monochromatic cliques. The Ramsey Number is the least integer n s.t. the n-graph contains a p-clique or q-clique and is denoted as R(p,q). So a n-graph contains a p-clique or a q-clique. 

The graphs with our special property will contain a p-clique OR q-clique in it's partition since .... i'm having trouble formalizing this.

We are new-player friendly, quite active, and have a fully integrated set of in and out of game services to guide your merry way into the action.


**What we offer**

- We have a fully integrated AUTH platform bringing you forums, a wiki, voice comms (mumble), and jabber (text communication).
- A basic SRP (ship replacement program) for not only fleet ships, but solo ships as well! Get paid to die! Valuable SOV space to make dollar dollar for all your isk making needs, ratting, PI, and industry.
- A Mentor program for newer players. Along with skillbooks and free or lowcost ships.
- Close knit community of players
- Variety of fleets, we have many smallgang roams into syndicate going to fight the npc null locals, fleets going into fountain to poke at fountain-core, fights over structures utilizing capitals, and a fun fleet every week with a different doctrine each time.



Currently, there are several entities living in Cloud Ring. J4LP, Pandemic Horde, Waffles, Brave, SMA, Suddenly Spaceship, The Irukandji, and The Culture (1 jump out). This all means that there is a shit ton of content and currently, Cloud Ring is one of the most active regions in the game with W-4 being the hot-spot system (PHorde). We are looking for players who would fit in well with the culture/community that we have. That is, we are looking for people are not into ""extreme elite pvp"" and are rather looking to have some fun in this game. Kill a few dreads/caps here and there, kill some Pandas, who knows!

Below are the criteria I have found in order to be claimed as a Dependent from one of my parents:

-  The child must be your son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, brother, sister, half brother, half sister, stepbrother, stepsister, or a descendant of any of them. 

-  The child must be (a) under age 19 at the end of the year and younger than you (or your spouse if filing jointly), (b) under age 24 at the end of the year, a student, and younger than you (or your spouse if filing jointly), or (c) any age if permanently and totally disabled.  

-  The child must have lived with you for more than half of the year.2 

-  The child must not have provided more than half of his or her own support for the year. 

-  The child must not be filing a joint return for the year (unless that joint return is filed only to claim a refund of withheld income tax or estimated tax paid).

I fail each critera except (b). I am under the age of 24 and am still a student. However, neither of the parents support me. So, may I still file myself as an Exemption?  

""You can take one exemption for yourself unless you can be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer. If another taxpayer is entitled to claim you as a dependent, you cannot take an exemption for yourself even if the other taxpayer does not actually claim you as a dependent."" is what worries me.
