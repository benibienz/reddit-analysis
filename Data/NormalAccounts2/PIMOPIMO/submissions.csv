The music is fantastic, but sonically it's shit.

Muddy, distorted, and painful to listen to. I'm With You and I'm Beside You suffered with this loudness crap as well, but not as severe as the Getaway. It really distracts from the goodness of this work.

It's got everything, minus a solo--great lyrics, time changes, varied instrumentation, killer riff, killer bassline, classic vocals, tom rolls, double bass, and the mystical middle. And I think Hemispheres probably has the best mix and production of any Rush album. There are close seconds, like Red Barchetta, but I think Circumstances is Rushiest. I've been listening to Rush since 1977, and I love all eras.
