Also as cheesy as it sounds Disney and Universal are worth your time if you're in the area.  Other than that its pretty much Fuji-Q and Nagashima.  But if you're going to be in Japan, there is so much more than rollercoasters.  Mainly the food go get you some cocos i'd kill for that stuff now that I'm back in the states.",2016-10-16 01:08:35+00:00,d8tri2a,3,t1_d8tr5f4,531,rollercoasters
6,"Yes! I lived in Japan for 2 years.  but there's a lot there so lets make a list!

Nagashima first...

* **Steel Dragon 2000**: Best ride in the park! however still a bigger morgan hyper when it comes down to it.  but those B&amp;M trains are quite nice.

* **Acrobat**: A B&amp;M flyer fun but not anything special or unique imo.

* **White Cyclone**: DO NOT RIDE UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR SPINE RIPPED IN TWO.

* **Ultra Twister**: fun but nearly as rough as everyone made the togo pipelines out to be.



Most everything else there was pretty tame and not worth mentioning tbh.  However there is an intamin freefall which I'm always a sucker for.

Now onto Fuji-Q!

* **Fujiyama**: old, rough, and painful.  I rode it for the credit and let it be
* **Dodonpa**: definitely a one trick pony with a long slow wait.  That being said, that launch is the most intense launch i've experienced and I'm pretty sure that it will always hold that spot for me.
* **Eejanaika**: Its the only S&amp;S 4D I've ridden and I loved every bit of it.
* **Takabisha**: I think this ride is the most robust of any in the park it has it all so to say with the launch, all the inversions, and the drop.

Fuji-Q is a lot easier to get to than Nagashima as it has a train station connected to it that gives you somewhat easy access from Tokyo.  But the best roller coaster I've ridden in Japan is still the thunder dolphin at Tokyo Dome City.  There are some cultural differences in how they operate their coasters.  Mainly, no matter how tame the ride you must put **ALL** your belongings in a locker and wear the locker key bracelet when you ride even if that bracelet is less secure than what you put in the locker.  this makes their loading times a lot slower and is quite infuriating if you don't have an open mind about it.  I'd be more than happy to answer any other questions you might have as well.
