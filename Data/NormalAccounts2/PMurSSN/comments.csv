23,"There are many calories estimators out there.  I'm sure some one can recommend one specific to very active people.  Here is a basic one as example.

[http://www.calorieking.com/interactive-tools/how-many-calories-should-you-eat/?ref=nav](http://www.calorieking.com/interactive-tools/how-many-calories-should-you-eat/?ref=nav)

CMC's comment below talks about Matt Fitzgerald's book which will give really good advice.

However, if you are not at least doing some general calorie counting, then any target number is of no use. There are certainly websites that will tell you ""Eat This = Losing Weight"" but keep in mind that losing weight, especially during Ironman training is much more complicated.  You will have big training days, small recovery days, and following a plan that says eat XXXX calories every day will be very difficult to improve fitness and lose weight.  I strongly recommend counting at least the calories.  It doesn't have to be perfect you should have some gauge as to how you are doing.  I have never tried what Pack_of_wolves says above, but if a tracking device syncs to an app that sounds like it would be ideal.",2016-04-05 20:38:49+00:00,d1r6xta,3.0,t1_d1r14bm,7075.0,triathlon

25,"Weight loss is made in the kitchen. Start counting calories.  Do you need that soda? Does that handful of pretzels add anything?

Start counting and monitoring now as a baseline.  As your training picks up watch how you feel. Are you tired after a run because you exercised or because you ran out of juice with a mile to go? Adjust your calories as needed.  Make sure you are getting all your vitamins and protein.

MyFitnessPal is a great tool for counting calories.  I personally am a little skeptical of their calculated calories burned per an exercise but it could be a good tool for you.",2016-04-05 02:42:02+00:00,d1q80in,1.0,t3_4de39r,6624.0,triathlon

For specific work outs I would recommend (as many other probably) sprint intervals (aka HIIT).  I also like to add some weight lifting to my training.

You can also add lunges, single leg squats, box jumps, etc. Anything to get the glutes and hammies more engaged.

29,"Heyo- Welcome to triathlon.  I am also a former (and current) marathoner converted to triathloner.  The distance is really up to you and how much time you are willing to train.  I ran my first tri as a 70.3 about 5 months after my previous marathon with about a 10-12 hr/week training.  Just be aware that there is a big difference between running and running after a long bike.  The ""jelly"" leg feeling is impossible to prepare for unless you have already experienced it. 



My suggestion is to find a training plan for the distance you choose.  Taper back the running a little bit and add to the cycling and swimming portions. After **every** bike ride, go for a short run.  Doesn't have to be a long bike-run brick.  Even if you only run for a mile or 5 mins, the feeling of the first few steps after a ride is something unique.




And practice your transitions! Nothing worse than realizing you forgot a race belt or sock or sunglasses or nutrition when you need it most.
