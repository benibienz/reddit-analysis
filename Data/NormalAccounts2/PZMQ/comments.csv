Long answer: Because they know they can get away with it - They have been using the same formula because it works; sell base game, sell premium, sell optional microtransactions, etc. if gamers didn't buy it then EA would get the message... but most gamers do a whole lot of talking with little to no action. Developers/publishers will do as many things as they can get away with...when it comes to EA they have been getting away with a whole lot of bullshit.

You have to understand, EA is a business first their goal is to make as much money possible, they have a board of directors where they sit and discuss ways to monetize games for maximum profit... so really the developers decision comes last to theirs - you can blame DICE LA / EA DICE for being sellouts but at the same time you have to blame EA For being money hungry.",2016-05-07 00:51:20+00:00,d2vv145,1.0,t3_4i7w7a,1495.0,Games

Where do you see 20%

First you say a $820 brand new pc performs ""way better"" than the system I am selling, I shut that down and now you say that foolish stuff.

Please stop acting like you know what you're talking about, you sound ridiculous - I checked your post history and you just started learning about PC hardware 5 months ago. Not saying that's a bad thing but you clearly still need more learning to do.

No it wont perform way better, if anything 9% way better so here I'll do you a favor to make you feel better since you're so dedicated that you replied 3 times back to back - I'll let it go for $750, and I know from research that you currently cannot build a brand new computer that performs better than mine for $750... plus everything of mine is overclockable, the cpu/gpu/ram can OC like crazy.
