* Dear ""sjw's""! Congrats on getting Trump elected with your non stop, self righteous, annoying identity politics bullshit.    
    
* ""But how could anyone vote for a scumbag like Trump?"" Good question, it's because millennials are that annoying.    
    
* I mean tell yourself everyone is just stupid and racist and that's the only reason. If it helps u sleep.    
    
* But deep down u know that your wannabe 60's abrasive protest bullshit makes people wanna see u cry.    
    
* The alleged left we have here eats its own and wastes time calling out Halloween costumes and ""problematic"" entertainment &amp; other nonsense    
    
* Well I called the shit on my much maligned FB. Trump is the mutation of the hope that got Obama elected.    
    
* Shit it's almost like self righteous progressive millennials bleating regurgitated academic garbage at their elders doesn't actually help!    
    
* Oh shit, so policing everyone's social media like a cop no one asked for DOESN'T actually help ANYONE? Just creates Trumpies? No shit?    
    
* Welp, I guess I'll have to dig my white male privilege out of my closet and get it dry cleaned. I hope it still fits after all these years!    
    
* Fucking picking Hilary over Bernie? Really Dems? U thought this was the year of establishment wins? Bernie could have won.    
    
* Hey maybe next time before we cream our skinny jeans over the possibility of a woman president, put a little thought WHICH woman?    
    
* Like one who could beat a nitwit like Trump? That kind of woman? I know the 30 and unders LOVED her, bc they are too young to know better.    
    
* That was the entire media creating a false reassuring narrative to liberals. About how they will win by virtue of being ""the good ones.""    
    
* In this little babyface vs. heel election pageant. A huge swath of the country prefers heel it turns out.    
    
* Instead of having the charisma of vaginal mesh, Hilary should have just tried wearing vag mesh as a toupe like Trump does.    
    
* I didn't vote for Trump, but I am enjoying watching MSNBC cry like Fox news did when Obama got in.    
    
* And I'm also enjoying many of your histrionic progressive boo hoo tweets. Didn't take u long to act exactly like the thing u hate, eh progs?    
    
* The joy of watching progressives tweet ""there is no god"" when they already didn't believe in god and took great pride in yelling it.    
    
* Progressives in US are overwhelmingly as petty and dogmatic as any fuckwit baptist, except without the love and forgiveness of Jesus.    
    
* Ah fuck it yeah I'm enjoying this I'll be honest. Watching this sjw garbage machine weep. HAW HAW u confidently thought u were winning!    
    
* ""But how could they vote Trump after the things he SAID!"" Shit! It's almost like speech police don't actually have any real authority, huh?    
    
* Dems got all caught up in that youth vote shit because of Obama, then ran an establishment snake out of cockiness.    
    
* In fairness to the dems, I'm sure they never dreamed anyone could lose to this orange nitwit.    
    
* This wasn't Hilary vs. Trump. It was Hilary vs. The memories of people over 30. Bernie absolutely could have won.    
    
* Shut up it's not a problem with polling, the news. People lied to the pollsters bc they were savvy enough not to seem racist.    
    
* And once again that is progressives' fault. All your little speech rules don't end bigotry, they just make bigots smarter.    
    
* And yeah it's on u, progressives. Can't tell u enough. U have become worse than the religious right. I hope u start allowing dissent again.    
    
* If u don't see how this election was a direct ""fuck u"" to how fascist the pc shit has gotten, u are in for 8 full years of Trump. Take it.    
    
* Also, every Bushwick dipshit with a tight stripey shirt and a civl war beard got Trump elected just by existing. Don't leave them out.    
    
* Alright sorry. It's just after I read how every shitty lying blogger who went after me was working directly w Clinton campaign, I got gloaty    
    
* Hahahaha cmon that's kinda funny. Hilary's campaign thought Sady Doyle would really help get the message out.    
    
* ""Oh shit does this mean the patriarchy isn't dismantled???"" - college girl too young to remember Hilary is an integral part of patriarchy.    
    
* How come democrats want politicians as kings and cops like employees, but repubs like their politicians as employees and cops like kings?    
    
* Do u notice that? Republicans hate government love police and democrats exact opposite.    
    
* I like how the people horrified that Trump said he may not accept results of election may not accept the results of this election.    
    
* It it's any consolation, by the time we got to the pussy grab scandal it was already too late. It was too late when u nominated Hilary.    
    
* As much as I trashed Trump, I'm blown away how shocked some of u are. U really thought your status quo garbage pick was a sure thing?    
    
* Save the ""I weep for this nation"" shit. Your self righteousness is positively George W in scope.    
    
* To every sjw moron who has said the following: ""I don't have time to educate u!"" Maybe next time find the time, dipshit.    
    
* Ahahahaha what does this election mean for the kind of person on twitter who wants to be paid for their ""emotional labor?""    
    
* I mean I'm not saying he's a good woman president. But I thought it doesn't matter as long as he's a woman    
    
* Ah fuck it. I deleted that joke. I'll do it on stage and post on Patreon. I like it too much to tweet it.    
    
* Wow even less introspection that republicans had when Obama won, eh fellow liberals?    
    
* It must be everyone is evil and racist and hates women, not that u are shrill awful and dismissive. Oh and u try to crush dissent.    
    
* As much as I despised Trump, your fucking bubble needed popping.    
    
* It's almost like u jamming your horseshit ""intersectionality"" studies down these people's throats made them want to vote against u, huh?    
    
* ""Buh buh buh my group labeled Trump a racist misogynist! How could he still win?"" Gee it's almost like u cried wolf one too many times huh?    
    
* Same people who scoffed when i said Trump was gonna win scoff when I say Bernie would have won. Does your bubble EVER pop?    
    
* I get how maybe Hilary seemed great compared to Trump, but how do u ignore that she is grade-A prime patriarchy? Being young? Is that it?    
    
* Ironically it was liberals who couldn't get over Hilary having a vagina. A Clinton dynasty is not a win for all women. It's more patriarchy    
    
* How bout next time u try talking with people instead of trying to destroy them for not swallowing every last drop of your piss like ideas?    
    
* Like maybe working class whites weren't gonna respond to having a privileged college kid yell ""privilege"" at them. Did that occur to u?    
    
* God no wonder I can never join a movement. How nauseating it is for me to be liberal and have to look at what liberals are now.    
    
* Democrats absolutely deserved to lose. U thought it went without saying that your side should win bc u are ""the good ones."" Arrogant.    
    
* All the people lefties gleefully spit on and dismissed kinda had a bug up their ass about it it turned out. U became a religion.    
    
* Exhibit A: Dems took a fucking compromised corrupt establishment lizard person and tried to sell her as the ""feminist candidate.""    
    
* ""What do I tell my daughter?"" Tell her she has to be actually qualified and not just slightly less awful than a guy like Trump maybe?    
    
* If liberals can't see how they created this shit by making people afraid to speak their mind out of fear, then Trump will get 2 terms.    
    
* Everyone is sick of having to tiptoe around some shitbag blogger shame mob. Trump stuck his thumb in your eyes and won. Get it?    
    
* In all your pathetic wailing is there gonna be ANY acknowledgement that u fucked up with your shitty fascist tactics?    
    
* Every idiot who destroyed some other idiot's Trump sign helped LEGITIMIZE Trump.    
    
* Start fucking treating people who don't agree with u like human beings instead of arguing from authority like u do now, progressives.    
    
* Instead of ""I don't have time to educate u."" Fucking educate people. U didn't live up to your own supposed ideals and now youre mad? Fuck u    
    
* Did u think your silly idea that ""only white people can be racist"" was true just bc u chanted it like an incantation?    
    
* U really thought u were just gonna win bc youre ""the good ones?"" Shit u should find Jesus it youre gonna be dogmatic and have faith and shit    
    
* Yes I know u thought just bc u label someone ""racist"" or ""misogynist"" that makes it fact in your world. But your world is kinda small.    
    
* In the real world u haven't been living in bc u are dicking around online, speech crimes aren't a thing. Actions are what matter.    
    
* I can't believe I was so against Trump when clearly the greater good was for liberals to pull their heads out of their asses for 5 min.    
    
* Good lucking trying to get people fired now, sjw's. U just got voted out of power. I'm really enjoying your meltdown.    
    
* No Hilary didn't lose bc people hate women. Hilary lost because she's a dishonest unlikeable woman being sold as feminist jesus. Take it    
    
* Really Hilary was a perfect candidate for u. Disingenuous and entitled and packaged and sold as some sort of ""marginalized voice.""    
    
* Where the fuck does an sjw find the balls to call Trump ""petty"" or ""vindictive."" That's u guys. U are those things.    
    
* Fucking whining on a blog about made up shit like ""cultural appropriation"" and u call Trump ""petty and vindictive?"" Trump is u, sweetheart.    
    
* And btw these so called feminists will tear apart any woman who doesn't fully accept the party line. U aren't feminists, you're mean girls.    
    
* Then I gotta sit there and watch these fucking liars libel me right and left and I'm a fucking liberal even.    
    
* Yeah the more I think about it, liberals needed their shitty bubble popped. U had a chance w Bernie but u were weak and stupid. U are Trump    
    
* Is your delusion so deep u really thought not being as bad as the supposed badguy is the same as being noble and good?    
    
* I didn't want Trump to win either but u people are acting like Jesus Christ got re-crucified.    
    
* Fuck your bullshit phony deluded emotions. Suck it up. Trump is as bad as u feared, yet your side lost to him. That means YOU suck.    
    
* Next time your side is in power try not sickening people with your unyielding hypocrisy for five seconds.    
    
* Bernie could have won Bernie could have won. U were wrong about Trump why are u arguing even? U fucked up.    
    
* And that's where your little religion of liberal emotion and nate silver algorithms does u the biggest disservice.

&gt;Mateen’s father, Seddique Mateen, insisted in interviews Sunday that his son’s violent deeds had **nothing to do with religion**. He said Mateen had become enraged **a few months earlier** at the sight of a pair of gay men being affectionate with one another.

Not only was it revealed that it was about religion, but that he was radicalized years ago:

&gt;Ronald Hopper, an FBI official in Orlando, said **investigators first became aware of Mr. Mateen in 2013** ""when he made inflammatory remarks to co-workers alleging possible terrorist ties.""

&gt;Mr. Hopper said the FBI ""thoroughly investigated the matter, including interviews of witnesses, physical surveillance, and records checks.” Agents also interviewed him twice, but ""ultimately, we were unable to verify the substance of his comments and the investigation was closed,’’ he said.

&gt;Mr. Mateen came **under scrutiny again the following year**, out of concerns for possible contacts with Moner Mohammad Abusalha, a Florida man who traveled to Syria and carried out a suicide car bombing attack that year.

For years he was going to kill enemies of Islam, and this time it happened to be LGBT. Yet people are spinning this as some homophobe who saw 2 guys kissing in public, and then decided to kill 50 people. They are then linking him to Republicans because of LGBT laws.

&gt;Saiful Islam, 26, is one of the asylum seekers. Over a year ago, he booked a one-way ticket from Bangladesh to Bolivia. From Bolivia, he says he embarked on an arduous, four-month journey on foot through a dozen or so countries until finally crossing the Mexican border into the U.S

&gt;Like many of his fellow asylum seekers, Islam is a member of the Bangladesh National Party, the country’s second largest political party. The U.S. government has designated it as a Tier III terrorist organization, which some advocates and immigration lawyers have strongly contested. 

ISIS and other Islamist terrorist groups are active in Bangladesh. What's stopping one of them from making the same journey?
