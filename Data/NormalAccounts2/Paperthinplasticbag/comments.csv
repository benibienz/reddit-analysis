3,"To me it means he wasn't serious about getting Suarez. He was more concerned with sticking it to Liverpool saying, ""haha, you have leaks and I got one over on you by finding out your private information"".

19,"I'm doing several projects with this type of stuff and I've gone with the grove system. I didn't know about modulo when I picked though. I can see perhaps going with modulo in the future for certain types of projects were being fully self contained is an advantage. I did feel like I had to do a lot of digging to understand what it was and how it worked. Probably should have some explanation, maybe a diagram or cartoon up higher. Also move the catalog up higher, seeing that helped me understand a little. Still confused by the spark, proton and electron. Depending on a YouTube video to explain everything over just simple text and diagrams on the main page is probably a problem. I maybe can watch a video 10% of the time while web browsing.
