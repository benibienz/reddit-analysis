I wonder if the thin strips of [foam](http://www.automobiletrim.com/images/spares/foam.jpg) would provide any ease.    
You can try to cut 3-4cm long strips of foam(even kitchen sponge just for test purposes), make them thick as much as you want and place them in the cheekbone areas under the cover.

something like [that](http://i.imgur.com/oqAsgYb.jpg)
