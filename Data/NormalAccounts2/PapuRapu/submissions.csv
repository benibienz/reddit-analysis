[WIDMOvr](https://widmovr.com/) here,    
We've been fiddling with our design a little for the last week.

Some people didn't like the stitches on the forehead area so we got rid of them.    
We've also cut a little from the nose area to allow the air flow.    
The fit is perfect and we don't think that there's more room to improve.

We're called [WIDMOvr](http://widmovr.com) (pronunciation: veedmo, or whatever you want)    
After many weeks of designing and testing we're ready to present you what we've got for you.

We've prepared two versions of our covers: Classic &amp; Double Protection^(temporary name - suggestions are welcome)

[video of the double protection ver.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSFiHMbla4U&amp;feature=youtu.be)

**Both versions are:**

* made of high-quality natural materials

* perfectly fitted (and they stay on!)

* not triggering the proximity sensor

* not moving or bothering in any way (even the nose part)

* at the same price

The only difference is in the forehead area:

* **Classic** - there is one strap holding the top of the cover and a subtle stiffening of the forehead area    

* **Double Protection** - there are two elastic straps holding the top of the cover:    
one is the same as in the classic version, and an additional one to give 100% support and make sure the forehead will not slip off

The choice depends on user's preference.

- In the Classic version the forehead area is subtly stiffened and works very well, but might move a little after some use (especially if your straps on the Rift are very tight).

- In the Double Protection version you can be sure the forehead area will stay in place, but the second strap goes over the foam on the faceplate. We're using the lowest amount of pressure needed, but some people might not like this invasive solution.

**PRICE:**

First batch is going to be - as promised - for $20 a piece (plus shipping). 
We can't maintain that price in the future, since handmade production costs are bigger than we've anticipated.
We do, however, stay by our earlier promise, and we're shipping the first batch at cost. 
Price of the next batches will be $25 (plus shipping). 

**QUALITY:**

We're not outsourcing manufacturing.   
We're doing everything ourselves.   
Every cover goes through quality check.

**EDIT:** It's a bit confusing, so let me clarify. The DP version stays on better, but the elastic strap is putting a bit of pressure on the foam, so we don't know if they won't leave an indentation after a long time. We've been using the DP version for a couple of weeks and can't see any damage (and, personally, I wouldn't mind a bit of an indentation on the foam), but we just want to be straight with you, tell you what we've considered, and give you the choice.",oculus,"WIDMOvr - New Rift Covers, which one do you prefer?",https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/4zjbck/widmovr_new_rift_covers_which_one_do_you_prefer/
