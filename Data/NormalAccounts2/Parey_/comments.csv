100% agreed. Playing supports if you are new is a very good way of staying under 2k forever and not improving.

35,"AM’s skill build has a bit of flexibility, but not much. You have 2 questions to ask yourself before level 6 :

- Does the enemy lane have any magical damage ?

- Does the enemy lane rely on mana a lot ?

You have 3 possible skill builds before level 6 : 1-1-1 with 2 points in stats (standard), 1-1-0 with 3 points in stats (against stuff like Undying, it helps you survive in the early game where +2 str goes a long way), and 2-1-0  with 2 points in stats (if you are facing enemies who rely on mana a lot but don’t have much of it, like Earthshaker or Omni).

If you had not taken a point in spell shield before 6, take it at level 7, unless the whole enemy team is purely physical and pure damage (but then why did you pick AM ?). Then max blink. You want blink maxed at level 10 because there is a huge XP gap between level 11 and level 12 and most of the time you will have BF by the time you will be level 11. Losing efficiency by not having blink maxed out is way worse than being slightly less survivable at this point.

Afterwards, I generally max mana break straight away. You want maxed mana break when you have manta, and you want maxed spell shield somewhere between level 16 and level 25. If I want to split push a lot and I have the opportunity to avoid fights I take another point of stats before level 16 then max out Spell Shield.

If you don't, doppelgänger has a 10s cd at max level and phantom strike is 5 so you can't even escape. PA falls off as the game goes on normally, because she has blur. However, PL falls off even harder in general and in particular against PA because he is probably the worst carry hero in the game to have MKB on instead of another item.

Shaker vs pl is pl favoured. I used to pick pl into shaker all the time when pl was a hero. Shaker is very very easy to predict and he has no way of preventing pl from getting ahead early on and that's what pl truly needs. He is weak in lane, doesn't do anything before blink, and after blink he has the equivalent of a sleight of fist that's cancelable and on a 145 s cooldown.

Different heroes have different reasons to build Mek, but generally it’s because they can afford the mana cost and the gold cost and fight very well with it.

The heroes I consider to be the archetypical mek carriers are DS and Enigma. Dark Seer can farm really well with Talon+Ion Shell, and his teamfight presence is already massive. He is also naturally tanky and he has a good int gain. Enigma has a very good int gain, and an uncontested Enigma can get Soul Ring + Mek at about 7:30 (Dire) or about 8:30 (Radiant) just by jungling.

There is no point buying a QB if you have either very low or very high damage, because if you have like 40 damage you can always get last hits if you prep ranged creeps once and melee creeps once (not sure anymore but I’m pretty sure it’s the benchmark) and if you have above 80 you can always get last hits by not prepping ranged creeps and prepping melee creeps twice (again not sure).

There is a damage range around 60-80 (can’t remember the exact numbers) where last hitting under tower is wonky, and it’s especially worrisome if you play something like Lifestealer or Morphling.

As long as you have Dust you can get him easily, because let’s say if he is level 10 his Blast is weak and he has little mana to use his spells but by that time you are like level 9 so you have strafe level 2 (with my build), and SA level 4. You just need to take Dust. And the beautiful thing about having items like Dlance and Diffu is that you don’t even need to get kills to win, you can kill towers really easily.

148,"I play both heroes a little bit.

Chen isn't very hard to play. People focus on micro a lot with him, but the most important thing is to have a plan on this hero. When you start the game, you should ask yourself when and where you should rotate, if you should focus on farming to get a 10-12 min mek... These questions are very important because Chen is a monster in the first 10 minutes of the game. If you don't have a tower + at least 1 rotation under your belt at level 7, I would say you are doing it wrong. If you look at any game where artstyle picks Chen, you can see that he plays on the enemy safe lane a lot and he plays as a bully for the first 10 minutes.

For clinkz, this hero isn't a very good teamfighter unless you have deso. Basically, the hero follows the same game plan as other carries in the first 10 minutes, except that you can take a tower very early on because of seating arrows if the enemy offlane leaves. By the way, when you use seating arrows manually on towers, you don't trigger creep agro, so you can use that to do even more damage. Clinkz can get the enemy offlane t1 even before level 6 if the enemy offlaner leaves early. Once you have treads-drops-medallion-deso, play like a slark with more pushing power. Farm as aggressively as you can without dying, stay out of vision, and get towers or pickoffs when you can. Don't be that guy that stays in his jungle forever because he needs farm, your team most likely can't take as much aggressive farm as you. But it's extremely important to **hit towers whenever you can**. Clinkz with deso melts towers, he can have as much tower damage as heroes like terrorblade. For your next items after deso, i usually get either dragon lance (you outrange towers with it, very cost efficient and pike is good against heroes like Riki), diffusal blade (useful against these pesky ghost scepters, and really good on clinkz because clinkz loves both more mana and more stats, and the mana burn is huge when you use strafe), manta (to purge dust), monkey king bar (against evasion mostly, and you normally need it later) and finally BKB.",2016-11-03 07:06:30+00:00,d9jo9r4,1.0,t3_5asxae,32216.0,learndota2

168,"The basic idea behind the safe lane is that you want to get more out of your lane than the enemy offlane, but you also want more than the enemy safe lane. If you have a 2v2 lane, it’s very volatile though. 

If you have a strong dual lane like Ogre-Jugg against a rather weak dual lane you can apply the same principles as against a solo offlaner : zone them both out of XP range. Pull whenever you can pull (look at the BSJ video in this thread, it’s extremely helpful).

If the matchup is even, try to trade regen effectively. Look at their items at the start of the game, if they lack regen punish them for it. If you have a melee carry, try to get items like PMS, Quelling Blade (to out last hit), Ring of Health, early upgraded boots to dominate the lane. On your support, early Raindrops or Wind Lace can do wonders.

If the matchup is bad for you, you need to ask yourself a few questions :

- Can I survive without a support ?

- Can I get farm ?

- Can my support do shit elsewhere ? In particular, can he jungle early on ? (useful if your GF likes CM, although from my experience girls who play CM hate jungling for some reason &gt;&lt;)

- Can I switch lanes ?

From there, assess the matchup. If you have no way of doing anything, let’s say you are against le balanced frost creep eater + bristle as a melee carry, you need to resort to pulling aggro. Don’t die. Ever. It’s better to ferry 3 salves to yourself than dying, 100%. Take last hits and XP when you can. If your support can do shit elsewhere, tell him to.

Lastly, as a carry, a very useful sentance to keep in mind is : « The definition of insanity is doing something over and over again and expecting different results. » If your lane can not work, ever, ask for a lane switch or jungle and let your support sap XP. It’s better than nothing. But you need to realize it early on, before you fed a killing spree to the offlaner.

179,"Visage spammer here.

In competitive, he is dogshit. He is at the very least worse than 105 heroes. And arguably the worst hero in the game at the moment.

The big issue with visage is that he needs to get ahead, but he isn't very good in lane and his ideal laning configuration (in a dual offlane as the farmer) isn't played in pro games, for many reasons. He is a worse beast if you play him as an offlane hero, a worse Chen as a support, and a worse invoker if you play him mid.

Since his familiars got buffed a lot in 6.84a (they had HP before, now they require auto attacks to get killed), and he was op during the early days of 6.84, he received nothing but nerfs until 6.88. Among many others :

- familiars are affected by bkb piercing stuns, I'm really mad about this change because I had practised cancelling SB charges with birds and it's no longer possible to do it. It also made a lot of bad matchups worse (vs treant, pa, Ursa, or anything with basher really).

- iron talon is an indirect nerf to him, he can't talon jungle quickly

- glimmer cape is another indirect nerf to him for obvious reasons

- raindrops make his life harder

- echo sabre is good against familiars, dragon lance and pike destroy visage

In pubs though, he is really fun to play and he is a good hero if you want to support yourself out of the trench. He has everything you need in low level matches : burst, push, and late game potential. He can also farm well and rat.

Pick him in your pubs if you want, and if the enemy team doesn't have summons and other stuff that visage hates. He is good against Mirana and pudge, who are both popular in pubs.

His high armor lets him not give a fuck about Acid and he can completely zone him with Meta at level 1 when Alch doesn’t have any active yet. I had no rotation and I had a SK, which means I could not do jungle rotations as much as I wanted. So it should be a pretty decent benchmark for a not very high MMR player.

218,"At low levels, don’t care about roles. People don’t understand how the game works, they don’t even know how to play their hero. But at higher levels, here is a quick recap :

- Each game has 3 cores and 2 supports. Each core is associated with a lane. The lanes are nicknamed safe lane (top for dire, bot for radiant), mid, and offlane (bot for dire, top for radiant). Safe lanes are located closer to your jungle, meaning you can control the creep equilibrium by pulling.

- One (or 2 even) of the supports can be using the jungle in the early game. Some supports are called « junglers » because they can farm the jungle at level 1 and be fast. With the addition of Iron Talon, cores can take the jungle even very early on if no support is comitted to it.

- At low levels, the most common laning setup by far is 2-1-2, which means 2 top, 1 mid, one bot.

- In pro games, there are many different lane setups and people move around much more in the early game. Trilanes are the norm though, with the most common setups being 3-1-1 or 1-1-3. Usually a trilane gets dismantled around minute 5-8, depending on the lineup.

- In low level games, there is a dedicated jungler reasonably often, which makes the lane setup 2-1-1-1. In pro games, junglers happen less often and more often than not it’s one of the cores who comes to the jungle, making the setup 0-1-1-3. It’s flexible though, just because you have an assigned lane doesn’t mean you should stick to it.",2016-10-21 16:28:57+00:00,d91xfwp,1.0,t3_58o0e5,1402.0,learndota2

If you want to face a luna, she is actually not very hard to beat, but you need to either dodge fights completely, have a lot of summons and pushing power + teamfight, or gank her repeatedly. Don't forget to ward the ancients. In lane, do a bullshit dual lane like lich + axe or something and run over her. When you see that she has a helm of dominator, ward her jungle and pick her off.

- **Survive PA’s peak**, between 20 and 30 mins. PA falls off almost as hard as PL later on because Blur is quite useless late.

- **Don’t die at any point**. If you have such a rough matchup a single death can spell the end for you.

278,"Former PL spammer here.

The big thing that PL has and that makes him a hero is his mobility. He can’t manfight. He can’t scale well. However, he is good at taking supports out of a fight, in the mid game. What’s nice about the hero is that he doesn’t particularly give a shit about Force Staves, or Ghost Scepters. So until late game where everyone has a Hex to wreck him he is very good.

His main weaknesses are :

- Mobility

- Ways to ignore his illusions or manfight him directly

- Silences

- Hexes and stuns (PL is very squishy and very reliant on being mobile, like Slark).

As a PL player, the heroes I fear the most are, in this order :

- **Phantom Assassin** : PL hates MKB, he doesn’t carry silver edge particularly well, PA has blink strike which has half the cooldown of doppel, PL can not manfight PA ever, and PA is stronger than PL even at his peak. If I play carry and I see a PL in the enemy team, PA is my first thought.

- **Elder Titan** : Natural Order is a decent skill.

- **Axe** : Good luck getting past the laning phase and getting a lead against this hero.

- **Riki** : Smoke Screen is the spell made to destroy PL. Silence and Slow in an AoE, coupled with Miss Chance. PL loves building Manta, but he doesn’t like building MKB or BKB. Not to mention Riki can ult to find the real PL now. Really painful to face.

- **Anti-Mage** : the better PL. Farms faster, scales better, has better mobility, rats better. PL can not fight an AM at any point and AM can, AM can also chase a PL easily and PL needs mana to work well.

And some soft counters/combos :

- Sven + lots of lockdown + Echo Sabre : I played against Sven+Lion once. Sven would ult, Lion would blink hex me, then Sven would blink on me and 4 shot me with ult. Never again. ._. But in general Sven is good vs PL because PL can not manfight a Sven at any point in the game. Not as scary as a PA though because he is kiteable.

- Skywrath Mage + AoE lockdown : Pretty self explanatory.

- A good Silencer : again, pretty self explanatory.

- Sand King : Very good in lane because of Caustic, later on very annoying because Burrow Epi hurts like hell. If he kills an illusion with it he also does extra damage, but even without it he is annoying.

A common mistake is to pick Earthshaker against PL. Don’t do this. If PL has half a brain he is going to make you regret it. You can’t do anything to a PL pre blink, and post blink he is going to dance around you while you pray for a good echo slam. You have very low mana on Shaker as well. PL is very good at taking a lead and Shaker can’t do anything to a PL in the early game.

Basically, if you play against PL as a support, pick Elder Titan. Or a greedy support that pushes well like Enigma or Chen. Or Riki, which destroys him at level 7.

279,"I played the PL vs Earthshaker matchup quite a lot and for me it’s PL favored. Earthshaker is really bad at taking a lead while PL is really good at it, and Earthshaker is extremely easy to predict. He has an Agh’s Burrow on a 145s cooldown, but by the time he gets Blink he often lost the game already if the PL has a brain.

The main issue is that PL is a trash hero in general. If you like PL, play Slark, AM or Terrorblade. Don’t bother picking this shit hero.

And I really hate saying that because PL is my favorite hero alongside Visage. :'(

Farming on Naga is actually simpler than you could think. The keyword is **jungle rotations**. As soon as you get to level 4 or 5 (not sure anymore, I have not played Naga in a while), you have level 2 or 3 illusions. From this point on, you need to abuse bottle crowing and cast mirror image on every cooldown if you can. Keep one illusion with your hero to farm the jungle with you, and use the others to last hit in mid. When you are hitting a jungle camp with the main hero and the wave with illusions, you can use Rip Tide. Try to farm at least 1 camp + 2 waves every minute, possibly 2 camps. Bottle crow to your heart’s content if you can, normally your team should not use the courier too much if you are mid. If they use your courier while you are bottle crowing, gently tell them to fuck off.

338,"If you have issues with Pudge, it reflects that you lack game sense and map awareness. You need to practice last hitting and watching the minimap. Even if you are playing as a core, you can buy your own ward and place it either on rune spots (Pudge gets bottle often in pubs, I don’t know if it’s good or not), or beside lanes to see him approach. At low levels, Pudge players don’t think about buying smokes so wards will do wonders.

Especially against Pudge, you need to check your minimap every few seconds. Did you see him mid, moving towards a lane, and then 5s later and 10s later he is not mid ? Ping the shit out of the lane he is going to and if it’s your lane play safe, if it’s not tell your team that he is coming for them.

Another problem that you have is efficiency. I noticed that on your last 2 PA games (respectively : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/2688957376 and http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/2682564771) you had 280 last hits in 49 minutes with a Battlefury and 190 last hits at 46 minutes, respectively. You also died 6 and 9 times which is not really acceptable. As a carry, you need to die less than 5 times reliably almost every game, unless it’s a stomp for the enemy team. You also need to farm more efficiently.

I don’t know if I’m the best reference, but here is a PA game I played a few days ago for comparison :

356,"I used to play Omni quite a bit at some point (I think I have like 40 games of him or something, he is in my most played heroes).

Basically, people will say « hurr durr buy diffu » but it’s only 10% of the answer.

You know what Omni’s real weakness is ? You know why he is never picked in pro games ? **It’s because of his atrocious laning**. He can’t lane anywhere. He is extremely weak without levels, just like Visage, but unlike Visage he can’t even zone because he is melee and he doesn’t scale well.

When you see Omni in lane, **punch him at level 1**. Force him to heal himself. Purification is really bad for how much mana it costs at level 1, even if you don’t avoid the damage. If he went Repel first (which you almost never do, but still), it’s free harass. A very good hero to do it is Anti-Mage. I love having AM in lane against Omni because it takes 4 hits to remove more than half of his mana pool at the early levels.

If you are a support, **zone the fuck out of him right at level 1**. You don’t have to fear him, he either has a weak nuke which is melee range, repel which doesn’t protect against physical damage, or degen aura which means he has no spell.

I probably harped on this a lot, but again, **shut down Omni when he is weak, when he doesn’t have levels**. Omni needs a good start to be useful, he needs a crapload of levels, and he is great against incompetent players because of that. That’s why he has a 60%+ winrate in 2-3k bracket. But I can guarantee you that unless you massively fuck up afterwards, if the enemy Omni barely gets his level 6 at 13 minutes you basically won.

If you are supporting against Omni, get Force staff. Omni has issues with mobility. That’s also why AM is really good against him. If you play cores, itemize normally but give diffusal blade or eul’s higher priority. Otherwise, when you see him ult, shout « GET BACK » over your mic if you don’t have any purge, or if you are behind. If you are ahead Omni doesn’t do much. Once again, you get ahead by shutting him down early.

A few heroes have summons that they can recall already, namely Chen and lone druid. However, they are balanced around this :

- Chen got nerfed a lot on his ultimate after the test of faith recall was added. Coincidentally, Chen's biggest issue was mobility as well. Chen isn't the best late game hero (decent with ancients, but lacklustre if not ahead). He also doesn't do much without his ultimate or aghs in fights.

- lone druid has 3 ways of making his recall not OP and limited in use. First, he obviously has a leash on his bear pre aghs. Second, his bear can not be recalled of either of them takes damage. And lastly, lone druid gets weaker and weaker as the game goes. Visage doesn't, because he is extremely tanky with cloak and he can deal tons of burst damage.

I agree with you that visage is in a very bad spot at the moment, but giving him a recall would be conceptually extremely good, so much that he would even have to be nerfed on his 2 best skills (familiars and SA). I'm not sure I want this kind of buff.

378,"MMR = Match Making Rating.

TL;DR : it’s a number and it shows how good you are at winnig solo or party games against random opponents in dota.

MMR is based on the Elo rating system, invented by a guy called Arpad Elo. The idea behind it is that if you have the same MMR as someone else, you will have a 50% chance of winning against him. If he has higher MMR, he has a higher chance of winning, and the opposite applies. It was originally used in chess and it’s known for being fair and accurate. 

There is a lot of [theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system#Theory) behind this. But the most important thing you need to know is this formula :

Supposing Player A was expected to score E_A points but actually scored S_A points. The formula for updating his rating is

    R_A′ = R_A + K ( S_A − E_A ) .

The K factor tells how volatile MMR is. If K is very low, that means you will need a lot of games to adjust. If K is too high however, it will be too volatile. In dota, K = 25. This value is not taken randomly : Elo himself suggested a value of K between 16 and 32 (32 for lower rated players and 16 for grandmasters).

In Dota, there is a match making algorithm that tries to make teams as even as possible. It does so by making average MMRs as even as it can. So if you are under 4kish MMR and the population is high, you can replace the previous formula with this one :

R_A’ = R_A + K*S_A.

If the opposing teams have equal average MMR, that means they have exactly 50% chance of winning, and therefore they will win on average 0 points, hence the simplification. This formula obviously doesn’t apply to uneven teams, you have to use the previous one and find the expected score using a bit of calculation.

In dota, S_A can either be at 1 (if you win, your ranking goes up) or at -1 (if you lose). That means that after your game, you will either get +25 or -25 MMR.

Now this is the basis. Basically, if you are 3k in a game where everyone else is at 2k, you have a very high chance of winning. As you can probably imagine, there are some issues with this system, especially since dota is a team game. Among other things, you have rating inflation or deflation.

As a #1 NS, Agh’s is very cost ineffective because you don’t need to provide vision, you need to bring down heroes.

385,"The main issue with PL is not Sven. It’s that the hero is just worthless. Sven + echo sabre + good lockdown is a big issue for a PL (I faced a Sven+Lion as PL in the past… I kept on getting picked off by Blink-Hex on Lion and Ult-Blink-Sabre hits on Sven, never again), but other than that Sven is not the worst hero to face as PL. PA is way worse.

But back to your point.

Looking at their lineup, the enemy team has a very weak laning phase. They have 2 roamers for their supports, but at the same time they kind of need babysitters. Your team’s babysitting support (Lion) is slightly weak in lane, but you still have a laning edge.

So I would tend to pick carries that benefit from an advantageous laning phase and can kind of come online early.

Their team is very farm heavy in the early game. Either Sven or AM will get gimped automatically. They can’t fight before the 25 minute mark IMHO (when AM gets Treads-BF-Vlads-Manta). If it’s a jungle Sven, you can win before the 10 minute mark.

So I would pick a carry that peaks rather early and is able to fight quite a lot to secure a lead. Ideally someone who is good at pushing because you don’t have much potential to kill towers. You don’t have an Enigma, you don’t have a Beastmaster.

So right away, my thoughts would be **Slark, PA, Terrorblade, or Alchemist**.

Now, looking at your lineups, I would first and foremost discard Slark altogether because there are 3 very good heroes against Slark in the enemy team. There is AM, Storm and Sven to a lesser extent. 

Terrorblade is very interesting because there is AM in the other team so you will have strong illusions. Other than that Reflection is not amazing. However, Terrorblade is extremely good at pushing and Tinker + Terrorblade’s damage destroys even Sven in the early game. You already have Blink Dismember for the enemy Storm, on top of Lion’s stun and hex. 

Alchemist would be a good pick here, but the issue he has is his awful armor even with Armlet. So he would be vulnerable to Sven. It would be a slight gamble to pick him. That being said, Sven should really have a bad time in this game.

PA looks like the ideal choice for me here. PA is notoriously good at taking over games, she is very good at pushing after she gets Deso-Vlad’s and she is always very strong against AM and Sven. None of their heroes carry MKB well and they don’t want to go for Silver Edge either. Storm in particular is extremely weak to evasion because he needs to land attacks to proc Overcharge.

So I would pick PA ideally. If you are not confident in your PA, Terrorblade would be also a really good option.

Keep in mind that it’s just my opinion though.

His ultimate is actually amazing. The real issue visage has, IMHO, is that he can't lane anywhere anymore. He scales really well when he is ahead, but in terms of laning when you compare him to a SD, oracle, or disruptor he is a joke. He also can't go to the offlane because he can't talon jungle, and he can go mid but he has very bad early stats so he can get out last hit by a QW invo. For me, that's his main issue.

508,"Let’s do this.

-1:05 : I like these starting items. You can’t expect supports to give you a tango when your best support is Bloodseeker so going for a safe build was nice. You recognised that you were probably against Invoker too, hence the PMS.

0:35 : What you are doing here would be perfect if the Invoker was full HP. However, I think you should have daggered, then run up to him, then attack him. He is still level 1 and you have PMS, he can not win any trade against you. You can wear him down easily. You just daggered him which is fine but you could do a lot more.

1:00 - 1:20 : You are baiting him with denies but you should stand in a more agressive position if you want to do it. The idea behind is still good.

1:41 : You missed last hits and because of that you don’t have bottle yet. I think the ideal decision would be to stack the medium camp for your Axe, because he has not cleared that. But you could not know in game so I give it back.

1:50-2:10 : Why are you not pulling aggro anymore ? It’s the same situation as before and you can bait invo into a bad trade.

2:14 : Personally I would not have dragged the creep wave into tower range, I would just have tanked it while running around a bit to avoid missing last hits because of the tower.

2:27 : Your camera is very badly placed. You can see the Invoker but you don’t watch him because your camera focuses on useless things. You also missed a last hit because of the tower. I’m literally Oracle Kappa

3:12 : You just lost like 5 creeps for literally no reason. You missed the dagger on the invoker but it’s not an excuse to play like that.

3:51 : This invoker feels outlaned so hard he wants to check the rune. Deny every creep you can during that time.

4:10 : You didn’t deny so you didn’t punish Invoker for being a dumbass. You also have to check bottom rune when you could just have ferried boots and bottle crowed.

4:26 : You are late and you don’t even get the rune. Who would have expected that, right ? Again, don’t check runes if you are going to be late. You missed last hits again so you are behind your PL by a large margin and not as far ahead as you should be vs this invoker.

5:00 : What the hell are you doing ? Running away then daggering him ? What’s the thought process ?

5:40 : Invoker gained his natural advantage back because you didn’t trade hits with him, instead you chose to play very passively. Stop daggering him, he has Quas at level 3.

5:50 : Why are you even going for the bottom rune ? Top rune is closer.

6:47 : nice kill on the Invoker, you are advantaged again.

7:30 : Just ferry your phase boots and your TP, you are mid ffs

8:08 : You just wasted mana by daggering a creep instead of last hitting him normally when there were no heroes around. Why does it take you so long to ferry blight stone, your blades of attack, and a TP ?

8:13 : You didn’t take a TP which is unacceptable. Also, you needed a blight stone, again. It builds into your eventual deso.

8:44 : You really waited for the worst moment to engage. I don’t understand why you didn’t engage on LC when you had vision of her doing your ancients, it was literally the easiest kill of your life.

10:15 : Good kill, but you are still quite far behind because of these rotations, you inefficiency and that death.

11:53 : Oh god, why battlefury… What’s the point of getting a battlefury here ? You know that you have a PL, which gets destroyed by LC (Duel is a strong spell and PL hates manfights) and by Ember (Ember is more mobile and does a lot more damage than PL). Why do you want a farming item on a hero who relies on mid game dominance so much ? I know slahser goes for BF-Deso, but slahser knows how to farm and gets a 15 min BF every game. You are really far from BF.

12:00 : You just died again and now you are super far behind. The game is out of control.

13:58 : You didn’t respect the chains -&gt; sunstrike combo and paid for it. You are definitely on tilt at this point.

I stopped watching here. Your early game was imprecise all around. You didn’t abuse Invoker’s level 1 and you didn’t hold on to your advantage in lane. Your draft was pretty bad all things considered, but you going for a BF didn’t help it in any way after this early game.",2016-09-23 19:39:50+00:00,d7za3vz,2.0,t1_d7yqayd,27806.0,learndota2

519,"I would argue that in order to be a good support, you need to be a good core as well. So don’t be afraid to take core positions once in a while, at least safe lane and offlane. As always that’s debatable but I learned a lot more while spamming Luna, Gyro and PL than by spamming Lion and Dazzle.

For your second question, it comes down to what you are best at in dota. MMR takes into account many factors. For example, the russian that queues with you in a specific game will be probably better mechanically than you because his communication didn’t help him to raise his MMR. Some players are very proeficient on few heroes but suck at a lot of others. Some players claim that they only can play support (usually, it’s just an excuse they make up because they suck at last hitting and farming efficiency).

If your best bet in ranked is to play support, because you are able to consistently secure your team an early lead, you read the map well, you don’t die even with few items, and you can coordinate your team, play support every game. If your ability comes from your consistency on a few heroes, play these heroes a lot, even first pick them. If you are very good at farming, play either supports or heroes that reward efficient farming like Luna, Sven or Terrorblade.

There is also another factor that you didn’t talk about, and it’s the learning vs grinding aspect. If you play your best hero, you will play him above your MMR. You will not improve your knowledge on the hero, most likely, but you will improve on other things. On the other hand, if you play a hero that you are not familiar with but is very good against the enemy team (eg Disruptor against Timbersaw…) you will learn how to play this hero, so to speak. You will gain less deep but broader knowledge.

548,"- Watch your positioning. Be proactive. Omni is a proactive hero, you need to think ahead of time. You need to repel your PA or your AM *before* the fights start and then make sure that PA hunts the Naga down. Naga is very good against Omni, but the naga player was either an absolute dumbass who could not farm for shit or a support. If it was a support there was not much you could do. If it was a core naga played by someone stupid, you had a million of opportunities to take over the game.

- Pick off the Naga. I don’t know how this naga was playing but normally Naga plays up quite far into enemy territory. Place lane wards where Naga spawns illusions and pick her off when she is on your side of the map. **Your AM needs to contribute to this by playing agressively as well**. He had very good timings on his items so there was literally no reason for him not to be on the enemy side of the map constantly, stealing their jungle, stealing their ancients, and cutting waves. This would allow you to ward wherever you want and take map control.

- Shit on their Invoker early on. This is pretty straightforward, your Ebola can roll on him and then you heal bomb.

- Speaking of your early game, their Timbersaw looks like he had the worst game of his life. You could at the very least take a lot of towers early because they literally had no way to fight into a PA with deso+vlads/vanguard and an AM with good farm in the early game. The game was over at 20 minutes, by the looks of it. You just let it get past the hour mark for some weird reason and then the enemy team came back and won.

But that happens with Omni. I played Omni a lot and stopped because I found out that he really was not impactful if your team was not willing to group early on in the game. He is very good with early push strats because he basically offers a free BKB in the early game, and because GA is very threatening. But outside of that, he just doesn’t do anything. He needs farm but he is weak in lane, like Visage, but unlike Visage he actually can not push by himself and scale well into the late game unless he has a lot of farm and the enemies don’t.",2016-09-21 20:42:27+00:00,d7wjmot,7.0,t1_d7wisqg,989.0,DotA2

570,"So first of all, you are assuming a late game scenario which is already disadvantageous for the AM. AM starts falling off at about 40 minutes in because at that time he is 6-slotted and other heroes are not, so the goal of any AM is to get a decisive lead by that time.

That being said, it depends on your team comp and theirs. AM is weak in 5-man engagements even with farm. His strengths are ratting and pickoffs with Manta-Abyssal and Mana Void. If your team has very little arguments against AM or is weak against AM (let’s say you have Timbersaw + Tinker + Ogre on the same team, you have 3 mana void bombs). Weaknesses are the fact that he is squishy and relies on his blink.

So how do you play against AM ?

&gt; if AM is looking to rat, should I chase him and look to fight ?

- Well, AM is a predictable hero, to some degree. If you play AM a lot, you will know how he farms. Generally, good AMs tend to be very agressive with their farming so try to place wards a bit close to your jungle camps where you want to ambush him. A very important aspect of playing against AM is vision. **Against AM counters, AM relies on vision** to know if they are here. If you want to kill an AM, you don’t want to chase him because he will always outrun you thanks to Blink. You need to be smarter about that, be one move ahead. Don’t react to an AM, that’s what he wants you to do. In general, the safest option is to push out every lane, then look for fights and push towers as a team, but it’s easier said than done because AM counterpushes very fast.

&gt; Will I be able to lockdown and kill AM with chrono alone ?

- This depends entirely on the game and what happened. If you have a lot of combos in a Chrono, let’s say you have Underlord, Invoker and Skywrath Mage in the same team, it’s very probable that you have enough damage to kill him in one Chrono. If you are 6-slotted as Void and you have at least another hard disable like Beastmaster, you probably also have enough damage.

&gt; What should be void's items in this situation ?

- AM always builds from the same 8 or 9 items. He builds Treads, BF, Vlad’s (but sells it later), Manta, Abyssal, Butterfly, and then BKB, MKB, Moon Shard, Eblade (as an alternative to Bfly if enemies have MKB), and Heart. Against Void, he probably will buy Heart instead of BKB unless you have magic damage in spades. In this situation, I would get the following items (provided that you are 6-slotted) :

**BoTs - BKB - Manta - Diffusal 2 or Eblade or Butterfly (pick 2, or 1 of these + refresher if you can combo with chrono) - MKB**

578,"&gt; The only thing I would say is that you had an empty slot. I'm assuming you sold your quelling blade or aquilla. Quelling blade is one of the best farming items for TB, even in the late game, because it gives you 40% bonus damage on creeps. Just a minor thing I noticed.

I sold both of them, but Aquila before QB because QB is amazing on Terroblade. I think I was flying out an item to me and sold my Treads in the enemy base or something at the end, otherwise I always had 6 slots.

&gt; I didn't like your skill build for this game. Again, I'll have to watch the replay to be sure, but if you were being pressured by Axe a lot, you should have maxed your Q instead of illusions. The Q will harass Axe and slow him down in case he tries to kill you. It's low cooldown at max level and cheap mana. Always go ring of aquila early game. The mana regen and armor is too good for the hero.

Yep, I do get Aquila in the early game, 100% of the time. For the illusions max, the reason why I did it was because I started farming the jungle at level 7 (enemy offlane tower down) and at that point I was 1-1-4-1 so I thought I should just up my farming speed instead of making stronger illusions for fights. I didn’t fight that much so I thought it was the right call.

&gt; I was thinking about doing a TB replay commentary actually, if that would be helpful. I could also potentially do a replay commentary of your game if that would be of interest. Lemme know! Hope this helped, sorry for the wall of text, got excited about TB :(

I would love it if you did it, even about my game. I don’t know if there is a lot to learn from in this game, again the enemy Enigma and AM were really trying hard to lose and Axe was diving in a 1v2 situation when he knew that I must have had Metamorphosis… But I would love it.

I’m going to start doing my peer review threads on thursday again, so try playing a support and submitting your replay if they work by that time. I’m sure many people will be willing to give you constructive criticism about your support play. Playing supports at low MMRs is absolutely viable if you want to grind MMR, especially active supports that can have a very big contribution at every stage of the game (Sky, Visage, WD…). 

Yes, at times you are going to get carries that want to assert their dominance by contesting your pulls, but I guarantee you if you are playing safe lane cores you will get supports that just sit behind you and leech which is even worse, or even contest your farm. The point of playing supports is to have more impact than the enemy supports because on average you will win more games if you do that, and to not die a lot but do shit.

635,"Think about the reason why you hold creep equilibrium.

If I ask you « Why do you hold the creep equilibrium in the early game in the safe lane ? » you would probably answer this :

- It forces the enemy offlaner to get out of position if he wants to get XP

- Your carry can be safe from ganks and from the enemy offlaner’s pressure

And so on and so forth. However, this situation holds true because of 2 things :

- Your carry is **in lane all the time** so he can maintain creep equilibrium (and he can’t farm the lane + jungle without losing HP + gold from inefficient last hitting)

- There is an enemy offlaner which you want to contest.

So from there, when don’t you care about creep equilibrium ?

First, it’s when the enemy offlaner leaves. Basically, when an offlaner leaves, you have a few plans :

- Single pull with a catapult to push the offlane T1 (can be very good if you have an early game pushing lineup with a Drow and an NP, for example, especially against teams without waveclear)

- Push the lane constantly and pull at :53 to stack the large camp and farm a few creeps in there

- Leave the lane to your supports and go farm the jungle with your carry (very good with level dependant supports like AA or Visage).

In 2 of these 3 situations, you want to push as much as you can, either because you want to take the tower down or because you don’t want to miss any CS during your jungle rotations. In case you want your support to have the lane, sometimes the support will need to hold the equilibrium (with heroes like AA) but sometimes your support can actually pressure the offlane tower (Visage…). So it depends on the hero again.

The second situation in which you don’t care about equilibrium is when your carry can start doing jungle rotations. Some heroes, like Terrorblade, Luna, Lycan, Sven, and AM with certain items, can farm the jungle and the lane very efficiently as soon as they get one item (HotD or Aquila, usually). In this case, what you want to do is usually push as hard as you can, then transition into the jungle and maximize your farm by moving around the map, pushing and farming. At that point, the mid game starts for the carry, and instead of having to keep lane equilibrium, his goal is to basically push as much as he can to create pressure around the map and get map control for his team while he gets gold.

So basically, you stop caring about the lane equilibrium when you could get more efficient with it (pulls at :53 each minute) *or* when your carry doesn’t need protection anymore.

The same principles apply for the mid lane but it goes faster for mid heroes. Heroes like Alch usually want to push out the lane starting at :25-30 each minute then stack their jungle. That’s also how you play SF mid.

I hope it helped !

If you want to learn how to carry, this would be my suggestion. She is very simple to itemize. Your early items are Treads, Aquila, Helm, maybe Wand. Get Treads in a very good lane, Aquila if you have a good lane and access to the courier, Helm if you have a hard lane (get Helm of Iron Will first). After that, the safest build in general is Yasha -&gt; BKB -&gt; Manta. While you are farming your Yasha, stack with your dominated creep. Then, once you get Yasha, clear your stacks. Once you get Manta you should be pretty far ahead of the enemy carry already, with a few towers down. Get stat items and try to end the game by 40ish minutes. In some situations you want DLance, and usually it’s when they have a lot of anti-BKB. In this case, you should consider items like Agh’s or Skadi (or early Satanic) to make you tankier but delay BKB.

693,"&gt; What I don't really understand is why top PL players tend to rush them first item.

Because no other pair of boots has as much potential as BoTs on PL.

PL doesn’t benefit as much from Treads as you could think. The bonus HP from str treads is very nice, but you could also get it with a Vanguard, and PL always builds Vanguard because the new Ablade is so good on him. BoTs on the other hand allow your hero to be PL instead of a garbage version of Terrorblade. BoTs allow PL to do what he does best : create confusion, outmanœuvre the enemy team and force favorable fights. The fact that BoTs have a lower cooldown than TP scrolls is ridiculously good for that.

It also helps with farming and split pushing while being active early and this hero needs to use the early game where he is strongest. Like, really badly. PL is great in the early game, then falls off, then starts being good again with Diffu, then falls off again until the late game where his only purpose is to hit buildings because he can not fight carries and he can not even kill supports because he doesn’t hit hard at all.

And an early pair of BoTs is also legit on Sven, but Sven needs the AS from Treads and PL doesn’t. So if you want, you can get 2 pairs of boots on Sven after building your early game items. It’s good against split pushers like NP.",2016-09-14 08:48:38+00:00,d7m6c3z,1.0,t3_52p8f9,8057.0,learndota2

Ogre is pretty good (beware creep aggro, he is melee !) because high armor, high regen, and surprisingly high damage/mana ratio on level 1 ignite.

Keeper of the Light is nice because you can force either the enemy offlaner to trade with you and lose mana in the process or stand while eating right clicks. That being said, in lane, he is not very good anymore after Timber gets level 3 because of le balanced radioactive armor.

Silencer is a classic, and 15 mana for a spell that does about 20 pure damage in the early game without triggering aggro and that has no cooldown is insane for zoning. His starting stats are also surprisingly high, except his str.

Oracle is also a pretty good zoner, but to reach his full potential he needs level 3 (flames level 2 + edict level 1 for a burst combo).

723,"It also relies on your carry knowing what creep equilibrium is, but basically the rule is **always keep him at level 1**. All the time. Lion is not the best zoner, but it still applies to him. Your carry should have an agressive stance while CSing to prevent Timber from even getting close to the wave. As a Lion, your job is to right click him every single time you can without drawing aggro. As always, you stand beside the lane, between the lane and the hard camp, and when he tries to show up, stun then right clicks.

Against a Timber offlane, the following things can help as well :

- If possible, try to have a carry who is very good in lane, against Timber. It’s not easy to predict where a Timber is going to be because more often than not you will predict that he goes mid (at least I do). But if you think you will face a Timber offlane, try heroes like Anti-Mage (very good against Timber with mana burn, and later on with Mana Void), Drow Ranger (agressive carry that lets your supports zone really hard), Luna (same idea as Drow), and even things like Slark safe lane. Slark is not good when he is contested, but in an advantageous lane he is ridiculously good, especially with something like Slark-Lion when you have a lot of kill potential in the early game.

- If your communication is decent between the carry and the supports (and it should be, it’s very important that these 2 roles understand what the other will do), you can pull with your other support to maintain a decent equilibrium while you zone him. Once again, keep him at level 1.

- Save a stun to interrupt Timber Chain if you have a hero like Lion. At level 1 he will most likely have either Chain or Armor in the offlane. If he goes Armor he has no escape, if he goes Chain he is squishy. Either way, beat him down with right clicks or spells whenever you can.

- If you are solo supporting, that means you have a jungling hero, so you will peak rather early. Abuse the time when Timber has no bloodstone to push and gank him again. By going offlane, Timbersaw willingly gimps himself and goes for a very greedy move, trying to still come online at a decent time but letting another hero farm mid. **Abuse that**. Make him understand that greed isn’t good.

But if you see a Timbersaw on the enemy team, don’t pick Lion. Pick Disruptor, Skywrath Mage, or even things like Enigma (very good against Timber Chain !), Visage (burst physical damage but magic finisher so he actually hurts Timber a lot), or Keeper of the Light for the « fuck you » potential with Mana Leak.

- His supports focused on zoning and pulling, or zoning and jungling if you had a Chen or Enigma on your team

- The mid player ganked the enemy offlane to extend the carry’s lead

- The offlaner kept the enemy supports busy but he had a way harder lane (remember those games where the offlane nyx was level 3 with 1 CS 10 minutes in ?)

Vlad’s lets you :

- Farm faster (18% bonus damage)

- Take towers slightly faster with Vlad’s aura (note that with VG you can tank tower shots which offsets this advantage a bit)

Vanguard allows to :

- Fight (the HP bonus + damage block actually gives you a load of EHP, unless you are against pure damage)

- Build into Ablade after Manta

- Bully an offlaner away in the early game.

Basically, on AM, you build Vanguard when you have a bad early game or when you want to fight, and in other cases you build a Vlad’s. In every case, you need to have one of these items, Treads and BF before Manta unless you have coordination.

751,"You are right, 288 last hits for a Sven on a 46 minute win is low. That being said, good job on your score and your tower damage.

In the early game, there are a few ways to increase your farm :

- If you are even in numbers and in matchup in lane, it’s okay to trade farm since you are a Sven. In this case, get every single creep that you can.

- If you are disadvantaged in lane, you can either leave to the jungle (viable on Sven because you can use QB + Warcry + Cleave to farm), or play like an offlaner and aggro creeps to last hit safely. If your supports are not zoning and playing terribly, go to the jungle to catch up, it’s better than being level 4 when the enemy offlaner is level 6.

- If you are advantaged in lane, the fun starts. Basically, you have to abuse pulling at :53 on each minute. At around :25-30 of each minute, you start pushing your lane (tank creeps if you need) until it reaches the enemy tower. If you did it right, you can get to the hard camp beside your lane and pull it. On Dire, you need a Quelling Blade for that, but since you are a Sven you always get a QB regardless. This pull achieves 2 things. First, it stacks the camp. Second, it denies the enemy offlaner experience because he gets 1 wave’s worth of XP and you get 2 on each minute. When you are level 7 and you have a 5-stack or something like that, you can pull, then use God’s Strength to clear the stack then push the offlane tower.

Note that you can use pulling to catch up as well, if you don’t have a Helm yet it’s an efficient way to farm a hard camp without losing HP as long as your cleave is leveled up.

In the mid to late game, your priority list goes as follows for farm :

- Lane farm (it creates pressure and map control for your team, it’s your first priority). Even if you can’t reach towers, melting creep waves with Cleave always benefits your team at this stage because it can force the enemy team to react and it can reveal 5-man movements (if 2 lanes are pushed out and no one is defending, they are most likely 5-manning).

- Ancient stacks. It’s pretty self-explanatory, you are a Sven so you clear stacks really fast. When you can, stack your ancients with your dominated creep.

- Enemy jungle farm. This kind of agressive farming is risky, but it has multiple benefits. First, it starves the enemy team. Second, it allows your team to farm your jungle and do it safely. Don’t do it if you would risk dying though.

- Farm in your jungle.

Note that I didn’t mention fighting. You have to adapt your farm to your team’s movements as well as your wards. If you have 2 wards in the enemy jungle, pushing their safe lane is a lot safer than pushing your safe lane for example. If your team wants to fight bottom, you can split push top, then TP, farm 1 or 2 camps beside bot, and then join a fight.

Also, don’t forget the basic decision making rule for every carry :

**Pounce on free kills, push when you can, fight when you have to, otherwise farm**.",2016-09-12 08:29:19+00:00,d7jbywr,1.0,t3_52d6os,3437.0,learndota2

754,"I don't like Vlad's or Aquila at all on visage. Think of it this way : at level 6, in 8 auto attacks, your birds do about 600 physical damage combined. With an Aquila, it goes up by about 5 (I think) per auto attack, so 80 more damage for 1000 gold. It's not really that much, actually. If you really want to increase your damage with visage (which is completely viable), the more effective way is medallion of courage to increase your burst. The classic build for visage is : boots - medallion - tranquil boots - agha and crest in no particular order. It gives armour which goes well with visage's high HP but low armour (his agi is horrible during the whole game).

My favourite build is a bit different, it's arcanes into mek. The reasoning behind it is that I want to be ahead on visage, and if you are ahead you don't build damage, you build survivability. If you are behind, it's a very good idea to buy damage items but if you are ahead survivability makes the difference between getting killed and surviving a gank then getting 3 kills.

I have seen other players get crest and treads but I have not played with this build yet so I can't really comment on it.

For your extension items, I would say agha is mandatory almost every game. It's just too good.

757,"Yo ! Visage is my most played hero and my favorite support, with about 60% winrate over 90 games or so. I’m not a very high level player so take what I say with a grain of salt.

So first of all, you were asking about micro. 95% of the time you will do the same thing with both of your birds, so you can use separated control groups but it’s not necessary if you are learning. Practice using combos with only 3 control groups : one for Visage himself, one for birds + Visage, one for familiars.

As far as micro goes, an important aspect that you didn’t mention in your post is **sparing your commands**. That means don’t use too many commands to do one thing. That will make your microing simpler because you will naturally think about *other* stuff than microing birds if you use less commands to do it. I hope it makes sense. So for example, don’t spam right click a location where you want to go, just right click it once and then look at the map. This applies to every hero, but I found out that it helps a bit more on micro heroes like Chen or Visage.

You are practicing against bots which is good. I would suggest you practicing your combos against bots a bit, before going into real games. But don’t be afraid of diving into real games with Visage, you won’t learn much vs bots besides mechanical things.

Your basic combo is the following :

Select Visage + birds -&gt; right click enemy -&gt; select Visage, use Grave Chill -&gt; use Soul Assumption as soon as you reach 6 charges. You can add your stone form usage to this combo (select birds then tab-q tab-q tab-q) or items (for example you can initiate ganks with Atos and Crest). Practice that a bit.

&gt; For example, if I'm pushing the top lane I'll have a familiar in the treeline and when enemy heroes tp in, I use it to stun and escape from/initiate a fight based on the situation. Am I on the right track?

That’s an example of a good decision that you can make with Visage. You are certainly on the right track. However, Visage’s decision making is very complex (and that’s where I fail the most, personally) and there are many aspects to it.

Visage is hard to play because of his decision making, and that’s the most important thing to improve when you want to play Visage well. An important caveat of Visage is that **he is extremely slow and immobile**. He has no mobility outside of Grave Chill, 285 base MS, he can’t rotate before he gets levels, and most importantly his familiars can not join him across the map. That means that if you don’t want to resummon for a teamfight, you need to *predict* where fights will happen. To be more specific, you need to know what both teams will do in 1 minute and what you need to do at that moment.

The basic decision making on Visage goes as follows for me (if you are playing him as a safe lane support, you can play him pretty much everywhere but this is the most common) :

Pre-6 : Can you pull the safe lane to get experience ? Then do so. Do you need to zone and can you zone without losing all of your HP ? Then zone instead of pulling. Do you need to help another lane and are you sure that you will help in a meaningful way ? Then TP there. It’s pretty standard support playstyle so far.

Post level 6, it changes a bit. Basically, you need to find farm wherever you can. Ideally, you want to sit on your safe lane while your carry is farming the jungle and push it slowly, then chip away at the tower with your birds. That’s your standard decision. Visage is good at pushing so try to push as much as you can with him. Alternatively, you can smoke and get roshan, or farm the jungle. But always try to find farm on him. Visage is kind of farm-intensive.

Every time you can, watch the minimap. If you think that your team wants to force a fight and you can get there with your birds in one minute, and you think you can win this fight, go help. If not, keep pushing the tower in the lane in which you are. When the T1 is down, switch lanes. Got it yet ? **Farm and push**. Visage needs farm to be useful, he needs to be ahead to have an impact. Don’t play like a standard pos 5. I made this mistake when I started playing him and I started winning a lot more by playing him in a greedy way. Visage is good at pushing so abuse that. Whenever you can, hit towers with birds. 

You started grasping how to teamfight with Visage : use your combo on squishy heroes, spam SA, use stomp either when your familiars have no damage charge, when they are in danger, or when you can hit a 3 man double stun. That’s a very tiny portion of the decision making of this hero, and this hero is very unique in terms of playstyle. You need to play many games to get used to Visage, but it’s a blast when you can play him well. Especially at low MMRs, he is a monster.

I hope that it helped. Good luck on le balanced spooky bird. Don’t be afraid of playing him against humans, mind your own farm after level 6, try to get a fast level 6, and predict each team’s movement.

792,"Thanks a lot for this response ! It’s really helpful.

&gt; If you're worried about Denmark attacking you before Sweden becomes independent, the most important thing is how big of an enemy you'll face. Who is Denmark allied to? If PLC are allied to them I'd be worried, but it sounds like you have a strong enough alliance through vassals and Livonian Order to withstand a war against only Denmark and his vassals (and unions). 

I’m pretty sure he is. On the last independance war for sweden (which failed) I was ripped apart by a 40k stack made of polish and lithuanian soldiers. I have not checked but I think they are still allied.

&gt; I wouldn't worry as much about the Ottomans, just don't expand directly towards them, and since you have both Golden Horde and Kazan as vassals it seems to me like your expansion will halt at the Caucasus Mountains, where you should be alright in avoiding an Ottoman interference. I'd focus on expanding towards Ming as quickly as possible, my most recent Russian run was rather successful because I was able to take and core some extremely valuable land from them which helped tremendously against the Western enemies. 

So take land for my vassal from Caucasian land, then expand into Uzbekistan and the various hordes. Got it. That should be easier. That being said, I really want Constantinople, I guess I will have to wait it out and see if it’s worth it. Is it even possible to go for India and China at the same time eventually ?

&gt; As far as military tech goes for Russia, I've always been an advocate for defensive ideas. The morale bonus is ridiculous, and as Russia a common strategy that works for me is to bait them into losing men on sieges on castles during the winter, eating away at their manpower until you can win some victories and simply overwhelm them with men. I know on this subreddit people hate castles and are of the opinion of getting rid of them, but I always try to keep a few in strategic places making corridors for my enemies on whichever front I think they are needed the most. Quantity is NOT a dumb idea group, especially for Russia as it makes your already cheap large army cheaper and larger. There is no shame in having massive armies that suck at fighting--the deaths of several thousands of peasants are nothing compared to a single victory XD

I have seen several people advocate for Defensive ideas, but it seemed pretty counter intuitive to me since I just plan on annexing Asia. But this morale bonus looks strong. IIRC defensive ideas also give better generals, right ?

&gt; Westernization will put your tech group at 100%, and will benefit from the -5% tech cost as well as the Russian Idea of -10% after you complete the idea track. Usually by the time you westernize and get up to speed you can remain at the forefront of tech even without the -5%, but in this case you should really be ahead. 

*rubs hands together and smirks*

Great. I should outmatch the hordes easily then (and maybe Ming by the time I reach them ?)

&gt; I can try and post some pics of my run if you'd like although it sounds much different than yours, I always aim to westernize with the decision (taking Danzig) so I bum-rush Livionian order and try to take it early after. 

How do you pull it off ? Even in the early game the Poland-Lithuania was really much a deterrent to me, and the fact that I could not ally Denmark was even worse. The first independance war of Sweden confirmed what I thought : I can not stand to their troops if they attack me directly, so I need to be smart and let them attack me in winter.

&gt; I hope this helps, and I hope you consider all your options, each game is a little different and there are no right answers really. Its always about what you want your nation to become and as Russia you have plenty of options, don't feel too pressured away from a bloody fist-fight with PLC once you think you can take them, the challenge of taking them down has always been rewarding to me, even if I even lose a war or two.

It’s only my first run as Russia so I don’t know which opportunities I have, that’s why I was asking. Thanks again.",2016-09-07 15:30:30+00:00,d7cw09i,2.0,t1_d7cv9ev,1011.0,eu4

1) Iron Talon makes the early lane agression less rewarding and because of the way creeps move you can be 100% sure that he will at least be level 4 by min 10, which is a big slap in the face to lane dominant heroes like PL

2) Comeback gold is given in a way that makes it extremely favorable if you are slightly behind.

I would love to have stronger/more frequent siege creeps so that you could actually push the tower while the offlaner is busy outleveling you in the jungle with Balanced Talon. On the same vein, make split push actually matter. Right now, if you split push you are doing something that’s very risky, because you make your team feed more gold to the enemy team, with very little reward. Dota is basically random laning for 15 minutes and then everything is decided in teamfights. So fun to play, so rewarding, so tense. Waow.

The carry role is being dumbed down since at least 2013, but it’s an extremely interesting role to play and I would love to see every carry have a slightly different niche.

820,"Ideally, you should get a little bit of XP, but not that much. It depends on the hero, of course, but most of the time you will be level 6 by 10-12 minutes as a support, and that is if you have a decent game. As a support, you need to basically make sure your carry has the game of his life. Your sources of XP are :

- Sometimes standing in XP range while zoning (limit it as much as you can, but it’s okay to be level 2 with your carry level 4 and the enemy offlaner level 2 4 minutes in)

- Pulling, **if you don’t have anything better to do than pulling and your carry can not do jungle rotations yet** (unless you do a 3:15 single pull or something like that)

- Bounty runes

- Ganks

- Jungle farm or leeching XP when a core takes your stacks (by that time they don’t need more levels and you will definitely need them)

- Lane farm if your carry went to the jungle, if your mid left to jungle, or if you happen to have a free lane anytime. It’s common on Drow-Visage lineups for example. Drow will need to leave the lane with a Helm of dom very early and Visage can farm and push out his safe lane to get levels.",2016-09-06 14:44:09+00:00,d7bitq9,5.0,t1_d7biai0,828.0,DotA2

You don’t really build Atos on Skywrath Mage, unless you are playing him as a core and you don’t have sth like Axe/Clock/Bane on your team.

It would mostly be a nerf to core Silencer, Necrophos, and OD.

It would also be a nerf to Visage (because Visage loves Atos). Atos deserves a bit of love but overbuffing Halberd is not the way to do it. Atos needs to provide HP regen or mana regen because it’s in a very weird spot atm and it doesn’t really help farming (no regen) but there are better options if you want to fight (Vlad’s, Force Staff/Pike…)

PL doesn’t want to build BKB, he doesn’t want to build MKB either, and he relies on Diffusal so he is never « truly » 6-slotted. He is basically always at 4 slots + BoTs + Diffu. Think of AM, you often say AM can not be truly 6 or 7 slotted because of BF but for PL Diffu gives him the same problems and he can not even get 6-slotted before the enemies do.

There is no real reason to pick PL, unless the enemy team went with many heroes really weak to mana burn like WK+Dusa, and even if they did an AM pick does just as well for mana burn purposes (for Dusa at least), but AM is also less easy to counter, pushes faster, farms faster, and has multiple peaks (farming peak when he gets BF, fighting peak at around 25-30 mins when he has treads + Manta + Vlads/VG + BF, etc). He also reaches late game quicker and he is actually able to fight into a Medusa with an advantage even between 20 and 30 mins in, when Dusa’s farming potential kicks in and she has 1 or 2 major items already.

I really wanted to flame too. But dota is not a game of distributing blame. Dota is about making decisions to destroy an enemy ancient. Just like in life, you will see unfair situations happen. But it’s not about recognizing unfairness, it’s about making decisions based on that.

And to quote Sylvester Stallone : « It’s not about how hard you hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward. » I’m starting to be a bit cringey but you get the point.

If you can dominate trilanes as Timbersaw and you don’t die a lot in your games I can guarantee you that you will have a very good winrate (like above 70% good).",2016-08-16 12:20:35+00:00,d6jl81b,5.0,t1_d6jkzhb,528.0,learndota2
1039,"&gt; Actually some people can be a good carry, but shit at decision making.

100% disagree, decision making is everything when you play carry.

&gt; Best example is EE, he has the ability to carry, but he has so many retarded moves that he should rather play pos3, so if he dies, the game is not thrown. I hope you get what I'm trying to say.

I get what you are trying to say but once again I disagree. EE always tends to take risky farm and leave safer farm for his teammates (and usually cores do that a lot because if they don’t their supports don’t have any item and they lose). Jacky is no exception. It’s strange that people like Agressif are known as spacemakers while EE is never called this way even though he always incorporates space creation to his game plan.

But back to the discussion…

I’m around the same level as you (hovering between 3k and high 2k). First of all, I think you definitely can improve as a support − support players make by far the biggest amount of mistakes at this level, so if you are a good support you prevent a teammate from playing a bad support in your team. In fact, I have about 60-65% winrate on my signature supports (Visage, Lion, Mirana, Bounty Hunter, and some others). If you have a high impact consistently, you will on average win a lot more than you lose. That doesn’t mean that you will have a 100% winrate, of course. For the anecdote, yesterday I was playing my BH, there was a jungle Naix in the enemy team (yeah, I know… at least he was on the enemy team). I started the game by disrupting his jungle, as usual. I also sniped the courier. At some point, Naix ragequit the game. Despite this early advantage (and I was 6 before 9 minutes as well), I still somehow lost. Our Clinkz was going for Orchid instead of normal items, and the risk he took didn’t pay off so he fell off really hard, and we had virtually lost the game at 20 minutes. These games just happen. No matter how good you are, you always lose games. Maybe it’s your Alchemist going for Midas, maybe it’s an intentional feeder, maybe your team loves to pick early game centric lineups but then force the late game, who knows.

The best advice in this case would be : try to pick a hero on whom you have clear benchmarks and you think you can do the same thing every game and win with it. For example, if you like playing offlane, try picking offlane Void, Bristle, or any hero really, and set yourself a goal like Treads+Talon+Vlads by 16 minutes on Void every game. Then spam this hero. It’s important to force yourself to be consistent. If you see that you are getting your items later than usual, you will see your own mistakes with ease and you will flame less, while improving tremendously. I personally played a lot of Enigma, Visage, and other heroes who had more or less the same game plan every game.",2016-08-16 12:03:20+00:00,d6jkrka,3.0,t1_d6jk9dq,1237.0,learndota2
1040,"I had kind of the same issue (and I still flame from time to time, but a lot less than before).

There are many solutions to this. I will give you a few tips that I used myself to get out of this mentality.

The first is to set up realistic goals for yourself. If you want to be 5k or more, and if you are not already experienced with Dota 1 or other games, it will take you time. If you learn quickly, you will climb quicker, but for example keep in mind that even if you have a 55% winrate you will gain on average 0.55×25 - 0.45×25 = 2.5 MMR per game. It would take you a total of 400 games to climb 1000 MMR with a final record of 220-180.

The second thing is to accept that some games are lost. It’s easier said than done. But for example if you have a dumbass support and you never have any win condition because of him, it’s probably a lost game, and since he is a bad support player he will blame you for the loss. Yesterday I had multiple games in a row where the score was beyond ridiculous in favor of the enemy team (something like 50-9… I don’t know why they didn’t just push and end when they could instead of wasting time tbh). In these cases, you need to keep trying because it’s dota and nothing is over until the ancient falls, but it’s extremely unlikely that you win.

The third is to realize that flaming reduces your chances of winning. Even if you flame because you started making the right play and your team didn’t follow up, flaming them makes them even less likely to follow your directions. Another thing you can do is « flame the game » instead of your teammates. For example I had a game where I was playing Morphling safe, with a Venge, and against a Timbersaw solo offlane. Timbersaw solo killed me when I was level 4 (he was 6) because Venge didn’t know what zoning was (and because le balanced reactive armor). He then proceeded to run around the tower for a good 35+ seconds to kill me a second time and nobody reacted despite the pings. I would have been right to say that Venge sucked ass at zoning because she was, but instead I just said « fuck this hero, really ». On a similar fashion, if you want to rant or facepalm, make sure your mic is off.

The fourth is to play with fun stacks. But depending on your luck you might not have this at hand.

Another solution is to play a bit of relaxing music. I don’t use it much, but some people do.",2016-08-16 09:19:37+00:00,d6jhkwn,1.0,t3_4xxdh2,22947.0,learndota2
1041,"The problem with Atos is kind of the same as Bloodthorn, except Atos is better than bloodthorn. Basically, it can not be fit on any hero’s build, except on Silencer, Necro, OD, or core Sky (and other stuff like Visage). It gives no regen so you don’t farm faster with an Atos. There is Hurricane Pike which gives comparable stats but regen and a better active as well. Atos is an item that requires you to be ahead to build, but at the same time it can be countered by cheap items (same problem as Bloodthorn), and blink daggers.

I like your idea a lot because it would remove one counter to Atos (Blink) and it would free up slots for supports. The regen aspect would also be partially negated. The only thing I have against it is that it will probably make Urn too good, and a lot of very good supports buy Urn already (Oracle, Wisp, Shadow Demon, even Dazzle can buy an Urn).

When you are level 6, you can solo kill any offlaner that doesn’t have an escape, like Tide. To do so, start pushing when the waves meet, and if the enemy offlaner tries to walk up to contest CS, use Eclipse when there is only 1 creep left. You can run down even Ench, since you have Lucent Beam. This is very useful against Timbersaw if you baited his Timber Chain, against Tide if he doesn’t have level 6 yet, and a few others.

How the fuck is it easier to play support decently compared to playing cores ? As a support you need to miss very few last hits and you are much more reliant on them than a core (because it’s not that bad if a carry loses 5 CS in the first 5 minutes, he can still get good timings, supports don’t have that much gold and space for CSing). As a support, you need to know how every single hero in your game is played to make good decisions. You have to watch your map constantly because you have to counter gank much more. You have to zone the enemy offlaner, which is easy, but if you do one mistake the enemy offlane is suddenly level 4. You have to gank mid and know how much vision the enemy heroes have during daytime and night time. You have to predict enemy wards.

Supporting is really hard to do well. At my dogshit level (3k) it’s by **far** the role where players do the biggest mistakes. And it’s understandable.",2016-08-11 09:18:47+00:00,d6d0wh1,6.0,t1_d6c3lok,55206.0,DotA2

And the carry role is great to improve because you can directly see the impact of your mistakes. For example you might lose out on 2 minutes of farm because you failed to maintain the creep equilibrium and you will notice it very quickly. OTOH as a support you could spend your life double pulling with an AM on your lane and then wonder why he is underfarmed.

Supporting is complicated. Don’t let low MMR players play support. In fact I would argue that if you want to progress as a player you have to play cores.",2016-08-11 09:14:14+00:00,d6d0tl9,4.0,t1_d6byv8o,60708.0,DotA2

1218,"It’s not very clear in PoGO because Ninantic decided that hiding info makes the game more « fun », so let me take an example out of one of the original games. It’s pretty much the same thing. Correct me if I’m wrong.

In the original (gen 1 and 2) pokémon games, Pokémon had IVs and stat XP for each stat, + a level.

Each time you get a level, you gain a certain amount of stats. These are deterimined by your pokémon species. For example, in generation 1, Tauros would have a very high speed every time because of it. In generation 1, Gyarados had pretty much always a very high attack.

Stat XP is decided by battling. Each time you would fight a Pokémon, you would increase your own stat XP in each stat (attack, defense, special, speed). For example beating ghastly would reward you with a lot of special, but very little speed. Beating a mankey would reward you with mostly attack stat XP.

So from these paragraphs, you would say that there is no difference between 2 level 10 pidgeys that you just caught, right ? Well, no. And that’s where IVs come into play. If you have time to spare, you can try to catch as many low level pokémon as you can. They will never have exactly the same stats. For example, one might have 3 more HP than another one, or maybe 1 or 2 more attack points. This is decided by IVs. In the original games, you had an IV value for each stat (attack, defense…) + HP. The higher IVs are, the higher pokémon’s base stats are. The important thing is that **IVs can never be changed by anything**. Leveling up doesn’t change the IVs you get. In the later generations, you often saw players catching hundreds of Ditto because they wanted to have one with perfect IVs to breed them, for example.

Now, back to Pokémon GO. PoGO is very simplistic in terms of mechanics, it’s pretty much a simplified generation 1 in this sense. When you catch a Pokémon, you have many things to take into account.

- **Pokémon level** : This is the arc thingy on top of him (yes, it’s not very clear… Thanks for not showing us a number, Ninantic &gt;&lt;). Each time they gain a level, Pokémon gain CP based on their species. **If you max out 2 pokémon of the same species (say, 2 rattatas), the CP obtained from levels will be identical**. Levels are capped at the same value for each pokémon, which is why every single raticate is terrible.

- **Base stats** : These are rather easy to understand. Base stats are, simply, stats a naked pokémon at level 1 would have with 0 IVs. An important thing to keep in mind is that **base stats are fixed depending on the pokémon itself**. That means 2 rattatas will always have the same base stats, but a pidgey and a rattata will never have the same base stats because these are fixed. **Base stats can not be changed in any way**.

- **~~Initial~~ Illuminati Values (IV)** : That’s where it gets interesting. IVs are stats that differentiate pokémon from the same species. In PoGO, these are 3 numbers that go from 1 to 15. These stats add to the pokémon’s strength. **IVs vary between different pokémon, and there is no way of changing them.** For example, you could have caught a Rattata with 10/10/10 IVs, but you will not be able to change these stats. There are 2 ways of having pokémon with better IVs :

- Catch a shitload of pokémon so that when you finally find one with perfect IVs, you keep it and use it

- Use eggs, they provide better IVs on average (apparently because instead of using one roll to calculate each IV, they take the max out of 3 rolls).

Now, there is no way of precisely knowing exactly which IVs your Pokémon has, but there are ways around it, used by the calculators. Here is how it works.

Your stamina IV influences HP and it’s the only IV which does that. Therefore, by getting your pokémon species, level, and HP, you can know how much stamina your pokémon has (roughly, because you can not determine pokémon levels precisely… Once again, thanks Ninantic)

Your pokémon’s CP is influenced by stamina IV×attack IV×defense IV. There is no other way of knowing either attack or defense IVs because this system is over simplified. So from your pokémon’s CP, since we can deduce your stamina IV from HP, we can determine attack×defense. For example, if you have a pokémon with 10/12/8 IVs, it’s possible to guess stamina, and it’s possible to guess that your defense×attack ivs multiply to 112, but it’s not possible to find out exactly which is which (roughly, because levels are not precisely determineable).

Against melee heroes, use Cold feet to bully them out of lane. Against ranged heroes, it depends on which items you took and who has the better last hitting capabilities. Against squishy mids like Death Prophet, try netting a kill when you get level 6. With a level 3 vortex, AA blast does a lot of damage this early and your opponents can not use faerie fires against it. Against other mid heroes, you can trade farm. **Spam ice blast after you get level 6, as much as you can**.

Beware, if you play against Weaver or Terrorblade, their ults *do* work through Ice Blast. They are not heals.

1374,"&gt; In hindsight I know what I did wrong, in game I have no clue why the game is going wrong. Afterwards I cringe at my choices I made, the CS I missed, the farming instead of pushing.

You need a better way to look at your replays, I would say.

It’s kind of specific to one person, but I would suggest this :

Watch only the first 20 minutes. Early game mistakes are the most devastating and the easiest to fix in general. Ask yourself how you used your starting items, how much the enemy offlaner got, how much you got, how much your team got. Here are a few examples of bad early game decisions for safe lane carries :

- Not pushing the lane when the enemy offlaner left to the jungle

- Not optimizing his own farm by abusing pulls and stacks when the enemy offlaner can not push quickly or contest CS

- Bad control over the equilibrium in the first minutes (depends on your supports too)

- Not joining fights early enough, especially after level 6 on someone like Jugg or WK.

Be also mindful of your early item choices. If, say, you are playing Luna and you are dominating your lane, but you want to push instead of trading right clicks, finish Aquila before Treads. If you are not doing well in lane, get Helm of Iron Will first. If you are dominating the lane and the enemy offlaner has no intention of leaving (let’s say you are vs Clock or Pudge), Treads first is great.

(I hope the next paragraph doesn’t count as self-promotion)

If you want, I also made a peer review thread on /r/learndota2 : https://www.reddit.com/r/learndota2/comments/4v2p09/roast_my_replay_week_5/

You can submit one of your replays for analysis and review someone else’s.

1407,"Serious talk here.

IMHO, Xyclopz deserves an invite because of his work, but at the same time I think Valve can not invite him as a caster.

Here is why he deserves an invite (for me at least) :

- He is a good at solo casting, especially games that would otherwise be really boring.

- He is entertaining, in a very different way than casters like Slacks (if you call Slacks a caster, that is).

- He proved multiple times that he is fully capable of handling *very* tough casting schedules.

**However** :

- He seems very shy to me. Every time I hear him in duo casts (which is not often), he talks a lot less than the other caster, and it’s just not the same thing. With his friends it’s better, but still not as good as his solo casts.

- He is not very experienced with duo casting, probably due to shyness

- He is not as comfortable with english as many other casters are. It doesn’t seem like a big deal at first but I think it is. It makes conversations during casts less natural.

If I were Valve, I would invite him as a panelist rather than a caster. Or as an interviewer, possibly.

Edit : I just want to be clear. I’m not flaming Xyclopz, in fact I think he is a good caster. But I don’t think he will be in a Valve event anytime soon, unfortunately :/

1409,"Don’t believe anything your teammates say at 1.5k. I’ve seen people at even 2.5k claiming that the game was « lost » because we had « 3 offlaners ». We had Clinkz, Elder Titan, and Tide (and we won this game with ease, btw). 1.5ks say so many stupid things, if I had to facepalm at them my face would look like Void’s in no time.

Wisp is a good pick when you have these 2 situations :

- **ONE** of your teammates understands the hero

- The teammate in question plays a carry that has some synergy with Wisp.

You can absolutely pick him at 1.5k, but don’t go for half assed items like that. Don’t get Armlet if you want to play him as a support. You had a gauntlet of strength, but no Bottle (???), and no soul ring or even glimmer cape either.

90% of the time, don’t start with any item and get the rune for a quick bottle and dual lane mid with your teammate that has a wisp carry. The other 10% of the time, either iron talon jungle or babysit but let the other support buy support items. Wisp is not a 5 in pubs, so don’t play him like a 5. In fights, use your relocate mostly as a defensive measure. For starters, don’t use relo agressively past 20 minutes or so in pubs. The threat of a relocate gank is strong enough that the enemy team will not split up very much most of the time. However, a defensive relocate + bottle charges + urn will heal your carry up in no time.",2016-07-28 12:10:00+00:00,d5ubiay,1.0,t3_4uwnzy,57700.0,learndota2

1415,"As a support, even if you play a micro heavy hero like Chen or Beastmaster, microing is not your priority. If you can micro your creeps to do a perfect bodyblock while you attack and cancel your backswings with your hero, you are a korean micro god. But the thing is : you don’t need it. Micro is important, it will make the difference in some games. But in reality, it’s secondary. Winning games comes off knowing how to play dota well, and knowing your hero.

Since you are a support player, I assume you want heroes that can play a support position like Chen, Ench and (somewhat) Visage or Beastmaster ? Start with the basics : learn to use commands effectively (A-click is your friend). Basically, don’t right click on the map for no reason. You will see that microing heroes will become very natural once you learn to micro only when you need to. The second thing you need to focus on is game plans. It’s just like in Chess : knowing a myriad of possible openings is great, and it helps a lot to focus on some of them to learn. But if you do moves mindlessly without plans, you will lose games. For example, on Chen, you need to plan your rotations a bit, knowing your peaks. You need to know how to reliably get a Mek at 12 minutes when you are not contested in your jungle, while doing 1 or 2 rotations and getting at least level 7-8 during that time. This is *not* micro. This is playing dota correctly. Afterwards, you can focus on very specific microing like bodyblocking with summons, or doing very specific comboes (for Chen : Net into Stomp into Clap, for example). But before trying to do that, you need to know your hero, not just know how to be flashy with him.

Even if you do this mid game pub build on him (Treads + Diffu straight away, no Vanguard), he still doesn’t do much in game and he falls off even harder because he has no BoTs.

Since it allows you to stay on the map after a fight even if you drop below 150 mana because you can keep spamming Snake, and it allows to fight again earlier.

1489,"As you said, it’s impossible to play against. They will just win early. Kappa

But seriously, here is what I would do against this kind of strat :

- These push strats are usually very greedy with their supports. Since they want to kill towers quickly, they rely on having supports that are ahead most of the time. Not to mention a lot of greedy supports (Keeper of the Light, Enigma, Chen, Ench, CM…) either have their peak during the end of the early game or are very good at farming. In your case, none of their cores is a mek carrier, which means they rely on someone like Chen or Enigma (or maybe BH, who knows) to get an early mek. Supports can achieve early mek timings (Enigma can reliably get a mek at about 8 minutes in, even with bad luck on spawns, Chen can get a 12 minute mek reliably while getting involved in 2-3 early rotations). But it usually requires them to not be disturbed too much in the early game, or to rack up kills. And if their BH is 6-0 early on, you might have another problem than just this strat.

- In your case, they are also greedy with their cores. Their 3 cores are squishy without items and they need to have a lead to function well. If the game is even by 15 minutes and you have something like Medusa you are good to go.

- These 3 heroes are OK when it comes to teamfighting, but they are not excellent.

In your particular case, here is what I would do :

- **take a mek carrier that can farm well early on**. My top 2 would be either Dark Seer (very good against *both* TB and Drow, probably the pick I would go for here), or Enigma (also a very good pick here). Otherwise, you could also go for Tidehunter (and Tide + Enigma !), or even something more unusual like a Mek Bristleback or a Chen. In either case get an early mek.

- **Have counterpush**. In your case, I would pick Winter Wyvern. WW is disgustingly good against heroes like Terrorblade, because you can make 3 terrorblades kill their teammate with their insane damage output. Splinter Blast also destroys pushes. Another pick that would probably be a lot less good but still worth mentioning IMHO is Treant, if you have good counterpush otherwise. But you need to make sure the enemy team can not just take your towers, you need to heal them. Lich can also function really well, because of his laning, Chain Frost, and Ice Armor.

- **Pick teamfighters.** In pubs, you can memorize this rule : Push &gt; Split Push &gt; Teamfight &gt; Push. Once again, Dark Seer comes to mind. Same for Crystal Maiden, Winter Wyvern, or even AA. For your carry, I think the best choice here is *Medusa* actually. Medusa is surprisingly strong at fighting early if you don’t build joke items on her, and she can either completely take over games or build rapiers and win if it’s even.

I would probably pick something like Dark Seer/Tide + Enigma/Chen + Winter Wyvern/KotL + Medusa + an orchid carrier for Terrorblade in the mid lane.",2016-07-26 09:35:34+00:00,d5r9n37,1.0,t3_4uno6y,2987.0,learndota2

What you said is true if you play Abaddon as an offlaner. As a support you will have mana problems and you will need survivability beside your ult because Borrowed Time can be very easy to play around (especially against OD or SD).

It can be a long learning process, and it makes Visage tough in general. Even after 85 games I still fuck up like that. However, you need to evaluate things like this when you decide to engage with your birds :

- Does the enemy team have particular abilities that work very well against birds ? For example Split shot, Flak cannon, Tombstone, Plague Wards, Geminate attack, Battle Trance.

- Do they have flying vision ? If they do wait for the fight to break out before sending birds and be more careful.

- How much attack speed does each enemy have ? You don’t need to be very precise, but for example know that an AM hits quite fast with level 16 and manta. Some heroes are food for you because of their inability to get rid of birds and their naturally low AS (examples : Pudge, Pugna, Tiny…)

- How many heroes are likely to focus your birds ? If it’s 2 or more, don’t send them. Just use Soul Assumption and wait for 4 seconds.

1552,"Yo, Visage spammer here (85 games, 63% winrate). Here is my take on this :

Visage is garbage since 6.87, basically. The strengths of this hero are :

- He is very good at bursting people (600 physical + 400 magical damage over 3s at level 7 and 400 magic damage every 4 seconds in fights, not bad).

- He is good at pushing safely with birds.

- He can fight all the time.

Here are his downsides :

- **Needs to be ahead**. It’s huge. Visage is a hero on whom you need to get a lead and keep it. He is a siege tank that bursts very well, but he plays a supportish position. Which means in order to have an impact, you must be a threat to the enemy supports, at least. That means being ahead of them. He pushes well, but offers no counterpush.

- **XP and farm-dependant, more than typical supports**. This makes Visage risky to play. Let me harp on it some more : Visage is really bad at playing from behind.

- **He is not good against tanky heroes**. Simply because he relies on, well, being able to kill heroes. And he offers very little utility. On paper Grave Chill is nice and all, however in practice the later it gets the less you will be using it, and the less it matters. Coincidentally, that’s also the last spell you max out. Your only form of lockdown is bird stun, and even though it got a very nice buff in 6.88b (finally a buff Visage needed, instead of another Cloak buff), it’s still not enough to make him a decent utility hero. The fact that he sucks against the likes of Sven, DK, or anything that carries armlet is a very big indirect nerf to him, and the primary reason as to why he fell out of the meta IMHO.

- Echo sabre = fuck off, birds.

- Heroes that are very good against him are popular atm. Among others : Medusa, Weaver, Chen, Ench, Dark Seer, Night Stalker, Terrorblade, and some others.

- He is, in a lot of ways, a worse Beastmaster.

- He is weak against mobile heroes, simply because he is one of the worst blink carriers in the game. He is OK with force staff, but he can not use it agressively at all. Visage is immobile in every aspect. Resummon has a very long cooldown which makes it worse.

- He kind of sucks in lane, even with all the cloak buffs he got. He needs his carry to GTFO as soon as possible to farm the lane by himself and get levels, but it doesn’t work anymore if you do that.

- And lastly… It could be controversial, but I think the most popular pro builds on this hero atm (Tranquils into Solar Crest into Agh’s) are no longer optimal. I think a Mek build is much stronger on this hero, simply because it helps him pushing and because he relies on getting ahead. And if you are ahead, it’s in general better to grab survivability items (Mek) instead of damage items (Solar Crest). Mek also allows him to be an actual siege tank.

Some chinese teams still pick Visage from time to time, because Visage is a trademark hero for chinese teams (just like Wisp was for european teams). DDC in particular is a monster on this hero, MMY! is also pretty good. But Visage doesn’t win games very easily now, compared to a hero like Lion (who needs less farm and brings more utility), Beastmaster (a lot quicker at farming, more utility, comparable pushing power), Chen (a lot more utility, more mobility, a lot quicker at farming), or Disruptor (a lot more utility).

Oh, and Timbersaw is notoriously good against Visage. Riki too.

Don’t get me wrong, he is a very fun hero to play and he still wins pub games. But in pro games, he is not picked for a number of very good reasons.

1570,"People will tell you to buy diffusal, but the real answer is to have a mic and yell at your team to back when you see Guardian angel, *unless you have multiple diffusals*. It’s important to make the omni useless in one way or another as well, try picking heroes like Nyx to jump him and force him to not use his spells the way he wants. Support Omni is very easy to bring down.

Another solution is to pick heroes that do both physical and magical/pure damage (Gyro, Visage, Invoker, QoP, etc), heroes that don’t care about BKB or physical immunity (OD doesn’t care about GA, for example), heroes that split push and avoid teamfights (jungle Lycan…), or heroes that can take over the game before Omni gets relevant because he needs levels and farm.

1572,"Thanks a lot for that. A couple of things to clarify :

- The reason why I took a few points in Enchant early is because I thought I would need Enchant a lot in this game : it’s effective against PL because you can get one of his illus (bonus points if SD also disrupts it), and you can take Forged Spirits from Invo. While I should probably have gone for my standard skill build (2-1-2 into 4-1-2-1) there was some thought process behind the 2 levels in Enchant.

- I play a lot of PL and I disagree on your point about him. PL definitely cares about single target damage. For example on LC, you don’t need to let him form an army and then kill him with Overwhelming Odds, you just need to identify the real one (with Arc Lightning for example), jump on him with Duel, and burst the real PL down. PL is notoriously squishy and reliant on mobility. PL was not really my primary concern in this game, because we had a lot of ways to deal with him (Zeus, LC, SD, Ench). My main worry was Invoker for the late game.

- I didn’t think about going bottom, but you were right.

- There was no coordination to set up smoke ganks, but I was planning on solo smoking during the early game and I didn’t use my opportunities.

Can you link me a few games of Puppey Ench to illustrate your points ?",2016-07-22 11:22:24+00:00,d5m77aj,3.0,t1_d5lqgob,37755.0,learndota2

This is also one of my weak points. Lately I almost don’t play gank heavy heroes anymore so I don’t think about fog as much as before. Your replay helped me see this issue.

&gt; I've been getting Aquila on support Mirana to help transition, and I think you're probably right that I'm wasting gold on it.

To be precise : I think Aquila is a waste because you buy it for the efficient early game stats. However, Infused Raindrops instead of Aquila to let you spam starstorm would be probably worth it, if you were planning on transitioning. Items like Drums can also be considered in this situation, I would say.

1579,"Let’s do this !

- Start of the game : You actually bought your own ward, that’s nice. I don’t agree that much with the 2 clarities, since you are against a PA and PA can just harass you with dagger I would rather see a branch on you instead of this second clarity. (Edit : Oooh, I didn’t see that you were playing support Mirana -_- in this case it’s fine)

- I dislike your early ward placement. I was placing this ward until not long ago and I stopped because it’s pretty much worthless. If the enemy team pulls towards the small camp, I’m happy as an offlaner. That means they either spent at least 30 seconds stacking it + pulling, or that they single pulled the lane which wins you the equilibrium war for 3 minutes in exchange for 100 XP on the supports. Totally worth it.

- 0:30 - 1:00 : you are under an enemy ward. You could notice the enemy Lich placing it because he walked up to you with a ward and then showed up without it. But I will give it back to you, it’s pretty hard to predict. In either case, you are playing a Mirana support and Legion should do just fine. Leave her alone for now and spend your time arrowing big creep camps in the enemy jungle and arrowing the mid lane. Looks like you were going to do that at 1:00, good.

- 1:28 : Nice arrow. Is that a bearless druid ? Holy shit, no wonder you won.

- 2:00 : Don’t try to gank LC’s lane, you have no way of killing them before LC has at least 2-3 levels in Odds. Just arrow a big camp and scare the LD away from his lane. You are not going to snipe a courier, but you can make him play scared. Instead, you go under a ward, so it’s a loss of a potential 80 gold from a big creep.

- 4:30 : Nice back-to-back kills on the Slardar. Now you *really* need farm and levels. Just because you are a support, doesn’t mean you should not care about your hero. CM is leaving you her whole jungle to farm, take advantage of it (even though CM should be farming the jungle atm)

- 5:30 : Once again, staying in trees has no point. The enemy team knows you were there not long ago and you have no way of killing anyone because Sniper can use Shrapnel to defend his Slardar if he gets arrowed and Slardar can Crush.

- 6:00 : Ok, I take it back, you accomplished something.

- 7:00 : Your ganks are telegraphed, don’t show in enemy vision if you want to arrow. You should just ask OD to set up your arrow with Imprisonment and go farm if he doesn’t do that.

- 8:10 : Once again, you were not patient enough with your arrow. You should have asked LC to set you up with Duel.

- 8:40 : What are you thinking while casually standing here ? There is no way you accomplish anything, get away. Arrow the troll before getting back.

- 8:57 : Yeah… You were dead long ago, the enemy team just took some time to finish you off.

- 10:00 : Don’t throw arrows from vision, unless you are set up by a teammate.

- 10:48 : You are seeing their Lich in a very agressive stance and all of their heroes are missing, it’s a pretty clear sign that they are chilling in your jungle, waiting for one of your teammates to come by. GTFO and push mid.

- 11:13 : Even though it looks OK because you only lost your supports, keep in mind that you had a very slight lead and any kill gives a shitload of gold for some reason when you are ahead by 0-4k gold.

- 11:50 : You got your FIRST lasthit of the game. Shows well how you refused to farm, and that was your biggest mistake in the early game.

- 13:40 : Seriously, what’s the point of getting Aquila on a support… Especially since you know your team has a basi because you benefited from its aura multiple times. Get Agh’s. Or mek.

- 16:51 : Nice bait. That was ballsy but it ended up working.

- 17:58 : I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt and say you sacrificed your life for OD’s. In this case it was a good decision.

- 19:40 : That’s a very good ward, but it’s likely to be dewarded. You can also wait for the tower to fall and place it behind it.

- 20:00 : You backing off was the correct choice, since you saw that Spectre was top without Haunt.

- 20:30 : Use a smoke for this kind of movement. You went under a ward, so you made CM, LC and you waste time.

- 21:00 : This fight went badly for a few reasons. First, Spec jumped on Lone Druid, with like 125525425 points in stats. Second, you stacked up for a Lich ult. You needed to use Moonlight Shadow to set up a fight and move as a group of 4. Ideally, you needed to catch PA. Your legion has blink and she is finally starting to believe that Odds is a spell. Duel into Arrow is a sure kill.

- 23:00 : Wait for the duel to arrow, ffs. Once again, your LC lost duel damage because of it.

- 24:32 : Stop moving so far forward… As a support Mirana, your best skill by far is Arrow. Don’t try to get in position to use Starstorm, it will get you killed. Luckily your team won that fight thanks to a bad initiation.

- 25:30 : I don’t know why you TPed there, it made no sense. Your team had no Haunt.

- 26:28 : Are you dancing with your team ? What are you doing ? You have been doing nothing but leave footprints on the map for 1 minute now. That’s about 1.2k-1.4k gold wasted across your team.

- 27:40 : Do something, anything. Throw an arrow at the medium camp to farm it, I don’t know. You have CM aura, so spam arrow more.

- 28:00 : Ah, the classic « Walk uphill without vision and go in front of your team as a support » strat. First, you needed to ward more agressively - I would have put a ward close to the dire blame spot, just outside of sentry range, + a ward between the mid T2 and the bot T2 for dire to scout smokes and rosh attempts. Second, you had no vision of the enemy team. Trying to use Spectre’s radiance was a good idea but you got too hot headed.

- 29:00 : Useless TP, once again.

- 29:54 : You have not hit a creep in about 50 seconds. When your team is trying to avoid farming, take the farm.

- 30:30 : You should have bought these Raindrops instead of Aquila very long ago.

I stopped watching here. Basically, you need to :

- Understand how being hidden affects the enemy team as a Mirana in the early game

- Farm more (if you have 0 CS at 10 minutes you are not playing mirana properly, or you have an absurd arrow accuracy which you had not)

- Don’t go for stupid items like Aquila on supports. Instead, prioritize stuff like Urn, Raindrops, even a casual Wind Lace would do the trick. Go for efficient survivability items.

- Trust your allies more to set up your arrows when you have stuff like OD, Legion, SD, or Bane in your team.",2016-07-21 22:10:11+00:00,d5lk6ev,2.0,t1_d5ld6xv,9421.0,learndota2

1638,"Visage is one of my most played heroes (about 63% winrate over 85 games). The biggest things to understand if you are looking to play this hero are :

- He is NOT a traditional support. Visage is XP-dependant and item-dependant, more than a lot of support heroes. Unlike Enigma, he can not flash farm from level 1. So get your level 6 fast. You need it. Adopt the mindset of a core when you play this hero.

- Visage has a few purposes : he is very good at bursting, he is good at pushing, and he is in general very good if you want to take off by the end of the early game. He shines when comboed with armor reduction (Slardar, Dazzle…) and with heroes that can either push very well (Luna…), or buff his birds (Drow, Lycan, etc). He is very weak against mobile heroes and heroes who can either ignore birds or kill them with ease. Avoid heroes like Medusa, Phantom Assassin, Venomancer, Weaver, Windranger, Undying…

- And probably the biggest thing to understand : **If you don’t plan on getting ahead early on, don’t pick Visage**. Visage is a hero that thrives when ahead. You can win games from behind with him, but the game gets exponentially harder and harder. You will notice in your games that there is a significant decrease in your game impact if you feed 1 bird between level 6 and level 11. It’s very important to not let go off your lead on this hero.

First of all, before playing Visage, go into a bot game and practice last hitting with your birds in one lane and your hero in another. It’s important because it’s the action which will take you the biggest amount of micro to achieve (Visage is not micro heavy otherwise). Once you are confident in your ability to last hit, go into a real game with real people. Try to go in a dual offlane, ideally with a core who is great in dual lanes (Ursa, Weaver…), a core that comboes with you in one way or another (Slardar, Lycan…), or anyone with a slow. Bully everything out of lane. After level 6, you need to keep in mind that **your hero is extremely immobile**. If you TP somewhere your birds don’t follow and resummon has an absurdly long cooldown. Visage can fight all the time because his cooldowns on Stone Form and Soul Assumption are very low, but he can not fight everywhere. Which leads me to my next point…

**Decision making** ! Visage’s decision making is very unique, and it makes the hero quite hard to master (it’s NOT because of micro that Visage is hard to play, once again). When you have level 6, you need to assess what will happen in the next minute. If you don’t predict a fight where you absolutely need to be, the standard plan is stay in one lane, farm with birds + hero if the enemy team is showing on the minimap, farm with birds only if you are past the river and it’s not safe. *Use familiar damage charges to hit towers*. Your familiars are targeted last by towers so as soon as a creep gets attacked by the tower you can go hit it with birds. Once you took the T1, go to another lane and keep going.

**Skill build** : I always do this skill build, which is not what pros do nowadays but it works well in pubs : Chill - SA - SA - Cloak - SA - Ult - SA - Cloak×3 - Ult - Chill×3 - Stats - Ult.

**Item build** : A lot of guys in this thread recommended going for Tranquils + Medallion. This build is not bad, but I prefer the following build :

Starting -&gt; Boots -&gt; Buckler + Ring of regen -&gt; Buckler + Headdress -&gt; Arcanes -&gt; Mek -&gt; Agh’s -&gt; Greaves -&gt; Force Staff/Atos/Ghost/anything.

Here is the reason why I prefer the mek build. **On Visage, Medallion/Crest is not a utility item, it’s a damage item**. Getting damage is never bad, especially on a hero like Visage. However, Visage is a hero who is meant to get ahead and keep his lead. If you are ahead, in general, you buy survivability, not damage. Second, **Medallion or crest don’t boost your damage to structures**. Mek indirectly helps your push because you can keep your allies and creep waves alive. Third, Visage doesn’t actually need that much damage in a real game. Visage never initiates ganks (until he gets Atos) because Grave Chill’s range is pitiful and familiars are easy to kite. So you will pretty much always be helped by an ally. Visage’s burst is already enormous, so with the help of an ally you should not lack damage. On the other hand, Mek helps you win teamfights. The biggest downside of my build is that it’s not very quick at taking roshan, which I have to mention.

If you need help or coaching, I can try. Anyway I hope I helped, good luck on the spooky bird. Don’t forget to name your familiars btw.",2016-07-19 14:41:22+00:00,d5i6i4g,1.0,t3_4tiyec,42604.0,learndota2

- **Alchemist**. It’s pretty obvious : Alch doesn’t really need levels at a crucial timing, compared to other heroes like Slark or even Phoenix. 190 gold is absolutely nothing for an Alch either, Alch gets consistently above 800 GPM even when he gets shat on.

- **Medusa**. Kind of the same story. Medusa doesn’t need to hit a certain level at a certain game time to be useful : she will take time to truly come online anyway, and she kills a lot of creeps very quickly so in general she has no trouble finding enough farm. Level 13 is all dusa needs (4-4-4-1) and by the time you reach level 13 you are probably close to your first major item.

- **Anti-Mage**. For 2k gold more, you can get a Battlefury and actually increase your farm rate instead of just getting a bit more XP. AM doesn’t need levels because BF makes him stupidly fast at farming. He also needs survivability and Manta. Midas can not be fit into his build without reducing his chances of winning.

- **Phantom Assassin**. You don’t need levels on PA, and you don’t need farming ability on her. What you need is to take advantage of the time period where Blur is strong. That’s why you see so many Vanguard-deso or Vlads-deso builds.

Midas is taken to get an XP lead or to pressure while farming on a hero who sucks without farm (Slark…). Or it’s taken on supports who are greedy but can not farm quickly (AA, Phoenix).",2016-07-13 11:44:39+00:00,d5agab1,1.0,t3_4smjzp,3043.0,learndota2

1731,"&gt; Then you get the skadi for even more stats and the illusions are very beefy. 

No they are not. Medusa’s survivability comes from Mana Shield, which illusions don’t share. Manta is completely anti-synergistic with Medusa’s whole skillset ; the only thing it does for you is allowing you to cast Stone Gaze if you are silenced, for the price of 500 EHP or so. Stone Gaze is your worst spell as Medusa.

For 4k gold, you could get a demon Edge and a Dragon Lance and it would do much more. Or you could get SnY for the same price, even though it’s not very good on Manta now it’s still better than Manta.

&gt; That being said, the last time I saw a pro go this build everyone in chat was shitting on the linkens but it ended up being a stomp with Medusa wrecking team fights. IDK, I hope someone with more knowledge will jump in.

This build is aimed towards survivability, of course when you are ahead it works. The disadvantage of this build is that the instant you lose your advantage you lose the game straight away.

In general the further ahead you are, the more you want survivability (Skadi, Butterfly if you are far ahead, etc). The further behind you are, the more you need damage. That’s why you see players going for straight divine when they are losing badly − it’s not to throw, it’s because in this situation divine is legitimately the best item they could get. In general, don’t be afraid of buying rapier early on dusa. You won’t lose games because you bought rapier too early, but you will lose games because you bought rapier late.

I see absolutely no reason to skip Mask of Madness, it’s so great on Medusa and personally I would build it every single game. One very underrated item on Dusa atm is Dragon Lance. Dragon Lance gives you almost as much benefits as an SnY, for half the price. I would not get it if I’m far behind, but I would say build it at least 80% of the time. Also, don’t forget to buy BKB if you need it. Medusa doesn’t like BKB that much but it can be necessary.

1770,"I played this combo from time to time as the Wisp. Here are my thoughts on it.

There are many reasons as to why these 2 heroes specifically. Some of them are :

- In the early game, when Tiny is level 10 or 11 (both nukes maxed out, grow leveled up) and Wisp is 6 or more, Tiny brings a lot to a relocate gank

- Tiny loves attack speed and movespeed (so Tether and Overcharge)

- Tiny loves mana

- In the late game, Tiny can backdoor with Overcharge.

Ideally, with Tiny Wisp, you want to be on Dire and go dual mid. The reason why you want to be on Dire is that you can stack 2 camps at once on Dire and you no longer can on Radiant. You can go Radiant mid and it works as well. But ideally, Wisp should be dual laning mid, even without a Tiny.

On Wisp, you need to start with a naked bottle rush. Yes, you heard it. A naked bottle rush. Ping your « Need 35 gold for Bottle » at the time you leave the base so your allies know that you know what you are doing. Always take Tether at level 1. You can take the bounty rune for a fast bottle, but you can also leave it to your tiny, it depends on your plan. In lane, here is a short list of what you can do as Wisp :

- Take runes (VERY IMPORTANT, you need bottle charges. Regen runes are your favorites, but even a DD rune wins you the lane).

- Zone out the enemy mid

- Stack camps (if you are on radiant, prioritize stacking medium camps as they have less MR)

- Gank the sidelanes (remember, you are a support, and you can follow up ganks from far away thanks to Tether)

- Use your bottle to regen the Tiny.

Ideally, you want your Tiny to use his spells to harass quite a bit after you hit level 2 (Overcharge) or if you are low on mana and have bottle charges. You also want to trade hits with the enemy mid if you are high on HP and Tiny is lower. The reason for that, of course, is that you also apply your regen to Tiny. When Tiny is level 5 (level 3 toss), go farm stacks if you made them. Try to get your level 6 reasonably quickly, as a pre-10 min level 6 wisp is gamebreaking.

Afterwards, it’s pretty straightforward. You mostly follow your Tiny around if Relocate is off CD. Hide in trees when Tiny is in an agressive position, you need to be ready to relocate him out. Using Wisp in fights is just good positioning and it’s quite straightforward.

There are 2 ways of using Relocate :

- Offensive relocate : it’s when you relo into a gank or a fight. Do it when you are ahead. The advantages of using Relocate offensively are that your Tiny is always farming and pushing, and only joins the fight on demand. OTOH, your Tiny has only 12 seconds to be useful.

- Defensive relocate : The most common use, and the safest. You walk into a fight without using relocate, then you relocate out one ally who is out of position to heal him. You don’t need to send back to the fountain, only a blink range away is enough.

For itemization, on Wisp it’s pretty standard. You have 2 builds : the « I’m far ahead » build (Mek + Arcanes) or the mekless build for when you have another mek carrier in your team, when you are a bit behind early, or when you have allies that also love having bursts of mana like DK (Tranquils+SR+Urn).",2016-07-09 10:37:29+00:00,d55epgk,1.0,t3_4rxmcz,40054.0,learndota2

1783,"The problem about Techies ATM is that he is a worse Brood. Brood does everything Techies does (pushing very early, demolishing trilanes, ruining life for the enemy supports, force out a lot of detection on the enemy team, stealing the enemy jungle), but better. Techies should on paper be safer to use since he has suicide, but there are so many games in which you win with Techies where you would have won just as easily with Brood.

So here are my ideas :

- Give assist gold and XP for kills that are made from across the map with mines.

- Halve the cooldown on Suicide if you get a kill with it to encourage its use as an offensive ability. Right now Suicide is used for kills during the first 10 minutes, but afterwards it’s only used to not feed your beyond godlike streak.

- Increase Land Mines’ damage to towers and reduce their mana cost slightly (maybe -5 or -10 in mana cost). Techies is a notoriously good pusher and this would allow him to actually be faster than Brood, without making Brood a worse Techies overall.

- Make Agh’s decrease the cooldown on Remote Mines slightly (like -1s or -2s) and increase their cast range (by 200 or so ?). This would make Techies useful outside of the games where he snowballs, since you would spend less time mining defensively. It would also add fighting presence to Techies.

Basically, make Techies slightly better at killing buildings and slightly better in the late game, while being a little less risky. Maybe adding all of these at once would be OP, but adding 3 of these changes definitely would not IMHO.",2016-07-08 14:33:34+00:00,d54a4c2,1.0,t3_4rujdb,5576.0,DotA2

1800,"The problem with Linken’s + Manta is that it’s a win more build that only works when you are ahead and even in this situation it’s not very good. The only hero on which Linken’s + Manta is a very good item combo is Morphling, because he has Morph to take advantage of the stats provided by these 2 items and Manta illusions from Morphling hit hard. The other hero that can end up building these 2 items together is AM, because Manta is actually a damage item on AM and Linken’s is situationnal on him (against Spirit Breaker, mostly). Medusa has no way of increasing her damage, she has a horrible agi gain, her illusions are worthelss because her natural base damage is really low and she doesn’t have passives like CK crit or Mana Break. Mana Shield doesn’t work on illusions either.

I’m pretty sure Manta+Linken’s is a relic from the old Dota 1 days where everyone was awful at dota and everyone built weird stuff like Radiance on PL. This build has been shit for a long time. It also comes with the misconception that Medusa is never the primary damage dealer of her team and she is always focused by the enemy team because you don’t want to deal with Stone Gaze, and they think that Medusa will magically come online after 45 minutes because you bought 2 worthless items early. That’s not true because :

- Stone Gaze is Dusa’s worst ability, it’s easy to disengage from it especially now

- If a Medusa buys items like Linken’s and Manta, she does almost no damage so you can just kill her team and come back to her later

- Medusa won’t magically win in the late game. The reason why Medusa is considered to be one of the best carries in the game is that she is the best divine rapier holder in the entire game, and DR is core on her. Unlike for example Ember who buys it only as a last item and when he is behind, Dusa buys it as a 2nd item if she is behind and as a 4th-5th item if she is ahead and didn’t win yet (you don’t buy it if you are really far ahead, of course…)

Cost-efficiency is a real thing on Medusa. Just because your hero is in no hurry to finish the game, doesn’t mean you should ruin your early game yourself. If you watched pro games with Dusa in it, you probably noticed that a lot of fights were lost right after Dusa purchased Manta because she didn’t have mana to ult when it mattered. This would never have happened with not-joke items.

You need to abuse your bracket’s weaknesses. First of all, when you play a core, pick something that can not lose his lane, like Medusa, Clinkz, Night Stalker, DK… Second, when you play support, abuse the fact that no one rotates mid and pick stuff like BH or Riki. Third, jungling is more viable than you think at 2k.

Play to your bracket’s weaknesses and strengths. Since supports typically have more farm at lower levels (and significantly more XP) use that to your advantage.

- They go well with the « no trilane » mentality at low brackets

- They push quickly

- They scale quite well with farm (Enigma has a huge spike between 8 and 20 minutes, and by that time hopefully your cores will be ahead from all the towers you take ; Visage peaks at every one of his ult levels, then with agh’s).

1839,"I’m a bit late to the party, but here is a bit of advice. I calibrated at 1.3k in 2013 and rose slowly to 3k where I am now.

The biggest thing **by far** is the first 10 minutes, and then it’s between 10 and 20 minutes. As a support especially, you absolutely need to not fuck up the early game. That means if you have a favorable lane, abuse it. Zone the enemies out of XP range. If you have an unfavorable lane, you can do a couple things : switch to the other side lane, grab an Iron Talon and jungle, gank mid, snipe couriers, shit on the enemy mid (if you have a specific support like Sky or Bane). The point is : **always be doing something useful**. The biggest mistake that I see supports do, by far, is standing behind the carry watching their butt. This makes you effectively play for the enemy team. Don’t do this shit.

My second advice is to pay a visit to /r/learndota2, I contribute to this sub from time to time and it’s great. No flaming allowed though. Yes your teammates are bad (it’s &lt;2k, what do you expect) but there is always something you can do better, especially if you consistently lose in this bracket.

I would also advise you to play cores. Usually people at low MMRs who only play supports play terribly wrong and only play supports because they can not play cores. *You need to understand why the support role exists*. Play carries. If you want to learn the game, my picks would be Luna, Gyro, and Anti-Mage. Practice against unfair bots and you will stomp no problem. If you want to go mid, something like Ember or TA is a great choice.

Fourth advice : at this bracket, no one will tell you anything useful in game. Mute your team. But you need to understand your own weaknesses and how to fix them. Highlighting your mistakes is very important, especially in the early game. Self-criticism is important. Rather than criticizng your plays, criticize your decisions and your plans.

Ignore this type of flame, it’s from players who don’t understand the hero.

1885,"&gt; edit : yea, I was trying to learn ""infinite night"" tactic tho. ah I mean how to abusing the ulti XD

A long time ago, NS’s ult paused the day/night cycle, so using it during the night extended the night and you wanted to use it during the night. But now it’s more beneficial to do it during the day because it no longer pauses the cycle. Just remember that it switches every 4 minutes (0-4 : day, 4-8 : night, 8-12 : day…) and that it lasts 50 seconds. Make it so that your ult doesn’t overlap normal night time. So for example, try to cast your ult at precisely 11:10, because it will mean a 4:50 long night. If you cast it a bit later, it will mean that you waste seconds of night time, and if you cast it earlier you will have a few seconds of daytime.

&gt; im taking vanguard (if im stil remember it) first, coz I know I taking a risk for not getting vlad but taking deso instead. so i need to had a quite bulky regen

I think you should really try Armlet ! Armlet is abusive in this patch, it’s extremely strong. With Armlet+VG+Deso+Phase you hit very hard (+65 damage from Armlet, +50 or so from deso with corruption debuff, and +24 from phase OSFrog). The first game I tried Armlet + VG I thought it was a bit overkill to have that much survivability, but that’s probably because I went for Helm afterwards. So I think a deso build would be perfect to balance out damage and tankyness while having a lot of survivability and pushing power with deso.

NS is a very fun hero though. Good luck with him.",2016-07-04 10:24:50+00:00,d4ynck2,3.0,t1_d4ymz26,1431.0,learndota2

1889,"Don’t go for Agh’s on a carry NS, it’s a good way to lose. Agh’s is super inefficient for a core NS.

I play quite a bit of mid NS, with about 70% winrate. Ironically, I lost every game I tried to support with him, in low level pubs NS is very strong as a carry because typically you are the only one that knows how to abuse fog as a NS in low level pubs. He also can not really lose mid, similar to a DK (but with less pushing ability and more ganking potential).

Here are my thoughts on your build :

- Phase are very good, it’s also my preferred boots pickup. Good synergy with Hunter in the Night.

- Abyssal Blade is great on NS all-around, especially the new Ablade. I don’t see the details of your build, but in general I advise you to pickup Vanguard quite early on (usually I get Phase into Vanguard)

- Deso is fine. It’s cost-efficient. If you go for Deso, I would advise you to go for Vlad’s or Armlet on top of your Vanguard. Having VG + one survivability item (Armlet or Vlad’s) makes you almost unkillable, and you already have great damage from Phase, hunter in the night, and vlad’s. Another build I like is going for Helm + Basher instead of Deso, which gives less damage but more tankyness and you can stack ancients with it to farm them. You are not a very quick ancient farmer but you can abuse your own ult to prevent the enemy team from contesting you (lack of vision)

- BKB and Moon Shard are very good pickups, but usually I prefer AC over Shard.

- In your early game items, consider either a Basi or Raindrops for mana regen.

- It’s a bit off topic, but your last hits are very low. In a 50+ minute game you should have around 250-300 last hits at least, depending on how active you were and how farm heavy your other cores were.

Now on your skill build, I think you actually made quite a lot of wrong decisions there. First of all, you maxed Hunter in the Night first, instead of Void. 99% of the time you want to max out Void first. Sometimes you take a value point in Crippling Fear early, and you can consider it against heroes like Huskar. But often you can skip it. Second mistake is taking ult at level 6. If you are mid, it’s not a good decision because you are not going to use your ult before the *end* of the first night, and by that time you will be level 7 or 8. One point in Hunter in the Night instead does a lot more good for you. Usually I end up with a 4-0-3-0 at level 7, then at level 8 I skill ult, then max out Hunter, then take one value point in Crippling Fear, 3 or 4 points in stats, and then I max Fear. I take ult at levels 11 and 16. The reason why I delay Crippling Fear’s levelup is because I found it enough to have a 5 second silence. Most of the time, you don’t need the full 8 seconds because you don’t need to stick up to a target for 8 seconds. Stats make you tankier and able to ball in more, and you can spam Void a lot more with levels in stats (NS takes very little mana to keep going).",2016-07-04 09:12:21+00:00,d4ym74y,1.0,t3_4r5oh4,14480.0,learndota2

And if you are not dumb, if you see quests like « Buy shadow amulet/shadow blade/silver edge before 24 », you will play SF, Slark, or a hero who goes really well with these items. If you see the necrobook quest, you will try to do it with a hero like Beastmaster or Lycan, because you would have done that either way to win the game.

I think that it’s really good for the versatility of the game, actually. Encouraging to hit item timings is a very good way to let people play heroes that are otherwise forgotten in pubs (for example BM).",2016-07-03 16:46:08+00:00,d4xsobc,6.0,t1_d4xryof,1212.0,DotA2

1912,"Here it is (watching from your player perspective, so I will have exactly as much info as you minus the items).

- Starting items. You randomed so you were able to get Tangoes + Salve + Clarity + Circlet + RoP + Aquila recipe. Although it’s a nice starting build in a vacuum, I disagree with your choice of going for Aquila. Basi is enough for you. **However**, it’s a very big deal that you are able to get your Soul Ring before you hit 6 so as to farm the big camp as quickly as you can. Therefore, usually I go for Tangoes-Salve-RoP-Soul Ring recipe.

- You took a long time to leave the base (you were… reporting players on the enemy team ?)

- Why are you standing in your jungle at -0:30 ? You are accomplishing absolutely nothing. The right thing to do is to watch your safe lane so that the enemy offlaner doesn’t ward.

- Good job at trading hits with Searing Arrows between creep kills, it’s important. Clinkz can very easily bully some heroes out of lane with his insane range and good damage.

- Save your skill point at level 2, you can sometimes go for a kill with Strafe. Try to deny more when you have 2 archers (as Clinkz it’s hard but not unfeasable). You should also tell your Centaur to go jungle with a Stout Shield and a RoP at this point, he is accomplishing absolutely nothing.

- At 1:49, you sit in lane with your aquila turned off while the tower is hitting creeps. In this case, you can get free potshots on the tower by manually casting Searing Arrows on it. **Manually using Searing Arrows on a tower will not make it aggro you**. That’s very important, especially with an Aquila. The sole reason for Aquila on Clinkz is to reinforce your pushing power (and the mana regen, but it’s not mandatory).

- You went for Boots right after your Aquila, which is kind of fine, but I would have taken a Sage’s mask for my medallion if I were you. Early mana regen pays dividends in spades as Clinkz, as it allows you to not run out of mana at level 4-5 or so. Especially since your clarity was canceled.

- 3:11 : Ah, the classic « Walk up in melee range as a 640 range hero to hit someone »

- 4:00 : Your centaur is dragging the creep wave all the way to the rune, which is a big troll move. But you can take advantage of it, once again, by pushing with aquila on and poking the tower. You probably can not kill them before your centaur gets his 6 so at this point don’t try to push your XP lead over the top.

- When you are hitting a tower, always use Searing Arrows.

- Your kill attempt with Strafe was a good decision, even though you missed it. You could not really foresee DK interrupting Centaur.

- You are missing free CS, and sometimes you are missing them because you are trying to harass when it’s inappropriate. A CS is always worth more than a shot on an enemy, unless he is going to die from it very soon.

- You queued Blight Stone which is once again very much oriented towards pushing, yet you tried very hard to not hit the enemy offlane tower. Just get Treads, it’s very useful at level 6 to kill the hard camp faster. That being said, you got Soul Ring before 6. Good job on that.

- 7:47 : You turned aquila on ! Fuck yeah. I love this choice because it means that you know what you need to do : push out the lane and get your 6, then rotate to the hard camp and farm it.

- 7:55 : WHY. ARE. YOU. NOT. USING. SEARING. ARROWS. ON. A. TOWER ? I swear it’s the last time I’m gonna harp on it.

- When you get Treads, get the gloves first if you are safe.

- When you are very close to level 6 (less than a creepwave away, in this case you also have to account for your Centaur leeching and helping the enemy team, so it’s harder), push the lane as much as you can so that you can get to the hard camp without losing CS.

(Speaking of which, your Centaur looks like a huge prick. Was he trying to lose ? Because in this case the game is probably unwinnable :/)

- You just hit level 6 at 8:42, and you are being immobile in lane instead of going to eat your big creep. Eat your creep then come back to the lane to push.

- At 9:00, you only ate the big creep and then went for a very questionnable invis. What were you hoping to get ? Runes don’t spawn on odd minutes, there is no way the enemy team is staying near their ancients yet, and you have a build that’s oriented towards pushing a lot before your deso to create space. Going for Aquila on Clinkz and getting a more pushing oriented build is fine, but you have to play to your strengths.

- 9:51 : Nice auto-attacks on the tower Kappa. This tower should be dead by now, and you should be trying to push their T2.

- 10:15 : Even though your team got a wipe, you made a very bad decision. You TPed directly on top of enemies without having Death Pact up. **ALWAYS** use Death Pact before each fight. It’s a mini solar crest coupled with a Midas. Use it every time you can, and especially before fights.

- 10:20 : You are farming badly for 2 reasons : first of all, you don’t have Searing Arrows on autocast. With proper tread switching, you can always use Searing Arrows on auto cast, and it’s a very good way to increase your farming speed. Secondly, you don’t eat any creep. Your ult, as I mentionned, is in a lot of ways like a Midas. Use it on every chance you get. Even if you get only a Satyr which has 500 HP, it’s a camp that’s quickly dealt with. That’s the whole reason as to why you get Soul Ring on Clinkz. What you should do instead of farming with autoattacks is : Switch to autocast on Searing Arrows, put Treads on str, Soul Ring, Treads on int, Death pact a brown ogre that’s full, then kill the rest of the camp.

- 10:54 : You don’t use Soul Ring before ulting. Because of that, you are going back to base, even though you have a free heal every 40s or so, and 3 regen items (soon to be 4). Do I need to say more ? Even without th e soul ring usage, there was absolutely no reason to go back to base at this moment if you didn’t expect a fight to happen.

- « My joke caused Clinkz to leave » ayy

- 11:40 : Your TP was a bad choice. You revealed 2 things with that : your position, and the fact that you had TP on cooldown. It was very easy for enemy heroes to check that you suddenly appeared and broke trees. For that reason, the enemy team, if they were smart, could have engaged on your team top. Instead, what you should have done was : not go back to base, farm your jungle, then push out bottom to force rotations, possibly eat a big creep from their offlane camp, and either try to push the enemy mid T1 (this tower is very important to take down btw) or TP+Skeleton Walk top (you can use invis while TPing and it won’t break channels, just like on BH)

(Your team didn’t pause for you after you paused for the enemy team… -_-)

- 14:50 : You finally made a decision between pushing and fighting and you joined the fight. First, I don’t think your team needed you, but I will give you the benefit of the doubt since you probably wanted to take a tower afterwards. Second, you didn’t push bot before, and that’s a huge mistake. This tower should have fallen 10 minutes ago at that point. With a tower down, your allies would have slightly little more farm than nothing.

- 15:30 : Manually cast Searing Arrows if you are engaging under a tower, and if you are don’t stay in melee range against a Treant.

- 16:40 : You had a very bad position when engaging. You are behind at this point, and you need 1.1k gold to finish deso. Why are you trying to engage in some sort of pointless fight mid that won’t lead to anything ? Farm deso and win 3 fights in a row afterwards. You always need to have Searing Arrows on autocast while you are farming, once again.

- 18:30 : This is tempting, but you die once again. At this point, it’s clear that your deso won’t come before 23. 

I stopped watching at 19:30. At this point I think you understood. Your Centaur was doing a lot of weird stuff and leeching your XP a lot, but you definitely made quite some mistakes during the laning phase. You didn’t go for an item build that you could play with and understand well, and you don’t use spells to farm efficiently. You are also inefficient because you waste time and you don’t kill camps completely. At low MMR, people forget that creeps exist after 15 minutes, so leaving unfinished camps will bite you in the ass when you will try to use Death pact.

TL;DR :

- Use death pact every single time it’s off cooldown

- Manually cast Searing Arrows on towers in the early game

- Always have ult on cooldown when you join a fight

- Farm effectively using Searing Arrows and Death Pact

- Don’t waste your TPs.",2016-06-30 21:44:38+00:00,d4ujsxz,2.0,t1_d4ua4di,12383.0,learndota2

1921,"Follow-up questions :

- Do you really think I would have had more impact trying to lane against their dual lane instead of killing an Invoker twice ? The reasoning for me was the exact opposite of yours : they have a hero who is pretty bad at farming on the mid lane and who relies on an XP lead, we have a great snowballer on mid (QoP), and there is absolutely no way I can do anything against the dual lane, WK will get rekt no matter what happens.

- I was thinking about Lens in this game but I ended up not getting it, because I thought I would keep my lead. Lol.

- The QoP having so little networth really blew my mind, how did that happen ? In my head, I was thinking « Ok, she died a few times, but she is a QoP and she had a lot of ganks mid so she is going to snowball off of farm+kills. » It didn’t even strike my mind that QoP could be struggling, I would have laughed at you in game if you had told me that QoP had less networth and CS than Invoker even early on.

- The smokes failing were a result of bad communication, mostly. You can see the WK popping a smoke straight after I use it at some point, and the reason I walked in first was that I realized Slardar and Axe had no blink so I had to initiate from range. What I didn’t expect, however, was that they were actually predicting my smoke movement and baiting him (or they did TP react, maybe)

I would advise you to stick to one hero you know very well and you can consistently pick first (like Lion, Queen of Pain, Slardar…) and then spam him a lot. Knowing a hero very well makes you think about the game differently. You will become a lot more precise with your thoughts, which is a way of improving.

1954,"Any hero destroys TB if TB has a bad early game. 

And I can guarantee you, PL falls off quite hard in the late game, even with the new abyssal. He needs Diffusal Blade, he is squishy, he is awful at carrying MKB, he is a pretty bad BKB hero, and his Butterfly tends to get countered by MKBs later on. Not to mention hexes demolish PL. On the other hand, even though TB is squishy, he can actually build BKB without hurting himself because it helps him getting Sunder off and right clicking people (PL disengages instead of popping BKB…), and if you lose one fight to a TB you lose the game. That’s not the case with PL, at most if he is six-slotted (and in this case, PL is probably losing because he is a mid-game centric hero) you lose 2 lanes after losing a fight against a late game PL.

My point is, many heroes actually win if you consider a 6-slotted carry vs 6-slotted carry situation vs PL, simply because PL relies on getting ahead early on, then getting a decisive lead between his diffusal timing and 30-35 minutes into the game or so. PL’s late game is nowhere as strong as you believe it is. TB doesn’t only scale better than PL, he also has a very good anti-PL spell : Reflection.

I’m not exactly sure how to buff him. Personally, I think Cloak is already extremely strong as it is now, and I hope it won’t get buffed further. His familiars are fine as well (you could add a little bit more vision to them, but it’s unnecessary). I would buff Chill’s levels 3 and 4. Right now, there is absolutely no point leveling up Chill before level 12 (past level 1 or 2), but for example you could increase the cast range on it at levels 3 and 4, steal a bit more AS/MS with levels, rescale the cooldown, or reduce the mana cost at early levels but make it bigger at later levels to mitigate that (because 100 mana for Grave Chill at level 1 is a bit too much, 90 or 80 would be better IMHO). Of course applying everything would make him OP, but one or 2 of these changes should be just fine.

A cool buff would be to allow his familiars to hit without range restriction if he uses Hurricane Pike on another hero.

1997,"&gt; As for your build I like getting blink before mek, but I can see that you want to push so I understand your reason. Blink dagger is however why I tend to skip boots.

Here is the deal though :

Enigma is essentially 2 heroes in one. In the early game, he is a very quick farmer, that gets level 6 before the mid hero, and pushes very quickly around level 7 with maxed eidolons. At this stage, eidolons are your strongest asset. You are almost a frontliner, and you are a huge threat. That’s where Enigma is at his strongest.

However, as the game goes on, this kind of playstyle becomes gradually less and less powerful, in most of your games. That’s where Enigma’s second side comes : at this stage, you need blink and BKB, and you play as a counterinitiating semi-core. Enigma, as a hero, doesn’t like this transition a lot because relying on Black Hole instead of Eidolons makes your hero a lot less reliable by himself. Black Hole has a 180 second cooldown, and even though your other cooldowns are manageable (Greaves is 45s, BKB is 1 minute or so, Pulse is 35s…) wasting Black Hole *at this stage* makes your hero useless for 3 minutes, barring some split pushing potential with eidolons.

So when you play Enigma, it’s all about this mentality of « How much can I delay Blink and still be the most useful at any point of the game ? », at least that’s what I think. Most of the time, I only need Blink at about 20 minutes in, but if you get BKB first you probably won’t have a blink by 20 mins. Which is why I prefer getting blink right after mek in general.

&gt;  It seems to me like enchantress is being moved back and forth between the jungle and offlane. Never heard of a terror blade or beast master jungler though. 

Jungling Beastmaster has been played quite a bit in these qualifiers, along with Offlane+Jungle beastmaster.

For ench you are right, but at the moment she is a lot more popular in the jungle, I believe. She is always a viable hero in the jungle in pub games.",2016-06-27 09:31:05+00:00,d4pnrtw,3.0,t1_d4pnmlw,533.0,learndota2

2000,"I assume you come from League ? I only heard LoL players talking about routes, and from what I understood there is no RNG included in League’s jungle so that’s probably why. There are not really set in stone rules as far as jungling routes and jungling speed, sometimes you will get 2 satyr camps and get to a headstart, and sometimes you will find centaurs every other minute.

First of all, jungling is, of course, not to be done every game. I play Enigma quite a lot, and sometimes other jungling heroes, and here is what I am looking for when I pick this kind of hero :

- Is our team in need of my particular hero ? (example : for enigma, ideally you want to pick it when your team lacks a mek carrier and the enemy team is weak to black hole and early pushes)

- Do we have a decent solo offlaner ? Sometimes you have a necro offlane and you need to pick a hero that’s more active during the first minutes, like Bounty Hunter.

- Are our lanes strong otherwise ? If your mid is going to be shat on, picking Winter Wyvern or Riki (for example) is going to do a lot more for your team. If your carry is an AM and you predict that your AM has a brain, and that the enemy team will do a dual lane bullshit to shut him down, pick a hero like Disruptor.

If the situation calls for it, however, definitely pick a jungler.

The most common junglers are Enigma, Chen, and Enchantress. The reason why is pretty obvious, if you look at Demonic Conversion (for Enigma), Holy Persuasion (for Chen), or Enchant (for Enchantress). Less common junglers include Axe, Legion Commander (probably the most hated jungler in the whole game, but actually legit in some situations), Lycan, Terrorblade, Beastmaster, Dark Seer, and anything that buys an Iron Talon really.

For Enigma, here is a very useful post that I had seen a few months ago about jungling (from a guy with 800+ Enigma games) : https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4jl92b/how_not_to_push/d3aa430

There are also a few videos on this. But basically, your goal is to get Soul Ring, boots, and Mek at 8 minutes, and from there push like a madman. Aim for a 15ish minute Blink dagger afterwards (in some very specific situations, you can delay blink a bit more, or not get it at all, but most of the time get it after mek). Use midnight pulse to clear trees and kill camps to accelerate your farm. Don’t let your eidolons die. I suggest you to practice it by doing 10 minute-long sessions in lobbies, and as soon as you are able to reliably have level 6 by minute 4:30 or so and mek by 8 minutes you are good to go.

Sure, he farms fast once he reaches level 6, and he pushes safely with his birds, but Beastmaster is just way more valueable than Visage at this point. Beast can actually threaten towers, not just chip away at them, he has Inner beast which is huge, and even though he puts out less damage he offers a lot to killing a single hero.

But his issues don’t stop with farm and levels.

Visage is still a very good pub hero because no one knows how to deal with him. But in competitive, he is unpickable since 6.87. There is no point picking up Visage when the enemy Sven or LS will have a shitload of armor to tank your familiars and destroy them with echo sabre (this item alone is a huge visage nerf, btw…), when the enemy offlaner is a Beastmaster or an Axe that can either ignore birds completely or offer many ways to kill them. Medusa and Terrorblade are growing in popularity and they both shit on Visage. Phoenix is a known counter to Visage and he is super popular.

2019,"&gt; The problem is right now in Dota you NEED to fight around 20 minutes if you're behind and you don't want to fight if you're ahead unless you know you'll come out ahead. That's not exactly a healthy mindset for the game

I think it’s actually fine. That’s not unique to dota, in chess for example you have a principle that says « If you are playing passively while your opponent has an advantage, you are losing the game. If you are playing actively while your opponent has an advantage, you are *probably* losing the game. »

In my post, I was specifically adressing how fighting is almost the solution to everything, and you nailed it here. Right now, in dota, you need to fight around 20 minutes if you are behind, because there is literally no other thing that lets you take less risks or have higher rewards. If you are ahead, you need to be forcing fights, because if you are trying to dominate the map and choke the enemies out, you will probably feed 2k gold in one pickoff.

&gt; You can blame that on the comeback system. Simply put it doesn't matter if you lose the laning phase just as long as you don;t get crushed there because if you can win the midgame teamfights you'll get it all back and then some. So all these pro drafts you see are all made up of hero's that either scale incredibly well or are brutally dominant early.

I agree that it was a very stupid decision to change the « rubberband gold » of 6.82 into literally « comeback gold » in 6.85 (or is it this patch, where they added the constant to the networth component that made every kill worth a lot more if you were with your team ?). 6.84 was really good in terms of playstyle IMHO, simply because you had a very good balance of split pushing carries, early game carries (even though Gyro was too strong), and late game monsters.

And I was not criticizing short games, in fact I think it’s very healthy that early game carries that are very good at taking a lead like Juggernaut, CK or PL are good. What I’m saying is that the mid game tends to be fight-heavy even for heroes like AM, who typically don’t want to fight.

2032,"- The thing is, at least at my level, I have absolutely no issue dealing with Shaker. Spirit Lance can permanently cancel blink dagger, and Shaker is bad at farming which delays his blink. PL can take over the game before that point.

- Ember : You can not cancel his flame guard with any of your abilities as long as he is level 3 or more.

- PA : PA out-DPSes a PL by far even with Spirit Lance, and she is able to burst him down very easily or force Doppelgänger because she has so much burst, and she has no trouble doing so from any distance. So even though in a vacuum you are right, my point still stands I think.

And just to clarify : I’m not underestimating Shaker badly. I’m just saying that PL has an edge against him, because if shaker’s team is not ahead by quite a margin (and shaker is notoriously bad at getting an early lead while PL is very good at it), then PL will have absolutely no issue dealing with him.

2037,"&gt; Excluding **the obvious shaker,**

What ?

PL is advantaged against Shaker… PL loves immobile heroes with very long cast animations, shaker is extremely easy to outplay as PL. I’m a PL spammer and very often I pick PL against Shaker.

PL is countered by the following things :

- Silences

- **Mobility**

- Burst

- Evasion

- Long lockdown

- Certain AoEs give him a rough time, but these are the exceptions, not the rule.

For carries, my #1 fear is **Phantom Assassin** when I pick PL. PA destroys him and it’s not even close. In the early game, Blur divides PL’s DPS by 2 against PA, which gives her a *huge* advantage when she fights PL. But above all, she has Phantom Strike which ruins your life as PL. PL hates manfighting, and heroes that force him to manfight are awful to play against (hello Axe and Legion). Honorable mentions include **Ember Spirit** (because all of his abilities are very good against PL, he is really mobile, and he is one of the rare Cleave heroes that you fear specifically because of the cleave in a late game situation because Cleave ignores armor), **Axe** (good luck getting past the laning stage against an Axe), **Terrorblade** (no way of preventing Sunder, TB has a *huge* damage advantage over PL, and he can create illusions of you), **Dark Seer** (Ion Shell wrecks you in lane, later on Wall + Vacuum destroys you), **Timbersaw** (obvious counter, Reactive Armor + huge burst are really good against PL). **Legion Commander** also deserves a mention because Duel is very strong against PL and she naturally combines with heroes that are good against PL, like Lion or Skywrath Mage.

For supports, my biggest fears are **Elder Titan** (Natural Order demolishes PL and there is nothing you can do about it, at any stage of the game), **Disruptor** (against a good disruptor, you are forced to use Doppel for Glimpse, which is awful), and to a lesser extent **Sand King**.

Worthwhile mentions of heroes that give PL a hard time include Zeus, QoP, Anti-Mage, Skywrath Mage, Lion, Enigma, Pugna or Ench *if picked in a push strat*, Silencer, and Tidehunter. Tiny can also sometimes be tricky to play against, but usually he is not much of an issue if you can avoid being comboed at the start of fights. Consider getting BKB against Tiny.

But PL mid is very fun, it’s definitely a hero you can pick up in a lot of games. He also is misunderstood by a lot of people, and very often you will see teams going for stupid stuff like Sven+Earthshaker to counter you instead of getting actual counters like PA or Disruptor.

2051,"I would say there are mainly 2 points of picking Naga support :

- Song of the Siren is a great disengaging spell, and it’s useful to set up delayed spells like Kinetic Field or Black hole before blink dagger

- You can stack 4 camps at once in the jungle.

If you make use of either of these points well, you can justify a Naga pick for a support role. The thing is, heroes like SF don’t clear stacks as early and as quickly as before, so it’s an indirect nerf to naga. Sure, you can justify it if you have something like TA-Bristle-Sven, but in this case you are vulnerable to a riki roaming on your face. The alternative is to play Naga as a core, or to transition into one, and it’s surprisingly viable.

The other thing that makes Naga support hard to pick is that Song of the Siren is extremely overkill, most of the time. It’s a very long cooldown until level 11, it’s extremely easy to fuck up your team’s spells (obviously it applies a lot less to pro games), and a spell like False Promise or Midnight Pulse does almost as much. So there is even less point in picking Naga. The other problem with Song is that it doesn’t go through magic immunity. *Oh master, behold all these lives for the taking.*

If you want to play Naga as a support, I would advise building her almost like a core : Max rip tide first (not mirror image, a nuke is more useful for a support naga), then illusions, then net (and don’t go for stats, unlike on a core Naga). For items, you could either transition to a core and go for Arcanes-Raindrops-PMS-Radiance-Octa-Manta… or play it like an actual support and go for Arcanes + Raindrops, then aura items (Vlad’s is pretty good), Agh’s, Refresher, and Abyssal Blade (if you need to stun someone in particular on the enemy team).",2016-06-22 22:29:29+00:00,d4k1006,1.0,t3_4pcygt,5878.0,learndota2

2056,"Oh, okay. I get your point, but I don’t think Bloodthorn would be useful in this situation because MKB is amazing on Clinkz and MKB is better in every way for True Strike and damage. The real value in Bloodthorn is that you get True Strike on summons, and on your allies, and Clinkz does so much damage by himself that hampering your own damage for your own allies would not do any good to you I think.

Besides, going Orchid on Clinkz is questionable most of the time. The normal build is better than the orchid build, unless you don’t need to push, the enemy team has squishy cores that don’t build BKB or Ghost Scepter until late, and you are not your team’s main carry.

2060,"&gt; She is very slow, she has low attack damage and thus can't harass well, her starting mana and hp are very low.

That’s why she is not played as a babysitter, but rather in the jungle.

&gt; her starting mana and hp are very low.

Her base int used to be a lot higher, but she was a bit too strong so it got nerfed. There is a reason why CM has low stats, and on top of that she farms the jungle quite well with clarities to mitigate that.

&gt; third is **a shit aura that gives low mana regen.**

Can’t tell if trolling or just bad at math. Compare it to a basi and you will see how amazing arcane aura is.

&gt; But to cast ultimate you need to: 1. Get close(good luck with that). 2. Don't get stunned/silenced/killed/hexed. 3. Get a decent position. 4. Get mana for your R somewhere. 5. Try to survive for AT LEAST 2 seconds. 

That’s why you wait for spells to be on cooldown to cast it, that’s why you don’t skill it at the standard 6/11/16 usually, and that’s why you get items like BKB, Ghost, Force Staff, Aether Lens, or Glimmer Cape (if they have no AoE stun or silence like Smokescreen or Ice Path).

&gt; This hero does NOTHING in the game. Lion, Jakiro, SS, Rubick are doing everything CM does, and they do it better.

Yeah because Lion, Jakiro, SS, and Rubick are known for their ability to jungle and smoke gank at level 3 around 2 minutes into the game, then smoke gank mid at 6 minutes when the first wards run out, get level 8 or so at 10 minutes, while giving mana to allies globally. And then, just like CM, they have an amazing ult for mid game teamfights or pickoffs, that slows in a huge AoE and does a large amount of damage, on a 90 seconds cooldown.",2016-06-22 12:05:53+00:00,d4j9fwd,1.0,t3_4pa8nz,958.0,learndota2

2063,"Here are some obvious mistakes that I noticed from your last games :

- You should not build PL the way you are doing 99% of your games, use the Agressif build or the Vanguard build and take stats

- 23 last hits in a 49 minute long game as CM ?????? That’s what you should have about 6 minutes in. CM is a jungler, go watch the Purge replay coaching video of a 2k CM, he explains well how to go through the early game as CM.

- 106 last hits in 41 minutes as Spectre…

- 131 last hits in 1:31 as Pugna (!!!), and Pugna support is extremely situational to say the least. I don’t think you play Pugna well enough to be decent at supporting with him, running unconventional heroes on a support role takes a lot of skill to perform well. Also 22 deaths.

- 16 last hits and 13 deaths in 40 minutes as Earthshaker. First of all, you should build Soul Ring+Tranquils 90% of the time as Shaker, so that you can spam fissure on creep waves and creep camps to farm. Second, you can stack a camp repeatedly and use your first Echo Slam on it to farm your blink in the early game.

I think the best advice I could give you is « stop running around doing nothing » because I notice a very consistent lack of farm and high deaths. This is **especially** true as a support. Being a support is not an excuse for feeding.

Stop playing supports, play one core that you enjoy and you can win games with reliably for about 100 games. Then learn to watch your map, optimize farm, abuse enemy TPs, etc. Then you will climb MMR in no time. If you want to play PL, I can coach you or give you advice. I’m a PL spammer (82 games, 62% winrate) and I like this hero a lot.",2016-06-22 09:53:11+00:00,d4j6q96,1.0,t3_4p9ser,2008.0,learndota2

Sure, a silence is something, but compared to Orchid it’s very cost-inefficient, and in the late game Hex is a lot better than Orchid if you want a disable. But Hex doesn’t remove evasion anymore ! So that’s Bloodthorn’s niche, IMHO.

I would get Bloodthorn when you don’t carry MKB very well, **and** your team doesn’t carry MKB well, **and** you are an Orchid carrier. For example, on a QoP, OD or a Storm, when your main carry is Slark or PL (very bad MKB holders), maybe with a Visage on your team (Visage gets rekt by evasion), even with a Beastmaster, when the enemy team has stuff like Windranger.

- Classic build : Chill - SA - SA - Cloak - SA - Ult - SA - Cloak 3 times - Ult - Chill 3 times - Stats - Ult.

In pubs I prefer the classic build. The main argument behind Aui’s build is that 4 seconds of slow allow your birds to do full damage and level 2 chill is a decent value point. But Visage’s build is rather static. You always max SA first and take Ult whenever you can, and you always max Cloak before Chill because Chill’s scaling is bad.

Since it would be possible to divide up humanity into radically different groupings using blood typing instead of other genetically inherited traits such as skin color, we have more conclusive evidence that the commonly used typological model for understanding human variation is scientifically unsound.

It would make sense as well, since skin color and all is a result of adaptation but blood type should not be affected by it.",2016-06-17 13:55:50+00:00,d4d0f14,1.0,t3_4oj2ed,3922.0,dataisbeautiful

2138,"You play CM a bit like you would play Enchantress, although you have weaker push and more disables. Start off in the jungle, buy couriers, smokes, clarities and whatever you want or your team needs. Then jungle starting with the hard camp close to your base. Once you get level 2, you have 2 options. Either take a point into Nova and smoke gank (kind of risky, don’t do it if you are not comfortable on the hero and you don’t trust your ability to gank), or take a point into arcane aura. At level 3 you normally get a 1-1-1, *sometimes* 0-1-2 if your whole team really loves arcane aura (eg you have a Clock offlane, a Shadow demon as your second support, and a Clinkz…). Keep farming the jungle and gank when necessary. Try to gank the enemy mid lane or safe lane at least once more before minute 10. Pro tip : wards expire around 6 minutes, and it’s night time at 6 minutes so you don’t need to smoke for a gank if you do it at that time. Try to help your team secure towers. CM is awful at pushing but she can enable pushes quite well. As you transition into the mid game, you should have at least upgraded boots + the equivalent of a 2000g item if it went decently. Buy wards because you are pretty rich for a support and try to force advantageous fights around freezing fields. Farm the jungle during your downtime.

I talked about skill builds, so here are the item builds I get :

- Arcanes into Aether Lens into Force/Agh’s/Ghost… I originally did this for a quest (buy arcanes before minute X) but I found this build surprisingly effective. Aether Lens solves a lot of your mana pool issues early on, and the HP regen is super nice for after ganks where you needed to tank tower shots or after fights. Lens makes Frostbite actually have some range, and it makes Nova almost as effective as an Atos to catch up to someone from far away.

- Tranquils into Force : Very standard build. Especially good against Riki, if Riki was dumb enough to not contest your jungle.

- Tranquils into Agh’s : Kind of greedy, but very useful if you have Void on your team for example.

- Tranquils into Ghost Scepter : If you are behind and desperately are looking for a way to deal with this pesky Ursa.",2016-06-16 11:55:31+00:00,d4bgi28,4.0,t1_d4bfwxz,1456.0,DotA2
2139,"- Jungling CM and leaving carry solo : yes, he is absolutely right. What would CM do in a dual lane ? If it’s not a jugg-CM lane against someone with no escape, CM would just feed.

- Rushing midas : It can work, since CM needs levels. Not every game, obviously.

- Farming stacked camps with ult : It’s actually a good thing since Freezing Field has a very low cooldown now. Usually when I’m on Dire I stack the 2 medium camps at once with nova, then I use my first ult to clear both camps (I aggro the camp close to the rune, then go in trees and ult). That’s a good way to accelerate your farm, and you can follow up with a few ganks to have a Force Staff or something.

- Leaving no farm in jungle : So you are telling me that he is even quicker at jungling than an Enigma ? Can you show me a replay of his ? I would like to see it.

- Being useless until 30 minutes : CM can gank very easily at level 2 or 3, and as CM you should always buy at the very least 1 smoke at the start of the game. I usually try ganking the mid lane twice during the first 2 minutes, if they don’t have something like Mirana, Slark or QoP there. The purpose of any jungler is to help out your lanes anyway.

2170,"PL lore for a tutorial ! I messaged d2imba with a few ideas, but I will just copy paste them here :

I was thinking of creating a tutorial using PL’s lore. For me, his lore would be perfect to learn the game ; I had thought of a progression like this :

- First scenario : very basic, you are spear fishing a bit. Teaches about moving, watching the minimap, and right clicking (also spell usage for fishing)

- Second scenario : One which involves some kind of fight (maybe fight outlaws right outside Azwraith’s village ?). It would include watching your HP, maybe using spirit lance or another spell during a fight.

- Third scenario : Azwraith got requested in a war against a powerful mage (as the lore says). The first battle of this war would be the defense of a fort : it would involve placing wards to see where the enemies will attack, watching the minimap again, and using teleport scrolls/boots of travel. There could also be some introduction on uphill miss chance and the importance of seeing your enemies. In this scenario, you could have Spirit Lance, Phantom Rush, and some sort of blink back (since you are not supposed to have illusions yet)

- Fourth scenario : Fight against some creations of the mage. This scenario could be a way to teach people how to use diffusal blade (for example, some monsters could have a double damage or haste buff that you would remove with diffu, or you could use diffu to prevent an enemy from surging away). It would also be a training to dodge spells and predict them.

- Fifth scenario : A mission where you sneak behind enemy lines (to open a gate leading to the mage’s tower, for example ?). It would be an introduction to smokes, dewarding, and abusing enemy vision. The idea, once again, is to have the feel of a different game but explain principles that are true in dota as well.

- Sixth scenario : Assaulting the mage’s fortress. It could be an introduction to split pushing : you could distract the mage’s forces by sending an army in plain enemy sight while you plan an attack elsewhere. It can also be an introduction to Boots of Travel, and you could make this scenario very much focused on creating chaos, just like what you do on PL in real dota games (I hope it makes sense).

- Seventh scenario : Fighting the mage. I was thinking of using this scenario to introduce the player to disjointing projectiles with doppelgänger (or its equivalent, since he can not have illusions until he kills the mage), and maybe introducing the player to BKB or Abyssal blade ? Anyway, the idea would be that Azwraith kind of has to abuse his mobility advantage ; the mage would be relatively slow and have no gap closer, and only ground targeted spells.

Of course this is subject to change, but that was a rough idea. What do you think ?",2016-06-15 06:56:23+00:00,d49w53e,1.0,t3_4o52c1,17003.0,DotA2

- Effective warding

- Utility and Mobility

Visage only provides utility and that’s only if you build Mek or Force on him. Visage’s strength is that he simply dishes a lot of damage. Soul Assumption is the highest damage/cooldown ratio for any nuke in the game (if you don’t count things like Agh’s Life Drain and Infernal Blade on a 5k HP hero), and it provides a sustained 100 magic damage per second on average. Your birds do 600 damage with 8 auto-attacks before reductions at level 6, and at level 16 with Agh’s they do 2000 physical damage.

2200,"So first of all, don’t pick Dusa against OD+Invoker.

But that being said, here is the answer to your actual question :

On Dusa, you want either Treads or Phase for your boots, depending on player preference. I prefer Treads because with int Treads you are very survivable, you have more EHP than with str Treads and you can cast snake, then quickly toggle to agi, then receive the snake and toggle to int. Your two early game items are **Aquila and Mask of Madness**. Don’t get Perseverance or any of this bullshit, MoM is enough for your sustain. You can consider getting stuff like Drums, Diffusal or Dlance though. After that, you have 2 possible paths depending on the state of the game :

- You are ahead : in this case, get survivability. You want **Skadi**, then optionally a casual **talisman of evasion** (depends on how well enemies carry MKB), then either MKB, BKB, Daedalus, or Rapier. Try to have a significant advantage by the time you have your next item after Skadi.

- You are behind : in this case, get damage. After MoM, **go straight BKB + Rapier, and try to have both at the same time**. Then get stuff like MKB, more rapiers…

The reason why you need damage if you are behind is because it will make the difference between getting a kill or not. If you are ahead you don’t need that much damage because it won’t make a big difference with kills, but building survivability allows you to not let go off your lead easily. It’s a rule that can be applied to anyone, but you feel it much more on Dusa.

Don’t forget that there is no such thing as getting Rapier too early on Dusa, if you get it after your MoM. However, I lost many games because I tried to get a Rapier too late. So don’t be afraid to build rapiers quickly, it will win you games.

Now, on your itemization in this particular game :

- Manta : If you do some basic maths you will very quickly understand how worthless this item is on Dusa. Don’t get it if you want to win. The active actually nukes you and your illusions don’t do shit because Dusa has terrible base damage and illusions don’t have Mana Shield.

- Linken’s : At best debatable. Yes, it stops Invoker from Euling you to mana burn you, but BKB would do a much better job at turning Invo’s ganks around. There is no reason for you to get Linken’s in this game, really. Dusa doesn’t care about being doomed because she is beefy as all hells and even if it prevents your ult it’s much better to have you doomed than anyone on your team. Legion never wants to duel a Dusa, Dusa is the worst duel target in the game because she likes standing still and she attacks legion and her team during duel.

- MKB : It’s okay in this case (except for some reason Luna didn’t have a Bfly ??? But it’s still good vs Luna because she will normally get one).

- Butterfly : It’s not efficient, only get it if you are ahead and you want the evasion. I suppose you were such in a good spot that it was okay, but don’t build it every game for sure.

And my biggest pet peeve in your items by far is that you had no rapier. Medusa is the only hero in the game on which Rapier is core.

I usually build Arcanes into Mek into Greaves on him, no matter my position (as a support I play him in quite a greedy way). Sometimes I get medallion but often I don’t. Then I get Agh’s and luxury items include Atos (very good if you are ahead, this item gives you a huge initiation range), AC, Pipe, and I consider stuff like Deso (if I’m roflstomping), or Force Staff (if behind). On mid Visage, I think you would still build these items, but you can also consider stuff like Dagon or Midas (lets you get a very quick level 16).

I don’t think Visage is a very good ganker, which is also why I don’t build Medallion often on him. Sure he has a lot of burst, but it’s very easy to see him coming and chill’s cast range is low. He is great at assisting ganks but in this case very often you don’t need medallion because your burst is already enormous. I would probably buy a Medallion if I were behind and we had catch. But Visage is bad at playing from behind anyway.

2204,"Visage player here (around 80 games, 60% winrate).

There are 2 things that struck me with these changes :

- Cloak is no longer the worst level 1 spell in the game, which means visage is slightly less level-dependant. He can do a lot of stuff by level 7. Don’t forget however that Visage needs levels very early to be useful so it’s not like he became a viable 5 now.

- These changes look good but they don’t solve any of Visage’s problems atm. He was quite bad in 6.87 because Lifestealer, Riki, Sven, Phoenix, Vanguard, Armlet, etc. Visage was not bad balance-wise but he was completely out of meta - what’s the point of picking Visage when no enemy hero is burstable because they have 1741394 armor and HP and other heroes push better than him and are not as risky (hello Enigma, and many others).

That being said, this change pushes Visage closer and closer to being a viable core. At the moment, he is probably still best played in dual lanes with a hero that takes advantage of Grave Chill or with Lycan/Drow. The first thing that came to my mind with these changes is actually iron talon jungling, since you would have 8 armor at level 1 with talon. I’m not sure how well it would work, I need to try it in a lobby. But I think Visage as an offlaner is viable in pubs more than it has ever been, and he will be played as an offlaner when he comes back in pro games.",2016-06-13 12:40:15+00:00,d477y9u,1.0,t3_4nulhx,18320.0,learndota2

2279,"I have a few explanations for this.

First of all, Visage is conceptually very strong, but there are a lot of key weaknesses to the hero :

- HEAVILY level-dependant, and unlike Enigma or Ench he can not farm the jungle early, so creates weaknesses in your mid lane and your offlane

- Actually not very good in lane because his base armor sucks and while Chill is a good trading spell, Cloak also is the worst level 1 skill in the game. A visage at level 4 with 1 point in Cloak barely has 25% magic resistance and 5 armor with a full cloak.

- Immobile because his birds can not join him after he TP’s

- Immobile because if he buys Force/Blink it won’t make his birds come with him

- Conceptually countered by a lot of heroes because the best counter to visage is to not give a fuck about him and go on him, then finish him off with nukes, or have a way to ignore birds. Examples of heroes that Visage hate are Phoenix (picked a lot in this major, btw), Treant, anything that builds Vanguard, Sven, Bristleback, Terrorblade, Templar Assassin (in a way), Axe, Viper with tanky items, Phantom Assassin (evasion + blink strike), PL, Medusa, Puck and many more. Most of the heroes that shit on Visage are very popular atm, Phoenix being the big name but not the only one.

The other thing is that Visage isn’t popular because of the way the game is played atm.

Visage is not a support, as in he is not exactly what people think of a support. When you think of a support, you think about map presence, effective warding, sneakiness, and utility. Visage offers none of that (unless you build Mek/Force, then he has some utility). Visage’s strength is that he bursts down heroes very quickly with mixed physical and magical damage, and in fights he provides 400 magic damage every 4 seconds, which is the highest damage/cooldown ratio of any nuke in the game (if you don’t count stuff like Life Drain or Flamebreak with 10 napalm charges). He is a fake core, and he is played like a siege tank that fires a big shot every 4 seconds and doesn’t die because he has Cloak, Agh’s, Greaves and all. Moreover, the way he is played after the laning phase is not suited to the meta at all. Visage tends to stay in lane for a very long time and slowly push the T1 while getting farm after his carry leaves, and that’s not what a support wants to do nowadays.

Also, Vanguard got buffed (which is an extremely hard nerf to Visage, Vanguard conceptually destroys the hero), Infused Raindrops were added, Buckler is more powerful than ever, Echo Sabre got added, Atos’s accuracy was removed, Force Staff was buffed and Visage is one of the only supports that almost never buys Force, and last but certainly not least Medallion/Crest were nerfed against Roshan and roshing potential is also a big strength of the hero.

You can still win pub games with him in 6.87, don’t get me wrong. Visage is my second favorite hero after PL, and I will keep playing him even if he is dumpstered to oblivion. But he has quite some issues in this patch because he is out of place.",2016-06-08 12:30:13+00:00,d40rw6f,3.0,t1_d40re50,1051.0,learndota2

2283,"Your familiars are pretty straightforward to use but they have many ways of being used.

- After level 6, use them to camp a lane and push it slowly to farm while you stay safe. For example Aui_2000 did that a lot at TI when he played visage. His carry would leave the lane to get him quick levels and farm and he would just stay here for 10+ minutes farming and pushing the T1.

- Scout rosh with them. Pretty obvious, you use it as you would use a Clock rocket or a summon.

- Dewarding with them when you have gem : Don’t forget that they have flying vision !

- Bursting stuff down : You asked specifically for that, but I think it’s not as difficult as you think it is. You will in general start fights with all of your damage charges, but if you don’t, your first priority is to stomp as many enemies as you can. In any case, use your damage as quickly as you can with them. In general it’s worth it to use your damage charges on the enemy Huskar instead of waiting 7s or more to burst this poor CM down. Remember that in general, you will use 2 rounds of damage each fight, 3 or 4 if you resummon or if it’s very prolonged. In all cases, your first priority is that your children don’t die. They feed a lot of gold and having no birds as Visage is like having no Dragon form as DK. You are doing something, but clearly, you are not nearly as much as with your ult. That being said, if you have resummon and if you know you are careful enough and won’t feed them, don’t be afraid to scout with familiars. The only thing to be wary of is not to feed them.

Oh and it’s okay to « waste » your charges by hitting a pugna ward or a tombstone, especially since tombstone kills Visage birds (which doesn’t make any sense, how can zombies which can only crawl on the ground attack flying units ?

Second, yeah the hero is a lot different after 20 minutes. Basically, your best spells in the early game are Tombstone, Decay, and in a way Flesh Golem. But in the mid-to late game, you have essentially 2 spells : Soul Rip and Agh’s Decay (don’t bother casting Decay if you have low mana and no agh’s, just save up for a Soul Rip).

The thing with Undying is that you really want to demolish the enemy team when you are level 3-5 because his huge advantage is that his ultimate is actually Tombstone (if that makes sense) so he spikes way earlier than pretty much anyone. Cut waves with Tomb by placing it beneath towers and take towers very early with your team, then transition that into a win.

But manta is also great when completed : Illusions benefit from her high agi gain, they don’t have the bonus damage from Blessing themselves but they give it to allies, and they have Moon Glaives which makes them extremely good at pushing. Unlike a Manta on Medusa for example, there is no real downside to having a Manta either.

- Between 2.5k and 3k, everyone wants to play cores and everyone sucks at supporting (it’s at the point where supports stay in lane behind their carry…).

It’s normal that you fall off quickly with an orchid, it’s the way this build works. If you want to achieve more consistency and win more games, switch to the normal build instead of building orchid. It goes as follows :

You don’t need to take so many risks by buying an Orchid, you can instead buy an item that lets you push, teamfight and kill supports easily instead of an item that’s only useful to pick off squishy heroes.

That’s what I thought too. I mean 90 seconds would be probably okay.

Of course he is not extremely tanky. But Visage tends to get a lot of survivability items (either Tranquils+Medallion or Arcanes+Mek, then Agh’s…), so cloak adds up to that. You are not a centaur, but it’s something. He also has a high str gain for an int hero.

&gt; He is in an ""OK"" place in 5k+ (mostly due to push strats) or aggro trilane into push. Still extremely situational in pro matches.

Definitely, but I believe his best place is in an agressive dual lane. In pro matches, he is unpicked simply because a lot of heroes that shit on him get picked often (something something phoenix). He has some problems, but he is not as underpowered as stats make it look. And his winrate is probably low simply due to the hero needing practice to play well and being misunderstood. Spectre has more than 55% winrate, yet she is not OP. Elder Titan sits at an impressive 60% winrate, yet he is not OP eiher. At the same time, QoP is at 45% and I would argue QoP is fine atm.

I think your idea is interesting and would probably not be bad, but I don’t think Visage needs a big buff at all. At most, he needs a meta change, IMHO.

2379,"&gt; How to carry with PL and Ench

&gt; carry ench

Wat

Anyway, here is a bit of advice to PL since he is my most played hero. Here is my record on him : http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?hero=phantom-lancer

First of all, you need to understand that PL is a hero that’s all about chaos and confusion. While heroes like Ench are missile launchers, heroes like Visage or Huskar are siege tanks, PL is a parachutist division. You are meant to strike where your enemy doesn’t expect it, then retreat, then rinse and repeat. Your playstyle is a bit similar to Slark’s, expect you have different peaks, you push easily compared to a Slark, and you don’t have HP regen or invis.

That being said, if you want to *win games* as PL, try to avoid the following heroes :

- Ember Spirit

- A competent Storm Spirit

- Terrorblade

- Zeus

- Tide (to an extent, Tide is playable against but annoying)

- Bristleback

- Axe (good luck getting past the laning stage against this fucker)

- **Phantom Assassin**

- Lion

- Phoenix

- A competent Tiny

- Disruptor

- **Elder Titan** (he is by far the best support against PL)

- Silencer + burst heroes

- Skywrath Mage

- Anti-Mage

- Legion commander (you hate long lockdowns)

- Doom (see LC)

- To a lesser extent, Sand King

Try to pick PL into immobile heroes that can not really do anything about you. Bonus points if they have no AoE. Here is a short list :

- Treant Protector

- Visage

- Earthshaker (probably the easiest hero to outplay as PL, very long cast animations, long cooldowns except on enchant totem which is telegraphed, and no mobility until at least blink. Also low mana pool)

- Enchantress

- Witch Doctor

- Bounty Hunter

- Clinkz (no way of killing you)

- Templar Assassin (mobile, but you don’t really care about TA and you can dodge meld strikes)

- Dragon Knight (be careful of Dragon Tail though)

- Slark

- Wraith King

- Medusa (very, very immobile, and weak to mana burn)

For playstyle it’s very simple. In general, go safe lane. Get a stout shield in your starting items, also get regen.

- Skill build : Doppel/Lance - Doppel/Lance - Lance - Hold your skill point to skill rush when needed - Lance - Hold your skill point and take ult when you are pushing - Lance - 3×stats - Max doppel second, take ult at 11 and 16 and rush last. Add stats whenever you need.

- Item build : Vanguard, BoTs and Diffusal are your early game items. In general, I get boots -&gt; vanguard -&gt; bots -&gt; diffu (take a vanguard as early as you can, it’s great on PL) but if you very specifically need diffusal you could get it before bots. The harder your lane is, the earlier you want vanguard. Add raindrops or basi for mana regen depending on your needs (don’t do it if you have many arcanes or a CM on your team).

In the early game you play in a quite straightforward way. Try to avoid using doppel agressively when you start playing him, it has a huge cooldown at level 1.

**Mid game** : Your plan is simple : you need to be the biggest nuisance the enemy team ever had. Split push whenever you can, force rotations, use BoTs to go to another lane. BoTs have a lower cooldown than TP scrolls so abuse that. If you see your team taking part in a 2v2 or 3v3 fight, you should very often join them. PL works best in skirmishes because he is less burstable during these kind of fights compared to full teamfights. If your team is pushing as 4, you can consider being with them but most of the time you need to be split pushing and BoTing to them when you need. Try to jump on supports, preferably those who have a spell to use for you (looking at you, Earthshaker). When in danger, doppel out.

Mid game items : Manta, Skadi, Heart, Ablade, Linken’s (against Legion Commander or Doom), BKB (super situational), Bfly (very good against heroes that hate MKB like AM or Slark).

**Late game** : So first of all, you don’t really want to go late as PL, he is not a very hard carry and he needs diffu which lowers his late game potential. He drops just like AM or Slark do in the late game, because he can no longer kill supports easily without being punished. That being said, in the late game, your best bet is to split fights as much as you can. The enemy team is pushing your rax ? Flank them and initiate along with your team. Your team is pushing rax ? Push another lane of rax and be ready to rush in. As always, target supports and heroes that are meant to counter you first. Try to stay away from your team when you are disengaging to not be caught.

Late game items : BoTs 2, moon shard, hex, BKB.",2016-06-01 12:19:32+00:00,d3rmfu9,1.0,t3_4lzftx,29162.0,learndota2

2397,"I would advise you the following :

- Start up bot games in medium difficulty, pick Anti-Mage and try to win as much as you can. When you can reliably win against medium bots with at least about 800 GPM per game, switch to hard bots, and then unfair. When you win against unfair bots you are ready to face real players.

- Go play Anti-Mage in real games. You will probably lose your first 20 games, but AM becomes easy once you lost quite a bit with him and you will start to win a lot of games afterwards.

I recommend Anti-Mage because he is probably the best carry to learn the role with. Using him, you will learn :

- How to farm efficiently

- How to deal with hard lanes (pro tip : in case of a hard lane, get vanguard first, then treads, then BF)

- How to apply pressure at any given time

- How to farm agressively, cut waves, steal the enemy jungle

- AM is squishy so you will learn when you should not blink in in fights

- Checking the enemy mana and spell usage, which will make you a better teamfighter overall. Also, map awareness is absolutely crucial on this hero, as you will find out.

- AM peaks around 35-45 minutes when he is 6-slotted and the others are not, then he quickly falls off. You will learn how to abuse peaks and timings.

I can give you tips on how to play carry otherwise if you want. But I think this would be a good start. Don’t forget to hit towers when you play carry, don’t take defensive farm if you can avoid it (let your team have it if you can), fight when you are absolutely needed.",2016-06-01 08:01:41+00:00,d3rhjfo,1.0,t3_4lzrg3,7945.0,learndota2

2402,"Your first big mistake as PL is to go for Treads instead of BoTs, and that’s why you had this problem of « should I fight or should I keep farming ». In fact, you can do both as PL if you think about the consequences of your actions. Also you have no vanguard which is a huge mistake IMHO. It’s not a surprise that you got outfarmed, your build is only suited for taking advantageous skirmishes/pickoffs and it doesn’t let you do anything else (no regen, no bots so no split push potential…). Sure PL vs spectre is not a fun matchup for the PL, but you could completely have won this game.

But let’s see this problem more generally. In general, **as a carry, you are obligated to take the decisions most likely to win your team the game**. What does that mean ? Let’s see a few scenarios.

- You are playing Anti-Mage. You had a good start, with a 17ish minute Treads+Vanguard+BF (it’s high for 3k and less, since dual lanes are so common). You are pushing the dire T2 (you are on radiant). The enemy team is 5-manning your tower. Your team is disruptor-zeus-bristle-lc and the enemy team went for a wombo combo draft with enig+tide+anything really. 3 of the enemies have TPs. In this case, a few things may happen. If you force out a TP and then kill the lone defender, that’s absolutely the best situation. Your team will be 4v4, with a way higher chance of winning fights, and you can always TP in. If you force out a TP, but blink out to safety and keep farming, it’s a win for you. Remember, anytime you are making the opponent play defensively, you win. Just like in chess. If you TP in and don’t get anything out of it, it’s quite bad because it means you wasted a lot of time, you are not pressuring (which you should always do on AM, he is meant to take agressive farm) and you lost gold as a result for you and your team. If you had instead farmed the whole enemy jungle you would have had 600 gold. Add in another wave or an ancient camp + the TP’s cost, and that’s almost 1000 gold that you virtually lost.

- You are playing PL, a hero that’s all about creating chaos, splitting the enemy team, and taking advantageous fights. You have BoTs+Vanguard+Diffu at 25 minutes, pushing dire bot T2 again while your team is getting ready to fight at the mid tower. What do you do ? In this case, it depends on the enemy lineup a lot. If you TP, you could sometimes score 2 kills or more for your team depending on how far ahead you are, how bad enemy coordination is, etc. Let’s say your team has no disruptor, no blink or no way to catch up to a fleeing enemy and you forced a TP or 2 to the bot T2. In this case, you won’t gain anything by joining your team, these kills are not happening. The smart decision is to TP to the top lane, which is possible because you have BoTs like a smart player. This way you keep farming just as quickly as before, your team is gaining ground, your team lost nothing from you farming since you were farming agressively, and you forced the enemy team to take bad decisions, therefore making you more likely to win the game.

I could go on and on. But basically, think of dota as a strategy game. And for the love of anything that’s holy, stop going for this « I hate HP regen and tankyness » build. Get BoTs+Vanguard+Diffu. It will win you a lot more games, and it just suits PL a lot more. PL is made to create confusion and pick apart enemy heroes, BoTs is what truly allows it.

2406,"What would you say is blatantly wrong in my last matches ? http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906

Other than that, a few more specific questions.

- How many games did you take to learn Storm or Invoker ? What are the biggest noob traps on these heroes ?

- What’s your item build on Ember or SF now ?

- How do you play if you have a Lesh vs Windranger matchup where both would get tangoes+null at the beginning of the game ? From my last game.

- A few questions about AM since he is one of my most played heroes :

1. Do you get Vlad’s at all ? I just go for Vanguard instead, in this patch. That’s because you can bully anyone without any consequence with just vanguard + brown boots, then vanguard + treads allows to farm the wave + the jungle, and the only disadvantages I found in Vanguard are that you can not solo rosh and you push *slightly* less quickly (but almost as quickly because you can tank more tower shots to let your creeps survive as they hit the tower), but in turn you get a lot more EHP because of high natural agi gain + spell shield. I usually get Vanguard even before boots since I find myself in very hard lanes most of the time (fuck off axe and these bullshit agressive dual lanes).

2. How much do you value farming the enemy jungle vs cutting creep waves, split pushing, or farming ancients ?

3. How do you abuse pulls in the early game to get the most value out of a lane if by some miracle the enemy offlaner leaves ? I usually push out then take out the hard camp beside the lane at around X:15-30 to let it respawn but I usually miss one lane creep in the meantime.

4. How do you start your farming rotations when you have Treads-Vanguard-BF and you just got BF delivered on your safe lane ? I usually just push the tower then retreat to my jungle (when I force TPs or when the tower falls) then slowly move to mid as I clear it, then push mid out, etc, but maybe I’m being inefficient.",2016-05-31 11:52:32+00:00,d3q9pro,1.0,t3_4ltrp9,21345.0,learndota2

For 4k gold, you can have a SnY (which is not very good now, but it used to be okay), you can have a BKB + some leftover gold, you can have a Crest + leftover gold (and Crest gives you actually a huge load of survivability), you can have a Soul Booster if you are up against Nyx (survivability item) + 1000 gold, you can have Mask of Madness + ulti orb for your Skadi, 2 ulti orbs for a skadi, or you can have 2/3 of a rapier. I literally never saw any situation in which Manta was a better pickup than these items. In fact, many times when I saw dusas going for Manta, it ended up losing them fights because they could not ult after using their Manta (in particular, I remember a game where Fnatic.MuShi got a Manta and lost a fight because he could not ult, then they lost rax because of it and eventually lost the game).",2016-05-30 15:53:53+00:00,d3p8v34,10.0,t1_d3p8fqa,707.0,DotA2

Instead, pick heroes that have burst damage, mobility, mana burn, heavy split push, or a way to stop slark from moving (ember, queen of pain, PA, PL, bloodseeker, AM, Spectre, Naga, and many more).

2426,"&gt; No, the point of the discussion is the viability of Manta on Medusa, which is 100%

Yeah, 100% no.

&gt; Manta gives you permanent MS, as well as damage and attack speed, and also **allows you to clear 2-&gt;3 different camps/waves at once. **

That is wrong. First of all, Manta illus don’t clear camps that are not medium camps satyrs until you have manta+skadi+another item and a lot of levels. They can last hit if you micro them, but with a MoM you will just clear through a camp quickly, then come to the lane, snake it, then back to the jungle very rapidly. Mask of madness costs half of a manta yet it increases farming speed by just as much as a Manta. It gives sustain through lifesteal which dusa needs. It’s also not mana intensive, as opposed as Manta which makes you unable to fight early. So overall a very risky pickup.

&gt; Not to mention Manta also has defensive purposes, while MoM does not.

If you are a god who can avoid every laguna blade with Manta, yeah you can count it as a defensive item. Otherwise its heavy mana cost will kill you a lot more than Mask of Madness ever would.

Test it in game and you will see. I play a lot of dusa myself, and I had a very shitty winrate (30% or so ?) with an average of around 400-500 GPM. Then I realized that my build actually sucked ass, removed Manta, added MoM, and now my winrate is around 58% with dusa, with around 600 GPM average (and that’s counting losses where I ended up 3-14 because there was AM+OD+Nyx on the enemy team).",2016-05-30 15:07:02+00:00,d3p77o9,8.0,t1_d3p6w91,567.0,DotA2

What do you buy on Bane after your early game items ? Usually I go for stuff like Agh’s + BKB or Glimmer (Glimmer if they have no AoE stun) after going for either tranquils+soul ring or arcanes. How do you approach fights with him ? One of my biggest issues with Bane is that very often I’m too scared to nightmare someone so I just ult and glimmer the closest target that we can kill. Maybe I should get lens but I’m not sure.

Do you play Chen or Ench at all ? I’m trying to learn Ench atm (and positionning with Ench is hard :/) and set a goal for Chen as well. I keep seeing Chen in RD and telling myself « Man this would be a great Chen game » but then I don’t pick him.

Now more specific questions :

- On Witch Doctor, do you go for Tranquils or Arcanes ? I usually go for Tranquils because they allow me to heal only my allies instead of having to spend mana to heal myself and I found out that the bonus armor + wand helps you a lot in early engagements. But a lot of players go for Arcanes. My build is boots -&gt; wand -&gt; tranquils -&gt; agh’s -&gt; bkb (unless i’m against a good riki or naga, in which case i get bkb before agh’s)

- How do you place your first wards ? I like placing a lane ward mid and a ward for my offlaner but I’m not sure when there is a jungler on the enemy team for example.

- What’s your build on Skywrath mage ? Do you get Lens at all ? I stick to the old pos 5 build most of the time (Tranquils - Wand - Urn - etc…) but sometimes I get arcanes+mek, and I had theorycrafted a build with aether lens. I also play him very agressively and try to set up kills mid with concussive shot, especially if i have a qop or a zeus mid for example. How do you play him ?

- How do you use smokes by the end of the early game ? Usually when I play an agressive rotating support like CM, Ench or WD I like to use solo smokes in the early game to gank the mid lane, but afterwards I’m not really sure of how to use them. There are specific cases where it’s pretty obvious (example : you have a Lycan or an Ursa on your team, you smoke rosh, or you smoke then follow up with a mirana ult to force a teamfight if you just got a blink), but are there any principles for that ? I’m trying to use smokes as effectively as possible because I believe I’m wasting potential if I don’t do it as a support.

2462,"&gt; For carries that really, really (for me: most) benefit off a quelling blade in laning phase, do I just leave some excess gold and buy it after rune spawns in the side shop, or do I wait a few levels? I dislike that if they push/control the lane early, I wouldn't be able to buy a quelling blade had I not already.

To answer your question, it’s important to look at what quelling blade actually does.

Quelling blade provides a damage increase to creeps, for 200 gold or so, on one slot. So what is it useful for ? If you are a bad player, it allows you to not miss your last hits. It can prevent your opponent from denying you. But the item serves in fact a different purpose : it’s an efficiency item. If you hit creeps harder, you can hit a lot more creeps in the same time frame. Doing jungle rotations with your hero becomes easy when you have a QB.

Now, think about this situation. The enemy lane is advantaged, probably because they picked some « fuck you dual lane » like Necrophos-Undying or Bloodseeker-Axe. They are pushing the lane because they don’t know what they are doing and they let you have levels for free (or because they just want to dive you). In this situation, what would an efficiency item provide ? Nothing. In general, in these cases, you need regen, boots if they have slows, and stat items/magic sticks. Sure, a quelling blade comes really in handy once you have your first basic farming items, but before that it’s not always useful.

&gt; How can I play Spectre better? I find I have above average GPM in my most recent 100 games, and on Spectre herself I get vanguard-radiance at decent times. But I never really feel strong no matter the stage of the game, since I need manta after vanguard radiance meaning I am vulnerable to disables for majority of the game, and pure damage to single targets does not seem to matter when the meta (to my knowledge) is tanky strength carries with a billion hp.

Spectre is actually surprisingly decent this patch. I play her from time to time. Here are my last 2 games with her if you want to have a look :

- http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/2382078604

- http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/2391619405 (I had an awful start in this one… I was 0/4 or 0/5 at some point and I recovered. It’s a pretty decent show of how to recover as Spectre against excessive 5-manning).

The thing is that Spectre herself is not an extremely potent damage dealer. Sure your desolate is pretty good and dispersion scales very well, but the main power of spectre is to be able to gank everywhere every 2 minutes while keeping on farming which pressures the enemy team to do stuff against you. She also can pick off supports very easily, and she gets very tanky later on. I actually believe Spectre is very good against strength carries simply because most of the time a str core won’t want to pick up an MKB (except alch) and you can build butterfly + radiance. And even if they have a lot of HP, with a butterfly a 65 pure damage increase per attack, coupled with dispersion, is no joke. The meta doesn’t matter that much at your level simply because people can not play heroes properly. Talking about meta at low levels is like talking about taking dumps while squatting or sitting when you are still in diapers. It *does* matter and playing UP heroes lowers your chances of winning, but much less so than you think.

&gt; Are there any heroes to where I really should be ignoring my team and farming to a certain item threshold? I always carry a TP on me, but when I am farming stacked jungle camps and my team is forcing fights, I often find myself letting them die because I wouldn't have been much help anyways and would have really fucked up my item timings if things didn't go perfectly.

You should never ignore your team on any hero. Some heroes care about their team differently than others, but your goal is always to help your team win.

Let’s take a cliché example : Anti-Mage. Anti-Mage is a carry that’s known for his insane split pushing and farming power once he gets Treads + BF + one survivability item (most of the time vlads or vanguard). When a fight breaks out and you are playing Anti-Mage, you need to consider : « How would I help my team, and do I need to join them or should I just be split pushing ? » The reason why AM should not be joining fights often is because most of the time it actually is better for his team to not join and split push instead :

- AM farms insanely quickly, and easily reaches 700 GPM. A bad TP therefore can cost him over 700 gold quite easily. This indirectly hurts his team.

- AM split pushes quite well, and he can destroy towers with relative ease (not as easily as a Pugna or a Lone Druid but still very respectable). Taking towers is always very good for your team, they open up the map and they give as much gold as a kill to everyone in your team.

Another example would be Chaos Knight. CK, as opposed to AM, is pretty awful at farming, but he is really good at fighting once he gets level 11 + armlet + treads/bots + another item. With this hero, you will have a lot more situations in which you will *need* to TP into fights because it provides your team the highest chances of winning. But no matter the hero, you need to do everything you can to help your team win, of course.

&gt; I really feel I excell/prefer position 1 or position 2 heroes (but never mid lane). I already know position 5 from a few years in HoN (climbed super high with them) so I know the other end. My question is: Are there any strong safe position 1/2 carries I can pick every game right now?

Spectre is not bad, otherwise there is PL, Slark, Clinkz, CK, core Mirana (I have seen it work but I still prefer her as a support, depends on you), and Anti-Mage.

&gt; Is there a definitive way to learn a hero currently? We've completed the all hero challenge a couple times and have a strong moba background so we don't really have to learn a hero from a barebones standpoint, but it seems like there are very few quality guides created for most heroes that are up-to-date.

Use TorteDeLini’s guides and download replays from pro games or top ranked dotabuff players on the hero you want to learn would be my best advice. BSJ’s guides on Slark, Huskar and PL are goldmines too.

&gt; Is battle fury a noob-trap? The games I play typically always go past 35-40 minutes, so on melee carries without flashfarming potential, I always rush it before completed boots. I see tons of guides for example on PA that say to never get it, but I have no idea how I can hit over 600-700 GPM without it.

And why do you need 600-700 GPM on PA exactly ? Would you not rather buy Phase-Vanguard-Deso and roll over the game ? Sure your stats will look less good but you will win more games. Item choices are always a tradeoff. If say you go for a manta, you gain a dispel and illusions that can sometimes be very good (AM’s or PA’s illusions are disgusting), but since you didn’t go for an SnY you lose out on some potential tankyness and on a slow. Or since you didn’t get an agh’s you are losing out on an agh’s upgrade. Etc. Think about the situation and how to spend your gold and your slots properly.

That being said, there are still players who buy battlefury way too much, even on heroes on which it doesn’t make sense (I have seen battlefury nyx before and yes, it’s as bad as it sounds).

&gt; Are random cosmetic drops gated, or do I have a chance to get one every single game no matter what?

I think it’s some sort of pseudo-random chance to get it every game but don’t quote me on that.

&gt; Are unranked games still fairly balanced by player ""unranked MMR"" (if that exists) or is it a shitfest?

Unranked MMR exists, it’s just that in unranked you have a lot more spread MMRs because it doesn’t focus on a competitive aspect that much. The algorithm to make matches is less demanding in unranked, if that makes sense.

2464,"Yep, my point was : don’t get too focused on learning heroes, learn the minimum for your hero (each hero has a specific knowledge that you need to have to play him well, for example Visage requires to know how much damage you can deal with your birds and Pugna requires to know when you should decrep your ally and not the enemy). Then learn to play dota overall.

I suppose you know this since you come from lol, but dying really sucks. Dying sets you far back because you lose gold, your opponent gains gold and XP (and it’s really huge on some matchups in the early game), you spend time respawning, and then you have to buy a TP scroll (50g) to go back to lane. It’s important to think about how the enemies can harass you or bully you out of a lane. For example if you are a melee carry vs an Axe, the most threatening thing he can do is use berserker’s call on you when you are in your creeps because then he can proc counter helix and deal shitloads of damage, possibly killing you. So in order to deal with that, you can either try to bully him out of lane (rarely works, since Axe has a lot of armor, a nice base regen and he trades well early on with counter helix) or to split the creep wave by using aggro. That’s just an example.

I hope it was clear, if it wasn’t you can PM me for more explanations.

And don’t worry about making mistakes too much because everyone makes mistakes. Even on my signature heroes I do dumb stuff which causes me to die to bad players. Players like Miracle- or Puppey have died more than you ever will. However, the most important thing is to learn from them to improve. For example if your death was a result of bad judgement, not knowing how a specific hero works (« I blinked on Luna and she ultied me »), bad awareness (« Oh fuck, batrider has a blink dagger »), etc… you can ask yourself if the death was necessary or not and if you could have avoided that.

2467,"To some heroes, it’s very important. The biggest stack users as carries IMHO would be Sven and Luna. However, if the enemy team is frequently controlling your ancients, don’t stack but split push elsewhere instead. You don’t absolutely *need* stacks to win games as Luna or Sven, it’s just nice to have that GPM boost and that’s how you achieve 800+ GPM as Luna. 

Here are some tips regarding HotD (it might be a bit off topic) :

- Buy the helm of iron will first, not the morbid mask, most of the time

- Using your dominated creep is pretty easy to do : you can a-click a creep wave or a jungle camp, then switch to your creep (at :50 or so), watch the map, stack, put the creep back in front of the camp. You can practice doing it easily, at some point you will be even able to micro your creep during fights. Watching the clock in general is important as a carry because you need to use the clock to farm effectively, this trains you to do it.

- On Luna and Sven, wait until you have Yasha to clear ancients. It makes it much, much faster. On Luna the usual build for me is Starting -&gt; Aquila+Treads+HotD -&gt; Yasha -&gt; BKB or Manta into BKB for that reason.

- Disassembling HotD will kill your creep without giving any XP or gold to your opponents. If you are controlling a mud golem, it will divide itself if you disassemble.

- The chain lightning creep from the easy camp can be used to cut waves

- You can use hadouken creeps, dark trolls, or hellbears to split push.",2016-05-27 09:05:30+00:00,d3ljup3,1.0,t3_4l9uyz,1934.0,learndota2

2 skill builds are possible on him, but one of them is better about 70% of the time :

Greedy skill build (rare choice, but very fun to play) : Spirit - Aura - Stomp×3 - Splitter - Spirit×3 - max out aura then max out stomp last, taking ult whenever you can (don’t skip earth splitter level 2 and 3 anymore btw, now it scales very well)

Normal skill build (better in general, and especially better when the enemy team has PL, Drow, Terrorblade, Morph…) : Spirit - Aura - Stomp×3 - Splitter - Aura×3 - Spirit or Stomp - Max out your spirit last and again take ult whenever you can.

You don’t take stomp level 4 early because stomp level 3 is enough to set up your ult, it has a delay of Pi seconds.

Your only necessary items are tranquils + soul ring and everything else is luxury. I pick up a Solar Crest very often, Agh’s is good when you have Clock/Bane/Shaman/etc. and you need the disarm, lens is pretty good, veil is not bad, casual buckler is pretty good, and crimson guard/vlads/pipe/etc are really good. Basically, build auras, survivability items, and stuff to help your team. Buy all the wards, ET is really item independant. In theory Eul’s is also very good because you can set up solo kills but in reality it’s very often better to have survivability items because as a support you simply won’t be setting up solo kills. ET’s strength is not pickoffs, it’s teamfights at choke points (he is not called the king of rosh fights for no reason).

As for when to pick him, IMHO it’s the best support against PL by quite some margin. He makes PL so useless even late into the game, it’s even better than a Disruptor. Otherwise, stat-heavy carries that are not very mobile are your food (think of Drow, TB, Morph, Slark to some extent).

- Not split pushing

- Fighting too much

- Not tread switching (if you are not treadswitching as AM, don’t get Treads, get BoTs. Then learn treadswitching in bot games)

- Not farming effectively before the battlefury, for example by pushing out the lane when the offlaner leaves and blinking to the hard camp with vanguard + treads to farm it.

2558,"&gt; I harass (from behind my own creepwave, or the trees so I don't die)

Harassing from behind the creepwave when you are not silencer is not a good idea because it messes up the equilibrium. If you can not harass without dying or without doing it in the middle of creeps, don’t try to zone, it won’t do anything good.

&gt; I pull

Don’t pull unless you know what you are doing, *especially in 2v2 lanes*.

It’s a tough decision to make as it depends on the game. If you have someone who can handle tough lanes like Mirana or Clinkz (630 attack range + invis/leap) and you have a support who at least has some agressive potential, you can try to gank mid or snipe a courier with a smoke. Sometimes you can gank the enemy offlane, but especially in the case of a dual lane it’s tough. But overall, the key to make good decisions is : **the enemy team must be taking an unfavorable trade by putting pressure on your carry**. If they have a support who can not rotate a lot in the early game like Visage, you can abuse it by setting up rotations where he isn’t. If they have a jungler, you can contest him (unless it’s chen or ench because they will destroy you if you come close, or enigma after 4:30 or so). The enemy team will often have a weakened mid lane or a weakened safe lane as a result of dual laning agressively so very often you can try shutting either of these lanes down.",2016-05-24 12:00:39+00:00,d3hlbj6,1.0,t3_4kt02f,8097.0,learndota2

2566,"Yo ! I have played just a slight bit of Meepo but I had turned away from him if I was not playing bot games because I sucked at micro heroes at the time. Now I play a lot of Visage and I’m learning Ench so I’m thinking about trying Meepo out (especially with the new Bloodthorn, I don’t know what you think but the first hero that came to my mind is Meepo for this item).

Here are my questions :

- Did you play bot games to learn the hero to learn ? I played quite a bit of unfair bot games on Meepo before, and I was always going mid. I actually won a lot of them. But needless to say, in pubs it didn’t go well…

- What’s your absolute worst nightmare to see on the enemy team and why is it Storm ?

- Bloodthorn seems really legit to me on Meepo because he doesn’t care about the cost and it gives him some way of dealing with evasion. What are your thoughts on it ? Do you ever go for Silver Edge instead of Blink ?

- After bots-aghs-blink, when do you build skadi, manta, eblade, hex or any other item ? What makes you choose an item over the other ?

- Do you go mid, safe lane or jungle ?

- When I farm, I use 1 and 2 together and 3 and 4 together, then when I’m level 17 and have an agh’s, 2 and 3 together and 4 and 5 together while 1 either roams or lets the other meepos bot on him. Am I doing it right ?

- When you are farming and pushing out in the mid game, do you prefer using BoTs from one meepo -&gt; poofing the 4 others -&gt; bot on another lane -&gt; etc. or do you prefer moving them in groups of 2 still ?

- Is meepo ever a good pick ? I feel like he always requires massive outplays to win, a bit similarly to Anti-Mage in this patch (not very good against anything, but good in the right hands).",2016-05-23 22:35:03+00:00,d3gz7bu,1.0,t3_4kq9t7,4563.0,learndota2

2573,"From my experience 1 or 2 Raindrops are enough for mana regen on PL. By the time they expire your +6 stats (from levels 8 to 10) + your natural int gain + the low mana cost of doppelgänger will mean that you can have enough mana for fights all the time. You can go for Basi if you really need mana regen badly but it’s not mandatory.

The reason why VG is so good on PL is because it gives him *both* sustain and raw HP. This is extremely huge. Before this patch, you had 2 choices for PL in your early game items, along with BoTs : Drums (+HP but no regen) or Helm/Vlads (regen, but no bonus HP). In pubs you often were in this awkward situation where you needed drums to not get blown up but you had no HP regen and your teammate with 15 urn charges refused to heal you up. This doesn’t look like a big deal but it’s really crippling, my average diffusal timing was slower by like 4 minutes (!) in 6.86 since I had to buy Drums. Vanguard makes a huge difference. You are basically unkillable and you can farm/split push non stop, while being ready to BoT into any fight. I had a game where I was against a Brood and didn’t die even once. Sure Vanguard is really good vs Brood in particular, but this game also showed me how powerful this item was in general.

2578,"You still apply the same principle as always : try to maximize the threat you are posing to the enemy team.

If you have a really good split pusher like Anti-Mage, that means being the most annoying little bugger that you could ever be (cut waves, farm agressively, split push… Classic AM stuff). Try to make the enemy team run after you and waste time, you will buy time in this fashion and hopefully catch up. As you do that, your supports should be looking to place wards in agressive spots because you will allow them to do so.

If you have a fighting carry like CK, force favorable fights. It’s a lot harder to do but it pretty much revolves around abusing enemy vision and attacking when they are split up and unprepared. Get your team and you to push out all the lanes, then smoke into roshan or into their jungle to pick one off. This sort of thing.

You need to predict where the enemy team is if you lack vision which is very hard. My best tip for that is : keep note on the enemy teleports and look at their inventory whenever they show, and look for dat TP scroll.

Also Spectre is even better as a VG holder now because Drums got nerfed.

You probably build him wrong. The skill build is take 1 value point in aura then go 2-1-2-1 at level 6 then max pulse then sadist then aura and take ult whenever you can. The item build is Treads -&gt; Atos+Blademail -&gt; Agh’s or Arcanes -&gt; Mek -&gt; Agh’s -&gt; Greaves if you want to go for Greaves (unlikely but can happen). You need to be tanky and you need to be a huge annoyance to the enemy team with pulses and aura. Some people argue that he is a support but that’s wrong for pretty obvious reasons : he needs to be tanky and in the middle of fights, which is exactly what supports don’t do except Abaddon.

I would say Necro is best in deathball strats but he doesn’t need to snowball. Try strats like Necro + KotL + Pugna. Necro is awful at ending games but he lets his team end games by preventing buybacks.

I would say building vanguard is mandatory on her now because Drums was nerfed and because it’s really safe (it allows you to fight early without going back to base), and because you have Raindrops if you need mana regen.

Starting -&gt; Vanguard + Treads/Phase + sometimes raindrops (order depends, if you have a bad lane go Vanguard first and if you have a good lane upgrade boots first) -&gt; either diffusal or radiance. Radiance is still super good on Spectre especially against heroes that don’t carry MKB like Slark or CK, and it’s a nice farming item. Diffusal blade is a very cost-efficient agi item if you want to fight a lot.

The skill build varies, it’s mostly max desolate first if you want to farm (then take a few points in stats before level 16, here and there), and if you want to fight max dagger first, then desolate, and get stats at level 15 only.

That’s wrong. PL destroys Slark because Doppelgänger purges off pounce, because Slark is bad against split pushers, because Slark can not kill PL by himself, and because PL has mana burn which wrecks slark.

2621,"&gt; You never even consider maledict in mana useage, and while sometimes you skip it in favor of stats there are just as many cases where you take points in it early (or after level 9) because it does a lot of work in the right situations.

As I said in another answer, **most of the time** you will be skipping maledict until at least level 17+. That’s mostly because Maledict’s range is really bad and it messes up your positionning.

And as I also said in another answer, you usually pick up 1 or 2 levels in voodoo before level 11 because these are enough, if you look at the numbers level 3 and 4 actually bring you really little value. You end up maxing it because after level 12 or so you have a lot less mana issues.

&gt; There are no real ""stats early"" because at a minimum you're going 4 cask + 4 voodoo restoration unless you hate your team and want them to suffer.

What

Can you read my posts please ? I explained before why you didn’t go for 4-4-0-2 at level 11 but rather 4-2-0-2 or even sometimes 4-1-0-2.

&gt; you don't farm the jungle (even if you do, you do it with cask).

Except you don’t kill creeps in 5 seconds ? Farming the jungle gets you low, and of course you farm the jungle from time to time. Just because you are a support doesn’t mean you should take absolutely no farm.

&gt; Tranquils aren't going to heal your allies

But they heal you which lets you save mana for when you actually need it (to heal your team).

&gt; If you're wasting mana on healing yourself only you're probably doing something wrong.

Yes, and that’s going for arcanes.

&gt; And WD builds primarily defensively stated larger items anyways (Glimmer &amp; Aghs).

You don’t build Glimmer unless the enemy team has no AoE interrupt, but I already explained why before.

And I don’t know what you are trying to prove by arguing with agh’s because if anything it proves my point about tranquils.

&gt; You're also conflating ""Arcanes are decent if your team needs it"" with ""Arcanes vs Tranquils"" which cuts out using brown boots which is what I argue is better than tranquils when you don't need Arcane Boots.

Except it’s exactly the same question ? Brown boots is worse than Arcanes in pretty much every way and it’s way too greedy. Tranquils allow you to farm much more and make up for their little cost very early, and they let you move around the map slightly faster and let you survive fights. The normal choice of boots is tranquils but sometimes you really need to get arcanes because you have a bunch of mana dependant allies and you will have to buy mek. It’s rare but it could in theory happen, although it never happened in my games.

&gt; It's hard to make any sense of your post because you're trying to remove all context from the game which makes no sense.

This is taken from my experience as Witch Doctor : http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?date=&amp;hero=witch-doctor

I used to go for arcanes a lot, then i saw 5k+ support players like /u/munqst recommend tranquils and when i tried them i was baffled by how much of a difference it did. Tranquils allowed me to survive where i would have died with arcanes, get quicker agh’s timings, have just as little mana issues and win more games.

Please, spend some time reading my posts. Or tell me if I’m not clear. But don’t get into this mentality of « I’ve never done that so it’s stupid ».",2016-05-20 20:22:14+00:00,d3dd5sm,7.0,t1_d3d734x,8510.0,learndota2

2624,"&gt; You do enjoy the extra mana 

Not as much as you may think. It’s a very common misconception that WD is mana hungry, and this is in a lot of cases wrong. You need 400 mana to be fight ready at all times (cask + ult + TP + heal) and at level 10 or so that means you can cask 2 or 3 times before getting to 400. Keep in mind that with tranquils, you don’t use voodoo restoration outside of your ult.

And the extra mana is by no means required, because :

- You build agh’s already, which gives +10 int and +200 mana (or is it 250 ? Not sure)

- Your ult costs 200 mana which is not much compared to many heroes

- You build wand and take points in stats which already help a lot with max mana.

&gt; (voodoo restoration takes a lot of mana) 

Not if you go for Tranquils+Wand, you will need to use it a lot less because you won’t need to use it for yourself only. You will use it for your allies.

&gt; If your team has no Arcane boot carrier you go arcane boots.

Maaaaybe, and even then I would probably not do it unless I had to go mek and I had someone like Slark for a carry.

&gt; you don't need the HP regen (or frankly the armor because you're going to die to right clicks armor or not).

This is wrong. In the early game, levels in stats + wand + 4 armor makes you harder to kill than most supports.

&gt; if not Brown Boots + Wind Lace is cheaper and will serve you just as well (especially if you're focusing on building a big item like Aghs).

No it won’t, because as I said before Tranquils allows you to actually do stuff and not use all of your mana on healing yourself. Can you please justify your arguments instead of blowing thin air ?

Arguing for Arcanes on WD is like arguing for arcanes on Lion, now that I think about it. Sure you could argue that in some very specific cases you would need arcanes on one of these heroes, but in general tranquils are much more stable.

I mean try it in game. You will see a clear difference between arcanes and tranquils and you will see how much more you are able to achieve with tranquils.",2016-05-20 17:20:01+00:00,d3d5ay0,5.0,t1_d3cx2jj,11484.0,learndota2

2635,"Personnally, the only hero I would absolutely avoid Witch Doctor against is Naga Siren. As a core she split pushes a lot faster than you can push back and doesn’t let you have favorable fights, and as a support Song interrupts Death Ward at will and forces you to get BKB before Agh’s. Other than that, try to pick him when you are against immobile heroes and when you have long duration disables on your team. So avoid Slark, AM, Phantom Lancer, Weaver, Storm Spirit… and try to pick him when you have heroes like Legion Commander, Faceless Void, Enigma, etc.

It’s okay to play Witch Doctor as a dual offlane support, in fact he can do pretty much everything as a support : you can roam very agressively or play defensively with him depending on the lineup. Of course, you don’t have a lot of disables, but a lucky cask is a decent stun if you are not against QoP or something like that.

That being said, here is what I saw at first glance from your games :

- You die too much. Playing supports is not an excuse for feeding. It sounds condescending to say that when you played vs Spectres or anti-support heroes like that but even then try to avoid dying more than 5 times per game (10 if it goes late).

- Your item build is wrong, and that’s probably one of the reasons why you die too much. Unless you are planning on getting Aether Lens later, **don’t buy Arcanes**. Your early game items are Boots - Tranquils - Wand - Agh’s - BKB. Tranquils solves armor issues and indirectly helps with your mana pool : by going for tranquils, you never have to heal yourself up. Also, your spells cost relatively little mana for how much max mana you have so you don’t need +mana, unlike say a SK would. If you are against someone who is stopping your death ward every fight like Riki or Naga, get BKB before agh’s. **Don’t go for Glimmer Cape unless the enemy team has no AoE interrupt, get BKB or Ghost (if they have nothing but bashes to cancel DW) instead** (Riki’s smoke screen *is* an AoE interrupt btw).

- Your skill build is wrong in many cases. Don’t level up maledict against Lifestealer, for example. In general Maledict has a really low priority, and very often you should skip it for stats, going 4-1-0-2 at level 11 then 4-4-0-3 at level 16. That’s especially true when you are playing defensively.

2670,"I was in sort of a similar situation at some point. I was playing with a group of friends, and I was trying hard to win as always. But these guys messed around a lot : for example a girl that played only CM, Lina and Windranger refused to jungle when she played CM because « she didn’t like it » even though it was lane losing in a lot of situations. Or a guy specifically switched from AP to AR to avoid « tryharding » because he was against it conceptually (we didn’t get along very well…). I gradually played less and less with them.

Anyway, with hindsight, here is what I would recommend you :

- I assume you do that already, but don’t flame (thanks captain obvious)

- As /u/GCFungus said, the first possibility is to change either your mentality or theirs, but it’s really hard to do for either side and I would not quit a good mentality just for the sake of amusement in games.

- The other option is to take inspiration from this :

This is how our team enviroment is like. Bigdaddyn0tail is screaming in the mic:"" BIGDADDY BIGDADDYYYYY BIG DOOOOODYYY YEEEAAAA IM"" GOING INNNNN"". I'm yelling ""GET ON MY LEVEL HOE YEEE NEVA EVA NEVA EVA YOU CAN NEVA EVA GET ON MY LEVEL HOE"" everytime I kill someone. Fly is spamming Alt Left-Click on his gold to count it every second, he's also spamming Alt Left-Click quickbuyu on Midas to remind us every second how close he is to buying Midas while me and n0tail are yelling at him stop counting your money jew and don't buy midas or we'll lose. Meanwhile cr1t's spamming ""Good Game"" on the chat wheel while typing ""I am dead"" every other second. Alas we have Miracle- aka ""M-God"" aka ""8 0 0 0 M A T C H M A K I N G P O I N T S"" playing anti-mage and I think he muted all of us.
Now you might be thinking:""How the hell does a team function like that? Let alone win?!"". Well that's because this is the environment Miracle- is used to playing in his 8000 Ranked MM games. He ends up playing anti-mage or SF and carries the game 1v9. We are simply re-creating the environment in which he excels: Miracle + four 4k mmr teammates.

Basically, treat it like a usual pub. Play a hero that doesn’t care about his allies like TA, AM, PL or Invoker. Don’t try to micro manage your team mates because :

- You will be seen as an asshole

- Most of the time they will not understand why you tell them to buy X item or just not justify the purchase by using the item correctly

- It will be taxing on your brain capacity and you need to carry them.

So just reduce communication. You will probably be able to play your enemies really easily so abuse that by split pushing and farming effectively. Tell your allies important stuff only (« warded here », « push »…). It’s a lot more efficient and more enjoyable to you and your teammates. You have to remember that micromanaging is not really comfortable from the purpose of a 1.5k : he is put in a match where the average is 1k above him, and having Mr. Know-it-all teach him during a game in which he is overwhelmed can make him tilt easily.

2671,"&gt; Also if you're putting your 1.5k players as supports, no chance do they have a clue how to support in a game at your average. You're giving up a ton early by doing that in harass, not drawing aggro, wave equilibrium, mid ganks etc. 

But then which role do they play ? It’s a lose-lose situation, really. As a midlaner at 1.5k their farm will look ridiculously bad (1900 party MMR here, I can assure you people outlane themselves in this bracket), as a safe lane carry they will spend their time hugging a tower and crying for ganks when they have a Dark Seer on the enemy team, also having no farm. In the offlane they will not know what a ward is and forget that their minimap exist.

There is no « good » role to put the bad players on, and if there is one support would be the least risky in terms of winning probability.",2016-05-18 14:48:37+00:00,d3a9bz4,2.0,t1_d3a8ao1,1441.0,learndota2

2715,"&gt; A carry only has to:
&gt; 
&gt;     Last hit everything he can
&gt;     Survive when support is not in lane
&gt;     Keep an eye out for good TP opportunities to secure kills
&gt; 
&gt; But late game support plays a very minor role and the carry has to do what he was named to do, carry to victory. At this point we see quite a reversal in the game impact.
&gt; 
&gt; 

This is wrong on many levels. A carry’s job, no matter the hero and no matter the lane, is to maximise the threat he is posing to the enemy team (in the early and late game). That means that you have to be efficient with your item progression (should I get boots ? Should I upgrade to Treads now to dominate hit trades or do I take a Quelling Blade ? Which items will I buy next ?), static farming when the enemies need XP and are in lane to put them in a dangerous spot, pushing lanes when the enemy is 5-manning and you are not online, maximising your farm by doing jungle rotations, etc. If you think playing carry is straightforward and easy you have not played carry correctly.

And supports can be gamebreaking even in the late game, even though carries can in general do more (split pushing is more for carries, for example). When you think about late game as a support, you think of some heroes that can scale well as supports like Visage or Witch Doctor, but in reality having a good itemisation and understanding of threats, and being positionned correctly as a support, makes you an equally fearsome enemy to play against. To give you an example, I had played a game as Winter Wyvern against a Chaos Knight and I can guarantee you, CK could never use his ult. Even in the late game, he would get killed by his own illusions. The impact of supports is not as flashy and it’s very difficult to be impactful, but you can very well be. Unless you play something like Undying who is basically a ranged creep after 20 minutes, of course.",2016-05-13 12:15:55+00:00,d33xfjo,2.0,t1_d33ud54,8978.0,learndota2

Standing *behind* a core in lane doing nothing

Pulling in a dual vs dual lane or without thinking about it (oh, the lane is disadvantageous and our carry has to play back… let’s contest this lane even further and PULL, great idea. At least I will be able to flame him when he has no items)

Warding too defensively, in particular using the « blame spot » too much (upper cliff in the jungle of each side, very close to the base). It’s okay to use the blame spot offensively if the enemy supports can not leave the base at all or you have a very precise plan in mind but in general it’s much better to place wards more in front of the base or behind T2s in this case, it’s also harder to deward.

Speaking of dewarding… Predicting where enemy wards are and knowing when to remove them is pretty crucial, and of course no one at low levels does that.

Getting caught out too much, supporting is not an excuse for feeding.

And last but not least, horrible and inefficient builds. I’m talking about you, disruptor players who don’t take glimpse before level 10.

2721,"In general, smokes are a resource just like wards. Even if you don’t plan on using it, buy it at the start because it will give you one more smoke than the enemy team. In general, try to not have 3 smokes in shop. You can use smokes for many things :

- Ganking. In case you use smokes for ganking, don’t use them blindly just because you see an enemy. Think about the pace of the game first, whether or not the enemy team is split, if rosh is up, if one of them is farming the jungle… Also, if you have a blink initiator always let him go first when you smoke. It’s pretty obvious but not doing it will cost you kills.

- Placing wards and not being seen : in case you know that the enemy team has agressive wards and you plan on going to ward, it’s absolutely worth it to solo smoke to place wards. Placing wards or using any item doesn’t reveal a smoke. Protip : with tangoes, battlefury or quelling blade, you can also deward without being revealed.

- Taking roshan : in case you want to sneak a rosh, take **the minimum amount of heroes that can take it** (example : if you have a jugg or an AM with vlads/vanguard he can almost solo it, so take a support that has crest + AM and it will be easy. Heroes like OD, ursa, and a few others are also notoriously good at roshing). And, something very important : **ask your other teammates to show themselves on the map**. Abusing map vision is very easy in this scenario and a lot of pubbers don’t think about a rosh when 2 heroes are pushing top and bot.

You can, of course, combine the smoke uses. If you are facing clever enemies who will predict a rosh attempt with a smoke and therefore try to push top or mid while you take it, you can get your carry + one support that can not initiate to get rosh and set up a gank on a lone enemy, all with the same smoke.

- What’s your stance on nuclear power ?

Most people don’t mind that there but there are still quite some antis (I even met anti-nuclears who worked for the National Institute for Nuclear Safety, haha) **EDIT** : I saw that you had answered that question before. So here is a followup instead : do you have numbers to prove why we don’t need nuclear power at all even for the upcoming 30 years ? Of course the goal is to *eventually* get rid of nuclear power but pretty much every expert I’ve seen deems it as unevitable to use nuclear power a lot for the next 30 years or so simply because it produces a lot of electricity and it’s reliable, unlike renewable. It would also cost a lot less in the short-term and allow for a smooth transition. What is your opinion on that ?

- What’s your stance on oil from schists (is it the word ? Not sure) ? You are probably against it, but do you know exactly in which way you could get rid of it ?

- Is there a minimum wage in the US ? Do you have any plans regarding that ? Also, I saw some reflections on implementing a basic income system for everyone that would replace every financial help that the state would give, yay or nay ?

- And last but not least, as an engineering student I was thinking about going to the US for a thesis. Do you plan on changing anything for the university costs, especially for foreign students ? Coming from a country like mine where higher education is in general pretty cheap, and where the most prestigeous engineering schools are public so they cost about 1000€ per year, seeing the US’s cost is pretty demoralizing.

2763,"Copying my comment on Truedota2 here :

If you play ET as a support, the only items you need are Tranquils + Soul Ring. Everything else is luxury. Sometimes you can replace Soul Ring with Urn. For extension items after that, many choices are possible. My favorites are Solar Crest and aura items (Vlad’s, particularly). In the new patch Blademail is really strong on ET, since he already has a bazillion HP to make use of the return damage and he amplifies the returning damage. Veil also has great synergy with his aura. I like Agh’s a lot if I’m playing with a hero who sets up Earth Splitter well, like Clockwerk or Bane.

ET’s favorite allies are either heroes with setups (Bane, Clock, as mentionned), heroes that can initiate like Centaur, and last but certainly not least heroes who do both magical and physical damage, ideally in an AoE. The big name here is Gyrocopter, but there is also Visage. He also is great with Axe because Axe is a natural blademail carrier, and same thing for LC.

ET is best against stat-heavy agi carries. IMHO it’s the best support to have against Phantom Lancer because he can make PL useless even really late into the game and killing ET is extremely risky for the PL because he will be affected by Natural Order. Other than that, there are the classic agi carries : Drow, AM, Spectre… Slark sounds great to play against but it’s actually not *that* good to have ET against Slark, heroes like Skywrath (with coordination) or Visage/Lion (without coordination) are much better against him.

There are 2 possible skill builds for him, as a support : the greedy build (if you get a lot of levels, it’s the most fun to play but in general you take it less) and the utility build.

Greedy build : 23111422234331Stats4

Utility build : 23111433324221Stats4

In both of these cases, you noticed that echo stomp is gotten to level 3 first, and then left until 14. That’s because level 3 stomp is enough to set up Earth Splitter : ES has a delay of Pi seconds and Echo Stomp sleeps for 3 seconds at level 3.

I don’t play him as a core so I can not really say much about that, but I have seen players like Keyser (#1 ET on Dotabuff) go offlane and build stuff like Silver Edge or Dagon.

2806,"He is actually super strong, he just requires practice. His changes in 6.87 were a bit weird. The atos nerf hurt his late game, but Cloak got buffed yet again (I’m calling it right now, Visage is going to be an offlaner in 6.88 or 6.89). Overall, he is slightly stronger than before. The delay reduction on stomp is actually huge, it means you can stun someone very easily even with only grave chill, and the grave chill cast range increase is also really important to him. Wind Lace is also an indirect buff to Visage : his base MS is really low (285, which is as low as Morph who has Waveform and Viper who has 3 slows, or PL who has 2 mobility skills + 1 slow). So overall, he was perfectly balanced in 6.86, now he is slightly stronger than before. In my opinion at least.

I didn’t build Ablade a lot on Slark before because very often I would prioritize survivability and attack speed, so items like AC had higher priority in my build.

With Deso yes. With Orchid it takes a lot more than 3 shots, not to mention some supports can litterally just run from you when silenced or they build Eul’s.

&gt; Its simply differences in playstyle. If you go deso you're playing more splitpush and farm oriented, if you go orchid you're focusing on killing heroes. I agree that deso is usually better, but not 99/100 times, or even close to it.

I agree with you there. Maybe I was exaggerating a bit, but when I play supports I’m relieved when I see an Orchid in the enemy Clinkz’s inventory because I know that I litterally have to not die in the next 5 minutes and he will have lost so much, because with a Deso he could have pushed 2 towers and got a sneaky rosh for example.

If you don’t believe me, believe stats. Orchid is around 1500 gold more expansive than Deso, yet Orchid on Clinkz has a 49% winrate while Deso has 57%. Bloodthorn, the second most expansive item in the game, has a 56% winrate, which is **still lower than Deso**, and way below MKB (64%), on par with BKB (56%), *below Eaglesong* (69% wr), below hurricane pike (67% wr), below Blink Dagger (63%), below Solar Crest (62%) below Manta Style (66% wr) and below Diffu 2 (60%).

Normally I would say winrates don’t matter that much because it’s a lot more common to see bad players going for Orchid than bad players going for Deso, but in this case it’s so astonishing how low *both* Orchid and Bloodthorn are in terms of winrate that it can not be just that.

Bloodthorn-based builds on Clinkz have the same issues as Orchid builds : they are high risk, low reward. With Bloodthorn you can kill heroes with escapes, for a 7.7k gold item. Great. Now with Deso, you can push towers, 3-shot supports, have more damage in general, farm quicker, and you can get MKB against evasion which is very good on Clinkz. Not to mention deso costs 3.5k gold and builds up from Blight stone which is extremely good on Clinkz, and combined with medallion it gives a whopping -13 armor.

Oh, and the normal build got buffed as much as the Orchid build : Bloodthorn was added, but in turn Blight Stone was added, Infused Raindrops were added making your early game items cheaper (you get IR instead of a basi now, so now you get Treads-IR-Soul Ring-Medallion), you have a small peak before your deso, and Diffusal is better now.

Normally, you don’t skill maledict as a support, but if you know you can make use of maledict and it won’t punish you that much, you can really make use of a point in maledict, even before your heal is maxed.

Before playing, sit down for a moment. Think logically.

Ask yourself questions. Why does such an item exist ? What would it be useful for ? How much is it ? At which point can you get it ? On which heroes ? Against which heroes ?

Here is an example : Mekansm.

Now, mek is a bit tricky of an item. It gives stats, armor, HP regen (in an aura), and it also has an active that gives 250 HP and bonus armor.

Why and when is mek useful ? It’s useful in teamfights when the +250 HP and small bonus armor aura comes in play. That’s mostly around the end of the early game and until 30 minutes or so. Afterwards it still has impact but it falls off.

Why do you buy it ? Because you want to fight with your team ?

On which heroes can you get it ? What would be its limitations ? The first thing that comes to mind is the mana cost (225 is a lot), and the second would be your position because you have to be somewhat in the center of fights to use it effectively. The third limitation is a bit trickier to understand, but it’s basically : you have an item that costs 2k+ gold, but doesn’t give anything apart from a little bit of sustain and a lot of fighting presence. Will you buy it on carries ? Hell no. Will you buy it on supports ? Probably no, because it costs too much to be obtained unless you play Enigma. But on farming supports why not. Will you buy it if you plan on split pushing ? No, it makes no sense. Will you buy it if you have a tanky hero that has no mana issue or a hero that’s really quick at farming anyway and has no mana issue ? Very probably : these characteristics offset the weaknesses of Mek.

So you can pretty easily see that you would buy it on the likes of Dark Seer, Enigma (farm quickly, don’t buy damage), Chen (likes to group with his team early and farms somewhat fast with Wildkins), Tidehunter (farms ancients with Anchor Smash, doesn’t build damage), or Bounty Hunter (can gain a lot of gold from Track, doesn’t use damage items well at all) as a standard option, but also on supports if you happen to be given a lot of space or you get really rich early. I bought Mek on Lich in quite a bit of games because of these reasons.

Against which heroes should you buy it ? Well, against physical damage heroes, and against 5-man heavy lineups mostly. If you are playing vs Anti-Mage for example, it might not be the best idea to get Mek : Anti-Mage makes his team play in a very specific way which is using a 4 protect 1. The best way to play against that is to kill the AM, and Mek doesn’t help at killing AM. Grabbing an item like Blink instead could help you a lot more.

And then, once you thought a bit about items, try these in game. Think about how useful each item is. Every purchase you do has a purpose, even on something as seemingly meaningless as Boots of Speed.

3036,"Don’t bother playing traditionnal supports at low levels. In particular, don’t play any support that has no late game presence unless it’s undying and in this case you need to have a really good laning phase and transition it well.

But in general, since you are so low in MMR, my advice would be to play a lot of games on one hero to learn him (and practice games for heroes like Enigma who need that). Once you learn one specific hero, you will start learning actual dota instead of learning your hero. Instead of using your abilities well, you can focus on :

- Watching the map

- Warding correctly

- Using smokes

- Dewarding

- Getting farm as a support without feeding

- Managing TPs correctly

- Itemization

- Assessing your threats especially in fights, and your most important targets (useful for heroes like Disruptor, for example)

- Minimizing deaths.

These things are going to help you improve in general as a player, not only as a support. If you want to look at a replay, I have a replay where me and my GF were playing support (I was the BH, she was WD) : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/2283890261

Her main strengths are :

- Really good in trilanes

- Really good at farming

- Really good at pushing

- OK at teamfighting situationnally

Her main weaknesses are that she gets shat on by 80% of the hero pool. She has no way to deal with summons (on a patch that’s dominated by the likes of Invoker, Ench, Chen, and where Visage is a situationnal pick), she is super squishy so heroes like Slark demolish her, and she stays squishy at every phase of the game.

I would say pick her if you have a strong trilane and a decent pushing lineup but you would love to complement a deathball around 15-25 minutes into the game.

Hex is a lot better than Orchid in pretty much every way, on Clinkz, IMHO. I don’t get Orchid at all anymore on him, I realized that it’s just bad now. We are not in 2014 anymore. Even against the likes of Weaver, I would gank them with a teammate who has stuns and push towers instead of trying to solo kill. Orchid will usually lead to 1 pickoff and then the guy will ask one of his supports to come with him and bait. Then he will kill you back and you wil fall very far behind because Orchid only allows for ganks and doesn’t let you split push and it’s a very risky item in general. So an early orchid is almost never worth it. And if you get it pust 30 minutes, any enemy with a brain will probably have a BKB or a ghost scepter to deal with you.

I completely agree with your other item choices, though. I saw a couple times Clinkz players going for Deso and it was decent, but I would rather be in the enemy jungle constantly and get deso 3-5 minutes later than being Oom every 10 minutes or so. Having to TP back to refill is a pretty huge deal on a hero who abuses the enemy jungle.

3129,"Hi ! I’m a PL spammer myself, he is one of my favorite heroes. http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?hero=phantom-lancer

In my opinion, he is one of the most misunderstood and misplayed heroes of dota.

Let’s start by assessing his strengths.

- High starting stats and decent stat growth, except in strength.

- Doppelgänger and Phantom rush are wonderful when combined together : Doppelgänger being a very agressive spell and Phantom rush being a defensive spell makes the combination pretty good.

- To sum it up, he has a **high mobility**, and that’s his main strength for me

- Purge in one of his skills. Doppel has this aspect which makes it a bit like a worst Dark Pact in a way. In fact there are a lot of similarities between Slark and PL, but I will get to that later.

- He has the potential to win you the game at the pick screen, or to lose the game at the pick screen depending on the situation.

His weaknesses are, among others :

- Really bad at playing from behind

- Decent farming but not that good

- Gankable if you have the right heroes

- PL is beside themselves often, so heroes like Riki or Invoker with Orchid can really demolish them.

Here are my worst fears when I play PL :

- For cores, PL’s nightmares are **mobile cores with burst, cores that he can not kill, and silences**. For pos 1 heroes , PA, Ember and AM are by far the worst in this regard for me. Then there are the likes of Spectre, Naga, and Terrorblade. For pos 2 heroes, anything that can jump you and lock you down, in particular with a silence, is very good against PL. There is Storm Spirit, most notably. Also Invoker (really, fuck invoker). For pos 3 heroes, there are not many set in stone rules against him, but in general tanky heroes that he can not kill even with Diffusal, or heroes with AoE chain stun, or heroes that turn your own agression against you. In particular, **Dark Seer**, Legion Commander, Riki (but then you have Riki on your team), Orchid Clinkz (but then you have an Orchid Clinkz on your team), anything with Silencer, and many more. Oh and also Axe shuts him down really hard in lane but Axe is even worse than PL at that moment.

- For supports, **silences always work**. Most notably Disruptor (you have to keep your doppel to dodge glimpse and it makes it very hard), combos with Skywrath Mage (Clock Sky, Axe Sky…). You also have Enigma which is very good against PL. Other than that, there are particular matchups that are extremely disadvantageous for PL. The special mention here goes to **Elder Titan**, one of the best supports to have against PL. When I see PL on the enemy team and I play supports, ET is my go-to pick.

Also, push strats work very well against this hero. But if you are against PL, the biggest thing is to be ahead early on. PL is meant to take an early lead and he is not a very hard carry. If you don’t trust your laning skills against PL, pick something like Dark Seer + Spectre/Naga and wreck him in the mid game.",2016-04-03 16:58:55+00:00,d1o8b20,1.0,t3_4d636i,13700.0,learndota2

3150,"**Skill build, Item build, combos, whom you should avoid** :

At level 1, you almost always want Grave Chill, but there are some situations in which Soul Assumption is better (rare case, though). Then proceed to max out Soul Assumption first, taking a value point in Cloak between level 2 and 4. There is no set in stone rule for that. In general, the more I have to rotate, the later I take Cloak. A lot of pros have been going for a 2-2-1-1 build at level 6 but it’s not necessary to have 2 points in Grave Chill in pubs, extra burst is often better. So you should have, most of the time, a 1-3-1-1 at level 6. Then finish Assumption, then max cloak, and max chill, taking ulti whenever you can and stats whenever you have to.

Summary of the standard skill build : 12232423334111Stats4

The item build depends on your playstyle a little bit. There are 2 variations : Mek visage and Mekless visage. Mek visage is my favorite but Mekless is more common. Basically, if you find yourself hitting towers instead of heroes, mek is better. If they have heroes that are weak to -armor, mekless is better. In general, I find mek visage safer, in low level pubs. Very often, you will end up being the only mek carrier on your team.

Mekless : Starting items -&gt; Tranquils -&gt; Medallion -&gt; Aghs and Crest in any order. If you have a Drow or a Lycan on your team definitely get Agh’s first. If you are fighting a lot more than you are pushing get crest. Otherwise get agh’s. Agh’s gives both damage to heroes and towers.

Mek : Starting items -&gt; Boots -&gt; Headdress -&gt; Arcanes -&gt; Mek -&gt; Medallion/Aghs/Greaves/extension items. Most of the time I prefer Agh’s into Greaves for the pushing power, but again, it’s up to you.

Extension items include :

- Atos : Very good if you are ahead. Don’t buy it if you are behind. You lack lockdown and range on grave chill and this item mitigates both

- AC : Very much luxury, but really good for every situation on your hero.

- Force staff : the go-to if you are behind.

- Eul’s : Now I never go for that item because I find it unnecessary, but some players go for Eul’s to set up stomps. I’m not sure how much it’s worth.

- Glimmer : if you desperately need to survive against a Spec or something.

- Solar Crest

- Desolator : Very, very rare pickup. You buy it in case your 2000 physical damage burst is just not enough, which is once in a blue moon.

- Halberd : When you need the disarm.

- Dagon/Silver Edge : for roflstomps (in case of silver edge, you can consider it against heroes like Spectre… But you should not have to build it)

And a very special mention goes to a super underrated item on Visage, **gem of true sight**. Your birds have flying vision, and you are tanky which means you can use the true sight better than most supports. If the enemy team has map control, definitely consider it.

Now, here is a little list of heroes you should avoid picking Visage against.

- Phantom Lancer : He rushes on you and there is nothing you can do.

- Medusa : Split shot targets familiars and hurts them.

- Undying : zombies spawn under birds and despite barely crawling they hit flying units and damage them (how is that fair ??)

- Phoenix : The egg is immune to your birds.

- Treant Protector : Living armor destroys your burst with familiars.

- Slark : Mobility destroys you.

- Bristleback : Most of the time, he will turn your back to your familiars.

- Gyrocopter : For a beginner he is hard to deal with. When you hear Gyro popping Flak cannon’s first shot, **stomp right away with birds**. I don’t care that you still have 7 charges. Stomp.

- Ember spirit : Slightly annoying. Keep your familiars away from your hero so you don’t die from cleave like a retard.

- Storm Spirit : Fuck this guy.

- Sniper : When you are new to Visage, it’s hard to not feed your familiars to him. As you progress you should not have any issue with Sniper.

Heroes you love to play against are those with low attack speed and no way to deal with birds in general. Heroes like Jugg, SF, Earthshaker, Spectre (can go both ways though), Pudge, Keeper of the Light, and some more. Also heroes like CM or WD who have a long channeled spell are pretty easy to interrupt with stomp. And special mention to one of my favorite heroes to play against as Visage : Pugna. You can find his ward and easily kill it.

Your combo is pretty simple to execute. The principle is : see enemy -&gt; kill enemy.

- Select all of your units (birds + hero) then issue an attack command on a target.

- Select only your hero and then use Medallion, Grave Chill or Atos on a target.

- Watch your assumption charges go up, and **be patient with it, you don’t want to use SA on less than 3 charges (it’s basically a waste of mana)**.

- Use soul assumption when it would kill the target or at max charges.

In teamfights, here is what you do afterwards :

- Are your familiars in danger ? If yes, chain stomp. If not, find a good position to use stomp or try to use your last damage charges if you have some.

- Do you need more damage ? If yes, stomp then resummon.

- Keep spamming Soul Assumption.

- Stay safe and issue a move command to your familiars so that they won’t get killed right away as they spawn (unless you want to bait and resummon).

Keep in mind that when playing with a Drow, you want to be ideally a lot more patient with Stomp since you need to keep on auto attacking with your birds to make the combo useful.

**Gameplay** :

In lane, you need levels. You *can* rotate in theory but you really should not in 95% of your games. You need a quick level 6. Zone and use grave chill when the offlaner tries to trade. Pull the hard camp only if you can, don’t let the offlaner get free XP.

After level 6, the ball starts rolling. Ideally, you should have your carry leave to farm the jungle, but most of the time he will stay in lane because he managed to miss free last hits. So in this situation, use birds to hit the enemy offlane tower. Be careful, he might try to kill one. Be triggerhappy on the stomp.

After you took the first tower and you start to have your core (almost mek or medallion completed), then you can look for either a rosh (with medallion it’s very easy) or just more towers (if you went for the mek route it’s very easy too). Try to force favorable trades with your team and if the enemy team tries to fight they are fighting into a Visage who just hit his peak. It gets harder and harder to deal with you as you approach level 10 and get more and more levels in Cloak.

After getting all the T1s, keep on securing the map for your team and assist in ganks or pushes, either with Visage or with your birds. Eventually, you need to take roshan and win the game whenever you can, but sometimes your team will not compel because they don’t know how much damage your hero does on Roshan. In any case, remember that **you can use birds to scout rosh**.

If you are behind early, avoid dying at all costs and consider buying some wards to ease the other support’s life. Be a lot more careful with familiars. Visage is not meant to play from behind, he is meant to be agressive and take over the game, but sometimes shit happens and in this case don’t lose your cool and do not feed. That’s true for familiars and hero.

If you need any info on Visage or coaching, let me know.

Have fun, and remember : Victory is as inevitable as death !

3151,"Hi ! I play a lot of Visage at slightly above your level (2.8k). Here is my record on him : http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?hero=visage

And here is a guide I did on Drow+Visage, one of the most well-known combos for him. It doesn’t cover the basics of Visage, I will explain them here. https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4cia0a/drow_visage_miniguide/

Contrary to a popular belief, this hero is not hard to play. He is not very micro intensive (if you can play Enigma or Lone Druid you can micro Visage), and he is extremely fun. He requires practice.

Anyway, let’s start.

**Overall look at Visage** :

Visage is a pretty weird hero. His stats are, all around, pretty bad, but it’s not alch level of bad stats.

- Base MS : 285, which is low (as low as Viper who has 2 slows, Morphling who has waveform + replicate, PL who has doppel + rush). The only way he makes up for his lack of movespeed is Grave Chill which is okay but not the best thing ever.

- Base damage : average (around 50, can’t remember the exact value. I think it’s 53 average but don’t quote me on that).

- Decent range, not amazing

- **3rd lowest base agi in the game** (after doom and undying), and also a really bad agi gain.

- **His base magic resistance is at 10% and he is the only hero who has that. Other heroes are at 25% except Meepo with 35%**.

- Starting strength and starting agi are pretty high though, and he has a very high strength gain for an int hero.

Doesn’t look good, heh ? You will see why he is a good hero with his spells.

- *Grave Chill* : « Steals » MS and AS from an enemy. The spell is pretty straightforward, but there are some things to keep in mind with it : first, the debuff to enemy and buff to visage are actually separated (it’s not an actual steal). That means if your target dies or gets purged, you still keep the bonus. Second, **the only thing that scales with levels on Grave Chill is the duration**, at 3/4/5/6 seconds. The slow remains the same and so is the range. Its range looks decent but it’s actually pretty bad, you will have trouble casting Grave Chill in the midgame in some situations.

- *Soul Assumption* : Now it’s getting interesting. This spell is a bit weird. You gain charges of Soul Assumption (the bars above your head, and you can also see your charges on your buff bar when the game glitches out and you don’t see the yellow bars) every time an ally or enemy hero takes 110 damage in a 1375 AoE around you. You can hold a maximum of 3/4/5/6 charges. Charges linger for 6 seconds. When you use it on an enemy, it damages them for 20 + 65×your amount of charges, for a maximum of 215/280/345/410 magical damage. The best part of this spell is the cooldown, it’s extremely low at 4 seconds. No other hero in the game, except Pugna, has a 400 magical nuke on a 4 second cooldown. Soul Assumption is essentially your hero right click in the mid to late game. You will use it instead of your autoattacks. This spell also has a very high cast range and it’s a great finisher.

- *Gravekeeper’s Cloak* : This spell is the second asset to Visage’s tankyness. You can have a maximum of 4 layers of your cloak. Every time you receive any kind of damage (even OoV ticks remove them, I’m pretty sure), you lose a layer. Each layer gives 1/2/4/5 armor and 3%/6%/12%/16% magic resistance. The spell really starts to shine when you get its level 3, at around level 9-10. Don’t underestimate Cloak, but don’t overestimate it either ! It allows you to be a bit in the center of fights but don’t get focused too much or the Narrow Maze will call you back and then Razor will smile and tell you « Nice feed nub »

- *Summon Familiars* : This. is. amazing. The principle of the spell is that you summon 2 familiars (3 with agh’s) that fly, have a very little vision range, never auto attack, can basically not be A-clicked because they have a very tiny « search range » when the creep they attacked was killed, and they are pretty squishy, but holy shit, **their auto attacks do a lot of damage**. To be more precise, it starts off huge and then they lose damage until they reach 10. With a total of 8 auto-attacks from your birds (keep in mind : they are magic immune so they are not affected by pretty much any slow, and they have a very low BAT at 0.4s !), you can deal (before reductions) :

- Level 1: 10/18/26/34/42/50/58/66 attack damage, 304/608/912 total damage with 1/2/3 Familiars
- Level 2: 10/24/38/52/66/80/94/108 attack damage, 472/944/1416 total damage with 1/2/3 Familiars
- Level 3: 10/32/54/76/98/120/142/164 attack damage, 696/1392/2088 total damage with 1/2/3 Familiars

Yes, you read it right. You are able to deal, over the course of 3.2s, a total of 600 physical damage at level 6, on a hero that has Soul Assumption to finish targets. And familiars can be refreshed by using their ability, Stone Form, which also heals them and stuns enemies around it. At level 16 with agh’s, you can deal a whopping 2000 physical damage. The only other spells that can do that much damage are Magnetize and Poison Nova (and I guess Freezing Field…) but they are all over time, you deal this damage over around 3.2s (if your target is standing still).

So, he looks good now, right ? With that in mind, let’s go over a few myths about Visage because he is widely misunderstood (he has absolutely no reason to be least played on dotabuff) :

- You are not a support, in traditionnal sense. I repeat : **you are NOT a traditionnal support**. What does that mean, you may ask ? Stop buying all the wards. Let the other support do it. Visage is a greedy and agressive hero, he plays between pos 3 and 4. You really need to have a mindset closer to a core’s when you play this hero.

- Visage scales extremely well in the late game, especially for his position. 100 magic damage every second on average, on a very long range, plus 2000 physical damage that can be dealt on towers every 30 seconds ? Sign me the fuck up.

- Speaking of towers, you have a very high pushing power. Use birds to attack towers. Also, towers damage them less than heroes (6 auto attacks needed to kill them from a tower), and towers target them last.

- And Visage is not limited to combos or cheesy strats like Drow/Visage, or any BoT hero + Visage. He can be played anytime the enemy lineup doesn’t wreck your birds naturally or deal with your burst well.

- And one last thing… Visage is for real not very hard to play. You need to practice your combos, which I will go over in a second. It’s pretty much always the same combo but you add items to it.

3178,"&gt; How have you found the recent update (familiars can be affected by disables, and can't move while casting stun), has affected your play? I think that Visage has the potential to be rather strong even without a Drow, but people rarely take the time to learn the hero (somewhat like Oracle, although poor old Nerif is definitely being picked).

To my surprise, it actually almost didn’t affect my playstyle at least. The biggest change for me was probably the fact that familiars could not move while casting Stone Form, it makes it harder to chain Stone Form with a slow. I’m pretty sure only BKB piercing disables can affect them so there are not many and you are happy if the enemy beastmaster wasted his ult on your birds for example.

&gt; Being serious, it's nice to see a Drow/Visage guide - so often, Drow players either don't know they have an Active on Precision Aura, or that they should be using it when Visage needs it.

That’s exactly why I wrote this guide. I saw so many of my Drows going for stupid shit like Treads - Silver Edge - Daedalus, or not believing that their aura was castable too.

This is wrong and that’s because of a misconception about PL. PL is extremely mobile too, and he doesn’t rely on a bunch of illusions to do his dirty work. PL is a hero who abuses his mobility advantage (he has an engage skill and a disengage skill), and dusa is probably the most immobile hero of the game. Not to mention Stone Gaze is the easiest spell in the game to purge with Doppel.

You are probably playing against bad PLs. Even though Dusa *has* ways to deal with PL thanks to Split shot, she can not kill him and PL can kill her so the matchup is unfavorable still. And again, BKBs against PL are extremely risky because PL has absolutely no issue with them by themselves.

If you go for Mek it’s absolutely necessary to go for Arcanes for exactly that reason. I facepalm when I see players skip the arcanes before finishing mek when they play this kind of Visage.

I actually had a 40% winrate with Visage when I played him with Medallion only and I got the idea of getting Mek on him from Drosera (he was #5 on Visage according to dotabuff at the time).

3237,"I have the same issue. I play in low 2k with some friends, high 2k solo, and 3.5k with other friends, and it feels like 3 different games. 

- At 3.5k ish it’s a lot closer to being real dota. It’s a lot more relaxing and a lot easier to play because the « game rules » are what I’m used to : supports are there for a reason, split pushing and taking objectives is considered, and players are a lot more reliable especially in stacks. Of course there is still a lot of mistakes but it’s getting there.

- An low 2k I don’t win if I play support, compared to how easy games are as a carry. I would say the easiest way to win at these low levels is to pick a hero that’s widely misunderstood like PL, Elder Titan or Visage. I can not count how many games I won because the enemy team thought it was okay to just pick earthshaker against my PL, instead of real counterpicks like Disruptor or Elder Titan. Guess what, it wasn’t. If you play Visage people are going to make stupid mistakes like trading with you less than once every 5 seconds when you are level 4 and have at least 1 point in Cloak. Well, you get the point.

- High 2k would be so easy if it wasn’t for player’s egos. People there argue a lot more than in other brackets imho. I think the best ways to win in there are either to spam OD/Invoker/anything that’s decent (also picking Visage and telling your teammates to play Drow works very well) or to play self-reliant heroes that can deal with very tough lanes like Clinkz. That is *especially* true for safe laners because at low levels I can not remember the last time I didn’t have a very tough dual lane against me as a carry.

3303,"I’m not sure about CK, but I play a lot of PL and specifically I’m not afraid of Earthshaker at all. I even pick PL against earthshaker. Basically, shaker is a one-trick pony, especially against illu heroes : he has ONE way of being effective and that’s blink into echo. PL can really abuse that : he has an insane mobility because BoTs + Drums + SnY give him close to max movespeed. He also has a slow with a long range, that makes him harder to kite. His 2 other basic spells are 2 mobility skills. 2 mobility skills is *insanely good* on any hero, even though PL’s are pretty weak he is still very mobile.

Also, shaker has no way to stop your split pushing apart from blink ulting you when you are taking a creepwave and you spawned illusions, so watch the map and send illus forward only if that happens. Otherwise shaker is shit against split pushing, which gives even more tools for you to outplay him. You don’t need to rush heart or something like that even though it can help against shaker.

As PL, at least, here is my overall advice :

- Pay attention to ES’s animations, they are really long so you can doppel dodge them (fissure especially, you can also go over it)

- Split push quite hard (but stay safe of course ! Watch your map and don’t do stupid stuff)

- Try to force them to split up, shaker is decent in ganks but not really good in 3v3s or 2v2s for example (he is decent, just not his strong point)

- In fights, dance around it and specifically try to spam Spirit Lance on Shaker. That’s even more true when you have diffu.

If you practice it, you can also avoid Spirit Breaker’s charge with Phantasm (I’m not sure on this one ; it’s true for doppel for sure, but for CK ult you probably have a very tight timing window if you can) so you can turn ganks around this way.

But just from your post, it sounds like your PL did a terrible job. You don’t « just back away » from any decent PL player. Phantom rush exists. And unless you are trying really hard to be caught ES should not be an issue.

Here is my last game as PL vs shaker : https://yasp.co/matches/2225333512

It might seem like a bad example because we snowballed that game, but it actually tends to happen when you can buse ES’s weaknesses during the laning phase and pre-blink in general. Pre-blink ES vs PL is a joke.",2016-03-22 23:39:11+00:00,d19t6tk,1.0,t3_4bhr98,30893.0,learndota2

Earth Spirit is very annoying to PL because of his long range and mobility, but now he is less of a worry because Doppelgänger purges magnetize (same for diffusal, but once you have diffusal ES is not really a problem anymore, in any case).

Earth Shaker is not very good against PL. When I pick PL and see the enemy team pick Earth shaker I’m glad they picked it instead of Elder Titan/Disruptor/Silencer (as a support) or instead of Ember/Earth Spirit/PA/AM/Lesh/Storm or even QoP (as a core). To put it simply, Earthshaker has no mobility outside of blink dagger, he is very mana starved so diffu wrecks him, he is weak in lane, you can go over fissure with doppel or dodge it, he has very long cast times outside of Echo Slam, and the hero is very predictable so avoiding his ult is pretty easy. You just have to be careful if you push : when you make too many illusions, and when he is off map, back off straight away.

With BoTs, you get :

- Split pushing power

- Very close to max MS with SnY+Drums

- Ways to fight with your team

- Map pressure

- More agressive farming potential and ways to fuck with the enemies’ TP which PL can take advantage of really well

Treads give you :

- Mana efficiency (keep in mind that with BoTs, you can TP back to fountain to refill)

- Slightly more attack speed (irrelevant in the early game because your main damage source is Spirit Lance)

- +9 agi/str to you and illusions (illusions get a whopping +1 damage from that when they do damage…). They increase your damage if you leave them on agi, but most of the time you will use them on str because that’s the point of getting treads on PL. So you get a little tankier, I can’t deny it. Same with your illusions.

And that’s it. You don’t even need Treads to farm the jungle, unlike Slark for example. In general, BoTs &gt;&gt; Treads on PL.

Agh’s on Jugg is pretty garbage too to prolong your comparison, and even with a CD buff Agh’s Luna would still be at best purchased 10% of the time. Luna can not really build agh’s in a normal game because she needs too many items outisde of agh’s : Treads/bots - hotd - aquila (or drums) early on, then manta/bkb/bfly, then right click items + satanic as the game goes on. If you build an early agh’s you don’t do anything because you can not farm and you can not fight without Eclipse either, but if you build it late your ult is ineffective anyway.

Your comparison with Omnislash made sense, especially if you consider only the agh’s upgrades on both spells, though.

&gt; Also, do you have any thoughts about maxing Glaives first? Because they double in the last skill point (they go 1/2/3/6). IT would be kind of like a farming sven build where he maxes cleave.

That sounds garbage and every time I saw a luna do it they failed. You don’t make use of Glaives until you have at least hotd + aquila/drums (that’s the minimum requirement for farming the jungle with a somewhat decent efficiency) and at this point you should be at the very least level 8 or 9. The benefit you would gain from 2 extra levels of Glaives would be outweighted heavily by how much you sacrificed by not maxing lucent beam first.

I think she has a lot of problems and I agree with you, Luna can not do many things. She is very good at 2 things : farming and split pushing. She is okay at teamfighting and getting straggler kills thanks to Eclipse.

I think a perfect Luna game would be when your opponents don’t have summon heroes to tank Eclipse, weak anti-split push, and no anti-bkb. That is pretty rare (unless you are playing in normal skill games, for some reason people pick these kind of teams quite often in low level games. Fuck winning, right ?). And on top of everything, in a perfect Luna game, you would be either dual laning with a really good zoner like Oracle or have a trilane with kill potential.

For good matchups, I’m not really sure. It’s not really hero-dependant. It’s mostly weak laners that you can dominate/kill from safe lane, and then heroes that can not just go up in your face and kill you during Eclipse.

For bad matchups, there are plenty. AM, PL, Gyro, Lycan, OD, PA, Windranger, Nyx, Batrider, Queen of Pain, Templar Assassin, Nightstalker (you give him a free 10second darkness when you eclipse), Bristleback, Sven, Alchemist, and many more.

What I love about Luna in pubs is how easily you can recover from bad starts at low level with her and how hard you can push. She rewards map awareness in the mid game and it’s one of my strong points.

I think Luna needs buffs on Eclipse, to be more precise. Eclipse is really bad for how long its cooldown is. Giving Luna 1200 ranged flying vision during Eclipse would be nice because it prevents people from juking you. On top of it, make Lunar BLessing give her additional MS or damage at night. That’s how I would buff Luna anyway.",2016-03-20 07:55:43+00:00,d16jny8,1.0,t3_4b5eqm,29010.0,learndota2

3353,"It makes you eat a creep, which gives you a last hit (or deny if it’s allied). You get a percentage of the creep’s HP at the moment he was eaten in damage, and you get 10 times this percentage in max HP. At level 16, it’s 8%/80%.

If you eat a creep with 1200 HP (wildwings, centaurs…), it will give you +60/78/96 damage depending on your ult level, and +600/780/960 HP.

So… why is this useful ? First, it makes you hit like a truck and be really survivable. Combine Medallion’s bonus armor, Clinkz’s naturally high agi gain, and Death Pact and you have a much more survivable Clinkz than you would expect. The damage part doesn’t tell you everything, because it also gets amplified by deso and medallion’s debuff so it’s even better. It’s also a farm accelerator : you instantly kill a creep which of course increases your farming speed, but you also get bonus damage to increase your farm speed more, and the bonus HP allows you to farm in more dangerous areas like the enemy jungle (Clinkz needs to farm agressively to create space for his team and split push with ease).

Now, how you use it ? First thing : you **always want your ult to be on cooldown** as Clinkz. There is absolutely no point in not doing it. In general, you should get Soul Ring before level 6, so when you are level 6, start rotating between the hard camp close to your side lane when your ult is up. Soul ring up and eat the creep. When you get medallion, in general you try to gank mid then go into enemy jungle (or just go into enemy jungle) and you keep spamming it with Soul Ring. You never ever go into an engagement without ult as Clinkz, it’s one of the biggest mistakes that new Clinkz players make. Delaying your entrance in fights by 20s just to use your ult is always worth it because the buff really makes a huuuge difference. For obvious reasons, you always use it on big creeps (unless you have HotD ; in this case you dominate then eat a small creep).

Also, it’s really important to be mana and HP efficient when you use your ult. Here is how you do it, with Treads and Soul Ring :

Treads to str -&gt; Soul Ring -&gt; Treads to int -&gt; Death Pact (or Dominate + Death Pact if you have HotD) -&gt; either go invis with Treads on int if you want to gank, invis and swap Treads to agi if you want to get to a place quickly but not gank, or switch Treads to agi to continue farming.

Tell me if you need more precise advice. I play Clinkz from time to time and he is one of my favorite carries.",2016-03-16 07:14:58+00:00,d11pwp3,1.0,t3_4amlh3,2551.0,learndota2
3354,"&gt; I read up on guides and the general opinion seemed to be farm til 35 mins when you have manta and skadi and then dominate the late game. I got the skadi and manta but still lost... why?

Because you read stupid guides.

First of all, manta on dusa sucks balls. It’s an item that benefit mostly stat-heavy agi heroes. Dusa has a shitty agi gain, she is ranged so her illusions are weak, and her illusions don’t do anything because they don’t have mana shield.

There are a huge bunch of common misconceptions on Medusa. She is a hero that scales incredibly with each items. Her first big item has as much impact as her 4th. That is, if you don’t build stupid shit like Manta.

On Medusa, what I do a lot these days (and I win a lot with it, so I think it’s not too bad) is go for Phase-Aquila-Mask of Madness (don’t forget to spam it for farming and use it right as you ult !)-Drums. You can swap drums and MoM depending on the game of course. Basically, don’t get Linken’s because it’s not really necessary (you won’t escape more things with Linken’s than without, you are a slow hero anyway), and don’t get manta. Get mid game farming/fighting items, that allow you to come online quickly.

After MoM+Drums, your items vary. You can go for the slahser/waga build and go BKB+Rapier, you can get Skadi (don’t get it against Nyx ! If you are against Nyx, get Bloodstone + BKB + damage items), Butterfly, Bloodstone, Mjollnir, MKB… These should be your most common options.

You get PMS + tangoes into a quick bottle and abuse aggro to get farm. PL has pretty high starting stats so contesting CS is a lot easier than on other melee heroes. Don’t play up into your opponent too much because a lot of heroes can beat you in lane (Puck, Ember, Death Prophet…). Once you get bottle+pms+boots, you can work towards your next items, and most of the time it’s drums + bots. 

At this point, you play him like an Anti-Mage with weaker farming abilities and slightly better fighting abilities. Farm the enemy jungle whenever you can if they don’t have heroes like Silencer or Disruptor, farm ancients (unless they are dragons, they have splash damage and deal a lot of damage), push and cut waves. If you are safe, you should use doppelgänger to cut trees or avoid walking into dangerous areas. You also need to use doppelgänger to farm ancients, the illusions can tank for you. When you farm, especially ancients, *beware creep aggro*. Try to make your illusions tank. If you have bottle, you can spam Spirit Lance a lot more than with a Vlad’s so you should in general use spirit lance and let the lance illusion tank for you.

When you get your first big item (normally diffusal, sometimes SnY, sometimes manta but very rarely), you can look to fight a lot more. You can also secure roshan with your team, but PL is awful at taking it especially without vlad’s. You need to get an advantage at this point, PL is not that strong in the late game because enemy supports will survive and force away and enemy carries will have MKB against your bfly and 3-shot you. So you need to play from ahead. Take all of the outer towers, ward agressively, keep on farming agressively too. Secure the aegis for yourself and win the game once you have your next big items coming (Skadi, Manta if you don’t have SnY, Heart, and Butterfly are normally your item choices btw).",2016-03-13 14:29:42+00:00,d0y7tcb,1.0,t3_4a85pa,7634.0,learndota2

You are contradicting yourself.

&gt; As you saw from shanghai he was still quite effective in some of the games he was picked mid.

No. He was truly effective once, and that was when Hao played him (Newbee vs CDEC). Otherwise, the pick didn’t do a lot.

&gt; The issue with this is that in today's meta the enemy team is going to be coming up your highground at 20 minutes and pl is just far too weak at this point unless your team has some overwhelming advantages and because he has no waveclear or aoe spam he cant really do much to stop the pressure.

You summed up a part of my post.

Yeah, because we should use a crystal ball to pick which hero will be nerfed or buffed.

Numbers do matter. What do you want to use if you don’t use stats ?

3401,"Okay, so I will try to make a guide as beginner-friendly as I can.

At first, ask them this question : « Why are there supports in this game ? » and *let them answer*. I think it’s very important to start with the basics here. The role exists because :

- In the early game, cores need protection from the enemy team

- In the mid to late game, cores often need slots on stat items or on their items, so they have to rely on someone else to carry wards and place them

- Utility items are a thing in this game.

Among others, of course.

Then, coach them a little bit. Ask them questions why you coach them :

- « What would be the best way to help your team win the game at the moment ? »

- « What are your threats ? »

- « What do you think the enemy team will do in the next minutes ? In the next seconds ? »

- « Why did you die ? How can you avoid it ? »

Etc. In summary, teach them to think by themselves. When they make a questionnable decision (example : pull when you are dual laning with a Spectre), ask them what are its consequences (example : « Spectre took 200 damage because of your pull »).

If you get Orchid you can also not transition your ganks into pushes easily, and you can not farm quickly.

I mean if you are a god who can prevent every single Primal Split with Orchid or something, then sure, buy it. But for normal people like me, Orchid is not the choice in 99% of games.

They are not. The only situation in which they are useful is if you are prepping up a WW1 trench war. I play both supports and carries and it’s very frustrating to see my supports ward in such places after 10 minutes. Out of all these ward spots, the only useful one would be the rosh ward. If the game is even, in general you try to sneak up a ward behind a tower that you are likely to take next.

Second : If your safe lane is getting camped (which happens) ping the enemy towers on their mid and safe lane. Then hope that they will push them.

Third : Dagger into trees and sap XP. Then once you are 6, get kills with Haunt.

- Out last hit him.

- Try to get your supports to buy you a high ground ward for mid. It’s not the biggest of deals if it fails, but it helps a lot.

- Check the enemy mid’s items and levels. Sometimes you can go for a solo kill if you have a hero with high DPS early on like OD or invoker.

3483,"Thanks. The reason why I said OD gets weaker in the late game is because he gets squishier and squishier comparatively to other cores and he has absolutely no answer to BKB. Invoker has right clicks and ways to prevent BKB, Death Prophet has self euls, ghost, and Exorcism goes right through it. Granted, in some games OD will be very strong late but especially in pro games I feel his late game is weaker than most cores. In these games especially, a Lycan running at an OD with BKB was a problem because OD could do absolutely nothing but self astral against it. OD is one of the worst manfighters in the game when the enemy has BKB.

For void, I think 60 CD chronos are very strong in the mid game, but in the late game what makes him really strong is refresher.

And for Supernova… Well, I don’t really know, I don’t play Phoenix a lot, but it feels like Supernova gets blown or disengaged from pretty easily as the game goes on and on. Supports are not as weak to it because they can force away, and cores can hit faster and faster. On the other hand, Sunray is always relevant because of its long range and scaling damage.

Mek first, in my opinion, is the way to go in 99% of enigma games. No one is going to get a mek as early as an enigma if left uncontested (except a mid that gets 100% last hits + a stack or 2).

3533,"From looking at the YASP of the game :

- You got Soul Ring at 3:03, Mek at 13:37. Both of these timings are off. You need to have Soul Ring around 2 minutes, Mek around 8. I know you were on radiant (on radiant you usually add one minute), but it’s still not an excuse to be that far behind that early.

- Since you didn’t farm really well early, you probably missed your power spike around 5-8 minutes into the game. Around 4:00-5:00 you should have level 6, around minute 8 you should have mek, and both of these timings are very important for you as Enigma. In general, at level 8, you can go to your safe lane or mid lane with your mek and push a tower down.

- **160 Tower Damage**. What the fuck ? Do you know that eidolons damage towers ? Do you use mek for pushing ? You should have around 1k-2k TD on average on enigma.

- 168 creeps in 40 minutes is too low. You need to have eidolons on cooldown for the whole game if you can help it.

You need to push more early on, split push with your eidolons, and in general be more efficient. Also, early on you are very tanky in fights because of your mek + your level advantage. Don’t be that asshole that waits really far for 20 minutes until he gets a 5 man black hole.

3538,"I would say he is in a decent spot at the moment. He is situationnal, and he has some very harsh weaknesses. He is, in fact, a pretty shit hero but he can cast spells twice. Purge said (and I agreed with him) that he is some sort of mix between Meepo and Tinker.

His strengths are :

- Triple Midas

- Very good split pusher once he gets Necro 3 (in terms of hitting towers)

- Potentially always has a 10s BKB

- Very good slow

- Gets potentially twice as much value from some items, and some other items get almost an infinite value (diffusal, BKB)

- Good lane sustain after level 6 with just a salve and a mango

His weaknesses are :

- No flashfarm, his only farm accelerators are midas and necro. In particular, no way of pushing out quickly. This also means no counterpush.

- Horrible stat gains, in particular he gets very squishy come mid game because he doesn’t really build HP items apart from Necro

- Easy to shut down in lane

- Doesn’t play well from behind

- Very long cooldown on Magnetic Field

- No way of cancelling TPs

- Pretty bad in 5-man engagements

- Weak to initiation.

He is a situationnal pick. IMHO Zet is a very good pickup when the enemy team has low waveclear/split pushing power (no hero like Keeper of the Light, Nature’s Prophet…) and are in general weak to split push, and on top of that has heroes that don’t want to build MKB (example : Slark). He works well with natural mek carriers and heroes with a very big 5 man presence to make up for his lack of teamfight capabilities like Enigma, Tide, Brewmaster, Silencer…

I always go safe lane, but some players go mid. You can not really send him to any other lane because he needs a very good start. You always want Midas early on, then usually it’s necro 3 into BoTs. After that, it’s BKB, AC, Deso, Diffusal, Manta… **Keep a salve and a mango with you** ! When you use Double, share the salve and the mango to your main hero in order to keep you at full HP and high mana. Spam your ult whenever you can, you need to put that midas to use.

Undy’s main weakness is his lack of armor (3 base armor and the worst agi gain in the game) but OD doesn’t abuse it at all.",2016-03-02 09:26:39+00:00,d0kj8kp,3.0,t1_d0kd06k,16431.0,learndota2
3549,"There is a lot of stuff that works well against OD. As a filthy OD spammer, here are a few thoughts on how to play against him.

- **Hero matchups** : A lot of heroes work well against him. Off the top of my head : nyx, pugna, pa, ck, legion, ursa, silencer, sky, night stalker, troll, meepo, undying. Avoid heroes like wk, am, slark, clinkz. Basically, evasion, manfighting abilities and silences destroy him. Also anything that jumps on him and kills him.

- **Items** : The standout item is BKB of course. The only thing in OD’s kit that goes through BKB is his ult’s mana burn.

- **Playstyle** : OD has a weird spiking. He is at his strongest from level 8 or so until level 11, then very slowly levels down. He is, however, very weak compared to any other mid in the late game because of his inherent weakness to BKB. Any carry can easily fight him with even a 5 second BKB come late game. He also sucks at pushing and has no HP regen, so he is kind of bad at farming too (that’s why I experimented with a Vlad’s build on him). He is really good at killing heroes in the midgame.

With that in mind, you can pick stuff that builds BKB naturally and will naturally tend to manfight him, or you can pick really strong 5-man in the midgame, or you can just force it late. Consider a BKB on everyone against him, it really kills this hero’s impact.

Also a few tips :

- If OD has BKB up, he can not self astral.

- He is gankable early because of how squishy he is. In fact he is gankable during the whole game.

- It’s very easy to throw pubs when you play heroes that are only good at scoring kills.",2016-03-01 22:59:40+00:00,d0jywya,1.0,t3_48j042,1817.0,learndota2

3556,"You have to change your mindset.

You **will** lose games because of bad teammates. You will lose games because your team forced you to first pick OD and you got counterpicked to oblivion, then despite the focus the enemy team had on you your team didn’t do anything. You will lose games because your Clinkz decided to rush Orchid like an idiot, instead of doing the normal build (Soul Ring - Basi - Treads - Medallion - Deso). You will lose games because your necro went for the classic 45-minute radiance. You will lose games because your lion refused to believe blink existed and instead went for Aghs-dagon 5. I just had 2 of these games last night, which ended my winstreak promptly.

MMR grinding is about endurance. It’s about consistency. If you play cores, try to :

- Play decently no matter your matchups, don’t die over 5 times in the first 30 minutes

- Watch your goddamned minimap

- Learn to last hit

- Get your item timings correctly, and do it consistently.

If you pick support, use your brain when you ward. Don’t just blindly ward rune spots. Any rune spot is okay **as long as you know why you are using it**. Also, don’t ward your own jungle in general, it’s too defensive. Ward its entrances if you really need to. Don’t die, get a TP very early, Watch your map again.

As long as you win more than 50% of your games, you will climb. I calibrated at 1301 MMR in 2013, and didn’t play ranked for 1 year. Now I’m 2.8k, and rising.

3584,"Here is my (perfect) record on Elder Titan, if you want to have a look : http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?hero=elder-titan

I play him as a support, most of the time, as a 4/5 depending on the game. Elder Titan can benefit from farm, but he can definitely function with only levels IMHO.

There are 2 skill builds, and these serve completely different purposes :

- The agressive laning build. It’s more suited for a pos 4 titan, and better for lane domination and early game presence. The build is 3-4-0-1 at level 8, then you start taking points into your aura. You should be at 3-4-2-2 at level 11, then max aura, then stomp, then take ult at 16. The reason you only need 3 points in stomp is that your ult takes 3.14 seconds (Pi) to set up and level 3 stomp sleeps for 3 seconds.

- The more defensive build. It’s more suited for you if you picked ET as a counterpick to their carry (Drow, PL, Terrorblade, Morph…), and it’s a little bit better if you don’t think you will get many levels, and you don’t have many opportunities to get agressive. It’s less greedy. For example, you can do it if you lane with a Spectre against someone like Dark Seer. The build is 3-1-1-1 at level 6, then max aura, then max stomp (4-1-4-2 by level 11), then max spirit last.

As for builds, as a support you need 2 items and these are Tranquil boots + Soul Ring/Urn. Afterwards, your openings vary. You can build Eul’s (setup for your combo) if you are very agressive, Agh’s if you have setup for your combo (eg bane in your team) and you need a disarm, Aether Lens if you are confident in your ability to land your ults or you have setup, Crest if you want your carry to be even more advantaged in manfights, Glimmer Cape if you need to save someone…

The nice thing about ET as a support is that even without items, he has 10000000 HP and almost as much movespeed with a spirit buff. He is a king of rosh fights. And he has one of the best skills in the late game. Natural Order is absolutely brutal vs heroes that love stats, it can remove up to 30 armor if you play vs someone like Morph or a Slark with a lot of essence shift stacks. He breaks the rules of the game as well, and he makes every enemy level 1. 

In lane, use your huge right click damage with a spirit buff (+ bonus MS) to bully enemies. Try to make your spirit go through enemies, lane creeps, and jungle camps. Be careful with aggro, as you are melee. Get levels if you can and don’t rotate too much. Level 6 is all you need to be useful on this hero, but you scale incredibly well with levels as a support.

In fights, your behavior is very simple. Send your spirit, and stick on to an enemy that’s focused, then move on the backlines and try to stomp them into an ult when they come to help, in general. **Your spirit has flying vision**, which is a godsend against heroes with escapes. For your ult, try to place him in tight areas like Rosh pit, the stairs near ancients on both sides, jungle entrances… Any choke point. Use stomp on those who are not focused. It’s not a big deal if you don’t land it, you can use it to zone.

In general, as a support, he is super underrated IMHO.

If you want to play a core Elder Titan, the #1 ET on dotabuff (keyser) plays him in the offlane and goes Shadow Blade-dagon, and gets pickoffs. I don’t know how he plays it exactly.",2016-02-29 10:46:26+00:00,d0hx6fh,1.0,t3_488zub,12968.0,learndota2

3598,"Visage is my 4th most played hero ! Here is my record on him. I have spammed him a lot lately, especially with the Drow Visage combo : http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?hero=visage

I love this hero. Even though his playstyle doesn’t change much from game to game, he never gets boring. I play him as a 3/4.

Starting the game : **make sure your team has another support that is not greedy (aka Venge, Lich, Chen, Ench…)**. Visage is a greedy hero who can not afford to buy a lot of wards. Don’t pick Visage into heroes like these :

- Treant Protector (unkillable, and Living Armor negates your birds’ damage which doesn’t let your Soul Assumption charge up)

- Phoenix (unkillable because of supernova and your birds’ attacks don’t count on the egg)

- Medusa (tanky and split shot wrecks your birds)

- Phantom Lancer (jumps on you and you don’t have any way to respond to him.

- Undying (zombies’ attacks can kill birds, and very hard to fight into)

- Slark (jumps on you)

Heroes that can on paper should counter you but you have ways to deal with them are :

- Ember Spirit

- Gyro

- Spectre

- AM

- And some others.

After you picked your Visage, buy your starting items. Usually I buy 2 wards, a RoP, Tango, Salve, Mango, Clarity. Then go on any side lane and start doing normal support things (zoning, pulling…). Try to have XP, but of course don’t stand behind your carry in lane because it’s really bad (it’s not visage-specific either). Try to get kills around your level 3 (soul assumption or grave chill level 2), your level 6 (familiars) or your level 7/8 (soul assumption maxed), these are your power peaks. Don’t roam too much early on, Visage needs XP especially if you play with a Drow on your team.

Skill build : General skill build is 12232423334111Stats4, with 1 being your first spell (Grave Chill) and so on. I have seen a lot of pros going for 1213242234311Stats4, which is on paper better (Cloak gets a LOT better at level 3 compared to level 2, and the difference between level 3 and 4 is negligible, which justifies getting +1s in Chill. Not to mention your +65 damage on Soul Assumption at level 5 sometimes doesn’t matter compared to 1 more second of slow.). I didn’t try this, however. You can have a bit of variation around this build ; in general, here are the rules that you should follow : 

- The greedier you are, the earlier you should have a point in Cloak (not more than one point until you have Assumption maxed though)

- Always get familiars up whenever you can, of course

- Always max Soul Assumption first, obviously.

Item build : There are 2 ways to build Visage : with mek and without mek. Pros tend to build him mekless, but I think going for Mek works better in pubs because often your team will pick carries instead of utility heroes, and even if your team picks someone like Enigma he will try to pretend mek doesn’t exist and do stupid shit like getting blink dagger first.

- **With mek** : In this case, your boots of choice are arcanes. Normally, you are building your items in this order : **Boots-Headdress-Arcanes-Mek**. After that, you can build medallion but it’s not mandatory. If you don’t, go straight agh’s. Agh’s adds more pushing power and medallion gives better rosh potential and better damage on a single target. Medallion is scarier when you snowball but less good if you don’t. After agh’s, you can go for Solar Crest (if you went for medallion before), or Greaves. From there, it’s situationnal. Items like Pipe, Atos, Eul’s, Ghost, AC, Hex work.

- **Mekless** : In this case, you should build tranquils. When you don’t go for mek, you are going for a build which lets you get pickoffs very easily but is also weaker at pushing. You should get Medallion after Tranquils, and after that either Agh’s or Crest, but you will complete both eventually. Then go for your extension/luxury items : Pipe, Atos, Eul’s, Ghost, AC, Hex…

Playstyle : Very straightforward. At the beginning of the game, zone the enemy offlaner and pull if you can and if you have a good reason to pull. Try to get kills with Soul Assumption. When you are level 6 and the carry leaves the lane to farm the jungle, start farming the lane. As soon as it gets pushed in pretty far, you should only farm with birds. Try to apply pressure to the tower and hit it with birds whenever you can. After you take down a tower, usually you want to rotate mid and rinse and repeat. When all T1 towers are taken, you can force a fight aronud T2 towers, get rosh with a smoke, or get pickoffs depending on the game, but it opens up more for your possibilities. You can farm your jungle a bit with birds and hero.

Tips :

- When you farm with birds only, be careful. Birds are very susceptible to creep attacks. If in doubt, stomp your birds.

- Use your damage charges to hit towers with your birds when they farm under tower. The tower attacks birds last, after catapults.

- When you play with a Drow, try to take an objective every time you have the aura up. Birds do a stupidly high amount of damage even when drow has no agi items, with just level 4 aura + 1 or 2 points in marksmanship.

- Don’t stomp when you have damages charges if you can avoid it.

Have fun stomping games with him. He is very good at low MMRs because no one plays against him so people make stupid decisions against him. I had a few games when a necro opened on me with an ult, even though I had 80% HP with 4 cloak charges. Visage is also good at pushing, which is really good at low MMR because people tend to be allergic to towers there.

3599,"I play a lot of AM : http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?hero=anti-mage

So first, in terms of hero matchups. My biggest fears as AM are Disruptor (glimpse into field storm is unavoidable until you get manta, and even with manta it’s not easy to dodge), **Spirit Breaker** (FUCK THIS GUY, 17% my ass. He is also unkillable and charges you globally), Phantom Assassin (AM doesn’t really like wearing MKB, and crit hurts), and to a lesser extent carries like Tiny, Sven, Ursa Troll or Jugg who don’t really care about mana and have a lot of physical burst + ways to manfight you.

AM is really not OP. He is situationnal, squishy, very weak to anti-BKB, weak at manfighting compared to the likes of Sven, Ursa, or even PA/PL, very weak to anti-split push, very weak to silences, and reliant on getting a lead. He can also be outcarried and relies on a timing around 35 minutes when he is 6-slotted and the enemies are not to win the game.",2016-02-28 15:09:23+00:00,d0gwj4h,1.0,t3_4818o3,17322.0,learndota2
3600,"&gt; He's not allowed to farm (harder in lower skill games)

Actually, in the early game, the lower skilled my opponents were, the harder it was to farm early, in general. People at low MMR are willing to sacrifice 2 minutes of farm on their mid to have a 4-man party on the safe lane while you hate your life and blink in trees.

It gets a lot easier once you get your BF, but beforehand, you will have a rough game, at low levels. My average BF timing is around 18 with Treads, even though I don’t miss many CS on AM now after 50 games with him. People just sit in your lane and wear signs with « FUCK AM » on it, in my games as AM.

Also, my worst nightmare as AM is Spirit breaker. Fuck this hero. He is very good against splitpushers like AM, has BKB piercing lockdown which AM is weak to, and even though he deals mostly magic damage, AM has low HP so he still dies to him. Not to mention he is really tanky and doesn’t need mana, so he is not really killable.",2016-02-28 15:03:13+00:00,d0gwd2f,2.0,t1_d0grnr7,16220.0,learndota2
3601,"**Spirit Breaker**, Queen of Pain and Anti-Mage and OD work really well against him. PL and Tiny are also good choices. But when Slark gets a shadow blade, that means that in general his team is going to be very weak in 5 man engagements (unless you got outdrafted really hard, in which case Slark doesn’t matter). So when he gets Shadow Blade, 5-man, take roshan and take towers. If you have anything with Blink, use him to split push. Slark has no way to function against blink heroes.

Slark is pretty bad in general, if you play dota normally you should not have many issues with him. He is weak against split pushing, but also weak at 5-manning because his stats are so bad especially if he goes for the classic « fuck HP » build. He is also pretty weak in the late game, even if you compare him to carries like AM because he is so squishy and it gets easier and easier to burst him down.

Also, try to engage on him in between dark pacts. That is especially true for heroes like Earthshaker. There is a 4 second or so delay between dark pacts, abuse it to burst him down.

But most importantly, you should try to split push, and have a bit of coordination. The reason why Slark works in pubs is that he abuses lack of coordination, and also because AM, QoP, etc are not played well in general.",2016-02-28 14:52:27+00:00,d0gw2gq,1.0,t3_481y1f,5573.0,learndota2

3603,"If you have a good start as Visage as a support, what you should do normally is farm a lane, staying close to your tower. Whenever the lane pushes, use your familiars to last hit. I do it most of the time on my safe lane. Then when you take a tower, either rotate to another lane (like mid) or group up and take fights. Visage’s playstyle doesn’t change much from game to game.

Also, a bit of advice regarding this particular match :

- Try to avoid picking Visage into mobile heroes like Storm or Weaver, mobile heroes are a huge pain in the ass to deal with. You are decent vs heroes like QoP because you can abuse a qop blinking in easily and qop doesn’t have a lot of attack speed for your birds, but weaver, storm, PL, Slark and the like are painful to deal with. 

- You should have convinced your drow that drums existed, she should have bought drums. Not you. (WTF was she buying ? Shadow blade + raw damage items with a Visage in your team as drow ?????? Was she trolling ?). In this game, you should have gone for Mek and arcanes I believe. This item combo is pretty nice on Visage in a lot of games because he benefits from Mek a lot. Visage is in the centre of teamfights, and adding armor to him is always beneficial, on a hero with a very high strength gain. After you get your mek, you can group up and take towers, then take rosh with medallion if you decide to go for it, then end the game.

- You have absolutely no excuse to have less than 1 CS/min, if you are not above 20 kills or if the game didn’t last more than 35-40 minutes. Again, take safe farm. Visage is pretty decent to farm with as a support, because he can use his birds to farm. That comes down to playstyle, mostly.

- **0 tower damage ?????** What the actual hell. You have birds, and they are targetted by towers last, after catapults. Use the first damage charges to hit towers when you farm under an enemy tower with familiars ! In an average game, you should get around 2k tower damage. With a drow on your team, it usually goes up to 5k tower damage if the drow is not trying to play dota without arms.

- Against TA, use birds to scout roshan. In particular against 3 desos (???)

- Oh and I forgot… Visage is a pretty good gem carrier. He is tanky, and birds give flying vision. In this game you probably needed one.

So overall, 5 man push, don’t pick Visage when you face slippery heroes, and use birds to hit towers. You had the superior draft, IMHO, but your team and you refused to play dota normally and you lost because of that. You litterally just needed to group around drow aura and push with familiars. And NS needed useful items, not helm+vanguard. And void needed to start believing that BKB is an item and realised that Daedalus first is both greedy and ineffective.

Wat

If you buy a Shadow Blade on WD, people buy dust and sentries against you anyway, I don’t see the point in doing it.

The problem with Arcane boots on WD is that you are very squishy and often you are forced to use your heal on yourself, which completely negates your mana gains. Also, you are already high on mana pool because skipping Maledict is very common on WD, and also your spells don’t cost much. It’s much more beneficial to have more armor from Tranquils (you lack armor on this hero !), with a wand to make you more surviveable. After you get point booster, wand, and tranquils, you are already tanky.

And I hold on to my point. Sblade/Glimmer is not worth much when the enemy team has someone like Jakiro, Visage, Lion, Nyx, or even Enigma. In fact, any AoE stun will ruin you.

(Link to the original game if you want to check : https://yasp.co/matches/2173028214)

Below 2k, you need to pick heroes that can carry games and are not reliant on their team to do so. You don’t necessarily need to play the « Mute all-chat » lycan every game, but don’t rely on your team to carry you to victory every game, or you might win MMR but it will be slow and painful. Also, pick heroes that can do something during pushes ! Your team will sometimes decide that enemy towers are monuments and that they can not attack them. If it’s the case, you need to push by yourself.

For core heroes, I would suggest :

- Shadow Fiend

- QoP

- Windranger

- Clinkz

- Gyrocopter

- Sven

- Luna

- Necrophos

- Wraith King

- Lycan

- Spectre (bad push, but abuses the tendancy of this bracket to throw)

- Ursa (bad pushing power, but really good at killing stuff and getting an early lead)

Avoid heroes that force your team to play in a certain way, or have no pushing and no solo killing potential :

- Anti-Mage

- Clockwerk

- Phantom Lancer (also because he sucks ATM)

- Puck

For supports, it’s the same deal. Try to pick heroes that work by themselves and don’t rely on their team. The other option is « Keep your retards alive », a pretty decent strat as well. Pick :

- Witch Doctor

- Visage

- Naga siren

- Omninight

- Lich (normally bad in the late game, but very often the enemy team will not buy force staves)

- Enigma

- Elder Titan (vs drow/morphling/AM/PL…)

- Keeper of the light

- Dazzle

- Abaddon

Once again, avoid heroes that are bad at pushing, bad at killing stuff (unless they keep your idiots alive), require your team to play in a certain way, or requires your team to know how to abuse a lead. So avoid :

- Wisp

- Chen

- Bane

- etc.

And don’t expect anything from your team, but be ready to respond to their good plays with yours.

3636,"It’s extremely hard to tell because of many things :

- Hero matchups are not just « counterpicking ». Some matchups go either way, or a hero can have the advantage in the early game but then fall off. For example, Gyro vs Slark is in theory advantageous for the Slark, but in practice if Gyro plays correctly he is able to get a lead early and Slark is awful against early 5 man, which Gyro excels at. Same for Gyro vs PL/AM, or PA vs Spectre. In theory Spectre has the better matchup, but PA is much better at early fighting when the enemies don’t have MKB yet (which is also partially why BF on PA is extremely situationnal, but I’m getting offtopic).

- There are many different late games, depending on game time, how much people have farmed vs how much they fought, who has the lead, and also depending on heroes. In particular, heroes like Elder Titan change the rules of the game completely. If you go for a stat-heavy agi carry like Spectre or PL vs ET, suddenly, Spectre/PL becomes much weaker, even in the late game.

I think a more complete way to see it is in terms of power spikes. PL has a power spike when he gets drums+bots or vlads+bots early, then he has another when he gets diffusal, and afterwards a small spike every time he gets a big item (SnY, Manta, Skadi…). AM has a huge farming power spike once he gets BF, which gets amplified when he gets Vlad’s + Manta. Then he is extremely strong at ending games around 35 mins, when he is 6 slotted but the enemies are not. OD spikes around level 9 when he has drums/atos + Treads, but he starts falling off a bit when the enemies have BKB.

Visage :

- **Be sure your team has a second support that’s not greedy**, he will need to buy wards.

- Leech XP early and try to dual lane, Visage needs levels. You can put him in a trilane but if you don’t get actual kills with him or a decent start you will have a hard time.

- Don’t be afraid to take kills with Soul Assumption. In some of my games I had over 60% of my team’s kills. Visage scales incredibly with farm and the way SA works encourages to take kills with him.

- Get mek if no one else on your team wants. In this case you need Boots -&gt; Headdress -&gt; Arcanes -&gt; Mek -&gt; Med/Aghs.

Witch doctor :

- Starting items : courier, 2 wards, tangoes, salve, 2 clarities.

- Your next items are flying courier, boots, stick, then wand and tranquil boots. Don’t go for arcanes.

- After that, you go for BKB and agh’s. 95% of the time you should buy agh’s first.

- Don’t stop farming

- Put a lot of points in stats. Depending on the game, I usually go for 4-2-0-2 (level 11) into 4-4-0-3 (at level 16), skilling maledict at levels 17 or 22. Of course it depends on the game.

Luna :

- Save your skill point at level 4, until around 10 minutes in when you have aquila + treads + helm

- Push and stack ancients

- Don’t be afraid to use ult on 2 targets, when there are no creeps around. I use eclipse often to finish kills during the laning stage.

Clinkz :

- Get a fucking deso. Forget orchid. 

- Get a soul ring before level 6 so that as soon as you get level 6, you can farm the safe lane and the hard camp close to it.

- Learn to tread switch.

- Watch your minimap closely.

3654,"Dotabuff pl0x.

But speaking of better enemies than you, [I had such a game today](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/2170352796). I was OD, got solo killed by Tinker at least 2 or 3 times in lane. My farm was really low because I could not approach waves without my supports behind me. We tried to make the game as chaotic as we could, and I scrapped a bit of farm here and there but we started turning the game around once I got drums, and even more so after I got BKB. I went from something like 2/7/9 to 19/12/14, Tinker went from something like 16/0 to 23/8.

The keys to victory are :

- Positive attitude. In this game Timber encouraged from time to time and I did so too. It’s a skill and it wins games.

- Watch your map very closely and carefully. More checks = less deaths. Try to predict where the enemies are. Assess your threats. If you are playing AM with Treads/BF/Manta/Vlads/BKB and the only anti-BKB they have is batrider, that means when you see batrider on the map you can do whatever you want somewhere else, for example.

- Don’t tilt. I almost tilted this game, and I would have lost if I did.

But if you truly believe you are rated higher than your actual skill, don’t worry, you will drop in some time. It will be painful, but after tanking losses and MMR you will be placed at your level again. That being said, *use that time to learn*. The best way to learn is by playing against players that are a bit better than you (but not like 2.5k MMR more, of course, since it’s a world of difference).",2016-02-22 18:09:45+00:00,d09in1x,1.0,t3_471t2w,3375.0,learndota2

I max heal better because it's better offensively and defensively compared to maxing shield first. Heal has a longer range and gains 50 heal/magic damage per level. With tranquils and decent positionning, self damage does not matter too much. At levels 5-7, you can use 2 heals during an engagement which has a high impact at this level.

3661,"&gt; So my question is: Is he really at the weaker end of defensive supports, or is he still a viable niche pick?

Definitely. Here is my record on him, playing him mostly comboed in a dual lane with Weaver but sometimes with any hero : http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?hero=abaddon

&gt; What I feel 'lackluster' about him is his hyper-defensive skillset. He has a heal and a dispel in low cooldown, and he 'doesn't die' so it is comparatively safer to be reckless a bit and even get in the middle of the fight, which is generally discouraged for support heroes, but I think that is all;

That’s where you go wrong. Abaddon is good at 2 things in the early game : being hyper agressive and hyper defensive. If you go for my skill build where I take curse at level 2, you can really take advantage of a mispositionned enemy or invade the enemy jungle if they have something stupid like Lifestealer/Ursa jungle. Other than that, I kind of agree, but you forget an important point : one of abaddon’s strengths is that **you can never ever initiate on him, period**. It loses you the fight instantly. So you can abuse it to tickle the enemies with curse while they can not answer. Usually people are aware of this so they run, which is fine because in this case you can get a free tower. Abaddon has quite some agressive potential, and also applies psychological warfare. 

He is also one of the best heroes at extending fights, and one of the best counters there are to doom, beastmaster and to a lesser extent batrider. Because of his ult, he is also undoubtoubly the best « herp derp » initiator among supports, even better than Visage.

3681,"A greedy build is very generic, but it’s basically something risky because it turns you into a one-trick pony that’s easy to punish.

Let me give you some examples :

- **The Spectre build with Boots into Radiance straight away** : that’s a greedy build because it makes Spectre die in a moment’s notice and doesn’t really increase your farming speed at all, compared to a phase boots+aquila+morbid or phase boots+urn build. You might save 1 min on your radiance timing which is not very important most of the time and in turn you take a lot of risks.

- **Blink first instead of Mek first on Enigma**. Many players who do not play Enigma a lot don’t see this at first glance, but it’s actually incredibly greedy. The reason for that is that it completely destroys your first power spike of the game, which is around 8 minutes when you have mek + level 8 in an uncontested jungle, and you can get a free tower. By getting a blink first, you are willingly sacrificing your ability to get a tower and to be a threat and instead are banking on a teamfight occuring between the 8 and 15 minute mark where you will catch at least 3 people with BH and it won’t be cancelled. Once again, it’s extremely unlikely.

- **BKB first on a hero like Sven** : Now, BKB is a bit tricky of an item. As many people mentionned, it’s the « best game-losing item in the game ». What that means is that if you are playing a carry without flash farm (carries with flash farm include SF, Gyro, Luna), getting BKB first makes you forced to put it to a very good use. If you have a BKB, that’s 4k gold on an item that doesn’t help you farm and doesn’t help you push. If you can not make a good use of it in fights, not only did you ruin the beginning of your item progression, but you also ruined the end of your midgame and your late game because you will have a 5s bkb rather early.

Try me. 0€ for Mistblade + rider of avarice set.

&gt; I know that abaddon should be played as a support, but who wants to do that? I want to run at people and slay them. 

You do that too as a support abaddon, when your ult is up.

&gt; How should I be playing him? Should I be looking to fight more than I farm? I think I'll build drums and s&amp;y on him, maybe a radiance. Do you have any tips?

Your build is decent for a core abaddon, but in general AC &gt; radiance. In general try to build aura items on him, he wants to stay in the middle of fights and auras enhance his fighting presence.

I love abaddon and play him only as a support, with pretty good success in low level games. Take my advice with a grain of salt, but anyway here is my record on him : http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?hero=abaddon

Abaddon is a hero who is pretty flexible in nature. As a support, his core items are Tranquils and Soul Ring (or maybe urn, but i found urn to be a lot less useful these days). As a core, phase/vlad’s and you are good to go. Abaddon is a hero who excels at prolonged fights. So try to take the fight to your enemies and keep your dudes alive. If they have specifically a hero whom you counter (doom, beastmaster, batrider, bane…) use your shield on whomever gets ultied or disabled by these guys. As a core, I saw a lot of players recommending maxing shield then curse then heal, but as a support you should max heal, then shield, then stats, and keep only 1 point in curse until at least level 17+.

You can play abaddon as a carry and win a lot with it, it’s hard to play against abaddon in pubs because there is not much coordination involved. But I still believe his best role is support in an agressive dual lane, with a partner like Weaver, Viper, or even someone like Necrophos.",2016-02-12 18:40:40+00:00,czxlb65,1.0,t3_45fjbz,7465.0,learndota2

- Repeated nerfs. He was too strong in 6.84, but he got nerfs to his base int (sure, fine), Call Down (why not), and Rocket barrage (what the fuck ?). In 6.84, he had a winrate of around 51% and it decreased with every nerf he had.

- Many people don’t understand why Gyro is picked often and pick him as an AFK farming/split pushing carry. If you want to do that, pick TB, Morphling, Naga, or AM. Not gyro.

&gt; He can farm and push like none other.

That is wrong. He can farm quickly, sure, but many heroes can outfarm him (AM, SF, Luna…). He doesn’t have a lot of pushing power compared to other heroes played as carries.

The purpose of Gyro is to get ahead early and abuse his early peaks − level 6, level 7, level 11. You probably will notice upon playing Gyro that *a lot* of heroes have advantageous matchups against him. Here is a short list of carries that work well against Gyro : AM, PL, SF, Tiny, Slark, Queen of Pain, Bristleback, Sniper, Lifestealer, Medusa, Clinkz, Phantom Assassin. There are many more. Gyro is meant to take an early lead, and even if you manage to take a lead with him you can sometimes not abuse your advantage at all if you are not in a competitive setting.

I also love the Visage/Venge combo, these heroes have a lot of synergy together (Venge is a very good 5, both scale with farm, -armor to go with birds…)

1. For mid and offlane, ideally you want heroes who are able to split the map and prevent teamfights from happening, either because of their huge team fight presence or because of their split pushing power. So heroes like DS, bat or Nature’s Prophet for offlane for example work, but you can get fancy and pick things like Elder Titan. For mid, I would look for heroes like Ember, TA, or even QoP. You don’t need pushers on your team, Visage birds take out towers by themselves with Drow aura if Drow builds correctly (aka mass agility). Honestly, you don’t even need specific heroes for that to work. It works with pretty much every draft.

2. If you play against a drow-visage draft, one thing you need to realise is : *the most important part of the combo by far is visage*. For example, [in this game](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1478247001), I have the highest tower damage in my team, and that’s because of birds. In a lot of games as Visage with Drow, you end up with the highest hero damage and tower damage on your team. So **pick heroes that kill birds**. The worst matchup for Visage is probably Medusa because she is so hard to play around. Then there are heroes like Ember, Gyro, Undying (zombies spawn under birds !), PL, and Slark to some extent. Avoid picking squishy heroes like Ench or Skywrath Mage. Pick heroes with counterpush. If you have a NP on your team who spams his ult, it’s extremely good vs Visage because Visage is not good at clearing waves, he is just good at hitting towers.",2016-02-11 12:16:20+00:00,czvx5h4,1.0,t3_458fim,1021.0,learndota2

It indirectly does. It doesn’t give directly the bonus gold or XP from midas, but it allows you to farm the hard camp close to your lane right at level 6 which boosts your early farm and buffs up your damage which allows you to farm quickly. Also, the HP bonus helps with farming dangerous areas.

Your uptime is actually bigger than 100% at level 3.

I don’t think it’s that bad to get a helm of the dominator at all, even with the change it got.

Otherwise, I’m too lazy to write it again, so here is a copy paste of my last post about him :

I played a Clinkz game one or two days ago, if you want to look : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/2107268639

It was a good example of how to do in a very hard Clinkz game. The enemy team had a lot of bullshit tanky ungankable heroes, which is really bad for a ganking carry, and decent 5 man. This game shows how you can deal with these sort of lineups by farming the enemy jungle and split pushing, sometimes fighting with your team when necessary.

Clinkz is one of my favorite carries to play in solo games because not only is he a fun hero, he is also rewarding to play well, demanding a bit mechanically, he is independant of his team, and he trains your map awareness a lot. In my opinion, he is a very good carry to learn the playstyle of gankers.

- **Early game and starting items** : It depends on the game, but usually you don’t need to take a lot of HP regen if you think you will be left in a 1v1 matchup or you have supports in lane. If you want to go mid or offlane, you need to take 2 sets of regen, though (so salve+tangoes). Mango is also really good on him because of Clinkz’s reliance on mana and his squishiness before level 6. In the game I linked, I went for RoP+stick in my starting items and no mango because I was vs a bristleback. Adapt to the situation.

In lane, you want to last hit and trade hits with Searing Arrows. Clinkz has a really bad attack animation and starting damage, but Searing Arrows mitigates for the damage part a little bit after level 3. Don’t worry about denying that much, just harass with searing arrows whenever you see an opportunity and you won’t miss a CS from that.

- **Skill build :** You pretty much always want Searing Arrows maxed first. They give you the most mana efficient and reliable damage. The other rule is to always take ult whenever you can. Other than that, your skill build varies a bit but not much.

At level 1, keep your skill point. You can level Skeleton Walk first, but keep in mind that even if you get the rune, you will have a hard time getting your first creeps if you are contested, until level 2. It’s worth it if you can snatch the rune from the enemy mid laner. At level 2, keep your skill point if you skilled arrows at level 1, otherwise take searing arrows. At level 5 you should have a 0-3-1-0 skill build with 1 free skill point. If you have a kill opportunity in lane, skill strafe and use it. At level 6, take your ulti, at level 7 max out searing arrows and at level 8 start taking points in strafe. You should have a 1-4-2-1 by level 8.

After level 8, it varies a bit, but usually I leave Skeleton Walk at level 2 and max strafe second, taking ult at 11, because *Skeleton walk is a very good value point at level 2 because level 2 doubles the MS bonus*. Then I max out skeleton walk by 14 and take ult at 16. So here is what your skill build looks like :

If you had no kill opportunity in lane : 23232421114122Stats4

If you had a kill opportunity in lane : 23212423114122Stats4

- **Item build** : This is where a lot of Clinkz players at low levels go wrong. The items you want to build in 90% of games are **Treads, Soul Ring, Medallion** in the early game, and then you will grab your first big item : **Desolator**. A lot of players go for Orchid but it’s a lot safer to build deso. Deso gives you better push, more farming speed, and a lot more damage even if you factor in orchid’s damage amp. Also, with medallion’s mana regen, soul ring, and tread switching, you will never run out of mana. You can also include a **Ring of Basillius/Ring of Aquila** as an early game item (in my game I skipped it because I had a CM). After deso, your next items are **Dragon Lance and Solar Crest (90% of the time), OR diffusal blade**. I go for diffusal blade against Medusa or Omni, or if we need more catch. Other than that, dragon lance and crest. In general, build Dragon Lance before if you are focused on pushing, and Solar Crest before if you are focused on ganking. But build both. After that, you normally **disassemble both Crest and Dragon Lance for Butterfly and BKB** (use the talisman and the quarterstaff for bfly, and the ogre club for bkb. Keep your medallion). After that, adapt to what you need. Special mention to these items for the late game : Hex, Blink, Manta (dispel those pesky dusts), MKB, Daedalus.

- **Playstyle** : In lane, take last hits and trade harass, you will generally come out on top if you trade intelligently. After your level 6, start doing jungle rotations and look to pressure the tower whenever you have your ult buff. After that, you should have Treads-SR-medallion. Rotate to mid or offlane and go in the enemy jungle to keep on spamming your ult and stay off the map, while creating space for your team. Move out of the enemy jungle whenever you see a gank opportunity or a pushed out lane. **Whenever you gank, always look to push a tower next.** It’s important because it’s one of Clinkz’s biggest strengths : pushing. Join fights if you have to, but try to split the enemy team. Especially after Dragon Lance, you rat really well and without much risks.

- **Tips and Tricks** :

1. Try to get last hits without Searing Arrows if you are uncontested to save mana for actual fights.

2. If the enemy mid is sitting on top of a rune, what you can do to get it before him is the following : go invis, then spam right click and stop command on the rune spawn (because you might attack the enemy hero by mistake !), and you should be able to get it whenever the rune spawns.

3. If you are facing a dual lane, harass the lowest armor hero first, or the melee hero.

4. When you look to pressure a tower early and your creep wave is hitting it, *don’t right click the tower with Searing arrows on autocast*! Use your arrows manually. By using them manually you will be targeted last by the tower, allowing you to get a lot more damage in.

5. **Look at your map and check enemy inventories**. But mostly look at your map. Try to predict where the enemy warded. That’s where being a support player comes in handy for playing this hero.

6. Don’t waste Strafe in fights. Use it for important targets. That depends on the game, but the obvious example is that you don’t want to target an enemy bristleback or tide with it. Instead, targetting an enemy Dusa or SF does a lot more good.

7. Tread switching is very important on your hero. When you use your ult, the most efficient way to use SR with it is the following : switch to strength treads, pop soul ring, switch to int treads, use ult on a big creep that’s also full HP.

8. You can tread switch back to agi during skeleton walk’s fade time, but you don’t need it unless you use skeleton walk to farm and you know there is no enemy so you won’t have to go out of invis by strafing.

9. Don’t drag out the game too much, Clinkz is a bit weak in the late game in comparison to other carries, a bit like Anti-Mage. Use your peaks, which are as you get deso and to a lesser extent as you get bfly+bkb.

10. Your killing combo with medallion is pop out of invis by using medallion on an enemy and strafing, then right click. You don’t need to worry about any bonus damage if you come out of invis, skeleton walk doesn’t allow that.

11. Fight with your ulti up. ALWAYS. Delaying your entrance to a fight for 20s just because you have to eat a creep is worth it 99% of the time.

Any combination of greedy supports and pushing heroes works with this. If you want to push hard, and you are both support players, and the team picked self sustaining carries like Clinkz or DK, you can play support combos like Shadow Shaman/Enigma. 

Other combos that are either really good at pushing or good at ending games decently early :

- Abaddon/Weaver

- Undy/anything

- Lycan/Visage (Howl works on visage familiars !)

- Drow/Visage

- Luna/Venge (2 auras)

- Gyro/Dark Seer (teamfight combo, great at farming and getting ahead)

3765,"I play CM from time to time (not much lately, though), and here are my suggestions :

- Starting the game : In general, buy courier, wards, Tangoes, 2 clarities, and 2 branches. The reason why you want so little HP regen is because you won’t need too much of it. Keep your skill point at level 1 just in case you need crystal nova to set up a kill, but in general take frost bite.

- Laning : Assess in which kind of lane you will be. Is it a 2v1 or 2v2 where the enemy lane is weak enough to get killed by crystal nova + frost bite + your ally’s abilities (example : you play CM-Jugg vs a solo necrophos) ? In this case try to set up a kill whenever you can. In all other cases, farm the jungle from level 1. Don’t try to zone, CM is pretty bad at zoning and trading with offlaners because of her bad damage, movespeed, animation, and armor. Farming the jungle is pretty easy on maiden : aggro a hard camp, kite them for a few seconds, then freeze the big creep and auto attack him until it dies. It’s mana intensive in the early game, but that’s the reason why you get 2 clarities. If you spend your whole time jungling, don’t forget to stack medium or large camps to farm them at level 6.

- Mid game : It starts when you get your first big item : Usually I get either Force Staff or Agh’s first. Glimmer is a bit greedy as a first item because you don’t have a lot of mana at level 6 if you have glimmer. If you were jungling, use your first ult on a stack to clear it, it does massive AoE damage. It’s pretty simple to play CM in the mid game : stay back in fights, spam Crystal Nova, and towards the end of fights or to secure an important kill without dying, force in and ult.

- Late game : Pretty much the same thing as in the mid game. At this point you should have agh’s + a lot of survivability items like BKB, ghost scepter, glimmer cape… Once again, prioritizing your targets is key.

3795,"- In your last ember game, you had 150 CS at 37 minutes. That’s not extremely bad, but decently bad. You were running around killing people a lot, I assume, and you did it well. So maybe I should not nitpick too much. 45 last hits at 10 minutes is okay. However, you farmed a grand total of 1 jungle creep, which is definitely not enough. I know Ember tends to split push really hard after BoTs so your neutrals killed should be pretty low, but having 1 is not enough because you should be getting around 15-20 during the laning phase, before BoTs.

- Nice KDA, HD and TD stats during your last spectre game ! But less than 300 last hits in an hour is slightly below where you should be on a Spec. Depending on how hard you got shutdown, this varies, but in general 360-400 in an hour is a decent benchmark. Once again, you killed very few neutrals. That’s partially because you didn’t build either Vanguard or aquila+morbid which allow you to farm the jungle. Your radiance would have come at the same time with this kind of build and 100+ neutrals killed. Seeing your build, I would rather have gone for aquila+morbid in your game. 

- 16 deaths in your last Luna game ? What ? I know she is squishy, but come on… In this game your LH at 10 minutes are really low (21), and you didn’t build BKB at all which also explains why you had so many deaths. Luna is IMHO one of the few heroes on which you can buy a very early BKB without it being risky (the others being SF and Gyro, and maybe a few that I forgot). In general, my item build as Luna is Treads, Aquila, Helm, then either Drums, casual Yasha, or BKB. If I go for drums I always get BKB right after, but if I go for yasha sometimes I get manta into BKB. And once again, your neutrals killed are really low. Your CS in general is really low. As a Luna, it’s very important to stack ancients and to farm the jungle with Moon Glaives because it’s partially what makes her so strong, it’s her farming/pushing speed. Here is an example of what you can do on a Luna, in terms of farm : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1676288648

So it looks like you are playing fine but taking a lot of risks without even noticing it. One thing many 1k players (not necessarily you, but a lot of them) tend to underevaluate farming, and especially farming the enemy jungle, and not use farming effectively at all. It’s either :

- They spend too much time farming, because they picked LC and went into the jungle

- They spend absolutely no time farming because they picked any other hero and they feel the urge to go mid and jerk off with their team.

Farming the jungle is something you should do in the early game, especially if you have a free lane. After that, if you have a hero with escapes, you can split push and farm agressively. Otherwise farm safe places. **Always be thinking of how you could kill the most creeps and kill the creeps as close to the enemy base as possible without dying as a carry**. It’s important to do that. One thing you will quickly realise is that better farming leads to more consistency.",2016-02-07 18:00:32+00:00,czr844c,3.0,t1_czqv6yi,38090.0,learndota2

- « Visage works best with nukers » : It’s the opposite, Visage works best with -armor lineups IMHO, and with drafts that revolve around physical damage. Special mention to the support combo Visage-Venge, which works really well with her -armor in conjonction with familiars, Venge needs very low farm and can play 5 very well… A lot of nice things about these heroes together.

- « Visage needs mek » : Although mek is nice on Visage, it’s not mandatory, especially if you don’t get ahead early on.

- « Visage does no damage » : Read his skills if you think that

He is one of the supports with the highest damage potential in the game, up there along with WD and Skywrath Mage. Try to pick him when the enemy team has low armor heroes, the enemy team has no Gyro/Dusa/Undy/Ember, when your team has another support that needs no farm, and of course pick him when you have a drow or a lycan on your team.

3808,"&gt; Also what other heroes play similarly to NS; in that they excel from ganking and can farm and **carry from hero kills and not CSing**

Supports and nothing else, pretty much. Every hero in the game needs at least a bit of farm if he needs to carry the game.

For your questions about NS, here is my dotabuff if you want to have a look : http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?hero=night-stalker

- For starters, skip Vanguard.

- Get at least 1 lifesteal/sustain item, it’s necessary. The reason for that is that you want to spend a lot of time farming the jungle or the enemy jungle. Night Stalker is really scary when he is not showing, and farming the jungle creates pressure while farming.

- Don’t get agh’s if you want to play him as a core, unless it’s an offlaner and even then it’s situationnal.

- Don’t get Heart on NS, it doesn’t do much on this hero and you are extremely tanky already.

My 6-slotted build on NS is usually something like BoTs/Phase-BKB-AC-Abyssal-SnY-MKB/Daedalus. Playstyle on this kind of NS is pretty straightforward : you go to any lane, farm a quick bottle by voiding creeps if it’s not safe. Once you have bottle and 4 min hits, look to trade hits with your opponents. At that point, if you are offlaning, you can set up ganks, but don’t feel obligated to do that until you have your morbid mask. Same if you are mid, you can rotate but in general it’s safer to stay mid and pressure the tower if the enemy leaves. Get a TP during your first night time too. Use your ult every time the day will last longer than 50 seconds. Farm the jungle and try to split your enemies, then gank them. Transition your ganks into pushes. Repeat. Win the game.

If you like NS, you might like Clinkz. I did a few posts on him too, I can try to teach you stuff about this hero.",2016-02-05 18:16:41+00:00,czp2jk2,1.0,t3_44bv47,2435.0,learndota2

If you are 11/0/6, it is realistic. The thing I’m wondering about is why that game was not over. And 200-300 in an hour for a carry that has waveform, naturally high AS, Replicate, and buys BoTs early is really bad.

I agree with the rest of your tips. Also, something I wanted to add to yours :

- Level up morph in the fountain and morph to get easy CS in lane (usually I stay around 11-13 str, since I buy items like Circlet in my starting items)

- Manipulate aggro to get CS

- Spam Replicate *every chance you get*. Creating the illusion costs 25 mana, and then you can manage your mana so as to have at least 150 every time. It’s also very useful in combination with BoTs, you can use it like an Ember Spirit would use his own ult in some ways (free bottle refill in the early game, split pushing and having the illusion farm camps in the jungle…)

The best thing about playing ET as a support is that since no one plays him, everyone misestimates how much damage you deal with a spirit buff.

My build is Soul Ring+Tranquils, and then any item. Glimmer, Crest, Agh’s… But I didn’t try Aether Lens on him yet. As a support I don’t think you would really need this, you stand so far back from fights anyway.

Skill build wise, before I did a 4-4-4-1 skill build by level 13, maxing ult at either level 19ish or level 25. Now I would think a 2-4-3-2 build by level 11 is all around the best idea, then max aura followed by stomp and ult at 16. 

In lane, I zone a bit with spirit and try to pull towards a hard camp when I can and then rotate as soon as I get Echo Stomp (around levels 3-5). In fights in the mid game, I stay far back and send my spirit to sit around focused enemies. Towards the end of fights I try to stun the backlines with echo stomp, then use ult on those guys.

Playing heroes like Undy or Lycan feels like it makes the game a lot easier at the moment for me, and I experienced a lot of deathball games myself as well.

Also, things tend to get amplified a lot in pro games, which is why you saw a lot of turtling strats in 6.83 because turtling was slightly favored at that time, for example (but pushing early was also viable, secret did that with success in 6.83). In this patch, the fact that pushing heroes got buffed and the fact that good players know how to take advantage of early advantages put deathball back in the meta.

3906,"&gt; Thanks! What actually happens when its auto-cast? 

Each of your auto attacks will be a searing arrow, so you will spend 10 mana for +80 damage (if it’s level 4).

&gt; 10CS or a 100CS?? CS means creep score. That means if you last hit 10 creeps in 10 minutes you won the lane! I'am still a noob but isnt that nothing :/

That means nothing in an even lane ! If you are 1v3, that means the enemy team is putting a lot of pressure and sacrificing a lot to shut you down in particular. If the enemy team is not getting enough of a lane they should stomp, that means you have won the lane because your teammates had a lot of space to get a lot of farm (or kills). That’s not always true in pubs, especially at low levels, because you will still see some people who manage to get 0 last hits in 8 minutes as an ursa in a 2v2, but still most of the time true.

Of course, when you are uncontested, you should always get at the very least 60 last hits, and when the lane is even, from 30 to 50 depending on how much the enemies want to trade farm. If you are playing vs a batrider, you should still be able to get a lot of CS because bat doesn’t really deny well, but if you are vs a TA or even a dark seer that’s a different story. But that’s another topic which is understanding lane matchups and many people better than me at dota would give you better explanations.",2016-01-28 13:49:40+00:00,czf35ok,5.0,t1_czf2vbr,645.0,learndota2
3907,"&gt; 1) I keep hearing about autoing Searing Arrows(SA). When I played, I could only use SA by manually selecting a target and shooting once, before re clicking. I get the impression from here that you can set it to auto cast? Is that true and how so?

It is true. To set it to auto cast, you can either right click the searing arrows icon in the hud, or press alt-w (with default key bindings). You should see something going around the icon when it’s set to auto cast.

&gt; 2) What should you do in the early/mid game if you get attacked by more than 2 players? In my first games I usually get crushed if I make even a very slight positioning mistake, especially if they have a stunner in their draft. How do you combat this?

It’s a really lame answer, but the simplest answer is « don’t get caught out of position ». Basically, Clinkz is a glass cannon. Even with his ult, he is pretty squishy. But he hits like a truck full of trucks. So adjust your positionning accordingly, and practice map awareness. Usually, with Clinkz, after level 6 i will spend about 40%-60% of my time either watching the minimap or directly looking elsewhere, not on my hero. It also comes down to predictions. If you expect the enemy team to take rosh soon, pushing out top is probably a good idea to either prevent them from doing so or force a trade if they do on one of their towers. That’s just an example. Also, usually, you have less risks of getting caught if your lanes are pushed out because the more lanes are pushed out, the more obvious it becomes when the enemy is grouping (« There are creeps hitting their T3 but no one is defending ? I’m totally not going to get ganked Keepo »).

That’s another thing which makes Clinkz a good hero to learn. He punishes positionning mistakes.

&gt; 3) Where? What lanes can you play clinkz in? Can you jungle him if the need arises? Does your play style change considerably for each lane. In a prev match, I was trilaned and was punished repeatedly. 

I play him in the safe lane and I think it’s his best position. However, you can go offlane or mid with him. I’m not a fan of going mid on Clinkz because he doesn’t do that much with mid lane (he doesn’t carry bottle naturally, etc), but he can.

If you are contested in lane, stay really far back and don’t try to trade harass. Just sap XP and go for a last hit with searing arrows and your 630 attack range when you can. Not dying when you are solo vs a trilane and getting 10 CS at 10 minutes means you have won your lane. And you can always consider ganking or counter ganking with him, it’s obviously not ideal but it can be a back up plan.

You can not jungle from level 1 with clinkz, but when you have soul ring + level 6 you are able to do jungle rotations.",2016-01-28 13:30:09+00:00,czf2n81,3.0,t1_czf2cyi,690.0,learndota2

Here is my last Void game : https://yasp.co/matches/2109504814",2016-01-28 09:45:45+00:00,czeypxw,1.0,t3_432jy4,2156.0,learndota2
3909,"I played a Clinkz game one or two days ago, if you want to look : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/2107268639

It was a good example of how to do in a very hard Clinkz game. The enemy team had a lot of bullshit tanky ungankable heroes, which is really bad for a ganking carry, and decent 5 man. This game shows how you can deal with these sort of lineups by farming the enemy jungle and split pushing, sometimes fighting with your team when necessary.

Clinkz is one of my favorite carries to play in solo games because not only is he a fun hero, he is also rewarding to play well, demanding a bit mechanically, he is independant of his team, and he trains your map awareness a lot. In my opinion, he is a very good carry to learn the playstyle of gankers.

- **Early game and starting items** : It depends on the game, but usually you don’t need to take a lot of HP regen if you think you will be left in a 1v1 matchup or you have supports in lane. If you want to go mid or offlane, you need to take 2 sets of regen, though (so salve+tangoes). Mango is also really good on him because of Clinkz’s reliance on mana and his squishiness before level 6. In the game I linked, I went for RoP+stick in my starting items and no mango because I was vs a bristleback. Adapt to the situation.

In lane, you want to last hit and trade hits with Searing Arrows. Clinkz has a really bad attack animation and starting damage, but Searing Arrows mitigates for the damage part a little bit after level 3. Don’t worry about denying that much, just harass with searing arrows whenever you see an opportunity and you won’t miss a CS from that.

- **Skill build :** You pretty much always want Searing Arrows maxed first. They give you the most mana efficient and reliable damage. The other rule is to always take ult whenever you can. Other than that, your skill build varies a bit but not much.

At level 1, keep your skill point. You can level Skeleton Walk first, but keep in mind that even if you get the rune, you will have a hard time getting your first creeps if you are contested, until level 2. It’s worth it if you can snatch the rune from the enemy mid laner. At level 2, keep your skill point if you skilled arrows at level 1, otherwise take searing arrows. At level 5 you should have a 0-3-1-0 skill build with 1 free skill point. If you have a kill opportunity in lane, skill strafe and use it. At level 6, take your ulti, at level 7 max out searing arrows and at level 8 start taking points in strafe. You should have a 1-4-2-1 by level 8.

After level 8, it varies a bit, but usually I leave Skeleton Walk at level 2 and max strafe second, taking ult at 11, because *Skeleton walk is a very good value point at level 2 because level 2 doubles the MS bonus*. Then I max out skeleton walk by 14 and take ult at 16. So here is what your skill build looks like :

If you had no kill opportunity in lane : 23232421114122Stats4

If you had a kill opportunity in lane : 23212423114122Stats4

- **Item build** : This is where a lot of Clinkz players at low levels go wrong. The items you want to build in 90% of games are **Treads, Soul Ring, Medallion** in the early game, and then you will grab your first big item : **Desolator**. A lot of players go for Orchid but it’s a lot safer to build deso. Deso gives you better push, more farming speed, and a lot more damage even if you factor in orchid’s damage amp. Also, with medallion’s mana regen, soul ring, and tread switching, you will never run out of mana. You can also include a **Ring of Basillius/Ring of Aquila** as an early game item (in my game I skipped it because I had a CM). After deso, your next items are **Dragon Lance and Solar Crest (90% of the time), OR diffusal blade**. I go for diffusal blade against Medusa or Omni, or if we need more catch. Other than that, dragon lance and crest. In general, build Dragon Lance before if you are focused on pushing, and Solar Crest before if you are focused on ganking. But build both. After that, you normally **disassemble both Crest and Dragon Lance for Butterfly and BKB** (use the talisman and the quarterstaff for bfly, and the ogre club for bkb. Keep your medallion). After that, adapt to what you need. Special mention to these items for the late game : Hex, Blink, Manta (dispel those pesky dusts), MKB, Daedalus.

- **Playstyle** : In lane, take last hits and trade harass, you will generally come out on top if you trade intelligently. After your level 6, start doing jungle rotations and look to pressure the tower whenever you have your ult buff. After that, you should have Treads-SR-medallion. Rotate to mid or offlane and go in the enemy jungle to keep on spamming your ult and stay off the map, while creating space for your team. Move out of the enemy jungle whenever you see a gank opportunity or a pushed out lane. **Whenever you gank, always look to push a tower next.** It’s important because it’s one of Clinkz’s biggest strengths : pushing. Join fights if you have to, but try to split the enemy team. Especially after Dragon Lance, you rat really well and without much risks.

- **Tips and Tricks** :

1. Try to get last hits without Searing Arrows if you are uncontested to save mana for actual fights.

2. If the enemy mid is sitting on top of a rune, what you can do to get it before him is the following : go invis, then spam right click and stop command on the rune spawn (because you might attack the enemy hero by mistake !), and you should be able to get it whenever the rune spawns.

3. If you are facing a dual lane, harass the lowest armor hero first, or the melee hero.

4. When you look to pressure a tower early and your creep wave is hitting it, *don’t right click the tower with Searing arrows on autocast*! Use your arrows manually. By using them manually you will be targeted last by the tower, allowing you to get a lot more damage in.

5. **Look at your map and check enemy inventories**. But mostly look at your map. Try to predict where the enemy warded. That’s where being a support player comes in handy for playing this hero.

6. Don’t waste Strafe in fights. Use it for important targets. That depends on the game, but the obvious example is that you don’t want to target an enemy bristleback or tide with it. Instead, targetting an enemy Dusa or SF does a lot more good.

7. Tread switching is very important on your hero. When you use your ult, the most efficient way to use SR with it is the following : switch to strength treads, pop soul ring, switch to int treads, use ult on a big creep that’s also full HP.

8. You can tread switch back to agi during skeleton walk’s fade time, but you don’t need it unless you use skeleton walk to farm and you know there is no enemy so you won’t have to go out of invis by strafing.

9. Don’t drag out the game too much, Clinkz is a bit weak in the late game in comparison to other carries, a bit like Anti-Mage. Use your peaks, which are as you get deso and to a lesser extent as you get bfly+bkb.

10. Your killing combo with medallion is pop out of invis by using medallion on an enemy and strafing, then right click. You don’t need to worry about any bonus damage if you come out of invis, skeleton walk doesn’t allow that.

11. Fight with your ulti up. ALWAYS. Delaying your entrance to a fight for 20s just because you have to eat a creep is worth it 99% of the time.

3947,"Calibrated at 1.3k in 2013, rose to 1.6k by playing support, then rose to 2.2k by spamming Gyro and PL back in 6.84 when PL was playable, then 2.5k by mixing support and carry. I’m still around that level now.

The most consistent way to win at this MMR is to make good decisions consistently. It’s not a secret and it wins at every MMR. It starts at the pick screen. I usually play Captain’s mode in ranked and snipe the role, because I’m a lot better at drafting than my MMR. So make a good pick. I suck at playing mid, and I have a few signature heroes, so my thought process is something like that :

- Do I need a carry ? If so, I will consider Gyro, Spectre, Slark, or Clinkz, most of the time. Keep in mind that carries that force your team to play in a certain way like AM are risky at this level, and if you pick Gyro a lot you will probably miss out on a couple of his strengths (which is early pushing and fighting).

- Do I need to support ? If so, I consider Undying, Visage, Witch Doctor, Lich, Abaddon. The main thing here is that you either need to pick a support that auto wins a lane (Undying, Lich…), a support that combos well in certain dual lanes (Abaddon), or a support that pushes well and scales well into the late game (WD, Visage). Of course, I adapt my picks here. I used to pick Shadow Shaman but I don’t do it a lot now. It’s a very good hero to climb in MMR if you pick him when someone else plays support to share the supporting duties with you.

- Do we have the possibility to run a jungler ? If we are on Dire, we have strong lanes, another support, and a solo offlaner, I pick Lycan or Enigma usually.

Here are a couple of things to remember when you play in this bracket :

- **People are allergic to towers**. Pushing seems so far from people’s preoccupations at this MMR. Unless there is a nature’s prophet in game. The classic argument to avoid pushing is that you have to « defend » a tower or something because usually people are also allergic to farming and split pushing so they won’t keep the lanes pushed out. *Pick pushing heroes or heroes that can sustain*. It goes a very long way. That’s why I like Enigma, Lycan, and Visage.

- **People love fighting**. For some weird reason, getting one pickoff on an enemy support with 5 heroes is seen as of a higher value than getting a tower. Teamfights are everything, according to people in this bracket. Especially in CM, you see a lot of Silencer/Omni bans, partially for that reason (also because magic stick doesn’t exist).

- **Lanes are usually not well thought out**. That catches me off guard a lot, and sometimes I pick starting items that end up being really bad just because I expected their bristleback to go offlane when it’s actually something else.

- **Last hitting and laning are bad, to say the least**. Getting more than 30 last hits in lane is miraculous at this MMR, even playing heroes like Void, Lycan. Laning is equally as bad for supports. If you are dual laning, expect your support to do nothing but leech XP and then blame the mid for not calling missing when the enemy mid rotates and kills an underleveled core. Pulling is usually single pulling. Zoning the enemy offlaner is something weird that no one does. Rotating mid or stacking jungle camps ? Forget it.

But the most important thing for me is that **people have a conceptually flawed vision of the game at this level**. That’s where all of those things I listed come from. Lanes are 2-1-2 (**NEVER EVER TRILANE AT THIS LEVEL UNLESS YOU COME ACROSS SOMEONE YOU TRUST**. Really, trilanes are so bad at that level.). Supports are not supporting, and you should expect the worst from them because it will usually be the worst. People go for outdated or really inefficient builds (Hood on Pudge, Arcanes on Witch Doctor, Mek on Disruptor when the team has a better mek carrier, Mek and Agh’s on Lion instead of Blink, Vanguard on NS, Treads on Phantom Lancer, Phase on Ember Spirit, Dagon 5 instead of aghs on nyx, Shadow blade on gyro, Shadow blade on everything really… I could go on forever). Supports go for mek or aghs instead of actually useful items. And you get flamed for helping your team winning the game. Getting a lot of kills with sunstrike early on as invoker gets you flamed, no matter how much you explain them how AoE gold works and that it nets more gold for the team if you get the kill. You get flamed for split pushing instead of joining bad fights. You get flamed for not going for Linkens manta on dusa.

So here is my advice to win games in this bracket, and to cope with other’s mistakes :

- Pick fighting heroes that either have some form of sustain, or can push as well. Heroes like Undying, Pugna (**Be careful, a lot of people will try to make Pugna a support !**), Chen if you can play it (because no one can at this level), Lycan, Jakiro, etc.

- Pick heroes on which people do the least build mistakes with. My advice is Witch Doctor, Dazzle, Death Prophet, Earth Shaker, and maybe Alch. I picked also a lot of WW the last patch but she is pretty much gone now.

- Pick better late game. Usually, Spectre wins in these games, for a reason. People don’t want to end games when ahead for some weird reason at this level.

- If you need to have pushing power, pick a nature’s prophet. People do weird things like Jungling with him but it ends up working sometimes at this level.

And ignore what your team says. Mute everything if you need to. If you know your team is not going to win any 5v5, resist the urge to listen to them and split push. Do what you need to win the game, don’t do what your team wants because they are most likely wrong. Unless you see someone with clear symptoms of having a brain.

Edit : 

&gt; for example recently I am winning a lot by playing healers and making utility item like Drum of Endurance as early as possible, as my team tends to pick 3 carries, DoE helps them to push, pick up kills or retreat faster. it aura also effects creeps so win win. as no one make this item in 1k bracket, I make this item.

Wat. On which hero do you do this ? I don’t see any hero benefiting from drums as a healing support or even core.",2016-01-25 10:31:12+00:00,czb3gfj,1.0,t3_42jtu6,18723.0,learndota2

So first of all, Clinkz is a very fun hero to play, and he is a very good hero to learn map awareness, mana management, cooldown management, mechanics (in particular tread switching) and game sense overall, IMHO. He is also a very nice hero to have in pubs because he takes advantage of lack of coordination and he rewards good decision making.

So spamming Clinkz can be good for you, however be careful about « maining ». Playing one hero a lot helps you getting better at dota, but don’t restrict yourself to one hero.

Here is my record on Clinkz : http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?hero=clinkz

And here is how I play him :

- **Starting items, laning** : At the start of the game, get some regen and stats, as usual. With Clinkz, I like getting a mango a lot. There are many builds you can go for, but I like tango-salve-mango-rop-branch. You can also start with 2 mangoes instead of 1, remove salve, start with 2 rings or a stick if you plan to trade harass with someone (pro tip : if you expect a bristleback to lane against you, get tango-rop-stick). As far as laning goes, you want the safe lane most of the time, but you can be played in the offlane too at lower levels, and you are fine with soloing a lane. I would advise against going mid as Clinkz because other heroes would do better than him. In lane, use your searing arrows for last hits that will be hard to get (last hitting as Clinkz is HORRENDOUSLY HARD without searing arrows), and most importantly use them to orbwalk whenever you can not get a last hit ! Clinkz has a very high attack range and orbwalking allows you to get automatically an advantage if the enemy hero wants to trade right clicks vs you because not only will you have extra damage with searing arrows, creeps will aggro to the enemy heroes too. Assert your dominance in lane, and try to harass their melee heroes more, or their low armor heroes more. Notable examples of heroes like this are Doom, Slark, Visage, Phantom Lancer, a lot of intelligence heroes (except Storm Spirit), Alchemist… You can soften them enough to net you a kill or zone them really far back, most of the time. In lane, be careful if you face heroes like Slardar, Lich, or strong laners in general. Until level 6, you normally alternate between last hitting and harassing, although you can get kills at this stage. There is also a neat thing you can do : if you want to snatch the rune from an enemy alch or their mid hero, skill skeleton walk at level 1, get on the rune where the enemy hero stands, and spam right click and S on him to cancel your attack. When the rune spawns, you can steal it that way.

- Skill build : As usual, keep your skill point at level 1. Take invis if you need to get out of a sticky situation (like you would do with blink on AM), otherwise take Searing Arrows. Max searing arrows by level 7, but keep skill points in case you need strafe for a kill. Ideally, your skill build at level 7 should be either 0-4-1-1 + 1 skill point available, or 1-4-1-1 if you went for a kill, or 0-4-2-1 in all other cases. After level 7, I like taking points in strafe and going 3-4-2-1 by level 10, but you can also go 2-4-3-1 if you want. I’m not exactly sure which is the most efficient. I also take ult at level 11, and then max out Strafe then skeleton walk last.

- Item choices : I talked about starting items earlier. Afterwards, your first items should be Power Treads, Soul Ring, optionnally ring of basilius and Medallion. After your medallion, you can start taking your first big item, which is **desolator**. A lot of players go for orchid but it’s wrong in many many cases. You should normally go for Orchid only when there are a lot of escapes in the enemy team and a lot of push in your team. When you get your deso, you really hit your power spike. Normally, you are level 11 at that point in time, and with Death pact level 2, searing arrows level 4, and a whopping *-13 armor* from deso and medallion, you hit like a truck full of trucks. Afterwards, my items used to be either BKB, diffusal, MKB (vs wind or arc warden for example), or blink, but since 6.86 i think your best item overall after deso is **dragon lance**. It allows Clinkz to outrange towers, which makes it very easy to rat. You deal a lot of physical damage, and you reduce armor, so towers melt the instant you see them (it’s another reason to go for deso). After that, you either go for diffusal if there is omni or anything purgeable on the enemy team, or you get solar crest and then disassemble both crest and lance to get butterfly + bkb. Normally, at that point, you should have a big enough advantage to almost secure the game. If you didn’t, well… Bad news for you, Clinkz is pretty weak as a carry in the late game because he gets bursted down so quickly. You can still win it though, but then adapt your builds. Get MKB if they have evasion, etc.

- Gameplay : In lane, your gameplay is very standard. After level 6 and your first items (boots + SR or boots + basi…), alternate between pushing the lane and rotating to the hard camp near your lane and eat the big creep, then killing the small ones. Also, pressure the lane if the enemy offlaner(s) leave(s) ! It’s important. Keep doing that until either the tower is destroyed or you were forced to join a fight/gank. Afterwards, try to farm the enemy jungle as much as you can and stay out of their vision. Split push as much as you can, especially after deso. Your pattern should be something like farm the enemy jungle -&gt; gank -&gt; push. Rinse and repeat. When you know you forced the enemy team to group, split push more.

- Spell/item usage :

1. Your medallion is used to kill heroes quickly. Whenever you engage on someone, use strafe, medallion them, and right click. You don’t need to worry about bonus damage if you come out from invis by attacking because Skeleton Walk doesn’t give any.

2. When using your ult, the most efficient way to do it is to do it in this order : tread switch to strength -&gt; use soul ring -&gt; tread switch to intelligence -&gt; use ult. I’m sometimes lazy and I use soul ring on agi, but it’s not very efficient.

3. Use your treadswitch. Clinkz needs a lot of mana.

3988,"&gt; Yesterday I played with a Gyro who levels Missile first, spammed it, and pushed the lane constantly.

I met this kind of people too. One guy picked gyro in my game, we had a rune fight and he threw a missile. I thought « Ouch, that’s a big loss, he had to level up missile at 1, we can not engage until he is level 2 ».

Then he maxed it and wasted his mana on it consistently. What an asshole. Of course we lost the game.

On the flipside though, if you play like a good support every game, you will be a lot less likely to meet people who fuck up. That also means you have to accept losses because some games will be handed to the enemy team by your cores.

&gt; But often they get sucked into skirmishes with the enemy.

That should not happen if you zone well. If you expect a 2v2 lane (it happens a lot in this MMR if you don’t play CM), pick undying or something that auto wins his lane and just win this way : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/2086442879",2016-01-21 13:13:47+00:00,cz6fw2s,3.0,t1_cz6fe36,1337.0,learndota2
3989,"- Good disruptors : those who max glimpse first and prioritize targets well in fights for static storm are loveable. Unfortunately, a lot of people who play disruptor do stupid shit like going 4-0-4-1 at level 9.

- Earthshaker : everyone knows how to play this hero at least decently

- Dazzle : free regen in lane ! Especially when i go for carries like Spectre, I love someone like dazzle with me

- Witch doctor : A lot of people are slightly inefficient with him, but it’s one of the best played supports.

- Silencer : a support who doesn’t mess with creep aggro, finally ! Seriously, it’s a very common mistake at low MMR to mess up with creep aggro as a support and it’s frustrating as fuck.

Here are supports I would like if they were not played so badly (aka normally they are decent, but people misunderstand these heroes) :

- Crystal Maiden (no one jungles with her… I mean getting a nice efficiency bonus is lovely, but when i tell you to jungle as CM, it’s because you can)

- Lion (because for some reason people are allergic to blink on lion at this level)

- Skywrath mage (arcanes into atos as a support with a combo hero like void on your team, do I need to explain how bad it is ?)

- Mirana because after a while they decide that wards don’t exist anymore and that manta-deso is the most efficient item combo ever.

- Necrophos as a support because sometimes people believe it can work

Also, here are the mistakes I see the most from support players in my bracket (around 2.5k atm) :

- **Lane control. That’s the worst part about supports at this MMR range by far.** Usually, I see either people pulling when they shouldn’t, harassing from behind the creepwave instead of harassing from outside of creep aggro range, *standing behind me to deny* (every second you spend jerking off behind your carry in enemy vision, a kitten dies. Save kittens and my sanity.), auto attacking the ranged creep to get a last hit (messes up the equilibrium and forces me to push out at the wrong times. If you want a last hit, tell me, I will let you have one, don’t lose me the lane)… I could go on forever. For this reason, my advice is to not touch creeps as a support (like, not at all. Let your carry manage this, if he has a brain he should do that without problem), and to not pull unless your carry has a stout or the lane will push hard in the next 30 seconds or so. It doesn’t sound like a big deal, but a lane can be lost in a single auto attack.

- Going around solo and feeding as a support

- Wrong item builds : in particular it’s frustrating to see that Lich has bought a mek 10 minutes after you did, when you know for a fact that Lich knew you were going to buy mek and you had it.

- Bad spell usage : have you seen the silencer panic ult before dying ? A lot of support players do that.",2016-01-21 08:35:38+00:00,cz6b759,1.0,t3_41w90r,43001.0,learndota2
3990,"&gt; **Weak laning**. I usually play 4-5 support, and Enigma picks are one of my least favorite to see. It means I will have no second support during the laning stage, so there's no one to help win the lanes or rotate or put fires out. This is a huge vulnerability against aggressive roaming supports like BH, Tusk, Ogre, etc.

That’s (partially) a misconception because a lot of players are just bad with enigma. If left uncontested, Enigma can get mek before 10 minutes very easily, 8 minutes without fuckups. Afterwards, it’s time for EZ towers. The first 8-10 minutes are when the enigma is vulnerable, but you have to keep in mind an uncontested enigma in the jungle gets his level 6 before his mid hero. In the game I linked in the post, I solo killed a spectre with eidolons + pulse + black hole at 6 minutes because spectre thought it was a good idea to reality on top of an enigma with 1/3rd of his HP but level 8.

However, your point stands true if the enemy team has heroes like BH.

&gt; His main strength - his early farming speed - is now less of a relative advantage after Iron Talon. This sounds like perhaps not that big of a deal, but it really is. Enigma's primary strength compared to other heroes is his ability to get fast levels and a strong 2k-ish item up for his team by the 6-7 minute mark. Now other jungling heroes can be less behind, and they tend to scale better as they are usually right-clickers. Their farming rate will only increase as their DPS increases, while Enigma's pretty much maxes out at level 4 Eidelons and whatever mana is needed to support frequent casting (usually Soul Ring).

Don’t forget that the cloak aura is also an indirect buff to enigma, because stacks don’t matter much as enigma and you don’t have to leave the jungle to your SF or something. The other hard camp also is a buff to enigma because he can actually farm ancients now if he wants.

&gt; Speaking of itemization, Blink first is usually a bad idea. Mek will generally do much more for your team. But Blink first is more common than it really should be IMO.

You are right, and it’s a very common mistake.

&gt; Black Hole dependence. This has always been pointed out as the primary weakness of the hero, and it's still true. Black Hole has a huge cooldown and is quite tricky to get consistent good use out of (positioning, protection with BKB / against a Rubick, allied team reaction, etc). Not great in a meta that encourages near-constant fighting and skirmishing, and late in the game it's almost the only thing Enigma brings to the table. One bad or wasted Black Hole often costs an objective in the lategame. Fights also tend to be more spread out than ever at least by my judging, with the changes to open up the map paths and the popularity and introduction of mobility and range items like Aether Lens (and to a much lesser extent Dragon Lance). It's nearly impossible to get more than a 2-3 man Black Hole against any halfway competent players, and if you know what you're doing it's quite easy to nullify the power of Black Hole. Compared to things like Reverse Polarity or Winter's Curse or even a Vacuum+Wall, there are better options (and on shorter cooldowns).

That’s also (sort of) a misconception. Enigma is not as much ult-centric as people make him out to be, he is mostly eidolon-centric. If you wanted me to tell the primary strength of enigma, I would say pushing first, teamfighting second (also because of early mek), and farming speed + late game third.

And getting a 2-3 man black hole is okay. Just black hole their mid or their carry in the early/mid game, and black hole 1 or 2 towards the end of a fight in the mid game.

I’m not the best enigma player out there, but I have a 58ish percent winrate on him and I like him a lot. He is very stable in pubs : when you know you have good lanes (Lich, Silencer…), you are on dire, and you don’t have a mek carrier but you have push, it’s an enigma game.",2016-01-20 19:20:10+00:00,cz5j4ar,2.0,t1_cz5h90h,2531.0,learndota2
3991,"First blood on Spectre helped, otherwise it would have been the usual (for me) 8 minutes-9 minutes. 

Here is a video on how to do it on Dire : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-s9aH3_DjcY

And more precisions : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K4C6EFssS8

Here is what I do :

- Starting build : 2×clarities, sage’s mask. I keep 200 gold with this starting build, which allows me to get sentries if i need to. Usually I don’t, because low level pubs.

- At the start, I deny a creep mid and wait with my eidolons just outside of the hard camp’s spawn box. Meanwhile, I go back to base and leave just as I get 190 mana. You will stop getting affected by the aura exactly as you get full mana again if you do that, and you will get to the hard camp around 0:34-36.

- As soon as the camp spawns at 30 seconds, hit the big creep with eidolons. **Be careful** : if the spawn is a Hellbear camp, you need to hit him only once, and then have your eidolons disappear, and if the spawn is a troll camp, it might create troll (it doesn’t usually do that, but it can). The hellbear thing is because there is a very annoying bug : if eidolons hit the red hellbear and the hellbear casts clap as they die, he will stay in place and do nothing, instead of returning to his camp. It will force you to take a lot of damage and summon eidolons way inside the spawnbox because the potato doesn’t return to his camp, so you will end up blocking the spawn at 1:00. If you need clarification, I can make a video.

- As you arrive to the camp, aggro, get back to the north of the camp and summon eidolons barely inside the spawnbox. Then auto attack the camp. If you are vs a troll camp, don’t pop clarity right away, wait . If you are vs a melee camp, you can do it with little worries. 

Prioritize hitting the large creep, pretty much always no matter the spawn. That’s especially important for trolls and wildwings.

- Micro your eidolons to have 6 of them. It’s a very big deal to lose one, it delays your mek by as much as 1 minute sometimes. Don’t fuck this up, it’s important.

- You should kill the camp just before the spawn. GTFO from the spawnbox and go hit the medium camp until your eidolons expire. When your eidolons expire, kill the hard camp again.

- By the time you killed the hard camp, you are level 2 so you have pulse, and you have 6 eidolons. Use pulse to cut trees and kill the medium camp. Then go to the other medium camp (near top rune) and kill it again. Make sure to stack if you don’t kill in time.

- In all this time, use clarities while you hit camps but you are 100% sure your eidolons will tank all the hits. You should have soul ring just at the time your first clarity is running out, but communicate with your mid and ask him if he needs his bottle.

When you hit level 3 + soul ring it’s much easier to jungle. You just need to not fuck up until that time, and you should get level 6 between 4 minutes and 5 minutes if you are not contested.

Message me if you need any help ! It comes down to practice, try to do rounds and farm until mek, then write down your timing. When you can reliably get mek-sr-boots in 8 minutes, you are good to go. It doesn’t take too much time.",2016-01-20 19:05:57+00:00,cz5ihln,3.0,t1_cz5h7ys,1718.0,learndota2

3993,"Void is a melee hero with little lane domination until he gets levels. Early on, his advantage is his great base damage, and that’s it. That means that you can zone him fairly easily. Heroes who can trade harass well over time like Disruptor, Skywrath Mage or Winter Wyvern are great at shutting down void (these 3 are also good vs him later). Also, you must know how to shut down an offlaner. In my last void game I was against a PL + dazzle dual lane and i won my lane within the first minute because i blocked my lane better than they did and then made the lane pull back using aggro and trading in my ranged creep’s range, which then allowed me to have free levels and free farm under tower. Avoid that.

Anyway, here are a couple of thoughts regarding enigma in the jungle :

- Enigma used to be better on Dire than Radiant, but now it’s a lot better. On an uncontested jungle, if you don’t get first blood like i did, you can get level 6 before 5 minutes on dire, with mek around 8 minutes or so, but on radiant you add 1 minute-1 minute 30 to this timer.

- He is still viable like he was in 6.85, though.

- You still have the same strategy as before, in general. As soon as you get mek, look to push as many towers as you can. If the enemy team tries to counter initiate, try to black hole their mid, their carry, or both.

- My skill build is 1-4-1-1 at level 7, then 4-4-1-1 at 10, then 4-4-4-1. I get levels in black hole either around 17-18, or when i get a point booster for aghs, or when i get greaves. Usually i try to get bots though.

- My item build is still the same : SR, boots, mek, blink, and from there either greaves, aghs, or BKB. You could probably fill a slot with pipe, but i’m not sold on it.

- He is still a good hero to play in pubs because he has a fixed playstyle.

These are just my thoughts though, you probably know Enigma better than I do. Anyway, good luck !",2016-01-20 12:35:44+00:00,cz547xm,1.0,t3_41txiv,4431.0,learndota2

- Lion is not pickable every game. It’s not 6.83 anymore. Try to pick Lion when you have another support that will buy most of the wards until you get blink at least, when you lack lockdown/ganking prowess, and when you have farmers on your team. Typically, for example, Lion can complement a team with a Gyro or a Lich really well.

- Blink timing is crucial on Lion, and that’s why you need a good start on him. Your blink should be anywhere between 14 minutes (very good game) to 30 (bad game), depending on how well your lane went, how your ganks succeeded… You also need to get quite a bit of XP because a timely level 6 makes a lot of difference.

- Lion is a very good ganker. If the enemy mid is someone like Sniper, SF, or Storm pre-6, you can very easily smoke on him and get a kill during the first few minutes.

- Skill build should be pretty much always 4-1-1-1 at level 7, then either 4-2-3-2 at 11 (very situationnal build, if you have no mana problem whatsoever and you are facing heroes like Storm or QoP), or 4-1-4-2 at 11 (general).

- If you have no mana, drain creeps from the jungle. It will make the enemy mid play scared and ensure you get a full drain.

- Don’t stack disables.

- Use your ult right after hex.

And here is a link to my last post about Lion, with more depth : https://www.reddit.com/r/learndota2/comments/3yuw90/hero_discussion_lion/cyhalm7",2016-01-18 12:37:13+00:00,cz2mwqe,1.0,t3_41ilef,3604.0,learndota2
4035,"&gt; Start the game with some regen and clarities so you can use your spells, as well as wards/courier etc.

Do not buy clarities on Lion, level 1 mana drain is more than enough to get your mana going. You can buy mangoes, but don’t waste money on clarities.

Edit for OP :

&gt; One thing I don't understanad is the massive controversy of dagon on lion, which I hear nearly everywhere. Also in terms of gameplay, are you 4 or 5 support.

Dagon doesn’t really make sense on Lion, especially as a support. That’s because of item timings : getting dagon on a mid necro who stomped his lane at 10 minutes makes you wreck face because you got it so early that it’s super effective and nets you very easy kills. Getting dagon early on after blink on puck if you played really well is very good because it allows you to abuse your timings more. On the other hand, getting dagon on a support Lion after their carry got BKB and their supports got their levels (so they are not really burstable) has almost no effect.

Also, don’t go for mek ever unless you are snowballing and no one is buying mek in your team, and don’t go for aghs unless you have really low waveclear in your team.",2016-01-18 12:24:22+00:00,cz2mp01,2.0,t1_cz2m1rd,2478.0,learndota2

4039,"&gt; There are various contemporary usages of the term. Robert Hare claimed in the popular science book entitled Snakes in Suits that sociopathy and psychopathy are often used interchangeably, but in some cases the term sociopathy is preferred because it is less likely than is psychopathy to be confused with psychosis, whereas in other cases the two terms may be used with different meanings that reflect the user's views on the origins and determinants of the disorder. Hare contended that the term sociopathy is preferred by those that see the causes as due to social factors and early environment, and the term psychopathy preferred by those who believe that there are psychological, biological, and genetic factors involved in addition to environmental factors.[86] Hare also provides his own definitions: he describes psychopathy as not having a sense of empathy or morality, but sociopathy as only differing in sense of right and wrong from the average person.[166][167]

4046,"&gt; 6.82 was the first patch with the added comeback gold which was nerfed down into 6.83 but was still super strong which is why sniper was picked so much

It was the opposite. Sniper was picked so much because he was super good in that patch. The reason why comeback mechanics had an effect is almost solely because heroes with very strong high ground defense like Sniper were picked a lot. Hell, Sniper’s popularity even led teams to pick bat against him, and bat was pretty bad this patch.

Also, according to Nahaz (or noxville ? I can’t remember), rubberband effect was actually more of a resistance band effect, there were not really more comebacks in 6.83 compared to the previous patches, even 6.81.

4047,"&gt; Clinkz could go HotD, for example (not actually a bad item on him)

I did a bit of calculations on what HotD and medallion could bring to Clinkz in comparison to deso and aquila before 6.85 came out, and you are right, it’s not bad. Not the best item on him now though because of his changes, especially vs Chen. The HP bonus is almost insignificant if you convert a chen creep.

&gt; You can easily purge ToF though.

Not very easily, because it relies either on an Oracle or something to dispel it (oracle being also pretty bad vs push strats), or on a diffusal blade carrier to do it. Again, someone like Clinkz could do (diffu is legit on Clinkz), but it requires farm. Not to mention someone doomed will usually back off, meaning you have to have an extremely long range on your purge to do it, a blink dagger, or someone who comes from behind. I could see a dominated/enchanted creep do it, but it’s just taking too many risks to make a pick work.

&gt; Abd seriously, Doomy's new E just DESTROYS spirit bear.

You are right on this point.

I just think Doom can work, but it’s way too risky against such a zoo push strat if it has a chen.

4062,"It’s about their strats. Instead of the classic 1-2-3-4-5 position system, they have :

- Loda as a « 1.5 » position. Creates a lot of space for his team after getting space in the first 10 minutes or so, goes for fighting builds quite a lot. Examples of this playstyle are in his Spectre game where he let Bulldog get Radiance, and went for Urn-Blademail-Manta, or his Jugg games where he went for Drums.

- Bulldog as a « 1.5 » position too. You see him overtaking Loda in farm a lot, and also favoring more greedy builds like Midas into Radiance on his Lone Druid, or Aghs-Octa (sometimes) on NP. He also takes the safe farm more often than Loda, I believe, while Loda is moving agressively. In the early game, he takes advantage of the big creep camp beside the offlane a lot. This creep camp addition was a big buff to [A], I think.

- s4 is a 3 position, playing from the mid lane. This completely changes the way [A] drafts, but also how they play. Playing a space creator mid like Bat or Puck means they can rely less on defensive supports, as opposed to what an Ember or a Shadow Fiend could rely on. Therefore, [A] favors both greedy supports like Silencer, or agressive/pushing supports like Chen. They also can pick junglers more freely than teams with a farm-heavy mid because of that (Chen, again).

- EGM plays differently depending on his hero, but he is either a sort of 3 position (on heroes like Silencer), or a 4-4.5 on other heroes. I’m not sure, but I think he buys very few wards and lets Akke do the most in this regard (can someone confirm ?). You notice that usually, after their first rotation to take out the enemy offlane T1, he stays in the safe lane to farm it, much like Aui would do on Visage, or Akke would do on Skywrath Mage.

- Akke is the true 5, and he usually picks heroes that can have some pushing potential, and some form of sustain.

Unlike other teams, Alliance seems to try and take down the offlane tower before the safe lane tower of the other team too. I would also like to see how many camps they farm on average, stacking/farming camps very efficiently used to be the core of their strategies around 2013 and it looks like they do it again, with success.

So in order to shut down Alliance, I think you have to pick heroes like BH who can contest the enemy jungle early, Clinkz who can hunt split pushers and eat Chen creeps, or heroes like Gyro/Dark Seer/AA to be able to take full on teamfights against their push early on. I can also see some sort of double jungle strategy work against them, to give their supports a very timely level 6.",2016-01-17 13:19:50+00:00,cz1h42p,4.0,t1_cz1gpa7,1524.0,DotA2

It’s a very good value point now thanks to the mana cost reduction (huge for hit trades in lane), but I think it’s more valueable overall to go for a 1-4-4-3 skill build and take stats until level 23.

- Now for items, you need urn or medallion, possibly both. There are many reasons for that : first, Urn and medallion increase your survivability. Second, medallion allows your team to take rosh. Third, urn allows to save mana by using urn istead of your heal if you have to heal only 1 target. Shadow wave is one of the least cost-effective spells if you want to heal only 1 target. Fourth, and most importantly now since the mana cost nerfs on both shadow wave and shallow grave : it gives you mana regen, which is very important on dazzle. Getting crest would have been especially effective vs Jugg, even if he has battlefury.

- Congrats on the little deaths, that’s really good. The indicator of a good support game.

4118,"I play slark from time to time. Here is my record on him : http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?hero=slark

It’s funny that you say that, I always found him a bit weak since 6.84. He is decent in pubs, though.

The main thing about Slark is that he is a hero that’s really weak, except that he is very good at snowballing and gaining momentum, and at disengaging/reengaging. Here are Slark’s weaknesses :

- He gets shat on by around 80% of the hero pool, especially heroes like 17%, Phantom Lancer, Phantom Assassin, Anti-Mage.

- He is weak against 5-manning.

- He has no counterpush.

- He has weak push unless he has a lot of essence shift stacks.

- He has a weak laning phase.

- He is squishy.

- He needs mana, so mana burn wrecks him.

- He is pretty bad in the late game compared to a real carry. Even heroes like AM wreck him after 45 minutes, and AM is not even a very good carry after 45 minutes.

There are 2 kinds of Slark : the ones who get shadow blade (most pub players) and those who don’t (like me). If Slark gets shadow blade, play against Slark as you would do against a Clinkz : get a few sentries at the entrances of your jungle, and sit behind your carry as a support. If he doesn’t, he is actually harder to deal with in general because he doesn’t rely as much on snowballing, IMHO, but supports can have more breathing room.

So here are a few heroes that can deal with Slark very well : **Spirit Breaker**, Queen of Pain, Clockwerk, Bloodseeker, **Disruptor**, Anti-Mage, Phantom Lancer, competent Skywrath Mages, competent Banes, Bloodseeker, Lone Druid, **Lycan**, Visage, Lion, Lina, Troll Warlord, Phantom Assassin, Invoker, Ancient Apparition, Riki, and many more. If you are up against Slark, try to avoid the likes of Lifestealer, Gyro, or Witch Doctor. But as I said before, a lot of heroes have favorable matchups vs Slark, picks usually are not the problem vs him.

Now the most important thing to counter Slark is strategy. With push being so strong this patch, Slark is even more disadvantaged. Ideally, what you want to do is to shut him down in lane and transition it into early 5-manning and pushing. Slark is weak to 5-man, and he can not really do anything about you pushing.

In solo games, I think one of the best heroes to have against Slark is Lycan. Lycan has a lot of advantages vs Slark : he chases him and catches him after pounce, necro gives him mana burn, and true sight if he ever thinks that shadow blade is a good idea, and lycan pushes really quickly. If you are supporting, one of the best heroes to have against him is Disruptor. Disruptor absolutely destroys Slark if played correctly. Dark pact can not purge thunder strike, and of course not static storm or kinetic field. Glimpse is also very helpful to catch a Slark. If you are offlaning, try to pick Spirit Breaker, and get a few agressive wards to charge him in his jungle whenever you can. If you play disruptor vs Slark, it’s absolutely worth it to solo ulti the slark in a lot of cases.

Also, be wary of his dark pact. If you have an instant disable like Ancient Seal, use it when he is not preparing dark pact. If you have a delayed disable, try to use it so it comes out just as dark pact ends. That’s especially true if you want to gank him with an earthshaker : if he comes to farm a wave alone and you have teammates inbound, wait for his dark pact then blink-echo on him and the wave.",2016-01-14 09:48:08+00:00,cyxr2i4,1.0,t3_40wnky,7312.0,learndota2

&gt; Why is there a « random » option available ?

For the same reasons as to why there are more modes than All pick. Knowing what to do with a suboptimal draft is one of a strengths of a good dota player, sometimes you just want to random, and because it gives extra gold. The selfish idiot is not the randomer, it’s the guy that calls for a lane and a hero.

&gt; I just feel like Ranked matchmaking plays exactly like casual MM, only with teams taking turns in picking the FotM heroes instead of everyone picking at once. Ranked should be serious business but is not taken seriously. Nobody picks to win, people pick what they want to play regardless of how well it will fare against the enemy line-up or the synergy with their own team.

So you’re telling me people don’t trust 4 randoms ? I mean I would pick heroes like AM any day if I knew I could rely on supports, but I don’t do it because I know people who « support » at my level do basically nothing but sitting behind the carry, denying, and single pulling at the worst times, which is very frustrating to see as a support player. So I pick heroes like Clinkz or Gyro if I’m given the chance to go for a carry.

You got to give chances to yourself and adapt instead of complain. I mean everyone gets shit teammates and shit compositions. You can never get 100% winrate.

&gt; Playing CM is not an option. 30 minute queue times are not acceptable.

Wut. I play ranked CM and I get around 3-5 minutes of queue time for each game. Also, pro tip : if you know for a fact you are better at drafting than people at your level, snipe the captain role and pick heroes who work alone well, like Dazzle, Crystal Maiden, Gyro, Clinkz, Lina…

&gt; Why are there so many junglers who instantly push someone into solo support position? [3k MMR]

Because jungling is largely unpunished at lower MMR and because a lot of people have wrong opinions about dota. Even really popular heroes like PA or PL are misunderstood by a lot of people.

&gt; I do prefer the freedom you have in Dota, but it's really tiring to see that freedom abused and costing you games.

Anything can work. And at least, if you know your shit, you should be able to win more games because you are less likely to have retards on your team than the reverse (you know you can trust yourself).

If you had a mode that allowed to ban one hero and then pick like in AP, it would be extremely unbalanced and it would have to be banned from ranked.",2016-01-11 14:51:40+00:00,cyu21db,1.0,t3_40go1w,6529.0,DotA2

Procs on your attacks make attack speed items more valueable, yep. That’s why you build items like MoM on Faceless void (maybe not on the new void, but on the pre-6.86 void MoM was pretty much mandatory, because the bashes procced more often and it did twice as much damage in chrono).

&gt; so if we take an example like jugg, or pa .. i should actually buying one of mkb/basher and the rest of the items being attack speed items ?? 

Not exactly on Jugg and PA. Crits are in some ways damage multipliers. So just because your hero has a crit, doesn’t mean you should go for attack speed items. In fact, damage items have their effectiveness multiplied by crits. So you should balance it out, as with other heroes.

&gt; also how do i know i have maxed the attack speed in game ? 

In general, you don’t have it, unless you have 5 moon shards. Max attack speed is reached when you have 600 IAS, which comes from both agility and +attack speed items like AC, Mjollnir or Moon Shard.",2016-01-11 09:23:16+00:00,cytvu3v,4.0,t1_cytswdj,9582.0,learndota2

4168,"I played a gyro game an hour or so ago, if you want to have a look. It showcases quite a lot of gyro’s strengths and weaknesses, in my opinion.

Here is the game : https://yasp.co/matches/2070018192

Gyro is also my 3rd most played hero, with 63% winrate over 55 games.

Here are a couple of my mistakes this game :

- Not buying quelling blade until late (QB increases flak damage, so it speeds up your farm quite a lot, especially on ancients)

- Dying too much and getting caught out of position

- Whiffing call downs

- You could argue that I should have taken a value point in homing missile before 16 too, as there is almost no difference between having stats or not in terms of farming speed when you reach levels 14-15, but having homing missile can secure kills. So in general, you should have a skill build of 4-1-4-3 at level 16, then you max stats and take missile at levels 23-25.

- Missing free last hits in lane… &gt;&lt; I’m rusty

On gyro, you farm in general very quickly, and you can use 3 spells for farming : barrage, flak, and call down. Here is a breakdown of their uses :

- **Rocket Barrage** : This spell costs 90 mana, making it the second most costly spell for farming. It’s important, your mana pool is actually limiting quite a bit since the int nerf before you start putting points into stats at level 10. You should in general use it for jungle camps if they are not stacked, or for creepwaves if you have extra mana or if you use it in combination with call down to kill a wave.

- **Flak cannon** : You should ideally have this always on cooldown. Having an aquila (which is almost mandatory on your hero) allows you to keep this spell up at all times. That being said, you should use it effectively. In this order, you want to use it primarly for stacks, multiple jungle camps (I will explain it in the tips), creepwaves, and jungle camps as your least valueable priority for flak. Don’t use it on jungle camps unless you are sure you won’t need it for later or you don’t have extra mana to farm with your other spells and no time to farm with auto attacks either.

- **Call down** : It’s the spell you should be most careful about, if you use it for farming. That is because it puts a bit of a toll on your mana pool since you use barrage and flak so much, and because it’s an important spell for teamfights. I use it only to kill creepwaves close to enemy towers when I want to quickly force a reaction, or to kill jungle stacks (but not ancient stacks for obvious reasons). I always use it in combination with barrage, because if I use it with flak i waste shots which could have been used for farming (shooting on a tower with no creeps around wastes gold).

In order to be ready for a fight anytime, you should always keep 125 (call down) + 90 (barrage) + 50 (flak) + 75 (TP) = **340 mana**. That’s the bare minimum, I recommend you to set it to 400 mana because you might need another barrage. It’s actually pretty hard to do before you reach levels 10-11, after that it gets easier and easier as you level up your stats.

Now let’s move on to gameplay. At level 1, you want to take a mix of regen and stats. I usually go for tango-salve-circlet-rop-branch, but you can vary the build of course. You can especially replace the branch with the clarity if you think it won’t be needed to make a wand. After that, your item progression should look like this : Phase/Treads - Aquila - Quelling Blade - Wand - Helm of the Dominator - BKB/SnY. You can change the order as needed in your games, or skip a few items. In my last game I thought it was not necessary to go for wand vs their lineup so I didn’t buy it.

A couple things about items :

- **Phase or Treads ?** Treads are the most common nowadays in the pro scene, but I still go for Phase a lot unless I’m up against heavy nukers. In pubs where there is less coordination, it’s more important to have phase because the added farming speed + catch (you can use phase when you walk up to someone to use rocket barrage btw) is more important than the tanking + the AS given by Treads for me. Treads is not bad, though.

- **Why quelling blade ? You are a ranged hero ! Repafted** : Quelling blade allows you to do many things on this hero. First off, it speeds up your farm a lot and it shows especially when you kill ancients. Without a QB, you have to use flak + around 3 hits on a small ancient to finish him, with a QB it’s only 1 hit or so. QB also allows you to farm the 2 camps closest to your base as Dire at the same time : you can cut the same tree as if you wanted to choke point jungle, and then run into the medium camp, run back towards the hard camp, pop flak cannon, a-click and watch. It used to be possible to farm 3 camps on radiant but it’s no longer the case. OSFrog PLEASE

- **Is it worth it getting BKB early ?** Well… in general it is. Usually on many carries I don’t like early BKB because it’s very greedy in the sense that it relies on your ability to use the first charges well and it doesn’t really help you farm. But on gyro, it’s more valueable because you naturally stay in the middle of fights, and because you farm very quickly with spells anyway. You prioritize BKB on Gyro as much as you would do on an SF : you don’t go for it as your first big item necessarily, but you consider it.

Now a couple of game play tips :

- **What do you want to pair gyro with, and which heroes you should avoid** : in general, gyro pairs well with a lot of lineups because he is a very flexible carry. However, he gets along best with pushing lineups, and he is momentum hero. Thus, he works well with heroes that can help him get momentum. like Shadow Fiend or Undying. He also combines nicely with heroes that can combine with his call down, like Magnus, Warlock or Enigma. However, Gyro relies on being able to stay on top of people and hitting them with rocket barrage, while their allies can not help because of your AoE damage. Therefore, heroes that work well against Gyro are those who don’t really care about rocket barrage and can just manfight you. These heroes include : Anti-Mage, Lifestealer (one of your hardest counters), Phantom Lancer (it’s a common misconception that Gyro counters PL, it’s actually the opposite), Troll Warlord, Lone Druid, Slark. He also relies on BKB, so anti-BKB is very powerful against him, especially anti-BKB + burst because he is decently squishy. Gyro feels squishier than normal heroes because he tends to be in the midst of battle so he usually takes damage from multiple sources. Examples of anti-bkb that wrecks him : Batrider, Queen of Pain, TA (TA also wrecks you, you can not take away refraction with rocket barrage I believe, or at least not until level 3 barrage), Tusk, Slardar. Gyro is one of the best heroes to have against Visage, or lineups geared towards early push, or lineups that can’t really do anything about you 5 manning and taking towers early. So try to pick him up vs things like Undying (if you play vs Undy, wait until he uses tomb to use flak), Enigma, Lycan, Drow ranger…

- **MKB is not mandatory early on by any means**. If the enemy heroes are not looking to go for evasion items, you can delay it. You can even go for butterfly before MKB. Also, if you only look to maximize your damage, and the enemies don’t have evasion, daedalus is superior than MKB. MKB gives only 7 damage per flak shot more, but it does a lot more outside of flak cannon.

- **Get into the habit of using your dominated creep to stack, and check the clock often**. It’s an habit you will get over time.

- **Join fights early !** Gyro thrives at getting ahead and then keeping momentum. Much like a Shadow Fiend, you want to join fights whenever you can make an impact, and Gyro starts his peak much earlier than most carries. You can take it to the late game with Gyro, but in the late game you rely on BKB, Satanic and Rapier, so it’s risky.

4. Shadow Shaman

5. Silencer or Dazzle.

The thing with your lineup, in my opinion at least, is that it has no counterpush aside from the Ember, and that takes a lot of time to build up an ember. You can secure every tower + every rosh on the map using serpent wards + tomb and the enemy team can not contest your 5 man unless the lion gets a ravage off, then at 20 minutes you aim at raxing. Also, clock just gets run over by a trilane with a Gyrocopter, in my opinion, even though Clock is very good in the mid game vs a Gyro.

Refresher doesn’t give int either, and agh’s only gives +10. That’s meagre.

Also, Astral Imprisonment forces the bat player to lasso the OD, which is often the best target to lasso anyway, but the fact that it actually *forces* you to lasso the OD means that the enemy supports can just pick abaddon/venge or buy lotus orb and hug OD.

4205,"I played a lot of Visage recently. My record in the past 6 days is 5-1 with the hero, with my only loss being one that I didn’t really deserve except for me picking Medusa as a captain : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/2060019660 (yes, Lich went for Mek 10 minutes after I finished it)

I changed my mentality on the hero quite a bit. Before, I had around 40% wins on him, and here is what I changed in my game play :

- I get levels and farm on him now. I used to play him like a 5, but it doesn’t really work, even with Drow on your team. At the start, I buy wards but let the other support get the courier, and go offlane (I try to dual lane with someone that has lane presence, like Viper, Undying, Weaver, or Lich even). I take a few CS here and there but I spend pretty much every second of my life in lane harassing. Visage has pretty bad attack damage and doesn’t trade well because of his low armor, but taking a casual ring of protection at level 1 and recognising your opportunities to get free hits in helps a lot.

- I used to be quite allergic to mek on this hero, but this has actually its merits. First, in low level pubs, people tend to avoid building mek on cores and take cores that don’t naturally build mek. Second, there are actually quite a few guys who are willing to play supports. Third, it’s rather a small item compared to Agh’s, it’s just a few hundred gold more expensive than to go from medallion to crest, and it has a really easy buildup compared to both of these items. So mek fits my pubs quite a bit more than I expected.

- Thanks to mr lizard, it’s much easier to get multiple hero stomp comboes. (the aoe was buffed 2 patches in a row)

- This hero is insanely fun ! You feel like a pro playing him because he makes himself look as a hard hero even though he is not as hard as people believe him to be, and he gets kills. A lot of kills. I noticed that I tend to have really high hero damage and tower damage as visage, even in my lost game that I linked (well, tower damage was low in this game, but hero damage was high).

There was a moment I was really proud of in [this game](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/2057502343) : in one of the last fights, I got a 3-man familiar stomp off, then the courier delivered me my aghs, and I resummoned right as I got agh’s, which gave me a kill and helped my team secure another one (and we would have killed this pesky qop if I had chained my stuns properly, dammit).

- Enemy team doesn’t have very strong lanes

- We have a good pushing lineup but no mek carrier

- We are on Dire (Enigma is almost unplayable on radiant now)

- The enemy team doesn’t have strong ganking potential.

So picking jungling heroes is situationnal. I would imagine it’s the same for every jungler, but anyway you can squeeze in a few enigma games here and there in this patch.

Before picking a jungling hero, or any hero really (that doesn’t only go for junglers) you should consider what your team needs. If your team needs a ganking hero, doesn’t have cores that take much farming space or has the need for duel for a specific hero (AM, etc) I could see jungle LC being pickable, although if you want to play against an AM I would rather go for Enigma because AM can not handle push strats.

- Vengeful spirit

- Lina

- Lich

- Phantom Assassin

- Bristleback

- Some people recommend Wraith King too (I’m not a fan of him as a beginner hero, he is harder to use than you might think)

- Drow ranger (squishy and requires a bit of item uses at a higher level, so actually not that easy to play)

- Dazzle (if you enjoy supporting, also a very good hero to win games)

- Gyrocopter (very good carry when ahead)

- Invoker (many many buttons to press)

- Meepo (requires you to know the game well and to be extremely aware of your map, also to be fast with your clicking)

- Arc Warden (really fun to play too, but a bit micro-intensive and item use-intensive as well)

So just from watching the dotabuff and your stats (I can’t watch your replay atm) :

- First thing I noticed : you don’t have a quelling blade in your end inventory, but you have a PMS ! That’s a big mistake. Quelling blade gives you and your illusions 40% bonus to your base damage, and PL is an agility hero with high agi naturally. Quelling blade increases your GPM by around 80, it’s way too valuable to sell so early. Always sell PMS before QB. Usually, since PL is not very slot restricted, I sell QB around minute 40 on him.

- You don’t have any health regen. That is a big deal. On PL, you either want a bottle (probably not in this game, you have CM), a casual morbid (if you go drums), or a vlad’s. My usual build is boots -&gt; vlad’s -&gt; sometimes yasha -&gt; bots.

- Because of that, your GPM is absurdly low, at around 450. You should aim for 550-600 GPM on PL, at the very least (500 if you get stomped).

- It’s a pretty bad PL game, but there are not many good PL games in this patch honestly.

- Good point for you : you have boots of travel. You don’t want treads on PL anymore, it doesn’t really do a lot for you compared to what BoTs bring you.

- 200 tower damage on a PL is really bad, and that’s partially explained by your lack of QB because you probably sold it too early, along with the fact that you don’t have vlad’s.

- You didn’t die a lot, which is quite good against Invoker and Lion with dagon (WTF ?)

- Your skill build is not very good. I would have put more points into stats. Since you needed Doppel for everything in this game, I would probably have gone for a 4-2-1-1 build into 4-2-1-2 at level 11 andthen max doppel, then alternate between stats and rush, taking ult at 16.

- It might have been one of the very few games in which you want BKB on PL. In general you don’t really want the item because you have manta + 2 mobility spells so you don’t need it, and it doesn’t bring anything to your illusions.

4249,"The thing with supports is that they are picked for a reason. And it’s not only because they can harass early on, that is only one of the many things a support can do.

- Silencer, as a support (and to some extent as a core too) is picked for one reason : his ult. It has global range, fucks up everything, and costs a lot of mana but has a long cooldown so you don’t really need a lot of mana regen. You can transition, but the point of Silencer is not to hit hard.

- Zeus, if played as a support, is mostly picked to fuck up blink daggers and to have late game potential with static field. Lightning bolt is cast really rarely if Zeus is supporting past the laning stage. He can be played as a support, but it’s rare.

- OD is picked for lane domination, his ability to save allies or banish enemies for a long time, his ultimate, and his int steal to a smaller degree. His ultimate does fuck all if he doesn’t have items and levels because he needs intelligence from his stat growth and items for it to be effective. Using AI to its full potential also requires to be a core. OD in general has a pretty terrible range, so as a support his potential decreases even more because of that.

- Skywrath mage is picked for 2 reasons : his instant silence (remember TI4 when he was picked against Brew a lot ?), and the combo with his ulti (clock + sky, etc). Both have insane range, they don’t need any item to function, and Skywrath mage can do work with just these 2 spells. That means he can stay really far back and spam.

- Viper is picked for his ability to dominate a lane, his BKB-piercing anti-carry ultimate, and his pushing ability with mek. None of these abilities can be used well if he is supporting, except an ult here and there if the enemy carry is badly positionned. He needs a good mek timing, which is not really attainable as a support in a normal game. He shits on the enemy mid laner, which is wasted potential if you play him as a support. He has a passive which encourages him to stay in the middle of fights and build bulky items. A support viper would never be bulky in a normal game.

- Visage builds Crest and kills rosh quickly, Lycan kills rosh quickly

- These 2 are great at pushing

- Howl has a shorter cooldown than Precision aura.

Also, Visage is fun as hell to play, but don’t play him as a 5.

If you are playing against a good dazzle… Well, to be honest i’m not sure.

But the problem is that any decent dazzle positions himself so as to not get caught. I play quite a bit of Dazzle and I’m not really afraid of Axe.

Dazzle is pretty bad against push strats with good counter initiation, though. So try heroes that are naturally good at that. Such heroes include Silencer (counter-initiation), Chen (push), Visage (push), Drow ranger (push), Tide (counter-initiation), Lone Druid (push and counter-initiation)… You get the idea. But the most important thing is to play this strat well. That’s also why Dazzle is so good in pubs.

The only reason why I would ever go for Orchid is if I felt that in that particular game, it’s necessary to have Skadi, because Orchid doesn’t take any UAM slot. But even then, if you have deso you can go for diffusal which is wonderful on Clinkz (dispel dusts, add physical damage to your attacks that gets amplified by deso, mana burn synergyzes well with strafe…)

I think the reason why Clinkz has such a bad winrate is that most players don’t understand the hero and play him badly. Orchid is one of the symptoms of that. There is really no reason for Clinkz to have such a bad winrate when Slark, a much weaker hero overall, has above 50%. At least that’s my impression.

So, let me answer point by point : first of all, no hero is a pure right clicker. Every hero has actives. It doesn't make orchid a necessary pickup on every hero. Their supports are casters : again, it's true for every hero, and in this particular game the 2 supports (lina + jakiro) both carry eul's naturally. Eul's dispels silences, effectively making orchid on clinkz a waste of about 2000 gold since you can have just as much mana and damage with medallion + soul ring. The reason why you want deso almost every game on Clinkz is that not only does it help you ganking, it allows you to be a pushing monster and to kill supports in about 3-5 shots between 15 and 20 minutes in, but also to kill their cores with ease unless they are heroes like DK, Spirit Breaker, Visage or Dark Seer, in which case you can bang on a tower. If you don't believe me, believe every single player on the top 100 clinkz ladder on dotabuff. They go most of the time for deso+crest, but sometimes only one of those 2. There is also a reason why Orchid has a 49% winrate and deso has a 57% winrate when deso is actually cheaper.

4282,"My most played hero ! He is quite fun to play as a support. http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?hero=lion

So here are the pros and cons of picking Lion, for me :

- Good at zoning and disrupting mana-reliant, immobile offlaners (Bristleback, Nyx, Tide, Ogre come to mind)

- Good ganker in the mid game if he has blink

- Good initiator later on

- Doesn’t fall flat on his face in the late game because hex is instant, and therefore sort of bypasses BKB

- Good ganker on the mid lane if the situation calls for it

- Doesn’t really need anything past blink.

Cons :

- Reliant on having a good start

- Can not really play the « 5 » role that well

- Very one-dimensionnal

- Can not farm quickly

- Can not really be picked every game

- Hex got nerfed so it affected Lion quite a bit

- Glimmer cape is very good against Lion.

That being said, even though he is a good hero, I usually find Lion to be a nice pick in about 5-10% of my games now. He used to be extremely good in 6.83, back when Hex was a lot better, games stretched on for long, supports were poorer overall (Lion only needs tranquils + blink to be effective), glimmer didn’t exist, 5-manning was a lot less prevalent, and heroes like Slark and Medusa were actually good. Now, there is usually a better pick than Lion (Ogre, Slardar as a support, Shadow Shaman in some ways) do a better job than him. He is a situationnal pick.

So I try to pick Lion when :

- I know we have another support that can buy wards until I get blink

- We need initiation

- We have good lanes (Lion doesn’t really have answers to agressive offlaners like Undy because, like AM, he is weak when contested but extremely good when he has the upper hand)

- We have plenty of defensive capabilities (Omni as a second support or as an offlaner, carries that can sustain by themselves…)

- The enemy team has mana-reliant offlaners.

Now let’s move on to how to play Lion.

Usually, at the start of the game, you want to get regen (but no clarity, it’s not needed, you may need a mango but usually you don’t need clarity), courier and wards or sentries if the other support bought courier and wards, and if you can get a bit greedy get a ring of protection. Lion has bad armor early on and he builds tranquils naturally.

At level 1, leave your skill point. Most of the time you will want earth spike, but in some situations you will need hex (example : you are with an AA that got chilling touch first. In this case you do more damage with hex because you will deal extra damage with your auto attacks and you need to hold them in place). You almost never want Mana Drain at level 1. You can fight really well at the rune and abuse Earth Spike’s short cooldown at level 1 and the fact that you can use it twice. Your base damage is also really good as of 6.83. 

In lane, zone and use earth spike for it when it’s at least level 2 and you have at least one point in mana drain. If you have little mana, usually you want to drain creeps in the jungle from the hard camp near the lane. Mana drain is mostly a GTFO spell and you will almost never make use of its full channel, and if you do that means you were better off casting other spells and auto attacking. Most of the time you don’t want to pull, you are better off zoning, but consider it. Also be aware of the enemy wards and when you drain a camp do it outside of enemy vision to scare their mid.

Your first items are Tranquils and Blink in 99% of your games. You can argue going for brown boots into blink but it’s much harder to do, it makes you less sustainable by yourself and it doesn’t help your blink timing that much. Before your blink, **do not die**, and try to get the other support to buy wards, he will thank you later. Keep a TP on you to countergank. Your blink timing varies depending on the game, but from my experience 15 minutes is very good (a few kills + farming with earth spike in the jungle and leaving the carry alone), and 30 is quite bad but okay. **You always need blink, every single game. There is never a reason not to go for Blink on Lion**.

After you get Blink, you play like a 3/4 position Slardar. When ganking, start with Blink-Hex, ulti right away on your target, fall back a bit to let your allies engage, and when your hex finishes stun the guy. Exceptions to this playstyle are vs heroes who need to be specifically controlled when they are low HP (Huskar, Terrorblade…) or when your team chains their stuns with you. In this case, let them stun after your hex and then spike at the end. When fighting, use blink wisely and try to get a 2-3 man stun with it. It’s always possible to draw a line between 2 heroes so you should always try to stun 2. Hex an important target and ulti right away, then back off and drain from afar if you can. Then reengage with blink and spike. Hex, blink, and Earth spike have very similar cooldowns so you don’t really feel the need to wait for any of them usually. Usually, you want to hex the enemy carry, their mid, the guy who is focused, or the guy who has a very important spell (Shadow Fiend…).

Your next items after blink can vary, but I found force staff to be usually your best choice. Other items include Eul’s, Glimmer, Crest, Ghost, and Agh’s (but i go for agh’s very rarely now, there are so many items that are better than that). In the late game, there are always the options of Eblade, Hex (MOAR CONTROL), and refresher.

Here are a few common pitfalls that I’ve noticed from Lion players in pubs :

- Bad itemization (*something something* Tranquils into mek into agh’s). Mek is almost never a good choice on Lion and Agh’s tends to be really over prioritized over mobility.

- Picking Lion in wrong situations. That happened to me often when I played Lion in 6.84 and 6.85. 

- Not playing the lane properly, in particular not zoning well.

Now what to do if you are against a Lion that knows what he is doing ? Well, there are actually quite a lot of options. First, something that disables hex (Lotus Orb, Diffusal, Greaves, Abaddon shield). Second, Force staff to help a hexed guy disengage. Third, Glimmer cape is a wonderful item to have against Lion. Fourth, Silencer with quick fingers wrecks him. Fifth, getting agressive lanes and making sure Lion’s lane loses is a godsend against him. Lion relies on a good start.

4292,"It’s the same concept as Tread switching to int before using spells : mana efficiency, and percentage versus raw values.

To simplify, let’s say you are a hero with 750/1500 mana, but you have items that grant you a total of 500 mana and a soul ring. If you use soul ring right away, you will have 900 mana and be able to cast one spell basically for free.

Now if you drop your items, you will end up with 500/1000 mana because **when you drop/pickup items or alter your stats in any way, percentages stay the same**. So you are still half mana. Now let’s assume you use soul ring now, you have 650/1000 mana. Which means if you pick your items back up, you will have 65% of 1500 mana, so 975/1500. As you can see, by using a soul ring in a smarter way, you just gained 75 mana, which doesn’t seem like much but really adds up.

That’s the same concept with dropping arcanes before you use soul ring. Arcanes give you +mana, so if you drop them your max mana goes lower and your soul ring goes a longer way for when you pick them back up. You can also do that with any item that gives you intelligence or mana. Just don’t take too many risks with it, or this sort of thing can happen to you : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Cg62WLeOg",2015-12-30 15:15:57+00:00,cyg68a5,3.0,t1_cyg5yfq,539.0,learndota2

4294,"Shift queuing comes in handy a lot for channeled spells and dropping/picking up items.

I started using shift queuing for TPs, ward placements and rune pickups, and now it’s an habit : whenever I TP, I always shift queue. It allows you to not waste a split second on it. Basically, when you are channeling your TP shift queue and as soon as it ends you will move. Really useful for bottle usage or spell usage if you TP to a lane too. For runes, right click on the rune and shift click to pick up the rune on the fly. For wards, same thing.

Now, for some heroes, you use shift queuing more. For example, heroes with a long channeling and a targeted spell, like Bane, Enigma or CM, make use of it. Say you are playing enigma. You can get on top of someone, pulse, use black hole, and when you are channeling, shift queue malefice. This way, when they get out of black hole, they get stunned again right afterwards. You can also shift queue an attack on him if you don’t have auto attack after spell. Some deal with Bane and brain sap, or CM with any spell really.

Shift queing is also very useful when you play Omniknight, Techies, or any hero that goes for Arcanes+Soul Ring naturally. You can drop your arcanes on the ground at a certain distance from your hero and shift queue soul ring. This way, you are much quicker with soul ring usage and you are more efficient. It also allows you to drop a lot of items in a very small amount of time if you are worried that much about invisible heroes but yet need mana efficiency.",2015-12-30 14:59:54+00:00,cyg5r0a,1.0,t3_3ysdtc,868.0,learndota2

4302,"I got a replay for you !

https://yasp.co/matches/2037161619/

It was a batrider game. Level was around 2.5k I believe (unranked so I’m not sure). I was stacked with the Lone Druid and she did really well.

I went to the offlane but was forced to share the lane with Troll who pseudo-denied me, so I ended up in the same position as an actual offlaner : very little gold and XP. I died a few times because I underestimated shards’ and snowball’s damage. Then I got blink at a reasonable time but quite late still (15 minute blink). I didn’t get much farm, but eventually I got force staff and saved up for Gem (which I thought was necessary against Nyx + Tusk with Silver Edge). I ended up buying 3 gems and a refresher too towards the end of the game, because for some reason the enemy team tried really hard to lose and we got a lot of comeback gold.

So here are my questions :

- What do I do when I’m underfarmed early on (aka no blink) and my jungle is pretty much occupied as bat ? I thought of Smokes, but without blink and on a hero who has 1200 day vision, it’s not ideal.

- How do I die less ? Tusk got me out of position quite a bit of times and sometimes I could not even lasso.

- Whom do I focus first ? And was I fight efficient at all here ?

- I tried to always use Firefly when going on a target, but this was probably too safe at some points and I wasted a few kills doing that, in my opinion. When should one not use firefly ?

And if you make a bat or beastmaster guide, I would be pleased to read it. Thanks in advance for your time.",2015-12-29 10:10:38+00:00,cyetyn2,1.0,t3_3ymo3w,11394.0,learndota2

The thing with LC jungle is that it started as extremely efficient when LC was released, then it became really bad, then it got decentish but not very good (too spawn-dependant), and now it’s actually decent because of Iron Talon.

&gt; This doesn't apply to ench/chen/enigma/NP i presume as people can start ganking and help lanes early,

For enigma, it’s not exactly the case, but it’s damn close. NP can teleport as soon as he gets level 2 and enigma can not rotate until at least level 6, but from my experience with enigma it’s mostly around level 8, when you have mek.

The thing is that junglers are mostly hated because they are played badly. But a good jungle LC can have a big impact on the game in my opinion in this patch. Iron Talon really made it more viable.",2015-12-27 20:59:35+00:00,cyd2d95,1.0,t3_3yezo3,12139.0,learndota2
4311,"This question is actually interesting. I had posted something about it a few months ago, but now the mechanics over it are a bit changed so time to calculate again.

Let’s pretend that you are a carry with 300 last hits at around 45 minutes into the game because you know your role a bit. Out of these, 200 are lane creeps, 100 are neutrals. You know how to position yourself so you didn’t feed too much. I will add 2 towers last hit and 4 kills (you would probably have more, but I’m also counting deaths which are lost gold). That would yield a result similar to this game (I was TA) : https://yasp.co/matches/2033777630/farm

As you can see, in this game, I had around 12000 gold from creeps at the end of the game, but also 5400 from heroes, 3500 from structures taken. I will not count roshan gold because I was TA, one of the best heroes to take rosh, so it would be unfair to add this if you want to consider any hero. TA buys deso naturally so I would decrease the gold gained from structures to 2000 if you have a hero that’s worse at pushing.

That leaves us with a theoritical farm of 12000 + 5400 + 2000 = **17400**.

I had 13 kills in this game. Let’s theorycraft what 13 assists would have brought instead of 13 kills. I will use data from this page along with this match’s : http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Gold

This game had only 2 kill streaks, a killing spree and a mega kill on BH. Let’s suppose I had interrupted both (even though I’m fairly sure it wasn’t the case), so we will also substract this to find out which value was lost from being KS’d.

So the gold obtained from those streaks *alone* would be 240.

Killing someone, on top of the AoE gold, also gives 100 + 9×enemy hero level. The AoE gold is shared evenly. If you assume the enemies I killed were on average level 16 (since I got active decently late), that’s a bonus of 13×(100 + 9×16) that I would have lost from KSing.

So in total, being stolen **13 kills**, I would have lost 240 + 13×(100 + 9×16) = 3412 gold. Since I had 600 GPM and the game lasted about 41 minutes, without these kills I would have ended up with about 520.

It’s not significant at all. Keep in mind that these calculations were made with **13 kills stolen**, and with hypotheses that inflate gold obtained from kills (including every streak of the enemy, etc).

Now, for comparison :

- Buying every obs as soon as it comes off cooldown decreases your GPM by 25

- Having only 200 CS instead of 300 would decrease your GPM by about 80-100 in this game (more than being stolen 13 kills with these hypotheses)

- Unless you are Arc Warden, having a midas increases your GPM by about 80-100 as well

**Conclusion** : It’s in your head. If you feel that you don’t have enough impact, it’s either because you are not efficient enough, your team is fucking you up, or you are fucking up in some ways (not going on the right target, not having BKB…)

Keep in mind that giving supports kills also impacts their economy very significantly compared to what it does for cores. More often than not, it’s more profitable to let your supports take the kills when they rotate for ganks, for example.",2015-12-27 17:18:41+00:00,cycuhcu,1.0,t3_3yepoi,3969.0,learndota2

I found that going just for morbid + diffu doesn’t make you tanky enough whereas vlad’s does.

- If that’s the case, you should pick Drums+Wand, probably, and if you fall behind you can consider treads.

4333,"Okay so I feel there are a ton of misconceptions about PL in this post. As someone who has PL as his second most played hero and picked a lot of PL even into Earthshaker during 6.84 (http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?hero=phantom-lancer), here are my 2 cents :

- Let’s start by taking a look at PL’s stats. Strength 21 + 1.7 Agility 29 + 2.6 Intelligence 21 + 2, 4 base armor, 290 base MS, and the rest is pretty standard. His base stats are rather high (especially agility), but his strength growth is bad. He has a low base movespeed, but you don’t really notice it because of his spells which leads me to my next point.

- PL has 4 spells : Spirit Lance, Doppelgänger, Phantom Rush, Juxtapose. That’s when PL starts to be misinterpreted as a hero. A lot of new PL players see his skills as the following :

Nuke + illusion

Moar illusions

Go on top of someone for moar illusions because of ult

Moar illusions when you bumrush on someone

Whereas I see it like this :

Nuke + blink cancel/manaburn

Escape

Engage

Pushing power/manaburn

In clearer words, **PL is not about creating an army of illusions, PL is about abusing his mobility, split pushing and jumping/disengaging in fights**. PL is very close to a hero like Slark in this regard. I will explain it further in my next point.

- Here is my way of playing PL. I don’t pretend to be the best PL in the world by any means, but I win a lot with it in my (shit) bracket. You go safelane, and farm. You get stout-tango-salve-branches for starting items. You get quelling blade, brown boots (**you almost never want treads on PL, so don’t upgrade your boots yet !**), then vlads/drums (if you get drums, get a basi too and some form of HP sustain, it helps), then either get yasha or go straight BoTs. Until BoTs, your playstyle is very standard for a carry in the early game. You can start making jungle rotations but the most important thing is to **pressure your lane when the enemy offlaner(s) leave(s)**. When you are level 6-7, you can pressure lanes really well because you have illusions to tank towers and creep waves, and you have at least a basi to help. At that point, watch the map too, you can sometimes help in fights.

After you get BoTs, occupy the enemy jungle and split push. They have a very low cooldown, and you should abuse it. Don’t stay beside your illusions and creepwaves against an Earthshaker when he is off the map, of course. That’s the same thing as dealing with shaker as brood.

In fights, spam spirit lance, it’s going to be your highest damage contribution until you get items like diffu. When you see that you can pick off someone, rush on them, auto attack until dead and retreat. Use doppelgänger when necessary. Keep in mind that you have to think ahead a *lot* more than before because Doppelgänger is no longer instant and your turn rate + doppelgänger cast time make up for a very noticeable amount of time. That’s partially what made PL quite bad since 6.85, but I’m getting offtopic. That’s exactly why I told you PL works like a Slark. Except he has manaburn from diffusal instead of essence shift, more range, and his panic button has a higher cast time.

- Your items don’t change much, even against an earthshaker. If you are really worried about being slammed (and in that case you play PL wrong), get heart after diffu. Diffu is pretty much always your first big item after BoTs, because no other item makes your hero what he is and you need it rather early. But usually, you want manta after diffusal, because manta allows you to dispel silences and reliably have illusions hitting a target and depleting his mana. And to make it clear : **unless you are 100% sure that you are safe from being jumped and killed, your manta illus will be separated from your hero**. They will attack a target that you want to prevent from going in the fight or a target who has a blink that you want to disable, or someone heavily reliant on mana. The best targets for that are Lion, Earthshaker, Dark Seer… You get the idea. If you desperately need to tank up, the way to go is usually Skadi though. The stats are very nice on an illusion hero, but most importantly the slow and +25 strength are wonderful for your main. PL is squishy and you need to make up for that. I always end up going for Skadi after Manta if I got manta.

I hope I helped. Again, shaker is one of your counters that has the least arguments against you as PL. Tell me if you want some further explanations. Good luck on PL ! He is pretty bad as a carry this patch IMHO, but if you master the hero he can be an autowin in 5-10% of your games.",2015-12-25 10:16:40+00:00,cyavbaf,1.0,t3_3y4qkx,37931.0,learndota2
4334,"There is a medusa guide that helped me immensely. It’s a bit long, but completely worth reading : http://www.playdota.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1463830

The main things to take away from that post are :

- Don’t pick medusa if you are not sure the enemy team won’t have something like AM, PL, Slark, Nyx, etc.

- Medusa sucks these patches.

- Don’t ever go for Manta Style, it’s probably the worst carry item for medusa because of its mana cost and illusions not getting mana shield.

- Bloodstone is medusa’s heart, it gives a shitload of mana regen and mana regen is important on medusa. Medusa doesn’t really naturally build mana regen unless you have to go linken’s. You only go for linken’s against AM, and if you are against AM you don’t want to pick medusa in the first place.

- Mask of Madness is extremely underrated on Medusa, combined with the ulti. Medusa doesn’t really need the movespeed from that except for farming and if you use it when you ult in fights you negate the damage amp, which makes this item still really worth it even after its nerfs. It also gives you much needed HP regen (Phase/Treads + Soul Ring + MoM makes you able to sustain indefinitely)

- Use snake as much as you can for farming. If you use it on golems, be sure you send it when golems are really low so as to make it bounce on shard golems too.",2015-12-25 09:39:07+00:00,cyauvbx,1.0,t3_3y63cr,1476.0,learndota2

Also, on Slark you usually don’t want aquila, but drums instead. Aquila is very decent, but drums are that much better because of the movespeed aura. Also, the bonus HP helps with farming because as I said, it reduces the downtime between camps (you lose the same HP in a camp roughly but you take less time to regen it because you regen more per second).",2015-12-23 08:14:04+00:00,cy8revm,3.0,t1_cy8gngz,24102.0,learndota2
4350,"Neither, unless you need blink+ablade to kill someone like AM or QoP.

Here are the reasons :

- Slark needs tankability, mobility, and stats. Blink or Shadow Blade give no tankability, no stats, and less mobility than you would think. They don’t give you any move speed in vision.

- Shadow blade gives you mana problems on a hero that’s mana reliant. Blink doesn’t give any regen or HP so it’s sort of a hindrance either.

- HP items actually increase your farming speed on Slark, because your ult regens a percentage of max HP per second so it reduces your time between camps regening.

- I already told you this, but let me add it one more time : **Slark needs HP**. Really.

On Slark, usually you build Treads, Wand, Drums, SnY and then one of the following : BKB, Butterfly, Skadi, Moon Shard, Basher. In the late game, you can disassemble SnY to get Silver Edge + Manta, if you need to break passives or think manta will be useful. Manta is very nice on Slark because illusions get essence shift stacks.

4352,"You can climb as a support, but it’s less fast than climbing as a mid/carry, especially the former. If you want to climb by playing support, you need to realize a few things :

- You need to figure out your role, and let me give you a hint : supporting is not buying courier and wards, then staying behind your carry in vision and denying in lane. Supporting is to dota what Knights and Pawns are to chess : the kings of early movements and those who set up the pace early, but still contribute later. That means a lot of stuff : depending on your hero, it might be disabling the right enemy (if you play Disruptor, Skywrath Mage…), stealing the right spell as Rubick, saving your ally as Dazzle/Abaddon, using Guardian Angel every time Jugg ults someone close to you as omni because he was stupid enough not to buy diffu vs a jugg…

- You need to pick heroes who have late game impact. Really, it’s my only advice about which hero to pick. You can pick something like Visage if you are comfortable with him, Witch Doctor, Enigma (it’s not exactly a support, but you get the idea). Mine is witch doctor : http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?hero=witch-doctor

- You need to watch the clock and the mini map. Sounds simple, but checking every 5 seconds or so on the enemy heroes that show up is a big deal. Check enemy items. Check everything. And of course, use the clock wisely, to time roshan, stacks, and spells.

- Ward placement. Now I have quite some trouble with this, especially vs invis heroes (Riki is one of my nightmares), but it’s important to work on that, and it couples with awareness.

- Teamfight/gank execution. As a witch doctor player, I learned to wait out enemy disables before using death ward. In general, you need to be careful. Even as a support, your death is to be avoided.

4363,"There are 2 ways to build KotL : a hard support KotL and a jungling KotL.

So about your question : it depends. In general, the earlier you will have agh’s, the less you want tranquils. That is because illuminate always heals during daytime when you have agh’s, and because BoTs are such a wonderful item on KotL. It makes you and one teammate rats. Anyway, after Agh’s, you can go for BoTs even if you already have tranquils, and usually that’s what I do when my agh’s was delayed.

As a jungling keeper (do it on dire btw, it’s much more efficient than on radiant), you should get agh’s around minute 15 if you are not contested. Look up youtube videos for that, it’s not very complicated. You need quelling blade and a few clarities (3 usually, you only need to but in case you fuck up you can get 3).

As a support, it depends, but generally you don’t need agh’s that early. Try to farm empty lanes and push them with illuminate once you get past level 5 or so, and beforehand try to stack the jungle for yourself.

After agh’s, you will find out quickly that you roll on money. So buy wards, smokes, and dusts. It will relieve your other support of that.

4385,"There are a few reasons for that, in my opinion :

- Slardar’s popularity. A hero that has Wave of Terror synergizes very well with another source of armor reduction (amp damage) and there is vengeance aura which is also amplified.

- Medallion nerf on rosh makes -armor heroes like TA, slardar and Venge more valueable. You don’t have a free wave of terror to hit rosh with now.

- It’s a recurrent thing in 6.85 : carries fight a lot. You don’t really see the likes of Medusa, PL or Drow (unless you’re VP keepo) anymore because they don’t suit this playstyle. On the other hand, fighting heroes like Viper or Venge, who are notoriously bad at farming, are popular because they can join fights and impact them constantly.

- Venge hits quite hard in the mid game because of how the hero works

- Dazzle and Wyvern (RIP :'( ) being popular meant she can survive an agressive swap, when in patches like 6.83 venge had mostly a sacrificial role and was played as a support.

- Since fighting has become so much more relevant, pushing power is less of a worry, so you don’t have to pick split pushers anymore (like PL or AM).

- I first picked AM, which is never a good idea, but I wanted to practice on him. He is one of my comfort heroes. The enemy team got a good draft against me, IMHO : Slardar and Disruptor in particular (and they shut me down quite hard in the early game).

- I’m under 10 CS per minute, which is quite bad. Any advice on my farming patterns, if someone is kind enough to watch the replay ? My GPM was also unacceptably low for an Anti-Mage, even though I had to buyback. I had to have at least 700 GPM this game.

- I sat in the enemy jungle and in the enemy safe lane to farm them during the majority of the game. The reasoning behind it was that I would prevent the enemy team to get farm and secure a lead for my ursa and my jungling WK (yes, jungling WK…)

- For some reason, it was not a support Sky and a mid Zeus, but the other way around. Ursa was also offlane and WK was jungling early.

I thought we got extremely badly outdrafted, but I would like to have your thoughts on this game. Especially on the way that I farmed. Since my team was not farming at all, should I have just taken all the defensive farm for myself ? Also, how do you deal with multiple arcanes and greaves ? And last question : should I have gone for Heart or BKB over Bfly ? I was split during the game, ended up going for Bfly since I thought I needed to split push, but stupidly TPed in my base instead of trying to trade rax at some point.",2015-12-15 22:23:07+00:00,cy0abeu,1.0,t3_3wzxe0,912.0,learndota2
4405,"Just speaking of the draft here :

As a slark player, I can tell you it’s a really bad slark game. Sprit breaker against Slark is one of the worst individual matchups I could think of in the game (almost as bad as Huskar vs AA or PL vs Storm or Ember). Picking Slark second is a bad idea in general because litterally 80% of the hero pool shits on him, and picking him when Spirit Breaker is available to the enemy team is suicidal.

Their first bans don’t make sense, yours are good. I can get by a spectre ban, she is a pubstomper. Winter Wyvern is a very good first pick. They first picked Earthshaker and Witch Doctor. Normally, it’s a bad idea to pick 2 supports first, because the support combo reveals a lot about the draft, so here I would have assumed that Shaker was offlaning. Which would have justified a Slark pick later, as a 4th or 5th pick. But a lot of people do this mistake of picking 2 supports early so you can not safely make this assumption.

So your slark pick is a big mistake here, because you have to devote your next bans to ban out bad Slark matchups and the enemy team has a lot of heroes to fill in this draft to counter him. Remember : Slark is very easy to counter. PL, AM, Disruptor, QoP, Storm, Nightstalker, KotL, Nyx Assassin, and a LOT of other heroes have a favorable matchup vs him.

Their 3rd and 4th bans don’t make sense, yours are OK but not very good. But again, it comes to this Slark pick : you had to have 6 bans at least at this stage because of this pick. You needed to ban Spirit Breaker, QoP, SF if you were banning QoP, Disruptor, AM… You get the idea. Your Huskar ban is not really justified, they didn’t ban AA and you still had QoP, Lina, etc in the draft even if they did.

Spirit Breaker is the only good thing in their draft so far, but it’s a very good one. SB, as I harped on, shits on Slark. At this point, you lost the draft almost certainly. You pick a Nightstalker next, which is OK. Tanky heroes are a good way to beat a Spirit Breaker draft. In this situation, however, I would have picked Clock. Clock is excellent vs Spirit Breaker and Earthshaker, and WD can not really zone him by himself. He also tends to shine against melee carries, restricting their draft and punishing their Bristleback ban.

Their QoP pick is rather smart, even though it’s into a Nightstalker. It restricts your draft, and it kind of pushes your NS to go mid. In your place, in this situation, I would have decided on sending the NS mid and pick Clock, which is still a good pick. However, you pick Lina. Lina is not that bad, but not that great in this draft either. There is little point picking Lina here. Again, you locked yourself into a corner because you know your Slark is going to have a bad game and now you don’t know which mid to pick because you want to pick a secondary carry, but most of them get shat on by QoP (TA, Ember, SF was even banned…). Your least bad option was Viper here, for me. Their axe ban doesn’t make sense (again, their bans are really weird… Were they trying to do an iceiceice and ban shit while outdrafting ?), and your Viper ban… I just talked about Viper being good for you, you banned him.

They put the nail on your coffin with the Gyro last pick. On paper it’s not very good because you have a lot of anti-BKB and it’s one of the very few heroes Slark is good against. But that means they have a very strong lineup to go in your face from 10 to 25 minutes and you can’t do anything about it, *and* they have better late game than you. At this point, you are royally fucked. You picked Tusk to salvage your draft, and for how bad your draft before was it’s actually quite OK (you decided to send your NS mid, good choice). But you were outdrafted extremely hard.

Speaking of the game, Slark bought a Vlad’s (???), you built mek on Winter Wyvern and not on Tusk (???), your NS went for Urn and Vanguard (???), and Tusk went for Treads instead of arcanes and Shadow blade instead of Blink + Mek (???).

Edit : Downvoted for answering OP’s question ? Time to go shitpost and farm karma

Edit 2 : I would add SF and Queen of Pain, even if QoP is not really a carry by my standards but a mid-game carry.

For explanations on those heroes :

- Faceless Void has been run as an offlaner a lot in the pro scene a lot when he was popular in 6.81. That was his main role. The reason for that is very simple. He needs 2 things to get online : level 6 and Treads+Mask of Madness. Once you have these, you can farm the enemy jungle, and if you have a teammate with a spell comboing well with Chronosphere (Jakiro, Skywrath Mage…) you can set up kills every time your ultimate is off cooldown. Alternatively, with Chrono you can push a lane and if the enemy team tries to contest you, you can chrono to ensure a won fight. Void works, in some ways, like a Tidehunter. Your ult is an On/Off switch.

- Ember Spirit does a lot of magical damage once he has maxed out Flame Guard and Searing Chains. As you level up Sleight of Fist, usually from levels 10 to 13, your initiation range increases and the mobility BoTs provide you allows you to switch from fighting to farming and healing up in base constantly.

- Phantom Assassin is a hero that naturally scales very well into the mid game, when disables are usually not enough to kill you and the enemy carries don’t have MKB yet. Item builds vary on this hero (skill build is always the same though), but the main thing I wanted you to avoid doing is building Battlefury. It’s a farming item that tends to get you to the late game and you are not that good in the late game. Usually, you get items like Aquila, Drums, Vlad’s, Deso (if you got Vlad’s), basher, BKB, HotD. If you don’t go for Battlefury, you will see that your hero brings a lot to the table during the mid game, around minutes 15-25.

- Alchemist needs items, but he farms so quickly that he comes online rather fast. If you take him mid, you can farm stacks with Acid Spray really well, then proceed to get either a quick radiance, or a quick Solar Crest/Maelstrom/anything you want really. 

- Templar Assassin comes online around minute 13-16, once you get either blink or deso. After clearing a few ancient stacks, you can get one of these items early and then set up kills or push.",2015-12-15 14:22:35+00:00,cxzqgqn,1.0,t3_3wxw8n,349.0,learndota2

4420,"So, for Death Prophet, I only play her mid so I will give advice on mid laning mostly. I believe there is no other lane in which she shines as much as mid.

So for starting items, you do the same as a Windranger. If you can dominate the lane, Nulls/Tango. Otherwise, 2 branches/Tango, 2 pooled tangoes/circlet/2 branches…

In the laning phase, your skill build is the same until level 8 : Swarm - Exorcism - Swarm - Exorcism - Swarm - Exorcism - Exorcism - Swarm. Then at level 9, you decide between skilling silence or ult, but in general skill ult. At level 10, skill the spell you have not learned, at level 11 take ult and then go on normally. The reason you do it in this order is because it’s more mana efficient to have Swarm level 3 and Exorcism level 4 than the other way around, and because you don’t really use ult at level 1 anyway, it’s quite bad at level 1. For items, your first item is bottle, second is boots of speed. Phase boots used to be the only major item you would go for on DP, but now I believe it’s better to go for Treads or Tranquils since you need to beef up. Wand is necessary. Then your first « big item » is Eul’s. After Eul’s, my preferred item is Rod of Atos. It gives you intelligence and most importantly HP, and the active is wonderful. Afterwards, Skadi or Heart are must haves, you should adapt depending on the game. But in general you need survivability.

In lane, you play like a worse SF. You push using Crypt Swarm, then go stack camps, check runes sometimes but you should mostly bottle crow if the enemy team contests runes. Do not attempt rotations early. Really, don’t. It messes up your farm, and unless you have a double kill it’s worth more to keep pressuring the lane mid. If the enemy mid leaves to attempt a rotation, kill their tower ! Especially if you have ult.

In the mid game, your job is pretty simple. If you don’t have ult, you farm. If you have ult, you pick an enemy tower or roshan, and you use ult near it to kill it. Your hero is very good at taking objectives, so use that strength.",2015-12-14 20:35:14+00:00,cxz1681,1.0,t3_3wsyzg,13298.0,learndota2

4425,"I love playing Elder Titan as a support. He is a niche pick, but in some situations he really wrecks face. I only play him as a support.

His advantages are :

- Really good late game with Natural Order

- Can do work from a very long range

- Underplayed hero, so underestimated. At low levels, where I am, no one knows how he works, so the enemy team stays in range of the spirit very often.

- Shreks agi based carries or carries who are not that mobile, like Drow. Heroes like Slark/PL go both ways in terms of matchup, they both counter each other

- The king of rosh fights

I start as a support by going safe lane and trying to secure the farm for my carry, pulling as much as I can to get a quick level 6 and tranquil boots+soul ring. My skill build is Spirit - Order - Spirit - Stomp - Order - Earth Splitter - Spirit - Order - Spirit - Order - Stomp 3 times, then stats until level 16 or so usually, and then ult. Sometimes I get ult at levels 6, 24 and 25. You don’t really need any items after you get tranquils + soul ring, but here are a few that you can get : Force Staff (utility), Eul’s (setup for stomp), Solar Crest (MOAR MINUS ARMOR), Pipe (against Zeus and the like), Agh’s (if you have a reliable setup for your ult and you need a disarm, say you are playing with a bane on your team and you need to disable a Sven for a long time). Every utility item will pretty much work, except Mek and Blink in my opinion. ET is one of the very few heroes that I would never buy blink on because he doesn’t really need it, he has such a huge range already (same thing as buying blink on clock). And mek… Well, ET has mana issues until late in the game and he doesn’t really carry mek naturally because he stands far back. Also he needs tranquils, and if you go mek it’s almost always paired with arcanes nowadays because greaves.

After the laning stage is over, you should try to secure towers for your team. At that time, remember to scout with your spirit ! He has flying movement and cancels blink daggers. If the enemy team tries to contest, put spirit in the middle of their heroes and split them by stomping, they will run away from the stomp. **Keep your spirit on top of an enemy that’s focused** ! Your aura doesn’t have a very long range, and it does some crazy work. Reducing the enemy magic resistance to 0 in the mid game is absolutely crushing.

Now, a point on skill usage. I know a lot of people circlejerk about the fact that your team wakes people up when you want to set your ult up with Stomp. That can happen, however if that happens it’s also because you used Stomp in the wrong way. Stomp should ideally be used on the backlines to prevent them from helping the guy that’s focused. Also, you don’t really need your own stomp to set up your ulti most of the time. A lot of popular heroes in pubs have long lockdown spells (*cough cough* windranger *cough cough*), and you can also predict where the enemies will be in the next couple of seconds. So to put it simply : if your team woke up someone that you stomped, you should have not stomped them in the first place. It’s like Bane’s nightmare.

ET is a very fun hero, and frankly he is not as hard as many people think. Good luck playing him.",2015-12-14 09:27:39+00:00,cxyihjd,1.0,t3_3wq0bq,29367.0,learndota2
4426,"He sort of is, but he doesn’t shit on any other hero like in 6.84.

6.85 Lightning Storm got a huge damage and bounce nerf, which means :

- If you want to last hit with it, you are going to need the enemy mid laner to be near his creeps and a couple creeps dead in the wave already (less harass potential)

- You can still really easily take a tower if the enemy mid leaves (play like a Shadow Fiend in lane : nuke waves with Split Earth+ult, take rune or stack, and if the enemy mid leaves, pressure the tower with Edict)

- His late game is still as scary as before

- He farms differently now. Before, you could do Lightning Storm into ult or Split earth into ult to kill camps or stacks. Now, be it for camps or stacks, you use Ult+Split earth. He doesn’t farm as well as before and he is more reliant on stacks.

4450,"I played a couple games on Elder Titan and didn’t lose a single one, only as a support : http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?date=&amp;hero=elder-titan

I also like playing him quite a lot. Here are my thoughts from these games.

- When to pick : it’s the biggest thing for me. ET shines especially when the enemy team has heroes that want to go for raw stats and that are not mobile. Don’t pick him against heroes like Weaver, Slark (to an extent, Natural order wrecks Slark but he dodges everything), PA, Alch. Do pick against Morphling, Terrorblade, Phantom Lancer, Anti-Mage (sort of)… any stat-based carry is a decent matchup for ET. Good teammates for ET include Tusk (you can take the spirit in a snowball, also Natural order + Walrus PUNCH! = rekage), SF (armor reduction), venge, bane (nightmare sets up stomp or earth splitter), Winter Wyvern (curse sets up earth splitter or stomp, also you amplify all of her damage)…

- A great thing about ET in pubs is that no one picks him, so everyone underestimates Natural Order and everyone will forget to build AC or Vlad’s against you.

- You can not control Astral spirit with « Select all other units » or any of this. You have to set a key manually (mine is 1).

- **As a support**, my skill build is usually 1-2-2-1 at level 6, then 1-4-4-1, then 4-4-4-1, then stats and I take ult at level 18-19 or 24-25 generally. Your build is interesting and probably quite good but my build requires less mana to do stuff in lane (I only need spirit + autos, whereas you rely more on stomp i assume). The reason why you don’t want to take ult at levels 11 and 16 is that the *only* thing that scales with your ult is the slow duration at the end, which is extremely bad (it’s the same idea as skilling medusa, where you go for ult at levels 9/10, 14 and 16).

- In lane, pull whenever you can, you need those levels. From time to time you can use your spirit to harass if you can get a few auto attacks off after you get your spirit back. Try to not use spirit if it’s only level 1, unless you need vision in trees (for example) or you can get quite a bit of autos. In fights, it’s very simple. Try to predict where the enemies will be in the next couple seconds and ult there. Stick your spirit on to as many enemies as possible, or on the hero your team goes on. Use stomp as a followup to a stun, or to lock down the backlines. It comes down to game sense. But basically, you play a bit like a visage with invincible birds that don’t do damage on their own but increase your team’s damage.

- My items at the beginning are always tranquils+soul ring, since I play him as a support. As a core, bottle+treads is usually better (i believe). Then everything is situational. You can go for Force staff, Crest (MOAR MINUS ARMOR), agh’s if you are confident in your ability to hit your ulti, BKB if you want to turn into a core (because ET hits surprisingly hard, with spirit buff + natural order). Eul’s sounds nice but I never felt the need for it.

- Go for dem roshans as ET. Stand outside of the pit if you don’t have medallion/crest. If your enemies do rosh, show them why ET is considered to be a king of rosh fights and contest it.

Here is a game that I played with a 4 stack on a support ET if you want to have an example of everything coming together (I was with everyone but Brew) : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1989265986

- Enemy supports checking runes

- Enemy supports ganking mid (especially things like Spirit Breaker)

- Armor reduction

- Silences before your ult goes off

- Burst damage

But the biggest thing are bounty runes. In my pubs, no one was willing to check runes and secure them for me, so very often I ended up behind in farm, even after you considered stacks. Alch is reliant on these.

4454,"I like the idea, but it can really be improved for me. Here is what I would suggest :

- You have a button on the welcome screen for dota which links to a weekly/biweekly tournament page, or its subscription page

- You can subscribe as a team (and invite your friends) or just solo, in which case the system will create teams at the end of the subscription period

- You can gg out, of course

I would keep the following propositions :

- Tournaments will require you to be in an mmr bracket (like 5000-6000) so teams will be as balanced as possible. Trophies will show the mmr bracket on them (maybe silver 3k-4k, gold for 4k-5k, plat for 5k-6k, diamond for 6k+ or sth)

- If you leave a tournament before it ends/you get eliminated or abandon a game in a tournament you will be banned from entering a tournament for x amount of time. ( optimally a something like a month so its really discouraged ), but a team can withdraw from a tournament if 4 out of 5 people agree to do it.

4476,"&gt; Edit: I know anecdotal evidence doesn't mean much but I played ~30 Unfair bot games with ember before playing him in a real pub, and my first real game with him was something like 9-0-15 as safelane carry.

Same here, after being 20-2 and scores like that against unfair bots when I didn’t have internet for 2 weeks I had quite the success with Ember in pubs :)

The problem with unfair bots, at least for me, is that you can not really play a pickoff hero as well. But it’s a good training for low skill games because people at low MMRs do exactly the same mistakes as unfair bots : they farm poorly (even though they last hit really well in lane), they 5 man too much, do really old and inefficient item builds and skill builds (something something bracer treads tidehunter), and they have in general a poor decision making. They also feed when on your team.

So it’s a good training course for how to play your hero at low MMR and be extra careful. I think bots also prioritize killing the human player but I’m not sure about it.",2015-12-07 07:49:06+00:00,cxq2g6h,5.0,t1_cxq1nae,2538.0,learndota2

- Does Coup de Grâce proc ? If so, we have a crit with 450% of your damage proccing (15% of the time).

- If not, does Daedalus proc ? If so, we have a 250% crit.

- Otherwise no crit.

So the chance to get a daedalus crit is 0.85×0.25, because you can get daedalus crits only if Coup de Grâce does not proc.

4499,"I play KotL from time to time, and I have a pretty good success with him :

http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?date=&amp;hero=keeper-of-the-light&amp;skill_bracket=&amp;lobby_type=&amp;game_mode=&amp;region=&amp;faction=&amp;duration=&amp;enjoyment=any&amp;timezone=Europe%2FBerlin

In some of these games I jungle early on (example : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1958958306), in others I just do hard support stuff (http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1902424858 and yes, I had the most last hits as a support).

Now, a note on jungling KotL : it’s very fun and I like it a lot, it’s not very hard to do, and you should definitely try this once in my opinion. **However**, it’s not something you should do every game, KotL has a lot of potential as a lane support, and getting a fast agh’s/mek is not always a priority.

If you are jungling on Dire and you are not contested, you should aim for a 15-20 minute agh’s (look up videos on youtube for it, it’s pretty simple). If you are lane supporting, just harass, your autos have a very long range and you do decent damage. When you use illuminate to harass, try to predict the enemy movements, coordinate if your lane partner has a stun, and *don’t hit creeps*. It’s important. When I play with a bad KotL as a carry, they always hit 1 creep with illuminate and it’s lane-losing stuff. It might not sound like a big deal but it is.

My first item is almost always agh’s, with potentially tranquils on top of it. For obvious reasons, you don’t go for arcane boots. However, you can skip tranquils if you have a lot of farm and go straight for BoTs. At this point, you become a terrific split pusher. When you BoT to a lane, you can either push it out yourself with Illuminate, or recall an ally to do it. Adapt the mentality of a carry when you have agh’s-BoTs as a KotL. If your other carry has BoTs and can push out waves with spells, it’s even better.

In team fights, your most important spells are blinding light, recall, and mana leak. Recall your carry that’s (hopefully) split pushing, blind a lot of them (unless you have mag or enig), and spam mana leak.",2015-12-03 12:57:51+00:00,cxllbrh,1.0,t3_3v9pa4,5563.0,learndota2

- heroes to NEVER EVER PICK (unless it's for you) : Naga, visage, meepo, chen, lone druid, enigma (trust me, no one is efficient enough to make enig worthwhile), enchantress, phantom lancer, medusa

- only pick if asked : magnus, axe, omni, sf, invoker, gyro, tiny, anti-mage, slark, storm, ember, drow ranger, windranger, alchemist (make sure that he does not go midas), lion, undy, wisp, jakiro

4592,"Your problem with ganking contains many others, I think. So let’s start with the basics.

First of all, why do you gank ? You gank to **secure an advantage**. An advantage can be either an economic lead (« Gank the carry to prevent him from farming ! »), a map control lead (get a gank off to push a tower or ward), or Roshan.

This brings to the next question : **when and where to gank** ? You try to gank to abuse one of your power peaks. For example, your pudge is level 7, he should leave his lane if he is laning and try to set up a gank or create pressure. You can also try to gank in order to abuse the times when the enemy is at their weakest. You notice their Spectre is rushing radiance, what do you do ? You dedicate 2 heroes to shutting spectre down and killing her over and over again.

Now another point to add with this : a rule of thumb that you always can apply is : **Pounce on free kills, push when you can, fight when you have to, farm the rest of the time**. So you gank when you can not push and can not get free kills, and don’t want to force team fights. Now at your MMR it’s probably irrelevant because people 5 man waaaay too much (a tactic that I call « headbutting ») and lose a lot of efficiency because of that, even if they get kills. But keep this idea in mind, evaluate the situation as often as you can. It’s very hard to do, and it comes with experience and practice.

Another very important thing to land your ganks is map awareness and game sense. Do you see any enemy heroes on the map ? What would you do if you were on the enemy team ? It’s a bit tricky to use for me because I’m a very safe player, so I expect the enemy team to play safe and I get baited very often into bad situations because I didn’t expect the enemy team to 5 man. It’s safest to assume that the enemy team is behind a hero if you only see 1 or 2.

Now, how to gank ? It’s all about abusing the enemy vision. Smoke comes in handy for this, so do TP scrolls in the early game. Also, being aware of their likely wards. How would you ward if you were an enemy ? Again, ward awareness is probably a bit irrelevant at low MMR because supports always tend to ward runes and nothing else all game, or place jungle hill wards which are really bad when used defensively.

Good luck ! I can add precisions on that if you want.",2015-11-16 14:06:59+00:00,cx21t2r,1.0,t3_3szxsm,22587.0,learndota2

Then PL doppels out of Timber’s ult and sends illusions at him. PL also drains the whole mana pool of Timber that way, and mana is very important to survival on Timber.

What I’m saying is not that no AoE helps you against PL. It’s that PL fears burst a lot more than AoE. If it happens to be AoE burst, it’s great against PL too. PL has a lot of armor, but no HP until Skadi.

4629,"&gt; Is it simply a lost game. and should we make sure to have AOE next time?

It’s definitely not, PL is not really countered by AoE (except by some very specific spells like Sleight of Fist).

&gt; And for further information, in both the games I was an sf and a slark.

Ouch. Slark in general is a very good matchup for a PL. SF is not as bad, but definitely a good matchup for him.

What were your drafts in both games ? PL has a lot of counters in terms of hero matchups. Especially now, he has become a lot worse in 6.85 than he was before.

PL is weak to many things in fact :

- Silences, until he gets diffusal

- Counterpush and anti-split push

- **burst** (that’s by far the biggest threat to a PL in my opinion)

- evasion (PL hates MKB)

- heroes that are as mobile as him (he relies on mobility)

Now as SF or Slark, you don’t really have these tools (except mobility for Slark), so you are not going to be the one that can deal with a PL. Unless you can, while playing SF, land a eul’s requiem combo with less than 0.1s error.

Some carry heroes that are really good vs PL are Ember Spirit, Phantom Assassin, or Anti-Mage.

4632,"Abaddon is my favorite hero. I had played quite a bit of Abaddon up until 6.84, with 70% winrate over 40 games. I’m quite rusty with the hero, but here is what I remember. Here is my record on him : http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?date=&amp;hero=abaddon

First of all, you got it right, Abaddon is a support. His skillset is a support’s skillset. You could situationnally play him as an offlaner, much like Keeper of the Light, but he is primarly a support.

At the start of the game, in general you want something like Courier + 2 wards + tango + TP scroll + whatever you want. In general, if you want a clarity, one is enough. Mist coil costs little mana. TP is important to get very early because you are a great counter ganker. Same as with Dazzle.

Try to go for dual lanes with Abaddon. Abaddon needs very little farm to be effective, but he needs a decent timing on his level 6. He is also a bit out of place in a dual lane. If possible, lane him with a combo allowing him to play agressively (abaddon-weaver, abaddon-viper, abaddon-sniper… anything that likes farming and has chase). Abaddon is seen as a defensive hero in lane, but it’s a misconception in my opinion. Curse allows abaddon to bully anyone out of lane and even get kills early on. You can go both safe lane and offlane, but I prefer offlane. It also allows you to mess up with enemy junglers.

If the enemy has a greedy jungler like enigma or ursa, try to mess up with him. Even if you die once doing that, you create a lot of space and hinder the enemy farm. Sometimes the enemy mid has to rotate to kill you, which is extremely beneficial to your mid.

Keep your skill point at level 1. Curse can be useful to take if you see a first blood opportunity. Otherwise skilling shield is the safest option and in general the best. Afterwards, you have 2 different skill builds until level 11 :

− Agressive variation : 23111412224 (so 4-1-1-1 at level 7, and 4-4-1-2 at level 11)

− Defensive variation : 21121412234 (so 4-2-0-1 at level 7, and 4-4-1-2 at 11)

1 means first spell (so Mist Coil), etc.

Now I would like to make a point on this because a lot of Abaddon players go wrong with the skill build : first of all, **you always want to max Mist Coil first, NOT aphotic shield**. The reason for that is that Mist Coil has better range, better scaling both in terms of EHP and nuking potential (shield only adds +30 per level, mist coil adds +50), provides sustain to your lane partner (unlike shield), and shield is a fantastic value point because it’s always a strong dispel.

After level 11, some people max curse but I don’t like it. In general, I believe it’s better to go for stats, because as a support you won’t hit many things as Abaddon. So I usually get stats, with ult at level 16. Of course, you can change it as much as you like, but always get ult at 16.

Now for the items. Abaddon needs exactly 2 items to be effective, and these are *Urn of Shadows* (you can sometimes go soul ring instead, especially if you want glimmer cape), and *Tranquil boots*. Urn of shadows allows you to dispel allies so that they disengage, then urn them, and they can run back in with their HP full. For the later items, everything is situational. I usually go for one of these items : Glimmer cape, Agh’s, Vlad’s (when you have melee cores and they ditch their vlad’s), pipe, medallion into crest, and *Force staff* (my most common choice overall). Other notable good items are Eul’s, Hex (if the game drags out), Halberd. I usually don’t get Mek because I play abaddon as a hard 5 so it would come too late, but you can go for it.

Now for the gameplay of your abaddon, it’s pretty simple. In lane, assess your kill potential in lane, how you should behave, and which spells you want to dispel. If you have any kind of kill potential, go for the agressive skill build (aka curse at level 2). When you are level 2, it’s time for the dives. Get your lane partner to dive with you, dispel the spell you wanted (or just cast shield to help them tank tower shots) and get your first kills. As you progress in levels, don’t be afraid to use mist coil when you dive. Also, look out for enemy dives in other lanes and when you see an opportunity, TP in and heal/shield.

In the mid game, you should try to anticipate enemy rotations behind an ally that’s susceptible to them. For example, if you have an AM in your team and the enemy team has a silencer, stay in trees near AM if silencer is missing. You should ideally move in the same places as your opponents, to deter their agression.

In fights, it’s pretty simple. Get an ally to jump in, heal them, then shield them when they get gone on, force them if you have a force staff, and when they have disengaged urn them to get them ready to disengage. *The longer the fight is, the better it is for you*. Towards the end of the fight, run in and try to force them to focus you, then use borrowed time. You can, if you have no proper initiator, run in first. If you do so, you can really split the enemy team in half, which will create a favorable fight. Remember : *no one initiates on an abaddon*. It loses you the fight, it’s stupid. If the enemy team wastes spells on you but then only manage to force borrowed time, you won a fight for your team.

Now, when should you pick abaddon ? Abaddon thrives against **AoE damage and single-target lockdown**. In particular, Abaddon is excellent against Doom (yes, you have an answer to those doom pickers !), Beastmaster, Bane, Batrider (harder to pull off, you may need a blink vs bat), medusa (shield dispels stone gaze !), Gyrocopter… On the other hand, he is notoriously bad vs heroes that need hard stuns or silences to kill, heroes that burn mana, heroes that have single target burst, and heroes with summons that can push very effectively (abaddon has no counterpush except shield). Examples include Slark, Queen of Pain, Phantom Lancer, Anti-Mage, Nature’s prophet, Enigma, Weaver (weaver is very good both with and against abaddon), and the 2 best heroes against you in my opinion are Phantom Assassin and Ursa. Never pick Abaddon against these 2 heroes.

Some tips and tricks on abaddon :

− Always cast heal before shield, heal has a better cast range

− Tranquils only break at the end of your attack, while curse of avernus applies at the beginnig of your attack. So you can keep on applying curse by cancelling your attack, and in this fashion not break tranquils.

− You can farm jungle camps in your downtime with Aphotic shield.

− If you shield yourself during borrowed time, instead of charging shield the damage will heal you. So don’t worry about it if you shielded yourself by mistake.

I hope that helped. Go learn abaddon, he is very fun !

Edit :

&gt; Be careful with Silver Edge though. Even though you can active Borrowed Time manually when you're stunned, you cannot active it when you're silenced or hexed. Silver Edge disable the passive 400 HP auto active part of the skill, so if you're break + silenced/hexed, you won't be able to use Borrowed Time if you fall below 400 HP.

Frankly, if the enemy team goes for a Silver Edge to counter an abaddon, they kind of auto lose the game.",2015-11-08 17:48:28+00:00,cwt0zr5,1.0,t3_3s0k00,6600.0,learndota2

4671,"&gt; I go mid, i upgrade the q one time, and then go e,w untill w is maxed, then e. then i upgrade q and ult.

It’s horrible.

- Luna does not do well mid usually, she is weak in lane because of a bad attack range and being squishy. She also has no way to control how she pushes the lane, and gets ganked easily.

- The skill build you go for almost always is 4-0-1-1 by level 7, saving a skill point at level 4, or 4-0-2-1 by level 7. The reason for that is that your ult is based on your level of Lucent beam, so you need to max that ASAP. Also, your second skill does nothing good for you. It does absolutely nothing to help you : it messes up last hits, pushes the lane when you don’t want to, and it soaks up skill points while points in Beam or Blessing are much more useful.

What you want to do instead is : go safe lane, try to have a ranged support to benefit from Lunar Blessing more. For skill build, the right order is : 311 (save a skill point) 142222 (with use of saved skill point) 4333 Stats 4. There is almost no reason to deviate from this.

4695,"For myself, after bottle-treads-blink-aghs, I choose between the following :

- Manta style : dispels silences, and gives AS which is great on Tiny. Illusions don’t get cleave from the ult, however they get bonus damage from it I believe.

- Butterfly : I build it quite often. The evasion on it and the MASSIVE agi bonus is very nice. It helps you take down buildings that much faster.

- AC : Very standard and very good item too for Tiny. I would build it against SF for example (because of Presence of the Dark Lord), or in an ideal game. Armor and Attack speed are very much needed on Tiny, and the armor reduction helps to push.

- Daedalus : I very rarely build it, even later on. However, it’s a nice item, giving you a lot of raw damage. I almost always go for AS items on Tiny though, I think it’s better to go for AS in general because of how much damage your ult gives.

- MKB : If they have evasion.

- Satanic : I almost never buy early, but it’s sometimes worth it. You rarely manfight on Tiny, but in combination with BKB it’s a very good item.

- BKB : I try to get it after Bfly/AC usually, I don’t think going BKB first is really worth it in a lot of cases unless you have an Io or something. BKB is great on Tiny, but as always with BKB it’s very easy to waste it and it doesn’t help your farm.

- Moon shard : AC is better, but after AC it’s a good item *if you can get away with it*. It doesn’t give the physical survivability of Butterfly, the disjoint/dispel of manta, the magic immunity of BKB, it just gives damage. Fun item, but very rarely will you need it.

This is a big misconception, particularly the part I’ve put in bold. Supports can scale very well into the late game, while cores can fall flat. In fact, very often, your late game potential does not come from your carry, and sometimes not even from one of your cores, but from your supports.

4711,"Since you are talking about how to play vs an AM and not how to draft vs an AM, I will try to be as hero-independant as possible.

AM has actually quite a bit of weaknesses. In particular, here are a few ways to deal with him :

- He is vulnerable if he gets an unfavorable lane matchup, but he is great if he gets an even slightly favorable lane matchup. The reason for this is because he is a squishy melee hero, but he has mana break so he trades very well early. So put heroes that deal very well with him and try to dual or trilane him. In particular, heroes who are good against him include Brood, dark seer, centaur, and qop.

- Even after you notice he has battlefury, gank him if you have enough lockdown. AM usually stays in his jungle, but spends also some time in the enemy jungle if it’s not dangerous for him (aka if the enemy team has few silences). And of course, he split pushes. So get TPs and counterpush. Waveclear is extremely good against AM, because it limits his effectiveness.

- Get an orchid if you have a hero that carries it well. AM usually gets Treads-BF-vlads-manta around 25-27, so until that time you can gank him repeatedly with an orchid. If he has manta or he will before you finish orchid, don’t bother getting orchid though.

- Armor reduction. AM has spell shield, but his base armor is pretty bad. That’s especially important when you want to manfight him. The obvious example (and it’s a very good hero vs AM) is TA, but there are many more.

- Outcarry him. AM is a hero that wants to finish the game at around 45 at the latest. If you have a hero that peaks later such as Spectre or Void, you can create pressure instead of being pressured.

- Later in the game, get abyssal blade if you have a melee hero. AM hates lockdown that goes through his precious BKB. Any hero that can also lockdown through BKB naturally such as Beastmaster or Pudge is also very good.

Now for the draft :

Heroes that I fear as AM include Spirit Breaker, Riki, Queen of Pain, Disruptor, Mirana because of Moonlight Shadow, Beastmaster, Bristle because he bullies AM out of lane, Doom, Elder Titan because he removes all my armor, Meepo, Tiny (craggy exterior + burst to kill AM), Phantom Assassin (AM hates blur with passion, it can force him to get MKB), Bane, Rubick (he steals the blink ! Really good on rubick), Ogre magi (bullies am out of lane), Bloodseeker (rupture damage can not be avoided as AM, as opposed to qop), Lion (hex + stun…), Lina (laguna blade with aghs hurts like hell).

Also, AM is very weak against early push. If you see an AM on the other team, you can get heroes like Leshrac, Death Prophet (even though she sucks a bit), Nature’s Prophet, or Lone Druid, and then focus on towers around 15 minutes or so. In particular, get heroes that are good at sieging (Lone Druid is the one that comes to my mind).

Or you can just pick something like Spectre and outcarry him.

4715,"Okay so I kind of fell in love with Spectre recently, and I think she is really strong at the moment. She is the PL of 6.85, it’s quite hard to lose games as Spectre when you play her properly.

Here are my games on Spectre : http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?date=&amp;hero=spectre&amp;skill_bracket=&amp;lobby_type=&amp;game_mode=&amp;region=&amp;faction=&amp;duration=&amp;enjoyment=any&amp;timezone=Europe%2FBerlin

So first, let’s talk about what was (I think) your biggest issue in your game : when to pick. You can pick spectre a lot of times in pubs because people are not coordinated enough to shut you down. I would, however, avoid picking her into gankers like Riki or even QoP. And of course, you don’t pick her if you have a carry already. Also, Spectre loves defensive supports : Dazzle, Winter Wyvern, Omni, Witch Doctor… Every one of these heroes is wonderful with Spectre. For the enemies, ideally you want them to have squishy supports like Lion.

- Skill build : my standard skill build has very little variation : I go for almost the same skill build every game. An example is there : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1890099550

As you can see, I max Desolate, going 1-4-1-1 at level 7, then I get stats and Haunt whenever I can. **Why stats ?** Because they give you more mana to get from camp to camp using Dagger, because your skills don’t scale very well (Dagger level up only increases damage by 50 per level and slow by 8%, dispersion level up gives 4% more reflection), they give you tankiness that really adds up (trust me on this one, you really feel the difference), they boost your illusions, and they increase your farming speed.

At level 20, I will start maxing Dispersion and then Dagger.

- Item build : There is also very little variation here. I play Spectre by focusing on farming every time I can. So my build is stout-quelling-sometimes PMS-boots-aquila-boots upgrade (can be treads or phase)-morbid mask and then I start going for radiance. For the boot choice, there is one question to answer : **do they have burst ?** If yes, go for Treads, if no, go for Phase. I think (didn’t run calculations yet) that Phase helps your farming more, even with desolate. But on the other hand treads give you +9 str, which gets « amplified » by dispersion. It’s very useful too. If you are getting rekt, items like Drums or Vanguard can be forced to be purchased.

After radiance, I always go for Manta, unless I need heart really badly. Manta is ownage on Spectre. It allows you to do 3 times your desolate damage (65×3 = 195 extra pure damage per series of attacks !). After manta, my usual choice is Skadi, but you can choose between a lot of items : AC, Butterfly, Heart…

You don’t want BKB in general.

- Playstyle : if you play spectre as I do, you are focused on farming. Farm your lane normally, and when you have aquila-upped boots-morbid-quelling go to the jungle and leave the lane to your supports. At that point you will start getting stats very soon, and you will see how big of a difference it does on your farming. When you are farming, always watch the minimap and alt-click your haunt when it’s ready to tell your allies that you are watching and you can join them.

In fights, usually you want to haunt in on the target you can kill the fastest. Either you are ganking and then you focus on the gank target, or you are fighting and in this case it’s often the supports. Other notable reality targets are Bloodseeker with bloodrage on himself, initiators like Magnus, or carries like Drow or Sniper who don’t want anyone near them. But for most cases, remember that **usually you reality on the backlines**.

Here are some tips for you :

- Dagger helps to farm when you are in the jungle. Use its ability to go through trees wisely. If someone teaches me to make gifs i can make gifs to show some nice dagger paths that make you cross 2 cliffs or treelines.

- Always attack the small creep first, because you have desolate.

- always be farming.

- Just because you have haunt, doesn’t make it an excuse for not carrying TPs. Just like on Nature’s prophet. Always carry TPs.

- WATCH YOUR MAP. I put this in caps because it’s the most important thing, especially on Spectre. Try to guess where enemies are.

- Sometimes, although very rarely, you can use ult if you suspect the enemies are smoked, just like Zeus ult. However, in general, keep it for team fights or pickoffs.

- Never go Daedalus, MKB, or any of this shit. You don’t need damage on Spectre, you need radiance and stats.",2015-10-25 00:40:09+00:00,cwbpcmk,1.0,t3_3q1g4i,32375.0,learndota2

- In this particular game, you were against a Riki, which is one of the best heroes against you. A good idea would have been to ask one of your supports (was veno your solo support ? Weird) to sit behind you with detection.

- Your skill build is bad, the Agressif skill build is much better in general (3 levels of stats between levels 8 and 10).

- It may have been a good game to go for BKB or MKB on PL. In general these items are garbage and you don’t want them, but against Riki they can be necessary.

4768,"I actually did a build comparison on Clinkz in the last days of 6.84, the calculations are no longer right because of the Helm changes and other 6.85 stuff but here it is anyway if you want to have a look : https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3m3lb5/desoaquila_vs_solar_cresthotd_on_clinkz_with/

I think your build on Clinkz is outdated, Orchid is pretty bad now honestly. I go for the following item build on Clinkz :

Aquila -&gt; boots -&gt; soul ring (I try to get soul ring when i get 6 so I can eat a creep, even a lane creep) -&gt; treads -&gt; deso -&gt; medallion -&gt; Diffu/Manta/BKB/MKB/Daedalus. I try to get BKB as late as I can because :

1) BKB is an item made for big fights in general, and Clinkz is a hero who doesn’t excel at them, 

2) it doesn’t help you farm or anything, which leads me to 

3) it’s actually very risky.

I will digress a bit on diffu because it’s extremely underrated on Clinkz at the moment. Clinkz uses diffusal blade better than Riki does. Strafe allows for a huge amount of mana burn, the intel is nice on one of the most mana hungry carries in the game, and the agi is very good because it gives both +damage and +AS which synergyze with your 3 steroids. Not to mention you can purge dust from you, and the 0s CD makes it even better.

I don’t get skadi usually, but it’s a good item. You can absolutely go for it if you don’t have deso anymore or if it’s not a good deso game (very rare, but for example when you have DK+ogre+sven+visage+DS on the enemy team)

As far as skill builds go, I believe there are only 2 builds viable, 1 of which you will go for 90% of the time. The 2 builds are :

23232421114133Stats4 and then stats (almost all the time)

21232423114133Stats4 (if there is a kill opportunity. Of course you can take Strafe at level 4 if you need).

I save up 1 skill point in the laning stage just in case, you might need to go for Strafe to get 1 kill. So I end up having a 0-3-1-1 skill build at 6 with 1 free skill point more often than not.

The reasons why these skill builds are pretty much the only ones that I would recommend are :

- Invis level 2 is your best value point, as it doubles the bonus movespeed and gives it a 100% uptime. The difference is noticeable comparing it to level 1 invis, trust me (or try it and see)

- Searing arrows are your bread and butter during the early game. If you suck at last hitting like me, they secure you EZ last hits. They allow for extremely cost-efficient harass. They allow you to **pressure the tower if the enemy offlaner leaves** (I just highlight it because not enough clinkz players do this and you can actually pressure so hard. I got a pre-10 minute tower in like 2/3 of my last games).

- Of course you need ult whenever you can. I always regret it when I don’t take ult whenever I can.

For your item suggestions :

- Mjollnir is absolutely unneeded, especially for your reason. Pushing power comes with Deso. If you look at my games i have &gt;9k tower damage in all of my 4 or 5 last games. You never need Mjollnir to push. If you want AS, it’s in general better to go for Diffu/Butterfly, or AC.

- MKB is actually very good on Clinkz if there is evasion on the enemy team. He is not PL, MKB is efficient on him. Again, if there is evasion, otherwise Daedalus is more efficient (unless you need mini bashes for some reason).

And a few tips on Clinkz from my games :

- SAVE. YOUR. MANA. Really. Clinkz is one of the most mana hungry heroes in the game. There is a reason why you keep soul ring for a very long time. To have the most efficiency with your mana when using ult, the most efficient rotation of items is to do switch treads to str &gt; soul ring &gt; switch treads to int &gt; ult &gt; switch back treads to whatever you want. If you are lazy you can use soul ring while on agi, it’s not a very big deal because you get half a regen every 40 seconds or so

- Pressure towers early on when the enemy offlaner leaves. Get last hits, go eat a creep, then rape your W key to hit the tower without triggering its aggro.

- Farm agressively, it both makes you closer to ganks and pushes (so it makes you more efficient) and enables your team to farm safely (so it makes them more efficient).

4770,"Aside from the obvious things that /u/omofakler pointed out, there is one other thing that’s extremely important : picking better comes with understanding the game better. It’s probably not relevant until at least 4k, but having better lanes than the opponents or understanding that you will peak earlier than them is a key part of knowing how to draft. Again, it’s probably not extremely relevant, but at least try to get better lanes or better late game to start off.

[This AM game](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1862578958) for example was extremely close to being a disaster, just because our captain drafted lanes that were really shitty vs an ogre-undy combo. We won because the enemy team was believing they were playing CoD and was refusing to farm (their inflated CS comes from when they had megas in their base and we could not push). It’s an extremely common problem at 2k and before (i'm 2.2k atm, rising)

Let’s analyze the last captain’s mode game I could find of your profile, I don’t know if you were drafting but anyway here it is. (take this with a grain of salt, I’m not rOtK) : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1848559776

- First picks Techies and Meepo. What the actual hell ? I assume you were trying to pick brood, but even then there is no reason to ban these heroes first. I would probably have banned Ogre, Undy, Lesh, BS, these kind of heroes.

- Enemy team bans SF and Slardar. Who the heck bans slardar first ? Just judging from this, they probably wanted invis heroes. So I would have kept those bans on the back of my head : Clinkz, Riki, maybe Invoker.

- First pick Lich. I would not have done it, but why not. That means automatically that they will have dual lanes, there is just no point running Lich in a trilane. So you can expect a 2-1-2 with almost 100% certainty unless they pick Tiny-Wisp or a dual mid combo like that. That means you have to pick a draft that goes well against it. Either take an offlane that’s extremely dominant (like Ogre+Undy, Ogre+Viper, Undy+Sniper…) and try to whack the enemy carry, OR trilane to shut them down completely and take an offlaner that can get a lot against a dual lane like Dark Seer. Even bristle works in this situation because he can get some farm.

- You pick alch-lion first. It is… okay, but I feel like there were a lot of heroes that would have revealed less about your draft, like Lina, Shaker, Undying… Or there are heroes that are so strong you can pick them first and it doesn’t matter, like Ogre.

- Enemy team second picks axe, which means it’s probably their dual offlane with Lich. You now know that you need a ranged hero in lane and a support that can deal with Axe+Lich, in particular a safe lane support that can stop creep cutting like Dazzle (even if dazzle is not ideal vs axe).

- I just don’t understand the next 4 bans. AA doesn’t fit their draft at all, they want strong lanes and AA is weak in lane. Also, they probably want a great laning carry, but why ban Jugg and not Gyro, Bristle or something like this ? Especially seeing your next picks, I just don’t get these bans. No comment on enemy bans, they probably randomed and thought it would be funny.

- You pick morphling next. It’s not a good pick. Your draft is focused on mid-game with Lion and Alch, which is very good and favored by the meta overall. Morphling is either an extremely strong late game hero (carry morph) or a hero who peaks only once in the game, once he gets 7 (support/offlane morph). In this case, I would have gone for something like QoP (slightly risky but works), bristle, Clinkz… Maybe, just maybe, Slark could also be not shit in this draft. Also, I would keep PL on the back of my head, the hero is a lot weaker now but he can still wreck face. I think overall, your morph pick is bad

- Ember spirit pick for them. Forget about PL then. It’s pretty strange, and I don’t know who wins on an Alch vs Ember matchup (the morph-ember matchup is certainly lost by morph though). But it’s okay.

- Shaker is decent.

- Magnus pick for them, which screams safe lane ember. That’s an extremely bad decision for them. Sure, they are stacking stuns, but they are unnecessarily making a lane that was gonna lose win for you. They outpicked themselves here.

- AM ban… what ? They have 3 cores…

- Enigma ban, so they expected an offlane shaker.

- I don’t like WR here at all. While the hero in general is very very good in this patch, I don’t think WR has a place outside of mid, much like SF or DK. Well, she *can* go in a side lane, but that’s a bit of a waste. In this case, Dark Seer is an absolute beastly pick IMHO. He can bully Ember out of lane very easily. You can also try to go for a support naga and get an offlane shaker, just to stop their wombo combo in team fights, but it’s not that good imho.

- The last pick Lina is decent.

4782,"&gt; I could try AM but later in the game that Tiny will have **Arcanes** and stats from Aghs anyway, so no real counter beyond early game there.

Arcanes on Tiny lol

Basically, Tiny as a carry has the following strengths and weaknesses :

- Strength hero with high STR gain (decent raw HP)

- Great base damage with ult

- Decent intelligence

- **horrible** agility (I think he has the second worst agi gain in the game after Undying)

- On top of that, he has 0 base armor and his ult removes attack speed so he is really starved of these 2

- Melee hero

- Great base damage, awful attack animation

- Great mid-game burst

- Excellent pusher once he gets a couple of items

- Extremely scary during the late game because if he wins 1 fight your base is dead

- Farms quite fast even before aghs because of Toss

- He is actually not that good at manfighting compared to heroes like Troll or Ursa, if he doesn’t have his avatoss up (I had games when I could not manfight Troll as Tiny despite being really far ahead)

So in order to fight against Tiny, there are a few things that work wonderfully :

- armor reduction (except Natural Order !)

- Glimmer cape if you are quick (to save allies)

- Slows

- Disables, in particular things like Naga’s net work really well

- Ranged heroes who laugh at craggy

- Manfighters, preferably heroes who buy BKB

- His burst is actually not instant, so BKB can dodge it.

So I would go for heroes like Viper, Shadow Demon, Lich, Veno, Ursa, Troll, TA, Dazzle. Anti-Mage is not the best counter because Tiny doesn’t care that much about his mana in fights after he used his combo compared to what a viper provides for example. PL is decent but not amazing against Tiny (playable for sure, but not the best matchup).

I recommend you to play Tiny and see for yourself his weaknesses too, this hero is very fun.",2015-10-05 09:52:35+00:00,cvorjct,1.0,t3_3nhsx3,46322.0,learndota2

4799,"I like your itembuild but not your skillbuild, from my experience going 1-4-1-1 and then taking ult level 2 when you have radiance seems much stronger.

My usual item build on Spectre is Phase-QB-aquila-casual morbid OR MoM-radiance-manta-skadi-heart. Usually I get radiance between 20 and 25 minutes with this. The beauty of this build is that it’s very consistent : with a lot of stat points, you can basically go to the jungle as soon as you have morbid and keep farming even in the toughest of lanes. I don’t build diffusal too much because I try to be very efficient with farming though, so it’s always radiance as a first big item to me.

I’m not sure about Treads vs Phase though. Treads looks slightly better than phase now because it should give the same DPS thanks to desolate and more tankyness. I will make calculations on that in the future, if I get time for it.

I play PL like a Slark, and abuse his mobility instead of AFK right clicking and waiting for cancers to spawn.

You are right in the fact that PL purges off medusa’s ult like it’s nothing, and it’s the reason why against Dusa, you half commit as PL until she ults, then you doppel away, wait for the ult to end (so that your team can follow), and reengage. Without the ult, dusa is much less of a threat. Keeping on rightclicking with her ult on after purging it is actually a bad idea most of the time because it will leave you isolated.

4811,"The last hits will come naturally after 10 minutes or so if you have in your head the core principles of farming. Here are the rules I set to myself when I play carries :

- Mana transfers into gold, because spell usage transfers into gold. On heroes like Slark, you want to spam Dark Pact on every single cooldown. On AM, you want to blink every single time you can. There is a thing that originates from it : mana efficiency. The more creeps you last hit thanks to your mana usage, the more efficient you are. The less mana you use, the more efficient it gets (tread switching, etc).

- Health sometimes transfers into gold. It’s a bit trickier to understand, but sometimes tanking creeps and losing HP can be a farm accelerator. The most obvious example is Huskar, where you want to be as low as possible to get as many last hits as possible. Another example is Slark, with Dark Pact and efficient usage of enemy vision you keep your HP up so you’re safe but you also spam dark pact.

- Never fuck around. As a carry, your golden rule is **pounce on free kills, push when you can, fight when you have to, farm the rest of the time**.

- Try to take the agressive farm when you play Slark, AM or other escaping carries. 1 single jungle is around 600 gold IIRC, so that’s 600 gold for you and 600 gold not gained by the enemy team.

- You really should be aiming at fewer deaths, not more kills. As a carry, EVERY. SINGLE. DEATH. HURTS. Going 10/1 is a lot better than going 30/7.

Also, 500 last hits is not very hard to obtain on carries that can at least flash farm a bit.

So first, Treads are pretty bad in comparison to phase on NS. Phase allows you to not get kited (well, you don’t really have many issues with it, but it solves them altogether), and they synergize very well with the AS buff from Hunter in the Night. It gives him a lot more DPS and also a lot more efficiency during his ganks (how many times did you see an enemy running with 10 HP and you could not catch up ? Phase solves this)

Urn is completely overshadowed by Bottle overall. You don’t need urn to keep yourself going, it’s a waste of a slot overall and you would much rather go for a quick bottle and life steal items (vlad’s, helm) a bit later on. Your supports should get urn, not you.

Armlet is decent on him, although I don’t really get it. It’s a nice item though.

I don’t like Agh’s on core NS at all. The further you go behind as a NS in terms of farm distribution, the better it gets (it’s a lot better on a 4/5 NS than on a 2). Since I play mostly NS as a 2 position (starting from mid or offlane), Agh’s is not the way to go at all. The problem with agh’s on a core NS is that it’s, as the #4 NS on dotabuff says, a good way to lose. It’s an item that costs you 4k gold and removes you the ability to solo kill anyone, doesn’t let you farm at all, doesn’t help your snowball. And you don’t become the « tankiest and fastest » hero with agh’s, you just become a hero that can’t farm and can not get kills at all, let alone by himself. If you want to scale into the late game, instead of going for Agh’s, there are many more items that you can get such as helm/vlad’s, SnY, bottle, AC…",2015-09-29 00:28:10+00:00,cvhj5x6,4.0,t1_cvgqyx4,49549.0,learndota2

- Windranger : she has been cancerous for a loooong while now, and now she was buffed again. Another hero that will be a top-tier mid this patch.

- TA was not nerfed, while other dominant mids got nerfed except SF. And TA tends to wreck SF in lane.

4856,"&gt; Wp to you though, you have quite the record with Slark in the same bracket as me. :) So it's not just the hero, I need to look into my Slark playstyle as well.

Thanks. Slark is actually pretty good for pubstomping in low tier games for some reason, but I still claim that the hero is shit because you can not really pick him often, so many things counter him.

&gt; Also aren't LC and ES good against PL?

PL is my second most played hero, and I would pick him into LC and ES on the enemy team. They are decent, especially LC because she really shits on him in lane, but later on they are pretty bad against PL. You will never really have more than 4 PL illusions by your side if you have half a brain and you play PL against LC+shaker.

&gt; I usually do always go Treads-Aquila and then decide whether I can get pickoffs (Shadow Blade) or I it won't play off and instead build drums. Thanks, for the BSJ guide reference, I did watch it too, and I have been following his reasoning.

Well, I also follow his reasoning, but for some reason people tend to 5 man way too much in our bracket, so for me the tanky option is a lot safer. Not to mention you farm quickly with it.

&gt; Regarding farming, I do tread swap and farm our jungle once I can. I just meant I am not perfect at last hitting in lane. Thing is even after farming jungle, he's such a slow pusher. I hit towers like a wet noodle without agi stacks, clear a creep wave, take a couple of tower hits and back off. Farming the enemy jungle seems a nice idea to do since I can get away with it. Thanks for that. 

One thing that helps you to push faster is always have aquila on, and also go tank creepwaves past towers, as you did. But you are right, he is slow as hell.

&gt; And to think we lost to a PL who built MoM

You know what the ultimate humiliation is ? Losing to a SnY omni. It happened to me once or twice.

&gt; Regarding farming, I do tread swap and farm our jungle once I can. I just meant I am not perfect at last hitting in lane. 

Slark’s laning tends to be garbage though, I also tend to have quite bad last hits. Especially since at low level games no one wants to trilane and for some reason people pick « supports » with no lane presence against an ursa dual lane or something like that. But you can recover in the jungle as soon as you get level 7.

&gt; Also last game, we had a LC who didn't win a single duel till just before the game ended.

Shit happens… I tend to get really bad LCs in my games too (and even laning LCs tend to be really bad).",2015-09-25 21:07:20+00:00,cve6g3x,3.0,t1_cve6614,986.0,learndota2

4858,"TL;DR : Slark was shit in 6.84, and he still probably is.

Here is my record with Slark : http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?date=&amp;hero=slark&amp;skill_bracket=&amp;lobby_type=&amp;game_mode=&amp;region=&amp;faction=&amp;duration=&amp;enjoyment=any&amp;timezone=Europe%2FBerlin

So I will analyze your stats on the last game, I can’t watch replays at the moment.

First of all : Slark is a very bad pick here. Bloodseeker, PL, and to a lesser extent shit on you. Bloodseeker can negate your ulti as soon as you get below 25% HP, unless you are actually ulting. You are not really that good vs OD either. The only hero you are good against is Winter Wyvern.

Another point : your team is actually pretty bad at dealing with a PL. Earthshaker and Legion are actually bad, PL is horrible to play against as Slark, Abaddon is bad, Invoker is bad. So overall, you were outdrafted. Heavily. Also, 4 melees.

Your skill build is good, I also do the same every game. But in my opinion, you are really doing it wrong with your item build. Especially in this situation since they had heroes who could manfight you very well even 1v1, or can protect themselves very well, and also can nuke you down. If you want to go for a Slark pick in this game, your item build should be **Treads - Aquila - Wand - Drums - SnY** and then BKB/Butterfly/Moon Shard/anything that gives you stats. You can go for a silver edge and a manta by disassembling your SnY in the later game, but **not early on**. The reason for that is : Slark is a melee hero, he is ultra squishy, and easy as hell to nuke down. You need HP desperately. 

You also need to farm agressively as Slark. You need to take down the enemy jungle after you got level 7 and treads+drums+aquila+wand, every time you can. You say that you don’t farm really well, and it’s true to an extent, Slark has pretty shitty farming early on. However, once you get your first **HP items** (not a fucking shadow blade…), you regen faster because your ult regens you for a percentage of your max HP. So it actually makes you farm faster. In order to farm quickly as Slark, you really only need to treadswitch and spam dark pact. Farming the enemy jungle also deprives the enemies of their farm and gives you really easy ganks. If in trouble, either pounce into trees and TP or ult-tp (if they don’t have shaker, lina, lion…)

In the mid game, you need to take advantage of the pressure you created, and you don’t really want to go late game as Slark because you really fall off, you are waaay too squishy in the late game. 

I hope this helped. Also, I recommend you to look for « BananaSlamJamma slark guide unedited » on youtube, this guy made a 3h43 video on slark explaining pretty much everything there is to know about him in 6.84. But he was pretty shit in 6.84, let’s hope he will be better in 6.85.

- Diffusal blade is seen as an item that no one except PL and Riki should buy in low level games (Jugg players don’t buy one, Windranger players don’t buy one…)

- Everyone hates BKB in low level games

- It’s very easy to underestimate an Omni. He makes you misjudge situations a lot on the enemy team because of his heal, especially now because purification has a shorter animations.

- When people are allergic to diffusal, omni is actually very strong in the late game. Aghs+Refresher has the potential of giving **20s physical immunity** to your whole team, and no one knows how to counter it.

That being said, he has a very weak laning phase, so if you want to pick him, try to get your allies to pick a carry that holds BKB well and can’t really be outlaned (so you can leave him alone in lane, while they still get farm). Examples of such carries are LD, PA, Clinkz, etc. Counter examples include AM.

Also, it should be obvious but I still see people do it. So my most important advice : **never go for a carry omni build**.",2015-09-25 14:28:51+00:00,cvdrepx,1.0,t3_3mbr86,8734.0,learndota2

It still costs 130 mana for each use, and it’s very inefficient mana-wise in general. I still think maxing glimpse first is the way to go.",2015-09-25 13:47:47+00:00,cvdq1a7,2.0,t1_cvdlg6r,12892.0,learndota2
4874,"&gt; Skill build i used was max thunder strike first, going **3-1-1-1 at lvl 6**. The possibility is there to get a combo off in a 1v1 mid situation so i skilled W and E for the kill potential at lvl 6. After that I maxed glimpse then static field. I feel like glimpse and static can be versatile as to which you max first, **glimpse has a good value point at lvl 2**, and static field allows to get a good duration ult off. I think itll depend on whether youre doing more solo pickoffs or more teamfight lockdown situations. 

*throws up*

Please…

There is a reason why every *good* disruptor player maxes glimpse first. Glimpse is by far your best spell to max out by level 7, even now. For the same reasons as to why you never max curse on Silencer : maxing curse allows you to slowly harass your opponents in certain situations, maxing glaives+last word allows you to kill them. Without at least 3 points in Glimpse, people can just run away from you.

The biggest value point you can get on disruptor is level 1 thunder strike. It gives vision for a very long time, as well as doing quite a bit of damage at level 1. However, the damage does not scale well and the ability still costs a whopping 130 mana. You can not spam it, and it’s not even close to being as mana efficient as spells like Dragon Slave or Breathe Fire.",2015-09-25 13:45:39+00:00,cvdpyus,1.0,t3_3mbbgv,18421.0,learndota2

4886,"Tiny is definitely my best hero out of these 3, even though I don’t play him that much : http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?date=&amp;hero=tiny&amp;skill_bracket=&amp;lobby_type=&amp;game_mode=&amp;region=&amp;faction=&amp;duration=&amp;enjoyment=any&amp;timezone=Europe%2FBerlin

Starting items : Stout shield is mandatory, you don’t have any base armor. If you go mid, you can rush a bottle and go for Stout-Tango. If you go safe lane (which I like the most), you almost always have to go Tango-Salve-Stout and then you can take 1 branch or 2 but it’s not mandatory. Not taking any branch allows you to get a quelling blade with just a bounty rune.

First of all, there is only 1 thing that varies in the skill build : the level at which you put 1 point in Craggy. Craggy is actually a great value point if you are being harassed heavily and don’t have a wisp (which happens VERY often), it gives you +3 armor for just 1 skill point and going from 0 to 3 armor gives you a huge boost in EHP.

Skill build at level 6 without Craggy : 2-3-0-1

With craggy : 1-3-1-1

Whatever your choice is, always max Toss by level 7, it’s your most efficient spell. Always take ult at level 11 and 16, and max avalanche second, craggy last. Take stats at levels 15 and 17-25.

Items : first items are Treads, Bottle, and Quelling blade, in the order you want. If you are harassed, go for a bottle so you can spam toss for some damage in return. You can also get a casual ring of protection (again, you lack armor !) if you want, or even a basi. **Don’t go for drums !** I used to go for it and it’s actually pretty bad. It slows down your aghs and doesn’t really offer you anything : no farming speed, no openings for pickoffs… Pretty bad item for its cost. If the enemy team has squishy heroes that you can burst down, like in [this game](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1761399267), go for a blink next. Blink is pretty incredible on this hero, you can farm faster with it, it gives you options to get pickoffs once you get to level 10-11, and if you play it right you should have it at that time. If the enemy heroes don’t really care about your combo or you would rather toss an ally into the enemy team (like if you have an Axe/Shaker on your team), then consider not going for Blink and rushing aghs.

Also, swap your treads between agility and intelligence, not strength and intelligence ! Tiny is the only strength hero on which I will favor agi treads when I pick up Treads. You don’t need the +9 damage from str treads, however agi treads give you armor and agi, which you need a lot more. So get used to treadswapping like an agi hero, int before casting spells, agi otherwise. In fights, don’t worry about treadswitching, it can mess you up.

**The next item after Agh’s is really open**. I usually go for one of these items : Manta, Butterfly, AC, Moon Shard, BKB, Daedalus, MKB. You can also get Satanic in the late game. Small tips though : in general, going for BKB first after aghs is extremely risky because it relies on you winning teamfights and Tiny is not the best teamfighter. It’s not a farming item, it gives you nothing besides the active. Also, as I said before, you don’t need a lot of damage on Tiny, you need attack speed and armor, which is why I go for AC and Butterfly so much.

**Gameplay** : Before aghs, you use Toss to farm. Go to a camp, position yourself close to the big creep, treadswitch to int, toss, and then back to agi while you finish off the camp. If you do a stack, it’s worth it to use avatoss, otherwise not. Keep in mind that Toss damages towers, so use it to push. Because of the fact that Toss damages towers, you can kill towers pretty quickly even without agh’s. Join your team occasionnally for pickoffs. When you fight in this state, you just want to blink in and avatoss a target, then go back, and get ready to reinitiate once all your spells are up again.

After aghs, you farm faster, you push faster, your burst is better… You become another hero. Focus on split pushing. You can save your mana a lot more at this stage of the game because Toss is no longer your only farming mechanism, you also have Cleave. You should also decide which item to go for next. The ideal item I would go for is AC if I had an ideal game, but you may want things like MKB or BKB. However, in 90% of your games AC is still a better choice to get, just because you push that much faster with it. At this stage of the game, you should fight a bit more with your team. Your combo is still a very good way to blow up supports or squishy cores, focus them first !

Don’t forget that Tiny is one of the fastest pushers in the game. He can both clear waves extremely quickly and push towers like there is no tomorrow. So get towers after each fight.",2015-09-24 19:58:23+00:00,cvcxwir,1.0,t3_3m7cuz,19013.0,learndota2

So it’s much more efficient for farming, and even for pickoffs, if you happen to get a kill at level 6, the damage difference is not big enough to justify it :

with a 3-2-0-1 skill build, you do 260×2 + 150×1.2×1.35 = 520 + 243 = 783 damage total if you toss the enemy hero.

With a 2-3-0-1 skill build, you do 180×2 + 225×1.2×1.35 = 360 + 364.5 = 724.5 damage in total if you toss the right target.

Stream name : Pareÿounet

Dotabuff of the game : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1810185779 (enigma)

MMR range : 2k

Specifics : Captain’s mode game, I was drafting. The WD in our game said that he wanted to go mid. I thought he was trolling, so I drafted this team, and he took mid from Ember. I had a slightly inefficient jungle, getting level 6 around 5:30 instead of 4:30, and mek around 9-10 minutes. In the mid game, I didn’t push as much as I would have liked to, and got subpar black holes, and their PL played really well. We almost came back, but it didn’t happen in the end. Here are my questions :

- How was the draft ?

- How can I be more efficient with jungling enigma on Radiant ? I remember that I blocked 1 or 2 camps early on.

- How was my behavior in fights ? I feel like I missed opportunities to black hole or to get mek off on multiple allies at times.

- My itemization was pretty standard, but maybe the order of items was wrong (in particular, I probably went for BoTs too early)

Thanks a lot for your analysis.

4962,"Hi !

So, first of all : don’t buy Treads on PL. It’s actually better in my opinion to go for Boots of Travel, unless you are awfully far behind very early. Otherwise your item builds are correct for me.

Second point : your tower damage is low, especially in the second game. With PL, you should have around 3k-5k tower damage at the bare minimum depending on how much your team can push. Vlad’s is a great asset to split push, and BoTs allow you to join fights.

Third : don’t pick PL into Storm. Storm is your second hardest counter in the game after Ember spirit.

Now, for your question about your behavior in fights : 

- I fight like a Slark with a ranged nuke when I play PL. That means spam spirit lance, and when I see an opportunity, rush in, then either get a kill or a lot of damage+mana burn, then doppel away as soon as it gets dangerous. If you are vs Ember or Earthshaker, try to stay as far away from your team as you can. Also, try to dodge spells whenever you can when you escape. The spells I would look out for the most are (for your first game) Omnislash and Snowball or Storm’s initiation, or Call Down/Lesh’s spells.

- In general, you want to focus either the hero who is the most mana dependant or your biggest counter hero-matchup wise and spam him with Spirit Lance. So in your first game, I would have focused on Storm Spirit only. In your second game I would probably have lanced Earthshaker repeatidly (is that how it’s written ?) to keep his mana low and his blink on cooldown. If you are forced to be matched as PL vs Storm, I would say get your team to initiate on him (pop his linken’s with spirit lance, have pudge blink-ulting him for example) and then rush on him, use either abyssal or hex and kill him. Then retreat, and go back in when you see an opportunity.

Overall, I think you need to focus more on the towers, and practice a bit more on PL. You can fight earlier than 30 minutes and you can even fight before diffusal, it’s just slightly harder. And also, don’t pick him vs Storm.",2015-09-19 13:02:50+00:00,cv6vhgb,1.0,t3_3ljw21,1045.0,learndota2

4988,"Hello boy. PL is my second most played hero (and one of my best, with around 70% winrate over 65 games) : http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?date=&amp;hero=phantom-lancer&amp;skill_bracket=&amp;lobby_type=&amp;game_mode=&amp;region=&amp;faction=&amp;duration=&amp;enjoyment=any&amp;timezone=Europe%2FBerlin

I think PL is a hero that’s misunderstood by many players. My playstyle as PL is very simple. I farm and rat, and with BoTs I can join any fight. In fights, I behave like a Slark with a nuke : I stay back and spam doppelgänger, rush on an enemy out of position, doppel away, reset, and then go back in, etc.

PL has the following characteristics as a carry :

- Very high base stats

- Good stat growth

- Very low base movespeed, but still very mobile thanks to doppelgänger and phantom rush

- Reliant on his spells, especially Doppelgänger, and thus **vulnerable to silences** especially before Manta

- Squishy

- Farm-dependant

- Does not play very well from behind (you can come back, but you are not lycan, it’s pretty hard)

- Peaks around 40-50ish minutes when he has something like BoTs-Skadi-Manta-Diffu-Vlads. After that, he falls off. PL actually gets outcarried in the late game (example here : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1686703875)

- Actually pretty reliant on mana to keep his farm up, you want to spam BoTs and Doppelgänger to increase efficiency (same story as with Slark)

Here are his weaknesses in terms of playstyle (in my opinion) :

- Mana burn is annoying because it will force you to go back to base when you shouldn’t have to

- AoE is a slight annoyance, but it’s frankly not a big deal. I pick PL into earth shaker and lina nowadays.

- PL struggles against heroes that can manfight him and are mobile (PA…)

- Don’t pick anything that’s projectile based or delayed against PL, or get ready to get MLG doppeled.

- Silences are *very* annoying.

Here are the heroes I would avoid, from most annoying to least annoying :

- **God tier : Storm and Ember**. I never pick PL against one of these 2 guys. They are a nightmare to deal with. They have a combination of everything that’s great against you : mobility, ways to clear your illus quickly, wreck you late game. Ember is slightly less annoying early on but he is one of your best counters late game.

- **A tier : Riki, disruptor, Phantom Assassin, Anti-Mage**. Disruptor and Riki have 2 things in common : they can initiate on you and you can’t use doppel to escape (riki pops out of invis and then silences you, disruptor thunder strikes and then you can’t doppel because he will glimpse you right back into his ult afterwards, you have to wait until glimpse to use doppel). Phantom Assassin has mobility and a lot of physical damage (and PL is squishy, who would have known), and also you have to ignore PA and let your team focus her or get an MKB, both of which are pretty suboptimal. PA is the only hero you *have* to get a MKB against if your team is not cooperative, otherwise I would never do it if I can avoid it. MKB doesn’t offer you a lot as PL. AM is as mobile as you with Blink, farms faster than you, plays very well against split pushers because he pushes everything out, and mana burns which is super annoying. Oh, and also he is a natural butterfly carrier, so you might have to go for MKB in the late game too. And you can not kill him by yourself unless you have Hex or Ablade.

- **B tier : Axe, Skywrath Mage, Lina, QoP** : These are good against you for different reasons.  Skywrath mage can easily silence and kill you pre-manta if he ganks with someone who has an instant stun like Axe. Lina can just kill you and recognize your illus, so does QoP (QoP is more mobile but more squishy, watch out for her a bit more). Axe is pretty shit against you past the laning stage, but he is super annoying in lane, and Axe+Sky is also a great combo vs you.

- **C tier : Silencer, Earthshaker, Sven, Tiny, Magnus** : All of these heroes except Sven have 2 common traits : their ult shits on you and they are predictable as fuck in fights (Silencer is less predictable but less annoying later on). However, it’s an ult ! Shaker can’t do anything to you after echo slam is used. Tiny will whack you really quickly if he goes near you, but it’s a tiny, so if you spam spirit lance on him he should never be able to do so. Same story for Sven. For magnus, you have to watch for RP and possibly his carry who has been empowered. Silencer is the most annoying in this list for me because he can silence you from across the map when you are ganked. 

And for other counters that people mentioned in this thread :

- LC shits on PL in lane very, very hard, but in the mid game she is not the worst hero to play against. PL is pickable against LC for sure, if you are decent with PL.

- The balanced radioactive pony is also a great counter. I didn’t put him in this list because he kinda shits on everyone else too

- Shadow demon is pretty good in the late game, so is Dark Seer. Dark Seer is harder to play around because he will usually get blink so it’s harder to not get caught in the wall. If you have these heroes against you, try to stay far from your team (vs Dark Seer) or far from Shadow Demon if you are against him. Also, keep in mind that a disruption against you is a disruption lost on his ally.

- Luna gets utterly rekt by PL. She can not manfight PL at all because she is even squishier, and Moon Glaives doesn’t kill illusions fast enough.

- Gyro is rekt by PL too. PL doesn’t care about Rocket Barrage because his illusions tank most of it, doesn’t care about Call Down because he can doppel away from it or dispel it, and doesn’t care about flak cannon because he can disengage from it.

- Veil is decent vs PL, but if you have to resort to this item to beat PL your draft sucks

- Crimson guard is OK, it forces PL to waste diffusal charges just to dispel the active.

- Mjollnir is pretty decent, but you can just change targets with Phantom Rush.

Frankly, PL is not a very big deal in my opinion. He is not the cancer people make him to be. However, he is very strong against lack of coordination and vs team that lack disables, which for some reason are very common in pubs.

Also, he shits on Bloodseeker.

4998,"&gt; I've seen Purge once talk about this on stream or something when a viewer asked him about it and he sorta said something like Non-english speakers on predominantly English speaking servers that you get matched with are probably better than you at certain aspects at the game and they make up for the mmr they lost based off of lack of communication on other skills such as mechanics, item and skill builds, etc. 

Aui said that in one of his old Aui’s 2 cents. And from my EUW experience, russian players are not that bad because even if they don’t speak english, they actually play decently on average. And they fight for motherland until the end. It’s frustrating when you can’t tell your PL to not go radiance, but on average it matches out.

&gt; I'd say if you are playing pubs or ranked games and you get matched with someone who doesn't speak english don't get too upset about it I don't think that many games are won only based off communication focus on playing the best you can and try your best to win, that's all you can do.

5001,"Hi, carry and support player here.

So first and foremost, when you pick a support, you want to check a few things :

- Does my team need a babysitter, or can I be a bit more of a jungling support ? If they pick undy against you with AM on your team, you don’t want to pick a CM. CM is not a good babysitter. In this case, Witch doctor is really good on the other hand : really strong at zoning, and voodoo restoration negates tombstone damage.

- Can I be greedy ? Will I solo support ? Or is the other support supposed to get more farm ?

- Does any support look like the perfect pick here ? (example : you have LC or clock on your team, naga or brew on the enemy team, Skywrath Mage is an obvious pick)

If you want to trilane, also add these questions :

- Who gets courier and obs first, who gets sentries ?

- Who pulls and who zones ?

For these 2 questions, you have to communicate.

Then here is the game plan in general :

- If you can zone the enemy offlane and you have a good zoner/a hero that doesn’t jungle, in 90% of the cases it’s the right thing to do. Sometimes however, you can gank mid, especially if you have someone like CM (because CM is always in the fog, so you can get really easy ganks with her)

- Evaluate the lane matchup, and whether or not you can zone. If they have a double melee and you have a ranged support, they are done for. If they have an offlaner that’s weak in lane, he is also done for. If they have a strong dual lane and you think you will not be able to fight against these heroes, 3 options are given to you : either bring more people, stay behind your carry if you have a defensive support that can help him in anyway (Omni, dazzle, etc are good examples), and in any other case, **leave the lane**. Stack camps, pull, do something useful, but don’t sap your carry’s XP. He needs it.

- When you zone, you should stand on the side of the lane and not behind your creeps. Please, DO NOT harass from behind the creepwave. Few things are more frustrating as a carry than seeing your support completely screw the creep equilibrium and make you miss CS because he made the low HP enemy creep run to him. Do not do that, it’s awful.

- And probably the most important point, which is IMHO the biggest bunch of mistakes that new players do on supports : **Don’t stay in lane behind your carry, just denying ! It’s the worst thing you can do.** It should be obvious, but I still see it from time to time. Why is this a bad thing ? Because 1) It’s your carry’s job to last hit and deny in order to control the equilibrium, touching creeps really messes his timings and the equilibrium up and that’s very frustrating for him (trust me, I play carries a lot too and I know this feel) 2) Every auto attack you land on a creep is an auto attack lost on an enemy hero and 3) if you do that, you stay in the enemies’ vision. Now at low levels it’s less important, but trust me on this : *fog of war is your friend as a support*. Learn to use it. Don’t show if you are not zoning.

- Make yourself a plan for the teamfights in the midgame. For example, if you have disruptor, assess which targets are the best for your ult. If you have silencer, you can decide to ult just after the enemy void used timewalk to initiate until void gets BKB. If you have Skywrath Mage, you can say that you will silence their naga every fight when you think it would be a good time to song. It’s hero specific, but you get the idea.

And for your other questions :

- In the mid game, especially if they have support killers like SB, don’t be greedy. Take the safe farm, let your QoP/Slark/AM take the agressive farm. If they farm safely, stay behind them in fog, getting a CS every now and then from a wave that’s pushed in far.

- In fights, don’t be greedy either. You are not supposed to win the fights by yourself. Throw in your most important spell if that means you won’t die, then back off. Count your cooldowns, a support without his spells is almost completely helpless. In case of heroes with channeling spells like Enigma, WD and CM, wait until the majority of spells are down and then use your channeled spells.

- In pushes, unless you are a good pusher, don’t auto attack the tower with your team, stay behind them.

- It sounds dumb, but… die less. Dying less directly translates into more wins. Even as a support, you can really lower your deaths because most of the time support deaths are due to dumb mistakes.

Seriously. I can not count how many times I had a pudge on my team that was dumb enough to take mid and then wondered why we lost during the late game. Also, keep in mind that Pudge really lacks armor (and for some reason no one builds shiva’s or eblade on him), and pudge relies on the element of surprise as well as snowballing. 3 billion health is reached only when a pudge snowballed hard, which happens in about 1/30 of my games when there is a pudge.",2015-09-16 09:47:27+00:00,cv3bq2d,1.0,t3_3l5haq,925.0,learndota2

5012,"These heroes you talk about are the traditional rats. Every hero can rat very well with BoTs + a pushing item (necro 3, deso, etc). But some heroes, apart from the ones you listed, work a lot better IMHO :

- Clinkz : +80 physical damage with deso’s armor reduction, aquila to help you push, Strafe for moar tower damage, and ult for even more damage. Clinkz is one of the fastest pushers in the game once he gets deso.

- Lycan : Wolves need no armor, as you talked about

- Terrorblade : Very hard to play atm because the meta really doesn’t favor him. However if you want to play him (and he is fun to play), your build is something like 2 wraith bands (one of which you turn into RoA), boots, quelling blade, yasha, and then Boots of Travel.

- Phantom Lancer : My favorite build and playstyle on Phantom Lancer is the RoA+Vlad’s+BoTs build and I split push a lot, but still join fights often because BoTs are wonderful. Here is a match example : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1793638303

- Anti-Mage : Melts creepwaves, naturally split pushes because he farms the whole map, builds vlad’s naturally.

- Windranger : Focus fire, and windrun to escape or tank towers.

- Tiny : Yes, Tiny ! With an Io, it’s even more fun. The great thing about Tiny is that he can do pretty good tower damage even without agh’s because Toss damages towers. So you can farm with Toss, use your bottle and get runes every time you can, then throw creeps at towers until you get agh’s.

Also, going for items that give you HP such as Drums helps you farm faster because it will give you more raw HP regen per second, so you will have to wait a bit less between camps to regen with Shadow dance.

My build on Slark is Treads/Aquila/QB/Wand and then Drums -&gt; SnY -&gt; any combination of these items : Butterfly, BKB, Basher/Ablade, Moon Shard, Skadi.

5030,"Hi !

&gt; To me, it is extremely hard to land with very restrained damage basing on past experience. It basically never lands good damage to me and it is extremely hard to land it in big fights as it could be countered by healing or it just will not do a good job against tanky opponents. 

You are right, and in 90% of my WD games I go 4-4-0-3 until level 22. Maledict is very situationnal. That’s also what this WD guide recommends : http://munqst.github.io/2015/07/08/hero-guide-WD.html

&gt; Now someone pointed me today for not putting in Maledict at all today, and Maledict would have score a couple of kills to me. Is it really that good? Reading the description of the skill in game or even in wiki, it is extremely confusing and I do not know how it works, except knowing it as some DOT, even situationally when it is useful that when I should completely skip leveling it or level it full.

So, let me explain how Maledict works first : it does a couple things.

- It applies a DoT

- Every 4 seconds, it deals damage based on the HP lost *since the beginning of the Maledict debuff*. There are 3 ticks to it.

So let’s consider that you have a carry that does 100 DPS to an enemy that’s maledicted. Let’s ignore the magic resistance and the maledict DoT, and consider maledict will just inflict damage every 4 seconds to simplify the calculations.

So the first tick will do 400*0.4 = 160 damage.

The second tick will do (160 + 800)*0.4 = 384 damage.

The third tick will do (160 + 384 + 1200)*0.4 = 697 damage.

So as you can see, it goes up exponentially in power. It’s a very good skill in the late game.

Never complain if your team makes joke item builds. Sometimes you can point out that they need items (one of my favorites is : I know that Lion went for aghs-dagon, and in the middle of a fight, we are chasing someone. I tell lion : « Blink hex ! Blink hex ! » as if he had one, so that he realizes that he needs it). It *will* lose you games, it *will* make your games harder. Honestly, I can’t remember how many useless omnis I have seen, and they were useless because they built phase+vlad’s+radiance instead of arcanes+soul ring so they ran out of mana.

Also, don’t be greedy with your spells. On Witch Doctor, I don’t try to get a 5-man death ward every fight, that’s a bonus if it happens but I don’t rely on it. Same with CM. Their ults have low cooldowns so just throw them.

If you play a squishy hero but you have to initiate (namely initiating supports like Sand King or Earthshaker), either do it with BKB, or initiate then immediately run away as fast as you can. Let your team catch up. Don’t try to be the hero, you are not supposed to be one. Your team will clean up, don’t worry.

Knowing when and how to initiate also comes when you play a lot of dota. You don’t have many games under your belt, these will come with experience.

Are you tired of those BlyatCyka pickers ? Do you want to be the biggest cancer ever ? Do you want to laugh at any projectile or delayed spell ? These guys are perfect for you.

Start off in the safe lane. Buy tangos, salve, and adapt the rest of your build to your needs (against Bristle, go for RoP+stick, it helps a lot). Last hit with your great base damage. If someone tries to annoy you throw a spirit lance at him. For skill build, you want to go for 1213141 stats stats stats 42223433 and then stats. For items, in the early game you want brown boots, quelling, RoA, vlad’s (yes, even though the auras don’t stack well), possibly a wand, and then your first big item : *boots of travel*.

What ? No treads ? Yes that’s right, no treads. I told you, you want to be cancerous. And how are you cancerous ? You split push ! BoTs allow you to split push constantly with your vlad’s and still be there for fights. Your behavior follows a really simple flow chart :

- Are the enemies spread out and in every lane ? Then farm jungle

- Are the enemies grouped up ? Then push elsewhere and keep your eyes on your minimap, your finger on doppelgänger

- Are the enemies invisible on the map ? Play safe and stay behind your allies

- Does your team want to start a fight ? Get ready to BoT in.

After your BoTs, you will get diffusal blade and manta. Usually diffusal first, but manta first is sometimes OK too. Then eventually skadi, butterfly and any other item (hex is underrated on PL). Try to upgrade your diffusal when you get 0 charges, not before. Keep the split push going. If you are in the jungle, use QB or doppelgänger to cut trees and have some illusions tank for you (pre vlad’s). Post vlad’s, you just regen as much as you tanked.

**How do you behave during fights ?** It’s very simple. You stay back first and spam spirit lance. If there is a WK, a storm, or an earthshaker on the enemy team, you target them first. Then when most abilities are used you rush on their supports and kill them. Then you kill them all.

**But they picked EarthShaker against me !** First of all, be happy, they didn’t pick Ember Spirit and they in fact picked a hero that’s really easy to play around as PL. [Like very easy](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1769942743). [Really fucking easy](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1767496332). Split push normally, ES has no way to clear illus.

- First, here is a video for a guide on a carry naga : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDxYuh3nQVQ

- As a carry, skill build is 4-0-2-1 at level 7 into 4-0-4-1 or 3, possibly taking 1 point in net but not more. The only thing is that this guide is for 6.83, so Octarine is not discussed, but it’s pretty much as a replacement for Heart. As a support, it’s a bit more varied, but you usually want mirror image at level 1 or 2 for stacking, and then you alternate between net and rip tide, taking your ult whenever you can.

- You have 2 ways of micro illusions : either cloning (using shift + 1 control group) or use 3 separate control groups. I prefer using the control groups because it’s much better for a support naga, however for a carry naga it’s a bit faster to use cloning I think.

- Usually, try to go mid if you want to play a core naga. You need a quick level 9 to increase your farming speed, you are not very vulnerable to ganks because 6 base armor and 320 MS, you have an easy access to the jungle and you will have a much easier time bottle crowing and getting runes, which is crucial. You need to spam spells as Naga because of a very simple concept : **mana transfers into gold**. Each usage of Mirror image can be seen as a gold gain, each usage of rip tide can be considered the same way. So you need to spam a lot.

- For the radiance timing it depends on how much you were shut down, but if you had good last hits, you should have QB+aquila+boots+bottle+radiance around 20 minutes.",2015-09-08 21:40:08+00:00,cuuw06s,1.0,t3_3k4c02,13971.0,learndota2

5084,"Hi ! Undying is one of my highest winrate heroes, I play him a bit in ranked when I go support or offlane.

Here are my undying games : http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?date=&amp;hero=undying&amp;skill_bracket=&amp;lobby_type=&amp;game_mode=&amp;region=&amp;faction=&amp;duration=&amp;enjoyment=any&amp;timezone=Europe%2FBerlin

I’m 1.9k at the moment.

So for your answers to your questions :

- Your build is pretty good, but I would remove Heart from it. Here are my 2 ways of building undying :

1. The hard support undy : tranquil boots, urn/soul ring, glimmer cape, etc

2. The greedy undy : arcanes into greaves, and big items like necro, aghs, shivas etc

For starting/early items, an item that is often overlooked but in my opinion is huge is **Orb of Venom**. You can do crazy stuff with it.

- Your placement will come with practice. Don’t forget that you can use the tomb on cliffs to prevent enemies from focusing it.

And a few tips from the back of my head :

- Try to pick undy with some dual or tri lane that owns if you play him as a support. He is meant to shit on the enemies’ early game. Undy-viper, undy-sniper, undy-veno are classic. Also, you can pick him with deathballing carries, he gets a huge spike at level 7 when tomb is level 4 and he has ult. Examples : Luna, Gyro, Bloodseeker, any mek carrier

- If an enemy comes to your lane as Undy, just fucking kill him. You are an early game god for a reason.

- In the late game, your decay doesn’t matter, stay back and spam soul rip. Your tombstone will probably disappear quickly too.

- You can skip more levels of decay and go 1-4-4-3 at level 16, or alternate decay and stats, like I did in my last game.

- Don’t let yourself fall off and *get dem towers*. You have absurdly low cooldowns on Tombstone and Flesh golem, you should use them as often as you can.

- If you have 1 spare minute of farming, use tombstone to farm 2 or 3 camps at the same time. It has a very low cooldown.

- Tombstone destroys trees, it’s very useful to prevent juking.

- Beware Gyro and Ember spirit, especially ember.

Undying is very strong as of now, so you will probably have a lot of fun playing him. Happy diving.

5094,"So, Earthshaker has these weaknesses against PL :

- awful mana pool

- Echo has 2 minutes CD

- less mobile than PL

- extremely predictable

So for the way of exploiting it, it’s pretty simple. I usually get brown boots - aquila - vlads - BoTs - diffusal/yasha into diffusal. You keep split pushing. If shaker is not on the map, you back off from the wave as soon as you have 4 or 5 illusions. If he doesn’t get a good echo on you, he is garbage against a split pushing PL. Thanks to bots, you rack up farm and he can not do anything about it. And ES has no waveclear.

In fights, you can either bait Echo Slam on you and doppel away just in time (extremely risky, but the reward is high), stay back and spam spirit lance, just not be there and rat, or always stick illusions up his ass. Remember that :

- When he used echo, he is harmless

- Fissure can be dodged with manta and doppel

- Keep the vision and him and avoid him (remember, unlike ES, PL is extremely mobile with rush + doppel)

- If he waits for you to be exposed to an echo that’s more time when the fight is in your favor.

I plan on making a video to explain that. I hope I was clear in this post though :)

- Greed is good unless they have an anti-carry on their team like Riki. People just **refuse** to farm for some reason at this level. Sometimes, picking a fifth carry is OK.

- Be consistent, farm well.

- And my advice about mindset : yes, sometimes your team loses you the game. In the game I linked, you know how many times legion used Duel during the whole game ? 3 TIMES. Yes, your teammates lose you games. But **what’s the point of criticizing your team** ? You will never play with them again.

5145,"I will try to help you as much as I can. PL is my second most played hero, and one of my best carries : https://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906

Here is an example of a game when I won against a team made of 4 PL counters + dazzle : https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1760551451

The replay is still available if you want to watch it.

So first and foremost, here are (in my opinion) the worst counters against PL, from most annoying to least annoying :

- **Ember spirit, Storm Spirit** : God tier. I’m going to go as far as saying PL is unpickable against these heroes. You *can* outplay them, but it’s really, really, really, really hard. The reason for this is : they have sustained AoE damage, ways to control you, they come online faster than you, and they deal with you very well in the late game. Even if you buy a Hex to deal with them, Ember and Storm can just (and should) buy a Linken’s.

**Counters** : Cry in a corner, or get your team to initiate on them. If you have a lot of silences on your team, take Ember or Storm down first.

- **Disruptor and Riki** : A tier. So, disruptor and riki are both great against PL for slightly different reasons. Disruptor is great against PL because when he ganks you with a teammate, he forces you to hold on your Doppelgänger and wait for Glimpse. So he can just not cast glimpse and kill you. He has also a silence that you can’t do anything about unless you buy a BKB and you don’t want that on PL. Riki is a similar story. He is more annoying early on but less later on. Against Smoke screen, you have to get either BKB or MKB and you don’t want to buy either one of these items. Also, in the early game, he makes you miss on a lot of farm because he is impossible to track down unless you have great wards everywhere.

**Counters** : BKB and vision. Avoid them as much as you can.

- **Tiny, Medusa and Sven** : A- tier. These heroes have a common point : they are impossible to manfight as PL, as they provide huge AoE damage with autoattacks. However, Tiny and Sven have problems with kiting. If you face up against these heroes as PL, never try to manfight them unless you have your whole team with you and you have a hero advantage. Go for the backlines, you have a very mobile hero and you should use this advantage. Also, Sven’s stun is dodgeable with Manta and Doppelgänger, Tiny’s combo is also avoidable but harder to dodge. Medusa is a bit more delicate to handle. Try to send a lot of illusions in her face and to bait stone gaze, then disengage. When Stone gaze ends, reengage by lancing, rushing, and hexing her if you happen to have a hex. Otherwise, if you don’t have hex, get your team to stun the dusa and burn her mana during the stun. She is very squishy afterwards.

**Counters** : avoid them in fights, dodge their stuns, go for their allies before. You can use Spirit lance’s huge uptime (it’s 50% uptime IIRC) to kite them even more. You can consider Eblade against both of these heroes, and Butterfly against Tiny because Tiny doesn’t wear an MKB very well.

- **Earthshaker, Silencer, Skywrath Mage, PA** : B tier. These heroes counter you for very different reasons. Silencer can just kill you with his team or help his team kill you from across the map as soon as he reaches 6. Silences are great against PL before he gets manta. PA is as mobile as PL, forces PL to buy MKB (and again, it’s not very good on PL), and has a lot of single target burst to kill the real one. If PA goes for a battlefury you can be even more fucked, because she just becomes a scarier Sven. The reason why I didn’t put PA in the above tier is that she is not online before you, so you have a timing window. And she is burstable. Skywrath mage is very squishy but can kill you without any problem if he ganks you with +1 and his team mate stuns you. Watch out for Axe+Sky in particular. On the other hand you can kill him too if you manage to somehow get diffusal. You can diffuse yourself of the ancient seal and the concussive shot slow. Earthshaker has 1 spell that can fuck you REALLY HARD, otherwise he is pretty garbage. So he is very predictable, but if you fuck up once you die and so does your team. Against an Earthshaker, try to bait echo slams, keep illusions sticked to his ass because he has a trash mana pool, and doppelgänger as soon as you see that he walks in to echo.

Also, these 4 heroes are pretty garbage against a split pushing PL. I especially recommend Vlad’s against them.

**Counters** : Outplaying them, split pushing.

Hope this helps, and good luck with Ebola Lancer !

Edit : I forgot about Earth Spirit. He is as annoying as Silencer, and you play against him the same way as you play against Silencer. Don’t forget that all of his spells are purgeable.

Second edit : I agree with /u/tomato_on_uranus on the itemization and the playstyle. /u/nobuharu mentioned Gyro and Luna as counters to PL. Luna and Gyro are both 2 carries that I play in my opinion quite decently (70% WR on Luna over 30ish games, 60ish% WR on gyro over 45ish games), and I think they are actually quite rekt by PL. PL doesn’t really care about Flak Cannon because he can disengage, then reengage after 15 seconds, and he doesn’t give a shit about rocket barrage because he splits damage between illusions. Luna’s glaives are actually pretty garbage at dealing with PL, PL just generates a lot more illusions than Luna can destroy with glaives. Luna can not eclipse PL because his illusions will tank everything. And Luna is very squishy.",2015-09-01 18:13:42+00:00,cun9443,1.0,t3_3j7hmw,24213.0,learndota2
5146,"Thanks for bringing these threads back.

These last 2 days, I finally got a win streak again ! I’m particularly proud of 2 games : a [blyatcyka game](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1762288284) and an [Ember Spirit game](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1762119424).

The bloodseeker game is a good illustration of the saying : « Dota doesn’t have a surrender function for a reason. Never give up. ». I was focused down hard early, with their Timbersaw just camping in my woods. We were really far behind at some point. I told the Tiny and the Keeper whom I was in a stack with that we should only defend T3s and try to split push as much as we can. We were pretty much held in our base at some point and Tiny was pretty much itemless. Rubick stole rupture a few times to use it on me and this annoyed me to no end. But at some point we got BoTs on Keeper and my allies started hoping for a victory again. Then when they tried forcing highground, my Tiny and my Keeper of the light ratted top and bot rax while I was trying to stall with the 2 pickups. We didn’t even lose the mid melee rax. This was the turnaround of the game and afterwards we slowly starved them, until we just could force the mid rax to fall.

I got manta even though I had SnY because I needed to dispel global silence. Maybe I should have disassembled SnY to build manta+halberd. Anyway I think my optimism went a long way.

The Ember game was a ranked CM game. I sniped the captain role, and I communicated with my team as much as I could. Sometimes they praised my draft (« SF would have been good for them, good ban ») and they were pretty happy with the draft overall. I ended up going mid, which I rarely do. I was really scared of their Riki because he would not only silence me, but also dispel flame guard with smoke screen. Luckily, my Silencer (stackmate :D) shut him down HARD. In the meantime, I could solo kill the enemy mid 3 times. When their CM tried to TP in to help, I killed CM with 3 remnants in her face. Then I didn’t overextend and had pretty much a perfect game. I’m especially proud of this game because I played it with 200 ping consistently and in spite of this I very rarely missed a Slight of Fist into Searing Chains.",2015-09-01 17:48:06+00:00,cun83lr,1.0,t3_3j7vig,15086.0,learndota2

5176,"&gt; I chose pounce over dark pact, because slark is not centaur warrunner who can afford trading hp.

You can trade HP, your ult lets you regen, and you also do « +19 pure damage » because of essence shift. Past level 6 you are actually very capable of trading, especially if you bait disables and pact them.

&gt; And about dark pact, i was not farming forest until lvl 10.

So you had a tough lane but you were not transitioning to the jungle as soon as you could ? In these cases, as Slark, you can just leech and get a few last hits here and there until you get your 6 or 7 (and 4-1-1-1), then you go into the jungle and you farm there. It’s slightly slower than a lane at the start, but it’s way better than a heavily contested lane like you had.

&gt; Their disruptor was pretty useless, as i killed him many times when he tried to lock me in place.

Considering their lineup, it’s pretty much an ideal situation then.

&gt; Also, vlads give me armor. I had literally no armor through the game, and it gives me 2 more armor than aquila, and lifesteal lets me get more hp while in ulti, as ulti gave me +25 regen at lvl 1.

You are in dire need of mana regen as Slark, because **if you go for the standard 4-1-1-1 build**, you will need mana regen, and aquila is especially great for this because it’s not percentage based (remember, slark has low int but low mana costs, so aquila does wonders, much like gyro).

For the regen part : your ult regens you for 3%/5%/7% of your max HP when you are in fog. **It’s not static !** What this means is that getting HP items such as Drums or SnY gives you effectively more regen. It also gives you more farming speed because you regen more raw HP between camps so you don’t have to wait for your regen to kick in. And HP items, because of the way your ult works, give you actually more regen while in your ulti form. A lot more than vlad’s.

&gt; Yes, i could buy dominator for more armor and damage, but vlads give me mana regen and 15% damage bonus, so it will be useful, when i stole a lot of AGI.

Vlad’s is useful on any hero. It’s just that :

- The lifesteal doesn’t help you at all

- You don’t really need armor as slark, because 2 hits gives you almost 1 armor

- Mana regen is given by… aquila

And please, dominator is even worse than vlad’s.

&gt; I cannot farm lanes because they have strong wr with lots of damage, and they push by themselves.

That’s perfect, you can just kill them because they are alone and you are a Slark. And then you go back to farming.

&gt; and i couldnt push even if i wanted, because: 1. No farm(i couldnt push in early, before lvl 6, because laning was shit, i mostly had to lh under tower, after lvl 6 i had somewhat freefarm, i had time to farm forest. 

You have **3** spells that help you split push : dark pact to remove disables, pounce to escape, ult to TP out. And having no farm is not an excuse. Dark pact always deals damage whether or not you have farm. And with an aquila (guess what), you also split push faster.

&gt; And about not my itembuild. Skadi gives me no damage. No damage at all. Only thing it gives me is hp and slow, which wont work against wr, because windrun, sven, because i wont kill him in life, abaddon, because his ulti.

So first and foremost : Skadi gives you +25 agility. Slark gets +25 damage from it.

Second of all : it’s a common misconception to think that Slark needs damage. Slark needs **tankability**, **stats**, and **mobility**. That’s why Skadi and SnY are so great on him. Slark gets damage mostly thanks to essence shift. You pounce in, pact, hit a few times, run as pact ends, ult if needed, hide in fog, pounce back again, repeat. Before they know it, your enemies face off against a Slark with 2 free eaglesongs. **You need HP**. You just need it. It’s funny that you complain about being one-shot by Sven when your build suggests that you wanted it.

&gt; I have lothar, because its slark core item

It’s not. Watch BSJ’s video, he explains a lot why shadow blade is no longer core on Slark.

&gt; I has permanently switched to str threads, i have basher, that gives me some hp AND damage

Strength treads give you +9 str, you get +8 from basher. You know which item gives you as much HP as *both* of these items combined for only 2k gold ? Sange ! Which brings me back to my point about Sange being super effective.

&gt; Moon shard gives me a lot of atkspeed.

That is true, and moon shard is very good as a late game item on slark.

&gt; SaY do not. It gives me slow, but i have pounce, shitty amount of damage and hp. Gosh, HALBEARD is better on slark.

You are saying so many wrong things at once. Pounce is great, but you will see from playing a lot of Slark that you often end up chasing after a pounce, and for this situation SnY is lovely.

And for the « Shitty amounts of HP » part : **your WHOLE inventory gave you +29 strength, for almost 20k gold !** For only 2k gold, you can get a sange which gives you half as much HP. It’s 5 times more efficient to get a Sange than all of your items there. As I said before, you would have had more HP from BKB+SnY+drums+treads, for a lot less gold.

&gt; It gives me more hp, evasion, damage compared AND disarm, which makes wr useless.

I think pudge should have gone for halberd TBH. But you can also consider it.

&gt; Drums give me atkspeed, that i dont need too, and it gives me less... than 200 hp. Such effective Much good item.

*something something* less than 2k gold

&gt; Seriously, it gives me low hp, damage, mana for almost 2k gold. Did i have to say that without active spell drums are way weaker?

What ? It gives you a lot more for its cost than big items like Moonshard. Seriously, if drums had an upgrade, I would buy them every game as a carry. And you don’t need a charge from drums for it to be an amazing item.

&gt; So about standard build, we will start with roa. It is good item at start of the game, but if you have 50 cs at 20 min, this is not a good item.

It is a good item on Slark, even in this situation.

&gt; This is not good item to take even with decent/good farm at 20 min. I said about drums, sange and yasha already. Butterfly is ultralate item, i had no time to build it.

It is. I believe you about butterfly, but I believe you are seeing it the wrong way.

Really, I highly recommend you to watch BSJ’s video. It’s litterally a gold mine, I learned so much from it.

Here is my last Slark game :

As opposed to you in your game, I had an enemy lineup that worked well against Slark. They have Viper (so freaking annoying to any melee carry), Axe (calls you in shadow dance), Rubick (can initiate on you before you can react with dark pact), pudge (hooks you during shadow dance), timbersaw (burst that hits during shadow dance).

Seriously though, here are my thoughts on your items and skill build, as well as your stats :

- Skill build : don’t max pounce first. Your skill build in 99% of your games as Slark is 23111412224333Stats4. You max dark pact first because it gives you more damage than pounce, and it helps your farm a lot.

- Stats : 9 deaths on a Shadow blade Slark. Seriously. I know you are against a disruptor, but that’s not an excuse. When you see a disruptor, you ult-tp. They had no way to cancel a TP during shadow dance. And 419 tower damage ? Were you actively trying not to hit towers ?

- Items : So, my first question is : why did you get vlad’s ? Why would you ever need vlad’s on Slark ? You don’t need lifesteal because you have shadow dance, and while it makes you tankier, it’s much less cost effective for a slark than drums or even sny.

Second question : why didn’t you get SnY nor BKB ? You didn’t build any item to make you tankier, unless you think of basher and ulti orb as items that make you tanky. In particular, you needed BKB here because you could avoid being glimpsed. Also, I don’t think building Shadow blade is a good idea because everyone apart from disruptor survives your nukes well and disruptor wrecks you. I think you should have just sticked to the standard build : Treads-RoA-drums-SnY and then probably BKB into Butterfly or Moon Shard (or maybe AC/Linkens ?)

- 199 last hits in 40 minutes. That goes back to my point of not being efficient with your skill build. If you had maxed dark pact first, you could have had at least 50 CS more probably.

I recommend you to watch BananaSlamJamma’s slark guide : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqxkftBwxxE

5183,"I play Luna a lot too, I kinda feel your pain. I have around 70% winrate as Luna, but that’s not because the hero is good, it’s because I’m a lot more efficient when I play Luna than pretty much everyone else on the match and I push a lot. Here are my Luna games : https://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?date=&amp;hero=luna&amp;skill_bracket=&amp;lobby_type=&amp;game_mode=&amp;region=&amp;faction=&amp;duration=&amp;enjoyment=any&amp;timezone=Europe%2FBerlin

So for your 4 points : I absolutely agree. Luna gets dealt with by pretty much every hero in the game. But as opposed to what you said, you can contribute a lot in early fights, just don’t be afraid to use your ult even for a single hero pickoff.

&gt; Edit: Only carry. Not midlane as there is enough fight to get mid already (Sea server)

It’s the right decision.

If you still have Luna coming across you in a game, here are a few suggestions anyway :

- Get your items on the same slot, especially BKB

- Learn to stack and farm as quickly as you can, Luna is one of the only heroes with which I manage to get more than 300 CS in 35ish minutes because she is a flash farmer.

- Secure towers early, you need to have an advantage at 30 minutes.

Luna is sort of similar to a Gyrocopter (farms quickly and gets ancient stacks) mixed in with a Lone Druid (needs babysitting and doesn’t contribute a lot early, then becomes a monster once she gets BKB, and needs to secure an advantage because she falls off quite hard late game).

May I suggest you Phantom Lancer for a carry ? Especially if you have trouble against Bloodseeker.",2015-08-27 08:40:48+00:00,cuh9ki9,1.0,t3_3ij368,33371.0,learndota2

As for items, the absolute core is wand, brown boots and orb of venom. Past this point, you have 2 routes :

- The tranquils route, aka hard support undy : tranquils are great on undying because he lacks armor and HP regen. Building tranquils alongside medallion/crest, urn, or even soul ring allows you to support well, secure roshes and not die too much.

- The mek+arcanes route, aka the greedy undy : my preferred build if I snowball. Basically, you get arcanes, then mek starting from buckler, and then a lot of other items can be purchased : you can go necro/ac for the pushing power, vlad’s/shivas/crimson as you said if you need either auras or slows (but I don’t get vlad’s or crimson often), you can go for pipe… The same items as an abaddon basically, except you need less mobility. You can also get crest or items like that. In general, this way of playing focuses more on big items because you will be a lot less selfless.

5186,"&gt; I've been advised to pick up a Mek when I'm playing Lich or **Lion**.

[You need a better counsel](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/a/a0/Wraith_death_long_04.mp3).

I build mek pretty rarely, but recently I have liked it a bit more on supports, particularly on heroes like Shadow Shaman. Here are the reasons as to why I build mek :

- I don’t have mana issues (THAT’S WHY YOU DON’T BUILD MEK ON FUCKING LION)

- I build arcanes (for greaves)

- I don’t die often, so I can get it at a reasonable time

- But still I need survivability

&gt; when is it worth getting a Mek on a Lion?

NEVER. You are right, mek on Lion is a no-go because blink+force are so much better. 

The last game when I went for Mek on a support was this one : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1724644639

First of all, treant also got mek but he was irrelevant. I needed survivability to go up against everyone on their team but sky and I also needed more than urn to heal my allies because my abaddon refused to support (which considered our lineup was probably the best idea…). Visage also didn’t get mek even though I think he was probably the best carrier (he went mid btw). The way I behaved in fights was : stand really far back (1 step forward and I was dead off the bad), go slightly up the fight and pop mek, and then look for an opportunity to hex+shackle someone. Use ether shock at the end of the shackles. This added survivability allowed me to have the least deaths on my team, and the pushing power + shaman ult helped me get by far the most tower danage on my team (Visage did quite a bit, but he also asked me to micro his birds, which I did)",2015-08-27 08:02:10+00:00,cuh90em,1.0,t3_3ikgj7,5623.0,learndota2

5188,"I also skip it on support Silencer.

Short answer : this skill is garbage.

Long answer :

Let’s consider the values to this spell. It costs 75/95/115/135 mana and drains 8/16/24/32 mana per second, as well as 20/35/50/65 HP per second. Which means that *if you get a full duration curse* (it’s NOT a given at all, because heroes like WK and Jugg are kind of rare actually), you can deal up to 120/210/300/390 damage (before reduction) and burn 48/96/144/192 mana on a single unit. 

So here is Curse’s first problem : this spell is awfully bad at level 1, because it drains 48 mana max and costs 75. At level 2, its max mana drain is its mana cost. Compared to clock’s cogs who cost 50 and drain something like 75 mana (can’t remember the exact values, clock players can you help me ?) at level 1.

Curse has to be leveled up to 4 to have its real potential, because that’s when the mana drain kicks in as well as the damage. Leveling curse has another problem : it costs a lot of mana. If you level up curse first, you won’t have enough mana to cast your other skills. In particular, Last Word and glaives (your real damage skills) won’t be castable and will make you miss kills.

Second downside of the curse build is that you hit like a wet piece of paper. With a 0-2-4-1 build at level 7, you do 300 damage with Last word and 22ish pure damage from each auto attack with Glaives. With a 4-1-1-1 build, you do on paper as much damage, but you have a slow that’s less potent, you let enemy heroes cast their escapes instead of preventing them with last word, and most of your damage is magical instead of being pure. Not to mention going for a kill costs you about as much mana, but harassing with a curse build is way less efficient than with a no curse build, because glaives will be at level 1 so they will deal less damage.

And as others said that, Curse scales really poorly as the game goes on.",2015-08-27 07:41:06+00:00,cuh8ow1,1.0,t3_3ijr85,18525.0,learndota2

Here are the best counters to him imho :

- Sven

- Brood (shuts him down early)

- riki (shuts down his midgame farm)

- disruptor (he forces pl to wait for glimpse before using doppel)

- tiny is manageable, but tiny/wisp is hard to deal with

- pa with battlefury is a decent counter

- earthshaker forces the pl to play cautiously around blink and echo, but es is really far from being the worst counter

- the three spirits shut pl down hard if played correctly. Storm forces you to diffuse silences on you and has aoe with overload, ember has sleight of fist, earth has long range catch and silences.

If you don't have any of these heroes for some reason, here are a few tips :

- pl can buy both of the king bars, but he doesn't want to. Getting evasion forces him away from a stat item. Stuns stay effective on him during the whole game.

- silence him, and when he buys his manta, wait this out and then silence him

- bait doppelgängers. I have the reflexes to dodge with this spell, so if you for example cancel viper strike on me you can bait out a doppel

Here is my dotabuff : http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?date=&amp;hero=gyrocopter&amp;skill_bracket=&amp;lobby_type=&amp;game_mode=&amp;region=&amp;faction=&amp;duration=&amp;enjoyment=any&amp;timezone=Europe%2FBerlin

So first thing : I’m awful at early last hitting with Gyro, and sometimes I end up with a lane where I’m either 1v2 (no ally to last hit with, and OF COURSE the enemies have 2 ranged heroes with a viper in their lane), or 1v3 early (my « ally » starts stealing farm from me…). However, the reason I end up with the most farm in pretty much every game I play is that *I know how to come back from an early start* (and because my enemies refuse to farm, yeah…). Even if you have 10 CS at minute 5, you have a few ways to come back with Gyro :

- Gank when you hit 6. No one expects a Gyro to rotate this early from the safe lane. You can also get kills 1v2 if you hit your ulti on both your enemies at level 6, call down is really beautiful early on

- Once you get aquila, start taking jungle camps as well as pushing.

- Once you get your helm, flak cannon should never ever be on cooldown, unless a fight is about to break out. You should always try to kill at the very least 5 creeps with every flak cannon usage.

- Speaking of fights, try not to join too many before BKB or SnY. Once you get BKB/SnY, go wreck faces.

- Never stop farming and pushing. In particular, don’t forget to stack ancients and clear them !

- Get a quelling blade. It does not only increase your farming speed, but also cutting trees in the jungle is very efficient (same goes with Medusa)

- Try to end the game when you get an advantage that’s enough to let you breach high ground. Gyro gets outcarried.

Also, to add to the answer to your question, yes Gyro has an awful base damage value, but he has a great attack point and the best missile speed in the game along with Sniper. So he is not bad at all for last hitting. And barrage can secure you farm.

At this low MMR, last hits in lane will not be secured to you by anyone, don’t expect to have the standard 60 in 10 minutes. You will end up having to try to CS 1v3 while the enemy mid decides that he wants to have a party under the tower more often than you will get free farm. Get used to it, and **recover in the mid game**. For some reasons, people at our levels believe creeps disappear at some point (I think ? What would be another reason to stop trying to get gold), so it’t very, very easy to come back and have 1 item up on the enemy.

I don’t know if it’s the best game to analyze since I won this one, but I think I can take away some things from it.

I was playing Io (I love Io, but I can’t play him very well), dual mid with a Tiny. My teammates were very responsive to my communication, and it was a very nice game overall. However, I did many, many things wrong here, namely not carrying dust for mirana ult, stupidly dying, losing the lane to 1 hero (Sniper) and missing relocates.

5231,"I will analyze your last Drow game and tell you what went wrong. It will be in an edit.

Pre-analysis (stats of the game) :

- 200 last hits in 50 minutes is not that bad, but it can be improved

- less than 400 GPM on drow is unacceptable

- 2k tower damage is WAY TOO LOW for a drow ranger

- Itemization : consider getting BoTs, not getting crystalys, getting MoM instead of Helm, and getting 2 or 3 wraith bands early, 1 of which you will turn into an aquila. For extension items, you can consider Skadi, Butterfly, Satanic (super late), Eblade, and stat items in general. Drums is OK too. You can also get blink if you trust in your reaction time.

- Skill build : there is almost no reason to not take Marksmanship at level 6. I usually leave gust at level 0/1, frost arrows at level 0/1, max precision aura first, and then take stats+ulti.

**Comments on the game** :

- Starting build : Your build is perfectly fine. You can also consider getting more regen if you think you will lane against a Clinkz, or a Circlet instead of Slippers.

- I would rather contest the rune than block on the safe lane personnally

- You leave the base early, but you don’t do much with it (you just run in circles next to your base). You still got both runes, great.

- Good creep block, although I don’t think letting the ranged creep go first is good in this case

- Laning stage (until 2:30) : You don’t miss too many last hits, pretty good. Don’t be afraid to trade with Clinkz, you have more damage, an orb, and an earthshaker. Also try to predict tower shots to last hit better.

- 3:30 : Why are you so defensive ? Also I would have gone for a 1/1/2 skill build instead of 2/0/2

- 5:08 : I take back my point, you are missing last hits. The thing is, your CS are very equal (and very low) for Clinkz and you, but Clinkz makes it hard for him by auto attacking, and you are making it hard for you by letting him push into your tower

- 5:18 : You have a tango in your stash to ferry. It’s great that you think about bringing more regen when your lane sucks. You should also probably buy a dust and request a gank from ES

- 6:15 : buying wards when your team doesn’t want, great thing

- 6:37 : Lane rotation, you are now up against weaver. You play back very far, which is good because they are not showing

- around 7 min : you are looking around, it’s great and you should do it more. You would be able to trade if you had marksmanship.

- 9 min : You now have 20 CS. It can definitely be improved, even if you were in unfavorable 1v1s you can get 30 at least.

- 10 minutes : Why don’t you pick up Treads from the side shop ? I also disagree with Treads, I think you should go Yasha into Manta into BoTs and add a MoM somewhere

- 11:16 : Phew, you barely made it. Good reflexes, you did not panic and you TP’d out. If you had picked up treads in the side shop, it would have been a lot less close. And also, don’t look at your hero in the fountain, spend time looking around and checking items.

- 12:30 : Go into the jungle, seriously, you still have tangos and a salve. Okay nvm, your brood stole your jungle (WTF ???)

- 14min : If you had a dust, this clinkz was dead. He also would have been dead if you had chained your silence better. Don’t be too greedy however, layering a bit is fine since you need to not leave him a chance to flee.

- 14:30 : GANK TRAIN. It was hard to see coming though

- 15:25 : Good decision to TP bot to split push and take their jungle

- 15:55 : I hear the vendetta sound, is it a replay bug ?

- 16 min : Don’t stay under tower, go farm your ancients

- 16:02 : Gank train again. This time you were out of position, being in the river when a Weaver was there 10 seconds ago is never a good sign, especially if they have 2 invis heroes

- 16:54 : again, use your deaths to look around (this brood item build XD)

- 17:09 : You should tell your brood to GTFO and farm the enemy jungle + the offlane, she is actively dragging the team down. You can not really be blamed for standing under tower this time.

- 17:50 : Good decision to push when NP is dead, but don’t forget to turn on Aquila

- 18:39 : This fight was hilarious. Good TP out at the end.

- 19:00 : You keep buying wards, you should really have 1 wraith band or bracer in your inventory and ask your supports to ward (WTF is earthshaker doing ?), also leave your treads on str

- 19:40 : Go farm ancients !

- 20:08 : Stop running in circles and farm anything. You have the jungle and the ancients available again

- 21min : missed LH and other stuff

- 21:52 : FINALLY

- around 23 min : What a dust, holy shit. I’m not kidding, this is great game sense. However, you crossed the river alone against now 3 invis heroes (yeah, NP went shadow blade *facepalm*). You barely made it, good job.

- 24:40 : WTF are you doing ? Just finish off the camp and ward.

- 25:10 : Nyx is bot, split push the mid T2 instead of backing off

- 25:30 : Finish off your stack ! Why are you refusing to farm ?

- 26 min : You died after litterally GOING AFTER THE NYX. Avoid him.

- 27:53 : You should have stacked the camp instead of farming it and then farmed it, but most importantly you should be split pushing with WR when nyx is dead. You have no business in your jungle as of now.

- 28:20 : What’s the purpose of this dance ?

- 28:53 : Good kill, but stop refusing to farm. You have a small camp that you just passed by when litterally the WHOLE jungle was cleared. You lost time. Again.

- 29:10 : Are you trying to dodge a potential impale ? If you are worried about nyx being in your jungle, just don’t farm it. Just A-click in the middle of the camp (not on its edge like you did) and look around while you farm.

- 29:40 : Same as before. Push when nyx is dead. Convert kills into objectives. This T2 should not be standing for long. Instead, you farm your own jungle, which gives you absolutely nothing.

- 30 min : You are not looking around at all now, and you are AFK farming. Look around. Don’t just look at the minimap.

- 31 min : You were trying to split push at the wrong time. Ask someone to place a ward at the entrance of your jungle (+ a sentry), and just farm your jungle when nyx is not dead and you don’t have vision of him.

- 33ish minutes : You should try to 5 man and get objectives

- 34 minutes : Holy shit dat SF damage. It’s a good time to rosh.

- 34:30 : See above for « Convert your kills into objectives »

- 35:42 : Just 5 man and push ! NP is down…

- 36:00 : This kill would not have happened if you were trying to force an objective with your team.

I will stop for now, I will come back to it later.

Basically, you have decent map awareness, your LH early needs to be worked on, and you need to push a lot more. It’s very hard against 3 invis, but pushing wins games (here, I think radiant lost because they believed they were in CoD and tried to push as little as they could. « Killkillkillkill »)

5237,"You have already started your calibration, so your MMR at the start will not depend on your pubs anymore. The MMR used for calibration was used for your first calibration game, so now your unranked MMR and your ranked MMR are completely independant.

With that in mind, and as someone who calibrated at 1.3k because I calibrated at level 13 (I am now 1.7k) :

You definitely do not improve in ranked around 1k. 

You see a lot of mistakes. Not necessarily dumb item choices (more often than not people build items that are suboptimal but make sense), but many times weird skill builds (ah, the classic PA who maxes phantom strike first, the sniper who gets shrapnel at level 10, and the undying who maxes tombstone last…), and most importantly weird ways to think about the game (« We need tank », « It’s 4 minutes in and I died once in the offlane, I can’t farm, mid gank plox *pingpingpingping* », etc).

I tried playing supports, and gave up on it once I realized it was more reliable to play self-sustained carries, and even in pubs I had really depressing games as a support. I tried to work on my consistency. Which translates to : *instead of trying to have better games on your heroes, try to have as little bad games as possible*. That means a few things as a carry :

- Get your items at the right timing

- Don’t waste time

- Always think ahead

And most of this philosophy applies to supports and other core roles too. If you play QoP, try to consistently have 2 kills by the 12 minute mark (1 for each sonic wave used). If you play gyro as a carry, you can try to have phase/treads+aquila+QB+helm around 12 minutes. You know the drill.

To come back to your question :

You most likely won’t be calibrated at 2k because you started calibrating at level 13. However, you can learn to be consistent in ranked. And I think being consistent under 2k, where litterally every kind of shit happens every game, makes you a better player, and MMR follows.",2015-08-16 20:17:04+00:00,cu55pdo,1.0,t3_3h821u,6521.0,learndota2
5238,"He *can* be played as a support (ppd has done it several times for EG), and IIRC the reason you pick him is the combo with Primal Roar and Call of the Wild (and the free vision from the Hawk). So for example, if you have an Invoker on your team, it’s one of the best setups for a sunstrike (it even moves enemies so that only 1 takes damage !), if you have a Tinker on your team or other natural BoT carriers who gank, you can use Call of the Wild to scout and then BoT on top of him, if you need the vision against Slark or Nightstalker it’s a good pick too (and Primal Roar vs Slark is a godsend), and if you need lockdown vs BKB he is great.

So basically, if you pick him when you *really* need what BM brings to the table (vision, lockdown, call of the wild, maybe even the aura for a tiny or sth), but you already have 3 cores, he is god damn fine as a support.

- spirit breaker : the biggest slark counter for me. Disables your regen with a global range, prevents you from tping away, 17%s your face until you are but a rotten fish.

- aa : if aa hits ult on you (a bit hard to do though)

- kotl and ns, with aghs on either hero (vision)

- nightstalker (silence after dark pact, then hit him)

- blyatcyka (forces you to get a salve and effectively reduces your max hp by 25%)

- disruptor (you have to dance tp when you see a disruptor, else you just die)

- earthshaker, lina, lion : burst damage or instant lockdown for after dark pact + ground targeted stuns for shadow dance

- undying : 5 mans very early (slark is bad in early skirmishes)

- PL : breaks leash with doppelgänger, and diffusal is a pain to deal with (you need a lot of mana on slark)

- am : mana break + blink to escape you

- beastmaster : hawk gives vision

- meepo : net can hit an ultied slark, blink-poof kills him

- storm : ball lightning &gt; pounce, natural orchid carrier

- qop : burst + blink to chase

- sf : can raze an invis slark

He has actually quite a bit of counters. But the main thing when you play against slark is : if he has shadow blade, 5-man, and don't reengage on a slark if you lost vision unless you have a blink hero.",2015-08-12 04:35:41+00:00,cu01mwz,1.0,t3_3go9np,7974.0,learndota2

5269,"The golden rule, no matter which carry you are playing, goes as follows :

**Pounce on free kills, push when you can, fight when you have to, farm the rest of the time**.

In practice, this means that you will spend a lot of time alone on other lanes split pushing. However, on carries like Gyro, you can have a huge impact in early fights, so get a TP ready. You will usually join a fight late, and that’s pretty much always the right thing to do.

Whenever you see a fight breaking out, just ask yourself this question : « Does my presence there make a big difference ? »

If the answer is yes, then join the fight. If no, keep split pushing.

What you are seeing other people blaming you for not doing is excessive 5-manning. In general, as a carry, it’s the right decision to be away from your team. A lot of people try to force pointless fights when they could just gain a lot more gold by farming, or actually taking objectives (like Rosh or towers). You should always be doing something productive, be it farming, taking objectives like Rosh or towers, or farming. Never be jerking off with your team in your jungle just because they asked you to.

Which kind of carries do you play ? Some carries, like AM, join around 10-20% of fights usually. Some others, like Gyro, join about 50-60% of fights, and some like Spectre can either go « AFK farm » and join pretty much no fight or haunt in to help wehenever they can.

5272,"I play Gyro a bit, with around 62% winrate, and here is my input.

Gyro as a carry has the following characteristics :

- Squishy, especially early

- Wants to get on top of you (one of the only ranged carries who does that)

- Reliant on BKB

- Farms quickly

- Reliant on stacks

- Can rotate early

- Great AoE, but single target damage comes mostly from rocket barrage

- No control (missile takes 450 years to land)

Now, the worst hero matchups for a Gyro are heroes with either strong BKB-piercing burst, heroes that come on top of him and ignore rocket barrage, and heroes that require single target burst or CC to deal with.

Examples :

- Slark : slippery and has shadow dance

- Sven : 3 words. God's Strength stronk.

- QoP : sonic wave + dagger to bait bkb

- Clinkz : hunts gyro in his jungle, does physical damage.

- Lifestealer : innate BKB, great at manfighting gyro

- Lina : Laguna blade, can harass in lane without putting herself in danger of being shot by 30 rockets

- Riki : great matchup against gyro until he has bkb or mkb, he can hunt him down in his jungle or scout his stacks and smoke screen is great

- Tusk : kites gyro's BKB, punches him

- Beastmaster : BKB-piercing stun, scouts gyro in his jungle

- AM, outscales gyro and manta + spell shield = good barrages mate real funny See u at FUCK YOUJ. Also requires CC to deal with.

If you don't have these heroes by any chance, keep an eye out on gyro's items. As soon as he gets aquila+ helm+phase/treads, try to occupy his jungle and ward his ancients. In fights, dodge call down (it has a long delay and you hear him casting it), have supports get glimmer capes or force staves, and try to bait his BKB + satanic.",2015-08-09 15:22:23+00:00,ctwxbkj,1.0,t3_3gcpi6,2612.0,learndota2

The thing with Luna is that she has some very strong points :

- Good at trilaning with Blessing

- Good at pushing with Glaives, Blessing and an aquila

- Really bad range

- Decent nuke at level 1 and does good damage, but with a horrible attack animation (you stun yourself when you cast it, almost)

- Great at farming, especially stacks, and relies on them to boost her farm

- Does not play well from behind

- Gets outcarried by **a lot** of heroes, so she needs to get an advantage in the first 25-30 minutes

- Very squishy, even later on (you still feel like paper with skadi+satanic+butterfly+manta, like WTF)

- Relies on BKB

- Has a decent but unreliable teamfight ulti

But a couple things prevent her from being picked more in the pro scene especially :

- Trilaning is pretty uncommon in competitive with all the attention towards the mid lane

- Stacks are contested

- QoP makes quick work of a Luna

- She does not have her flash farming skill (Glaives) before level 8 (!!) because you max Lucent beam. Unlike Gyro who has *maxed* flak+barrage+ level 1 call down at level 9, all 3 of these skills being amazing to farm

- Her ulti is basically a worse call down. 3× as much CD, yet does provide no CC, and very unreliable

She is a worse Gyro. Unlike Gyro, she does not like being initiated on, yet she has a bad range. She can not use Lucent beam to farm. She can not use Eclipse to farm. She can push faster than Gyro, farm faster than Gyro still, but Gyro outcarries her.

Just off the back of my head, you could draft something like NS + Winter Wyvern/Shadow Shaman/Lion/Chen/Ench/Enigma as a support duo (WW gets night vision from arctic burn !), and as cores, you could get something like Slark (1800 night vision + loves being outside of enemy vision), Luna (to a lesser extent, she has actually quite a weak synergy with NS), and for the other cores, initiators work wonderfully because they love when they are unseen.

First of all : denying is in general made by a carry. I play carries and supports, and I don’t like supports touching the creeps when I play carry.

You do roughly the same things as a melee support as a ranged support, which are :

- Staying in the fog when you don’t zone out

- Pulling

- Ganking (if you play something like Ogre)

- Zoning

The difference is that zoning is done a bit less. You do the same moves (coming from the back to trade hits), but you right click when you are very close to the enemy offlaner.

5345,"&gt; Earthshaker is the obvious counter, Echo Slam is a free rampage if he gets it off.

&gt; Slardar seems good against her, given that Amplify Damage grants truesight for so long.

&gt; Sven or any natural Battlefury builder would be good too as they can just oneshot your army.

No, no and no. Competent brood players don’t fear ES, Slardar is absolute food for broodmother, Sven gets completely outlasted by brood. Battlefury builders will maybe finish battlefury by the time brood knocks on the T3, and that’s too late by this point.

The thing with Brood is that she is misunderstood in a lot of ways. Brood doesn’t win her lane by getting an army that only pushes the T1. She wins her lane by outlasting the enemy with Spin Web regen, and kills/pushes using broodlings. A competent brood player will not wait for your level 6. He will not wait for your levels in Great Cleave. He will not wait for your battlefury. He will not wait for your Earthshaker to have his blink. He will solo kill your whole trilane twice in 10 minutes if you are foolish enough to think AM is great against Brood because « he is a natural BF builder ».

The best matchups against a brood are heroes that can trade hits with her in lane and still come out on top. Some examples are :

- Dark Seer : ion shell, and natural soul ring carrier. He is definitely a top 3 counter to Brood.

- Legion Commander : less annoying than Dark Seer, but if she gets lucky with OO you are fucked, and of course there is Moment of Courage. You counter her the same way as with Axe, but since MoC regens her too, you have to be more careful. Manageable, but very annoying.

- Axe : high natural HP regen, builds into Tranquil Boots, Counter Helix. Annoying to play against, but it’s not the worst matchup : if you are against an Axe, always go on him without your army, while your spiders are clearing the jungle.

- Don’t max frost bite first on CM, its scaling is really poor IMHO

- You should have just run over their trilane. At level 1, frost bite + leech seed + spirit lance = ded hero, and their trilane is amazing… ly bad.

- Ursa got a late rosh, you probably let your guard down and thought he was not roshing when you saw that he did not take rosh before 10 minutes. I also do this sometimes. Keep track of an Ursa and try to snag his roshes.

- Detection is better than any item when you play support

- When you have all their towers down, carry smokes and ward near their base. Your « thought flow chart » is pretty simple at this point : Do you see them in their base ? If yes, keep starving them and get the next rosh for a high ground push. If not, they are probably smoked, so ambush them on a high ground if possible, or smoke yourself. You can also get a lot of pickoffs (Axe is good for this) if you have good wards and then push high ground.

QoP needs stifling dagger’s mana cost to go up (110 to 120/125/130/135 or something like that). Gyro is fine, he is just picked a lot because he goes well with the meta.

And if you play carry correctly, you will be flamed for not joining too many fights. Don’t worry, they are wrong. Mute, focus, win the game single-handedly, enjoy your 600 average GPM.

Coordination is a good bonus, but not a must by any means. Don’t expect your team to communicate. They will fuck up your combos so much it will look like it’s on purpose. They will make you lose games. Keep your morale up, keep your focus, keep your GPM up, keep split pushing.

Oh, and my most important advice : **PUSH**. Don’t look for kills, look for towers. Kills give you a very volatile advantage while towers give you a static advantage that’s easy to exploit. You should in general have at the very least 4k tower damage at the end if you play carries.

The first one was pretty satisfying. Originally, I planned to pick Gyro, but since I had last pick and I saw the enemy lineup, it screamed « PICK PL » to me. Thanks to Necro, we outplayed the enemies early on, getting kills left and right despite being against 3 or 4 enemies a lot (yeah, ranked before 2k is funny). I got a shadow blade at a decently bad timing (around 17 minutes), but to my defense I was pressured a lot. And then the fights turned into disasters for them. I died once because I fucked up, otherwise the PL pick proved to be really effective.

The third game was really satisfying. I was in a stack, and my captain second picked gyro after my advice. I had a really rocky start, as I was 1/2/1 after like 8 minutes. Then I noticed that my supports were very diligent with jungle stacks, I farmed them, and I proceeded to go 18/2/15. I got commended by the enemy team because I did well and I told them we would wait for someone who disconnected.

The second game was a bit weird. They had no jungler, even though they had ursa and ench. We crushed them in lane, but Mirana was really annoying. He told me that I should participate in every fight, etc. Well, sorry, but that’s not how carrying works, even with Gyro. I can join a lot of fights, but not all of them.

5366,"Since a lot of people have posted great advice here, let me just add a few tips :

- Get a quelling blade. In the radiant jungle, during the daytime, you can cut 2 trees as if you wanted to double pull, then aggro the big camp and run left while popping flak, and then flak 3 camps. In the dire jungle, you can farm 2 camps at once (or 1 lane + 1 camp).

- Early on, you are a big threat in lane. A little tip : barrage’s max range is just about the same as your attack range.

- My core early-game items : QB, Aquila, Phase, TP (important, you can fight a lot), Helm

- Some people like SnY, but I would rather go for a fast BKB in 90% of my games. Then I go for either MKB, Daedalus, Butterfly, or Satanic (if I really need to survive).

- Of course you use helm for ancient stacking. With QB, aquila, demon edge, phase, and BKB, you can clear 1 ancient camp in 1 flak rotation, even with 1 rock golem IIRC.

- My usual skill build is the standard 4-0-4-3 and leave homing missile until level 22.

- Don’t hesitate to use Barrage to melt creep waves. You can use call down, but it’s a bit more demanding for your mana.

- When you chase someone under tower, if you have flak shots left, you can hit the tower for a guaranteed auto attack on them

- You are pretty squishy, so mind it. Dance around fights a bit, you are a really fast hero (315 base MS + phase boots makes you really fast, and SnY makes you a racecar on top of it) so you can do it.

Here is an example of a game that was quite action packed : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1675767574

You are welcome :)

I have seen some players go Shadow Blade on gyro, but I’m not a fan of it at all. It’s 3k gold for something that will give you a lot of mana issues and the active is more or less wasted. It makes sense sometimes, but I prefer building him as a carry, so I go aquila-phase-hotd-quelling blade-BKB- and then MKB (very often, but not always) or daedalus (if they have no natural evasion or butterfly carrier) or butterfly (if they have no MKB holder or if they have someone like WD) or satanic into divine (if I really need damage, and I need to stay in the front line for a long time).

SB does not go with my playstyle at all because I don’t roam with Gyro, I just build him as a carry and I farm a lot. I suppose it could be good on a semi-carry gyro (with something like Phase-Bottle-SB and then you set up fights with your ulti+missile). I did not try this much, but it worked the 2 or 3 times I did it because my backup carry did a lot of work later on. I almost never get Treads, I would rather get Phase. Sometimes, when I’m ahead, I delay BKB, but not often.

5407,"Your question is complicated because it depends mostly on your hero. I will cover the heroes you played in the matches you linked.

- **Jugg** : Given your skill build, I assume you wanted to be very active early on. In this kind of situation, getting 300 last hits at 50 minutes is pretty decent, if not very good. However, if you want to play the 6.83 farming jugg (which is not very good in 6.84 IMHO), the most efficient skill build is 1-1-1-1 at level 6, and then 1-1-4-2 at level 11. Instead of Vlad’s, you get MoM, and then you get manta + stat items. Oh, and Aquila+QB are godsends.

- **Morph** : 37-2 on Morph is impressive ! I don’t play morph much, but what you could try is steal the enemy jungle since you have a lot of escapes. You do the same with Slark : sit in the enemy jungle and farm it, and when an enemy shows up you kill him.

- **PA** : I’m surprised you didn’t have more last hits. It’s very easy to farm about 10 CS/minute as PA if you have battlefury. Use Phantom Strike very often to secure farm is my best tip there. If your lane is hard, stay back, get Treads ASAP and farm with dagger from a distance.

- **Spectre** : Spectre’s farming ability is trash before getting radiance. I actually tried a build that aimed at helping Spectre farming the jungle before Radiance, for example [in this game](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1666016617) (well, it was a stomp, so not a very good example). I get 1-4-1-1 and then stats+ulti, and I get aquila+casual morbid+QB+phase before radiance. Some players like MoM, but it’s risky and I’m not confident enough to try it. In spite going for a lot of small items, your radiance comes out at a decent timing (around 25 minutes, before it’s great and after you are a bit in trouble) because you don’t interrupt your farm. I found out that you interrupted your farm a lot as Spectre when you went for a radiance rush.

- **Gyro** : I played a Gyro game last night, in which I made shit decisions but I was decently efficient I think : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1668444782

If you want to download the replay, I used a couple of tricks with quelling blade to farm multiple camps at once. Gyro is a flash farmer, so you should be able to reach 8 CS/min pretty easily, if you do it correctly. Early on, after Aquila+phase+HotD, if you are on Dire you can pull your creeps to the hard camps and then tank the enemy creep wave in order to flak the hard camp + the enemy wave (I did not do it in my game but it’s the same technique as with Slark). Stack with the dominated creep, and use flak cannon when it’s possible (except when a fight is about to start &gt;&lt; silly me)

And for your other questions :

&gt; How could I increase my GPM and get my core items faster? And is my GPM ok?

Your games seemed like really « low economy » : everyone had low last hits but there were a lot of kills. So it’s fine going in with the flow of the game. I think your GPM is OK in these cases if it’s above 500, since you have carries that farm well.

&gt; What are some basics tips on farming? Where should I farm?

Hit creeps so that you create pressure, especially if you have escapes (you like Morphling a lot, it’s a good example of this). Try to take the dangerous farm, your supports absolutely can not cross the river alone so it’s great for them if you leave the safe farm. But don’t be too cocky if you play someone like Gyro who has no escape.

But really, it’s not about having 600 GPM. It’s about winning. Sometimes, your team just refuses to believe that creeps exist and that there are times to farm, so you have to take a few fights even if you are someone like Anti-Mage.",2015-07-29 10:13:52+00:00,ctk3g6q,1.0,t3_3f02f5,10984.0,learndota2

5435,"&gt; and support is basically jungle?

A support is a support. Some supports jungle (like Enigma, or Enchantress), that’s all.

&gt; thanks alot can you give me some **heroes** form other roles?

Honestly, don’t worry about the roles when you start playing. The mistake I did was to try to support from the beginning − but I knew what supports did, I did not know *why* they did it, so I ended up somewhat clueless in low level games. I did not learn quickly because of this.

Pick a hero that’s versatile, like Abaddon, Windranger, Mirana, or Venge. Get about 100 games under your belt with them. Go to whatever lane you want, get whatever items you like. Then at the end of each game, ask yourself how you could have made better decisions : « Was maxing the stun first the right idea ? With Slardar, we had a lot of -armor and that would have been huge to max wave first », « I could have pushed here, they had a couple of heroes dead », etc. Once you think you have « figured out » a hero, start picking other guys, learn them, rinse and repeat.

For your other questions :

&gt; can i have a good site with **hero** build?

A good reference is the standard builds made by TorteDeLini. They are up-to-date and really good to begin. They are accessible in game. You just need to click on the little book on the top right corner (just beside the golden arrow), and then select the « 6.84 standard &lt;some hero&gt; (&lt;some lane/some role&gt;) build » (so for example « 6.84 standard Vengeful spirit (support) build »)

&gt; can you guys explain a little about the roles..(in lol im main support)so what do i do here as a support and can you give me some support for starters..

Roles don’t matter at low levels. That being said, usually you have 3 cores and 2 supports. You are going to lane 2-1-2 a lot early on, ideally with a core and a support. At low levels, it means that in side lanes, you will have someone who gets very little farm and someone who will get nothing.

If you really want to support right away, I would recommend Vengeful Spirit, Lich (here is a guide that’s a bit old but still applicable : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq3jFmi-my8 and a gameplay guide commentated : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY2EdFOVArw&amp;list=PL24EB71B773DFB306&amp;index=57), Crystal Maiden, or Lina.

5436,"Terrorblade is really hard to win with, but he is still a likeable hero to play IMO. I feel like such a hero when I win with Terrorblade.

On top of what others said, don’t listen to your teammates when they ask you to come to fights. Terrorblade is horrible in teamfights because in meta you are slow as hell, reflection = ayy lmao, and sunder can have a decent impact but your illusions die in a sneeze from the enemy supports. 90% of the time, you should be pushing elsewhere. The only strength of Terrorblade is that he is really good at pushing. As such the only kills you should get are kills on enemies that tried to defend and forgot that Sunder existed.

Don’t bother taking any point in refraction. Get conjure image maxed first, get meta maxed too (mix the 2 points between them as you feel, if you just used meta and you got a level it’s better to go for conjure image). Get sunder when you need, I usually take it at levels 9/about 13-14/about 19. Otherwise take stats. Stats are incredible on TB. 

Also, conjure image should **always** be on cooldown. Once you get to level 12-ish, you should have enough mana regen to sustain it.",2015-07-27 08:42:49+00:00,cthknvc,1.0,t3_3eo7e0,57917.0,learndota2

5438,"&gt; Do not pick heroes like IO or enigma that require team coordination to be useful. If you are picking supports, pick heroes that can impact the game. Like WD, lion etc. 

I agree on Io, but not on Enigma. Enigma is very good at pushing early on because a 9 min mek means 1 or 2 free towers. Later on you keep on farming (in my last 6 enigma games, I’ve ended with the top last hits by quite a big margin, eidolons are too good), you get blink/aghs/bkb/refresher/bots, you win the game because either you make the enemy team scared of a black hole and you isolate them, or you get a tobi black hole.

And enigma is a very good late game support.

&gt; Make sure you take objectives like towers and roshan. People forget that this is the way to win eventually. 

That is very, very true. People say that TB/Lone Druid suck and they are right, but at low MMR you can win decently often with them because they push/rat so well.

5439,"&gt; He initiates on me, I kill him, but he still gets me killed. How can I stop Huskar from suicide killing me as mid?

Early on, he has a low armor, so the moment he looks like he will dunk you, edict and then fog him. But Huskar is a bad matchup for lesh in general, you are expected to lose this one if you don’t have support rotations in the mid lane. That being said if you get the kill first it’s a good trade for you, because you gain XP and he does not. So I would say just ask your supports (WD in this case ?) to help you out.

For your items, I think you should have gone for BKB + Ghost/Eblade + hex + refresher and maybe even a halberd. If he gets an aghs or a BKB you are still in a world of pain, but at least you have some answers. The upside is that Bloodseeker is really good vs Huskar because he prevents him from farming effectively (if you farm at low HP as Huskar, which in general you should do, you give BS a lot of damage and MS).

I also don’t understand why this WR built a shadow blade. Seriously, why the hell do you need a shadow blade when you already have a free repositioning tool as your 3rd skill ?

5452,"&gt; If your team wants to team fight, it doesn't matter how good or smart you think you are, you need to fight with them, otherwise it will be 4v5 and they will lose the fight and the game. After winning the fight then push towers. The way 2k works is that at some point during the 40m whoever wins the fight in 60s can push raxs, so try to maximise that. The exception to this rule is when you're an exceptionally good split pusher and you can take towers or force tp backs. If you're not a super pusher hero, then split pushing is costing your team the game. Also, if you have no vision and they are not dead, pushing is stupid. You want to get ganks, not push.

I completely disagree on this. Just because there are many people who are wrong, doesn’t mean they are right.

It’s like saying : if someone makes a really dumb initiation, instead of running, you have to fight with him, otherwise it will be 1v5 and they lose the fight and the game.

A bad fight is a bad fight, whether or not you are there. And pushing when you know you won’t get killed for this is always a good idea. For example, if you play AM, and you have Manta, but their only form of CC is an Orchid, split push as much as you can. Even if you play a pretty bad split pusher, this rule still applies. You push when you **can**, you fight when you **have to**.

And how are you supposed to get ganks if you don’t have vision ? Pushing, as opposed to ganking, is not a gamble. The towers do not move, they always give a static bounty, they give your team a lot more map control, and they don’t respawn. At any stage of the game, I would rather have 1 tower than 2 kills (unless I end a big streak).",2015-07-24 15:11:55+00:00,ctemspk,2.0,t1_ctedkup,23825.0,learndota2

5468,"&gt; My avarage 150-200 in 50 min if everything is good in the lane.

It’s not enough. Not enough at all. You should have about 400 last hits at that time, especially if you had a good lane.

So let’s jump on your first issue : the lanes where you are 1v3 because your abaddon suddenly decides to start believing that he will carry harder than an AM. It has happened to me a couple times. Of course, if you ask them to stop stealing your farm, they won’t compel, so you have got to take a few factors in consideration :

- Do you have the biggest damage output between the 4 lane opponents ? If that’s not the case, it will be tough to get last hits if you don’t get a quelling blade (on melee heroes + gyro + medusa, these are the best carriers for a QB), an aquila, phase boots, or anything that gives you damage really. Try to use mindgames and animation canceling to get last hits and make your « ally » miss. If you have the highest damage output, try to last hit as soon as you can. In particular, try to last hit either just before a ranged creep hit or just after. 
You can also nuke the wave to get last hits.

- Your second problem that you don’t mention but is apparent from your post and your answers : **you just stop farming in the mid game !** That’s a really big issue. Going from 50 CS in 10 minutes to 200 in 50 is NOT farming, that’s accidentally taking last hits while you are fucking around. Sorry to be so harsh, but it’s not a good habit to have.

In every game of dota, no matter the hero, no matter which team is ahead, you should apply this rule : **pounce on free kills, push when you can, fight when you have to, farm the rest of the time**. You may notice that : 

1) Pushing in more important than fighting, and that’s for obvious reasons. Pushing directly helps you to win the game, and pushing is by far the easiest and safest way to win.

2) You should be doing stuff. All the time.

Now if you apply these principles, you should go from 150-200 CS in 50 minutes to about 300 on an average carry (someone that has at least 1 decent farming skill). Now how can you improve your efficiency, in order to go from 300 in 50 minutes to 400 in 50 minutes or even to [950 in 68 minutes](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1614815024) ? Here is how I think of it :

- Think of your mana and your HP as a resource. Mana transfers directly into gold on heroes like Lesh, or SF. It transfers indirectly into gold on heroes like AM

- Your skills that help you farm should ideally always be on cooldown. Always. In particular with Anti-Mage, you should be blinking around all the time once you have treads+battlefury. Remember that a skill which is off cooldown does nothing for you. It just sits there, when it could be used to give you more gold.

Examples of heroes where this concept applies : Gyrocopter (Flak cannon), AM (Blink), Clinkz (Death Pact can be considered as a lesser midas), Meepo (BoTs + Poof), SF (Raze), QoP (Scream and agh’s sonic wave), Slark (Dark Pact).

- Never go back to base if you can help it. Going back to base is a big loss in terms of efficiency.

- Always try to hit the most creeps with your nukes. An obvious example is Gyro, when you can pretty often hit 2 jungle camps at the same time, or lane creeps + camps. QoP is another example.

5469,"It’s actually not very hard to do. On carries, my CS/minute varies, mostly depending on the hero. On Lone Druid I have usually about 5-6 CS/min on average (like in this game : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1642521714). On Tiny, I get usually about 8-9 CS/min, and on AM if I have a decent game about 10-11 CS/min. Your CS/minute should increase with the game length because more gold = more mobility + more damage = more CS.

Here is an extreme example, showing how much your CS can skyrocket the longer the game goes : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1614815024

The biggest thing to do when you play carry is to remember this rule : you pounce on free kills, you push when you can, you fight when you have to, and you farm at any other time.

5483,"So I’m not a great Lone Druid player, but I win a lot with him, so here is my advice for him :

Before your game

- Go watch Bulldog’s guide

- Practice a bit last hitting by hitting simultaneously with the bear and the druid, it makes last hitting so much easier

In game :

First step : make sure you have a few heroes that help you deathball in the mid game. A few good examples of this are Witch Doctor, Undying, Winter Wyvern, Shadow Shaman, Death Prophet, Dragon Knight. You can play Lone Druid without such heroes, it just makes your game a bit easier to play with this kind of heroes because you don’t have to be the only tower damage in your team.

Try to pick him when the enemy team does not have mobility at all OR when they rely on blinks on supports. Typically, your radiance will come at the same time as their blink so you can really fuck up their initiation.

And the most important part if you suck and play in normal skill like me : **tell your team that you take the safe lane and farm there, and that you will NOT jungle** (or the mid lane if you are confident in your mid skills, which I’m not). I’ve seen sometimes an ally Lycan come into my lane because « you know you are the jungler right ? ». Luckily, if your ally wants to contest your farm, you should be able to out-CS him very easily.

Items : on the safe lane, I go for tango-salve-2 branches-quelling. On the mid lane, I replace the quelling blade with a stout shield. Either way I put stout/quelling on the bear. Then you want to have : brown boots-oov-quelling-stout on your bear, tranquils on you. From this point you rush radiance. After radiance you go pipe, and if at this point the game has not ended, good luck, you are in for a tough ride. You can get Agh’s and rat to victory, glimmer cape, basher/AC/Moonshard/BKB for your bear. These are the common items. But you really should end the game before about 35 minutes as LD.

Gameplay : Dominate your lane. If the enemies rotate, start to push the tower, from level 5 onwards you can really whack into them. As soon as you get radiance, destroy every enemy outer tower, even if you lose a bear for a tower it’s a good trade if you can resummon it. If your push is centered around long cooldowns (ravage, exorcism…), farm until they are up and then go push again. Then get rosh. By this time you should have pipe for your bear, and then if you have a healthy bear+resummon you can take a T3.

In fights, position your hero in a safe zone and your bear in the middle of a fight. Treat your hero like an Io that always sticks on the same ally (your bear). Only attack with your hero if you see an enemy obviously out of position. Don’t be afraid to lose 1 bear if you can resummon it, but be careful afterwards.

Here are my Lone Druid games for reference : http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?date=&amp;hero=lone-druid&amp;skill_bracket=&amp;lobby_type=&amp;game_mode=&amp;region=&amp;faction=&amp;duration=&amp;timezone=Etc%2FUTC

5488,"&gt; Laning is pretty simple. Send one meepo to go stack hard camp and have the other cs in lane. Then when you want to clear stacks either have your support take the lane or just shove it with double poof. Then just farm up your boot of choice (usually treads or travels, although I prefer treads because I just like tread switching), then aghs, then blink.

Somebody suggested bottle and I like it so far, on top of BoTs. What’s your opinion on it ?

And that’s pretty much what I do in lane, especially if I’m mid.

&gt; The easiest way to play meepo and win games is probably just to rice your aghs + blink, then just go slay people with your blink. People don't play against the hero enough to know how to play against it generally.

- If I’m upset at my teammates, I don’t say anything. I mute everyone, I mute myself, I focus and I fight until the bitter end. I laugh at mistakes.

[Example](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1647783088) (I was on a stack, they spent the whole game bashing me and criticizing my decisions, so in the end I just muted everybody)

- If I’m not upset and I have good team coordination, I try to coordinate my team to get back. If I support, smokes are great for setting up fights that you can win. And every good thing that happens is pointed out. « They didn’t take our T3 and we got a 2 for 2, pretty good ». As a core, I try to stall as much as I can and start thinking along the lines of « I need to play perfectly now, or I lose » which is decently effective for me.

That’s an extreme situation, and if that happens you have probably lost, BF or not. Not having a battlefury at 12 minutes is actually common though, especially in a 2v2 lane.

&gt; You're saying that a team from behind, that virtually lost at least some of map control will be able to get a 27 minute BF Vlads Yasha?

I completely agree about AM being played wrong a lot of the time, and the fact that manta offers a lot more utility. However, IMHO the primary characteristic of AM is his ability to skyrocket in farm and split push very well with a BF and you lose this if you go manta first. What’s the point of having a 22 minute manta when you could have a 27 minute BF+vlads+yasha ? Also OP asks how to play AM, so that’s a good place to teach him the good habits when playing AM in order for him not to be a burden that only farms his jungle.

I don’t play WK much, but Abaddon is one of my favorite heroes. People always go wrong when they talk about countering him. Lion, Axe and Lina don’t do shit against him (well, Lina has a few arguments, but not many).

You know how you counter an abaddon ? You kill his whole team in front of his eyes while he wonders why he didn’t pick dazzle. Then you force borrowed time and you kill him too. If you don’t have burst, you can disable him and focus on his team (orchid is great against him if he does not have eul’s).

In your particular case :

- As others said, get diffusal on WR after aghs.

- Get necronomicon on NP. It’s semi-core usually on him, but this game it’s pretty much needed. For the mana burn and the split push potential as I will talk about.

- Split push. Split push. **SPLIT PUSH**. You had NP, and they had very little control. Abaddon is awful against split push because he has no stun and no counterpush apart from shield which is very subpar.

- Get your slark to get some items like drums. Don’t build a shadow blade on him in this kind of game, you can not pick off anyone but CM on their team and it’s not worth it.

- Get earthshaker to combo their CM every time you can, you need to burst her down and it’s a free teamfight victory

- Kite them, they have 3 melee heroes. Shackleshot, pounce, oracle’s skills and Sprout are great for this.

Absolutely, he is a wonderful support. I play him a bit and it’s my preferred role with him (I just can’t make core silencer work out :(). The thing with Silencer is : many people give him too much respect so they run when 1 glaive hit them.

I prefer skipping curse altogether when playing silencer too. Not only is it more effective for damage than leveling it up (you don’t hit like a wet tissue), but also because people are not used to playing against a silencer that skips it so you can get a lot of kills on targets that did not expect to be hit with a level 4 last word.

For items, my favorite choices are Tranquils or Treads, then Force staff, then atos, then hex or refresher.

Thanks again for your analysis ! This game, I was witch doctor as a safe lane support, and we were stacked with everyone but veno.

He bitched about not being able to do anything, but I had no other choice than to stay with void IMHO so I left him in the offlane. It pretty much went downhill ever since. Pudge had quite a bit of good hooks, and we could not get our combo to work well because the fights always started 4v5. They fountain dived us at the end just to rub it in even more.

5579,"Let me recommend you my 4th most played hero and my favorite support : the only true knight of the apocalypse, Abaddon ! (yep, screw you Nessaj)

Great hero to train your fight awareness, very fun to play, very baller, and this guy is a commend factory. It’s definitely not an every-game pickup, but playing well abaddon is a bit like playing well Huskar : you get a free win 1/10 games.

Here is a copy-paste of my last informative post about abaddon :

&amp;nbsp;

I recommend playing him as a hard support in a dual lane.

First step : make sure your allies pick around your abaddon, and try to pick him against heavy disables. Heroes I **wouldn’t** pick Abaddon against are :

- Ursa (IMHO one of the best abaddon counters)

- Phantom Assassin

- Phantom Lancer (not a hard counter per say, but really annoying)

- Anti-Mage

- Clinkz

- Any burst-heavy, low-disable hero is pretty good against an Abaddon (and unluckily, these heroes are popular in pubs).

Heroes that I would 100% pick abaddon **with** are :

- Weaver (one of the best allies for an abaddon)

- Veno

- Gyro

- Centaur

- Any lane partner if you think you will be either really defensive or really agressive. As opposed to a popular belief, Abaddon can be a huge bully in lane and he has quite a bit of kill potential early.

If you get an ally to pick a weaver for you, lane with him and make him skip linken’s.

Starting items/Laning : Courier, 2 wards, Tango, Salve, 1 clarity or 2 (2 clarities are a bit more defensive). Upgrade the courier around 3 min, get a TP pretty early, get tranquils+urn as soon as you can. These are your core items 90% of the time. If you reckon you can bully someone out of lane, go ahead and don’t hesitate to take a value point in curse. No one expects an Abaddon diving at level 2, yet it’s really effective sometimes. If you have to be defensive, play like an omniknight : pull and stay out of vision.

Skill build : As Abaddon, you have a pretty versatile skill build. I max heal first very often, but maxing shield is also OK sometimes. If you can get agressive, take a value point in curse and don’t skill it again at least until level 12. At level 1, keep your skill point, a level 1 curse can help securing a first blood. If you don’t see any opportunity for a first blood, shield is your best bet in general (unless you are on dire and you want to chain pull right away). Here are a couple of my go-to skill builds :

General skill build (agressive variation) : 23111412224 and then either max curse or take stats, taking ulti at 16

General skill build (defensive variation) : 211214122(3/Stats)4 and then either max curse or take stats, taking ulti at 16

Ultra-defensive skill build (for when the enemy lane just screams « FUCK YOU ») : 212124211(3/Stats)4 and either stats or curse + ulti at 16

Item bulid : your core is tranquil boots, stick, **TP scroll**, Wards, and either urn, soul ring, or more rarely medallion. You really need only 1 or 2 sage’s mask based item(s) and you are good to go. Your skills don’t cost that much mana.

Afterwards, every item is situational. Here are my favorites :

- Force staff : to save allies after shield

- Blink : against someone like Bat, to disable lasso right away

- Aghs : makes your whole team tanky as hell

- Vlad’s : if you have melee cores, this scales quite well into the late game

- Mek : viable option on Abaddon **if you get a soul ring**. Don’t get a mek if you don’t have a soul ring, your mana won’t be able to support shield/heal spam + mek in a fight.

- Glimmer cape : pretty self-explanatory (it’s a bit mana-intensive now, so mind it)

- Eul’s : moar mana regen, a disable and a way to deal with those pesky silences.

Luxury items :

- Hex : Just an overall great item on supports, especially if you have blink

- Refresher : 2 ultis, 2 hexes…

- AC : if for some reason your team does not have one and it’s very late.

- Basher/Abyssal : you buy it mostly for the abyssal, but it can be good in very specific situations. Also pairs well with refresher.

- Shiva’s : For AoE control mostly.

- Necronomicon : to help pushing a bit faster, and also because necro warriors benefit from curse

- Pipe of insight : you carry a pipe quite decently.

Rejected items :

- Radiance : just don’t. It’s not worth it for the gold, every other item in the game is going to offer you more for the gold.

- Mask of madness : I never play abaddon as a carry, I find it to be an absolute heresy.

- Skadi/SnY : Same reason as above.

Playstyle in the mid game :

Keep your buddy alive. Stay in the area around the guy you want to save the most, farm a bit with your shield. In fights, it’s pretty simple : spam shield, heal, and urn charges on your allies to extend it, and when your team is retreating and you have ulti up, run in. Try not to get disabled, a disable on you might mean a wasted Borrowed Time and you don’t want it to happen. Smart teams will just chain eul/hex/stun/silence you and then beat on your allies.

Late game : same thing. You are one of the best supports to be poor on in the late game because you have a free second life, which makes you a good aura carrier. If the enemy team commits too much on you and you survive, your team can easily clean up. Keep shileding, and be especially mindful of the enemy hexes.

**Tips and Tricks** :

- You can cancel your attack animation to curse someone and still have tranquils active

- You can chain pull by healnuking a creep from afar, it makes double pulling on Dire a piece of cake

- Always use heal before shield to save someone, heal has a better cast range

- Keep your eye out on your other lanes. Abaddon is a great counter ganker.

- Don’t pick abaddon first. He is really situational. That being said, don’t be afraid of Lina/Lion/Axe, who have the reputation to be good abaddon counters but they do shit if you know that you can trigger your ulti manually.

- Don’t get caught out of position, even with Borrowed time. Borrowed time is a spell that has a ton of potential, don’t waste it.

- Mind the enemy eul’s scepters

- Your shield does not dispel things like Viper Strike, Ice blast, Poison nova (you are still pretty good vs veno though), Burning Spears, Enfeeble, Rupture, Demonic purge (BTW agh’s shadow demon counters abaddon very well), and a few others.

- Curse is a great value point, don’t max it before shield and heal. The most important part of curse is the MS bonus, which does not scale at all. That’s why you see me sometimes ignoring curse past 1.

5591,"Blink dagger is neat for BH. It allows you to escape when you are dusted, stay farther away from fights, and in general altering your positionning.

Anyway I love my lil’ roaming BH. I play him as a hard 5. He is great as a roamer, because of his invis and Jinada+Oov+Shuriken to get kills.

What I do is : if the enemy team picked a jungling hero (ideal situation), I go into his jungle and either try to kill him when he is low (if it’s axe/legion/lycan/you get the drill), or leech XP. Meanwhile I check the enemy mid’s items. If he rushes bottle really hard (like no items at all - never do that btw, it’s awful), I go to the mid lane invis as soon as I can. If he spent all his gold, I get there between 2 minutes and 2:30 in. I try to gank either the mid lane (which is surprisingly easy because of Jinada slow + Oov) or the enemy safe lane if it’s weaker than our offlane. If they don’t have a jungler, I don’t play around their jungle and just focus on a courier snipe + ganking their weakest lane.

Items : I like tranquils, bottle, urn, medallion (not all of them, just select between them deepending on the game). Afterwards, I keep buying all the wards and I get usually a dagon. Otherwise, you can get a blink, an atos, or utility items.

In fights : pretty simple. I stay far and spam track, and when everyone is tracked I shuriken. When the enemy team spreads out, I step out of invis and hit with jinada+shadow walk.",2015-07-16 08:45:43+00:00,ct5601c,1.0,t3_3df8lh,44587.0,learndota2

5608,"For the general advices, /u/machocat has given them.

I will give you specific advices on Tiny, since it’s a hero I feel like I’m decent with and I had [a game where I got quite a bad lane](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1614584816) (I was mid vs Sniper) but recovered.

Essentially, as Tiny you should have either Bottle or Soul Ring and use Ava/Toss to farm. Use tread swap in the jungle (don’t bother to do it in fights, it might mess you up like it did in my game) : keep it on agi most of the time, and when you are about to cast your combo switch to int and then back to agi. You may wonder why I advise agi treads on a strength hero, that’s because he is Tiny and he does not need damage, just AS and armor. That’s the first step to recovery : using your nukes to flash farm (you can also clean up creep waves with it).

The second step comes with your item choice : do you want agh’s or Shadow Blade/Blink ? Agh’s first is my preferred choice since I like hitting creeps and towers. But Shadow blade [is also viable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0mH2BYrVs). If you choose agh’s, make sure you hit towers often, be it with your team or without it. If you choose SB/Blink, you can get really easy pickoffs with your combo (be careful with whom you toss though).

A really important thing to note if you need to farm to recover : *you need to stay on the move*. Do not just keep farming your jungle (unless you are sure that : 1- this is your only place to farm, 2- you are safe here (warded jungle, etc.)). This is not only applied to Tiny. Watch your minimap carefully, and try to predict where they move and where they ward. You should never, for any reason, stay under an enemy ward. Unless you are fighting there. Hit creep waves, hit towers, hit jungle camps, solo rosh if you have a hero that does it. Once you start forcing the enemy team to react to you, it should be a lot easier.",2015-07-15 10:01:29+00:00,ct3zraj,1.0,t3_3dcn6i,15055.0,learndota2

5683,"I recommend playing him as a hard support in a dual lane.

First step : make sure your allies pick around your abaddon, and try to pick him against heavy disables. Heroes I **wouldn’t** pick Abaddon against are :

- Ursa (IMHO one of the best abaddon counters)

- Phantom Assassin

- Phantom Lancer (not a hard counter per say, but really annoying)

- Anti-Mage

- Clinkz

- Any burst-heavy, low-disable hero is pretty good against an Abaddon (and unluckily, these heroes are popular in pubs).

Heroes that I would 100% pick abaddon **with** are :

- Weaver (one of the best allies for an abaddon)

- Veno

- Gyro

- Centaur

- Any lane partner if you think you will be either really defensive or really agressive. As opposed to a popular belief, Abaddon can be a huge bully in lane and he has quite a bit of kill potential early.

If you get an ally to pick a weaver for you, lane with him and make him skip linken’s.

Starting items/Laning : Courier, 2 wards, Tango, Salve, 1 clarity or 2 (2 clarities are a bit more defensive). Upgrade the courier around 3 min, get a TP pretty early, get tranquils+urn as soon as you can. These are your core items 90% of the time. If you reckon you can bully someone out of lane, go ahead and don’t hesitate to take a value point in curse. No one expects an Abaddon diving at level 2, yet it’s really effective sometimes. If you have to be defensive, play like an omniknight : pull and stay out of vision.

Skill build : As Abaddon, you have a pretty versatile skill build. I max heal first very often, but maxing shield is also OK sometimes. If you can get agressive, take a value point in curse and don’t skill it again at least until level 12. At level 1, keep your skill point, a level 1 curse can help securing a first blood. If you don’t see any opportunity for a first blood, shield is your best bet in general (unless you are on dire and you want to chain pull right away). Here are a couple of my go-to skill builds :

General skill build (agressive variation) : 23111412224 and then either max curse or take stats, taking ulti at 16

General skill build (defensive variation) : 211214122(3/Stats)4 and then either max curse or take stats, taking ulti at 16

Ultra-defensive skill build (for when the enemy lane just screams « FUCK YOU ») : 212124211(3/Stats)4 and either stats or curse + ulti at 16

Item bulid : your core is tranquil boots, stick, **TP scroll**, Wards, and either urn, soul ring, or more rarely medallion. You really need only 1 or 2 sage’s mask based item(s) and you are good to go. Your skills don’t cost that much mana.

Afterwards, every item is situational. Here are my favorites :

- Force staff : to save allies after shield

- Blink : against someone like Bat, to disable lasso right away

- Aghs : makes your whole team tanky as hell

- Vlad’s : if you have melee cores, this scales quite well into the late game

- Mek : viable option on Abaddon **if you get a soul ring**. Don’t get a mek if you don’t have a soul ring, your mana won’t be able to support shield/heal spam + mek in a fight.

- Glimmer cape : pretty self-explanatory (it’s a bit mana-intensive now, so mind it)

- Eul’s : moar mana regen, a disable and a way to deal with those pesky silences.

Luxury items :

- Hex : Just an overall great item on supports, especially if you have blink

- Refresher : 2 ultis, 2 hexes…

- AC : if for some reason your team does not have one and it’s very late.

- Basher/Abyssal : you buy it mostly for the abyssal, but it can be good in very specific situations. Also pairs well with refresher.

- Shiva’s : For AoE control mostly.

- Necronomicon : to help pushing a bit faster, and also because necro warriors benefit from curse

- Pipe of insight : you carry a pipe quite decently.

Rejected items :

- Radiance : just don’t. It’s not worth it for the gold, every other item in the game is going to offer you more for the gold.

- Mask of madness : I never play abaddon as a carry, I find it to be an absolute heresy.

- Skadi/SnY : Same reason as above.

Playstyle in the mid game :

Keep your buddy alive. Stay in the area around the guy you want to save the most, farm a bit with your shield. In fights, it’s pretty simple : spam shield, heal, and urn charges on your allies to extend it, and when your team is retreating and you have ulti up, run in. Try not to get disabled, a disable on you might mean a wasted Borrowed Time and you don’t want it to happen. Smart teams will just chain eul/hex/stun/silence you and then beat on your allies.

Late game : same thing. You are one of the best supports to be poor on in the late game because you have a free second life, which makes you a good aura carrier. If the enemy team commits too much on you and you survive, your team can easily clean up. Keep shileding, and be especially mindful of the enemy hexes.

**Tips and Tricks** :

- You can cancel your attack animation to curse someone and still have tranquils active

- Always use heal before shield to save someone, heal has a better cast range

- Keep your eye out on your other lanes. Abaddon is a great counter ganker.

- Don’t pick abaddon first. He is really situational. That being said, don’t be afraid of Lina/Lion/Axe, who have the reputation to be good abaddon counters but they do shit if you know that you can trigger your ulti manually.

- Don’t get caught out of position, even with Borrowed time. Borrowed time is a spell that has a ton of potential, don’t waste it.

- Mind the enemy eul’s scepters

- Your shield does not dispel things like Viper Strike, Ice blast, Poison nova (you are still pretty good vs veno though), Burning Spears, Enfeeble, Rupture, Demonic purge (BTW agh’s shadow demon counters abaddon very well), and a few others.

- Curse is a great value point, don’t max it before shield and heal. The most important part of curse is the MS bonus, which does not scale at all. That’s why you see me sometimes ignoring curse past 1.

5695,"You apply pressure in a lot of ways as a carry :

- Split push sidelane towers

- Cut waves to prevent enemies from pushing

- Stay on the move so that the enemy team has to waste a lot of time to gank you

- If you have someone with a great escape like AM or an illusion farmer like Naga and Terrorblade, farming the enemy jungle or dangerous areas on the map in general

You want to force the enemy team to play around you. I will take AM as an example since he is probably the most canonic hero for this concept. Once you have Battlefury, you clear waves and the jungle like a madman, you get vlad’s and Manta really early because you hit a lot of creeps. As you are farming (with or without these 2 items), you auto attack enemy creep waves so you naturally push. This creates space for you and your team (for example, if you are on Radiant and you push the enemy offlane T2, you can then retreat to their ancients to farm them, then retreat through rosh). You force them to use TPs and to be in unconvenient positions especially when they 5 man, because they have to take a bad trade : either they stop your push which means they will naturally stay on the defensive (that’s like Chess : if you react to an enemy plan instead of playing to yours, you are naturally on the defensive and most likely to lose, or not win anytime soon) and they just slightly hinder your farm, or they don’t stop you at all and you have at the very least an even tower trade, but in turn you farmed a lot more than they did.

So in short, force the enemy team to play around you instead of playing around the enemy team. Stealing their farm from their jungle also helps a lot, because it makes a huge net difference if you do this a few times.

5699,"&gt; However, all my team agreed that the fault that we lost that match was mine, what is your opinion? Can someone download the match and give me some advice?

Yeah, of course, QoP went 8-16 and had Vlad’s, Lion had a mek/dagon instead of a hex, Clinkz had no hex either and you had 10× as much tower damage as them but the loss was your fault. Kappa.

So it looks like you did pretty well. [I had an AM game that went roughly the same way](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1614815024) yesterday actually. I think we lost this because I had heart instead of BKB so I ate all their disables and got bursted down quite quickly. That being said, just from your post and the stats :

&gt; One of the mistakes i think i did was to not to push in the mid game and part of the late game when i have more advantage against my enemies. I also often forgot to use my objects like the abyssal blade stun.

You don’t want to go super late as an AM, that’s true. The abyssal part will come with experience (for me, I always use Space for abyssal on AM and a mouse button for Manta so my combo is natural to use).

&gt; I also want to ask you if it was better to use in this game a pipe or a BKB. BKB give you magic immunity for some seconds but pipe makes AM a whopping 80% magic resistant and we were against a team who makes almost 100% of his damage magic damage. They just take so long to melt my HP bar with pipe than i just went in and out the battle with blink and heal myself with HoT. BKB didn't make me that durable.

I think the better choice here was refresher for you, and mass hexes for your team. Refresher on a BKB/Abyssal carrier is huge, because you can stun for 4s through magic immunity and have virtually a 10s BKB. Mass hexes are pretty self explanatory, you had to lock down storm (and to a lesser extent gyro). Even though it looks like they had predicted the mass hexes (just seeing the Linken’s on both Storm and Tinker).

But you should definitely aim for a 40ish minute win on AM. That’s his peak, he starts falling off afterwards.",2015-07-08 11:31:32+00:00,csw2kw4,1.0,t3_3cj8bz,6150.0,learndota2

The NS game was me carrying my team with the help of Empower. NS was in my 10 hero challenge, so I thought I would play him anyway. I had the offlane selected since 30 seconds, and there was 1 guy who thought it was a good idea to pick Void and go to the same lane as me. Eh. We were doing well (I used the first night time to gank the mid silencer twice), but Ursa soloed roshan and we kited him but still could not kill him at all. At some point, they had a huge lead and I was the only one on par with the enemy team (I had a big streak too, which was pretty stressful). Then I started to play pretty much at the best of my ability. Ursa abandoned at some point, which was the first saving grace. I was tired of my team dubiously pushing without anyone dead on the enemy team, so I started to lead them. « Magnus, Empower me ! » « Don’t push here ! » etc. Luckily, the enemy team was dumb enough to engage in fights even though Darkness was up, and i could dance around fights and pick their Lesh and Silencer off. At least when void did not chrono me…

At some point, my allies started actually contributing to our victory. I bought dust for them against the Shadow Blade of Leshrac, gave them directions, and used mostly pings for fights and objectives. We ended up winning. I all chatted « i’m uninstalling dota » at the end, since this game was satisfying and frustrating at the same time. 1 more death on me and it was definitely lost (add pasta with my salt please).

The other game was my first win as Enigma. I was becoming desperate with the hero (my previous Enigma game had my team go 0-8 in the time it got me to get level 6, boots and SR, and overall I had never won as Enigma…). I was stacked with the Naga, and he decided to go for Naga just to get the combo with Song and Black Hole.

My jungling started with heavy misplays on my part, until about 1:15 when I finally start doing correct things. I had level 6 just before 6 minutes. I ganked the safe lane with Black Hole and got a double kill (they killed Naga in return though). Then I went back to the jungle for a moment, and because of the double I had blink+mek at around 13 minutes. We were able to push down the T1 bot tower (for some reason no one else wanted to push on our team though o__o), then after a bit of jungling I went mid and got a good black hole, then took the tower. We kept on the streak and eventually our lead was unstoppable. I misplayed by not having a TP on me at the point when NP and Kunkka pushed together, but the game was already unloseable at this point.

Next in my 10 hero challenge : Timbersaw. I played him only once. Welp.",2015-07-07 14:53:51+00:00,csv09pd,1.0,t3_3cfd9b,2974.0,learndota2

- Your items are pretty good, although maybe a casual vit booster would have been great against all their burst (glimmer cape + vit booster = a lot of HP), or an aghs scepter.

- Don’t put more than 1 point into Decay at least until level 10. Its manacost gets a lot higher and you are only getting a 1s cooldown reduction + a bit of additional damage.

- Max tombstone first, 95% of the time. Soul Rip is useful later (you can take 2 points into it if you want, but not many more), but tomb is godly early on.

- Crimson would have been also a good choice in this game against PL

I didn't do great when I played him, but that's probably just from lack of experience. When his ult is up, get used to running into damage, rather than away from it. You can tank a lot of what the other team has to throw at your team because it will actually heal you. This essentially makes any fight 6v5. In my experience he's a greedier support (unlike Dazzle), and should be played as a 4th position for sure, and take any opportunities you get for farm.

For me, his main weakness is that he is countered by a lot of « classic pubstompers » : Riki, Ursa, PA and a lot of others. And he is not greedy at all, if you get urn+tranquils+medallion/euls/soul ring you are pretty much set. Having blink/force/pipe/vlads is nice and all but you don’t need it.

5724,"Here is my dotabuff : http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906

First thing : Don’t pick Io. Io is *really, really hard to play well*, and he needs teammates that can play well around him (that’s not very easy either).

Supports that work well for me at low MMR are Silencer, Disruptor, Dazzle, Omniknight, and Witch Doctor (and I would count Undy, since I play him in a very supportive fashion). I did not include Abaddon because he really needs specific allies and enemies to work IMHO.

Here is how my games go :

- **Picking** : I hover over supports and most of the time in ranked, I 3rd pick or so a support on my list. I try to have a good laning combo and to work well against the enemy team. For example, if I have a Razor or a strong laning carry in general, I know I can afford to pick Omni. If I know the enemy team is really weak to silences, I pick either Disruptor or Silencer, if I know they are not really stacked on disables I pick Witch Doctor, etc.

- **Laning** : I pretty much always go to the safe lane, and with these starting items : courier, 2 wards, 2 clarities, Tango, Salve. If I have a weak laning hero like Omni, I make sure never to show up in lane (unless it’s for a heal on my carry) and pull non-stop (and also, I still see this mistake : NEVER SINGLE PULL UNLESS YOU WANT TO PUSH). My carry is level 6 at like 6 minutes, while the lane opponents are level 4 or something. From now on, it’s quite easy. If I have a good game, I get boots and flying courier (flying courier at 3 mins, boots at 4-7 minutes depending on how well I’m doing).

- **Past 10 minutes or so** : I always keep 2 TPs. At this point, I’m usually level 5 or 6 (unless I’m awfully far behind, in which case I try to recover by farming empty lanes). I try to get good fights or pickoffs with my ulti. For example, in the case of disruptor, I try to get a glimpse-field-storm combo on any enemy (your hero has really low cooldowns, take advantage of that !), or if I have omni I encourage my allies to dive like they were XBOCT’s long lost brother, then I turn it around.

- **Mid game** : I farm a bit, making sure wards are always up. At this point I play safe and I never cross the river without my allies unless I’m on a suicidal warding mission. In fights, I stick to the plan I made during the draft (example : wait for QoP to blink in, then Global Silence immediately). I always watch for my mana and my cooldowns. When we take a good fight, I try to get a push going with my team or a rosh.

- **Late game** : At this point, your biggest contribution is made by preventing your allies from going questionnably into enemy territory. Stay far back in fights and try not to die. Most of the heroes I play have long cast ranges so they allow for it. Keep fighting well and keep your allies alive. And never initiate first (unless you have Abaddon or something). Wait for the enemies to initiate, then counter.

So my way of playing supports is : farming like a 3/4, but warding like a 5. **Make the game as easy as possible for your allies**. It’s possible to climb by supporting, even if it’s quite hit-or-miss. But if you make the game easy, most of the time your idiots will win anyway.",2015-07-07 08:17:48+00:00,csus4fy,1.0,t3_3cbmqh,53468.0,learndota2

- **Pipe** : Same concept, but even better especially if the enemies have AoE.

- **Necronomicon** : Send your necro warriors in, destroy towers safely

Here are a few heroes that are really good at sieging and taking highground :

- **Lone Druid** : Great pipe carrier on the bear, great tower damage potential, and bear resummon. Probably the best sieger in the game.

5739,"&gt; Wouldn't worry too much, have a couple more games. He's a really enjoyable hero to play once you get the hang of him. He's not just about the Black Hole after all.

He seems quite great to play indeed. It’s quite frustrating to be 0/4 with him overall and to feel like you know the hero, but you just can’t do enough.

I will keep on trying though. I think my jungling route is getting to be pretty effective (I got a 6 min level 6 after being ganked twice in the jungle in one of my games, it does not seem that bad for my level).

&gt; In your games, it seems that your team made really bad decisions in draft. The Pudge quitting in your first game didn't help either. 

I was worried about the Drow pick and the dusa pick too :/ (and Shadow blade on Drow, well…)

5743,"In general, the golden rule is : actives don’t have separate cooldowns (for example, 2 eblades won’t allow you to ghost twice), passives either don’t stack or stack multiplicatively, and stats stack completely **except movespeed**.

Notable examples of items that stack well together :

- Battlefury : Cleave is one of the only attack modifiers that actually scales additively, which means 2 BFs = 70% cleave.

- Butterfly : Evasion stacks multiplicatively. Flutter doesn’t stack at all.

- Heart : Health regen does not stack, HP bonus does.

- Skadi : The slow does not stack, but the stats do

- Daedalus : multiple daedaloi have their crit chance stack multiplicatively.

- Every stat item, of course.

Examples of items that are often stacked :

- Ember spirit with Daedaloi and Battlefurys (for moar SoF damage)

- multiple skadis/eblades on Meepo (1 eblade = more DPS than a rapier for meepo if you have aghs and all clones attack the same target)

- Stacking wraith bands on drow (just for the stats)

And here are examples of items that don’t stack well together :

- SnY and Manta : Movespeed from 2 yasha-based items does not stack.

- Multiple boots together : kind of obvious, the movespeed does not stack.

- MKB : True Strike is the main benefit of it and it (obviously) does not stack with another MKB.

5769,"Doom is in my opinion the definition of a greedy hero. Very weak early on, but is built in to make it to the late game and one of the best late game heroes in the whole pool. He is quite fun to play in my opinion, even though he is kinda weak.

Playing him in the jungle is OK, however beware that you will not have a big impact early on, as Doom is a weak jungler. And beware enemies, especially if you are against Riki or BH (maybe BH a bit less because in low MMR, no one knows what the hero can accomplish by roaming and they play him like a carry). Another good option is the offlane. He can go to any lane, but I dislike mid and safe lane because other heroes can do it better.

The standard skill build is 12121412234333Stats4. You can of course vary around this build by taking a value point in Lvl? Death for a level 6 kill (if you do this, check your enemies’ levels very frequently !), you can max Scorched Earth by level 7 if you have a very hard lane in the offlane, etc.

For the items, in my opinion Doom needs this :

- Armor

- Aghanim’s Scepter (seriously, never skip it, it’s way too good)

- Mobility

- A bit of intelligence

So here is my usual item build :

Tranquils - Midas (optional) - Wand (often) - Blink - Aghs - Shivas/AC/BKB - Refresher

Here is the reasoning for every one of these items :

- **Blink** : Core. You need to initiate *before* your enemies, because if you doom someone after they blew their spells, it will massively reduce the impact of your doom. Moreover, you need to choose your doom targets.

- **Tranquils** : Core too. You don’t need any HP because you have a really high strength gain, however you need mobility and armor. Tranquils provide both, and allow you to sustain very well too. You don’t need phase boots unless you want to play a carry doom (which is not a very good option in my opinion). You don’t need Treads because it does not give anything that you need. It allows you to save a bit of mana but that’s it.

- **Wand** : Always good to have a bit of survivability, because you need to be in the center of fights and chase your doom target.

- **Aghs** : Probably the best aghs upgrade in the game along with Tiny’s. Get this every game.

- **Shivas** : Great option for doom because you have horrendous armor and it allows to chase your doom targets.

- **BKB** : Allows you to bypass your enemies and go to your doom target and give him a few more middle fingers with your sword before he inevitably dies.

- **AC** : If you want to right click enemies and transition into a carry.

Another point of Doom is choosing your target. It can change depending on the situation, but most of the time you want to doom the enemy carry, heroes with escapes like Slark/QoP, or heavy teamfighters that did not use their teamfight spell like Enigma or Tidehunter. And remember, you need to initiate *before* your opponents.

[This game](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1591664907) (safe lane AM) and [this game](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1591586802) (mid AM) are an example of why people say that the mid lane is the safest lane pre 2k. You just never get ganked, and you don’t have a support screwing you up in lane by trying to believe he should take the farm.

I have been forced to play carries by my friends a lot because that is my second least bad role after support (and my friends pretty much only play supports), and when I went back to supporting, [I felt like I was much better](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1588012497).

I try to support in ranked and I’m 1.6k, so I feel your pain. But if you manage to play really, really well as a support, and play something like Omni/WD/Warlock (because you need to scale in the late game, your carries are not going to lift anything past 40 minutes. Special mention to omni because in the trench, only PL, Naga and Riki are allowed to buy diffusal), you should be getting more wins than losses. You will have games ruined by asshats who fed intentionnaly or screwed up your lane on purpose (« Hey, Dusa ! I need a fast agh’s, so I’m not going to buy any ward and I will farm safe lane. »). But you will climb, the others won’t. **Never, ever complain openly about anything but you**, it reduces your chances of winning. I use push to talk to rant or to laugh off mic, and I lead my team with a mic.

It feels like the same logic as getting dagons on heroes. 'Don't get it unless you can get it early.' (I feel I should say I've not really used Doom much before)

I played with quite a bit of Radiance dooms, but it always seemed to me like it was an inferior version of Shiva’s guard. Doom lacks actual lockdown, armor, and a bit of mana, which Shiva’s provides.

Single target damage is the way to go against a Meepo. And Storm does not really get hit by any meepo because of his ulti.

5814,"&gt; Any criticism on my ability/item build? When should I level up what? I know shuriken is inefficient to level up after level 2, so do I leave it there? What about Shadow Walk? What items should I be buying? I went Phase -&gt; Urn -&gt; Desolator -&gt; Dagon -&gt; Linken's Sphere

Your skill build is pretty close to perfect. In general, I don’t put more than 1 point in Jinada until level 12, otherwise it’s good. Shuriken **used to** have a really weird scaling, which made level 2 very efficient in comparison to the others. Now it’s not the case anymore, so you should pretty much max it first (instead of something like a 2-1-2-1 at level 6 which was standard). For your items, Phase-urn is a good combination. You can also get brown boots-bottle-urn, tranquils-bottle-urn, phase-bottle… Bottle is quite great because you are quite mana intensive early on and you roam a lot. I would not have built linken’s here, PA has a really easy way to dispel it with Blink strike or Dagger and you don’t have anything to block with it. I would rather go BKB or ghost in your game. Also, I never pick up both dagon and deso, it’s not really worth it. Either you get deso/medallion and you wreck face with your auto attacks, or you get dagon+eblade and you nuke people down the moment you see them.

&gt; Why do I see people build Battle Fury on Bounty Hunter? I can't think of any feasible reason to other than hoping you get a group crit off on bunched up enemies, but there is no way I am believing that that is how the 5000 gold is best spent.

Because people don’t know how to play bounty hunter. You are right, Battlefury is game losing on him. I would much rather have a dagon 3 than a battlefury. I think it’s a relic from the old dota 1 days when not many items were there and BF on anything seemed legit (same thing as radiance doom/weaver/enigma).

I was very hesitant at the start because I knew I was up against a Zeus, and I got crushed in lane so I had to fall back into the jungle. I didn’t think about staying with high enough HP so Zeus got a couple of kills on me. After a really, really rough start, I finally got Wraith band/aquila/yasha/BoTs at 22 minutes. Yep, 22 minutes. Ouch. Skywrath called GG at this point.

Then I started to get the split push going. The enemies kept headbutting on our high ground while I casually munched all of their sidelanes T1 and T2 towers. I got 2 raxes while they were trying to push, by myself (one push got me the top raxes + T2 bot, another push later gave me the opportunity to take bot rax). Dude pushes quite fast.

After I got my first Skadi, we started winning fights when I showed up. When I got my second Skadi, they could not do anything. They were already 2 raxes down, we took the T1 mid (yep, it was still up at this time :D), the T2 mid, and then after 1 final fight where we won, I ate the last set of rax.

My opponents did not even call me names at the end, I’m disappointed.

- Lone Druid is kind of shit at the moment, but he can work in compositions where you want to have a big advantage in the midgame and you need a sieging carry

- Take mid or safe lane (I prefer safe laning, but mid is viable too)

- Lone Druid has 2 strengths : he is really good at laning especially in 1v1s, and he is really good at pushing. Abuse that by last hitting/denying everything, harassing with your bear, and pushing whenever enemies leave your lane

- There are a LOT of tips, tricks, and builds in Bulldog’s guide : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG9qqtdQwNY

Now for the rest of your post :

&gt; I start with him in the jungle. Yes, I know offlane is better (there's no such thing in 2.2k), or even in lane. The problem is that I am completely unable to do anything in lane. In the jungle I am usually in top of the levels and gold. I build midas fast, and then radiance fast. Jungle is the easiest way, so I cannot negotiate that, really.

You made me cry. Just practice hitting with your bear and your hero at the same time and then go either mid or safe lane (offlane is very risky and you should probably not do it). Radiance is great on the bear, but I don’t like midas at all because it delays your impact in the game and you are already worthless past 30 minutes.

&gt; I don't feed. But I am completelly irrelevant. My team plays like 5v4.

That’s normal, since you play Lone Druid in the jungle. By playing LD in the jungle, you are not abusing his strengths at all. If you want a jungling hero that’s passive, play Nature’s prophet or Doom. Both are by far better in the late game.

&gt; From that moment on, I am completely lost. I have no idea what to do, how to maneuver. In team fights they always target the druid, and kill me easy. When I try to be careful, the bear is out of range, and only radiance is not enough.

After you get radiance, you should get tranquils and pipe for your bear and then push non-stop. Pipe is really, really good on LD, because it’s a great base sieging item.

&gt; I use the simple 1 for druid, 2 for bear, 3 for both. I build almost everything for the bear. Usually the druid only has tranquil bots

Tranquils + BoTs ? Kappa

Seriously though, that’s a good idea. You don’t really need items on the druid, he is already tanky.

&gt; Can anyone provide me some basic tips to be useful? Some basic info to win a freaking game with LD? I even lost 1 game where we were 5v3.

3 words : push, push, push.

Lone Druid is disgustingly fast at pushing, and you don’t want the game to go late. Whack towers with your bear.

5852,"There are multiple reasons for this (AM players, correct me if you think I made a questionable point) :

- AM is an agi hero, with really low BAT (1.45), and a good agi gain

- Spell shield makes him tanky if he goes for items that give raw health

- Mana break makes him hit like a truck early on, in the mid game, and even in the late game it’s not bad at all

- AM does offer no utility, just damage with his spells and a bit of mana burning that only works if you can auto attack. And **AM offers nothing if he can not be close to the enemies for some time**.

He is definitely not the strongest carry in this patch, but he is pretty decent. 

Gameplay :

At level 1, generally take something like Tango-salve-stout. Hold your skill point until you either fight or see your opponent’s lane. If you see that there is no way you will die before level 2, skill mana break, otherwise skill blink. At level 6 you should have either 1-1-1-1 with 2 points in stats (usual build) or 1-1-0-1 with 3 points in stats if they have no magic damage. Get treads-roh-quelling blade ASAP, optionnaly PMS or ring of regen. Whenever you can, trade hits with the offlaner(s), you should almost always come out on top just because of mana break. After your small early game items, start pushing out the wave and farming jungle camps during your downtime. Go straight for battlefury, and try to have maxed blink (so 1-4-1-1 or 1-4-1-2) by the time you have BF. From this point, always keep TPs in your inventory and farm everywhere. Keep track of which lane will push when you auto attack camps in the jungle. If you see your opponents anywhere, push as hard as you can on the other side of the map. Join fights sometimes, but only if you think your presence is needed and you won’t die.

Second item after battlefury is vlads. With vlads you can stay at 100% health during jungling, and it helps in fights. Then go for a manta. Keep split pushing, use blink whenever it’s off cool down, and farm everywhere. Go for manta and try to have mana break maxed by the time you have it. If the enemy team does not have long stuns or silences to catch you, farm their jungle as well. When you have manta, you can solo rosh if you get a lucky DD/illusion rune (use m-click on rosh to tank with the illusions). Keep split pushing and start joining more fights (TP scrolls OP) when you have manta. From there, there are the items you will select from :

BKB - Butterfly - Basher/ablade - heart - BoTs (maybe I forgot a few of them).

In fights, always try to jump on the supports or the heroes with really high mana pools first. Prime examples of this are Tinker, Ogre (with an aghs, he depletes his mana really quickly), OD, Storm… Then check their mana and if it’s low, void them. If they have a silence, don’t use manta immediately, instead wait it out.

You should try to end a game by 40ish minutes as AM, otherwise the enemy carries will most likely outcarry you. Compared to a Gyro, AM can join a bit less early fights, but he split pushes faster and farms even faster.",2015-06-25 12:16:25+00:00,csi56nd,1.0,t3_3b29et,2372.0,learndota2

5874,"Gyrocopter is really fun to play, especially as a carry. His voice lines are great, the hero is pretty good, and he is not very hard to play well.

He is generally good in every stage of the game. Rocket barrage owns in lane, Flak harasses in lane and helps with farming, and Call Down is also great for mid game fights. Flak owns with damage items later.

I usually start with Tango-Salve-RoP-Circlet/Slippers. You can also skip the circlet or slippers and go straight basi or quelling blade. From there, build the following (usually) :

Phase boots, aquila, quelling blade, maybe bottle, TP (you can join a lot of fights early), HotD, BKB/SnY (I like getting Sange first)/Demon edge into MKB/maybe Euls (did not try it).

When you start to get your efficiency items (phase/aquila/morbid into helm), push out the lane with Barrage and clean camps with Flak, or even ulti if you have spare mana. Quell trees to flak 2 or 3 camps at the same time. Use flak every time it comes off CD, it’s 50 mana.

Skill build : You have 2 questions to answer : do you want barrage maxed first or flak, and do you want a point in missile ? My most common build is 131314133Stats4, then Stats+ulti, but you can get a 2-0-4-1 build at level 7, you can get a value point in missile at level 4 too.

As soon as you get Sange or BKB, you can join fights. At this point, with Barrage and Call down you hit like a truck full of trucks. Secure a few objectives with your team, and farm like a madman. Keep joining fights if you think it’s worth it, Gyro has really low cooldowns and a big teamfight presence so you can be even more active than someone like Luna.

Also, as soon as you have HotD, you can stack ancients with it. When you have a demon edge or phase-aquila-BKB-quelling, you take approximately 30s to kill a whole stack even with rock golems. After taking an objective, clean your whole jungle or your ancient stack.

For the late game, if you can not win without it, Gyro is one of the best divine carriers in the game. It is because you have flak cannon. Don’t be afraid to buy it if your team is quite far behind, sometimes it can be a game saver.",2015-06-24 12:37:17+00:00,csgz6xj,1.0,t3_3aw9cu,43564.0,learndota2

Specifics − I decided to pick up supporting again, with a bit of Earthshaker.

I felt like I could not do anything vs their offlane Ursa (always able to out-manfight an AM), neither vs their mid. 

Here are a few bad decisions that I made IMO :

- Not warding near roshan against Ursa

- Not stacking enough jungle camps, I should just have stacked hard camps and pulled non stop

- At some point, I got a bit greedy with wards and tried to get my blink ASAP.

- Here is the wiki page on the courier : http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Animal_Courier

The main thing here are the shortcuts. For me, I don’t play in Legacy and my shortcuts are QWERTY (I don’t use D nor F for the spells), and I select my courier with F4, so if I want to send the courier to the secret shop, I press F4-W and then just select my main hero again.

What part of the courier did you have trouble on ?

- For the items, do you have troubles choosing which items for which situation ? In that case, I would recommend to stick with the standard guides at the start. You can click on the tiny book on the very top left of your screen, and it will list the guides available for your hero. The standard ones are up-to-date and they are great for most of your situations. Then you will branch out a bit after a while (I had some games where I was like : « Their BH bought blink ? That sounds… surprisingly legit. I will try it. » and that’s how I experimented).

5943,"&gt; i noticed you don't really put a point into missile until late. And don't max it out until 23, 24, 25. Is this because there's not much gain between level 1-4 missile, what do you use missile for? Seems like an unused skill for me.

I don’t think it’s a bad skill, it’s just that it has so much delay on it that it’s not very worth it IMO. Especially considering that stats are so good on him (farming speed, etc). I get it if I plan on being active outside of ulti+barrage spamming in early fights, but there is almost no point in leveling it past 1 (the value point allows you to chase invis heroes, gives you about 1/3rd of the stun duration…).

&gt; should I use it when laning? I guess i see how it can be good at harassing, but on the other side, i didn't want to push out my lanes against a troll viper so i could tower hug if they got aggressive

That’s a good point. I use it from time to time to harass (or if say I’m soloing vs a Brood), but definitely not off cool down. I don’t really know about your specific situation though.

&gt; My farming is bad. I'll have to check out your replay once i get home. Just not used to a farming character.

Prepare to watch me dive into 4 enemies without backup :D

I made really questionable decisions here. If you really want to watch it, focus mostly on the farming aspect. Expect on the very early last hits, I suck at last hitting with Gyro and other heroes with really fast animation but low damage (Sniper etc).

&gt; Question on MKB. Is that just for stats? I hear that Gyro is a standard MKB carrier, but in general is MKB more situational (against PA, WR, Riki)? This is a really stupid question...does the damage buff on MKB apply to rocket barrage (if yes, than i get it now). Would you consider this your first big item?

Do you mean MKB applies to flak ? If that’s what you meant, it does apply the true strike but not the mini bash. MKB is very good on Gyro (maybe not core, something like core extension). And the damage does apply to flak because of the way flak cannon works. It’s 1 auto attack for every enemy/neutral in the AoE instead of just 1 auto attack, so your damage is carried over on Flak cannon (not the item’s passives like crit or minibash though). That’s why rapier is so good on Gyro too.

In short, I get MKB as my first big item after BKB 90% of the time, not only against evasion heroes. Daedalus is also really good, even if the flak shots can not crit.

&gt; i hear Gyro is a farm heavy character, but also hear that he can fall off late (or at least isn't a hard late game carry like a void, naga, medusa, etc). Is this true, and if so, wouldn't it be better to go ganking in the mid-game rather than farm heavy? 

He kind of falls off in the late game because people just kite your BKB and flak. [You can go for a heavy ganking/mid game build like I did here](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1522271117) (again, with a lot of flukes in it). But you will start falling off very very quickly if your actual carry does not snowball (luckily my PA played very well here). I also dislike support gyro for this reason : you just do not have anything in the late game. No utility (you don’t have Shallow Grave, you don’t have instant initiation, you don’t have reliable CC…), no damage either because magic damage starts getting irrelevant late. You are meant to dish out a lot of damage with Flak later on, and you can not really do it if you did not farm enough.

I’m not saying that it’s impossible, it’s just a different way of playing and IMO it’s actually a bit riskier. You can leave a lot of farm to a gyro and still have him participating in a lot of fights very early. And don’t worry, if you have 600+ GPM, you will have a lot of impact even in the late game :D",2015-06-17 14:58:24+00:00,cs9lkaj,3.0,t1_cs9kl9y,1670.0,learndota2
5944,"Did you start on the safe lane ? Did you get position 1 farm ?

Edit : I can’t read. Here is my answer for your other questions :

&gt; I feel like i followed a pretty generic build for him, and had a pretty tough lane (bs was jungling so i was solo against troll and viper).

Your skill build looks very weird to me on the other hand (my go-to skill build is QEQEQRQEEStatsR then stats + ulti, maybe sometimes get 1 point into missile but not more). If you are laning against Viper, you are going to have a hard time, but you can manipulate creep aggro to get exactly 1 creep to go close to you, then use flak and last hit from a distance with flak.

If you are solo versus a dual lane, you can sometimes get a kill at level 6 with level 3 rocket barrage and ulti, because they won’t have ultis at this point.

&gt; i guess my question is how do i use the actives on the items (phase, bkb, aquila, and helm). Helm can dominate neutrals, am i just stacking with that? Am i using phase for rocket barrage? Always have aquila on?

- Phase is used because you want to get into people’s faces. Early on, you want to use barrage a lot (7s cooldown for such low mana cost and such high damage !), and later on, you want to get in their faces to a certain extent (your attack range is awful on gyro).

- BKB is used for the same reason as phase is. Another thing is that Gyro is actually quite squishy, especially to magic burst, so BKB is great on him.

- Aquila is used because it’s very cost efficient and allows you to spam flak on every cooldown without having to worry about anything.

- Helm is used for stacking ancients mostly, although you can do a lot of cool things with it. Stacking jungle camps can be sometimes more beneficial because you can use call down on them, but 90% of the time it’s better to stack ancients.

- An item you didn’t mention (but which is great on Gyro IMO) is Quelling Blade. It allows to flak down 2 or 3 camps at once, and amplifies every flak shot’s damage.

- Have aquila on as soon as you start rotating from lane to jungle. 
- A small tip : You were on the dire side, so what you can do as soon as you have Flak maxed is cut a tree between the hard camp and the top lane, aggro the camp, pop flak, then farm the camp + the lane. Flak’s range is huuuuge. Abuse it. You can also do it for the dire easy camp.

- Always use Flak to farm. Everytime it’s ready. Not using Flak off CD is like not using midas. The buff lasts 15 seconds, so you can pop it a bit preemptively. Which brings me to my next point.

- 179 last hits in 1 hour is very, very bad. Sorry to say it this way, but Gyro is a big flash farmer. [Even if your team loses, you should have about 8 CS/minute in 1 hour](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1557896838). Gyro relies on having a farming lead, so you have to be efficient.

- If you really, really want Shadow blade or Agh’s (I would not go for agh’s, it’s really inefficient for its cost), it’s acceptable to have fewer last hits, as it prompts a very active gyro playstyle. But even then, you should have at the very least 250 CS in 1 hour. Flak is a good spell. Standard items on Gyro are : MKB, SnY, Daedalus, AC (very situational, but looks good in the game you linked), Rapier (surprisingly less situational than you think. I should have gone for a rapier in the game I linked), Butterfly, Satanic.",2015-06-17 13:03:51+00:00,cs9hyhs,1.0,t3_3a5o1u,1246.0,learndota2

Silencer and Lina can transition into secondary carries (get aghs+shadow blade/blink+eul’s on Lina and you get a flashfarmer that can pick the enemy supports off, for example), Ogre turns into a bloodlust machine that also stuns every 6s, Witch Doctor just does more damage with agh’s, Shadow demon is a walking soul catcher/purge that also scouts, etc.

There are a lot of support heroes that scale well. You have to remember how you itemize too in order to do your job later on. And « doing your job », very often, does not mean deal damage. Force staff can be the best late game item for a support if you are facing an ursa, for example.

Edit : copying this for visibility :

&gt; First of all, learn to last hit. Even if you play support, it's unexcusable to not know how to last hit well, many people say that it's actually more important to last hit well if you're playing a support.

As a support, you have to get the most out of everything. Missing 2-3 last hits in lane as AM is not as bad as missing a camp worth of pull lasthits as a support.",2015-06-16 09:24:21+00:00,cs871xo,1.0,t3_39zb5z,32290.0,learndota2
5958,"« The best supports are not the supports that never die. They are the supports who only die for good reasons. » - 7ckngMad

Your KDA does not matter as a support, if your deaths had a point. I got a game where I went 3/17 as Venge because I was against void-sky and I swapped out of chrono and flare my PA in every fight. We won, and I got praised.

Doing his job well is pretty much independant on KDA (except maybe on heroes like Venge who actually dies a lot more than others, and on something like abaddon who dies less)",2015-06-16 09:13:10+00:00,cs86wrv,1.0,t3_39zzbx,19382.0,learndota2
5959,"Well, if it comes to the point that they can just fuck around and still win, why would the other team not call GG ? I saw some dota matches where you could clearly see that one team had already lost and the other team refused to GG, and of course if you do that you are going to be fountain camped (see KuroKy’s quintuple rampage on PA).
