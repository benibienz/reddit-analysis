I just played [a game as TB](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/2657516419) where we won pretty handily because the enemy team didn’t understand how to use AM and Enigma. That being said, I was playing TB and I had 350 last hits in 44 minutes which is pretty shit all things considered. Looking back at this game, I thought I was not farming very efficiently even in the early game. Here is my self criticism on this game :

- I was using illusions + hero to farm camps instead of pushing out with illusions + farming camps with hero

- I was using manta, but sparsely

- I was not farming agressively enough even though our warding was not really agressive

- My positionning in fights was a bit iffy (but I’m mostly looking to improve on farming especially within the first 15-20 minutes)

- I was against Axe which is a pretty bad matchup, but I didn’t skill my illusions early enough to be able to go through my regen. My first item choice was also an Aquila, but it might have been a mistake on me. I’m not sure.

I know there are Terrorblade experts out there, so if you don’t mind can one of you watch the first 20-30 minutes of the replay to explain what I did wrong ?

I’m loving this Muscovy run I’m doing so far (all of their mechanics are pretty amazing, really). It’s 1560, I’m almost done with Westernization. I’m at 2 stability, and I really want to raise it to 3 (Time of Troubles yada yada) but I can’t because my people refuse westernization and it keeps my admin and diplo power in the negatives. I had a few questions, because I’m not sure about what I should do.

I’m supporting Sweden’s independance, allied with Livonian Order, annexing my Vassal Ryazan, and I have another vassal in Kazan. I also released golden horde as a vassal to feed them, I’m planning on expanding into the south whenever I can.

My tech groups are Influence, Religious and Innovative (for the -5% tech cost to not fall behind too much). I have a good ruler now (3/5/5 or something I think), but I also had bad rulers before like a 1/2/2 empress or multiple regency councils. Because of this and because I’m a noob, I formed Russia pretty late, in 1540 or so.

Now here are my questions :

- I’m hesitant with Diplomacy. I hope Sweden gets their independance so I can ally them because they won’t give a shit about my asian expansion. Poland annexed Lithuania, and they don’t like me at all. Denmark also rivaled me, so if Sweden doesn’t get their independance I’m fucked. And since I wanted to expand into Asia and Crimea, I won’t have good relationships with the Ottos either. What do I do ? Ally England ? I don’t want a coalition against me because I would expand into the south and east. I don’t want to expand into Lithuania either, just feeding Golden Horde lands from Crimea and then taking it will be enough for me.

- For next tech group, I was thinking of picking a military tech group (Quantity). Is it dumb ? I want to invest everything into NI for now to get the colonist though.

- Does westernization stack with the -15% and -5% tech costs from national ideas and innovation ideas respectively ? If that’s the case there is hope I can stand up to PLC’s armies.

I natively speak a latin language (« romance » language if you want to call it this way), but I also speak english (almost fluent) and german (can handle normal conversations no problem, but mistakes here and there, however terrible with technical words).

But back to the original topic − I want to learn Czech. The thing is, I don’t know when to start. I don’t want Czech to be confused with russian and I don’t want to hamper my ability on both languages by learning it too early, but at the same time I don’t know when « just early enough » is.

Lately I have seen a lot of threads about how to jungle certain heroes, and a good 2/3rds of the answers were basically « don’t jungle with anything that’s not Enigma, Chen or Ench, it’s bad lol »

This is really getting old. Yes, a long time ago, you lost a game because of a stupid player who jungled LC and then did nothing during the game. Do you really think he would have been any better on another hero if he had not jungled ? He most likely would not have done any better. And most importantly, stop redirecting every bit of hate towards junglers. Jungling heroes are the second most hated thing among this sub after shadow blades.

What you need to realise is :

- Jungling is most of the time uncontested in pubs

- Some junglers are very reliable heroes that can win with ease at low levels (something something Lycan/Enigma)

- You also make mistakes in lane, and if you are below 3k you do enough mistakes for lane compositions to not matter. Unless you are in an extreme cases like BH played as a farming core.

- You are not at a level where lane matchups matter (trust me, even at 3k I destroyed Tidehunters in a 1v1 lane as a melee hero, they refused to use Anchor Smash), if you are under 3k at least (can’t speak for higher brackets).

- Jungling can net you very easily 350+ GPM even on unconventional junglers like TB or Treant

- Complaining is not a good approach to learning. Yes, I had games where I was forced to solo support as a Visage because someone else thought it would be a good idea to jungle. And I moved the fuck on, trying to learn from this game. Telling someone that jungling is bad except on 3 heroes and then justifying it by saying what bad players do when they jungle is like telling someone to not play AM because bad players « rush » a naked battlefury without Treads and get it at 30 mins. Yes, it’s bad. And why do you advise not learning how to improve it ? Instead, you get others to have your shitty mindset.

- Really, stop complaining about others and improve yourself. These « advice » comments are basically a hidden « I lost games while I had a bad jungler in my team so I blamed him ». **Blaming is useless when you want to learn**.

Ironically, the ones complaining about junglers in my games also tend to have the highest deaths and the lowest impact, no matter their position.

When I was young, something really bothered me in the gen 1 and 2 pokémon games. In gen 1, Brock had 2 low level pokémon when you encountered him. Yet, when you went to Kanto in gen 2, Brock was freaking stacked. Level 50+ pokémon, including Kabutops and more. It was not the only example of that either. How come Viridian City’s gym had a shitload of level 60+ pokémon in gen 1, and yet Brock’s gym (which is beside Viridian City) had such shitty pokémon ?

The common explanation for this is that gym leaders had to adapt their pokémon. If they saw someone who was clearly new, they used a set of pretty weak pokémon to battle against him, making it fairer for him and more enjoyable to watch. If they saw someone with multiple badges, they took stronger teams. Etc.

You are probably reading this thinking « Where the fuck is this guy going » but bear with me. This is what lead me to my suggestion.

My suggestion is the following : **Instead of having one single set of Pokémon for each Gym, make it adaptable**. I see 2 ways of implementing it.

- If you are facing a gym, compare trainer levels and multiply the pokémon’s HP/CP by a factor that depends on it. For example, if you are level 6 but you face a level 15 trainer, you would get an advantage from this bonus. It would not be overwhelming (the level 15 trainer would still have higher chances of winning by quite some margin) but it would be a little help. On the same vein, it would make low level trainers actually valueable for gym defense.

- Make it so that each gym has different sets of pokémon for different trainer levels. For example, instead of having 3 pokémon with level 25+ trainers, it could have 3 pokémon from level 5-10 trainers, 3 from level 10-15 trainers, etc. This would probably be very demanding for the servers, though.

We heard a lot of (justified) complaints about botters, spoofers, etc. ruining games. I believe this would also partially solve this issue.

I started playing Pokémon GO this week-end (yeah, I’m still playing even with this update, fuck me right). I had a few questions for you since I wanted to make sure of some things before I make mistakes :

- I’ve been told to not evolve anything until at least level 10, except maybe one or 2 pidgeys. The reasoning behind it was that evolving a 100 CP Rattata takes as many candies as evolving a 10 CP Rattata. Thoughts ?

- Same thing for incense : I’ve heard that using incens before reaching a decent level was not a good idea simply because you would attract very low CP pokémon that would end up being useless.

- Stupid question : How to join a team (Valor, Mystic, Instinct) ? I don’t have any atm. (I kind of want to join Instinct simply because it would give me more gyms to clear through since they are a minority).

You probably have heard this advice a million times to improve : « Watch your own replay and see your mistakes. » Yet, it’s sometimes hard to notice mistakes, especially the most impactful ones, by looking at your replays from your own perspective. On the other hand, helping people learn the game is a great way of understanding it better yourself.

Hence the idea of this post. Every top level comment must contain either a match ID, a dotabuff link, or a yasp link, asking for a replay analysis on this specific game. But here is the important caveat : **for each replay you post, you need to analyze another one**. There is, of course, no MMR restriction on anything.

Go ahead, post, analyze and comment. If this one is successful I could run it every week or every second week, depending on what you think.

I had a few thoughts about CK recently after a few threads I read on him. The general consensus is that CK farms slowly, even though he is great when 6-slotted. His damage is great but his AS is slow.

I had thought of a build to help remedy this issue a little, while keeping CK’s fighting potential. The build would be :

Starting items -&gt; Boots -&gt; Helm OR Vanguard -&gt; Infused Raindrops OR Basi -&gt; QB -&gt; Treads -&gt; Armlet -&gt; Basher if you have Vanguard, Drums/SnY if you have Helm. Situational items include Heart, MKB, BKB, Manta…

There are many ideas behind this build :

- The most obvious interaction is that Vanguard now works on illusions. The new Ablade, in theory, should be better than it has ever been on CK : The stun is a great followup to Chaos Bolt or a way to lock someone down to beat him down with you and your army. CK doesn’t care that much about the reduced damage because most of his damage comes from his illusions. And it makes Heart less needed later on (although Heart still is great on CK), because it’s more survivability.

- The idea behind building Helm or VG before Treads is that you can bully anyone out of lane solo with either of these items. Treads comes in handy when you want to do jungle rotations since you love the +25 AS.

- I think that in the most praised CK builds, Armlet is built too soon in general. Don’t get me wrong, Armlet is excellent on CK, and we all know that it’s the most cost-efficient fighting item for him. **However**, from my experience getting Armlet too early actually hurts you. Armlet is not a very good farming item if you are not playing Huskar, simply because it will get you low way faster than neutrals. With Treads-Armlet, you will have to go back to base often. Having Helm or Vanguard remedies this issue by letting you farm the jungle with Armlet on while regening, or even regain HP in the jungle between fights when you don’t have phantasm.

After seeing MuShi and RTZ play Kunkka at Manilla, and after seeing !Attacker play him a little bit, I had a few thoughts on the hero, which raised some questions.

First of all, I often saw this debate of maxing X before torrent vs maxing torrent before X. There were also a lot of core Kunkkas maxing tidebringer first. Sometimes it’s obvious what you should max first - for example if you have an Axe that will initiate for you, torrent maxed first is the obvious choice. But otherwise, I was wondering.

In terms of item builds, we always see this Phase -&gt; Armlet build and I think it’s very effective (+65 damage with armlet, couplet with tidebringer, is sweet). But what about midas ? On paper Kunkka loves to be level 14 as soon as he can, and the attack speed could actually increase his farming speed quite a lot. Kunkka’s agi gain is atrocious, and he builds no attack speed items. While you don’t need AS for tidebringer, I definitely believe +30 attack speed doesn’t go to waste.

This would also be a viable option on a support Kunkka, IMHO, just because it’s a fast way to gain levels on a hero who is not necessarily very good at farming, even if you do something like Tranquils + SR to spam torrents on creep waves and creep camps.

I wanted to try out new stuff in unranked yesterday, and I tried playing Nature’s Prophet. Originally wanted to offlane him, but since I had a Slardar I told him to offlane instead and went to the jungle. Anyway, we had a good lead early on, which we threw (partially due to Dusa being braindead with her itemization, but whatever…).

Our invoker was not bad at all, in fact he kept us in the game for some time IMHO. I was having a good game early on, but then I died a couple times.

What could I have done better ? Off the top of my head :

- BKB came out very late which would have been OK if I was more focused on taking objectives rather than teamfighting

- Agressive TP locations got me killed (the enemy team was putting a lot of effort into baiting me to TP in then kill me, for example when I tried to get a quick kill on Venge)

- Agh’s came out too late for it to be useful

- Orchid was in hindsight maybe not good. I mean it forced them to stick together but I didn’t really get to use it that much.

Thanks in advance.

I made it to level 81 with my Osa, and I plan on doing a few Vampyro dungeons to level up and get my next set as soon as I get to level 82 (level limit for the dungeon). I have a Lunar set, btw. That being said, a few possibilities are opened to me atm (or will be very soon, I’m pretty sure) and I had questions about that :

- Regarding experience, I feel like I’m kind of in a bad spot level-wise to level up. I have not had any good summon since the Crab (level 64), so he is getting relatively less and less tanky. I don’t know if having a bat from Katrepat (the island with Ghouls and Vampyro, not sure about the english name) will change a lot, as it seems that this summon is best for tanking instead of dealing damage. Regardless, are there more efficient routes than Katrepat then alternate between Vampyro and PvE on the island ?

- Speaking of which, I heard a lot of stuff about Jellies and Bilbyza : apparently, they allow to level up really quickly, and Jellies can drop fragments of Gelano (correct me if I’m wrong). At which level do you unlock these (both for Bilbyza and Jellies) ?

- I’m theoretically above the level limit for an Excarnus run (level 80 required). At which level can you reasonably do it with a 2 or 3-man party with sidekicks ? Do you still have the once per week limit on him ?

- And when is the next nice invocation on an osa ? The crab is lovely and all, but it seems like void until level 100 or so with Jellies…

I used to play Dofus a (very) long time ago, and at that time I was fond of Eniripsa. I also liked Feca and Osamodas, albeit a bit less. However, the main thing turning me down a bit was farming. It was a lot tougher to farm on an Eniripsa solo because you didn’t really have anything to accelerate farming speed : your best damaging spell was single target, and most of the class’ power was its healing prowesses. I was playing a Fire-oriented Eni, not a water-oriented one (so Vampiric word was weaker).

- I decided to start off slowly and I have an unincarnated now (not sure about the english name, it’s basically classless I think ?). When should I go down from Incarnam ? And will I choose my class at that moment ?

- I would love to play something like an Eniripsa or a Feca as a first class, but these (from what I remember at least) are not that good at farming (at least not until you unlock the most powerful glyphs for Feca). I don’t want to get stuck because I can’t farm, and at worst I can always create a second character on these classes. Do you have any tips on which class I should choose ?

- How did the job system change ? What I was used to was 3 jobs max that you could level up to 30/100 (free/paying) and you could either gather (by being a peasant, for example) or transform (by being a baker for example). You gained recipes and all that every 10th level.

- And lastly… Are there any noob friendly guilds out there ? I’m pretty sure I’m on Arafal (will check once I get back home). I would love to have advice and I heard that a guild gave you bonuses.

CM has the potential to be the best mode in existence : 2 bans at the start, ability to strategise, 2 supports, no dumb lineups with AFK jungles, etc. Players there are generally less prone to flame as well.

However, there is always that complaint : « Why does the guy who is most likely to pick stupid shit and not communicate at all, or the flamer, get as much chance to be captain as someone with a brain ? » It doesn’t make much sense to me that the guy who will be captain is the guy with the fastest loading in dota.

Here is my suggestion to improve it : a voting system.

- **You can not vote for yourself**. You can, however, decide to refuse to vote but it can go wrong for you if you do.

- You have 50 seconds to choose the captain, and if 2 players are equal in number of votes, here is what can happen :

1. If one of them didn’t vote, the other is selected

2. Otherwise a second round is organized. In this case the 2 equal players can not vote, only their teammates choose.

Here is how I would do it :

- Instead of the « Become captain » button, you have a button to vote for each of your teammates. Instead of your button, for you, there is « Do not vote ».

- No one can see whom the others voted for.

- In case of a second round, all buttons but 2 (for the 2 players with equal votes) are greyed out. You can not decide to avoid voting on second round.

- In case each player gets exactly one vote, another round is started but you have to make a different choice for each player (your previous selection is greyed out).

- In case each player gets exactly one vote twice, a random player is selected to be captain.

Note that for parties it doesn’t make much of a difference :

- Parties of 5 choose their captain beforehand anyway

- Parties of 4 are not allowed in ranked anyway

- Parties of 3 get at most 2 votes for a single player, which can be evened out.

- Parties of 2 get at most 1 vote per player and they don’t have any more power than 2 solos since they can not vote for the same guy in their party.

This suggestion would serve these purposes :

- Encourage communication

- Make the game more fun by adding a sort of « minigame » at the start instead of a dumb who-clicks-first

- Avoid stupid stuff like captains being reported for being outdrafted. If you chose your captain, it’s also your fault, you should have stepped up and become captain yourself.

Visage is my third most played hero, and I play him a lot in Drow Visage lineups. I’m seeing a lot of bad drows lately, which motivated me to do this post. Anyway, here is a quick guide on Drow+Visage (with tips for Visage in there too)

**Why Drow Visage and When ?**

You want to pick this combo ideally when the enemy team doesn’t have elusive heroes. You can play this combo anytime normally but in pubs, since you will lock in 2 of your heroes your team might go full retard and pick 3 heroes without lockdown be careful if you face the likes of Weaver, PL, Storm, Huskar, Phoenix and the classic antibird heroes (Medusa, Undying, and a bit Gyro or Ember). Also avoid Treant because fuck treant, makes the whole enemy team immune to birds. Visage works really well against heroes that can not deal with his birds like Pudge (very good hero if you are tired of seeing pudge btw), Pugna (you can look for his ward with birds and kill it quickly), Crystal Maiden (NICE BASE ARMOR, ALMOST AS LOW AS MINE 4Head), Witch Doctor (easy to cancel his ult without BKB), Death Prophet (Exorcism doesn’t affect birds and you have high single target damage). He works with heroes that reduce armor like Venge or heroes that enable chasing, but in general what you need to look for is a position 5 support (that means not Enigma, for example). That’s the second most important asset you have to secure in your game : your team needs drow, and a support. You won’t buy a lot of wards as Visage, but you will give a lot of towergold to the other support and you will buy utility items.

And why this combo ? The idea is very simple but it has some complex implications and playing them requires finesse. The basic idea is that familiars get buffed by Drow aura **when it’s active**. Some numbers :

- Aura lasts 30 seconds, its cooldown is 100. Its uptime is pretty crazy considering how good it is.

- Drow’s aura gives 38% of its damage to birds. With level 3 marksmanship, that’s about 0.38×80 = 30,4 damage for free. That’s not counting levels you have or items that give agi. With a butterfly, a skadi, and level 3 ult, you give birds (80+ 30 + 25)×0.38 = 51 damage on birds. That may look small, but birds’ BAT is extremely low at 0.4s and they are can not be affected by stuff like Skadi or Phoenix’s spirits.

Fun facts : 

- ~~The bird’s attacks are **not** damage reduced on towers, unlike hero attacks !~~ Edit : Nope, they do hero type damage too

- Birds always get focused last by towers, after catapults !

**As Visage** :

If you are not stacked with your drow, tell him that he needs to be ready to use his aura when you call for it. You are the most important part of this combo. You need to play well your deathbird, which means :

- Make sure you pronounce your hero’s name the french way, so « Vizaj » and not « Visedge »

- Don’t feed your familiars

- Don’t ditch yourself, you need a quick level 6. Don’t rotate unless you have to (eg you are vs a brood)

- Zone in lane, grab an early point in Cloak if you really need it

- Don’t feed your familiars

- You need to know at the very least how to do your combos and have practiced them before.

- Don’t feed your familiars.

Get your starting items. Usually I get 1 clarity and a mango if I can, and I also love taking a casual ring of protection. It’s useful even if you don’t plan on going for arcanes, because 2 armor is a huge value investment on a 0 base armor hero. Take 2 wards but not the courier, let the other support take the courier. You can buy a few wards here and there in the mid game, but you are between a 3 and a 4 which means you play some sort of really greedy enigma-esque thing but you don’t have eidolons, instead you have familiars to help you farm and get kills and you get kills with ease. That’s the theme of the hero after all.

Once you get your level 6, you get your familiars. Call them whatever you want, I called them Adam and Ivan (the second always survives everything, he needs a russian name). Start pushing your safe lane tower. Use aura and secure a tower. Then farm the lane + jungle with drow and you, rotate to mid with birds when aura is up again, repeat. When all the outer towers are taken, take rosh and continue your deathball.

Item progression : 2 paths possible.

Mek Visage (my favourite) : Starting items -&gt; Boots -&gt; Headdress -&gt; Arcanes -&gt; Mek -&gt; Aghs -&gt; Crest/Greaves. Don’t finish mek before arcanes, you will need the mana. Soul Assumption has a 140 mana cost on a 4 second cooldown.

Mekless Visage : Starting items -&gt; Tranquils -&gt; Medallion -&gt; Aghs -&gt; Crest. Go for that if you have a Dark Seer or someone that’s going to finish mek early (don’t let the other support try to get a mek if he says he wants to, either you get mek or a core does it)

*Tips and Tricks* :

- Birds can scout rosh

- With precision aura activated, and just drow with lifesteal + you, you take rosh in about 15-25 seconds

- Be patient with stone form. Especially, don’t stone form with 7 damage charges unless you have to (example : enemy Gyro just popped flak).

- Don’t lose your cool if the game goes badly before your 6, the game has not begun yet

- Use familiars to rat and play them like a rat hero. Check enemy TPs, and send them before you if it’s unsafe to farm.

- If you are against Pudge and he hooks you, resummon straight away so he can not dismember. If he still ults, stomp one of your birds and wreck him with the other(s).

- If you are close to level 11, level 16, or agh’s, take farm until then and tell your team to wait.

**As Drow** :

You have *one* job, and that’s pressing E. Get your normal starting items, farm safe lane, let Visage zone for you and get a quick level 6. For obvious reasons, max aura first then get stats. As soon as you grab either MoM or HotD+Wraith Band+Aquila, rotate to the jungle and let Visage farm the safe lane. Most of the time, your boots of choice are Boots of Travel, although you can consider Treads.

Item progression : Starting items -&gt; Boots -&gt; 2 Wraith Bands -&gt; Aquila -&gt; Morbid -&gt; HotD/MoM -&gt; BoTs/yasha then BoTs/Treads then yasha -&gt; manta

Situationnal items for the later portions of the game : Dragon Lance into BKB+Bfly, Butterfly, Skadi, *Ethereal blade* (super underrated on Drow, it’s situationnal but really good in some games), Linken’s, Blink. If you want BKB go Dragon Lance first.

Do not build a fucking silver edge. 

As soon as your Visage gets his birds, watch him. Normally he should tell you when you need to use the aura, but that doesn’t mean you have to shut down your brain. Use your aura every time birds will hit a lot. Normally it’s for these situations :

- Roshan

- Tower taking (or rax)

- Teamfight

- Gank that’s unlikely to succeed and you absolutely need a bit of extra damage. Rare case but can happen.

Coordinate with the Visage around your aura and otherwise play your hero normally. With a drow/visage lineup, you essentially have an invicible mini drow that’s flying appearing potentially 30% of the time and you need to abuse that, but as Drow you don’t even need to be close to Visage to help him. If the whole enemy team is missing, you should take safe farm. Do NOT die. Dying on a carry is extremely bad, but on Drow in a drow visage lineup it’s also hurting your Visage who can not benefit from your aura while you are dead in case a fight breaks out. Don’t try to do too much, you are a Drow and your biggest contribution will come from Visage’s HD and TD scores at the end. Thanks to you, they will be stupidly high.

**Examples (I was playing the Visage in each game)** :

https://yasp.co/matches/2255315108/ (offlane duo this game, with a Drow)

Example of a bad situation to pick visage : https://yasp.co/matches/2258939078/ (Naga core + Storm + Brood on the enemy lineup… Not fun for a visage to handle.)

Basically, every time I was using Astral Spirit, I had either to :

- Click on him and reassign a control group (on EACH SUMMON)

- Control him by clicking only (please no)

- Not control him and leave him stationnary.

You probably remember me (or not) for the draft analysis on the Shanghai Major grand finals I did a week ago. I’m also a PL fan, and loved picking this hero. However, as we all know, PL got demolished by 6.85 and in my opinion he was the 3rd biggest loser of this patch behind Lesh and Storm (you could argue that he was tied with Techies as well). We know what happenend by that time : he lost around 6% (!!) winrate in pubs, his pickrate went straight down the Visage drain and pros tried him out in 6.85 but quickly realised that he was not very useful and stopped picking him.

**A few facts on PL :**

- At TI5 (6.84), PL was the 22nd most picked hero, with a total of 62 picks and a winrate of around 56%. To put this in perspective, heroes like DK (21st, 66 picks total), BH, Wisp and Winter Wyvern were all picked more than him. Source : http://www.dotabuff.com/esports/leagues/2733/heroes

I believe that his winrate is inflated at TI simply because of the fact that CDEC played a LOT of Phantom Lancer, however. I will show you why with the next stats.

- PL was picked 313 times in pro dota in 6.84, with a 50.8% winrate (159-154). As a comparison, the most picked hero of this patch was Gyro, with a 381-361 record (742 games, 51.3% winrate).

- PL was picked 148 times in pro dota in 6.85, with a 47.3% winrate (70-78). He also lost an average of 20 GPM, barely getting over 500 average GPM (for a position 1 hero !)

- PL was picked 74 times in pro dota in 6.86, with a 35-39 record (47.3% winrate). In terms of picks, he is under Nyx Assassin and Abaddon, both of which are extremely situationnal heroes. He had an average of 517 GPM, which is extremely low for such a small sample size again on a position 1 carry.

- In the Shanghai Major finals, he was played a total of 11 times. That is a draw with Nightstalker and Jugg, and it’s barely over Drow (10 picks), and Winter Wyvern (9 picks).

(These stats come from datdota)

Now, how about pubs ? Well, it’s even worse.

- At the moment, his highest winrate is in sub 2k with a 48.93% winrate. In &gt;5k pubs, he has a 45.73% winrate.

- Since the start of 6.85, his winrate has pretty much stagnated between 43% and 47%.

**Now, why did PL get nerfed so hard, you may ask ?** 

He got a minor agi gain nerf (from 3 to 2.6 per level) and a much bigger nerf on Doppelgänger’s cast point (from 0 to 0.1) in 6.85. That seems small on paper. However, there were a **huge** bunch of indirect nerfs to him :

- Buff to 5-man early on which PL is weak against and can not do well with either

- Nerfs to Gyrocopter, indirect nerfs to Slark and Medusa with the 5-man buff (these heroes have disadvantageous matchups vs PL, making him less worthwile indirectly)

- Heroes that have advantageous matchups vs PL got more or less unchanged (AM, Ember, Dark Seer…)

- Other heroes got buffed which makes him relatively weaker (most notable is Terrorblade)

- Nerf to diffusal blade on PL because he didn’t really need the CD reduction, but it made PL a LOT worse against heroes like CK or Warlock

- Buffs to Sven, which made the matchup going from even between Sven on PL to Sven-favored

- Buffs to PA, Disruptor, and other heroes that tend to naturally shit on him

- Addition of other sources of evasion. PL *hates* having to buy MKB, he is easily bottom 5 MKB carrying agi heroes in the game for me.

- In 6.86, nerfs to defensive supports which was also what PL lived for partially. PL was favored against the likes of Winter Wyvern, Dazzle, and Oracle, and he loved to have these on his team.

**PL’s state at the moment**

PL is the combination of a worse Slark and a worse Terrorblade, and somehow he is less worthwhile to pick than either of these heroes.

- He teamfights like a Slark with the way he reengages and disengages. However, a lot of supports that can deal with him are picked now (think Earth Spirit, Lion…) so he can not kill supports as easily as before. Also, the fact that defensive supports are picked a lot less and that he doesn’t have shadow dance to regen him make him a lot worse than Slark in 5-man engagements.

- He pushes like a Terrorblade without Metamorphosis

- His laning phase is pretty bad, because even though his starting stats are very high, he is a melee hero with just a very expensive single target nuke to farm in case the enemy team decides to shut down your safe lane (and it happens a lot in pubs atm). He is not as bad as Slark in lane, but he is worse than Terrorblade because he doesn’t have a high base HP regen and he can not last hit with his illusions.

- Split pushing is just a lot less valued now. There are a lot more situations in which you are forced to buy Power Treads, and in order for PL to be PL, he needs BoTs.

- He can not flash farm. Each of his skills give him slightly more farming speed which is nice, but it’s nowhere as efficient as what Conjure Image or Dark Pact allow you to do.

- He is also worse in the late game than Terrorblade because he doesn’t have Meta and he can not provide sustained damage when the enemy supports can just disengage from him with Force Staff and the enemy carries can 3-shot him.

**How to make him valueable again ?**

Basically, the problem with PL at the moment, for me, is that the only thing he does decently is split pushing. He needs to stay on top of a target to create illusions and very often you don’t get to hit people with him because 5-manning is done before he can get online. His illuisons are weak until he gets diffusal blade, and when he gets diffusal blade he is strong but he doesn’t peak as hard and as quickly as other carries can. He can not create pressure on the map by being offmap like Slark does. He can not melt towers like Terrorblade can. He can not even teamfight as well as Terrorblade, and Terrorblade is not even a good teamfighter.

Here are my suggestions to make him relevant again :

*Direct buffs* :

- The 0%/100% illusion from Doppelgänger now has the same proc chance on Juxtapose as the main hero

- The 0%/100% illusion from Doppelgänger now lasts 10 seconds instead of 8

- Spirit Lance’s mana cost reduced from 125/130/135/140 to 115

These buffs achieve a few things : by reducing the mana cost of Spirit Lance, PL gets to spam Spirit Lance slightly more in lane, if he gets shut down. He can also sustain more in mid-game fights and it makes it slightly less necessary for him to get Aquila, making builds like Drums+Morbid+BoTs+Diffusal more valueable. The buffs to Doppelgänger achieve a few things : they make Doppelgänger a lot better offensively, first and foremost (you see a lot of PLs holding on to this skill when they engage, and for a very good reason : it’s a lot better defensively ATM). That makes PL better but also harder to play. Second, the buff to the 0%/100% illusion also makes the skill better offensively. In particular, it allows PL to stick an illusion on a blink hero in the back much more reliably than before.

*Indirect buffs* :

- Diffusal Blade’s recipe cost decreased from 700 to 500

- Upgrading diffusal blade now adds 8 charges instead of resetting the counter to 8 (so if you buy it at 2 charges left, you will have 10)

- Diffusal blade 2’s purge slow duration increased from 4 seconds to 6 seconds

- Diffusal blade now adds 30/45 damage to summons and illusions on each auto attack. This also applies to illusions.

These changes would once again achieve a few things. First, a problem you encounter a lot in PL games is « When do I upgrade diffusal ? ». It’s a very tricky question : on one side, going from diffusal blade 1 to diffusal blade 2 gives probably the highest agi gained/gold spent value, and it doesn’t even take a slot. On the other hand, it wastes charges, which is a big deal, and it doesn’t give any HP. This would make upgrading the diffusal blade to level 2 early a lot more valueable : you would not waste any charge, the upgrade is cheaper, and you would be even better against a hero with illusions and summons. It makes PL’s peak stronger, basically. You would still have the issue of lacking HP if you upgrade straight away.

**Final thoughts** :

PL is a fun hero, but at the moment he is stuck in the same kind of spot as at times like TI4. He is just not worth getting because other heroes do his job better than him. With these buffs, we could see a resurgence of a very fun hero to play and to watch by giving him another niche. He would be a mid-game peaking carry with strong pickoff and disengage/reengage potential.

I was always really interested in the topic of drafting in Dota. It really feels like a strategy game to me, of a very unique kind. In particular this patch and this major, the games were pretty amazing and the stories too. Especially in these grand finals. We saw 2 of the best captains of the west facing off against each other and I think the drafting phase really deserves a deep analysis.

I’m by no means a pro, I’m a scrub who likes dota and contributes to this sub somewhat regularly and plays Visage in pubs whenever I can. That’s it. Keep it in mind : I will probably say dumb things, so feel free to correct me.

Let’s set off.

**General things about the draft**

First of all, a very big thing that’s not mentionned anywhere in /u/D2TournamentThreads posts is coin tosses and captain choices. I had to gather them from the VODs, and here they are :

- Game 1 : Liquid chose first pick, then Secret chose Dire.

- Game 2 : Secret chose Dire, then Liquid chose First pick.

- Game 3 : Secret chose first pick, then Liquid chose Dire.

- Game 4 : Liquid chose first pick, then Secret chose Dire.

That tells a lot about the draft. First of all, Secret and Liquid both favored Dire. To my knowledge, the last time that happened was at TI5 with CDEC. However, this time, it’s for a much different reason. In my opinion, there are 2 reasons for that :

- *Rosh control* : Obviously in favor of Dire. Heroes like Lycan (one of Matumbaman’s signatures), Ursa (also Matumbaman’s hero), and OD (both teams play it) are very strong because of that.

- *The dire jungle* : First of all, choosing Dire puts even more pressure on Liquid to ban Puppey’s enigma. Second, even without Enigma considered, jungle strats are much easier to execute on Dire. Puppey played a jungling hero in all 4 games : 1 on Enchantress, 3 on Doom. It’s also arguably a lot better for Chen to be on Dire, and Chen got banned in all games. It was probably going to get banned anyway, but we will talk about this later.

**Common points to each draft**

- The most contested hero in every draft was Nature’s Prophet. Either Secret would ban it if they didn’t have first pick, or first pick it themselves. This is of course because it can help with Roshan, because both teams have really good Nature’s Prophet players, and because it also goes really well with the patch in general since agression and pushing power are his signature.

- Secret always banned Earth Spirit in the first phase. Puppey was probably telling himself « Never again » after his ES game the other day (Keepo). Also, don’t forget that there is JerAx on Team Liquid, one of the best (if not the best) Earth Spirit players in the world, if he was not banworthy already. 

- JerAx was probably the least targeted player in this draft along with PLD. PLD got his Lion in 3/4 games, his only game without Lion being in game 3 when Liquid got it. JerAx has a huge hero pool, which is probably why Puppey didn’t target ban him much. The only JerAx heroes that were banned are Tusk and Earth Spirit.

- Liquid always first phase banned Chen and Enigma. That is really telling to me, and it’s probably a case of Kuro respecting Puppey too much. **Having to use 2 bans on Puppey put Liquid on the backfoot by a large amount during the drafting phase**, because that meant that they had to play into Secret’s hand from the start. They could not contest Nature’s Prophet and never got it a single time during these games. Same for Earth Spirit. It’s also really telling to me that Liquid, the team which was the most comfortable drafting around Ursa, was not able to get it a single time during these finals.

- Liquid put a lot of priority on Tusk and Invoker. As we saw, they are comfort heroes for FATA- and JerAx.

- Liquid had first pick in 3/4 games, but they shuffled their picks around a little bit. However, they picked Invoker first in 2 of these games, and in the other they picked Invoker second after Tusk.

So just in general, because of the variety of Puppey’s heroes, Liquid played with a drafting disadvantage and out of their comfort zone, IMHO.

**Game 1** :

- Secret bans Nature’s Prophet because Liquid has first pick, and Earth Spirit because you don’t want to let JerAx have this hero. Liquid banned Chen and Enigma in the first phase. I already discussed about it just above.

- Liquid first picks Invoker. That’s a smart pick because it’s also one of w33’s best heroes, so it’s a bit of a blockpick. Secret then picks Lion and OD, who don’t reveal much about the draft yet − the only things in common with those heroes are lack of AoE and lack of pushing power, which can easily be remedied with the next 3 picks. OD is also a great rosh hero, which is seriously worth taking into consideration since Secret are on Dire.

- Liquid instantly picks Phoenix in response. This would make sense against OD and Lion since they can not really take the egg out easily, but it’s probably not a counterpick. This leaves the pool with a lot of options since you can run Phoenix as a roamer or in the offlane (although it’s rarely done in this patch).

- In the second ban phase, Secret started by banning Tusk, which I found a bit weird. Normally, it’s JerAx’s hero as well. There is some synergy between them (Sigil + Supernova), they make a decent roaming combo, but I would have rather banned Lycan in this situation. Lycan almost nullifies hex from Lion since he runs at 600 MS while hexed, he goes for BKB naturally, and he abuses one of OD’s biggest weaknesses which is running at him and hitting him with BKB. OD can not manfight for shit if the enemy hero has BKB or is naturally very good at manfighting like Lycan with necro 3. Liquid responds by banning Beastmaster. Not only was it one of Misery’s heroes during this tournament, the added attack speed aura and pushing power from necro units synergise well with OD and Lion who can not push well. He also offers one more way to lock people down to let OD whale on them. Secret bans Ursa, which is (as we saw) not an Envy hero but works really well with Liquid. Liquid responds by banning Dazzle. I don’t think it was a good idea either. Dazzle has been a very risky hero this tournament because while he offers nice sustain during pushes and decent teamfight presence thanks to Weave, not only are Liquid not very reliant on Physical damage (they have picked Phoenix and Invoker so far !) but Dazzle also in general offers absolutely no counterpush. The idea was probably to save a target that’s being gone on, since at this stage you can be 99% sure it will be an Exort Invoker. However, I would have banned Ench here because Ursa just got banned and Ench is notoriously bad against Ursa. Also, Ench is okay at taking out the egg because she attacks from so far away that she doesn’t have to get out of position to hit it.

- Secret picks Tide. It’s a very stable hero but it’s also pretty good vs Invoker because he can Kraken off everything from Invoker except Cold Snap (I’m not sure about that one, if a kind soul wants to check it). He also can save his Ravage for the Supernova if they want it. Liquid responds with a Void pick, and I don’t like this pick either. It’s not even a blockpick either, since Secret revealed their offlaner already. Lion is really good vs Void because if he hexes and then fingers right away unlike the typical Lion player in pubs, Void can not time walk it off even if Hex is level 1. Void is also really vulnerable to lockdown and to single target damage offered by OD. And on top of that, he is a melee hero against a Tide, which is even scarier. At this point, it seems pretty clear that Liquid are just going for a wombo combo draft (Supernova + Chrono + Invoker’s stuff), but they can not apply pressure on their mid and offlane because their laning is not amazing, especially for Void. Secret responds to it with a very good Enchantress pick. It sort of nullifies the first 2 bans because Puppey was able to get a jungling hero anyway, and it adds more pushing power and more lane pressure. Ench is also a very scary hero mid to late game because of Impetus, and Liquid doesn’t have good heroes to deal with Ench apart from Invoker to an extent. At this point, I feel Liquid are kind of trapped : they can not apply pressure early on because of their heroes, and they don’t have exactly the superior late game either. Phoenix falls off because his best contribution later on is Sunray, not Supernova, and Void doesn’t really build damage items. On the other hand, Secret in the late game has potentially 2 ravages, an instant initiation from Lion (which can be considered as BKB piercing because of that), and OD who is normally weak in the late game can be very useful because of that. Liquid realize that they need damage as well as teamfight presence, and they go for a Witch Doctor pick which I found really smart. Cask bounces to creeps and stuns them for 5 seconds to stall early pushes, he has a good teamfight presence with Death Ward, he adds damage which Liquid are lacking so far, he comboes well with Void and he scales pretty well into the late game.

- For their last ban, Secret very smartly banned Gyrocopter. It’s one of Matumbaman’s best heroes, and it works wonderfully with their draft overall. You have of course Call Down + Chronosphere, but Gyro is also really good at taking a lead early on and applying pressure very early which is exactly what Liquid are lacking. Liquid banned Spectre, which goes back to what I was saying about their weaknesses : they have no lane pressure and they are not favored heavily in the late game. At this point, Liquid are already in a pretty bad situation, I would say, however this ban was smart from them.

- Secret picks a Slark which I love in this situation. Slark has an absurdly bad laning phase until he gets level 6, but he will probably be against a Void. He is advantaged heavily vs Witch Doctor, he is also pretty good vs Invoker because Invoker can not prevent Shadow Dance with Cold Snap or Deafening Blast, and in general Liquid don’t have enough burst to kill him between 2 dark pacts or before shadow dance. At this point, Liquid are outdrafted no matter what they choose. They go for a Necrophos, which is not a bad idea given the circumstances : it adds more sustain to the push to respond to Secret’s poke potential with Slark, Invoker and Enchantress. It also allows Liquid to actually kill the Slark or the Ench. Liquid needed a magic damage carry at this point. Their other option for me would have been Luna (however she gets shat on by both Ench’s creeps and Slark).

However, Secret had the superior draft in this game, kind of from the start. It’s not very surprising that they won it.

**Game 2** :

- First ban phase : SSOD.

- Liquid has first pick but this time they pick Tusk first, one of JerAx’s heroes. Secret picks Lion, and then they wait a long time before picking Ursa (around 40 seconds of reserve time). That’s a weird pick for them. Secret in this situation could easily have secured Invoker for themselves instead. Ursa is not really an Envy hero, and even though he works well on Dire and he works well with Lion, I don’t think Secret really needed to pick him to win this game. They probably wanted to crush Liquid by beating them with their own heroes, or pick Ursa no matter what. In this situation, they could have waited until 3rd pick to pick him up because Liquid had first pick so Secret picked first in the second phase. Overall, Secret are outdrafting themselves with this pick IMHO. Liquid responds with an Invoker pick, and once again it’s a good pick.

- Liquid starts the second banning phase by banning OD. 2 of the most contested mids in the pool are now either banned or on Liquid’s side. Secret uses a bit of reserve time to ban Lone Druid. Once again, Secret are banning a comfort hero, but this time it’s for Mind_Control. Liquid then bans Enchantress, which is a smart ban because Ursa is in the other team and as we all know since TI4, you can rosh at minute 2 with Ench + Ursa. Secret banned Phoenix next. Again, it’s a pretty strange ban to me. Ursa is one of the best heroes to deal with a Supernova, and Tusk + Phoenix are a decent combo but not amazing.

- Secret starts the second picking phase by picking Dark Seer. He has a very good synergy with Ursa (Surged Ursa), and it’s a hero which forces attention on to him. That also makes Tusk unable to get a good rotation on the safe lane. Liquid responds with a Beastmaster pick which I like a lot. The attack speed aura works wonderfully with Forged Spirits, and Alacrity can buff necro units. On top of that, Beastmaster’s kill potential is just that much better with a Sunstrike. This tells secret 2 things : their draft will push really hard, and it’s an Exort Invoker for sure (if they were not sure already). Secret then picks Death Prophet which is okay but not that good. It shuts down Invoker in lane a bit, and it offers a lot of push, but Secret have a lot of ways to deal with a Death Phophet in the mid game with Primal Roar, necro, and invoker’s damage. Tusk can also really easily set up some burst on her. Again, this pick being suboptimal goes back to the Ursa pick : had Secret picked their mid second and Ursa third, they would be in a much more comfortable spot. They are on the backfoot at that moment IMHO. Liquid then picks a Lycan, which is probably the best pick they could have had in this situation. Howl gives the boar and forged spirits bonus damage, it also threatens to steal Ursa’s aegises, it runs down Death Prophet and it escapes from Ursa as well as Lion.

- For their last ban, Secret banned Dazzle, which is to me telling that they wanted to focus a lot on the mid lane. Dazzle can add a bit of damage on a roared target, but most importantly it decreases Death Prophet’s damage a lot in fights because her damage is mostly physical over time, which gets weaker and weaker with Weave. It’s also really strong at punishing agression on the mid lane, and it’s probably the only thing advantageous for Secret in this draft. Liquid, recognising that focus on to FATA-’s invoker, bans Bounty Hunter last, one of the best heroes to shut down a mid and gank him. Orb of venom + Spirit Siphon on a hero with 280 base MS = EZ kills.

- Liquid takes an Oracle for their last pick. Once again, this is an extremely smart pick, as it does everything Liquid needs : Fate’s Edict has an insane uptime which is a nightmare for Ursa later on, and early on he is also one of the best heroes at repelling agression on the mid lane. If that was not enough, he poses a threat to Dark Seer and forces him to play really far back every time he is off map because Surge and Ion Shell can be purged, it adds yet another source of single target damage for the death prophet, and False Promise can be used either for Hex or for Ursa’s target. Secret responds to it by last picking Winter Wyvern, which I actually liked a lot. It’s one of the best heroes to deal with zoo pushes, because she has waveclear on an insane range and potentially can turn on super strong necro warriors with Howl and Inner Beast against Liquid. However, I think a much stronger pick would have been Keeper of the Light. He can farm the Dire jungle super quickly early on for an Agh’s around 12-15 minutes, he has a very long range waveclear, Mana Leak destroys Lycan, Chakra allows for double Crypt Swarm for even more waveclear, and none of their heroes really carry MKB well so Blinding Light also wrecks them. On top of that, it would allow for Death Prophet to use Exorcism to split push and still join fights because of Recall.

Overall, Secret really put themselves in a corner here. The draft was slightly in favor of Liquid and Liquid also had a much easier draft to execute.

**Game 3** :

This time, there was a pretty big change. Secret chose first pick, realising that Liquid’s bans were the same these last 2 games on the first phase and seeing an opportunity to pressure Liquid with a Nature’s Prophet. Liquid, as a followup, chose Dire. As I mentionned before, Dire was the most contested side this whole final, so it’s not surprising at all.

- On the first set of bans, Liquid stays true to themselves and ban Chen + Enigma. Something worth noting is that after the Ursa and Chen bans, Liquid spent some reserve time on banning Enigma, seeing that they had to let through either Puppeygma or Nature’s Prophet. In the end they chose the latter. Secret shows why they chose first pick and instead of banning Nature’s Prophet like they did in the previous games, ban Earth Spirit + Ursa, a very good decision. Banning Ursa in the first phase might seem unnecessary, but against Liquid it’s very much justified.

- Secret, having first pick, gets their hands on Nature’s Phophet. Then, Liquid picks Wisp and almost instantly follows up with an OD. It’s most definitely a pocket strat they are using, given their overall usage of reserve time this draft, as we will see later. This opening allows for a Wisp combo to go mid as well as an OD, giving flexibility in the draft. Secret responds by picking an Invoker, which is a very sound option because it can deal with both OD and a wisp combo decently mid. Invoker doesn’t really need runes so Wisp getting them is not as big as to other mid heroes. Invoker has a harder time vs OD, but every hero does have issues vs OD mid in this patch pretty much except cheesy mids.

- Liquid then instantly bans Drow ranger. Again, it’s probably because they have their whole draft in mind, since Drow was not played before in these series. It’s also a nice ban vs heroes with summons − Precision aura makes towers melt like Snow in he sun. Secret used a lot of time (around 28s of reserve time) to ban out Tusk. Wisp is most definitely Kuro’s hero which leaves the JerAx question open and that’s a way to adress it. Also, Wisp + another hero + Tusk can net kills in the mid lane very early in the game, and even Wisp + OD + Tusk can do it pretty comfortably. Liquid then bans Enchantress, which is one of the heroes that can deal with OD quite well. It also would be a good addition to Secret’s draft, as it can add lane pressure, it abuses OD’s lack of AoE, it kills wisp with ease and it’s not really killable by a lot of Wisp combos : Wisp+Tiny can not kill Ench by themselves if she has Drums + Wand + Dragon Lance, same for Wisp+Sven, Wisp+Bristle… Some combos like Wisp+Gyro would be still available, but having Ench picked up by Secret would really restrict their draft or their play. Really good ban there. Secret then bans out Beastmaster, which is a really good combo with Wisp : Primal roar sets up easy relocate kills, and the hawk scouts them.

- For the next phase, Liquid picked Lion. It’s both a blockpick (we all know what PLD can do on Lion) and a very good addition to their draft. It doesn’t have the *oomph* of a Beastmaster in terms of setting up kills, but it still offers a lot of control on top of relocate ganks. I also love how Liquid are not picking their Wisp combo yet ; it allows to keep Secret in doubt as far as who will lane where. Secret responds with a Doom pick. It can be either an EE doom or most likely a Puppey Doom at this point. Doom allows Secret to put pressure on Liquid’s draft by being greedy. It might seem stupid to pick a doom into a wisp, but in this case since Liquid has their 2 supports and that’s wisp+lion, they know they can not pressure the jungle very early. Not to mention Doom is in general good vs OD because he runs at him, Doom disables Arcane Orb, and Doom’s lack of armor is not abused by OD at all. At this point, Liquid are a bit under pressure : they need a physical damage carry to at least be able to kill the doom, and they can not take Beastmaster anymore. Liquid chooses Tide next, and they probably picked him to add another doom target and prevent their OD from getting doomed. However, they picked a core that deals absolutely no damage by himself, so they are still pressured to find a decent physical damage carry. And if they pick a melee carry, there is always the risk of Sprout (right, Artour ?). Secret’s next pick is Clinkz which I liked a lot in this situation. It’s a very good Clinkz game because the 2 supports are very squishy on the side of Liquid, they lack damage except from Arcane Orb, and Clinkz is a very natural BKB and evasion carrier (did I mention OD hates evasion on the enemy team, and Clinkz tends to get Solar Crest a lot ?). OD has no option but to astral and run vs a Clinkz gank, Tide can only run, and the 2 supports are food for a Clinkz. Since Liquid now has to rely on their Wisp combo more than they would in other situations, being able to kill Wisp quickly is game winning.

- For their last ban, Liquid banned Witch Doctor. It’s a pretty good ban : it works well against Wisp, he will probably get some farming space because a Clinkz is on his team (and WD with Agh’s is always scary), and in general it’s a hero that would work with Secret’s draft well. Secret banned Slark last, which is weird IMHO. Sure, it’s a pretty good Slark game, but the enemy team has Wisp and are probably going to pick something that works with the Wisp. Slark also doesn’t deal that much damage in the mid game because he has to constantly get in and out of fights, and on top of that Liquid would have probably banned Disruptor if they planned on taking Slark. Disruptor owns Slark and Wisp, and on the other hand Slark destroys Witch Doctor.

- Liquid picked Tiny last, which is sound. I would have liked a hero like Gyrocopter here better, though. It has a better synergy with Ravage, it’s one of Matumbaman’s best heroes, and Gyro tends to get a BKB pretty early which works well against Invoker. Sure, it’s weak to Clinkz, but so is Tiny. Secret responds by picking Disruptor, and it’s another anti-Wisp hero, and it also works wonders against Tide because you can not kraken off anything from Disruptor. Once again, picking up Gyro would have been better vs Disruptor IMHO.

Overall, the draft is slightly in favor of Secret, even though Liquid did a very good job. Keep in mind that Liquid are essentially 2 bans down because they ban Chen+Enigma first phase every game.

**Game 4** :

Liquid chose first pick again this game, and Secret chose Dire.

- First phase bans : Once again, Liquid bans Chen + Enigma. Secret bans Earth Spirit and Nature’s Prophet since they don’t have first pick themselves.

- Liquid first picks an Invoker. Same stuff as before. Secret responds by Lion and Doom. Picking up Doom this early means it could also easily be turned into a core. However, I don’t like how they picked him second, I thought they could have waited for the second phase to pick him since once again Secret had the first pick of second phase. Picking up someone like OD or Beastmaster would have been more safe IMHO. Secret used a little bit of reserve time before picking Doom (4 seconds or so) which tells me that it was not a pocket strat. Liquid then picks up a Tusk second and sticks to their guns.

- Secret proceeds to ban Lycan next, which is once again a very smart choice. It leaves OD still in the pool by removing one of his bad matchups. Liquid responds with a Dark Seer ban. I think it’s because apart from Lycan (who can just kill the ion shelled creep), none of Matu’s heroes are really good at dealing with Dark Seer in lane, so they can not let this go to Secret. Liquid are trying to be put as little pressure on their safe lane as possible. Secret responds with an Ench ban, and it’s probably because Ench can counteract the rotations of a Doom and save a doom target. That’s a pretty clear sign that Doom will not be a core, though. Liquid recognise that and ban out Tide on the next phase, which is again a very comfort pick for Misery and a very good hero at shutting down melee laners 1v1. At this point, it’s pretty clear to me that Liquid want to just get a good 1v1 safe lane matchup for Matumbaman.

- Secret third picks Beastmaster, the third standout offlaner of these finals. At this point, Liquid are pretty much fucked : they banned the other 2 offlaners themselves and the third is on Secret so they already shot themselves in the foot. Their draft is restricted and that’s why they will pick Void later (but we will talk about it later). Liquid responds with a Dazzle pick, which tells me they are quite lost. They want to go back to what made them win in game 2, but there is a big difference there : they don’t have Beastmaster, they don’t have great push to synergise well with Dazzle, the enemy team doesn’t get shut down by Weave, and Dazzle is a pretty subpar pick even for defensive supports here. If I were Liquid, I would probably have picked an Abaddon instead : it’s godly against Doom, really good against Beastmaster + Lion too, and it can work both as a support and as an aura carrier in the offlane. Secret responds by picking up w33ndranger, and at this point Secret outdrafted Liquid extremely hard. Liquid needs a lot of burst to get rid of WR, they need better defensive options than a dazzle, and they also need control. They pick up Void, which offers control but no damage, and it also adds another hero who can not pressure lanes (the first was Dazzle).

- On last ban, once again, Secret ban out Gyro, which is again a very good idea. Liquid ban out Spectre, realising that they have no lane pressure and having Spectre on the enemy team is almost a guaranteed loss if it was not grim already. Secret responds with the final blow to Liquid in this draft : the Slark pickup abuses the lack of early pressure from Liquid, and Slark can not really be controlled by Liquid’s draft unless he gets caught out of position and dies in chrono. Liquid knows that they have no choice but to go for an extremely early stomp into a 15 minute victory at this point, so they pick up Drow ranger. Given how bad the situation is for them, I think it’s a good pick. It gives them the highest chance of winning, even though winning is extremely unlikely at this point.

Overall, it’s not surprising that this game was such a huge stomp IMHO. Secret won the game at the 3rd pick.

I played many wisp games and still have less than 50% wins on him, for some reason. And as opposed to many of my signature supports, I die a lot on him.

http://www.dotabuff.com/players/147675906/matches?hero=io

So I understand that sometimes, my team fucks me over (« Oh, there is a wisp ! He can solo support, right ? » or « Oh, you want to relocate ? Let me make sure that I break the link » or even « Relocate ? Let’s just 5 man »), but there must be some issue with my play as well.

What are the most common pitfalls of a wisp player ? Am I just meant to not play the hero until I get at least 4k MMR ? What the hell do I do in the mid game, especially with Relocate ? Normally I try to group with only 1 player, and use relocate for fights, but it rarely works. I’m getting desperate to make this hero work because I love his concept but it seems as if every time I pick him, the enemy team says « Fuck THIS guy in particular » and tries to kill me over and over.",learndota2,"Normally, I don’t die over 10 times in games as a support, except when I’m playing Wisp.

I had this question for quite some time already. It’s a very common thing in 2.5k ranked CM to pick teamfight lineups, if I’m not the captain. A good example was this game I played : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/2090725757

So you can notice that the enemy team has medusa **and** spectre. I told my team that they would not group early and we could take towers as soon as I would get my mek on enigma. Mek came very early as I got first blood on spectre as she tried to kill me with haunt (around 7 minutes or so ?), but then for some reason towers seemed to never fall. Around 15 minutes into the game the enemy team was grouping up, a decision which would normally be stupid. Because we were not expecting it, we took quite a bit of bad fights and ended up losing. I died about 5-6 times because I didn’t expect their 5-manning.

So apart from having a team that’s willing to listen to you, what do you do when you find yourself in this situation ? Normally, my solution is to force it late as enigma because in general the enigma lineup wins late, but of course you can not really do it vs spectre + dusa. So what do you do ?

Also, I was not the captain, I know first picking enigma is a bad idea and I know we got outdrafted.

I wanted to experiment a bit this afternoon, so I picked an Invoker, a hero which I had only played once and quite terribly. So I had almost not practiced at all.

Here is the game : https://yasp.co/matches/2066304237

I think I did better than expected in the laning phase. I was against a QoP, and managed to kill her once after she had solo killed me, and even went up to a wicked sick streak. However, I started throwing once 5 manning started to happen more and more and I went from something like 8/1 to 11/7, then we lost.

My questions are :

- Looking back at the game, I should probably have taken wex at level 2 to have alacrity, then take 4 in quas, 4 in exort, 1 in wex to have pushing power with forged spirits, and take necronomicon instead of eul’s. Is that correct ?

- For the spells, I’m not exactly sure which combos I should have used. I had urn so I was thinking I should use cold snap + urn, which I did a few times, I tried the eul’s - meteor - sunstrike combo but failed miserably, and i got interrupted by stuns a lot when i was trying to set up my combos. Especially lion tossing stuns for no reason really messed up with me even though he was wasting his mana.

- I didn’t leave the lane often, which I thought was fine, but my team didn’t. Who was right, who was left ?

I watched Guru Pathik’s guide on Invoker but I didn’t remember it totally… I think I will practice a bit vs unfair bots before trying him again. Which spells should I have invoked most of the time ?

So I’m not that great at Weaver, and I always have trouble choosing which items I should buy on him. People tend to say, for very good reasons, that Linken’s sucks on him if you don’t build it specifically for one single-target spell, or a hero that doesn’t have many answers to linken’s (Anti-Mage…). But the advantage of this item was, according to a friend of mine who plays Weaver quite a bit, also the regen that you got. In some ways, it’s both a defensive item and a farming item, which was why it was common.

This led me to think about this issue : How can you provide Weaver both with survivability and farming capabilities if you want to exclude linken’s ?

First of all, I thought of a 6.83-like build : **Phase-RoA-MoM**, and its variation **Phase-RoA-HotD**. The MoM build doesn’t make Weaver very tanky, however, and Weaver doesn’t really benefit from a HotD active well because he can not really farm well stacks. So I was still unsatisfied with this build. However, I still thought Aquila was a very nice purchase, because of the mana regen aura and its very cost efficient stats for an agi hero that actually has quite low stats.

Then I thought about Weaver’s farming patterns and how often he needed the jungle. What struck me when I thought about his patterns is that he played like Phantom Lancer a lot. He has no AoE, Geminate sort of acts like a single-target nuke (in place of Spirit Lance), and Shukuchi sort of acted like a more efficient Phantom Rush and illusion push (it hits every creep it touches, adding as much damage as illusions would have done, roughly).

So here is my starting point. Which items do you build on Phantom Lancer ? BoTs, drums, aquila, vlad’s, diffusal. This led me to a few build ideas for Weaver :

- **BoTs-Drums-Vlad’s**. This build doesn’t use up an UAM, which allows for a later deso (even though I’m not the biggest fan of deso on Weaver). It gives a lot of stats, a lot of MS thanks to BoTs and Drums, and pushing power with Vlad’s.

- **BoTs-Aquila-Vlad’s** : A more 6.84 PL build, which I would apply here to weaver. It looks on paper inferior to the drums build however, because Weaver lacks early stats.

- **Treads-Vlads-Drums** : This build would actually be quite bad on Phantom Lancer. On Weaver it’s pretty interesting, but I dislike it since you don’t have the « oomph » of BoTs.

I often outsmart myself in these situations, thinking I can farm safely because they should have spread out but they have not. So what should I do in those weird cases ?

I’ve started to play a lot of Clinkz lately and my usual build is aquila-soul ring-treads-deso and then manta/MKB/daedalus/butterfly. However, I’ve noticed that many top rated Clinkz players (Chains for example) like going for Solar Crest a lot. I was curious about this build, so I decided to make a comparison between the 2 and see who was the most efficient.

**Hypotheses** :

- Clinkz is level 11 (searing arrows level 4, death pact level 2, no point in stats), with either Treads (on agi)+Soul Ring+deso+aquila OR Treads+Soul Ring+Solar Crest+Helm of the Dominator

- We won’t consider the damage range of Clinkz, meaning we will consider that his 15-21 base damage is actually 18

- We will consider that Clinkz always has Death Pact up, with a creep that has 1100 HP eaten (that’s the max value, and pretty much every big camp spwan has 1 creep with 1100 HP)

- We will include Searing Arrows in the damage calculations

- (added with an edit) With the Crest+HotD build, we will calculate the damage based on a dominated creep’s HP for the death pact bonus damage.

- I forgot about strafe and the +9 damage from agi treads because I was an idiot .___. I will edit later.

**Comparisons of the stats of these item sets** :

- Total cost of Solar Crest + Helm of the dominator : **4850 gold**. Total cost of deso + aquila : **4510 gold**.

- Solar crest gives -10 armor with the active, deso gives -7 armor

- Solar crest + HotD give these stats : +75% mana regen, (30% evasion, 10 armor), 3 HP regen, +20 damage, +5 armor =&gt; a lot of physical survivability

- Deso+aquila gives these stats : +59 damage, +9 agi, +1 armor (2 with the agi bonus), +3 strength, +3 agility, aquila aura =&gt; slightly more survivability vs magic damage, also *more pushing power* (-7 armor vs buildings)

- To sum up : if you don’t consider damage, deso+aquila pushes faster, but crest+helm gives a lot more physical survivability.

- Solar Crest doesn’t take up your UAM, so be wary of that if you think you want to go Skadi.

**Damage calculations** :

- Solar Crest + HotD gives an average damage of : 18 (base damage average) + 22 + 3×10 (agility) + 60 (searing arrow) + 20 (helm) + 0,065×(1100+500) (dominated creep eaten) = **254**. Without Strafe, you have a total IAS of 22 + 3×10 (agility) + 9 + 30 (agi treads) = 91, so 1.91/1.7 = 1.123 attacks/second. This translates to a DPS value of 254×1.123 = **285.4 damage per second**.

- Deso + aquila gives a total of 18 (base damage average) + 22+30 (agi) + 60 + 0.065×1100 + 68 (build) = **269,5** damage. Without Strafe, the IAS given by this build is 22 + 30 (agi) + 9 (aquila agi) + 9 + 30 (agi treads) = 100. So that makes 2/1.7 = 1.176 attacks per second, which translates into 269,5×1,176 = **316,9 damage per second**.

**Comparison of actual damage per second with different armor values** :

| Builds vs armor | 0 armor | 5 armor | 7 armor | 10 armor | 20 armor |
|:-----------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| HotD + Crest build | 392 | 351 | 329 | 285 | 178 |
| Deso + aquila build | 411 | 351 | 317 | 268 | 178 |

**Conclusions** :

- Between 5 and 20 armor, HotD + Crest gives more DPS

- Otherwise deso gives more DPS.

- However, for armor values between 0 and 20, the difference is not really big (less than 30 DPS). Moreover, when a Clinkz is level 11, few heroes are likely to have more than 20 armor (I can only think of Visage with 4 Cloak stacks, Dragon Knight and Terrorblade as counter examples)

- Just in terms of damage, the deso build is slightly more cost-efficient. The deso build gives also a lot more pushing power, and the Solar Crest build gives a lot more physical survivability as well as the ability to get Skadi.

**TL;DR** : If you need Skadi or if the enemy team has something with high physical burst (Ursa, Troll…) go for Solar Crest + HotD. If you need more push, go for deso+aquila.",DotA2,Deso+aquila vs Solar Crest+HotD on Clinkz (with calculations !),https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3m3lb5/desoaquila_vs_solar_cresthotd_on_clinkz_with/

So here is an AM game that I played not long ago : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1781819961

I picked him because I thought he would be good vs Sniper and he was one of the 2 carries that I would have went for (the other being Spectre). We laned as a 2-1-2 despite my call for a trilane, we ended up vs Tiny+Spectre (yeah, Normal skill for you). We almost killed them a few times with keeper, but could not do it. At some point, KotL really started to fuck me up by pushing constantly with Illuminate so I had to farm the jungle a lot to get battlefury, and so I did. He then criticized me for not having enough farm. Luckily, despite this, we came back. Thanks, mute button.

That’s not the first time I have issues with AM in the early game. I think it’s also partially the mistake of my supports, but also, how can I make myself unable to be shut down in the safe lane ? Here are a few of my thoughts :

- I should have upped my stout into PMS. There was absolutely no reason not to do it.

- Should have bought quelling blade earlier, right after boots

- Should have pulled the hard camp more consistently to make at least the best out of a bad situation.

- Should not have tried to kill a hard camp stacked without BF.

- Should not have stayed low vs a Spectre (who would have thought ?)

- I didn’t expect the Tiny to gank because he was really far behind and typically as Tiny you don’t gank to catch up, however this tiny did and it made the early game hard for me

- And of course there are missed last hits.

Today, I finally played my last not-played hero : Kunkka. I ran him as a safe lane farmer in this game : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1767329068

I have a few questions and impressions about this game :

- I picked Kunkka because it was random draft and it was the only « anti-brood » carry that we had left (I picked last). I know Kunkka doesn’t deal with Brood that well normally, but it actually went surprisingly well in lane, Brood wasn’t very good

- My skill build was not optimal, I should have gone for 1-4-4-1 at level 10. I missed a few kills on a tracked brood because she went too fast

- Don’t X combo a jugg… *facepalms himself*

- My second BF was probably a mistake, I should have gone for a Daedalus or a Blink straight away.

- Tower damage is too low, but after a while we could not fight neither push at all, they just pushed faster than us.

- The game felt really even, and then all of a sudden they steamrolled us. I think my allies’ questionnable itemization was not the only factor here. Do you have any idea on how I could have behaved in fights better ?

- Of course any advice on the items I bought is most welcome. I expected a hard lane vs Brood so I went Tango-Salve-Stout-2 branches. I went phase into bottle into BF (starting with quelling blade) into second BF.

- I watched Relax You’re fine’s Kunkka guide, are there any other resources on him ?

So lately I played a lot in stacks, and the few times I got to go mid I got rekt. My support play is rusty but OK, and my carry play is decent IMHO. I have a bit of experience in the mid lane but not that much, and although sometimes I pull off good games starting in the mid lane, overall I lose my team the game more often than not. And I think I’m a bad laner overall, even in the safe lane (which I’m most used to) I screw up sometimes. However, since I play a lot of carries, I tend to know how to farm pretty well (I am the top last hitter of both teams in pretty much every game when I play carry).

I have read and watched a lot of guides about the mid lane, but I seem to always come short when it comes to applying them. So in short, my question is :

**How do I become better in the mid lane ?**

Should I start with only 1 hero (like SF or QoP maybe ?) and simply play, should I go into 1v1 solo mid matches, should I practice in custom lobbies against friends of similar skill, should I watch a lot of replays ? Thanks in advance for your answers.

Last night I had a game with a 5 stack where I played a carry PA. Since I had free farm early on, I decided to go for a Battlefury build. I was pretty confident that we were outfarming them, but for some reason we took a couple of bad fights when we tried to rax them and at some point I died back, then we immediately lost. After looking at the stats, I saw that we had in fact quite an advantage, I wonder how we were not able to take any building.

Here is the game : http://yasp.co/matches/1661048784/

Here is my analysis so far :

- My dark seer said he hated the refresher build, yet I thought it was the correct choice. If I had the gold and the time, I would have replaced the BF with something like a Divine or an MKB probably. I just felt like I needed 2 satanics and 2 bkbs at that time, and the fight where I had refresher up it was really effective.

- Should have watched for Sand King more and pop BKB a bit preemptively.

- Which target should I prioritize ? NP was not really an issue, because he went for Agh’s-Refresher-Octarine. The divine he has in his inventory is Gyro’s. The spectre had equally crappy items and was not scary at all. So maybe Sand King ? Tiny felt like a non-factor to me too. I’m not sure.

- Not reactive enough to cut down trees with BF against a Nature’s Prophet

- I was not active enough early on. I should have built an aquila before BF and split pushed. My tower damage could have been higher too. I forced my team to play 4v5 early, like a bad Anti-Mage, and my supports suffered from me taking the farm.

- Wait until I respawn with an Aegis to use BKB or satanic, dammit.

- Don’t get tunnel visioned. That’s what happened right after I destroyed both T4s, and it lost us the game.

As a pretty frequent abaddon player, the fact that Blink is canceled upon taking damage but urn doesn’t has always been bothering me.

The most obvious example is the interaction with False Promise. The damage is delayed, so why would urn be interrupted ? Same with Abaddon’s shield. I’m fine with damage during borrowed time interrupting urn, but for shield and false promise it seems really out of place.",DotA2,[Suggestion] Not interrupt Urn when you don’t take actual damage,http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3dxyff/suggestion_not_interrupt_urn_when_you_dont_take/

I was wondering : some heroes have a custom channeling animation for TP scrolls (like CM I think), is it possible to create one for a hero that does not have one ?

So for my 10 hero challenge, I tried out Enigma, a hero that I am *very* unfamiliar with (he is in my least played heroes, and also among my worst).

I started in the jungle both games, and I got ganked a couple times. I think I also did a couple mistakes during jungling, mostly stacking dark troll camps and not microing eidolons properly afterwards. I also think I should have gone for Mek first in the second game and blink first in the first one.

Here are the games in question :

First : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1608998764

Second : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1609934457

I also made big fails in the first game (black holing an illusion, namely. If you see me standing still afterwards, that’s because I was facepalming myself). Apart from « not choking », what is your advice ?",learndota2,Feedback on my last 2 enigma games,http://www.reddit.com/r/learndota2/comments/3ca3q1/feedback_on_my_last_2_enigma_games/

So in my last ranked game, I saw a Tide and a Tiny building Heart : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1590859586

This was not the first time I saw it, and in fact I saw quite a bit of hearts on heroes like Pudge, Tidehunter, and others too…

Why is this a thing ? Heart feels very often underwhelming to me.
