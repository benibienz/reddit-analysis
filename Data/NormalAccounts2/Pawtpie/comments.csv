8,"I know. It's such a lame meme. Yet such an intriguing meme. Such disappointment in me you must have for posting such a thing on the Brawlhalla subreddit. However the memes that are done right are the ones that become a form of art. Allow me to explain: notice how Cross is centered in this digital photograph. This allows the viewer to see the emphasis on the character. The serious face of Cross is contrasted with the overall comedic effect of the meme itself. The text below Cross only further increases the effect of focus. Furthermore, the scenery contrasts quite well with the selected CC color. I would personally say that this is a work of impressionism, as there is much detail around the lighting to be observed. It's as if Cross is right there in front of me, rather than being a computer graphic locked on a screen.  

There are many things to be speechless about, I completely understand. The sudden realization that the term ""cross bows"" and ""cross"" are somehow interconnected provides a sudden insight of common sense. There may also be a lack of words when it comes to the overwhelming evaluation that can be made upon a further analysis of the underlying message. 

Overall, the simplicity of this work provides support for the underlying comedic effect as well, making it successful in its presentation.",2016-11-17 03:40:52+00:00,da3r3k0,2,t1_da3pooq,2079,Brawlhalla

12,"There's something that Brawlhalla has that none of the other games do. When you play ranked, it's only YOU versus everyone else. In team games you have to learn how to play well with a team. But in Brawlhalla, you have the potential to learn far faster than others by yourself. Games are also shortest in Brawlhalla, so you can experience more quickly. I myself played about 800 hours in LoL, but I found it stressful to even deal with my team. And the games were way too long! Now I almost have 1000 hours in brawlhalla and I'm loving all the new things that are constantly being added :). In terms of who you should play, play whoever you want! Eventually you will find certain characters, and certain weapons, that YOU PERSONALLY enjoy. All characters in this game are viable, and playing as many weapons and characters as possible can only make you better as well :). New weapons are on the way, new characters, and with the Playstation 4 launch happening eventually, it might even be a bragging right to have been a part of the game before it became way more popular than it already is as well.",2016-11-16 14:27:43+00:00,da2ql3d,1,t3_5d2s6o,86096,Brawlhalla

22,"I have nothing against passive play and consider it to be one of the best play styles currently. I only mean to suggest that while some characters may be better suited for defensive play, others may be better for more aggressive play. I have updated the wording on my list to contrast this better.",2016-11-02 19:42:51+00:00,d9itf2y,2,t1_d9ijcqo,11570,Brawlhalla
23,"A defensive play style would definitely be parry or punish, although even glass cannons can perform these actions as well. I can probably get more detailed with the aggressive point of view. I suggest that an aggressive play style can probably vary in performance depending on the chosen character. My opinion comes in where I introduce the idea that characters *may* be more suitable for aggressive play with high movement speed and dexterity. This is why I have attempted to keep defense as low as possible, to provide more support for the other more aggressive suitable stats such as dex and speed. My list was created just to show characters that could be more optimal when played aggressively, but I also acknowledge that other characters might be more suitable with a more defensive style.

24,"Due to new insight, I have changed my wording around the ""line of playability"" as well and have updated the list.

25,"So far this list has no consideration for weapons. Although Kor has gauntlets, he has average dexterity and near minimal movement speed. There are many katar characters in the section as well. My reasoning behind this is due to their either near minimal dexterity or movement speed. My list was made to show that there may be better options regarding gauntlets for example, such as wu shang, who has around the same strength, but vastly more dexterity and some more movement speed. Keep in mind that the main reason for the placement of characters below the line is due to their levels of defense. This is due to my opinion that defense should be lower for more optimal aggressive characters in exchange for high stats in the remaining areas. 

Just as my list shows characters that may be more optimal from the top down, the inverse might be true for players who prefer a more passive gameplay from bottom up. Therefore I am only recommending that Kor might perform better with more defensive strategies. I do appreciate your input and would not mind answering any other questions as my list is open to changes.",2016-11-02 19:00:37+00:00,d9ir8fg,2,t1_d9iq7w8,1179,Brawlhalla

27,"When you add up the stats of any character the sum is 22. My idea was that by reducing defense I would see more ability in the areas that may be more useful in aggressive play such as dexterity and movement speed. The range for characters that might be seen during the competitive scene should technically range from Ada to  Brynn, from god tier to S-tier. This would include more commonly seen characters such as Bodvar and Asuri.",2016-11-02 16:36:07+00:00,d9ijo6c,2,t1_d9iim84,1212,Brawlhalla
28,"Hello and thank you for your reply. The list is primarily an attempt for me to rank characters who may be more suitable for aggressive play styles. I did state that defense was, in my opinion, the most unnecessary stat for aggressive play. This is why primarily the characters are sorted by defense from least to greatest, to place the least amount defense utilized as possible first (aside from my reasoning that characters with 3-4 defense may be too weak). As the total the stats for any character when added up are 22, the idea was that with less defense, I would then be able to sort the list according to the remaining stats. I considered that with less defense, I might see characters with more dexterity/movement speed which may favor more aggressive play. This is how I personally defined aggressive ability by a character's defense. For a character such as sentinel or queen nai, although they have weapons such as katars, they either have near minimal dexterity or movement speed which would lead me to assume that they might not be the best for more aggression versus defensive/counter play. The tiers for the characters under the line of playability were probably unnecessary as I am implying that they never be considered for an aggressive play style. From my perspective the characters above the line are more suitable due to the reason that everyone below are either at or near minimal dexterity or movement speed. I wanted to place some emphasis on weapons, but the stats seemed reasonable enough. 

Furthermore, upon reviewing the list, I have moved Scarlet and Azoth below the line due to their near minimal movement speed as I have done for Gnash and Teros in dexterity. Overall I still believe that the vast majority of characters I have specified above this line are the most suitable for an aggressive play style.",2016-11-02 16:27:35+00:00,d9ij837,2,t1_d9ihiw7,1973,Brawlhalla

56,"Gravy Cancel is one of the best tournaments out there. I'm a so glad they have returned back to the Brawlhalalalal community. So many move that take place throughout these games. The bomhallas, the gimps, it all narrows down the the one true victor. Gravy Cancel gives me the opportunity to pull off some of the most clutch plays i can even think about trying to do. I throw a sair out and i just don't care. If I gotta throw the lance to get the kill then may the bots return another weapon to me. The best of the best come out to play so i guess if I sign up i am one of the bests?? Dang these tournaments get me a so exited i cannot a wait to do a gc in the gc tournament. The announcers are always sexy and do a gr8 job announcing the matches as well. Lots of skins have been released since the last gc tournament i've seen this is going to be a great time to show them off as well. Maybe we'll even see a few weapons fly off the screen i have a no clue. Gravy cancel is probably the most fun i have in a tournament. I love their brackets and get to spend the whole day on discord chillin and climbing. Everyone gathers around and they try to be the very best. Oh how I cannot a wait for this upcoming gravy cancel tournament. Whether ur gold, plat, diamond, or tin, you can a sign up and try a your very best. Because in the end it doesn't matter if you win or lose because only one person's a gonna win. It's about the experience. The experience of the thrill of climbing. The experiencing of salt. The experiencing of clutch. Pick ur main or just play pink ulgrim as long as ur having fun that's the best thing you can do. Long live gravy cancel and their amazin tournaments they get me so pumped every time.

Such as satisfying view to take in as the bomb reaches his salt water beardus. His elo fell with that ko as he fell down into a deep state of saltus. If i was the thatch i would have never even wanted to ever want to think about ever wanting to even trying to think about how i would go on playing the rest of this game after the humiliation that must be been to blame for the burnt oven that his his bomb.I send my rips out to thatchamus as he recovers from this tragic event from which it may be hard to recover from. Yes indeed the thatch will probably take out a sword and call it yours but his humiliation will never be alright after this one.

After writing up until now i'm just starting to realize that this isn't thatchamus, this is a bodvarus. Silly me, something was off once i noticed that a thatchamus had a bear hat. I pay my respects to any thatchamus mains I must have offended with my thatchamus comment. I do apologize for my thatchamus comments. The bodvar may he rips in pepper dips as he recovers from this unfortunate event. The bomb came out of nowhere and I can't find my cat.

149,"Hello my name is Pawtpie, I'm a Diamond player who has **1700** elo and I'm here to give you insight INTO WHY THESE HAPPEN and what you can and should do about it to do betters. Ok so **FIRST** things first when players throw weapons at you constantly in silver and gold elo look at this as a blessing from Papa Tengu Koji himself! Chances are that these players definitely DON'T know how to use weapons to stun you and continue attacking. I bet there's a much higher chance that they will accidentally waste their weapons instead. Weapon throws do no damage so as long as you keep your weapon and hit them they'll neva win! **SECOND** if anyone ever says git gud, ez, pz, lemon, squeezie, WHATEVER THE RANDOM COMMENT they are confirmed noob. And if you are fighting confirmed noobies, and continue to practice improving in this game of BRAWLHALLA, you will eventually make it to play and diamond **ignore them and make sure u say gg before leaving a game in which u stomp on ur opponent noob** 


**As a new player, look at these bully players as an opportunity! IF you ever defeat one, make sure you really rub it in with a GG, REKT, but don't hurt their self esteem by calling them noobs or scrubs as this is not worth ur time, you need the time to get to diamond elo instead.**

155,"I think I read something before that plat players are really good and performing strings and combos accurately, but diamond players know how to ""play their opponent"" much better. Up until I was plat I would perform the same moves depending on how I initiated them. The problem with higher elo diamond gameplay is that 99% of the time your opponent will know these standard retaliations. **The only way to get and maintain diamond elo is to become less predictable**. And, imo, the best way to do this is to learn as many different strings and combos as possible rather than just a 1 and done type of move each time. Don't approach your opponent in such an obvious way that he is already prepared to counter you. You might have to utilize dodge options and even delay your approaches. Nothing is forcing you to attack immediately. Many diamond players utilize tricky options such as throwing weapons and dodging to suddenly secure their approach. Aside from these ideas, it should be apparent that you might not climb elo as easily if you don't use your mains. It's probably impossible to gain elo if you're not confident with your character. All of these are just my opinion so I'm not sure exactly how many others would agree but I think most of this seems pretty logical.



**tldr:** Find a way to become less predictable, high plat and diamond players know everything you know so you need to somehow make things different. Learn as many ways as possible to approach and attack your opponent so that you can become more flexible. Focus on playing your opponent rather than ""playing the game"" with the same moves constantly. Try to read your opponent as hard as you can *actively*.


**Bonus** I really believe in this: try different characters! You may be surprised how much you might enjoy a certain character without realizing it. You might even prefer some characters over your mains that you've gotten to like lvl 5. For instance, I was gold 4 when I started to gain interest in Brynn and got diamond for the first time *that afternoon*. Regardless it's important to play all the characters for the sake of knowing how to play against them anyways. :)",2016-08-17 14:53:10+00:00,d6l6l12,1,t3_4y4pny,18339,Brawlhalla

320,"My thinking: not even the best players win 100% of their games, so when the time comes for failure the first thing I do is accept it. If I lost the game, that means I made a mistake somewhere. If instead of being mad at myself and the game (which still happens all the time, rage sure is natural), I watch the replay, or learned how I screwed up, then I improve, and become stronger in ranked. And if you simply learn how things went wrong, you might be able to reverse this salt on to your enemies instead, and become a better player every time. The way how I play this game can be narrowed down to even the smallest of moves. Usually losing the game is from... well.. dying first of course. So basically it comes down to this: if you get HIT by ANY move, then something probably went wrong. Maybe you tried to attack and missed, or maybe you didn't see something coming. Death is the result of making these mistakes over time and taking more damage than your opponent. 

If you can simply accept the failure, and learn how to do a better move in the future against whatever did damage to you, then you will improve immensely and enjoy the game. 

Of course you will always run into something else that stops you from winning, and even the diamond players can be amazed by the new moves they must learn to counter. 

Those who are higher in ranked have refined their knowledge THROUGH their mistakes. And this is why the top players are hard to defeat. They know plenty of ways to attack you, as well as the many moves they think their opponent is about to make.

If you are willing to learn how you lost, then you might not lose the same way in the future. 

Also, watch some videos for true combos on your favorite weapons so you know which moves to make in-game as well! :D

Spam them as you practice in training mode so that you really get them down! Try to sort them by damage or force so you know which ones to use in the early game or for executing your enemies so that there is as little indecision as possible as well.

tldr: learn as many combos as you can so you know how to attack your opponent :D! Instead of getting mad at the game, LEARN from the attacks that your opponent made on you that next time you'll have a much better chance. Learning from your mistake is how you can improve big time :).
