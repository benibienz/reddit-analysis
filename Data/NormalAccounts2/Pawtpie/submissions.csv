I come to the Brawlhalla community with a **small post** on my thought about the game from my amazing perspective. I’m going to start with weapons individually, then characters individually, as well as an analysis of each of their sigs. If you wanna get diamond one day then you need to read the entire thing.
Weapons from my perspective:

-----

**Sword** is like this mystical wand at this point. Ya got these magical thoughts surrounding it I find. There’s lotsa older players who picked up the sword and said “wow I’m going to main this”, but now it seems that this isn’t the case : (. That guy in top 10 who plays spear, Crockie, and a few others say that currently it’s not the best. If the sword was magic then where has the wizard gone??? Do a dlight and swing that sair. Do a dlight and gc that slight. Hell do a dlight and throw the sword and do an unarmed gc disco. You can do so much with sword with its swishy swooshy motions.  You play a dingus character like Hattori with 8 movement speed and then suddenly you got speed hacks. Sword is probably like that cool kid on the block with the leather jacket and the sunglasses and all that stuff where only exclusive people can get in kinda like the pre-ulgrim kind of cool where nothing was cooler until the ulgrim release because ulgrim is cooler. Also When you select a sword character it seems that each person has a specific direction in which you point the sword. I’m starting to wonder if there’s some secret society, you can probably find some kind of circular symmetry once you analyze all the picture pics. Sword lmao, I’ve been doing that stuff since back when I joined in November of 2015 or something like that stuff. You just take a sip of it before you do a sig of it and then it no longer becomes an acquired taste for your finger tips. The tips of my finger grasp a sword quite well I find, but new players I find go to the ding dang gauntlet gang now. 

-----
**Gauntlets MOTHER FUDGE ON MY ICE CREAM GAUNTLETS**. These weapons are the boom boom bang of the boomerang. The cha-cha slide of the thumbstick. There’s so so so so so many new players who play gauntlets I swear if I had a penny for each new player I’ve seen in this game who decided to main KOR, the MEME OF GIANTS, I’d probably have like a quarter at this point. What is it that draws new players to gauntlet characters who are also memes such as Kor? Do gauntlets make the user high as a kite. They are pretty cool to look at though compared to other weapons such as magical sword. Why use a swishy shwooshy when you can just GET UP IN THERE, GRAB THEM, DO THE KOR NEUTRAL, SEND THEM DOWN, WOOO, WOOOOOOOOOOOO. TOUCH DOWN. IT’S BRAWLBALL NOW. And then there’s that one gauntlet string that people can see coming from a mile away but it won’t matter because their life is slowly fading into black at that point as the salt reaches their eyeballs, you know what I mean. So many times I can do that string on a guy that matchmaking decided to put me with as Diamond vs Gold and they’ll just take their hands right off their controller/keyboard until they wait until the hell is over. One time I even saw some bringer dingus forget to come back and he fell off the stagerino, how lmao is that? It’s pretty lmao right? 

-----
**Katars** ok look. If you like winning in this game, then, here you go BADA BING, TAKE THE ZING! 

-----
**Spear DON’T YOU GUYS START GIVING UP ON SPEAR**. Why are you guys calling spear the new floppy spaghetti? I’m talking about the kind of spaghetti that’s 65 days old that no one wants to sprinkle their cheese on anymore. You guys are starting to reject spear like it’s the worst thing since apprentice Ulgrim! What you guys have to realize is that these are some of the best things in the game! I’m hearing all these pro pro players who are definitely gatekeeping me say stuff such as “oh man spear has gotten so many nerfs lmao” and “I remember the good old days of spear lmao” and “pawt pie is so damn hot lmao” BUT SPEAR STILL EATS MY SOUL ALIVE. Yo, yo, spear is still capable of doing one of those strings (you know what I mean) where they do some kind of neutral light, and then they dodge in, do a bunch of dlights, maybe even a gc sig on top LIKE HOLY GUYS. Spear isn’t bad! It’s super fresh! You know how spaghetti noodles are when they’re inside of the box? Completely straight and thin? I rest my case. 

-----

**Bow, HOLY SHIT BOW. I SUCK SO MUCH AT BOW AND IT’S NOT EVEN FUNNY**. Ok so listen up. PLEASE tell me some of you tippy toe sword mains can relate to my struggles. If you’ve been maining sword as your primary weapon, and then you go try bow, it’s like, someone took your clock, and switched the hour hands, shattered the glass, and spray-painted half of it black and turned the other half into a fish tank. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET TO WORK ON TIME NOW A THE NOODLE FACTORY? SPECIFICALLY with the neutral light oh my goodness the neutral light. I remember when I was first starting out in this game and ember was just released, the first bow character. I literally couldn’t do anything but use neutral light. And for many weeks after eating spaghetti noodles for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, you know how when an enemy runs into you when you have sword, you do a neutral light? Well if you USE that SAME REFLEX with a bow then you’re going to attempt to snipe the sky and get punished harder than Luigi trying to put on a red hat. It took me so, damn, long to finally figure out some of the spacing around the weapon, maybe some of the combos, the style point options, etc. BUT NONE OF THAT MATTERS STILL BECAUSE THE SPACING FOR ME IS IMPOSSIBLE I’M NEVER GOING TO BE GOOD. I’m that guy who does in for the dlight, and it’s either JUST too short or JUST too far away. I’m gonna have to throw lots of noodles on this one guys because although I suck at bow, it’s one of the most freshly brewed coffees since the dawn of time. 

-----

**Blasters** exdeedeedeedeedeedee. Katars and blasters are SO GOOD but your only option is Lucien so GG, (sorry Lucien mains &gt;: 3)

-----

**Axe YOU GUYS ARE RIGGING THE SYSTEM AGAINST ME I SWEAR TO BMG YOU GUYS ARE**. I remember back when I first started out in this game, my first main was Teros, the most beautiful character at the time with a hammer, and an AXE. Well as I continued to play and climb the ladder I was starting to realize that all of the other people who weren’t as cool as me that wish they were as cool as me weren’t playing axe at all, almost as if I wasn’t as cool as THEM??? I remember this perfectly, it was the week I stopped playing axe, right, I switched from my original Teros because “axe sux” to hattori or someone else who was hairy like Bodvar right. AND THEN JHALA CAME OUT AND EVERYONE SAID THAT AXE WAS SO GOOD ALL THIS TIME. I was like mind boggled I was like oh my goodness. It was like, imagine a world where spaghetti was some disgusting food to eat right? You love spaghetti, and you ate it for most your childhood right. Finally you fall to the conformity of society and start eating BEAN SPROUTS or whatever it is that everyone else is eating, and you give up on your noodle filled dreams. BUT THEN YOU’RE THE ONLY ONE SUCKING ON BEAN SPROUTS WHILE THE REST OF THE WORLD IS PREPARING THE PARMESAN CHEESE! WTF MAN. Neutral light is also good. 

-----
**Lance OKAY IM SO CONFUSED ABOUT LANCE**. IT’S GOOD, THEN IT’S BAD, THEN IT’S A NOODLE, THEN IT’S A LAMBORGHINI. When I was growing up, lance was the most disgusting, smelly, awful, hardest to grip thing since Ulgrim. I assumed that lance was like a locked dungeon chest where only like 6 people had the key. Most people I saw using lance at the time were just smoking some really nice stuff like I am currently, and said stuff like “WOW LMAO RECOVERY MAKES ME GO SOOOOOOOOOO HIGH”. NOW FAST FORWARD TO TODAY, lance is just this, it’s, IT’S LIKE KATARS THAT YOU CAN SIT ON.  I remember I was eating some nice popcorn that I just popped up and I was watching the BCS and I was listening to that guy who likes Ulgrim um, Sparky!. Yeah so anyways back when bow was the most broken thing since dropped noodles I remember a conversation broke out that was something along the lines of “yeah dude lance is the BEST weapon against bow it’s so good”. At the time I was all like, LANCE DOES SOMETHING OTHER THAN MAKE NOISES??? I think I went and played nothing but lance for a while afterwards, and you know, I could finally see what people were talking about : D. I was starting to gain a real good grip on the lance itself, it’s like you know how scarlet can sit on the side of her lance? Well I was surfing through the galaxy on mine I was doing flips, dips, sips, rips. But then BMG released that patch where you can’t throw a weapon and hit your opponent instantly so basically now my perspective on lance has since gotten, er, ah, YE,  WHAT THE F-.

-----
**Hammer. Hammer, hammer, hammer**. I really don’t know what kind of drug hammer is. To me it’s kinda like that one side choice that goes well with a steak, but sometimes you might want chicken which doesn’t necessarily aid the flavors. I don’t think I’ve ever met a hammer main, but rather just people who learned how to deal with hammer so that they could like every other thing about their character. Hammer is really big and really tall and probably really heavy. But apparently it’s good so I gotta role with that.
-----

When I get another shipment of drugs in I’ll analyze each of the characters individually to give you guys my overall impression of that stuff as well. I’m talking thatch, I’m talking kor, EVEN ULGRIM. Stay tuned like a water balloon and have a great day.

(players who utilize a passive play style I will assume will be the ones primarily in disagreement).** I am only posting it in case anyone can relate to it. That being said, please do evaluate how I review the characters as I am constantly changing my opinion.

I am very curious to see how the community relates to the list. 

The tier list is computed as follows:

First: **the list is primarily sorted by defense from least to greatest, with S-Tier beginning at 5.** I currently believe that defense is the least important stat **only if your play style is more aggressive than passive**. That being said,  it's still not useless, and a small amount of it is still necessary in order to utilize any of the other stats (glass cannons with 3-4 defense may be strong but not so much if you're not able to stay alive). Originally this list contained all 3 defense characters as S-Tier, 4 defense as A-tier. I have recently shoved them all aside into an exclusive section that is strictly reserved for high elo game play. It is essential to only play these characters only if you are capable of not getting hit by your opponent. **Only in that case, those characters are god-tier**

**Second:** secondary bias is placed on dexterity from greatest to least**

**Third:** final bias sorting is placed on mobility from greatest to least**

**Fourth**: I have specifically displaced Teros and Gnash for their minimal dexterity.

All characters below the ""line"" **characters that do not suit an aggressive play style, NOT, BAD CHARACTERS OVERALL**. 

**PLEASE ONLY COMMENT IF YOU ARE IN DISAGREEMENT WITH THIS LIST FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF AN AGGRESSIVE PLAYSTYLE, OR HAVE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM REGARDING HOW I SHOULD HAVE MODIFIED MY EVALUATION.**


Please also comment to let me know how this list relates to the characters that you play for various play styles as well. 


**I want this to be a discussion on how you ""tier-list""/decide upon the characters you play, hopefully with any relations to the list I have provided.** (just be sure to mention how your play style is though as well :) )

[Here is the list](https://puu.sh/s4fv4/87bf5ec47d.png) - characters are not generalized in each tier, they are SPECIFICALLY in order.

That's how I rate the characters in this game, how do you do it? I would love to know. Thanks :).

So recently I can't play any songs because i fail almost immediately.
After some experimenting for some reason my left tap button (z) acts almost as if it's delayed? I'm not missing notes entirely, but all are either 50s or miss. Meanwhile the right tap (x) works just fine. Just to prove it, I played songs with only z then only x. Failed almost immediately with z, had 400+ note combos with JUST x (although this was pretty fun here)


Now here is where things get REALLY weird. I swapped z and x to x and c, and then suddenly it was my new left key as x acting up and my right as c being just fine! I tried everything! It can't be the hardware of my keyboard i don't think because I tried completely different keys that worked great earlier. I reset my settings by deleting my config file. I made sure I wasn't in windowed mode, although a few moments before this i entered windowed mode for the first time ever.

My name is Pawtpie and most of you might know me from my youtube series but today I'm going to show you the other side of me. I'm going to teach you guys how to be pro in this game with the thing's I've learned that not too many others have picked up on. Last season I was diamond with 833 hours of gameplay. Max elo was 2003, and current elo was a solid 1781. 

I realize that by spreading the word about many of these tips there may be an increase in the amount of better players. However, I'm willing to take this risk as most might not be able to implement these tips successfully.

Lets just jump right into it!

---------

**Step 1:** The strings that no one ever talks about!

Every time I go online to play ranked I can't help but cringe at the sight of people who don't realize the potential of certain strings. The majority of these strings are going to be unarmed. **Just by simply following these strings you can take your gameplay to the next level**

I call these **the golden strings**.

**Unarmed**

**The dancing space man:**  jump &gt; gc &gt; disco

DON'T STOP READING. I know that some of you may be confused. This isn't even a string, I know. But it's perfect for taking your opponents off guard in *STYLE*. In fact, it's time to go over what I call **the golden rule**.

**The golden rule:** THE MOST IMPORTANT TIP TO BECOME DIAMOND IS THAT YOU MUST PERFORM YOUR MOVES IN STYLE SO THAT YOUR OPPONENTS AFK AND GIVE YOU THEIR ELO

This is ESSENTIAL for understanding the rest of the guide.


**The helicopter shuffle:** dlight &gt; jump &gt; gc &gt; disco

Similar to the dancing space man, but you will have a better opportunity to land the disco. I believe there's something like 10-20 dodge frames in between the gc and the disco, but that should be true enough for a 90% hit rate.

------

**Step 2:** Only use brown and pink for your colors.

I cannot stress the importance of this step. Keep in mind **the golden rule**. What will your opponents think when they see you wearing a weird color? Well I will tell you. The first thing that will come into their mind is that they realize that the color is *intentionally bad*. Then they will wonder why someone would intentionally make themselves look bad in the first place? They will put 2 and 2 together and realize that they are facing an opponent that is so good that they don't even need to *LOOK* good. Your opponent will realize that they are facing someone capable of over compensating for their bad colors in order to 3 stock if necessary. 80% of the time that I wear either brown, pink, or whatever color looks really bad on most characters, I see an 80% afk rate as according to my research.

------


**Step 3:** Throw your weapon to initiate the golden strings

This step is pretty much self explanatory. Throw your weapons to stun your opponents for a better opportunity to perform **the golden strings** (see step 1)


-----

**Step 4:** Spam ground pound whenever you can

Not too many people realize the potential of ground pound. There are many moves that may do more damage than a ground pound. However, ground pounds offer something that most other moves do not. **Ground pounds do decent damage WITH the aid of style points**. Just think about the golden rule. If you land consecutive ground pounds, what will your opponent think? You are styling on your opponent while getting decent damage in. It is moves such as these that will aid you with **golden rule thinking and implementation**. 


-------

**That's all for this guide! Thanks for reading!**

But just the key points:

1. **The golden rule:** THE MOST IMPORTANT TIP TO BECOME DIAMOND IS THAT YOU MUST PERFORM YOUR MOVES IN STYLE SO THAT YOUR OPPONENTS AFK AND GIVE YOU THEIR ELO.
2. Perform the strings that no one ever talks about, or, the golden strings.
3. Only use brown, pink, or any other ugly color for your character, especially in ranked.
4. Throw your weapon to initiate the golden strings.
5. Spam ground pound whenever you can for good style points and decent damage.

Not even the best players win 100% of their games, so when the time comes for failure the first thing I do is accept it. If I lost the game, that means I made a mistake somewhere. If instead of being mad at myself and the game (which still happens all the time, rage sure is natural), I watch the replay, or learned how I screwed up, then I improve, and become stronger in ranked. And if you simply learn how things went wrong, you might be able to reverse this salt on to your enemies instead, and become a better player every time. The way how I play this game can be narrowed down to even the smallest of moves. Usually losing the game is from... well.. dying first of course. So basically it comes down to this: if you get HIT by ANY move, then something probably went wrong. Maybe you tried to attack and missed, or maybe you didn't see something coming. Death is the result of making these mistakes over time and taking more damage than your opponent.
If you can simply accept the failure, and learn how to do a better move in the future against whatever did damage to you, then you will improve immensely and enjoy the game.
Of course you will always run into something else that stops you from winning, and even the diamond players can be amazed by the new moves they must learn to counter.
Those who are higher in ranked have refined their knowledge THROUGH their mistakes. And this is why the top players are hard to defeat. They know plenty of ways to attack you, as well as the many moves they think their opponent is about to make.
If you are willing to learn how you lost, then you might not lose the same way in the future.
Also, watch some videos for true combos on your favorite weapons so you know which moves to make in-game as well! :D
Spam them as you practice in training mode so that you really get them down! Try to sort them by damage or force so you know which ones to use in the early game or for executing your enemies so that there is as little indecision as possible as well.

tldr: learn as many combos as you can so you know how to attack your opponent :D! Instead of getting mad at the game, LEARN from the attacks that your opponent made on you that next time you'll have a much better chance. Learning from your mistake is how you can improve big time :).
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)/ PEP TALK. COMPLETE!
