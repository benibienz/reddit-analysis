132,"Sure.  I typically do monthly periodized training, where each week, volume decreases and intensity increases.  When I was doing BFR, my routine was basically like this: 

* Monday-Squats and Deadlift  
* Tuesday-Bench  
* Wednesday-lower body accessories  
* Thursday-bench  
* Friday-Squats and Deadlift  
* Saturday-slingshot bench  

For BFR, I added BFR squats on Monday, BFR fat grip rows Tuesday and Thursday, and BFR skullcrushers and curls supersetted on Saturday.  

For BFR squats, I wrapped high up on my thighs, and did about 25-30%1RM intensity for three sets of 15 every week.  

For BFR fat grip rows, I wrapped just below my elbows to train my forearms (my grip is fairly weak and tends to limit my deadlift).  So I used fat grips on the bar, wrapped my forearms, and did really light weight for 3x15.  

For BFR skullcrushers/curls, I wrapped high up on my upper arms and did ridiculously light weight skullcrushers and EZ bar curls supersetted, again 3x15.  

Between sets, I rested only about 30 seconds or so.  

I mostly relied on /u/gnuckols [Strengtheory Article](http://strengtheory.com/blood-flow-restriction-the-holy-grail-for-accessory-work/) on BFR for incorporating it into my training.  

I will say, at the start, BFR sucks worse than anything I'd ever done in the weightroom.  It can be incredibly painful.  Although my goal was always 3 sets, there were plenty of times I just straight called it quits after 2 sets.  

My advice: when starting out, go light.  Lighter than you expect.  Like, 15%1RM for 3x15.  Build up to 25%.  It doesn't actually take too long for you to adjust.  I'd say it starts to suck less after doing it for a while, but I don't think I'd say it ever got to be enjoyable.  

I would definitely incorporate it into my training again, especially while cutting.  I'm not doing it right now, but certainly will again.  

Oh, for materials: for my legs, I used Voodoo floss bands, for forearms and biceps/triceps, I used Slingshot wrist wraps.  I found the Voodoo bands to be far too long for my arms, but the wrist wraps I could get tight enough with only a few turns around my arms.  

Hope this helps!  ",2016-10-25 13:19:57+00:00,d96yvjb,4.0,t1_d96xs2a,1958.0,Fitness

241,"I'm a patent attorney.  I went to undergrad for engineering, then on to law school.  My starting salary after graduation was low six figures.  It's gone up since then by a decent amount.  Depending on what happens, it has the potential to slowly increase for the foreseeable future, or go way up (if I bag a big client, say).  

The bulk of my income is from my paycheck.  That said, I started investing when I was in middle school.  I opened my Roth IRA when I was 12, and when I would work during the summer, I'd put quite a bit of my money into it.  Likewise, while working in undergrad (as a TA), the lion's share of my earnings went into my Roth.  I didn't make much, but I think this did establish the right mindset for me.  

Currently, I'm maxing my contributions to my 401k, maxing contributions to traditional IRAs for me and my wife then rolling the contributions over into Roth IRAs for us (back door Roth), and maxing contributions into my HSA.  Part of my HSA is invested, and I have a decent amount just held in cash, just in case I need to pay some ultra emergency medical bill.  But the current plan is to pay medical expenses in cash, then reimburse myself when I'm 65 from the HSA.  I also contribute to a taxable brokerage account.  

Neither my wife nor I came from wealthy families, but we did have the benefit of parents who saved for our education.  So neither of us carried a debt load from school.  

Currently our only debt is our house.  We pay off credit cards every month.  We'll take out loans when we can get 0% interest for stuff like furniture, but typically just pay with ""cash"" (meaning, on a credit card that we then pay off by the end of the month).

Going back to their place, friend's roommate takes off running in some drunken rampage, so my friend tells roomie's friends, ""Uh, guess you can just come up to our place and go to sleep.""  

So they all go up to the room, the friends pass out, my friend stays awake.  He's out on his balcony talking to someone, facing toward the door so he can see inside.  At some point, he sees one of these guys get up and start wandering around in a drunken stupor.  He watches as this guy walks over to their coffee table, drops trou, and drop a deuce right in the center of this table.  My friend is watching, horrified, as he realizes this drunk idiot thinks their coffee table is a toilet, doing a Darth Vader ""NO!!!"" impression.  

So after the deuce has dropped, he throws open the door and screams at this kid, ""You have to clean that shit up!""  This wakes his friend, who was upstairs, and he runs down to start defending this guy's honor or something, yelling at my friend.  Meanwhile, the ""mad shatter"" as he came to be known, turns around still in an alcohol-fueled haze, picks the shit up in his hands, and carries it to the bathroom.  He then just barely crosses the threshold into the bathroom, eyes the toilet, and throws his shit across the bathroom, but just lips the rim of the toilet, so his log just sort of spirals and then flies off onto the floor.  

They finally got everything cleaned up and sanitized.  But my friend and his roommates just refused to use the coffee table anymore.  They ended up leaving it for the trash guys to take, and it disappeared.  But then they went to a neighbor's one day, and saw their table in these guys' living room, with food all spread out over it!  They just couldn't tell them, didn't have the heart.

375,"I used a rolled chuck roast.  I meant to snap pics of the actual meat, but got too distracted by my finger.  Seasonings were pretty basic, mixture of Lowry's, pepper, and garlic (about 1:1 Lowry's and garlic, then about 25% pepper).  Didn't involve any sauce, but the meat was really juicy anyway.  For temperature, I just started using a probe thermometer after about 4 hours.  I aimed for about 130 degrees internal, then took it off the heat and put it in a glass dish with tented foil over it for about 5 minutes or so.  

Turned out pretty well, but I'm sure there's plenty of stuff I could've done to make it even better.

377,"I got inspired by /u/praise_the_boognish and decided to smoke a roast yesterday.  Never done it before, but it didn't look too hard.  I stacked up some charcoal, threw in some hickory and mesquite, and... didn't know how to get it started.  I normally use a chimney starter.  So I just rolled up some newspaper, soaked it in starter fluid, stuck it under the end I wanted to burn first, and set it on fire.  

Now, I normally hang the lid of the grill on one side, the top grate on the other side.  The side with the grate hanging on it just happened to be the side I lit.  So after the charcoal started turning white, I went to put the grate back in the grill, and burnt the shit out of my finger.  It's not too bad, it still looks like a finger, but the skin feels... waxy?  As in, the same feeling as when you spill wax from a candle on your skin.  The top layer of skin feels like a shell, but I can still feel ""under"" that, I guess.  

So, medipots, on a scale of 1 to cancer, how likely is my finger to fall off?

When I first learned how, again it was by trial and error, but I started with just pushing my butt off the ground using my hands on the floor and just swinging back and forth (bring your knees to your chest, that helps).  Then I'd work on swinging further and further back.  Once I got past torso being horizontal/parallel to the floor, the rest was pretty easy, just keep pushing and extend.

Finally did in high school, and was able to do it until a year or two into undergrad.  Then I got fat and weak and wasn't able to do it anymore.  

One of my major goals when I started working out and getting back in shape was to be able to do this again.  Finally tonight after just a few glasses of wine and being bored/curious, I nailed it!  

Not actually sure whether or not OHP helps with this, but I think it must be at least semi-related, right?  ",2016-09-13 02:03:01+00:00,d7kfplj,1.0,t3_52i3ku,143.0,Weakpots

Does anyone have a link to that article, or know what I'm talking about?  I can't seem to find it.

541,"So glad to be practicing [autoerotic asphyxiation](https://www.instagram.com/p/BJ2qAxaBBRv/) again!  Seriously, haven't front squatted in over a month, and it's so fun.  

I'm gonna have to have a difficult talk with someone at work.  He's treated me with casual disrespect for a long time, which is fine, but now he's treating me with outright disdain towards junior associates.  We used to be friends, and I don't know what happened, but some switch flipped and now he apparently thinks I suck at everything (he may be right), but he could at least treat me like a human being.  All I really want is for him to know that how he acts makes me feel disrespected, I don't actually care if he respects me or not.  If at all possible, I'd like to get back to at least a cordial relationship.  I don't really know the best way to approach this though.  My current plan is to sit down in his office and just lay out my perceptions and feelings: A) we used to be friends, and now I feel constantly disrespected, B) I don't know what I did, if anything, to cause this change in attitude toward me, C) if there's something I did, I'd like to know and fix it, D) if possible, let's get back to a cordial relationship, or even friendship.  

On a happier note, I ordered parts to build a super badass gaming and streaming PC.  I don't expect to make anything out of streaming, but I have a few friends who like watching me play NMS, so I think it'd be fun if more people watched.  Even absent the streaming thing, though, I set up powerline Ethernet in my basement, and it's crazy fast (like 40 mbps), so to get the best connection for gaming, have to hook up there (or get another powerline Ethernet hook up, but not sure if that would work...)  Anyway, super excited for all that stuff to arrive so I can build it and see what it can do!  Happy happy feels!  ",2016-09-02 13:17:32+00:00,d76pa7j,1.0,t3_50sx0p,3698.0,Weakpots

| Squat | 395 | 445 | 395^2 | 50 |  
| Bench | 275 | 305 | 255^3 | 50 |  
| Deadlift | 445 | 505 | 445^4 | 60 |  

^1 I got as low as 180 for my meet, then had a recent week of indulgence and blew up 5 pounds.  Still working on getting rid of that.  

^2 I actually hit a 405 squat in this time period, so some progress was made.  I'm using my meet numbers, rather than my gym numbers, for this and bench though. 

^3 I hit a 280 bench in this time period, but bench completely fell apart in my meet.  Again, meet number, not gym number.  

^4 Fuck, when did /u/Jimrussle hit a 457 deadlift?  I'm back to officially official weakpot status.  

Okay, so looking at this makes me realize how little progress I made in this time period.  However, I did lose over 15 pounds and maintained my strength, or even gained strength in the gym, so that's something.  I should be back to hitting PRs by at least November when I'm eating at or above maintenance again.  

# Program  

Mostly followed what I've been doing up to this point, a hacked together version of the /u/gnuckols sample programs.  I kept doing them throughout my training, lost weight, maintained or gained strength.  Pretty happy to have lost 15 pounds in this time period, and I'm really starting to get happy with how I look (at least in terms of fatness, I could use more masscles).  

# Diet  

Nothing fancy, just kept protein around 1.1g/pound of LBM, and tried to maintain a caloric deficit around 500 to 750, depending on the week, my body fat percentage, and that kinda stuff.  

# Going Forward  

Lose/maintain through the end of October, bulk November - January (stop bulking if I get heavier than 203 or my bodyfat gets to 18%).  

For the next two months, do my cherry-picked-531 program, then go back to my previously applied version of the sample programs from GNucks.",2016-09-01 23:20:11+00:00,d762fgo,1.0,t3_50q1i4,1899.0,Weakpots

As an aside, I've also always been intrigued by Kote/Kvothe in WMF saying, ""Forgot who I was there for a minute.""  Is it in fact Kvothe saying he forgot he was Kote (meaning he could have taken the soldiers down, but since he's playing Kote, he had to take the beating), or is it in fact Kote saying he forgot he isn't Kvothe (meaning that he attacked the soldiers thinking he had Kvothe's powers, but since he's actually Kote, he couldn't take them)?

669,"&gt; I'm definitely not squatting enough to warrant using a belt  

First of all, forget that noise.  Use a belt whenever you want.  

You've already gotten a ton of advice, but here's a way to learn how to brace.  

Take a deep breath.  Now push it out.  All of it, all your air, push it out.  No, you still have air inside you, push that out too.  Okay, now that you've pushed all the air out, feel how tight your core is.  Keep that tight, but now take in a breath (it won't be a full breath, but just do what you can while keeping tight).  Then shove your tongue against the roof of your mouth and keep tight while both holding the air in but also trying to push it out through your mouth.  That's how you stay tight.

676,"For lower body, I find the VooDoo floss bands to be just about perfect.  They're way too long for arms, though, so I switched to using some SlingShot wrist wraps.  They are almost too thick, but far shorter than the floss bands, and work pretty well.  I've also tried using my forearm cuffs up over my elbows just below my biceps for forearm BFR work, and that works okay, but I prefer the wrist wraps.  

Being too tight is more in your control.  I've found that as long as you get several good, firm wraps in, it does the trick.  Just don't feel the need to really crank it down and you'll get the restriction you need.  For arms, just be aware of the [radial nerve](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_UzsGRLtk0hI/TLOXGiGXRnI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/9YkOAVlTzI8/s1600/rad1.gif), which is somewhat vulnerable just at the bottom of your delts.

681,"Doing very light 115 pound squats, but with blood flow restriction.  I don't know if that's a good idea this close to the meet or not, but I want to squat just to get moving.  Figure light weight/low stress is better than anything too heavy.  

I put together a bastardized 531esque program for after I get done with the meet.  It's pretty low volume, incorporates the ""heavier"" percentages of 531 and the rep scheme, and some accessories that I like.  Just gonna run that as long as it works while I finish leaning out.

Light bench session today.  Been playing a ton of No Man's Sky.  Just got up to 45 slots in my suit.  After fully upgrading that, I'm gonna make my goal getting a 48 slot ship.  

I really hope my home scales are accurate.  I weighed in at 183 exactly this morning.  By the end of the week, I should be under that for weigh-ins at the meet.  I really messed up the timing of this cut with respect to my meet, but a lot of that came from about two or three months of fucking around.  Specifically, I wasn't eating enough protein, so I was super hungry all the time, and stressed out, so I'd make it all the way to the end of the day and be under goal calories, then be too hungry and just splurge and eat.  So I spent that time not losing.  After I finally figured out my protein and got back on track, there was just too much lost time.  

If I do another meet, I'll either time everything better or lift in the higher weight class.  Still learning how my body works, I guess, so valuable lesson learned.  But still, I feel like I'd do way better on Saturday if I had been eating at least at maintenance for the last month, rather than continuing to cut right up to this week.  Bleh.  Still, feel like I'll be able to at least match, if not surpass, my gym PRs, so should be okay for my first meet.  ",2016-08-16 12:12:04+00:00,d6jkzqg,1.0,t3_4xytv9,6058.0,Weakpots

I had a pretty bad shoulder scare on Friday.  Dunno what I did, but Friday evening, all of a sudden any external rotation felt terribly painful.  It hurt to turn the steering wheel on Saturday while driving.  Throughout the day it felt a little better, and by yesterday it was pretty much completely better.  I just kept thinking, I hope I can bench.  Today it's perfectly fine.  Dunno what happened or what that was all about, must just be getting old :/.

It's a game about exploration and discovery.  And the crazy stories and experiences.  Short list for me of those experiences that keep me coming back:  

* As soon as I started, I got attacked by sentinels.  Had to destroy 8 of them in the first say 5 minutes of gameplay.  That was intense, difficult, and fun.   
* Discovering worlds with breathtaking scenery.  
* Exploiting the economic system to make tons of money in a short amount of time (described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/4x23c3/possible_spoilers_tips_how_i_bought_this_ship/d6brlnf)).  Dat arbitrage.  
* Learning words in the various races' languages, then seeing them appear as you talk to members of those races.  To the extent I may consider ""finishing"" the game, one of my long term goals is to get enough words in at least one race's language to be able to see exactly what they're saying.  
* Finding crashed ships, hidden resources, ruins, etc.  
* Solving puzzles at outposts.  
* Getting sucker punched by animals unexpectedly.  Wasn't exactly fun, but made for a hilarious experience.  

Each of those has a whole story to it that I love remembering and sharing, and that's what'll keep me coming back.  The ability to experience this stuff, and have stories to remember and share.  ",2016-08-12 14:38:15+00:00,d6eko5l,3.0,t1_d6ejn21,1461.0,Weakpots

715,"I was playing No Man's Sky this morning, and happened to come across a space station that was a gold mine.  I had a few things in my inventory, and just happened to find the space station after my first warp.  When I went to sell what I had, I just happened to notice that [this space station was buying Dynamic Resonators for a huge price markup](http://i.imgur.com/O8xfggS.jpg).  

As you can see in that image, there's a gold circled star next to Dynamic Resonator, and the price markup is over 100%.  Plus, it is buying them for over 50k credits.  When I first saw this, it didn't mean much to me, because I didn't have any Dynamic Resonators.  

BUT then I went back out to my ship, and saw another ship fly in and land.  I decided to see how much this ship cost, and what the pilot had for trade.  To my surprise, this pilot was [selling dynamic resonators at just a hair over market price](http://i.imgur.com/vixOiGe.jpg).  The image I linked shows an inventory of 0/0, but that's because I just bought him out.  It turns out, every pilot coming to this ship had at least one DR, most had three or four.  I have 11 slots open in my inventory, so I'd buy 11 of them, run into the terminal and sell them, netting me almost 30k profit per run.  

So at the end of the day, I was able to buy [this ship](http://i.imgur.com/8hxTRsG.jpg), and was able to earn the [Diamond Age Trophy](http://i.imgur.com/hyyuGuS.jpg), which is apparently very rare at this point.  

The point is, I guess, pay attention when stations or terminals are offering huge markups on products, and pay attention to what the locals are selling.  If you happen to find a huge price discrepancy, take advantage of it!  I recognize this is probably not totally repeatable, but I almost just flew off without even knowing what I'd found.  I actually left the first pilot I found without buying any DRs, because I had to double check that I was really about to earn that many credits that quickly.  

This was basically a dream come true for me this morning, because the biggest frustration I've encountered has been a lack of inventory space.  This ship had plenty of room to store my stuff and then some.  Hope it helps one of you!  ",2016-08-10 13:35:07+00:00,d6brlnf,1.0,t3_4x23c3,658.0,NoMansSkyTheGame

My best tested 1RM for squats is 405.  385 this morning felt really light and easy.  I'm incredibly pumped for that, because just last week I was killing myself with volume.  I even took an hour and a half bike ride yesterday, which I thought would've impacted my squat more than it did.  

I have been feeling like, if I could just hit 405 at my meet it'd be a miracle.  After today, I might push for 415 or 425.  If 385 felt that good after a week of beating myself up. two weeks of taper should make me feel even better, right?  

Had a fun weekend with family.  Saturday went to the county fair, Sunday took my older girl to lunch.  Next weekend we might go to the Irish festival (/u/NotJDholic pls advise).

Monday Squat 8x3 (sets x reps) @90% (dropping down to about 75% when I felt like I wasn't going to be able to finish triples)  
Tuesday Bench 8x3, same deal  
Wednesday Deadlift 8x3, same deal

Friday Squat 8x2 @92.5%  
Saturday Bench 8x2 @92.5%  

The next two weeks will be a taper, leading up to my meet.  Next week, drop volume but keep intensity high.  Week after that, drop intensity with the same volume.     

Prior to all that, it was basically a combination of Greg Nuckols programs that I sort of mashed together and bastartized.  I used his two day intermediate squat program but added a third day because lolvolume, used his two day deadlift program, and made up my own three day bench program including flat bench, incline bench, and slingshot bench.  

Progression is basically monthly periodization where intensity ramps up and volume decreases for primary lifts throughout the month, leading to the last week where you test 1RMs.  ",2016-08-06 23:46:58+00:00,d677roy,1.0,t3_4whrrz,9613.0,Weakpots

No one breathing down my neck for anything.  Very nice.  

I'm going to bench again today.  Another 8 sets, but doubles today.  Gonna make it a light day and only do 225 for triples, which I'd normally do for fahves.  My elbows were on fire Tuesday and yesterday, so just want to do some light work.  Saturday I'll bench again and go heavy again.  I really hope this supercompensation thing works!

795,"Not op, but I'll jump in and say I tried several cigars with my boss that I absolutely hated, before having one I truly enjoyed.  I forget what the ones I hated were.  But the first one I truly enjoyed was, I believe, a Macanudo Cafe.  

The quick story: we had a business retreat, and my boss went to a cigar shop and asked for some cigars that weren't too head spacey, good for beginners.  The shop clerk said he should get Macanudos, so he bought a box for us.  One of my co-workers and I shared one of them, and it was truly delightful.  That was the first time I really ""got"" the cigar experience and thought I could actually get into this as a hobby.  

After that, I tried a Camacho Connecticut, and liked it.  Then a Romeo y Julieta 1875, and really enjoyed that too.  

I think the best thing I did to explore was get a variety and try a bunch of different kinds.  I've found myself enjoying more on the medium-full to full end of the spectrum now.  

You might get a few samplers from somewhere like Cigars International.  I think the ""build your own sampler"" thing they offer tends to be better than their sampler packs, but I did find some really enjoyable cigars in the sampler packs too (among some that I hated).  But taste is so individual, it really just takes trying things to see what you like, what you don't, and then go from there.  

And I'm still quite new to this hobby, so take my advice with several large grains of salt.  ",2016-07-30 11:38:54+00:00,d5x2hpv,3.0,t1_d5wvy4f,21794.0,cigars

875,"LA meatup was definitely an amazingly fun time.  I'll quickly recap the events from my perspective:  

Flew into LA on Wednesday with my family.  I didn't stay at the house, fam and I stayed at a hotel nearby (within walking distance-ish).  Thursday, my family and I went to Disney.  I earned the most [ridiculous sunburn ever](http://i.imgur.com/I5BEkD1.jpg).  My older girl had a blast seeing all the characters she loves.  And I was super proud of her: we've been to Disney before, and she always says she's gonna talk to the characters alone, then we get close and she hides behind Mom.  Well this time, we saw Elsa and Anna, and she actually went right up to them and gave them hugs, didn't hide.  She didn't talk to them, but she did approach and give hugs, which is huge for her.  That was awesome.  

Friday lots of pots started arriving and checked into the house.  I hung out with fam at the hotel until the evening, then headed over to the house.  The first person I saw was /u/lukeswolewalker.  I reached to shake his hand, and he goes, ""We only hug here!"" and grabbed me in a huge hug.  A group of us headed over to Gold's.  I wasn't expecting to lift, so I was totally just in sandals, shorts, and a t-shirt.  Got yelled at by the staff for only wearing sandals, but they let me stay.  Saw /u/lmao0plaet set his squat PR.  Then headed back to the house, hung out for a while, ate pizza, had a great time.  

Saturday we lifted at BB, /u/thechungdynasty drilled me on commands, and I tested my openers (hit them all, squat was a bit shakier than I wanted but really sank depth on it).  That was my big goal for the day, just drill commands and test openers.  

Afterwards, I had some time, so I asked /u/robogirl2006 to show me some Oly stuff.  I learned a ton!  First of all, I learned that Oly is tough as shit.  Like I was legit unable to correctly clean 45 pounds.  No joke.  And Robo, you need to get a video of you dropping into the catch position, because that's the fastest I've seen anyone move in person, ever.  

BB was also hot as fuck!  It was seriously 101 degrees.  I think Jiffy might still have the snap-filtered picture to prove it.  After BB, we went for lunch, had a lot of laughs and great food.  Then went to the house and hung out on the beach.  I didn't have trunks, so I was just in my ranger panties in the ocean.  Then I headed back to see my family at the hotel.  

Sunday we met for brunch, hung out by the beach, swam, tanned, laughed, relaxed, had a good time.  Sort of split into different groups doing different things, some people left, some people stayed at the beach.  Met up with Luke and 0plaet for dinner with the family.  They played uncles to my younger daughter, which was pretty awesome.  

Okay, so I didn't fully capture just how amazing everything was, but seriously, it was all a blast!  Thanks again to everyone who came.  Had an amazing time!  ",2016-07-25 14:08:45+00:00,d5pz1go,1.0,t3_4uhjy8,20555.0,Weakpots

And it comes at a perfect time: training for my meet is going to be winding down due to tapering, and I need a good way of expending calories to keep up with the cut.  

Have weighed in consistently around 186 the last four days, so I think that's pretty good.  4.5 weeks out, and I need to drop 3 pounds or so.  Very achievable.  I've been at least maintaining my strength throughout, so hopefully it survives this last month, or even kicks up due to supercompensation.

Also, I somehow got caught up in this cultural nerdy phenomenon of Pokemon Go.  What's happened to me?  Oh, still a geek....  

In good news, I dropped about two pounds this week.  Mostly from walking all over trying to catch these virtual gerbils.  And not eating.  

I did hit 375 on squats for two sets of triples, then a double, on Friday, so that was fun.  Didn't deadlift at all.  Will do both squats and deads on Monday, banch on Tuesday, then take a bit of time off for LAMEATUP until Saturday.  

The next week (7/25) will be more maintenance, hitting my normal triples week.  The week after that (8/1), supercompensation with double the number of sets, for triples again.  Then I'll start my taper for the next two weeks, until competition on 8/20.  Sound like a solid plan?  ",2016-07-16 20:30:40+00:00,d5ewe08,1.0,t3_4t3kcb,47592.0,Weakpots

Personally, to simplify the whole thing, I'd scrap the rep ladder and just do this.  Start with a goal of 8 reps.  Add weight every day.  If you fail a set, make your new rep target one less than the number of reps you complete.  

So let's say 8 is your rep target.  You finish 7.  Going forward, make your new rep target 6.  

Then once you get down to a rep target of 1 or 0, drop the weight by 10-20% and start with a new rep target of 8.

Why do I hate deadlifting so much?  I truly look forward to squats.  I enjoy bench.  Deadlifts?  I dread them.

This weekend has been awesome.  We got some of those little poppers that you throw on the ground.  I did one or two, same as my wife.  Our daughters were outside.  I offered a few to my older daughter, she wanted nothing to do with it.  The toddler, though... she threw one on the ground and it popped, and she laughed her ass off!  So then we kept giving them to her, she'd pop them, and just laugh hysterically.  She did pretty much the rest of the box.  So funny!

At one point, we had bases loaded, zero outs.  Two outs later, bases still loaded, third strike.  The batter cranked one into right field!  Almost made it over the wall, but came down and was caught just in front of the wall.  I guess it's those sorts of situations that make it worth the wait.  

Lifting is going well, for the most part.

1078,"When I was in weightloss mode and just starting out, what motivated me was, ""Wow, I'm overweight and really should lose it!""  I thought about what I'd done to get where I was, which basically amounted to me not doing anything to prevent it.  

When things got hard or I just wasn't feeling like sticking to my calorie goal, or just didn't feel like working out, I'd remind myself that *not* doing those things was what got me to the point of being overweight.  

Also, I'm a big believer in, ""Plan your work, then work your plan.""  I personally like having a big, overarching, long term plan, then smaller plans within that big plan, to get to where I want to go.  Like, I'll plan out a year's worth of training, then plan out training month to month.  Once I have that in place, it's easier for me to just look at my calendar, and go, ""Yup, it's leg day today,"" and then I just do it because I'm working my plan.  

That's what works for me.  You have to find what works for you.  No one here can tell you what will motivate you.  You already have a goal, seeing it come to fruition should be your motivation.  ",2016-06-16 11:49:44+00:00,d4bgcsa,1.0,t3_4oat1t,38362.0,Weakpots

1. Start light.  No more than 20% of your 1RM for 3x15.  
2. Don't necessarily use the same wraps for all bodyparts.  For me, using Voodoo floss bands on my legs works really well.  Using them on my arms, though, gets way too tight.  Wrist wraps work way better for my forearms.

Order four hash browns, too. Now grab two packs of mayonnaise and put them on the hash browns and then slip them into the sandwiches. Squish that shit down and eat. That's your breakfast.  

For lunch you're gonna eat Chinese food. Now I don't want you eating that crappy stuff. You wanna get the stuff with MSG. None of that non-MSG bullshit. I don't care what you eat but you have to sit down and eat for at least 45 minutes straight. You can't let go of the fork. Eat until your eyes swell up and become slits and you start to look like the woman behind the counter.  

For dinner you're gonna order an extra-large pizza with everything on it. Literally everything. If you don't like sardines, don't put 'em on, but anything else that you like you have to load it on there. After you pay the delivery guy, I want you to take the pie to your coffee table, open that fucker up, and grab a bottle of oil. It can be olive oil, canola oil, whatever. Anything but motor oil. And I want you to pour that shit over the pie until half of the bottle is gone. Just soak the shit out of it.  

Now before you lay into it, I want you to sit on your couch and just stare at that fucker. I want you to understand that that pizza right there is keeping you from your goals.  

Now you're on the clock.  After 20 minutes, your brain is going to tell you you're full. Don't listen to that shit. You have to try and eat as much of the pizza as you can before that 20-minute mark. Double up pieces if you have to. I'm telling you now, you're going to get three or four pieces in and you're gonna want to quit. You fucking can't quit. You have to sit on that couch until every piece is done.

1248,"One thing you might want to try is pick out programming for each major lift from different programs, based on what you like and what you think will work for you.  

So let's say you want to do squats, bench, and deadlift.  Pick out programming for each lift based on programs that look fun for you.  

For example, if you want to bench a lot, use just the benching protocol Greg describes here: http://www.mensfitness.com/mensfitness.com/strongin4weeks  

Let's say you only want to deadlift once per week.  Maybe do 5/3/1 style training for deadlift one day per week.  

If you're still able to do linear progress on squats, do three days per week LP a la Starting Strength or SL5x5 or something like that.  

Different body parts don't necessarily need different days, so just mash these programs together the way that works best.  I'd try to keep deadlifts and squats on the same day, but there's no rule saying you can't squat and bench on the same day, and sometimes that's just necessary.  

So maybe give that sort of mashup a shot?  ",2016-06-03 14:18:37+00:00,d3uh0sj,4.0,t1_d3ug852,1224.0,Weakpots

It's a CSS thing, and a pretty well-known one at that. Kinda like how a few circlejerks change usernames to reflect a theme, except mirroring other subs cosmetically while the links direct to no-trying ass-clowns assuming you're using sterons (it's like creatine, I think, but I don't really pay attention to the shady side of the gym - if you're lifting heavier than me I'd guess you've heard of them). So this sub moves around whenever it gets deleted, and it's up to people shitposting in it and the users maliciously linking to it to get the admins' attention. I assume they report it to authorities, but these subs keep popping up. I miss the days when at least you knew /r/weakfags would be the shitty lifting meme sub instead of having to be wary of every sub you get linked to. Also, most of the links there will attempt to weakshame you if you don't have the requisite strength.

This is my favorite post on this site. I saw it the day it was trending on this sub but forgot to save it. Usually a guy sees a hot girl on the internet and forgets her.

I could remember some of the keywords in the title so I finally found it. And I went through the rest of the posts I'd missed all these days.  

Then it struck my why I couldn't get you out of my mind; you're not just the sexiest woman I've ever seen. You're the most beautiful one too. I don't think I'll ever see someone as gorgeous as you. There are girls, there are women. And then there are goddesses. Thank you so, so much for all your posts. Please don't ever stop posting.

1664,"Strongpot: Let me have your attention for a moment! So you're talking about what? You're talking about... bitching about that PR you could have had, some weight that doesn't want to go up, some lift that doesn't want to improve, some program you’re trying to finish and so forth. Let's talk about something important.  

Weakpot: *picks up pre-workout*  

Strongpot: Put that pre-workout down! Pre-workout's for tryers only.  Do you think I'm fucking with you?  I am not fucking with you.  I'm here from /r/Strongpots. I'm here from IPF Worlds.  And I'm here on a mission of mercy. Your name's Weakpot?  

Weakpot: Yeah.  

Strongpot: You call yourself a lifter, you son of a bitch?  

Weakpot: I don't have to listen to this shit.  

Strongpot: You certainly don't pal. 'Cause the good news is -- you haven't tried trying. The bad news is you've got, all you got, just one week to start trying, starting tonight. Starting with tonight’s workout. Oh, have I got your attention now? Good. 'Cause we're adding a little something to this quadrimester’s spreadsheet contest. As you all know, first prize is bragging rights. Anyone want to see second prize? Second prize is some comment karma. Third prize is you're banned. You get the picture? You're laughing now? You got programs. The /r/fitness FAQ points you to them. Get the spreadsheets and follow them! You can't follow the programs you're given, you can't follow shit, you ARE shit, hit the bricks pal and beat it 'cause you are going out!  

Weakpot: The programs are hard.  

Strongpot: The programs are hard? Fucking programs are hard? You haven't tried trying. I've been trying for fifteen years.  

Weakpot: What's your name?  

Strongpot: FUCK YOU, that's my name! You know why, Mister? 'Cause you did Starting Strength three days a week.  I lift six times a week, some days twice. That's my name!  And your name is ""you're wanting."" And you can't play in a lifter’s game. You haven’t tried trying.  And you go home and tell your groce grill your troubles.  Because only one thing counts in this life! Try trying! You hear me, you fucking weakpots?

Strongpot: A-B-T. A-always, B-be, T-trying. Always be trying! Always be trying! A-I-D-A. Attention, interest, decision, action. Attention -- do I have your attention? Interest -- are you interested? I know you are because it's fuck or walk. You try or you hit the bricks! Decision -- have you made your decision to try?! And action. A-I-D-A; get out there! You got the gains comin' in; you think they came in to get out of the rain? Guy doesn't walk into the gym unless he wants to try. Sitting out there waiting to work for it! Are you gonna try? Are you man enough to try?  What's the problem pal? You. Weakpot.  

Weakpot: You're such a hero, you're so strong. Why you coming down here and waste your time on a bunch of bums?  

Strongpot: You see this bench? You see this bench?  

Moss: Yeah.  

Strongpot: I worked harder for this bench than your deadlift. I made 50 wilks points last year. How much you make? You see, pal, that's who I am. And you're nothing. Nice guy? I don't give a shit. Good father? Fuck you -- go home and play with your kids!  You wanna shitpost here? Try!  You think this is abuse? You think this is abuse, you cocksucker? You can't take this -- how can you take the abuse you get in the gym?! You don't like it -- leave. I can go out there tonight with the programs you got, make myself ten wilks points! Tonight! In two hours! Can you? Can you? Go and do likewise! A-I-D-A! Get mad! You sons of bitches! Get mad! You know what it takes to try trying?  It takes ass posts to try trying.  

Strongpot: Go and do likewise, pots. The gains’re out there, you lift the weight, they’re yours. You don't--I have no sympathy for you. You wanna go out on those workouts tonight and try, try, the gains are yours. If not you're going to be regressing. Bunch of losers sitting around in a bar.  ""Oh yeah, I used to lift, it's a tough racket.""  These are the new programs. These are the Strengtheory and GZCL programs. And to you, they're gold. And you don't get them. Why? Because to give them to you is just throwing them away.  They're for tryers.  I'd wish you good luck but you wouldn't know what to do with it if you got it.  And to answer your question, pal: why am I here? I came here because GNucks and GZCL asked me to, they asked me for a favor. I said, the real favor, follow my advice and ban your fucking ass because a not-tryer is a not-tryer.

Anyway, I don't think 1 day / week of lowbar is enough to get the form down, so I've added a few sets to front squat day, just to practice the movement.

In light of [this](http://strengtheory.com/the-new-approach-to-training-volume/), I don't think of them in terms of ""how many reps do I need,"" but instead, just do them with something that feels heavy and get relatively close to failure.  Progression is increasing the number of sets over time (to some point), then trying to do more reps.  If I get [close to 15 reps](http://www.strengthandconditioningresearch.com/hypertrophy/#2) and still not at failure, the weight's too light and it's time to use something heavier.  

This sort of flies in the face of the way I prefer to program, which is lay out weights, sets, and reps ahead of time and follow that plan strictly, but it seems to be in line with the research.  ",2016-05-11 17:29:41+00:00,d31js9s,2.0,t1_d31cjcj,9312.0,Weakpots

Tell me why you need a slightly used barbell.  I’ll be selecting a winner based on my own completely arbitrary judgment.  However, that judgment can and almost certainly will be influenced by the number of “wow this”’s your comment receives.  So if you don’t need a barbell and want to participate in this thread, reply “wow this” to the needy Weakpots who you think deserve the barbell!  (Feel free to “wow this” as many or as few responses as you’d like).  

Suggested (but by no means required) topics for discussion:  

* How awesome homegymmasterrace is  
* How long you’ve wanted a home gym  
* How incomplete your home gym is without a slightly used Chan bar  
* How you’re looking to become less weak, and “muh excuse” is lack of a home gym/barbell  
* Willingness to post ass  

I’d like to ship this thing off by the end of the month, so let’s say have your response posted in this thread by May 26.  I’ll try to ship the barbell on that Saturday the 28th.   I’ll PM the winner on the 27th.  I can cover shipping if you’re in the US, but if it’s international I’ll probably need you to chip in.

1915,"You guys, I just realized I'm a big dum dum.  Way back when, I got two Rogue bars: a Matt Chan and an Ohio bar.  I use the Chan for squats and bench, and the Ohio for OHP.  I switch between the two for deadlifts, but typically use the Chan.  Last month, I used the Ohio bar, and deadlifts felt amazing.  [Today I used the Chan,](https://www.instagram.com/p/BFBta0uThQu/) and they felt horrible.  

I *knew* this, but it didn't really click until today: the knurling on the Chan bar starts wider than a normal bar, like the Ohio.  So I either need to have a finger or two on the smooth, or essentially do a wide grip deadlift to get all my fingers on the knurling.  Either way, my grip suffers.  

It finally clicked that I'm just dumb and should've been using the Ohio bar this entire time.  I think I originally got the Chan for that exact feature because I didn't want to skin my shins up.  But my stance is narrow enough that I can use a normal-width-knurled bar (and in fact should be, so I can actually hold onto it).  

Anyway, no more Chan bar for deadlifts.  That's all.  ",2016-05-05 13:52:33+00:00,d2trxpn,2.0,t1_d2tq6lp,3046.0,Weakpots

That pile of shit first post i made on my laptop while seating in my back garden got published on several big time websites, youtubers were already reacting to it, this was the goal, and to see how far it can go…the ultimate price, national/international news. I was on top of the world man, the karma was flawing, the buzz was majestic, and this last post was the knock out punch. Now…i admit, I got a bit cocky on this one. I didn’t even photoshop it that much cause I was tired and frankly speaking I thought u dickfarts are so fucking retarded, you wouldn’t realise it. But I underestimated you…you only, not the other turds. The karma was juicy on this one, 50 upvotes in less than an hour, and a few reposts were being made on Instagram. But… you got me good, it hurts im not gonna lie, but i will recover as I always do here. I’m not gonna had off to the jew, science, or maybe christian subreddit and fuck with those nutsacks…hopefully my bullshit will make it into the big networks easily over there.

Based on stuff I've read by Greg Nuckols and JTSStrength (such as [this article](http://www.jtsstrength.com/articles/2014/08/12/peaking-powerlifting/)), my plan for peaking is basically the following:  

1. Three weeks out, double up volume on what would normally be 85% intensity (meaning, double the number of sets) for triples.  
2. Two weeks out, leave intensity at 85%, but cut normal volume (number of sets) in half.  
3. Last week/meet week, do singles at 85% (as my planned openers) and a set of triples at 75% early in the week, and essentially no lifting middle to end of the week (meet on Saturday).  This will include squat/deadlift on Monday, bench on Tuesday, and one more bench session on Thursday.

# Muh Excuses  

I've already talked this to death, so the short short version:  
1. Tried to cut  
2. Ate too much  
3. Got frustrated  
4. Skipped lifting  
5. Made no progress in cut or lifting, which led to  
6. Eating more and skipping more lifting  
7. Finally said fuck it, went on vacation, intentionally did not track calories or lift.  Gained weight, but came back mentally refreshed.  
8. April happened, and I made actual progress.  

# Program and plan for going forward  
Restarting cutting.  I think a big thing I failed in my previous attempt at cutting was not getting enough protein.  I went with .82g / pound bodyweight, but I don't think that was enough.  I constantly felt hungry.  In April, I raised my protein goal to 1g/pound bodyweight, and felt so much fuller and better, even though I was eating fewer calories.  Lesson learned.  

Programming wise, back to the Greg Nuckols style sample programs.  Two upper body days, two lower body days.  I'm also not doing cardio because I think that was really killing my recovery.  Might reintroduce it in June depending on how May goes.  

I had been doing three full body lifting days, three days of cardio (elliptical).  I think that really killed my legs and I got to the point where I just wasn't recovering adequately, which led to my loss of motivation and eating.  Giving myself more recovery time will, I hope, help me stick to the cut better.  We'll see.  ",2016-05-01 16:08:57+00:00,d2oio0x,1.0,t3_4h94tf,7616.0,Weakpots

2016,"I just checked, and my first post to the sub was about 10 months ago.  I've really enjoyed, and continue to enjoy, posting here, watching everyone progress, and generally having a place where we share a common interest, but don't take ourselves too seriously.  

I definitely think we as a community should continue to call out excuses-making like blaming l e v e r s or muh genetics for one's shortcomings.  But in my experience, that's been done.  I think just about everyone here knows that if you're not progressing, you probably just need to work harder.  Reminding each other of that is good too.  

Since this has been talked about recently, I guess I'll just throw out my thoughts and hopefully they make sense.  Here, I think the common theme is ""I'm weaker than I want to be.""  I think expressing that idea through jokes, memes, and what have you is perfectly fine, and in fact, perfectly in line with what this sub is all about.  

The problem that can arise with this attitude is complaining about being weak *when you're not doing something about it.*  That can manifest in the form of excuses, laziness, distraction, or doing something stupid and counterproductive.  

Personally, I tried hard to avoid complaining about not making progress for the last few months, because  I wasn't doing much of anything about it.  How can I expect to progress if I'm skipping weeks of lifting at a time?  

Anyway, this is getting long and rambly.  I think the sub is in great  shape, and will continue to be so long as we keep it fun and aren't afraid to call out excuses.  ",2016-05-01 13:46:59+00:00,d2oe9iq,1.0,t3_4h8goh,14625.0,Weakpots

2053,"I just went through this from like January through March.  It was a slow decline.  I was trying to cut, but was super stressed out so I'd end up eating, so I wouldn't lose weight.  Then I'd change my program to try to accommodate more food, but would just eat more.  Then I'd miss a day or two and just say fuck it for the rest of the week.  And that slowly devolved into basically not lifting throughout half of February and almost all of March.  

I think I did enough to maintain some peak strength, but it took about the first two weeks of this month to get back to feeling normal.  Then last week felt great, and this week I set PRs.  That said, I could've been setting PRs that entire time and been much stronger by now.  

I think I did need the break to some extent mentally.  But I ended up heavier than when I started my cut with about the same BF%.  So it's a lot of wasted time, although I feel a lot more ready to work hard now.  I've also started adjusting to the rhythm of my work again, so I feel like I can balance lifting, work, and the rest of my life again.  

Not sure if that's helpful, and I'm still sort of in a haze about how I let it devolve.  ",2016-04-29 16:53:26+00:00,d2m9mgz,2.0,t1_d2m6ra2,3761.0,Weakpots

BUT way, way back when I was doing it 3 days per week consistently, I definitely improved.  For example, on the roll-over V-sits, I was able to roll back and put the balls of my feet on the ground, and on single leg hamstring stretches I could hold my extended foot with the full lengths of the fingers of both hands.  I definitely cannot do either of those things now, so there's been some regression.  

I go for massages occasionally too, and my massage therapist will yell at me for not foam rolling my legs when I haven't been (without me even telling her).

Personally/anecdotally, after I got done with SS (and I was also losing weight at the time), I fucked around with several different programs, before settling on an upper/lower split.  I've tried going back to full body lifting in a day, and I just get too wiped out from it.  YMMV, but there are several intermediate programs based around that type of split. [Candito's 6 week program](http://www.canditotraininghq.com/free-strength-programs/), [531](http://blackironbeast.com/5/3/1/calculator), PHAT, and PHUL are probably most popular.  Of those, Candito's or 531 are periodized, and per the Strengtheory link above, periodization has been shown to be beneficial to pretty much everyone.  

May want to try a few different things out and see what your body responds best to, and what you enjoy the most.  That is, you might be happier with a split like those, or you might respond better to a TM/Madcow full body style program.  ",2016-04-26 23:08:00+00:00,d2ilmls,3.0,t1_d2iknfc,1456.0,Weakpots

In other news, I achieved a major PR!  ^^^In ^^^Super ^^^Metroid.  Got the fastest time I've ever been able to achieve, 1:41 (gametime) with 100% completion.  

So in my return to training, I dropped my training maxes by about 10%.  Yesterday I was supposed to do three sets of 90%1RM squat singles at 345.  I decided to up it to 365, and it went really well.  That was good.  

I also crushed my 5x6 deadlifts.  Had been feeling completely wiped out after 3x6 two weeks ago and then 4x6 last week, but felt great yesterday.  So, operation get-work-capacity-back is working.  

Oh, and I was invited to participate in the USAPL Twin Cities Open this year.  That is, I ""Liked"" the Facebook page for it and I suspect everyone who did got an invite, but still.  I'm not 100% sure if I'll do it.  I mean, it could be fun, but on the other hand, I'm not that strong and not that competitive of a person.  I dunno.  Registration isn't open yet.  I may have to do it at least this one time, just to see how it goes.  Can I really get into decent shape by 8/20?  And I'm 195ish right now; should I bulk up to 205, or cut down to 183?

I started with finding a weight that felt reasonably heavy, e.g., something like an 8RM (although I didn't actually test it, just worked up to about 5 and thought, yeah, that felt like an RPE 7).  Then after my actual DL max advanced, I'd increase the weight for SLDLs by about the same amount-ish.  

I didn't do them for a long time (just a few months), but I think that did help my hamstrings.  May or may not be the best way to use them.  ",2016-04-18 20:07:55+00:00,d27y4xx,2.0,t1_d27upsg,4463.0,Weakpots

So ""how much"" protein powder to take is enough to get into that range if you haven't gotten enough from your other meals.  Can also use it earlier/throughout the day if you plan out your meals ahead of time.  

For example, I have two scoops in the morning with breakfast pretty much every day.  Typically that's enough with my diet, but sometimes I'll be 20ish grams of protein short, so I'll have another scoop before bed.

I always say don't be afraid of failure, because how far can you really fall? You found out - to the ground. It's right there. Now you know it isn't anything that should scare you.  

You should be proud that you weren't afraid - not embarrassed that you failed. You could have made excuses not to walk into the door, but you didn't. You knew it would be hard, and it would be uncomfortable, and it might be awkward - and you did it anyway. That's courage.  

I'm proud of you.  

The last guy I rooted for broke a world record in the deadlift. You have more in common with him than you think.  

First, he started out lifting just the bar, too (when you look at him, he may have been 3 months old at that point). Second, imagine his courage. He walked up to that bar in front of a big audience and television cameras, knowing that not only had he never lifted that much before - NO ONE on earth had - and it was highly likely he would completely fail. You may not think about it this way, but you showed that courage, on a smaller level.  

Finally, I'm rooting for you, too. You took the first step and you fell, but at least you fell in the right direction, so get back up and take the next step. Keep moving forward.",2016-04-12 12:06:30+00:00,d1zomp1,2.0,t1_d1zok1h,182.0,Weakpots

2427,"&gt;unsure about weight 

The mildly snarky answer is, whatever weight is challenging but doable in that rep range. If you're unsure, start where you are and add 10 pounds or so every workout.  That's linear progression.  As a beginner to squats and deadlifts, you should be able to continue that progression for several months.

&gt; IMO: there is no need to go above 5-6 reps on a deadlift ever. Form almost always breaks down after 4-5 reps as it's a full body movement and one area of your body is going to begin to fail before your bigger/stronger muscles such as legs/glutes/etc.

The other thing I see is that you take a million steps to get set: you actually go back, then forward.  Not a problem with form per se, but if you were doing a 1RM attempt, that'd be a lot of wasted energy.  Try to get into a two or three step max routine: 1 or 2 steps back, 1 step to the side to set your width, then squat.  Then just keep that routine forever, so that when you go for a 1RM, it's habit.

Let's just say that on your mustiest day, your farts would smell positively dry compared to hers. When she cut one, it was like being in a British dungeon wearing day old wet socks. It was like opening up a mildewy book in the basement of an abandoned house. It was like taking a submersible through the wreckage of the titanic with two pieces of mold plugged into your nostrils. I'm talking MUSTY. Plumbers would come in to the house and tell us that we had to tear the whole house down, as it clearly smelled of water damage. We'd just chuckle and say, ""Nope. That's just grandma."" They wouldn't believe us because her farts were silent, and it started a lot of fist fights.  

Unfortunately, she resented the title of Queen of the Musty Farts. Every time there was an article in the paper or a feature in the local news about her, she refused to even acknowledge it. We'd say, ""Nana, look, they're talking about how you're the Queen of the Musty Farts,"" and she would just grumbled and look at her knitting, and maybe rip a few must-bombs to show her dissatisfaction.

It's a CSS thing, and a pretty well-known one at that. Kinda like how a few circlejerks change usernames to reflect a theme, except mirroring other subs cosmetically while the links direct to kiddie porn assuming you're using some tool (it's like TOR, I think, but I don't really pay attention to the shady side of the net - if you're tech savvy I'd guess you've heard of it). So this sub moves around whenever it gets deleted, and it's up to people reporting it and the users maliciously linking to it to get the admins' attention. I assume they report it to authorities, but these subs keep popping up. I miss the days when at least you knew /r/creepshots would be the disgusting borderline sub instead of having to be wary of every sub you get linked to. Also, most of the links there will attempt to install some nasty viruses on your computer if you don't have the requisite tool.

2522,"5'9 manlet reporting for manlet-ness  

So far being partner has just meant more meetings and more emails.  Can I give it back?  I'd kinda like to give it back.  

In my cutting quest, I'd been trying to do full body lifting one day, then elliptical the next day, and alternate for six days (so three days full body lifting, three days elliptical training).  That's what I did to lose 40 pounds a little over a year ago, so I figured it'd be a good way to proceed when cutting now.  

I've decided that's an incredibly bad way to proceed, at least for me and where I'm at.  Back when I was squatting bodyweight for a 1RM, my legs could take that work.  Now, though, I think I need more recovery time.  I found myself feeling completely exhausted, so then I'd skip a day, then two, then three, then just give up for that week and move on to the next week.  

So now I'm moving back to just lifting, no elliptical.  Gonna give upper/lower split a try, alternating upper and lower body days.  I was doing that before I started cutting, and it was working well, so I'll just go back to it.  I'm really detrained at this point, though, so need to rebuild work capacity.  

Still going to attempt to cut, but just for this week.  Next week I'm gonna live my vacation up, not count calories, not exercise, just live.  I think I'll be nice and rested up when I get back, and ready to start actually training again.  ",2016-03-22 16:02:02+00:00,d199615,1.0,t3_4bgok9,24744.0,Weakpots

2689,"Make sure to get cardio! You're building muscle up under any fat you might have, which is AWESOME. But for it to show, you've got to do some cardio. Lifting weights doesn't burn fat really, it just builds a lot of good strong muscle. I'm sure you're stronger.  

Tracking calories is nowhere near as good as lots of cardio. You need to eat a lot/enough to fuel your weight lifting. Running and, more importantly, playing sports, will help you shed the fat and uncover the muscles.  

You've basically gained fifteen pounds of muscle which is frickin' sweet, and you should be real real proud. Start going for mile runs and get your friends/family together for a game of fun, casual but competitive soccer at the park.  

I actually had the exact same experience as you. I weight lifted and nothing else, and I just got bigger. Got freaked out and lost all the gains I'd made. Now I'm doing it right; cardio and weights. Wish I hadn't stopped and lost my muscle  

DON'T BE AFRAID OF GETTING BIGGER! As women we're told we need to be small and petite; screw that I want to be able to defend myself! Gaining fifteen pounds is absolutely nothing but awesome; just gotta add that high intensity cardio (short bursts of high speed are the best, which is why sports are so awesome) to burn some fat and lean out.

2690,"You'll just have to believe me when I say, my personality is well-developed. My strongest feature is my, not only good sense of humor, but quick sense of humor. I'm not a stupid or unlikable person, that's never been my problem. My issue #1 is getting sucked in the role of being the Court Jester, so I basically provide entertainment to all the other Bros picking up women, but at the end of the night, I go home with nobody.  

I've always convinced myself ""Women don't really want 1-night stands, don't really want meaningless sex - even if they say they do."" I had no idea of the sheer numbers of women who want just that. Who already have 'boyfriends', or who already have tons of orbiters to buy them gifts/spend time with them, etc., and they're just looking for a good fucking.  

I've got a simple test for how your body looks, my dude. Pretty straightforward.  

1) Imagine you take your shirt off at a party. Is it a funny joke? Do people clap and laugh? Does nobody notice? Or do the men snicker, while the young women Ooh and Ah? Are the women rubbing your stomach and laughing, or touching your pecs/shoulders looking mesmerized? Is the funny joke mostly over after 30 seconds and women go back to ignoring your shirtlessness, or do you get women approaching you for the rest of the night commending on it, touching you, initiating dances, etc?  

I've seen this test in person, plenty of times. I know how women react to a body they covet, and how they react to one they think is a joke. No, if you're fat/skinny, it's not too much to overcome. You don't even have to overcome being average, per se. But you can't negotiate desire. If you can get a woman to desire you before she ever speaks to you, before she even looks into your eyes, you've accomplished something maybe 10% of the male population is able to do - if that.  

Most men just have this ""Women Are Wonderful"" thing ingrained into them, so think women couldn't possibly be 80% attracted to bodies/scent/posture/etc and only 20% to intelligence/humor. Then you have the more insidious crowd, who believe in a sort of a caste system where you're just ""born"" to be good with women, and if you aren't, better luck next lifetime. Oh, and the ""proof"" of if you're good with women? Reaching age X with Y amount of partners. There's no logic involved there, it's all machismo and bravado.  

TLDR - How many men do you know have had 1 night stands with attractive, in-shape women? **REGARDLESS OF PERSONALITY**, How many were built like the DJ from Hustle and Flow? How many weighed 300lbs? How many were built like Chris Pratt? I rest my case.",2016-02-05 22:01:00+00:00,czpbyag,1.0,t3_44atsy,30418.0,Weakpots

Good feels:  I think I did a pretty good job of working the room, talking to lots of new people, identifying those who would provide mutual beneficial relationships, moving on when there wasn't going to be mutual beneficial relationships.  

Bad feels: One guy was really, really pushy on following up with me.  It was... awkward.  He sold a very particular type of insurance that has nothing to do with me or my interests or anything.  But he was like, ""Let's meet this day, this time!""  I'd say that probably won't work.  ""Oh, then let's meet this other day, this time!""  Again, I'm really busy, I don't think that'll work.  He just kept pushing and pushing and I really wasn't prepared for that... didn't know how to respond.  My midwestern politeness hasn't prepared me for how to tell someone to fuck off.

Pullups are coming along really nicely!

3206,"A few years ago my family and I took a week-long vacation, which is exceedingly rare.  We went to LA so my daughter could see Disney.  

So we get in, first night is rough but tolerable.  Drove to brunch the next morning.  I *distinctly* remember ordering eggs benedict, for reasons to follow.  

Get back to the hotel after breakfast, and I had some work to do, so I worked while my wife and daughter relaxed and played.  I worked for about 3 or 4 hours, then got pretty tired, so I took a nap.  

The hotel we stayed at had a pick up for a local bus route that would take you all around the area.  The place we went to brunch was the first or second stop from our hotel, and the buses went in a loop in one direction.  We'd seen a few other restaurants in the area, so decided to take the bus back for dinner.  

I remember feeling a bit out of it, but I'm not much of one for naps, so I thought it was just that post-nap haze.  Yeah... should've listened to myself.  

We take the bus thing over to the restaurant area we'd had brunch at before.  There were plenty of restaurants in the area, so it'd be easy to choose something.  We had figured we could either take the bus back and see the sights along the loop, or walk back, it wasn't that far, about a mile or so.  

So, we get on the bus, arrive, and find a restaurant with an outdoor patio.  Looks great.  There's about a half hour wait.  

We wait, and wait, and wait, in this waiting area that is hot and muggy and crowded, and I start feeling worse.  Truly, terrible.  Not sure what's going on, but definitely out of sorts.  I couldn't quite figure out what, but I knew, something needed to get out of my body in the near future.  I head to the restroom... and all the stalls are occupied.  

Well, no problem, I can wait.  So I go back to the hot gross waiting area.  Wait about 5 minutes, and now something *definitely* needs out of my body, and it's coming out my mouth.  Go back in the restroom, and all the stalls are STILL full.  

I head back out and tell my wife I'm heading around the corner to a public restroom I'd seen on the way to the brunch place.  Now, this is about a 5 minute walk away, but A) the stalls didn't seem to be emptying anytime soon, and B) I wasn't exactly thinking rationally.  

So I head out, sort of fast walking to get to the restroom.  I'd made it about 30 yards, and felt the distinct feeling of puke in my throat.  Turned around and ran to a garbage can right outside the restaurant.  

I make it just in time, and puke harder than I ever have before.  Seriously.  My stomach clenched and just unleashed.  It was so hard, actually, that my ass opened up in my pants too.  Right there on the side walk, grown ass man puking and shitting his pants.  

Felt quite a bit better, but now I've got a ridiculous mess.  So I head off to my original target, the public restroom.  

I get there, and IT'S also completely full.  WTF, LA guys?  So I stand there, shitty underwear and all, until a stall opens up.  Just as it does, another guy was coming in making a bee line for the stall.  Fuck you buddy, this is way past an emergency, I jump in and slam the door.  

Tear off my pants and underwear, and let loose another episode of bowel lava.  Turned around to puke, just begging my body not to let loose at both ends again.  Fortunately I'm able to contain it, but do the back and forth puke-and-shit dance for several minutes.  

Finally, I'm fairly certain that I'm completely empty in all areas of my bowels, so I put my jeans back on and just toss my underwear in the trash.  Head back to the restaurant.  

Family still hadn't gotten a table, but it's not like we're eating there anyway.  I tell my wife we really need to leave, and we do; she'd seen the puking episode out in front of the restaurant.  BUT now we need to get back to the hotel.  So, we can either wait for the bus, and then wait for it to complete its loop, or we can walk.  We waited for about 10 minutes (felt like hours), no bus came.  So we hoof it.  

I don't remember exactly how long it took, but I do know we had a young kid, old enough to walk a bit, but young enough that she was slow and needed carrying occasionally.  So we had to take turns carrying her, because she's heavy.  

We got about 100 yards from the hotel, and I just told my wife I'll see you both inside, she said k, and I took off.  Headed upstairs to our room, propped the door open (because of course I was the only one with a key), and headed straight for the bathroom.  Which is basically where I stayed for the rest of the night.  

So that was day 1.  I basically spent the entire vacation completely out of it.  Did get to Disney a few days later, but I probably shit or puked in every restroom there.  

Hope you feel better soon, and that my terribad story helps in that effort :)",2016-01-03 23:56:29+00:00,cykx46g,4.0,t1_cykvx5s,1836.0,Weakpots

I got a Kindle for Christmas, and reading is actually easy.  I didn't know if I'd like it because I love my real books.  But it's seriously difficult to get through a book with two screaming kids running around.  I've actually gotten through about six chapters of reading in the last few days, though, by just having it laying around, picking it up, reading a bit, and putting it down whenever a kid starts crying.  No bookmarks or anything is pretty sweet.  Okay, advertisement over, ^^Amazon ^^please ^^sponsor ^^me.   

Looking forward to a few more days off starting tomorrow, but I'll have *SO* much to get done when I get back to the office next week.

3404,"Oh, one other thing: remedies for trademark infringement are injunctions and damages.  Damages would be the defendant's profits.  So if Jizzy were earning anything off of Jacked &amp; Tan (and MSB's mark were valid), he'd have to hand those over, but as best I can tell, the program is free, so that's not really an option.  

That just leaves injunction, which would be the ""stop using J&amp;T"" relief.  

I was going to say, that's not really worth the hassle, except now thinking about it, the biggest threat to a valuable trademark is genericization.  That has happened to stuff like Aspirin, Cellophane, and Dry Ice.  If MSB finds the ""Jacked &amp; Tan"" mark to be valuable enough, he may send a scary looking cease &amp; desist letter to Jizzy...

3407,"TL; DR: First in time, first in right.  Finders keepers, losers weepers (this quote was *literally* in my property law book, no shit).  

So, who used it first to identify a good/service in commerce?  That's kinda the key question.  ",2015-12-22 16:54:36+00:00,cy7wn3f,2.0,t1_cy7wja8,156.0,Weakpots
3408,"I'll try to give a somewhat educated answer, though A) Don't take this as legal advice; if you have a real legal issue, consult a lawyer who practice trademarks, and B) I don't practice trademarks, just studied them in school.  

Trademarks are tricky, because there's ""common law"" trademarks and federal trademark law.  Things only get harder with the Internet.  

Typically, if you used a mark in commerce in your market/area first, you win for that market, even if someone else comes along and registers the mark federally (so long as you've continued to use the mark).  

I did only a very brief search, and saw Jizzy used ""Jacked &amp; Tan"" on April 19, 2014.  The earliest reference to ""Jacked and Tan"" on the supertraining.tv website I could find was May 8, 2015.  I'm not certain about dates on howmuchyabench.com.  So, Jizzy wins, right?  

Well, maybe.  First, a ""use"" of a trademark needs to be a mark that identifies the source of a good/service in commerce.  Think the Nike swoosh on shoes/shirts/golf clubs/etc.  That's a clear use.  Is Jizzy using ""Jacked &amp; Tan"" to identify the source of a good or service in commerce?  It's actually a tough question, and I don't know the answer.  Some issues to consider:  

Is ""Jacked &amp; Tan"" an identification of the source of a good/service, or just the name of a program/method of programming?  That's a tough question.  On balance, I'd think that it would tilt in Jizzy's favor, because everyone associates ""Jacked &amp; Tan"" as being a program from GZCL.  

Is the program a ""good/service used in commerce""?  It's given away for free, which probably swings against Jizzy, *except* if he could argue that this was sort of a ""free sample"" of programming that he offers.  I believe he does some online coaching including programming, so it would be an argument he has in his favor.  

Regarding SmellyBell's registration of ""Jacked &amp; Tan,"" he's pretty clearly using ""Jacked &amp; Tan"" on goods (shirts, onesies, etc.) on howmuchyabench.net, which is a requirement (use or intent to use the mark).  I don't think the USPTO searches common law uses of trademarks, just registered marks.  So they wouldn't have found Jizzy's ""Jacked &amp; Tan"" use.  

As far as the core question, does Jizzy need to change the name of his program....  I think it would really come down to whether or not SmellyBell's registered mark is valid against Jizzy's use, which would turn on who used it first.  If SmellyBell didn't use it before April 19, 2014, I think Jizzy's completely in the clear with respect to his program.  If he did, I think Jizzy's hosed.

That's called getting tired, which is what you want out of weight training.  Even with getting less upright, I think your last rep still looks fine.  

If you're having trouble staying upright, the problem is typically weak quads.  Cueing hips forward is good for technique, but really you just want to strengthen your quads, which you achieve by squatting progressively heavier weights.  

I'd just keep at it, no worries.  Just keep the hips forward cue (and also activating your glutes) in mind.  ",2015-12-10 11:38:14+00:00,cxtzgg8,1.0,t3_3w5w88,32691.0,Weakpots

Competing in powerlifting wasn't really something I'd thought to do until recently.  The primary reason I'd compete would be to give training a bigger purpose, and to keep focused.  

I guess one other reason is that, when I was growing up, my dad was always the strongest guy in the room.  I'd like my kids to feel that way about me too.  ",2015-11-23 09:08:34+00:00,cx9zi65,1.0,t3_3twjxz,15328.0,Weakpots

3863,"I typically weigh myself twice a day, once just before bed and once soon after I wake up.  I use two different scales that are off by about 2 pounds.  Typically, I lose about a pound overnight.  So, weighing myself at night, I can almost always predict that I'll be 3 pounds less the next morning.  

So I've been at 195 all this week (198 on the upstairs, pre-bed weigh in).  Last night, I weighed 196.  Went to bed all happy and excited to finally see a change in weight.  Woke up and weighed myself this morning: 194.8.  I actually said, ""Fuck you, scale!""  

Had to go back to my logs from way earlier this year to see that this sort of ""float around the same weight for several days in a row"" thing was pretty typical then, too.  Just frustrating to be eating way less than normal but have the scale tell you that you're eating at maintenance.  ",2015-11-20 10:04:13+00:00,cx6r76t,1.0,t3_3tii6f,29460.0,Weakpots

I think during my next bulk, I'll keep training the main powerlifting movements, but add in all sorts of bodybuilding accessories too.  I got into lifting for muh aesthetics, and somehow ended up on this powerlifting kick.  After a full year now, I still look DYEL, so it'd be nice to... not look that.

Anecdotally: Over a period of three months of me doing curls twice per week in a calorie surplus, I gained about half an inch on my biceps.  That's probably even a generous amount of growth, because before that, I wasn't doing curls at all.  

There's a good chance you're not doing anything wrong, you're just probably expecting too much too quickly.  Keep at it, be sure you're training hard, and keep records (logs and photos).  Don't get discouraged if things aren't happening as quickly as you want.  ",2015-10-31 15:32:33+00:00,cwji438,3.0,t1_cwjhmnp,973.0,Fitness

So, one of our professors used to practice as a criminal defense attorney, and this actually happened to him.  His client was the owner of a house.  Some guy had committed a robbery, and was being chased by the cops.  The fleeing guy ran through this house.  The cops enter, chasing him.  It just so happens that the house also has several large marijuana plants growing inside.  The cops split-second realize this, stop chasing the other suspect, and arrest this house owner.  He couldn't say they entered unlawfully, because of hot pursuit.  Poor guy.  ",2015-10-29 19:29:50+00:00,cwhibfb,6.0,t1_cwhht2k,703.0,Weakpots

4302,"Lifting heavy is part of the equation for hypertrophy, but per [this article](http://www.strengtheory.com/the-new-approach-to-training-volume/), I understand that it's more about the number of hard sets you do that triggers hypertrophy.  

Also, from [here](http://www.strengthandconditioningresearch.com/hypertrophy/), you can achieve hypertrophy lifting weights at a variety of intensities (so long as you do it ""enough,"" e.g., relatively close to or up to failure).  

Getting bigger muscles is basically the one aspect of your body that you have control over for getting stronger, according to various articles on strengtheory.com (and elsewhere).  If you ultimately want to get better at 1RMs, you also need to practice doing true 1RMs.  

This is just what I understand from spending time reading books and articles and such over the last year while also lifting.  I think the short version is, there's not really a magic set/rep scheme.  Just make sure you're actually working really hard.  ",2015-10-28 17:36:25+00:00,cwg3rlc,8.0,t1_cwg2lgd,1644.0,Weakpots

4305,"I'm mostly in the camp of ""change plates are for PRs.""  The ankle weights are similar.  

It sounds to me like it's more of a work capacity issue than a strength issue.  Adding more and more sets in that way should help with the work capacity (and also hypertrophy).  

That said, I'm definitely no expert.  I just sort of try stuff, see if it works, and ditch it for something else when it stops working.  I'd be interested to see what other pots would have to say.

So, if only two people can promise that they've never seen Star Wars, they basically win by default (after posting their vid), and remaining winners will be distributed among those who don't own copies.  ",2015-10-28 02:57:26+00:00,cwfggpg,2.0,t1_cwfg0ch,713.0,Weakpots
4325,"Okay, pots.  It’s [come to my attention](https://www.reddit.com/r/Weakpots/comments/3qhoz2/the_force_not_our_future/) that some of you haven’t seen Star Wars.  This is depressing.  I want to help rectify this.  
Hence, the official Star Wars Tonnage Challenge!  

Rules:  
1. All competitors must promise that they have *never* seen the ~~movies~~ *original trilogy* before.  
2. You must video yourself performing any lift(s) of your choice during…  
3. The [Star Wars Opening Scroll and Theme Music]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXDnFYu91vY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=28s) playing in the background (which may be edited into the video later)  
4. And all entries must be vidded, or no didded (e.g., on Youtube, Vimeo, etc.).  

Winners will be selected by me.  The top 5 competitors will be awarded with copies of the saga (or Amazon gift cards in the equivalent so that you can purchase them, due to shipping/regioning issues).  

Scoring will be based on Wilks (or ASS, if I can get help calculating it) of total tonnage lifted in any lift or combination of lifts, based on pounds on the bar through full range of motion.  Total tonnage refers to total volume of weight (i.e., weight*reps) moved in any combination of lifts.  

This includes non-competition lifts.  Want to power clean your way to victory?  Be my guest.  Want to do curls?  I’m all for it.  Want to squat/bench/deadlift/ohp/power clean/cheaty row?  All the better.  But all aspects of the competition must be completed within the one minute twenty-seven seconds afforded by the link above.  

Wilks/ASS scores will also be multiplied by a “fun factor” that is purely up to me.  The fun factor is influenced by Star Wars related creativity.  Just doing the lifts while the theme music plays in the background results in a fun factor of 1.  But doing the lifts while adorned in Leia’s gold bikini?  Or while dressed as C-3PO?  Something over a 1.  You’re welcome to discuss creative Star Wars themes with other pots who have actually seen the movies, since obviously competitors won’t have seen them (see Rule 1).  

Deadline for completion is December 1.  This should give you enough time for the saga to arrive, and for you to finish watching it, before the release of the new one on December 18.  Competitors must post a link in this thread to be eligible.  

May the force be with you!

I did Starting Strength for about 4 months.  After I plateaued on that, I went to RPT for about 2 or 3 months (wouldn't recommend, didn't progress on that, did lose weight while doing it though).  

I did 5/3/1 full body for a single month, didn't really make much progress on it.  

Then I started doing Greg Nuckols's programs, which is when I started seeing tremendous improvements.  My squat went up 30 pounds two months in a row by doing his programs.

It's a CSS thing, and a pretty well-known one at that.

So this sub moves around whenever it gets deleted, and it's up to people reporting it and the users maliciously linking to it to get the admins' attention. I assume they report it to authorities, but these subs keep popping up. I miss the days when at least you knew /r/creepshots would be the disgusting borderline sub instead of having to be wary of every sub you get linked to.

Deadlift | 270
Press | 140

I recommend this article: http://www.strengtheory.com/making-your-novice-strength-training-routine-more-effective-two-quick-tips/  

If you're ready to switch to a completely new program, I'd recommend the programs you can get from strengtheory.com.  I was running squat 3x/week intermediate, deadlift 2x/week intermediate, bench 1x/week intermediate, and OHP (using the bench program 1x/week, just doing OHP instead).  Using them, I got to:  

Lift | 5RM
---|---
Squat | 310
Bench | 215 
Deadlift | 345
OHP | 155  

I did RPT in between for a bit, but didn't progress much on it.  Also gave 531 a try for a cycle (full body variation with multi-set FSL), but also didn't progress much on it (probably would have more if I'd given it more than one cycle).

4529,"Make sure to get cardio! You're building muscle up under any fat you might have, which is AWESOME. But for it to show, you've got to do some cardio. Lifting weights doesn't burn fat really, it just builds a lot of good strong muscle. I'm sure you're stronger. 

Tracking calories is nowhere near as good as lots of cardio. You need to eat a lot/enough to fuel your weight lifting. Running and, more importantly, playing sports, will help you shed the fat and uncover the muscles. 

You've basically gained fifteen pounds of muscle which is frickin' sweet, and you should be real real proud. Start going for mile runs and get your friends/family together for a game of fun, casual but competitive soccer at the park. 

I actually had the exact same experience as you. I weight lifted and nothing else, and I just got bigger. Got freaked out and lost all the gains I'd made. Now I'm doing it right; cardio and weights. Wish I hadn't stopped and lost my muscle

DON'T BE AFRAID OF GETTING BIGGER! As women we're told we need to be small and petite; screw that I want to be able to defend myself! Gaining fifteen pounds is absolutely nothing but awesome; just gotta add that high intensity cardio (short bursts of high speed are the best, which is why sports are so awesome) to burn some fat and lean out.

Simplest thing to do is track your calories each day for a week, and your weight weekly (say, Sunday morning).  If your weight doesn't go down at the end of the week, eat fewer calories the next week.  Repeat until you're losing 1 pound a week, then stick with that number of calories.

4556,"FWIW: I lost about 40 pounds from late last year to mid this year.  For protein, I aimed for 1g/lb of LBM.  I didn't focus too much on carb/fat splits.  What I did notice, though, was that higher carbs made me feel better/have more energy.  

A few other things I found helpful: plan out your meals in advance, with the macros you want.  I had about two or three different planned breakfasts that I could choose between, so I didn't get bored (e.g., whey/cereal/milk one day, whey/yogurt/oatmeal another day).  I also figured out macros for all my favorite lunch places (Chipotle, Jimmy Johns, etc.), so that any time I wanted to go to a particular restaurant, I knew exactly what I'd be ordering before even opening the door.  

Drink water, lots of water.  I learned about myself that I don't have a very good ""feeling"" for differentiating between hunger and thirst.  If I felt hungry between regular meals, I learned to assume I was actually thirsty, so I'd go drink water.  If I was still hungry, more water.  Then if still hungry, I'd have a snack and deduct it from my later macros for the day (or make it a cheat day).

4690,"I haven't done many cycles of bulk/cut, just one, but I have had some pretty good success.  

I got started last December with myfitnesspal.com.  At that time, I was 215 at 5'9"" with well over 20% bodyfat.  ""Calories in, calories out"" finally clicked for me, so I started tracking calories and body weight daily, body fat percentage weekly.  I track calories using MFP, the rest in a spreadsheet.  

To figure out TDEE calories, I do this: 

    (week calories + 2500*(change in LBM) + 3500*(change in bodyfat)) / 7

This is all done more or less automatically in my spreadsheet, but basically I figure out my LBM and body fat by applying body fat percentage to my body weight, and figure out the differences in each from there.  I read at some point that changes in muscle mass take 2500 calories per pound, whereas changes in fat take 3500 calories per pound.  

From TDEE, if I want to gain, I just add 500; if I want to lose, I subtract 500.  To maintain, I just eat TDEE.  

Macros, I aim to get at least .82 grams protein per 1 pound body mass.  I don't worry much about the split between carbs and fat, since my diet tends to naturally have my fat be around 20-35% of daily calories.  I just make sure to eat the remaining calories in some mix of carbs and fat.  

Doing all this, I got from where I was to a low of about 13.5% body fat at 177 pounds, then started my bulk.  Bulk got me to right around 17% body fat at 195 pounds.  Right now I'm maintaining, and will cut again starting around December-ish (or maybe January, because holidays).  

If anyone's interested, here's a simplified version of [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/185T_nUZH1U3OdOEeDr0NyICtgZAQYMQqVIvFUIz2Beo/edit?usp=sharing) I use.  This version doesn't include the body fat percent adjustments, just weight.  I made it for someone who asked for my help, then ultimately never used the spreadsheet (story of my life).  If anyone's interested, I can make a version that also includes body fat percentage for the more precise formula I discussed above.  ",2015-09-15 11:32:00+00:00,cv27urh,1.0,t3_3l0ggh,17861.0,Weakpots

The point about not bouncing the bar off your thighs is illustrated well in [this article](http://breakingmuscle.com/olympic-weightlifting/the-mistake-thats-costing-you-pounds-in-your-cleans).  Don't stop and use your thighs to throw the bar up, but if your thighs/hips sort of smack the bar due to an explosive extension, that's okay.

If that works, repeat the same pattern if needed (3x5/8, 4x5/8, 5x5/8, retest max).  

Are you only able to do 70x1?  Another thing to try, if the above doesn't help, is to add reps to that set.  Each week, try adding a rep: 70x1, 70x2, 70x3, then the next week, retest your max.  

Do you do all this work before testing your max?  If so, try doing less work when working up to your max, just do warm-ups of like 3x45, 2x55, 1x65, then test max.  

*Another* thing to try is do all reps of your work sets paused, if you're currently doing touch and go bench.  That is, let the bar rest on your chest for a count of 2 or 3, then press.  

Try each of those things alone, see what works.  If that doesn't get it moving, try them in combination.  Also be sure you're eating in a caloric surplus.

I do it like this:  


Day | Lifts
---|---
Monday | Squat (accessories: SGHP, pull-ups, hip thrusters)
Tuesday | Bench (accessories: tri extensions, DB curls, DB flyes, face pulls)
Wednesday | Paused Squats, Deadlifts (more pull-ups)
Thursday | Off (maybe cardio if feeling recovered)
Friday | OHP (accessories: skullcrushers, EZ-bar curls, dips, face pulls)
Saturday | Front Squats, Deadlifts (accessories: SLDLs, pull-ups, rows)  
Sunday | Off

Has been working so far, although I think I'm at a point now where I need to step down to deadlifting only 1x/week.  I may go to that program, done on Saturday.  Then on Wednesday, I might do rack pulls, SLDLs, SGHPs, or something else to get a bit of accessory work without doing full deadlifts.  Not sure yet.

So you do relatively high intensity (90%), but low volume, so that the next week you're pretty fresh and ready to set a new PR.  ",2015-08-15 00:23:18+00:00,cu3eu4l,7.0,t1_cu3eosc,288.0,Weakpots

Now looking over what I'm doing vs. the programs as written, I did add some lower body accessories: on the 5x5 day, I added snatch-grip high pulls, hip thrusters, and pull-ups.  On my pause squat day, I also do GHRs and pull-ups.  Hah, forgot about those things.  ",2015-08-15 00:08:21+00:00,cu3edbv,5.0,t1_cu3dv7i,962.0,Weakpots

In any case, in two cycles, I've added 50 pounds to my squat, 40 pounds to my deadlift, 30 pounds to my bench, and 20 pounds to my OHP.  

I really like how flexible the programs are, in that you can combine them in any way you choose that makes sense.  I plan to keep using them for the foreseeable future.  ",2015-08-14 22:58:58+00:00,cu3c4t9,1.0,t3_3h14aa,2902.0,Weakpots

5007,"Let's clarify a few things:  

Weight loss comes from a calorie deficit.  

A calorie deficit is the difference between calories you eat and calories you use through any activity.  

Even a person in a coma is expending calories, because their heart is pumping, lungs are moving, cells are dying and being replenished, etc.  BMR represents how many calories you expend if you're in a coma.  

Anything more active than comatose expends more calories than BMR.  So daily activities like walking, moving, sitting upright, talking, etc., they all use calories.  Not much, but they still use some.  

So again, a deficit is eating fewer calories than you use through daily activity, this causes weight loss.  A surplus is eating more calories than you use, which causes weight gain.  

The recommended daily allowance is an average across many people; it may or may not represent you as an individual.  

The best way to figure out how many calories you use is to weigh yourself weekly and see which way your weight is moving: if it's going up, you're eating in a surplus, if it's going down, you're in a deficit.  ",2015-08-06 13:37:48+00:00,cttj5e1,1.0,t3_3fzxqi,3219.0,Fitness

Seriously, I know this isn't what you want to hear, you want to know some fancy accessory that transfers to bench really well.  But just as with any lift, specificity is key.  If you want to get better at benching, bench more.  

What's your current bench program look like?  If you're doing a single day of bench, add a second day, and probably even a third, per week.  Don't max out your sets, get to about 2 or 3 reps shy of failure.  Vary the intensity each day you bench.  Stay between 65% and 90% of your predicted 1RM.

It's not much more complicated than that.  The FAQ and wiki here are chock full of information, but when you get down to it, for your goals, it really is this:  

* lift according to an established program (just pick one from the FAQ, any one) to build muscle
* do some cardio to improve cardio (do it on off-lifting days; see here: http://www.completehumanperformance.com/special-endurance-considerations-for-strength-athletes.html) 
* get your diet under control.  Eat .8 to 1 g of protein per pound of bodyweight each day, about 20-35% of calories from fat, the rest from carbs.  If you want to increase your weight (gain more muscle), increase your calories; if you want to trim fat, decrease your calories.

The best advice I can give for running is, lose weight.  I know you're thinking, ""But that's why I'm running!""  However, understand that weight loss comes from *calories*, not exercise.  Be sure to get your diet in check, and eat at a deficit.  C25K is a great program for exercise and can help support your weight loss, but you can't out-exercise a bad diet.  

Also, be sure you get really good running shoes and work on your running form.  Go to a specialty running store and get fitted for a good shoe.  As far as form, the best I can advise is to avoid heel striking: be sure you're landing on your mid foot.  

Also, don't be afraid to go slower when necessary.  Don't try to overdo it.

5053,"You look like you're hyperextending in both the squat and the deadlift.  Especially at the top of your deadlift.  

I *think* you may be relying more on your lower back to finish the lifts, rather than your glutes.  Try this: with no weight (or just a broomstick or the empty bar), do a deadlift your normal way, and film it.  Then do it again, but this time, focus on firing your glutes, *hard*.  If you go from how you look in your deadlift video at the to to having a more neutral spine, I'd think that not firing your glutes is the issue.  

To help with warming up your glutes and feel them activate, try [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj4iWDmPCHQ) (mini band glute activation drills).  Additionally, notice what happens with your glutes if you stand up really tall and walk up stairs: you should feel them firing hard when you do that.  

Hope this helps.  All the best!

Secondly, I've gone through weight loss and bulking.  During weight loss (calorie deficit) there were days when, despite eating less than my TDEE, I felt sated.  Likewise, during bulking (calorie surplus), there were days when I felt hungry even after eating in excess of my TDEE.  

All that leading to me saying, I believe, it's certainly possible to feel hungry despite eating all the calories you need for a given day.  

I imagine hunger may have less to do with what you need right now, and more to do with things like anticipated needs for the future and having delicious food readily available.  That is, imagine you're a caveman and just killed a deer.  Your caveman-brain probably makes your caveman-body crave as much of that meat as possible, because who knows when the next time you'll kill one will be.  Hence why we eat when we're stressed.

No.  Muscle soreness doesn't mean you had a ""good"" workout, and lack of soreness doesn't mean you had a ""bad"" workout.  

&gt; In order to make these gains do I absolutely have to go until I can lift no more, is that pushing it to the limit? (I.e. I work the triceps until my arms give up on me.) Do I push until the muscle is completely fatigued?  

Absolutely not.  You can get great gains from stopping two to three reps shy of failure.  Rather than pushing each set to failure, if you want to do more, do more sets (again, to two to three reps to failure).  

&gt; Tell me what are the signs that I am on track for efficiently building muscle so I can keep them up over the next 60 days.  

Get calipers or an impedance-based electronic body fat calculator.  Neither will be perfect, but they can help give you a good indication of whether you're moving in the right direction.  That is, you might not get a perfect estimate of your bodyfat, but the trend of change over time should generally be correct.

For training max, one of the principles of 531 is to progress slowly. You of course could just reenter your maxes (which is what I would do, personally) but it's not what Wendler prescribes.

You can basically just do the lifts each day with about 50% intensity (vs. 1RM), and you should be set for a deload week.  

For progression, you add 10 pounds to your training max for squat and deadlift, and 5 pounds to your training max for bench, each cycle.

* add one or two sets  
* add a few reps per set  
* increased density (less rest between sets)  
* add a few drop sets (lower weight, higher rep sets)  
* add accessories that support the lift (for OHP, skullcrushers, DB presses, tricep extensions, tricep push-downs, DB lateral raises, etc. are all things to try)  
* work variations of the lift (e.g., DB press, seated press, floor press, closer grip press)

If by this you mean, make sure you get about .8 grams of protein and get carbs/fat in some amount that gets you to 2000 calories per day (however it works out), then yeah, that's basically it.  Some fat is pretty important, but as long as you're getting about 20% or so of calories from fat, you're good.  I've read anywhere from 20% to 35% of all calories from fat per day is good.

There's not a hard and fast rule, you basically need to figure out what works for you.  That said, some muscles can be worked four or even five times per week, such as the biceps or gastrocnemius.  In general, smaller muscles and/or those with more Type I fibers can be exercised more frequently, while larger muscles and those with more Type II fibers need longer recovery.  

There are programs that have you squat three times per week, bench twice per week, and deadlift only once per week.  Texas Method is a good example.  This pretty much aligns with the recovery characteristics of the muscles involved in these various lifts.  ",2015-07-25 02:38:12+00:00,ctfbsc0,1.0,t3_3eigvr,5722.0,Fitness

2. Alternatively, start with empty bar on day 1, and do 5 reps.  Then add 10 pounds or so, do 5 more reps.  Continue until the bar speed just begins to slow down on the last rep (or sooner) in a set of 5.  I'd then knock off about 10% and use that weight as your 5x5 weight.

When you can't add that much weight from exercise to exercise anymore, try staying at the same weight but adding another set (so 4x5 or 4x8), then another (5x), then try adding the weight for 3x5 or 3x8.

If you're concerned about the volume on PHAT, just add sets slowly over time.  See how you feel week to week, and if you're fully recovered by each workout, you should be good to add sets.  If you get to the point you're not fully recovered, take off a set.  Read about ""maximum recoverable volume"" as explained by Dr. Israetel.

Don't do this.  Keep lifting.  Even if you're not progressing, keep lifting heavy while you continue to lose weight.  It will both help you maintain a higher TDEE and help preserve muscle.  

You may want to take a look at this re. the plateau: http://www.strengtheory.com/making-your-novice-strength-training-routine-more-effective-two-quick-tips/.  Consider shifting programs to something periodized (e.g., http://www.mensfitness.com/mensfitness.com/strongin4weeks).

Something that helped me with deadlifts is to stop thinking of it as the act of lifting the weight, and to start thinking of it as the act of driving my hips forward.  That gets the weight off the floor, but only as a secondary consideration.  For me, it's almost entirely a horizontal movement: get my hips back as far as I can, then hold onto the weight and push them forward, hard.

Pain is a weird thing in the body.  It doesn't necessarily happen due to injury.  For example, tell a kid they're getting a shot, and they feel pain without any actual stimulus, just the thought brings the physical pain.  Similarly, people can walk around with herniated discs and not feel a thing.  

I'm gonna guess (and it really is a pure guess) that you're just getting used to lifting and need to get your lower back stronger.  Which you can accomplish through deadlifts.  To me, your form looks pretty good.  A very minor thing you might try is push your hips back a few inches at the start, forcing your shins to be more vertical and feeling your hamstrings and glutes load up like a rubber band ready to spring.

5390,"Not op, but for finding caloric intake, the best thing I've found is to do this:  

1) Weigh yourself on some day, say, Sunday.  
2) Track everything you eat each day, for calories.  
3) Weigh yourself the next week same day (Sunday again).  
4) Add up your calories, then add 3500 times your weight change (in pounds).  
5) Divide by 7.  That's your TDEE.  

From there, add or subtract 500 (or so), depending on which way you want to go.  So if you're trying to lose weight, take TDEE-500, and you should lose about a pound a week.  

Keep tracking each week like this and adjust as necessary.  Hope this helps.",2015-06-27 13:10:43+00:00,cskg59l,2.0,t1_cskddxr,12324.0,progresspics

5402,"Short answer: 8 months continuously.  

Long answer: lifted in middle school and high school quite a bit, although used poor form, didn't do important barbell lifts like squats and deadlifts, etc. etc.  After that, did a little in college, not much though.  Got fat in college, got fatter in law school, got fatter still after starting my career.  Tried to get started lifting about 4 years ago and did okay, then got in a car accident.  Although I was okay, thought I'd gotten a hernia, so stayed away until 8 months ago when I finally picked it back up.  In the first about 7 months or so of that, I concentrated on cutting to get rid of the fat.  I got relatively relatively lean, so I've just started my first controlled bulk (meaning, watching my calories and macros, trying to gain muscle without crazy amounts of fat along with it).
