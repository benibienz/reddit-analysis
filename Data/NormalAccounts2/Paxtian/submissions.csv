I didn't look closely enough at what I received, though, because the absolute beauty in the picture above is what I'm smoking right now (along with a Glenrothes).  

I haven't been smoking much, because I was preparing for a powerlifting meet ([video if you're curious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_uhEstNphg)).  I'm taking a little time off now that it's over, though, and celebrating it being done.  Grabbed a short stick out of the humi, which happened to be this Cuban beauty.  I didn't even realize it until I lit it up just where this stick was from.  And it definitely shows!

10,2016-08-21 09:03:10+00:00,self.Weakpots,https://www.reddit.com/r/Weakpots/comments/4ytzwy/usapl_twin_cities_open_meet_report/,False,"#Background  
I've lifted on and off for years.  Mostly I lifted in middle school and high school on, then off for lots of years, then on for the last almost two years consistently.  

I got back into it because I got fat.  Needed some exercise to do to lose weight, or so I thought.  Then I found reddit and learned about calories and stuff and realized that it just takes not stuffing your face to lose weight.  But whatever, I still enjoy lifting so I keep at it.  

For the first half of 2015, I lost about 40 pounds by tracking my calories, lifting, and running/ellipticalling.  Then I got into more of a strength focused mindset, bulked back up about 30 pounds and put on a good bit of muscle.  

That gets to about the beginning of this year.  I had gotten a relatively high bodyfat percentage (according to my calipers, 18%, but that's probably lower than in reality).  So I've been cutting, or at least trying to cut, pretty much this entire year.  There have been times where I blew my calorie budget on dumb shit and ended up eating way too much and not losing, or in fact gaining, so that set me back some.  I was hoping by summer to be where I want (10-12%ish) and then maintain leading up to this meet.  Meh, life happens.  

#Training  
My training throughout most of this year has been heavily based on the /u/gnuckols sample programs.  I've adapted them as time has gone on to better fit what I think works best for me.  The overall approach is monthly periodized training, which starts at lower intensity/higher volume, and week by week the intensity ramps up while volume drops.  Then the last week, you test new maxes, and repeat the next month.  

This style of training works well for me.  I like doing different set/rep/intensity schemes week by week, it keeps things interesting.  It's also paid off in terms of strength gains, so that's kinda neat too.  

Like I said above, I've been cutting pretty much all year.  When I registered for the meet, I did some quick math and thought I should be in the 83kg range by meet day.  My decision to compete in that class was more driven by ""I'm trying to cut to 10% bodyfat"" than ""I want a lower class to improve my wilks/not look as weak for my size.""  That is, I'd have been cutting pretty much the same way whether I was competing or not.  At the end of the day, I care more about my health and aesthetics than I do pure raw strength, so I want to try to stay in a certain bodyfat range (10 to about 18%).  

#Three Weeks Before Meet  
For the weeks leading up to the meet, I tried a taper.  Three weeks out, I did just the primary lifts for triples, doing 8 sets for pretty much everything at around 85%ish intensity.  Two weeks out, I dropped to 4x3s.  One week out, I squatted and deadlifted on Monday, basically hit my openers and then triples of something pretty ridiculously light, benched Tuesday and Thursday with the same sort of scheme: hit my opener and triples of really light weight.  

I wasn't quite in the 83 kg weight class during this time, so I dropped my calories pretty hard.  I had been cutting at around 2250 or so, but dropped down to 2000 as my target.  I would be at or near my target weight of 183 most days, but I wanted to make sure I was in.  

#Night Before Meet  
I didn't do any sort of water cut or anything like that.  Most days, I try to get about 175g of protein, which is an easy number to remember and close to about 1.1g/pound of lean body mass (at least, according to my estimates of bodyfat using calipers).  Friday before meet day, I was about 48g of protein short.  Normally, I'd have two scoops of casein, but I skipped that.  That night, I weighed 182.6, so I knew I'd weigh about 180 the next morning.  And sure enough, that's what happened.  

#The Meet!  
I woke up and weighed myself on meet day, and I was 180 and change.  Perfect for what I wanted.  I was concerned my scale would read light compared to the scale they use for weigh ins, so I just took a few mini sips of water, but otherwise waited to eat or drink until after weigh ins.  

I weighed in at 82.06 kg, so made weight pretty easily.  Then I went and slammed two egg McMuffins and two hash browns from McDonalds.  Probably (no, definitely) not the best idea to have two of each, but it sounded like a great idea at the time.  I think this set the tone for the meet a bit off for me.  I didn't get my normal pre-workout shake because I was too full of egg/muffin/cheese/canadian bacon deliciousness.  But more on that in a bit.  First of all... 

#Squats  
My best 1RM in the gym is 405.  I figured with the taper, I should be able to hit a PR.  And squats are my best lift, or at least that's how they feel to me, so I wanted to push myself.  

[Squat 1: 165kg](https://youtu.be/p_uhEstNphg?t=1s).  Made this easily.  
[Squat 2: 180kg](https://youtu.be/p_uhEstNphg?t=17s).  Again, this felt great, nice make.  
[Squat 3: 190kg](https://youtu.be/p_uhEstNphg?t=34s).  Decided to really push myself and see what I could do.  I could've definitely made 185.  I probably should have gone with 187.5.  But 190 is such a nice round number, thought I'd try it.  Didn't happen, but I'm okay with it.  

#Bench  
Here, I think my lack of experience with meet day conditions really showed.  It had been about 4 hours by this point since I'd eaten, and I was getting hungry.  I should have brought a couple snacks, but all I had was my pre-workout shake (two scoops of whey, BCAAs, beta-alanine, and some glutamine mixed in, which isn't typical but wanted quick energy).  I decided to save that for after bench.  

[Bench 1: 115kg](https://youtu.be/p_uhEstNphg?t=45s).  Made it.  This felt way heavier than it should have.  But I've hit 280lbs/127kg in the gym.  So I pushed...  
[Bench 2: 122.5kg](https://youtu.be/p_uhEstNphg?t=52s).  Missed.  I got the bar just off my chest, and couldn't go further.  
[Bench 3: 122.5kg](https://youtu.be/p_uhEstNphg?t=58s), take two, miss two.  Was kind of mentally checked out by this point.  

#Deadlift  
At this point, I had a fairly okay squat, and a horrible bench.  All my mind wanted was to hit my opener, get a total, and go home.  But I'd had my protein/sugar/supplement shake about half an hour earlier, so my body was ready to rip some weight off the ground.  

[Deadlift 1: 182.5kg](https://youtu.be/p_uhEstNphg?t=1m6s).  Made this easily.  I was actually a bit concerned before meet day about going with this, because I've never repped it before (and my other openers, I've done for triples), and I wasn't sure if hitting three heavy squats, then deadlifting, would work.  But it worked out fine.  
[Deadlift 2: 195kg](https://youtu.be/p_uhEstNphg?t=1m16s).  Mentally I wasn't certain, but made it.  
[Deadlift 3: 202.5kg](https://youtu.be/p_uhEstNphg?t=1m28s).  Make.  I really should've pushed myself harder here, but I'd tried pushing myself in the other two lifts and that hadn't paid off, so I decided to go out positive and just match my gym PR.  

#Other Stuff  
After having spotted and loaded at this event last year, and this year competing in it, I think I can say that meets aren't completely my thing, but I do enjoy the atmosphere.  I really like being surrounded by people who are into this sport, and seeing everyone encourage each other.  I think that part is awesome, that by and large everyone's competing against themselves, so there's encouragement all around for everyone lifting, from the other lifters especially.  I think I'll keep doing competitions, but if it weren't a part of my life, there wouldn't be some empty hole I'd have to fill with something else, if that makes sense.  

I got to meet /u/HailStorm31, which was awesome, lots of fun!  

And thanks to my wife, /u/EchoLight314, for recording everything.  

#Lessons Learned  

One, don't eat like 1000 calories of McDonalds and skip my normal pre-workout shake.  I think in the future, I'll pack stuff to make three smaller shakes, with all the stuff I normally have as pre-workout (protein, beta alanine, maybe BCAAs and glutamine, because that helped).  I think if I'd stuck with one meal from McD's, I would've been okay, but two was just too filling.  

I also think a full two week taper was too long for where I'm at.  Not sure about next year what I'll do, probably depends on how far I progress.  But for this one, I think I could've done with just a single week taper.  

And of course, getting on a more appropriately timed bulk/cut cycle would've been tremendously helpful.  If I'd planned it right and not messed up earlier this year, I would've been maintaining my weight right now, instead of continuing to cut.  I think I would've done far better if I weren't in a calorie deficit.  

But hey, I got a +497.5 meet PR, and a [second place medal](http://i.imgur.com/XKbM0ra.jpg) for my weight class, so in the end, it was a pretty good day.  

#Going Forward  
I'm still not at 10% bodyfat, so I'll keep pushing for that.  Dat siren song of visible abs...  

Training-wise, I've put together a sort of bastard child of the GNuckols training I've been doing and 531, and I'm excited to give it a try.  I want to do something lower volume while I keep cutting, but enough to keep my strength up.  And I'll be including stuff that I enjoy  (like snatch grip high pulls, fun fun!), rather than strictly focusing on the powerlifts.  

But for the immediate two weeks coming up, I'm just taking off.  I could feel burnout starting to set in in July.  I don't want that, and I don't want lifting to feel like a chore.  I think that's probably the part that I don't like about the meet training the most: lifting started to feel more like a chore than a fun hobby.  Anyway, two weeks off should reset me mentally and prep me to get back into it refreshed and ready to go.  I think I'll play some No Man's Sky, and also get back out on my bike and play some Ingress.

Are there problems?  Sure.  However, for what it is, it is truly amazing.  So rather than focus on all the things that it's not (or at least isn't yet), I thought I'd touch on a few of my personal experiences that keep me coming back to the game.  That is, the things that, when I think, ""Why am I playing this?"" are the things that I hope to experience again, or at least things that are similar.  

#The Beginning  
My expectation of the start of the game was that I'd wake up on a barren, almost entirely deserted planet, and have to search for hours before finding a planet having any life whatsoever.  So when I started, I just happily started mining to fix my ship, without a care in the world of anything like sentinels coming after me.  

That turned out to be a mistake.  After just a few minutes of mining iron, three sentinels flew up on me and started attacking me.  I had to learn quickly how to fight them, because I came close to dying trying to run away.  After that, three more attacked, and then two more!  So eight sentinels later, I'm back to mining iron, with a new found respect for what they can do.  

The overall surprise was intriguing, and made me realize I'd likely have many more surprises.  

#Languages  

I had no idea there would be multiple alien races to interact with, nor that you'd be able to learn their languages.  The first time I noticed a word in red while speaking to an alien that I'd ""learned"" before, I was truly excited.  One of my overall goals has become to learn enough words in at least one of the three languages to consistently be able to recognize full sentences when dealing with their aliens.  That could take a while, but it's exciting to me.  And that's actually more important and intriguing to me than getting to the center.  

#Creature Attack  

This was more just an isolated event that I found funny.  During the intro set of ""missions"" to get the antimatter blueprint for warp fuel, I was sent to an outpost on a planet.  I noticed that this outpost had a steel door on it.  Tried shooting the door with my mining laser, and couldn't even scratch it.  

I didn't have a boltcaster yet, so I figured out I needed iron to make that.  Did a quick search of the area, and found some iron.  I noticed an animal hanging around the iron, but to that point, animals had been skittish around me, so I didn't think much of it.  Started mining the iron, when suddenly my shields dropped!  The animal had attacked me!  

I focused on trying to hit it just to get it to go away, and it kept hitting me.  I got the iron I needed and just ran away, and then it left me alone.  By that point, my shields were drained, but I figured, no problem, just make the boltcaster and go inside.  

As soon as I start shooting the door, though, I drew sentinels' attention!  No problem, I figured, I've dealt with these guys before, and now I have a fancy new weapon.  Destroyed two or three of them, which then heightened my alert level!  Better sentinels showed up, and that was the first (and so far, only) time I've died in the game.  I was able to recollect my inventory from my grave marker, which will apparently be on that planet forever now.  

Anyway, the whole series of events was pretty funny and entertaining, and it's that sort of story-worthy event that will keep me coming back.  

#Economics  

Many years ago, I played an open-ended space-themed game called Privateer.  It remains one of my favorite games to this day.  When I first heard about No Man's Sky, it reminded me in many ways of Privateer, and I was intrigued.  One of the things I did in Privateer was figure out which systems sold which goods high and bought which low.  I'd map out complicated trade routes to buy low, sell high, exploit price arbitrage, and profit.  

I figured I'd be able to do something similar in NMS.  So far, I haven't done anything quite as complicated as in Privateer, but there was an event where I could exploit arbitrage.  

I found a space station after having collected a few green items (Cubes or Chips or something, don't remember exactly).  They were just taking up inventory slots, so I wanted to sell them before warping to my next system.  While selling them, I happened to notice yellow stars next to Dynamic Resonators and Korvax Convergence Cubes, and that both were being bought at the station for nearly double their average price.  Interesting, but I didn't have either.  

At this point, I still had my first ship, and about 250k credits.  A friend of mine had told me he saw someone buy a ship at a station for about that many credits.  As I was heading to my ship, another ship flew in that looked way better than mine.  I decided to see what it was and how much it was selling for.  It had way more inventory, better equipment, and was selling for about 330k.  Out of my price range.  

Then I decided to see what the pilot was selling.  He had Dynamic Resonators for just a hair over the average price!  I thought, wait a minute... wasn't the station buying these for double that?  They were expensive, so I didn't buy any, instead I raced back inside to confirm what I'd seen before.  Yeah, it is buying them!  Opportunity...  

I went back out to the hanger, only to see that ship had gone.  But there were two or three more.  So I checked them.  Sure enough, they were selling DRs for just a bit over average price!  I bought as many as I could hold, ran inside, and sold them, doubling my investment in about 2 minutes.  

I transferred all my inventory to my ship, leaving me with 11 slots open.  I'd buy as many resonators or cubes as I could hold, then sell them.  Soon enough, I had close to a million credits.  I had seen a few ships in the two to four million credit range that I really wanted, and knew what they typically had to offer as far as inventory size and equipment.  I decided I'd keep going until I couldn't make money this way anymore, or I found a ship I could afford.  

I ended up [finding one](http://i.imgur.com/xtXfbaQ.jpg) after I got to about 2.5 million credits, but the ship was only 1.1 million!  So I bought it, transferred my inventory with plenty of room to spare, and banked the rest of my credits.  

That taught me, if you are paying attention, you can be rewarded, and that's something I enjoy and will keep me coming back for sure!

#The Distress Signal  

A while after getting my fancy new ship, I warped around to a system and found a distress signal.  I decided I'd go check it out.  When I got there, nothing was around, so I did a ship scan.  Turns out there was a distress signal on the planet.  Head down there, it guides me ultimately to a crashed ship!  The ship was on par with my own, but I learned I could just take it and fix it up if I wanted it.  So that made me want to find a new, even nicer ship than the one I had.  I ultimately did, just last night.  It wasn't much better, but had far better equipment and looked way cooler (haven't taken a screenshot yet).  I plan to keep looking for newer, better ships this way.  Even though I know now that they tend to be on par with your current ship, others have found way nicer ones this way, so I'll keep hunting.  

#Microtool Exchange  

I went on a tear of upgrading my multitool for better and better ones for a while.  It started with me finding my first Vy'keen space station.  I talked to the Vy'keen warrior in the station, and he was nervously eyeing my multitool.  I had the option of either keeping it, or handing it over to him.  

I was nervous about handing it over.  I'd bought a slightly better tool than the one you start with, and I was worried about, what if he doesn't give it back?  On the other hand, what if I keep it and he sees that as a threat and shoots me dead on the spot?  I figured the game wouldn't just deprive me entirely of a tool, so I took a risk and handed it to him.  He was so thrilled, he did keep it, but gave me a nicer one!  That was exciting.  

Anyway, between learning new languages, accumulating credits, hunting for newer and better ships, and ultimately just having all these different experiences, I have plenty to keep my hands full for quite a while.  I learned what happens at the center, and that doesn't particularly excite me.  So rather than make the center my goal, I'm just following my own goals, and if they happen to take me to the center, cool.  If not, I'm okay with that.  By the time I fulfill my goals, I'll have sunk plenty of time into the game, and accumulated plenty of stories worth remembering and recounting to my friends.  I hope you all get the similar experiences worth remembering.

Then I just decided to HTFU and write it up, and we'll go from there.  

#In the Beginning  

Okay, not really.  But quickly, I lifted in middleschool and high school.  My dad [built his own homegym](http://imgur.com/a/A1HkH) in the 80s, so I used that quite a bit.  I was primarily a benchbro and curlbro at the time.  I did actually lift full body, but primarily on a machine, despite having a perfectly awesome squat/bench setup as you can see.  Never did a deadlift once.  I didn't know much about them, and thought I would hurt my back.  Did do squats, but probably not even close to parallel.  

Got out of lifting through college and law school, got fat, and ended up looking like [this](http://i.imgur.com/Ei07QtO.jpg).  That gets us to about mid 2011.  

#First Kid Born Timeframe

So around mid 2011, we were expecting our first kid, and I didn't want to be a fat old man unable to keep up with her.  Started looking into diet and exercise.  I got a collapsible bench with bar supports, and also some safety stands.  Didn't know anything about programming, except what I'd learned in high school and from my dad.  Created my own split program, primarily including squats, bench, deadlift, military press, curls, and abs.  Started doing deadlifts for the first time.  

I remember distinctly when I needed to buy a second set of 45 plates, thinking I was getting **really** strong when I was squatting/deadlifting 225.  lol  

In any case, I kept up with my lifting routine really well for about 6-8 months or so.  Then when my daughter was about 6 months old, I got in a car accident.  I was going 50ish mph, and a 16 year old kid turned right in front of me.  I slammed into his front axle, hard.  No one in his car got hurt, I was mostly unhurt, except I had pretty bad pain in my groin.  

Thought I'd gotten a hernia, so I stopped lifting for a while.  Took me about two months to go get it checked out because I'm a stubborn idiot, but finally went in, and my doctor said yeah, go to a specialist.  So I went to the specialist, and he actually said I didn't have a hernia (phew)!  There was some extra tissue that turned out to just be a lipoma.  He said otherwise I'd be fine to go back to lifting.  Except by this point, I'd gotten out of the habit.  

#Second Kid Born Timeframe  

Around early 2014, I started hanging out on reddit, reading various things in various subreddits.  One of them was /r/fitness.  For some reason, the whole ""calories in calories out"" thing never clicked in my mind.  It seemed too basic, and I was convinced through media and advertising that losing weight took some complicated diet and exercise regime.  Reading the FAQ and other people's comments for long enough, it finally clicked that it really was as simple as CICO.  

I put together my first real diet plan, stuck to it, and ultimately lost around 45 pounds (from 220 to 175).  Ended up looking more like [this](http://i.imgur.com/a1bGSEB.jpg) in the March 2015ish timeframe.  Diet was typically 500-1000 calorie deficit per day (lower end as I got closer to my goal weight).  

#Training  

I started with Starting Strength because /r/fittit FAQ.  If I could go back and start over, I'd do this instead:  

Do 3x8 of squat, bench, deadlift, every day (or alternate bench and OHP, a la SS).  Add 10 lbs to squat and deadlift, 5 lbs to bench (and OHP) each day.  If there's a day that you can't do a full 3 sets of 8 reps, instead of deloading, transition that lift to one rep less than you got, say 3x6.  Keep doing this for 3x4, then 3x2.  When you fail 3x2, deload to 80% of current weight, and go back to 3x8.  Repeat.  This makes the program slightly more complicated, but makes it periodized, which [I think is beneficial](http://strengtheory.com/making-your-novice-strength-training-routine-more-effective-two-quick-tips/).  

Anyway, for SS, everyone on fittit said start light, so I started with 95 pounds for squat, bench, and deadlift, and empty bar for OHP.  I did SS from November 2014 to March 2015.  This got me to my squat being 245 (3x5), bench 185 (3x5), deadlift 255 (1x5).  

I decided to hop off SS because I wasn't progressing much anymore, had stalled several times.  I was still cutting.  I gave Texas Method a shot for all of two weeks, so didn't really give it a shot at all.  Read that reverse pyramid training is good for a cut, so I started that.  Did that from March to May, didn't see much lift progress, but did keep losing weight and got to my goal weight.  

After reaching my goal weight, I transitioned to 5/3/1, full body, full boring.  I only did it for a month.  I even added FSL for like 5x8, but still didn't feel like it was enough volume.  Didn't see much progress (although again I didn't give it much of a shot).  I had begin a reverse diet and got back up to maintenance calories during 531.  I think I could actually do 531 more successfully now that I know more, if I were to spend some more time in Beyond 531.  

At this point, it's May 2015.  My predicted 1RMs based on reps are: squat 295, bench 225, deadlift 335, OHP 155.  

Anyway, that gets me to...  

#Real Progress, Strengtheory/GNucks Programs, and Weakpots  

So far, the Strengtheory programs have been my favorite, and I've seen my best progress from them.  It was also around this time that I found weakpots.  I think I noticed that /u/gnuckols actually posted here, which is when I started lurking, then ultimately joined the shitpostsquad.  

I started bulking while running the Strengtheory sample programs: squats 2 day/week, bench 1 day/week, OHP 1 day/week, and deadlift 2 day/week, all intermediate.  

I've pretty much been running that or some variant of it until now.  I've made modifications, but I truly think the monthly periodization approach works best for my body.  

# No Vid No Did  

I've selected a few milestone vids or just those that jumped out at me in my collection for compilation videos of the big three lifts, plus OHP because weakpots.  I think there's definite improvement in my form, and clearly I can move more weight in all of them so I've gotten stronger.

# Current Goals  

As of this morning, I weigh 191.5.  My 1RMs are squat 395, bench 275, deadlift 445, and OHP 185.  I'm hoping to add about 50 pounds to squats and deadlift, and 30 pounds to bench, by my first USAPL meet in August, while also cutting down to the 83kg (183 lb) weight class.  Setting my goals big.  Why not, right?  

I track my calories in MFP, and record my daily calories and weight in Excel.  At the end of each week, I use calipers to measure my estimated bodyfat.  Then I use the changes in my LBM and fat to estimate my TDEE, and then add or subtract calories based on goals.  Right now, since I'm cutting, I'm aiming to lose about 1 to 1.25 pounds per week, given where I'm at bodyfat-wise.  

I use this formula to calculate TDEE: average daily calories - (2500\*(LBMcurr - LBMprev) + 3500\*(FATcurr - FATprev))/7.  LBM represents ""lean body mass"" and ""FAT"" represents total bodyfat, ""curr"" represents this week, ""prev"" represents last week.  I then smooth the TDEE by combining 30% of this week's TDEE with 70% of last week's TDEE--I figure this week may have been an aberration, much less likely to get noise this way.  Might be overkill, but it's worked for me.

If you've read this far, thanks for reading!  If not, well, I don't blame you.  I'm open to any questions.  I have a shit ton of spreadsheets for tracking all my stuff, and it's almost all automated at this point, so if you're interested, feel free to ask and I'll post them and links.  Or feel free to ask any questions about why I do what I do the way I do it.  Thanks!

Have a fairly full humidor just begging me to smoke a few.  

I decided to go with an ACID Blondie Belicoso, because I've never had an infused cigar, and it sounded interesting.  I didn't take any pictures because wearing gloves, smoking, and wielding my phone camera was going to be too difficult.  

To start, the wrapper is a nice golden color.  I like the band a lot, too, the blue is shiny and provides a striking contrast.  

Lighting was quite simple and quick with a single flame lighter.  

The first taste was incredibly sweet because of the infusion.  I think the closest flavor I can compare it to would be ultra sugary kool-aid.  

The flavor of the smoke itself, to me, was black pepper, with some vegetal hints... sort of like red and green bell pepper.  It was tough to pick up much else.  

Got a nice length of ash on the stick, at least an inch before I decided to tap it off.  

To me the flavors were fairly consistent through the entire smoke.  The only major change was that the infusion/sugary flavors diminished toward the end, making the pepper flavors more pronounced.  

Overall this was decent, but not my favorite smoke.  I'd say about a 5 out of 10.  I may give infused cigars a try again sometime, but not soon.  It would probably work better after dinner, rather than as an afternoon smoke.

Cigars I've loved in the past include the Romeo &amp; Julietta Vintage, Camacho Connecticut, and a Macanudo... something, gold label maybe?  Looking to expand my horizons, though, so I thought I'd get a wide selection of samplers.  

Now the only problem is that I'm in a cold weather state, so I need to wait until the weather is a bit nicer out to smoke!  I may just need to brave the cold to check something out.  Obviously I've mostly enjoyed milds so far.  

Just wanted to make a quick introduction and say hi, and see if anyone has any thoughts on what would be worth braving the cold for in the list above.  Thanks!

My previous program was based on weekly undulating periodization (it was a combination of the Greg Nuckols sample programs for squat, bench, and deadlift).  That worked very well for bulking and maintaining, but my TDEE swings all over the place with it, which makes it tough for cutting.  I also don't feel recovered in the last ""test new maxes"" week.  Thought I'd change things up a bit.  

The basis of this routine is lots of high rep sets (while still maintaining intensity of 65% of 1RM or greater), but also keeping some heavy lifts (80% - 90% of 1RM) to preserve muscle mass and try my best to improve.  The high rep sets are mostly to do something that will burn lots of calories, but also support preservation of muscle mass.  

So anyway, here's the program:  

Week 1   

Monday | Wednesday | Friday
---|---|----
Squat 3x5+ @80% | Front Squat 3x5+ @80% | Deadlift 3x5+ @80%
Bench 5x8 @65% | OHP 3x5+ @80% | Bench 3x5+ @80%
Deadlift 5x8 @65% | OHP 5x8 @65% | Squat 5x8 @65%
Row 5x8 | Pull-Ups 3x9RPE | Face Pulls 3x12


Week 2  

Monday | Wednesday | Friday
---|---|----
Squat 3x3+ @85% | Front Squat 3x3+ @85% | Deadlift 3x3+ @85%
Bench 5x8 @70% | OHP 3x3+ @85% | Bench 3x3+ @85%
Deadlift 5x8 @70% | OHP 5x8 @70% | Squat 5x8 @70%
Row 5x8 | Pull-Ups 4x9RPE | Face Pulls 4x12


Week 3  

Monday | Wednesday | Friday
---|---|----
Squat 3x1+ @90% | Front Squat 3x1+ @90% | Deadlift 3x1+ @90%
Bench 5x8 @75% | OHP 3x1+ @90% | Bench 3x1+ @90%
Deadlift 5x8 @75% | OHP 5x8 @75% | Squat 5x8 @75%
Row 5x8 | Pull-Ups 5x9RPE | Face Pulls 5x12


Week 4 (Deload)   

Monday | Wednesday | Friday
---|---|----
Squat 3x5 @65% | Front Squat 3x5 @65% | Deadlift 3x5 @65%
Bench 3x5 @65% | OHP 5x5 @65% | Bench 3x5 @65%
Deadlift 3x5 @65% | Pull-Ups 2x9RPE | Squat 3x5 @65%
Row 5x8 | nil | Face Pulls 2x12  

The +'s indicate that the last set is an AMRAP set. 

For progression, I plan to increase my training max (used to calculate the %'s above) by 10 lbs lower body / 5 lbs upper body after the deload week.  But I'll also temper that by seeing where I get with the AMRAP sets using a 1RM calculator.  If the AMRAP set using a 1RM calculation shows I've lost strength, I may reduce my training max a bit, but of course, the goal is preservation of strength, so hopefully that's not necessary.  

I didn't give weights for rows and face pulls.  For rows I plan to up the weight by 5 pounds or so each week.  Face pulls I'll use the same weight each week, and add 5 pounds after the deload week.  Pull-ups for now will be done with bodyweight.  

On Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday, I plan to do elliptical for cardio to keep burning calories.  I do it relatively low intensity for 45 minutes.  I also do Limber 11 before and some static stretching after running on the elliptical.  

The plan would be to run this as long as needed to get to 12% bodyfat.  Of course, I understand diet is a huge component of cutting, so to add that: .83g protein / pound bodyweight, 20-35% calories from fat, rest in carbs.  I track my TDEE by counting calories daily, monitoring changes in weight, and adjusting accordingly.  Goal is to lose around 0.7% of bodyweight per week (so daily calorie intake of TDEE-500\*.007\*bodyweight).

Just kidding.  I kept track of entries I saw, so here are the *actual* winners.  This didn’t end up needing any Wilks/ASS calculations, because of the number of entries, although I appreciate /u/DrColossus1’s help with the calculations.  If you made a submission that I missed, please message me with a link to your entry!  

#/u/voidobscura [pulling sumo in Rocky shorts](https://np.reddit.com/r/Weakpots/comments/3qx2wp/335x20_sumo_deadlift_star_wars_challenge_in_which/) 

/u/voidobscura tortured himself with a ridiculous volume of 20 sumo pulls at 335.  Highly impressed!  All in Rocky shorts, too.  Rocky shorts -&gt; Rocky was made in the 70’s -&gt; Star Wars was originally released in the 70’s.  Cool fun factor!  

#/u/greenalleycat [SkeleSquatted to Victory](https://np.reddit.com/r/Weakpots/comments/3qnxp6/skelesquats_v_the_weak_feeble_strikes_back/)  

/u/greenalleycat got this whole thing started by [shitposting about R2D2](https://np.reddit.com/r/Weakpots/comments/3qhoz2/the_force_not_our_future/) without actually [knowing who R2D2 is](https://np.reddit.com/r/Weakpots/comments/3qhoz2/the_force_not_our_future/cwf9cdd).  He will soon enough, though, after marathoning the movies!  The fun factor he exhibited was ~~his skeleton suit~~ *a General Grievous-ish costume*.  

In hindsight, it would’ve been nice to get him the movies before his nose got all fucked up from surgery, so he'd have something to do during recovery.  

#/u/needupv0tes [Used the power of the Dark Side to deadlift AND squat](https://np.reddit.com/r/Weakpots/comments/3s56ki/in_which_i_do_the_starwars_challenge_so_i_can_no/)  

/u/needupv0tes absolutely rocked the fun factor by deadlifting in a Vader mask.  IIRC, she even PRed her deadlifts at the time, but the video got messed up, so she had to redo her attempt.  She ditched the mask, but kept the all-black ensemble to round out her entry with squats.  Suspicious that she removed her mask at the end?  I won’t say anything further for fear of spoilers…

I had never been to a powerlifting meet before yesterday.  I am interested in getting involved in them, though.  All the advice I've read is to attend a meet before competing in one, to see what it's like and get used to what happens in them.  I thought volunteering at one would be a great way to see what they're really like.  The TL;DR is that this is a great way to see what a meet is like.  

I signed up to volunteer, and the three options to choose from were judging, scoring table, or spotting and loading.  I obviously was not qualified to be judging.  I didn't know if I'd be qualified for the scoring table either, although I think it's just entering lifters' attempts and reporting whether each attempt was good or not.  So, spotting and loading it was.  

I think the organizers of this event assume that anyone who volunteers pretty much knows what to expect at a meet.  I didn't get much information, other than my assignment as a spotter/loader.  In hindsight, I really should have asked some basic questions like, ""What time should I get there?""  ""Should I pack a lunch?""  ""How long does this meet typically go?""  

Since I didn't know the answers to any of these questions, I just guesstimated.  I figured it would be an all day thing, and that I'd definitely need food.  So I packed myself a lunch (just a turkey sandwich and some carrots).  More on that in a bit.  

I really should have asked what time to be there.  The website said that the event would start at 8:00 am.  I looked at the gym's website, and it opened at 7:00 am.  I figured, if things are getting started at 8, they'll need help getting set up and such, so I got there at about 7:15.  I asked around and was told who to talk to as a volunteer, and he said something to the effect of: ""Oh, well, go get some breakfast... we won't need you to do anything for a while.""  

Since it was really early, I tried to find a way to make myself useful.  Some of the gym's employees started setting up chairs, so I jumped in and helped with that.  That got me to about 8:15ish.  So I sat around until lifting started.  

**Squats**  
The meet had two platforms set up.  The morning session was the men's, and our platform had the 105, 93, and 83 classes, each in their own flights.  The other weight classes were on the other platform.  We started at the 105, and then went down.  I thought this sounded backwards, until after the first flight.  Then it clicked: do the heaviest weights first, so you're not exhausted by the end of the third flight.  I definitely appreciated it at that point.  

We also had a master's class on our platform.  I got to see a guy in the master's class set an American record.  I don't remember how much he put up, but he got it on his second attempt.  That was pretty cool.  

Between lifts, we took about a five minute break, to get set up for the next lift and also just to rest.  On to...

**Bench**  
Not much to report here.  I worked safeties and blocks, which were 45 pound bumpers.  Fortunately, only one guy needed the blocks.  

There were a few guys who I don't think quite knew the spotting etiquette when you fail a bench.  Like, rather than letting the spotters take 10 or 20 pounds off the bar, when they'd fail, they'd basically just let go and have the spotters take *all* the weight.  Please don't do this if you're a lifter unless you're absolutely physically unable to help.  

Anyway, after bench, I was getting hungry, and it was about 12:30 or so.  I was thinking, ""Wow, this is really moving, I might be out of here by 2:00!""  I ran out and grabbed my sandwich, ate it, and came back inside for deadlifts.  

**Deadlifts**  

Again, not a lot to report here.  I went back to loading for about half of this.  The other loader was really fast, and was pushing me to go fast too.  

The other platform had already finished about half a flight of deadlifts by the time we finished bench.  As fast as we were moving, though, we actually finished deadlifts before the other platform.  Take that, platform 2!  

However, by the last flight of deadlifts, I was completely beat, so swapped out to truck instead.  

We finished right about the time I thought, 2:00ish.  I was like, ""Wow, I thought I was in for a whole day, this is great!""  Then this guy comes up and says, ""The afternoon will go a lot faster.  The women don't take as long to psych up and finish their lifts, and the weights and rack heights don't change nearly as much.""  

Oh... right... groce grils....  

**Groce Grils**  

So we went and had pizza that the organizers had bought for us.  It was cold by the time we got back there, but I would've eaten just about anything.  Really glad I had more than my little turkey sandwich to eat.  

So back to it... I did pretty much the same things I'd done for the morning: spot and load squats and load deadlifts.  On bench, though, we were down a guy, so I set rack heights and did lift-offs for anyone who asked for them.  Also did the blocks again, more frequently for the girls.  

None of the girls matched /u/600Ibs's puke fountain of awesome.  However, during deadlifts, one girl did take the ""pee on the bar"" cue a bit too literally... and a different girl just decided it was a good idea during squats.  We tried not to call too much attention to it or anything, just clean it up as best we could and move on.  Didn't bother me and, having a wife who has given birth to two kids, I know this is something that just can't be helped sometimes, no big deal.  Just something that I guess girls might have to be prepared for (guys too, I guess?)  

Also, I made it through the day without misloading!  There was a near miss, where I loaded wrong, the main judge said bar's loaded, and no one caught it.  I did catch it just before the lifter made it to the platform though, since I was checking the screen for the next lifter, so I told the judges and fixed it before the lifter made an attempt.  On the very next lift, one of the judges said I'd misloaded and that a plate had to come off, so I took it off, checked the screen again, and said, ""I think it was right before....""  He realized that it was, and I put it back on, again before any attempt was made.  

**Thoughts and Advice**  

Okay, so as noted above, I do think volunteering at a meet is a great way to get involved in powerlifting if you've not done a meet before.  

There were about 50 lifters that came through our platform.  Since I spotted them on squats, that means I did about 150 reps following competition instructions (squat / rack commands).  If you were only to compete, even if you did five competitions per year, it would take *10 years* to get that much experience, and I got it in a day.  Now, of course, I didn't have the bar on my back or the stress and nerves of actual competition, but I still had to wait for the squat command, squat down, stand up, wait for the rack command, and rack the bar.  Similarly, just hearing the commands for bench and deadlifts over and over, you get into the rhythm of it.  So that experience, to me, is extremely valuable.  

Volunteering advice: don't be like me and just sort of show up, not knowing what to expect.  If you don't get the information you need, *ask*.  I ended up being fine, but it would've been a bit easier on me if I'd known what to expect.  

Advice for lifters: if you want one of the spotters to give you a lift-off for bench, by all means, ask!  We were more than happy to do it.  However, communicate how you want the lift-off done.  I asked one lifter when she wanted the lift off, and she said, ""Uhh... I don't know...""  So I said, ""How about count 1 2 3?""  She said, ""Okay,"" and then unracked the bar before I could lift it off.  Hah, awkward.  Fortunately she completed the rep, but I felt bad since I didn't really lift it off for her.  Anyway, her next attempt, we communicated better, so it worked much better then.  

Also, if you realize you set your rack heights wrong, go to the scoring table and fix it when giving your next attempt.  We operated off of what was on the screen, not who the lifter was.  We could certainly change it if we were asked afterwards, but by that time, you're eating into your 1 minute countdown, so we're scrambling.  Fix it at the scoring table!  Makes it easier on everyone.  

All in all, it was a good day.  It was nice to meet lifters in my area, go through the commands a million times, and just generally see how meets operate.  Next time I'm at a meet, I hope to be competing, but I'd certainly volunteer again sometime in the future.

Started with 295x2, which I thought I hit.  Then I watched the video (below) and noticed I was squatting high.  I tried 305 a bit deeper, and couldn't get past the sticking point.  Backed down to 295 again, got one, but on the second one, again, couldn't get past the sticking point.  

Vid (shows all three sets discussed above): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VUtpL9P1D4  

My current program is 2 days per week of squats (1 day high bar, 1 day front squats), that increases in intensity over 3 weeks.  It's the Greg Nuckols/Omar Isuf 2 day per week squat sample program that comes with art/science of lifting.  

So, my thoughts are:  
1) Increase squat volume at lower intensity,  
2) Work low bar for a while, and/or  
3) Add glute accessories such as hip thrusters.  

I also betrayed all that I know to be good and [tried low bar with 295x2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRU0so4_5so).  Obviously I lost my balance a bit, but at least completed the reps.  

Any thoughts/tips?  Thanks much!  ",Weakpots,[Form check/advice] Plz halp with my squats,http://www.reddit.com/r/Weakpots/comments/3bmfdg/form_checkadvice_plz_halp_with_my_squats/
