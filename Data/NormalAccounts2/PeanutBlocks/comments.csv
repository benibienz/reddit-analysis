97,"I happen to be using an MSI R9 390 and a Dell U2515H 1440p monitor. I've been running Witcher 3 on high settings without AA and the game is smooth and beautiful. With a 390 you'd probably not get to play at Ultra settings but high instead. 

Another reason you should go for a 1440p monitor is because your monitor is probably going to last you for a long time. When you upgrade your GPU in future, you'd be able to run on even higher settings. 

But damn, 1440p high looks so much better than 1080p ultra. Trust me on this! ",2015-10-29 14:57:53+00:00,cwh6wr0,1,t3_3qp3i5,7819,pcgaming

During the training it'll be tough, but once you enter unit life, it'll be much better. Basically most days are 8-5. The pay they are offering to diploma holders is pretty good as a 3SG is about $2.6-2.7(same or more than a 2LT). 
Please take on night classes during your contract to secure your degree, so that if you want to leave the force after 5 years, it'll be easier transitioning out. ",2015-08-17 04:58:53+00:00,cu5lbrx,1,t3_3h6ugg,64888,singapore
