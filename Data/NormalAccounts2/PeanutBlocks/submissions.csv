I then received an email that my order is being processed. 

Today I received an email from EndClothing stating that they had a stock issue and the shoes are no longer available and they are not able to ship me one and offered me a refund. 

Is this common? Its such a bummer that after the joy I felt when I managed to cop one and now it just turns out to be a disappointment. ",Sneakers,EndClothing stock issue with Tubular Nova PK,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sneakers/comments/4i568f/endclothing_stock_issue_with_tubular_nova_pk/

I really don't know what's causing my phone to not go into doze. It's really disappointing. My phone has been awake for way too much when I'm asleep. There's no way to see which apps are causing all these wakes also. 
Why is doze such a half baked feature?"
