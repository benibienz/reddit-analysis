I've never been taught how to play when I was younger. Over time, I started loving the sport and I want to get serious about it, maybe join a club. The problem is, I don't have the money to pay a membership nor do I have the skill of those who are members without paying because of their skill (don't know the term in english).  
Now I'm 16 and I've been going to the court on a daily basis for a month, hoping to improve as much as possible before the ""admission exams"" in early 2017. I usually train for 40 minutes to 2 hours, including spiking, serving, passing, setting and mostly everything else. I'm not good and that worries me, but I've been getting some progress lately. Right now, I can set pretty decently, pass as well, block quite effectivelly as I'm about 6'2, my spiking is inconsistent but sometimes I can make the ball hit the ground pretty hard in the 10 ft line and my serves are decent as well, but I can't jump when serving, mainly because the court doesn't have enough space for a ""run up"". I've been improving my techniques based on youtube videos and advice from better players around me. Ocasionally, there's enough people for a game so I play for as long as possible, some days reaching 4 hours of training/playing.  
I'll start working out, so if anyone could suggest a good routine that'd be great.  
Basically, I want to know if I can get actually **good** and what I should do to get there. Any help is apreciated and thanks in advance.

I know there are three movies that cover the Golden Age Arc, but I'm a bit confused as to how many Arcs there even are, which ones the anime covers and what in the world I'm supposed to do now. Should I whatch the movies? Should I read the manga? If so, should I read it from the beginning?
