56,"It looks like you are pressing too hard, you can see that the 6 is bending towards the 5th string (putting the note out of tune).   Also, when doing an exercise like this, your finger should be right next to the fret.  This will make it so you don't need to apply as much pressure.  

Try starting this exercise higher on the guitar, with the index finger started on the 7th or 9th fret.  Play nice and slow trying to do as little work as possible. Speed will come later.

When I start students off with exercise like this I usually get them to lift off each finger after it is done playing.  You won't get the stretch that way but you develop your finger independence and dexterity.

109,"It seems like is it could be a good idea for a game, and I know some people have already mentioned this, but I think posting when you have so little content is not a great idea.  

You call the game ""addictive"" yet you can't possibly know that as there is no game to play yet.  Also, saying it is ""like no other"" is a big claim and you should make sure you have a some reasons to back that up. 

I have heard a lot of developers lament the fact that they ""missed their own wave"" by promoting at too much or too little or at the wrong time.

I do like how the character classes look like they break out of the Mage, warrior, rouge, thief cliches.  It would be great if you could explain the classes and their relationships.  I think co-op is a great idea.  Would it be local or networked or both? 

Anyways, I love games like this I really hope it works out for you.

Finally went to look at this great rental.  I got along really well with the owner.  He even outright said he really wanted me to move in.  

Now the guy had a really sweet wolf/german-shepherd hybrid that followed him everywhere.  I thought, ""okay, of course this guy is going to cool with me having a dog.""  so I asked...

He started asking me how long I was away at work (~6 hours a day) and whether I would leave my dog at home during that time.  He said he couldn't rent to me because it would break his heart to see a dog locked up that long.

116,"IMO: it is almost always better to teach someone something that is too easy rather than something too difficult. 

Get some software that can slow down music and get the kids to play along.  Even if they are playing a super simplified version of the song it feels kick ass to play along with the original.

At the start of the lesson I say ""lets warm up"" and then we work on some technical exercise for 5-10 minutes.  Saying that you are warming up makes it seem less boring than if you say ""let work on technique"".   

Always end with something fun.  Play a song.  Play a game.  For really young kids, play 'simon says' and let them win.  Seriously, they love it.
