10,"Wow, you might be harsh at what you say but you're unfortunately right -_- I see warriors being able to do a lot of the things I wish I could do with my mage and cleric. 

The thing is I don't have good warrior weapons, I have FGA and GMSU and the most common armor and helmet buffs in white but weapons are important. My warior weapons have S smash power up 3, S ko effect 3, Lightning enchant effect and that's it. I don't have the muramasa or a S stun effect 3 or a S warrior slayer so that's why I don't use warrior. I probably don't have warrior weapons because I never used my 34 warrior tickets...

30,"What other games are there like this on the 360 though? 

happy wars is the only online rpg game where there's classes and gear for specific classes? And it's also free to get. What do you want people to play destiny? That game is literally a farm quest, just doing the same levels hoping a gun will drop that shoots laser beams wow that's new. 

On the xbox one there are online rpg games but they're not class based. Tell me one xbox game that's similar to happy wars in the way that it has classes and specific gear for each class that's popular, please do. Overwatch? That has classes but it's a FPS so that doesn't count. Until then just let people here have fun, if they want to hate let them, who knows maybe some have really bad lives and come here to feel better.

Edit: You also said that it's not hard getting to the top 100, but tell me when someone has used that as an insult, oh yea no one has, thank you.

Thank you for your time, have a nice day and I'll be waiting for your game recommendations, if you don't reply then you're just trolling.

110,"It's an amazing weapon for warriors (because it is for warriors...). It's S stun effect is deadly if you can stun your target; clerics can't attack and guard so if you just  shield charge or dash behind them, they're Basically dead. Mages are really fragile, smart ones like me will make sure to keep their distances from scarlet tooth users but if you can catch them by just dashing with your mob 10 dash then they're dead once at close range or you can throw rocks then dash and do the same. 

I've always wondered what it's like against warriors since they can Shield and Attack, in my head it seems like its difficult to land a stun when they're blocking but then I've seen some Stun warriors get mvp against smash effect warriors and wonder how they can let themselves get stunned when they can nullify it by blocking. 

Also Stun res 2 can nullify stun so if you encounter any with this buffl it'll be very difficult to defeat them.

182,"Well like some people say, some laggers can't help their lag, yes they could move to a better place with better connection, but not everyone is rich. Next some laggers aren't all that cocky, theyre nice people and shouldn't be treated bad because they lag, if they don't spin on you and never brag then they shouldn't be excluded. 

But then there's those laggers that think they're all that because they can distract 4/5 people in a team, can take down the gate by themselves because they can't be paralyzed, wind swapped or stunned, and can tap the big tower even if there's 4 people swinging at the tower in hopes to catch them. 

Also some laggers have really good tips and opinions, for example (and I'm not trying to "" suck up "") razorbeam, literally everyone claims he's a lagger but when it's time to express how one feels about a certain aspect of the game or give out tips to others, he can be very insightful, people just down vote because he has the same personality that sergeant has.

348,"Taylor with a q stated in an archived post that ap rec 3 with ap rec 2 is better than ap rec 3 with hp ap rec 3, obviously hp ap rec 3 also gives you an hp rec buff, but for mages alone, taylor with a q said that ap rec 3 and hp ap rec 3 is SLOWER than ap rec 3 and ap rec 2.

Next, yes S magic 3 is better than s slayers if the attack is high enough. For example, most weight 11 magic weapons with S magic 3 reach a max magic attack of 2000 at lvl 15. Now there are some S slayer weapons that can reach 2000 attack as well, but you must have magic 3 on them, a popular build I've seen is the dust devil (weight 12, S warrior slayer) at lvl 15 with 2000 attack. Weight 12 magic weapons for the most part if not everyone of them can reach 2500 magic attack or around 2300, don't believe me on the weight 12 weapons since I don't use any, so sorry about that. My wing of chaos magic wand I had a long time ago before I mistakenly removed a buff instead of erasing it which had Farther wind blast in white -__- reached 2000 magic attack at lvl 10, so I guess it could've reached 2500 magic attack. There are also some people which waste 2 slots in their weapons for magic attack 2 and 1 so they can reach 2500 magic attack, not sure if it's for fun or if 2500 makes a big difference although it's silly for me to say that since attack in general makes a big jump every 500 points. Also my madame canary wand will reach 2000 magic attack at lvl 15, but I use it because it gives me more options for the rest of my gear, for example I see almost every mage with that monocle accessory with conserve 3 and they add conserve 2 with weight reliever, personally I like other accessory buffs which I don't want to brag about. 

So to summarize this, you're obv going for a mage so ap rec 3 with ap rec 2 is FASTER than hp ap rec 3 with ap rec 3 but it of course gives you some hp rec. S magic weapons with regular slayers are better in my opinion since most weight 12 weapons can reach 2500 magic attack with slayers and the more attack the better, yet there can also be a weapon build like the dust devil I mentioned which is also weight 12 and with magic 3 can reach 2000 magic attack for a S warrior weapon at lvl 15. I believe that mage weapon with S magic 3 and fire enchant effect can reach 2500 magic attack on early on, I might be wrong but that's what I've seen. 

Hope this helped, I am a  really laggy and terrible player which reaches the top 100 in the 360 so I might be wrong, thank you for your time.",2016-04-04 13:20:36+00:00,d1pa31b,1.0,t3_4daljx,7951.0,HappyWars

480,"If Im staying back it's probably because I'm getting rushed by chaos blade anti material 5 warriors/berserkers. And I'm pretty sure I would know when I sta back, considering the fact that I alwyas try to rush for I don't really Know what. 

I mostly stay back when going against you and whoever youre with because you rush with your chaos blade along with 2 or 3 others, so rushing while you rush when razor is guarding the gate with anti guard 3 doesn't make much sense. Not that I make a difference guarding or rushing since I don't have more than 1k hours played.

Next, I'm sure I would know when I lag, if I did lag don't you think it would make sense for me to rush with remote bomb and anti mat? Your warrior hits me 95% of the time so I don't know where lag comes from.

 Also I don't want to sound like I'm making excuses, but my rt button like the one you use to use magic for the most part for mages doesn't seem to work as well for hw only, yes what a coincidence, only hw, but it's true, you might've not noticed and probably no one else either, but whenever I block, I keep blocking for like 4 more seconds when they're behind me. You can say I'm making excuses but it's true. I even try leaving it on while I do something else so that it might work for one game, and say I'm bs right now but when my rt works and I play mage, I'm not as bad as you think, well against many here it doesn't make much difference, but against others I can get 1st for like 3 matches straight. No not against bots -__-

Once again for lag, I have noticed that some mages miss wind blasts but some of those are just me dodging them because once you play as a class for a while you know how to dodge most things, like moving to the side when a warrior throws a rock at you, even though rse makes that ko nothing, unless you have 6 people after you because one wasn't enough to stop you.

Well that's all, I'm not a lagger, maybe it's ""regional"", maybe you just like bashing bad players that are nowhere near to your level because you're bored, oh well. Second, if I do stay back, I'm probably lagging like turtle movement speed, chaos blades are juggling me, or my team is too good and I won't make a difference. 

Nice talking to the infamous straps, I'll be awaiting your reply
