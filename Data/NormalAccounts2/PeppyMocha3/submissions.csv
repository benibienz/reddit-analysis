I'm not really sure how to say bye since I never really liked getting attached to things but I'll try to make a good farewell.

*cough cough* Do Re Mi Fa!!! Ok I'm ready for my Type my life.

When I first arrived on this subreddit I believe to have arrived when ALV was still here, so I guess for a lot of time, but not really since I also arrived when Nommy and all those before him were no longer here except for that one time nommy and strapz 1v1'd and one of them won (cliff hanger!!) 

I am not really sure what to say lol this shouldn't be that dramatic but I was one of the people that brought random joy and if I am gone then the amount of positvity will decrease.

But in my mind what I see is all the competitive people staying here while those looking for a different kind of fun and happiness go to happy dungeons but that's IF the beta is good which someone said there would be one on August something.

It was a pleasure getting to know all of you, seeing what kind of internet people there are should prepare me for the future. I didn't really pay much attention to clans other than PTC TLS and ALV since they were the most hated. 

In terms of players I liked... Uh... All of you haha...ha.

Anyways it was a pleasure meeting all of you and being part of this subreddit, I am a little upset since I never got dash+ but realistic-wise I got a lot of buffs pro players could've used except for my 6 S mage slayer weapons.

Anyways we have all had times when we think ""gosh darn it rawr!!! If you didn't have that skill, I would've won!!! Rawr!!"" Like when a warrior rushes to the gate and calls it skill or when a berserker uses double spinning blade all game long and says ""get gud"".

Or when a cleric spins on you after turning you into a flower because that's the only way they could've killed you, or when an engineer one hit drills you and you think"" LOL ultimate weapon is the only reason you killed me you little poop""

Or when a mage runs with mobility 6 and an anti material 6 wand trolling your whole bots because not one has lightning enchant, or when wind trap and wind swap are all a zephyr can do, which then makes them think they're good for ""strategically positioning myself far from your reach""

So all in all, what skill would you like to have banned from the game and yes we're al aware that it will never happen but hey we can try to be somewhat postive or should I say "" ey wee can trice too b somewut posytiv"" make sure to be as creative as possible because positivity will make everything great!

I think smash is better because farther wind blast is rendered useless when they're dispelled, I'm sure some hide behind their bots and warriors and that's smart you know because if they got too close, got dispelled and died, then their team would have no support so standing back with farher wind would be useful.

Literally 90% of the games I play have lvl 16-53 on my team while the enemy has 5 lvl 60s and 1-2 lvl 40s, please explain that logic, not to mention those noobs on my team aren't even my friends, HOW DOES A LVL 16 GET INTO IMMORTAL!!?? Now I'm not trying to brag about what I'm going to say but for the most part I got Mvp in all those games and the difference in score between me and the closest teammate is about half, so I get 1736 and they get 995. 

I was just in a game, I was the only level 60 against 5 lvl 60s, thanks toylogic.

Next comes defense, where do I start? Many say defense is the easiest part to play because you barely move or do anything like really? You're telling me that guarding the gate while 3 people rush, one hits from far and one resurrects is easy!? I would love to see a video of one of you trying it and suceeding. You know what the worst part is? My 5 teammates have to attack against 3 people 3!! 

So you would think ""ok so why doesn't 1 of those 5 come and help you?"" Oh LOL you thought!! No one ever helps me at defense EVER!! I always have to attempt to defend against 70% of the enemy team, like it's so pathetic and aggravating. I mean I guess I deserve people telling me ""that's what you get for playing solo"" but that's because there's more pressure when playing in a group and if you don't do good then you're stigmatized by everyone. I'm sure being in a clan is fun but then I would join the competition everyone here participates in, exposing others and their flaws, no thanks, I'll just stick with losing due to noobs and pros not knowing how to defend.

Lastly, I can't leave defense, because if I do then no one defends and we lose faster than we would've if I defended because I can at least stall them for the most part, and there's been times when I go and attack, and take down their big tower by myself, but that hardly ever happens since I'm always defending.

Because unless you have a tower with 9 energy, they'll be faster.

Then there's times where both teams build their towers at the same time but one gets 6 energy and the other gets 5, so they get a head start even though you both built it at the same time.

None of the boots offer regen, contraption's regen will be removed so that only leaves that green regen health item on the defense category whose passive grants health regen for that hero and whose active heals nearby teammates for 2 seconds based on their missing hp(sorry I forgot the name). 

It feels like they're updating it so games go by faster since the health regen has been removed from those items and thus lead to weaker roam. Now obviously some roams have built in passives that allow them to be tankier but Ardan is the only one that heals when hit, then Phin gets extra defense on his items, Catherine's heroic offers shield and armor, adagio is the only roam that can heal by skills.

With that in mind it would be nice if you vainglory proffesionals could perhaps suggest ways on how roams might receive health regen or become tankier with the upcoming update and changes.

I mean I want to try it because if a warrior attacks the gate while defending then it would deal much more, BUT then again warriors can simply use super guard, throw rocks, and of course one hit the turret with charged attack, so I'm not surs if it's worth putting on an engineer. 

There are other options like the warrior or berserker since there are many times where they can use it in many more versatile ways.

Then Mages were already addressed. The last ones are clerics and I don't see how they can possibly make any use of it, I mean a cleric 1v1, antiguard is never needed and what warrior will let an antiguard cleric near them?

So yes I'm aware I'm bad, I still don't get why people call me bad when I admit it on here, yea o em gee I'm talking to you, learn how to read.

Anyways Warriors constantly spin with their shields up as if I was afraid to go near them and melee them, no I'm not afraid, I'm just not dumb. You really think I'm going to try to melee fight you with no smash effect when you have S stun effect? You're funny. ""Mages are op since the addition of anti guard 3"" oh really? I keep contradicting myself when I say this but for the majority of warriors here it doesn't take 2 shots to go through your shield, you're just plain delusional. I've shot about 3 super (RT + A) magic shots at most of you and that brings your hp down to half, and just so you know I have 2100 attack and warrior slayer when most of you only have wind resistance. What happens next? Dash attack, release gg. 

Next reason to run away is range advantage, why, just why do people with range advantage think they're good? I'm not saying I'm better, but if you want to spin on me with your S farther range enhancements then you must be joking, I cannot reach you, but you can, so how is that a fair fight? Oh it's not.

Next reason, there are more than one of you attacking me, one is spinning on gate, the other guarding in front of them, what can I do? I super magic shot the first but they're still alive, again 3 shots with warrior slayer and anti guard, they don't have anti Magic guard or anti mage aid, yet you still have the nerve to say it takes 2 shots to go through your shield, okay.

Next, there is 5 bots following you and you're right behind them all with one having dispel. You're spinning, why? What am I supposed to do? I don't have range enhancements, if I wind swap you. You'll just hit me since you're just looking at me surrounded by dispelling clerics and if they can dispel then they can heal. Can I get healing? No, because as soon as my bots come they die. Because a 5v1 bot battle is fair. 

You have dispel and I'm a mage, now obviously this affects very few Mages since most have smash effect 3, but I dont, so There's no point in fighting a S Stun cleric or a S KO cleric or a Attack reach up smash effect cleric.

Whoever says warriors aren't op are delusional.

Yes Mages can one shot most people, but they can be dispelled, obviously not by warriors so in those fights they might have a higher chance at winning. Before any of you say ""wind trap wind swap gg"" can you just sit and stop talking, last time I checked wind swap+ doesn't exist so not all Mages can get it without either being lucky or using 3k happy Stars (because whoever uses tickets is either rich or plain dumb) to hope and get wind swap if they already have wind trap, but do warriors need to use 3k to get dash? No, all warriors and even berserkers have dash, and shield charge cannot be obtained by skill mastery. So yea that's that.

Warriors can really only be slowed down by ice which takes 1/2 of the average mage's ap because it takes so much mana to throw a snowball but it takes less to harness the power of lightning, logic.

""Ever heard of S. Range weapons dip poop? Exclusive to mages so you can just stand back and shoot away scrub"" it's not like everyone has range enhancements, dash is included for all warriors and berserkers and shield charge is so common, you can get it in lite, so stop talking again. 

So I've covered range enhancements and wind trap and wind swap, next have you guys heard of rocket man? Yea did you also know that that skill is 90% guaranteed a one shot? How balanced, so both have one shot skills, warriors now have the fastest mobility in the game, what's next? Invincibility? ""It's called lag, ever hea-"" no you noobs I mean literally invincibility.

It's one thing this game has the worst servers ever, but can they last make the classes somewhat balanced? Obviously clerics are support so I don't expect much from them, Mages have everything they need, but warriors have so much more than they need, it's so pathetic.

First off, no this isn't proof that I lag lol I was just wondering if anyone could take some of their precious time to record a gameplay where I'm in and post it or send it to me showing how bad I lag, I understand if this post gets down voted because of me technically using someone, but if I were to record myself, then it wouldn't be the same, my perspective will show me with no lag, but then from someone else, it might show me lag.

I've been told by some people, not most and not few, that I lag when they can't kill me, which in some cases it's just because they're somehow worse than me which is surprising. Most people can hit me, I can get slowed down by lightning, frozen and even killed by warriors, so I doubt it's that bad, plus I'm mostly on defense for the most part, which is a good thing if I lag, except for those times where those that attack me alone can't hit me and I kill them. 

So that's basically it, if anyone could then please do, if not then just comment About how laggy you think I am. Many have told me that I lag but to the point where my lack of skill cancels out the lag, so I'm not that laggy.

So this is just a tip to anyone that plays 360 and sees that guy on your team, either leave like most of the people because staying is a waste of time, or try to stay until the end and not get stuck to a pole, which is what I do because all of them hate me lol.

Edit: I guess the title is a little too generalizing since there are other leagues sd well, so this just applies to those in the immortal league. Actually, this thread might be too angry, I need to apologize for making such a rude post, I guess I should think before I touch a covered screen, in reality, the true nature of my soul has yet to cross such a harsh celestial meaning.

Warning: The question above is the only thing you should be worried about, the content below is just me ranting about this subreddit, therefore you should not be worried about the rant below, thank you for your time and have a nice day!


Taylor with a q, this is relevant because I said happy, which if you can hear, is the title this subreddit is based on, I mean if you go to the website, then you can hear happy wars when you touch the screen letters in braille , which makes this post relevant. 

Actually to be honest, you guys don't really post anything entertaining other than insults to other players, like can you guys brighten up and actually make fun posts like me and other guys like that random person asking for questions and posting videos that are not 30 seconds long and about killing someone because they spin on you, I mean let's not be hypocrites here, you guys spin on everyone and make fun of everyone, so videos and threads like that are really lame imo. 

I understand most of you are pro players and I guess want to make yourselves seem mature by not posting anything odd that won't help anyone, but if that's the case, then this subreddit will keep going as the most boring one, even thought this is the first one I've been on, so I guess that's biased. 

Anyways my main point is, I understand you guys are all grown up wannabes but you could learn to have some creativity without having to ""roast"" someone, just make fun posts and this subreddit will be lively, as for the game, it won't get better, I don't want to hate on toylogic since the servers have been like this for such a long time, the only things that bother me are laggers and lobbies that can't process how to balance teams, I mean it's a computerized server, it's pathetic that a human can count better than a computer. By the way, I might lag, but at least I don't have lightning res 5 and anti mat 5 with the chaos blade, so stop hating, plus I am really bad, because bad and laggy players are those that rule over being in the top of the league leaderboards or it's those that just play with laggers because they know that if they play alone, then their skill level is -infinity. 

I just realized that the part above made me a hypocrite since I said that you guys make fun of others and I just did, so my apologies but that part above is a fact. I mean perhaps some of you don't lag at all and are still up there, obviously if you don't lag then this doesn't affect you, so don't hate even though I'm hating on laggers, but I am really not, I am just reminding them of how much skill they lack, but want to think they're good by spinning on those that can't hit them gg. 

Anyways I think that's it for my rant, thank you all for your time, hopefully you guys become more lively and can do more than just make threads of you saying how bad others are, like make fun and helpful posts for once. Oh now I'm going to get posts telling me how I need to grow up, but there can be adults that have fun as well, you might learn a thing or two.

Anyways is what this should be called, but yea anyways, than you for your time and have a nice day and thank you for reading all this bye, unless you skipped all the way down, then that doesn't count.

First off shield charge is op. How? Why don't you just shield charge your way through a mage's antiguard attack? I also said it is fair in a way that it helps warriors get out if situations where they are getting blasted with antiguard Magic and that's their way of getting out. Furthermore, clerics and mages don't have ways of making themselves invincible, I understand why mages shouldn't have ways since they're mostly supposed to be for attack, but then clerics have no way of being invincible when they're the supportive class. Ultimate weapon doesn't count since it's a team skill and cannot be spammed like shield charge, yes there's those that are perhaps some of you that are literally just ultimate weapons that have shorten CD 200 and just drill non stop, but they can be shield bashed to explosion and killed during that 2 second interval where they're standing still for no reason. I also think shield charge should've been for clerics like many others have said.

Next buffs, where is the new buff for the mages?
There was shield charge for warriors, then there was that smash buff for the cleric, then there was that new buff for the mag- oh wait they got skipped, and moved back to warrior to give them yet another buff which was a smash buff, so where is the new mage buff? Hopefully in that new set of gear that's coming.

65,2016-03-23 23:41:48+00:00,self.HappyWars,https://www.reddit.com/r/HappyWars/comments/4bp5vu/shield_charge_buffs/,False,"Why does this grant invincibility?
Don't even say ""that's the dumbe-"" because it's not. This mother trucking buff just adds up to the many attributes that make a warrior op. I mean I understand how it's fair since a warrior can't do much when they're getting pierced through their shields with antiguard Magic and it makes for great combos during 1v1s, but it can stagger and grant invincibilty which then leads to dash stagger non stop, how can someone break loose? Oh yea you can't and last time I checked, Mages and clerics don't have anything that makes them invincible, ultimate weapon really? It's a team skill and you're not invincible, you can be staggered till explosion and then killed during that 3 second frame where you're paralyzed for no reason. Mages are all attack so they really shouldn't have any defensive skills, but the shield charge should've been for the clerics like many others mentioned.

Lastly are Mages ever going to get a new buff? Like warriors and clerics just got new smash buffs, there was shield charge for warrior, then smash for clerics, then they skipped mages and moved on to warriors with another smash because that was necessary. I don't know what new skill mages could get but at least give them something for a change.  

""Why don't you just become a warrior so you could stop bi*ching?"" Because im just trying to hope that the game becomes more balanced in terms of buffs. lag and host and all those Idc about, buffs are different, yes they're influenced by lag and host but when there isn't that much lag then they matter.

Audience: Yes! Yes!

Well cry no more, here are the secrets every top player uses to get and easy win and later promote themselves as skillful players

1. The chaos blade: oh no all top players just sighed because they use this weapon and know how much 'skill' it takes to be good with it. This demonic blade forged from the ancient depths of Azarath has the most wanted buff in the game; S longer rush, a buff that allows the user to rush for at least 15 seconds! With this blade you can get rush from one half of the largest maps in just 15 seconds and with a bonus you can knock all those pesky bots off your path. With this buff you'll be the one to spin on all those that spinned on you at one point and claim you have a lot of 'skill' by just pressing A once! WOW. Let's not forget that even with anti-material 1, you'll knock down the gate without taking as much damage as you would normally, how skillful is that for an amazing weapon like this one. If you ever get this weapon, your skill level will increase by 9000!

2. Ultimate Weapon: when you're holding off the enemy at a reasonable rate and they're not getting anywhere near your big tower and you see ""the enemy has built the Ultimate Weapon"", you know you're doomed. This team skill is probably one of the most devastating skills in the game as it transforms the weakest engineer into a massive and threatening mass of drilling junk that can one-drill most enemies with no armor, especially mages, since warriors in the upper leagues are not going to get obliterated by these horrors and perhaps some tanky clerics. This team skill is the ultimate resort to pro players when they're not good enough to destroy your big tower. With this skill, even one UW will be enough to win the game when you're attacking the enemy castle since you'll be drilling everyone and one-laser spawnkilling others along with your chao-tic (chaos blade + troublesome) friends that will juggle all those around the UW. If you get this buff, Super UW doesn't grant that much of a difference, but you could equip it to gain that super fancy buff, although it is highly recommended to have cannon durability so you could drill even longer.

3. Anti-guard attack + zephyr: now this buff might not go well with warriors and clerics, although it does work well with engineers in spinning spray machine guns since there might be some anti mat warriors that will get at that perfect angle where they might guard and attack the gate at the same time, so this buff could be handy.
Now for anti-guard attack, it is best if it is put on any type of mage or zephyr since you could stay at a distance and fire away to those pesky clerics and warriors that 'skillfully' and 'strategically position themselves behind their shields' and deal about 1/3 of the damage you would do to them according to your magic attack. This buff becomes useless when a dispelling cleric comes along so it's wise to have either a range-enhancing magic buff such as S farther thunderbolt or a physyical buff such as the most popular and irresistible Smash Effect 3, which in all honesty depends on luck since there will be times when you juggle your opponent for 2 seconds before they start juggling you for the rest of your hp.

4. Happy miracle: This is the ultimate key to success as it enables your team to win any battle situation you're in, but beware that if there are one or more UW, then you might want to either rethink your happy miracle timing, or if time is running low, utilize it, have some guard bash the machine and then have the rest take the towers. This works especially well at the end of the game to dominate the entire enemy fortress.

SUMMARY: 
1. Rush with chaos blade towards gate using professional amounts of skill.
2 + 3: UW your away across multiple enemies and pave a clean road for your building friends and bots while anti-guarding mages pierce the defenses of guardians.
4: Happy miracle next to enemy gate once it is shut down and when your teammates are having difficulty taking down the tower so that they could spin on them and show off their ""skill""

Now this might seem like a warrior hate rant and since I am a cleric/mage, I guess it can be taken in a crude way and hopefully I don't get banned but I don't control that. Anyways the first thing I'm tired of seeing even though many don't mention this anymore, is that ""warriors take a lot of skill to use"" and I don't disagree since they are the only class that can attack in a variety of ways, unlike clerics that can only mash X or unlike mages that can only press X and RT as their only way to a combo, so sorry but clerics and mages don't have much variety, so stop getting mad when you're being juggled in the air by a cleric or mage with Smash effect 3, but at least they don't have a one shot combo like getting juggled then being smashed for 3/4 of their health. Second off, warriors have OP speed, I'm aware that mages are the fastest moving class in the game without dash, but let's not forget that warriors can reach a mobility speed of 10 when they repeatedly move the left stick forward and mash A until they stagger their target to death without them having any way out. Yes I run away 24/7 but please tell me what a cleric/mage can do when they're being dash attacked with no way out even if reduced status effect is equipped. Next, warriors are the only class that can guard and attack simultaneously, please oh please tell me what a cleric/ mage without antiguard attack is supposed to do agaisnt a warrior guarding with a scarlet's tooth up against a wall, get stunned to death? thanks. Since I am already hating on warriors, why not hate againts every class, robot engineers are annoying af and require no skill to use, yes you read right, robots with shorten cooldown 9 that spam A with smash power up 3 and all class slayers are OP and are unstoppable unless there is at least one person guard locking them in place and when a robot runs away for a second and drills and repeats until they run out, it's not easy getting close to them and locking them, yes lightning mages are useful since they can in a way, lock them in place, but those robots are usually followed by their fellow teammates, such as rushing warriors and resurrecting clerics, how joyous. Next come mages, oh my f-ing gord, how annoying can mages with antiguard attack and farther lightning be, I'm sorry to all those mages with zeus' thunderbolt, but don't think you are good when you can kill someone 20 feet away because of your unstoppable lightning bolt, it's not fair that you can hit them withing your range while they can't so please stop thinking you are good, because range does matter and you have every right to feel good when you went 30-2 because no one could catch up to you, but there was nothing I could do while being paralyzed in place and getting struck with lightning magic shots and thunder specialist. Well this concludes my rant, I believe I've gotten everything out of my chest, oh sorry in this forum I have no chest, I'm just a blob of fat, oh well, same as everyone else I guess. Have a nice winter break everyone, I'll be looking forward to you spinning on me after you dash me to death, drill me off the map and/or zap me from 20 feet away.
