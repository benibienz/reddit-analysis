1,"Worth noting that this is just the regular pubs I'm talking about, which are often on the end of a residential road, often built in to the terraced housing, so they have a social responsibility not to be open too late. If you want bars and clubs then town centres and the like will often have them open late. But I don't, because I'm too old for that shit on a schoolnight! With the early kick off though I could make it back in time for the Sunday Pub Quiz.

Just for context, I'm talking of a 35km as-the-crow-flies journey taking up to 3 hours.

Wembley can be a right pain in the arse to get home from, even though I only live on the outskirts of London, and switching the back to 6pm local time kick off would likely mean not getting home until gone 11pm, which is bloody annoying because amongst other things the pubs are shut by then.

To be honest I don't think age is that important, it really is just a measure of the passing of time, not a something which you should be defined by. The day you turn 20 you will still be the person you were the day before, so don't fear it. If anything use it to accept who are and understand that by your 30th birthday you will be a different person again, but see that as a positive thing. It's not the moment you turn an age that's important, it's the days that have happened in between. 

If you're the same person at 25 as you are at 20 then what have you really learnt in that time? So don't worry about being 20, it's not your age that's important, it's how you've lived the days to get there.

There's a couple of instant points that spring to mind, mainly that the casters said that Pavel had recently been operating at a 70% win rate in tracked tournaments, but it's hard to know how much weight to give that without knowing the level of opposition he faced.

However I think it's certainly possible that, as you say, above a certain threshold most players are within a level of skill that over a best-of-seven series the chance factor is bigger than the skill factor, barring any clear misplays. i,e, if both players play 'perfectly' then it's essentially a complicated coin flip.

AAA games cost more to **make** than they ever have done. It's just the cost of distribution that has changed, and I'd wager that's a pretty small percentage of the overall cost of making a game. 

The rest I pretty much agree with though. It really is up to players to vote with their wallets, and it's clear that many people are fine with this model because they continue to support it financially, and as long as that is the case it'll continue to scale up until there's a tipping point.

One thing that might help explain this is that the +/- figure you see on the diplomacy screen is a modifier that is applied every turn. So if you have -3 for 50 turns then you end up 150 points in the negative with them, meaning that getting it back up to +2 isn;t in itself enough to make them happy with you, it will take time to drag the hidden 'current standing' figure back to 0 and then up into the positive. 

In previous civs you could just get that figure to show positive and everything was hunky dory, but in this one the effects are longer lasting. The flip side is that if you can get them as a plus modifier early doors then the points stack up in your favour.

I'm not saying your system is wrong, just wondering how you went about rating historical players against ones you saw? Unless of course you're in your 60s, in which case it's a moot point. ",2016-10-26 08:29:18+00:00,d9892ey,1.0,t3_59g4tm,6632.0,nfl
180,"I pre-ordered Civ VI. I did so because there was a huge amount of footage out there of it being played bye whichever YouTuber you want to trust, as well as spending time in the hands of the gaming sites. The official 'reviews' took longer to come out, some only yesterday, but the general nature of the game (complete, working, excellent, needs AI improvements) was very clear before then, and it was a nature I was happy with.

With this announcement however the chances of me pre-ordering a Bethesda game drops to zero because you would see nothing but controlled information.",2016-10-26 07:57:19+00:00,d988ie6,3.0,t1_d97rhd4,29843.0,pcgaming
181,"&gt; they did not succeed in creating a single player experience that lives up to advertised expectations (more than warfare as a path to victory, AI capable of using these systems)

Here's the thing, on this count they very much did achieve that. I've won a Culture victory, and think I'm on the way to losing to a Religious win by Japan, and they're the only two games I've playing past the mid-game. Early wars definitely play a bigger part in this game than before, but in my experience settles down a lot after the warmonger penalties start to increase. If you have the impression that the game is nothing but a battle-fest then it's a misleading impression.

I need to reiterate what I've said elsewhere, even as the game stands I think it's possibly the best in the series, and I used to pull all-nighters back on the original version. I think perfectly balancing a game of this nature with just internal testers is a near-impossible task because of the long, cyclical nature of game development and the limited hours of testing available compared to when it is released.

I understand how it is easy to get the impression form various forums that things are in a bad state, but I think that's just the amplified nature of complaints on public forums. This is a seriously good game in the state in which it currently stands.

186,"For me it doesn't need a few months, I'm having a lot of fun playing it right now. It's not that it will be fixed for me after a balance patch, it's that it will be even better. Of course different people with different play styles and different priorities may think differently, but that will always be the case. 

Civ V was the only one that I really had a big problem with at release, and it wasn't until the first xpac that I switched over from Civ IV, but this release is very different to that. Because of the rise in streaming and previews we had a lot of data ont eh game to work with before release. We knew it was fundamentally sound at Prince level, and we knew that the AI was a bit shonky at times. There was hundreds of hours of actual gameplay to assess this on. 

For those who view an excellent AI as important to their enjoyment of the game then there's clear logic in waiting. Likewise for those who are heavily into multiplayer. Neither of those are that important to me though, it's the civ-building aspect that I enjoy most, so I was happy to pick it straight up and feel I've been rewarded with a strong contender for my best game in the series, even in its current state.",2016-10-25 14:30:10+00:00,d971nkx,4.0,t1_d970a1y,1979.0,Games

189,"I very much disagree that it's a broken game. It definitely has its quirks and oddities in both AI and general gameplay, but every game has those, and they always have. The very first Civ game shipped with an exploit that allowed you to create an irrigation of a mine in one turn. 

If anything I think the term 'broken game' is used far too quickly these days. I have about 25ish hours in the game so far and the AI has been good enough for me to hugely enjoy the game and look forward to playing it when I'm unable to. That isn't a broken game in my opinion, it's a game which the vast majority of aspects work excellently, and a few are not as good. 

How you view the importance of these depends on how you play the game. Those who want to play the highest level will notice the annoyances of the AI far more than an average Joe like me, and those who play Online will notice the exploits more. For you average civ player though neither of these feel at all game-breaking.

I absolutely disagree that the release is a failure, it's a brilliant game as far as I'm concerned, with the overall mechanics and gameplay more than making up for the idiosyncracies of the AI. AIs have always been exploitable to one extent or another, all you had to do was find the way to game the algorithm. What has changed these days is that people don;t just complain that the AI is broken, as would have been the case back when games shipped on floppies, but now people expect it to be fixed, and if anything that's a positive step forward.

191,"There's been a couple of fundamental shifts in game mechanics the really differentiate this from every other game in the series. In the other games your City tile was where all your buildings were put, and the land was just there for farms, mines and trading posts, which just adjusted the resources those tiles gave you. The tiles were improved by a worker who would basically live for ever and take 2/3/4/5 turns to create an improvement on the tile.

In this version you place a lot of improvements on the map itself, and they gain bonuses from adjacent terrain, meaning that you are far more closely tied in to the geography of where you found a city. 

For example in all previous games you'd just build a library in your city. Now you have to place a campus on the map and build the library in the campus. This may sound like a minor issue but it is a revolutionary change to the most fundamental aspect of the game. 

Additionally they have completely changed the government system to give a new flexibility to it, and split the tech tree out into two complimenting tech trees. And workers now no longer live forever but have limited but instant effects. 

This is probably the single most revolutionary Civ release to date. I understand that as a self-professed outsider it may not seem much to you, but as someone who has played every Civ game, and also played a lot of Madden and FIFA, the comparison between their yearly increments and this huge change after six years doesn't really work.",2016-10-25 11:08:49+00:00,d96val0,2.0,t1_d96tyw3,4256.0,Games
192,"I'm fine with a Civ game releasing that largely requires just balancing, especially after the release state of V. I think a lot of these balancing issues only really come to light when the great unwashed masses get their hands on the game, because when you go through the iterative process of play testing games like this you grow into a set of assumptions about how it works and basically become institutionalised. 

It's only when everyone else gets their hands on it afresh they ask ""why does this happen"" without the historical view of how it came about over the development cycle, and what may have made sense and be an improved version internally, looks a bit wonky from the outside. At that point you may be thinking ""yeah, but you should have seen how it was before"", but that doesn't actually matter to people playing it for the first time.

I just hope they use the influx of data and opinion to make balance changes sooner rather than later, because these days sitting on your hands for a few months is not par for the course.",2016-10-25 10:56:11+00:00,d96v1mn,2.0,t1_d96uazs,2353.0,Games

194,"I think the problem with reducing things to a number is that the value of a review for me is in the detail. If I know what a person likes or doesn't about aspects of a game then I can better see how it maps to my tastes. 

For example the music is pretty irrelevant to me because in the vast, vast majority of cases I turn it off. What annoyed me about Destiny was the inability to do this at release. It definitely reduced my enjoyment of the game.What I like about sound is often the small details. For example in Civ VI there is a section in the bottom right corner with notifications which has a sort of mechanical-looking design. When you click to dismiss a notification there is a small noise and the mechanism moves down towards the main section, and when you dismiss the last one it withdraws into it with a hugely satisfying whirr and click. It is a tiny bit of sound but it is absolutely perfect. That's the sort of thing I appreciate.

As for graphics, they just have to be Good Enough. I was playing Civ VI on my friend's 4k rig on one day with settings at Ultra, then I came home the next and was playing on Medium (I think) on my 2k rig, and it hadn't even occurred to me that the graphics were different until he pointed it out. It had literally zero effect on my enjoyment of the game.

What is important to me though is game mechanics. Ideally I want a number of game mechanics to feed into each other to progress you through the game. For example in Terraria you need to cut down trees to gain armour to allow you to survive longer so you can mine better gear which gives you better weapons and armour so you can survive in better biomes and get new stuff to craft better items which allow you to beat the boos which drops loot so you can... etc etc. Mining, crafting, fighting and building all slot in together the enbke progress in one of the other areas. This is also the case in games like Stardew Valley and Civ, in a way it isn't so much in, say, Hotline Miami or Call of Duty. They have forms of progress, but it's the numerous areas cross-affecting each other that I like. This is probably a form of Variety in the way you list them above. 

Whereas I couldn't care less about story in games. I want to make my own story rather than be bound to the one they are telling. 

Finally I want to make it clear that I don't think there's a right and wrong way to enjoy games, it's really just personal taste. Someone else might see a variety in CoD's guns that to me is all just the same. It's all just personal taste, and that's part of why I don't think putting a number to things is that useful to me.

I like the concept of the new cities, I understand and accept the potential flaw that is the AI. I have done my research on what I will be buying. I have played every Civ game since I and enjoyed them all.

Every bit as importantly this weekend is a rare opportunity for me and a friend to get together and put double digit hours into the game. This will not happen again for at least a month, maybe longer. We have played every Civ game together since the original, so we want to start this game together. For that reason playing it **this weekend** is important to me.

233,"They are essentially resource management games where you have to balance a load of factors, such as food, production, money, science and income. In many ways that;s the core of the game. 

The balance is achieved by building different improvements in and around your city, whilst also balancing it with the need to build a miltary. 

For example in Civ V you may find yourself with a Civ running low on happiness, so you start building colliseums to add smiling faces, but that causes your science to slow down so you go straight into University in many cities, but two town improvements in a row could lead to your military being underpowered, at which point you neighbour Gengis Khan starts to take an unhealthy interest in you...

That's a simplistic version bu gives an idea of the sort of juggling act you'll be performing. Initially you'll be reacting to problems but in due course you'll learn to anticipate them. 

It's a game that can give back to you what you put in to it. Most of all though, get stuck in and don't be afraid to lose. If in doubt there'll be guides popping up here and on civfanatics.

282,"Nonsense. The PS4 Pro isn't competing with the PC, it's competing with the Xbox revisions.

the consoles are in a battle against each other because they know there's a massive market out there of people who don't even consider the PC as a gaming platform. MS are trying to shift into a twixt and tween market by slowly unifying their platforms and turning the Xbox into a W10 Store machine with a few bonus exclusives, and it's a sensible way forward.

Playstation need to focus on their core console audience more than ever to solidify that position. They're not interested in trying to compete with PC, but just to make sure they have a viable console offering. I think talk of a PS5 is missing the point, I'm not sure there'll ever be one in the old sense. 

MS have committed to saying a game you buy now will work on all future console platforms, and Sony will have to match that or lose the war. As a result, the era of buying a console and having to start your game collection from scratch should be over. Everything will now have to carry over because the first console to go against that will lose.

Edit: As pointed out below, there is an aspect of improving to prevent defection mid-cycle, so in that aspect I agree there's a measuring up against PC, but my main problem with the article was that I disagree with a lot of the tone the author takes towards that aspect. For example:

&gt; a console industry obsessed with the lengthening shadow of PC and the toxic topics of 'inferiority' and 'master races'.

&gt; a new, iterative console within three years of the original. It seems a bit mad when you think about it

&gt; That hyper-awareness of the PC market, where the power of your gaming experience is limited only by your bank balance (and attraction/aversion to neon backlights) has permeated every fabric of console development

&gt; this bizarre need to compete when it's both irrelevant and potentially harmful for the rest of the generation

They're the aspects I don't agree with. This is the shift in upgrade model with full back compatibility that I'm talking about, and in those iterations they're competing with each other. The reason the PS Neo was delayed in announcement is because they needed to find a way to beef it up to match the new Xbox, which beat them to the punch. That is direct competition with a challenger in their own gamespace, and that is why I say they are up against them for more than the PC.

302,"For me there are few, if any, FPS games that I have played that have much variety, especially CoD. I'm not a big fan of shooters, so the variety of guns and armour makes very little difference to me because it's all still just on-the-rails running around shooting. To me that isn't variety. 

To me, Terraria has a lot of variety in gameplay. You can spend a session building and decorating your house, you can go spelunking, you can do some boss fights, you can go fishing. Even the weapons have greater variety because of the drastically different nature of approach between a Yo yo, sword and wand, with armour tailored to each. It is, in many ways, like GTA in that respect.

Note that I am not saying you're wrong in your description of CoD, but maybe I'd class it as nuance rather than variety. Variety I'd class as having lots to do, whereas nuance is the small but significant differences in the way you do things. I also think nuance only becomes apparent when the player is of a certain skill level or investment into the game. I can appreciate the nuances between the various weapons in Terraria, and often go out with multiple guns for the right situation, plus a yoyo, sword and wand, but with shooters I can only really get sniper, machine gun and pistol.

I meet my mates at one of the main train stations in London and we go to one of the nearby pubs for a few beers. There's always people in team shirts even if it's four or more hours before kick off and you're still 45 minutes from the stadium. 

We then make a move with a couple of hours to go and take a 20ish minute tube ride to Wembley. That's when we start the game of ticking off a shirt from every team. 

We'll wander from the tube to the stadium taking in a bit of the atmosphere and spotting more shirts, maybe grab a burger or hot dog from a stall along the way. It tends to be the Bills, Browns or Texans that's the last shirt to be spotted. 

Then it's into the stadium with half an hour or so to go, get some beers in, watch the warm ups and generally chat shit. I'm a big fan of the warm ups, especially the kickers and punters. 

Once the game is over it's all about getting to a tube station as quickly as possible as it's a bloody nightmare to get away from Wembley and they shut all the bars in the stadium.

317,"It was. I'm going to paste in what I wrote in the other thread. Please note I'm not defending the initial call in any way shape or form, just commenting on the review situation. The tl;dr is that there isn't clear footage of the ball being picked up by any player:

I have some sympathy for the officials. It's a quirk of how the initial decision is held to be correct until there is ""incontrovertible visual evidence"" that proves otherwise that means something like this can happen.

We see the running back take the ball in and it falling to the ground. We see him standing up with it afterwards. What we don't see at any point is clear footage of him picking it back up from the ground before a Redskin has had it in his possession.

Without that key footage it is possible that a Redskin picked it up, was downed by contact, then the Browns player grabbed it off him and stood up with it. It's improbable, yes, but the video replay rules state that there has to be ""incontrovertible visual evidence"" that the decision is incorrect, and you could argue that all we have is circumstantial evidence, because there's no clear footage of the ball between it being dropped and it being held in the air. Were the video replay there to ref a decision from scratch then it would have been ruled to have been recovered by the Browns, but it's not, so it wasn't.

Let's be clear: I think that the Browns pretty clearly recovered it, and the refs who made the decision on the field made a huge error. This is where the real problem occurred. I can just see how the way the video replay works means it couldn't be overturned.

As a parent of two young kids it helps that the day-to-day cycle provides discrete packages of gaming, meaning that if I only have ten minutes to play, and that's often the case, I can play a day and it feels like a meaningful spell of gameplay.

407,"Learn to make a base tomato sauce that you can then customise. 

Firstly cut up an onion, three cloves of garlic, and about a cm of root ginger (opional). 

Add a couple of teaspoons of olive oil to a pan and cook the onion over a medium heat. You want to stir it every 20 seconds or so for about five minutes. You want the onion to be translucent in the middle and browning around the edges. 

Add the garlic and ginger and fry for another 30 seconds, stirring all the time. You may need to add a bit more oil if the onions have taken it all. 

Next add 500g of whatever meat you want and fry it all up until the outside has changed colour. 

Add a tin of tomatoes, a teaspoon of salt, and a good shake of ground black pepper, stir it up, bring it to the boil, then drop it down to a simmer, so the sauce is gently bubbling away. You will need to stir it every five minutes or so until the meat is cooked through or it is the consistency you require. 

Once the meat is in you can start to customise it. For a basic curry you can add turmeric, ground ginger, ground coriander and garam masala. Half a teaspoon of the first, one tablespoon of the others. 

If you want a chilli you can add ground cumin, chilli powder and a beef stock cube. (I find that chilli works best with minced beef). 

If you want Italian you can add basil and oregano.

You can also use things like curry paste or mixed herbs instead of adding herbs/spices individually. It's a decent option for a beginner to concentrate on the sauce itself first. And tbh I use them myself when I'm feeling lazy. 

A few things to note:

Tomato-based sauces always improve overnight, so they'll be better on the second day. They also freeze well, just make sure the meat is fully cooked through when reheating. 

All measurements and timings are approximate. As you get more experienced then start changing things and see what happens. 

If you're American then coriander is cilantro, minced beef is ground beef, and colour is color. ;-)

""The new Code incentivises early cooperation and information sharing by persons who are accused of committing doping violations. Admitting a violation can be rewarded with a reduced ban, with WADA having the final say on any reduction. Anti-Doping Organisations can agree reduced bans in return for the provision of ‘substantial assistance’, that is, information that leads to other doping violations being uncovered. In exceptional cases, WADA will have the power to agree to eliminate a ban in its entirety and offer complete confidentiality in return for substantial assistance. (Article 10.6)""

Firstly you don't have 100m, 100m backwards and 100m sideways, and then all of them again at 200m. 

It's almost unheard of for any runner to attempt more than two distances. Part of the reason is that running takes more of a physical toll on the body due to it being a weight-bearing exercise. The musculoskeletal effects are significantly bigger than in swimming, which has a greater recovery time needed. 

Running also has a far greater worldwide competing population. If you look at track medals the diversity of nations represented over the last few Olympics alone is huge compared to swimming, so you have an overall more globally competitive sport, and bigger overall talent pool. 

And finally, you can tell it's not the case by what actually happens. Two gold medals is regarded as exceptional in running, and three is historic. Two is routine in swimming because it's so common. ",2016-08-06 07:57:25+00:00,d66h804,3.0,t1_d66dgwr,10245.0,todayilearned

I don't think there's a problem with that as long as they understand it's not guaranteed to happen. It has done with Terraria and the Souls series, but it's not something that can be counted on. It's not like when I started gaming where your only chance at getting hints and tips was to buy a monthly magazine or call a premium rate hotline. 

Anyway, that's kind of deviated form the point, but I think we're actually largely in agreement on that front. ",2016-07-29 07:23:59+00:00,d5vmeaj,8.0,t1_d5vm504,733.0,Games

Not only that, but it leads to a greater discrepancy between juiced and non-juiced players. If you have them legal in the NFL but illegal in college then rookies will come into the league underweight by comparison and needing several PED cycles to catch up. If it's allowed in college then the problem shifts to the High School to College transition. Effectively PEDs become mandatory as soon as they're legal. 

Some would say we're already in this situation. 

There is an argument that players on IR should be exempt from the drug testing rules, but again that means that teams and fans will expect them to take HGH for recovery, but there are health risks associated with HGH that some players may not want.

The option I've put forward would be a massive change to the game, but not as big as OP's. The game play would still largely be recognisable as the current game, because you can still put big hits in in rugby, they're just of a slightly different nature. It would mean the ballistic tackles would be reduced for more technical tackles. 

I'm not sure in American fans would accept a game that didn't valve helmets and shoulder pads though. I think both in their symbolism and what they allow for in terms of tackling, they are integral to the game for many people. ",2016-07-19 12:51:41+00:00,d5i2imw,3.0,t1_d5i2000,1067.0,nfl

If you remove tackling altogether and make it flag football then you have basically lost the sport as we know it. But what if it changed to be more rugby-like?

Specifically you got rid of the pads and helmets and had to wrap your arms around the player when you tackled them. It would remove the offensive 'hit them and hurt them' aspect to tackling, but would retain the defensive 'stop the ball carrier' aspect. Would you still watch then?

This would put Blizzard in the position of having to either police it in the real world, place severe restrictions on trading within the game to prevent it on that front, or tacitly accept that their digital goods have a real world value, and that may present all sorts of financial issues around the game (for more details, see the current CS:GO scandal).

August 5 at 3:00 AM PDT – Summer Season Points Cut-Off

August 19-21: Americas Summer Preliminary

September 2: Australia and New Zealand Summer Preliminary 

September 17-18: Americas Summer Championship

September 24-25: Europe Summer Championship

September 30 – October 1: Asia-Pacific Summer Championship 

Will they want to have a meta so completely in flux during the middle of a championship season? They would have wings opening up during the weeks of the NA and EU Summer Championship. 
They could potentially fit a four wing opening in between the NA Preliminary and the Championship itself, or else they could possibly fit it in between the AsPac Summer Champs and Blizzcon. This would then leave December for the expansion release.

I'd not be against having a Summer Championship with a fresh meta as it would reward those who could identify and create decks at short notice.

The ease of making a game has opened it up to pretty much anyone with an idea and dedication. 

Take Gunpoint for example. The developer himself has said he's no programmer, but he made a game which is brilliantly paced, contains challenges on a number of levels, has interesting mechanics that build upon one another, and is brilliantly written. This game only exists because there are freely available game engines that large numbers of people can learn to use if they knuckle down to it. Go back a decade and the game simply wouldn't have been made. 

Add to that the increasing discourse around game design and the availability of the discussions on YouTube, reddit, podcasts etc and you have a medium that is critically analysed in a way it never used to be, at least not in the mainstream. 

When I first started playing games on the BBC Model B it was viewed as something kids do, but as my generation and those after me have grown up still playing games it has slowly moved into mainstream culture, and that has fundamentally changed the nature of the landscape around it.

When England played then often these hooligans would put their local differences aside to go on the rampage abroad. 

What is happening now is partially a hangover from that, because whilst England have gone a long way to reducing their hooligan following by forcing convicted troublemakers to report to their local police station every day during the tournament, foreign thugs still see it as a badge of honour to fight the English fans.

Which many decisions get reviewed?

How far back in the play do you go when reviewing a goal? If a goal is scored from a corner do you check for any shirt pulling in the box? Do you check if the corner was correctly awarded in the first place?

How do you deal with a penalty claim that isn't given? Who chooses if it gets reviewed? If play goes on pending a review then how do you deal with anything that happens in that time? Does the time get put back on the clock? 

How long can the video ref review for? How many camera angles can/should they look at? We've all seen decisions that appear to be one thing, then another view suggests differently.

Does the ref's decision on the field stand unless clearly shown to be wrong, or is the video ref making a decision from a completely blank slate?

1092,"&gt; This is something I'd like to look into, but may shift the focus of what is currently a pretty simple game into something more complicated.

This is really a key point for me as a player. At the moment the game is a great time-killer. I can dive in and play a season and run my recruiting in 5 or 10 minutes. It's a nice discrete package of gameplay.

Once things start lengthening out too much then you end up having to play in longer sections, or stop mid-season or mid-recruitment, thus it significantly breaks up either the flow of the game, or the potential to play it at any given time. 

I've no doubt there is a market for such a game, but for me it would be better to have a simple version, and then expand on it for a 2.0 or Pro version or such like, for those who want a more in-depth experience.

1115,"Ii agree that there's a lot of perspective that needs to be kept, I only date back to Don Howe so have never had it all that bad, but also feel the time may be right for a change. Also, Wenger is clearly the best manager we've had in my footballing lifetime and has changed the club beyond recognition.

However, for me it comes down to the fact that the same problems keep happening, the season falls apart in a 10 day spell in Feb/March so often that it's no longer that surprising. And after this season I no longer believe we will win the league again under Wenger, and I've long since written off any idea of winning the CL. We have never won it with a team comprised only of players he has bought, and I'm not sure what evidence there is that it will now happen.

So that leaves me wondering if we should be happy with qualifying for the CL every year and winning the odd cup, or if we should have more ambition. If it's the latter then for me we need a new manager. So no, it's not a miserable time, but it's a very stagnant feeling time. 

We do however have a problem when he goes in that he is so utterly in control that I suspect we will lack the infrastructure to properly support a new manager, and it will likely lead to a couple/few years of mid-table and not qualifying for the CL whilst the club moves to a post-Wenger model, but this has to happen at some point. Whether you trust the footballing knowledge of the board to be able to put this in place is another thing.

so in essence it feels like we're treading water under Wenger now and I think it's time for a change. It's not a WENGER OUT!!! position of passion, I'd not raise a banner and I'm open to being told where I'm wrong and a different perspective. And I'm not asking for nor expecting sympathy from other fans. I spent a decade in Pompey so I understand there are bigger crises at clubs, but that doesn't mean that it is';t a big issue at our club that needs addressing.

I think there is an issue with the timescales on this release though, especially the lack of solid information as to when it's coming out. I think part of that was that they had to give early notice about Standard/Wild, and that they have to fit the releases around the World Championship Seasons.

1122,"It'll be interesting to see how they are going to fit the two other content releases into this time frame. My assumption is that they wouldn't release content from the start of the preliminaries to the end of a season, so that the whole knockout phase is played with a stable meta.

That would leave a window in July to early August, and at a push a fortnight in early October between the end of the Summer Championships and the start of the Last Calls. 

You could squeeze an expansion into the July window, with the first wing opening on Thursday June 30th and the fifth on Thursday July 28th. That's then a two week gap until the Europe Preliminaries start.

It would seem unlikely that a full expansion would drop between the end of the seasons and the start of the Last Calls, because it would seem a bit unfair to expect everyone to have two weeks to adjust and create a brand new set of decks. 

That would mean the second expansion of the year would come after the World Championships are finished. This would mean that all three seasons would be played with a different card pool, with there being no changes between the end of the seasons and the final road to Blizzcon.

It's in pounds sterling, but the hardware aspects will still apply.

Regarding the monitor, it depends on whether or not you want to use it with your regular tv (you'll need to check you have the right connection for the graphics card).

Also, it can be a pain in the arse to put together and get working if you've never dealt with hardware before. I was only changing the PSU (power supply unit) and GPU (aka graphics card) the other day and it took a few hours to get everything to talk to each other nicely and all the drivers up to date. Putting together a new PC is not a trivial task if you're new to the insides of a computer. There's also costs for the OS and such if you build completely from scratch. 

So it can be done, but a lot of people who have been doing this for years can fail to realise how complicated it is for a relative novice.",2016-04-01 11:39:51+00:00,d1lnnj8,1.0,t3_4cv0pw,3548.0,pcgaming

1176,"Yeah, I think it's pretty much bang on the money. PC vs Console gaming is a false dichotomy. 

I think that one thing that roughly comes under Point 4 is that consoles are simpler than PC. you don't have to dick about with settings to try to get games optimised, you just stick the disc in and they run at whatever resolution and fps that they run at, and that's that. Given that I don't overly care about graphics and fps (seriously, I couldn't tell you the difference between 30 and 60. I played a game that looked fine to me and I asked a mate what it was running at and he reckoned 20-25) then the ability to know that a game will just work on the console to a level I#m happy with is worth a lot. It also acts a clean and tidy media streaming device for the front room which the family are all happy to use and to have in there.

Having said that, I also own a PC which I have recently upgraded to a new GPU and PSU in anticipation of Civ VI amongst other things. It was a pain in the arse to get it all to play nice together, which involved reseating things to get them to work, getting drivers to work properly, and the general low level hassle that comes from these things. Now it's done though it's future proofed for another 3 or so years for significantly less than a console., but it's not something I would expect the average man in the street to be confident doing. 

Too many people have taken a side in this discussion when it's really not necessary. I play different games on PC than I do on console, and both of them fill bigger and different roles for the entire family than just gaming. If 4k gaming at 60fps is important to you then PC is best. If you don't know much about PCs and mainly want to play FIFA and shooters then a console might be best. And for a lot of people, it will work out best to have both. But you need to be able to recognise that the thing that's best for you isn't always best for your neighbour, and that someone who buys a console instead of a PC hasn't automatically made the wrong choice.

1228,"Hi, I'll chip in with a few thoughts to help out. I've done a bit of amateur reviewing myself so have an idea of what goes I to it, but I'll admit I'm not your target audience. The heavily technical nature of the opening of the review means it will appeal only to a niche audience, and you may need to find where that niche resides to get more specific feedback. I've only read the Rocket League review because it's the only one of the games I've played. 

Given the length of the review I think you need to try to restructure a number of sentences to remove unnecessary words. For example..  

""n terms of graphical options, there are numerous including toggles...""

could easily be changed to ""There are numerous graphical options including..."" 

It only removes one clause, but there are a lot of places where this could be done to make the writing more concise. I understand that this may not be the style you were going for, but brevity is important. After I write my drafts my main goal if to go back through and remove as many words as I can whilst keeping the content the same. 

There are good examples of a concise and clear section:

""Both KB/M and Controller can be rebound, though both only have a single bind per action, and some questionable choices make KB/M unusable for high level play.""

""The HUD scales to the corners, which will make them out of view on wider than 21:9. The wider the resolution, the closer the camera in the menus. At 21:9 the car almost clips out of frame, and on triple-wide setups a good 30-40% of the car will be out of frame.""

Whereas this is a little more clunky:

""It supports SLI well from what I can tell and performance is mostly solid outside of small dips from time to time usually right after spawning in.""

That last quote isn't inaccurate, it just doesn't read as well as other parts of the review, however it is a tricky sentence to restructure easily without losing information. You also tend to use 'effect' when it should be 'affect'. 

I think you're bolding the right parts of the text because it draws the eye to certain key aspects. I'd consider if it's needed so much in the conclusion though because the amount of bold text there overwhelms the standard text in places. 

The analysis of the game play is decent and you've definitely got across where the fun is to be found, which can be tricky in a game which needs to be played to really hit home.

I like that there is a section on progression and pay model because I think that's an important part of modern games that is often skipped over on mainstream sites. Little points like noting that DLC only show up in your garage once purchased are important to some people, and you were right to highlight it as good practice. 

Overall it's a very thorough review of the entirety of the game, covering a lot of aspects that would not be covered elsewhere. I expect to their will be am audience for this kind of review, it will just be a case of finding where it is and keeping plugging away at it. I think a lot of places such as Eurogamer look to get across the spirit of the game, and this is a decent accompaniment to cover other aspects. I hope you stick at it and find your audience.

1229,"I'm in the just don't care enough category. I'm not fussed with fancy graphics, they only have to be Good Enough, and I couldn't tell you if a game was running at 30 or 60fps. I was playing the Homefront Beta the either day and asked a mate what it was running at and he said about 20fps, but it played alright to me. 

Serious lag and stuttering is annoying, but not common enough to justify a new rig, especially when I don't play that many AAA, resource intensive games. Rocket League runs well enough on a four year old graphics card. 

I get that I'm in a minority, but I'm not alone in not caring that much about graphics and refresh rates. 

I also put a premium on convenience, and that's where a console wins out. I'd rather be able to just put in and play a game at 30 fps with poor AA than be involved in the fart arsing about required with some games on PC.

1233,"I very much agree. Gaming as a whole is as healthy as it's ever been, and having played games for over 30 years I've been through a lot of the phases, but there are also aspects that are as bad as I've seen them. 

I think AAA gaming is in a precarious state with the seeming desire for yearly releases meaning that quality can be patchy. Ubisoft appear to have finally realised this, so it may be about to change. 

The mobile gamespace is often a wretched hive of scum and villainy, but there are a few brilliant games out there if you look for them, such as Monument Valley and Desert Golfing. 

And the combination of those two is the appearance of 'micro' transactions in full price games, which is bullshit. 

PC gaming is in rude health though, with a breadth of gaming experiences at a variety of price points that is unmatched in history. 

When I first started playing games you had to load them off cassette tape and magazines came with Basic code that you had to type in to create a game. Phones were things with a rotary dial that came with a cable and the only portable gaming was a little Donkey Kong flip screen device.

Can it be an interesting discussion? Absolutely. Is it anything other than personal opinion that's meaningless in the grand scheme of things?

As for improving, I think it was partially a victim of timing with Druid being so strong, so I'd not worry too much about class diversity. I would say that two decks plus a small tech sideboard would be interesting.  So you have to play with one of your archetypes but can switch in up to, say, 10 cards to either of them. Enough to tweak the deck but keep it roughly the same. ",2016-02-22 19:29:03+00:00,d09m3cz,2.0,t1_d089hre,93495.0,hearthstone

If you punt then the majority of the time they will be on or inside their own 20 yard line, which puts them around 50 yards away from a scoring position.

That's just not true. Football does not do blood testing therefore if you are using any sort of modern doping method, or even just good, old fashioned EPO then you are not going to get caught by any test. And the gains from fitness levels can be huge, as can injury recovery. 

The only way you can get caught is by a whistle blower, such as in the Balco and current IAAF cases, or a decent undercover investigation, such as the current NFL issue, and they are both very rare.

Additionally I disagree about PEDs being scare stories in the way that marijuana in.

Additionally I would suggest the idea that top athletes would stick to a properly controlled regimen may stand up to scrutiny.

Civ however was another of my great loves. A friend and I played it so much that we decided to try to 'edit' it to change things up a bit. You could just change details in the game file, but if it ended up with a different number of characters then it would somehow collapse the file and the game wouldn't run. Instead we would copy and paste sections around the code to change the starting techs or unit attributes.

Now for some people that's fine, but for others, like me, it's simply not doable, due to the competing time demands of job, Wife and kids. This isn't a whinge or complaint, it's simply a statement of how the system works. The ranked part of the game has only just gained any kind of meaning with the chests, before that I was just after the card back each month. I have never had the time to find out if I'm actually good enough to reach Legend.

I'm not saying that I **should** be given anything, instead I'm saying that as it stands I will never have the chance of reaching Legend because there is only ever one month to do it in.

1674,"There's another way to look at it. This isn't proof at all, bit more a form of perspective. 

History shows that in any sport where there is an incentive to dope, with very little chance of being caught, or punishment  if you are caught, then drugs are rife. 

The incentives in the NFL are measured in the millions. The disincentive is minor, because if you are caught then it's a four match ban, and your reputation is left intact because few people care. That's if they manage to make the charge stick in the first place. The amount of time it took to negotiate a test for HGH, and the utter ineffectiveness of the test they settled on, shows that the NFLPA want to avoid drug testing and bans as much as possible. Essentially the equation is massively stacked in favour of taking drugs. 

Like I say, this is not proof that any given player is doping. It merely says that the environment is in place for doping to take place relatively easily. 

Cycling, baseball and athletics have been through this. Rugby, football, soccer, tennis and athletics (again) will have it coming at some point. ",2015-11-07 22:18:10+00:00,cws7u0g,7.0,t1_cwrxtvh,17596.0,nfl

I'm fine with games only having seeding implications, I just don't see the appeal of the league phase being almost all about seeding. Those sports you mention eliminate over half the teams before the playoffs begin. You don't start the season playing for your seed, you start it playing for a playoff place. 

As a Bills fan this is painfully evident to me, but the attempt to reach the playoffs is an essential aspect to the season. There is a significant chance of failure in the league section and that is what gives it real meaning. 

To compare to your March Madness example, if there were only 80 College teams in the entire country feeding into a 64 team bracket, then neither the season not the March madness itself would be anywhere near as popular.

1905,"Firstly, you quote the word pointless as if I said it. I didn't. 

My point is that they are effectively having a 7 week seeding phase in the form of a round robin. You may find a seeding phase that long to be interesting, but it strikes me as potentially very dull. With only one team being eliminated there is a distinct lack of jeopardy, meaning that games between mid-table sides don't have a huge amount riding on them. 

You're right that lower teams may have nothing to play for, but that shouldn't be addressed by letting almost everyone into the playoffs, it should be addressed by prize structures rewarding wins in dead rubbers, and/or having some form of relegation prospect, which in this case would mean no invite to the next tournament. 

A league system is designed to produce a ranking from top to bottom. What I then want from the playoffs is for the best few teams to decide an ultimate winner. If the team that finished 7th out of 8 ends up winning the entire tournament then it makes the previous two months a bit, well, pointless.
