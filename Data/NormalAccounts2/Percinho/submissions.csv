As far as I'm concerned this is a false dichotomy because they are both responsible.

The management are responsible for creating an environment where the players understand what is and isn't acceptable when you are a member of the Buffalo Bills. They create that by applying appropriate sanctions when someone infringes those rules. If players commit plenty of stupid penalties but never see any negative repercussions then it gives off the message that it's acceptable behaviour. If, however, they are sat for a series, given an extra fitness drill in practice, or at the most extreme end cut, then it gives out the message to both them and other players that it is not acceptable. This then scales up to DUIs, PED suspensions etc etc. 

It may hurt the team in the short term to take these sanctions, but by setting up an environment where players understand that if they break rules they will face internal discipline then you reduce the number of infringements, to the long term benefit of the organisation.

On the other hand, it is absolutely the responsibility of the players to conduct them in a way that's appropriate for a professional athlete, and a decent member of society. If you are caught cheating the system or acting illegally then you have to take responsibility for it, and deserve criticism. Whilst the club may set the guidance for what is and isn't acceptable to the organisation and management, you alone have to be held accountable for what you choose to do. 

So we don't need to have a debate about whether or not to blame the organisation or the players, there are issues with both of them. The former appear to be failing to set an environment where such behaviour has internal consequences leading to organisational failings, and the latter are failing to follow the rules of the league, and at time society at large.

Is it due to player ill-discipline, and if so does that end up with the head coach? Are there specific problems caused by players having to match up against people better than them and hoping to get away with infractions as a way to level things up? How does a team go about reversing the trend?

Tavern Brawl has completely changed that. Some have been better than others, but all of them have made me reconsider the game from first principles. Because they often involve situations and interactions that don't exist for me outside of the brawl I cannot rely on knowledge I've absorbed from watching streams, I have to think through it all myself. 

It's also brought me into contact with cards that I never knew existed, despite having played the game from Beta, and this week's Brawl in particular has given me a chance to play with cards I would otherwise never use. 

I'll never be a Legend player, I don't have the time to devote to even consider it, and so Hearthstone was turning into something I dipped into occasionally, but Brawl has given it a new lease of life for me, and I believe it's making me a better player in the process.

I'd like to reach the point over the next 6-12 months where I can do most of the maintenance on it myself. 

I'm starting from the point of literally zero technical knowledge. I know how it works but have no experience in, for example, adjusting brakes or dérailleurs. 

I do however have a copy of Zinn and the Art of Road Cycle Maintenance and a Raleigh mountain bike that dates back to the 90s. My plan is to take it apart, clean it up, then put it back together again. Twice. Maybe three times. Then I plan to do the same with my 10 year old Ridgeback. 

Does this sound like a good starting point to learn bike maintenance? Are there any pitfalls that everyone encounters? Any advice?

Thanks. 

Edit: Thanks for all the responses. It sounds like I need to get hold of some tools first, and then get to work.

How much can you divine about indications as to why we lost the game? Is it possible to identify a particular weak link within our team? I'm fin if you say ""yes, it's you"" because I have no idea what my numbers should be.

Edit: Thanks for the contributions, it's all be helpful to read. For the record the Chen Noped out of the game after a couple of minutes, so we were left with an AI. I didn't really see where he was most of the time as I was too busy trying to keep Muradin and Stiches alive. The former did have a tendancy to go deep, but I'm not experienced enough to know if it was too deep or not. 

Additionally it was on Blackheart's Bay and we didn't have a great objective-focus, which obviously didn't help things. Nobody was shot-calling and we fell behind in XP because we didn't split between lanes properly. 

But apart from the dodgy team comp, the Chen leaving, the poor teamwork and the bad positioning, we had an ok game...",heroesofthestorm,How much can you tell about a game from the stats screen?,http://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/3an5mt/how_much_can_you_tell_about_a_game_from_the_stats/
