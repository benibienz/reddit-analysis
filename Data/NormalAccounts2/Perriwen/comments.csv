312,"We're not talking about deserving MWR. Well, maybe you are. But I'm talking about fans not deserving the treatment they're getting. The fans are basically being taken for granted. 

Frankly, you're oversimplifying the way people have 'cried'. People said 'same old' because frankly, the modern shooter thing got done to death. There was no way someone was going to roll out a new and innovative story by the time MW3 came out. As for the 'new', well...frankly, the 'new' only exists because Titanfall exists and Activision got scared that EA might have a bit of high ground on them. That had nothing to do with what the fans wanted. AT ALL. They saw a game that people loved and got worried. That's it.

And no. I don't buy the whole 'big businesses' are dicks argument, either. There are plenty of publishers out there with a brain that know how to treat gamers right. CD Project Red, Paradox, Bethesda, heck, even Blizzard's model with Overwatch. Trust me, if Activision took lessons from them, they'd be MUCH better received. But no. All they see are dollar signs. And you know what else? MOST of those dollars don't go into development. It goes into marketing and the CEO's pockets. 

And lastly....you DO realize copying has been Call of Duty's entire existence, right? Let's break it down: 

The series started in world war two following the success of Medal of Honor and Battlefield, and remained in world war two until Battlefield 2 went modern. A year later, CoD 4 came out, modern. Then, Medal of Honor Airborne came out, back in WWII. The next Call of Duty game a year later was in world war two as well. Then, Battlefield went BACK to modern, and Call of Duty did, too. This lasted until Titanfall came out, in which Call of Duty immediately went future/wall running/jet pack in the exact same style.

Don't tell me you don't see the correlation in all this.",2016-05-17 01:22:11+00:00,d388wyf,7.0,t1_d3881wt,1325,CallOfDuty

316,"You keep demonstrating more and more why this is wrong in your attempts to defend it...

I find the three year development cycle VERY hard to believe. Again, looking at AW-which they claimed was a three year development. Oddly enough had gameplay mechanics pretty much identical to a game that came out earlier that year, a level identical in every way to a level shown at that year's EA presser at E3....come on. You know deep down that the three year claim is total bull. 

As for 'acting like they deserve the game separate', well...they kind of DO. NO ONE deserves to basically be held hostage by a company that cares more about its bottom line than it does the people who buy from them. They know that a lot of people who want the remaster DON'T want another futuristic/Titanfall ripoff CoD. They do NOT deserve to be told 'Ok, here's what you really want. But only if you pay full price for what you don't....' Which leads me to...

""I'm sure that the rest of the COD4 maps will come out as well for like $10. So that would be $30 for the game.""

So, not only are we making you pay $60 for a game you don't want in order to get the game you DO want, we're also cutting out a significant portion of the game you do want so we can sell it to you later for a higher price. And you're acting like such a horrendous practice is PERFECTLY ok. Congratulations. You're exactly why the gaming industry is drawing the ire of so many right now.

As for the rest of it...I know better. If there's any space battles, you KNOW it's going to be an extremely arcadey/on rails type thing similar to the 'flying' in Black Ops. And the BO3 movement? You know as well as anyone they just copied what Titanfall did. Movement mechanics were identical in every single way. So, I don't even credit them for what BO3 did, they just saw what someone else did and slapped their own name on it.

319,"Yeah, no.

First off, it's not going to be a slap in the face to IW if they sold it separately. Knowing Activision, it probably WILL be several months down the line when they can stop worrying about the new game's sales figures. For the moment they're forcing people to buy something they may not even want to get the full game they DO want.

Secondly, I highly doubt they spent three years making the game. They probably spent two years doing the occasional concept, then within a year got word from Activision on what they wanted to exploit. Sort of like how people claimed Sledge Hammer worked three years on AW-which mysteriously had so many similarities to other games that came out the same year that it wasn't funny.

""The devs seem really excited for it."" You do realize that these are the exact same devs that made a big deal over fish AI and a dog that appeared for a grand total of maybe ten minutes in their last game. 

""And to be fair, they could've launched MWR with the 10 maps at a higher price than an extra $20."" Meaning many people have to pay another $60 for a game they might not even want in order to get the $20 product they do want.

Not only does Frisk catch onto some thermal laws, but also, is able to recognize sexual/romantic tension and use that to their advantage. A similar example would be the male and female guard dogs, and how Frisk is able to fairly quickly plan out a way to disguise their scent.

Another example is how the true pacifist route itself plays out. In order to do what Frisk did, it required a fair amount of evidence gathering, analysis, and putting things together that generally seem FAR too advanced for a four or five year old that still hasn't even figured out a big chunk of the English language, and heck, is just a couple years past figuring out how to use a toilet.

Shop keepers act like they're just another customer. No one's like 'uh, hey, you're a little young to be out wandering by yourself'.
