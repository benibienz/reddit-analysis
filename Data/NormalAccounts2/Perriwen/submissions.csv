At this point, doesn't it just make more sense for Activision to release a Call of Duty 'platform/hub'? Three modules. World War Two, Modern, and futuristic. With three studios, each one can take a module and develop/support it all at the same time. No more need for annual releases, no more need for buying 3-4 60+ GB games that are basically just slight improvements of the last. As time goes on, the engines/graphics can be updated via patches. There's other franchises out there that have embraced this with great success.

So, say, you have Infinity Ward doing a modern combat module, supporting it, releasing new maps, weapons, etc. Treyarch doing the WWII module, and Sledgehammer taking the futuristic module. With three studios working together all at once on a product meant to grow as the years go on, player feedback becomes key. New modes are added in to swap out the modes that just don't work, optimization has plenty of time to be worked out, and file sizes can more efficient. Possibly the 'hub' could be a free digital download while the modules are the $60 (or, more ideally, $40-ish) products, either coming digitally or disks...campaigns could be optional content released as they're done, DLC. If you don't care about campaigns, you don't have to buy it, don't have to install it. But, best of all....no risk of your purchase being more or less dead within a year or two.

Just a thought, I'm pretty sure Activision would scream in horror at the mere suggestion of not raking in millions every year by offering slight improvements.",CallOfDuty,[COD] Annual release cycle and fatigue...and a possible solution.,https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/5b0gmr/cod_annual_release_cycle_and_fatigueand_a/

Now, I know the hats, faces, and skirts are impossible...probably...in DCS. But...the square dancing and cat calling isn't! I'm wondering if there exists any virtual pilots brave enough/crazy enough to form the Virtual US Army Helicopter Square Dancing Team, likely using the Hueys.

As you can see, beyond the documentary, not a lot of info exists...but the concept is way too unique to be forgotten!

Each night, we will have a special guest instructor who will help familiarize you with customs, laws, sanitation practices, and other things you will need to survive in the above ground world.

**Election News:** The next round of polls will be handed out to the citizens this coming Tuesday, one week before the elections a week from today. Thanks to feedback from the last poll, we will be having a place for a write in candidate as some of you have expressed dissatisfaction with the current choices on offer. Please take this seriously, however. We're looking at *you*, Sans.

**Some minutes from the monster council meeting:** Good News! After weeks of complaining, we're pleased to announce that we will be filling in the old waste ditch most of you were using prior to the installation of the permanent latrines.

We're also pleased to announce that we do not believe this development will be of any disturbance to the shade of purple most of you have been ignoring anyway. Speaking of the thing, we're also pleased to announce that the council has voted to officially name the shade of purple 'Phil' in order to make referring to it less of a mouthful in the unlikely event that you should want to mention it. Phil was not sought for comment.

The council has also voted to declare the day of the barrier's breaking an official holiday for monster kind. As you would expect, we need your help to come up with a catchy name for this holiday and methods of which to celebrate. Please place any suggestions in the community suggestion box. Once again, **SANS**, we ask that you please take this seriously and treat the day with the reverence it deserves.

**Sports News:** Friday evening saw a real bloodbath of a match between Toriel and the tentacles, giving monsters and humans both the most exciting match to date! The event was declared a draw after both Toriel and the mysterious beast lay exhausted on the ground, surrounded by scorched grass and the smoldering tatters of clothing. We give special props to Toriel who attempted to scribble a couple autographs as she crawled her way back to her sitting area and put a gallant effort into pulling herself onto the seat. Understandably, she passed out halfway into the attempt. When asked for a comment after coming to, she gave our interviewer some form of one-fingered hand signal before dialing her phone to mumble a bedtime story to Frisk in slurred words, then promptly passed out again. The tentacles were also asked to comment as they inched their way back through the portal, couldn't pronounce much more than ""eeeughhguuhg.""

Will Toriel ever truly vanquish this evil? We don't know. We just know we love watching her try!

Come, listen and join in with the Tem Cheerleading Squad, and enjoy the struggle between good and the unknown. Experience every slap, fireball, constriction, toss, and slam in luxurious comfort for the low price of ten gold! (or, if you bring a book to donate to our champion in the downtime, admission is five gold. That's **half the asking price!** While visiting, be sure to check out the new souvenir shop, exclusively supplying Team Toriel shirts (3G), hats (2G), flags (2G), and robes (5G). Be sure to stick around after the match for autographs, Toriel's anger level or injuries sustained pending. 

There is no set start time for these matches. Just listen for the blood-curdling wailing coming from the anomaly and you know good times are just moments away. And, don't forget: Sans' ConcessSANS Stand is on site to offer hot dogs, hot cats, and a variety of beverages so you don't have to miss a moment when you need a bite to eat.

**Election update:** Those who came out to our rousing debate seem satisfied with the outcome, as both Toriel's supporters and Asgore's confused little groupie lot feel their sides were justified. The conclusion that Asgore is having a lapse in judgement in thinking that if he lets Toriel win, she will love him again, but he will snap out of it has moved him up a timid point or two in the polls. However, camp Toriel is sure that the boost is nothing but a mere sympathy move for king Asgore, and did not clarify if Toriel's now referring to king Asgore as 'Ass-gore' is part of a new campaign strategy or merely slipped out in frustration. Either way, the new nickname appears to be quickly catching on among Toriel's supporters. 

**Science notice:** The science team understands your concern about the portal that has opened up on the rock face at Mt. Ebbot's base, and are working to figure out what in their experiments may have caused the anomaly. Most of the science team are being completely tight lipped about the anomaly, with the exception of course of Alphys, who many of you have seen running through the camp as she babbles and hyperventilates. Our official advise for the moment is to continue about your business, as the portal does not seem to be any for of threat other than the annoyance of the constant howling noise. 

*Addendum from Sans the Skeleton: I say you should stick your face in it, and see what it does. It's a good time.*

*Addendum from Toriel: Please do not actually stick your face into the mysterious portal. Sans, do not joke about this. Someone could get hurt, or worse.*

*Added Addendum from Sans: Aw, come on, Tori. Let these monsters live a little, this may be the only time they get to break space and time. I do it everyday. Look at me. I'm fine!*

*Added Addendum from Toriel: I will stand in front of that portal around the clock, day and night, to keep you all from sticking your face or any part of your bodies into the anomaly if I have to.* 

*Addendum to the added addendum from Sans: Yukyuk. We've seen this 'block the way' thing from you before. You won't last a day, goat lady.*

Asriel somehow makes it through the barrier, and get get back through. Gets adopted by Chara's parents, and is raised along side them.

----------------------------------------------

A journal entry

I, Toriel, am entering this for the record, on March 29th, 2457 according to earth calender reckoning. This is a routine submission, as was planned for the hundredth year on the voyage to possible habitable locations within the Bellatrix solar system. We are not quite half way, but, why not a good even number, right? It should be noted, by the time this message reaches earth, that due to the distance involved and speed of light, another one hundred years will have passed and we should be nearing the end of our journey. I can only hope it inspires confidence upon whoever is now on earth...if anyone is left to hear my message. I know the planet was not without its problems when we set off. Tensions between the three great powers were high, and many in the news media were reporting that this time, it could finally be 'the one'. But, I've been alive long enough to know many times almost were 'the one' in the past. I can only hope that, once again, reason and acting overpowered fighting and violence. 

On that note, it's kind of funny. Today marks four hundred years almost to the day since I, along with the other monsters, were set free from the underground. It is almost impossible to comprehend how far we have come, since the day we came blearily blinking from the underground within an uncertain world, to today, where monster and human have almost become indistinguishable. The ratio of humans-to-monsters within the cryogenic pods is almost a complete fifty-fifty. Who would have thought, that after thousands of years trapped within the caverns of the earth, monsters and humans would one day be joining together to start new lives on new worlds! Frisk would have been so proud to see this day come. I am just thankful...that they got to see the progress they did in their life time. It was only fitting that this vessel was named in their honor. Even the artificial intelligence reminds me of them...in many ways, it feels like I'm mothering them all over again in care taking of the ship. It's very heartwarming, and familiar...often times, I could almost swear I feel their presence around me within the walls of the ship.

Of course, I'm sure it's all in my head. After all, I am the only living thing actually conscious on this vessel, as I have been for most of the last century and will be for the next. Why? Well, why not? I'm not aging...so I really have no need to go into hibernation like the rest. (Although, there is a pod open and ready to me should I ever decide to go that route.) But, for many years of my life on earth, I was always taking care of someone….Frisk, babysitting Frisk's kids, their grand kids, and even adopted another couple of children who have long since grown up and passed on. Now. I get two centuries mostly to myself...I get to reflect on my life, ponder, meditate, plan...and look forward to a bright new beginning. Bored? No...I don't get bored. At least, not often. Here's the fascinating thing about this ship.  Imagine a long tube...and around this tube, in the middle, is a giant ring that spins around and around the vessel, never stopping. That generates gravity close to how it was on earth. I spend a lot of my time within that ring, where the ship's bridge, kitchen, showers...and my cabin, are. Now, in the middle...there is no gravity, and it is within that vast chamber where all the pods sit. They just...line the walls, going on seeming forever, on all sides. And the space in the middle...has become my playground.

When I was first training for this assignment, I was not much good with the floating. If you saw me on my feet, you'd think I was a total klutz at times. But, seeing me in that training aircraft (which they fittingly called a 'Vomit Comet'), you would think me hopeless. I was always flailing about and bumping into everything! I hated it at the time...but now, in the peace and quiet. All I do is give myself a little nudge off the wall and this clumsy old woman could make even the most gifted ballet on dancer look like a total amateur. I'll spend hours just flipping, twirling, swooping, gliding...spinning on nothing but air. It's kind of funny. Back when I was living in the old ruins in the underground, I would go tend to the flowers where...well. There was this massive hole above me. I couldn't climb out, but I could see glimpses of sunlight...and the birds. I always was so jealous of them, just flying freely and going as they wish. But now...sometimes, when I'm floating I can close my eyes, and spread my arms...spread my wings...and fly. Just...fly. Far above the earth without a care in the world...no pain, no loss, just me and the wind. And wherever I want to go, I just turn my body and the wind will carry me anywhere...and I am free. Just free.

Goodness, listen to me ramble! Just like when I'm flying, sometimes I lose track of where I am and what I am supposed to be doing! I still check the pods everyday, and the colonists are hibernating well. Unfortunately, we have lost two of them. The first one passed on within the first five years when their pod's cryogenics broke and they quickly suffocated within the airtight pod. I regret I was not able to get to them in time. The other...was a child. The computers malfunctioned and performed an emergency opening before he was properly accustomed to the ship's climate, and the shock killed him. There was nothing I could do for him, but just to cradle him and try to keep him calm as he faded. Both were given proper burials and commended to the depths, as per regulations. Still...the experts expected a lot more fatalities by this point, so all things considered, we are doing well. Food is holding out well, water recycling works well, and plenty of oxygen since I am currently the only one using it. I'll be sending the next update when the next century has come and gone, then a final one as we close in on the planet and I prepare to bring the crew out of hibernation. It's going to be so weird...two hundred years of peace and quiet, then suddenly chaos! Once more, I hope all going well on earth…..and...one final thing. I don't know if my ex-husband is still alive, but, whoever gets this message, if he is...please find him and tell him….that I forgive him. I know it took hundreds of years, but….there comes a point when every grudge must be given up and every wrong forgiven for one who is truly sorry. If there is one thing I have been taught in this….it's that time is too precious to hold on to anything but love and kindness. If only more people on earth took that to heart, then...well, I had my own reasons for coming on this journey. But let's not get into that now, shall we?

Well, bear in mind, unless Toriel has another biological child, she'll never age again. Frisk, on the other hand, will grow up, have a family of their own, grow old, and die. As will their kids, grandkids, etc. Toriel will not only live to see this over and over, but any child she adopts, this will be the cycle again and again...

Just food for thought. Beyond the warm and fuzzy 'Toriel and Frisk being happy mother and child' of many comics and fan works...poor goat mom is in for a lot of loss and pain down the line. One may consider getting back together with Asgore to produce another child could be her salvation from thousands of years of building heartache.",Undertale,Have you ever stopped to think about Toriel's 'happy ending' isn't so happy?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Undertale/comments/4cebi9/have_you_ever_stopped_to_think_about_toriels/

**A Correction:** We apologize for erroneously stating the giant flaming ball that moves through the sky (also known as 'the sun') poses no threat. Apparently, it will one day swell to enormous proportions and cook, then possibly swallow up the earth. However, human scientists assure this event will not occur for a few billion years, so there is no immediate cause for alarm. Boss monsters, please plan for this in advance. All other monsters, just mind how long you stay in the heat.

**Election Update:** Official statements are in regarding the response to the previous polls. Toriel, as expected, has expressed pleasure and pride in knowing that the monster population has learned from previous mistakes. King Asgore is on record for stating, in response, that 'I am not terribly surprised, either. I know I was a pretty lousy king all this time. Once again, I am sorry for all the suffering I have put the monster population through. Do you think she may ever forgive me?'

On an aside, we wish to note that the debate topic for this coming debate has been changed from the planned policy discussions to 'is the king intentionally trying to sabotage his campaign or is he really that f*cking stupid'? Tickets for this expectantly lively debate are available in the Communal Tent.

**The Science Team** apologizes for the low rumbling and quivers many of you have felt in the earth for the last few days. Alphys assures us that it is merely some routine experiments being done in the underground lab that they never had the chance to finish up, and desire to do so before fully moving onto the surface. We are also assured (pretty much) that the experiments are not connected to the mysterious shade of purple that has appeared over the ditch that no one is talking about. Please be aware that vibrations may continue for a few more days. 

**Good news!** Now that most of you have passed latrine training, the humans feel confident enough to begin issuing passes into the city! To celebrate, Royal Guards Undyne and Papyrus will be hosting a field trip into the city this coming Saturday to give us a taste of human society and culture! Plans include a trip to a human shopping mall (spending money will be provided), dinner at a Chili's (an acclaimed human restaurant), and finally, a performance of one of the humans' most famous shows, *Cats*! This also will serve as a test to see how well monsters can integrate into human society, so please be on your best behavior!

**Special Note from Toriel:** I wish to apologize to everyone who came to help me with the pies last Friday. Asgore's appearance was most unexpected, and I am aware that my reaction was very much uncalled for. Understand, tensions are high between us. I wish to thank Muffett for going ahead and supplying the pastries for the social, and I wish to thank all of you who were so kind to open your tents to Frisk and I while we replace the one I inadvertently burned down in my little outburst. 

**Election Update:** We wish to thank you all for your speedy return of the polls from last week. As expected, Toriel is leading king Asgore by several points, with 76% of the returns in her favor. We are pleased to announce that we have scheduled the first debate to take place within two weeks. However, since Toriel currently refuses to speak to king Asgore, we are anticipating that each candidate will be sending a representative to speak for them in the debate. Please stay tuned for debate time and location. Also, if you wish to be said representative for either candidate, it is not to late to volunteer. Please see either Toriel or king Asgore for details. 

*Frisk refused comment as they have made it clear they wish to remain neutral in this campaign.*

**Latrine Update:** As many of you have noticed, the ground work for out latrines was laid out earlier this week, with plumbing to come this weekend. We are very excited for this development, as we know as well as you do that the ditch has developed quite the stench. We have worked out a deal with a human contracting company to install Port-a-Johns (those are kind of like a latrine you can take with you!) in the interim. 

We understand many of you are still confused at how this new biological process works. To help you better understand, Toriel will be holding a special class this coming Thursday evening at 8:00 PM in the Communal Tent, which she titles ""The Two Toriel: What I Learned in my Quest to Keep my Fur Pristine and White."" Please bring something to write with, and paper. Both kinds.

**Final Note:** Our science team is pleased to finally confirm that the giant flaming ball is indeed no threat, and the changing time frame of which it appears and disappears is a normal cycle in what the humans call 'seasons'. They make us aware that sometimes, the surface feels like the Hot Lands, other times, it feels like Snowdin.

**Introduction:** We trust you are all settling in well to life on the surface. Once again, we should thank the human leaders for being so quick in setting up this tent city for us while more permanent residences are considered. We also thank you for the cooperation in the initial response to the various reactions to human food. We know the ditch isn't the most comfortable place to 'do your business', but latrines are on the top of the priority list. Also, we are pleased to announce the larger dining tent and communal tent are now OPEN. The communal tent will be open around the clock, while the dining tent will be open from 6 AM to 9 AM, 11 AM to 2 PM, and 6 PM to 8 PM respectively for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

**Reminder:** The human/monster nice cream social will be held in the new communal tent this Friday from 7:30 PM to 11:45 PM. Come down to mingle with the surface inhabitants, enjoy nice cream, pie, drinks, and live music. Toriel still requests help with baking pies for the event (last estimate, she needs no fewer than three hundred.) Anyone who comes to help will be compensated for time and effort. 

*It has been made aware to us that Toriel can only offer compensation at the moment in the form of hugs, kisses, and cuddles. We hope you understand.*

**Election News:** Pollsters will be coming around to your tent tomorrow to begin handing out forms for the first poll in selecting the monster who will be taking charge of our new community. Toriel announced her candidacy against ruling king Asgore last night, stating 'Look at how bad off we were all that time, when we could have come back to the surface long ago? Do you really want that pathetic, murdering whelp who can't even come up with a proper name to keep making decisions that affect YOUR life?' Asgore is reported to have responded  simply 'Well, she was the brains of the throne. God, I miss her.' Pollsters do not expect his response to help his campaign. But, YOU get to decide!

**Finally:** We know that many of you have concerns about some of the things you are seeing here on the surface. The giant flaming ball that moves through the sky appears to be the top concern, and the reports that it's simply 'the sun, the source of light for the planet' has done little to ease concerns. There were initial reports that the movement could be predicted down to the exact time it would appear than disappear below the horizon. However, actual tracking appears to rule that notion false as the flaming ball appears and disappears earlier each day. Our scientists emphasize there is no cause for alarm yet.

Toriel eventually earned her license after begging the driving school to let her back into the program, insisting that she would have never done what she did to the instructor had she been sober or told the truth about what was in the flask. Conclusion was reached that the incident was the instructor's fault due to the initial dishonesty. Frisk also eventually earned their license, not that they totally had to keep SAVE/LOADING over and over to correct their mistakes. Muffet, Temmie, Papyrus, and Undyne have all become great drivers (though Undyne still has minor road rage issues), Asgore was eventually found, passed his test, and appears to have his emotional outbursts under control after reconciling and re-marrying Toriel. However, he is not allowed within three hundred feet of the instructor ever again due to the risk of what he may do to them after hearing about the flask incident. Sans is still banned from driving, as is Napstablock...but, they can teleport and phase through objects anyway, so who cares? Alphys refused to ever get into a driver's seat again, and to this day insists she is public transportation's biggest fan.*

*Things have been quiet for awhile. Too quiet.*

**Chara:** Driver was initially well-mannered and very bright. They still could not account for why they appeared to have no record, family, or even a social security number. *Instructor's Note: Thanks a lot to the 'Ghosts and Generated Beings Equal Rights Act of 2024' for making things like an actual origin unnecessary for drivers licenses and credit cards.* Instructor was a little worried about the initial question when the driver was asked to recite the most important rule of the road. Pretty sure 'kill or be killed' was the rule for war, not driving. Driver will need to make corrections on backing out. 70 MPH is not an acceptable reverse speed out of a neighborhood. Remarkably, the driver aced the reverse turn despite that speed. A pass is a pass. Driver then ignored speed limit and stop signs in neighborhood. Police car came in pursuit. Police car burst into flames for no known reason. Lesson continued because once again, instructor side brakes were not responding. Driver ignored red light, ignored right of way rules, and turned immediately into on-coming traffic. On-coming traffic began veering wildly as driver thought it was time to play 'chicken' with every single car they saw. Note: laugh driver was making at this point did not sound human, or even monster. Driver began screaming things about 'kill or be killed' once more. 

Driver abruptly turned off road into parking lot. Driver did not use proper driveway to go into the parking lot. Driver smashed through glass doors of Target rather than parking. *Instructor's note: I am expecting a call from the management of Target about the destroyed merchandise, mass amounts of blood, and body parts now covering their store.* Driver continued through wall and into Bed, Bath, and Beyond. *Instructor's note: also expecting a call from those managers.* Instructor saw the goat-lady driver that once molested them within the store, along with her teenage child that was a natural driver. Goat lady yelled something to the teenager, teenager began chasing the car. Driver continued through the next set of glass doors, tore through parking lot, hopped a ditch, and once more was back on the road. 

Driver went back into oncoming traffic. Instructor had trouble writing with all the screaming. Instructor noticed new obstruction in the road: the goat lady, the teenager, and now the teleporting skeleton appeared from wormhole. Driver sped towards them. Obstacles moved. Driver entered wormhole. Driver crashed car into rock wall of cave that formed around car. Driver got out of car screaming at the skeleton. Now driver, teenager, and skeleton are screaming at each other. Instructor notes lots of loud noises, screaming, and lights. Instructor continues writing on the notepad, because who gives a care at this point. Whatever's left of the driver has now been splattered on the rear windshield. Skeleton is now apologizing to the instructor. Goat woman is now checking instructor over for injuries. Instructor wishes she would not, instructor knows where those hands have been. Teenager also apologizes. Instructor cares not. Gives driver passing verdict anyway, because driver is dead and won't be terrorizing anyone now anyway. Instructor makes sure goat lady, skeleton, and teenager know this. The three are making an odd expression. Verdict is still: pass. *Instructor's note: the bastard of a skeleton wouldn't open the wormhole again until I let Toriel finish checking me over. Something about how the 'mothering part of her wouldn't let her sleep at night' if she didn't. Like I've managed to sleep after she....with her kid in the....dangit, I need another drink.*",Undertale,By popular request: Chara's first driving lesson.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Undertale/comments/4c33sz/by_popular_request_charas_first_driving_lesson/

*Driving school note: Due to the instructor's last incident with alcohol, we decided to monitor them with audio and video surveillance within the car. Unfortunately, the lens cap was left on, but we do have the audio.*

*Instructor's note: I resent this lesson. I know children this young shouldn't be driving. But, this child is the 'great and mighty' ambassador to humans and monsters. Which, apparently means they can handle the responsibility of driving. We'll see.*

**Muffet:** Driver insisted upon bringing a box, which she called 'dimensional'. Said her 'pet' was inside it, and she had to bring it wherever she went. Box was small and fit in back seat, instructor saw no problem. Spider's multiple limbs proved useful in backing out and turning, making the moves crisp and smooth. Very good merge into traffic. Lane changes were incredibly smooth. About an hour in, she made a request of the instructor, to play with her pet for a few minutes to keep it from getting too lonely. Instructor agreed because student was doing so well. Upon lifting the lid of the box, car's interior was quickly full of spider. Instructor then realized why the box was called 'dimensional'. Instructor tried to ask driver what they should do, but couldn't think of words because someone in the car was loudly screaming. *Instructor's note: I now realize IT WAS ME.* Driver's pet began to bear down on instructor, instructor started to smack the pet's mantables with the clipboard as the car continued to drive. Driver showed excellent control despite distractions of a massive spider filling the interior and the instructor shrieking into her ear. Driver recalled pet into the box before pulling into the driveway. Verdict: Pass. *Instructor's note: I think. The second half of the lesson is very fuzzy. But, we didn't crash.*

**Nabstablock:** Driver possessed the car and spoke to instructor through the stereo. Driver's mood was almost unbearable with constant droning and complaining. But, driving was impressive. If you could call it driving, considering the driver became the car. Literally. Interestingly enough, driver seemed to be able to 'talk' to the other cars they passed on the road. Most of them came to hate the driver. A few even wrestled control away from their drivers and accelerated into the nearest solid object. Driver appeared able to multitask, as it continued to be able to drone on to the instructor about how sorry it was to get everyone down and be in everyone's way. *Instructor's note: And it darn well should be. You know, it takes a special talent to force an inanimate object to seppuku itself!* Ultimately, fail. Driver did the tasks well enough. But, for the good of monsters and humanity...chaos will reign if this driver is allowed freely on the road.

**Temmie:** *Instructor pre-lesson note: After the last encounter, I decided to go out and buy myself a flask. In this flask, is booze. It's for me. I'm taking it with me on these lessons. And no one is going to stop me, because -I- am not the one driving.* Driver had some trouble getting into the car due to their size. Very small, but was able to reach the pedals with some effort. Was very cautious on backing out and residential driving, kept rambling about not wanting to hurt any of the 'cute' humans. Now the driver is starting to talk about how rich their history is as we merge into traffic, but god damnit this alcohol was the missing ingredient in these lessons. Lane change was good...maybe. Instructor is starting to get wobbily, so it's hard to tell. Instructor must admit, the driver's situatinal situati...awareness must be great with four ears. It's so 'kyoot'. Two of them are like cat ears, and the other two are so floppy. They are fun to flap. Flap flap falp. Driver asked me to stop flapping their ears. They want to know what I want them to do next. get their cute bootah in my lap so I can snuzzle the stuffing out of them is what I want.

*Instructor's post-lesson note: Pulling the student driver into your lap to drunkenly snuggle them does not go over well. Not for the driver, nor for the overly angry driver of the semi-truck in the oncoming lane. Temmie passed the course, and is holding me liable for emotional distress.*",Undertale,Undertale characters adapt to the surface world: driving part three,https://www.reddit.com/r/Undertale/comments/4bzwck/undertale_characters_adapt_to_the_surface_world/

*Instructor's note: Swore I was done after the angry fish-woman. But, apparently, after reading my reports, the other instructors refused to take on some of the other monster students. Was offered a 200% raise to come back due to my experience.*

**Asgore:** *Note: Had to use full-size pickup truck considering driver could not fit in standard driving school hatchback* Had minor issues settling into his seat, but was excellent in inspection, start up, reversing, and initial neighborhood driving. Minor issue with staring at the flowerbeds as we passed by houses, but was quick to return attention to road. Things went wrong after we entered traffic on the highway and instructor mentioned a quick 'tutorial on lane effective lane changing'. Evidently, something in that sentence was a trigger. Driver began to rant about his ex-wife. Driver began getting emotional. Driver applied more pressure to accelerator. Driver applied so much pressure to accelerator that instructor tried to apply the brakes on their side. Instructor then realized they didn't have brakes on their side because occupants were in a non-driving school truck. Instructor bailed. Truck and driver remains missing. Verdict: Likely fail. *Instructor's note: If anyone sees a blue four-door F-150, license plate number EFD 101, please call me at 555-4736*

**Mettaton** Driver was neither human, nor monster. Instructor initially refused, but, learned the nervous driver from a few lessons ago programmed the android to be sentient. Obviously, the lesson went perfect up until driver entered the residential section again. Driver noticed a self-driving car and asked instructor about it. Instructor explained self-driving car was the future. Driver, being an AI driver itself, took offense. Driver began broadcasting in binary, which the instructor learned was challenging the AI in the self-driving car to a race. Both cars lined up and began to accelerate rapidly down the street. Instructor tried to apply their brakes, only to realize the driver has somehow hacked into the car and disabled them. By this point, both cars were driving too fast for the instructor to safely bail out. *Instructor's note: Yes, there is a urine stain on the seat thanks to this. No, I am not paying to get it cleaned up. YOU put me in this situation.* Race declared a draw after both vehicles failed to negotiate the turn at the end of the street and smashed into the elementary school. No injuries, car totaled, school teacher yelled at for allowing the children in the classroom to become traumatized by two vehicles smashing through the wall. *Instructor's note: teacher who did the yelling was the same driver who bailed from vehicle and sent me into the streetlight over a skinned knee. Still refused to apologize for that, saying 'and now I have all these children to comfort now thanks to your carelessness'. Changed her verdict from 'in progress' to 'failed'.*

**Papyrus:** Driver was extremely friendly and enthusiastic. Claimed to have studied the bookwork cover-to-cover at least six times. Backed out well, drove residential well, handled traffic far better than expected. Driver had a tendency to ramble on about puzzles and spaghetti, but somehow, managed to completely keep his focus. Out of all the monsters instructor had tested so far, this one appeared to be the one most DETERMINED to get his license. Instructor feels confident this one will do well in future tests. *Instructor's note: No, I do not. Turns out, I was speaking too soon. In the second lesson, I was actually feeling upbeat, and told the driver to 'kick the tires and light the fires' as an expression to 'let's go'. Driver took me too literally. Fining him the full cost of a new vehicle.*

So, I present you....the instructor reports from the first driving lesson. 

**Toriel:** The lesson started off well. Driver was polite, very attentive, and seemed to remember the bookwork well. Instructor was a bit curious at why driver wanted to first fasten pillows to the car's bumper to make it 'safer', but took little time to assure her pillows were not necessary as long as she drove safely. Started the car and backed out well. Driving the first two residential blocks went well. Problems arose when driver noticed a child fall off a scooter and apparently skin his knee. Driver then unfastened her seatbelt and threw herself from the car. Unknown what she did next, instructor was too busy trying to grab the wheel and applying emergency brakes. Hit streetlight. Instructor came to and noticed driver now out of the vehicle and cradling the previously mentioned child in her lap, appeared to be rocking it. Child's parents were not pleased with this development and managed to get the child away from the driver after a brief tug-of-war. Was going to fail driver, but driver appeared too emotionally distraught. Recommend counseling before trying lesson again. 

**Sans:** Inspected car, started car, backed out, and handled residential driving well. Initially, handled traffic well. First problem arose when driver fell asleep during monotonous driving. *Note: recommend no-doze* Driver awoke upon hearing instructor screaming. Handled well afterwards, however, when passing by a diner, driver apparently decided it was 'ketchup time' and promptly teleported out of vehicle. Instructor tried to take control, before again hitting streetlamp. Verdict: fail. Driver only qualified to drive a tricycle. 

**Alphys:** Driver appeared very nervous. Took four attempts to back out of driveway. Only moved at 5 mph through residential area. The constant reassuring hums of J-pop are risk of distraction. Once driver entered traffic, all hell broke loose. Driver began to shriek uncontrollably as the 'psychos all around her' passed her at the speed limit. Lesson stopped after driver began to hyperventilate upon drifting into oncoming traffic after veering to avoid a minivan changing lanes in front of her. Driver insisted she could find a place to park as instructor attempted to wrestle control of vehicle away from her. Ultimately, driver didn't see the street lamp in the tussle. Verdict: fail, recommend for professional help. *Instructor's note: one more street lamp, and I am DONE.*

**Undyne:** Driver was highly enthusiastic. Knew book work well, but broke the car's ignition after she tried to start the car with a bit too much gusto. Claimed she knew how how cars worked, and proceeded to tear the hood off. Claim of knowing car maintenance quickly debunked after driver tore out engine in a move to reach the ignition system. Broke the ignition again trying to fix it. Driver threw some duct tape on it, slammed the engine back in the car, shattering the engine. Engine obviously failed to start on second attempt to turn the car on. Driver flew into a fit of rage, ran down the driveway, uprooted a street lamp, ran back up the drive way, and proceeded to beat the hood of the car with it while instructor was still inside. Can not write in report the obscenities being said during this time period. Verdict: driver successfully managed to destroy the car with a streetlamp without even moving the car. Obvious fail, recommend emergency anger management. *Instructor's note: THAT'S IT, I'VE HAD IT! SOMEONE ELSE CAN DEAL WITH THIS CRAP! I'M DONE! D-O-N-E DONE!*

2.) I always got kind of curious if an adult or upper teen fell into the ruins, rather than a child. Again, knowing Toriel, would she adopt them regardless (probably more as a houseguest/roomie), or figure they were independent enough to send out of the ruins after given some time to recover?

I have all the minimum (at least) requirements to run it, yet...every time I try and play a match, the game crashes about 80-85% into loading. Is this a known issue, perhaps some kind of compatibility issue with Windows 10?

You simply lived as a deer-like thing in a forest...except you had a more humanoid face....and you had to communicate to other players through body language as there was no chat system.
