One of the things I really wanted is for Riot to make her E worthy to level up. I find myself leveling that ability only at level 8, before level 5 Q. The huge movement speed buff is what REALLY makes me happy. 

The Q cooldown decrease at later levels will surely make her more useful in fights, instead of just auto attacking for no damage. 

Her auras are okay for the buffs she is recieving. Just need mroe efford on touching your allies.

Now for the problem on her. He heel is too mana expensive for the amount of heel she heels. He has a tiny heal, that only heals max 200 + the AP ratio for 80-100 mana. It's too expensive for her. Now that the Frost Queen Claim item was nerfed (less 25% mana regen), it surely affected her in patch 6.9. What she needs is the buffs on her W in any way.

On 5.22, they thankfully increased it's price for 500 gold because it was just a go-to item for juggernauts or bruisers. It was perfect.

Titanic is the same thing. The passive allows you to basic attack with alot of damage whiile being tanky. Base stats were also super duper good, allowing you to have more health and ALOT of AD. The price is the same, but including the passive and including tank items that you have in your inverntory, it's very very cost efficient.

2134,"Hia! Sona main here! I personally think Frost Queen's Claim mana regen and new active is alot better on Sona. In my elo or below, it's ok to rush Frost Queen's Clain and Ruby Sightstone. It brings much more spammable abilities for you and better peel for both. FQC's active is a seriously strong slow (4 seconds wow), that's either disengages a bunch or engages a bunch. With the Ruby Sightstone, it decreases 10 seconds from 60 and helps a bit.

After that, might aswell get other helpful support/ADC combo items (Ardent Censer, Zeke's Harbinger). Both give mana or mana regen, cooldown reduction and armor in Zeke's way. Both give extra stats to your ADC and 2 or more allies, in Ardent Censer way.

After that, get the rest of your support items if your even or behind, or just go full AP. 

For the boots, I always Sorcerer's Shoes, because you will cap the CDR with other items, and it helps penetrating enemies defenses with Q or ultimate.

Any more questions, just ask.

Edit: Forgot! As for runes I go something like 1x Armor or Flat HP Quitessences, 2x Flat AP, 5x Magic Pen Reds, 4x Armor Reds, 9x Armor Yellows, 5x Flat AP Blues, 4x Flat MR Blues

For masteries, focus on the Windspeeker's Blessing. Even though it might not give your allies resistances, it will give, even though you are healing yourself too. If your getting full CDR, get Intelligence, if not, get armor and magic pen (Precision). You either now want Damage or Defense for yourself.

After her rework, she has been nerfed countless times on the wrong place (movement speed, empowered Q damage, W mana increase) , including the pathetic W heal modifier per % missing health reduced to 0.5% from 1%.

I'm a Sona player myself if you already know, and with the removal of mana pots, using her W will cost 1/4 of your mana, and it drains really fast. Her problem is the increased W mana cost on a heal that's worse than Bard, Nami, Soraka **AND EVEN RELIC SHIELD**.

He really benefited from this due to the mobilty and extra crit damage he had. But now since his new Powder Kegs ignores 60% armor and slows the target, it ""compensates"" the passive and active removal.

Personally, he's much fun to play. New E, new ult upgrades, buffed oranges. Instead of just praying for your Q to crit your target, you now have another ability (Powder Kegs) to harass your enemy.

* Arcade Blade would change positions with Executioner.

* Havoc would change positions with Devstating Strikes.

* Feast would change positions with Dangerous Game.

_____________________

* Arcade Blade would have a small rework. Arcade Blade now deals 8% bonus magic damage equal to 3% of bonus ability power and physical damage.

* Executioner now with 1 point, increases damage dealt by 5% to champions below 50%

* Havoc now with 3 points, increases damage dealt by 3/3.5/4%

* Devestating Strikes now with 1 point, grants 5% armor and magic penetration. (nerf due to Havoc buff)

* Feast now restores 5 health and 2 mana

* Dangerous Game renamed to Critical Game. Champions kills restore 7.5% of your missing health, mana and energy. Assist restore 5% instead.
