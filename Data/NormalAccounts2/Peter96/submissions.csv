It seems like our changes will not be changed any further on PBE. So these changes are the conclusion of the mini-rework that's being pushed to live next week. Here are the changes (changes are the comparision between current PBE and live):

**General:**

* Aura range increased to 400 from 350.

* Aura duration increased to 3 seconds from 1.5 seconds.

* Aura AP ratio increased to 6% per 100AP from 4% per 100AP

* If Sona loses her self movement speed, she will still get the aura movement speed regardless if she gets damaged in the first 3 seconds after Song of Celerity activation.

**Crescendo (R):**

* Now reduces Sona's basic abilities (Q/W/E) cooldown by 20/30/40% (this interacts will cooldown reduction of items, runes, and masteries.

What changed from last PBE update?

* E lost it's auto attack range increase, but instead grants more movement speed when you hit enemy champions, units, monsters or epic monsters (and wards) with a basic attack (affects allies)(does not decay).

That's pretty much it from the last changes, Everything seems exactly as it was.

EDIT: Some tests by me. This seems to have alot of potential for gap closes in lane and teamfights. Looks good so far.

EDIT 2: New changes, W buffs and a QoL buff!

https://twitter.com/ricklessabandon/status/747875574543114240

* I'm guessing her heal and shield has 0.3 AP Ratio now (from 0.2)
* Diminuendo Power Chord is 25% less damage (from 20%)
* AP Ratio increased to 6% per 100 AP from 2% per 100 AP 
* Passive decreases the size of the enemy champion when hit by it.

Holy moly. This is huge to reduce the damage output of your enemies. I love this!

EDIT 3: More buffs? Thanks Riot! Here's the list of the full live -&gt; PBE changes

https://twitter.com/ricklessabandon/status/747937411477299201/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw

The differences from yesterday to (probably) today are:

So Sona recieved new changes, more healing, extra range for harass, but a little loss of movement speed.

What also changed was the Ancient Coin, Nomad's Medallion, Talisman of the Ascension, Ardent Censer, Mikael's Crucible, Ruby Sightstone and more!

So let's see. Sona will lose movement speed, and she needs a few back, but in a different way.

Ancient Coin, Nomad's Medallion and Talisman of the Ascension, all this line up will get a great, huge buff, regardless if it won't have AP. 

So here's the deal:

* Ancient Coin will have extra 5% cooldown reduction. It will surely help Sona spam more spells + has a good passive for health and gold regeneration.

* Nomad's Medallion will lose 25% health regeneration, but will recieve an extra 25% mana regeneration (75%) and 10% cooldown reduction. The passive once again helps her sustain + has a few hundreds of gold generation.

* Talisman of the Ascension will get a huge buff for protection. It will recieve 45 armor, 50% more health regeneration (150%), a passive that buffs movement speed close to turrets and fallen turrets, but will lose only 25% mana regenration.

I see this item as a new potentional item for Sona if you want a passive, but agressive lane (because you are Sona xd)

* Ruby Sightstone will probably be a must buy because of the gold decrease and the 10% more reduced active cooldown (20%).

* Boots of Mobility because it doesn't deactive when you clear wards and it's more worthy than Swiftness now (this is kind of a personal item. I like these more than Swiftness now)

* Athene's Unholy Grail, AP, MR, mana regen, 20% cooldown reduction and the great extra heal and shield passive

* Ardent Censer for offensive stats, extra heal and shield and buffed allies, or Mikael's Cruclble for protection of your allies, same extra heal and shield and a little protection.

* Finish with Seraph's Embrace for that tons of mana (don't forget your ult turns you into URF mode so it's worth for that mana and AP)

**TL;DR in the beggining.**

Tell me your opinions. Obviously you can change Talisman if you don't like it for the Eye of the Watchers and get another AP item in replacement of Ruby Sightstone.",sonamains,Potentional new build for Sona (if PBE changes go through),https://www.reddit.com/r/sonamains/comments/4om6gd/potentional_new_build_for_sona_if_pbe_changes_go/

So let's see:

* Bigger aura
* Less damage on Hymm of Valor Active
* More damage on Hymm of Valor Melody
* Bigger cooldown (compensated with R levels)
* Less heal on Aria of Preserverance Active (WTF??)
* Removed % missing health (WTF??)
* Bigger shield on Aria of Preserverance Melody
* Lower mana cost on Song of Celerity
* More self movement speed
* More ally movement speed
* Crescendo decreases your basic cooldowns by (20%/40%/60%)

OK OK! HEAR ME OUT! ""Basic abilities"" means it doesn't affect your cooldown on items. So that means that YOU HAVE ALMOST 90% COOLDOWN REDUCTION ON SONA AT LEVEL 16!

Ok that's the only thing I tested. Will post more stuff with my other testing.

EDIT: More testing for myself. Her early game power (poke, stay safe and heal) is weaker, but you'll get a URF-y feel past level 11 IF you at least have mana to spam (Tear of the Goddess/Seraph's Embrace seems to be the best pick to her now, or even her 2nd offense item)  and at least 30%+ cooldown reduction. She is crazy overpowered if she has these components (30% cooldown reduction, level 11+ and tons of mana). 

I don't think Riot wants Sona to skyrocket her win rate in the late game, although she has some game winning ultimates in live servers.

EDIT 2: Part 2 of the changes here:

https://twitter.com/ricklessabandon/status/743170479867867136

Somewhat reasonable cooldown nerf if Riot wants to keep her URF status after level 11, but Crescendo is now 20\30\40 instead of 20\40\60. Kind of a big nerf personally, but we'll see with a few tests.

EDIT 3: New stuff with an interesting(?) new active for E:

For the next 3 seconds, Sona gains 25/50/75/100/125 attack range for her next attack. She keeps her aura fot her allies tho with 200% more time (from 1.5 seconds to 3 seconds)

Her heal was increased to 40/65/90/115/140 and her shield to 30/55/80/105/130.

Changes here: 

https://twitter.com/ricklessabandon/status/743891728294256641

Instant thoughts:

E range increase will make her more of an easy time to harass (E-Q combo). ~~Too bad for her movement speed loss. I just hope that the aura also affects herself too, and not only allies.~~

I now know that her heal will be balanced out with the new extra heal and shield items + athenes + WB.

Edit 4: The aura movement speed will affect her. So she will be getting 2 ""actives"".

* A focused patch on the support position, looking at things like support XP, tweaks to a few items that aren’t hitting the mark (e.g. Ruby Sightstone or Forbidden Idol), small buffs to some champs that often go support, etc.

* This is not a large class update like the one we recently did for mages, but instead a collection of small changes we can get out quickly.

These were the last Sona changes that were changed in the PBE:

Auras

* Aura size :: 350 &gt;&gt;&gt; 300

(Q) Hymn of Valor

* Cooldown :: 8 &gt;&gt;&gt; 10/9/8/7/6

(E) Song of Celerity

* Self decaying MS :: 13/14/15/16/17% (+7.5%/100 AP) &gt;&gt;&gt; 30/32/34/36/38% (+8%/100 AP)

* Allied MS boost :: 10/11/12/13/14% (+3.5%/100 AP) &gt;&gt;&gt; 12/13/14/15/16% (+5%/100 AP)

(R) Crescendo

* Points no longer increase Sona's Self MS boost on E

Remember, it will be likely to see Sona changes. If it does, let's make the change better than it was before her last rework. Let's make Sona better!

Personally, the Ethereal influences me a hole lot on the laning phase. It makes me concentrate on focusing the key aspects like map awareness, map control to help other lanes with pings, and the laning phase obviously.

Hello my fellow mainers!

Today I bring you a quick topic about Athenes and Sona's Aria of Perseverance.

Athene's recieved a rework that made it a fully support item, perfect for single healers such as Sona, Nami, Soraka, etc. This item has a new passive that charges it's ""blood"" from 100 to 250 value. That value is used when the Athene's holder heals someone.

If you compare the max value and Sona's heal (and from my experience), she heals alot. Let's not forget, despite her heal being a bit bad, her heal 30 / 50 / 70 / 90 / 110 (+ 20% AP) is **increased by 0.5% for every 1% of target's missing health.** This is what makes her heal valued against other healing supports when your ally is at low health. 

If we include Athene's Grail, her heal is **massively** increased by the flat. If we see her heal, it will now increase (at max value and Aria of Preseverance) 110 + 250 = 360.

360 is what her heal is when maxed out with Athene's Grail (without AP). Now including the **increased by 0.5% for every 1% of target's missing health** . Let's take to account to a target who is missing 25%, 50% and 75% of his maximum health.

**25%:** 360 + (0.5% x 25%) = 360 + 12,5% = 405 value of the heal.

**50%:** 360 + (0.5% x 50%) = 360 + 25% = 450 value of the heal.

**75%:** 360 + (0.5 x 75%) = 360 + 37,5% = 495 value of her heal.

For a low cooldown that her heal has + amount of harass she is recieving and movement speed disengage/engage, Athene's helps her heal alot.

Plus, let's not forget that she also gets 20% cooldown reduction, AP, more mana regen (after 25% mana regen nerf from FQC) and another mana regen/health regen passive. Basically this item gives her too much stats for what she offers (isn't that what we want *winky face*), and for 2250 gold only, it's beautiful.

For this reason is, that Riot is afraid to overbuff her Aria of Perseverance. It can make her a better heal bot than Soraka.",sonamains,New Athenes on Sona + what is keeping her to get buffed on her Aria of Perseverance,https://www.reddit.com/r/sonamains/comments/4ikahv/new_athenes_on_sona_what_is_keeping_her_to_get/

+500 Health

+50 Armor

2800 Gold

Unique passive - DREADNOUGHT: Generates Momentum stacks while moving, up to 100, granting up to +60 bonus movement speed. Momentum slowly decays while slowed and decays rapidly while immobilized or silenced.

Unique passive - CRUSHING BLOW: Basic attacks (on-hit) discharge all Momentum, dealing +1 on-hit physical damage for every 2 Momentum discharged. If 100 stacks are discharged, damage is doubled to +100 and slows its target by 75%, decaying over 1 second.

___


Sunfire Cape

+500 Health

+50 Armor (+5 armor in Season 6)

2700 Gold

Unique passive – IMMOLATE: Deals 26 - 43 (based on level) magic damage per second to nearby enemies (400 range).

___

Currently the small buff to Sunfire Cape makes this item a worm welcome to pretty much everyone who needs a tank and needs split pushing and/or 1v1 close combat. Sunfire cape will be super cost efficient, along with the ""small"" sunfire cape, that is Bami's Cinder. Even though it does less damage around you, it's more cost efficient and it helps you combat or split push early game against DMP.

___

Now for Dead Man's Plate. This item recieved alot of nerfs after his debut in Black Market Brawlers. It recieved a -100HP nerf, -5 armor nerf and a +50 gold nerf. Both have the same stats, aside from the passives. DMP's passive helps closing combat and does a few extra damage, and a small slow is helpful. But in split pushing, 1v1 close combat, and even close team fight, Sunfire Cape RISES and it's hugely better than the Dead Man's Plate.

___

TL;DR - In Season 6 (next patch), Sunfure Cape is a better item to get on your 1st/2nd buy. Dead Man's Plate can be situational now. Not to mention the 100 gold difference between both, the combine cost for Sunfire Cape helps who needs to buy it with less than 1000 gold.",summonerschool,Dead Man's Plate vs Sunfire Cape in Season 6,https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/3xa1q7/dead_mans_plate_vs_sunfire_cape_in_season_6/

Here is the link: http://mapskins.com/2015/08/14/bilgewater-announcer/

How to install it:

* Download Wooxy from mapskins

* Install it

* After you install it, localize your league of legends folder

* Now close it and open with administrator

* Click on Skins, Import skin at the bottom right and click on Add a package

* Choose the Bilgewater announcer

* Now Click on ""Announces BilgeWater"" and install it
