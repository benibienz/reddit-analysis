102,"Holy shit Mitch didn't learn a single thing from last week.

Manoa out of his primary position (I guess we should be grateful he's starting).

Ausburger still at 9 even though he clearly didn't know what he would doing and just spammed the box kick button

Hughes still at fullback even though it was obvious he hasn't played there in years. He's the best ball distributor we have but we're sticking him in the back three.

Clever not even on the bench even though this is our toughest opponent and seemed to be the only one not panicking last week.

Cam playing second row I'm pretty sure the first time this year.

And Will Holder still starting at 10 even though he was hands down our weakest link against both the MAB and Oaks.

We're not going to succeed if our coach's ""pull names out of a hat"" approach to position assignments keeps our players from playing to their full potential.

That. Doesn't. Matter. Again, you're saying irrelevant things. Why do some people magically deserve to have their vote count less just because it's at a federal level? If a system isn't fair at one level than it's not fair on any level. Everyone is affected by Federal law equally, so everyone deserves an equal vote in deciding who shapes it. I don't know why I keep repeating that, since your brain is apparently incapable of reading that sentence.

&gt;Dude, its also electing people by popular vote.

Did you go to a school up your own ass? That's literally the entire reason for the two terms *direct* and *representative* democracy.

&gt;That is literally what you're talking about.

No, *again,* for the billionth time, direct democracy is making decisions by popular vote. When a referendum is held on marijuana legislation, that's direct democracy. When the UK's populace voted to leave the EU, that was direct democracy. Collecting everyone's votes to decide who makes decisions (like every other fucking developed country does) is still *representative* democracy.

&gt;No, I'm not. I'm fully aware of the benefits of a direct democracy its just shit for deciding the president.

If it still chose the candidate that didn't receive the most votes, yes I absolutely would, because *that's the actual problem I'm talking about you unbelievably thick moron.*

&gt;How is it fundamentally undemocratic?

By making it so that some people's vote carry more weight than others based on where they live, even though where they live doesn't matter to Federal law. Are we going around the circle once again?

&gt;Direct democracy is awful

1. Fucking *what?*

2. We're *still not talking about direct democracy.* We're talking about *representative democracy* which the electoral college fails at.

206,"&gt; Because its the biggest flaw. You may actually like the electoral college if everyone voted.

You *just* said that it's a flaw in both systems so why are you using it as a defence of one system? If everyone voted, a single popular vote would still be better *because it determines who most people want as president.*

&gt;So you don't know much about the history of it?

That *is* the history of it. The original founders of the country intended the states to have a lot more power than they do today and the *people* didn't vote for the president at all, the state governments did. Besides the fact that its history *doesn't fucking matter.* Does it make sense in the year 2016? No. That's all that matters.

&gt;I all for amending the electoral college as needed.

There's no ""amending"" an institution that is *by design* fundamentally undemocratic. It serves no function anymore and there's no reason to keep it other than wanting to keep things the same for its own sake.

&gt;Because I'm really not sure you understand the difference here or why it matters for our country.

....that's not an answer to the question. Let's try reading again: *What definitions of ""democracy"" and ""republic"" makes the ""we're a republic not a democracy"" excuse make any kind of sense?* This hopeless excuse to pedantics isn't based on anything and doesn't prove any kind of point about what you're trying to argue. It's pointless because I don't care what the system *is.* What it *is* is the entire problem, the issue is what it *should* be.",2016-11-12 05:00:06+00:00,d9wuulm,24.0,t1_d9wufv8,800.0,reactiongifs
207,"&gt; It does apply to the electoral college as well. Thats been the main issue with direct democracy or the electoral college.

So why the fuck do you keep bringing it up?

&gt;This could easily be debated. The electoral college wasn't thrown to together in a night. There is quite a bit of thought to it from many smart people.

It was thrown together by 18th century aristocrats who thought that only land-owning white men should vote and the country should be a loose alliance of mostly independent states. That has fuck all to do with whether the Electoral College makes any sense *now.* Saying ""well this is how it's always been so it must make sense"" is not ""debating.""

&gt;No, that is literally not what that means.

Go back to high school history class.

[""In modern times, the definition of a republic is commonly referred to a government which excludes a monarch""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic)

What definitions of ""democracy"" and ""republic"" makes the ""we're a republic not a democracy"" excuse make any kind of sense.",2016-11-12 04:43:47+00:00,d9wucij,22.0,t1_d9wu55p,391.0,reactiongifs
208,"&gt;And you know about congress right?

Yes, the senate is also undemocratic. The EC, however, is easier to get rid of.

&gt;Umm, well you're not getting the input of almost half the nation so I thought that might be important to your whole democracy and representing all the people.

*How the holy fuck does that not apply to the Electoral College?* If missing half the people delegitimizes the country's choice of leader, how does it not delegitimize a state's choice of leader? People who don't vote excuse themselves from the democratic process, you can only work with the votes you have. If a candidate *has more votes,* then they are the democratic choice of leader. This is literally a concept that every child understands. You're being completely two-faced.

&gt;It really seems like you don't know what it means.

A democracy means that the citizens of a country excercise control over the government, either through direct democracy, where citizens vote on legislation, like we see in referendums, or through representative democracy, where citizens vote to designate an individual to make decision. The word ""republic"" literally only means that the country doesn't have a monarchy. That's why almost every country has ""republic"" in its name, whether it's a country like Finland or China.

So, if you can think about this for a single millisecond, you'll see these two things are not mutually exclusive and it's really easy for a country to be both or neither. So using the phrase ""we're a republic, not a democracy"" to justify undemocratic bullshit is stupid. I hope we've learned something.",2016-11-12 04:31:05+00:00,d9wty7s,20.0,t1_d9wtk4u,731.0,reactiongifs
209,"&gt;This is when it is most meaningful. You're reversing the rolls and purposes of our government. Its more direct democracy at the local and state level and a Republic at the federal level.

Still doesn't know what direct democracy means, still thinks that states are more important than people.

People vote in state-level elections on things that only affect people *in that state.* It literally doesn't matter what state you live in, Federal law applies to all American citizens equally, so all American citizens should have an *equal* voice in deciding who runs it. This is literally the entire concept of representative democracy.

&gt;This is part of the same issue! Almost half the country doesn't vote and average on not presidential elections is 30-40%. Low turnout has everything to do with this. Why would you ignore such an issue?

Because it has fuck all to do with the point you're trying to make. Why would low voter turnout delegitimize a national vote but magically *not* delegitimize the EC? 

&gt;We aren't in a democratic system. We are a republic.

The right-wing idiots who chant this as if the two are mutually exclusive just prove they have absolutely no idea what either of those words mean.",2016-11-12 04:15:10+00:00,d9wtfnl,18.0,t1_d9wt707,436.0,reactiongifs

465,"I wouldn't really need to change any of the rules, I would just try to eliminate the culture this sport has that's weirdly okay with refs straight up ignoring certain rules and making up new ones in the name of shaping the game into a style they like and is easier for them. It's ironic that you list cloning Owens as a solution since he's one of the worst at this.

Rugby reffing is usually a shitshow because every game pretty much has different rules. Hold refs accountable for making up their own ""interpretations"" of the laws and a lot of the toxic complaints after every single game would drop off.

But more specifically:

At least two on-field refs. Scrums alone necessitate this. Every scrum the ref basically has to decide which side is going to get to cheat.

Captains get two TMO challenges per half. I don't buy the complaint about the pace of the game. This game stops all the time anyway. A call is only slow until it's made. When it's wrong, it's wrong forever, and the whole game's legitimacy is shot.

When a decision goes to the TMO, actually *let* it go to the TMO. Don't still leave it up to the ref and play it on the big screen where the crowd can influence the decision.

657,"Denying your opponent a bonus point isn't remotely as big as a motivator as earning a bonus point of your own, especially since most of the time that won't matter. The current system encourages the losing team to keep playing attacking positive rugby even if it *is* a washout. Losing within 7 points isn't the only way to have a ""good"" loss, and that bonus point is a little bit redundant in a system where score differential is a tie breaker anyway.

Look at the Germany/Portugal game from last year. It was a blowout, but Portugal was still able to walk away with a bonus point because they kept playing offensively to the final whistle and got four tries. It ended up not mattering, but it kept their hopes alive for another week, so the final game wasn't meaningless. Look at a high-scoring but close game, like the South Africa/Japan game.  I would definitely say South Africa deserves *two* bonus points for that. We should encourage more 34-32 games instead of 12-9 games.",2016-10-01 17:18:20+00:00,d89qxr0,,t1_d89qg9d,750.0,rugbyunion

Yes, and the summer tours are cancelled only once every four years. And even if it interrupts SR, the SH countries are still the ones that benefit from the tours, so saying that cancelling the tours to help SR is what the SH gets out of this is completely asinine.

&gt;NH sides arent so keen on that because that means they have to agree new off-season and pre-season windows

Which has absolutely nothing to do with moving the SR season. It's not a compromise if they have the exact same size season and the exact same home internationals. You still need to learn what the word ""compromise"" means.

745,"&gt;Facing repercussions because of your beliefs from a private citizen does not mean you don't have the right to your beliefs.

So having beliefs is fine, you should just be content to never act on them--in a way that does not negatively affect anyone else--if your employer doesn't agree with them

&gt;Someone - one individual - would have to sign off on Kapernick's termination. It makes no difference how big a company that person works for. Private citizens have the right to react, as individuals, to the speech of other private citizens.

One, they're *not* acting as private citizens. They're acting on behalf of a huge company that is the only source of employment in this industry. An employee speaking out on personal beliefs and an employer firing said employee are *not* on the same standing because one actively harms another party and the other doesn't.

&gt; I choose my friends based on their words, among other things. Do you realize just how fucked up our society would be if no one could react in any negative way at all to anyone's speech. Person gives a sales pitch - you have to buy his product, because reacting negatively to it would be reacting badly to his speech and therefore oppressing him. Middle of a board meeting in a big company, you stand up and scream ""I hate black people!"" Then film everyone's reactions. Anyone who scowls gets hit with a lawsuit. Just how far are you willing to take this? Debate team? Not any more. Arguing with someone is a negative repercussion to their speech, so no-can-do. How fucking ridiculous would life be if any negative repercussion at all from anyone was considered ""oppression"". Give me a break

...I simply cannot believe that you are actually this dense. It is simply not possible for someone to equate a monopolistic corporation censoring its employees with a guy picking his buddies, on any kind of ethical, logical, or legal level. Forcing someone to buy a product is not free speech, genius, that literally has nothing to do with anything. Scowling at someone saying something you don't like doesn't harm the other person, *that* is actually on equal standing. A salesman saying something racist can be fired, not because of what he believes, but because he's not doing his job well, because making people like the company is literally in his job description. It's like you think throwing out increasingly ridiculous and irrelevant senarios instead of actually addressing reality somehow proves a point. Of course there are consequences to the things you say, things like how people around you feel about you, that's not a green light to companies to treat their employees like shit for things they believe in. Gee, it's almost as if the complex ethical and legal relationship between corporations and labor and a guy choosing his buddies are--gasp--*two different things.*

&gt;When did I say he did? When did I say he should be fired? I don't think he should be penalized. I just think people should be allowed to say that he should.

And other people can point out that the NFL both shouldn't and can't do that without facing legal consequences

&gt;That's a circular argument - workers should be protected because we have laws that protect them.

No, it's the other way around. Those laws exist to protect inherent rights that people already have. You started this by saying that freedom of speech doesn't apply because it legally only applies to the government, and I'm pointing out how you don't even have that leg to stand on, and are pulling all of this completely out of your ass to justify a weird warped lack of empathy.

&gt;Utterly irrelevant

Yes, the pages and pages of laws that the NFL has to abide by in order to be allowed to exist as a monopoly is utterly irrelevant.

&gt;I wouldn't like it, but it should be completely within their rights. And if we lived in a time and place where that was a possibility, I simply wouldn't sign a contract with an employer which didn't include a clause preventing them from firing me for my speech unless it were illegal or harmed the company.

Again, it's the other way around. Unless it's explicitly part of someone's contract that they have to fall in line and parrot back all the employer's beliefs, it is *not* within their rights and they'll likely have a lawsuit on their hands. That would be like firing a salesman because he didn't unclog a toilet. And even then, they probably couldn't get away with it, doing something illegal doesn't suddenly become okay because it's in a contract. Again, try to fire a religious employee for praying before lunch because you're an atheist and don't agree with it, I'm sure that it will be ruled to be completely in your rights.

&gt;No, that's not the same as your ""protection"", because if the company doesn't like it, they can hire some other guy who doesn't care if he gets fired for speaking his mind. Nothing wrong with that - it's voluntary on both sides. There is something wrong with imposing that law on everyone from the top down.

So only people in a financial position to have the luxury of negotiating a generous contract with their employer get to speak their beliefs without fear of suddenly being left with nothing as their boss moves onto someone else who they *can* bully into shutting up and adopting someone else's beliefs. Freedom of speech is now something that's bought.

*Fuck off.* I'm done.

When people say that the NFL should fire him because of what they did, it's completely relevant to point out that firing him would be going against free speech.

The 1st Amendment does not grant the right to free speech. The right to free speech is something a person is born with and the 1st Amendment legally protects it. Everyone who tries to use this ""it's not government so it doesn't count"" technicality is only trying to navigate what you can get away with *in spite* of the law instead of caring about the reason why the law exists.

&gt;Think about the innumerable ways in which an employee can get himself fired from a company for saying something that would be grossly unconstitutional to be arrested for. Should they be protected, as long as they aren't inciting violence?

Yes.

&gt;If I work the reception desk at a hotel and tell everyone who comes in, ""Wow, guess what, you're getting the room that a lady got raped and murdered in!"" should my employer not be allowed to fire me?

The closest relevant thing to that analogy is if a player came out and said a team had covered up something shady, when yeah people would definitely say they shouldn't be fired. 

Besides the fact that's not remotely like what he did. He sat down during a fucking song. That doesn't harm his fellow employees, it doesn't harm his employers, it doesn't harm the fans, it doesn't harm the staff, it doesn't harm literally anyone. The 1st Amendment absolutely legally applies to companies, that's just a fact. People successfully sue for wrongful termination all the goddam time because of it. It would probably appeal to some team's fanbases if they fire any outspoken atheists, with your logic they should be allowed to, because they're a private company. But they can't, because it's protected by the 1st Amendment, and they'll sue.

Yes, the 1st Amendment exists to make sure a person isn't oppressed because of what they believe in, and it's laughably naive to think the only way to oppress someone is to throw them in prison.",2016-09-13 01:05:28+00:00,d7kd9x5,7.0,t1_d7kch7x,1127.0,baseball

818,"&gt;While the spring flood level flows are greatly reduced, the summer and fall flows below Hoover are virtually the same as before the dam was built.

So it *has* been greatly reduced, you can't just say the spring flows don't count when they account for most of the overall flow. Your own source clearly shows the decrease in overall flow after the dam was built. It was the spring flows that renewed the river ecosystem and provided for the communities downriver that have since vanished.

&gt;A large portion of the river has been captured for irrigation since long before Hoover Dam

.....yes, that's exactly what I said. The river had long been used as irrigation, but still managed to remain relatively healthy (provided they didn't try to grow crops that have no business growing in the desert, like California has been doing), and only rarely failed to reach the sea. The River has been shrinking on average since the construction of the dam.

&gt;And Hoover's primary purpose is hydroelectricity, which requires the release of a lot of water.

*All* dams greatly choke the flow of water, that's the entire point. If it didn't, Lake Mead wouldn't exist, and be steadily dropping every year due to evaporation, because a freshwater lake doesn't belong in the middle of the Nevada desert. And it's not just the water, the energy *in* the water is a vital factor of a river ecosystem and is what carried it to the ocean without drying up.",2016-08-24 19:37:59+00:00,d6v2l1d,5.0,t1_d6v1zlt,698.0,MapPorn

825,"&gt; They obviously believe that the quality difference of teams in the old 2A and 2B, now Conference 1, is of a similar enough level. 

But that's simply not true. The dfference between the two levels is painfully obvious, the worst team in 2A always easily beats all the teams n 2B whenever they get demoted. And there's going to be even less now that teams of different levels are thrown together based on geography.

&gt;In the old 2C and 2D, the nations couldn't afford the travel costs and so sometimes a tournament was played in one location over a very short timeframe to save on costs for very cash strapped Unions

I don't know where you're getting that, that's literally never happened for as long as the 2C and 2D have existed. The only level that was held in one place was Division 3, all levels of Divison 2 were held on a home-and away basis. 

&gt;If you looked at the history of the old divisions, you'd see that a huge amount of the 2C and D games were constantly defered, or not even played in the same season, as they are just that underfunded

That happened once in the 2D last year. And it wasn't because they were underfunded, it's because those games were hosted by Norway and Finland, whose playing seasons are extremely short and don't fit into when RE likes scheduling matches.

&gt; Another reason is countries geographically located closer together usually have closer cultural ties, shared histories, and sporting rivalries, particularly in Europe. This will further add to the competitiveness of matches.

One, trying to force rivalries through geographical proximity doesn't work when one of them gets promoted/relegated out of the division anyway. You can have a fixed system with neighbors playing each other in conferences, or you can have a multi-tiered league system with pro/rel, you can't have it both ways. Second, that idea is kind of disproven just by looking at the map. You really think Sweden has a rich historc rivalry with Luxembourg? Or Israel wth Croatia? They're not actually increasing the marketability of matches simply by estimating which half of the continent they're on. Third, unexciting blowouts don't suddenly become exciting because the teams have a rivalry in other sports. USA/Mexico is one of the fiercest rivalries in soccer, that doesn't mean I'm going to buy a ticket to watch the Eagles blow out the #11 team in the Americas. There's not really any local rivalries in the same division, that wouldn't have been under the old system.",2016-08-22 17:14:42+00:00,d6s2ou3,3.0,t1_d6rwoqa,8025.0,rugbyunion

835,"&gt;I'm not telling you, you told me. You said it's ""pace"", not length.

And for some reason you're acting like the two are removed from each other. Without extra innings, a faster pace means a shorter game and vice versa. The problem is that *everything takes too long,* you can't pedantically split hairs about that.

&gt; Begging the question again. Better pace =/= shorter. You're defining better as shorter.

No, I'm defining better as *what I paid for.* I'm defining better as watching the game *being played.* You just keep saying the same things no matter how many times they're corrected or clarified.

&gt;Again, begging the question. Baseball does make new fans. Interest in the sport consistently grows. ""Baseball is dying"" is a myth.

It's really hilarious that you keep dismissing any kind of statement about why people like things (which are patently obvious to anyone who has talked with a human being), but wave away established facts with ""nyuh-uh"" without actually presenting anything of your own.

&gt;They're not the real reason. They are rationalized reasons that people give when they get it. Of course people who don't like it are going to say it's too long.

&gt;You have to understand them more than listen to them. Focus groups have been proven to be unreliable because people are terrible at communicating why they don't like things.

Oh, I get it now. The reason you just repeat ""begging the question"" at any conclusion drawn is because you assume that *no* conclusion can be drawn, because you're so much of a condescending dick that you think people are so stupid that they don't even know why they don't like something. So no one can ever say why someone can't get into baseball, even when they tell you *directly to your fucking face* why they can't get into baseball.

So trying to argue with you is pointless, because nothing will ever shake you from your core belief that you're right and everyone else just doesn't understand.

836,"Now you're being condescending enough to tell me what I actually care about. Making a baseball game have a better pace *will* naturally make a game shorter, genius. Unless you add on innings at the end. *I* don't think that baseball is boring because I have an already-existing appreciation for baseball that gets me through sluggish games. But I dont think just guys like me matter because I dont have my head up my ass. These are the real reasons people give in all my years of trying to show people baseball, and actually *listening* to why people can't get into baseball, the people who you smugly wave away as not mattering, as if a sport can survive without ever making new fans.

&gt;And the fact that football longer. Being too long is clearly not an issue unless you can prove otherwise.

&gt;And when coupled with the hard evidence of how football has also gotten longer and longer but still gotten more popular pretty dispositively proves that's not the issue.

Okay, for the *billionth time,* the fact that football games last a long time doesn't mean jack shit. The fact that a football team only has one game a week means that the length of game isn't a hinderence to someone following every game of a team. If a football team played a game every day the length *would* be a problem.

&gt;And where's your evidence that baseball popularity is declining? Regional ratings just keep on rising.

Yeah, because baseball's main fanbase has all retired and can more easily watch 3.5 hour games everyday. Baseball has the oldest fanbase of any major sport. Half of MLB viewers are [over the age of 55]( http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/02/which-sports-have-the-whitest-richest-oldest-fans/283626/). Baseball's fanbase is *literally* dying.

&gt;You're begging the question. You're presupposing how those people act, when there's no reason to believe that's how they would consume baseball.

The problem is these people *aren't* consuming baseball. You claimed that people who at first get into baseball but get turned off by how long they drag on are a small niche. There's no reason to believe that's true. The emperical evidence shows that *something* is wrong with baseball that's hurting it, and most people's anecdotal evidence say that how long games drag on with little action is a reason for that.

&gt;Did you hit your head? That's what you said. I said literally nothing about how fans are formed. I'm just pointing out whenever you're clearly making shit up about how fans behave.

You said that it's fine for someone to watch the first two hours of a game, get bored, and turn it off, and that there's no reason to assume they wouldn't do it again the next day. That assumes that someone can become a fan by watching the first half of a game everyday, which is ludicrous. *I* am saying that it's a good idea to make the pace of a game so that people can watch the whole thing *before* getting bored.

&gt;Lol, no you're not. You are explicitly trying to make it faster and more efficient and pack ""more baseball"" in less time.

For the last time, we're not talking about ""more"" or ""less"" baseball, it's the exact same amount of baseball. Just presented in a timeframe it originally was before it got this bad. Your shitty metaphor still assumes that all the stuff people want to speed up are an important part of a game like a song on an album. You just completely ignored why that metaphor doesn't make sense.

&gt;Ok, here we are begging the question again. It's kind of appalling you'd dream of making that statement without supporting it.

How the fuck is that begging the question? Do you actually know what that means? Are you saying a product diluted by time wasting *isn't* necessarily a bad product? That's not a statement that needs to be ""supported,"" it's just pointing out that a product that you can only get by waiting through a bunch of other shit you don't care about is a bad product.

838,"&gt;  lots of reasons to believe it's false.

like what? The only thing you've cited is your own gut feelings. Have you ever actually tried to get someone new to get interested in baseball? Not to mention the hard evidence of how games have taken longer and longer over the decades and how that correlates with baseball's decline in popularity in key demographics.

&gt;They'll get bored if they don't get it or if it's not a great game, but if they like it or it's a long exciting game, they'll be into it for 5+ hours. Length is just not a reason that people get bored. That's a myth.

You're basing that on nothing. Too much of any good thing is a bad thing. Again, this isn't changing the amount of baseball being played, it's giving people what they want more efficiently. There's a difference between a game lasting 5 hours because it went for 15 exciting innings and a 9 inning game that lasted 5 hours at a snail's pace.

&gt;Uh... that has absolutely nothing to do with length of games.

It's why the NFL can get away with 3.5 hour games but baseball can't. Whenever someone brings up the idea of trying to trim the fat out of games, people bring up how NFL games are just as long, but the frequency of games makes the comparison meaningless, so that excuse doesn't work.

&gt;You're describing an exceptionally small niche of people. The experience of a football pretty definitively shows that a long game with massive amounts of hurrying up and waiting and tons of padding is the preferred style of sports watching in North America.

The popularity demographics definitively shows that it's *not* a small niche of people, it's the direction all demographics not collecting social security are going. Again, if you asked someone if they wanted to watch a 3 hour NFL game *every day*, they won't. Pointing to NFL about game times doesn't make sense.

&gt;First, hand-waving dismissal of unsubstantiated arguments is the logical response. Second, I've presented several persuasive reasons why you should doubt that shorter games would increase viewership.

Saying that you ""believe it"" isn't a persuasive reason. All your reasons are based on assumptions like thinking that fans are formed by watching the first half of a game before becoming bored, or that the same 9 inning game of baseball is somehow ""less"" baseball without all the time wasting nonsense.

&gt;Do you understand why it's not more appealing to take your favourite album and play it at 1.5x speed?

This is the dumbest metaphor I've seen in a while. What I'm talking about isn't playing an album at faster speed, it's playiing an album without 60 seconds of silence between each song. You're still acting like watching a batter adjust their gloves and helmet between each pitch or a coach argue with an ump for 10 minutes is a necessary part of a baseball game. It's not.

&gt;All you're saying is that bad products are bad. You're saying nothing about shorter products being better.

A product diluted by hours of pointless time wasting *is* a bad product. How are you still thinking that people want quicker games just for its own sake? It's to undo how bloated its become and actually make some baseball fans by showing people *baseball.*

&gt; If anything, the increased popularity of TV-bingeing indicates the opposite. People like long stories. They want 240 episodes of Friends. They want to watch 13 hours of House of Cards in a weekend. They don't want their stories to be distilled: they want them to be richer.

Pointless bullshit just meant to eat up airtime doesn't make anything ""richer."" Friends was in the 90s dude, that format of show is less popular every year. Now people want shows with 10 episodes a season, like Game of Thrones. People can marathon 13 episodes of House of Cards *because* it's written efficiently and doesn't pad anything out to fill up airtime, it maintains pace. Again, it's the equivalent of a game lasting several hours because a lot *happens* in it.",2016-08-20 19:24:34+00:00,d6pp7d8,19.0,t1_d6pn6mh,3240.0,baseball
839,"&gt; And I strongly believe this is false.

Based on what? Try to introduce someone new to baseball, they'll get into it at first, but probably get extremey bored after the 3 hour mark. And if you suggest to watch another game the next day, they're not going to feel like it, unlike in football where they had a week between games, plus the fact that each game means a lot less, so you're less motivated to care.

&gt;This is probably wrong. People who watch baseball don't turn it off because they're bored.

*Again,* this isn't about people who *already* habitually watch baseball, why does baseball need to get fans that it already has?

&gt;They're not going to not watch the next game because they couldn't finish the first.

How does that make any sense? If they know that just yesterday that they tried to watch a whole game and couldn't make it through, why would they bother try again? What would be different?

&gt;The people you're describing don't like baseball

No, they don't like all the hurrying up and waiting between the actual baseball. Again, you're not giving them *less* baseball. It's the same amount of baseball with less padding.

Literally nothing you're saying is based on logic, just smug hand-waving dismissal of anyone who's not already a devoted baseball fan. I don't understand why you can't get the concept of getting the same product more efficiently makes it more appealing.

1021,"&gt;(unless you somehow divided the screen and showed multiple events at once, which is just silly).

Why would that be silly? And you missed the point, they could show almost all the routines if they showed non-live routines instead of five minutes of gymnasts waiting for a delayed score.

&gt;They only show full routines, which means they don't cut to a gymnast half-way through their apparatus, even if they have nothing else to show.

This statement makes no sense. If they had nothing else to show, why *would* they could half-way through? If there's nothing to show, show the routines that we're missing. That doesn't at all require cutting in during the middle. You and the producers seem to think that if we can't watch a routine the literal second it happens, then we don't want to see it and would rather watch gymnasts drink water.

&gt;I don't know if it's the same in Rio, but in London they had a Japanese company doing the actual filming of the events.

I guess that explained why Kato got so much coverage despite doing average.

&gt;the camera operators/producers are told to watch the most exciting athletes

Literally no athlete is exciting while eating a protein bar. Lionel Messi is an exciting soccer player, that doesn't mean I want a 90 minute close up of him while the ball is on the other side of the field.

&gt;Every time they rotated to a new event, they didn't waste time watching them warm up for three minutes

Are you sure it's the same feed? They would occassionally show a previous routine, but not remotely as much as they could have. They left plenty of room for Uchimura pacing back and forth.

Edit: in fact Im watching the womens individual and theres literally been 3 minutes between rotations where they didnt show anything 

&gt;The commentary for BBC has been excellent

Good gymnastics commentators don'tmean anything if they're not given any gymnastics to commentate.

&gt;crowd reactions, team interactions, triumph/defeat/nervous anticipation

All not necessary.

1212,"&gt;Their priority is the NPB, and they're not going to send players over just to field a national team for a couple of games that has no reward.

If no one cared about games that were one-offs, they wouldn't hold the ASG anyway. If people watch it and it makes money, then it has reward. Like I said, cooperating with other leagues is the most difficult part of this, but it's not remotely impossible. All summer leagues have a similar mid-season break.

Japan is far more likely to agree to this than we are, because they actually give a shit about their national team and cooperation with the national team and NPB is a lot more common, they even released players during the summer olympics.

&gt;It's just the best MLB players making up several teams with a common country. I don't see how that's different from the best MLB players making up two teams with a common league.

Because people care a lot more about their country than which half of MLB a club happens to play in. Especially for people in other countries who have no ties to any cities with MLB teams.

&gt;It's already the only major sporting event that's on TV anyway, , so why try to add so much meaning?

1. it's not. Top level international soccer is usually on in July (plus MLS), and that's exactly the sport baseball is starting to lose out on in the key demographics in most baseball playing countries. 

2. The fact that it's the only sporting event on doesn't really matter. Most people aren't always looking to constantly be watching a sport. If they're not particularly interested, they'll watch something else that's not sports.

3. More meaning means that more people will watch it. It's that simple. If a very casual fan or someone who doesn't really follow baseball hears that the American League and the National League are playing each other, they have absolutely no reason to care. If they hear their national team is playing, they might tune in out of curiosity. It's clear that international competition grows a sport's audience like nothing else, and it's obvious that baseball has to start *actively* pursuing new fans instead of resting on its increasingly aging existing ones.

Yes it does, because that's what races *are*, Einstein. The species originated in Africa. The species expressing different phenotypes based on regional environments (what we call ""races"") didn't happen until after the species spread out of Africa *to different environments*. So the collection of phenotype expressions adapted to Europe that we call ""white people"" did not exist in Africa. They weren't ""white"" yet.

1282,"If you look at the history of the two sports, it's easy to see how one developed an international team culture and the other didn't.

International cricket started with the Ashes between England and Australia. Those were two natural, easy, and obvious opponents to form national teams. By the late 19th century, the two major baseball countries were the USA and Japan, so you might expect something like an annual ""baseball ashes"" to start between them. 

But there's one problem: racism. Anyone who knows the name Jackie Robinson knows the sport has a nasty history with racism. One of the sport's [biggest stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_Cobb) assaulted a spectator for implying he had mixed ancestry. Major leaguers didn't even want to share a field with other Americans of different races, so convincing them to host a team of Japanese players or traveling there themselves was out of the question. Baseball spread to many countries, but none of them white English-speaking countries. Compare that to cricket, which naturally spread to British colonies. Even today, with 1/4 of MLB players being foreign, you still have some of the older generation saying they should forget their own baseball traditions and learn to respect ""our"" game.

Another reason is that club baseball became a lot more profitable than club cricket a lot faster. A game that takes 2 hours instead of 5 days is always going to be more spectator friendly, and it drew in upper class and working class fans alike. So clubs started expanding their schedules more and more until before long they took up half the year and left no room for international tournaments. Today MLB season runs from the beginning of April to the end of October and each team plays 162 games. Keep that in mind the next time someone calls the IPL too long.",2016-07-27 18:23:47+00:00,d5taqai,6.0,t1_d5t9ltj,1323.0,Cricket

Both these tournaments are brand new. International baseball tournaments go back to [1938](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_World_Cup), but they were always strictly the realm of amateurs, so most (American) fans didn't even know about it. For various reasons, the prestige of national teams just never became part of the sport's culture. The WBC was the child of Bud Selig, the commissioner of MLB at the time, who really, *really* wanted to make international baseball more of a thing.

That has nothing to do with whether it's actually well written or not. Unless you're saying that comic book fans *don't* have a knee jerk angry reaction to anything they weren't expecting and giving any negative traits to characters they like.

&gt;Sure. Except they did it in the most messed up way possible.

yeah, and that makes *no* sense to have in the fucking Killing Joke. The entire book is an exercise in saying things in a way more fucked up way than what's actually necessary.

1293,"Baseball was axed by three reasons:

1) Baseball and softball fields can only be used for baseball and softball. You had hosts building stadiums and then having them demolished or sit empty afterwards. Even if a country doesn't play rugby, they can host a tournament in any rectangular field or use it for a different sport afterward.

This doesn't apply to Lacrosse. Field can be played on any rectangular field and box can be played on any hockey rink.

2) The Olympics is during the MLB season, so it was being contested by college kids. The Olympics used to be nothing but that, but now they want sports like basketball, where the sport's biggest stars attract big TV audiences

This *might* apply to lacrosse. The Olympics would overlap with MLL playoffs, but I see MLL adjusting their schedule around that to take advantage of the exposure. But even then, MLL's biggest ""stars"" aren't actually stars, the IOC knows how niche of a sport it is, and with them adding sports like rugby and freakin' *golf* they've made it clear what sports they're interested in. 

3) While baseball is played all over East Asia and the Americas, it is not played in Europe, and the IOC has always been very Euro-centric. Look at handball, which is pretty much *only* played in Europe and that's still an Olympic sport.

1302,"I think the people calling the first half unnecessary and has nothing to do with the main story are being unfair. For starters padding is absolutely necessary, because if you just adapted the book the movie would be 20 minutes long. It's extremely short even by graphic novel standards. Besides, if you just put the comic panels on film, what's even the point of adapting it? You can't stretch out the core story itself because that would screw with the pacing, the story doesn't ever slow in momentum to add new scenes. You have to work backwards from the material in the book and add more to the beginning.

The first half obviously ties in thematically. The relationship that Batgirl starts to develop with Paris mirrors Batman's relationship with Joker. It shows that once a criminal no longer fears Batman and instead becomes infatuated with him, his entire M.O. becomes ineffective. It's why Joker is the greatest of all Batman's villains and it's why their conflict has to inevitably end with one of them killing the other.
Another function the first half serves is allowing the audience to get to know batgirl before she's shot. A movie has to stand on its own as much as possible, you can't assume that the viewer has read hundreds of comics featuring Batgirl before. Batgirl getting shot is something that another story would have put towards the end. The reason why The Killing Joke is so problematically short is because it's basically all one climax, the third act to a longer movie that doesn't exist.

......That being said, I don't get why they didn't just write the first two acts of that movie. Instead they wrote the first two acts of a completely different movie. All the Batgirl background doesn't really stop her from being just a helpless victim, the movie still forgets about her after the hospital scene, because the story isn't about her and her relationship with Batman, it's about Batman's relationship with Joker. It would have been nice if they had written a first half where that relationship is still center stage, instead of just being thematically hinted at. If you want to explore the relationship and power dynamics between Batman and Batgirl, great, make a movie about that after you're done with this.

Remember when I asked what the point was of shot-for-shot adaptations? Well after the Batgirl backstory it is a shot-for-shot adaptation. I feel like that was a lost opportunity. While The Killing Joke is the most iconic exploration of Joker's motivations and relationship with Batman, it doesn't really contain anything that we haven't seen in Batman films before. The Dark Knight drew very heavily from Killing Joke. They could have gone beyond what the book did and said, with the theme of Joker trying to prove that everyone is like him deep down, culminating in the kidnapping of Jim. They could have really emphasized the twist at the end that Joker's flashbacks were really just one of many ways he remembers his origin, maybe showing some alternative flashbacks. You can still build up the relationship between Batman and Batgirl to make her attack more devastating, but have them fight The Joker. Ya know, the guy who's on the poster? I don't get why they had to have her fighting a completely new villain who's just an ordinary mobster.

All that said, I still give the film a 4/5. The original part isn't bad, I just think it could have been done better. Sexual tension between Batman and Batgirl isn't new. It made me super uncomfortable, but I'm pretty sure that's on purpose. And call me a baby, but the second half terrified me. I know Mark Hamill has said a few times that he's retiring because there's no way he can top what he just did, but I honestly don't see how he can top this performance. And Kevin Conroy's voice, which has sounded comforting and protective since I was 5, somehow manages to come off as unsettling and subtly flirting with insanity.

......That being said, I don't get why they didn't just write the first two acts of that movie. Instead they wrote the first two acts of a completely different movie. All the Batgirl background doesn't really stop her from being just a helpless victim, the movie still forgets about her after the hospital scene, because the story isn't about her and her relationship with Batman, it's about Batman's relationship with Joker. It would have been nice if they had written a first half where that relationship is still center stage, instead of just being thematically hinted at. If you want to explore the relationship and power dynamics between Batman and Batgirl, great, make a movie about that after you're done with this.

Remember when I asked what the point was of shot-for-shot adaptations? Well after the Batgirl backstory it is a shot-for-shot adaptation. I feel like that was a lost opportunity. While The Killing Joke is the most iconic exploration of Joker's motivations and relationship with Batman, it doesn't really contain anything that we haven't seen in Batman films before. The Dark Knight drew very heavily from Killing Joke. They could have gone beyond what the book did and said, with the theme of Joker trying to prove that everyone is like him deep down, culminating in the kidnapping of Jim. They could have really emphasized the twist at the end that Joker's flashbacks were really just one of many ways he remembers his origin, maybe showing some alternative flashbacks. You can still build up the relationship between Batman and Batgirl to make her attack more devastating, but have them fight The Joker. Ya know, the guy who's on the poster? I don't get why they had to have her fighting a completely new villain who's just an ordinary mobster.

All that said, I still give the film a 4/5. The original part isn't bad, I just think it could have been done better. Sexual tension between Batman and Batgirl isn't new. It made me super uncomfortable, but I'm pretty sure that's on purpose. And call me a baby, but the second half terrified me. I know Mark Hamill has said a few times that he's retiring because there's no way he can top what he just did, but I honestly don't see how he can top this performance. And Kevin Conroy's voice, which has sounded comforting and protective since I was 5, somehow manages to come off as unsettling and subtly flirting with insanity. These guys have shown that they're not complacent or bored with these characters they've had for two decades.",2016-07-26 06:24:35+00:00,d5r5v2z,1.0,t3_4ukw1u,33975.0,movies
1304,"I think the people calling the first half unnecessary and has nothing to do with the main story are being unfair. For starters padding is absolutely necessary, because if you just adapted the book the movie would be 20 minutes long. It's extremely short even by graphic novel standards. Besides, if you just put the comic panels on film, what's even the point of adapting it? You can't stretch out the core story itself because that would screw with the pacing, the story doesn't ever slow in momentum to add new scenes. You have to work backwards from the material in the book and add more to the beginning.

The first half obviously ties in thematically. The relationship that Batgirl starts to develop with Paris mirrors Batman's relationship with Joker. It shows that once a criminal no longer fears Batman and instead becomes infatuated with him, his entire M.O. becomes ineffective. It's why Joker is the greatest of all Batman's villains and it's why their conflict has to inevitably end with one of them killing the other.

Another function the first half serves is allowing the audience to get to know batgirl before she's shot. A movie has to stand on its own as much as possible, you can't assume that the viewer has read hundreds of comics featuring Batgirl before. Batgirl getting shot is something that another story would have put towards the end. The reason why *The Killing Joke* is so problematically short is because it's basically all one climax, the third act to a longer movie that doesn't exist.

Yes, and they all get a lot more attention than Georgia, who has shown to be better than most of them. Those countries aren't fighting for promotion to something like TRC because there's no competition below it to get promoted from, because it's not a continental championship. There's no solution for those countries as blatantly obvious as simply not isolating the 6N from the rest of the European structure. None of this has anything to do with whether it makes sense to open up the 6N, you're deflecting by saying ""well other countries are getting ignored, Georgia should be too.""",2016-07-20 20:06:01+00:00,d5k07qi,14.0,t1_d5js8f7,9933.0,rugbyunion
1365,"&gt;  For example more games in the summer tours and the Autumn Internationals

The summer/fall tours are meaningless friendlies. Even if the 6N were willing to cut back on playing SH teams during those windows (which they wouldn't, because they feel entitled to games against their superiors but feel it's unreasonable to pay it forward) and started to play against the likes of Georgia, they would never field their best teams and if Georgia did manage to win they would try to downplay it because hey, it's just a one-off summer/fall game.

The 6N is the European championship. Georgia is in europe, so they should have the right to contest that title.

&gt;It hardly makes the competition more legitimate if Georgia somehow win the play off and then get comprehensively spanked by every team.

Yes it does, because every team in the tournament earned their place there. It wouldn't be an invitational based on old connections and money.

&gt;They should play more games against teams around their level (Fiji, Samoa, Japan etc).

Why does this keep getting brought up? If the different tiers are always kept in isolation of each other, then nothing's going to change. The entire point of reforms like this is to get to a point where terms like ""Tier 1"" and ""Tier 2"" become obsolete. Playing nothing but teams that they're as good or slightly better than and only playing teams better than them one time during the fall isn't going to lead to any progress.

&gt;I am not against eventual relegation and promotion however I simply don't think Georgia are ready for it

They're never going to be ready for it if the competition remains closed. You're asking the cart to go before the horse. Even if they did get blown out after qualifying, they still earned that experience. You can't just pretend that the progress Italy have made wouldn't also be made by Georgia, and there's no reason why Italy should be given it while Georgia is denied it. The argument that Georgia has to *consistently* beat the wooden spoon to be considered is bullshit. They shouldn't have to prove that they're *a lot* better than one of the 6N, they should have to prove that they're at all better than the last place 6N *for that year.* If it was a fluke, that doesn't matter. Sports isn't about who can claim to be the best on paper, it's about who performs when it matters. And if it was a fluke the relegated team can prove it the next year.

&gt;And the relatively short travel times that are a part of the 6N would be changed.

This attitude is this sport's entire problem. A pro/rel playoff *is* how Georgia proves it. You're saying that they haven't earned the right to earn their place. That's an impressive amount of entitlement even for this sport. Instead of operating on a meritocracy with fixed rules, Georgia has to wait until the higher ups decide they've met some vaguely defined, arbitrary requirements. Georgia will literally never advance with that because the 6N will never admit it. If Georgia delivers more than Italy on game day, they deserve a shot in the top tier.

1425,"In the 19th century, there was a dispute among rugby clubs in England about paying players. The wealthier southern clubs thought all players should be amateur and play for the love of the game, because aristocrats didn't understand the concept of needing a job. Working class players would take the day off from work to play, so they wanted compensation.

This came to a head in 1895 when northern clubs split off from the Rugby Football Union to form the Rugby Football League. Over the next century, the two governing bodies would slowly implement rule changes that caused them to deviate into two separate sports, like football did with rugby.

Now, Union was made professional in 1995, so the conflict is moot now, but there's still a stigma in England and Australia of union being a posh rich boy's sport and league being a tough blue collar sport.",2016-07-18 14:22:26+00:00,d5gt9ub,4.0,t1_d5gs1kd,2166.0,nfl

Not to mention that those travel times make a single round robin unfair. Teams that got to play the Jags at home all have an advantage over all the teams that had to fly to Buenos Aires. The Jags' travel time is cut in half by playing most of their away games in South Africa.

And again, they're trying to make a decent TV audience. For an argentinian fan, games in South Africa are the only ones not happening at 3am. Evening games in South Africa are at 3am for NZ, so it'll improve the situation in the old countries too. They're trying to make *more* money than the Super 12 did to prevent player poaching by NH leagues. With a conference system more of each team's games are at a reasonable time for that team's fans.

They don't affect anything after they're over (except for the rankings, which is the case in every sport), because of that countries rarely field their best possible team, and because of that every single result is forgotten about within a year and is downplayed by the loser as not really meaning anything.

Literally every other sport on the planet recognizes this. The only reason the culture became different in rugby was because there wasn't a World Cup until the 80s and there were so few countries that played rugby that friendlies were the only sources for competition, so fans had to pretend that friendlies had a bigger impact than they did. But now ironically enough they're preventing the sport from expanding because every time a conversation starts about how to make the calendar more inclusive, it's shut down by people saying there's no room because the whole calendar is already full with friendlies.

1510,"&gt;Even at my lowly level the ref tells you how he is going to enforce the game before the match.

Refs do that more at club level than pro level. But that doesn't change the fact that refs shouldn't *get* to decide how they're going to ref the game. 

Every ref has their own set of rules. They ignore the official rules about when a ball is out of a ruck, they've all chosen to ignore the scrum feed rule, to the point where the only point of scrums is drawing penalties, they all have different definition of what offside is (that's all different than the official definition), they all like to only enforce the breakdown rules for the defence, to the point where you barely see counter-rucking at the pro level. The game *isn't* more interesting or varied because the refs force the game into a style they prefer, and the extreme lack of parity in the sport is in part because of refs having this much power.

Not to mention that union gives more power to the referee by awarding a penalty kick instead of a free kick for pretty much everything. Points shouldn't be earned by 50/50 scrum penalties, that's why scrums are the most cynically played part of the game. You shouldn't have entire games where the refs are the scorer of all the points.

Not holding the refs to any standard delegitimizes the sport. If every single conversation after the game starts with ""well with a different ref the result would have been different"" then that's a serious problem that needs to be addressed. Everyone smugly dismisses people who criticize the way the sport is reffed until they're screwed by it.",2016-07-12 15:07:23+00:00,d5997gy,5.0,t1_d58yox0,25915.0,rugbyunion

1790,"The main difference between the lore of JRRT and GRRM is that all the history of the world of ASOIAF is incomplete and unreliable. The closest thing GRRM has to The Silmarillion, The World of Ice and Fire, has an in-universe author, Maester Yandel. If you go back in time from the time of the series and away from Westeros, fact starts to blend with legend until all that's left is contradictory rumors.

Now, LOTR kinda has an in-universe author, it's supposed to be based on the Red Book by Bilbo and Frodo, but the difference is Middle-Earth has immortal elves that can give first hand accounts of thousands of years of history, so there's no need for GRRM's ambiguity. The inhabitants of each author's world affects how the prose itself is written.
Also worthy of note is how each author delivers exposition and context to the reader. GRRM delivers backstory much more traditionally, with characters discussing or thinking bout historical events or lore that pertain to what's happening to them. It's delivered in digestible bits over the course of the series. Tolkien, however, simply describes the events happening in the present, almost completely without historical context, and then dumps all the backstory in the appendices after the reader has finished.

With regards to the questions you've already asked

&gt;How historical events formed the geography

It seems to be a pretty consistent rule in Tolkien that only the divine can change the Earth. Only Iluvatar, the Valar, and Melkor can do things like raise mountains, sink islands, or flood continents. The only time I can think of this happening in ASOIAF is the Children of the Forest using it as an act of war, using magic to break the Arm of Dorne and flood the Neck.

&gt;How the geography of the world affected the settling and development of the civilisations/villages/great families

This is much more common in GoT. A large part of the text is explaining how available resources and natural events shaped politics. The Doom of Valyria creating a huge power vaccum that completely rewrote the world map, the Iron Islands being so barren turned the Ironborn into raiders, the narrow straights in the Jade Sea allowed Qarth to become wealthy by controlling trade, the drying up of the great inland sea created the Dothraki Sea and gave the Dothraki their power.

I'm having more trouble coming up with Tolkien of this. Tolkien seemed to make his civilizations shaped by deliberate actions rather than how the geography happened to be.
&gt;The differences between the evil forces in both and their segregation from the good

It's pretty much the entire point of ASOIAF is that good and evil can't be divided like that. Good and evil is present in all places and in every individual. Wildlings are shown to be people too that aren't any more savage than the soldiers fighting the terrible war to he south, the seemingly innocent Children of the Forest did unspeakable things in their war with he First Men, and there's good people among Nobles and commoners alike.",2016-06-06 01:02:55+00:00,d3xhfbm,1.0,t3_4mp7uv,16827.0,tolkienfans

Perfect, even less incentive to not disrupt the scrum. Not like this rule will ever be enforced, since refs like to give 50/50 penalties after scrum wheels instead of restarts.

&gt;Under the new law, a player in possession of the ball – for example, after it has been won at a lineout – will not be able to slide or move himself to the back of a maul, but rather the ball will have to be passed hand to hand to the man at the back of the maul.

2041,"&gt;I remember watching a documentary on baseball at the olympics (removed after 2008) and I believe one of the major reasons a sport is discontinued is when one nation dominates the sport over multiple years.

Well five different countries metaled, 3 of which won gold, during baseball's brief tenure in the olympics. That's not any less competitive than olympic basketball or hockey. The real reasons why baseball was abandoned was 

1) The Olympics are during the professional baseball season, meaning, apart from communist Cuba, all the teams were amateur college kids, which isn't good for TV money. They want team sports like basketball, which draw famous NBA players and all the marketability that comes with them.

2) While baseball is played all over both Americas and Asia, it is not played in Europe, and the IOC has always been very Euro-centric. Handball is still in the olympics and that's *only* played in Europe.

3) Once a baseball stadium is built, it can only be used for baseball, because it's shaped weird. Host countries were building baseball and softball fields and then had to tear them down or let them rot after 2 weeks because they can't easily be repurposed for other sports if the host country isn't into baseball.

None of these issues apply to rugby sevens. It's been drawing big name marketable stars, is played by several European countries, and can be played on any rectangular field.",2016-05-16 00:49:54+00:00,d36xwgs,4.0,t1_d36s9sy,9724.0,rugbyunion

It's applying your logic to a similar situation to show it's stupidity. It shouldn't be surprising you're still defending something this illogical when you can't even grasp an argument this simple. You said spanking isn't child abuse because it's not legally classified as such, which is moronic.

&gt;Not afraid of their parents. Afraid of the consequences of misbehaving.

.....the consequences being that your parents will hit you. It's teaching them to always do what their parents say, whether it makes sense or not, because they should be *afraid* of what they'll do if they don't obey.

Says the person that hitting a child is okay as long as it's on a specific part of the body, because reasons.

2267,"&gt;Yes, he absolutely did. 

When? When was there any kind of dialogue or character moment where Reese realizes the sanctity of all human life?

And again, it's not like he killed people earlier because he thought it wasn't wrong, he *didn't have a choice* because the writers recognized the reality of situations they put him in and didn't give him convenient cop outs

&gt;There's no Batman rule in effect. Reese, Shaw, and Root still kill people.

When was the last time we saw someone do a killshot in a firefight? I honestly can't think of one in season 4. We still have moments like Root snapping someone's neck because she doesn't like them, not because it's a life or death situation, but that's *more* morally dark, but that's the kind of killing they kept.

&gt;Another way to look at it after season 3 is that funds are limited, so it doesn't make sense to waste bullets. Kneecap a guy and he's out of the fight.

I don't see how shooting a knee that *may* take someone out of a fight wastes less bullets than shooting a body that *will* take someone out of a fight.

2268,"&gt;Yeah you mad, definitely flying off the handle a bit.

When? Disagreeing with you isn't ""flying off the handle."" Stop projecting.

Reese wants to help the good people by stopping the bad people. He straight up admits killing people ""never bothered him much."" He protects the innocent because he has so little innocence left, and has seen so many innocent people die, including Jessica. Finch hired Reese because he had ""the skills to intervene."" He knew Reese's attitude and methods and he hired him up front, he didn't set out to change him and only allowing him to use magical kneecaps.

And saying Carter influenced him doesn't make any sense because *Carter* killed people who were trying to kill her. You know, how cops do every single day in real life? They don't get convenient hollywood writing to make a nonlethal takedown of multiple armed assailants possible in every single situation.

&gt;So...you want what, a more brutal Reese?

Yes, but you're still completely missing the point. Reese killed enemy agents in earlier seasons not because he enjoyed it or thought that killing wasn't wrong, but because *he didn't have a choice,* because the writers recognized the reality of the situations they put him in. Making Reese have the same approach as real cops and soldiers doesn't make him some kind of brutal killing machine.

&gt;I never said the show is perfect, I have issues with some of the episodes and writing as well, but to lambast a character and ignore growth is just odd to me.

Again, stop drawing dichotomies. I'm not ""lambasting"" anything. I'm pointing out how the change in writing in the action scenes have caused one of the most provocative, unapologetic, and up-for-debate shows on TV to play it more safe and hold the audience's hand more, and unintentionally robbed my favorite character on the show of what made him stand out.

&gt;You keep claiming the characters don't grow, how can you honestly think that? You think Reese in the Pilot is the same as the one in the season 4 finale? Seriously?

I never even once claimed that. I said that character growth doesn't explain the change in action scenes. Reese's growth has been about allowing himself to form bonds with people again. That's what's actually *shown on camera,* not what you fill in in your head to fix holes the writers left for them.

&gt;That absolutely is not what Samaritan represents. Samaritan is what would have happened had the Machine be built as an open system, and it says more about humanity than anything. To water it down to, ""oh it's just an evil version of the Machine"" diminishes pretty much the entire plot.

That is *literally what Samaritan is.* For Christ's sake, it calls humans insects, openly declares itself a God, declares war on the machine, and seeks power just for power's sake. None of that has absolutely anything to do with the fact that it's an open system, that's just it being Skynet from the moment it turned on. The fact that it's an open system didn't actually end up mattering, since it's the humans taking orders from the AI, instead of humans exploiting the information gathered by the AI, which was the entire cause for concern when the issue was still an issue.",2016-05-03 03:17:59+00:00,d2qkzbs,8.0,t1_d2qjp6h,1993.0,PersonOfInterest

Compare that to the season 1 finale, with Reese using HR's bomb against them and blowing them up in the middle of a car chase. You can call Finch becoming against Reese killing people in firefights character progression, but it's not character progression that makes sense.

And it's not just the first season. Reese tries to kill the head of HR but his gun jammed. He voted for killing the senator to prevent Samaritan going online.

2270,"&gt; If you have seen the show, and yet believe there hasn't been an actual moment of character development as to why Reese has an aversion to killing except in certain circumstances then I don't know how to help you.

Now who has vinegar? Don't just brush off a point with what amounts to ""u mad bro?"" What moment in the show can you point to that turns Reese away from killing under any circumstances? 

&gt;He doesn't outright kill anyone unless in revenge, or not given any other choice. If he has the option, he chooses to disable rather than kill. This was shown and touched on repeatedly.

Yes, that's what I'm saying, I'm also saying that in Season 4 the writers made it a lot *easier* for Reese to not kill people through convenient writing. He never performed executions, but he was a realistic soldier with realistic enemies who didn't magically fall asleep when hit with the PG action scenes tropes.

&gt;Uh sure bud, a show about an AI v AI apocalyptic war featuring surveillance states, corrupt cops, people repeatedly shot in the leg/chest/arms-yet-still-live requires no suspension of disbelief.

The vast majority of the technology featured on the first 3 seasons of the show was rooted in reality. It's stuff that *sounds* science fiction but actually exists. Again, waving off the use of unrealistic cliches in the name of sanitizing the characters by saying ""eh, it's unrealistic anyway"" isn't a way to get your show taken seriously.

&gt;This is one of the best written shows I have ever seen, and this opinion is shared by quite a few others.

I share it too, that doesn't mean every single thing the show has ever done has been perfect. Don't create a false dichotomy.

&gt; But to demand a logical explanation of why they suddenly changed their action scenes to feature a shot to the knee rather than the chest is a suspension of disbelief. You took that statement as me applying that to the whole show, that's not the case at all.

""Suspension of disbelief"" is a *limited* amount of forgiveness for the fact that every single little detail can't be made perfectly realistic. The phrase isn't a green light to write whatever you want.

&gt;They had to give them a greater sense of morality to grow the characters. It is a bit tough to relate or become invested in a character if they remain the same throughout the entire show.

But it hasn't *grown* the characters, that's what I'm saying. They could have worked the change into character growth, which is why you're filling in holes that the writers left, but having Reese behave the same way except now he has a ""get out of killing free"" card from the writers isn't growth.

&gt;Reese and Shaw are the most interesting characters in the entire show. Here you have two former assassins who for different reasons are very closed off individuals and do not share their emotions with anyone. Watching their characters grow and evolve over the course of the series is one of the brightest spots.

""grow and evolve"" here meaning the writers saying ""these two are totally in love now because reasons.""

&gt;I'm sure these themes will be the focal point of S5, but they have been present throughout the show. They did take a backseat earlier on with all the number-of-the-week episodes, but since it has become more AI-war-focused, it has come back in a big way.

No, the AI-war storyline gave the machine an evil twin, a trope that is the polar opposite of moral ambiguity. It exists to make the original look better by giving a definitive villain version. It's answering the question of the early seasons of ""should the Machine be feared"" with a definitive ""No, this evil version of the machine should be feared.""",2016-05-03 02:24:05+00:00,d2qiuzy,6.0,t1_d2qhwhn,1384.0,PersonOfInterest

The thing about that is there has to have *been* actual changes in the characters, not just assuming so because things are now different.

And *that's a problem*, what made this show great is that it required *less* suspension of disbelief. You can't use contrived writing that takes you out of the show and then say ""well, that's TV."" If the writers don't take their show seriously, why should the audience? Making the characters so sanitary limits how you can write action scenes. Basically every action scene in season 4 was ""Samaritan agents shoot at Shaw and Reese with stormtrooper accuracy, then they kneecap them instantly."" Contrast that to the season 1 finale with Reese using HR's own bomb against them and blowing their car up in the middle of a chase.

&gt;they had to figure out a way to develop these badasses and give them a greater sense of morality.

Why? Why did they *have* to do that? Moral ambiguity is what this show was built on, whether the machine causes more harm than good, whether Finch and Reese are justified taking the law into their own hands, whether surveillance for the sake of security is a good thing, making the show more black vs white, good vs bad loses what made it so creative and ambitious.",2016-05-03 01:48:56+00:00,d2qhdq3,4.0,t1_d2qgwdo,665.0,PersonOfInterest

2308,"&gt; The Sunwolves would be in the New Zealand conference and the Jaguares in the Australian conference. For ultimate fairness the Jaguares and Sunwolves would swap conferences each year.

The fuck? All this does is help the SA teams while screwing over the Jags. NZ/Australia is literally on the other side of the planet from Argentina, South Africa is over twice as closer. The only way putting Jaguars in Aus or NZ is feasible is if they have a completely split schedule, first half home second half away, and are given ""home"" training grounds in each country while they're touring.

&gt;Each team would play six games in their own conference and four games in the other two conferences, plus two byes.

Wait, they play six games in their six team conference? How does that make sense? That means playing one random team one extra time, that's completely unfair and is down to the luck of what team you draw for that extra game. The entire point of having conferences is that the schedule is completely balanced *within* the conference.

And is he advocating cutting the season down to just 10 games a team? What's the point of that? That's cutting the league down to 90s levels.

&gt;Almost the same number of games to televise, with more in viewer-friendly timeslots.

This league spans the globe, you're not going to have every game at a convenient time for everyone. If we make more and more of the games between teams of the same countries, that defeats the whole international purpose of the league, just have the champions of Currie Cup, ITM Cup, and NPC play each other.

&gt;The Sunwolves wouldn’t be crippled by unfair travel requirements and could build their home support base with their full share of home games in Tokyo

The SA teams pushed for the games in Singapore to reduce travel costs, even though it's their fault the wolves are in the SA conference, since SA pushed for a sixth team they had to put Sunwolves in SA to make the conferences as balanced as possible. Everyone's blaming the Sunwolves and Jaguares for messing up the format when the Kings are actually the source of it.

&gt;The schedule would be fairer, with the SA teams losing their current unfair advantages of 3-4 perennially weak teams and extra finals over and above their proportional representation.

Except you're still advocating the majority of games being in-conference. When a league gets big enough to need conferences, sometimes a team without the best regular season record gets into the playoffs. Welcome to sports. The SA teams' out of conference results depends entirely on what out of conference teams they get. If one team gets the Reds, Force, Blues, and Sunwolves, and the other team gets Rebels, Chiefs, Crusaders, and Hurricanes, the only far way to choose who gets into the playoffs is their record against *each other.*",2016-04-27 17:22:15+00:00,d2jjy6p,1.0,t3_4gntok,25844.0,rugbyunion

2311,"&gt; Let's use BvS for an example. A Minority of people LOOOVE this movie. Does that mean it's good when the majority does not?

It doesn't mean anything beyond not a lot of people like it, and you probably won't like it going into it. I hate the movie but I don't feel the need to disguise my opinions as facts because I'm not a self-absorbed asshole

&gt;BK? Huh, not everyone likes burger king.

Few people hate burger king either. That's the point. It serves a function and nobody is absolutely disgusted, so by your logic it's a metaphor for a great movie

&gt; And As I recall, some of the greatest genre films of all time (Star Wars, Dark Knight, Alien, Terminator 2) made a ton of money at the box office. And on the other end of the spectrum great films that don't make good money are loved by critics. So how should we judge movies then?

Whether or not you feel happy that you watched it? This isn't really complicated. If you get a positive emotional impact from a movie, to you it's a good movie. A low RT score just means you're in the minority, it doesn't make you wrong.

&gt;Please tell me your oh so brilliant solution since you seem so determined that there is no such thing as an objectively bad or good movie.

There's no ""solution"" because *this isn't a problem.* The only reason why you would need a way to say if a movie is objectively good or bad is to prove yourself ""right"" because you care more about ""winning"" arguments and asserting your opinions over others than actually enjoying a movie.

&gt;Now if you think you can just throw a blog up and be put on rotten tomatoes you've obviously shown your ignorance. Here's the criteria to get your critic review on RT http://www.rottentomatoes.com/help_desk/critics/

It doesn't matter jack fucking shit what RT's self-professed standards are when it's a fact that reviews like [this](http://www.sandiegoreader.com/movies/how-to-train-your-dragon-2/#) are counted towards the official score. For someone jerking off objectivity so hard you sure are focusing on your own romantic ideas about review writing instead of what's in front of you.

&gt;User scores are different and no one uses that gauge as an OFFICIAL rating, only a helpful guide.

The audience score is a million times more useful than the ""official"" rating, since people going to the website are members of the audience, not desperate writers.

&gt;You seriously believe people are interested in a critics review because they just want to know what they personally thought of the film? NO! They read it because they want to know if it's worth their money to see a film in theaters or if they should stay home or check something else out.

Which is exactly why people want an explanation as to *why* they might or might not like it based on what the movie does right and wrong and what kind of tastes it appeals to. *Most* people don't want an opinion disguised as a fact shoved down their throats and accept it because someone else wrote a review online so their opinion must matter more than mine. Because I'm not going to assume I have the same tastes as a critic, a stubborn ""don't go see this"" isn't remotely as useful as a breakdown of what kind of audiences would like the movie so I can decide *for myself* if I'm one of them.

It doesn't surprise me when you want critics to project their tastes onto everyone since that's exactly what you're doing.

&gt;And another thing, most people listen to critics with similar taste which is why critics don't worry about having universal appeal in their reviews. They know their viewers might not always agree with them but they respect honesty and if they never agree on taste they will simply find another reviewer that has similar taste in movies and use them to determine whether they should see a movie or not.

Yeah, because everyone keeps track of dozens of different movie critics and what their tastes are. People totally don't just look at the RT score on their phone and maybe the 3 most recent reviews. Yes, there are some critics that disguise their opinions as facts and steamroll and dismiss any differing opinions. And these writers *fucking suck.* Literally no one likes them. I'm starting to believe the only possible explanation is you *are* one of these useless writers desperately trying to seem relevant.

&gt;Sorry I have to smell my own fart for a second.... MMMM I enjoy that, therefore it's objectively good right? I love it even though no one else does. Means that fart is ahead of it's time and a successful piece of art. Oh wait no. It's only after a consensus of artists, critics, and consumers found that fart appealing that it became truly wonderful and ahead of it's time. Otherwise it's just a smelly fart that remains a smelly fart.

No you pretentious ass, it's *people* that decide if something is good, in its time or after it. I never said anything about being ""ahead of its time,"" the time doesn't fucking matter. 

&gt; MMMM I enjoy that, therefore it's objectively good right?

The fact that it *wouldn't* be ""objectively"" good is *literally what I've been saying this entire time, Einstein.* The only way to maintain this opinion of yourself is to turn everything said to you upside down into something ridiculous to make your own asinine assumptions look better by comparison.

&gt;Now the RT are not comparable to test scores because test scores are based on objective right or wrong answers that have been predetermined by the test makers. RT are comparable to political polls.

You're really good at clinging onto metaphors that make your argument look *worse.* If a candidate gets low polling numbers that doesn't objectively mean that they're a bad candidate. By your logic the fact that Trump is running away with polling numbers means he's ""objectively"" good presidential material.

But even though your metaphor works against you instead of for you again, it's still a shitty metaphor. The express purpose of a president is to represent all voters equally, that's not what art is supposed to do. The only way to assume it's possible to make a movie that satisfies everyone is to narcissistically  assume that your tastes are objective, universal, and everyone who disagrees with you is an ""outlier.""

&gt; If you go in to a movie that critics and audiences both loved and you have high probability of liking it, the film is objectively good.

No, it means that it has a broad appeal.

&gt; That person who didn't like it isn't wrong for disliking the film, but they cannot say it is bad and be objectively right that it is bad.

......they can absolutely say that it is bad. Everyone is allowed to call any movie good or bad because their opinion doesn't matter any less their yours just because you're siding with the majority. The fact that they're not objectively right about it is *literally the very thing that I've been saying, you fucking moron.*

&gt;They can only be objectively right in their own personal taste being against the film.

That's all ***ANYONE*** can be objectively right about. Gathering lots of subjective things doesn't turn them into an objective thing, the plural form of opinion isn't fact.",2016-04-27 15:39:11+00:00,d2jf7eb,14.0,t1_d2j4qbe,20840.0,Marvel
2312,"&gt; An objective 1/4 score is to let the artist know that their film is not adequate and required improvement going forward. That's all. If that same cook said ""Well Debbie loved it! So everyone else is wrong"" would you not be puzzled by the cooks arrogant attitude?

No, because that's not at all what it's like. It's like being told beforehand ""this stuff is an acquired taste, not everyone enjoys it. You've got about a 1/4 chance of enjoying it."" If you try it and hate it you can't get mad and not be an asshole. You're allowed to like or hate any movie no matter how popular it is, that doesn't mean an RT score of 50% somehow ""proves"" that a movie is ""objectively"" bad.

&gt;The meal that was ""edible"" by 100% of the dinner guests is actually far more satisfactory of a result because it means the dinner party was a success. No one had a bad time, no one complained, and the next dinner party will be attended (think money made by the studio, audience enjoyment, and producers green-lighting new projects in my allegory or hosting).

In movie terms, this is a bland, mediocre movie that no one regrets seeing because it entertains them for a few hours but instantly forgets about as soon as they leave the theater. Using studio profit and the accounting of greenlighting new projects to determine whether a movie is *good* is asinine and you know it. Unless you think Avatar is millions of people's favorite movie. You know what that last sentence in that metaphor you're hung up on applies to? Burger King.

&gt;Now as far as actual reviews go, sure. Many critics say ""If you like x and y your will like z. But as for me I say pass"" That is not exactly a lukewarm opinion, that's passive aggressive at best. And it's STILL either positive or negative. 

You're reading what you want to read. If a critic says ""some things work, some things didn't"" that is, by definition, lukewarm, you're forcing in a more partisan stance because you apparently want critics to straight up tell people what to see and what not

&gt;Sure most of us can take or leave a movie, but at the end of the day a reviewers job (It's literally why the do what they are paid to do) is to definitively tell us to see a movie or not.

*No it's not.* That's literally the entire reason why 1-10 scales and A, B, C grades exist. It's RT that classifies each review into fresh or rotten. Unless critics either despise or are in love with a movie, they'll go into detail about what kind of moviegoer would like which movies. When they say ""If you're into this you'll like it, but I'll pass,"" they mean exactly that, *they'll* pass. Not everyone is as far up their own ass as you.

&gt;Being a paid respected critic is hard work and very sought after. All these people have strong reputations and worked hard to get to the level they are at.

You can literally get your reviews posted on RT by starting a blog and writing a single paragraph about a movie

&gt;You think them recommending a movie they don't believe in is an easy choice for them? No! They spend hours upon hours writing their reviews which takes effort, thought, and reflection.

They bang out a review shortly after they see the movie in order to be the first one out there to start getting clicks. Besides the fact that it's not about recommending a movie ""they don't believe in,"" it's about weighing the fact that *other* people probably will like the movie, and the fact that they honestly don't have strong feelings one way or another. If a movie is a mixed bag your feelings about it can change depending on what mood you're in when you watch it. If you're entire job is to apparently tell other people what they should see, then you can't act like your tastes are universal.

You can say all this romantic bullshit about the ""integrity"" of the great film critics of our time, anyone can see that they have lukewarm responses to movies just like everyone else.

&gt;And objective artist merit does exist. It needs to exist for artistic mediums to uphold their quality

The only people who say this are art critics desperately trying to put themselves above everyone else and film students studying for a test. What have been considered ""objective"" merit changes from place to place and time to time based on who's writing the textbooks. New artists start doing things that are ""objectively"" bad, time passes, and their style becomes the new ""objectively"" good.

&gt; Great art is universal and anyone who talks to friends about what they like and don't like can find common ground and themes

This is simply proven untrue by *talking to people* No group of friends on the planet doesn't have movies that they will get into absolute shouting matches over. Yes, there are beats and tropes that we're pre-programmed to be attracted to, and using those can make your movie have broad appeal, but that doesn't somehow prove that a minority who like a movie are ""objectively"" wrong or that **Rotten Tomatoes scores are comparable to school test scores.**

Yeah, remember that? You're so busy sniffing your own farts and defending the sacred honor of film critics that you forgot what you originally got offended about

&gt; If a film critics loves a film and a casual film goer loved the same film does that not mean anything to the films credit? By your logic it doesn't.

It means that someone else seeing it has a high probability of also liking it. It doesn't mean that the 1 in 10 person who says that it sucks is somehow ""objectively"" wrong.

That makes no sense. Unless I'm speaking in memes I'm not perpetuating the issue.

2317,"&gt; it's very true and you're being dishonest if 3/4 of your friends called your meal edible and didn't take offense.

You're deliberately completely turning around what I said. I said that I wouldn't like it if everyone called it mediocre, it would be better to have at least one person enthusiastically love it.

Not to mention the fact that the two situations aren't even comparable because eating actually serves a biological function, it's not art's purpose to be ""passably mediocre"" to every single person that sees it.

&gt; And also dishonest if you believe for a second that critics aren't zealous and opinionated in their tastes for films. If you told me 98% of critics have a film 51% aka fresh on RT I'd say you don't understand human nature. To your credit, that is an interesting point and not without validity, but it does not account for the fact that most critics give a definitive recommendation in their reviews. It's in their job description. No critic says ""I like this film about 53%"" their job is to say see it or pass. And if we're going by test scores, P/F is more accurate a comparison.

......okay, I'm now convinced you've never actually read a film review. Critics have lukewarm reactions to movies all the time. ""It wasn't terrible, I'd recommend it if you're into this kind of thing,"" or ""it does a lot of things right, if you can look past its flaws."" Kids movies alone get inflated because critics just say ""it's cute, it'll keep your kid entertained for a few hours. 3/5 stars."" You're the one who doesn't understand human nature if you think people either love or hate every movie that they see. The fact that they're forced to reduce this broad spectrum of emotional responses to a movie down to a single binary ""see it"" or ""don't see it"" recommendation is *my entire fucking point.*

&gt;but is is useful in understanding the objective appeal the film holds.

This is an oxymoronic phrase. Again, in order for it to be ""objective,"" all audiences would have to have the same things that appeal to them. All a aggregate critical score is is a collection of ""PERSONAL tastes.""",2016-04-27 06:55:35+00:00,d2j1ug4,10.0,t1_d2j1kk7,839.0,Marvel

That is complete bullshit.

If 1/4 of my friends said they *loved* what I made them, yes I would consider that more satisfying than if 4/4 considered it ""edible."" But RT would still give the second one the better score.

RT isn't anything at all like a school test because a question has *one answer* that you either get right or wrong. A score of 50% doesn't mean that half the movie sucks, it means that you have a 50/50 shot of liking it, assuming you have the same narrow tastes of people who write film reviews for a living. The only way to possibly compare RT scores with a school test is to assume that all audiences have identical tastes and that people's reactions to a movie are binary.

People project human needs on non-human animals because they've seen too many Disney movies. Animals are concerned with survival, even ones as smart as elephants, if they have a permanent food source, protection from predators, security for their young, and in the case of social animals, interaction. It's only 21st century 1st-world humans that obsess over abstract shit like whether they ""belong"" where they are.

2430,"&gt; But none of these guys I would say, have trained to become full-time professional rugby athletes or just pro athletes in general as you see with Southern and Northern Hemisphere pro rugby.

Well.....yeah. That's the point. That's the entire reason why this league exists, to create a supply of American professional rugby players. What's the logic here? They shouldn't be in a pro league because they haven't trained full-time? They can't train full-time *because there's no pro league.* What, are we supposed to fill the rosters with All Blacks and Springboks? Not only is there no money for that, that will do absolutely fuck all for the national team. And a country's domestic league is indeed vital to their international performance, anyone who says differently knows nothing about the sport, you can't separate the two.

&gt;He was also arguing that unions (this would describe the reason of why they did not attempt to go through sanctioning with USAR or WR) derail a pro rugby product due to their international player restrictions and such. He was saying that pro leagues should have nothing to do with development, which he does kind of have a point. The NFL is not involved in the development of football in the U.S., at least not directly. They do not organize the pop warner leagues, make the rules and restrictions for each league and/ or team. As long as they had people watching its a success. Same with the NBA, they are not involved in the development of the youth, high school, or college. If anything they're purely motivation.

That's because nobody gives a shit about international football, and only cares about international basketball once every four years. No single domestic rugby club is ever going to be as popular as the Eagles, so the Eagles are the product they're trying to improve. And it works both ways. If the Eagles get better, they get more attention, and people start paying attention to their domestic clubs. Why do you think Saracens are the most popular club in the states? How many new fans do you think the Galaxy got every time Donovan shined on the national team? The NBA doesn't care about development (except when they do, with their scholarships) because they don't have to. They have the most money, all the best players in the world flock to them, and the national team wins everything. None of that applies to rugby. A rugby league has to worry about the stability of the sport's entire system, not just its own bottom line.

&gt;In closing, yes he is salty but he is not speaking total BS. PRO rugby will take years before it is at the stage where it will be elite rugby and is able to compete with nations abroad.

Yeah, no shit, nobody is expecting PRO to instantly compete with the European leagues, but is he saying the NRFL would have? How does filling rosters with college football washouts help it compete with actual rugby leagues? It's probably going to be at least a decade until PRO even comes close to the Tier 1 leagues or starts to benefit the Eagles, but that's still better than we would be a decade from now with nothing but amateur clubs.

&gt;With their AOL streaming, lack of huge promotion, and other nuances, it is not going to attract the larger audience of the U.S.

They're not shelling out for huge promotion because they don't want to go broke after a year. Before they can start worrying about converting fans from other sports, they need to get the attention of existing rugby fans and players, who aren't going to bother with PRO if they think it's going to sputter and die just like the last ten attempts at a pro league here.

3. Radio is free because of commercials. They talk over the music because they like to hear themselves talk.

2597,"I brought up Tumblr because that's where you find bad writing like this. It's really anywhere that you find fanfiction, but Tumblr's just the biggest example. It's an example of how awkward teenagers love the idea of the darkly dressed asshole just being misunderstood.

You ever hear the phrase ""the death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic?"" It applies to fiction. Big battle scenes don't impact the audience nearly as much as the death of one character. When she starts throwing all these deaths at us at once, a lot of whom are minor characters that you barely remember exist, it just kind of blends together into ""yeah, okay, I get it."" You're not given a moment to process one death before you're hit with another one, the book instantly forgets about them. Most of the main characters don't even get death scenes, they're dead bodies are just briefly seen. Emotional moments need to be written and paced properly, or they'll have no more emotional impact than reading the plot summary on Wikipedia. It doesn't mean jack shit if it's ""realistic"" or not, that's the high school mentality that you can wave away bad writing by saying it's edgy.

Harry coming back didn't make any sense. The explanation the book gave was that he didn't die because Voldemort used his blood to come back. That's a completely new rule and plot device that the book never talked about before, it's a deus ex machina.

The only reason Voldemort is defeated is because Harry became the master of the Elder Wand completely by accident. Through the entire series, Voldemort says the only reason Harry is alive is because of sheer luck and other people sacrificing for him, and that's *exactly what happens.""* With the last book's ending Harry defeats Voldemort without actually *doing* anything. People have died saving his ass and his friends do most of the work destroying the horcruxes.

2656,"Rugby is probably the worst officiated sport in the world.

There needs to be more than one referee on the field. Every other sport except soccer and rugby have realized this. The field is huge, there's 30 players to watch, and it's impossible to see everything, and we should actually *address* that instead of accepting that the referee can be a deciding factor in a game. At the very least have a ref for each side of the scrum, right now the ref just decides which side is going to cheat. 

The sport needs to start making refs enforce the rules, instead of each having their own ""interpretation"" of them. No other sport in the world allows refs to just ignore certain rules or make up their own in order to force the game into a style they like (Owens does this all the time). The fact that after every game there's a conversation that goes ""well with a different ref the other team would have won"" delegitimizes the sport. 

Refereeing bias against unfavored teams is absolutely a thing. It's not necessarily some conspiracy to ensure a win for more profitable teams (though I don't think that's outside the realm of possibility), it's just plain confirmation bias. If a ref has it in his head that one side will commit more penalties, he's going to be *looking* at that team a lot more and judging them a lot more harshly. Human eyeballs can only focus on one thing at a time. If he makes a wrong call in favor of the favored team, who cares, it probably didn't change anything. But if he makes a wrong call in favor of the underdog, he might have cost a major team a victory and possibly knocked them out of a tournament. There's a lot more pressure on a ref from one side than another, so refs would rather make game-deciding non calls than game-deciding calls.

2665,"1. No one is talking about straight promotion and relegation, everyone is in favor of the idea of a pro/rel playoff.

2. Even if a team got promoted just to get demoted again, how does that not help them? Spending half their time banished to the ENC is sure as fuck a lot better than being stuck there permanently with nothing to work for because the system is set up to fuck you over.

3. How the hell does it not fix the issue? *The issue* is that the system is set up to preserve the status quo and is a fixed aristocracy. 

&gt; This is how we end up with broken policy and unworkable systems.

Broken policy and unworkable systems is what we have now.

&gt;If we just go ahead and implement it with no clear plan for before and after, we may very well end up in a worse off situation with no fix,

What worse situation? If you're right and no one outside the 6N can compete with them then nothing will change. You can't just say that the sky will fall if we make the competition fair without saying what exactly you're afraid of.

&gt;cause once its here there is no going back.

Good.

&gt;It promotion and relegation is going to come in, then it needs to be properly implemented, just introducing it is simply plastering over the real issues.

What real issues? The real issues is that the top countries in the ENC can't improve because they're not being challenged at all.

&gt;The first step is to introduce games with the European Nations out with of the 6 Nations

What's the point of doing that instead of making the actual competition a meritocracy and, if all the 6N can't go a year without playing each other, putting *that* in the meaningless one-off friendlies? The 6N will never give up the summer and fall friendlies because that's when they get to compete with the southern hemisphere, and they're so spoiled that they feel entitled to always get games with their southern superiors but act like the world would end if they paid it forward at all.

&gt;lowly bed them in and close the gulf in quality. Then reform can happen.

You've got this completely backwards. The gulf won't close *until* reforms happen, that's the entire fucking reason why reforms are needed.

&gt;Which is happening to an extent with the European Clubs.

1. You can't compare the clubs to national teams, helping one doesn't help the other, 2. You mean the arbitrary invitation qualifying tournament for the right to be the one team from outside the 6N to get the right to play three of the worst clubs in their leagues, both sides filled with import players? Don't make a mountain out of that molehill.

Allowing a country to get promoted if they *earned* it isn't helping them, it's simply allowing them to help themselves. The current setup *is* helping one nation at the expense of others.

2668,"&gt;Hockey is a negligible worldwide sport in terms of commercial impact. Australia is #1 in the world yet nobody watches it.

....what, *field* hockey? Yeah no shit nobody watches that, Canada is #1 in the hockey that is a major worldwide sport (well, North America and Europe wide at least).

&gt;It's had a meaningful presence in a lot more countries than 12 (I assume you meant 13 actually).

No, I meant 9, not including the tiny Pacific countries. Ireland, Scotland, England, Wales, France, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Argentina. You can't call rugby anything other than an extremely niche sport in Italy, it's not any bigger than in North America, despite the fact that the other 6N have been artificially propping it up at the expense of other countries.

&gt;Crowds for 'tier 2' nations have been consistently growing.

No, they've been rising in some and dropping in others. The number of registered players and attendance for games has remained little more than a zero sum game. And what growth is happening you can't credit to the system. Growth is happening *in spite* of the way the sport is run, not because of it. Its own administrators are rugby's own worst enemy.

&gt;Rugby will never be as successful as football or basketball. You can't have a pickup game of Rugby.

......so? Football is the most popular sport in the US, hockey is the most popular sport in Canada, rugby league is the most popular sport in parts of Australia, all of which are a lot harder to have a pickup game of than soccer and basketball. Hell, millions of people watch tennis, golf, and motorsports every year and that's sure as shit not accessible to most people. Nutrition and strength training is hugely important in literally every sport, that's what makes it a sport.

&gt;Can we force the 6 Nations to bend to the rest of the world? Absolutely not.

....yes we can. That's literally the entire point of international governing bodies. To make sure individual members don't harm the sport at large in the name of their own profits. No other sport in the world has closed off top competitions and top teams that take up most of the calendar with meaningless one off friendlies against each other every year.

2670,"&gt;Because they are seperate entities? The 6 Nations do not control the WR board. Influence, yes, but certainly not control. For instance, the home nations didn't believe in the World Cup idea and were outvoted.

The voting system was completely different then. The current system is set up so that the 10 richest unions basically control WR. So even if the entire southern hemisphere pressure them to do something they can prevent almost all changes from happening if they're united about it.

&gt;Has it really stagnated? I'll not argue that there hasn't been bad decisions, but rugby is one of the most popular team sports in the world, after football, cricket and arguably basketball.

Yes, it has stagnated. It's had a meaningful presence in the same 9 countries for the better part of a century (12 if you count Pacific Islands), and in almost all of those it's still a minority sport. There's no ""arguably"" about it being miles behind basketball, I'd also say it's maybe fallen behind hockey (~16 countries, though most of them are Europe) and baseball(~15 countries). I *would* say it's bigger than cricket, which is also only played in 10 countries, it just gets huge viewing numbers because of India. You're seriously overestimating the global presence of rugby and seem to have a very Anglo-centric view of the sports world. Every single one of those other sports has invested heavily in spreading their product to new markets even if it's not profitable in the short term.

&gt; It's expanding at a sustainable pace.

In some places, which is what WR's marketing focuses on. For every country that's picking it up, there's one that's dropping it. In Romania interest has been dropping for decades, even in Georgia interest is starting to stagnate and dry up, because what's the point?

&gt;Would you rather the WR voting system be like FIFA and the horrible corruption that permiates that sport?

You mean the system that has led to development reaching countries it never would have otherwise gotten it, allows every single country a path to the top if they earn it, and is the entire reason why soccer is played in every single place on Earth and has cemented itself as the definitive World's game? Yes, I would love it if WR was set up like FIFA. FIFA's system has been abused and manipulated by corruption, but WR's system is literally *built* on corruption. What would you call a handful of connected figures holding all the keys and money, and using that to make sure the status quo never changes, other than ""corruption?""

&gt;but in sport a meritocracy is more effective than a democracy.

Any character's death is supposed to be *climactic.* They stuck Superman's death at the end of a Batman movie, and made the aftermath about how it affects Batman.

We're supposed to be heartbroken during his final scene with Lois even though we've seen them together for about 30 seconds.

They stuck the ending of one Superman movie onto the body of another. It doesn't make sense that all the people who were calling for his head suddenly love him after he's dead. They wouldn't have changed their minds because Superman never got a chance to prove to them that he's good. Nobody was there to see how willingly he sacrificed himself. So Superman's death doesn't mean anything to the actual *Superman* story until he comes back.

&gt;The reality is, Reddit (and this sub in particular) doesn't like it when people are smarter than they are. It's become the most masturbatory sub on the site. But I find it hilarious, that pretentious pricks have found a place to gather to talk about people they identify as pretentious pricks.

And there's nothing about the tournament that inherently means it would be without the best pitchers. There are limits on how much a pitcher can do, so it just requires depth. And again, all teams are affected equally, so it just makes the style of baseball *different,* not inherently worse. Not all leagues are as pitcher friendly as MLB.

The hockey world championships happen every single year without any of the players in the NHL playoffs, yet people still care. They don't let the fact that a few good players didn't get called up make them dismiss watching their national team.

Also countries like Greece have one stadium above 35k capacity, and only five stadiums above 25k. Uruguay don't have enough stadiums either, same goes for Sweden, Denmark, Portugal, and Switzerland.

Which are perfectly fine. You don't need ten different 100,000 capacity stadiums in as many different cities that have all had multi million dollar renovations to make them look futuristic for a month. The entire problem is that the World Cup needs to be scaled down and not be this bloated, cancerous multi billion dollar extravagance that bankrupts the host and only makes money for FIFA.

He refuses to take any kind of responsibility, throws players under the bus, plays players in positions that they've literally never played in before, gets into pissing contests with everyone else in US soccer, and brushes off any criticisms as people not ""getting it."" He promised more proactive soccer when he signed on and then constantly uses a flat 4-4-2 that the rest of the world fell out of love of 20 years ago. He keeps spewing shit about raising our standards and then constantly lowers the bar for his coaching tenure to be a success. We can't call barely qualifying for the World Cup by the skin of our teeth a success, that's like Chelsea's coach calling not getting relegated a success, we're past that as a program, we're in CONCACAF not UEFA.

2898,"I'm just going to copy/paste [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/3kalqq/rantthe_case_of_the_ignorant_usmnt_fanbase/cuw67al) from a thread six months ago because it still summarizes the frustration better than anything I've seen since.

Here's the problems with JK-

1. He has no real reputation for success as a manager/coach. That's great he won the World Cup as a player in a team sport. Means nothing for coaching. His so-called ""success"" as the German national team coach can be and has been easily attributed to his assistant at the time-- you know, the guy who actually won the World Cup as a coach, Low-- and a German youth development program that had already started without his involvement. He failed miserably at Bayern and was sacked in less than a year. Phillip Lahm details in his autobiography JK's lack of tactical acumen and emphasis instead on overtraining and empty motivational speeches. The players lost respect for him and were forced to come up with tactics on their own. This reputation has carried over to his time with the U.S. (One example: rash of hamstring injuries pre- and during WC 2014), and there was a near player mutiny in 2013 after a horrible WC qualifying loss against Honduras, detailed in an excellent Sporting News article.

2. He still has yet to show he understands or even respects the players in the U.S. pool. Constantly plays guys out of position, plays guys who are riding the bench or out of form for their club teams as long as they're playing in Europe or Mexico and not the shitty shitty MLS, and his only solution is converting mediocre German American players to the U.S., which has created a divided locker room.

3. He comes with promises to improve results and importantly, improve play style. When it becomes obvious he can do neither, he then proceeds constantly to blame everything under the sun but himself-- oh, if only the U.S. had promotion/relegation, if only the players were fitter (which previously was the one thing the U.S. was universally recognized for, all of a sudden it's a problem), if the refs didnt make bad calls we would have beaten the mighty JAMAICA. The best is just recently when in the tournament the U.S. should win, the Gold Cup, the team crashes out in a pathetic 4th place and he claims that anyone criticizing him doesn't understand soccer. Kinda like OP is doing now, along with the corollary that somehow if you know the sport, you must support him?

4.Puts his petty personal grievances above the team's performance-- see Landon Donovan, and also recently, Matt Besler.

Basically all the JK apologists always cling to

-- oh it's ok to fuck about in friendlies, what matters is real competition...I'll just ignore that the U.S. had a complete disaster of a Gold Cup. Instead look how they did against Germany and holland.... in friendlies....

-- he's trying to change the way we play. Results aren't important now!... Except that we still play the same bunker counter style as before,.....

--- he doesn't have the talent available to improve!......Except that he knew what the situation was when he came in, and was hired to do the job, not just make excuses and fantasize about a mythical future where we field an all German American squad. And for reasons that have everything to do with excuse-making for his own coaching failures, he continues to disparage and undermine the domestic league that is the best hope for developing young American players.

-- he's German! A real European! He must know what's best for us!.... Except the two American coaches before him that OP mocks have produced objectively better results. Arena takes the team to QF of the World Cup in 2002 and deserved to go through to the semifinal. And Bradley beat 2009 Spain in an actual competitive match, not a friendly. [side note: does OP really want to compare Bruce Arena's coaching credentials with JK? Sorry but you'll lose on that one. It could be argued Bradley has achieved more as well.]

It's been 4 years. JK needs to be held accountable at some point, even if US soccer (the cowardly Sunil Gulati) won't do it (what other country gives a coach a contract extension BEFORE a World Cup?). I don't know what planet OP is on but the performance in Brazil wasn't great. Dominated by Ghana, lucky to beat a team that itself was in mutiny against its FA, played decent against a horrible Portugal side but still contrived to concede a draw, and lost handily to a Germany team who played with the handbrake on in the last group match. Then a bad performance against Belgium masked by a career day from Howard, and still salvageable but choked away by a horrible miss by Wondo, who JK picked over Donovan.

My question to all the JK apologists is, is there any possible scenario that can occur where you would concede that JK has failed and should be sacked? He constantly makes statements in the media in a ploy to lower the bar of success for his tenure. Why is this allowed? Because the U.S. is so inferior as a footballing nation? If the U.S. is, then they need a better coach.

I challenge ANYONE in this thread who actually watches US games to specifically defend his player selection and tactics, instead of just spouting vague nonsense and hurling insults at people who dare criticize Klinsmann.",2016-03-24 19:43:08+00:00,d1c65g1,2.0,t1_d1bw9m0,13047.0,MLS

2926,"&gt;It is a gradual process from other chemical interactions into repetitive cycles.

....that's not how chemistry works. I don't even think you're clear on what a life form is. Normal chemical reactions don't self-perpetuate, it uses up reactants until it reaches an equilibrium and then stop. Like I said, the most basic requirement for molecules that will become life eventually is self-replication. It doesn't matter how many ingredients you have floating around. Having flour, eggs, and milk in close proximity isn't going to make them turn themselves into a cake. ""Organic molecules"" simply means that there's carbon it in, it isn't specific to life and has nothing to do with self replication. One chemical reaction doesn't ""gradually"" turn into another, that's like saying gravity gradually turns into electromagnetism. The first time a self-replicating molecule ever formed it was indeed spontaneous.

&gt; It isn't like a free floating carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms just happen to come together in exactly the right shape to sudden start life as we recognize it.

I'm not talking about the formation of life as we know it, I'm not even talking about the formation of actual life forms. I'm talking about [protobionts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocell), the most basic compounds possible that are still capable of self-replicating. But they're still so complex that even assuming perfect conditions, the odds of their formation are still [1 in 2 x 10^-65](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022519377900443)

&gt;And life doesn't violate thermodynamics anymore than fire does, there is still entropy.

The *formation of life* isn't even remotely like fire. One increases entropy in a system, the other decreases it. It's physically possible to decrease the entropy of a system by increasing the entropy of the surroundings, but that basically doesn't happen in nature. I can decrease the entropy of my desk by organizing this mess of papers into a neat stack, and that doesn't violate the 2nd law because I gave off heat which increased the entropy of the overall universe, but I still had to *choose* to do that. They're not going to suddenly stack themselves.

Even assuming a planet is exactly like early Earth, with its primordial soup with all the ingredients of life, the odds of the spontaneous formation of molecules complex enough for self-replication are 1 in 2 x 10^-65.

Sure you can find lots of countries where baseball technically *exists* in the sense that there are clubs playing it, but there are Australian football clubs in the USA, so that's a pretty thin requirement. If no one besides the actual players care about the game and it's just a weekend hobby, you can't really claim the country has a ""baseball culture."" With that in mind,

**Tier 1**: Countries where baseball is a ""major"" sport. If you tried to chat someone up in a bar about the local league, they won't act surprised that they have one. It doesn't have to be the most popular sport, but at least in the top 3 or something. 

Countries in this are USA, Canada, Mexico, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Puerto Rico, Cuba, DR, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Panama, Colombia

**Tier 2**: These countries have leagues with small crowds, no bigger than what you would see at Independent League baseball here, or even some high schools. The fanbase is there, but it's very niche and gets little to no national media exposure.

Countries include Italy, Netherlands, Germany, Australia, China, maybe Brazil, etc.

**Tier 3**: Countries have organized, stable leagues, but are completely amateur and rarely get spectators beyond friends of the players. It's not rare to know people who play it, but you're not going to buy a ticket. Like water polo or volleyball or rugby here. But they have a large enough player base that you see them at international competition.

Countries include Spain, France, Czech Republic, Philippines,  maybe Brazil, etc.

**Tier 4**: Everything else. Young players hoping to get into the sport are lucky to get 8 of their friends together to form a team. This is countries like Ireland, Greece, etc.

2947,"&gt;Does CPBL use a DH?

I read once that DH is used in all international leagues except Japan's Central League, so probably.

&gt;What is the post-season usually set up as?

3 of the 4 teams in the league make it to the postseason. Teams play two fifty-game half seasons. The two half-season winners are automatically the number one and two seeds; the one with the better full-season record gains an automatic berth into the best-of-seven Taiwan Series, played in a 2-3-2 format. The other team must play a best-of-five series against the team with the best full-season record but didn't win either half-season.

&gt;What is the average pay for a CPBL player?

For domestic players, not great. There's no player's union, no free agency. [According to wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Professional_Baseball_League#Foreign_players), foreign players typically get paid 5,000-12,000 USD a month, and there's a limit of four foreign players per roster. The CPBL doesn't have much appeal for foreign players compared to KBO or NPB and Taiwan has fallen behind those leagues.

&gt;Any interesting things that happen at the stadiums tha tyou know of?

[Well they certainly have interesting first pitch ceremonies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-I6fnyb3Eg). CPBL, and Asian leagues in general, really try to push a lighthearted party atmosphere. Bangsticks are really popular. The stadium atmosphere can be great....when people actually show up. The stands are extremely empty in the middle stretch of the season, I assume because watching just 4 teams play each other gets old. And it will probably get worse when the next game fixing scandal inevitably happens.

2979,"&gt;That makes pro/rel a zero sum game when it comes to the growth of rugby as a sport.

That's exactly my point. Any drop in interest caused by a relegation would be mirrored by a rise in interest caused by a promotion. But 6N fans don't act like it's a zero sum game. They only see the possibility of fair weather Scotland fans losing interest which would apparently kill the sport across Europe. Scotland and Italy don't inherently deserve to be propped up more than other countries

There's an extreme hypocrisy and lack of self-awareness from 6N fans. Yes, it *would* suck to not be in the top division, it *would* suck for all your games to be meaningless blowouts, it *would* suck for interest and resources to dwindle due to said games. That's what Georgia fans live with every year with no way out.

That logic only works if you don't actually watch the game and just look at the standings afterwards. But that doesn't make sense either, because

2) if it's only the end result that matters, you don't want the end result to be tainted because the game was decided by a bullshit 50/50 coin flip like a shootout.

3) ......do you actually know how ties work? ""It's as if the teams didn't even play?"" How the fuck does that make sense? The game isn't erased from the record or something, you get less table points than if you won, but more than if you lost, and sometimes that's exactly what a team deserves.

4) The fact that some other American sports leagues force out ties doesn't automatically mean it makes sense. Everyone thinks the NFL overtime rules are bullshit, soccer has ties all the time and no one thinks that means the game never happened, and tons of other baseball and basketball leagues allow for ties.

.....says who? Generic and boring certainly isn't what I want in a crest. Tons of countries incorporate balls to communicate what the hell the logo is for, I don't get where you're getting this idea that the old US logo was unique in that way.

I also don't get your idea that you're not allowed to communicate what sport you're talking about, instead of just having the logo for the US national team in......something.

3305,"I made [my own post](https://www.reddit.com/r/shield/comments/3p2qqn/spoiler_s3e2_why_i_think_changing_skyes_name_to/) a few months ago about how where Skye's character suddenly is at the start of the 3rd season doesn't make sense.

Skye's character progression is a great example of why listening to the fans on everything isn't a good idea. Her whole arc is very fanservicy, which is a real shame because one of the things I applauded the show for in the 1st season was how it had the guts to *not* be fanservicy, to be its own thing and force in references to the comics.

You can see this all over Reddit. Comic book fans think that accuracy trumps everything. If it was in the comics, then it's good. Look how many people have been hyped about Civil War for *years* now even though there were a *lot* of things about that arc that didn't work.

Why did Skye become Daisy? Because that's who she is in the comics. That's the only reason. People say that Skye was a Mary Sue in the first season but has gotten better. I honestly have no idea how people can think that. It's completely the opposite. When was the last time you say Skaisy *struggle* with something? She's instantly super awesome at everything she does, her superpowers make her more Mary Sue-y than ever.

3340,"I don't know if Agent Carter is the *worst* thing the MCU has produced, but it is hands down the laziest. You can tell the writers and network just aren't trying as hard because they don't care about it as much as Agents of SHIELD, and that should really tell you something considering how little Marvel cares about AoS compared to the movies. It's filled with stock characters and stock plotlines.

I'm watching it just out of obligation until Agents comes back, but guess what the big plot device is? Evil Black Goo^TM ! This is literally the 4th time Evil Black Goo^TM has appeared as a convenient mcguffin in the marvel universe (Gravitonium, Aether, monolith). The villains in both seasons have been secret societies that technically have their own names, but I just call NotHydra.

But let's get to the real issue with the show: the characters. This show is filled with a cast of talented, charming, and charismatic actors, and God bless them they are doing their best to salvage some personality from these slices of white bread in their scripts.

 Peggy is a Mary Sue. There's no way around it, she's one of the biggest Mary Sues I've ever seen. She's good at everything, she has no problems, no weaknesses, she's smarter and stronger than everyone around her. Her only moments of vulnerability is when she acts heartbroken over now *three* guys and counting that she had a few minor flirty moments with, and then acts like he was the love of her life. 

And the side characters are even worse. All of Peggy's male coworkers are 2-dimensional cardboard cutouts for our Strong Independent Woman^TM to put in their place, with the exception of one Nice Guy^TM for Tumblr to swoon over. For God's sake, he's LITERALLY damaged. They might as well drape a sign over him saying ""you can fix me."" But what makes all the strawmen all the more frustrating is that lots of the time, [they're right](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanHasAPoint)! The only reason she never considers Howard as a suspect *is* because of her prior relationship with him. She *did* have a schoolgirl crush on Cap that she got so offended about. She *does* stupidly hide her entire investigation from the SSR as if that would help anything.

Not to mention that her allowing herself to get marginalized to the role of secretary by this room full of strawmen doesn't even make sense from a continuity standpoint. We already saw her being taken completely seriously in The First Avenger, so the fact that she just kind of rolls over confusing. Yeah there were obstacles for professional women in the 40s, but *we know* that this character is capable of overcoming them. Watching the first episode of Agent Carter is like watching an Olympic swimmer suddenly drown for some reason.

Remember the worst episode of Agents of SHIELD, ""Yes Men?"" Literally every episode of the 1st season is like that. It thinks that it's super duper feminist but is actually incredibly sexist. The show jerks itself off over what a Strong Independent Woman^TM Peggy is even though she's a laundry list of negative female stereotypes. She falls into serious romances at the drop of a hat, she's passive-aggressive instead of speaking her mind (they let her go on a mission as soon as she *tells* them ""I'm going on a mission"", it was that easy the whole time?), she refuses to admit when she's wrong, when she's caught in something she tries to turn it around into ""you know, this is really you're fault,"" she's *extremely* over emotional (threatening to murder a guy with a fork because he was kind of a dick to his waiter, for example), and she never approaches a situation with logic and reason over her feelings. The only reason everything works out for her is because the writers say so. And none of this would be bad, and would actually make for an interesting character *if it was intentional.* But I haven't gotten that feeling from the show.

Because that's the thing. This show *isn't* feminist. It's fem-sploitation. The only reason every TV critic applauds Carter as a ""strong"" female character is because she can somehow *physically* beat up a room full of highly trained men. Because sure young girls fantasize about being a productive and respected member of society, but more than that they fantasize about punching mean boys in the face.

And don't get me wrong, there's nothing *wrong* with fantasizing about punching mean boys in the face. There's nothing wrong with wish fulfillment. There's nothing wrong with blatant, shameless pandering. I've seen all the *Fast and Furious* movies and it sure as fuck wasn't because they stimulated my intellect. Lord knows comic books have been pandering to young boys for long enough, it's about damn time girls got some delicious cinematic junkfood. I'm just explaining why *I* don't really like the show. I don't hold someone liking the show against them, I just wish the internet critics would dial it back a bit and not take it so seriously as some kind of revolutionary feminist artwork.",2016-02-25 05:38:57+00:00,d0cypxq,1.0,t3_47erqi,32100.0,shield

He's not *making* it his moment in the spotlight, it *is* his moment in the spotlight. Yeah baseball's a team sport but that doesn't change the fact that that was his personal moment of glory. Pitchers act like baseball is an individual sport all the time, I don't get this attitude that batters need to be ""good soldiers"" and just fall back into ranks.

I'm not saying batflips are required to have fun, I'm saying your entire attitude puts fun in the backseat, and you seem to have this really *specific* hangup about batflips more than anything else that isn't logical or consistent.",2016-02-17 22:58:41+00:00,d03su0w,10.0,t1_d03sf1y,615.0,baseball

Then you'll never know how thrilling it was to see Aragorn jump off the corsair ship for the first time in the theater, or how chilling the introduction of Denethor's character in ROTK was.

Don't get me wrong, I have all three EEs. I watch them more often. Most of the scenes add a new level of enjoyment for fans. In fact, I'd say the EEs of FOTR and TTT are better than the theatricals.

Like what? The lower 6N would occasionally send an A team to the IRB Nations Cup (which doesn't even include the top ENC teams) and and they've stopped doing that recently.  6N teams have played ENC teams exactly *once* in the last 5 years.

This entire line of thinking basically amounts to ""we'll get to it, okay?"" At what point is the player base ""ensured"" and how does continuing to double down in promoting the game in a handful of countries help the game outside said countries? The NFL opening training facilities in the US isn't going to grow football in Mexico. You've got this whole thing backwards. Growing the game isn't the same thing as spreading the game.

Rugby is never going to be the most popular sport in any of the 6N.

Everyone's always acting like a country getting relegated would happen in a vacuum.

And there's no reason to just assume Ireland's, England's, and the others' home crowds will just magically vanish for a game vs Georgia instead of vs Italy other than claiming they have the most fickle fans in the world.

The position of fans in the 6N is one of hypocrisy. Everyone laments about how tragic it would be for the game in one of the lower countries in the 6N to get relegated, without realizing that that's how it is in Georgia *all the time.* Yes, it *would* suck to be doomed to a lower tier for two years, it *would* suck to have to spend most of your games stomping tiny nations by double digits. It *would* suck to have attendance, profits, developmental resources, and interest in the sport decline due to the meaninglessness of said games. If you don't want that to happen to you, *play better,* and you'll still have the hope of getting promoted again. The attitude of the 6N is defeatist, it has no ambition. It's admitting that rugby will never have a presence in Europe outside their own club. 

They should recognize that the sport getting out of its niche is good *for them.* It's the top teams that benefit from the popularity of a sport. Do you know how much money the NBA makes from foreign contracts due to the global popularity of basketball? A fucking shit ton. A tiny fraction of all Real Madrid fans live in Spain.

There's also the pitching rotation to consider. If the best starting pitcher isn't available for the final, people are going to be second guessing the result.

So the WBC isn't going to be taken very seriously until either A) each round involves two teams playing each other multiple times, or B) there's a several day break in between each game for the pitcher to recover, both of which take too long to be squeezed into the MLB offseason. Basically, international baseball will never get huge until international windows become a thing, like they are in soccer, which will never happen.

3705,"&gt;I'm fairly sure the game is balanced so that you can start from lv. 1 and do a full play through to the end of Overtime without it becoming unplayable.

Anyone who has played this game knows that's not true. This game's difficulty curve almost necessitates grinding the first part over and over for experience. The only way to level up enough to complete both the main game and overtime in one playthrough is to complete *all* the side missions, rescue *all* the survivors, defeat *all* the psychopaths, and capture *all* the photo ops. If you dick around at all that playthrough is doomed, which is kind of bullshit since dicking around is the game's entire selling point.

And even then, a lot of it depends on the luck of the draw when leveling up. The grumps got fucked by the RNG.

3724,"You think *you're* a bad rugby fan? I'll list my qualities so you feel better about yourself.

* I don't really root for a team in any of the professional leagues, because I can only root for local teams. I can't get into sports without being spoonfed a reason based on geography.

* I'm pretty sure I will always hate whoever is in charge. Whoever's the CEO of USAR, whoever's the head coach, I have such a problem with authority that my brain will always hate any decision. John Mitchell hasn't coached a single game yet and I already hate his stupid Agent 47 face.

* When a ref's call is questionable and goes to the favored team, I will *always* assume it's because of a conspiracy against lower tier teams.

* I hate this ""remember that the refs are human"" attitude. It's way more fun to use creative vocabulary to describe in detail what a mouth-breathing malicious asshole they are whenever any call goes against my team.

* I like sevens a lot more than 15s. I find everything the forwards do so boring that I think the game is improved by taking them out of the picture entirely.

* I'm all for all of the crazy law experiments they're doing in different leagues. Too many games devolve into kicking duels.

* I don't really give a shit about tradition in general, which is apparently heresy for this sport's fanbase.

* I go into every single game expecting us to lose and am always harsh on all our guys even though most of them are amateurs who do this just because they love the game and I could barely make it off the bench in my DIII college team.

* I have absolutely no problem with a crowd booing whatsoever. Hell, if you wanna go full Mexican and yell PUTOOOOOOOOOO during the opposition's penalty kicks, go nuts, getting into the opposition's head is a crowd's job. Just don't start throwing garbage, never go *that* Mexican.

* I honestly don't get what the big deal is about Nigel Owens. He tries way too hard to be funny, and the occassional modestly witty quip on the field or post on Twitter doesn't make up for the fact that his first priority during a game is to give it a play style that *he* likes. He makes the game about him, which a ref should never do.

See? You're not so bad.

That title is usually reserved for scifi, but think about it.

Rohan and Gondor barely survived it. IIRC, the plague is talked about in the appendices but not even mentioned in the main text.

You could say that this is a major oversight on Tolkien's part.

&gt;hard for a neutral to follow as it's not team1vteam2 , team3vteam4

.....I have literally no idea what this phrase is supposed to mean. How do conferences make it harder for neutrals to follow?

4066,"&gt;TIL that England, France, Italy, Germany and Spain are all small countries with only minor domestic tournaments such as the Premier League, Ligue 1, Serie A, Bundesliga and La Liga.

......yes, they are. All of those countries exist in a single time zone and you can drive from one end to the other in a few hours. What classifies a big country is if it's *big*, genius.

Your die-hard devotion to a round robin table is still a complete dead-end, conferences were necessary with 15 teams and it's even more necessary now. The Six Nations and TRC have *six* and *four* teams respectively, not *eighteen.* You can't pretend that it's the same thing. And the PNC *doesn't* have an even schedule, it uses groups and a playoff.

The time zone thing has been an issue since the tournament's inception, even back when it was your precious round robin. Japan doesn't add another time zone and the Jaguars are just one more team in one more time zone. Again, conferences are necessary when you have both a large number of teams and large geographical distances.

&gt;Sure, that's why in every expansion except the short-lived Super 15, the SARU has bagged an extra franchise and kicked, screamed and even colluded against their own franchises to force a civil suit that the Kings must play in Super Rugby.

In the S15, South Africa had the same number of teams as NZ and AUS. It's greedy to have equal representation in the league? SA's pushing for the King's because even though SA is a traditional rugby power, it's still a minority sport with specific geographical concentrations and racial stigmas, that they're trying to get rid of. The entire point of every expansion has been to grow the sport, NZ is literally the only place where rugby is the dominant sport.

&gt;That is what will create a heavily unbalanced schedule where a single round robin is the minimum requirement to create a fair tournament.

*No it's not.* That's just one of many ways. Why are you acting like conferences are these super rare things in sports? You go to the playoffs by winning your conference. If you're not the best in your conference, you're not the best in the league. Now, you can be the best in a weak conference, then you have to prove yourself in the playoffs against the winner of the stronger conference. Two teams are going into the NFL playoffs with a 9-7 record. That's just how it is. They still have to beat the teams that are 16-0.",2016-01-08 03:39:42+00:00,cyq7idj,5.0,t1_cyq5ace,3833.0,rugbyunion

The fact that the source is from 1977 has nothing to do with anything. Einstein's theory of relativity is from the 30s it doesn't mean that it's wrong.

Of course there's the fact that it all revolves around Death Star 3.0, that's blown up with an extremely convenient design flaw after flying down a trench, getting a droid with a macguffin to the ~~Rebellion~~ Resistance, being convinced the bad guy still has good in him, and a bunch of other recycled stuff. This movie has no new ideas with regards to plot.

It's also kind of cheap that Rey instantly masters the Force and makes her seem a little Mary Sue. Even Anakin couldn't suddenly Force persuade people and defeat sith with no training whatsoever, and he was literally Space Jesus

The dialogue is also a little heavy on quips. I could have sworn I was watching an episode of a Whedon show. Some humor thrown in here and there is great, and if you just pile it on with no moderation it starts to get annoying, and it feels like no one's taking the situation seriously, so why should we? Age of Ultron had this problem.

The saber battle also seemed.....kind of lackluster from what we're used to. There's none of the Wu-Tang style fast combat there was in the prequels, they mostly look like they're swinging baseball bats. Which makes sense for Finn, but not a trained sith prodigy. It just seemed like they made the saber battle slower because.....that's how it was in the originals. We're not allowed to be *anything* like the prequels, even the things they did well.

This is a movie defined by what it's not. It set out to *not* be the prequels and placate the fanbase by giving them exactly what they've gotten before, but has little ambition beyond that.

And I don't get why people act like that change would happen in a vacuum. There's just as likely to be a *rise* in interest and exposure in countries that get promoted. That's the entire point: you can either be happy with rugby being played where it is and just focus on always making those fans happy, or you can take a risk in order to grow the sport's fanbase long-term. Georgia regularly sells out their ENC home matchs, and that's for boring blowouts against far weaker teams. There would definitely be an increase in profitability if they earned their way into the top division. I'm not even saying there should be automatic relegation, a playoff would be better, just don't have an institutional glass ceiling.

And it's true that the 6N is run by those unions themselves, but it's not like WR are completely powerless to put pressure on them.

&gt;Over time it forms a pattern.

&gt;Even over the course of one season of Digimon

&gt;If you think about it a season is 24 episodes, 22 minutes per episode, that's 8.8 hours

&gt;If you didn't speak Spanish but spent 9 hours observing someone

You notice a pattern here? You don't start to pick up on this stuff and form these rough translations in your head until *after* watching it for hours and hours. That doesn't help someone putting on the first episode for the first time. Sure I might pick up enough by the 3rd season so that the voice actor's delivery is no longer lost but that doesn't change the fact that my enjoyment of those first 2 seasons was less because I hadn't gotten to that point. It turns watching TV into a vocabulary memorization excercise.

&gt;there's no reason to think that subtitles lose more in translation hat localizing it (translating and writing a new version of the script, yes that' show it works even if they are as accurate as possible. The fact that they don't have the original voices accompanying it is what deviates it from what is intended much father than necessary)

But here's the thing: you have no reason to care how much the English version deviates from the Japanese version unless you've *already seen* the Japanese version. I don't care how closely a movie follows the book it's based on if I've never read the book, I just care if the movie is good. I don't care how close to the original Japanese a dub is, I just care if it's good on its own. Being closer to the original doesn't automatically make something better, scripts go through a million drafts and rewrites anyway. For instance I don't like Dragonball Z Kai because it made Goku an unlikable asshole. Yeah I know it's closer to the original Japanese, but that doesn't make it any more enjoyable to watch.",2015-12-21 05:10:04+00:00,cy6aksf,13.0,t1_cy69sg6,1645.0,digimon

Matt Damon has been in a million movies but nobody said that took them out of The Martian. Not to mention how I know for a fact that Japanese studios recycle Japanese voice actors out the ass too.

Yeah, I'm sure the Japanese actors are probably better *if you can understand them* since they were originally chosen for the character, but the entire point of acting is *communicating* with the audience, so there's only so much an actor can do when they're limited to, for all intents and purposes, gibberish. Again, it's not much more than whether the character is happy, angry, or sad.

But it plays it very, *very* safe. It gives you exactly what you expect going in and not much else. There are *zero* surprises in this movie. A good movie gives an audience exactly what they want, a great movie gives an audience something they never knew they wanted.

There's literally a checklist of recycled stuff from the originals that start off endearing, but end up being tiresome by the credits.

We've got the cute beeping robot who's given a macguffin on ~~Tatooine~~ Jakku that's vital to the ~~Rebellion~~ Resistance, and is then found by a mechanically savvy and skilled pilot Force user.

We've got the guy with the deep voice in a mask who reports to an ~~Emperor~~ Supreme Leader

We've got the big reveal that multiple characters are related to each other (because Ray is totally somebody's daughter).

We've got the whole ""There's still good in him!"" dialogue.

And, of course, we've got a *THIRD. FUCKING. DEATH STAR.* That is again taken out by an extremely convenient design flaw. Where the hell are they getting these things

I feel like a just watched a remake, not a sequel. It's basically a New Hope just with lots of the names changed. I think it's weird that when the prequels rather conveniently bring all the characters from the original together again, people call it forced and contrived, but people like it here. My favorite part of the movie by far is the beginning when it's just Fin and Ray. I didn't see any of Han Solo here, I saw Harrison Ford in his old costume. But I can't say I'm angry with him about that, Harrison Ford ran out of fucks to give some time in the Clinton administration, everybody knows that.

Going into this movie, I had this fear that this would be a movie defined by what it's *not.* That it's only goal would be to *not* be the prequels, but not have much direction or ambition beyond that. And I think that's true to an extent. There thankfully wasn't the wink-wink-nudge-nudge ""subtle"" jabs at the prequels like I was afraid there would be, but it did seem like they were afraid of angering the nastier portion of this fanbase. You know, the crowd that sent hate mail to a 10 year old. Say what you want about the prequels, but at least they had the ambition to try to tell a bigger, grander story than a ragtag group of rebels blowing a big bad thing up yet again. So what's better, a different, ambitious story executed lukewarmly or a completely standard and recycled story executed perectly?

Edit: I also would have liked it if they addressed the fact that Anakin was prophecized to bring balance to the Force once and for all but the Dark Side and the Sith are just as around as ever. I wouldn't even have really cared if it was a *good* explanation, hell they could have just copied a few of the explanations this sub has come up with, I just would have liked them to acknowledge that the contradiction *exists.*",2015-12-18 07:43:46+00:00,cy374cw,1.0,t3_3x7y8a,60214.0,StarWars

4293,"&gt;Because the Asian Championship up to this point has been a full on test series, Japan not sending its full team unilaterally changes that.

So the other countries get to ignore their continental tournaments simply because they already do? You're saying that the rules should punish countries for not following the status quo instead of doing what actually makes a lick of sense. And again, you're *really* illogically hung up on whether these games are labeled as test matches. It's just a word that only matters with regards to WR's useless world rankings, which nobody takes seriously and the Asian Championship never changes anyway. Games against Japan's B side are better than no games against Japan at all.

&gt;Can we agree that is different, and probably against the wishes of the other participants invested in the tournament?

No, we can't. We really, really can't. It's not in the other Asian countries' best interest to always be humiliated and always be doomed to a tournament that they have no hope in winning. I don't get why you're so dead set against B sides of one country playing A sides of another. It's the perfect solution to the parity problem in rugby. Countries in the same level playing each other can only improve so much, but the gulf between levels is so huge that it results in equally unproductive blowouts. Higher countries using their B sides is a perfect way to meet halfway.

&gt;The Six Nations is ran by those six nations, not WR sponsored, it is the defacto European Championship nor the official one. 

Yes, it is the official one. Rugby Europe bills the Six Nations as the top level in Europe, because *of course they fucking do.* The ENC is a tournament for the lower European countries, and they have no way of playing the top teams on their continent or challenging their dominance. Georgia has become the indisputably best country in the ENC but they can't rise any higher because the Six Nations ignores the ENC. The ENC is *literally* what the Asian Championship would be if Japan quit on it completely. But the Six Nations shouldn't be fined because....World Rugby's name isn't on it? World Rugby doesn't organize the AC either, Asia Rugby does. And it wouldn't matter if they did, they're not breaking any of World Rugby's rules. You're literally making up a new standard for every continent. First it's test matches you're hung up on until you get to South Africa, then its their one domestic club in Namibia that matters, then when you get to Europe, which does neither, they're not required to do anything.

&gt;Now for an applicable example, if Romania wanted to use its u-20 side in the ENC I would also want them fined.

That isn't even *remotely* applicable. Romania can't even win the ENC, why the holy fuck would they send a U20 team to it? Even if they did decide to send U20 team for some crazy reason, they would lose but there's no logical reason why they should be fined. Please attempt to have at least some consistency, the only thing consistent about your rules for all the different continents is that countries should be fined for not doing what they've done in the past and Tier 1 countries get to do whatever they want.",2015-12-18 01:04:14+00:00,cy2vywg,24.0,t1_cy2uh6c,2763.0,rugbyunion

&gt;but my original point remains; sending a second XV into a championship diminishes it.

No, your original point was that Japan should be fined if they send their B team to the Asian Championship, even though the USA isn't fined for sending the USA South to NACRA, the Six Nations aren't fined for not having pro/rel with the ENC, and South Africa isn't fined for never playing test matches with the rest of Africa *ever.* It's a completely new rule you decided to apply to Japan and only Japan.

If anything my logic says Tier 1 nations have no reason to *want* to play Tier 2 nations, and *that's the truth.* They rarely bother to play Tier 2 nations and WR doesn't fine them when they don't. Japan *are* playing their Asian neighbors, I don't get how you're missing that. They *are* growing the sport in their region by sending a team that is a challenge, but not completely unbeatable.

You can't compare a tournament like this to the World Cup. The entire point of a *World* Cup is to bring together the *world's* rugby, which means the best teams from each continent. The only reason Japan hasn't done this before is because the Asian Championship doubled as the World Cup qualifier. It had repercussions outside of its own tournament so Japan went as a formality to get to the World Cup. Now that they don't have to worry about that the goal is to make *the competition itself* better. As of now, the entire competition is a lame duck.

4303,"&gt;They have a tour of Scotland in June

So? Again, the PNC was in July this year. Fiji and Samoa had internationals a lot closer to the PNC this year than Japan will next year.

&gt;the fixtures for the PNC aren't our yet

They weren't out by this time last year either. It's only December dude, the fixtures for 2015 weren't announced until late February

&gt;and World Rugby is funding yhe equally expensive ARC this year.

By all accounts the Americas unions are funding it themselves. If WR are chipping in anything, I seriously doubt it's enough to put a dent in their budget. They have a lot of money.

&gt;All of that tends to indicated the PNC is done,

No it doesn't. It doesn't even remotely indicate that. You're making incredibly wild assumptions here.

&gt;However their still giving the tournament team full test status.

That is literally just a word. Everyone knows that the team Argentina sends to the CONSUR Cup is a developmental team in everything but name. And with Super Rugby starting next year they might just call it the Argentina XV. Whether or not its technically called a test match is just semantics. I know test matches are the only ones that affect world rankings, but that would only matter if the other Asian teams actually had a chance of beating Japan's first side.

&gt;Again, it's not that Japan doesn't want to play it, that's fine, it's more the sending a u 20 team.

4332,"&gt;Sooo many great players have come through the sevens system at a young age to get noticed and have gone on to be superstars in 15's, without looking/turning back to sevens.

Again, *because there's more money.* Sevens isn't part of the international calendar, so once they land a professional 15s contract, they're booked. In countries where both sevens and fifteens are all amateur, like North America, players go back to sevens all the time, because they're better at it or like it more. I'm not saying that not 15s players are good at 7s (they're called backs, what sevens basically is is rugby without the forwards), I'm saying that it's just as often not the case.

&gt;if Ireland beat the All Blacks can you imagine the excitement? But if the same hing happened in Sevens there's hardly going to be a party.

Stop. Thinking. That. You. Are. Everyone. There would definitely be a party among *sevens fans*. It definitely made big news in the American and Canadian rugby communities the first time they each beat the All Blacks, you bet your ass the entire country of Fiji cares about the Fiji sevens team. It wouldn't be as big of news in Ireland because Ireland doesn't really care about sevens, but that doesn't mean *no one* does. Ireland is a perfect illustration of my point. If sevens was just an uglier version of 15s then no Irish team would have any trouble beating freakin' *Russia,* but they didn't.

&gt;Having it a lottery where anyone can win takes a lot out of it

Are you not listening? The fact that upsets occasionally happen and there's more countries that are good at it *does not make it a lottery.* If Ireland were to beat New Zealand, it's not because Ireland got lucky, it's because Ireland *played better.* That is by definition, not a lottery. You're acting like anyone can beat anyone all the time, that it's a coin flip when Portugal plays Fiji. What little luck there is is eliminated by the fact that no one ever plays *one* sevens game, it's always a whole tournament over two days. Sevens players play just as much rugby as 15s players, they just do it spread over a full day because they spend the whole time *actually doing stuff.* And then doing it all again the next day.

&gt;Isles came onto the scene with jack all rugby experience yet still made it to his national squad. Why? Because he was fast.

Okay, that's one player, and also one player who *sucked for years* and just recently got up to the first string, because he finally got the skills to back it up. He got recruited because of his *potential,* and has been coached well. Being able to get onto the Eagles isn't exactly a huge achievement. We only recently escaped the bottom third of the table and are still a completely amateur operation relying on players who want to play so bad that they're willing to move across the country to train for free.

&gt;Set piece in sevens is an absolute joke. You can hardly call it set piece because of how messy it is.

Yes, set pieces don't matter as much in sevens, *that's part of what makes it require a different skillset.* Instead it's much more about the flow of open play. But whether that's a good or bad thing is completely a matter of opinion. Not everyone wants to watch a game that's nothing but scrums and lineouts.

&gt;If its happening then, why is there hardly anything in r/rugbyunion?

....are....you have blinders on so hard it's honestly confusing. Have you not been on the sub at all in the last 2 weeks?

&gt;Sevens is a far inferior product to 15's. No need to get upset.

Don't act like an expert when you clearly don't know a single fucking thing about it. 

&gt;It's is a lottery

The fact that upsets happen doesn't mean that it's a lottery, it means more countries are good at it. Seeing this attitude really isn't surprising considering how New Zealanders desperately look for an excuse whenever the all blacks lose. When a sevens team wins, it's because they *played better* for those 14 minutes, and if they place well in a tournament, that means they played better *all weekend.*

&gt;you can be good just by being fast

Have you ever actually played or watched a single sevens game? Sevens is about creativity, tackling, and perfect long passes. Of course athletic ability is important *because it's a fucking sport, Einstein* but how do you explain Fiji dominating sevens despite having none of the top speedsters? It's a hell of a lot easier to claim you can be good at 15s just by being big than being good at 7s just by being fast. It's still wrong, but you can make the case a lot easier.

&gt;lineouts/scrums/rucks are a joke

Just because they're faster doesn't mean they're a joke. All of the skills of the breakdown are still necessary, in fact it's more necessary because turnovers happen so much more in sevens. Making the scrum get over with faster is the exact opposite of a problem, as I already described.

&gt;If there is a real demand for sevens why do we hear jack all about it? Why is no one talking about it?

Just because *you* don't talk about it or join conversations about it doesn't mean it doesn't happen. Again, don't try to act like you represent everyone.

&gt;Many players use sevens as a way to get noticed and break into 15's

And many players don't. Some players do that because there's more *money* in 15s. If money = quality, then NRL is a lot better than union. Hell, by that logic, the NFL is the greatest sport in the world.

There's tons of reasons for people to care about sevens, sometimes more than 15s in fact. I like sevens a lot more than 15s. The international scene isn't dominated by one team, upsets happen more often than once a decade, no games devolving into boring kicking duels, no watching forwards pick and crash for 20 straight minutes, no waiting 5 minutes on a single scrum getting reset over and over, no games being decided by the ref flipping a coin to decide whose fault it is that the scrum wheeled, no bullshit mauls that the flawed rules make inherently overpowered, I could go on.

4371,"&gt;In their defence, the comment is usually in response to some american football fans skiting about how their sport is the toughest.

Not really. The only way some rugby fans can enjoy themselves is by dumping on other sports, and interjecting themselves into conversations that have nothing to do with them. You start a conversation about football, soccer, or league with a rugby fan in the room and you bet they'll start a pissing contest. The top comment on pretty much any YouTube video relating to football is about how football is apparently just a pansy version of rugby. Which, ironically enough, turns people off from trying it and prevents the spread of the sport they love so much.

&gt;And furthermore, the social justice movement is like the war on terror; there are no victory conditions. You can never truly eliminate racism because there will always be shitty people. You can never truly eliminate hate, because there will always be hateful people. What you can do is treat others as you would want them to treat you, with respect and good actions. Its up to them to reciprocate that, not you to enforce it.

And now we come to the most juvenile mentality yet: the idea that if you can't *win* at something, it's not worth doing. Of course there will always be shitty people, Einstein, that's why there's always going to be murder. Rape. Child Abuse. But that doesn't mean we don't fight tooth and nail to eradicate things like them and proactively trying to *prevent* them by addressing systemic issues that create environments where they flourish, not just punishing the individuals after the fact. That mentality doesn't improve the long term health of your community. Throwing up your hands and giving up when you realize there will always be problems in the world no matter how much you try to improve it isn't cool. It isn't intelligence. It isn't maturity. It's pettiness. It treats societal issues as something to ""win"" or ""lose"" so you can brag about it instead of an opportunity to improve people's lives and make the world suck just a little less.

You say that racism is caused by individuals, not society. But society is *made up* of individuals, some individuals will always have more than others due to the circumstances of their birth, and most importantly, a few select *individuals* control how society at large works. And it's society at large that's completely okay with keeping prejudiced individuals in said positions of influence (Donald Fucking Trump is a legit presidential candidate) as long as they say those magical words, ""I'm not racist, but.""

You know that phrase ""the only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good people to do nothing?"" You notice it doesn't say that if you do nothing, you're *not* a good person. That's the entire point. Recognizing that institutional racism or sexism or homophobia or transphobia exists on a societal scale doesn't imply that *everyone* is racist or sexist or homophobic or transphobic any more than being against hateful SJWs implies that you're any of those things. [Stop drawing artificial battle lines](http://dilbert.com/strip/2015-06-07), and if you do, at least recognize how much of a Tumblrina you see when you look in the mirror.",2015-12-06 21:43:49+00:00,cxpimh5,5.0,t1_cxpilul,23.0,TumblrInAction
4385,"&gt;Name one socially accepted, socially encouraged form of discrimination and oppression that is proudly defined as normal by our current social standards.

*That's* your definition of something being a problem? All you're doing is listing off a laundry list of ways you're incapable of seeing beyond your own nose and experiences, and re-defined something so that you can use mental gymnastics to make yourself feel better, which is *exactly what makes Tumblrinas annoying.* They are you, you are them and you are all together. You're saying if we all agree something is bad, it magically doesn't happen? We all agree political corruption is bad. We all agree murder is bad. We all agree human trafficking is bad. But anyone not so far up their own ass that they can't see the light of day knows that it still happens.

&gt;Because it isn't racism.

Is that why blacks and hispanics are given longer sentences for the same crimes committed by whites, are shot more often by cops than whites in identical circumstances, are are still seen as being inferior to whites by the age and race demographic that still controls most of the money and power in this country?

&gt; It isn't transphobia.

Are...you can't be serious. Transexuals are *literally* the most stigmatized demographic in the country, probably the world. Most people don't want a transgendered person representing their company, or dealing with their customers, or running for office, or hanging out in their bar, or be seen with their group of friends. If you actually get off the internet once in a while you'd see how marginalized they are.

&gt;It isn't homophobia.

Seriously, either you have lived your entire life in a place like San Francisco or one specific neighborhood of New York, or you spend literally all of your time on the internet. Coming out as gay in most of the country means, at best, gossip behind your back and at worst parents banding together to have you kicked out of private school because you're a servant of the devil.

&gt; It isn't gender inequality.

Just because a woman got promoted over you one time and you think you deserved it more doesn't mean gender inequality doesn't exist. Cops not taking your rape as seriously because of a previous drug possession charge is gender inequality. Laws preventing access to birth control is gender inequality. Getting *freakin' acid thrown on your face because you wanted an education* is gender inequality. Again, look beyond your own little bubble.

Everyone *says* that they agree racism/sexism/homophobia is bad because *that's easy, Einstein.* All it takes is to look at something and say ""that's not racist/sexist/homophobic."" Literally no one has ever said ""it's okay to be racist"" for the same reason no one calls themselves the bad guy. Instead they say ""I'm not racist, *but* [insert something incredibly racist]."" 

&gt;And if there is something, it gets fixed. Gay rights? Gee, took some time, but there you go. It got fixed. Civil rights? Gee, it took some time, but it got fixed.

Okay, one, it gets fixed *because people do something about it*. They don't just sit on Reddit and say ""well, *I* don't oppress other people, why is everyone making such a big fuss about it?"" Two, do you have any idea how patronizing you're being right now? People are treated less because of what they are, and you say, ""Jesus, calm down, be patient, we're *working* on it okay?"" Third, you have the same juvenile mentality that Tumblrinas do that problems fall into two categories, ""Fixed,"" and ""Not Fixed."" The only difference is you put everything into the former while they put everything into the latter. You could have condescendingly told a black person in 1967 that racism was ""fixed."" After all, slavery was long gone, black people could vote, and even interracial marriage had been legalized. Don't be such a downer, bro.

&gt;If its lacking in some area, it is because of individuals, not society, who fail to meet the standards of what normal, civilized people should do.

Okay, Ayn Rand.

&gt;This is why Social Justice is a bad thing; it removes accountability from individuals who are responsible and blames society for the actions of those people. It assumes that if one is racist, all are racist. It assumes if one is homophobic, all are

No, that's the definition that *you've* put on it in order to make it wrong. We can check off strawman on the list of Tumblr cliches that you're banging out. Social justice is the effort to recognize that some demographics are more advantaged than others and to try to right that wrong. It's the overuse of calling things ""advantaged"" and the extreme lengths willing to go to to ""right the wrong"" that makes Tumblr the hateful and stupid cesspool that it is.

&gt;It doesn't mean we've eliminated racism, otherwise the KKK wouldn't be a thing. It doesn't mean we've eliminated trans/homophobia, because the WBC is still a thing. What it means is that we as a society recognize that there are shitty people out there and steps are taken to make those shitty people still have a voice, as is their right, but their platform and its ideals have no place in our society.

So because the loudest voices advocating the most extreme instances of a problem aren't publically endorsed, that institutional prejudices don't exist? Again, you're having the Tumblr black-and-white, good vs. bad mentality. Just because society doesn't collectively endorse groups who publicly advocate for *literal fucking genocide* doesn't mean that some groups of people are not at a disadvantage due to the nature and history of our society. Yes, we as a society condemn racism, but the only thing needed to get around that and justify things to yourself is to preface every sentence with ""I'm not racist, but...""

&gt;What's left are things like the BLM who convolute individual instances of racial discrimination and blow them out of proportion to fuel an agenda that amounts to nothing more than attention seeking and race baiting. These actions ultimately show that its the BLM themselves who are the racists.
Or the HAES movement, which claims that all bodies are beautiful, but only if you're fat and if you aren't attracted to fat women, then you are fatphobic and want them all to die. Any factual information that goes against the narrative is immediately dismissed as oppressive.
Or ""otherkin"" movement, which wants to legitimize mental disorders and simple social anxieties as being protected statuses in our world. These people want to legitimize delusional behavior as ""normal"".

Please, please *please* get off the internet once in a while. Literally every beef you have with the idea of social justice is actually with how social justice is attempted *on the internet.* Of course *internet* Social Justice isn't helpful to anyone, because the internet (and its older brother, cable news) is where all good ideas and all redeeming qualities of humanity go to die. It's populated by the most privileged people from all demographics who have nothing better to do than sit on the internet, so that becomes their only exposure to the world outside their bubble. BLM was a hashtag to bring attention to how black people are in inherently more danger from police and how violence against blacks is treated as unfortunate, but business as usual. The fat acceptance movement is about how ridiculous the media's standard of beauty is and how your cholesterol being high doesn't mean you're less than human--which, by internet standards, was *absolutely* necessary, as anyone who's been on Reddit long enough to remember /r/fatpeoplehate knows.

Yes, you're going to see the occassional person in real life with a megaphone screaming that being 300 pounds is healthy or that all white people should die. But according to you, the existence of these people shows a problem with modern society, but the existence of the KKK is a problem with individuals. Extremists have been present at literally *every protest ever,* that doesn't delegitimize what the protest is actually about. In order to make you happy, we all have to have that high school mentality that cynical apathy is cool. Don't get passionate or angry about anything, just stick your head down, mind your own business and try to fit in. Eco-terrorists blowing up dams doesn't mean environmental problems don't exist or is the product of society instead of individuals, protesters crashing a Bernie Sanders rally doesn't mean black people aren't the victims of racist powerful institutions.

4439,"It wouldn't be nearly as fun to play without a friend next to you.

The game has a million good ideas, but basically none of them are executed well. The game's gimmick is that you can use anything as a weapon, but only a handful of them are actually effective, and they run out so far that you're *constantly* looking for something you can use. But you'll soon forget about that problem, because even though it's a zombie game, you spend most of your time running from place to place, escorting NPCs with some of the worst pathfinding AI in video game history, and fighting *humans,* which the controls and gameplay weren't designed around. Many of the control schemes are completely broken, especially the shooting controls, which is what you use during boss battles, and towards the end of the game when your main enemy becomes humans with guns instead of zombies.

The selling point of the game is getting to dick around in the mall, but the game mercilessly punishes you whenever you do exactly that, constantly nagging you to get to the next escort mission or story point, and if you miss even a *single* case you lose the entire game and you have to start all over. And you might accidentally start all over anyway, because whenever you die, you have the option to ""save status and quit,"" which you would think takes you back to the main menu, but it also *erases all your progress,* and you start the story over with just your experience earned. Even worse, you might actually *need* to do that, because the difficulty spike is so bad that it pretty much necessitates playing the first part of the game multiple times in order to level up enough to move forward, or spend most of your time doing escort missions to earn points instead of having fun. I literally don't know a single other game that does this.

And when you do actually manage to move the story forward, it's not even satisfying, because this game's story is completely bland, phoned in, and unoriginal. And it takes itself *dead seriously*, which really clashes with how absurd and comedic the actual game play can be.

Not to mention that the multiple ending system is completely broken. I was *on* the helipad when the timer ran out, but it still gave me the ending as if I had missed it. Turns out, you have to be in this one specific spot on the other side of the mall *exactly* one hour before the timer runs out to activate a cutscene that makes the ending work properly. The game never tells you that you have to do this.

All around, it's a very user-hostile game. It's difficult for all the wrong reasons, with intentionally frustrating and nonsensical design choices instead of creative or challenging gameplay.",2015-12-02 00:01:08+00:00,cxjrhqx,2.0,t1_cxjkvgr,9641.0,gamegrumps

4498,"&gt;Just about every European NHL player grew up dreaming about Olympic gold rather than the Stanley Cup.

1. That's a huge assumption to make, it doesn't matter where you grew up, everyone knows the NHL is the top hockey league in the world. The NHL is home to the best players from every country, and the giants like Canada and USA aren't limited to one roster, so the overall competition is higher. Unless you're from somewhere other than Canada, USA, Russia, Sweden, and Finland, you're far less likely to see your NHL team win the Cup than your country win Gold.

2. We were talking about the *American* sports industry and culture and how it will affect PRO Rugby, and you started this by saying the Oympics and WCoH (that's hilarious) is bigger than the NHL *in North America.* Stop moving the goalposts.

&gt;And that it's every four years is besides the point, so is the RWC. I don't know a single rugby fan or player who would rather win a Super Rugby title than the Rugby World Cup.

You're being confrontational but saying completely unrelated things. My *entire point* is that international play is a bigger deal in rugby than other sports, so yeah of course no rugby player would rather win their club league than the World Cup, you're just agreeing with my original point.

And the fact that it's only four years is the *exact point*, genius. If sport A only has one international every four years (the olympics), and sport B has multiple international tournaments every year (the Six nations, TRC), then international competition is a bigger deal in sport B than sport A.

&gt;Hockey ratings go up massive amounts for the Olympics.

Ratings for pole vaulting, weightlifting, and bobsledding also go up massive amounts for the Olympics. The entire point of the olympics is for people to watch sports they otherwise don't give a shit about. It doesn't matter what the casual flag-wavers care about, it matters what the players and actual fans of the sport care about, that's what a self-sustaining professional sport is based on.",2015-11-25 15:57:27+00:00,cxco38b,8.0,t1_cxcd6xp,31908.0,rugbyunion

That's one of the many reasons you should always introduce someone to the movies starting with the theatrical cuts.

Also 4 1/2 hours is too long for any movie really and most of the scenes added aren't that necessary.

4631,"I really don't get the ""Classic"" status this game has. This game had some great ideas but basically none of them are executed well.

It advertises that everything in the mall is a weapon, and that's true, but only a handful of objects are actually effective, and they break so quickly that you can't actually spend any time killing zombies. The entire gimmick is killing zombies but you spent most of the game running from place to place, fighting humans, and escorting idiots, because killing zombies gets tedious after 10 minutes.

A lot of the controls, especially the shooting controls, are completely broken, which really becomes a problem later in the game when you main enemies becomes human soldiers.

I'm sure everyone has explained the save system. It uses fixed checkpoints even though there's really no *reason* to at the time the game came out. And when you die, the default option is to erase all of your progress and start the story all over again. What's worse, starting the entire thing over again is almost essential. The sharp difficulty curve pretty much necessitates playing the first part of the game a few times over before moving forward. I can't think of a single other game that does that.

Not to mention that the ending system is broken. I was *on* the helipad when the timer ran out but it gave me the ending as if I had missed it, apparently because I didn't talk to this one character on the other side of the mall during a specific time window.",2015-11-13 22:12:45+00:00,cwzdgj2,1.0,t3_3soqpm,15153.0,gamegrumps

4640,"&gt;But then it is the smaller teams missing out anyway.

That's....kind of the point. The automatic qualifications is touted as this way to save time and money but the teams that automatically qualify are the ones that can afford it anyway.

Assuming that the same teams are going to qualify every single World Cup is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Fighting to get into the world cup would be the biggest motivation and experience for the countries outside of Tier 1. I'm not saying to throw Norway up against England, obviously the top countries would get byes to later rounds, like with FIFA, but you should have to earn your trip to the world cup in *some* way. Sure there will be predictable results the first few years but the current set up just maintains the Old Boys Club.

&gt;But then you just have the same teams playing each other over and over more so than now.

How exactly do the one-off tests help that? Did we really need to see England play New Zealand *seven times* over the past five years?

And her entire arc over the past two seasons is her *getting over* that. Making her *own* identity. Finding her *own* family. The name change undoes all the character development that she's gone through since the start of the series.

Every character in fiction has two things: a Want and a Need. A character arc involves said character looking for the Want and finding the Need. A character simply looking for and finding the Want isn't an interesting story. What Skye *wants* is to find out who her birth parents are, what she *needs* is a caring family and her own identity.

It's like the treasure in every pirate movie you've seen. The entire point of the movie is that the treasure doesn't matter, because the real treasure is the people you care about or inner courage or something like that. It's what makes the entire thing work. Think about every decent sports movie you've seen, it's not actually about winning the championship, it's about the relationships between the characters.

Changing her name is literally flat out saying that the most important part of her identity isn't who she is or what she does or the people she shares her life with, it's the circumstances of her birth.

Too bad there's no such thing as non-digital communication. It would be really cool if they invented some kind of public communications device that can't be traced to a specific person. Like a phone that you pay for.

*Exactly.* That is the line that doesn't make sense. Cap *does* have other places to go, and they need a reason why he can't.

5440,"Ah yes, the old ""this movie is perfect and if you disagree you're dumb"" internet mantra. Again, simply because an explanation *exists* but isn't in the movie doesn't get a lazy screenwriter off the hook.

Tony and Steve being on the run is *zero* explanation for not getting help from the other Avengers. It doesn't explain why nobody shows up at the large, very public battles. Cap has no problem traveling hundreds of miles and gets help from a guy he met once while jogging. You can't assume that the audience knows what the character knows, that's basic screenwriting.

Thor fighting the battle of London alone doesn't make sense since Iron Man 3 showed that Stark's suit can apparently fly thousands of miles in a few minutes.

&gt;Not to mention the fact that avengers 1 made it clear they were all going their separate ways.

....so? That is literally not an explanation for anything.

5774,"&gt;The ones vs Djokovic after his win against Roddick.

Oh, so a completely different crowd that occurred a decade ago. 

&gt;Cheering intensely for Federer is totally cool, cheering during a service fault is rude and doesn't make sense.

The guy you're rooting for just got closer to winning. How does it not make sense to cheer for that? By that logic it's ""rude"" to cheer when one team's pitcher throws a walk. If you don't want your opponent's fans to cheer when you double fault, *don't double fault.* Not to mention the fact that this sub seems to collectively ignore all the cheers that happened every time Federer double faulted in order to continue the circlejerk. It's not like Novak didn't have his own army out there.

&gt;that elitism is what makes watching Wimbledon and RG more enjoyable than watching the Heineken™ Half-Time Report™ presented by NASCAR™ at the US-Open Fan Experience Centre on ESPN™.

Wait, so this conversation is about advertising now? How many unrelated things are we going to cover?

&gt;That sort of media coverage tells the public that it's okay to break unwritten rules.

It *is* okay to break unwritten rules. Because they aren't written. Getting worked up about ""unwritten rules"" that the ""tennis illiterate"" don't care about is the *definition* of elitism. Those ""illiterates"" are what allows professional spectator sports to *exist.* Just because an attitude doesn't exist somewhere else doesn't make it wrong.

&gt; I think professional tennis players are so ""in the zone"" that minor lapses of concentration lead to huge swings in momentum.

6196,"&gt;But that is how things work in Middle-earth

...but it's not how *this* world works. It's a disconnection. You have to relate to your readers if you want them invested in your story and caring about your characters. You can invent all the fictional landscapes and societies you want, but the *people* still have to behave like real people if you want the story to be more than just a story to your readers.

&gt;Besides, Aragorn served both Théoden's father and Denethor's father, he has worked for decades to fight Sauron.

But *we* don't know that or have seen it. Yes, by the start of LOTR, Aragorn has been a war hero three times over, has led both Men and Elves against the forces of evil, is well educated,  and is well acquainted with the needs of the common folk. But that's barely even mentioned in the book itself, all his previous adventures are described in the Appendices, after you're done reading the freakin' thing. The reader's first impression of him is just some rogue from the woods outside the Shire who intends to rule a country simply because of who his greatx30-grandfather happened to be and who starts whining when people don't show him enough respect. And if you *do* read the Appendices, it turns out that he doesn't want to be king because it's his responsibility or what's best for his people, he wants it because Elrond told him that he couldn't court Arwen until he's done so. Book Aragorn just isn't a very relatable character. I obviously can't speak for every nation, creed, and culture but I'm very confident when I say that if the movies had made Aragorn's personality the way it is in the books it would have instantly alienated audiences who don't live in a monarchy where that has been accepted as a fact of life. Hell, even modern day monarchies are just figureheads, so it's not like Aragorn's story. I seriously doubt the queen of England would get much support if she suddenly decided that she was entitled to actually run the government.",2015-08-25 05:17:36+00:00,cuesc1k,12.0,t1_cuerscp,1411.0,lotr

From the start of the book, he intends to take the throne of Gondor even though we know nothing about his qualifications or what gives him the right to do that other than his ancestry. He constantly boasts about his lineage and he even starts whining outside the hall in Edoras, saying they have no right to disarm the ""rightful king of Gondor,"" even though he's not fucking *in* Gondor. Making him not *want* the throne is the best decision the movies made. It's the 21st century. We hate the idea of any kind of aristocracy, much less a king.

By every useful definition of a novel, The Silmarillion is not a novel. It has a lot more similarities with a Greek myth anthology or even the Bible than with The Hobbit or LOTR. Each chapter is its own story. Look at how LOTR or The Hobbit reads. A scene is set, and the characters interact with each other through dialogue and we get the main character's thoughts. The Silmarillion doesn't really have scenes, it describes *historical events.* You can count on two hands the instances of actual dialogue we get in The Silmarillion, and those are mostly big long speeches, again like what you would read about in a history book.

Engineers aren't enemies and aren't even in most of the previous games, brutes are the same thing as elites just with a different model, drones were annoying as fuck and weren't fun anyway, which is why you saw less and less of them since Halo 2, and skirmishers didn't show up until Reach (which didn't have the flood *or* prometheans, so actually did have fewer enemies) and have basically the same mechanics as promethean crawlers.

&gt;Prometheans have knights, watchers, and crawlers. Flood have combat forms for human, elite, and brute models, plus carrier forms, ranged forms, stalker forms, tank forms, and infection forms.

All the different combat forms for the flood are just model changes, you can't count them as multiple enemy classes, they don't change the mechanics at all. The different classes of Knights actually behave differently. The ranged/stalker/tank flood are only in Halo 3 and have basically the same mechanics as less dynamic prometheans.

No, that's the definition that you pulled out of your ass. A democracy simply means that the populace has a vote.

The system you're describing where the whole populace vote on specific laws is a *direct* democracy, which 1. happens all the fucking time in this country, referendums are a thing, 2. is only one of the dozens of different forms a democracy can take.

&gt;We are not even a representative democracy.

Superman doesn't have nearly as deep of a rogues gallery as someone like Batman. Something like Bizarro would be too silly, Doomsday isn't a character, and Brainiac requires too much backstory. They were absolutely right to go with Zod as the villain because he's the villain that directly ties in with Superman's origin, and Lex Luthor has already been done to death with the four movies and all the TV shows. The events of Man of Steel now provide a basis for the conflict between Superman and Luthor, if he was in the first movie it would have been too contrived and shallow (like the Chris Reeve movie).

And they didn't ""slap on"" an origin story at the beginning, a superhero's origin story is.....kind of important.

7164,"&gt;Cutler also argued for cricket to strongly consider making a push for Olympic status, something staunchly opposed by England and India.

""Even the cynics cannot deny that the potential of national investment in new markets like China is appealing.""

&gt;Based on the example of rugby sevens, the Chinese Cricket Association would expect to receive $20 million a year from the Chinese government if cricket was included in the Olympics. They currently receive only $30,000 a year from the ICC.

If the ICC is going to try to break into China, they need to do it soon. Baseball has already been in the process for a decade.

7188,"&gt;The prequels show that Jedis are found at an early age and must be yielded very delicately or they'll become corrupt. If you're above a certain age, you aren't accepted because it's believed the emotional tolls are too much for a more developed brain.

...that's also true in ESB. Yoda says that Luke is too old to begin the training. He and Obi-Wan still train him because they have literally no other choice.

&gt; There is a clear difference in his abilities between ANH and ROTJ.

....Yes, I'm saying that, but there was very little training to explain that huge difference. *That's* why I'm saying Luke is inherently talented. He gets trained during the flight to Alderaan, and in the short trip to Degobah.

&gt;There was no prophecy about a chosen one until the Phantom Menace.

That has nothing at all to do with my point. My point is that Anakin doesn't at all negate the idea that a Jedi could be anyone.

I hate when shows jerk themselves off about being empowering to women while being *sexist towards women.* May is made out to be a strong woman while spending that entire episode jealous that her boy toy was forced to fuck another woman. Sif is made out to be a strong woman even though her *literal* only character trait is that she has a schoolgirl crush on Thor.

It's the exact same problem I had with Agent Carter and how everyone jerks that show off for being ""empowering"" to women.",2015-06-19 20:55:37+00:00,csc9ql4,2.0,t1_csc3q8t,9739.0,shield

.....why do you just keep repeating that as if it's an unchangeable fact about yourself? You don't watch ads because you're self-centered.

Nobody *likes* ads, genius. Nobody likes spending money or waiting in lines or paying taxes either. *Adults,* however, realize that things we don't like are necessary because the world *doesn't revolve around you.*

Yup, YouTube is literally the only place on Earth, in all of history that is driven by advertisements. It totally hasn't been that way since the birth of broadcasted entertainment almost a hundred years ago, and isn't the basis of 90% of modern entertainment. Are you 4 years old?

7452,"&gt;You also seem to think that by virtue of creation and making it available that the compensation is guaranteed from whoever accesses it.

It's not guaranteed, because shitheads like you have found ways around it, but it is *deserved.*

&gt;When you say earnings in this case, you seem to be suggesting that the viewer somehow owes some form of compensation to the content creator and that compensation is arrived at through advertising revenue.

Yes, because that's literally the driving force behind the creation of all entertainment. If you managed to pull your head out of your ass and look beyond your own sad existence that would be obvious.

&gt;I disagree with your definition of earnings in this case because I consider earnings to be the agreed upon compensation that is paid out for a service once rendered.

So every single business and service should follow your exact specifications, or people don't deserve to be paid for their work.

&gt;I didn't agree to watch any ads or pay for any content.

You agreed when you clicked on the video, Einstein. Are you really so mentally handicapped that you can't grasp the process of any kind of transation other than the kind you find at a physical store and be walked through it?

&gt; I don't know, I've never read their terms of service. What I do know is that I'm still not watching ads.

&gt;All I meant with the paywall is that we'll see what these ""earnings""

Okay  big guy, putting words in quotes doesn't prove a point. What exactly are you trying to say? That the entertainment you're provided with isn't actually content? Or that the people who put in work to provide that entertainment don't earn a paycheck?

I just love you sitting there and claiming you would actually pay for things behind a paywall instead of just finding a way around that too.

People basically expected Simmons to know everything that the fans know. She doesn't know what the Inhumans are, it could be a contagious plague for all she knew and she had no reason to think otherwise.

We know that Skye's powers can eventually be used and controlled because we read it in the comics. But for every hero origin story, there's one exactly like it that produces a villain, or at least an uncontrollable loose canon.
